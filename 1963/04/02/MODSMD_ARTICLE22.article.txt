# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## Strange Bedfellows: Cleve Herman and Gov. Brown 
### Glenn Alford 
I suppose that almost everyone who reads what I write has
heard of Cleve Herman, and his “Live Line to the World of Sports.’’
However for those who haven’t let me give a short refresher course.
HERMAN IS A RADIO COMMENTATOR for Radio Station
KEWB, 910 kilocycles, broadcasting out of San Francisco. He is one
of those beings I cannot stand, a commentator who reports solely to
tear down. His usual object of scorn is the city of San Francisco and
the Bay Area, and his particular targets are the San Francisco
Giants and 49ers, the Oakland Raiders (thus proving that no one
can be all wrong) and the various college teams in the Area, Stan
ford included.
Herman is also the Sports Director of Radio Station KFWB, 980
kilocycles, in Los Angeles, and probably gets some sort of sadistic
pleasure from tearing down the athletic teams of Los Angeles’ rival
in the North.
Lately however, he has diverted his efforts to another channel.
He has joined the ranks of such noted reformers as Governor Ed
mund G. (Pat) Brown in crying for boxing’s death. I could sympa
thize with his position if he was not trying to use a process which
has been sadly lacking from his other sports commentaries, the
process of reasoning. The self-styled KFWB sports expert who has
used nothing but scathing invective in most, if not all, of his cri
tiques of Bay Area athletics, suddenly has turned to thinking.
Feel, Don't Think!
This comes at a time when feelings are more important than
thoughts.
Boxing is not a subject to which reasoning applies. Governor
Brown and Herman, among others, have very logically pointed out
that two boxing champions have been killed a year and a day apart,
and that many fights are controlled by mobsters.
These facts are all true, but Ihe other side can also resort to
logic in refuting these points ami making a good case for not ban
ning boxing.
Football, long considered a character-building sport from which
the leaders of tomorrow emerge, had 26 deaths in 1962. In auto
racing, considered valuable because of the automotive advances it
brings, the deaths of not only participants, but also spectators are
common-place.
SHOULD BASKETBALL BE LEGISLATED AGAINST? More
corruption has been found there in the last two years than in any
other sport. Pro football has had its gambling scandals and so has
baseball.
The facts are that if boxing is banned after logical reasoning,
then football, auto-racing and basketball all should be abolished
after the same reasoning.
Arguments Are Useless
The only basis for either supporting or opposing boxing is emo
tion. No logical argument is going to change anyone’s mind. “People
are killed in boxing, and mobsters control it anyway,” says Mr. Anti
boxing
“YES, BUT LOOK AT the boys who were killed playing Little
League baseball last year. And look at the investigations into college
basketball and pro football gambling. Should those sports be done
away with?” asks Mr. Pro-boxing. “Boxers know the risks they take.
They decide the money is worth the risks."
A nice logical argument and everyone is back where he started.
Boxing is just like capital punishment or any other controversial
issue in that everyone has his mind made up and no discussion will
change it. It’s no use arguing.
Pure emotion will guide the people of California if the question
of boxing’s continuing in California ever does find its wav to the
ballot.
I can only say that I hope boxing remains legal in California.
But don’t expect me to try to convince you.

process of reasoning. The self-styled KFWB sports expert who has
used nothing but scathing invective in most, if not all, of his cri
tiques of Bay Area athletics, suddenly has turned to thinking.
Feel, Don't Think!
This comes at a time when feelings are more important than
thoughts.
Boxing is not a subject to which reasoning applies. Governor
Brown and Herman, among others, have very logically pointed out
that two boxing champions have been killed a year and a day apart,
and that many fights are controlled by mobsters.
These facts are all true, but Ihe other side can also resort to
logic in refuting these points ami making a good case for not ban
ning boxing.
Football, long considered a character-building sport from which
the leaders of tomorrow emerge, had 26 deaths in 1962. In auto
racing, considered valuable because of the automotive advances it
brings, the deaths of not only participants, but also spectators are
common-place.
SHOULD BASKETBALL BE LEGISLATED AGAINST? More
corruption has been found there in the last two years than in any
other sport. Pro football has had its gambling scandals and so has
baseball.
The facts are that if boxing is banned after logical reasoning,
then football, auto-racing and basketball all should be abolished
after the same reasoning.
Arguments Are Useless
The only basis for either supporting or opposing boxing is emo
tion. No logical argument is going to change anyone’s mind. “People
are killed in boxing, and mobsters control it anyway,” says Mr. Anti
boxing
“YES, BUT LOOK AT the boys who were killed playing Little
League baseball last year. And look at the investigations into college
basketball and pro football gambling. Should those sports be done
away with?” asks Mr. Pro-boxing. “Boxers know the risks they take.
They decide the money is worth the risks."
A nice logical argument and everyone is back where he started.
Boxing is just like capital punishment or any other controversial
issue in that everyone has his mind made up and no discussion will
change it. It’s no use arguing.
Pure emotion will guide the people of California if the question
of boxing’s continuing in California ever does find its wav to the
ballot.
I can only say that I hope boxing remains legal in California.
But don’t expect me to try to convince you.
I suppose that almost everyone who reads what I write has
heard of Cleve Herman, and his “Live Line to the World of Sports.’’
However for those who haven’t let me give a short refresher course.
HERMAN IS A RADIO COMMENTATOR for Radio Station
KEWB, 910 kilocycles, broadcasting out of San Francisco. He is one
of those beings I cannot stand, a commentator who reports solely to
tear down. His usual object of scorn is the city of San Francisco and
the Bay Area, and his particular targets are the San Francisco
Giants and 49ers, the Oakland Raiders (thus proving that no one
can be all wrong) and the various college teams in the Area, Stan
ford included.
Herman is also the Sports Director of Radio Station KFWB, 980
kilocycles, in Los Angeles, and probably gets some sort of sadistic
pleasure from tearing down the athletic teams of Los Angeles’ rival
in the North.
Lately however, he has diverted his efforts to another channel.
He has joined the ranks of such noted reformers as Governor Ed
mund G. (Pat) Brown in crying for boxing’s death. I could sympa
thize with his position if he was not trying to use a process which
has been sadly lacking from his other sports commentaries, the
process of reasoning. The self-styled KFWB sports expert who has
used nothing but scathing invective in most, if not all, of his cri
tiques of Bay Area athletics, suddenly has turned to thinking.
