### 
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (UP!)
—The New York Mets last night
announced the purchase of veter
an outfielder Duke Snider from
the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The terms of the deal were not
revealed immediately but it was
believed to be a straight cash
transaction for approximately
$40,000.
SNIDER, one of the most popu

lar heroes of the old Brooklyn
Dodgers, gives the Mets their
only left-handed hitting outfield
er and is expected to draw many
old Dodger fans to the Polo
Grounds.
Snider, now silver-haired and
reduced to a part-time status
with the talent-rich Dodgers,
said last night that being sold to
the Mets w’ould be “a favor.”
