# SPARTANS EDGE TRIBE IN RELAY
## Trackmen Win Three, Lose to SJS 
### PETE KING GLENN ALFORD 
Cards Win Two

“This team is off to a very
good start and looks like the host
one I’ve ever had.” So said Stan
ford track coach Payton Jordan
j this week in reference to the In
| dians’ track exploits to date.
! The Tribe harriers are indeed
! off to a great start, having won
j three of four dual meets, (he
j Stanford Relays, and displayed
j some fine individual efforts.
A RUN A WAV victory in the
I mile relay, coupled with a fine
Cal showing in second, gave the
Indians just enough points to
beat Han Jose State, 96-95, in the
} Relays. Cal trailed with 61 points.
| Victories by the shot put, shuttle
I hurdles, discus, and 880-yard re
} lay teams sparked the Indians to
the win.
The triangular meet with Ore
gon State and Fresno State was
no contest; the score was Stan
ford 91, OSU 45L, Fresno
Three halfmilers under 1:51.7, a
16-6 high jump by John Fontius,
j and a sweep in the 440 were the
[outstanding Stanford efforts.
I Jordan has special praise for
I several of his proteges. The most
I pleasant surprise, he points out,
1 is the sprinting of junior Eric
! Frische. Frische pulled the upset
j of the day when he flashed past
j San Jose State speedster Lloyd
| Murad to win the 100-yard dash
i in the Relays. The top freshman
sprinter in 1961, Frische sat out
last season because of illness. His
performances have helped give
Stanford its best sprint crew in
many seasons.

ANOTHER standout is hurdler
Steve Cortright, who has yet to
lose a high hurdles race this year.
Against Oregon Slate and Fres
no State, he clipped off a 14.4,
equalling his best time. He also
is Stanford’s best triple jump
man, and should easily be the
team’s high scorer for the season,
Jordan also has a glow of satis
faction when talking about Dan
Prono and Sheridan Downey.
Prono in a month has improved
his best javelin mark a remark
able 33 feet to 202-B’-, and is
helping fill the vast void left by
the graduation of record-holder
Ait Batchelder. Downey has been
improving rapidly in the triple
jump, going from fourth in the
relays to first last Saturday.

SJS 76, Cards 69

“Fill the moat and raise the
drawbridge," San Jose State
Track Coach Sir Bud Winter told
Payton Jordan early last week,
because we’re gonna storm the
bastions.” Winter was trying to
inspire his Spartan spikers to
avenge their earlier one-point
loss to Stanford in the Stanford
Relays.
WELL, THE Indians filled the
moat, but they left the draw
bridge down a fraction of a sec
ond too long, and Dwight Middle
ton, anchor man of the Spartan
mile relay team, sneaked over it
in a heart-stopping victory to give
the Spartans a 76-69 win in the
Stanford-San Jose dual meet held
Saturday in the Stadium. The
contest was a triangular between
Stanford, SJS and Oklahoma, but
it soon was evident that the
Sooners were outclassed, and that
the meet would be strictly be
tween Stanford and State.
The triangular score was a tie
at 83 apiece for Stanford and
SJS, with 15 for Oklahoma.
Stanford had to fight from way
behind to even be in contention.
Late in the meet, with only four
events remaining, San Jose held
a 69-44 lead. The Spartans needed
only four points in the triple
jump, two-mile, intermediate
hurdles and mile relay to win.
They almost didn’t get them.
STKVE ('OUTRIGHT started
off the comeback with a win in
the intermediate hurdles, and
Phil Arnaudo kept Stanford hopes
alive with a close second in a
race that was almost a dead heal.
Cortright got hot in the triple
jump and took the lead in that
event with a leap of 47-6 '<>. Sheri
dan Downey got off a foul jump
of close to 49 feet, and went 47-
7D on his next to last chance and
won, giving Stanford another 1-2.
The meet was now down to the
two-mile and the relay, and for
Stanford to even have a chance,
a T2 in the two-mile was a neces
sary, but highly unlikely proba
bility. SJS distance runner Danny
Murphy had a sub-8:50 time, 20
seconds better than any Stanford
runner had done this year. But
the miracle happened.
PAUL SCHLICKE stayed on
Murphy’s heels throughout the
first five laps and suddenly the
tiny Spartan collapsed with what
was later called an active ulcer.
Schlicke was home free and won
the race in 9:01. Harry McCalla

and Weym Kirkland swept past
Spartan captain Jeff Fishback
for a 1-2-3 Stanford finish and
only the relay was left. Whoever
won it won the meet.
Stanford was behind through
out the event until the last lap,
when Ken Emanuels was dueling
Middleton. The lanky Spartan
pulled away and opened up a
seven-yard gap going into the
backstretch. Emanuels sped up
and when the two came into the
stretch they were even. But Mid
dleton marie it to the drawbridge
first and stormed the bastion
four inches sooner than Emanu
els.
STANFORD got excellent per
formances from almost every
one. McCalla ran a best-of-life
4:04.4-mile to trounce old rival
Ben Tucker, who had managed
to keep ahead of McCalla in the
Stanford Relays and squeak out
an SJS win. When McCalla was
asked after the race if he was
trying to get oven with Tucker,
he said “You’re damn right!" Mc-
Calla, who is a good bet to be the
first Negro to break the four
minute barrier, also had a good
9:03.8 two-mile lime.
Cortright won the high hurdles
in addition to his fine efforts in
the intermediate hurdles and the
hop-slep-jump.
ONE FINE performance that
went unheralded in light of the
other heroics was Dan Prono’s
202-8 Vi javelin throw. This was 20
feet better than he had ever
thrown before, and kept Stanford
in the meet ’til the bitter end.
The Hollywood script writer
had envisioned a stirring come
from-behind finish, but he chick
ened out, and the Indians was
killed.

ton, anchor man of the Spartan
mile relay team, sneaked over it
in a heart-stopping victory to give
the Spartans a 76-69 win in the
Stanford-San Jose dual meet held
Saturday in the Stadium. The
contest was a triangular between
Stanford, SJS and Oklahoma, but
it soon was evident that the
Sooners were outclassed, and that
the meet would be strictly be
tween Stanford and State.
The triangular score was a tie
at 83 apiece for Stanford and
SJS, with 15 for Oklahoma.
Stanford had to fight from way
behind to even be in contention.
Late in the meet, with only four
events remaining, San Jose held
a 69-44 lead. The Spartans needed
only four points in the triple
jump, two-mile, intermediate
hurdles and mile relay to win.
They almost didn’t get them.
STKVE ('OUTRIGHT started
off the comeback with a win in
the intermediate hurdles, and
Phil Arnaudo kept Stanford hopes
alive with a close second in a
race that was almost a dead heal.
Cortright got hot in the triple
jump and took the lead in that
event with a leap of 47-6 '<>. Sheri
dan Downey got off a foul jump
of close to 49 feet, and went 47-
7D on his next to last chance and
won, giving Stanford another 1-2.
The meet was now down to the
two-mile and the relay, and for
Stanford to even have a chance,
a T2 in the two-mile was a neces
sary, but highly unlikely proba
bility. SJS distance runner Danny
Murphy had a sub-8:50 time, 20
seconds better than any Stanford
runner had done this year. But
the miracle happened.
PAUL SCHLICKE stayed on
Murphy’s heels throughout the
first five laps and suddenly the
tiny Spartan collapsed with what
was later called an active ulcer.
Schlicke was home free and won
the race in 9:01. Harry McCalla

and Weym Kirkland swept past
Spartan captain Jeff Fishback
for a 1-2-3 Stanford finish and
only the relay was left. Whoever
won it won the meet.
Stanford was behind through
out the event until the last lap,
when Ken Emanuels was dueling
Middleton. The lanky Spartan
pulled away and opened up a
seven-yard gap going into the
backstretch. Emanuels sped up
and when the two came into the
stretch they were even. But Mid
dleton marie it to the drawbridge
first and stormed the bastion
four inches sooner than Emanu
els.
STANFORD got excellent per
formances from almost every
one. McCalla ran a best-of-life
4:04.4-mile to trounce old rival
Ben Tucker, who had managed
to keep ahead of McCalla in the
Stanford Relays and squeak out
an SJS win. When McCalla was
asked after the race if he was
trying to get oven with Tucker,
he said “You’re damn right!" Mc-
Calla, who is a good bet to be the
first Negro to break the four
minute barrier, also had a good
9:03.8 two-mile lime.
Cortright won the high hurdles
in addition to his fine efforts in
the intermediate hurdles and the
hop-slep-jump.
ONE FINE performance that
went unheralded in light of the
other heroics was Dan Prono’s
202-8 Vi javelin throw. This was 20
feet better than he had ever
thrown before, and kept Stanford
in the meet ’til the bitter end.
The Hollywood script writer
had envisioned a stirring come
from-behind finish, but he chick
ened out, and the Indians was
killed.

“This team is off to a very
good start and looks like the host
one I’ve ever had.” So said Stan
ford track coach Payton Jordan
j this week in reference to the In
| dians’ track exploits to date.
! The Tribe harriers are indeed
! off to a great start, having won
j three of four dual meets, (he
j Stanford Relays, and displayed
j some fine individual efforts.
A RUN A WAV victory in the
I mile relay, coupled with a fine
Cal showing in second, gave the
Indians just enough points to
beat Han Jose State, 96-95, in the
} Relays. Cal trailed with 61 points.
| Victories by the shot put, shuttle
I hurdles, discus, and 880-yard re
} lay teams sparked the Indians to
the win.
The triangular meet with Ore
gon State and Fresno State was
no contest; the score was Stan
ford 91, OSU 45L, Fresno
Three halfmilers under 1:51.7, a
16-6 high jump by John Fontius,
j and a sweep in the 440 were the
[outstanding Stanford efforts.
I Jordan has special praise for
I several of his proteges. The most
I pleasant surprise, he points out,
1 is the sprinting of junior Eric
! Frische. Frische pulled the upset
j of the day when he flashed past
j San Jose State speedster Lloyd
| Murad to win the 100-yard dash
i in the Relays. The top freshman
sprinter in 1961, Frische sat out
last season because of illness. His
performances have helped give
Stanford its best sprint crew in
many seasons.

ANOTHER standout is hurdler
Steve Cortright, who has yet to
lose a high hurdles race this year.
Against Oregon Slate and Fres
no State, he clipped off a 14.4,
equalling his best time. He also
is Stanford’s best triple jump
man, and should easily be the
team’s high scorer for the season,
Jordan also has a glow of satis
faction when talking about Dan
Prono and Sheridan Downey.
Prono in a month has improved
his best javelin mark a remark
able 33 feet to 202-B’-, and is
helping fill the vast void left by
the graduation of record-holder
Ait Batchelder. Downey has been
improving rapidly in the triple
jump, going from fourth in the
relays to first last Saturday.

SJS 76, Cards 69

“Fill the moat and raise the

Calla, who is a good bet to be the
first Negro to break the four
minute barrier, also had a good
9:03.8 two-mile lime.
Cortright won the high hurdles
in addition to his fine efforts in
the intermediate hurdles and the
hop-slep-jump.
ONE FINE performance that
went unheralded in light of the
other heroics was Dan Prono’s
202-8 Vi javelin throw. This was 20
feet better than he had ever
thrown before, and kept Stanford
in the meet ’til the bitter end.
The Hollywood script writer
had envisioned a stirring come
from-behind finish, but he chick
ened out, and the Indians was
killed.

“This team is off to a very
good start and looks like the host
one I’ve ever had.” So said Stan
ford track coach Payton Jordan
j this week in reference to the In
| dians’ track exploits to date.
! The Tribe harriers are indeed
! off to a great start, having won
j three of four dual meets, (he
j Stanford Relays, and displayed
j some fine individual efforts.
A RUN A WAV victory in the
I mile relay, coupled with a fine
Cal showing in second, gave the
Indians just enough points to
beat Han Jose State, 96-95, in the
} Relays. Cal trailed with 61 points.
| Victories by the shot put, shuttle
I hurdles, discus, and 880-yard re
} lay teams sparked the Indians to
the win.
The triangular meet with Ore
gon State and Fresno State was
no contest; the score was Stan
ford 91, OSU 45L, Fresno
Three halfmilers under 1:51.7, a
16-6 high jump by John Fontius,
j and a sweep in the 440 were the
[outstanding Stanford efforts.
I Jordan has special praise for
I several of his proteges. The most
I pleasant surprise, he points out,
1 is the sprinting of junior Eric
! Frische. Frische pulled the upset
j of the day when he flashed past
j San Jose State speedster Lloyd
| Murad to win the 100-yard dash
i in the Relays. The top freshman
sprinter in 1961, Frische sat out
last season because of illness. His
performances have helped give
Stanford its best sprint crew in
many seasons.

ANOTHER standout is hurdler
Steve Cortright, who has yet to
lose a high hurdles race this year.
Against Oregon Slate and Fres
no State, he clipped off a 14.4,
equalling his best time. He also
is Stanford’s best triple jump
man, and should easily be the
team’s high scorer for the season,
Jordan also has a glow of satis
faction when talking about Dan
Prono and Sheridan Downey.
Prono in a month has improved
his best javelin mark a remark
able 33 feet to 202-B’-, and is
helping fill the vast void left by
the graduation of record-holder
Ait Batchelder. Downey has been
improving rapidly in the triple
jump, going from fourth in the
relays to first last Saturday.

SJS 76, Cards 69

“Fill the moat and raise the
drawbridge," San Jose State
Track Coach Sir Bud Winter told
Payton Jordan early last week,
because we’re gonna storm the
bastions.” Winter was trying to
inspire his Spartan spikers to
avenge their earlier one-point
loss to Stanford in the Stanford
Relays.
WELL, THE Indians filled the
moat, but they left the draw
bridge down a fraction of a sec
ond too long, and Dwight Middle
ton, anchor man of the Spartan
mile relay team, sneaked over it
in a heart-stopping victory to give
the Spartans a 76-69 win in the
Stanford-San Jose dual meet held
Saturday in the Stadium. The
contest was a triangular between
Stanford, SJS and Oklahoma, but
it soon was evident that the
Sooners were outclassed, and that
the meet would be strictly be
tween Stanford and State.
The triangular score was a tie
at 83 apiece for Stanford and
SJS, with 15 for Oklahoma.
Stanford had to fight from way
behind to even be in contention.
Late in the meet, with only four
events remaining, San Jose held
a 69-44 lead. The Spartans needed
only four points in the triple
jump, two-mile, intermediate
hurdles and mile relay to win.
They almost didn’t get them.
STKVE ('OUTRIGHT started
off the comeback with a win in
the intermediate hurdles, and
Phil Arnaudo kept Stanford hopes
alive with a close second in a
race that was almost a dead heal.
Cortright got hot in the triple
jump and took the lead in that
event with a leap of 47-6 '<>. Sheri
dan Downey got off a foul jump
of close to 49 feet, and went 47-
7D on his next to last chance and
won, giving Stanford another 1-2.
The meet was now down to the
two-mile and the relay, and for
Stanford to even have a chance,
a T2 in the two-mile was a neces
sary, but highly unlikely proba
bility. SJS distance runner Danny
Murphy had a sub-8:50 time, 20
seconds better than any Stanford
runner had done this year. But
the miracle happened.
PAUL SCHLICKE stayed on
Murphy’s heels throughout the
first five laps and suddenly the
tiny Spartan collapsed with what
was later called an active ulcer.
Schlicke was home free and won
the race in 9:01. Harry McCalla

and Weym Kirkland swept past
Spartan captain Jeff Fishback
for a 1-2-3 Stanford finish and
only the relay was left. Whoever
won it won the meet.
Stanford was behind through
out the event until the last lap,
when Ken Emanuels was dueling
Middleton. The lanky Spartan
pulled away and opened up a
seven-yard gap going into the
backstretch. Emanuels sped up
and when the two came into the
stretch they were even. But Mid
dleton marie it to the drawbridge
first and stormed the bastion
four inches sooner than Emanu
els.
STANFORD got excellent per
formances from almost every
one. McCalla ran a best-of-life
4:04.4-mile to trounce old rival
Ben Tucker, who had managed
to keep ahead of McCalla in the
Stanford Relays and squeak out
an SJS win. When McCalla was
asked after the race if he was
trying to get oven with Tucker,
he said “You’re damn right!" Mc-
Calla, who is a good bet to be the
first Negro to break the four
minute barrier, also had a good

“This team is off to a very
good start and looks like the host
one I’ve ever had.” So said Stan
ford track coach Payton Jordan
j this week in reference to the In
| dians’ track exploits to date.
! The Tribe harriers are indeed
! off to a great start, having won
j three of four dual meets, (he
j Stanford Relays, and displayed
j some fine individual efforts.
A RUN A WAV victory in the
I mile relay, coupled with a fine
Cal showing in second, gave the
Indians just enough points to
beat Han Jose State, 96-95, in the
} Relays. Cal trailed with 61 points.
| Victories by the shot put, shuttle
I hurdles, discus, and 880-yard re
} lay teams sparked the Indians to
the win.
The triangular meet with Ore
gon State and Fresno State was
no contest; the score was Stan
ford 91, OSU 45L, Fresno
Three halfmilers under 1:51.7, a
16-6 high jump by John Fontius,
j and a sweep in the 440 were the
[outstanding Stanford efforts.
I Jordan has special praise for
I several of his proteges. The most
I pleasant surprise, he points out,
1 is the sprinting of junior Eric
! Frische. Frische pulled the upset
j of the day when he flashed past
j San Jose State speedster Lloyd
| Murad to win the 100-yard dash
i in the Relays. The top freshman
sprinter in 1961, Frische sat out
last season because of illness. His
performances have helped give
Stanford its best sprint crew in
many seasons.

ANOTHER standout is hurdler
Steve Cortright, who has yet to
lose a high hurdles race this year.
Against Oregon Slate and Fres
no State, he clipped off a 14.4,
equalling his best time. He also
is Stanford’s best triple jump
man, and should easily be the
team’s high scorer for the season,
Jordan also has a glow of satis
faction when talking about Dan
Prono and Sheridan Downey.
Prono in a month has improved
his best javelin mark a remark
able 33 feet to 202-B’-, and is
helping fill the vast void left by
the graduation of record-holder
Ait Batchelder. Downey has been
improving rapidly in the triple
jump, going from fourth in the
relays to first last Saturday.

SJS 76, Cards 69

“Fill the moat and raise the
drawbridge," San Jose State
Track Coach Sir Bud Winter told
Payton Jordan early last week,
because we’re gonna storm the
bastions.” Winter was trying to
inspire his Spartan spikers to
avenge their earlier one-point
loss to Stanford in the Stanford
Relays.
WELL, THE Indians filled the
moat, but they left the draw
bridge down a fraction of a sec
ond too long, and Dwight Middle
ton, anchor man of the Spartan
mile relay team, sneaked over it
in a heart-stopping victory to give
the Spartans a 76-69 win in the
Stanford-San Jose dual meet held
Saturday in the Stadium. The
contest was a triangular between
Stanford, SJS and Oklahoma, but
it soon was evident that the
Sooners were outclassed, and that
the meet would be strictly be
tween Stanford and State.
The triangular score was a tie
at 83 apiece for Stanford and
SJS, with 15 for Oklahoma.
Stanford had to fight from way
behind to even be in contention.
Late in the meet, with only four
events remaining, San Jose held
a 69-44 lead. The Spartans needed
only four points in the triple
jump, two-mile, intermediate
hurdles and mile relay to win.
They almost didn’t get them.
STKVE ('OUTRIGHT started
off the comeback with a win in
the intermediate hurdles, and
Phil Arnaudo kept Stanford hopes
alive with a close second in a
race that was almost a dead heal.
Cortright got hot in the triple
jump and took the lead in that
event with a leap of 47-6 '<>. Sheri
dan Downey got off a foul jump
of close to 49 feet, and went 47-
7D on his next to last chance and
won, giving Stanford another 1-2.
The meet was now down to the
two-mile and the relay, and for
Stanford to even have a chance,
a T2 in the two-mile was a neces
sary, but highly unlikely proba
bility. SJS distance runner Danny
Murphy had a sub-8:50 time, 20
seconds better than any Stanford
runner had done this year. But
the miracle happened.
PAUL SCHLICKE stayed on
Murphy’s heels throughout the
first five laps and suddenly the
tiny Spartan collapsed with what
was later called an active ulcer.
Schlicke was home free and won
the race in 9:01. Harry McCalla

and Weym Kirkland swept past
Spartan captain Jeff Fishback
for a 1-2-3 Stanford finish and
only the relay was left. Whoever
won it won the meet.
Stanford was behind through
out the event until the last lap,
when Ken Emanuels was dueling
Middleton. The lanky Spartan
pulled away and opened up a
seven-yard gap going into the
backstretch. Emanuels sped up
and when the two came into the
stretch they were even. But Mid
dleton marie it to the drawbridge
first and stormed the bastion
four inches sooner than Emanu
els.
STANFORD got excellent per
formances from almost every
one. McCalla ran a best-of-life
4:04.4-mile to trounce old rival
Ben Tucker, who had managed
to keep ahead of McCalla in the
Stanford Relays and squeak out
an SJS win. When McCalla was
asked after the race if he was
trying to get oven with Tucker,
he said “You’re damn right!" Mc-
Calla, who is a good bet to be the
first Negro to break the four
minute barrier, also had a good
9:03.8 two-mile lime.
Cortright won the high hurdles
in addition to his fine efforts in
the intermediate hurdles and the
hop-slep-jump.
ONE FINE performance that
went unheralded in light of the
other heroics was Dan Prono’s
202-8 Vi javelin throw. This was 20
feet better than he had ever
thrown before, and kept Stanford
in the meet ’til the bitter end.
The Hollywood script writer
had envisioned a stirring come
from-behind finish, but he chick
ened out, and the Indians was
killed.

“Fill the moat and raise the
drawbridge," San Jose State
Track Coach Sir Bud Winter told
Payton Jordan early last week,
because we’re gonna storm the
bastions.” Winter was trying to
inspire his Spartan spikers to
avenge their earlier one-point
loss to Stanford in the Stanford
Relays.
WELL, THE Indians filled the
moat, but they left the draw
bridge down a fraction of a sec
ond too long, and Dwight Middle
ton, anchor man of the Spartan
mile relay team, sneaked over it
in a heart-stopping victory to give
the Spartans a 76-69 win in the
Stanford-San Jose dual meet held
Saturday in the Stadium. The
contest was a triangular between
Stanford, SJS and Oklahoma, but
it soon was evident that the
Sooners were outclassed, and that
the meet would be strictly be
tween Stanford and State.
The triangular score was a tie
at 83 apiece for Stanford and
SJS, with 15 for Oklahoma.
Stanford had to fight from way
behind to even be in contention.
Late in the meet, with only four
events remaining, San Jose held
a 69-44 lead. The Spartans needed
only four points in the triple
jump, two-mile, intermediate
hurdles and mile relay to win.
They almost didn’t get them.
STKVE ('OUTRIGHT started
off the comeback with a win in
the intermediate hurdles, and
Phil Arnaudo kept Stanford hopes
alive with a close second in a
race that was almost a dead heal.
Cortright got hot in the triple
jump and took the lead in that
event with a leap of 47-6 '<>. Sheri
dan Downey got off a foul jump
of close to 49 feet, and went 47-
7D on his next to last chance and
won, giving Stanford another 1-2.
The meet was now down to the
two-mile and the relay, and for
Stanford to even have a chance,
a T2 in the two-mile was a neces
sary, but highly unlikely proba
bility. SJS distance runner Danny
Murphy had a sub-8:50 time, 20
seconds better than any Stanford
runner had done this year. But
the miracle happened.
PAUL SCHLICKE stayed on
Murphy’s heels throughout the
first five laps and suddenly the
tiny Spartan collapsed with what
was later called an active ulcer.
Schlicke was home free and won
the race in 9:01. Harry McCalla

and Weym Kirkland swept past
Spartan captain Jeff Fishback
for a 1-2-3 Stanford finish and
only the relay was left. Whoever
won it won the meet.
Stanford was behind through
out the event until the last lap,
when Ken Emanuels was dueling
Middleton. The lanky Spartan
pulled away and opened up a
seven-yard gap going into the
backstretch. Emanuels sped up
and when the two came into the
stretch they were even. But Mid
dleton marie it to the drawbridge
first and stormed the bastion
four inches sooner than Emanu
els.
STANFORD got excellent per
formances from almost every
one. McCalla ran a best-of-life
4:04.4-mile to trounce old rival
Ben Tucker, who had managed
to keep ahead of McCalla in the
Stanford Relays and squeak out
an SJS win. When McCalla was
asked after the race if he was
trying to get oven with Tucker,
he said “You’re damn right!" Mc-
Calla, who is a good bet to be the
first Negro to break the four
minute barrier, also had a good
9:03.8 two-mile lime.
Cortright won the high hurdles
in addition to his fine efforts in
the intermediate hurdles and the
hop-slep-jump.
ONE FINE performance that
went unheralded in light of the
other heroics was Dan Prono’s
202-8 Vi javelin throw. This was 20
feet better than he had ever
thrown before, and kept Stanford
in the meet ’til the bitter end.
The Hollywood script writer
had envisioned a stirring come
from-behind finish, but he chick
ened out, and the Indians was
killed.

“This team is off to a very
good start and looks like the host
one I’ve ever had.” So said Stan
ford track coach Payton Jordan
j this week in reference to the In
| dians’ track exploits to date.
! The Tribe harriers are indeed
! off to a great start, having won
j three of four dual meets, (he
j Stanford Relays, and displayed
j some fine individual efforts.
A RUN A WAV victory in the
I mile relay, coupled with a fine
Cal showing in second, gave the
Indians just enough points to
beat Han Jose State, 96-95, in the
} Relays. Cal trailed with 61 points.
| Victories by the shot put, shuttle
I hurdles, discus, and 880-yard re
} lay teams sparked the Indians to
the win.
The triangular meet with Ore
gon State and Fresno State was
no contest; the score was Stan
ford 91, OSU 45L, Fresno
Three halfmilers under 1:51.7, a
16-6 high jump by John Fontius,
j and a sweep in the 440 were the
[outstanding Stanford efforts.
I Jordan has special praise for
I several of his proteges. The most
I pleasant surprise, he points out,
1 is the sprinting of junior Eric
! Frische. Frische pulled the upset
j of the day when he flashed past
j San Jose State speedster Lloyd
| Murad to win the 100-yard dash
i in the Relays. The top freshman
sprinter in 1961, Frische sat out
last season because of illness. His
performances have helped give
Stanford its best sprint crew in
many seasons.

ANOTHER standout is hurdler
Steve Cortright, who has yet to
lose a high hurdles race this year.
Against Oregon Slate and Fres
no State, he clipped off a 14.4,
equalling his best time. He also
is Stanford’s best triple jump
man, and should easily be the
team’s high scorer for the season,
Jordan also has a glow of satis
faction when talking about Dan
Prono and Sheridan Downey.
Prono in a month has improved
his best javelin mark a remark
able 33 feet to 202-B’-, and is
helping fill the vast void left by
the graduation of record-holder
Ait Batchelder. Downey has been
improving rapidly in the triple
jump, going from fourth in the
relays to first last Saturday.
