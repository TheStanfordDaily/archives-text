## 
### 
Stanford track coach Payton i
Jordan this weekend was named
as head coach for the United
States team which will meet Rus
sia in Moscow next July. He was
selected by a vote of 102 men |
affiliated with the AAU, NCAA,
NAIA, YMCA and other organiza
tions throughout the country.
It was the first time a Western
er had been so honored since the
late Jess Mortensen of USC was

appointed assistant coach for the
1959 meet in Philadelphia.
The U.S.-Russia meet was held
in Stanford Stadium last year,
and Russian coach Gavriel Korob
kov was reportedly extremely
pleased with the treatment shown
his athletes by Jordan and the
Stanford staff. He is anxious to
return to Stanford in 1965.
Jordan was an assistant coach
at the first U.S.-Russian meet in
1958 in Moscow. His reaction to
his selection was one of surprise.
“I didn’t expect to be selected—
it’s just something that happen
ed,” said Jordan. “Naturally I’m
quite pleased to be given this
consideration with all the other
great coaches around, and I’m
proud to be associated with the
U.S. team.”
