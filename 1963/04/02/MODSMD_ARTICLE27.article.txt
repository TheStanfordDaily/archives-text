By lI.M DONOVAN
During the past fortnight mem
bers of tho Stanford swimming
team participated in two national
meets, the AAU championships at
Yale and the NCAA champion
ships at Raleigh, North Carolina. |
Marty Hull became the national
champion in the 200-yard breast
stroke by winning the event at |
Raleigh.
THE FIVE Indi an swimmers, I
Hull. Illka Suvanto, Pete Petti-1
grew, Mike Doscher and Dave )
Gildea hurried through their ex- j
ams and left for Yale on Wednes
day, arriving in New Haven |
shortly after midnight lot the}
meet the following day.
The Indians were understanda
bly unable to overcome their fa
tigue and, though Suvanto, Petti
grew, Gildea and Doscher all
turned in the best times of theii i
careers, no Stanford athlete was !
able to qualify for tho final heats.
A rested, determined Stanford
team arrived in Raleigh however.
Hull became the national cham
pion in the 200-yard breaststroke
with a time of 2:17, setting a new
Stanford record as well. Ho also
placed for fourth in the 100-yard j
butterfly. Hull will represent the 1

| United States in water polo at the
| Pan-American games which will
be held on April 20, in Sao Paula.
| Brazil.
SUVANTO finished third in the
500-yard freestyle with a 5:01.7,
j setting a new Stanford record and
j a personal record. Suvanto placed
: sixth in the 1650-yard freestyle
J with a time of 18:04, but failed
j to qualify in the 200-yard butter
! fly by a tenth of a second.
Pettigrew, swimming the 100-
and 200-yard backstroke events,
j Doscher in the 50-, 100-, and 200-
! yard freestyle races and Gildea in
j the 100- and 200-yard breaststroke
| events all turned in excellent
limes, but failed to qualify for the
championship heat. However. Pet
tigrew, Gildea and Doscher com
bined with Hull to finish fourth
in the medley relay.
THE STANFORD team, scor-
I ing 21 points, placed 6th in the
meet. Of the five competitors
only Pettigrew is a junior; the
others are all sophomores. With
another year of experience and
with the aid of this year’s frosh
team and of any transfer stu
dents, the Indians can anticipate
j an even higher national ranking
1 in a year’s time.
