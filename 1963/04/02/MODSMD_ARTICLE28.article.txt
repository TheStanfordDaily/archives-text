# Ex-Stanford Cops Receive Jail Terms
## 
### 
Two former Stanford policemen
were sentenced to jail terms for
their role in campus burglaries
last summer. A third ex-officer
is petitioning the San Jose Super
ior Court Judge in charge of the
case for dismissal of the complaint
against him for insufficient evi
dence.
Hartley E. Conradc, 16, pleaded
guilty to grand theft of two tape
recorders and was sentenced to
five months in the Santa Clara
County jail. The other convicted
ex-policeman was Wesley Lock
lear, 32, who was given a two
month jail term after being found
guilty of conspiring to obstruct
justice. The third defendant, Rob
ert George, will have his motion
for dismissal judged next Friday.
Both of the guilty men were also
placed on two years probation.
Locklear and Conradc were on the
same “Quad Beat.’’ Conradc was
fired August 5 for “unofficer like
conduct”, hut Locklear was still on
the force when both men were
arrested in November.
