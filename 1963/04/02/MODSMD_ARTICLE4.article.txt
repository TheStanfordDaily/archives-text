### 
WASHINGTON A U.S. space expert told inquiring congress
men yesterday that he believes Russia now has the ability to send a
man to the moon. The United States’ first manned flight to the
moon is believed at least four years away.
Norman V. Petersen, technical director of the Air Force flight
test center at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., made the statement
testifying before the House subcommittee on manned space flight.
He said if the Soviets give major emphasis to “a single lunar’ mis
sion. using earth-orbital rendezvous, they would have the ability to
accomplish this at the present time.”
“Then you wouldn’t he surprised to see the Russians going to
the moon tomorrow?” asked Rep. Emilio Q. Daddaria, D-Conn.
“No.” Petersen said.
ANTI-CASTRO RAIDERS CAPTURED -MIAMI The British war
ship Londonderry guided by U.S. Naval planes captured a Cuban
exile raiding party in the Bahamas Sunday but a second raider es
caped and sped toward Cuban waters to “blow up a Soviet tanker.”
The naval action was first announced by Cuban underground
exile sources here and then confirmed reluctantly by the British
Admiralty and the U.S. State Department. The sources said the un
identified skipper of the second raider, a 31-foot high-speed vessel,
warned that he would not surrender to interception. He threatened
to fire on anybody “including U.S. Navy units” who try to capture
him, the sources said.
