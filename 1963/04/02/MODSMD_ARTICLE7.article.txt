### 
Albert Johnson, American Cor
respondent for “Sight and Sound”,
advisory editor of “Film Quarter
ly”, and editor of “Imagery” is the !
promoter of three Polish movies
to be shown at Stanford this I
month.
The International Club will pre- |
sent “Jalsagar (The Music Room)” j
today at 4:15 p.m. in Cubberly
Auditorium for an admission fee !
of 50c. Johnson, who is responsi
ble for bringing these “outstand
ing foreign films” into the coun
try, said this about “Jalsagar”:
“With this film, the famous In
dian director (Satejup Ray)
proved that he is one of the world's
greatest living film makers. Un
like his “Apu Trilogy, which is a
humanistic pastorale, “Jalsagar,
(The Music Room)” is the psycho
logical study of the Indian land
owner of the recent past, and not |
only an indictment of aesthetic [
hedonism carried to its utmost ex
pressions of selfishness and delu
sion, hut a compassionate tribute j
to an artistic dilettante’s incorrup
tible taste. Ray shows us a man {
whose love for classical music, {
song and dance dominates his en
tire life, making him almost obliv- j
ions to his family and the chang
ing times. The fusions of symbol [
and sweeping poetic images are i
incredibly beautiful, making the
film a haunting moodpiece, almost I
Gothic in atmosphere. Chabi Bis- (
was, in the leading role, gives an j
incomparable performance, and
the musical sequences are a rare !
treat of South Asian culture.
The International Club will also
present “See You Tomorrow,” a
sophisticated love theme, and
“Battleship of Potemkin,” on April
9 and 10.
