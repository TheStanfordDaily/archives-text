# University Policy Liberalized; Trustees Approve Constitution
## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
The Board of Trustees, in their March meeting, approved the
new constitution and issued a policy statement concerning the
use ot Stanford facilities for sectarian and partisan political ac
tivity.
According to Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler, the

Trustee action came in re
sponse to questions raised by re
newed interest of students in
their role at the University, as
evidenced by the KPFA contro
versy and the student body’s pas
sage of the new constitution.
Under the new constitution, the
Associated , Students relinquish
the power to control the forma
tion of student groups on campus.
This action was part of a con
certed effort by students and fac
ulty, working through the Stu
dent Affairs and Services Com
mittee as well as the ASSU, to
obtain a reevaluation of the Uni
versity’s policies concerning par
tisan political and sectarian ac
tivity on campus.
THE KPFA ISSUE crystalized
some of the problems involved
with the existing mechanism for

collective student expression.
Students insisted they had a
right to speak out on public is
sues in spite of Administration
insistence that existing regula
tions were sufficient to prevent
this.
Trustee approval of the new
constitution acknowledged stu
dent desire to refrain from the
prior censorship of groups. The
policy statement that accompani
ed the approval provides the ma
chinery for the formation of stu
dent groups on campus. It also
acknowledges the right of stu
dents to express themselves col
lectively on issues outside the
university community which
might interest them and provides
a machinery for this expression.
The Trustees policy states that
organizations
• in which membership is not
mandatory,
• whose membership is limit
ed to Stanford students and other
members of the Stanford Univer
sity community, and

• whose purposes and proce
dures are not inconsistent with
the goals and standards of the
University”
may form on campus.
IF THK GROUP desires, it may
register with the University
through the Student Affairs and
Services Committee. This will en
title it to use Tresidder and other
University facilities for open
meetings under the sponsorship
of the Political Union or the Com
mittee on Religious Affairs, de
pending on whether the organiza
tion is political or sectarian.
Registration will also allow
these groups to publicly take a
stand on an issue outside the
University community, provided
the organizations involved clearly
identify themselves in any pub
lic statements and make it clear
that their views do not repre
sent the University or the Asso
ciated Students.
If a voluntary organization be
comes a member of the Students’
organization fund, that is, banks
through the University, it may
hold closed meetings in Tresidder
and in other University facilities.
Special exception to this rule will
be made in the case of religious
organizations in the area sur
rounding the campus, with the
approval of the Financial Direc
tor of the Associated Students.

The new legislature will
liold its first meeting on
April II in Tresldder. The
postponement is due to open
houses this week.
The following statement was
made by Dean VVinbigler:
STANFORD has long encour
aged student discussion of re
ligious, social and political ideas
and issues. The new policy and
regulations represent a major
step forward in making the facili
ties of the University available to
voluntary Stanford student or
ganizations which are concerned
with sectarian religious affairs,
as well as those which are con
cerned with political and social
action.
The new provisions also make
it possible for such organizations
to be identified with Stanford
without threat to the integrity of

the University's non-sectarian and
non-partisan position, which is a
mandate based upon its education
al obligations as well as its con
stitutional obligations.
In the formulation of the policy
and regulations, careful attention
was given to the privilege of in
dividual students to make their
positions on public issues known
and their privilege to band to
gether voluntarily to advocate
commonly held views. Equal at
tention was given to the privi
lege of dissent from common
views, particularly as it affects
individuals i n organizaitons
whose membership is not volun
tary.
MAJOR responsibilities will fall
upon the Political Union and the
Committee on Religious Affairs
in sponsoring programs of volun
tary student organizations in
their respective areas. The new
regulations presuppose the re
organization of the Political
Union to permit voluntary or
ganizations concerned with action
on political and social issues to
have a relationship to the Union
somewhat similar to that of the
present caucuses, but maintain
ing structural independence from
the Union. This seems to me en
tirely feasible and should add to
the vitality of the Political Un
ion.
The University preamble to the
new ASSU Constitution repre
sents no change in the relation
ship of the ASSU to the rest of
the University. It is a formal ex
pression of the existing relation
ship.
