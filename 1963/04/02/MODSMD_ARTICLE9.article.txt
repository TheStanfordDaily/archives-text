### 
Commenting on the recent ac
tion by the Board of Trustees,
ASSU President Armin Rosen
cranz declarer! that “this is a ma
jor victory for student rights at
Stanford. On behalf of the student
body I would like to express our
gratitude toward the trustees for
redefining University policy to
ward political and religious groups
on campus.”
“IT IS A TRIBUTE,” he con
tinued, “to what can be accom
plished when students, faculty,
administration, and trustees work
together to form sound educa
tional policy and to provide a lib
eral education for all who come
to study here.”

“Many student leaders, includ
ing myself, will feel that the new
policy does not go far enough, but
the President has listened patient
ly to our arguments and we have
certainly had a fair hearing.”
Rosencranz announced his inten
tion of forming a voluntary asso
ciation of students, with as wide
a base as possible, to concern itself
with social and political action be
yond the campus under the new
Trustee policy. He said there
would be an informal meeting of
all those interested in being part
of such an association at 9:30 p.m.
Wednesday in Bowman Alumni
House.
THE TRUSTEE action, said Ro
sencranz. culminated an effort to
reexamine University policy to
ward sectarian and partisan po
litical activity in the light of an
increased student awareness of
and interest in contemporary is
sues.

The effort included informal dis
cussions between students, faculty
and administration. The delibera
tions of the Student Affairs and
Services Commit lee and the regu
lar meetings between student lead
ers and President Sterling were
especially significant, said Rosen
cranz.
These activities were reinforced
by the passage of the constitution,
Legislature's stands on proposi
tions 13 and 24, and the KPFA
issue. The KPFA issue in turn
drew comments from alumni, as
well as further response from the
faculty and from student living
groups.
IX CONCLUSION Rosencranz
stated: "Although a great deal has
been accomplished this year, I
hope that in succeeding years stu
dent leaders will make maximum
use of the opportunities available
for speaking out on issues of so
cial justice.”
