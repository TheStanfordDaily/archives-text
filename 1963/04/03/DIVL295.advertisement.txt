Letâ€™s take a mid-week
exam of your suit sup
ply, now that Spring
is really flowering
and weekend affairs
are in the making.
Could be you could
use another campus
classic, the Ivy suit
with vest. Very au
thentic at R A, narrow
lapels, tapered trou
sers, hook vent,
matching vest, welt
seams, etc. Fine selec
tion of fabrics and
colors, sizes to fit per
fectly. A very basic
and very intelligent
investment at 49.90
and 59.90, made
easier with your
Super/Charge.
