Missed A.F.R.0.T.C.?
I S
Go A.F.O.T.S!
These letters stand for Air Force Officer
Training School—a three-month course for
those who realize they want to become
Air Force officers, but don’t have enough
school time left to enroll in AFROTC.
We prefer our officers to start their training
as freshmen, so we can commission them
directly upon graduation. But right now we’re
accepting applications for another fine way
to become an Air Force officer-OTS. We
can’t guarantee that this program will still j
be open a year or so from now.
As an Air Force officer, you’ll be a leader on
the Aerospace Team, serving your country
while you get a flying headstart on the tech
nology of the future. The U.S. Air Force
sponsors one of the world's most advanced
research and development programs —and
you can be part of it.
If you're within 210 days of graduation, get
more information on OTS from the Professor
of Air Science.
