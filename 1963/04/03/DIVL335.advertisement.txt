Special edition Falcon V-8 "Sprint'
defeats the world's best in final
490-mile test section on icy
Alpine cliff roads ... then
outperforms every sedan on
famous Monaco circuit!
Falcon picked the world's roughest winter ordeal
to reveal an astonishing now brand of tola/ per
formance. Four days and three nights through an
inferno of ice, snow, freezing log, endless curves
—2,500 miles against an implacable time schedule,
designed to try a car's reliability, road-holding
and performance to the ultimate. Experts said a
first-time car couldn't hope to finish—and tsvo
thirds of the 296 competitors did drop out. But
Falcon not only placed first and second in its
c lass, it defeated every car, regardless of class, on
the brutal Chambery-Monte Carlo final leg, set
best time among all finishers in all of the six
special test sections —and showed its heels to
every sedan in the dramatic three-lap elimination
on Monaco's famous round-the-houses course.
You couldn't get better proof of lolal performance
anywhere!

FALCONS TOOK CURVES LIKE THESE— hundreds upon hundreds of them-anrl proved that road
holding is not a European monopoly. In fact, Sports Illustrated magazine called them "the new
kings of the mountains" and quoted a London newspaper as declaring, "The Falcons are part ol
a power and performance plan that will shake up motoring in every country of the world."
DEEP SNOW on the Col do Turin! special section didn't
even slow the "Sprint." Anti sure-footed Falcon also
amazed the Rallye exports by its traction on glare ice.

STORMING ALONG IN THE FRENCH DUSK, a Falcon
plunges into the third night behind the special lights that
let a Rallye driver see around curves, spot patches ol ice,
penetrate fog.
"LACETS" is French for zigzags like these.
It means "bootlaces", but to Rallye drivers
it means an ultimate test of steering,
stability, brakes and, above all. durability.
Americas liveliest,
most carefree cars!
BEST or ALL "TOURING" CATEGORY CARS in the three-lap
Monaco circuit was the Falcon piloted by Swedish ice expert Bo
Ljungfcldt. It was surpassed by only three cars, all of them two
seater sports cars in the Grand Touring category.
