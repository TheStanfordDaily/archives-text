Famed historian Arnold Toynbee predicted the end of war as
a human institution, as a record crowd flocked Memorial Audi
torium.

Two hundred people in the
yard outside, and the capacity

Little Theatre, 500 in the court
-1710 in the Auditorium listened
to Toynbee’s analysis of four ma
jor current events approached
with the question, “Has this
event any historical precedence?”
His four events were the feeling
►
of living in an age of crisis, war,
, the shrinkage of the size of the
■ world, and increasing regimenta
j tion.
The historian’s outlook indi
] cates to him that the underlying
presuppositions of war as an in
stitution have become invalid.
Toynbee listed these presupposi
tions as two: "that a soldier has
a good chance of being able ef-

; fectively to defend his family and
country; that a war will come to
an end. one side will win and one
will lose, and that to be victori
ous is infinitely better.”
THE SPEAKER cited Sparta
sending 300 soldiers to the Pass
of Thermopylae in an attempt to
delay action, but expecting all to
j lose their lives there. “In an
j atomic war all would be destroyed
in the same flash as killed the
300 Spartans.”
“And this surely makes non
sense of the institution of war.
This means the atomic weapon is
not just another in the long list
of destructive weapons. It is dif
ferent in kind.”
The 74-year-old historian’s
I treatment of the “shrinkage of
the world” brought forth opti
mistic statements. Toynbee called
upon the precedent of man’s in
genuity to allay fears of using
up the planet’s resources.
“There is much virgin flint in
existence as man gave up flint
weapons for metal. Perhaps be
fore man runs out of metal he
will discover something more
efficient.”
THE GROWTH of world popu
: lation completed Toynbee's third
point and led into his fourth; reg
imentation. He noted, “up to now
the number of children in a fam
ily has been regarded as an in
dividual matter. Now it might
become a matter in which public
authorities will say a word.”
“There is a certain cussed and
mule-like part of human nature
that is the despair of those who
try to regiment.”
