# The 						Role of Student Government
## 
### 
One of the* most important issues involved in the recent
policy statement and regulations issued by the Board of Trus
tees is the definition and limitation of the role of student gov
ernment at Stanford.
The position held by the University, as stated in the Policy
Statement, contends that it “is not a function of student gov
ernment at Stanford" to engage in the "expressing of opinions
or taking positions with respect to . . . matters” concerned
with “contemporary affairs;” i.e., with affairs outside the cam
pus community.
The question can be raised about just what affairs shall be
called within and without the concern of the campus com
munity. The student community as a whole is becoming more
and more, concerned with “contemporary affairs.” It is gratify
ing to note that the students at Stanford are refusing to iso
late themselves from the outside world, and are beginning to
recognize that matters which trouble the great men and coun
tries of the world are their problems also. Students are begin
ning to recognize that any usurpation of life or freedom, any
where, is a partial usurpation of life and freedom to everyone.
Students are concerned most strongly, as they should he,
with those affairs which have a direct impact on the student
world itself. Thus, riots of African students in Bulgaria and
the suspension ol the editor of a college newspaper are, and
should be, of concern to students at Stanford.
The student government is the ideal and logical organ to
express concern about student matters. The student govern
ment is the only organization on campus which represents the
entire student community, and, with the new LASSU, will be
highly representative. It would be perfectly proper to ask that
LASSU delay voting on controversial matters for a week to
allow for constituency voting, and to require that the Legisla
ture designate its membership, representation and vote with
each statement of policy.
It is very unfortunate that the new University policy does
not allow for such statements from the student government
and legislature. Unlike the student governments of a great
number of other universities, Stanford’s student government
will not he able to react to those' affairs which, as student
affairs, should so concern it.
