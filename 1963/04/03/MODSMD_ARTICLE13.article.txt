## 'The Clay Report' 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Tho Clay Report on foreign aid deals with an immense sub
ject in a few pages. For that reason alone it will not furnish the
general public, which includes most of the members of Congress,
with enough material for that serious reappraisal which iias
become so necessary.
The report mentions most of the questions which have to be
asked, but what it gives are its answers and not the facts and
the reasoning by which its conclusions were reached. As a re
sult, the ordinary reader receives litle more than a bundle of
declarations as to what ought and ought not to be done. He gets
little help toward an enlightened debate.
There is an explanation for this. The committee, which con
sists of 10 eminent men, was appointed last December “to ad
vise the President, the secretary of state, the secretary of de
fense and the administrator of the Agency for Internaitonal De
velopment.” Quite evidently, that is exactly what it has done,
and done, it appears with profit to the administration. The re
port is not really a public document meant to clarify a public
discussion. It is, so to speak, an inter-office memorandum for
the insiders of the administration and is no doubt highly signifi
cant and intelligible to those who have taken part in the con
ferences which are not reported in (he report.
Because it is the kind of document it is, it will, I am afraid,
provoke unfortunate reactions abroad. It is peppered with criti
cism which, because it is anonymous and not specific, could
apply to some or all of the recipients of foreign aid. No country
would he able to tell whether it is or is not being criticized.
Furthermore, the report contains a sweeping criticism of all our
allies, including Canada, for what they do or do not do in foreign
aid.
I am sure that this was not the intention. But I do not think
it is merely charitable to say that the committee was son in
tensely concerned with advising the administration insiders that
it did not realize what its report would sound like to the vast
world of the outsiders.
If the report was to be a public document, and of course it
had to be, it should not have declared only its conclusions. It
should have rgued them persuasively. In my view, this was en
tirely practicable since the main theme is sound.
Thus, it is quite true that “we are trying to do too much for
too many too soon, that we are overextended in resources and
undercompensated in results and lhat no end of foreign aid is
either in sight or in mind.” It follows, rightly enough, that we
should not try to give aid to the 95 countries and territories
which are now receiving it and that we should, instead, focus
our aid so that it is enough to do the job in key countries. We
must find away to stop diluting and diffusing it all over the
globe. Let the bridges we have to build be fewer, but let all of
them cross the river.
The committee is quite right, I believe, in advising the ad
ministration to let ex-colonial Africa depend chiefly on Europe
for aid. And if 1 read between the lines correctly, it is asking
the administration to concentrate aid for Asia, apart from the
military subsidies, on India and Pakistan.
When it comes to Latin America, the report shows little evi
dence of a serious knowledge of the actual problem of inducing
the Latin peoples to emerge from their primitive past into tho
modern age. In fact, there is a considerable ideological confusion
in that the report seems to say that the only alternative to com
munism is the American form of private enterprise.
That is not true. There are many forms of a mixed economy
• —some of them very successful in Europe—which are quite
different both from Soviet communism and American capitalism.
Whether we like it or not, most Latin-American countries are
pointed toward one form or another of a mixed economy, and we
should not give them the impression that we are incapable of
understanding w'hy they are pointing that way.
I feel I must say, also, that the report itself exemplifies one
of (he principal reasons why, though since 1946 this country has
spent some $lOO billion in foreign aid, it is so much disliked in
so many places. A persistent theme is that we should be giving
and withholding favors, which mean so much in human terms, in
our own interest. There is in this on assumption of superiority
which is abrasive in the kind of world we are living in—for the
most part very poor and for (he most part of some other color
than white.
With our great wealth and power, there should go humility,
not pride. Thirty years ago, this country had not only the respect
and the trust, but also tho affection of the underdeveloped world.
Yet it had no foreign aid program. Why? Because 30 years ago.
the country was struggling with its own desperate economic
problems and with the rising menace of fascism. Because we had
grave problems of our own, we were not proud and self-satisfied,
and we gave the effect of being in the same boat with the rest of
mankind. That was when we had friends all over the world.
We shall not have them again until this country becomes
possessed once again, as it surely will when the political seasons
change, in the high enterprise of making a good society.

Furthermore, the report contains a sweeping criticism of all our
allies, including Canada, for what they do or do not do in foreign
aid.
I am sure that this was not the intention. But I do not think
it is merely charitable to say that the committee was son in
tensely concerned with advising the administration insiders that
it did not realize what its report would sound like to the vast
world of the outsiders.
If the report was to be a public document, and of course it
had to be, it should not have declared only its conclusions. It
should have rgued them persuasively. In my view, this was en
tirely practicable since the main theme is sound.
Thus, it is quite true that “we are trying to do too much for
too many too soon, that we are overextended in resources and
undercompensated in results and lhat no end of foreign aid is
either in sight or in mind.” It follows, rightly enough, that we
should not try to give aid to the 95 countries and territories
which are now receiving it and that we should, instead, focus
our aid so that it is enough to do the job in key countries. We
must find away to stop diluting and diffusing it all over the
globe. Let the bridges we have to build be fewer, but let all of
them cross the river.
The committee is quite right, I believe, in advising the ad
ministration to let ex-colonial Africa depend chiefly on Europe
for aid. And if 1 read between the lines correctly, it is asking
the administration to concentrate aid for Asia, apart from the
military subsidies, on India and Pakistan.
When it comes to Latin America, the report shows little evi
dence of a serious knowledge of the actual problem of inducing
the Latin peoples to emerge from their primitive past into tho
modern age. In fact, there is a considerable ideological confusion
in that the report seems to say that the only alternative to com
munism is the American form of private enterprise.
That is not true. There are many forms of a mixed economy
• —some of them very successful in Europe—which are quite
different both from Soviet communism and American capitalism.
Whether we like it or not, most Latin-American countries are
pointed toward one form or another of a mixed economy, and we
should not give them the impression that we are incapable of
understanding w'hy they are pointing that way.
I feel I must say, also, that the report itself exemplifies one
of (he principal reasons why, though since 1946 this country has
spent some $lOO billion in foreign aid, it is so much disliked in
so many places. A persistent theme is that we should be giving
and withholding favors, which mean so much in human terms, in
our own interest. There is in this on assumption of superiority
which is abrasive in the kind of world we are living in—for the
most part very poor and for (he most part of some other color
than white.
With our great wealth and power, there should go humility,
not pride. Thirty years ago, this country had not only the respect
and the trust, but also tho affection of the underdeveloped world.
Yet it had no foreign aid program. Why? Because 30 years ago.
the country was struggling with its own desperate economic
problems and with the rising menace of fascism. Because we had
grave problems of our own, we were not proud and self-satisfied,
and we gave the effect of being in the same boat with the rest of
mankind. That was when we had friends all over the world.
We shall not have them again until this country becomes
possessed once again, as it surely will when the political seasons
change, in the high enterprise of making a good society.

Tho Clay Report on foreign aid deals with an immense sub
ject in a few pages. For that reason alone it will not furnish the
general public, which includes most of the members of Congress,
with enough material for that serious reappraisal which iias
become so necessary.
The report mentions most of the questions which have to be
asked, but what it gives are its answers and not the facts and
the reasoning by which its conclusions were reached. As a re
sult, the ordinary reader receives litle more than a bundle of
declarations as to what ought and ought not to be done. He gets
little help toward an enlightened debate.
There is an explanation for this. The committee, which con
sists of 10 eminent men, was appointed last December “to ad
vise the President, the secretary of state, the secretary of de
fense and the administrator of the Agency for Internaitonal De
velopment.” Quite evidently, that is exactly what it has done,
and done, it appears with profit to the administration. The re
port is not really a public document meant to clarify a public
discussion. It is, so to speak, an inter-office memorandum for
the insiders of the administration and is no doubt highly signifi
cant and intelligible to those who have taken part in the con
ferences which are not reported in (he report.
Because it is the kind of document it is, it will, I am afraid,
provoke unfortunate reactions abroad. It is peppered with criti
cism which, because it is anonymous and not specific, could
apply to some or all of the recipients of foreign aid. No country
would he able to tell whether it is or is not being criticized.

When it comes to Latin America, the report shows little evi
dence of a serious knowledge of the actual problem of inducing
the Latin peoples to emerge from their primitive past into tho
modern age. In fact, there is a considerable ideological confusion
in that the report seems to say that the only alternative to com
munism is the American form of private enterprise.
That is not true. There are many forms of a mixed economy
• —some of them very successful in Europe—which are quite
different both from Soviet communism and American capitalism.
Whether we like it or not, most Latin-American countries are
pointed toward one form or another of a mixed economy, and we
should not give them the impression that we are incapable of
understanding w'hy they are pointing that way.
I feel I must say, also, that the report itself exemplifies one
of (he principal reasons why, though since 1946 this country has
spent some $lOO billion in foreign aid, it is so much disliked in
so many places. A persistent theme is that we should be giving
and withholding favors, which mean so much in human terms, in
our own interest. There is in this on assumption of superiority
which is abrasive in the kind of world we are living in—for the
most part very poor and for (he most part of some other color
than white.
With our great wealth and power, there should go humility,
not pride. Thirty years ago, this country had not only the respect
and the trust, but also tho affection of the underdeveloped world.
Yet it had no foreign aid program. Why? Because 30 years ago.
the country was struggling with its own desperate economic
problems and with the rising menace of fascism. Because we had
grave problems of our own, we were not proud and self-satisfied,
and we gave the effect of being in the same boat with the rest of
mankind. That was when we had friends all over the world.
We shall not have them again until this country becomes
possessed once again, as it surely will when the political seasons
change, in the high enterprise of making a good society.

Tho Clay Report on foreign aid deals with an immense sub
ject in a few pages. For that reason alone it will not furnish the
general public, which includes most of the members of Congress,
with enough material for that serious reappraisal which iias
become so necessary.
The report mentions most of the questions which have to be
asked, but what it gives are its answers and not the facts and
the reasoning by which its conclusions were reached. As a re
sult, the ordinary reader receives litle more than a bundle of
declarations as to what ought and ought not to be done. He gets
little help toward an enlightened debate.
There is an explanation for this. The committee, which con
sists of 10 eminent men, was appointed last December “to ad
vise the President, the secretary of state, the secretary of de
fense and the administrator of the Agency for Internaitonal De
velopment.” Quite evidently, that is exactly what it has done,
and done, it appears with profit to the administration. The re
port is not really a public document meant to clarify a public
discussion. It is, so to speak, an inter-office memorandum for
the insiders of the administration and is no doubt highly signifi
cant and intelligible to those who have taken part in the con
ferences which are not reported in (he report.
Because it is the kind of document it is, it will, I am afraid,
provoke unfortunate reactions abroad. It is peppered with criti
cism which, because it is anonymous and not specific, could
apply to some or all of the recipients of foreign aid. No country
would he able to tell whether it is or is not being criticized.
Furthermore, the report contains a sweeping criticism of all our
allies, including Canada, for what they do or do not do in foreign
aid.
I am sure that this was not the intention. But I do not think
it is merely charitable to say that the committee was son in
tensely concerned with advising the administration insiders that
it did not realize what its report would sound like to the vast
world of the outsiders.
If the report was to be a public document, and of course it
had to be, it should not have declared only its conclusions. It
should have rgued them persuasively. In my view, this was en
tirely practicable since the main theme is sound.
Thus, it is quite true that “we are trying to do too much for
too many too soon, that we are overextended in resources and
undercompensated in results and lhat no end of foreign aid is
either in sight or in mind.” It follows, rightly enough, that we
should not try to give aid to the 95 countries and territories
which are now receiving it and that we should, instead, focus
our aid so that it is enough to do the job in key countries. We
must find away to stop diluting and diffusing it all over the
globe. Let the bridges we have to build be fewer, but let all of
them cross the river.
The committee is quite right, I believe, in advising the ad
ministration to let ex-colonial Africa depend chiefly on Europe
for aid. And if 1 read between the lines correctly, it is asking
the administration to concentrate aid for Asia, apart from the
military subsidies, on India and Pakistan.
