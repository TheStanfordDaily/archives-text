Editors, The Daily:
The open letter published by several newspapers— e.g., by
the Washington Post on March 13—and urging President Ken
nedy to ‘halt U.S. military intervention in South Vietnam’ paints
a picture in black and white, colors more compatible with the
‘socialist realism’ of Communist propaganda'than with the ob
jectivity of a free press.
According to that picture, there are two sides to the conflict
in South Vietnam; Ngo Dinh Diem and the self-styled ‘National
Liberation Front.’ Since everybody knows that Diem is a dic
tator, and a not very benevolent one either, that makes the
Front a band of ‘freedom fighters,’ at least. Or, as Fidel Castro
calls them, ‘Vietnamese patriots.’
Of course, those ‘patriots’ do wish to ‘liberate’ the South
Vietnamese people, but in the same way and for the same pur
pose as, in James Thurber’s fable for our times, the foxes wished
to ‘liberate’ the orioles and set up a ‘government of the orioles,
by the foxes', and for the foxes.’
The Front is indeed a ‘front’—in its literal sense, that is, a
facade behind which the Communists conceal their designs from
well-meaning and ill-informed people like most (if not all) of
those 62 distinguished Americans who signed the letter (includ
ing a professor from Stanford).
If they really care about freedom, they ought to learn of
another side to the tragedy of South Vietnam: the plight of those
nationalists caught between Diem and the Communists, of men
who oppose dictatorship from either Right or Left. There are at
least 25,000 of them in his concentration camps and many more
in hiding or in exile.
And, lest we forget, there are the South Vietnamese masses.
On their behalf, it may not. be too rash to assume that they de
sire and deserve something better than the right to trade one
tyrant for another, a privilege the sponsors of the letter seem to
confer upon them implicitly.
Those Americans are justified in thinking that no amount of
American aid could ever help Diem win the war. But to go on
from there and suggest that the United States should withdraw
all assistance from South Vietnam is a non sequitur equating
12 million people with one man. It is like saying (hat they must
now pay for his mistakes, mistakes which the United States
government itself has helped to perpetuate by giving him blind,
all-out support.
It is American diplomacy, money, and arms that have kept
Diem in power and so far prevented the emergence of an alter
native capable of turning the tide against the Communists. To
call it quits now before democratic forces in South Vietnam have
had a chance to rally and fight would be to betray them once
more, and this time irretrievably, The South Vietnamese people
would be left defenseless, without any prospect for self-deter
mination- unless we believe as the letter implies that, unlike
Diem, the Communists will ‘allow normal democratic procedures
for political opposition and an orderly change of government.’
This and other things may tempt us to suspect Communist
influence in the drafting of the letter. For example, it is known
that the moving spirit behind it was Dr. Corliss Lamont, a Marx
ist, and that it was reproduced in Hanoi the very same day it
was printed in Washington.
It does not necessarily take an international Communist
conspiracy to undermine freedom, however. The road to the
Marxist hell on earth can be paved witli good intentions warped
by ignorance or naivete or both.
