## New Civil Defense Plan Protested; Bomb Shelters Seen As 'Ugly Joke 
### FEU, FENDER 
That the appearance of bomb shelters on the Stanford campus
is being met with criticism is amply indicated by the petition
with over 200 signatures protesting the shelters. Some object to
the fact that fallout shelters give citizens a false sense of security
about the possibility of surviving a nuclear attack. Others may
feel that the appearance of shel-4

ters increases the fear of the pos
sibility of a nuclear war.
But perhaps the funniest and
most paradoxical objection is that
man has “progressed” so far that
he must now crawl into a hole in
order to escape from and survive
his own creation. Man has be
come so “civilized” that now ho
is very close to returning to the
“uncivilized” state of nature.
What will shelters mean in an
atomic attack?
THEY WILL mean that thou
sands will crowd into a little hole
in the ground. Some will get in,
some won't. People will go to ex
tremes to make sure that their
enemies won’t get in. (The people
of Las Vegas, for instance, were
advised a few years ago to buy
rifles in order to fight off the
citizens of Los Angeles escaping
fallout.)
Indeed, in a very short time,
the United States might change
from a democracy to the con
dition of every man for himself
and survival of the fittest.
And when those few who do
survive emerge, theirs will be the
joy of adjusting to a world large
ly destroyed, contaminated and
devoid of people. Water will be
undrinkable, food ungrowable,
and future generations will be
born armless or mentally unbal
anced. The only result of a nu
clear war will be the murder of
mankind.
“OUR ONLY shelter is peace”

is not a cute slogan. Peace with
out the fear of nuclear weapons
is the only shelter against nu
clear horror.
Creating fallout shelters is ac
centuating the problem by deny
ing a peaceable solution to the
world’s problems. Certainly fall
out shelters are little more than
an ugly joke.
