WASHINGTON (CPS) — Dele
gates to the National Student
Association’s conference early last
month on the proposed National
Service Corps were all for the
idea. But many of the delegates
| voiced serious reservations about
j current administration planning
i for the undertaking.
At one point an ad hoc commit
| tee of members of Young Ameri
i cans for Freedom introduced a
I resolution calling for “abandon
ment” of the project — and suf
fered an ignominious defeat in
| (he ensuing plenary vote.
A member of the President’s
i study group on "national volun
i tary services” said that of 10,000
students who had returned ques
tionnaires on the subject to his
office, 72 percent indicated that
they would seriously consider
j serving in the new corps.
BUT IF THE delegates to the
j conference supported the idea of
j a domestic peace corps, they were
j not excited about it. In the lunch
| line, in the lobby of the student
i union at American University,
| whore the conference was held,
the talk among the students was
of other things. The tremendous
enthusiasm generated at a similar
N S A conference on the Peace
Corps two years ago was nowhere
j in evidence.
| There were several reasons in
| dicated for the tepid response of
| the delegates. It is clear that the
idea of a national service corps

lacks the glamour and adventure
of the Peace Corps. Innoculating
babies in a Philadelphia s 1 um,
albeit a desperately needed serv
ice, is just not the same thing as
innoculating babies in Nigeria.
And, too, this conference was
notably lacking in inspiring
speech-making of the type pro
vided by Sen. Hubert Humphrey
and Dr. Harold Taylor two years
ago.
But these are superficial rea
sons. The important problem that
the NSA conference revealed is
that the type of service corps
which would challenge and excite
young people would never get
Congressional approval; and the
corps that Congress may legislate
would remain unsatisfying to stu
dents who have spent their under
graduate years deeply involved in
such cases as combatting racial
discrimination.
THERE WAS general agree
ment among the delegates on the
basic themes of the service corps
proposal as sketched out by such
speakers as Richard Boone, head
of the President’s study group.
Boone emphasized that the pro
gram would have limited funds
and manpower (probably about
5,000 the first yeari and would
have to choose projects where it
could make a “distinctive” con
tribution.
Boone listed two ways the corps
could make such contributions:
The first would be to increase the
"visibility” of chronic problems
which seldom receive public no
tice, He included in this group
the plight of Indians in some
areas, migrant workers, and the
whole spectrum of evils publicized
in Michael Harrington’s “Th e
Other America”, a recently pub
lished account of poverty in Amer
ica.
A second great contribution of

the service corps, according to
Boone, would be as a “catalyst”
to spur local communities to ac
tion on serious problems. He said
that hopefully, most service corps
\ projects would eventually be
taken over completely by the local
citizens.
BUT IP' THE delegates to the
NS A conference subscribed to
these general themes, they object
ed to the vagueness of some speak
ers on more specific questions,
particularly in the area of struc
ture and control of the service
corps projects and the priority of
projects.
The basic principle set forth
was that the service corps would
only take on projects when re
quested to do so by local authori
ties. When questioned, Boone ex
tended “local authorities” to in
clude private agencies with no
governmental connections. But it
was never made clear, much to
the dissatisfaction of the dele
delegates, whether a Congress
man or state administrator could
have the power to block projects
requested by private agencies.
In private discussions, Boone
later elaborated that each proj
ect's merits would he weighed
against the tenor of local opposi
tion. then either instituted or re
jected. This would mean, in fact,
that Congressmen, city councils,
or state officials would probably
be able to keep out the corps if
they felt strongly enough on the
matter. And there is little doubt
that projects aimed at modifying
the social character of a region
would meet with insurmountable
resistance from the entrenched
Southern Congressional delega
tion.
SOME STUDENT delegates
wore even more pessimistic over
the prospects for the service corps
in the South. They argued that
no legislation which did not allow
Southern veto power over local
projects would pass Congress.
