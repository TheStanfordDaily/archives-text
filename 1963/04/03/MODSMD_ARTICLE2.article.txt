# Historian Speaks On Foreign Policy
## 
### NORMAN REITZ 
“I am the great optimist”, said
Arnold Toynbee, famed British
historian, yesterday at a press
conference at the San Francisco
airport. The human race, he said,
‘‘has an instinct for survival and
won’t snuff itself out.”
The resolution of the East-West
conflict is the first step towards
survival, he said, because, if cur
rent growth rales persist, half
the people of the world will be
Chinese by the year 2000. The
Chinese will control the world, he
said, unless they are counteracted
by a co ordinated opposition.
One world government, Toyn
bee claimed, is a practical possi
bility. The government would
possess wide regulatory powers
and individual political and eco
nomic freedom would diminish.
Ho predicted that religious activi
ty would substitute for the closed
areas of activity.
Toynbee was asked if man
learns from experience. He re
plied, “We are no better individ
ually but we can develop better
manners and customs.” The his
torian, he said, “knows something
about our public experience." Con
sequently the work of the histor
ian can contribute to improving
man's social situation.
The necessity to repress narrow
nationalism, he said, results from
the world wide consequences of
action by oven the smallest state.
"Habits are hard to change," he
said, so nationalistic quarrels
could lead to world war. The
struggle for survival will not be
easy: “Wo can't take civilization
for granted: we have to fight to
maintain it.”
Toynbee commented on Eng
land's entrance into a common
market system. He said that Eng
land should have joined the Euro
pean Common Market in its be
ginning stages.
As an Englishman Toynbee pro
vided an outsider’s opinion of
American foreign policy. Ho
found two evident flaws: 1) the
refusal to recognize Red China
and 2> ignoring the plight of the
Arabs in the Middle East.
But he stated what he hold to
be a hallmark of American cul
ture. “You are very much ready
to acknowledge your mistakes and
to start again.”
