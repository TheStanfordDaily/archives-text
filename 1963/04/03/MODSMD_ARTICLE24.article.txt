# TRIBE WINS SCRUM AXE
## Indian Ruggers Blank Last Five Opponents to End Great Season 
### PETE KING 
Finishing with a flourish by
winning its last five games, Stan
ford’s rugby team completed its
most successful season in ()iute
a while.
On March 23-24 Stanford swept
four games to win the Monterey
Rugby tournament. The Indians
finished with a 13-1 season rec
ord. making them the best team
on the Coast. The only team to
beat them was the Universities
Club of San Francisco, which
Stanford had beaten previously.
THE INDIANS also had a one
loss season in 1960, but in that
year Cal beat them. This year
Stanford won two games from

the Bears to win the Big Scrum
Axe for the third straight year.
The Indians also shut out their
last five opponents, while scoring
64 points of their own.
On March 9 a superior Stan
ford defense won out over a
determined Cal team and the
Tribe posted a 6-0 victory on the
Stanford field. Gordon Waddell
scored the first try from 10 yards
out after Glenn Myers had set
the play up with a fine run. Beau
Bianchi iced it by blocking a Cal
kick, picking up the ball, and
scampering 10 yards for a score.
AT MONTEREY, the Indians
made the tournament officials
(who picked the Kats Club of
British Columbia as the favorite)
look like idiots by successively
beating Oregon State, 14-0, Uni
versities Club of L.A., 9-0, USC,
13-0, and chasing the Kats back
to B.C. with a 22-0 licking.
Coach Pete Kmetovich had
special praise for the play of
Waddell, Keith Richmond, and
Steve Vannort in the tournament.
Waddell, who wound up as the
team’s high scorer with 25 points
for the year, played his best rug
by in the tournament. Both he
and Richmond were mainstays in
the Card backfield, with their
kicking and passing helping as
much as their scoring.

Vannort made a nuisance of
himself against USC. He ran into,
over, around, and through the
hapless Trojans all afternoon and
scored the winning goal, too,
KMETOVIC’ named break
aways Frank Patitucci and Tim
Hansel as outstanding defense
men, and praised 260-pound Dick
Leeuwenherg for his work on
line-out plays. He was also
pleased with the play of fullback
Dick Ragsdale and Bob Burke.
Ragsdale scored 15 points, de
spite not turning out until the
fifth game, while Burke was
third highest scorer, with 22
points.
However, all these satisfactions
are surpassed by the fact that
virtually the entire team will be
returning next year. Most of the
seniors will still be around in
graduate school, and since there
is no limit whatsoever on the
number of seasons a student can
play, they'll still be able to par
ticipate.
The JV rugby team finished its
season with a 6-4 record, with
most of its losses close ones.

Axe for the third straight year.
The Indians also shut out their
last five opponents, while scoring
64 points of their own.
On March 9 a superior Stan
ford defense won out over a
determined Cal team and the
Tribe posted a 6-0 victory on the
Stanford field. Gordon Waddell
scored the first try from 10 yards
out after Glenn Myers had set
the play up with a fine run. Beau
Bianchi iced it by blocking a Cal
kick, picking up the ball, and
scampering 10 yards for a score.
AT MONTEREY, the Indians
made the tournament officials
(who picked the Kats Club of
British Columbia as the favorite)
look like idiots by successively
beating Oregon State, 14-0, Uni
versities Club of L.A., 9-0, USC,
13-0, and chasing the Kats back
to B.C. with a 22-0 licking.
Coach Pete Kmetovich had
special praise for the play of
Waddell, Keith Richmond, and
Steve Vannort in the tournament.
Waddell, who wound up as the
team’s high scorer with 25 points
for the year, played his best rug
by in the tournament. Both he
and Richmond were mainstays in
the Card backfield, with their
kicking and passing helping as
much as their scoring.

Vannort made a nuisance of
himself against USC. He ran into,
over, around, and through the
hapless Trojans all afternoon and
scored the winning goal, too,
KMETOVIC’ named break
aways Frank Patitucci and Tim
Hansel as outstanding defense
men, and praised 260-pound Dick
Leeuwenherg for his work on
line-out plays. He was also
pleased with the play of fullback
Dick Ragsdale and Bob Burke.
Ragsdale scored 15 points, de
spite not turning out until the
fifth game, while Burke was
third highest scorer, with 22
points.
However, all these satisfactions
are surpassed by the fact that
virtually the entire team will be
returning next year. Most of the
seniors will still be around in
graduate school, and since there
is no limit whatsoever on the
number of seasons a student can
play, they'll still be able to par
ticipate.
The JV rugby team finished its
season with a 6-4 record, with
most of its losses close ones.
