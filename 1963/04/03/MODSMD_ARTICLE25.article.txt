United Press International
ATLANTA (UPI) Attorney
General Eugene Cook said yester
day that former University of
Georgia Athletic Director Wallace
Butts divulged vital team secrets
and was in contact with known
gamblers prior to the 1962 Geor
gia-Alabama football game.
In a report on a two-week in
vestigation to Gov. Carl Sanders
into an alleged Southeastern Con
ference football scandal, Cook dis
closed that the one-time famous
football mentor had amassed a
net fortune of approximately
$206,000. His salary w r as $16,000
a year'.
Butts’ resignation from Geor
gia, where he had coached or di
rected athletics for 25 years, was
summarily accepted Feb. 28, less
than a month before a magazine
article accused him of telephon
ing football information to Ala
bama coach Paul (Bear) Bryant
just before the two teams clashed
in Birmingham last Sept. 22.
Sanders told a news conference
following his public release of
Cook’s report that there was in
the investigation so far “nothing
to indicate the violation of any
criminal statute” by Butts.
