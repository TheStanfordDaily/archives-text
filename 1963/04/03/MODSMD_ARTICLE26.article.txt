NEW YORK Years ago, be
for 1 that sad day when, as Jim j
Murray puts it, Walter O’Malley
traded the Brooklyn Dodgers for
downtown Los Angeles, a rcsi-1
dent of Flatbush delivered the;
classic analysis of why the
Dodgers had just won a National I
League pennant.
“God,” said the citizen, "was
on our side.”
The influence of religion on the
sporting world has perhaps been i
too long ignored but the issue I
was raised with compelling force
at Madison Square Garden on
March 13 which for the first
time since Jake La Motta defend
ed his title 13 years ago, was sold
out for a boxing match.
The main event featured Cas
sius Clay, the number two con
tender for Sonny Liston’s heavy
weight title, and Doug Jones,
ranked number three. Clay’s last
victory in these parts was over
Anthony Quinn in "Requiem for
a Heavyweight.”
But interest was aroused by a
preliminary fight in which a j
large blond boy appeared clad j
in black trunks with a white' star
of David embroidered on the left |
leg. This devout fighter was up
against a large Negro whose,
size and power were handicapped j
by a notable lack of speed. The 1
blond boy had very quick handsj
and his left in particular spent i
most of the fight in his oppo- 1
nent’s face. At the end of the j
four rounds the bigger fighter’s i
eyes were both nearly closed and !
the defender of the faith was)
given an overwhelming decision. 1
Patterson Debuts
The next prelim marked the j
professional debut of Ray Pat-;
terson, Floyd’s younger brother,
who needs only about 10 pounds i
to resemble the ex-champion al- 1
most exactly. After Roy returned j
to corner upon receiving his in- j
structions from the referee, he
was stripped of his silk robe and
the warning buzzer sounded. Roy
made a discernible sign of the
cross and went out to do battle.
An irrisistible feeling of deja
vu then presented itself, for not
only did Roy look like Floyd, he |
fought exactly like him. There
was tlie peek-a-boo crouch, gloves
converged on his cheeks and arms
extended outward, parallel to the
floor. And there were the leap
ing, free-swinging punches de
signed as much to push the op
ponent to the canvas as to knock
him there. In the second round
Roy swarmed on his combatant,
forced him to the ropes and
knocked him down. The floored
man got up and was attacked
similarly and with the same re
sult. Once more and the referee
ended the fight and that was the
end of religion for the night.
The lights in the Garden went
out and a spotlight found Doug
Jones wending his way through
Ihe crowd to the ring. He was a
17-5 underdog but very popular
in New York and many residents
of Harlem had come to see their
neighbor fight. The spot switched
to the other side of the ring and

1 Cassius Marcellus Clay did a
high-stepping dance up the aisle
and into the ring. The crowd
I roared with laughter.

Champs on Hand
I At most non-championship j
I fights the boxers in the audience)
I who are called into the ring to |
wish the participants well are of
j the “up and coming young welter- i
j weight from the Bronx' variety.
| But at this fight the crowd saw I
’ nothing hut ex-champions,
i Jack Dempsey and Gene Tun
ney, Rocky Graziano and Barney |
Ross were on hand. But the big
pre-battle show came from Sugar
Ray Robinson. Well over 10 and
the veteran of about 150 fights,
1 Robinson is a marvel. He wore a |
[ brown and white striped sport!
jacket and sported a wisp of hair j
about both his upper 1 and lower!
lip. He’s unmarked and scarless j
and looks as if he’s spent the last [
20 years following golf balls)
around Bermuda country club j
courses rather than playing top ;
gun in town, the one all the am
bitious kids tried to murder.
Robinson shook hands with !
Jones first, then walked over to
Clay’s corner. Cassius, ever and |
ever the showman, folded his j
i arms in front of him and bowed j
j from the waist. When Robinson j
i made to leave the ring Clay held
| Ihe top rope up for 1 him. These;
j were magnificent gestures and
; showed that the brash 21-year-old
; from Louisville has idols other
j than himself. Cassius should only
| end up half the fighter Robinson
once was and should only look j
like Sugar after 150 fights.
Fight Starts Slowly
! The fight started slowly with j
! both fighters giving as good as 1
1 they got, Jones weighed 14 ;
| pounds less than Clay who also
I had the advantage of longer
I reach. But Jones landed a few
| good punches and if there was |
j any doubt who the crowd was}
(for, those ended it. With every i
| connection by Jones the audience i
i roared its approval while Clay’s 1
; hits went unnoticed,
j Clay spent much of his time;
hacking away and never hit |
Jones particularly hard in the i
early going. Jones landed a few ,
good ones but nothing conclusive, j
Then came the fourth and the 1
crowd began to yell. Nobody in
the Garden was ignorant of |
I Clay’s prediction that he’d knock
Jones out in the fourth. Original
ly, Clay had said, "If Jones wants i
to mix, he’ll fall in six." But a
heckler from Jones’s camp i
bothered the as yet unbeaten poet )
while he was working out and he ;
revised his pick downward.
Cassius Weak
But Cassius seemed unwilling j
to deliver. The fourth was as
weak a round for him as any in
the fight and at no time did he
throw a punch that could have
knocked out Chubby Checker.
Jones won the round on the cards
of both judges and the referee.
With the end of the round the
crowd became more and more
sure that Jones was winning and
this opinion persisted.
In the last round Clay showed
something of what may make
him a good fighter. For the first
time he became the aggressor,
punching as he moved in towards

Jones rather than while stepping
away from him. For just a mo
ment it looked as if he might
flatten Doug after all, but Clay
backed off after a few good ex
changes and Jones never really
did get in trouble. The bell
sounded and the audience roared
in expectation of an upset.
The announcer stepped into the
ring, grabbed the mike above him
and said, “The judges score it
five-four-and one oven ...”
There was a sharp moan from
the audience as if to say, "So
close? Jones beat him better than
that."
"... for Cassius Clay," fin
ished the announcer.
“Fix, Fix, Fix"
The crowd screamed. Half the
fans were on their feet booing.
The announcer said the referee
had voted 8-1-1 for Clay but no
body heard him. A chant went up.
“Fix, fix, fix,” and the booing
continued. The announcer raised
Clay’s hand and the booing got
louder. The chant continued and
people started throwing things.
Boxes, cigarette packs and drink
ing cups flow into the ring. An
open' switchblade fell near the
platform.
The announcer said something
to Jones and he walked around
the ring making gestures of con
ciliation with his arms, The boo
ing got louder. Clay made a few
halfhearted motions of disgust at
the audience and left the ring.
Jones stood there alone, an arm
upraised as if he had won. It was
a great moment for him. The
crowd cheered and finally began
to move toward the exits.
Before the fight Clay had de
livered this mastepriece:
I'll hit Liston like a piston
He won’t stand a chance.
One shot with the fist 'n
I’ll be heading for the dance.
After 1 the fight the heavyweight
champion of the world said, “I’ll
get locked up for murder if ye’re
ever matched.”
Said yon Cassius: "No more
predictions. They create too much
pressure.”

heckler from Jones’s camp i
bothered the as yet unbeaten poet )
while he was working out and he ;
revised his pick downward.
Cassius Weak
But Cassius seemed unwilling j
to deliver. The fourth was as
weak a round for him as any in
the fight and at no time did he
throw a punch that could have
knocked out Chubby Checker.
Jones won the round on the cards
of both judges and the referee.
With the end of the round the
crowd became more and more
sure that Jones was winning and
this opinion persisted.
In the last round Clay showed
something of what may make
him a good fighter. For the first
time he became the aggressor,
punching as he moved in towards

Jones rather than while stepping
away from him. For just a mo
ment it looked as if he might
flatten Doug after all, but Clay
backed off after a few good ex
changes and Jones never really
did get in trouble. The bell
sounded and the audience roared
in expectation of an upset.
The announcer stepped into the
ring, grabbed the mike above him
and said, “The judges score it
five-four-and one oven ...”
There was a sharp moan from
the audience as if to say, "So
close? Jones beat him better than
that."
"... for Cassius Clay," fin
ished the announcer.
“Fix, Fix, Fix"
The crowd screamed. Half the
fans were on their feet booing.
The announcer said the referee
had voted 8-1-1 for Clay but no
body heard him. A chant went up.
“Fix, fix, fix,” and the booing
continued. The announcer raised
Clay’s hand and the booing got
louder. The chant continued and
people started throwing things.
Boxes, cigarette packs and drink
ing cups flow into the ring. An
open' switchblade fell near the
platform.
The announcer said something
to Jones and he walked around
the ring making gestures of con
ciliation with his arms, The boo
ing got louder. Clay made a few
halfhearted motions of disgust at
the audience and left the ring.
Jones stood there alone, an arm
upraised as if he had won. It was
a great moment for him. The
crowd cheered and finally began
to move toward the exits.
Before the fight Clay had de
livered this mastepriece:
I'll hit Liston like a piston

One shot with the fist 'n
I’ll be heading for the dance.
After 1 the fight the heavyweight

NEW YORK Years ago, be
for 1 that sad day when, as Jim j
Murray puts it, Walter O’Malley
traded the Brooklyn Dodgers for
downtown Los Angeles, a rcsi-1
dent of Flatbush delivered the;
classic analysis of why the
Dodgers had just won a National I
League pennant.
“God,” said the citizen, "was

The influence of religion on the
sporting world has perhaps been i
too long ignored but the issue I
was raised with compelling force
at Madison Square Garden on
March 13 which for the first
time since Jake La Motta defend
ed his title 13 years ago, was sold
out for a boxing match.
The main event featured Cas
sius Clay, the number two con
tender for Sonny Liston’s heavy
weight title, and Doug Jones,
ranked number three. Clay’s last
victory in these parts was over
Anthony Quinn in "Requiem for
a Heavyweight.”
But interest was aroused by a
preliminary fight in which a j
large blond boy appeared clad j
in black trunks with a white' star
of David embroidered on the left |
leg. This devout fighter was up
against a large Negro whose,
size and power were handicapped j
by a notable lack of speed. The 1
blond boy had very quick handsj
and his left in particular spent i
most of the fight in his oppo- 1
nent’s face. At the end of the j
four rounds the bigger fighter’s i
eyes were both nearly closed and !
the defender of the faith was)
given an overwhelming decision. 1
Patterson Debuts
The next prelim marked the j
professional debut of Ray Pat-;
terson, Floyd’s younger brother,
who needs only about 10 pounds i
to resemble the ex-champion al- 1
most exactly. After Roy returned j
to corner upon receiving his in- j
structions from the referee, he
was stripped of his silk robe and
the warning buzzer sounded. Roy
made a discernible sign of the
cross and went out to do battle.
An irrisistible feeling of deja
vu then presented itself, for not
only did Roy look like Floyd, he |
fought exactly like him. There
was tlie peek-a-boo crouch, gloves
converged on his cheeks and arms
extended outward, parallel to the
floor. And there were the leap
ing, free-swinging punches de
signed as much to push the op
ponent to the canvas as to knock
him there. In the second round
Roy swarmed on his combatant,
forced him to the ropes and
knocked him down. The floored
man got up and was attacked
similarly and with the same re
sult. Once more and the referee
ended the fight and that was the
end of religion for the night.
The lights in the Garden went
out and a spotlight found Doug
Jones wending his way through
Ihe crowd to the ring. He was a
17-5 underdog but very popular
in New York and many residents
of Harlem had come to see their
neighbor fight. The spot switched
to the other side of the ring and

1 Cassius Marcellus Clay did a
high-stepping dance up the aisle
and into the ring. The crowd
I roared with laughter.

Champs on Hand
I At most non-championship j

| But at this fight the crowd saw I
’ nothing hut ex-champions,
i Jack Dempsey and Gene Tun
ney, Rocky Graziano and Barney |
Ross were on hand. But the big
pre-battle show came from Sugar
Ray Robinson. Well over 10 and
the veteran of about 150 fights,
1 Robinson is a marvel. He wore a |
[ brown and white striped sport!
jacket and sported a wisp of hair j
about both his upper 1 and lower!
lip. He’s unmarked and scarless j
and looks as if he’s spent the last [
20 years following golf balls)
around Bermuda country club j
courses rather than playing top ;
gun in town, the one all the am
bitious kids tried to murder.
Robinson shook hands with !
Jones first, then walked over to
Clay’s corner. Cassius, ever and |
ever the showman, folded his j
i arms in front of him and bowed j
j from the waist. When Robinson j
i made to leave the ring Clay held
| Ihe top rope up for 1 him. These;
j were magnificent gestures and
; showed that the brash 21-year-old
; from Louisville has idols other
j than himself. Cassius should only
| end up half the fighter Robinson
once was and should only look j
like Sugar after 150 fights.
Fight Starts Slowly
! The fight started slowly with j
! both fighters giving as good as 1

j Clay spent much of his time;

early going. Jones landed a few ,
good ones but nothing conclusive, j

Jones out in the fourth. Original

1 Cassius Marcellus Clay did a
high-stepping dance up the aisle
and into the ring. The crowd
I roared with laughter.

I At most non-championship j
I fights the boxers in the audience)
I who are called into the ring to |

j the “up and coming young welter- i
j weight from the Bronx' variety.
| But at this fight the crowd saw I
’ nothing hut ex-champions,
i Jack Dempsey and Gene Tun
ney, Rocky Graziano and Barney |
Ross were on hand. But the big
pre-battle show came from Sugar
Ray Robinson. Well over 10 and
the veteran of about 150 fights,
1 Robinson is a marvel. He wore a |
[ brown and white striped sport!
jacket and sported a wisp of hair j
about both his upper 1 and lower!
lip. He’s unmarked and scarless j
and looks as if he’s spent the last [
20 years following golf balls)
around Bermuda country club j
courses rather than playing top ;
gun in town, the one all the am
bitious kids tried to murder.
Robinson shook hands with !
Jones first, then walked over to
Clay’s corner. Cassius, ever and |
ever the showman, folded his j
i arms in front of him and bowed j
j from the waist. When Robinson j
i made to leave the ring Clay held
| Ihe top rope up for 1 him. These;
j were magnificent gestures and
; showed that the brash 21-year-old
; from Louisville has idols other
j than himself. Cassius should only
| end up half the fighter Robinson
once was and should only look j
like Sugar after 150 fights.
Fight Starts Slowly
! The fight started slowly with j
! both fighters giving as good as 1
1 they got, Jones weighed 14 ;
| pounds less than Clay who also
I had the advantage of longer
I reach. But Jones landed a few
| good punches and if there was |

(for, those ended it. With every i

i roared its approval while Clay’s 1
; hits went unnoticed,
j Clay spent much of his time;
hacking away and never hit |
Jones particularly hard in the i
early going. Jones landed a few ,
good ones but nothing conclusive, j
Then came the fourth and the 1
crowd began to yell. Nobody in
the Garden was ignorant of |
I Clay’s prediction that he’d knock
Jones out in the fourth. Original
ly, Clay had said, "If Jones wants i
to mix, he’ll fall in six." But a
heckler from Jones’s camp i
bothered the as yet unbeaten poet )
while he was working out and he ;
revised his pick downward.
Cassius Weak
But Cassius seemed unwilling j
to deliver. The fourth was as
weak a round for him as any in
the fight and at no time did he
throw a punch that could have
knocked out Chubby Checker.
Jones won the round on the cards
of both judges and the referee.
With the end of the round the
crowd became more and more
sure that Jones was winning and
this opinion persisted.
In the last round Clay showed
something of what may make
him a good fighter. For the first
time he became the aggressor,
punching as he moved in towards

Jones rather than while stepping
away from him. For just a mo
ment it looked as if he might
flatten Doug after all, but Clay
backed off after a few good ex
changes and Jones never really
did get in trouble. The bell
sounded and the audience roared
in expectation of an upset.
The announcer stepped into the
ring, grabbed the mike above him
and said, “The judges score it
five-four-and one oven ...”
There was a sharp moan from
the audience as if to say, "So
close? Jones beat him better than
that."
"... for Cassius Clay," fin
ished the announcer.
“Fix, Fix, Fix"
The crowd screamed. Half the
fans were on their feet booing.
The announcer said the referee
had voted 8-1-1 for Clay but no
body heard him. A chant went up.
“Fix, fix, fix,” and the booing
continued. The announcer raised
Clay’s hand and the booing got
louder. The chant continued and
people started throwing things.
Boxes, cigarette packs and drink
ing cups flow into the ring. An
open' switchblade fell near the
platform.
The announcer said something
to Jones and he walked around
the ring making gestures of con
ciliation with his arms, The boo
ing got louder. Clay made a few
halfhearted motions of disgust at
the audience and left the ring.
Jones stood there alone, an arm
upraised as if he had won. It was
a great moment for him. The
crowd cheered and finally began
to move toward the exits.
Before the fight Clay had de
livered this mastepriece:
I'll hit Liston like a piston

After 1 the fight the heavyweight

NEW YORK Years ago, be
for 1 that sad day when, as Jim j
Murray puts it, Walter O’Malley
traded the Brooklyn Dodgers for
downtown Los Angeles, a rcsi-1
dent of Flatbush delivered the;
classic analysis of why the
Dodgers had just won a National I
League pennant.
“God,” said the citizen, "was
on our side.”
The influence of religion on the
sporting world has perhaps been i
too long ignored but the issue I
was raised with compelling force
at Madison Square Garden on
March 13 which for the first
time since Jake La Motta defend
ed his title 13 years ago, was sold
out for a boxing match.
The main event featured Cas
sius Clay, the number two con
tender for Sonny Liston’s heavy
weight title, and Doug Jones,
ranked number three. Clay’s last
victory in these parts was over
Anthony Quinn in "Requiem for
a Heavyweight.”
But interest was aroused by a
preliminary fight in which a j
large blond boy appeared clad j
in black trunks with a white' star
of David embroidered on the left |
leg. This devout fighter was up
against a large Negro whose,
size and power were handicapped j
by a notable lack of speed. The 1
blond boy had very quick handsj
and his left in particular spent i
most of the fight in his oppo- 1
nent’s face. At the end of the j
four rounds the bigger fighter’s i
eyes were both nearly closed and !
the defender of the faith was)
given an overwhelming decision. 1
Patterson Debuts
The next prelim marked the j
professional debut of Ray Pat-;
terson, Floyd’s younger brother,
who needs only about 10 pounds i
to resemble the ex-champion al- 1
most exactly. After Roy returned j
to corner upon receiving his in- j
structions from the referee, he
was stripped of his silk robe and
the warning buzzer sounded. Roy
made a discernible sign of the
cross and went out to do battle.
An irrisistible feeling of deja
vu then presented itself, for not
only did Roy look like Floyd, he |
fought exactly like him. There
was tlie peek-a-boo crouch, gloves
converged on his cheeks and arms
extended outward, parallel to the
floor. And there were the leap
ing, free-swinging punches de
signed as much to push the op
ponent to the canvas as to knock
him there. In the second round
Roy swarmed on his combatant,
forced him to the ropes and
knocked him down. The floored
man got up and was attacked
similarly and with the same re
sult. Once more and the referee
ended the fight and that was the
end of religion for the night.
The lights in the Garden went
out and a spotlight found Doug
Jones wending his way through
Ihe crowd to the ring. He was a
17-5 underdog but very popular
in New York and many residents
of Harlem had come to see their
neighbor fight. The spot switched

sporting world has perhaps been i
too long ignored but the issue I
was raised with compelling force
at Madison Square Garden on
March 13 which for the first
time since Jake La Motta defend
ed his title 13 years ago, was sold
out for a boxing match.
The main event featured Cas
sius Clay, the number two con
tender for Sonny Liston’s heavy
weight title, and Doug Jones,
ranked number three. Clay’s last
victory in these parts was over
Anthony Quinn in "Requiem for
a Heavyweight.”
But interest was aroused by a
preliminary fight in which a j
large blond boy appeared clad j
in black trunks with a white' star
of David embroidered on the left |
leg. This devout fighter was up
against a large Negro whose,
size and power were handicapped j
by a notable lack of speed. The 1
blond boy had very quick handsj
and his left in particular spent i
most of the fight in his oppo- 1
nent’s face. At the end of the j
four rounds the bigger fighter’s i
eyes were both nearly closed and !
the defender of the faith was)
given an overwhelming decision. 1
Patterson Debuts
The next prelim marked the j
professional debut of Ray Pat-;
terson, Floyd’s younger brother,
who needs only about 10 pounds i
to resemble the ex-champion al- 1
most exactly. After Roy returned j
to corner upon receiving his in- j
structions from the referee, he
was stripped of his silk robe and
the warning buzzer sounded. Roy
made a discernible sign of the
cross and went out to do battle.
An irrisistible feeling of deja
vu then presented itself, for not
only did Roy look like Floyd, he |
fought exactly like him. There
was tlie peek-a-boo crouch, gloves
converged on his cheeks and arms
extended outward, parallel to the
floor. And there were the leap
ing, free-swinging punches de
signed as much to push the op
ponent to the canvas as to knock
him there. In the second round
Roy swarmed on his combatant,
forced him to the ropes and
knocked him down. The floored
man got up and was attacked
similarly and with the same re
sult. Once more and the referee
ended the fight and that was the
end of religion for the night.
The lights in the Garden went
out and a spotlight found Doug
Jones wending his way through
Ihe crowd to the ring. He was a
17-5 underdog but very popular
in New York and many residents
of Harlem had come to see their
neighbor fight. The spot switched
to the other side of the ring and

1 Cassius Marcellus Clay did a
high-stepping dance up the aisle
and into the ring. The crowd
I roared with laughter.

Champs on Hand
I At most non-championship j
I fights the boxers in the audience)
I who are called into the ring to |
wish the participants well are of
j the “up and coming young welter- i
j weight from the Bronx' variety.
| But at this fight the crowd saw I
’ nothing hut ex-champions,
i Jack Dempsey and Gene Tun
ney, Rocky Graziano and Barney |
Ross were on hand. But the big
pre-battle show came from Sugar
Ray Robinson. Well over 10 and
the veteran of about 150 fights,
1 Robinson is a marvel. He wore a |
[ brown and white striped sport!
jacket and sported a wisp of hair j
about both his upper 1 and lower!
lip. He’s unmarked and scarless j
and looks as if he’s spent the last [
20 years following golf balls)
around Bermuda country club j
courses rather than playing top ;
gun in town, the one all the am
bitious kids tried to murder.
Robinson shook hands with !
Jones first, then walked over to
Clay’s corner. Cassius, ever and |
ever the showman, folded his j
i arms in front of him and bowed j
j from the waist. When Robinson j
i made to leave the ring Clay held
| Ihe top rope up for 1 him. These;
j were magnificent gestures and
; showed that the brash 21-year-old
; from Louisville has idols other
j than himself. Cassius should only
| end up half the fighter Robinson
once was and should only look j
like Sugar after 150 fights.
Fight Starts Slowly
! The fight started slowly with j
! both fighters giving as good as 1
1 they got, Jones weighed 14 ;
| pounds less than Clay who also
I had the advantage of longer
I reach. But Jones landed a few
| good punches and if there was |

(for, those ended it. With every i

i roared its approval while Clay’s 1
; hits went unnoticed,
j Clay spent much of his time;
hacking away and never hit |
Jones particularly hard in the i
early going. Jones landed a few ,
good ones but nothing conclusive, j
Then came the fourth and the 1
crowd began to yell. Nobody in
the Garden was ignorant of |
I Clay’s prediction that he’d knock
Jones out in the fourth. Original
ly, Clay had said, "If Jones wants i
to mix, he’ll fall in six." But a
heckler from Jones’s camp i
bothered the as yet unbeaten poet )
while he was working out and he ;
revised his pick downward.
Cassius Weak
But Cassius seemed unwilling j
to deliver. The fourth was as
weak a round for him as any in
the fight and at no time did he
throw a punch that could have
knocked out Chubby Checker.
Jones won the round on the cards
of both judges and the referee.
With the end of the round the
crowd became more and more
sure that Jones was winning and
this opinion persisted.
In the last round Clay showed
something of what may make
him a good fighter. For the first
time he became the aggressor,
punching as he moved in towards

Jones rather than while stepping
away from him. For just a mo
ment it looked as if he might
flatten Doug after all, but Clay
backed off after a few good ex
changes and Jones never really
did get in trouble. The bell
sounded and the audience roared
in expectation of an upset.
The announcer stepped into the
ring, grabbed the mike above him
and said, “The judges score it
five-four-and one oven ...”
There was a sharp moan from
the audience as if to say, "So
close? Jones beat him better than
that."
"... for Cassius Clay," fin
ished the announcer.
“Fix, Fix, Fix"
The crowd screamed. Half the
fans were on their feet booing.
The announcer said the referee
had voted 8-1-1 for Clay but no
body heard him. A chant went up.
“Fix, fix, fix,” and the booing
continued. The announcer raised
Clay’s hand and the booing got
louder. The chant continued and
people started throwing things.
Boxes, cigarette packs and drink
ing cups flow into the ring. An
open' switchblade fell near the
platform.
The announcer said something
to Jones and he walked around
the ring making gestures of con
ciliation with his arms, The boo
ing got louder. Clay made a few
halfhearted motions of disgust at
the audience and left the ring.
Jones stood there alone, an arm
upraised as if he had won. It was
a great moment for him. The
crowd cheered and finally began
to move toward the exits.
Before the fight Clay had de
livered this mastepriece:
I'll hit Liston like a piston
He won’t stand a chance.
One shot with the fist 'n
I’ll be heading for the dance.
After 1 the fight the heavyweight
champion of the world said, “I’ll
get locked up for murder if ye’re
ever matched.”
Said yon Cassius: "No more
predictions. They create too much
pressure.”

him a good fighter. For the first
time he became the aggressor,
punching as he moved in towards

Jones rather than while stepping
away from him. For just a mo
ment it looked as if he might
flatten Doug after all, but Clay
backed off after a few good ex
changes and Jones never really
did get in trouble. The bell
sounded and the audience roared
in expectation of an upset.
The announcer stepped into the
ring, grabbed the mike above him
and said, “The judges score it
five-four-and one oven ...”
There was a sharp moan from
the audience as if to say, "So
close? Jones beat him better than
that."
"... for Cassius Clay," fin
ished the announcer.
“Fix, Fix, Fix"
The crowd screamed. Half the
fans were on their feet booing.
The announcer said the referee
had voted 8-1-1 for Clay but no
body heard him. A chant went up.
“Fix, fix, fix,” and the booing
continued. The announcer raised
Clay’s hand and the booing got
louder. The chant continued and
people started throwing things.
Boxes, cigarette packs and drink
ing cups flow into the ring. An
open' switchblade fell near the
platform.
The announcer said something
to Jones and he walked around
the ring making gestures of con
ciliation with his arms, The boo
ing got louder. Clay made a few
halfhearted motions of disgust at
the audience and left the ring.
Jones stood there alone, an arm
upraised as if he had won. It was
a great moment for him. The
crowd cheered and finally began
to move toward the exits.
Before the fight Clay had de
livered this mastepriece:
I'll hit Liston like a piston
He won’t stand a chance.
One shot with the fist 'n
I’ll be heading for the dance.
After 1 the fight the heavyweight
champion of the world said, “I’ll
get locked up for murder if ye’re
ever matched.”
Said yon Cassius: "No more
predictions. They create too much
pressure.”
