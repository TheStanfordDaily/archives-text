# Kovacevich Hurls Two-Hitter, Drives in Two Runs as Cards Dump UOP, 11-0
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford squashed a complete
ly outclassed University of Pa
cific nine 11-0 yesterday on the
Sunken Diamond.
The Indians were led by pitcher
Dick Kovacevich, who stopped
the Tigers on two hits in the
seven innings he pitched, and
cracked out three hits in three at
bats, driving in two runs and also
scoring a pair.
UOP DIDN’T get a solid hit
until the sixth inning, when Ti
ger first baseman Eric Jacobs
rapped a line drive past Indian
first sacker Bob Hollman. The
other Tiger safety was an infield
cheapie right up the middle that
Card shortstop Joel Shulman
couldn’t quite make a play on.
The game opened inauspicious
ly for Stanford when UOP got
the bases loaded on three errors
in the first inning, Kovacevich
induced a grounder that the Card
infield could make a play on, and
the force-out retired the side.
Stanford got down to the seri
ous business of getting enough
runs to give Kovacevich a safe
lead. The one run Stanford got in
the first inning was enough. Card
leadoff batter Shulman drilled a
liner over the Tiger centerfield

| er’s head, and marie it around the
I bases without a throw as the
b;* 11 rolled well over 500 feet.
■ THE INDIANS got two more
I runs in the second off Tiger ace
Bob Marconi. George Thacher
opened the inning with a single,
and with one out Kovacevich
batted him to third. A wiki pitch
sent Thacher across, and it ad
vanced Dave Stout to second.
[ Stanford put the tilt out of
j reach with a six-run outburst
i against reliefer Jack Reed in the
third inning. The big blow was a
two-run single by Kovacevich.
Bobby Cox and Greg Post also
I drilled run-scoring base hits,
j Post got two hits in the entire
J game and stole four bases.
THE SCORING was capped by
i Stanford’s two-run seventh. Stout
I singled in one run and Hollmann
doubled across another.
Warren Newell pitched the last
two innings against the Tigers
and allowed not a hit.
