MOSCOW—The Soviet Union yesterday launched a I’i-ton un
manned space ship toward the moon and hinted it may land a robot
station in preparation for manned flights. The Lunik-IV moonship,

journey to the moon's vicinity to gather scientific data.
The announcement coincided with Soviet predictions that a
manned flight to the moon now is highly probable and a suggestion
that scientists may make the trip with cosmonauts when a landing
is feasible.

rebels still held a few isolated positions and control of the fleet but
the immediate threat to President Jose M. Guido’s regime was sharp
ly reduced.
