# Chappie Attacks Rushing Procedure
## 
### ELLINGTON K. FARTHINGALE 
Cleanliness is back! Tell your
neighbor!
Yep, kiddies, your favorite col
lege humor magazine, Stanford's
ever-present cesspool of under
graduate funnies, the “Chapar

ral,” is horn again with a whole
issue dedicated to cleanliness. No
dirty pictures, no dirty stories,
only a few dirty jokes.
Just the Chappie’s usual cru
sade against everything in par
ticular.
THIS ISSUE the Old Boy and
his myrmidons level their editor
ial cannon at that veritable Stan
ford tradition, rush, with stray
shots here and there at The Daily,
Sequoia, Stanford women, Liz
Taylor, and decency. But the body
of the mag is filled up with a
series of articles describing the
rigors involved in the rushing pro
cedure.
First and foremost is a crack
at (hoh-heht women’s living
groups in the approximate form
of a fumetti. The picture story,
called “The Case Against Euglena
Haydork,’’ has certain unbearable
subtle middletones of depravity
which come the closest to the
mag's accustomed filth. Technical
ly, the story is unconvincing and
the photos amateurish. In one
scene the caption says the hero
ine’s left, hand is being removed
while in the picture an unidenti
fied assailant hacks away at her
right hand with the back of a
knife. Really, boys . . .
KKAI) EFRON'S treatment of
(this'll kill you, guys I “The Foetal
Development of a Fraterity
Man” is more polished, and fol
lows in the “Chappie’’ tradition
of what sounds like the proverbial
sour grapes. Biology 3 students

may find it more interesting than
labs.
Stern Hall receives the usual
treatment in a piece called
“Through a Glass Obliquely," in
which an unconvincing character
is taken through the home of In
dependent Living, and repulsed
by the (chortie-chortie) charac
ters imprisoned there. The thing
is so malicious it somehow fails
to be funny.
The Eating Clubs get the last
of the barrage in an item dealing
with (get this one) El Goble, an
institution dedicated to the propo
sition that “people eat.” Appar
ently the worst (or best i the
wdiole sick crow' can find to say
about the clubs is that they “offer
all the advantages of a fraternity
with none of the disadvantages.”
IN ADDITION to the feature
stories are the usual warmed
over jokes which, if you haven’t
heard them before, are humorous.
Most of them aren’t gross enough
to extract a gasp from the dean
of women. On the whole, the
cartoons remain the only feature
of the magazine which provide
some measure of heart warming
chuckles but don’t worry, you
can always say your stomach’s
rumbling.
In summing up, the n, the
“Chappie” levels its sophomoric
artillery at a number of Stanford
institutions aiming, perhaps, for
the head and hitting, usually, be
low the belt.
Oh for the days of that good
I old unvindictive smut.

sade against everything in par
ticular.
THIS ISSUE the Old Boy and
his myrmidons level their editor
ial cannon at that veritable Stan
ford tradition, rush, with stray
shots here and there at The Daily,
Sequoia, Stanford women, Liz
Taylor, and decency. But the body
of the mag is filled up with a
series of articles describing the
rigors involved in the rushing pro
cedure.
First and foremost is a crack
at (hoh-heht women’s living
groups in the approximate form
of a fumetti. The picture story,
called “The Case Against Euglena
Haydork,’’ has certain unbearable
subtle middletones of depravity
which come the closest to the
mag's accustomed filth. Technical
ly, the story is unconvincing and
the photos amateurish. In one
scene the caption says the hero
ine’s left, hand is being removed
while in the picture an unidenti
fied assailant hacks away at her
right hand with the back of a
knife. Really, boys . . .
KKAI) EFRON'S treatment of
(this'll kill you, guys I “The Foetal
Development of a Fraterity
Man” is more polished, and fol
lows in the “Chappie’’ tradition
of what sounds like the proverbial
sour grapes. Biology 3 students

may find it more interesting than
labs.
Stern Hall receives the usual
treatment in a piece called
“Through a Glass Obliquely," in
which an unconvincing character
is taken through the home of In
dependent Living, and repulsed
by the (chortie-chortie) charac
ters imprisoned there. The thing
is so malicious it somehow fails
to be funny.
The Eating Clubs get the last
of the barrage in an item dealing
with (get this one) El Goble, an
institution dedicated to the propo
sition that “people eat.” Appar
ently the worst (or best i the
wdiole sick crow' can find to say
about the clubs is that they “offer
all the advantages of a fraternity
with none of the disadvantages.”
IN ADDITION to the feature
stories are the usual warmed
over jokes which, if you haven’t
heard them before, are humorous.
Most of them aren’t gross enough
to extract a gasp from the dean
of women. On the whole, the
cartoons remain the only feature
of the magazine which provide
some measure of heart warming
chuckles but don’t worry, you
can always say your stomach’s
rumbling.
In summing up, the n, the
“Chappie” levels its sophomoric
artillery at a number of Stanford
institutions aiming, perhaps, for
the head and hitting, usually, be
low the belt.
Oh for the days of that good
I old unvindictive smut.
Cleanliness is back! Tell your
neighbor!
Yep, kiddies, your favorite col
lege humor magazine, Stanford's
ever-present cesspool of under
graduate funnies, the “Chapar

ral,” is horn again with a whole
issue dedicated to cleanliness. No
dirty pictures, no dirty stories,
only a few dirty jokes.
Just the Chappie’s usual cru
sade against everything in par
