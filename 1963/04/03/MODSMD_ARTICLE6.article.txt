# Birch Society Will Intensify Its Campaign
## 
### RICHARD WEINIG Contributing Editor 
The John Birch Society is about
to embark upon an intensive
campaign to increase its mem
bership and further expand its
programs of political education
throughout California.
This fact was disclosed by ox-
Congressman John Russelot, the
Birch Society’s western coordi
nator at a press conference at
the Hilton Inn on March 16.
According to Rousselot, the
Society’s principal objective is
to encourage its members to in
form themselves of current po
litical issues; to formulate their
own opinions; and then to work
actively in the party of their
choice to implement these beliefs.
In a word, the Birch Society ex
ists to “encourage our members
to be active citizens.”
THK SOCIETY seems predomi
nately concerned with two issues:
the dangers of communism; and
the internal threats to’a constitu
tional, republican form of govern
ment.
“With very few exceptions the
members of the John Birch Soci
ety are deeply religious people,”
said Rousselot. “We believe that
communism is as utterly incom
patible with all religion as it is
Contemptuous of all morality and
destructive of all freedom. It is
I intrinsically evil.” Therefore, “wo
intend to do our part to halt, rout,
|and eventually bury the whole
international communist conspir
acy.”
The Birch Society hopes to ef-
I feet this end, primarily, by in-
I forming its members of the ide
ology and strategy of commu
nism; and by suggesting ways in
which those policies might be
thwarted.
IN THIS REGARD, Rousselot
Indicated that the Birch Society
advocates an extensive congres
sional investigation of the State
Department to eliminate any in
competence or communist influ
ence which might bo found there
in. He suggested that if the State
| Department had nothing to hide,
| it had little to fear from such an
j investigation and should, indeed,
j welcome it.
In addition, the Birch Society
I encourages its members to speak
i out against importation of com
munist-made goods into this coun
try on the ground that sale of
such commodities both deprives
American workmen producing
similar products of their jobs
and supports “a State Depart
ment policy which we think is
very idiotic.”
However, Rousselot added that
no member of the Birch Society
may, without jeopardizing his
membership, engage in any ac
tivity which is illegal, discrimi
nates against any racial or re
ligious group, or “lacks dignity.”
In his words: “We believe that
the means are just as important
as the ends in any civilized soci
ety."
SECONDLY, THE Birch Soci
ety is concerned with a dual
threat to maintenance of the
United States as a republic of
! enumerated, constitutional pow
ers: increasing abdication of na
| tional sovereignty to the United
j Nations; and “collectivism as a
! political and economic system.”
| Rousselot deplored the degree to
: which the United Stales has sub-
I ordinated the conduct of its for
j eign relations to the edicts of the
j United Nations, even when the
j policies espoused by that body
j are unmistakably beneficial to
j the communists and inimical to
! preservation of the Free World.
He further expressed opposi
! tion to “collectivism,” whether
| it is called “socialism, or the wel
fare state, the New Deal, the Fair
Deal, or the New Frontier.” In
speaking for the Birch Society,
Rousselot added: “We believe
that increasing the size of govern
ment, increasing the centraliza
tion of government, and increas
ing the functions of government,
all act as brakes on material
prosperity and as destroyers of
personal freedom.”
Prior to his appointment as
western coordinator for the Birch
Society. Rousselot served as con
gressman from California's 25th
District from 1960 to 1962. He
was defeated in an attempt for
reelection in 1962, but received
45 per cent of the vote in a dis
trict with a 32 per cent Republi
can registration and outpolled
both Richard Nixon and Senator
Thomas Kuchel.
