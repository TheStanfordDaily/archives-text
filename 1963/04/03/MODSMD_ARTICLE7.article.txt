# Poll Union, Partisan Groups Changed by Trustee Decision
## 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
As a result of the new policy concerning the use of Stanford
campus facilities for partisan political activities, stated by the
Pros lees in their March meeting, the organization of partisan
groups of Stanford students will be considerably changed. Among
those affected by the policy statement are such groups as the
Political Union, the Youne Re--*- 1 ——

publicans, and the Young Demo
crats.
According to the Trustees’
statement, voluntary organiza
tions may use University facili
ties for pen meetings “only under
the sponsorship of the Political
Union and subject to the regula
tions of the Committee on Public
Exercises.” This will in effect
make the Political Union a regu
latory agent in a greater capacity
than previously.
ACCORDING TO Steven Cor
ker, vice-president of Political
Union, the situation before was
that any partisan group could
register with the Political Union
and become a caucus but could
not then be affiliated with an off
campus organization. In addition,
organizations not sponsored by
the Political Union or the UR
could not use campus facilities.
Now r , however, a political group
such as the Young Republicans
can meet on campus, but must
co-ordinate their activities
through the Political Union of
fice. They will be quite distinct
from the party caucuses already
existing; the Young Republicans
and the Republican caucus, for
example, often advocate different
programs and will probably still
remain separate under the new
policy.
The Political Union is in favor
of the policy change, according
to Corker, as it acknowledges the
right of the students to speak out
collectively on public issues. He
added that the new program
“calls for tremendous responsi
bility on the part of the students
in the way they handle them
selves; it puts us on the stage.
It is not a gift, and could as easily
be tken away.”
HOW MUCH authority the Po
litical Union will have over those
groups which choose to register
wdth it is not yet clearly under
stood. According to Scott Mc-
Bride, Business Manager of the
Political Union, the problem re
volves around registration.
Groups wishing to hold open cam
pus meetings must register with
the Political Union; once they
register they are affiliated. Their
purposes and procedures, accord
ing to the Trustees’ statement,
must be "not inconsistent with
the goals and standards of the
University.” Since this is hardly
an explicit standard of conduct, a
.judicial body might be necessary.
“The Political Union has never
been a ‘big brother’ to its cau
cuses, and won’t be to the Young
Republicans, Young Democrats,
etc., but if they do get out of line,
we will step in,” said Corker.
“Otherwise these groups will be
autonomous.” Political Union
officers are not certain how much
control their organization will
have.
The Political Union itself will
| have ot be reorganized. An exec
j utive board meeting will be held
j tomorrow at which some of the
| ambiguities will be discussed,
j such as the question of cqntrol
j and also the way in which fi
! nances of each group will be
I handled.
THE ADMINISTRATIVE staff
may be increased, said Corker,
but the same basic organization
j will probably be retained. All of
the by-laws will have to be re
written since they were set up to
follow the old policy. Corker sees
the present function of the Po
litical Union as a “co-ordinating
j body.”
The political groups are also
concerned about the amount of
control. A spokesman for the
| Stanford Area Young Democrats
I said that although it is a definite
j advantage to be allowed to use
j campus facilities, it is possible
j that their activities, especially
i those concerned with state or na
| tional politics, will be more re
| stricted. Speaking of the greater
j freedom of political expression
j allowed by the Trustees, he said
i “it will bo an advantage to stu
j dents not to take advantage of
, it,” since greater limitation might
j be imposed.
Barbara Westerlund, president
of the Stanford Area Young Re
publicans, stated that she felt
that the new policy would “add
greatly to the political maturity
of the campus,” but added that
it seemed that the Political Un
ion would not exercise a great
deal of control over them if they
registered.
