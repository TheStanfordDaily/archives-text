# Math Department Consolidated In Renovated 'Physics Corner'
## 
### SHEILA RICKETTS 
Construction of llu* new $2,300,0 CX) mathematics center in the
old “Physics Comer began Monday w hen contractors Wagner
and Martinez of San Francisco started the job of stripping the old
four-story building inside to its stone walls and fitting a new five
story building into the shell. With the completion of the center,

scheduled for late summer of
-1964, mathematics units which
are now scattered in six separate
locations on campus, will be con
solidated under one roof, except
for the Computation Center in
the Science Quad.
The plans for the now center
attempt to increase space, im
prove lighting and ventilation,
meet today’s building specifica
tions and accommodate essential
new equipment while preserving
the traditional appearance of the
Quad.
Architects Spencer and Lee of
San Francisco have included in
their design for the mathematics
center 1 quiet quarters for both

group and individual research.
THi; I.IBKAKV and reading
room will be on the top floor
with a small terrace roof adjoin
ing. A large lecture room and
other classrooms will be on the
lower floor.
Construction of the center is
being financed by a $1 million
grant from the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, by a government
grant of $250,000 from the Na
tional Science Foundation, and by
contributions from other private
donors.
The expanded facilities have
become necessary due to the
rapid growth of the Mathematics
Department which has approxi
mately quadrupled its graduates
in the past ten years.
THE BUILDINGS at “Physics
Corner,” vacated when the phys
ics department moved into the
new Varian Laboratory of Phys
ics, have been the site of many
important physics experiments.
It was in them that Russell Vari
an made the first Klystron tube
in 1937 and that Felix Bloch dis
covered nuclear induction in
1945, for which he was later
awarded a Nobel Prize. William
W. Hansen built Stanford's first
linear accelerator there in 1947,
and Paul Kirkpatrick devised the
first X-Ray reflection microscope
in 1948.

Construction of llu* new $2,300,0 CX) mathematics center in the
old “Physics Comer began Monday w hen contractors Wagner
and Martinez of San Francisco started the job of stripping the old
four-story building inside to its stone walls and fitting a new five
story building into the shell. With the completion of the center,

scheduled for late summer of
-1964, mathematics units which
are now scattered in six separate
locations on campus, will be con
solidated under one roof, except
for the Computation Center in
the Science Quad.
The plans for the now center
attempt to increase space, im
prove lighting and ventilation,
meet today’s building specifica
tions and accommodate essential
new equipment while preserving
the traditional appearance of the
Quad.
Architects Spencer and Lee of
San Francisco have included in
their design for the mathematics
center 1 quiet quarters for both

group and individual research.
THi; I.IBKAKV and reading
room will be on the top floor
with a small terrace roof adjoin
ing. A large lecture room and
other classrooms will be on the
lower floor.
Construction of the center is
being financed by a $1 million
grant from the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, by a government
grant of $250,000 from the Na
tional Science Foundation, and by
contributions from other private
donors.
The expanded facilities have
become necessary due to the
rapid growth of the Mathematics
Department which has approxi
mately quadrupled its graduates
in the past ten years.
THE BUILDINGS at “Physics
Corner,” vacated when the phys
ics department moved into the
new Varian Laboratory of Phys
ics, have been the site of many
important physics experiments.
It was in them that Russell Vari
an made the first Klystron tube
in 1937 and that Felix Bloch dis
covered nuclear induction in
1945, for which he was later
awarded a Nobel Prize. William
W. Hansen built Stanford's first
linear accelerator there in 1947,
and Paul Kirkpatrick devised the
first X-Ray reflection microscope
in 1948.
