# Old Zeta Psi Fraternity House To Become New I-Club Center
## 
### STEVEN GRAND-JEAN 
By September first the Zeta Psi fraternity house will be con
verted into a new International Center, Mrs. Gertrude Williams,
Associate Foreign Student Advisor, explained that with a total’
foreign enrollment of 850 students, an increase of 20 per cent
over the past year, an enlarged center is needed to help the for-

eign student bridge the cultural
gap between his own country and
the United Slates.

The two-story center will con
tain, on the ground floor, a
lounge, meeting rooms, the Office
of Foreign Visitors, and the Of
fice of the Community Committee
on International Students. The
general secretarial office, the re
ceptionist’s office, research
rooms, meeting rooms, and the
offices of Mrs. Williams and Dr.
Werner Warmbrunn, Foreign
Student Advisor, will bo on the
second floor.

Warmbrunn expressed his grat
itude to the members and alum
ni of Zeta Psi for their help in
making the dream of a new In
ternational Center a reality. Mrs.
Williams and Warmbrunn felt
that the new facilities will lead
to the integration of the individu
al foreign student into the Stan
ford community as well as into
the general community.

While Warmbrunn was not
pessimistic in his evaluation of
past efforts to integrate foreign
students into the community, he
felt that the entire situation was
in need of improvement. Mrs.
Williams added that while the
International Center “will not
make Americans of foreign stu
dents, it will provide a place
where they can form friendships
with both members of the Stan
ford community as well as the
community at large.’’
