# Fallout Shelter Controversy
## 
### 
The current campus controversy over the proposed fall
out shelters is a hit misplaced; those who are doing the ar
guing could spend their time to better advantage hy realistic
ally contributing to positive efforts for world peace rather
than hy protesting against the erection of facilities which
would be capable of saving the lives of many Stanford stu
dents in the event of a nuclear attack.

Opponents of the proposed shelters claim that the pres
ence of shelters in the United States contributes to the com
placency of its citizens and to their willingness to become
involved in aw ar. They claim that, in the event of an attack,
only a small number of people, if any at all, could be saved
by shelters, and that living conditions in the shelters would
promote a “dog-eat-dog” sort of society which would not be
worth preserving. They claim that the “tremendous cost” of
the Civil Defense program could be better spent on the
United Nations or some other peace-promoting activity. Their
arguments can best be countered bv the facts.

In the first place, the proposed shelters are fallout shelters,
not bomb shelters, and are not intended to provide complete
protection for a direct nuclear hit. They will, however, pro
vide protection against fallout coming from an atomic bomb
dropped on San Francisco or San Jose. Fallout, consisting of
contaminated dost particles thrown up by the original blast,
takes an hour or more to drift back to earth after the blast.
In that hour, there would be time for Stanford students and
other members of the community to “crawl into their holes
in the ground” in order to be alive to emerge from the holes
when the radioactivity had settled to a safe level, perhaps
two weeks later.

The master Civil Defense plans call for government in the
shelters, which would prevent a “dog-eat-dog” society from
forming. Democratic government would have to be followed
in the shelters and afterwards or anarchy would reign, and
American citizens are intelligent enough to decide which
course to follow. In order for the United States to survive at
all, some citizens must be left to rebuild it.

President Kennedy has called the shelter program a “form
of life insurance to protect the living.” Yet the “extreme cost”
of the shelter program is merely a pittance compared to the
cost per person of individual life insurance, a pittance which
might save American democratic institutions.

Rather than promoting war, the fallout shelters will dem
onstrate' to the people of the United States and of the Soviet
Union that the American people are determined to survive a
nuclear war and are not defeatists or pessimists taking no
precautions at all. The Stanford shelters which are being built
will contribute to the master plan, and as such should be wel
comed by the students rather than condemned.

shelters, which would prevent a “dog-eat-dog” society from
forming. Democratic government would have to be followed
in the shelters and afterwards or anarchy would reign, and
American citizens are intelligent enough to decide which
course to follow. In order for the United States to survive at
all, some citizens must be left to rebuild it.

President Kennedy has called the shelter program a “form
of life insurance to protect the living.” Yet the “extreme cost”
of the shelter program is merely a pittance compared to the
cost per person of individual life insurance, a pittance which
might save American democratic institutions.

Rather than promoting war, the fallout shelters will dem
onstrate' to the people of the United States and of the Soviet
Union that the American people are determined to survive a
nuclear war and are not defeatists or pessimists taking no
precautions at all. The Stanford shelters which are being built
will contribute to the master plan, and as such should be wel
comed by the students rather than condemned.
The current campus controversy over the proposed fall
out shelters is a hit misplaced; those who are doing the ar
guing could spend their time to better advantage hy realistic
ally contributing to positive efforts for world peace rather
than hy protesting against the erection of facilities which
would be capable of saving the lives of many Stanford stu
dents in the event of a nuclear attack.

Opponents of the proposed shelters claim that the pres
ence of shelters in the United States contributes to the com
placency of its citizens and to their willingness to become
involved in aw ar. They claim that, in the event of an attack,
only a small number of people, if any at all, could be saved
by shelters, and that living conditions in the shelters would
promote a “dog-eat-dog” sort of society which would not be
worth preserving. They claim that the “tremendous cost” of
the Civil Defense program could be better spent on the
United Nations or some other peace-promoting activity. Their
arguments can best be countered bv the facts.

In the first place, the proposed shelters are fallout shelters,
not bomb shelters, and are not intended to provide complete
protection for a direct nuclear hit. They will, however, pro
vide protection against fallout coming from an atomic bomb
dropped on San Francisco or San Jose. Fallout, consisting of
contaminated dost particles thrown up by the original blast,
takes an hour or more to drift back to earth after the blast.
In that hour, there would be time for Stanford students and
other members of the community to “crawl into their holes
in the ground” in order to be alive to emerge from the holes
when the radioactivity had settled to a safe level, perhaps
two weeks later.

The master Civil Defense plans call for government in the
