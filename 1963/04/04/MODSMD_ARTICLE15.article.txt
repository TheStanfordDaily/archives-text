# New Public Exercises Rule
## 
### 
I he speech by Arnold Toynbee Tuesday night was attend
ed by some 2400 people. According to Miss Agnes Nohrnberg,
Director of the Committee on Public Exercises, 75 per cent
of these were University students, 20 per cent were members
Â°l fhe Stanford community, and 5 per cent were people from
outside the University community. Miss Nohrnberg estimated
that some 1500 to 2000 people were turned away when the
doors were closed.

1 here have been many speeches in the past which Stanford
students have not been able to attend because most of the
seats were taken by people who were not members of the
Stanford community. The reason for the change is that, for
the first time with a speech sponsored entirely by the Com
mittee on Public Exercises, people with student body cards
and other Stanford identification were allowed into Memorial
Auditorium first.

The Committee on Public Exercises lias established an ex
cellent precedent, which should be followed for all events
in the future planned by or for Stanford students.
