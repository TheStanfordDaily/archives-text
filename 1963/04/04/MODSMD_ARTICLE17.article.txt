Editors, The Dally:
In the aftermath of the Berlin crisis of 1961, I was one of a
small group of Stanford faculty members who participated in
the civil defense controversy that flared up in the Bay Area.
Speaking before P.TA.’s and Homeowners' Associations, we
managed to impress upon many concerned, often panicky citi
zens the political and strategic implications of the government’s
civil defense proposals and to make them aware of the ques
tionahl character of the program. Many of these groups, per
haps partially due to our arguments, abandoned their civil de
fense plans and, in one case, diverted the money for the project
to the United Nations.
I now find myself in the embarrassing position of living on a
campus that has undertaken a $50,0(X) civil defense effort, and
has done this without opening the issue up for discussion—as
if, indeed, there were nothing to be discussed. Given Stanford’s
location, the nature of (he shelters, and the nw magnitude of
Soviet weaponry since 1961, I see no reason to believe that this
program is any less futile or dangerously self-dceptive than the
civil defense plans of two years ago. Nor do I believe that civil
defense has lost its extremely provocative strategic conse
quences.
I wonder if the university administration is aware that a
sizable body of authoritative literature has appeal'd in the past
few years which seriously discredits the government's civil de
fnse program. This is criticism which the government has not
answered to date; it has simply waited for its effect to die away
and has then set about distributing money to those still gullible
or ignorant enough to accept it. Does the Stanford administration
realize that, civil defense is an integral part of a strategy (that
of counterforee, first-strike) which has received no significant
public discussion, despite the fact that competent students of
military affairs have assailed its practicality and morality?
Has it even considered the contribution civil defense makes to
the cruel illusion of security and the public acceptance of policies
based on the threat of thermonuclear war? Is it not the function
of a university to encourage public dhale on such controversial
policies?
It is ironic in the extreme that an intellectual community,
gifted with Stanford’s talents, should confront these issues with
less candor, with less a sense of social responsibility than many
a local P.T.A. In the midst of the deafening silence, may I pro
test this project, and suggest (hat the administration publicly
defend the wisdom of its civil defense system as part of a cam
pus-wide discussion.
Let me close by mentioning just two recent works in which
much of the most authoritative literature critical of civil de
fense has been collected. They are Seymour Melman’s NO
PLACE TO HIDE and Arthur Waskow’s AMERICA IN HID
ING. These books cost a total of $1.35. Had the Stanford admin
istration spent the much and read the books, it might well have
saved the government $50,000. .

In answer to the 190 signatories of the letter to President
Sterling, the Peace Caucus members, I propose the following
points;
1. That instead of reducing our will to find peaceful solu
tions to international conflict by lulling us into a false sense
of security, I believe that the construction of fallout shelters
will give to our nation a will to press forward through possibly
increasing hazards and threats to the ending of international
conflict through peaceful means. It is seldom that a man has
made his most wise and foresighted decision In fear;
2. That fallout shelters, instead of suggesting to our adver
saries that we are seriously contemplating the first strike in a
thermonuclear war, will suggest to them that we are at least
not a nation who sits with neck bared waiting for the axe and
praying for it not to fall, but are instead a realistic nation who
prepares for the worst while working towards the best.
3. To the argument that fallout shelters discourage the
attitudes of cooperation and mutual aid and foster a selfish
struggle for individual survival, I have only this to say:
Our nation was built on a selfish struggle for individual sur
vival. Where would we be today if the men who protested
(selfishly) that unjust taxation was taking their money, had
said instead that “in the interests of mutual aid and cooperation
we will continue to pay uncomplainingly?” What nation would
occupy this continent today if Patrick Henry had said “Britain
has too many guns for us; don’t build defenses, let’s negotiate.”
instead of his famous (selfish) cry “Give me liberty or give me
death!” The men who founded the economy of our nation were
not spurred by desires for mutual aid and cooperation. They
were interested in “selfish" things-—in doing things by and for
themselves. The man who works for himself works with the
best that is in him.
I suggest that our nation needs more ppppje to engage in a
selfish struggle for survival. Aftpf'dll, if nohe of, us bothered
about our individual struggle for-survival, why bother with mu
tual aid and cooperation? If everyone gave up this selfish strug
gle. there would be no need for mutual aid and cooperation -
there’d be no one with whom to cooperate!

The recent “Scratch Sheet” published by ASSU takes a sig
nificant step in the struggle for better teaching. Mature and ob
jective criticism by students can and should play an important
role in the process of maintaining and improving standards in
education.
As the teaching assistants and acting instructors in the
philosophy department, we wish to make the following state
ment in the interest of lessening the deficiencies of “education
by TA.” It is our hope that the views we express here will be
reflected in the actions of all departments which use teaching
assistants.
1. The position of teaching assistant should be recog
nized as a position of academic responsibility, and should be
offered with the same degree of care which attends the se
lection of regular faculty.
2. The position of teaching assistant should be honorific.
It should go to the most qualified candidates available. We
deplore the practice of departments which offer teaching
assistantships to those who do not qualify for full fellow
ships.
3. Qualification for appointment as a teaching assistant
should include both academic competence and a sincere in
terest in teaching. Graduate students who view a teaching
assistantship as just a job, and not as an academic trust, are
not likely to be competent, regardless of their proficiency in
the field.
4. Each department, and its teaching assistants, should
recognize the position to be an apprenticeship in teaching.
We call on professors who use assistants to take an active
interest in the quality of assistance they receive, and to pro
vide a mixture of guidance and responsibility which will be
conducive to the development of high quality teachers and to
the maintenance of high quality courses.

role in the process of maintaining and improving standards in
education.
As the teaching assistants and acting instructors in the
philosophy department, we wish to make the following state
ment in the interest of lessening the deficiencies of “education
by TA.” It is our hope that the views we express here will be
reflected in the actions of all departments which use teaching
assistants.
1. The position of teaching assistant should be recog
nized as a position of academic responsibility, and should be
offered with the same degree of care which attends the se
lection of regular faculty.
2. The position of teaching assistant should be honorific.
It should go to the most qualified candidates available. We
deplore the practice of departments which offer teaching
assistantships to those who do not qualify for full fellow
ships.
3. Qualification for appointment as a teaching assistant
should include both academic competence and a sincere in
terest in teaching. Graduate students who view a teaching
assistantship as just a job, and not as an academic trust, are
not likely to be competent, regardless of their proficiency in
the field.
4. Each department, and its teaching assistants, should
recognize the position to be an apprenticeship in teaching.
We call on professors who use assistants to take an active
interest in the quality of assistance they receive, and to pro
vide a mixture of guidance and responsibility which will be
conducive to the development of high quality teachers and to
the maintenance of high quality courses.

In the aftermath of the Berlin crisis of 1961, I was one of a
small group of Stanford faculty members who participated in
the civil defense controversy that flared up in the Bay Area.
Speaking before P.TA.’s and Homeowners' Associations, we
managed to impress upon many concerned, often panicky citi
zens the political and strategic implications of the government’s
civil defense proposals and to make them aware of the ques
tionahl character of the program. Many of these groups, per
haps partially due to our arguments, abandoned their civil de
fense plans and, in one case, diverted the money for the project
to the United Nations.
I now find myself in the embarrassing position of living on a
campus that has undertaken a $50,0(X) civil defense effort, and
has done this without opening the issue up for discussion—as
if, indeed, there were nothing to be discussed. Given Stanford’s
location, the nature of (he shelters, and the nw magnitude of
Soviet weaponry since 1961, I see no reason to believe that this
program is any less futile or dangerously self-dceptive than the
civil defense plans of two years ago. Nor do I believe that civil
defense has lost its extremely provocative strategic conse
quences.
I wonder if the university administration is aware that a
sizable body of authoritative literature has appeal'd in the past
few years which seriously discredits the government's civil de
fnse program. This is criticism which the government has not
answered to date; it has simply waited for its effect to die away
and has then set about distributing money to those still gullible
or ignorant enough to accept it. Does the Stanford administration
realize that, civil defense is an integral part of a strategy (that
of counterforee, first-strike) which has received no significant
public discussion, despite the fact that competent students of
military affairs have assailed its practicality and morality?
Has it even considered the contribution civil defense makes to
the cruel illusion of security and the public acceptance of policies
based on the threat of thermonuclear war? Is it not the function
of a university to encourage public dhale on such controversial
policies?
It is ironic in the extreme that an intellectual community,
gifted with Stanford’s talents, should confront these issues with
less candor, with less a sense of social responsibility than many
a local P.T.A. In the midst of the deafening silence, may I pro
test this project, and suggest (hat the administration publicly
defend the wisdom of its civil defense system as part of a cam
pus-wide discussion.
Let me close by mentioning just two recent works in which
much of the most authoritative literature critical of civil de
fense has been collected. They are Seymour Melman’s NO
PLACE TO HIDE and Arthur Waskow’s AMERICA IN HID
ING. These books cost a total of $1.35. Had the Stanford admin
istration spent the much and read the books, it might well have
saved the government $50,000. .

In answer to the 190 signatories of the letter to President
Sterling, the Peace Caucus members, I propose the following
points;
1. That instead of reducing our will to find peaceful solu
tions to international conflict by lulling us into a false sense
of security, I believe that the construction of fallout shelters
will give to our nation a will to press forward through possibly
increasing hazards and threats to the ending of international
conflict through peaceful means. It is seldom that a man has
made his most wise and foresighted decision In fear;
2. That fallout shelters, instead of suggesting to our adver
saries that we are seriously contemplating the first strike in a
thermonuclear war, will suggest to them that we are at least
not a nation who sits with neck bared waiting for the axe and
praying for it not to fall, but are instead a realistic nation who
prepares for the worst while working towards the best.
3. To the argument that fallout shelters discourage the
attitudes of cooperation and mutual aid and foster a selfish
struggle for individual survival, I have only this to say:
Our nation was built on a selfish struggle for individual sur
vival. Where would we be today if the men who protested
(selfishly) that unjust taxation was taking their money, had
said instead that “in the interests of mutual aid and cooperation
we will continue to pay uncomplainingly?” What nation would
occupy this continent today if Patrick Henry had said “Britain
has too many guns for us; don’t build defenses, let’s negotiate.”
instead of his famous (selfish) cry “Give me liberty or give me
death!” The men who founded the economy of our nation were
not spurred by desires for mutual aid and cooperation. They
were interested in “selfish" things-—in doing things by and for
themselves. The man who works for himself works with the
best that is in him.
I suggest that our nation needs more ppppje to engage in a
selfish struggle for survival. Aftpf'dll, if nohe of, us bothered
about our individual struggle for-survival, why bother with mu
tual aid and cooperation? If everyone gave up this selfish strug
gle. there would be no need for mutual aid and cooperation -
there’d be no one with whom to cooperate!

prepares for the worst while working towards the best.
3. To the argument that fallout shelters discourage the
attitudes of cooperation and mutual aid and foster a selfish
struggle for individual survival, I have only this to say:
Our nation was built on a selfish struggle for individual sur
vival. Where would we be today if the men who protested
(selfishly) that unjust taxation was taking their money, had
said instead that “in the interests of mutual aid and cooperation
we will continue to pay uncomplainingly?” What nation would
occupy this continent today if Patrick Henry had said “Britain
has too many guns for us; don’t build defenses, let’s negotiate.”
instead of his famous (selfish) cry “Give me liberty or give me
death!” The men who founded the economy of our nation were
not spurred by desires for mutual aid and cooperation. They
were interested in “selfish" things-—in doing things by and for
themselves. The man who works for himself works with the
best that is in him.
I suggest that our nation needs more ppppje to engage in a
selfish struggle for survival. Aftpf'dll, if nohe of, us bothered
about our individual struggle for-survival, why bother with mu
tual aid and cooperation? If everyone gave up this selfish strug
gle. there would be no need for mutual aid and cooperation -
there’d be no one with whom to cooperate!

The recent “Scratch Sheet” published by ASSU takes a sig
nificant step in the struggle for better teaching. Mature and ob
jective criticism by students can and should play an important
role in the process of maintaining and improving standards in
education.
As the teaching assistants and acting instructors in the
philosophy department, we wish to make the following state
ment in the interest of lessening the deficiencies of “education
by TA.” It is our hope that the views we express here will be
reflected in the actions of all departments which use teaching
assistants.
1. The position of teaching assistant should be recog
nized as a position of academic responsibility, and should be
offered with the same degree of care which attends the se
lection of regular faculty.
2. The position of teaching assistant should be honorific.
It should go to the most qualified candidates available. We
deplore the practice of departments which offer teaching
assistantships to those who do not qualify for full fellow
ships.
3. Qualification for appointment as a teaching assistant
should include both academic competence and a sincere in
terest in teaching. Graduate students who view a teaching
assistantship as just a job, and not as an academic trust, are
not likely to be competent, regardless of their proficiency in
the field.
4. Each department, and its teaching assistants, should
recognize the position to be an apprenticeship in teaching.
We call on professors who use assistants to take an active
interest in the quality of assistance they receive, and to pro
vide a mixture of guidance and responsibility which will be
conducive to the development of high quality teachers and to
the maintenance of high quality courses.

In the aftermath of the Berlin crisis of 1961, I was one of a
small group of Stanford faculty members who participated in
the civil defense controversy that flared up in the Bay Area.
Speaking before P.TA.’s and Homeowners' Associations, we
managed to impress upon many concerned, often panicky citi
zens the political and strategic implications of the government’s
civil defense proposals and to make them aware of the ques
tionahl character of the program. Many of these groups, per
haps partially due to our arguments, abandoned their civil de
fense plans and, in one case, diverted the money for the project
to the United Nations.
I now find myself in the embarrassing position of living on a
campus that has undertaken a $50,0(X) civil defense effort, and
has done this without opening the issue up for discussion—as
if, indeed, there were nothing to be discussed. Given Stanford’s
location, the nature of (he shelters, and the nw magnitude of
Soviet weaponry since 1961, I see no reason to believe that this
program is any less futile or dangerously self-dceptive than the
civil defense plans of two years ago. Nor do I believe that civil
defense has lost its extremely provocative strategic conse
quences.
I wonder if the university administration is aware that a
sizable body of authoritative literature has appeal'd in the past
few years which seriously discredits the government's civil de
fnse program. This is criticism which the government has not
answered to date; it has simply waited for its effect to die away
and has then set about distributing money to those still gullible
or ignorant enough to accept it. Does the Stanford administration
realize that, civil defense is an integral part of a strategy (that
of counterforee, first-strike) which has received no significant
public discussion, despite the fact that competent students of
military affairs have assailed its practicality and morality?
Has it even considered the contribution civil defense makes to
the cruel illusion of security and the public acceptance of policies
based on the threat of thermonuclear war? Is it not the function
of a university to encourage public dhale on such controversial
policies?
It is ironic in the extreme that an intellectual community,
gifted with Stanford’s talents, should confront these issues with
less candor, with less a sense of social responsibility than many
a local P.T.A. In the midst of the deafening silence, may I pro
test this project, and suggest (hat the administration publicly
defend the wisdom of its civil defense system as part of a cam
pus-wide discussion.
Let me close by mentioning just two recent works in which
much of the most authoritative literature critical of civil de
fense has been collected. They are Seymour Melman’s NO
PLACE TO HIDE and Arthur Waskow’s AMERICA IN HID
ING. These books cost a total of $1.35. Had the Stanford admin
istration spent the much and read the books, it might well have
saved the government $50,000. .

In answer to the 190 signatories of the letter to President
Sterling, the Peace Caucus members, I propose the following
points;
1. That instead of reducing our will to find peaceful solu
tions to international conflict by lulling us into a false sense
of security, I believe that the construction of fallout shelters
will give to our nation a will to press forward through possibly
increasing hazards and threats to the ending of international
conflict through peaceful means. It is seldom that a man has
made his most wise and foresighted decision In fear;
2. That fallout shelters, instead of suggesting to our adver
saries that we are seriously contemplating the first strike in a
thermonuclear war, will suggest to them that we are at least
not a nation who sits with neck bared waiting for the axe and

less candor, with less a sense of social responsibility than many
a local P.T.A. In the midst of the deafening silence, may I pro
test this project, and suggest (hat the administration publicly
defend the wisdom of its civil defense system as part of a cam
pus-wide discussion.
Let me close by mentioning just two recent works in which
much of the most authoritative literature critical of civil de
fense has been collected. They are Seymour Melman’s NO
PLACE TO HIDE and Arthur Waskow’s AMERICA IN HID
ING. These books cost a total of $1.35. Had the Stanford admin
istration spent the much and read the books, it might well have
saved the government $50,000. .

In answer to the 190 signatories of the letter to President
Sterling, the Peace Caucus members, I propose the following
points;
1. That instead of reducing our will to find peaceful solu
tions to international conflict by lulling us into a false sense
of security, I believe that the construction of fallout shelters
will give to our nation a will to press forward through possibly
increasing hazards and threats to the ending of international
conflict through peaceful means. It is seldom that a man has
made his most wise and foresighted decision In fear;
2. That fallout shelters, instead of suggesting to our adver
saries that we are seriously contemplating the first strike in a
thermonuclear war, will suggest to them that we are at least
not a nation who sits with neck bared waiting for the axe and
praying for it not to fall, but are instead a realistic nation who
prepares for the worst while working towards the best.
3. To the argument that fallout shelters discourage the
attitudes of cooperation and mutual aid and foster a selfish
struggle for individual survival, I have only this to say:
Our nation was built on a selfish struggle for individual sur
vival. Where would we be today if the men who protested
(selfishly) that unjust taxation was taking their money, had
said instead that “in the interests of mutual aid and cooperation
we will continue to pay uncomplainingly?” What nation would
occupy this continent today if Patrick Henry had said “Britain
has too many guns for us; don’t build defenses, let’s negotiate.”
instead of his famous (selfish) cry “Give me liberty or give me
death!” The men who founded the economy of our nation were
not spurred by desires for mutual aid and cooperation. They
were interested in “selfish" things-—in doing things by and for
themselves. The man who works for himself works with the
best that is in him.
I suggest that our nation needs more ppppje to engage in a
selfish struggle for survival. Aftpf'dll, if nohe of, us bothered
about our individual struggle for-survival, why bother with mu
tual aid and cooperation? If everyone gave up this selfish strug
gle. there would be no need for mutual aid and cooperation -
there’d be no one with whom to cooperate!

The recent “Scratch Sheet” published by ASSU takes a sig
nificant step in the struggle for better teaching. Mature and ob
jective criticism by students can and should play an important
role in the process of maintaining and improving standards in
education.
As the teaching assistants and acting instructors in the
philosophy department, we wish to make the following state
ment in the interest of lessening the deficiencies of “education
by TA.” It is our hope that the views we express here will be
reflected in the actions of all departments which use teaching
assistants.
1. The position of teaching assistant should be recog
nized as a position of academic responsibility, and should be
offered with the same degree of care which attends the se
lection of regular faculty.
2. The position of teaching assistant should be honorific.
It should go to the most qualified candidates available. We
deplore the practice of departments which offer teaching
assistantships to those who do not qualify for full fellow
ships.
3. Qualification for appointment as a teaching assistant
should include both academic competence and a sincere in
terest in teaching. Graduate students who view a teaching
assistantship as just a job, and not as an academic trust, are
not likely to be competent, regardless of their proficiency in
the field.
4. Each department, and its teaching assistants, should
recognize the position to be an apprenticeship in teaching.
We call on professors who use assistants to take an active
interest in the quality of assistance they receive, and to pro
vide a mixture of guidance and responsibility which will be
conducive to the development of high quality teachers and to
the maintenance of high quality courses.
