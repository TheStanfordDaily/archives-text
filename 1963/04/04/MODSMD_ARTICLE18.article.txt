# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## Young Baseballers Are Title Threats 
### Glenn Alford 
Stanford's young baseball team has developed beyond anybody’s
wildest dreams.
Three sophomores are consistently in the starting lineup, and
another sophomore pitches quite often. Baseball men will tell you
that a team depending to such an extent on young players will have
trouble winning, but Coach Dutch Fehring’s youngsters currently
sport an 11-4 record that includes an eight-game winning streak
following an opening day loss.
All (his with a starting lineup (hat most often has only two
seniors starting. Three juniors and tin 1 ' aforementioned sophs also
start.
Greg Post and .Joel Shulman are the only veterans (seniors) that
have consistently been in the starting lineup, but they have formed
the nucleus of a solid club. Post currently has the highest batting
average on the Stanford team.
Shulman is one of the best fielding shortstops in college base
ball, though he occasionally falls into the occupational hazard of
college infielders, booting the easy play and then converting a tough
chance into a double play. He also delivers needed hits. Tuesday he
belted a leadoff home run to give Stanford the only run it needed all
afternoon.
TIIK STARTING JUNIORS are Bob Hollmaim, Warren Newell
and either Chuck French or Jim Seckler.
Hollmann gives Stanford good fielding protection at first base
and good power at the plate. He has broken a slump that hit him at
the start of the season and has hit the ball well since he got a home
run against Chico State.

Versatile All-Star

Newell was an All-CIBA outfielder last year. His hatting has
trailed off, but he has become a better fielder and gives Fehring a
third starting pitcher to go with aces Darrell Sutherland and .lim

Lonborg.
French ami Seckler have divid
ed the time behind the plate.
While neither has set the world
afire with his hatting, they have
done surprisingly well defensive
ly.
The sophomores, Bobby Cox,
Gary Smith and George Thacher
have provided (he boost to give
Fehring a good, solid Stanford
club. Cox is a good outfielder and
may prove to be the best hitter
in the team. He has already been
offered contracts by several ma
jor league teams.
SMITH HAS been outstanding
defensively at third base and his
batting has been such that Feh
ring has had him either third or
fifth in the batting order.
Thacher is proving to be a
fancy fielder around second base
and, while his batting average
isn’t exceptionally high, he has
driven home some important run;

Tin* pitching also has been outstanding, and thus far the best
won-loss record is held by a sophomore, Dick Kovacevlch. The tall
newcomer is 4-0, including' Tuesday’s shutout victory over Pacific.
Kovacevich held the Tigers to one solid and one tainted hit in seven
frames.

The aces of the mound staff
are a junior, Jim Lonborg, whose
3-3 record belies his effectiveness,
and Darrell Sutherland, who lost
a heart-breaker in his first de
cision since joining the baseball
tern after the basketball season
was over. USC beat Sutherland
1-0 thanks to a first inning double
steal.
The Indians are 0-2 in the CIBA,
but their play has merited a bet
ter fate. Stanford lost 2-1 in
eleven innings to USC on a dis
puted call at first base, and also
1-0 to the Trojans.
THU INDIANS may not win
the pennant since UCLA has al
ready spreadeagled the field with
a 6-0 mark, including two vic
tories against both Santa Clara
and USC. However UCLA has to
play Stanford four times and if
the Indians give their superlative
pitching any batting support,
they might give the Farm a
championship by defeating UCLA
in a playoff.

afire with his hatting, they have
done surprisingly well defensive
ly.
The sophomores, Bobby Cox,
Gary Smith and George Thacher
have provided (he boost to give
Fehring a good, solid Stanford
club. Cox is a good outfielder and
may prove to be the best hitter
in the team. He has already been
offered contracts by several ma
jor league teams.
SMITH HAS been outstanding
defensively at third base and his
batting has been such that Feh
ring has had him either third or
fifth in the batting order.
Thacher is proving to be a
fancy fielder around second base
and, while his batting average
isn’t exceptionally high, he has
driven home some important run;

Tin* pitching also has been outstanding, and thus far the best
won-loss record is held by a sophomore, Dick Kovacevlch. The tall
newcomer is 4-0, including' Tuesday’s shutout victory over Pacific.
Kovacevich held the Tigers to one solid and one tainted hit in seven
frames.

The aces of the mound staff
are a junior, Jim Lonborg, whose
3-3 record belies his effectiveness,
and Darrell Sutherland, who lost
a heart-breaker in his first de
cision since joining the baseball
tern after the basketball season
was over. USC beat Sutherland
1-0 thanks to a first inning double
steal.
The Indians are 0-2 in the CIBA,
but their play has merited a bet
ter fate. Stanford lost 2-1 in
eleven innings to USC on a dis
puted call at first base, and also
1-0 to the Trojans.
THU INDIANS may not win
the pennant since UCLA has al
ready spreadeagled the field with
a 6-0 mark, including two vic
tories against both Santa Clara
and USC. However UCLA has to
play Stanford four times and if
the Indians give their superlative
pitching any batting support,
they might give the Farm a
championship by defeating UCLA
in a playoff.

Stanford's young baseball team has developed beyond anybody’s
wildest dreams.
Three sophomores are consistently in the starting lineup, and
another sophomore pitches quite often. Baseball men will tell you
that a team depending to such an extent on young players will have
trouble winning, but Coach Dutch Fehring’s youngsters currently
sport an 11-4 record that includes an eight-game winning streak
following an opening day loss.
All (his with a starting lineup (hat most often has only two
seniors starting. Three juniors and tin 1 ' aforementioned sophs also
start.
Greg Post and .Joel Shulman are the only veterans (seniors) that
have consistently been in the starting lineup, but they have formed
the nucleus of a solid club. Post currently has the highest batting
average on the Stanford team.
Shulman is one of the best fielding shortstops in college base
ball, though he occasionally falls into the occupational hazard of
college infielders, booting the easy play and then converting a tough
chance into a double play. He also delivers needed hits. Tuesday he
belted a leadoff home run to give Stanford the only run it needed all
afternoon.
TIIK STARTING JUNIORS are Bob Hollmaim, Warren Newell
and either Chuck French or Jim Seckler.
Hollmann gives Stanford good fielding protection at first base
and good power at the plate. He has broken a slump that hit him at
the start of the season and has hit the ball well since he got a home
run against Chico State.

Versatile All-Star

Newell was an All-CIBA outfielder last year. His hatting has
trailed off, but he has become a better fielder and gives Fehring a
third starting pitcher to go with aces Darrell Sutherland and .lim

Lonborg.
