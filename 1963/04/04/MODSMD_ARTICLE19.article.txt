# Crew Opens Season Saturday, Race USC, OSU
## 
### PETE KING 
Crew season gets under way
Saturday morning with three
races in Redwood City Harbor
against (he freshman, junior
varsity and varsity crews from
Oregon State and USC.
The Stanford oarsmen, with
several experienced men return
ing, will be favored. The Trojans
have never been known for their
rowing prowess, and Oregon
State lost badly to Cal last week
by four lengths. However, crew
is as full of upsets as any other
sport, and it could be a close race.
THE FROSII race will start at
9 a.m., followed by the JV’s at
9:30, ad the varsities at 10. The
race will be held on a 2000-meter
course in front of the Port of
Redwood City. Spectators can
reach the course by taking the
Harbor Boulevard turn-off from
the Bayshore Freeway and going
half a mile to the Redwood City
Marina, turning left, and driving
to the end of the parking lot.
The varsity oarsmen, from
bow to stroke, will be Frank
Hubbard, Rich Langemack, John
Edmunds, John Allison, Bob
Harrison, John Elder, Dave Mil
ler, and Ed Ferry. Coxswain is
Mike Hanley. Ferry and coach
Conn Findley won the U.S. pair

oared championships last year
and placed fifth in the world
meet at Lucerne.
The varsity will be strengthen
ed by last year’s frosh squad,
which had a 10-2 record. This
year’s frosh team is also prom

ising, with a turnout at season's
start of 100. A grueling training
schedule which includes getting
up at 5:30 a.m. and running up
and down the football stadium
seats has cut the squad substan
tially.
