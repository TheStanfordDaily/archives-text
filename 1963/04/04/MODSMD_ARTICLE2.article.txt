# Road Construction Ties Up SU Traffic
## 
### MARILYN FRYE 
Upon returning to Stanford to
begin Spring Quarter registra
tion and classes, Stanford stu
dents and faculty have been faced
with road blockades, new con
struction and re-routed traffic.
The Buildings and Grounds De
partment reports that it is part
of the total building program
schedule and cannot be avoided
or postponed even in the interest
of waiting for summer and the
ensuing lighter traffic loads.

The construction on Lomita
Drive, in front of the Museum
and the Chemistry building is
part of a construction program
which will extend along the
whole course of Lomita up to
Santa Teresa Street. At this time,
the work involves replacing old
water mains and connecting
storm sewers and sanitary sew
ers. This system of mains and
sewers will be integrated with
the system in the now No. 2
Stauffer Laboratory which is
now under construction.
AT THE END of Campus Drive
where the road is being repaired,
work is being held up by (ho
weather, and cannot be completed
until the ground dries. In this
project, Campus Drive is being
extended and slightly re-routed.
Mr. Floyd Campbell, speaking
for the Buildings' and Grounds
Department, commented that
everything possible was being
done to avoid causing inconveni
ence and traffic difficulties. The
Buildings and Grounds Depart
ment works in coordination with
the Chief of Police and the Chief
of the Fire Department, as well
as the construction company and
engineers, to solve whatever traf
fic problems result from the proj
ects which involve streets and
roads.
OTHER construction projects
which are now under way include
building for Married Student
Housing and renovation of the old
Physics building. There will also
be a new building project south
of the new Physics Lecture Hall,
and this project will again involve
underground work which may af
fect the roads. Mr. Campbell
commented that all of this build
ing is part of an Integrated build
ing plan and schedule which can
not wait for the advent of Sum
mer Quarter.
