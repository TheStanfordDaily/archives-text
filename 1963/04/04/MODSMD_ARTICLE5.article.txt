An “intellectual unleashing of freshmen” is taking place this
year at Harvard and Radcliffe according to the New York Times.
The big change is a switch away from the “well-rounded man”
concept in which students received a general education, to a sys
tem of seminars that immediately involve the freshmen with

■faculty members and high level
research.
This new seminar system “puts
a small group of new students to
work with a faculty member” in
an ungraded situation in which
students have access to laboratory
equipment and materials neces
sary for independent research.
“About one-fifth of this year’s
Harvard and Radcliffe freshmen
—a total of 322 students—are en
gaged in 40 such seminars.”
The seminar members are
chosen because of their interest,
commitment, or originality: not
necessarily because of scholar
ship or advanced knowledge.
Harvard, in 1945, introduced
the idea of a general education
mainly because the freshmen it
was receiving were virtually un
touched by the “liberal education”
they had supposedly rceived and
needed what amounted to remedi
al courses in all fields before they
could specialize.
Since then, an increasing num
ber of high schools have joined
a general reform movement that
takes general education require
ments seriously. They are turn
ing out graduates of higher
quality who are ready to meet the
demands of a more specialized
world.
