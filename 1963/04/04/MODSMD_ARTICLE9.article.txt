# IIR Denied Space In New I-Center
## 
### 
HR President Scott Thompson,
unhappy with the Faculty Com
mittee’s decision to deny the HR
space in the now International
Center, said yesterday that the
decision is a severe blow to the
University’s plan to integrate for
eign students into the Stanford
community.
Dr. Werner Warmbrunn, For
eign Student Advisor, justified
the Committee’s findings by ex
plaining that the proposal would
disrupt plans that had been two
years in the making by eliminat
ing the area that the Community
Committee on International Stu
dents had planned to occupy. The
Speaking on behalf of the HR
Policy Board, Thompson issued
(he following statement: “The
Policy Board of the Institute of
International Relations unani
mously voted to co-operate fully
in developing plans for the new
International Center which could
best be implemented by our pres
ence therein. The Policy Board
felt that it was a prime necessity
that the Center be an Interna
tional Center, not merely a for
eign student center. We felt that
this was indispensible in promot
ing healthier relations between
American and foreign students.
It was the opinion of the Policy
Board that space was more than
adequate to house the HR with
out harming, in fact, adding to,
the program of the Foreign Stu
dent Advisor.”
Thompson explained that the
Policy Board had agreed to house
half of the HR in the Internation
al Center to accommodate the
Foreign Student Advisor’s re
quest. and to test their hypothesis
that the presence of the HR in
the International Center would
add to the International Program.
This offer was refused.
Warmbrunn stated that the dif
ference of opinion that existed
between the Faculty Committee
of which he is a member and the
HR was a legitimate one. How
ever he added that next year an
independent committee will as
sess the effectiveness of Interna
tional Center and if the commit
tee’s findings indicate that the
presence of the HR would be
helpful in implementing the for
eign student program, space
would be made for the HR at
that time.
