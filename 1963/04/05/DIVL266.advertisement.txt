MARKING ON THE CURVE—AND WHAT
TO DO ABOUT IT
Twonkey Crimscott was a professor. Choate Sigafoos was a
sophomore. Twonkey Crimscott was keen, cold, brilliant.
Choate Sigafoos was loose, vague, adenoidal. Twonkey Crim
scott believed in diligence, discipline, and marking on the curve.
Choate Sigafoos believed in elves, Julie London, and thirteen
hours of sleep each night.
Vet there came a time when Twonkey Crimscott—mentor,
sage, and savant—was thoroughly outthought, outfoxed, out
maneuvered, outployed, and outwitted by Choate Sigafoos,
sophomore.

It happened one day when Choate was at the library studying
for one of Mr. Crimscott’s exams in sociology. Mr. Crimscott's
exams were murder—plain, flat murder. They consisted of one
hundred questions, each question having four possible answers
—A, B, C, and D. You had to check the correct answer, but the
trouble was that the four choices were so subtly shaded, so
intricately worded, that students more clever by far than Choate
[Sigafoos were often set to gibbering.
So on this day Choate sat in the library poring over his
sociology (ext, his tiny brow furrowed with concentration, while
all around him sat the other members of the sociology class,
every one studying like crazy, every one scared and pasty.
Choate looked sadly at their stricken faces. “What a waste!”
he thought. “All this youth, this verve, this bounce, chained to
musty books in a musty library! We should be out singing and
dancing and cutting didoes on the greensward! Instead we
are here.”
Then, suddenly, an absolute gasser of an idea hit Choate.
“Listen!” he shouted to his classmates. “Tomorrow when we
take the exam, let’s all—every one of us—check Choice ‘A’ on
every question—every one of them.”
“Huh?” said his classmates.
“Oh, I know that Choice ‘A’ can’t be the right answer to
every question,” said Choate. “But what’s the difference? Mr.
Crimscott marks on the curve. If we all check the same an
swers, then we all get the same score, and everybody in the class
gets a ‘C’.”
“Ilium,” said his classmates.
“So why should we knock ourselves out studying?” said
Choate. “Let’s get out of here and have a ball!”
So they all ran out and lit Marlboro Cigarettes and had a
ball, as indeed, you will too when you light a Marlboro, for if
there ever was a cigarette to lift the spirit and gladden the
heart, to dispel the shades of night, to knot up the ravelled
sleeve of care, to put spring in your gait and roses in your
cheeks, it is filtered Marl boros—firm and pure and fragrant and
filled with rich, natural, golden tobacco. And, what’s more, this
darlin’ smoke comes in soft packs that arc actually soft and
flip-top boxes that actually flip.
Well sir, the next morning the whole class did what Choate
said, and, sure enough, they all got ‘C’s, and they picked ('hoatc
up and carried him on their shoulders and sang “For lie’s a
Jolly flood Fellow” and plied him with sweetmeats and Marl
boros and girls and put on buttons which said “I DOTH OX
CHOATE.”
But they were celebrating too soon. Because the next time
shrewd old Mr. Crimscott gave them a test, he did not give
them one hundred multiple choice questions. He only gave
them one question—to wit; write a 110,000 word essay on
“Crime Does Not Pay.”
“You and your ideas,” they said to Choate and tore off his
epaulets and broke bis sword and drummed him out of (he
school. Today, a broken man, he cams a living as a camshaft
in Toledo. « lofl3
