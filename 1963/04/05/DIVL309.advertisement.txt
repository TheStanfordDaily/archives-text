PARKER ARROW CARTRIDGE PENS
All you have to do to enter is visit your nearest
Parker dealer, fill out an entry blank and mail it
to: Monster Contest, Box No. 748, Janesville, Wise.
And while you're visiting, why not test-write
our newest Parker —the Parker Arrow. This one
loads quickly and cleanly with big Super Quink
cartridges. It writes smooth as silk. The point is
solid 14K gold —it should last you years, no
matter how much you use it.
The Parker Arrow costs 53.95 (an astonishingly
low price for a Parker) and can save you impor
tant money on cartridges —ours are BIGGER and
last longer (each is good for 8 or 9,000 words).
NOTE: All entries must be postmarked on or
before midnight, April 7, 1963, and received on or
before April 14, 1963. Winners will be notified by
mail no later than May 1, 1963.
Open to any college student in the U.S. A. One
entry per student. Prizes awarded by drawing.
All entries become property of Parker. Decision
of judges final. Void in Nebraska, Wisconsin, and
wherever else prohibited by law.
