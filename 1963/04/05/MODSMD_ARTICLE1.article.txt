Rebholz points out a quote on
Robert Frost by Irving Howe
from “Robert Frost: A Momen
tary Stay.” Howe makes distinc
tions Iretween the two Robert
Frosts. The Frost who is appar
ently the national idol was the
rural sage offering his public an
easy return to the simplicities of
nature. On the other hand, in his
best poems, “as he contemplates
the thinning landscape of his
world and repeatedly finds him
self before closures of outlook
and experience, he ends, almost
against his will, in the company
of modern poets. With their tech
niques he has little in common;
he shares with them only a vision
of disturbance."
Rebholz stated “I will try to
lead some of the poems which
illustrated these two aspects of
Frost.”
