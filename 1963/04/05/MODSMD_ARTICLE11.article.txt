## Money and the Moon' 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
General Eisenhower has gone on record in favor of a cut of
$lO or $l2 billion in the government’s authority to make con
tracts which will be paid for as the missiles and the ships and
the like are manufactured. While this is unlikely to make any
substantial reduction in this year’s spending, it would make a
substantial difference in later years. General Eisenhower does
not himself specify what the cut should be, being, as he says,
out of touch with the details. But he takes his figures from his
last two budget directors- —Messrs. Stans and Brundage.
Although it is not likely to happen, it would be most en
lightening if Messrs. Stans and Brundage would present their
recommendations in detail and engage in a bout of reciprocal
questioning and answering with Mr. Gordon, the present Ken
nedy budget director. Unless something of the sort can be ar
ranged, the country will be subject to conflicting assertions
which never meet head on. This will add to the befuddlement
which so far has been the outstanding production of this session
of Congress.
But even without such a confrontation of views, there are in
General Eisenhower’s letter to Representative Halleck two very
large and very important statements of policy. One is that the
defense budget can be reduced down to something like the last
Eisenhower defense budget for fiscal 1962. General Eisenhower
does not support, because he thinks it unnecessary, the Kennedy
enlargement of our strategic and of our conventional forces. It
would be interesting to hear him argue, not merely assert, this
very important proposition.
General Eisenhower’s second difference of policy is on the
program to put a man on the moon and get him back again
before 1970. This is, as he says, a crash program which is spec
tacular, but too costly. Here, too, is an issue which ought to be
debated.
On the first question that the defense budget should be cut
from the Kennedy level to the Eisenhower level, the General
must know that the prospects are poor. For defense, this Congress
wants to spend more, not less, than do President Kennedy and
Secretary McNamara. Congress would be horrified at going back
to the Eisenhower level. Indeed, the controversies which are
raging around the “McNamara Monarchy” all originate in his
refusal to spend money that certain officers, politicians and
contractors want to have spent.
General Eisenhower knows that. He learned it when he was
President, and his valedictory on television will long be remem
bered for its warning that “in the councils of government, we
must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.”
Believing that, General Eisenhower ought to take a long,
close look at the embattled secretary of defense, and he should
ask himself whether the root of Secretary McNamara’s ti’oubles
is not that he has the will and the know-how and the guts to
bring military spending under rational control. If Mr. McNamara
is overwhelmed, General Eisenhower can give up for lost any
serious notion that military spending will be cut back.
As to putting a man on the moon, the real question, I believe
is not whether it. is too expensive. The real question is whether
the country would support a gigantic research and scientific ex
ploration in outer space if it were not prodded by the fear that
the Russians will get to the moon first and lured by the prize
of being the first ourselves to get there. What General Eisen
hower thinks, so it seems, is that we should “demonstrate com
mon sense” about the prod and the lure. We should spend less
and take more time and let the Russians win the race to the moon
if they can afford it.
No doubt the winner in the race will have great prestige,
and, to many people the world over, he will look temporarily like
a superman. But as the first man on the moon is followed by the
second man on the moon, winning the race will be not much
more than any nine days’ wonder. Most emphatically, it will not
decide the course of history.
What does matter greatly is that, since we have the tech
nological capacity, we should promote the research and the ex
ploration into the nature of the universe. We do not know what
we shall learn when we can place our laboratories and our in
struments out beyond the envelope of the earth’s atmosphere.
But we shall know more than we can know now about the reality
of which we are a part. In physics, chemistry and biology, we
may be opening up a new world.
It is one of the melancholy facts of political life that the
good is not often sought for goodness’ sak. Men are not easily
moved to serve so great a purpose as the revolutionary increase
of knowledge. So, we have to be prodded by the fear of being
second and lured by the desire to be first.

General Eisenhower has gone on record in favor of a cut of
$lO or $l2 billion in the government’s authority to make con
tracts which will be paid for as the missiles and the ships and
the like are manufactured. While this is unlikely to make any
substantial reduction in this year’s spending, it would make a
substantial difference in later years. General Eisenhower does
not himself specify what the cut should be, being, as he says,
out of touch with the details. But he takes his figures from his
last two budget directors- —Messrs. Stans and Brundage.
Although it is not likely to happen, it would be most en
lightening if Messrs. Stans and Brundage would present their
recommendations in detail and engage in a bout of reciprocal
questioning and answering with Mr. Gordon, the present Ken
nedy budget director. Unless something of the sort can be ar
ranged, the country will be subject to conflicting assertions
which never meet head on. This will add to the befuddlement
which so far has been the outstanding production of this session
of Congress.
But even without such a confrontation of views, there are in
General Eisenhower’s letter to Representative Halleck two very
large and very important statements of policy. One is that the
defense budget can be reduced down to something like the last
Eisenhower defense budget for fiscal 1962. General Eisenhower
does not support, because he thinks it unnecessary, the Kennedy
enlargement of our strategic and of our conventional forces. It
would be interesting to hear him argue, not merely assert, this
very important proposition.
General Eisenhower’s second difference of policy is on the
program to put a man on the moon and get him back again
before 1970. This is, as he says, a crash program which is spec
tacular, but too costly. Here, too, is an issue which ought to be
debated.
On the first question that the defense budget should be cut
from the Kennedy level to the Eisenhower level, the General
must know that the prospects are poor. For defense, this Congress
wants to spend more, not less, than do President Kennedy and
Secretary McNamara. Congress would be horrified at going back
to the Eisenhower level. Indeed, the controversies which are
raging around the “McNamara Monarchy” all originate in his
refusal to spend money that certain officers, politicians and
contractors want to have spent.
General Eisenhower knows that. He learned it when he was
President, and his valedictory on television will long be remem
bered for its warning that “in the councils of government, we
must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.”
Believing that, General Eisenhower ought to take a long,
close look at the embattled secretary of defense, and he should
ask himself whether the root of Secretary McNamara’s ti’oubles
is not that he has the will and the know-how and the guts to
bring military spending under rational control. If Mr. McNamara
is overwhelmed, General Eisenhower can give up for lost any
serious notion that military spending will be cut back.
As to putting a man on the moon, the real question, I believe
is not whether it. is too expensive. The real question is whether
the country would support a gigantic research and scientific ex
ploration in outer space if it were not prodded by the fear that
the Russians will get to the moon first and lured by the prize
of being the first ourselves to get there. What General Eisen
hower thinks, so it seems, is that we should “demonstrate com
mon sense” about the prod and the lure. We should spend less
and take more time and let the Russians win the race to the moon
if they can afford it.
No doubt the winner in the race will have great prestige,
and, to many people the world over, he will look temporarily like
a superman. But as the first man on the moon is followed by the
second man on the moon, winning the race will be not much
more than any nine days’ wonder. Most emphatically, it will not
decide the course of history.
What does matter greatly is that, since we have the tech
nological capacity, we should promote the research and the ex
ploration into the nature of the universe. We do not know what
we shall learn when we can place our laboratories and our in
struments out beyond the envelope of the earth’s atmosphere.
But we shall know more than we can know now about the reality
of which we are a part. In physics, chemistry and biology, we
may be opening up a new world.
It is one of the melancholy facts of political life that the
good is not often sought for goodness’ sak. Men are not easily
moved to serve so great a purpose as the revolutionary increase
of knowledge. So, we have to be prodded by the fear of being
second and lured by the desire to be first.

General Eisenhower has gone on record in favor of a cut of
$lO or $l2 billion in the government’s authority to make con
tracts which will be paid for as the missiles and the ships and
the like are manufactured. While this is unlikely to make any
substantial reduction in this year’s spending, it would make a
substantial difference in later years. General Eisenhower does
not himself specify what the cut should be, being, as he says,
out of touch with the details. But he takes his figures from his
last two budget directors- —Messrs. Stans and Brundage.
Although it is not likely to happen, it would be most en
lightening if Messrs. Stans and Brundage would present their
recommendations in detail and engage in a bout of reciprocal
questioning and answering with Mr. Gordon, the present Ken
nedy budget director. Unless something of the sort can be ar
ranged, the country will be subject to conflicting assertions
which never meet head on. This will add to the befuddlement
which so far has been the outstanding production of this session
of Congress.
But even without such a confrontation of views, there are in
General Eisenhower’s letter to Representative Halleck two very
large and very important statements of policy. One is that the
defense budget can be reduced down to something like the last
Eisenhower defense budget for fiscal 1962. General Eisenhower
does not support, because he thinks it unnecessary, the Kennedy
enlargement of our strategic and of our conventional forces. It
would be interesting to hear him argue, not merely assert, this
very important proposition.
General Eisenhower’s second difference of policy is on the
program to put a man on the moon and get him back again
before 1970. This is, as he says, a crash program which is spec
tacular, but too costly. Here, too, is an issue which ought to be
debated.
On the first question that the defense budget should be cut
from the Kennedy level to the Eisenhower level, the General
must know that the prospects are poor. For defense, this Congress
wants to spend more, not less, than do President Kennedy and
Secretary McNamara. Congress would be horrified at going back
to the Eisenhower level. Indeed, the controversies which are
raging around the “McNamara Monarchy” all originate in his
refusal to spend money that certain officers, politicians and
contractors want to have spent.
General Eisenhower knows that. He learned it when he was
President, and his valedictory on television will long be remem
bered for its warning that “in the councils of government, we
must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.”
Believing that, General Eisenhower ought to take a long,
close look at the embattled secretary of defense, and he should
ask himself whether the root of Secretary McNamara’s ti’oubles
is not that he has the will and the know-how and the guts to
bring military spending under rational control. If Mr. McNamara
is overwhelmed, General Eisenhower can give up for lost any
serious notion that military spending will be cut back.
As to putting a man on the moon, the real question, I believe
is not whether it. is too expensive. The real question is whether
the country would support a gigantic research and scientific ex
ploration in outer space if it were not prodded by the fear that
the Russians will get to the moon first and lured by the prize
of being the first ourselves to get there. What General Eisen
hower thinks, so it seems, is that we should “demonstrate com
mon sense” about the prod and the lure. We should spend less
and take more time and let the Russians win the race to the moon
if they can afford it.
No doubt the winner in the race will have great prestige,
and, to many people the world over, he will look temporarily like
a superman. But as the first man on the moon is followed by the
second man on the moon, winning the race will be not much
more than any nine days’ wonder. Most emphatically, it will not
decide the course of history.
What does matter greatly is that, since we have the tech
nological capacity, we should promote the research and the ex
ploration into the nature of the universe. We do not know what
we shall learn when we can place our laboratories and our in
struments out beyond the envelope of the earth’s atmosphere.
But we shall know more than we can know now about the reality
of which we are a part. In physics, chemistry and biology, we
may be opening up a new world.
It is one of the melancholy facts of political life that the
good is not often sought for goodness’ sak. Men are not easily
moved to serve so great a purpose as the revolutionary increase
of knowledge. So, we have to be prodded by the fear of being
second and lured by the desire to be first.
