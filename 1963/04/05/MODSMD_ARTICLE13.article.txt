# PEACE CORPS LETTER
## India: Land of Many Contrasts 
### 
(Editors’ Note: The following letter is from Robert Ishi
waka, a Stanford graduate now in the Peace Corps in India.)
Two of us are working in the Geology Department here at
Osmania University in Hydrabad. These ancient granitic plains
in the heart of the Indian Peninsula are a world apart from the
misty shores of Seattle, where less than a year ago I was study
ing Marine Geology at the University of Washington.
We are here because Dr. Reddi, the Vice-Chancellor of Os
mania, invited the Peace Corps to come to his university. His
goals are admirable. He is devoted to the task of improving the
quality of higher education in his country and to the making of
his students into socially responsible citizens. We hope that we
can help.
What has been my reaction to India?
The contrasts here in India are summed up in my mind when
I recall a stroll taken through the old bazaars within (he walls of
Jaipur, the “Rose-Pink City,” during our first weeks of travel.
I was still very much the obvious “videshii,” or foreigner.
Walking through the incredibly fascinating bazaar alleys, un
changed for perhaps hundreds of years, a feeling of disgust
welled up in me when I barely missed stepping on the decaying
remains of a rat lying in the center of a dung heap. But going
on, and turning a corner, I came across a spotlessly white wall,
glowing brilliantly in the intense Indian sunlight. Across this
luminous facade strutted an iridescent peacock. I forgot about
the rat. This is the way it has been with our daily lives here.
We have our frustrations and disappointments, but our unex
pected successes, new friendships, and illuminating experiences
have been a source of great satisfaction to us.
During our first few months in India we have experienced
the reaction of this country to a national emergency, the ten
sions of a university student riot involving caste, religion, and
politics, and now, we are in the midst of a local cholera epi
demic. At the same time, I have thoroughly enjoyed immersing
myself in the rich culture of India from wandering on the steps
of the sacred ghats of Benares on the Holy River Ganges to
sampling a delicious homecooked Indian meal at. the home of
a student.
I am learning the art of diplomacy. The man who is to be
the new acting head of our department has just arrived. Art
Christensen, the other PCV working in the Geology department,
and I, are probably the only PCV’s in the entire Peace Corps who
will have a bona-fide Russian as an immediate supervisor. I
think that he is as surprised to have us as we are to have him.
But science easily transcends political barriers, and we are ex
pecting to share our new experiences in India together. After
all, we have a major purpose in common—to be of some con
structive use here in India.
Being the only Oriental-American PCV in India puts me in
a rather unique situation. Many Indians cannot believe that I am
really a third-generation American. I have even been carted off
to a police station by a mob accusing me of being a Chinese
Communist spy ... I now watch the Sino-Indian border situa
tion as the people in Japan must watch their volcanic activity
reports. But I am glad that I am here. My presence seems to
have brought many Indians to the realization that Americans are
not a race, but a group of diverse peoples dedicated to certain
common ideals. The superficial stereotype of an American is
being changed.
India’s is a tradition-directed society. At first. I was rather
startled to learn that a graduate student in Geophysics, a highly
educated individual, would consider it his duty to enter a pre
arranged marriage within caste, the exact auspicious minute of
the wedding even being set by an astrologer according to the
position of the planets.
But we have come to understand that what has endured for
a millennium cannot be changed in a day. Mother India is play
ing her subtle tricks on us. She is changing us far more than
we can ever hope to change her. When I return home, I will have
to call myself an Indianized Japanese-American. A complicated
state of affairs, but I will be all the richer for the experience.
India is changing me—lndia is changing all of us here. The
Peace Corps is evolving a new brand of American, and he’s not
an Ugly One.
