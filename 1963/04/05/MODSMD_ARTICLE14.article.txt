Editors, The Daily:
I’m a law student. Every day on my way from the dorm
I’m reminded by a yellow and black sign that nuclear was is a
possibility. Over at the law school I walk past 250,000 survival
crackers about six times a day. There’s also about twenty
empty containers that look like the beginning of a steel band.
Freedom might be expensive in the future, it’s been that way
in the past.
It’s impossible to picture what the consequences of the war
around the corner would be like. It’s also hard to imagine an
America without backbone. Which is more likely to happen?
“Our only shelter is peace.” Who’s kidding who? If we want
to talk about allocation of resources I might be persuaded
against shelters. Security has always cost us. Right now in rela
tive peace time it’s costing billions. A few years ago security
cost plenty of lives as well as money. Peace is a result of secur
ity. not a tool of achieving it. If shelters, or that phase of civil
defense which seeks to protect the population in the event of
war, prove to be too costly for the security achieved, then scrap
them.
At any rate I’m not persuaded that the shelter program
here or anywhere will do anything but make us more aware of
what the costs of peace are. If I decide that freedom is too
expensive then I’ll let peace by my shelter. Until then, or when
Hell freezes, I have a belief that peace will more likely be
achieved by letting the Ruskys know that we’re dug in. It lends
an air of seriousness, if it be necessary, to our readiness to use
our missiles and soldiers to protect our country and to fight for
what we stand for. Thomas Elden
Editors, The Daily:
I am completely opposed to the anti-fallout shelter proposi
tions set forth by the Peace Caucus members and the “Staff
Opinion” as expressed by Mr. Pell Fender.
It is my firm conviction through training received during
my military service that an informed public has an excellent
chance of surviving a nuclear attack provided measures such as
the construction and stocking of adequate shelters are carried
out in advance of any such attack. I believe that the attitude
expressed by the Peace Caucus members denies the will to sur
vive. This will to survive has been consistently demonstrated
historically by people during time of war and is demonstrated
every day in hospitals and at scenes of natural disasters. Few
people want to die. If there is one student who desires that he
be given the opportunity to survive, if a nuclear attack should
occur, that student has a right to that opportunity. The Peace
Caucus members would deny that right by dismantling the
shelters.
The Peace Caucus members have said that the research of
shelters reduces the will to seek peace. Can the absence of exist
ence of shelters make the prospect of nuclear war any more or
less deplorable? No. However, the absence of shelters, inter
preted as a sign of weakness or an attitude of defeatism and
representing a very real state of unpreparedness could make a
nuclear war more probable.
In the event of a nuclear attack it should comfort the Peace
Caucus members and the students who signed the letter to Presi
dent Sterling to know that it is highly unlikely that anyone will
force them to accept shelter space. Donald G. McKinnon
Editors, The Daily;
Those who are confident that a shelter program can protect
American lives and. consequently, the American nation and its
ideals, should bear in mind that the psychological and spiritual
destruction following a nuclear war will be more significant
even than the physical destruction.
Freedom and Democracy assume a somewhat rational,
peaceful, and relatively prosperous populace. Two weeks in a
shelter, in darkness, doubt, and want, will be a psychological
trial which is incomprehensible to us and very likely unbearable
for all but the most calloused mind. Emerging from our shelters
will come a small band of hysterical, lonely, lost people. They
will find a world of silence and death. The human mind, which
functions on the assumption that there is order and purpose in
the world, will not be able to survive the isolation and the chaos.
Those who argue with statistics (fifty or a hundred million
will survive, they happily assert) are counting on fifty or a
hundred million sane and eager people to rebuild their smashed
world. They are counting their chickens before they’re hatched.
They would be wiser to expect scrambled eggs. Eugene Himn

Editors, The Daily;
Those who are confident that a shelter program can protect
American lives and. consequently, the American nation and its
ideals, should bear in mind that the psychological and spiritual
destruction following a nuclear war will be more significant
even than the physical destruction.
Freedom and Democracy assume a somewhat rational,
peaceful, and relatively prosperous populace. Two weeks in a
shelter, in darkness, doubt, and want, will be a psychological
trial which is incomprehensible to us and very likely unbearable
for all but the most calloused mind. Emerging from our shelters
will come a small band of hysterical, lonely, lost people. They
will find a world of silence and death. The human mind, which
functions on the assumption that there is order and purpose in
the world, will not be able to survive the isolation and the chaos.
Those who argue with statistics (fifty or a hundred million
will survive, they happily assert) are counting on fifty or a
hundred million sane and eager people to rebuild their smashed
world. They are counting their chickens before they’re hatched.
They would be wiser to expect scrambled eggs. Eugene Himn
Editors, The Daily:
I’m a law student. Every day on my way from the dorm
I’m reminded by a yellow and black sign that nuclear was is a
possibility. Over at the law school I walk past 250,000 survival
crackers about six times a day. There’s also about twenty
empty containers that look like the beginning of a steel band.
Freedom might be expensive in the future, it’s been that way
in the past.
It’s impossible to picture what the consequences of the war
around the corner would be like. It’s also hard to imagine an
America without backbone. Which is more likely to happen?
“Our only shelter is peace.” Who’s kidding who? If we want
to talk about allocation of resources I might be persuaded
against shelters. Security has always cost us. Right now in rela
tive peace time it’s costing billions. A few years ago security
cost plenty of lives as well as money. Peace is a result of secur
ity. not a tool of achieving it. If shelters, or that phase of civil
defense which seeks to protect the population in the event of
war, prove to be too costly for the security achieved, then scrap
them.
At any rate I’m not persuaded that the shelter program
here or anywhere will do anything but make us more aware of
what the costs of peace are. If I decide that freedom is too
expensive then I’ll let peace by my shelter. Until then, or when
Hell freezes, I have a belief that peace will more likely be
achieved by letting the Ruskys know that we’re dug in. It lends
an air of seriousness, if it be necessary, to our readiness to use
our missiles and soldiers to protect our country and to fight for
what we stand for. Thomas Elden
Editors, The Daily:
I am completely opposed to the anti-fallout shelter proposi
tions set forth by the Peace Caucus members and the “Staff
Opinion” as expressed by Mr. Pell Fender.
It is my firm conviction through training received during
my military service that an informed public has an excellent
chance of surviving a nuclear attack provided measures such as
the construction and stocking of adequate shelters are carried
out in advance of any such attack. I believe that the attitude
expressed by the Peace Caucus members denies the will to sur
vive. This will to survive has been consistently demonstrated
historically by people during time of war and is demonstrated
every day in hospitals and at scenes of natural disasters. Few
people want to die. If there is one student who desires that he
be given the opportunity to survive, if a nuclear attack should
occur, that student has a right to that opportunity. The Peace
Caucus members would deny that right by dismantling the
shelters.
The Peace Caucus members have said that the research of
shelters reduces the will to seek peace. Can the absence of exist
ence of shelters make the prospect of nuclear war any more or
less deplorable? No. However, the absence of shelters, inter
preted as a sign of weakness or an attitude of defeatism and
representing a very real state of unpreparedness could make a
nuclear war more probable.
In the event of a nuclear attack it should comfort the Peace
Caucus members and the students who signed the letter to Presi
dent Sterling to know that it is highly unlikely that anyone will
force them to accept shelter space. Donald G. McKinnon
