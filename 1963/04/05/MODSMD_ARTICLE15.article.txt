## 'Fundamental Standard' Expression Of University's Faith in Students 
### SALLY PAYTON 
Stanford students are fond of
pleading a bewildered innocence
when faced with questions involv
ing the Fundamental Standard.
This deliberate ignorance of the
principle which informs the
whole body of university regula
tions and procedures approaches
a cowardly withdrawal from the
responsibility of mature and in
telligent people to evaluate both
their own standards and the stan
dards of the community in which
they find themselves.
It is inconceivable that anyone
who reads the Fundamental Stan-
I dard should not understand it.
The Fundamental Standard is a
clear and lucid expression of the
University’s faith that the behav
ior of Stanford students is char
acterized by an intelligent ap
praisal of what constitutes ma-
I turo and reasonable action. It is
an affirmation of a faith that
Stanford students are or are try
ing to become, adults.
The implementation of the Fun
damental Standard is the area of
greatest controversy and greatest
misunderstanding. Because it is
such a general statement, the
Standard must be uncodified; an
attempt to inject a set of rules
into the Standard itself would
undermine its basis of personal
honor. But there is nothing occult
about the discernment of viola
tions of the Standard and the dis
crimination between degrees of
these violations.
The variation in personal stan
dards makes it impossible to list
unequivocally any but the most
obvious violations of the Funda
mental Standard. But the fact
that the Standard permits wide
diversity of interpretation is one
of its most admirable features.
Because it is a broad statement,
it is possible for anyone who con
siders himself a principled person
to accept it as a base criterion.
Because of this flexibility, the
usefulness of the Fundamental
Standard may survive changing
conceptions of its practical imple
mentation. The flexibility which
is a part of the Fundamental
Standard is built into its “en
forcement.” While this makes it
often impossible to predict the
penalty for a given offense, it
makes possible a greater practi
cability in the adjustment of pen
alties than would be possible un
der a more rigid system.
The functions of the student
judiciary bodies which enforce
the Fundamental Standard have
been almost universally misun
derstood and misrepresented; the
j most vocal criticisms have come
■ from those who have the least
I understanding of the problems in-
I volved. It is most important to
j realize that the Fundamental
I Standard is not a “University
1 Policy” imposed from above; it
is a general statement of princi
ples which every Stanford stu
dent should have acquired before
he came.
The fact that only a minute per
j centage of Stanford students ever
faces suspension is an indication
that the Fundamental Standard
is in fact built into our attitude
towards ourselves and towards
I the university. A moment of in
j tense examination of one’s own
| individual standards of behavior
and one’s basis for evaluating the
actions of others should reveal a
quite basic agreement with the
! Fundamental Standard. To con
| tinue to regard with naive per
plexity or determined ignorance
questions involving such a basic
principle of action is to deny that
ethical standards are meaningful:
! it is to deny that a part of
I education is the formulation of
| one’s own standards.
