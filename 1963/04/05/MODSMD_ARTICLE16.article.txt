Editors, The Daily:
The recent controversy over the
civil defense shelter program on
the Stanford Campus impells me
to the following observations:
The “identification” of shelter
space for 6800 persons and the
promise of 5000 “second phase
shelters with slightly lower pro
tection” will remain an empty
reassurance and a waste of the
taxpayer’s money if the program
is not conceived of as it would
actually operate under conditions
of nuclear attack. From this point
of view I would like to raise the
pressing question of the pro
strike allocation of shelter space.
After the critical period of the
first phase when there are only
6800 units for some 9.600 students
and their accumulated waste, the
additional 5000 units “with slight
ly lower protection” might seem
to provide protection for all.
However the approximately 5000
members of the Stanford Faculty
and Staff are surely worthy of
some consideration if only by rea
son of their easy access to the
shelters. There is the additional
very large proximate population
of residents on University prop
erty, families of faculty, transi
ents, visitors to the Hoover Tow
er, temporary employees, and
residents of nearby suburbs that
will add to the pressure for space.
Therefore it is in the calm of
the pre-strike period that one
should consider the priority list
for the allocation of shelter space,
A rational priority list should
take account of the real difficul
ties in excluding certain groups
as W'ell as of those groups whose
survival would be most appropri
ate to the post-strike period. The
following briefly annotated list
is of course only a paradigm for
the more systematic allocations
we can eventually expect:
1. Administrative personnel:
Because the post-strike Peninsula
Disaster Area will require skilled
organizers and because of diffi
culties of exclusion, it might be
argued that not all of the
Deans, Associate Deans, Assis
tant Deans and Administrative
Assistants would be equally neces
sary in the radically simplified
post-strike environment.
2. The entire School of Medi
cine including students: Self-evi
dent, even though the local em
phasis on research may appreci
ably reduce the potential contri
butions of the surviving medical
and quasi-medical personnel.
3. Guards: An indispensable
and fairly sizeable category over
looked in superficial analysis.
One must assume that irrational
response of the EXPOP might
render the shelters unusable for
tic to suppose that the large num

everyone. However it is unrealis
ber of armed men necessary to
deny shelters to this supernu
merary population will function
effectively without the clear as
surance of shelter space.
4. The School of Engineering
faculty and students witli at least
a B average: if it were practica
ble some preference might be
given to specialists in simple me
chanics and sanitary engineering.
5. Building and grounds per
sonnel: Indicated by unillusioned
projections. Many enjoy proximi
ty to shelters, some will have
knowledge of air vents that could
be stuffed by anyone whose ex
clusion bred resentment.
6. Students: Templing to allow
operation of Darwinian process
that would enable strongest and
most adaptable to greet post
strike era. However this might
so crowd entrances as to upset
orderly application of priorities.
7. Select individuals from off
campus: Leaders of Palo Alto
service organizations for exam
ple -so that the University might
maintain the tradition of fruitful
relations with the local commu
nity.
This list can be refined, and ex
tended, as more and more, bigger
and bigger, deeper and deeper
shelters are built until such time
as everyone, even including ele
ments so little adequate to post
strike necessities as Professors
in the Humanities can be provid
ed for.

However the approximately 5000
members of the Stanford Faculty

some consideration if only by rea

shelters. There is the additional
very large proximate population
of residents on University prop
erty, families of faculty, transi
ents, visitors to the Hoover Tow
er, temporary employees, and
residents of nearby suburbs that
will add to the pressure for space.
Therefore it is in the calm of
the pre-strike period that one
should consider the priority list
for the allocation of shelter space,
A rational priority list should
take account of the real difficul

the more systematic allocations

Because the post-strike Peninsula
Disaster Area will require skilled
organizers and because of diffi
culties of exclusion, it might be
argued that not all of the
Deans, Associate Deans, Assis
tant Deans and Administrative
Assistants would be equally neces
sary in the radically simplified
post-strike environment.
2. The entire School of Medi
cine including students: Self-evi
dent, even though the local em
phasis on research may appreci
ably reduce the potential contri
butions of the surviving medical
and quasi-medical personnel.
3. Guards: An indispensable
and fairly sizeable category over
looked in superficial analysis.

4. The School of Engineering
faculty and students witli at least
a B average: if it were practica

given to specialists in simple me
chanics and sanitary engineering.
5. Building and grounds per

The recent controversy over the
civil defense shelter program on
the Stanford Campus impells me
to the following observations:
The “identification” of shelter
space for 6800 persons and the
promise of 5000 “second phase
shelters with slightly lower pro
tection” will remain an empty
reassurance and a waste of the
taxpayer’s money if the program
is not conceived of as it would
actually operate under conditions
of nuclear attack. From this point
of view I would like to raise the
pressing question of the pro
strike allocation of shelter space.
After the critical period of the
first phase when there are only
6800 units for some 9.600 students
and their accumulated waste, the
additional 5000 units “with slight
ly lower protection” might seem
to provide protection for all.
