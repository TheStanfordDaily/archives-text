# Lonberg, Sutherland To Pitch Against Cal Poly
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford’s brash young baseball
team has three tough games this
weekend. The Indians face Cal
Poly of Pomona three times at
Sunken Diamond. Today’s game
starts at 3 p.m., while tomorrow
the two teams play a double
header starting at I p.m.
The Indians now stand 11-4 over
the entire season and 0-2 in CIBA
competition.
DUTCH FKHKING plans to use
his best pitchers against Pomona.
Jim Lonborg, 3-3 on the season
with all three losses in very close
games, gets the nod to start this
afternoon. Lonborg has had a
career of tough luck at Stanford,
and the latest in his string of bad
breaks came a week ago today,
when USC beat him 2-1 in 11 in
nings on an error.
Saturday will see Darrell Suth
erland, recently turned loose on
the basball diamond after basket
ball season ended, opposes Poly
in the nine inning opening game
of the double-header. Sutherland
last year was Stanford’s best
moundsman with a string of 20-
2/3 scoreless innings, including a
shutout over the powerful Air
Force Academy.
In the seven inning nightcap,
Fehring will start either Dick
Kovacevich (4-0) or Warren New
ell. Both pitched well Tuesday,
with Kovacevich throwing seven
scoreless innings against UOP
and allowing only two hits, and
Newell hurling a pair of hitless
frames,
THE REST of the lineup will
be the same as it’s been all year.
The infield will consist of Bob
Hollmann at first, George Thach
er at second, Joel Shulman at
shortstop and Gary Smith at third.
In the outfield will he Greg
Post, Stanford’s leading hitter at
.389, Bobby Cox and Newell. If
Newell pitches, the third outfield
er will be chosen from among Jim
Chenu, Dave Stout and Bob Wall.
Fehring has a problem at catch
er, where he wants all three of
his receivers. However Buzz
Riegel hurt his elbow during the
UOP game and probably won’t

play. Jim Seckler and Chuck
French will divide the back-stop
ping chores.
FEHRING is confident that his
young hall-players will shake
their CIBA batting slump and
provide enough runs to support
the excellent pitching and more
than adequate defense. The In
dians showed indications Tuesday
that they may do this. A good
weekend series against Cal Poly
would be a further indication that
such is the case.

of the double-header. Sutherland
last year was Stanford’s best
moundsman with a string of 20-
2/3 scoreless innings, including a
shutout over the powerful Air
Force Academy.
In the seven inning nightcap,
Fehring will start either Dick
Kovacevich (4-0) or Warren New
ell. Both pitched well Tuesday,
with Kovacevich throwing seven
scoreless innings against UOP
and allowing only two hits, and
Newell hurling a pair of hitless
frames,
THE REST of the lineup will
be the same as it’s been all year.
The infield will consist of Bob
Hollmann at first, George Thach
er at second, Joel Shulman at
shortstop and Gary Smith at third.
In the outfield will he Greg
Post, Stanford’s leading hitter at
.389, Bobby Cox and Newell. If
Newell pitches, the third outfield
er will be chosen from among Jim
Chenu, Dave Stout and Bob Wall.
Fehring has a problem at catch
er, where he wants all three of
his receivers. However Buzz
Riegel hurt his elbow during the
UOP game and probably won’t

play. Jim Seckler and Chuck
French will divide the back-stop
ping chores.
FEHRING is confident that his
young hall-players will shake
their CIBA batting slump and
provide enough runs to support
the excellent pitching and more
than adequate defense. The In
dians showed indications Tuesday
that they may do this. A good
weekend series against Cal Poly
would be a further indication that
such is the case.
Stanford’s brash young baseball
team has three tough games this
weekend. The Indians face Cal
Poly of Pomona three times at
Sunken Diamond. Today’s game
starts at 3 p.m., while tomorrow
the two teams play a double
header starting at I p.m.
The Indians now stand 11-4 over
the entire season and 0-2 in CIBA
competition.
DUTCH FKHKING plans to use
his best pitchers against Pomona.
Jim Lonborg, 3-3 on the season
with all three losses in very close
games, gets the nod to start this
afternoon. Lonborg has had a
career of tough luck at Stanford,
and the latest in his string of bad
breaks came a week ago today,
when USC beat him 2-1 in 11 in
nings on an error.
Saturday will see Darrell Suth
erland, recently turned loose on
the basball diamond after basket
ball season ended, opposes Poly
in the nine inning opening game
of the double-header. Sutherland
