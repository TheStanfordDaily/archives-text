# Frosh Baseball Season Opens
## 
### JIM DONOVAN 
The freshman baseball team,
led by pitcher Terry Docken and
catcher Jimmy Hibbs, opens its
season this weekend against El
Camino High School of South San
Francisco Friday afternoon at 3
o’clock and Mills High School of
Millbrae, Saturday at 2:30 p.m.
Both games will be played on the
Freshman field adjacent to the
Sunken diamond.
Righthander Docken, the top
freshman pitcher, though not
overpoweringly fast has a good
fastball, an excellent curve and
remarkable control for a young
pitcher. From the Los Angeles
area, Docken was named all GIF
player of the year his last two
seasons.
Docken will start against El
Camino. Coach Ray Young has
picked Dick Conway from North
ridge, the number two pitcher, to
go against Mills High.
HIBBS is not only the starting
catcher but the top hitter, for
power and average, on the squad.
Behind the plate, he is excellent
defensively, handling his pitchers
well, and has a strong, accurate
arm. At the plate, the 5-11 185
pound Hibbs is a powerful right
handed batter. By last fall he had
offers from several major league
Clubs.
Behind Docken and Conway the
squad is deep and balanced in
pitching talent. The freshman left
handers are Alan Oppenheimer
from Winnetka, 111., Lon Ray
mond from Saratoga and Ron
Yett from Anaheim. The right
handers include Bryant Scott
(Cleveland, Ohio) and John Ma
son (Pasadena).
COACH YOUNG expects the
rest of the team to be excellent
defensively, and quick on the
bases, hut is somewhat apprehen
sive about its ability to hit con
sistently. The power department
is also a problem, since the mem
bers of the equad are predomi
nantly small in stature.
Young calls keystoner Nick Lov
rich and shortstop Doug Shaw
“potentially the best double-play
combination I’ve had here.” Tom
Malzer, a good hitter, will be at
third and first will be shared by
Ken Sevcik and John Stashak.
Young has four outfielders
whom he will platoon, Bruce
Chatley, Cliff Harris, Ted Litch
field and Logan Dugaw.
If the team can muster enough
hitting to support its fine pitch
ing and defense, Coach Young and
the squad may well complete a
successful season.
