# Stanford Favored to Win Track Meet Despite Rush Week Enervation
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Coach Payton Jordan confident
j ly leads his Stanford track team
to Los Angeles this weekend for
a triangular meet against UCLA
and Occidental College in West
wood. His confidence is justified
as the dope sheet predicts victory
for Stanford in the triangular
meet by about 10 points and in
each of the dual meets by 10 to
15 points .
“I’d like to win them by more
than that, though,” said Jordan.
“We’re one of the best dual meet
teams in the country and possibly
the best on the Coast. Only one
team (San Jose Statei has beaten
us, and we've lied and beaten
them in triangular meets.” How
ever, he added pessimistically that
the stress and strain and dissipa
tion of rush week may handicap
the Indians’ performances.
The dual meet with UCLA is
Stanford's first competition in the
AAWU this season. However, the
AAWU track and field standings
are determined solely by the com
petition in the AAWU champion
ships, held at the end of the sea
son, and are not influenced by
the results of dual meets between
individual league members. Simi
larly, league record performances
can be made only in the champion
ship meet, not in dual meets.
THE FEATURE event of the
meet tomorrow will be the mile
run, featuring three of the best
collegiate milers in the country.
Stanford’s Harry McCalla is fa
vored to win; he ran the fastest
mile of his career last week, beat
ing SJS’s Ben Tucker in 4:04.4.
He’ll need another outstanding
performance to beat Tom Webb
of UCLA and Leßoy Neal of Oxy
who have run 4:05.1 and 4:05.4
this year.
Although McCalla has been
doubling most of the year by also
running the 880 or two-mile, he
will compete tomorrow only in
the mile, “unless we need th e
points in the other races,” accord
ing to Jordan. “I'd rather save
him so he can double in the big
Oregon and USC meets coming
up.”
Another high-caliber event will
be the 100 yard-dash. The co-fa
vorites are Oxy’s Steve Haas and
UCLA’s Arnold Tripp, both of
whom have 9.6 marks. Stanford’s
best hope is Larry Questad, who
ran 9.7, last week. He will un
doubtedly be pressed by UCLA’s
Len Dobson, also a 9.7 sprinter.
IN THE Discus, Stanford’s
NCAA record holder, Dave Weill,
will meet some worthy competi
tion for the first time this year.
Weill has been recovering
from an injury but has won easily
while steadily improving his dis
tance, which is currently at 179-

10. Oxy’s John McGrath has
thrown 178-2, and hopefully will
spur Weill on to greater achieve
ments. McGrath's best perform
ance, however, will come in the
shot put, where his top mark is
60-414, well beyond the rest of the
field.
Probably the most outstanding
performer on the field tomorrow
will he C. K. Yang. The Olympic
decathlon runner-up is listed by
UCLA publicity for competition
in six events. But he’ll probably

concentrate on the pole vault (16-
O'it, broad jump (23-114), and
high hurdles (14.G),
FOR STANFORD, other note
worthy competitors will be Paul
Schlicke, 9:01.0 in the two-mile;
Dan Moore, recently recovered
from a leg injury and medically
sound for the broad jump; Steve
Cortright, Stanford’s top point
getter. from competition in both
hurdle races and the triple jump;
and Phil Whit e, 15-foot pole
vaulter.


THESE TWO SOPHOMORE SPEEDSTERS are expected to win several
points in tomorrow's Stanford-UCLA-Occidental track meet. Bruin
Len Dobson (left), shown ambling out of his starting blocks, competes in the dashes in 9,7 and 21.0 respectively and Indian Paul
Schlicke is favored in the two-mile (9:01.0).

up.”
Another high-caliber event will
be the 100 yard-dash. The co-fa
vorites are Oxy’s Steve Haas and
UCLA’s Arnold Tripp, both of
whom have 9.6 marks. Stanford’s
best hope is Larry Questad, who
ran 9.7, last week. He will un
doubtedly be pressed by UCLA’s
Len Dobson, also a 9.7 sprinter.
IN THE Discus, Stanford’s
NCAA record holder, Dave Weill,
will meet some worthy competi
tion for the first time this year.
Weill has been recovering
from an injury but has won easily
while steadily improving his dis
tance, which is currently at 179-

10. Oxy’s John McGrath has
thrown 178-2, and hopefully will
spur Weill on to greater achieve
ments. McGrath's best perform
ance, however, will come in the
shot put, where his top mark is
60-414, well beyond the rest of the
field.
Probably the most outstanding
performer on the field tomorrow
will he C. K. Yang. The Olympic
decathlon runner-up is listed by
UCLA publicity for competition
in six events. But he’ll probably

concentrate on the pole vault (16-
O'it, broad jump (23-114), and
high hurdles (14.G),
FOR STANFORD, other note
worthy competitors will be Paul
Schlicke, 9:01.0 in the two-mile;
Dan Moore, recently recovered
from a leg injury and medically
sound for the broad jump; Steve
Cortright, Stanford’s top point
getter. from competition in both
hurdle races and the triple jump;
and Phil Whit e, 15-foot pole
vaulter.


THESE TWO SOPHOMORE SPEEDSTERS are expected to win several
points in tomorrow's Stanford-UCLA-Occidental track meet. Bruin
Len Dobson (left), shown ambling out of his starting blocks, competes in the dashes in 9,7 and 21.0 respectively and Indian Paul
Schlicke is favored in the two-mile (9:01.0).

Coach Payton Jordan confident
j ly leads his Stanford track team
to Los Angeles this weekend for
a triangular meet against UCLA
and Occidental College in West
wood. His confidence is justified
as the dope sheet predicts victory
for Stanford in the triangular
meet by about 10 points and in
each of the dual meets by 10 to
15 points .
“I’d like to win them by more
than that, though,” said Jordan.
“We’re one of the best dual meet
teams in the country and possibly
the best on the Coast. Only one
team (San Jose Statei has beaten
us, and we've lied and beaten
them in triangular meets.” How
ever, he added pessimistically that
the stress and strain and dissipa
tion of rush week may handicap
the Indians’ performances.
The dual meet with UCLA is
Stanford's first competition in the
AAWU this season. However, the
AAWU track and field standings
are determined solely by the com
petition in the AAWU champion
ships, held at the end of the sea
son, and are not influenced by
the results of dual meets between
individual league members. Simi
larly, league record performances
can be made only in the champion
ship meet, not in dual meets.
THE FEATURE event of the
meet tomorrow will be the mile
run, featuring three of the best
collegiate milers in the country.
Stanford’s Harry McCalla is fa
vored to win; he ran the fastest
mile of his career last week, beat
ing SJS’s Ben Tucker in 4:04.4.
He’ll need another outstanding
performance to beat Tom Webb
of UCLA and Leßoy Neal of Oxy
who have run 4:05.1 and 4:05.4
this year.
Although McCalla has been
doubling most of the year by also
running the 880 or two-mile, he
will compete tomorrow only in
the mile, “unless we need th e
points in the other races,” accord
ing to Jordan. “I'd rather save
him so he can double in the big
Oregon and USC meets coming
up.”
