Against USC and UCLA (he re
sults may be a little different.
Both schools have a collection of
some of the best players in the
country including Mexico’s Davis

Cup star Rafael Osuna, American
Davis Cupper Dennis Ralston,
tenth ranked Charlie Passarell,
and Norway’s top star, Thorvald
Moe.
COACH 808 RENKKR does
not discount Stanford’s chances,
saying however that, “if we win,
it would have to be an upset.”
Stanford is currently unbeaten in
five matches, this year, but both
UCLA and USC are also unbeaten,
and both schools have long win
ning streaks against the Indians,
UCLA's going back to the 1940’5.
USC’s top six include Osuna,
winner of the NCAA singles and
doubles last year; Ralston, Na
tional Indoor singles champion;
Charlie Eddlefson, 20th nationally,
Bill Bond, 11th nationally: Ram
sey Earnhart, 26th nationally and
NCAA doubles winner; and Char
lie Rombeau. one of the top left
handers in the country.
UCLA, who finished second to
the Trojans in both the AAWU
and NCAA championships last
year, lacks the name players of
their cross town rivals, but also
has its share of nationally
ranked players. Pasarell was
ranked tenth at the start of the
season and Arthur Ashe, 18th
nationally, is probably the best
Negro in the history of the sport.
The varsity tennis squad runs
into its first tough test of the
season this weekend, traveling to
