Rhodes Scholarship from his
homo state of Indiana, and a
career as assistant professor of
Political Science at St. Mary’s
College, Notre Dame, Indiana. In
his capacity as a politician, Bran
demas has kept a close relation
ship with education. He was a
member of the House Education
and Labor Committee visiting Po
land in 1962, Chairman of the
Advisory Group on Higher Edu
cation, member of the Subcom
mittee visiting the Soviet Union
to study the Soviet educational
system, and member of the two

opponents as Republican Senator
Barry Goldwater and Teamster
boss Jimmy Hof fa,” according to

about him.

Marty Greenwald, chairman of

ference, said, “Brandemas is one
of the most outstanding congress
men in Washington. He is one of
the most influential because of
his intimate connection with the
Kennedy administration.” Contin
uing Greenwald said, “Ho has a
reputation for articulation and
excellent speech. Students at
tending can expect a provocative
and stimulating speech.” He
added, “We urge all Stanford
students to attend.”

delegates to the Conference will
discuss during the three days
such questions as: Why is the
United States concerned over
Latin America? Can social re
forms there bo best accomplished
by a democratic or a totalitarian
regime? Should Latin American
recipients of our aid feel obli
gated? Could the reason for U.S.
concern over Latin America be
due to the fear of growing Com
munist influence and of Castro
ism? Does the U.S. give aid for
humanitarian or political rea
sons? These problems, brought
to the fore by the military take
over in Guatemala, the flight to
Nicaragua of President Ydigoras,
and the incognito return of for
mer President Arevalo, were the
reasons for the establishment of
the Stanford Conference on the
Alliance for Progress.

John Brandemas, Representative from Indiana, will give the
opening address, open to the public, of the Institute of Interna
tional Relations High School Conference on Alliance for Progress,
3:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Brandemas, now serving his third term in Congress, will ad-

dress more than two hundred

schools throughout California.
His topic will be, “The Alliance
and Higher Education.”
Brandemas’ personal back
ground in higher education in
cludes graduation magna cum
laude from Harvard, membership
in Phi Beta Kappa, a Ph D. from
Oxford University through a
Rhodes Scholarship from his
homo state of Indiana, and a
career as assistant professor of
Political Science at St. Mary’s
College, Notre Dame, Indiana. In
his capacity as a politician, Bran
demas has kept a close relation
ship with education. He was a
member of the House Education
and Labor Committee visiting Po
land in 1962, Chairman of the
Advisory Group on Higher Edu
cation, member of the Subcom
mittee visiting the Soviet Union
to study the Soviet educational
system, and member of the two
man team commissioned to visit
Argentina to study higher educa
tion in 1961.
SINCE HIS election to Con
gress, Brandemas has achieved
the reputation for being a “work
horse.” He introduced the Peace
Corps Bill and helped draft the
Juvenile Delinguency Bill. Po
litically he “has locked horns
with such rugged and disparate
opponents as Republican Senator
Barry Goldwater and Teamster
boss Jimmy Hof fa,” according to
a Saturday Evening Post article
about him.

Marty Greenwald, chairman of
the three-day high school con
ference, said, “Brandemas is one
of the most outstanding congress
men in Washington. He is one of
the most influential because of
his intimate connection with the
Kennedy administration.” Contin
uing Greenwald said, “Ho has a
reputation for articulation and
excellent speech. Students at
tending can expect a provocative
and stimulating speech.” He
added, “We urge all Stanford
students to attend.”

AFTKR BKANDEMAS’ speech
delegates to the Conference will
discuss during the three days
such questions as: Why is the
United States concerned over
Latin America? Can social re
forms there bo best accomplished
by a democratic or a totalitarian
regime? Should Latin American
recipients of our aid feel obli
gated? Could the reason for U.S.
concern over Latin America be
due to the fear of growing Com
munist influence and of Castro
ism? Does the U.S. give aid for
humanitarian or political rea
sons? These problems, brought
to the fore by the military take
over in Guatemala, the flight to
Nicaragua of President Ydigoras,
and the incognito return of for
mer President Arevalo, were the
reasons for the establishment of
the Stanford Conference on the
Alliance for Progress.
