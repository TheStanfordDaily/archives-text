## Fighting Stopped in Argentina; Soviet Rocket to Pass by Moon 
### 
United Press International

BUENOS AIRES Rebel navy commanders anchored their war
ships yesterday as rival military leaders met with President Jose M.
Guido to work out a “face-saving” revolt settlement. Navy rebel
chief fleet Rear Adm. Eladio Vazquez ordered the battle fleet to
return to moorings at the big Puerto Belgrano naval base as govern
ment troops mopped up die-hard stragglers. The Navy’s submarine
base at Mar Del Plata and its shore installations surrendered to
advancing government troop without resistance. Rebel-held radio
stations continued vowing a “fight to the death” but it was apparent
the navy withdrawal of muscle from the revolt ended any hopes of
success they might still cherish.
BUSS PROBE TO PASS MOON— MOSCOW—The official Soviet
news agency Tass said the unmanned space ship, Lunik IV, “will
pass close to the lunar surface.” The report appeared to indicate
that the 3,128-pound rocket would not hit the moon. In the absence
of any official statement from Soviet scientists on their intentions,
there had been considerable speculation that a “soft” landing on the
moon was planned.
SOVIETS THREATEN BERLIN AIR TRAFFIC— BERLIN—The
Soviets threatened action against Western private planes flying to
Berlin and the Communist East Germans demanded the right to
control all Allied traffic to the city. East Germans also instituted a
slow-down on truck traffic leaving West Berlin. U.S. Ambassador
Adlai Stevenson, on an one-day visit, pledged continuing U.S. troop
support.
FRENCH AVOID RAILROAD STRlKE— PARlS—Government and
union negotiators last night reached a compromise wage accord that
is expected to head off a threatened strike by 350,000 employes of
the state-operated railroads. The agreement was announced as fresh
walkouts gripped France and union leaders called on 200,000 striking
coal miners to return to work today under terms of a wage raise
settlement reached with the government Wednesday night. The
agreement with the rail workers provided for a 7.2 per cent wage
hike by Jan. 1, 1964. It came as railwaymen were prepared for an
indefinite strike. Occasional boos and catcalls were heard as miners
assembled throughout the coalfields to ratify Wednesday night’s
agreement with the state coal board giving them a 6.5 per cent pay
raise immediately and an eventual package boost of 12.5 per cent.
REGISTRATION MARCH HALTED— GREENWOOD, Miss—About
40 Negroes led by comedian Dick Gregory halted a voter registration
march yesterday when a police photographer started snapping
pictures they feared would be used to single out marchers for re
taliation. Gregory said the march was broken up after only five
blocks because of the possibility the photographs would be used to
Identify the demonstrators and thus pave the way for economic
reprisals and nightrlder attacks. About the time the march was in
progress a federal judge in Greenville, Miss., was agreeing to post
pone until fall a suit brought by the federal government in connec
tion with the Greenwood voter drive. The crux of the compromise
was that the government agreed to drop its request for an immedi
ate temporary restraining order barring interference with voter
registration, and the city ageed to temporarily free eight Negroes
arested during a march last week.
KING STATES DESEGREGATION DEMANDS— BIRMINGHAM
Ala. Integration leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said that a re
newed surge of racial demonstrations in the steel town would con
tinue until four desegregation demands are met. King listed the
four demands as (1) desegregation of downtown stores, (2) estab
lishment of fair hiring practices by stores, (3) dropping of all charges
against Negroes arrested in previous protests, and (4) establishment
of a biracial committee acceptable to both sides in the racial dispute.

BUENOS AIRES Rebel navy commanders anchored their war
ships yesterday as rival military leaders met with President Jose M.
Guido to work out a “face-saving” revolt settlement. Navy rebel
chief fleet Rear Adm. Eladio Vazquez ordered the battle fleet to
return to moorings at the big Puerto Belgrano naval base as govern
ment troops mopped up die-hard stragglers. The Navy’s submarine
base at Mar Del Plata and its shore installations surrendered to
advancing government troop without resistance. Rebel-held radio
stations continued vowing a “fight to the death” but it was apparent
the navy withdrawal of muscle from the revolt ended any hopes of
success they might still cherish.
BUSS PROBE TO PASS MOON— MOSCOW—The official Soviet
news agency Tass said the unmanned space ship, Lunik IV, “will
pass close to the lunar surface.” The report appeared to indicate
that the 3,128-pound rocket would not hit the moon. In the absence
of any official statement from Soviet scientists on their intentions,
there had been considerable speculation that a “soft” landing on the
moon was planned.
SOVIETS THREATEN BERLIN AIR TRAFFIC— BERLIN—The
Soviets threatened action against Western private planes flying to
Berlin and the Communist East Germans demanded the right to
control all Allied traffic to the city. East Germans also instituted a
slow-down on truck traffic leaving West Berlin. U.S. Ambassador
Adlai Stevenson, on an one-day visit, pledged continuing U.S. troop
support.
FRENCH AVOID RAILROAD STRlKE— PARlS—Government and
union negotiators last night reached a compromise wage accord that
is expected to head off a threatened strike by 350,000 employes of
the state-operated railroads. The agreement was announced as fresh
walkouts gripped France and union leaders called on 200,000 striking
coal miners to return to work today under terms of a wage raise
settlement reached with the government Wednesday night. The
agreement with the rail workers provided for a 7.2 per cent wage
hike by Jan. 1, 1964. It came as railwaymen were prepared for an
indefinite strike. Occasional boos and catcalls were heard as miners
assembled throughout the coalfields to ratify Wednesday night’s
agreement with the state coal board giving them a 6.5 per cent pay
raise immediately and an eventual package boost of 12.5 per cent.
REGISTRATION MARCH HALTED— GREENWOOD, Miss—About
40 Negroes led by comedian Dick Gregory halted a voter registration
march yesterday when a police photographer started snapping
pictures they feared would be used to single out marchers for re
taliation. Gregory said the march was broken up after only five
blocks because of the possibility the photographs would be used to
Identify the demonstrators and thus pave the way for economic
reprisals and nightrlder attacks. About the time the march was in
progress a federal judge in Greenville, Miss., was agreeing to post
pone until fall a suit brought by the federal government in connec
tion with the Greenwood voter drive. The crux of the compromise
was that the government agreed to drop its request for an immedi
ate temporary restraining order barring interference with voter
registration, and the city ageed to temporarily free eight Negroes
arested during a march last week.
KING STATES DESEGREGATION DEMANDS— BIRMINGHAM
Ala. Integration leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said that a re
newed surge of racial demonstrations in the steel town would con
tinue until four desegregation demands are met. King listed the
four demands as (1) desegregation of downtown stores, (2) estab
lishment of fair hiring practices by stores, (3) dropping of all charges
against Negroes arrested in previous protests, and (4) establishment
of a biracial committee acceptable to both sides in the racial dispute.
