# New Congress Formed; Wessel Made Speaker
## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
Nick Wessel, former Daily editor, was made acting speaker of
the newly-formed Stanford Student Congress at an open meeting
Wednesday in Bowman Alumni House. Some forty students met, at
the request of ASSU President Annin Rosencranz, to consider
implementing the machinery for collective student expression

provided by the recent statement*
of the Board of Trustees.
Said Wessel, “The Stanford
Student Congress Is a direct re
sponse to the Trustee’s liberaliza

tion of University policy regulat
ing students’ rights to voice opin
ions publicly on off-campus is
sues. Membership is open to all
registered Stanford students, and
I encourage liberals and conserv
atives alike to join.
‘‘Political Union, as an organ
of ASSU, is prohibited from ex
pressing views on off-campus is
sues under the new regulations.
The students’ recourse is to es
tablish an organization not sub
ordinate to the ASSU and there
fore permitted to take political
stands. In the last two days we
have taken that recourse.”
WHEN QUESTIONED about
the structure of the new organiza
tion, Wessel replied that no defi
nite decisions on structure had
yet been made.
“There are several possibili
ties,” he said. “The organization
could be a small group of stu
dents with aligned interests, who
want to desseminate their own
views. Certainly such groups may
form under the Trustee regula
tions. However, as the adoption
of the name ‘Stanford Student
Congress’ indicates, I think the
students that met Wednesday
night had in mind the formation
of an association with as wide a
base as possible.”
“Hopefully, the entire student
community would become in
volved. This desire is perhaps
premature, but I believe the struc
ture of SSC that evolves during
the next few weeks will adequate
ly provide for the expression of
a broad spectrum of views.”
WESSEL INDICATED that a
meeting was being scheduled for
next Wednesday at 9:30 p.m.
“Political Union has registered
the meeting. We hope to have a
debate on the fallout shelters,
perhaps between Ira Sandperl
and Dick Weinig, followed by a
discussion and a vote on appro
priate resolutions. The resolu
tions and the votes will be publi
cized in newspapers and in let
ters to individuals and agencies
concerned.”
Wessel said that the structure
of the Student Congress would
also be discussed at the meeting,
and that nominations for a per
manent presiding officer would
be accepted.

a broad spectrum of views.”
WESSEL INDICATED that a
meeting was being scheduled for
next Wednesday at 9:30 p.m.
“Political Union has registered
the meeting. We hope to have a
debate on the fallout shelters,
perhaps between Ira Sandperl
and Dick Weinig, followed by a
discussion and a vote on appro
priate resolutions. The resolu
tions and the votes will be publi
cized in newspapers and in let
ters to individuals and agencies
concerned.”
Wessel said that the structure
of the Student Congress would
also be discussed at the meeting,
and that nominations for a per
manent presiding officer would
be accepted.

Nick Wessel, former Daily editor, was made acting speaker of
the newly-formed Stanford Student Congress at an open meeting
Wednesday in Bowman Alumni House. Some forty students met, at
the request of ASSU President Annin Rosencranz, to consider
implementing the machinery for collective student expression

provided by the recent statement*
of the Board of Trustees.
Said Wessel, “The Stanford
Student Congress Is a direct re
sponse to the Trustee’s liberaliza

tion of University policy regulat
ing students’ rights to voice opin
ions publicly on off-campus is
sues. Membership is open to all
registered Stanford students, and
I encourage liberals and conserv
atives alike to join.
‘‘Political Union, as an organ
of ASSU, is prohibited from ex
pressing views on off-campus is
sues under the new regulations.
The students’ recourse is to es
tablish an organization not sub
ordinate to the ASSU and there
fore permitted to take political
stands. In the last two days we
have taken that recourse.”
WHEN QUESTIONED about
the structure of the new organiza
tion, Wessel replied that no defi
nite decisions on structure had
yet been made.
“There are several possibili
ties,” he said. “The organization
could be a small group of stu
dents with aligned interests, who
want to desseminate their own
views. Certainly such groups may
form under the Trustee regula
tions. However, as the adoption
of the name ‘Stanford Student
Congress’ indicates, I think the
students that met Wednesday
night had in mind the formation
of an association with as wide a
base as possible.”
“Hopefully, the entire student
community would become in
volved. This desire is perhaps
premature, but I believe the struc
ture of SSC that evolves during
the next few weeks will adequate
ly provide for the expression of
a broad spectrum of views.”
