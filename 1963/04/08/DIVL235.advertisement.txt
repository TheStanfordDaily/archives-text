Three things: The aroma, the flavor and the
slow, cool way Whitehall burns.

friendly aroma. That’s because Whitehall
has the best of 6 famous high grade tobac
cos in it-all working together to bring you
a smoke that’s all pleasure—mild, mellow,
deeply satisfying.

brand that active men prefer. You’ll agree,
your pipe never tasted so good.
