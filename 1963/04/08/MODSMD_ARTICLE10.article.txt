# California YR's Split; Convention Ruled Illegal
## 
### 
FRESNO (UPI) —The California Young Republican College
Federation was split yesterday after President Robert Gaston of
the state Young Republicans ruled an opposing faction has staged
an illegally constituted convention.
The convention break stemmed from Saturday night’s creden-

tials committee meeting, in which
hassles developed between back
ers of presidential candidates
Randy Siefkin of University of
California at Santa Barbara, and
Trent Dovcnney of Pepperdine
College.
SIEFKIN, backed by outgoing
President Harold Phillips of the
University of Redlands, was elect
ed to the post by nearly 300 of
the 413 delegates. Devenney, sup
ported by Gaston, was elected by
the remainder of the delegates a
couple of hours later.
Siefkin and his executive board
were empowered by delegates to
end the federation's affiliation
with the California Young Repub
licans if necessary. Several other
states have separate college
groups.
Phillips told delegates that
State GOP Chairman Caspar
Weinberger “has said he would
recognize any legitimate volun
teer organization, and we feel we
are legitimate.’’
The statement invoked unani
mous cheers by the delegates.
AFTER ALLOWING represent
atives of the CYR to sit in the
credentials session for nearly
three hours Saturday night Phil
lips and his executive board ruled
the proceedings out of order un
der the federation’s constitution.
John Pryor, CYR federation ad
visor, was reserved a seat when
the session resumed early yester
day, but did not attend because
of Gaston’s edict.
“Due to gross irregularities by
the college federation’s executive
board, coupled with that body’s
refusal to be governed by provi
sions of Its own constitution, the
parent CYR has been forced to
step in and supervise the conven
tion,” declared Gaston, who was
elected to the CYR presidency in
February with support from John
Birch Society members.
At Los Angeles in 1962 a cre
dentials committee fight resulted
in intervention of police to re
store order. A CYR trial board
ruled Phillips was officially elect
ed.
“LAST YEAR Gaston did not
have the necessary support, and
it’s the same this year,” said Siof
kin. “All this action has been en
gineered again by Gaston who
does not particularly care for
me.”
Siefkin said he was adopting “a
wait and see attitude” to assess
Gaston’s future plans for the
federation.
Gaston said the election would
be considered at the CYR’s execu
tive board meeting April 26-28 in
Santa Rosa. Since the board
members are all Gaston ap
pointees Siefkin’s election is ex
pected. to be thrown out with
Devenney recognized as federa
tion president.
THE COLLEGE federation
claims a membership of 5,000 stu
dents in more than 60 California
colleges and universities. Techni
cally the federation is an arm of
the CYR and both serve the party
as volunteer groups.
Siefkin’s political philosophy is
more moderate than that express
ed by Devenney, who has said he
agrees with Gaston on major po
litical issues.
