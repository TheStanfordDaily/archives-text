# The 						Stanford Student Congress
## 
### 
In compliance with the new regulations issued by the
Board of Trustees concerning the right of organizations to
form and speak on off-campus issues, a number of interested
students have formed the Stanford Student Congress.
The primary concern of the Congress, as described by Nils
Wessel, the speaker for the group, will be to host debates on
off-campus issues, with the purpose of publishing statements
and affecting results.
The Stanford Student Congress is the necessary product of
the I 'Diversity regulations for those students who wish to take
stands on off-campus issues. LASSU has been closed to them
and there are no other organizations on campus specifically
structured to take such action.
The Congress, it can be assumed, will consist exclusively of
those students who desire to debate on and make their opin
ions known on off-campus issues. It will be, as such, a better
forum for such discussion than LASSU was because those
who are indifferent, good or bad in itself, will not feel that
they are being improperly represented.
T he Congress must be careful, however, to contain and
service as many different opinions and attitudes as possible.
If the C Congress represents only one shade of opinion, it can
be assumed that any number of other groups, in complete
compliance with the Trusteesâ€™ regulations, would be formed
to represent all of the varied feelings and opinions that exist.
None of these small groups would be able to have any effect
or carry any weight with their resolutions. A position formu
lated under the auspices of one central body, however, which,
it is known, has been thoroughly debated with many opinions
considered, would carry a great deal more weight. Allowing
for the registration of a minority opinion would not only be
in complete keeping with the spirit of the University regu
lations, but would give a great deal more strength to the
Congress as an organization.
