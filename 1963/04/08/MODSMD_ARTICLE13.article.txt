# Bikes on Quad and 'Capt. Midnight'
## 
### 
On the Thursday of Dead Work of last quarter, an un
suspecting bicyclist rode quickly through Quad, either un
aware of or indifferent to the signs forbidding bicycle riding
on Quad.
From behind the colonnades roared Stanford’s own “Cap
tain Midnight—lights flashing and sirens screaming—to in
tercept and ticket the bewildered evil-doer.
That same morning, another boy on a bicycle was hit by
a car as it turned the corner at Alvarado and Escondido, near
the corner of the Western Civ library. He was not badly hurt
although an ambulance was called.
It would, of course, be foolish to assert that the one boy
would not have been hit by the car, if “Captain Midnight”
had been out tagging automobiles instead of bicycles. At the
same time, however, the police department motorcyclists do
have some effect in controlling traffic, and there is still the
possibility that the auto-bike accident would not have hap
pened if “Captain Midnight” had been on the streets instead
of on Quad.
1 he bicycle riding on Quad is certainly a serious problem,
and enough pedestrians have been run down to merit the
restrictions against it. But the ticketing of violators could, it
would seem, be handled as well by the student police. The
regular police department should spend its time controlling
traffic on the streets.
