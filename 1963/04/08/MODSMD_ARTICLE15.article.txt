# MOVIE REVIEW
## 'Mockingbird:' A Film to See' By JOSEPH L. JACOBS 
### 
Maycomb, Alabama, the setting of the film “To Kill a Mock
ingbird.” is a typically sleepy Southern town in the early 1930’5.
It is normally a quiet town where Scout tMary Badham) and
Jem (Philip Alford) Finch could grow up, worrying about little
more than school, cantangerous Mrs. Dußoso down the street,
and mysterious 800 Radley the town recluse who lived three
doors away.
But one summer Dill came to Maycomb. Dill (John Megna)
was the nephew of Miss Rachel—the Finch’s neighbor—and Jem
claimed that Dill’s interest in making 800 Radley come out was
responsible for the broken arm Jem had several years later. Dill
came to Maycomb each summer after that, and one summer
Atticus (Gregory Peck), Scout’s and Jem’s lawyer father, was
appointed to defend Tom Robinson, a Negro accused by Bob
Ewell, a white man, of raping his daughter.
Atticus proved Tom’s innocence in court, but the jury con
victed him nonetheless. Tom was killed trying to escape, but
even then Ewell wasn’t satisfied, and that Halloween night he
came after Scout and Jem with murder in his eye and a knife
in his hand. But just then 800 Radley came out; Scout was
able finally to meet 800, Jem got a broken arm, and Ewell got
a knife in his ribs.
“Mockingbird,” based on Harper Lee’s Pulitzer Prize win
ning novel, is a beautiful and touching film. Horton Foote’s
screenplay is basically faithful to the book, although he neces
sarily had to eliminate some episodes. Foote captures the human
ity and humor that pervaded the novel without ever becoming
trite. Russell Harlan’s black and white photography is stun
ningly effective, and complements perfectly Robert Mulligan’s
excellent direction.
Especially effective were the final walk through the woods
on Halloween night, which managed to he simultaneously fright
ening and funny, and the scene at the trial’s conclusion where
all the Negroes—segregated to the balcony-—rise in silent trib
ute as Atticus leaves the courtroom below.
Elmer Bernstein’s music also fits perfectly with (he rest of
the movie, and even the titles (designed by Stephen Frankfurt)
add to the tender and nostalgic mood.
The entire cast is also excellent. Peck provides a solid center
around which the story revolves and he carefully avoids seem
ing too righteous and moralistic. Megna, a Broadway veteran,
is delightful as the ever-curious Dill. And Alford and Miss Brad
ham, both making their professional debuts, are just perfect as
the mischievous kids.
The only real fault that can be found with the film is the
fault inherent in any movie: it is too real. When Miss Lee old
in her book of running down the sidewalk in front of the Rad
ley place, it seemed as though it were a mile and took an eter
nity. But in the movie the viewer is aware that it is only seventy
feet or so, and in spite of the rustling wind and creaking swing
it is just not as frightening. And Scout’s speech to the lynch
mob, which seemed so right in the book, simply does not come
off well in the film.
But these are minor points. “To Kill a Mockingbird,” which
will bo at the Varsity Theater until April 16, is a film to see.
