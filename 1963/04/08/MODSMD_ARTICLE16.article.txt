On registration day an ad hoe Committee of members of the
student body handed out 4,000 leaflets asking Stanford students
to sign a petition to the University protesting the establishment
of fall out shelters on campus. So far only 300 students have
signed the petition. From the discussions that were had with
some of the other students it appears that many did not feel that
nuclear war and fallout shelters were important enough to
worry about. It appears that a large number had somehow con
ditioned themselves to accept nuclear war and its consequences
as a part of their lives. Some students spoke of death and de
struction in the third person, and of nuclear war as some two
week dream that would never occur. There were others who said
that even if there were a nuclear war the potential enemy would
have no military targets near Stanford and that these bombs
would be aimed elsewhere. A large number of us have somehow
convinced ourselves that if war does come it will be the “other
of the population” that will be maimed or killed, not you and
I. Not only have we allowed ourselves to believe that it is “they”
who will suffer but we have also become naive enough to believe
that after a two-week period of time we shall emerge into the
sunlight and resume our lives as if nothing had happened.
It is time (hat we stop thinking of war in these unreal terms.
It is time that we face up to the fact that it is “we” and not some
mythical “they” who are surrounded by the largest defense com
plex in the nation. It is you and I as real human beings who will
be injured or killed in the fire that follows. It is you and I who
will watch human decency disappear in the endless miles of
chaos and death that will be left in the aftermath.
Today our government continually proclaims its sincere
desire to end the threat of war. Ajt the same tirhe they mock oUr
intelligence by preparing us for a game which we are told will
never be played. We have been encouraged to think of war in
some mathematical abstract sense in which, if the impossible
were to happen, we W’ould be saved from reality by a cellar full
of crackers and water. We have been told that these fallout shel
ters are a necessary step towards peace and security.
I believe that it is up to us to discuss and protest this matter.
War today cannot be averted by preparing for it. “Positive ef
forts for world peace” are far less likely if the strategists feel
that we the people are ready to accept war and its consequences.
Positive efforts will only become possible if we, all of us, speak
out. If we do not, no one else will.

This is the time of mounting concern for human life in case
of a nuclear attack. With this concern comes government action
and expenditure of billions of dollars for civil defense, most of it
being used for both the construction of fallout shelters and for
storing survival crackers. Rather than diving head-first into a
civil defense program, we should stop and think about what we
need to survive a nuclear attack and how best to integrate this
with our present lives. It is not enough to realize that we need
protection and supplies and with this realization to go rushing
forward. We should not feel that anything even if wrong is bet
ter than nothing. A hole to cuddle in and crackers to eat is not
enough to sustain life for any period of time. We need a realistic
view of fallout shelters and of the materials needed for sur
vival. Having shelters alone is not sufficient, because most peo
ple, despite concerted efforts by civil defense, still do not know
where their nearest shelter is located. As a simple matter of
economics, it is not feasible to build shelters for several million
people, only tq stock with food and then close, maybe never to
be used.
As a realistic approach to the problem the following pro
posal is made. The great bulk of the food supply in the United
States is present in our neighborhood supermarkets. Why should
this food, most of it in cans, be wasted or not used during a
nuclear attack merely because we can’t reach it? Why should we
eat survival crackers when only two blocks down the street is
a market that contains all the food we need for survival and is
palatable as well? Why not make the market our fallout shelter?
Markets could even be easily constructed of brick or concrete so
that they would effectively serve this purpose. Everyone would
know where the neighborhood supermarket is and in case of
emergency he would merely head for the store. Food would not
have to be especially stored because it is present at all times.
The only extra item that would need to be stored is a can opener.
Thus, with this simple solution we W'ould have fallout shelters
that contain palatable food and water, everyone would know
where the fallout shelters are, no buildings would have to be
constructed never to be used, and we would not need to use valu
able space in our present buildings to store the CIVIL DEFENSE
SURVIVAL CRACKER—Stock no. 8920-823-7666.
