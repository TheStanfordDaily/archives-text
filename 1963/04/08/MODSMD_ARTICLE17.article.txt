# Harriers Win Triangular; Weill Sets Discus Mark
## 
### 
A new collegiate discus record
by Stanford’s 6-8 Dave Weill high
lighted the Stanford-UCLA-Occi
dental triangular meet Saturday
in Los Angeles hut the weekend
was generally disappointing for
the Indian (racksters.
Although they won the triangu
lar meet and both dual meets,
their margins of victory were
substantially below the edges
predicted for diem by the dope
sheets and those expected by
Coach Payton Jordan, who was
hoping for a show of Stanford
track strength. The triangular
meet ended: Stanford 67, Occi
dental 58, UCLA 56, while the
dual meets found Stanford beat

ing Oxy 72Va-71*4 and UCLA 80-
Go. These wins made Stanford’s
dual meet record 5-1.
WEILL’S THROW for the new
record went a distance of 191 feet,
6 inches; it came on his fourth at
tempt and followed a toss of 190-0
on the previous attempt, Weill
held the old record, lOl-T’i, which
he set last June.
Tlie greatest Individual per
formance, however, was achieved
by UCLA’s decathlon star C. K.
Yang. He made four first places;
high hurdles (11.3), javelin (217),
broad Jump (24-1%), and pole
vault (15-6), and ran a leg in the
winning mile relay. Thus he
scored or assisted in 25 points in
the triangular meet.
BESIDES WEILL'S first in the
discus, Stanford had only four
wins, and these were accounted
for by two men, Harry McCalla
and Steve Cortright. McCalla won
the mile and two-mile. He had a
surprisingly easy time of it in
the former race where he was
competing against two sub-4;06.0
men, LeRoy Neal and Tom Webb.
However, McCalla took com
mand of the race half-way
through and finished in 4:08.1,
seven-tenths of a second ahead
of Neal.
Cort right won the 330-yd. inter
mediate hurdles and the triple
jump and finished second in the
120-yd. high hurdles. His interme
diate hurdle time was 37.0, a new
Stanford record and the third
best time in the U.S. this year.
THE CLOSEST race in the
meet was the 100-yard dash.
Three men were timed in 9.7,
with UCLA’s Len Dobson edging
Oxy’s Steve Haas (second) and
Stanford’s Larry Questad. The
fourth runner, Stanford’s Eric
Frische, finished in 9.8.
Indian broad jumper Dan

Moore competed for the first time
in four weeks and made a credit-1
able performance. His 23-11'-:
was good for second place, only
2‘4 inches behind Yang.
The Indians’ mediocrity this |
weekend can be traced primarily
to three sources. In the pole
vault, where Phi) White should be
making 15 feet despite his trouble
adjusting to a fiber glass pole,
Stanford got no points; White
passed until 14 feet and then j
failed to clear that standard.
IN THE MILE relay. Stanford’s
Bob Mclntyre, Phil Lamoreaux,
Rich Chesarek, and Ken Emanu
els have been running around
3:12-3:13. Yet Oxy’s 3:14.4 was
good enough to win Saturday,
Finally, Stanford got no points
in the javelin, where fourth place 1
went to 183-11'-. Dan Prono, who
has thrown 202 but averages
around 180 had the best chance
to place for Stanford.

A new collegiate discus record
by Stanford’s 6-8 Dave Weill high
lighted the Stanford-UCLA-Occi
dental triangular meet Saturday
in Los Angeles hut the weekend
was generally disappointing for
the Indian (racksters.
Although they won the triangu
lar meet and both dual meets,
their margins of victory were
substantially below the edges
predicted for diem by the dope
sheets and those expected by
Coach Payton Jordan, who was
hoping for a show of Stanford
track strength. The triangular
meet ended: Stanford 67, Occi
dental 58, UCLA 56, while the
dual meets found Stanford beat

ing Oxy 72Va-71*4 and UCLA 80-
Go. These wins made Stanford’s
dual meet record 5-1.
WEILL’S THROW for the new
record went a distance of 191 feet,
6 inches; it came on his fourth at
tempt and followed a toss of 190-0
on the previous attempt, Weill
held the old record, lOl-T’i, which
he set last June.
Tlie greatest Individual per
formance, however, was achieved
by UCLA’s decathlon star C. K.
Yang. He made four first places;
high hurdles (11.3), javelin (217),
broad Jump (24-1%), and pole
vault (15-6), and ran a leg in the
winning mile relay. Thus he
scored or assisted in 25 points in
the triangular meet.
BESIDES WEILL'S first in the
discus, Stanford had only four
wins, and these were accounted
for by two men, Harry McCalla
and Steve Cortright. McCalla won
the mile and two-mile. He had a
surprisingly easy time of it in
the former race where he was
competing against two sub-4;06.0
men, LeRoy Neal and Tom Webb.
However, McCalla took com
mand of the race half-way
through and finished in 4:08.1,
seven-tenths of a second ahead
of Neal.
Cort right won the 330-yd. inter
mediate hurdles and the triple
jump and finished second in the
120-yd. high hurdles. His interme
diate hurdle time was 37.0, a new
Stanford record and the third
best time in the U.S. this year.
THE CLOSEST race in the
meet was the 100-yard dash.
Three men were timed in 9.7,
with UCLA’s Len Dobson edging
Oxy’s Steve Haas (second) and
Stanford’s Larry Questad. The
fourth runner, Stanford’s Eric
Frische, finished in 9.8.
Indian broad jumper Dan

Moore competed for the first time
in four weeks and made a credit-1
able performance. His 23-11'-:
was good for second place, only
2‘4 inches behind Yang.
The Indians’ mediocrity this |
weekend can be traced primarily
to three sources. In the pole
vault, where Phi) White should be
making 15 feet despite his trouble
adjusting to a fiber glass pole,
Stanford got no points; White
passed until 14 feet and then j
failed to clear that standard.
IN THE MILE relay. Stanford’s
Bob Mclntyre, Phil Lamoreaux,
Rich Chesarek, and Ken Emanu
els have been running around
3:12-3:13. Yet Oxy’s 3:14.4 was
good enough to win Saturday,
Finally, Stanford got no points
in the javelin, where fourth place 1
went to 183-11'-. Dan Prono, who
has thrown 202 but averages
around 180 had the best chance
to place for Stanford.

A new collegiate discus record
by Stanford’s 6-8 Dave Weill high
lighted the Stanford-UCLA-Occi
dental triangular meet Saturday
in Los Angeles hut the weekend
was generally disappointing for
the Indian (racksters.
Although they won the triangu
lar meet and both dual meets,
their margins of victory were
substantially below the edges
predicted for diem by the dope
sheets and those expected by
Coach Payton Jordan, who was
hoping for a show of Stanford
track strength. The triangular
meet ended: Stanford 67, Occi
dental 58, UCLA 56, while the
dual meets found Stanford beat

ing Oxy 72Va-71*4 and UCLA 80-
Go. These wins made Stanford’s
dual meet record 5-1.
WEILL’S THROW for the new
record went a distance of 191 feet,
6 inches; it came on his fourth at
tempt and followed a toss of 190-0
on the previous attempt, Weill
held the old record, lOl-T’i, which
he set last June.
Tlie greatest Individual per
formance, however, was achieved
by UCLA’s decathlon star C. K.
Yang. He made four first places;
high hurdles (11.3), javelin (217),
broad Jump (24-1%), and pole
vault (15-6), and ran a leg in the
winning mile relay. Thus he
scored or assisted in 25 points in
the triangular meet.
BESIDES WEILL'S first in the
discus, Stanford had only four
wins, and these were accounted
for by two men, Harry McCalla
and Steve Cortright. McCalla won
the mile and two-mile. He had a
surprisingly easy time of it in
the former race where he was
competing against two sub-4;06.0
men, LeRoy Neal and Tom Webb.
However, McCalla took com
mand of the race half-way
through and finished in 4:08.1,
seven-tenths of a second ahead
of Neal.
Cort right won the 330-yd. inter
mediate hurdles and the triple
jump and finished second in the
120-yd. high hurdles. His interme
diate hurdle time was 37.0, a new
Stanford record and the third
best time in the U.S. this year.
THE CLOSEST race in the
meet was the 100-yard dash.
Three men were timed in 9.7,
with UCLA’s Len Dobson edging
Oxy’s Steve Haas (second) and
Stanford’s Larry Questad. The
fourth runner, Stanford’s Eric
Frische, finished in 9.8.
Indian broad jumper Dan

Moore competed for the first time
in four weeks and made a credit-1
able performance. His 23-11'-:
was good for second place, only
2‘4 inches behind Yang.
The Indians’ mediocrity this |
weekend can be traced primarily
to three sources. In the pole
vault, where Phi) White should be
making 15 feet despite his trouble
adjusting to a fiber glass pole,
Stanford got no points; White
passed until 14 feet and then j
failed to clear that standard.
IN THE MILE relay. Stanford’s
Bob Mclntyre, Phil Lamoreaux,
Rich Chesarek, and Ken Emanu
els have been running around
3:12-3:13. Yet Oxy’s 3:14.4 was
good enough to win Saturday,
Finally, Stanford got no points
in the javelin, where fourth place 1
went to 183-11'-. Dan Prono, who
has thrown 202 but averages
around 180 had the best chance
to place for Stanford.

A new collegiate discus record
by Stanford’s 6-8 Dave Weill high
lighted the Stanford-UCLA-Occi
dental triangular meet Saturday
in Los Angeles hut the weekend
was generally disappointing for
the Indian (racksters.
Although they won the triangu
lar meet and both dual meets,
their margins of victory were
substantially below the edges
predicted for diem by the dope
sheets and those expected by
Coach Payton Jordan, who was
hoping for a show of Stanford
track strength. The triangular
meet ended: Stanford 67, Occi
dental 58, UCLA 56, while the
dual meets found Stanford beat

ing Oxy 72Va-71*4 and UCLA 80-
Go. These wins made Stanford’s
dual meet record 5-1.
WEILL’S THROW for the new
record went a distance of 191 feet,
6 inches; it came on his fourth at
tempt and followed a toss of 190-0
on the previous attempt, Weill
held the old record, lOl-T’i, which
he set last June.
Tlie greatest Individual per
formance, however, was achieved
by UCLA’s decathlon star C. K.
Yang. He made four first places;
high hurdles (11.3), javelin (217),
broad Jump (24-1%), and pole
vault (15-6), and ran a leg in the
winning mile relay. Thus he
scored or assisted in 25 points in
the triangular meet.
BESIDES WEILL'S first in the
discus, Stanford had only four
wins, and these were accounted
for by two men, Harry McCalla
and Steve Cortright. McCalla won
the mile and two-mile. He had a
surprisingly easy time of it in
the former race where he was
competing against two sub-4;06.0
men, LeRoy Neal and Tom Webb.
However, McCalla took com
mand of the race half-way
through and finished in 4:08.1,
seven-tenths of a second ahead
of Neal.
Cort right won the 330-yd. inter
mediate hurdles and the triple
jump and finished second in the
120-yd. high hurdles. His interme
diate hurdle time was 37.0, a new
Stanford record and the third
best time in the U.S. this year.
THE CLOSEST race in the
meet was the 100-yard dash.
Three men were timed in 9.7,
with UCLA’s Len Dobson edging
Oxy’s Steve Haas (second) and
Stanford’s Larry Questad. The
fourth runner, Stanford’s Eric
Frische, finished in 9.8.
Indian broad jumper Dan

Moore competed for the first time
in four weeks and made a credit-1
able performance. His 23-11'-:
was good for second place, only
2‘4 inches behind Yang.
The Indians’ mediocrity this |
weekend can be traced primarily
to three sources. In the pole
vault, where Phi) White should be
making 15 feet despite his trouble
adjusting to a fiber glass pole,
Stanford got no points; White
passed until 14 feet and then j
failed to clear that standard.
IN THE MILE relay. Stanford’s
Bob Mclntyre, Phil Lamoreaux,
Rich Chesarek, and Ken Emanu
els have been running around
3:12-3:13. Yet Oxy’s 3:14.4 was
good enough to win Saturday,
Finally, Stanford got no points
in the javelin, where fourth place 1
went to 183-11'-. Dan Prono, who
has thrown 202 but averages
around 180 had the best chance
to place for Stanford.

A new collegiate discus record
by Stanford’s 6-8 Dave Weill high
lighted the Stanford-UCLA-Occi
dental triangular meet Saturday
in Los Angeles hut the weekend
was generally disappointing for
the Indian (racksters.
Although they won the triangu
lar meet and both dual meets,
their margins of victory were
substantially below the edges
predicted for diem by the dope
sheets and those expected by
Coach Payton Jordan, who was
hoping for a show of Stanford
track strength. The triangular
meet ended: Stanford 67, Occi
dental 58, UCLA 56, while the
dual meets found Stanford beat

ing Oxy 72Va-71*4 and UCLA 80-
Go. These wins made Stanford’s
dual meet record 5-1.
WEILL’S THROW for the new
record went a distance of 191 feet,
6 inches; it came on his fourth at
tempt and followed a toss of 190-0
on the previous attempt, Weill
held the old record, lOl-T’i, which
he set last June.
Tlie greatest Individual per
formance, however, was achieved
by UCLA’s decathlon star C. K.
Yang. He made four first places;
high hurdles (11.3), javelin (217),
broad Jump (24-1%), and pole
vault (15-6), and ran a leg in the
winning mile relay. Thus he
scored or assisted in 25 points in
the triangular meet.
BESIDES WEILL'S first in the
discus, Stanford had only four
wins, and these were accounted
for by two men, Harry McCalla
and Steve Cortright. McCalla won
the mile and two-mile. He had a
surprisingly easy time of it in
the former race where he was
competing against two sub-4;06.0
men, LeRoy Neal and Tom Webb.
However, McCalla took com
mand of the race half-way
through and finished in 4:08.1,
seven-tenths of a second ahead
of Neal.
Cort right won the 330-yd. inter
mediate hurdles and the triple
jump and finished second in the
120-yd. high hurdles. His interme
diate hurdle time was 37.0, a new
Stanford record and the third
best time in the U.S. this year.
THE CLOSEST race in the
meet was the 100-yard dash.
Three men were timed in 9.7,
with UCLA’s Len Dobson edging
Oxy’s Steve Haas (second) and
Stanford’s Larry Questad. The
fourth runner, Stanford’s Eric
Frische, finished in 9.8.
Indian broad jumper Dan

Moore competed for the first time
in four weeks and made a credit-1
able performance. His 23-11'-:
was good for second place, only
2‘4 inches behind Yang.
The Indians’ mediocrity this |
weekend can be traced primarily
to three sources. In the pole
vault, where Phi) White should be
making 15 feet despite his trouble
adjusting to a fiber glass pole,
Stanford got no points; White
passed until 14 feet and then j
failed to clear that standard.
IN THE MILE relay. Stanford’s
Bob Mclntyre, Phil Lamoreaux,
Rich Chesarek, and Ken Emanu
els have been running around
3:12-3:13. Yet Oxy’s 3:14.4 was
good enough to win Saturday,
Finally, Stanford got no points
in the javelin, where fourth place 1
went to 183-11'-. Dan Prono, who
has thrown 202 but averages
around 180 had the best chance
to place for Stanford.
