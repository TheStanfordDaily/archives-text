Saturday.
The wind and rain churned up
the course so much that the frag
ile racing shells were in danger
of being swamped, so the course
was shortened from 2000 meters
to 1650 meters.
USC took a slight early lead,
but the Indians caught up short
ly thereafter, and the two boats
were never more than a length
apart. Coxswain Mike Hanley
started the Indians rowing at a
37 strokes per minute rate, while
USC had a slightly faster rate.
The Tribe’s closing sprint edged
the Trojans by a second in 5:16.
Oregon State, which was ex
pected to provide a threat, didn’t
do so until the very end, when

they closed to within two seconds
(nearly a boat length) o£ Stan
ford.
The Indian freshmen showed
impressive strength in complete
ly outclassing the USC and OSU
frosh. Their 5:17 time was only
one second off the varsity’s.
The junior varsity boat led
most of the way, but the Oregon
Stale shell caught them at the
finish, and they lost by a mere
half a second.
It was the first race for all
Stanford boats; they meet Cal
next Saturday.
