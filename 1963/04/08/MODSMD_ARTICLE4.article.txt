# The
						Hostage' Begins Open Tryouts Today; Needs Singers, Dancers
## 
### 
Open tryouts for “The Hos
tage” will ho held at 4:30 p.m. to
day, 7:30 p.m. tomorrow and 4:30
and 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday the
10th in the Little Theater. Sched
uled for a late May production,
‘‘The Hostage” will be directed
by Victor Mitchell, a Canadian
graduate student in (lie Depart
ment of Speech and Drama.
“The Hostage” tells the story
of a young Cockney soldier who
is held by the Irish Republican
Army during the “trouble” in re
taliation for an IRA man who is
to be hanged by the British. But
Behan’s drama, like his public
behavior, does not fit into the
conventional mold. Thus “The
Hostage.” .as well as being a witty
and sometimes profound com
ment upon Anglo-Irish relations
and the Irish themselves, is also
a bawdy entertainment, rollicking
with ballads, satirical songs,
dances, and impromptu skits.
The cast to bo filled at the
open tryouts for “The Hostage”
numbers about 15, and is mainly
composed of the “lodgers” in the
“house” owned by the bagpipe
tooting Monsewer and operated
by the firey-tempered Pat and
Meg. Representative members of
this mixed bag of Dublinitcs are
Miss Gillchrist and Mr. Mulleady,
two fervently pious social work
ers, Bobo and Colette, ladies of
the streets, and Teresa, a naive
country girl who falls in love
with the Cockney hostage of the
IRA.
As with all Stanford Players
auditions, those for “The Hos
tage” are open to anyone who
might be interested in working
in this production.
