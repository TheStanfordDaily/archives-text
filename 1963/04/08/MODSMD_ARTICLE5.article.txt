# Cal Davis Challenges SU Student Firemen

### PATRICIA LONG 
The Stanford Student FitV
men's Association has been chal
lenged to a ‘‘Make and Break”
race by the Student Firemen of
the University of California at
Davis, it was announced recently.
The contest is to take place at
the Rural Fire Chief’s Conven
tion at Santa Rosa, California on
April 27.
The challenge came about as
the result of an article on the
Stanford student firemen in the
Pacific Coast Fire Journal. The
Davis firemen, not to be outdone,
issued the challenge, which Stan
ford answered in a letter saying
that ‘‘Make and Break” races
were “trivial pastimes indulged in
only by rural departments which
have nothing more productive to
do.” The letter said that the Stan
ford group felt “a more convinc
ing display of superiority would
be to set fire to a structure and
then to see who attacked the con
flagration most efficiently,” and
suggested the Davis campus.
They concluded, however, that
“through your obvious inepti
tude” the campus would be total

ly razed, with the result that it
would have to he replaced by tax
money, and that on the whole it
was “a rather impractical choice.”
Consequently Stanford accept
ed the challenge, suggesting that
a set of rules be drawn up in ad
vance “just to be sure we are
both training under the same
rules.”
To compensate the Davis fire
men for this parliamentary nui
sance, Stanford offered “to recip
rocate by sending a book of
matches with complete instruc
tions for their ignition and ex
tinction.”
Inside sources report that the
Stanford team is now “practicing
madly” for the “Make and Break”
contest, a type of relay race that
involves the successive coupling
of 50-foot lengths of hose to the
engine, each other, and the nozzle
by each member of a four-man
team.
Stanford concurred that a tro
phy should be awarded the victor
i“even though our trophy case
is already overflowing”), and to
make the teams more even- of
fered to select its team by lot in
stead of arbitrary choice. They
qualified their offer slightly,
however, since “at Stanford, stu
dents are expected to study, and
some of us must engage in that
endeavor on the day of the tour
nament.” Also, they added, some
firemen have to be on duty that
day.
Stanford's Four (firemen) will
meet Davis’s “on the field of
glory” on Saturday, April 27,
1963,” and, as Stanford tactfully
told the opponent: “the good
guys always win.”
