### CARRIE BRAND 
The paintings hanging along
the stairway of the Main Library,
and adorning the walls of Tresid
der Union, are the work of 70-
year-old Sausalito artist, Jean
Varda, and are presented by the
Tresidder Cultural Arts Division.
Lately. Varda’s artistic efforts
seem to have become the subject
of a controversy raging between
a group of Sausalito intellectuals,
ardent devotees of Varda, and
I George Culler, Director of the
I San Francisco Museum of Art.
i According to ttie San Francis
! co Chronicle, the controversy was
j sparked when Varda’s request for
j a one-man retrospective exhibi
| tion at the Museum was denied
by Culler. Varda’s supporters de
| cried this alleged refusal, the
most outspoken of the group be
! ing the novelist, Henry Miller.
Miller launched a tirade against
j the Museum, accusing the Direc
tors of ignoring Varda.
Culler explained that ire and
his panel review all work which
| may be exhibited, and try to se
j lect those which represent the
I most significant contributions of
I contemporary Bay Area artists.
Considering the tremendous com
| petition and the needs of the Mu
j seum at the time, Culler felt that
j Carda’s work simply did not
qualify. His conclusion was heat
j cdly contested by Varda and his
| Sausalito advocates who felt that
j an adverse judgment as to the
| aesthetic quality of Varda’s art
! was implied.
Culler denied this, saying that
j he personally feels that Varda is
I “very capable, extremely popu
j far, and quite a respected figure.”
1 Countering the attack, he at

tested that the whole issue was
“cooked up by Miller and Varda’s
other literary friends, and fur
thered by the Chronicle's misrep
resentation of the entire matter
of the exhibition.’’ Actually, said
Culler, an artist does not request
an exhibition; rather, he is in
vited by the museum to display
his work.
“Thus, no request of Varda’s
has actually been rejected; it is
merely that no museum has ask
ed for him, and, as senior artist
of the area, he feels that he is
entitled to a major retrospective
exhibition.” Nevertheless, a mu
seum can show only about a doz
en artists a year, Culler contin
ued and considering the overall
quality of Varda’s work, and the
important contributions being
made by hundreds of other Bay
Area artists, the chances that any
of San Francisco’s museums will
soon request a one-man Varda
exhibition are negligible.
Culler refuted Miller’s claim
that Varda has been ignored by
citing the occasion of a major
display several years ago of Var
da’s work at the DeYoung Mu
seum in Golden Gate Park, the
largest of San Francisco’s three
museums.
Varda’s work has been highly
praised by many art critics, and
he has been especially commend
ed for his facility to work in a
variety of mediums, among them
the college and the mosaic.
Strongly inclined toward the ro
mantic and the decorative, Var
da utilizes cloth of every conceiv
able texture, bits of metal, wood
shavings, and numerous other
imaginative Items, all combined
in a vivid color scheme to create
his highly stylized works.
