insights into the culture and spir
it of contemporary Poland and
the Eastern European nations.
On Tuesday, April 9, one fea
ture length and two shorter films
will be shown at 4:15 in Memori
al Auditorium. “Don’t Tease the
Lion,” a satire, tolls the story of
a lion who, through a fantastic
chain of events, becomes the ruler
of a town. It is a commentary on
the fine line between civilization
and the animal kingdom in to
day’s mechanistic world. “When
Angels Fall” is a film by Roman
Polansky, the famous director of
“Two Men in a Wardrobe.” It is
an exercise in the cinema of
memory as well as a sociological
commentary on human short

cated love story underlining the
theme of emotional incommunica
bility. The film stars two of Po
land’s most popular young play
ers, Zgniehw Cybulski and Te
resa Tuczyinska, and includes a
brief comic performance by Ro
man Polansky.
On Wednesday another series
of films will be shown at 4:15 in
Mem Aud. The first, “Life Is
Beautiful,” is an indictment of
war and mankind's indifference
to its consequences. The second,
“Or a Fish,” is an eccentric inter
pretation of the indecisiveness of
love.
The full length film, “Panic on
a Train,” by Kazinier Kutz is a
suspenseful glimpse of wartime
Poland. It tells of the struggles
of a station master in a small
town as he tries to save a group
of stranded passengers before the
Gestapo can reach them. The film
is a detailed study of characters
in the Hitchcock tradition.

series is 50 cents. In addition,
more films will be shown from

Mem Aud, among them “The

Angels Fall” is a film by Roman
Polansky, the famous director of
“Two Men in a Wardrobe.” It is
an exercise in the cinema of
memory as well as a sociological
commentary on human short
comings.
The full length feature will be
“See You Tomorrow,” a sophisti
cated love story underlining the
theme of emotional incommunica
bility. The film stars two of Po
land’s most popular young play
ers, Zgniehw Cybulski and Te
resa Tuczyinska, and includes a
brief comic performance by Ro
man Polansky.
On Wednesday another series
of films will be shown at 4:15 in
Mem Aud. The first, “Life Is
Beautiful,” is an indictment of
war and mankind's indifference
to its consequences. The second,
“Or a Fish,” is an eccentric inter
pretation of the indecisiveness of
love.
The full length film, “Panic on
a Train,” by Kazinier Kutz is a
suspenseful glimpse of wartime
Poland. It tells of the struggles
of a station master in a small
town as he tries to save a group
of stranded passengers before the
Gestapo can reach them. The film
is a detailed study of characters
in the Hitchcock tradition.
The admission fee for both
series is 50 cents. In addition,
more films will be shown from
1-5 p.m. Saturday the 13th in
Mem Aud, among them “The
Pest,” an entry in the 1962 San
Francisco Film Festival.
