INDIANS,
Campus locomotion
puts a premium on
footwork, motoring
restrictions being
what they are. And, if
your kicks are looking
a bit tired, maybe
now’s the time to
slide into R A and a
new pair of Walkover
slipons, hand-sewn
for easy-fitting com
fort, in the Indian moc
casin tradition. Very
suitable for campus
and for informal out
side wear. In black or
brown, a mere
19.00 the pair.
