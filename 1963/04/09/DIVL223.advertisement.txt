AMONG MY KINFOLK
My favorite cousin, Mandolin Glebe, a sweet, unspoiled country
boy, has just started college. Today I got a letter from him
which I will reprint here because I know Mandolin’s problems
are so much like your own. Mandolin writes:
Dear Mandolin (he thinks my name is Mandolin too),
I see by the college paper that you are writing a column for
Marlboro Cigarettes. 1 think Marlboros are jim-dandy cig
arettes with real nice tobacco and a ginger-peachy filter, and
I want to tell you why I don’t smoke them.
It all started the very first day I arrived at college. I was
walking across the campus, swinging rny paper valise and sing
ing traditional airs like Blue Tail Fly and Death ami Trans
figuration, when all of a sudden 1 ran into this here collegiate
looking fellow with a monogram on his breast pocket. Ile asked
me was I a freshman. I said yes. He asked me did 1 want to
be a HMOC and the envy of all the in crowd. I said yes. lie
-aid the only way to make* these keen things happen was to join
a fraternity. Fortunately he happened to have a pledge card
with him, so he pricked my thumb and I signed, lie didn’t tell
me the name of the fraternity or where it is located, but I sup
pose 1 11 find out when I go active.
Meanwhile this fellow comes around every week to collect
the dues, which are $lOO, plus a $lO fine for missing the weekly
meeting, phis a $5 assessment to buy a headstone for Spot, the
late, beloved beagle who was the fraternity mascot.
1 have never regretted joining the fraternity, because it is
my dearest wish to be a HMOC and the envy of all the in
crowd, but you can see that it is not cheap. It wouldn’t be so
bad if I slept at the frat house, but you must agree that I can’t
sleep at the house if I don’t know where the house is.
1 have rented a room which is not only grotesquely expen
sive, but it is not at all the kind of room 1 was looking for. I
wa.nted someplace reasonably priced, clean, comfortable, and
within easy walking distance of classes, the shopping district,
and San Francisco and Xew York. What I found was a bedroom
in the home of a local costermonger which is dingy, expensive,
and uncomfortable—and I don’t even get to use the bed till
7 a.m, when my landlord goes out to mong his costers.
Well anyhow, I got settled and the next thing 1 did, naturally,
was In look for a girl. And f found her. Harriet, her name is, a
beautiful creature standing just under seven feet high and weigh
ing ;iS7) pounds. I first spied her leaning against the statue of
the Founder, dozing lightly. I talked to her for several hours
without effect. Only when I mentioned dinner did she stir. I lor
milky little eyes opened, she raised a brawny arm, seized viy
nape, and carried me to a chic French restaurant called Lc
< lipjoint where she consumed, according to rny calculations,
her own weight in Chateaubriand.
After dinner she lapsed into a torpor from which I could not
rouse her, no matter how I tried. I banged my glass with a
fork, 1 pinched her great pendulous jowls, I rubbed the legs of
my corduroy pants together. But nothing worked, and finally
1 slang her over my shoulder and carried her to the girls dorm,
slipping several discs in the process.
Fortunately, medical eare for students is provided free at the
college infirmary. All I had to pay for were a few extras, like
X-rays, anaesthesia, forceps, hernostats, scalpels, catgut, linen,
towels, amortization, and nurses. They would not, however,
let me keep the nurses.
So, dear cousin, it is lack of funds, not lack of enthusiasm,
that is keeping me from Marlboro Cigarettes—dear, good
Marlboros with their fine blend of choice tobaccos and their
pure white Selcctrate filter and their soft pack and their flip
top box.
Well, I must close now. My pencil is wore out and 1 can’t
afford another. Keep ’em flying.

The hearts of the makers of Marlboro go out to poor Man
dolin —and to poor anyone else who is missing out on our
line cigarettes—available in all 50 of these United Slates.
