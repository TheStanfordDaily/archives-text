## 'Mockingbird:' An Anti-Review 
### VEKNE HEAVES 
The question of the quality of a given motion-picture may
appear to many people as trivial. Surely, most would argue, it is
but a matter of taste. But those of us who are in the Humanities
or Fine Arts spend a great deal of time trying to discover and
defend “objective” standards for “this sixth sense called taste.”
My own standards of taste and artistic excellence are apparently
quite contrary to those of Mr. Jacobs as evidenced in his review
of “To Kill A Mockingbird.” for I found the film a total failure.
Since, as many students of the arts must by now realize, the
motion-picture is currently in strong competition with the novel
as a mimetic form and as a mode of presenting and exploring
moral truths, it is perhaps worthwhile to spend a few moments
over such radical differences of opinion.
Mr. Jacobs says that “Mockingbird” is “a beautiful and
touching film.” He says that the photography is “stunningly
effective,” that a particular scene is "especially effective,” the
entire cast “excellent,” and the two children “just perfect.”
But upon what criteria does Jacobs base these epithets? We are
not told. And are not such words as “delightful” and “excellent”
quite meaningless, at best merely ejaculatory statements of
approval, if divorced from their criteria?
But we are given two hints about why Jacobs considers this
“a film to see.” He lauds the film’s "tender and nostalgic mood,”
and he praises the screenplay for being “basically faithful to
the book.” Now tho fallacy underlying the latter criterion is the
easiest to point out: it does not follow at all that because a film
is based on a “good” book that the film too is “good.” Indeed,
having read and enjoyed a book upon which a film is based is
very often a detriment to an appreciation of the film in itself;
we are then too apt, as I suspect Jacobs has been, to excuse the
failings of the film, or even fail to notice them at all, because,
while we are viewing it, our memory and sub conscious arc fill
ing-in the film’s gaps and shallownesses with material we have
read.
My taking offense at Jacob’s appreciation of the film’s
“tender and nostalgic mood” is more controversial. As far as I
can tell, this "mood” derives from the use of the children’s
“point-of-view” throughout. Now, when I saw the film I thought:
there isn’t a character here who isn’t a “type”; how utterly
simple and lacking in depth are the plot and the dialogue; why,
the main point the film is trying to make is that the highest
kind of human love is that felt by 800 for a small child. In other
words, the use of the children’s “point-of-view” seems to have
necessitated that reality be viewed as shifting, shallow, “black
and-white,” and sentimental. In speaking later with some twenty
other students who also liked the film, I heard again and again
this kind of statement: “How nice it was to be young and inno
cent like those little kids!” Now I hope, for the sake of Higher
Education, that the reason Jacobs and many others enjoyed
"Mockingbird” was not simply that it provided temporary re
gress to infantile delusions of “the best of all possible worlds,”
but I strongly suspect that this was so.
What we really want from our films, and are fortunately
beginning to get, is an artistic experience which is complete in
itself, which affects us intellectually as well as emotionally.
We ought, I believe, to want films which, as Dorothy Van Ghent
has said of Shakespeare’s plays, “stretch our own moral imagi
nation, exercise and toughen it, vitalize it to a greater aware
ness of the complexity of the moral life.” We get nothing of
this sort in “To Kill A Mockingbird.”

gress to infantile delusions of “the best of all possible worlds,”
but I strongly suspect that this was so.
What we really want from our films, and are fortunately
beginning to get, is an artistic experience which is complete in
itself, which affects us intellectually as well as emotionally.
We ought, I believe, to want films which, as Dorothy Van Ghent
has said of Shakespeare’s plays, “stretch our own moral imagi
nation, exercise and toughen it, vitalize it to a greater aware
ness of the complexity of the moral life.” We get nothing of
this sort in “To Kill A Mockingbird.”
The question of the quality of a given motion-picture may
appear to many people as trivial. Surely, most would argue, it is
but a matter of taste. But those of us who are in the Humanities
or Fine Arts spend a great deal of time trying to discover and
defend “objective” standards for “this sixth sense called taste.”
My own standards of taste and artistic excellence are apparently
quite contrary to those of Mr. Jacobs as evidenced in his review
of “To Kill A Mockingbird.” for I found the film a total failure.
Since, as many students of the arts must by now realize, the
motion-picture is currently in strong competition with the novel
as a mimetic form and as a mode of presenting and exploring
moral truths, it is perhaps worthwhile to spend a few moments
over such radical differences of opinion.
Mr. Jacobs says that “Mockingbird” is “a beautiful and
touching film.” He says that the photography is “stunningly
effective,” that a particular scene is "especially effective,” the
entire cast “excellent,” and the two children “just perfect.”
But upon what criteria does Jacobs base these epithets? We are
not told. And are not such words as “delightful” and “excellent”
quite meaningless, at best merely ejaculatory statements of
approval, if divorced from their criteria?
But we are given two hints about why Jacobs considers this
“a film to see.” He lauds the film’s "tender and nostalgic mood,”
and he praises the screenplay for being “basically faithful to
the book.” Now tho fallacy underlying the latter criterion is the
easiest to point out: it does not follow at all that because a film
is based on a “good” book that the film too is “good.” Indeed,
having read and enjoyed a book upon which a film is based is
very often a detriment to an appreciation of the film in itself;
we are then too apt, as I suspect Jacobs has been, to excuse the
failings of the film, or even fail to notice them at all, because,
while we are viewing it, our memory and sub conscious arc fill
ing-in the film’s gaps and shallownesses with material we have
read.
My taking offense at Jacob’s appreciation of the film’s
“tender and nostalgic mood” is more controversial. As far as I
can tell, this "mood” derives from the use of the children’s
“point-of-view” throughout. Now, when I saw the film I thought:
there isn’t a character here who isn’t a “type”; how utterly
simple and lacking in depth are the plot and the dialogue; why,
the main point the film is trying to make is that the highest
kind of human love is that felt by 800 for a small child. In other
words, the use of the children’s “point-of-view” seems to have
necessitated that reality be viewed as shifting, shallow, “black
and-white,” and sentimental. In speaking later with some twenty
other students who also liked the film, I heard again and again
this kind of statement: “How nice it was to be young and inno
cent like those little kids!” Now I hope, for the sake of Higher
Education, that the reason Jacobs and many others enjoyed
"Mockingbird” was not simply that it provided temporary re
gress to infantile delusions of “the best of all possible worlds,”
but I strongly suspect that this was so.
