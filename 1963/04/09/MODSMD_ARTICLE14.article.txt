## 'McNamara and the TFX' 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
After swimming around for a while in the sea of technical
detail of the TFX argument, I emerged dripping with facts and
wondering, since there is so much that I do not understand,
whether there is anything which I am entitled to write about.
However, while I have nothing to say about the use of titanium,
of thrust reversers in supersonic flight, or even about high inlet
ducts in the propulsion system, there is, I think, a simple and
important question at the heart of the argument between Secre
tary McNamara and his critics.
There are, as I see it, no villains involved, and there is not
a shred of evidence to show that the contract went to the Gen
eral Dynamics Corporation because the Vice President is from
Texas, or that Senator Jackson has been doing anything im
proper because the Boeing Company is from the state of Wash
ington. The crux of the argument is not technical, military or
political, but economic. From the beginning, Secretary McNa
mara’s conception has been governed by his intention to keep
the defense budget, which is already enormous, from becoming
uncontrollably larger.
In order to keep military spending within some limit, it is
necessary to sacrifice perfectionism in the choice of weapons.
If money did not matter, each of the three military services
could be allowed to build for itself the most perfect specialized
tactical fighter. But since money does matter, the Defense De
partment has to forego demanding the best weapons that un
limited money could buy and to content itself with the loss per
fect weapons that will do the military job. Secretary McNa
mara’s friction with the uniformed hierarchy tstertist frpjn' his
commitment to the basic proposition that if military spending
is not to run wild, the weapons chosen have to be fully adequate,
but less than perfect.
Thus, Secretary McNamara has canceled the nuclear power
ed airplane and the Skybolt missile, he has opposed the all-out
development of the RS-70 and has given up two or throe other
very expensive projects which, in his judgment, are not neces
sary military weapons, but military luxuries. In the same way
of thinking, ho has been insisting that for the new supersonic
tactical planes, which both the Navy and the Air Force need,
every effort should be made to develop one tactical fighter plane
that can be adapted to the needs of each service.
The whole controversy turns on this. The General Dynamics
proposal is very much nearer to being one plane for both Navy
and Air Force than is the Boeing proposal. According to Secre
tary McNamara, the Boeing proposal is in fact for two much
more specialized fighter planes. The General Dynamics pro
posal is for “an airframe design that has a very high degree of
identical structure for the Navy and the Air Force versions,”
whereas in the two Boeing versions, “less than half of the struc
tural components of the wing, fuselage and tail were the same.”
To illustrate how wasteful is overspecialization, Secretary
McNamara tells us that the Navy now has a large number of
aircraft out of operation for lack of spare parts, while the Air
Force has a $2.2-billion inventory of spare parts that are “already
obsolete and practically worthless.”
The judgments which Secretary McNamara is making in the
choice of these very expensive weapons are judgments which
somebody has to make. Congress has the right and the power to
hold him accountable for them. Congress is not qualified, and it
hasn’t the time to make those judgments itself. Congress, also,
has the opportunity to review the secretary’s decisions. For
these new complicated weapons systems take years to develop.
But the kind of judgment which Mr. McNamara is making
is the kind of judgment the Secretary of Defense is meant to
make. That is one of the main reasons why his office was cre
ated. We know from experience that it has not always been easy
to find a Secretary of Defense who was competent to do that.
In Secretary McNamara, the country has a Secretary of Defense
who, in his training, in his practical experience and in his techni
cal knowledge of production, is remarkably, perhaps uniquely,
qualified to pass judgment on a problem like that of the TFX.
