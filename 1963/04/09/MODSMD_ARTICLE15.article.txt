# Tribe Faces Humboldt After Loss
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford’s young baseball team
learned a little humility from Cal
Poly (Pomona) Friday, bowing
5-3 as a late rally fell short. A
Saturday double-header was
rained out.
The Indians weren’t disgraced
by the loss, since the Pomonans j
are a very good college baseball
team. They ran their record to
10-4 with the win over the Cards. [

Stanford is now 11-5 on the sea
son.
Stanford was lackadaisical in
the early innings and quickly fell
behind 5-0 after Poly scored five
runs in a wild third inning. Poly
right fielder Norm Richins open
ed the inning with a triple. With
one out. shortstop Mike Buckoff
I singled him in. Two double steals,
I two throwing errors, a dropped
[ ball, a single, a walk, another
triple and several mental errors
I combined to send pitcher Jim
] Lonborg to his fourth defeat as
against three wins.
Meanwhile, Poly pitcher Lee
Losee was in the process of no
hitting Stanford for 6 1 s innings.
Bob Hollmann broke the jinx with
a solid single to right and with
two out Warren Newell also sin
gled. putting two Indians on base.
George Thacher sent them both
across the plate with a long dou
ble down the left field line.
Pinch hitter George Ashmore
walked and the potential tying
run was at the plate in the form
| of pinch hitter Dick Kovacevich,
a .467 batter. He hit a twisting
fly to right field that Richins al
j most misjudged, but he caught
| on the run to end the threat.
I Stanford got another tally in
| the eighth. Bobby Cox singled
(with one out, Greg Post lined
I viciously to the left side but right
to third baseman Louis Smith for

a perfect double play opportunity,
but Smith overthrew first base
man and Cox went to second.
Hollmann got his second hit to
drive in Cox and the tying run
was again at the plate in Gary
Smith. But he flied out to retire
the side.
Stanford appeared to have
pitcher Losee on the run, but he
improved remarkably in the ninth
inning, striking out the side. All
in all, Losee struck out 12 Stan
ford batsmen.
Lonborg has had better days
pitching for Stanford, though
only two runs in that wild five-
I run frame were earned. Both
triples were really bombed and
most of Poly’s 11 hits were well
stroked. But in the end it was the
Indians’ old bugaboo that beat
them; one bad inning defensively
coupled with light hitting.
Stanford’s next baseball activi
ty is today, against Humboldt
State on the Sunken Diamond,
starting at 3 p.m.
Darrell Sutherland (0-1) will
probably start for the Indians, al
though Dick Kovacevich (4-0)
may se some action in the latter
innings.

Lonborg has had better days
pitching for Stanford, though
only two runs in that wild five-
I run frame were earned. Both
triples were really bombed and
most of Poly’s 11 hits were well
stroked. But in the end it was the
Indians’ old bugaboo that beat
them; one bad inning defensively
coupled with light hitting.
Stanford’s next baseball activi
ty is today, against Humboldt

learned a little humility from Cal
Poly (Pomona) Friday, bowing
5-3 as a late rally fell short. A

10-4 with the win over the Cards. [

son.
Stanford was lackadaisical in
the early innings and quickly fell
behind 5-0 after Poly scored five
runs in a wild third inning. Poly
right fielder Norm Richins open
ed the inning with a triple. With

I singled him in. Two double steals,

Losee was in the process of no
hitting Stanford for 6 1 s innings.

George Thacher sent them both
across the plate with a long dou
ble down the left field line.
Pinch hitter George Ashmore
walked and the potential tying
run was at the plate in the form

a .467 batter. He hit a twisting
fly to right field that Richins al
j most misjudged, but he caught

I Stanford got another tally in

(with one out, Greg Post lined
I viciously to the left side but right
to third baseman Louis Smith for

a perfect double play opportunity,
but Smith overthrew first base
man and Cox went to second.
Hollmann got his second hit to
drive in Cox and the tying run
was again at the plate in Gary
