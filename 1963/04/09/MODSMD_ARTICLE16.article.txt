# WIN ONE MATCH
## Stanford Netmen Routed By Powerful USC, UCLA 
### JUSTIN BUCK 
Any aspirations the tennis
squad may have had about beat
ing USC and UCLA this year
were dimmed last weekend as the
Indians taced the two Southern
Californian powerhouses for the
first time this season.
The Tribe was humbled by both
schools, managing to win only
a single match out of 18 played.
USC, probably the top college
team in the country, won 8-1 on
Friday, and UCLA, ranked right
behind the Trojans, completed the
rout with a 9-0 shutout on Satur
day.
Coach Boh Ranker felt the
squad played well but that the
opposition was simply too strong
this time, calling USC, “the
strongest college tennis team I've
ever seen assembled.”
HOWKVKR there were some
bright spots in the generally dis
mal picture. Dick Wilson and
John Burt combined in the third
doubles to hand USC one loss, al
though by that time the only
question was whether Stanford
would be shutout or not.
Also against USC Ron Preiss
man surprised the Trojan’s Den
nis Ralston by winning the first
set of their match, 6-2. Ralston,
a Davis Cupper and National In
j door singles champion, came
j back, however, winning the next
liwo sets, 6-2, 6-2.
Finally the Indians have a sec
| ond chance later in the season,
j meeting both schools on (he Stan
ford Courts April 19-20. Renker

is hopeful that with some im
! provement and more experience,
the Indians might be able to even
I the score against the two schools.
TODAY THE Indians face Pep
i perdine in an attempt to rebuild
I their winning streak. The meet
starts at 2:30 p.m. on the Stan
! ford Courts. Tomorrow they play
Claremont.
Coach Renker expects to use
the same six who saw action
against USC and UCLA, although
he may switch the lineup around.
Yoshi Minegishi will probably
play first singles, with Preiss
man, John Isaacs, Wilson, Burt,
and Brad Hodgeman playing the
other singles.
