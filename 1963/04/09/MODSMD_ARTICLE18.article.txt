# Golfers Capture 29th Straight Match Win
## 
### 
I Stanford’c golfers are current
ly the hottest team in the univer
sity. with a record of 29 straight
dual match victories reaching
j hack to 1960. This season they
j have nearly always completely
j outclassed their opposition, and
must he considered the favorites
for the conference title.
Led by senior Pete Choate, one
of the coast’s finest young golf
ers. coach Bud Finger’s crew last
weekend swept past Alameda
State and Fresno State.
CIIOATI: FIRFI) a four-under
par 67 on the Sequoia course
against Alameda in Stanford’s
22 , i.-4'u win. Sophomore Bob
Ireland was second with TO. Ala
meda had only five of the regula
tion six men present, but the In
dians charitably conceded three
points. Hugh Goodpasture, who
shot a 74, thereby “lost” to a
non existent Alameda man.
Going into the Fresno Slate
match, coach Finger was really
worried. Fresno had just beaten
DSC, UCLA, and other good
southern teams in a tournament,
and it looked like Stanford’s
I streak might he broken.
All worries were swept aside
when Stanloi d won by an unbe-

Movable 26 , a- 1 -a margin. Choate
again led with a TO on the Stan
ford course, followed by Jim
Rheim’s 71. Ireland carded a 71,
Dave Cotton a 73, Lee Secrist a j
74, and Ralph Marron a 74.
LAST YEAR USC won the
AAWU golf tournament, and thus j
became conference champs, al-1
though Finger points out that
Stanford, which won all AAWU
dual matches, actually was the
best team.
The frosh team, though having
lost all its matches, has been
steadily improving. Last week
Menlo Junior College won a nar
row 14-13 match. Greg Picard’s
75 led the Card frosh.
On April 11-13 Stanford goes
to Pasatiempo, Calif., for a tour
nament involving most West
Coast teams.
