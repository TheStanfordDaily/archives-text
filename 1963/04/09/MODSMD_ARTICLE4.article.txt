# Ability to Relate to Others Meaningfully Comprises Challenge of Sponsoring
## 
### JOHN STEINBRUNER 
Head Wilbur Sponsor

Applications arc now available
for the freshman men’s sponsor
program, and in urging all those
interested to apply I would like
to comment upon the nature of
the Sponsor Program.
The idea of a residence pro
gram emanates from the funda
mental tenet that education is, or
should bo, a total process and
thus should involve aspects of
life which go far beyond the con
cerns of a formal curriculum.
THE UNIVERSITY faces real
difficulty in committing itself to a
concern for the entire range of
the student’s activity; for, in mat
ters of personal values, no indi
vidual student is willing to give
to the university Ihc authority
which he will recognize in the
academic disciplines.
It is the stated goal of higher
education to induce in the student
a systematic re-examination of
values so that old beliefs and in
terests will he rationally chal
lenged and new' ones will be de
veloped; but, beyond basic social
minimums, the individual alone
is responsible for determining
such matters.
Thus it seems that the univer
sity in committing itself to the

total process of education faces
an area of this process whose
content and procedures it cannot
determine.
The University’s concern in the
life of the individual student must
be persuasive, supportive, en
couraging, but not authoritative
or directive.
IN ATTEMPTING to find the
proper balance, the University
has given a large measure of re
sponsibility to the students them
selves in the form of the various
residence programs.
The sponsor manifests a special
concern for the student in the
freshman year, and his general
goals are to help further the edu
cational process in all areas of
freshman life, especially those
not covered by the curriculum.
Given this philosophy, the spon
sor is confronted on one hand
with the extent of the Universi
ty's cultural, athletic, and recre
ational programs plus the multi
tudinous possibilities for indi
vidual and collective activity, and,
on the other hand, with the po
tential and initiative of the fresh
men. What he does in this situa- j
lion is very much determined by
his own judgment and ability.
THERE IS no prescribed course j
of action or set of qualifications J
for the sponsor. The range and
specific nature of his concern is
largely determined by himself, I
the other sponsors, and the fresh
men with whom he works.
His effectiveness or success
must be defined in his own terms,
and perhaps the only generaliza
tion which can be made is that
such success will depend to a
large extent on his ability to re
late to other people in a meaning
ful way.
As has been borne out time and
time again, the impact of the
sponsor on those with whom he
works is tremendous, and. con
comitantly, so is his responsibili
ty. His job is simply and undeni
ably important.
In seeking applicants, we are
looking for people who have rec
ognized this fact, and who want
to take the responsibility upon
themselves.
THE NEW sponsors will bo
chosen by moans of a written ap
plication and an interview. Those
interested in applying are en
couraged to attend a meeting at
7 p.m. Wednesday in the Trancos
Lounge.
The purpose of the meeting is
to explain the selection process
and to answer any questions
about applications or the job of
a sponsor which an applicant
might have.
Interviews will be held on
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
of this week. All arc eligible who
will be either a junior or a senior
next year, and those interested
should schedule an interview in
the Wilbur Office as soon as pos
sible.
Application blanks must be
filled out and submitted before
the interview and the absolute
deadline for applications is Fri-
I day noon.

The University’s concern in the
life of the individual student must
be persuasive, supportive, en
couraging, but not authoritative
or directive.
IN ATTEMPTING to find the
proper balance, the University
has given a large measure of re
sponsibility to the students them
selves in the form of the various
residence programs.
The sponsor manifests a special
concern for the student in the
freshman year, and his general
goals are to help further the edu
cational process in all areas of
freshman life, especially those
not covered by the curriculum.
Given this philosophy, the spon
sor is confronted on one hand
with the extent of the Universi
ty's cultural, athletic, and recre
ational programs plus the multi
tudinous possibilities for indi
vidual and collective activity, and,
on the other hand, with the po
tential and initiative of the fresh
men. What he does in this situa- j
lion is very much determined by
his own judgment and ability.
THERE IS no prescribed course j
of action or set of qualifications J
for the sponsor. The range and
specific nature of his concern is
largely determined by himself, I
the other sponsors, and the fresh
men with whom he works.
His effectiveness or success
must be defined in his own terms,
and perhaps the only generaliza
tion which can be made is that
such success will depend to a
large extent on his ability to re
late to other people in a meaning
ful way.
As has been borne out time and
time again, the impact of the
sponsor on those with whom he
works is tremendous, and. con
comitantly, so is his responsibili
ty. His job is simply and undeni
ably important.
In seeking applicants, we are
looking for people who have rec
ognized this fact, and who want
to take the responsibility upon
themselves.
THE NEW sponsors will bo
chosen by moans of a written ap
plication and an interview. Those
interested in applying are en
couraged to attend a meeting at
7 p.m. Wednesday in the Trancos
Lounge.
The purpose of the meeting is
to explain the selection process
and to answer any questions
about applications or the job of
a sponsor which an applicant
might have.
Interviews will be held on
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
of this week. All arc eligible who
will be either a junior or a senior
next year, and those interested
should schedule an interview in
the Wilbur Office as soon as pos
sible.
Application blanks must be
filled out and submitted before
the interview and the absolute
deadline for applications is Fri-

Applications arc now available
for the freshman men’s sponsor
program, and in urging all those
interested to apply I would like
to comment upon the nature of
the Sponsor Program.
The idea of a residence pro
gram emanates from the funda
mental tenet that education is, or
should bo, a total process and
thus should involve aspects of
life which go far beyond the con
cerns of a formal curriculum.
THE UNIVERSITY faces real
difficulty in committing itself to a
concern for the entire range of
the student’s activity; for, in mat
ters of personal values, no indi
vidual student is willing to give
to the university Ihc authority
which he will recognize in the
academic disciplines.
It is the stated goal of higher
education to induce in the student
a systematic re-examination of
values so that old beliefs and in
terests will he rationally chal
lenged and new' ones will be de
veloped; but, beyond basic social
minimums, the individual alone
is responsible for determining
such matters.
Thus it seems that the univer
sity in committing itself to the

total process of education faces
an area of this process whose
content and procedures it cannot
determine.
