### 
College Press Service
CHICAGO—Two Wheaton college students have joined the list
of students to fall before school boards of publication, after they
tiad published an off-campus magazine previously discouraged by
school officials.
Jack Hommcs, editor of the campus newspaper, was removed
from his office of a “breach of faith,” and Philip Mcllnay, his partner
in publishing the magazine, was ejected from the school by the
Faculty Committee on Student Affairs for “disregard for the spirit
of the college.”
The content of Critique was not a factor in the dismissal of
Hommes, a college spokesman said. Mcllnay charged, however, that
the college has been sensitive to student publication, hoping to avoid
adverse publicity for the evangelical protestant college.
In the same week as the Wheaton incident, three editors of a
University of Notre Dame student magazine resigned, charging the
university administration with censorship. Their faculty advisor
withdrew in sympathy.

CHICAGO—Two Wheaton college students have joined the list
of students to fall before school boards of publication, after they
tiad published an off-campus magazine previously discouraged by
school officials.
Jack Hommcs, editor of the campus newspaper, was removed
from his office of a “breach of faith,” and Philip Mcllnay, his partner
in publishing the magazine, was ejected from the school by the
Faculty Committee on Student Affairs for “disregard for the spirit
of the college.”
The content of Critique was not a factor in the dismissal of
Hommes, a college spokesman said. Mcllnay charged, however, that
the college has been sensitive to student publication, hoping to avoid
adverse publicity for the evangelical protestant college.
In the same week as the Wheaton incident, three editors of a
University of Notre Dame student magazine resigned, charging the
university administration with censorship. Their faculty advisor
withdrew in sympathy.

Communist subversion and aggression still constitute a major threat
