# Cunningham Reads Selections; Given Praise by Yvor Winters
## 
### LINDA HESS 
“J. V. Cunningham is one of the few distinguished living
Renaissance scholars, and, incidentally, the greatest living writer
of poetry in English, one of the four or five great poets of the
century, and certainly among the fifteen of twenty masters of the
short poem in all the poetry of the English language.” Thus Yvor

Winters, poet, critic, and profes-"
ser of English at Stanford, intro
duced an evening of poetry read
ing by J. V. Cunningham last
night in Cubberlcy Auditorium.
CUNNINGHAM opened with
the comment that the presence

of some of his former colleagues
from Brandeis made him feel
quite at home at Stanford. “With
my friends Louis Kronenbergor
and Irving Howe, I feel that this
is a sort of Brandeis in Palo Alto.”
Observing that there should be
something for everyone in an eve
ning’s entertainment, Cunning
ham began his reading with “a
poem that “everyone who dislikes
my poetry likes”—“The Phoenix.”
He moved from there to his days
in Montana, and here the precise,
intellectual, unsentimental quali
ties of his poetry began to be
demonstrated.
"I’m not much of a nature
poet,” he remarked simply, “but
I do know three things: rattle
snakes, wheat, hail.” And in the
poem about hail in a barren Mon
tana landscape, there are “no pas
torals . . . but fear, thirst, hun
ger, and this huddled chill.”
CUNNINGHAM proceeded with
his readings and brief commen
taries, dropping sparse hints of
his major themes and of his per
sonality. There was mention of
Haecceity or “thisness,” the idea
that choice is the source of evil,
because, in making a choice, we
automatically exclude everything
outside it. With every choice, ev
ery act, we mar “the blank pages
of perfection.”
Then there were observations
on the epigram form, for which
Cunningham is uniquely notable.
“Since I am the only living epi
grammatist,” he remarked, "I
have to put in a plug for them.”
Cunningham was a bit more gen
erous in providing commentaries
on his readings of the epigrams.
“You have to put a little patter
between the very short ones,” he
explained. “Otherwise it’s too
much like eating peanuts.”
THK PROGRAM approached its
conclusion with a few poems
which (he warned the audience
in advance) were very serious,
and some amusing observations
on the “new religion” prevalent
in American universities—"You
can get an A.B. at Brandeis on
three books: Freud, Marx, and
“Huckleberry Finn.”
The final selection was a dedi
catory poem to his wife. Having
completed the reading, Cunning
ham, who gives the impression
of never wasting a word, briefly
gathered up his papers and left
the stage to warm applause.
