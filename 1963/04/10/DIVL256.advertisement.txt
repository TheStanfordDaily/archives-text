36 DAYS THAT CHANGED THE
PERFORMANCE PICTURE IN AMERICA
In 36 days, starting with the Monte Carlo Rallye
in January of this year, our products have posted a
series of competition wins that have made perform
ance history. Here’s what has happened:
Three V-8 Falcon Sprints were entered in the
Monte Carlo Rallye. This is not a race. It is a trial
of a car’s total capabilities. We did it (nervously) for
the experience and with practically no sense of expec
tation, because we had not entered an event like this
before. One Sprint ended the experiment in a snow
bank. But the others finished 1-2 in their class with
such authority that they moved the good, grey Lon
don Times to say; “The Falcons are part of a power
and performance plan that will shake up motoring in
every country in the world.” That was Number One.
Number Two was a double win in the Pure Oil
Performance Trials. Fords captured Class 1 and Class
2 (for high performance and large V-B’s). Both of
these trials wore for over-all points rolled up in
economy, acceleration and braking tests.
Then, at Riverside in California, in America’s only
long-distance stock car event that is run on a road
course (as opposed to closed circuit, banked tracks
such as the track at Daytona), Dan Gurney pushed
a Ford to first place.
The latest news comes north from Daytona. There
in the open test that tears cars apart—the Daytona
500 —Ford durability conquered the field. Fords
swept the first 5 places . . . something no one else had
equaled in the history of the event. In a competition
—which anyone can enter—designed to prove how
well a car hangs together, 9 Fords finished out of 12
entered ... a truly remarkable record considering
that over 50% of all cars entered failed to finish.
Why do we keep such an interested eye on compe
titions such as these? Is speed important to us?
Frankly, no. The speed capabilities of the leading
American cars are now grouped so closely together
that the differences have no real meaning. To us, who
are building cars, success in this kind of competition
means just one thing: the car is strong. This kind of
performance capability means that the car is so well
built that it can stand up to normal driving—the
kind of day-in, day-out demands you put your own
car through—for thousands of miles longer than less
capable cars.
In tests like the Daytona 500 and Riverside, we
find out in an afternoon what might take us 100,000
test-track miles to discover. We learn how to build
superior strength into suspension systems, steering
systems, drive train, body, tires. Anyone can build
a fast car. What we’re interested in is the concept of
“total” performance.
We believe in this kind of total performance
because the search for performance made the automo
bile the wonderfully efficient and pleasurable instru
ment it is today—and will make it better tomorrow.

performance capability means that the car is so well
built that it can stand up to normal driving—the
kind of day-in, day-out demands you put your own
car through—for thousands of miles longer than less
capable cars.
In tests like the Daytona 500 and Riverside, we
find out in an afternoon what might take us 100,000
test-track miles to discover. We learn how to build
superior strength into suspension systems, steering
systems, drive train, body, tires. Anyone can build
a fast car. What we’re interested in is the concept of
“total” performance.
We believe in this kind of total performance
because the search for performance made the automo
bile the wonderfully efficient and pleasurable instru
ment it is today—and will make it better tomorrow.

36 DAYS THAT CHANGED THE
PERFORMANCE PICTURE IN AMERICA
In 36 days, starting with the Monte Carlo Rallye
in January of this year, our products have posted a
series of competition wins that have made perform
ance history. Here’s what has happened:
Three V-8 Falcon Sprints were entered in the
Monte Carlo Rallye. This is not a race. It is a trial
of a car’s total capabilities. We did it (nervously) for
the experience and with practically no sense of expec
tation, because we had not entered an event like this
before. One Sprint ended the experiment in a snow
bank. But the others finished 1-2 in their class with
such authority that they moved the good, grey Lon
don Times to say; “The Falcons are part of a power
and performance plan that will shake up motoring in
every country in the world.” That was Number One.
Number Two was a double win in the Pure Oil
Performance Trials. Fords captured Class 1 and Class
2 (for high performance and large V-B’s). Both of
these trials wore for over-all points rolled up in
economy, acceleration and braking tests.
Then, at Riverside in California, in America’s only
long-distance stock car event that is run on a road
course (as opposed to closed circuit, banked tracks
such as the track at Daytona), Dan Gurney pushed
a Ford to first place.
The latest news comes north from Daytona. There
in the open test that tears cars apart—the Daytona
500 —Ford durability conquered the field. Fords
swept the first 5 places . . . something no one else had
equaled in the history of the event. In a competition
—which anyone can enter—designed to prove how
well a car hangs together, 9 Fords finished out of 12
entered ... a truly remarkable record considering
that over 50% of all cars entered failed to finish.
Why do we keep such an interested eye on compe
titions such as these? Is speed important to us?
Frankly, no. The speed capabilities of the leading
American cars are now grouped so closely together
that the differences have no real meaning. To us, who
are building cars, success in this kind of competition
means just one thing: the car is strong. This kind of
performance capability means that the car is so well
built that it can stand up to normal driving—the
kind of day-in, day-out demands you put your own
