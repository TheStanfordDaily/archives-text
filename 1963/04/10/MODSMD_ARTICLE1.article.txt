According to Draper, Castro
ideas and no clear idea of what
Ho “came to power on the basis 4
of an armed force, not a party.”
UNLIKE THE Russian prole
tariat which was a relatively
small group playing a relatively
largo role at crucial moments.
Draper secs the Cuban working
class as a “relatively large class
which played a relatively small
role.”
Castro was able to seize power
when the middle class forces join
ed his 26th of July Movement in
desperation after “all other ef
forts had failed.” Once in power
he was able to dispense with
their support and sustain power
through charismatic appeal.
DRAPER WENT on 10 state
that Fidelism needs world com
munism to give it a doctrine and
a social and economic pattern.
He stated that Cuba’s commu
nism represents the “latest and
most drastic form of extreme
Communist revisionism. His re
visionism primarily concerns the
road to power.”
Castro’s conception of the road
to power as set forth in a speech
made last January involves four
points: 1. The masses make his
tory but must be launched into
battle by a revolutionary group.
2. The masses can be launched by
a very small group. 3. Conditions
for revolution exist in most Latin
American countries and only
need the revolutionary group to
launch the masses. 4. Peaceful
transitions are possible, but there
are no cases on record. Thus Jn
most Latin American countries an
armed revolt is needed.
ACCORDING to Fidelismo,
force should be used now and al
most everywhere in Latin Amer
ica by a handful of guerrillas
even if they are within a weak
party or outside the party.
Whereas Lenin's vanguard of
1 he revolution, was a class, Cas
tro's vanguard is the small guer
rilla band.
Thus, according to Draper, Fi
delismo “represents a peculiar
cross-fertilization of the Latin
American revolutionary tradition
and the European Communist tra
dition,” just as Leninism repre
sented a cross-fertilization of the
Russian revolutionary tradition
and the European Marxist tradi
tion.”
CASTRO HAS avoided support
ing either Russia or China, thus
leaving himself room to maneu
ver, “If anything, Fidel is a Fi
delisto,” and not a Titoist, Lenin
ist, or any other defined type of
Communist. Draper stated that
the Cubans now consider them
selves to be “one of the main
tendencies within the world com
munist movement.”
Castro has “staked out for him
self a Communist sphere of in
fluence” which is to be placed
equally with Khrushchev’s and
Man Tse-t ung’s. Castro sees Cuba
as the example for Latin Ameri
ca to follow rather than Russia
or China.
Castro threatens the hegemony
of Russia in Latin America. He
is unwilling to compromise with
Communist tendencies which
stand in the way of the road to
power. Thus, said Draper, the
achievement of Castro’s aims in
Latin America could “mark a fur
ther division of w’orld commu
nism.”

the Cubans now consider them

Castro has “staked out for him

equally with Khrushchev’s and

Castro threatens the hegemony
of Russia in Latin America. He
is unwilling to compromise with
Communist tendencies which
stand in the way of the road to
power. Thus, said Draper, the
achievement of Castro’s aims in
Latin America could “mark a fur

small group playing a relatively

class as a “relatively large class

Castro was able to seize power
when the middle class forces join

desperation after “all other ef
forts had failed.” Once in power
he was able to dispense with
their support and sustain power
through charismatic appeal.
DRAPER WENT on 10 state
that Fidelism needs world com
munism to give it a doctrine and
a social and economic pattern.
He stated that Cuba’s commu
nism represents the “latest and
most drastic form of extreme
Communist revisionism. His re
visionism primarily concerns the
road to power.”
Castro’s conception of the road
to power as set forth in a speech
made last January involves four
points: 1. The masses make his
tory but must be launched into
battle by a revolutionary group.
2. The masses can be launched by
a very small group. 3. Conditions
for revolution exist in most Latin
American countries and only
need the revolutionary group to
launch the masses. 4. Peaceful
transitions are possible, but there
are no cases on record. Thus Jn
most Latin American countries an
armed revolt is needed.
ACCORDING to Fidelismo,
force should be used now and al
most everywhere in Latin Amer
ica by a handful of guerrillas
even if they are within a weak
party or outside the party.
Whereas Lenin's vanguard of
1 he revolution, was a class, Cas
tro's vanguard is the small guer

Thus, according to Draper, Fi
delismo “represents a peculiar
cross-fertilization of the Latin
American revolutionary tradition
and the European Communist tra
dition,” just as Leninism repre
sented a cross-fertilization of the
Russian revolutionary tradition
and the European Marxist tradi
