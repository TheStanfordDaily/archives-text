# Historical Relativist Idea of E. H. Carr Rebutted by Hexter
## 
### 
The historical relativist theory
of E. H. Carr that holds that ail
history is relative to the historian
who wrote it and to his sociologi
cal environment was rebutted
yesterday by Dr. J. H. Hexter in
his speech "The Historian and His
Society: A Sociological Inquiry
Perhaps’’ at Tresidder Union.
“History is a profession, a soci
ety in itself." said Hexter, a pro
fessor of History at Washington
University, “and it would not be
possible for any historian to re
flect more than a very small part
of his society.” Membership in
the historical profession entails
the following requisites: a knowl
edge that “we are here only to
get history written, not to get it
taught," an inclination toward
teaching because that is usually
the only way an historian can
make a living, and a willingness
to be judged and rejudged by
one’s peers in the society.
The work involved weeds out
all but the most enthusiastic, and
the forthcoming criticism does
much to place the historian in his
society. In this way, the profes
sional historian is categorized in
his society, but that does not ne
cessarily mean that he mirrors it.
