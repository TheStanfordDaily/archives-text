# Students Find Valuable Friendships In Community Service to Mentally III
## 
### WENDY DORTORT 
The Stanford Mental Health
Field Work Project is a group of
twenty or so Stanford students
who render service to the com
munity by giving weekly parties.
These parties have a very special
nature, however: they are given
for patients of the Agnew State
Mental Hospital.
The Project workers are ush
ered into a room with about sev
enty patients. They serve re
freshments, dance with the pa
tients. and strike up conversa
tions which often stray to topics
deeply personal to both patient
and worker. As one worker said,
sometimes it becomes difficult to
tell the patient from the student.
The group lias recently gained
some financial support from the
Palo Alto Mental Health Society,
an independent organization of
teachers and doctors. This will
make it possible for the Project
members to supply their own re
freshments at the parties and ex
tend their program to include
the Veteransâ€™ Administration Hos
pital. The group also intends to

incorporate half-hour discussions
into their activities.
Project members provide the
patients with real human, as op
posed to third-person, contact.
Many warm and deeply personal
relationships grow up between
worker and patient. As in group
therapy sessions, many patients
feel encouraged enough to blurt
out their personal history, goals,
and ambitions. The atmosphere
so engendered oftentimes pro
duces the same reaction on the
part of the students.
Project workers find that they
communicate more with the pa
tients than with each other. Some
say that they rely on Agnew for
their most dramatic contact with
people, as compared with the
apathy often encountered in dorm
situations.
The work is especially reward
ing because patients often con
tinue to thank workers even after
an acquaintance of as much as
three months, while the workers
feel that they are gaining much
more by the relationship than
they are giving.
