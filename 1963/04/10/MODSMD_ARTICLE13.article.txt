# Stanford Delegates Split At CYR College Meet
## 
### HOPE SELBY 
A debate over the constitutionality of procedure in the cre
dentials committe of last week’s California Young Republicans
College Federation convention led to the split not only of the
convention itself, but also of the Stanford delegation present.
Trouble began when John Roveda, head of the credentials

committee, declared the unconsti--
tutionality of the rules under
which the committee had been
operating for the past two and
one-half hours.
The majority of the delegations
admitted ot the convention by the
committee had been conservative
when Roveda, W’ho had been ap
pointed by Harold Phillips, mod
erately liberal president of the
CYR's, stated that proceedings
up to that time had been unconsti
tutional. There was at that time
some question over the admission
of Occidental College, whose dele
gation was moderately conserva
tive.
WHEREAS THE CYR consti

tut ion stated that only schools
without proper charters or with
two separate delegations could
be excluded from the conference,
Roveda and Phillips proposed
that any delegation about which
there was any dispute should be
eliminated.
Robert Gaston, President of the
California Young Republicans (of
which the college federation is a
committee) tried to investigate
this seemingly unconstitutional
attempt to change the rules of the
credentials committee. He was
barred from the room.
Since he was constitutionally
endowed with the power to sit in
on all board meetings, he met
with state board officials John
Pryor and John Gromala and de
cided to put Pryor in charge of
a second credentials commission.
THIS MARKED the split of the
convention into two separate
groups, headed by Gaston and
Phillips. Gaston’s group, the
more conservative, elected Trent
Devenney of Pepperdine college
CYR president.
This convention was declared to
be constitutional by Gromala,
who is YR state legal counsel.
The final decision on which of
the two groups was legal, and
therefore on which of the presi
dents-elect is legal, however, will
not be made until April 26, when
the YR state Executive Board
convenes to decide the question.
The more liberal convention,
headed by Phillips, elected Randy
Seifkin of Santa Barbara presi
dent. This convention voted with
out legal sanction to give their
president the power to dissociate
the College Federation from the
California YR’s.
STANFORD’S delegation, head
ed by Stanford YR president Bar
bara Westerlund, had sixteen del
egates present and twenty-four
votes. The delegation, which re
mained in Gaston’s convention,
split when five of the delegates
left to cast their votes in Phil
lips’ convention.
These members of the delega
tion said they were not fully
aware of the significance of Gro
mala’s declaration that Gaston’s
convention was the legal one, and
felt that by casting their votes in
the other convention, they would
be taking a stand supporting par
ty unity.
THEY FELT, contrary to the
belief of Miss Westerlund and of
ex-president Dick Weinig, that
candidate Seifkin tended to put
his desire to support any Repub
lican party candidate above his
desire to support a candidate just
because he was nominated by a
conservative or liberal group.
Weinig, on the other hand, be
lieved that Devenney would sup
port any Republican candidate
nominated. Thus the delegates
cast four of their votes for Seif
kin in the more liberal conven
tion.
However, when Miss Wester
lund informed them that she
would cast their proxy votes as
they wished if they did not re
turn to the Gaston convention,
they returned and again cast four
of their votes there for Seifkin.
