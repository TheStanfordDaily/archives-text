# STAFF OPINION
## Interview with J. V. Cunningham

Discussions on great matters of Truth and Beauty—especial
ly in universities—are likely to be charged with intensity, a kind
of tacitly recognized ultimateness about the conclusions-reached
by-us-today. But if one happens to be discussing such matters
with J. V. Cunningham, the establishment of communication is
more likely to be acknowledged by a quick smile than by any
thing else.
Cunningham, former English Department Head at Brandeis
University, presently visiting professor of English at Cal’s Santa
Barbara campus, and, according to Stanford’s Yvor Winters,
“the most consistently distinguished poet writing in English
today,” presented a program of readings from his poetry Monday
evening.
His answers to this interviewer’s question wore like his
poems: acute and economical, often accompanied by a small
smile which could have meant several things but probably didn’t.
And, like the poems, it is most appropriately presented with little
or no commentary.
Q. Do you think America has turned out any great poets in
the last, say, fifty years?
A. That’s hard to answer without defining “great.” But
American poetry in the last fifty years has been pretty much
alive. Not so alive in the last fifteen years, though. I don’t know
why that is.
Q. How do you think of yourself in relation to general
poetic movements that have been taking shape in this century?
A. I don’t. I’m an academic pro, a scholar and an adminis
trator, not a professional poet.
Q. Perhaps your official profession is that of scholar and
administrator. But don’t you think of yourself more as a poet
than as an academician?
A. No. It does something to people when they start think
ing of themselves as poets. You take on a role. People expect
you to live up to it, and you tend to do what they expect.
Q. Much recent poetry has demonstrated a loose attitude
toward form and tradition, a feeling that subjectivity is as good
a law as any other. Your own poetry is notable for its terseness,
intellectuality, and formal craftsmanship. What do you think
of the other kind?
A. Most poets have been trying to grasp significance for
themselves by varying from tradition. Consequently there are
no more norms to vary from, and they’re in a hell of a mess.
They don’t even know how to write an iambic pentameter line.
(J. Is it important to know how to write an iambic pentam
eter line?
A. Knowing iambic pentameter for a poet is like knowing
the C-scale for a musician.
(J. Your epigrams often give the impression of an objec
tivity bred of detachment. Do you think involvement is unim
portant for the poet?
A. A man who writes poetry can be a professional or an
amateur in two ways: first as a writer, in his concern with
perfection of finish; second in his social role as “poet.” I’m a
professional writer, an amateur poet.
(J. That doesn’t answer the question about involvement.
A. I don’t write lor fun. In fact, I don’t like to write.
Q. Why do you write?
.A. I don’t know . . . just got started, I guess.
Q- Then you think a poet shouldn’t worry about why he
writes?
A. Not unless he’s worried about it.
Q. To what extent do you think the writing of poetry can
be taught—for example, in a university course?
A. You can persuade some students that they ought to
learn their craft. If a student has talent, you can give him an
audience when he needs one and give him some hints as he
progresses to the point where he no longer needs an audience.
