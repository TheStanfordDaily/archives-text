# CONCERT REVIEW
## Entremont: 'Not Warrant Popularity' 
### WALTER MOORE 
Take one handsome young French pianist, one piano with
an easy-action pedal, a large audience, the majority of which is
female, and apparently you have all the ingredients for a suc
cessful concert. The audience, of course, might be that which
filled Memorial Auditorium last Saturday night for the fifth
event of this season’s ASSU Concert Series. The piano is the
venerable Steinway donated by the Lucie Stern Estate; the pi
anist can only have been the charming and much acclaimed
Philippe Entremont.
Such criticism as one may level against Mr. Entremont’s
playing is directed not so much toward a paucity of musical
thought but rather the tonal values with which he projects his
convictions. At best, the characteristic sound could be described
as rough and percussive; at worst, harsh and hammer-like. As
if to compensate for this lack of resonance in the tone, Mr.
Entremont employs the damper pedal with abnormal frequency.
Unfortunately, with the art of pianism, two wrongs do not make
a right; the sound remains harsh and ugly, covered by a thin
veneer of gaudy brilliance which stems from constant over
pedalling.

Thus it was that whatever good intentions Mr. Entremont
may have about playing the Bach B-flat Partite were scarcely to
be discerned in the harmonic blur and contrived accents which
marked his performance. The Beethoven Sonata Op. 31 No. 3
fared slightly better, though the whirlwind tempo and lack of
over-all conception proved unconvincing. Perhaps the best play
ing of the evening was heard in the succeeding Chopin D-flat
Nocturne which was beautifully disciplined and imaginatively
sculptured. The Brahms-Handel Variations also entertained some
expressive moments, but this gigantic work must be projected
with a much greater variety of tonal color and profile to be
completely successful.

Lest the reader imagine this was a monotonously bad con
cert, let him be advised that it was simply undistinguished.
Entremont is undoubtedly a very talented fellow, and he hits all
the notes quite accurately indeed. But the musical personality is
hardly so compelling, the skill so artistically oriented as to war
rant his enormous popularity. He has for many years enjoyed the
security of well-booked American tours and a profitable con
tract with a major record company—recognition, in short, for
which many musicians will be fighting the rest of their lives.
Whether he will grow as an artist can only be revealed by his
efforts in the years to come. At present he is a pianist of quite
limited artistic persuasion.

Entremont is undoubtedly a very talented fellow, and he hits all
the notes quite accurately indeed. But the musical personality is
hardly so compelling, the skill so artistically oriented as to war
rant his enormous popularity. He has for many years enjoyed the
security of well-booked American tours and a profitable con
tract with a major record company—recognition, in short, for
which many musicians will be fighting the rest of their lives.
Whether he will grow as an artist can only be revealed by his
efforts in the years to come. At present he is a pianist of quite
limited artistic persuasion.
Take one handsome young French pianist, one piano with
an easy-action pedal, a large audience, the majority of which is
female, and apparently you have all the ingredients for a suc
cessful concert. The audience, of course, might be that which
filled Memorial Auditorium last Saturday night for the fifth
event of this season’s ASSU Concert Series. The piano is the
venerable Steinway donated by the Lucie Stern Estate; the pi
anist can only have been the charming and much acclaimed
Philippe Entremont.
Such criticism as one may level against Mr. Entremont’s
playing is directed not so much toward a paucity of musical
thought but rather the tonal values with which he projects his
convictions. At best, the characteristic sound could be described
as rough and percussive; at worst, harsh and hammer-like. As
if to compensate for this lack of resonance in the tone, Mr.
Entremont employs the damper pedal with abnormal frequency.
Unfortunately, with the art of pianism, two wrongs do not make
a right; the sound remains harsh and ugly, covered by a thin
veneer of gaudy brilliance which stems from constant over
pedalling.

Thus it was that whatever good intentions Mr. Entremont
may have about playing the Bach B-flat Partite were scarcely to
be discerned in the harmonic blur and contrived accents which
marked his performance. The Beethoven Sonata Op. 31 No. 3
fared slightly better, though the whirlwind tempo and lack of
over-all conception proved unconvincing. Perhaps the best play
ing of the evening was heard in the succeeding Chopin D-flat
Nocturne which was beautifully disciplined and imaginatively
sculptured. The Brahms-Handel Variations also entertained some
expressive moments, but this gigantic work must be projected
with a much greater variety of tonal color and profile to be
completely successful.

Lest the reader imagine this was a monotonously bad con
cert, let him be advised that it was simply undistinguished.
