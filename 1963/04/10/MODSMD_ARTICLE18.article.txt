## 'Bonaparte in Egypt:' Intriguing' 
### JOHN A. BISSELL 
“Bonaparte In Egypt,” by J. Christopher Herold; Harper and
Row; 424 pp.
“On May 19, 1798, at six o’clock in the morning, the French
flagship ‘L'Orient,’ Captain Casablanca, signalled to the
squadron and the convoy assembled in the harbour of Tou
lon to get under sail. For the next eight hours, about a hun
dred and eighty vessels sailed past ‘L’Orient’. . . and, facing
a fresh breeze, struggled with some difficulty in the direction
of Corsica. The spectacle must have been breathtaking.”
The spectacle, the tinsel, the glory, and the nonsense of
Bonaparte’s expedition to Egypt did not end in the sailpast in
the harbour of Toulon; they travelled with the expedition to
Malta, to Alexandria, to waterless, searing hot marches in the
desert where despairing soldiers blew out their brains by the
dozen. While Bonaparte was winning fame and the illusion of
success at the Battle of the Pyramids, his admirals, (or was it
Bonaparte himself, as Mr. Herold argues?) were losing the
Battle of the Nile and the campaign. Desaix, Kleber, Mongo, Dr.
Desgenettes, Nelson, and Bonaparte’s mistress Pauline Foures
(Mr. Herold seems to take peculiar delight in the activities of
the mistresses of the age) trace their patterns, sometimes
tragic, sometimes noble, often pathetic, across the mosaic of
this colorful spectacle. Mr. Herold has mastered this great tale;
of this his careful documentation can leave no doubt.
As history, Mr. Herold’s work raises certain questions.
Bonaparte is presented in an unfavorable light. He is seen as a
hypocrite and opportunist, “the butcher in the Holy Land.”
This is all well and good; it has certainly been said often before.
However, the way in which Mr. Herold arrives at this conclu
sion does not seem to be justified by his own facts, let alone
those of admirers of Bonaparte. He has very harsh words for
Bonaparte’s massacre of several thousand Turkish prisoners
of-war at Jaffa. As regards the immediate question of the pris
oners, Mr. Herold is quite right: it is reprehensible to kill pris
oners, especially when their surrender has been secured by
promises of freedom. However, in the terms of the empire
builders in 1800, in the terms of Bonaparte’s desperate situation
(he could not receive reinforcements from France since his fleet
had been destroyed in the Battle of the Nile) in Egypt, in view
of the fact that he was surrounded by enemy Turkish forces,
Bonaparte had no choice but to kill the prisoners. Empire build
ers are seldom humanitarians; Bonaparte certainly was not.
Once one has dispensed with this aspect of Bonaparte’s person
ality, he can proceed to admire the man whq : would,naake such a
long-odds gamble; that he could? defedt' the Turks, pacify the
Egyptians, and turn Egypt into a flourishing garden of education
and industry. In spite of the fact that Mr. Herold did not pro
ceed to admire Bonaparte, he has writen a most intriguing
book, certainly deserving to be read.
