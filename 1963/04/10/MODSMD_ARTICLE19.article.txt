In his letter of Friday, Mr. Eldon argued against the idea
that “Peace is our only shelter,” by asking “Who’s kidding
who?" Actually, Mr. Elden is kidding himself because he has
overlooked the a priori fact that if we have a secure and lasting
peace, then we will indeed be safe from war. Certainly the ab
sence of war is peace, but what probably bothers Mr. Elden is
that the moment the bomb drops from a peaceful sky, peace
and the Law School with its 250,000 survival crackers will cease
to exist. The issue therefore is not just peace, but the acquisition
of a safe and lasting peace, an ideal not without some risk. In
failing to recognize the difference between the two types, Mr.
Elden has rejected the possibility of any peace whatsoever.
In spite of the risks, there are also some benefits to be
gained from a policy of peace. People basically want to be secure
from danger, and though we hear grandiose odes to the high but
necessary price of freedom, security is what they really want.
Peace is simply a cheaper way of achieving security, but be
cause “security has always cost us,” Mr. Eldon is convinced that
security must cost us, and from here, it is only a step to the
reasoning that, if it costs, it's secure.
Unfortunately, however, there is no completely safe road to
security. While the peace approach has its obvious risks, so does
a strong defense posture. There is always a chance that our own
weapons will be unleashed by mechanical failure, or that an over
emphasis on military spending will subvert the very institutions
and ideals we profess to preserve. And “by letting the Ruskys
know that we’re dug in,” we may lend “an air of seriousness
. . . to our readiness to use our missiles and soldiers” to drop the
bomb on the Russians first, rather than “to protect our country
and fight for what we stand.”
Using Mr. Elden’s cost-effectiveness argument places peace
in a position whose plausibility would prove embarrassing to
him. Both military strength and disarmament involve risk, but
security is far cheaper through peace. And even though disarma
ment might incur more risk, think of the saving. Mr. Elden.
Peace at least deserves consideration as a live option in today’s
politics.

Unfortunately, however, there is no completely safe road to
security. While the peace approach has its obvious risks, so does
a strong defense posture. There is always a chance that our own
weapons will be unleashed by mechanical failure, or that an over
emphasis on military spending will subvert the very institutions
and ideals we profess to preserve. And “by letting the Ruskys
know that we’re dug in,” we may lend “an air of seriousness
. . . to our readiness to use our missiles and soldiers” to drop the
bomb on the Russians first, rather than “to protect our country
and fight for what we stand.”
Using Mr. Elden’s cost-effectiveness argument places peace
in a position whose plausibility would prove embarrassing to
him. Both military strength and disarmament involve risk, but
security is far cheaper through peace. And even though disarma
ment might incur more risk, think of the saving. Mr. Elden.
Peace at least deserves consideration as a live option in today’s
politics.
