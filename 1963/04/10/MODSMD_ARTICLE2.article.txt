## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
Retired British General Sir Ni
gel Poett speaking in Dinkolspiel
Auditorium yesterday afternoon
predicted an eventual free world
victory in Southeast Asia.
“There is no need for the Commu
nists to take Southeast Asia.” he
concluded. “We have the capa
bilities to prevent it, and I’m
quite convinced we will succeed.”
Poett. until recently command
er-in-chief of British Far East
Land Forces, stressed that,
“THE FIGHT against the Com
munist guerrillas is a fight
against ignorance, poverty, and
fear.”
He characterized the present
situation in Viet Nam as “ex
tremely critical for the position
of the free world.”
Vast number of guerrillas, a
long, open frontier, and estab
lished pockets of Communist ac
tivity make the Communist threat
in Viet Nam difficult to counter.
Moreover, the Viet Namese lack
the sense of national solidarity
in the face of an alien invasion
which aided the free world vic
tory in Malaya.
HOWEVER, THE British Gen
eral did not attack the spirit of
the Viet Namese soldiers.
“They're jolly good fighting
men,” he said.
What is needed, he emphasized,
is a political will and a freedom
from the fear that the free world
will desert them in a great crisis.
Poett estimated that the Viet
Namese situation has improved
considerably since the U.S. entry.
The battle will not be short, he
cautioned, but .today there exists
the framework from which a suc
cessful campaign can be fought.
Poett predicted a late August
ratification for the proposed fed
eration of South East Asia states,
Malayasia. Malayasia is to in
clude Malaya, Singapore, and the
three Borneo territories and is in
tended to act as a focus for anti
communist resistance.
Poett concluded that Malayasia
will be extremely important in
establishing stability in South
east Asia.
