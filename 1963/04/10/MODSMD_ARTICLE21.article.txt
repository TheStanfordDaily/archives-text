## Buck Club: Financers Of Stanford Athletics 
### PETE KING 
Most followers of Stanford sports at one time or another wonder
why so many good athletes can afford to come to an expensive uni
versity like Stanford.
Most of these people come to the conclusion that these athletes
are either talented or brilliant enough to qualify for Stanford ath
letic and academic scholarships, or that fortunately for Stanford,
many athletes have rich parents.
These assumptions turn out to he largely false, however. For
over 30 years, Stanford has not offered aid of any sort to a student
solely because of his athletic ability. The university doles out grants
in-aid anil scholarships on the basis of brains only.
Moreover, the number of athletes receiving scholarships and
the number of those who can afford $2280 a year for tuition, board,
and room is small enough so that a considerable number of Stan
ford’s athletes are faced with a huge gap between the costs and
what they can pay.
Bridging this gap is a little-known private organization of nearly
3000 members called the Stanford Buck Club. Its purpose is to pay
wholly or in part the tuition of needy athletes who might otherwise
find it impossible to attend Stanford.
Composed of 75 per cent Stanford alums, this club has since 1934
aided over 1000 athletes in all sports. The importance of this aid is
stressed by Club secretary-treasurer Chuck Taylor, who comments,
“Without these tuition grants from the Club, athletics here would
be a lost cause.”
The club collects its funds entirely within its membership, and
is currently raising $165,000 to help some 121 athletes during the
1963-64 school year. All told, 115 students are receiving Buck Club
support (his year, most of them getting it throughout their four
years here.
Although most of the aid goes to football players, all major
sports are represented. Last year there were 65 football grants, 14
in track, 12 in basketball, nine in baseball, two in swimming,
and one each in tennis, golf, and I Mixing.
Well over half of these athletes also earn their hoard and room
by hashing or working in the Corp yard.
Currently the Club is expanding barely fast enough to keep up
with the administration’s boosts in tuition every two years. The
latest hike of $l5O a year has put a crimp in the club’s finances, with
the result that the $165,000 raised will barely aid another 121 stu
dents next year. The tuition boost will also increase other students’
financial needs, and Taylor expects the Club to be overburdened in
the near future.
Stanford is practically unique on the Coast in its policy of not
aiding a student solely for athletic ability. Ollier Big Six schools
like USC help swell Ihe ranks of their teams by offering free tuition
to athletes unable to pay the lower costs or qualify for scholarships.
Needless to say, were the Buck Club not to exist, over one hun
dred athletes a year would find a Stanford education far too costly,
and athletics on the Farm would fall to a level equal to or below that
of the Ivy League schools.
