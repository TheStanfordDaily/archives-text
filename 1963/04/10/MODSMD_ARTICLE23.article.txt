# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## Most Popular Sport On the Farm? 
### Glenn Alford 
If the number of participants means anything, the most popu
lar sport at Stanford is—not football, not track, not baseball—it’s
lacrosse.
Slightly over a month ago 10(1 lacrosse fanatics turned out for
Stanford’s first lacrosse team. The numbers have diminished slight
ly since then, but there are still 60 full time players, 20 part-timers
and 10 injured or walking-wounded, for a total of 90 affiliated with
the Stanford Lacrosse Club. Perhaps the 6:45 a.m. running and the
heavy workouts in the afternoon account for the defections. Lacrosse
is a sport that requires top physical condition.
The theory of lacrosse is to move a hard rubber ball down a
field slightly larger than a football field by carrying it in curved
sticks with leather-net pockets. It is legal to hit the player from the
elbow to the finger tips with the stick. For this reason heavy gloves
are worn.
Goals are on each end of the field and are protected by goalies.
In this and the body checking, lacrosse slightly resembles hockey.
The teams are 10 men, divided into three groups of three men each,
the attackers, the midfielders and the defenders. The goalies are the
tenth men.
The man responsible for Stanford’s entrance into the world of
college lacrosse is Peter Faulkner, who has donated time, money and
vocal talents to the cause.
Boh Young, manager of operations for the Stanford Athletic
Department and the man responsible for allocating practice fields
to all Stanford teams, has called Faulkner “a nut,” and he agrees.
So do team members. And indeed he is “a nut,” the kind of “a nut”
who would donate almost his entire savings toward equipment and
scheduling.
He has already drawn up a schedule including five games, and
a demonstration for (he Alumni, over the last six weeks of the
quarter. In addition, the Air Force Academy wants to play Stanford
and a game will be arranged for next year.
Some of the best players in (he United States will be on the
team, including All-American Grady Watts (Harvard) who w r as the
third leading scorer in the U.S. last year. However Watts and some
other ex-AH-Americans from a few years hack are only part-timers
and won’t be used regularly. They will, instead, bolster the regulars,
many of whom are freshmen and ex-allstars from eastern prep
schools.
The players who will see the most action are goalies Carey Cook
and Toby Hayes; attackers Howie Taylor. Bob Murphy, Tuck Peter
son and Steve Mullin; mid fielders Bart Deamer, George Peters, Tony
King and Parker Llewellyn; and defenders Ed Rathje, Bill Heyn.
Ken DeNault and Chip Greening.
Faulkner has done much of the work organizing the Club, but
he isn’t, coaching. Hal Louchheim of the Stanford Graduate School
of Business handles that chore, and he eminently qualified to do so.
Louchheim is an ex-Harvard coach and player.
Here’s hoping Stanford can become the Harvard of the West in
at least one aspect, lacrosse. The Crimson were 11-4 last year.

Stanford Track Coach Payton Jordan is held in high regard by
all U.S. track coaches, but that admiration doesn’t stop once it
reaches our territorial boundaries. Jordan got a telegram yesterday
morning. It read: SINCERELY CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR
APPOINTMENT HEAD COACH OF USA TRACK TEAM STOP
REGARDS USSR LIGHT ATHLETIC FEDERATION (VLADIMIR)
SADOVSKIY (GAVRIEL) KOROBKOV. Sadovskiy is the business
manager of the USSR track group and Korobkov is the head coach
of the Russian track team.
