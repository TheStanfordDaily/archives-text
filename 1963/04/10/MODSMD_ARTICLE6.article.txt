# Wilbur Hall Sponsor Defines His Own Role
## 
### JAMES WOOLSEY Wilbur Sponsor 
A sponsor in Wilbur defines
his own role. For this reason any
statement of what a sponsor is
or is not is of necessity highly
subjective. But it seems to me
that two misconceptions should
be cleared up.
A sponsor has very litle obli
gation to be a disciplinarian; he
should inform the freshmen at
the beginning of the year that
liquor and women are not allow-

Ed in the rooms, but aside from
this, his concern with behavior is
based on friendship, not regula
tions. Nor is he a psychiatrist.
Severe psychological problems do
arise, but they are not frequent
and there are others who are far
better qualified to deal with them.
A sponsor’s chief concern, I
feel, should he education; this
I does not mean a concern solely
with his own or others’ class
| room performances,
i A concern for education is evi

denced by the realization that
criticism cannot be confined to
civ class, that fun need not be
limited to parties—the realiza
tion that learning, acting, and
specializing should not bo pigeon
holes into which a student com
partmentalizes his life, but rather
components of an integrated edu
cational experience.
No one will tell a sponsor that
he should invite professors and
foreign students in for dinner,
take the time to get into a bull
session over coffee, or play on
the house softball team—he is the
only one who will know whether
he is contributing something to
his own and others’ education or
only treading in the old ruts.
A sponsor may find that he
wants to encourage certain
house activities at the beginning
of the year, but he soon works
himself out of this job as he re
alizes that the freshmen have
not only more time than he does,
but also more ideas.
He will also probably have
some obligation to the sponsor
body as a whole, such as organiz
ing the Great Professor Series
or making arrangements for the
Guests-in-Residence. But his most
important duties are very mun
dane and ho creates them him
self several times a day.
His rewards are as difficult l«
articulate as his duties, but I
believe they center around a
deeper understanding of himself,
others, and education.

There will be a meeting
held in Arroyo Lounge to
night at 7 pm. to answer
questions for all those inter
ested in applying for sponsor
next year. Applications are
due by Friday of this week,
but interviews will not be
held until April 25-36-27.
