# Society's Part in Liberal Arts To Be Discussed by Goodman
## 
### 
Paul Goodman will speak today on “The Responsibility of So
ciety,” at 4:15 pan., in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Mr. Goodman’s
lecture will be the first in the series "The Revitalization of the
Liberal Arts” which is a forum on the role of liberal education
sponsored by the Stanford Today and Tomorrow Committee and

ASSU. Mr. Goodman, who is the
author of “The Community of
Scholars” and “Growing Up Ab
surd,” is an advocate of the view
that in American colleges, the
aim of scholarship has been ig
nored in favor of the production
of “marketable skills,” which is
(he goal of the administrators
who have supplanted educators in
the organization of the colleges.

In his books, Mr. Goodman is
critical of the loss of scholarly
initiative and professional com
petence which results from this
misallocation of responsibility,
and he claims that the only re
course is to the formation of
genuine communities of scholars
which would be dedicated to the
refreshment of the larger com
munity through insistence on
higher purposes than the produc
tion of skilled technicians. Mr.
Goodman’s talk today will cover
this thesis and related topics.
In agreement with the format
of the forum of which his speech
is a part, Mr. Goodman will pre
sent his major address and then
will hold an open discussion with
the help of selected students and
faculty members.
Mi - . Goodman will be a guest
in-residence at Wilbur Hall from
today until Saturday.
