# Enlarged LASSU to Convene Under New Constitution Today
## 
### ROBERT CURRY 
The new Constitution of the Associated Students will be in
effect for the first time, when Legislature convenes in Tresidder
Lounge tonight at 7:30. The major issues to be discussed include
changes in By-Laws, campus boundaries, and a report from the
Appropriations Committee. Since new By-Laws have not yet

■been approved, Iho meeting will
be operating in accordance with
the old By-Laws, Topics of pri
mary importance involve changes
in the By-Laws made necessary
by the new constitution and the
recommendations of the old Leg
islature.

THE BY-LAWS Committee has
recommended several revisions in
the old By-Laws. To be consider
ed will be disciplinary regulations
with respect to the new volun
tary organizations, redefinition
of open and closed functions, and
the reconstruction of the com
mittee system in LASSU.
Specifically concerned with the
organization and functioning of
Legislature are subjects such as
frequency of meetings, definition
of membership and elections,
rules of procedure, and election
and powers of the new Speaker.
Controversy is expected over
an Appropriations Committee re
port to be brought before Legisla
ture. The subject of what is
“off” and what is “on” campus,
and the opening of Lake Lagunita
for the Spring Quarter will also
be discussed.
THE NEW' constitution allows
for the continuing operation of
the present rules of the boards
and commissions of the ASSU;
therefore, no attempt will be
made at this first meeting to re
vise these rules in order to bring
them into agreement with the
new constitution. Legislature
shall not consider the revision of
their rules until later in the quar
ter.
It is important that all mem
bers, old and new, attend the
meeting, since the business to be
conducted tonight will influence
most of the activity of Legisla
ture for the next few years. Also,
decisions concerning the old By-
Laws require a two-thirds quor
um. Any other interested per
sons are invited to attend this
meeting.
