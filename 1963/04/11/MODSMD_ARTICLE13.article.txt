Susana y Jose, a Spanish danc
ing team will make its Bay Area

Their concert is sponsored by
the Committee on Public Exer
cises and will begin at 8 p.m.
Tickets are $1 for students and
$2 for general admission. They
are available from Tresidder Un
ion ticket office.
The program will include clas
sical, dramatic Spanish dancing,
flamenco, Spanish folk numbers
and zapateado—dancing in which
the man’s boothecls are stamped
in intricate time.
Susana Audeoud, the Susana
part of the company, studied bal
let in Paris, art in Florence and
returned to her native Spain for
study in Spanish dance with such
masters as Estampio, La Quica
and Pericet.
Jose Udaeta, son of an aristo
cratic Basque family, studied bal
let at the opera in Barcelona and
Spanish dance in the same city.
A chance meeting of Susana
and Jose in Barcelona led to the
creation of the dance company.
