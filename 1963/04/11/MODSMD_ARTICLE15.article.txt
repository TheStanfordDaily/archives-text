## 'Reform and Revolution' 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
As we look at the revolutions in Argentina, Peru and Guate
mala, the elections in Chile, the tension in Venezuela and the
enormous problems of Brazil, we come face to face with a very
disturbing question. Can orderly and reasonably progressive
governments endure through the long period of time which
must elapse before the promises of the Alliance for Progress
bear fruit?
The alliance is committed to a radical reform in the social
order of Latin America. We must not underestimate how diffi
cult and how unusual is such a commitment. The governments
of Latin America are in the midst of these difficulties. If they
improve the standard of living too slowly, they are threatened
from the left; if they proceed rapidly, they are threatened from
the right. If the radical reform is to succeed, it means that in
each country there must be a government which holds the con
fidence of the masses on the left and does not arouse the irrecon
cilable opposition of the upper classes on the right.
The crux of the problem is that progressive reform is in its
very nature a long and slow process, a matter of long years with
meager results to show in the beginning. The main talking point
of the revolutionists of the Castro type is the disappointing and
uninspiring gradualism of reform. And at the same time, the
main talking point of the big landlords, the rich conservatives
and the military dictators of the rebellious right is that the re
formers will be captured by the revolutionists. To many of the
most benighted among them, all reformers are revolutionists.
While it is possible to speed up reform somewhat, it is un
avoidably a slow and prosaic business. It takes more than 10
years to educate and train a professional and managerial class.
It takes a good many years to reform agriculture so as to liber
ate the country from dependence on one or two crops. Indus
trialization requires a capital investment not only in particular
plants, but in the communications system of the country and its
power facilities.
Furthermore, the development of Latin America will re
quire the negotiations of complex world-wide commodity agree
ments and trading opportunities. It will require, also, big mea
sures to relieve the pressure upon the world's monetary re
serves and so to overcome the deflationary lack of liquidity
which is today so big a cause of instability in the non-Commu
nist world.
Speaking roughly, the slowness and complexity of reform
is the real problem in Latin America. Castro did not create the
problem, and the problem would still be there, would still, as a
matter of fact, be there in Cuba itself, if Castro took up resi
dence in Russia. There would be no Castro if Castro’s predeces
sors had solved the problem of reform. There would be no
Castro if his predecessors had even tried to solve the problem
of reform.
The problem that has to be solved is how orderly and pro
gressive government can earn the patience of the masses by
instituting installments of the necessary reforms, and yet not be
denounced as Communists and ousted by the reactionaries.
