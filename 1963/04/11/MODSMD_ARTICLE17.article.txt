In consonance with the seemingly over-all bent toward sti
fling intellectualism on the Stanford campus the Main Library
has once again receded into the Dark Ages with the closing of its
doors on Saturday and Sunday at 5 p.m.
Disgruntled, and with ears still bussing from that noxious
bell that someone insists on ringing much longer than is neces
sary even for those of us with ear plugs to hear, the scowling
scholar scoops up a hundred-and-one note cards, thirteen books,
clipboard, notebook, raincoat and umbrella, and trudges toward
a study room on Quad. Once there he proceeds to balance books
on his left knee while holding the clipboard on his right and
peering toward his note cards neatly strewn about on the floor.
This is all assuming he’s been lucky enough to find one of the
rooms left open on Quad. Once settled he discovers that the per
son next to him (whose shoulder Is four inches away from his)
has epilepsy and he gets to sway and churn to his rhythmic
motions the remainder of the precious time he is allowed to
study.
Promptly at 12 midnight when “our student” has finally
begun to really concentrate, one of our beloved Quad cops slips
and pulls the window behind him down from the outside, at the
same time emitting a cheery “good night.” Our scowling (and
by this time really scowling! scholar proceeds to scrape himself
off the ceiling, gather up his thirteen books, one hundred-and
one note cards, clipboard, notebook, raincoat and umbrella,
wits, grumble good night and stumble wearily back to Turkey
Town. Approaching his room he is just in time to catch a coffee
cup (being used as a bowling ball) on the ankle as he fumbles
for his key. Once safe inside his room he lurches for the desk
and flashes on the light, only to find he’s just awakened his
roommate who, frustrated by his 11 academic units and 2 gym
courses, has decided to sack out early. Books in hand he’s back
in the hall, this time dodging a dry land surfer who’s keeping
in shape for summer whizzing up and down on a skateboard.
Relatively unscathed by this atrocity he rounds the corner
to the house lounge only to find a couple of physics majors
vocally preparing this week’s problem set.
Exasperated, frustrated, and probably constipated, he col
lapses in bed, knowing only too well that the morrow will bring
sunshine at 6 and the Kingston Trio at 6:30.
All this is byway of asking why? Why close the library at
15 on Saturday? Why open it at 1 on Sunday and then close it at
5, after only 4 hours of open time? Why have so few rooms open
on Quad? Why must these be closed at 12 every night? Is this
all part of some insidious plan to control and dictate the stu
dent’s study time, to regiment him into some sore of “all round
Stanford man” by leaving him no choice but to frolic after 5 on
weekends? What of the student who does his most creative work
at times different from decided for him by the administration?
Isn’t it paradoxical that a school such as Stanford that claims to
foster individual creativity and its development at the same
time seeks to throttle it by seemingly arbitrary prevention of a
student’s deciding when he is to study?

Editors, The Daily;
As Executive Vice President of the Stanford Area Young
Republicans, representing the Club in last week’s College Fed
eration Convention, I feel it necessary to clarify yesterday’s
Daily article concerning the “CYR College Meet.”
A picture was presented of a few confused Stanford Dele
gates flaunting obvious legality to vote for a liberal candidate
for College Federation President. However, I would point out
that this version is inconsistent with fact.
The five Stanford Delegates, including myself, Vice-Presi
dent Paul Finney, Board Members Steve Hoglund and Judy Paes
ler, and Delegate Sharon Crawford, each of whom considers him
self to be conservative, made a concerted effort to vote their
convictions. It is a mater of debate as to which of the conven
tions was in fact legal. Thus we felt it wise to participate in
the convention that we came to attend, namely that led by Col
lege Federation President Harold Phillips.
At this convention we voted freely for the candidate of our
choice, registering four votes for Randy Seifkin and one for
Trent Devenney, and continued to support conservative candi
dates for subsequent offices. We felt then and feel now that it is
healthy for members of an organization to vole independently.
We also felt that in attending this convention we would repre
sent more accurately the views of the members of the club,
many of whom undoubtedly would have participated in this con
vention.
While voting on the floor, we met with fellow Stanford
Delegates who supported Trent Devenney. We were informed
by them that if we did not leave this convention, our proxies
would be voted, and without our consent. We therefore left Har
old Phillips and joined Trent Devenney, but remained consistent
to our previous actions, nominating Randy Seifkin and voting
four to one in his favor; the rest of our delegation supported
Devenney.
In conclusion, our actions were aimed at showing to our
fellow Delegates, to our Club members, to the Stanford Student
Body, and to Republicans throughout the State, that there is a
place in Young Republicans for all members of the Party. We
sincerely hope that this expression of our views will not go un
heeded.

At the end of last quarter, the Stanford basketball team met
UCLA in a playoff game for the right tp an NCAA "playoff berth.
An attempt was made to get Rally Com to organize a rally, how*
ever makeshift it might have to be because of time limitations.
This idea was rejected on the ground that since The Daily was
not being published, there was no way to organize or publicize
such a rally. The suggestion of a few well-placed telephone calls
was apparently too difficult a concept.
It was then suggested that a telegram of encouragement be
sent to the team. This idea was rejected on the absurd ground
that Rally Com didn’t even have enough money to make a poster
to got people to contribute to such a telegram.
It is unfortunate that a group so disinterested and incapable
is responsible for such activities. It would have taken very little
time and effort to get a few band members and some students
together for a rally. The basketball team provided a lot of en
tertainment and excitement. They sacrificed a lot of their time
and through their sportsmanship and publicity did as much for
PACE and Stanford as can be accomplished by any other means.
They deserved the support of the student body. Rally Com not
only failed to take the initiative in the area which is the very
reason for its existence, it refused to accept the suggestions and
help of others.
We think that enthusiastic support of its athletic teams is
not incompatible with whatever academic visions Stanford stu
dents hold. We also think that the basketball team might have
won at least one of those last three games had they known that
anyone at Stanford was interested. The name Rally Com is a
misnomer and there is no justification for Rally Corn’s continued
existence as a negative force.

In reading K W Smith’s “Poison Ivy Primer,” I was remind
ed of an article I read some time ago in “Private Eye,” a so
callod satirical magazine which has become extremely popular in
England. The writer of that article made a very good point: the
publication is really harmless—the Establishment and the gov
ernment, which the magazine purports to attack with intent to
cause change, merely say, “I say, did you see the new ‘Private
Eye’---ha, ha, jolly funny, what?” And that’s as far as it goes.
Nothing is changed by this supposed criticism.
So it is, it seems to me, with Smith’s “Primer." Everyone is
aware of the Admissions Committee’s ideal of the student who Is
the happy possessor of a healthy mind, a healthy personality,
and a healthy body, and indeed PACE is a daily reminder that
money makes the world go 'round, but so what? Is The Daily
content to stop at this "Primer” which offers only an ironic
laugh? Why doesn’t it commit itself, say, to an anti-frat cam
paign or to some other “reform” move if it feels that it is time
for a change on this campus?
It seems to me that the editors might be doing far more to
make Stanford match its image of a “top” university by working
to improve the quality of the writing of the paper's general re
porting and editorials than by printing a supercilious, supposed
ly angry young man's comment on the University.
