## 
### JUSTIN BECK 
The tennis squad returned to
form yesterday, after a pair of
losses to tennis powers USC and
UCLA last weekend. The Stan
ford nctters picked up their fifth
win against two losses by shut
ting out Claremont Men’s College.

9-0.
The Indians’ next match is Sat
urday, April 13. against Cal on
Cal’s home courts at 10 a.m.
CAL IS regarded as one of the
five top teams in the country,
ranking about equal with Stan
ford, and the match promises to
he one of the toughest of the
year for the Indians.
Cal also faced USC and UCLA
last weekend, and like the In
dians lost to both. However, the
Bears fared a little better in the
scoring, mainly due to the efforts
of their number one player, Jim
McManus,
McManus is unbeaten in inter
collegiate competition this year,
including wins over both USG’s
Raphael Osuna and UCLA’s Char
lie Passarell. Earlier this year,
McManus also beat Stanford’s
number one player, Yoshi Mine
gishi, in the Northern California
Championships.
ALTHOUGH CAL has no one
else of McManus's caliber, the
rest of the squad, headed by
Doug Sikes and Barry Baskin, is
also regarded as fairly good.
Coach Hoi) Renker said of Cal,
“It should bo a tough match with
us winning, if we win at all, by a
5- 1 score.”
Against Claremont there was
little doubt that the Tribe would
win. the Indians sweeping the
singles matches without losing
a sot.
In the first singles Minegishi
beat Bob (loss. 6-1, 6-2, although
Renker commented that neither
player was playing hard or ag
gressive tennis.
HON PRKISSMAN won the sec
ond singles against Joe Zorboni,
by a slightly smaller margin,
6- 6-4, after a slow start which!
led Renker to comment that
Preissman didn’t seem to know
that the match had already start
ed.
The coach added that Preiss
man was the best shot-maker on
the team, but also the slowest j
afoot. “It he could move, he could
be a very fine tennis player,”!
Renker said.
In third singles, John Issacs,
who Renker said is still relearn
ing his tennis after playing bas
ketball during the winter, won
handily, 6-0. 6-4.
IN THE other three singles,
Dick Wilson won 6-3. 6-1; John i
Burt won 6-1, 6-4; and Brad
Hodgeman won 6-4, 6-0.
The doubles were much the
same story. Issacs and Preissmann
went to three sets before winning, |
3-6, 6-3. 6-1; Wilson and Burt won |
7- 6-1; and seventh and eighth
men Byron Kibbey and John Me-1
Pherson won 6-2, 6-3.

YOSHI MINEGISHI, Stanford's
number one singles player, will
face Cal's unbeaten Jim McManus in Saturday's match against
the highly rated Bears.
The tennis squad returned to
form yesterday, after a pair of
losses to tennis powers USC and
UCLA last weekend. The Stan
ford nctters picked up their fifth
win against two losses by shut
ting out Claremont Men’s College.

9-0.
The Indians’ next match is Sat
urday, April 13. against Cal on
Cal’s home courts at 10 a.m.
CAL IS regarded as one of the
five top teams in the country,
ranking about equal with Stan
ford, and the match promises to
he one of the toughest of the
year for the Indians.
Cal also faced USC and UCLA
last weekend, and like the In
dians lost to both. However, the
Bears fared a little better in the
scoring, mainly due to the efforts
of their number one player, Jim
McManus,
McManus is unbeaten in inter
collegiate competition this year,
including wins over both USG’s
Raphael Osuna and UCLA’s Char
lie Passarell. Earlier this year,
McManus also beat Stanford’s
number one player, Yoshi Mine
gishi, in the Northern California
Championships.
ALTHOUGH CAL has no one
else of McManus's caliber, the
rest of the squad, headed by
Doug Sikes and Barry Baskin, is
also regarded as fairly good.
Coach Hoi) Renker said of Cal,
“It should bo a tough match with
us winning, if we win at all, by a
5- 1 score.”
Against Claremont there was
little doubt that the Tribe would
win. the Indians sweeping the
singles matches without losing
a sot.
In the first singles Minegishi
beat Bob (loss. 6-1, 6-2, although
Renker commented that neither
player was playing hard or ag
gressive tennis.
HON PRKISSMAN won the sec
ond singles against Joe Zorboni,
by a slightly smaller margin,
6- 6-4, after a slow start which!
led Renker to comment that
Preissman didn’t seem to know
that the match had already start
ed.
The coach added that Preiss
man was the best shot-maker on
the team, but also the slowest j
afoot. “It he could move, he could
be a very fine tennis player,”!
Renker said.
In third singles, John Issacs,
who Renker said is still relearn
ing his tennis after playing bas
ketball during the winter, won
handily, 6-0. 6-4.
IN THE other three singles,
Dick Wilson won 6-3. 6-1; John i
Burt won 6-1, 6-4; and Brad
