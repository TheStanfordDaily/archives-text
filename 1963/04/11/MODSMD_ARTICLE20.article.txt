# Tracksters in Top Condition To Host High Ranked Ducks
## 
### 
Judging from workouts this i
week. Stanford trackmen will be
in peak condition for Saturday’s
home meet with Oregon. The
meet figures to be the toughest
yet for the Indians, since the
Ducks are rated number two in
the nation.
ACCORDING to coach Payton
Jordan, field event men have
shown the most Improvement
during the week. Discus thrower
Dave Weill, who last week set a
national college record of 194-6,
has better form this week than
previously. Steve Arch has been
putting the shot around 55 feet
on practice tosses in readiness for
Oregon’s Dave Steen, who has
gone over 60 feet.
Distance runner Harry McCalla
ran 12 consecutive 220’s yester
day, all under 2k.5 excellent
times. His duel with Oregon’s

Keith Forman (4:03.7) in the mile
is expected to be the highlight
of the meet.
THE 440-KELAY team, which
Jordan says has not fulfilled its
potential yet, quite probably will
run its fastest lap of the season
Saturday. Jordan has decided on
the team of Len Bresehini, Bob
Mclntyre, Eric Frische, and Larry
Questad. and predicts a sub-41
second clocking, which would be
good enough to win.
Dan Moore has no sore spots
for the first time in five weeks,
and Jordan looks for him to
broad jump 24-plus feet.
The triple jumpers (Steve Cort
right, Sheridan Downey, and
Russ Peterson) have looked their
best yet this week. They'll be
battling for a crucial one-two fin
ish in one of the meet’s key
events.
