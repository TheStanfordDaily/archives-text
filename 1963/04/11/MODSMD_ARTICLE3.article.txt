WASHINGTON The U.S. nuclear-powered submarine Thresher
with 129 men aboard was missing in Atlantic waters a mile and a
half deep 220 miles east of Boston, the Navy said last night. A Navy
announcement at 8 p.m. ( EST) said the Thresher was “overdue and
presumed missing” and had not been heard from since submerging
for routine tests eleven hours earlier. Ships, aircraft and other
submarines were dispatched to the scene. Bad weather and heavy
seas were reported in the area.
Adm. George W. Anderson, chief of naval operations, told news
men that the Navy was "pessimistic" about the prospect of finding
the Thresher. But he said: “Wo are always hopeful that perhaps
this is a case of communications failure and that the submarine
might conceivably bo proceeding to port.” Anderson said that 8,400-
foot depth of the water where the Thresher was operating “pre
cludes any possibility of salvage if the submarine is indeed missing.”

a year to the day after his last big collision with the industry, the
President appeared to be heading into another power play with the
steelmakers, especially if larger firms follow the lead of the Wheel
ing company. He called in high government officials to discuss the
Wheeling firm’s announcement of a $4.50 to $lO a ton increase in
some steel prices.
