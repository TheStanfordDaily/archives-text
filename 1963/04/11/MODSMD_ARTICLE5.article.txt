# Fallout Shelter Controversy Viewed By Professors in Panel Discussion
## 
### FELL FENDER 
Dr. George Leppert narfated a
panel discussion of five members
of the Stanford community which
discussed the topic: “Civil De
fense at Stanford.”
Speaking for ten minutes each,
and answering questions after
wards were: Professor Richard
Wasserstrom of the Law School,
Dr. Christian Bay, of the Human
Problems Institute, Dr. Leonard
Herzenberg of the Medical
School, Mr. Nicholas Rosa, au
thor, and employed in the Stan
ford Research Institute, and Dr.
Theodore Roszak, Professor of
History.
DR. WASSERSTROM started
the discussion by arguing, sim
ply, that “If there were a nuclear
attack on the United States . . .
it would be better of there were
fallout shelters, than were there
no shelters,”
The moral case against the fall
out shelters was argued by Dr.
Bay. Kennedy, he maintained, has
supported an aggressive foreign
policy, and “In the context of an
aggressive foreign policy ... a
fallout shelter program becomes
lethal.” Fallout shelters can give
Americans a false sense of securi
ty through arms.
Dr. Bay also accused the United
States of being complacent in the
light of such programs as well as
thinking that we have the right
to take the “guiltless” with us
DR. HERZENBERG, rattled off
facts and statistics demonstrating
the effect of one ten-megaton nu
clear bomb. Citing the horrors of
Bamburg. Dr. Herzenberg as
serted that the shelters on the

Stanford Campus are far from
adequate. As to who would be al
lowed to enter, in case of an at
tack, Dr. Herzen berg said, “I
imagine student body cards will
be sufficient.” (Dr, Herzenberg
maintained a formally neutral po
sition on the shelters).
The fallout shelters and civil
defense was defended by Rosa
who, protesting the fact that shel
ters always had to be defended,
proceeded to defend the shelters.
Arguing on the theme that “fall
out shelters have never killed
anybody,” criticized some individ
uals at Stanford who protested
the shelters, and asserted that
the fallout shelters aren’t the
root of the trouble. Fallout shel
ters should be maintained, said
Rosa, “in case.”
Dr. Roszak was the last speak
er, answering his own question,
“Is the money (spent on shelters)
buying anything worthwhile?”
Dr. Roszak predicted that if fur
ther shelters are installed at Stan
ford, they may be considered to
be provocative of a nuclear war.
“CIVIL DEFENSE is part of a
military strategy, the strategy of
counterforce,” and, continued Ros
zak, “the American public knows
too little about it.” The drive for
shelters had already proceeded
when, Roszak stated, Kennedy
learned that adequate protection
for all citizens would cost hun
dreds of billions of dollars. This
cost being infeasible, our present
civil defense program is “a cruel
deception,” and a “fraud,” said
Roszak.
A question and answer period
followed the discussion, and liter
ature on shelters, pro and con,
was distributed at the door.

The panel discussion was spon
sored by the Peace Caucus.

the fallout shelters aren’t the
root of the trouble. Fallout shel
ters should be maintained, said
Rosa, “in case.”
Dr. Roszak was the last speak
er, answering his own question,
“Is the money (spent on shelters)
buying anything worthwhile?”
Dr. Roszak predicted that if fur
ther shelters are installed at Stan
ford, they may be considered to
be provocative of a nuclear war.
“CIVIL DEFENSE is part of a
military strategy, the strategy of
counterforce,” and, continued Ros
zak, “the American public knows
too little about it.” The drive for
shelters had already proceeded
when, Roszak stated, Kennedy
learned that adequate protection
for all citizens would cost hun
dreds of billions of dollars. This
cost being infeasible, our present
civil defense program is “a cruel
deception,” and a “fraud,” said
Roszak.
A question and answer period
followed the discussion, and liter
ature on shelters, pro and con,
was distributed at the door.

The panel discussion was spon
sored by the Peace Caucus.

RICHARD WASSERSTROM
Professor of Law
Dr. George Leppert narfated a
panel discussion of five members
of the Stanford community which
discussed the topic: “Civil De
fense at Stanford.”
Speaking for ten minutes each,
and answering questions after
wards were: Professor Richard
Wasserstrom of the Law School,
Dr. Christian Bay, of the Human
Problems Institute, Dr. Leonard
Herzenberg of the Medical
School, Mr. Nicholas Rosa, au
thor, and employed in the Stan
ford Research Institute, and Dr.
Theodore Roszak, Professor of
History.
DR. WASSERSTROM started
the discussion by arguing, sim
ply, that “If there were a nuclear
attack on the United States . . .
it would be better of there were
fallout shelters, than were there
no shelters,”
The moral case against the fall
out shelters was argued by Dr.
Bay. Kennedy, he maintained, has
supported an aggressive foreign
policy, and “In the context of an
aggressive foreign policy ... a
fallout shelter program becomes
lethal.” Fallout shelters can give
Americans a false sense of securi
ty through arms.
Dr. Bay also accused the United
States of being complacent in the
light of such programs as well as
thinking that we have the right
to take the “guiltless” with us
DR. HERZENBERG, rattled off
facts and statistics demonstrating
the effect of one ten-megaton nu
clear bomb. Citing the horrors of
Bamburg. Dr. Herzenberg as
serted that the shelters on the

Stanford Campus are far from
adequate. As to who would be al
lowed to enter, in case of an at
tack, Dr. Herzen berg said, “I
imagine student body cards will
be sufficient.” (Dr, Herzenberg
maintained a formally neutral po
sition on the shelters).
The fallout shelters and civil
defense was defended by Rosa
who, protesting the fact that shel
ters always had to be defended,
proceeded to defend the shelters.
Arguing on the theme that “fall
out shelters have never killed
anybody,” criticized some individ
uals at Stanford who protested
the shelters, and asserted that
the fallout shelters aren’t the
root of the trouble. Fallout shel
ters should be maintained, said
Rosa, “in case.”
Dr. Roszak was the last speak
