# Women's Dorms Close on Vacations

On-campus housing is provided for men stu
dents during the shorter vacations such as spring
break, but not for women students. According to
Dean Bonnie Fitzwater, Associate Dean of Women,
a multitude of reasons lie behind the policy of
keeping no women’s domritories open during vaca
tion, although there are foreign students and stu
dents who live far away and do not wish to go
home, or cannot afford to.
The first is that the dormitory staffs, as well as
the students, need vacations, and obviously every
woman’s dorm could not be kept in full or even
partial operation for only a few students. The
men’s dorms do stay open, however. “Men are
more likely to need campus residence throughout
vacation, because of job commitments or some
thing of this nature,” said Dean Fitzwater. “In
addition, to single out one women’s dormitory
for this purpose would present difficulties in that
the actual residents might object to other students
staying in their rooms for a week.”
THESE, HOWEVER, are not insurmountable
problems. There has been some discussion about
planning a guest house, Dean Fitzwater said,
which could be used between quarters for girls
wishing to stay on campus. Staffing (lie house
with R.A.’s would probably be possible because
several R.A.’s may also wish to stay on campus.
At present the University sometimes offers
help to women students in finding housing. Dur
ing the recent spring break, for example, one of
the hotels in Palo Alto offered reduced rates to
Stanford women; the cost of room for each girl
was $3 per night, of which the University paid
one-third. About twelve girls took advantage of
this opportunity. Foreign students are often help
ed out by Mothers’ Club organizations.
The main reason behind the University’s policy
of not offering more adequate housing during va
cation seems to be an apparent lack of demand
on the part of the students. In a telephone survey
of women’s dormitories conducted by The Daily,
however, it appeared that this works in a circle;
since everyone knows no dorms will he open, there
is no demand. As a girl in Guthrie said, “everyone

assumed there would bo no dorms open, and acted
accordingly. Those who couldn’t go home visited
someone else.”
OF ABOUT fifteen houses polled, it appeared
that, an average of two or three girls per house
wore really inconvenienced by the lack of vacation
time housing. Most of them eventually solved the
problem; as one girl commented, “things work
out. Some stay at the YWCA, others find week
long baby-sitting jobs.” The majority found people
to slay with, but as a girl in Lagunita said, “for
several of (he girls in our house it was a last
minute deal. Someone would say, T won’t be able
to do much with you since I have a lot of activi
ties myself, but come home with me anyhow if you
don’t have anywhere else, so you won’t have to
stay in a motel.' ” One of the girls in this rather
painful situation stayed with an acquaintance who
was working, and found herself sitting alone
every day in an apartment.
Jobs around the campus complicated the hous
ing problem for at least two girls, both in Row
Houses. One stayed with a friend, a graduate stu
dent, and had to walk a couple of miles to work;
another, also earless, who found a place in San
Francisco, was forced to make four or five bus
connections twice daily, traveling for several
hours, in order to keep her job.
Another point was brought up by a girl in
Union Residence, who said, “if the University is
afraid that there won’t be enough staff to provide
adequate chaperonage for girls who stay and so
do not want to be responsible for them, it seems
that they are being much less responsible by
forcing many girls who have to stick around the
campus to shift for themselves.”
WHETHER on-campus housing would really
be taken advantage of, if offered, is another ques
tion. Only a small minority of women would be in
volved, and last-minute arrangements are often
made. According to Dean Fitzwater. it has boon
tried; one of the women’s dorms actually was kept
open during spring break about seven or eight
years ago. Very few students signed up to begin
with, and by the'middle of vacation, the number
remaining had dwindled to zero. Everyone had de
cided to visit friends or to go home after all.
