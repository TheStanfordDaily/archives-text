5. Fortunately, there’s away out
for you.
Tell me —tell me.
Well, you won’t be getting all that
money in one year. You’ll be get
ting some of it each year, at a much
lower tax rate. What you should do is
put aside a certain amount of it.

insurance, the kind they call
Living Insurance at Equitable.
It gives your wife and kids solid
protection and it saves for you
automatically—builds a cash
fund you can use for retire
ment or any other purpose.
You Ecu guys have
all the answers.
