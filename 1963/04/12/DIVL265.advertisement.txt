Neither Catholic,
Protestant,
nor Jew
are proper terms to describe the church
of Christ. To believe and obey the Bible
is to be called out” of sin into Christ.
To obey something else is to become
something else other Than a Christian.
Truth not history, mci|Ority rule, or traditions of the fathers is the test of the
church of Christ. When the same truths are obeyed that caused early disciples to
become Christian, that person will become a child of God.
The church had its beginning on the day that Peter |a Jew| used the keys of
the kingdom of God by teaching other believing Jews that they must repent and
be baptized (immersed) tor remission of sins. Acts 2;38. This was the church of
Christ. Peter also taught that There is none other name under heaven given
among men whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12.
Obedience of Baptism (immersion-Jn.3:5; R0m.6:3-5) is one essential to be
come a Christian.
God has authorized no man to substitute sprinkling for baptism nor has God
authorized any person to baptize an unbeliever (infant or otherwise).
Matt. 15:19, 13.
