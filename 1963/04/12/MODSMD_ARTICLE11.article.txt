# Religious Affairs Committee Realizes Broadened Role
## 
### 
Stanford’s Committee on Re
ligious Affairs has found its role
on campus broadened since Uni
versity policy on sectarian groups
was liberalized at the beginning
of the quarter, according to Com
mittee Chairman Dick Paddock.
The University now permits dc
| nominational groups to meet on
I campus in private meetings with
-1 out approval of the Committee.
Such on-campus meetings were
formerly prohibited.
Open religious meetings on
campus must still be arranged
through the Committee, com
posed of representatives of 12 de
nominational and interdenomina
tional groups, (he Stanford Chris
tian Fellowship, and the Memori
al Church Committee, Paddock
explained.
BEFORE THE Trustees libera -
I lized religious policy, only the
Committee and the University
Chaplain could present religious
programs on campus, deciding by
vote which weie desirable or
! which of those proposed by mem-
I ber groups were acceptable to all.

There was some conjecture that
under the new University policy
the role of the Committee would
shrink, but it has not, Paddock
said.
The Committee still coordinates
open campus meetings. Religious
activity at Stanford has expand
ed, Paddock said. For example, a
I now religious group, the Evangel
ical Fellowship, has been formed
since the trustees’ action. Led by
Bruce Nickerson, the Fellowship
is inter-denominational, drawing
its members primarily from those
who belong to denominational
groups and are interested in join
ing the Fellowship as well. The
Fellowship concerns itself with
the charismatic revival the speak
ing in tongues is one aspect this
term embraces.
Paddock’s Committee on Re
ligious Affairs is busier than
ever, he said. The group has seen
no need to re-organize since the
policy change at Stanford. “In
stead, we will have to expand to
meet our enlarged responsibility
to Stanford,” Paddock said.
