# Women's Dorms and Vacations
## 
### 
During the break between Winter and Spring Quarters, no
women were allowed to live in University residences al
though the men’s dormitories on campus were open and
room was free.
According to a Daily telephone survey, two or three girls
in each of the fifteen houses polled were seriously inconveni
enced by this lack of on-campus housing, and an estimated
forty to fifty per cent of the women students were forced to
make other plans rather than stay on campus as they might
have hoped. At the same time, at least ten per cent of the men,
and probably more, because many did not bother to register
with the dormitory offices, stayed on campus during the va
cation. There is no way of knowing exactly how many men
stayed in their homes off-campus or in their fraternity houses,
though it is reasonable to assume that there was a fairly large
number.
I here are certainly a large number of difficulties involved
in keeping the dormitories open during the vacation period.
11 the University is to continue upholding the women’s social
regulations during the vacation—as, indeed, it must be as
sumed—the problems are multiple for the women’s dormi
tories. But, certainly, there is no reason to expect that such
regulations will be upheld to a greater degree in a hotel in
Palo Alto in which many of the women stayed because of a
special price worked out with the University.
A great number of the women who stayed around the
campus during vacation had jobs or academic work that need
ed to be done, or simply were without funds or plans to go
home or to some vacation spot. Surely the women have as
much right to continue their studies or jobs during vacation
as the men do.
The University should consider very seriously making some
provision in the future so that the women will be able to stay
on campus during the vacations.
