# STAFF OPINION
## The 						Young Republicans Controversy 
### RICHARD WEINIG 
Contributing Editor
A good deal of confusion has arisen about (he schism which
occurred at the California Young Republican College Federa
tion Convention in Fresno last weekend; and about the role of
the Stanford Area Young Republicans in this controversy. I
wish to clarify both issues.
Two candidates vied for next year’s CYRCF presidency:
Trent Devenney of Pepperdine College, an unabashed Goldwater
conservative; and Randy Siefkin of the University of California
at Santa Barbara. Siefkin also paid homage to the Senator from
Arizona, but until shortly before the convention had occupied
a prominent place in the Rockefeller wing of the party. He was
supported by Harold Phillips, the liberal, outgoing CYRCF
President from Redlands.
Prior to the Fresno convention such liberal sources as the
“Fresno Bee” estimated that Devenney held a decisive edge over
Siefkin. It was generally conceded that the liberals had little
hope of victory unless they could disqualify a good many con
servative votes in the Credentials committee, by fair means or
foul. (The committee, of course, determines which schools shall
be eligible to vote and the delegate strength of each.)
Here the battle lines were drawn.
Chairing the Credentials committee was John Roveda, a Phil
lips appointee, who was described by one delegate as “the ‘Di
vorce, Italian Style’ lawyer, without the beard.” Roveda then ap
pointed as “sergeants-at-arms” seven or eight of Phillips’ “at
taches” who looked suspiciously like the second-string Redlands
football team and who, until this time, had done little except
walk about, flex their bountiful muscles, and (to recall the words
of a beloved, former “Daily” reporter) look “tougher than a
stucco bathtub.”
Although the meeting was supposedly open to all who
wished to attend, it was held in a small, overheated room which
could accommodate less than two persons from each school.
The football players and two policemen who seemed to have
been procured from the Fresno police department under some
form of “rent-a-cop” plan guarded the doors and prevented any
persons not bearing white admission passes from Phillips from
entering the room. (Reminiscent of San Francisco and the
HUAC, liberals?) The reason for such security measures seems
rather unclear, since space could have easily been provided for
all who wished to attend by merely opening a folding door at
the back of the room.
At the beginning of the meeting, Roveda agreed to conduct
all proceedings in accord with the provisions of “Roberts’ Rules
of Order” and the CYRCF constitution which allow any unit
whose very existence is not questioned to cast one vote in the
committee on any matter which does not affect it directly.
The committee proceeded under these rules for some two
and one-half hours. During this time, all liberal attempts to dis
qualify the voting rights of conservative schools were rejected
by narrow margins.
Then the question of Occidental College arose. Two delega
tions claimed to represent the school—one conservative and one
liberal. As the conservative delegation’s legitimacy had been at
tested to by the Los Angeles county treasurer, the committee
voted to seat it, after extended debate. Apparently seeing that
the liberals were losing, rather than gaining strength, Phillips
jumped up and whispered mysterious words in the ear of John
Roveda. Roveda, in turn, announced that: (a) the rules under
which the committee had been operating for the past two and
one-half hours were incorrect; (b) thereafter, a school which had
a challenge upon it of any sort would not be allowed to vote on
any question brought before the committee; (c) he was at that
time presenting challenges against eight conservative schools
which would be considered as proof of guilt unless proved un
true (no time was alloted to either gather or present evidence
to the contrary): and (d) he would allow no appeal from the
ruling of the chair, since the constitutionality of his ruling was
so clear-cut that no question of legality could be raised.
Then, to maintain order, the football team and police pre
vented conservative delegates from communicating with one
another within the committee room; leaving the room; or re
ceiving messages from outside. In a word, Phillips and followers
erected Fresno’s answer to the Berlin Wall.
After hearing of these proceedings, state Young Republi
can President, Robert Gaston, attempted to enter the committee
room to see what was happening. (Insofar as the College Feder
ation is legally but a standing committee of the state Young
Republican organization, he was constitutionally empowered to
do so.) But Gaston was bodily thrown from the room by the foot
ball team and the police.
Shortly thereafter, the committee recessed for dinner.
Between sessions of the committee, the Phillips-dominated
CYRCF executive board met; approved the rule change which
Roveda had improvised on the floor of the Credential commit
tee; and announced that no state Young Republican officers
would be allowed to sit in the committee.
(In addition to this, latter violation of the CYR constitution,
Phillips and Roveda contravened Article 8, Sec. 4 of that docu
ment which states that no changes in rules are valid unless ap
proved by the state executive board of the Young Republicans
of California.)
Therefore, seeing that Phillips had no intention of conduct
ing a fair, constitutional credentials committee, Gaston and
Gromala decided to hold a CYR-supervised credentials commit
tee, which would be conducted in accord with the constitution
of the organization and open to all who wished to attend. Such
a meeting was held and attended by a majority of the schools
assembled in Fresno. (Once again, Gaston and Gromala were
functioning in their legal capacities as officers of the parent
organization of which the CYRCF is but a standing committee.)
Realizing that they had no hope of electing their condidate
in a free and open convention, Phillips and his followers with
drew from the legally authorized convention and held their own
“rump” convention in another room of the motel. Of course,
they took with them their private army of second-string foot
ball players and “rent-a-cop” policemen, causing many to won
der of whom or what they were afraid. The legal CYRCF con
vention had no guards and permitted free access to and from
all meetings.
The CYRCF convention was attended by approximately 220
of the 413 delegates in Fresno. On the other hand, the Phillips
“rump” convention was able to claim a quorum of the 72 schools
represented in Fresno only by seating several “paper clubs”
which has been created for this purpose.
The CYRCF convention elected Trent Devenney as Presi
dent; the Phillips “rump” convention elected Randy Siefkin.
The entire controversy will be resolved when the state
Young Republican Executive Board convenes in Santa Rosa at
the end of this month, since no College Federation activities
may be given legal status without approval of this body. But
it is all but a foregone conclusion that the actions of the break
away Phillips group will be rejected, insofar as they almost
totally lack a legal foundation.
The entire Stanford delegation participated in the CYRCF
convention, although five members had at first mistaken the
Phillips group for the legal body—through misinformation or
ignorance of the CYR constitution and by-laws—and participated
in it.
Stanford students elected to office in the CYRCF conven
tion wore: Joe Dennin, Vice-President for Central California;
John Bonine. Area Three Director (the Peninsula); and James
Sensenbrenner, Parliamentarian and Chaplain.

another within the committee room; leaving the room; or re
ceiving messages from outside. In a word, Phillips and followers
erected Fresno’s answer to the Berlin Wall.
After hearing of these proceedings, state Young Republi
can President, Robert Gaston, attempted to enter the committee
room to see what was happening. (Insofar as the College Feder
ation is legally but a standing committee of the state Young
Republican organization, he was constitutionally empowered to
do so.) But Gaston was bodily thrown from the room by the foot
ball team and the police.
Shortly thereafter, the committee recessed for dinner.
Between sessions of the committee, the Phillips-dominated
CYRCF executive board met; approved the rule change which
Roveda had improvised on the floor of the Credential commit
tee; and announced that no state Young Republican officers
would be allowed to sit in the committee.
(In addition to this, latter violation of the CYR constitution,
Phillips and Roveda contravened Article 8, Sec. 4 of that docu
ment which states that no changes in rules are valid unless ap
proved by the state executive board of the Young Republicans
of California.)
Therefore, seeing that Phillips had no intention of conduct
ing a fair, constitutional credentials committee, Gaston and
Gromala decided to hold a CYR-supervised credentials commit
tee, which would be conducted in accord with the constitution
of the organization and open to all who wished to attend. Such
a meeting was held and attended by a majority of the schools
assembled in Fresno. (Once again, Gaston and Gromala were
functioning in their legal capacities as officers of the parent
organization of which the CYRCF is but a standing committee.)
Realizing that they had no hope of electing their condidate
in a free and open convention, Phillips and his followers with
drew from the legally authorized convention and held their own
“rump” convention in another room of the motel. Of course,
they took with them their private army of second-string foot
ball players and “rent-a-cop” policemen, causing many to won
der of whom or what they were afraid. The legal CYRCF con
vention had no guards and permitted free access to and from
all meetings.
The CYRCF convention was attended by approximately 220
of the 413 delegates in Fresno. On the other hand, the Phillips
“rump” convention was able to claim a quorum of the 72 schools
represented in Fresno only by seating several “paper clubs”
which has been created for this purpose.
The CYRCF convention elected Trent Devenney as Presi
dent; the Phillips “rump” convention elected Randy Siefkin.
The entire controversy will be resolved when the state
Young Republican Executive Board convenes in Santa Rosa at
the end of this month, since no College Federation activities
may be given legal status without approval of this body. But
it is all but a foregone conclusion that the actions of the break
away Phillips group will be rejected, insofar as they almost
totally lack a legal foundation.
The entire Stanford delegation participated in the CYRCF
convention, although five members had at first mistaken the
Phillips group for the legal body—through misinformation or
ignorance of the CYR constitution and by-laws—and participated
in it.
Stanford students elected to office in the CYRCF conven
tion wore: Joe Dennin, Vice-President for Central California;
John Bonine. Area Three Director (the Peninsula); and James
Sensenbrenner, Parliamentarian and Chaplain.

A good deal of confusion has arisen about (he schism which
occurred at the California Young Republican College Federa
tion Convention in Fresno last weekend; and about the role of
the Stanford Area Young Republicans in this controversy. I
wish to clarify both issues.
Two candidates vied for next year’s CYRCF presidency:
Trent Devenney of Pepperdine College, an unabashed Goldwater
conservative; and Randy Siefkin of the University of California
at Santa Barbara. Siefkin also paid homage to the Senator from
Arizona, but until shortly before the convention had occupied
a prominent place in the Rockefeller wing of the party. He was
supported by Harold Phillips, the liberal, outgoing CYRCF
President from Redlands.
Prior to the Fresno convention such liberal sources as the
“Fresno Bee” estimated that Devenney held a decisive edge over
Siefkin. It was generally conceded that the liberals had little
hope of victory unless they could disqualify a good many con
servative votes in the Credentials committee, by fair means or
foul. (The committee, of course, determines which schools shall
be eligible to vote and the delegate strength of each.)
Here the battle lines were drawn.
Chairing the Credentials committee was John Roveda, a Phil
lips appointee, who was described by one delegate as “the ‘Di
vorce, Italian Style’ lawyer, without the beard.” Roveda then ap
pointed as “sergeants-at-arms” seven or eight of Phillips’ “at
taches” who looked suspiciously like the second-string Redlands
football team and who, until this time, had done little except
walk about, flex their bountiful muscles, and (to recall the words
of a beloved, former “Daily” reporter) look “tougher than a
stucco bathtub.”
Although the meeting was supposedly open to all who
wished to attend, it was held in a small, overheated room which
could accommodate less than two persons from each school.
The football players and two policemen who seemed to have
been procured from the Fresno police department under some
form of “rent-a-cop” plan guarded the doors and prevented any
persons not bearing white admission passes from Phillips from
entering the room. (Reminiscent of San Francisco and the
HUAC, liberals?) The reason for such security measures seems
rather unclear, since space could have easily been provided for
all who wished to attend by merely opening a folding door at
the back of the room.
At the beginning of the meeting, Roveda agreed to conduct
all proceedings in accord with the provisions of “Roberts’ Rules
of Order” and the CYRCF constitution which allow any unit
whose very existence is not questioned to cast one vote in the
committee on any matter which does not affect it directly.
The committee proceeded under these rules for some two
and one-half hours. During this time, all liberal attempts to dis
qualify the voting rights of conservative schools were rejected
by narrow margins.
Then the question of Occidental College arose. Two delega
tions claimed to represent the school—one conservative and one
liberal. As the conservative delegation’s legitimacy had been at
tested to by the Los Angeles county treasurer, the committee
voted to seat it, after extended debate. Apparently seeing that
the liberals were losing, rather than gaining strength, Phillips
jumped up and whispered mysterious words in the ear of John
Roveda. Roveda, in turn, announced that: (a) the rules under
which the committee had been operating for the past two and
one-half hours were incorrect; (b) thereafter, a school which had
a challenge upon it of any sort would not be allowed to vote on
any question brought before the committee; (c) he was at that
time presenting challenges against eight conservative schools
which would be considered as proof of guilt unless proved un
true (no time was alloted to either gather or present evidence
to the contrary): and (d) he would allow no appeal from the
ruling of the chair, since the constitutionality of his ruling was
so clear-cut that no question of legality could be raised.
Then, to maintain order, the football team and police pre
vented conservative delegates from communicating with one
another within the committee room; leaving the room; or re
ceiving messages from outside. In a word, Phillips and followers

President from Redlands.
Prior to the Fresno convention such liberal sources as the
“Fresno Bee” estimated that Devenney held a decisive edge over
Siefkin. It was generally conceded that the liberals had little
hope of victory unless they could disqualify a good many con
servative votes in the Credentials committee, by fair means or
foul. (The committee, of course, determines which schools shall
be eligible to vote and the delegate strength of each.)
Here the battle lines were drawn.
Chairing the Credentials committee was John Roveda, a Phil
lips appointee, who was described by one delegate as “the ‘Di
vorce, Italian Style’ lawyer, without the beard.” Roveda then ap
pointed as “sergeants-at-arms” seven or eight of Phillips’ “at
taches” who looked suspiciously like the second-string Redlands
football team and who, until this time, had done little except
walk about, flex their bountiful muscles, and (to recall the words
of a beloved, former “Daily” reporter) look “tougher than a
stucco bathtub.”
Although the meeting was supposedly open to all who
wished to attend, it was held in a small, overheated room which
could accommodate less than two persons from each school.
The football players and two policemen who seemed to have
been procured from the Fresno police department under some
form of “rent-a-cop” plan guarded the doors and prevented any
persons not bearing white admission passes from Phillips from
entering the room. (Reminiscent of San Francisco and the
HUAC, liberals?) The reason for such security measures seems
rather unclear, since space could have easily been provided for
all who wished to attend by merely opening a folding door at
the back of the room.
At the beginning of the meeting, Roveda agreed to conduct
all proceedings in accord with the provisions of “Roberts’ Rules
of Order” and the CYRCF constitution which allow any unit
whose very existence is not questioned to cast one vote in the
committee on any matter which does not affect it directly.
The committee proceeded under these rules for some two
and one-half hours. During this time, all liberal attempts to dis
qualify the voting rights of conservative schools were rejected
by narrow margins.
Then the question of Occidental College arose. Two delega
tions claimed to represent the school—one conservative and one
liberal. As the conservative delegation’s legitimacy had been at
tested to by the Los Angeles county treasurer, the committee
voted to seat it, after extended debate. Apparently seeing that
the liberals were losing, rather than gaining strength, Phillips
jumped up and whispered mysterious words in the ear of John
Roveda. Roveda, in turn, announced that: (a) the rules under
which the committee had been operating for the past two and
one-half hours were incorrect; (b) thereafter, a school which had
a challenge upon it of any sort would not be allowed to vote on
any question brought before the committee; (c) he was at that
time presenting challenges against eight conservative schools
which would be considered as proof of guilt unless proved un
true (no time was alloted to either gather or present evidence
to the contrary): and (d) he would allow no appeal from the
ruling of the chair, since the constitutionality of his ruling was
so clear-cut that no question of legality could be raised.
Then, to maintain order, the football team and police pre
vented conservative delegates from communicating with one
another within the committee room; leaving the room; or re
ceiving messages from outside. In a word, Phillips and followers
erected Fresno’s answer to the Berlin Wall.
After hearing of these proceedings, state Young Republi
can President, Robert Gaston, attempted to enter the committee
room to see what was happening. (Insofar as the College Feder
ation is legally but a standing committee of the state Young
Republican organization, he was constitutionally empowered to
do so.) But Gaston was bodily thrown from the room by the foot
ball team and the police.
Shortly thereafter, the committee recessed for dinner.
Between sessions of the committee, the Phillips-dominated
CYRCF executive board met; approved the rule change which
Roveda had improvised on the floor of the Credential commit
tee; and announced that no state Young Republican officers
would be allowed to sit in the committee.
(In addition to this, latter violation of the CYR constitution,
Phillips and Roveda contravened Article 8, Sec. 4 of that docu
ment which states that no changes in rules are valid unless ap
proved by the state executive board of the Young Republicans
of California.)
Therefore, seeing that Phillips had no intention of conduct
ing a fair, constitutional credentials committee, Gaston and
Gromala decided to hold a CYR-supervised credentials commit
tee, which would be conducted in accord with the constitution
of the organization and open to all who wished to attend. Such
a meeting was held and attended by a majority of the schools
assembled in Fresno. (Once again, Gaston and Gromala were
functioning in their legal capacities as officers of the parent
organization of which the CYRCF is but a standing committee.)
Realizing that they had no hope of electing their condidate
in a free and open convention, Phillips and his followers with
drew from the legally authorized convention and held their own
“rump” convention in another room of the motel. Of course,
they took with them their private army of second-string foot
ball players and “rent-a-cop” policemen, causing many to won
der of whom or what they were afraid. The legal CYRCF con
vention had no guards and permitted free access to and from
all meetings.
The CYRCF convention was attended by approximately 220
of the 413 delegates in Fresno. On the other hand, the Phillips
“rump” convention was able to claim a quorum of the 72 schools
represented in Fresno only by seating several “paper clubs”
which has been created for this purpose.
The CYRCF convention elected Trent Devenney as Presi
dent; the Phillips “rump” convention elected Randy Siefkin.
The entire controversy will be resolved when the state
Young Republican Executive Board convenes in Santa Rosa at
the end of this month, since no College Federation activities
may be given legal status without approval of this body. But
it is all but a foregone conclusion that the actions of the break
away Phillips group will be rejected, insofar as they almost
totally lack a legal foundation.
The entire Stanford delegation participated in the CYRCF
convention, although five members had at first mistaken the
Phillips group for the legal body—through misinformation or
ignorance of the CYR constitution and by-laws—and participated
in it.
Stanford students elected to office in the CYRCF conven
tion wore: Joe Dennin, Vice-President for Central California;
John Bonine. Area Three Director (the Peninsula); and James
Sensenbrenner, Parliamentarian and Chaplain.

A good deal of confusion has arisen about (he schism which
occurred at the California Young Republican College Federa
tion Convention in Fresno last weekend; and about the role of
the Stanford Area Young Republicans in this controversy. I
wish to clarify both issues.
Two candidates vied for next year’s CYRCF presidency:
Trent Devenney of Pepperdine College, an unabashed Goldwater
conservative; and Randy Siefkin of the University of California
at Santa Barbara. Siefkin also paid homage to the Senator from
Arizona, but until shortly before the convention had occupied
a prominent place in the Rockefeller wing of the party. He was
supported by Harold Phillips, the liberal, outgoing CYRCF
President from Redlands.

A good deal of confusion has arisen about (he schism which
occurred at the California Young Republican College Federa
tion Convention in Fresno last weekend; and about the role of
the Stanford Area Young Republicans in this controversy. I
wish to clarify both issues.
Two candidates vied for next year’s CYRCF presidency:
Trent Devenney of Pepperdine College, an unabashed Goldwater
conservative; and Randy Siefkin of the University of California
at Santa Barbara. Siefkin also paid homage to the Senator from
Arizona, but until shortly before the convention had occupied
a prominent place in the Rockefeller wing of the party. He was
supported by Harold Phillips, the liberal, outgoing CYRCF
President from Redlands.
Prior to the Fresno convention such liberal sources as the
“Fresno Bee” estimated that Devenney held a decisive edge over
Siefkin. It was generally conceded that the liberals had little
hope of victory unless they could disqualify a good many con
servative votes in the Credentials committee, by fair means or
foul. (The committee, of course, determines which schools shall
be eligible to vote and the delegate strength of each.)
Here the battle lines were drawn.
Chairing the Credentials committee was John Roveda, a Phil
lips appointee, who was described by one delegate as “the ‘Di
vorce, Italian Style’ lawyer, without the beard.” Roveda then ap
pointed as “sergeants-at-arms” seven or eight of Phillips’ “at
taches” who looked suspiciously like the second-string Redlands
football team and who, until this time, had done little except
walk about, flex their bountiful muscles, and (to recall the words
of a beloved, former “Daily” reporter) look “tougher than a
stucco bathtub.”
Although the meeting was supposedly open to all who
wished to attend, it was held in a small, overheated room which
could accommodate less than two persons from each school.
The football players and two policemen who seemed to have
been procured from the Fresno police department under some
form of “rent-a-cop” plan guarded the doors and prevented any
persons not bearing white admission passes from Phillips from
entering the room. (Reminiscent of San Francisco and the
HUAC, liberals?) The reason for such security measures seems
rather unclear, since space could have easily been provided for
all who wished to attend by merely opening a folding door at
the back of the room.
At the beginning of the meeting, Roveda agreed to conduct
all proceedings in accord with the provisions of “Roberts’ Rules
of Order” and the CYRCF constitution which allow any unit
whose very existence is not questioned to cast one vote in the
committee on any matter which does not affect it directly.
The committee proceeded under these rules for some two
and one-half hours. During this time, all liberal attempts to dis
qualify the voting rights of conservative schools were rejected
by narrow margins.
Then the question of Occidental College arose. Two delega
tions claimed to represent the school—one conservative and one
liberal. As the conservative delegation’s legitimacy had been at
tested to by the Los Angeles county treasurer, the committee
voted to seat it, after extended debate. Apparently seeing that
the liberals were losing, rather than gaining strength, Phillips
jumped up and whispered mysterious words in the ear of John
Roveda. Roveda, in turn, announced that: (a) the rules under
which the committee had been operating for the past two and
one-half hours were incorrect; (b) thereafter, a school which had
a challenge upon it of any sort would not be allowed to vote on
any question brought before the committee; (c) he was at that
time presenting challenges against eight conservative schools
which would be considered as proof of guilt unless proved un
true (no time was alloted to either gather or present evidence
to the contrary): and (d) he would allow no appeal from the
ruling of the chair, since the constitutionality of his ruling was
so clear-cut that no question of legality could be raised.
Then, to maintain order, the football team and police pre
vented conservative delegates from communicating with one
another within the committee room; leaving the room; or re
ceiving messages from outside. In a word, Phillips and followers
erected Fresno’s answer to the Berlin Wall.
After hearing of these proceedings, state Young Republi
can President, Robert Gaston, attempted to enter the committee
room to see what was happening. (Insofar as the College Feder
ation is legally but a standing committee of the state Young
Republican organization, he was constitutionally empowered to
do so.) But Gaston was bodily thrown from the room by the foot
ball team and the police.
Shortly thereafter, the committee recessed for dinner.
Between sessions of the committee, the Phillips-dominated
CYRCF executive board met; approved the rule change which
Roveda had improvised on the floor of the Credential commit
tee; and announced that no state Young Republican officers
would be allowed to sit in the committee.
(In addition to this, latter violation of the CYR constitution,
Phillips and Roveda contravened Article 8, Sec. 4 of that docu
ment which states that no changes in rules are valid unless ap
proved by the state executive board of the Young Republicans
of California.)
Therefore, seeing that Phillips had no intention of conduct

Gromala decided to hold a CYR-supervised credentials commit
tee, which would be conducted in accord with the constitution
