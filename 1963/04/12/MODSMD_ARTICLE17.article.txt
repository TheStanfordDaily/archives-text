# Republicans Fear Failure Of Aid to Education Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON tCPSt House
Republican leaders have forecast
stormy weather for a general col
lege aid bill this year. They hoist
ed their warnings last week after
the House Rules Committee ap
proved a bill to aid medical and
dental schools.

Rep, Albert Quie, a senior mem
ber of the House Special Educa
tion Subcommittee, said he has
been informed that Democratic
leaders made a deal to get the bill
out of the Rules Committee. The
Minnesota Republican said he un
derstood that the Democrats
agreed that the medical bill was
the only one to be allowed out of
the Rules Committee this year.
“If this is true it,’s the worst
piece of political cynicism I ever
saw',’’ he said. House Minority
Leader Charles Halleck, (R-Ind.)
said it would be tragic if Con
gress isn’t given a chance to vote
on a general college aid bill this
year.
A White House meeting attend
ed by Rep. Edith Green (D-Ore.)
head of (he Special Education
Subcommittee and chief sponsor
of a broad college aid program,
aroused the GOP fears. Shortly
after meeting with President
Kennedy and Democratic leaders
from the House and Senate, Mrs.
Green dropped plans for a sepa
rate $2.7 billion college aid pro
gram and instead announced that
the college aid program would
bo included in the Administra

tion’s omnibus education hill.
The college aid program was
favored by both Republicans and
Democrats as well as national
representatives of educational or -
ganizations. Chances for the col
lege aid program’s passage seem
slimmer now that it will be in
cluded with Kennedy’s $5.3 bil
lion, 24-point aid to education pro
gram.
Just how the college aid pro
gram would be handled was to be
decided last week at a Democratic
caucus of the House Education
and Labor- Committee. However,
the caucus was postponed until
this week.
Passed by the Rules Committee
and sent to the House Floor for
action after Easter was a $237
million bill providing funds for
construction of medical and den
tal schools and loans for medical
and dental students. Mrs. Green
is still not satisfied with the bill
which was sponsored by the
House Commerce Committee.
However, she supported the mea
sure to help the Administration
bring it out of the Rules Commit
tee because she says she is a
“team player.”
Mrs. Green said the separate
medical bill would have to be
amended on the House Floor an
action apparently ironed out by
Democratic leaders at the White
House meeting. Her major objec
tion to the legislation was the
loan provision for medical and
dental school students. Mrs.
Green said it would create a new
loan system which would operate
at odds with the present loan pro
gram of the National Defense
Education Act.
For instance, she said, doctors
would be forgiven up to half their
loans for military services while
medical school students attending
school with a NDEA loan
wouldn’t be given the same privi
lege. Also needing amendment ac
cording to Mrs. Green were com
parable grants for school con
struction in the Education Sub
committee’s college aid program.
There are still reports that
Mrs. Green's subcommittee in
tends to weed out provisions of
the Administration education
package which have killed omni
bus education aid plans before.
The knife would be applied to
Kennedy’s proposal to aid public
but not private elementary
and secondary schools.
One Republican who saw things
in a brighter light last week was
Rep. Charles Goodell who serves
on Mrs. Green’s Education Sub
committee. He said it is still pos
sible to save a general college aid
bill, “but the knife has gone in
(the college aid program) and
someone will have to draw it out
fast.”

slimmer now that it will be in
cluded with Kennedy’s $5.3 bil

Just how the college aid pro

decided last week at a Democratic
caucus of the House Education

the caucus was postponed until
this week.
Passed by the Rules Committee
and sent to the House Floor for
action after Easter was a $237
million bill providing funds for
construction of medical and den
tal schools and loans for medical
and dental students. Mrs. Green
is still not satisfied with the bill
which was sponsored by the
House Commerce Committee.
However, she supported the mea
sure to help the Administration
bring it out of the Rules Commit
tee because she says she is a
“team player.”
Mrs. Green said the separate
medical bill would have to be
amended on the House Floor an
action apparently ironed out by
Democratic leaders at the White
House meeting. Her major objec
tion to the legislation was the
loan provision for medical and
dental school students. Mrs.
Green said it would create a new
loan system which would operate
at odds with the present loan pro
gram of the National Defense
Education Act.
For instance, she said, doctors
would be forgiven up to half their
loans for military services while
medical school students attending
school with a NDEA loan
wouldn’t be given the same privi
lege. Also needing amendment ac
cording to Mrs. Green were com
parable grants for school con
struction in the Education Sub
committee’s college aid program.
There are still reports that
Mrs. Green's subcommittee in
tends to weed out provisions of
the Administration education
package which have killed omni
bus education aid plans before.
The knife would be applied to
Kennedy’s proposal to aid public
but not private elementary
and secondary schools.
One Republican who saw things
in a brighter light last week was
Rep. Charles Goodell who serves
on Mrs. Green’s Education Sub
committee. He said it is still pos
sible to save a general college aid
bill, “but the knife has gone in
(the college aid program) and
someone will have to draw it out

WASHINGTON tCPSt House
Republican leaders have forecast
stormy weather for a general col
lege aid bill this year. They hoist
ed their warnings last week after
the House Rules Committee ap
proved a bill to aid medical and
dental schools.

Rep, Albert Quie, a senior mem
ber of the House Special Educa
tion Subcommittee, said he has
been informed that Democratic
leaders made a deal to get the bill
out of the Rules Committee. The
Minnesota Republican said he un
derstood that the Democrats
agreed that the medical bill was
the only one to be allowed out of
the Rules Committee this year.
“If this is true it,’s the worst
piece of political cynicism I ever
saw',’’ he said. House Minority
Leader Charles Halleck, (R-Ind.)
said it would be tragic if Con
gress isn’t given a chance to vote
on a general college aid bill this
year.
A White House meeting attend
ed by Rep. Edith Green (D-Ore.)
head of (he Special Education
Subcommittee and chief sponsor
of a broad college aid program,
aroused the GOP fears. Shortly
after meeting with President
Kennedy and Democratic leaders
from the House and Senate, Mrs.
Green dropped plans for a sepa
rate $2.7 billion college aid pro
gram and instead announced that
the college aid program would
bo included in the Administra

tion’s omnibus education hill.
The college aid program was
favored by both Republicans and
Democrats as well as national
representatives of educational or -
ganizations. Chances for the col
