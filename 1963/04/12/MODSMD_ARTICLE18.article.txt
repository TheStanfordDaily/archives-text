Editors, The Daily:
I am a regular reader of The
Stanford Daily and I have often
wondered at the tone of some of
the articles of your paper. The
concert review in Wednesday’s
issue decided me to protest in the
name of fairness and good taste.
I happened to be one of the “fe
males” at the Saturday concert
of Mr. Entremont, and even
though I do not agree with Mr.
Walter Moore’s opinion about the
artistic achievement of this
French pianist, I wish to make it
quite clear that what I object to
is not the rather forceful criticism
of Mr. Moore; it is his disrespect
fid, off-handish, self-important
and crude woxding of his article.
Should Philippe Entremont be no
more than an obscure little pi
anist just out of the conserva
tory he would deserve more re
spect from anyone than what he
gets from Mr. Moore. Let mo re
mind you, Mr. Moore: one does
not call a rather well-known mu
sical personality a “fellow,” (or
anyone else for this matter) how
ever disagreeable you find his
musical performance. It is equal
ly unfair, and most irrelevant, to
refer to his good looks when one
writes about a pianist. Mr.
Moore’s remarks about the audi
ence are also in extremely bad
taste, and I am rather inclined
to believe that not only “females”
but educated “males” would, too,
share my opinion about this.
Who is Mr. Moore so angry at?
The audience who applauded?
Mr. Entremont who is liked and
successful? Or at himself whose
musicianship is less successful,
or maybe even unrecognized?
Mrs. Veronica Burger
