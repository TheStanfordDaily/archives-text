## 'The Policy of Gimmicks' 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
I here have been recently a few cracks in the wall of silence
which separates the French and the American governments. The
wall is silly, for, however much the two governments may dis- j
agree about this and that, there is no sense whatever in their ,
being unable to communicate with one another. Yet such has been ’
the state of Franco-American re-4— —

lations that we have to treat as
big news the fact that the U.S.
secretary of state, who is in Paris
on the official business of the
SEATO meeting, had a long talk
with the French foreign minister
and has actually been received by
the president of the French re
public. What should be normal
and routine among allies has
come to look like a mysterious
event of which the full signifi
cance has still to be deciphered.
It is not difficult to think of
reasons why General de Gaulle
may have deeided that ho has
carried too far his antagonism to
the “Anglo-Saxons” and the At
lantic community. There is, for
one thing, mounting evidence
that his continental allies, the
Germans, the Italians, the Bel
gians and the Dutch, have not
much appetite for a “Europe”
governed from Paris by General
de Gaulle. There is increasing
reason to believe that the Euro
peans do not like the French nu
clear force any better than wo do.
For they will not have any more
to do with it than we will have.
My own view Is that the ap
proach of the administration to
the European nuclear problem
has been overanxious and is in
deed misconceived. It is over
anxious in the sense that wo have
made it look as if we wanted ur
gently to sell to Europe the
scheme for multi-national and
multi-lateral nuclear forces. It
was overanxious to send an emi
nent diplomat like Livingston
Merchant on a tour of European
capitals. Our own nuclear power
is presumably adequate to pro
tect the Western Alliance against
nuclear aggression. If it were not
adequate, it would not become
adequate by adding a little more
nuclear from Great Britain and
France.
Insofar as European govern
ments really believe that they
cannot rely on the United States,
or that they must own some nu
clear weapons in order to qualify
as great powers, there are two
main courses open to us. The first
one, which we have chosen, is to
propose schemes which will have
the appearance, but not the re
ality, of independent nuclear
forces. Perhaps one or both of
the schemes can be sold to Euro
pean governments. But I cannot

believe that the real problem of
European-American relations is
going to be solved by repairing
i the facade without remodeling
the house.
j The other course, which seems
; to me to be based on a much bet
ter conception, would bo to stand
i firmly on our basic proposition
that, within the Western alliance, 1
the command of the use of nu-
I clear weapons is indivisible. What
1 can and should be shared among
allies is the formation of high
nuclear policy, the determination
! of nuclear strategy, the definition
' of nuclear targets, the research
| and development for the nuclear
j armory, the engineering and ac-
I tual production of nuclear com
| ponents.
! The partnership in the manage
ment of the unavoidable nuclear
monopoly would have to begin J
modestly and grow gradually 1
more complete. 1 am convinced
I that the new generation of lead-1
j ers of Europe would see the good
sense of a nuclear partnership
and that they will have no inter
est in so-called independent na
tional forces or in the expensive
and pretentious gimmicks that
are being offered as a substitute.

For they will not have any more
to do with it than we will have.
My own view Is that the ap
proach of the administration to
the European nuclear problem
has been overanxious and is in
deed misconceived. It is over
anxious in the sense that wo have
made it look as if we wanted ur
gently to sell to Europe the
scheme for multi-national and
multi-lateral nuclear forces. It
was overanxious to send an emi
nent diplomat like Livingston
Merchant on a tour of European
capitals. Our own nuclear power
is presumably adequate to pro
tect the Western Alliance against
nuclear aggression. If it were not
adequate, it would not become
adequate by adding a little more
nuclear from Great Britain and
France.
Insofar as European govern
ments really believe that they
cannot rely on the United States,
or that they must own some nu
clear weapons in order to qualify
as great powers, there are two
main courses open to us. The first
one, which we have chosen, is to
propose schemes which will have
the appearance, but not the re
ality, of independent nuclear
forces. Perhaps one or both of
the schemes can be sold to Euro
pean governments. But I cannot

believe that the real problem of
European-American relations is
going to be solved by repairing
i the facade without remodeling
the house.
j The other course, which seems
; to me to be based on a much bet
ter conception, would bo to stand
i firmly on our basic proposition
that, within the Western alliance, 1
the command of the use of nu-
I clear weapons is indivisible. What
1 can and should be shared among
allies is the formation of high
nuclear policy, the determination

j armory, the engineering and ac-
I tual production of nuclear com

I here have been recently a few cracks in the wall of silence
which separates the French and the American governments. The
wall is silly, for, however much the two governments may dis- j
agree about this and that, there is no sense whatever in their ,
being unable to communicate with one another. Yet such has been ’
the state of Franco-American re-4— —

lations that we have to treat as
big news the fact that the U.S.
secretary of state, who is in Paris
on the official business of the
SEATO meeting, had a long talk
with the French foreign minister
and has actually been received by
the president of the French re
public. What should be normal
and routine among allies has
come to look like a mysterious
event of which the full signifi
cance has still to be deciphered.
It is not difficult to think of
reasons why General de Gaulle
may have deeided that ho has
carried too far his antagonism to
the “Anglo-Saxons” and the At
lantic community. There is, for
one thing, mounting evidence
that his continental allies, the
Germans, the Italians, the Bel
gians and the Dutch, have not
much appetite for a “Europe”
governed from Paris by General
de Gaulle. There is increasing
reason to believe that the Euro
