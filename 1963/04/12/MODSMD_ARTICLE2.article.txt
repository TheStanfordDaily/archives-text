# Goodman Attacks 'Useful' Education
## 
### BERT CARP 
There is very little that Stan
ford. or any other university re
ceiving substantial government
subsidies, can do to improve the
liberal quality of the education of
fered, educator Paul Goodman told
a Stanford audience yesterday.
Goodman quoted the preamble
to the education bill from Presi
dent Kennedy’s 1963 message to
Congress: “Vast regions of the
unknown arc now being explored
for military, medical, commercial,
and other reasons.”
This, Goodman emphasized, is j
the government's attitude, but it
creates technicians, not scientists,
students oriented to the obtaining
of grades, essentially uninterested
in their subject. What is needed
are “society makers” and not “so
ciety trainees.”
THE NATIONAL Defense Edu
cation Act was disastrous to high
er education, according to Good
man. It has overweighted the uni
versities with non - teaching re
searchers and students of great
technical virtuosity with little
feeling for their subject.
Goodman feels that Americans
are brainwashed throughout their
scholastic careers. All news, he
asserted, proceeds from the three
major news services, and is essen
tially the same. In the newspa
pers, magazines, and television,
the student is presented with the
same news; he is told “what is
newsworthy.”
The news media not only “brain
wash” the American people, they
determine the standard of living.
Activities and objects become de
sirable from exposure, and only
those activities likely to raise the
gross national product are ex
posed.
FROM ANOTHER point of
view, said Goodman, reading, pick
eting for peace, and star-gazing do
create a standard of living that
has “great life rewards but does
not swell the G.N.P.”
The only hope for a truly demo
cratic society is a truly scientific
society, Goodman concluded. Uni
versities must develop truly prag
matic social science and humani
ties departments which try to
change circumstances they feel
unjust.
Goodman will lead a panel dis
cussion as part of the program on
the revitalization of liberal educa
tion today at 4:15 p.m. in the Tres
idder Lounge. The panel will in
clude Arnold Kaufman, Prof, of
Philosophy at the University of
Michigan; W. Bliss Carnochan,
Prof, of English at Stanford, and
Joseph Katz of Stanford’s Center
of the Study of Human Problems
and author of “The American Col
lege.” Student panelists will be
Roan Conrad, James Woolsey, and
David French.

posed.
FROM ANOTHER point of
view, said Goodman, reading, pick
eting for peace, and star-gazing do
create a standard of living that
has “great life rewards but does
not swell the G.N.P.”
The only hope for a truly demo
cratic society is a truly scientific
society, Goodman concluded. Uni
versities must develop truly prag
matic social science and humani
ties departments which try to
change circumstances they feel
unjust.
Goodman will lead a panel dis
cussion as part of the program on
the revitalization of liberal educa
tion today at 4:15 p.m. in the Tres
idder Lounge. The panel will in
clude Arnold Kaufman, Prof, of
Philosophy at the University of
Michigan; W. Bliss Carnochan,
Prof, of English at Stanford, and
Joseph Katz of Stanford’s Center
of the Study of Human Problems
and author of “The American Col
lege.” Student panelists will be
Roan Conrad, James Woolsey, and
David French.
There is very little that Stan
ford. or any other university re
ceiving substantial government
subsidies, can do to improve the
liberal quality of the education of
fered, educator Paul Goodman told
a Stanford audience yesterday.
Goodman quoted the preamble
to the education bill from Presi
dent Kennedy’s 1963 message to
Congress: “Vast regions of the
unknown arc now being explored
for military, medical, commercial,
and other reasons.”
This, Goodman emphasized, is j
the government's attitude, but it
creates technicians, not scientists,
students oriented to the obtaining
of grades, essentially uninterested
in their subject. What is needed
are “society makers” and not “so
ciety trainees.”
THE NATIONAL Defense Edu
cation Act was disastrous to high
er education, according to Good
man. It has overweighted the uni
versities with non - teaching re
searchers and students of great
technical virtuosity with little
feeling for their subject.
Goodman feels that Americans
are brainwashed throughout their
scholastic careers. All news, he
asserted, proceeds from the three
major news services, and is essen
tially the same. In the newspa
pers, magazines, and television,
the student is presented with the
same news; he is told “what is
newsworthy.”
The news media not only “brain
wash” the American people, they
determine the standard of living.
Activities and objects become de
sirable from exposure, and only
those activities likely to raise the
gross national product are ex
posed.
