# Lonborg Beats Santa 2-0
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Stanford's usual formula, good
pitching and fielding but poor
hitting, was enough to edge win
less Santa Clara 2-0 yesterday at
the Sunken Diamond. Right-hand
er Jim Lonborg pitched a brilli
ant four-hit shutout to give the

Tribe its first CIBA win of the
season as against (wo defeats.
Santa Clara has now lost four
straight.
Lonborg hooked up with the
Bronco’s Charlie Marcinero in a
pitcher’s duel which saw neither
team come close to scoring

through the first five innings.
Each team had but one hit
through these five stanzas.
In the top of the sixth Santa
Clara loaded the bases with one
out on two singles and a hit bats
man. Lonborg got a strikeout, one
of nine EC’s he posted during the
game, and then induced Santa
Clara’s leading hitter, Tim Cullen,
to fly out to center field,
j STANFORD also threatened to
break the tie in (he sixth, loading
jthe bases with two outs, but
| pinch batter Rich Berra skied out
i to end the inning. At this point
Lonborg must have felt like he
was pitching for the Mets, who
have failed to score in their first
two games. In Lonborg’s first
i league outing, Ihe Indians could
j gel him only one run, and he lost
{ to the Trojans in II innings, en
titling him to be ranked with
such hard luck losers as the War
riors and Robert E. Lee.
In the seventh Stanford “erupt
ed” for two walks and a hit; and
finally scored a run when the
tiring Marcinero threw a pitch in
j the dirt that went as a passed
| ball. Shortstop Joel Shulman car
ried the run across.
JUSt TO SHOW that it wasn’t
a once-a-season occurance, (he
Tribe scored another marker in
the eighth. Gary Smith singled,
moved to second on George
Thacher’s one-bagger, and ad
vanced to third on Marcinero’s
wild pitch. Lonborg then laid
down a perfect bunt, squeezing
[ the run across.
With Darrell Sutherland, the
j other half of Stanford’s starting
j rotation, warming up in the bull
pen, Lonborg went out in the
j ninth and wrapped up his shut
out, fanning the first two men on
j six pitches and then getting a
! ground out to end it.
ALTHOUGH Santa Clara seem
ed to have forgotten to bring
I their hitters, they did bring along
j one of the best teams for bench
j jockeying in anybody’s league.
I Until they seemed suddenly to
j quiet down in the seventh inning,
j probably having frozen to death
because their dugout was facing
| the wind, they did a complete job
j of razzing Stanford and thanking
the players for last year’s trip to
Omaha. (They beat the Tribe,
thus qualifying for the champion
ships held in Omaha.) However,
Lonborg and Company had the
I last laugh. Or come to think of
j it. maybe the last laugh belongs
I to the scoreboard keeper, who mo
j mentarily quit his job in the
j eighth inning to play jump rope
1 with two small girls (not Stan
| ford co-eds, however).
