# Oarsmen Take on Powerful Cal
## 
### PETE KING 
As far as the three Stanford
crews are concerned, this Satur
day is the day they’ve been point
ing for all year. They meet arch
rival California on the Oakland
estuary for three races. The JV’s
go at 11:30 a.m., followed by the
freshmen at 11:40, and the varsity
boat at noon.
STANFORD HAS its best crew
in years, but will have to be
rated an underdog because of
Cal’s perennial strength. The In
dians last beat the Bears in a
varsity race in 1957, from where
they went on to place fourth in
the national championships back
east.
So far this season Cal has im
pressively beaten Long Beach
State and Oregon State, the lat
ter by four lengths. Last week
under the worst possible rowing
conditions, Stanford beat OSU by
a mere half length.
Coach Conn Findley has said
of his oarsmen, “They’re in the
best shape a Stanford crew has
been in for years.’’ He foresees
a Card frosh win, and thinks the
senior rowers will follow their
example.
IN PREPARATION, the varsi
ty this week stroked off six 500-
meter sprints, all in around 1:35,
which is excellent lime.
Reserve frosh crews from both
schools will meet in a race this
afternoon at 2 p.m.
