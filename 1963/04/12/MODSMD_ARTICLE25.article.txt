# Stanford, Oregon Clash For No. 2 Ranking in U.S.
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford’s upset-minded track
men will be gunning for a num
ber two national ranking when
they do battle with the powerful
University of Oregon tiiinclads
tomorrow in the Stadium. Field
events start at 1:30 p.m., with the
running at 2 p.m.
Oregon is presently rated as
the second be.st collegiate track
team, behind USC, with Stanford
and San Jose State tied for third.
A Stanford win would catapult
the Indians to the ranks of top
challengers behind the Trojans,
and set the stage for a showdown
meet between USC and Stanford
next weekend.
STANFORD track fans will be
treated to a new sight tomorrow.
This new sight will probably be
the deciding factor in the meet,
as all other “ifs” and “buts” will
probably cancel each other out.
The new sight will he at the pole
vault runway and pit, where
spectators will see Phil White
vaulting over the bar at 12-6.
Usually White, who is the top
vaulter in Stanford history with
a best of 15 feet, passes on his
vaults until 14, easily clears that
height and runs into difficulty at
14-6. If he clears that height he
has all sorts of trouble at 15 feel.

This procedure has blown one
meet and almost shot another out
the window. Stanford was com
ing from behind against Sun Jose
State two weeks ago and looked
to be in good shape until White
lost in the pole vault to a Spartan
vaulter he should have beaten at
a height he could have cleared.
LAST WIT H Stanford boat Oc
cidental, a team the Tribe should
have handled much more easily.
The reason for the trouble was
White’s failure to clear 14 feet,
the height at which he entered
(he competition.
Stanford Track Coach Payton
Jordan has had his fill of White’s
overconfidence and plans to start
his ace vaulter out at 12-6 and
have him vault at every height
thereafter. The Daily dope sheet
therefore picks White to win the
pole vault and thereby win the
meet for Stanford, not because of
White’s ability, hut because of
Jordan’s coaching.
It will he strange to see a
vaulter go over the bar by at least
two feet but White will bo doing
that tomorrow.
The meet should be a question
mark right from the very start.
Stanford will squeak by in the
4 10 relay with .the only question
mark being will Stanford finally
go under 41 seconds.
THE STRATEGY’ starts in the
mile, where Harry McCalla will
oppose Keith Forman, who has
run a 4:03.7 so far (his year, and
holds the second fastest college
mile ever, 3:58.3. This race prom
ises to be the fastest mile run in
the country this year. McCalla
could win it, but he’ll have to run
the fastest mile of his life to do
it.
The 440-yd. run is another take
6-5 odds and pick the winner. Ray
Van Asten, the national junior col
lege 880 record holder, will at
tempt to pick up a needed Webfoot
win, but Ken Emanuels should
hold off the Dutchman’s challenge.
Rich Chesarek could move ahead
of Van Asten into second.
Van Asten, who has a lifetime
best of 1:48.6, should win the 880,
but he hasn't been running up to
form this year. If he goes all-out
in the 440 he might he tired enough
to let either Bill Pratt, Robin Ruble
or Harlan Andrews past, or may
be all three.
MEL RENFRO, who has ruined
Stanford on the football field for
two straight years, gets his chance
to do it in track as well. He is an
odds-on choice to beat Steve Cort
right in the high hurdles. He has
a best of 13.8 at Stanford. Cort
right will likely set a personal best
in finishing second.
The intermediate hurdles are a
Stanford strong - point. Cortright
and Phil Arnaudo will beat Ren
fro. Both are over a second faster
than the Webfbot flash.

The two-mile run could be the
turning point of the meet. Jordan
has assigned McCalla to run only
the mile and give it everything.
He hopes to wear down Forman
so he will be ineffective in the
longer distance, where he has a
best of 8:56.5. Forman has been
less than sensational in 1963. The
Daily picks Paul Schlicko to win.
STANFORD should easily lake
the mile relay. Jordan has shuf
fled the team a little, having Bob
Miltz replacing Mclntyre so the
latter can go all out in the 220
and 440.
The field events are more cut
and dried. Dave Weill will win the
discus, possibly breaking his own
NCAA record. Dave Steen, despite

an ailing arm, will shot put over
60 feet. Oregon will sweep the
javelin and iwo Welifoot 6-9 high
jumpers will finish 12, Cortright
and Downey will take first and
second in.the triple jump.
ONI.V the broad jump and pole
vault arc und( tid i Renfro should
beat Dan Moore in the former.
Moore has recently recovered from
a hip muscle cramp and may sur
prise.
This brings the meet down to
the pole vault. Oregon could con
ceivably sweep, with two men who
have gone 14-6 in competition, and
another who has vaidtecl 45 feet
in practice. Stanford has White,
inconsistent but very talented. The
Daily picks White.

therefore picks White to win the

Jordan’s coaching.
It will he strange to see a
vaulter go over the bar by at least
two feet but White will bo doing
that tomorrow.
The meet should be a question
mark right from the very start.
Stanford will squeak by in the
4 10 relay with .the only question
mark being will Stanford finally
go under 41 seconds.
THE STRATEGY’ starts in the
mile, where Harry McCalla will
oppose Keith Forman, who has
run a 4:03.7 so far (his year, and
holds the second fastest college
mile ever, 3:58.3. This race prom
ises to be the fastest mile run in
the country this year. McCalla
could win it, but he’ll have to run
the fastest mile of his life to do
it.
The 440-yd. run is another take
6-5 odds and pick the winner. Ray
Van Asten, the national junior col
lege 880 record holder, will at
tempt to pick up a needed Webfoot
win, but Ken Emanuels should
hold off the Dutchman’s challenge.
Rich Chesarek could move ahead
of Van Asten into second.
Van Asten, who has a lifetime
best of 1:48.6, should win the 880,
but he hasn't been running up to
form this year. If he goes all-out
in the 440 he might he tired enough
to let either Bill Pratt, Robin Ruble
or Harlan Andrews past, or may
be all three.
MEL RENFRO, who has ruined
Stanford on the football field for
two straight years, gets his chance
to do it in track as well. He is an
odds-on choice to beat Steve Cort
right in the high hurdles. He has
a best of 13.8 at Stanford. Cort
right will likely set a personal best
in finishing second.
The intermediate hurdles are a
Stanford strong - point. Cortright
and Phil Arnaudo will beat Ren
fro. Both are over a second faster
than the Webfbot flash.

The two-mile run could be the
turning point of the meet. Jordan
has assigned McCalla to run only
the mile and give it everything.
He hopes to wear down Forman
so he will be ineffective in the
longer distance, where he has a
best of 8:56.5. Forman has been
less than sensational in 1963. The
Daily picks Paul Schlicko to win.
STANFORD should easily lake
the mile relay. Jordan has shuf
fled the team a little, having Bob
Miltz replacing Mclntyre so the
latter can go all out in the 220
and 440.
The field events are more cut
and dried. Dave Weill will win the
discus, possibly breaking his own
NCAA record. Dave Steen, despite

an ailing arm, will shot put over
60 feet. Oregon will sweep the
javelin and iwo Welifoot 6-9 high
jumpers will finish 12, Cortright
and Downey will take first and
second in.the triple jump.
ONI.V the broad jump and pole
vault arc und( tid i Renfro should
beat Dan Moore in the former.
Moore has recently recovered from
a hip muscle cramp and may sur
prise.
This brings the meet down to
the pole vault. Oregon could con
ceivably sweep, with two men who
have gone 14-6 in competition, and
another who has vaidtecl 45 feet
in practice. Stanford has White,
inconsistent but very talented. The
Daily picks White.

a best of 13.8 at Stanford. Cort
right will likely set a personal best
in finishing second.
The intermediate hurdles are a
Stanford strong - point. Cortright
and Phil Arnaudo will beat Ren
fro. Both are over a second faster
than the Webfbot flash.

The two-mile run could be the
turning point of the meet. Jordan
has assigned McCalla to run only
the mile and give it everything.
He hopes to wear down Forman
so he will be ineffective in the
longer distance, where he has a
best of 8:56.5. Forman has been
less than sensational in 1963. The
Daily picks Paul Schlicko to win.
STANFORD should easily lake
the mile relay. Jordan has shuf
fled the team a little, having Bob
Miltz replacing Mclntyre so the
latter can go all out in the 220
and 440.
The field events are more cut
and dried. Dave Weill will win the
discus, possibly breaking his own
NCAA record. Dave Steen, despite

an ailing arm, will shot put over
60 feet. Oregon will sweep the
javelin and iwo Welifoot 6-9 high
jumpers will finish 12, Cortright
and Downey will take first and
second in.the triple jump.
ONI.V the broad jump and pole
vault arc und( tid i Renfro should
beat Dan Moore in the former.
Moore has recently recovered from
a hip muscle cramp and may sur
prise.
This brings the meet down to
the pole vault. Oregon could con
ceivably sweep, with two men who
have gone 14-6 in competition, and
another who has vaidtecl 45 feet
in practice. Stanford has White,
inconsistent but very talented. The
Daily picks White.


STANFORD POLE VAULTER Phil White strives to regain 15 foot-plus
form for the Oregon meet tomorrow. The school record holder at
15-O½, White has not cleared 15 feet since the Stanford Relays,
five weeks ago.
Stanford’s upset-minded track
men will be gunning for a num
ber two national ranking when
they do battle with the powerful
University of Oregon tiiinclads
tomorrow in the Stadium. Field
events start at 1:30 p.m., with the
running at 2 p.m.
Oregon is presently rated as
the second be.st collegiate track
team, behind USC, with Stanford
and San Jose State tied for third.
A Stanford win would catapult
the Indians to the ranks of top
challengers behind the Trojans,
and set the stage for a showdown
meet between USC and Stanford
next weekend.
STANFORD track fans will be
treated to a new sight tomorrow.
This new sight will probably be
the deciding factor in the meet,
as all other “ifs” and “buts” will
probably cancel each other out.
The new sight will he at the pole
vault runway and pit, where
spectators will see Phil White
vaulting over the bar at 12-6.
Usually White, who is the top
vaulter in Stanford history with
a best of 15 feet, passes on his
vaults until 14, easily clears that
height and runs into difficulty at
14-6. If he clears that height he
has all sorts of trouble at 15 feel.

This procedure has blown one
meet and almost shot another out
the window. Stanford was com
ing from behind against Sun Jose
State two weeks ago and looked
to be in good shape until White
lost in the pole vault to a Spartan
vaulter he should have beaten at
a height he could have cleared.
LAST WIT H Stanford boat Oc
cidental, a team the Tribe should
have handled much more easily.
The reason for the trouble was
White’s failure to clear 14 feet,
the height at which he entered
(he competition.
Stanford Track Coach Payton
Jordan has had his fill of White’s
overconfidence and plans to start
his ace vaulter out at 12-6 and
have him vault at every height
thereafter. The Daily dope sheet
therefore picks White to win the
pole vault and thereby win the
meet for Stanford, not because of
White’s ability, hut because of
Jordan’s coaching.
It will he strange to see a
vaulter go over the bar by at least
two feet but White will bo doing
that tomorrow.
The meet should be a question
mark right from the very start.
Stanford will squeak by in the
4 10 relay with .the only question
mark being will Stanford finally
go under 41 seconds.
THE STRATEGY’ starts in the
mile, where Harry McCalla will
oppose Keith Forman, who has
run a 4:03.7 so far (his year, and
holds the second fastest college
mile ever, 3:58.3. This race prom
ises to be the fastest mile run in
the country this year. McCalla
could win it, but he’ll have to run
the fastest mile of his life to do
it.
The 440-yd. run is another take
6-5 odds and pick the winner. Ray
Van Asten, the national junior col
lege 880 record holder, will at
tempt to pick up a needed Webfoot
win, but Ken Emanuels should
hold off the Dutchman’s challenge.
Rich Chesarek could move ahead
of Van Asten into second.
Van Asten, who has a lifetime
best of 1:48.6, should win the 880,
but he hasn't been running up to
form this year. If he goes all-out
in the 440 he might he tired enough
to let either Bill Pratt, Robin Ruble
or Harlan Andrews past, or may
be all three.
MEL RENFRO, who has ruined
Stanford on the football field for
two straight years, gets his chance
to do it in track as well. He is an
odds-on choice to beat Steve Cort
right in the high hurdles. He has
a best of 13.8 at Stanford. Cort
