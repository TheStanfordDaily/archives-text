uate of Stanford’s School of Busi

post of Director for Fraternities.
He will coordinate business and
academic affairs for the 24 frater
nities here, working under Acting

Business Manager Dwight B.
Adams.
Summers said yesterday that
the administration’s creation of a
post dealing solely with fraterni
ties “shows that Stanford is vitally
concerned with the continuance
and strengthening of fraternity
life.” He cited the Faculty Resi
dent Program as one W'ay in which
the fraternity system has bene
fited by innovation.
Summers said he is particularly
enthusiastic about his job and its
potential, since “Stanford offers
several different and original ap
proaches to fraternities.” He men
tioned the clusters as one such
“pioneering” approach.
A Sigma Chi, he graduated from
the University of Minnesota where
he majored in political science and
international relations. He then
served in the Navy five years. For
the past two years he has been
working in the metals industry.
He is married and has three
