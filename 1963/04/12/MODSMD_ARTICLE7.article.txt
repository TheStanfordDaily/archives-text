United Press International

WASHINGTON -Anguished parents, wives and children of the
129 men lost in a watery grave with the nuclear submarine Thresher,
bore their grief stoically or in tears, but one Navy wife raised an
angry cry that her husband had considered his ship a floating
“coffin.” President Kennedy and high naval officials led the nation
in mourning the loss, in this the first submarine disaster of the
atomic age and the worst in the history of the sea. The $5O million
nuclear craft, deepest diving ship of the nation’s nuclear submarine
fleet, went down in Atlantic waters a mile and a half deep while
engaging in deep-diving tests 220 miles east of Boston. Aboard were
17 civilians from the Portsmouth, N.H., shipyard where the Thresher
had undergone an overhaul. Hope was abandoned after searchers
spotted an oil slick and floating debris at the area where the ship
was operating. The floating materials were cork and plastic such
as used “in the internal construction of a submarine.”
HUNGER, FEAR. AND FIGHTING IN LAOS VIENTIANE, Laos-
Neutralist troops were reported driving toward the town of Xicng

Communist forces. Refugees fleeing the Plain of Jars battle area
poured into Vientiane with stories of widespread hunger and fear.
The three-nation International Control Commission prepared to send
a peace mission to the area today to try to stop the fighting. India's
Avtar Singh, chairman of the ICC, said the situation is “bad" but
“we are working with faith” to restore order. He and his Polish and
Canadian colleagues on the commission went to the Plain of Jars
Wednesday and talked with the rival commanders, neutralist Gen.
Kong Le and Pathet Lao Col. Singkapo. They refused to say what
they discussed.

KENNEDY AGAINST STEEL INCREASE -WASHINGTON Presi
dent Kennedy called on the steel industry yesterday to forego any
across-the-board price increases- but left it free to seek “selective”
price rises geared to supply and demand. To ward off “another in
flationary spiral.” he also appealed to steelworkers to show similar
restraint in their wage demands. With 100,000 steelemen unemployed,
he said there was a need for more jobs with job security, not fewer
jobs at higher wages.
