## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
Should the price of the flicks on April 28 be raised to 40 cents to support the Con Home
drive. Legislature, in its debut last night, proved unequal to the ask of resolving this question.
The first tally; thirty legislators for, thirty legis! I io gainst.
Unbelievable,” said presiding officer Annin Hr sencranz. A second count was made; thirty
two foi, thirty-two against. The new legislature, in its first meeting, had found an issue upon

which its members were dead- -t
locked. Jerry Jackson ended the
agony by asking for a quorum
call. By 9:45 p.m. nineteen of the
eighty-four members that had
answered the seventeen-minute
roll call earlier in the evening had
left, leaving the body thirteen
short of a quorum.
ASSU PRESIDENT Armin Ro
sencranz opened the meeting with
a summary of recent activities in
volving the ASSU. In reference
to the new Trustee regulations
prohibiting Legislature from tak
ing stands on public issues in the
name of the student body, he said
that the voice of the students at
Stanford would be more effective
ly heard in the national and in
ternational student community if
Legislature were allowed to speak
out in behalf of the student body.
However, he said, the Trustees’
reasoning, that such authority
would be inappropriate for the
representatives of a body whose
membership is compulsory, is cer
tainly not unreasonable and “I
personally accept it.”
Rosencranz also made reference
to Conference on the Goals of a
Liberal Education, presently be
ing held under the co-sponsorship
of the ASSU and Stanford Today
and Tomorrow.
He also noted that Stanford in
Washington program for summer
student internships on Capitol
Hill was making plans to place
more than twenty students in
challenging positions in Washing
ton this summer.
IN OTHER business, the Legis
lature approved the opening of
the boat house and Lake Lag,
j and appropriated $295 to reim
! burse several students for ex
penses incurred in past weeks at
a number of national conferences
where they represented the As
sociated Students.
The By-Laws Committee sub
mitted its proposals for revision
of the ASSU by-laws under the
new Constitution. These will be
voted upon at next week’s Legis
lature meeting.
The proposals include the for
mation of four standing commit
tees, appointed by the Speaker,
to oversee legislative procedures.
A Rules Committee, consisting of
the Speaker and the chairmen of
the three other standing commit
tees. will “regulate the form of
legislation and construct the cal
endar of each Legislature meet
ing.”
A BY-LAWS Committee will
“study and recommend questions
pertaining to the By-laws of the
Associated Students.” An appro
priations committee will concern
itself with financial appropria
tions.
A Student Affairs Committee
will study the activities of the
various boards and commissions
of the Associated Students.
The proposed by-laws also pro
vide for a Speaker, to be elected
in two weeks, who will preside

over meetings of Legislature and
who will chair the Rules Commit
tee. Until the election of the
Speaker, the ASSU president will
preside over meetings of Legis
lature, according to the proposed
by-laws.
THE FOLLOWING regulations
concerning the use of University
facilities and the use of the name
‘Stanford’ were also proposed:
“All monies of students’ or
ganizations must be deposited

with the "Students’ Organization
Fund” for these organizations to
use University facilities for
either open or closed functions.”
“It shall bo unlawful for any
voluntary organization or group
to use the name ‘Stanford’ (or
any other name designating this
University) unless they shall
have first registered that organi
zation or group with the Commit
tee on Student Affairs and Serv
ices.”

Rosencranz also made reference
to Conference on the Goals of a
Liberal Education, presently be
ing held under the co-sponsorship
of the ASSU and Stanford Today
and Tomorrow.
He also noted that Stanford in
Washington program for summer
student internships on Capitol
Hill was making plans to place
more than twenty students in
challenging positions in Washing
ton this summer.
IN OTHER business, the Legis
lature approved the opening of
the boat house and Lake Lag,
j and appropriated $295 to reim
! burse several students for ex
penses incurred in past weeks at
a number of national conferences
where they represented the As
sociated Students.
The By-Laws Committee sub
mitted its proposals for revision
of the ASSU by-laws under the
new Constitution. These will be
voted upon at next week’s Legis
lature meeting.
The proposals include the for
mation of four standing commit
tees, appointed by the Speaker,
to oversee legislative procedures.
A Rules Committee, consisting of
the Speaker and the chairmen of
the three other standing commit
tees. will “regulate the form of
legislation and construct the cal
endar of each Legislature meet
ing.”
A BY-LAWS Committee will
“study and recommend questions
pertaining to the By-laws of the
Associated Students.” An appro
priations committee will concern
itself with financial appropria
tions.
A Student Affairs Committee
will study the activities of the
various boards and commissions
of the Associated Students.
The proposed by-laws also pro
vide for a Speaker, to be elected
in two weeks, who will preside

over meetings of Legislature and
who will chair the Rules Commit
tee. Until the election of the
Speaker, the ASSU president will
preside over meetings of Legis
lature, according to the proposed
by-laws.
THE FOLLOWING regulations
concerning the use of University
facilities and the use of the name
‘Stanford’ were also proposed:
“All monies of students’ or
ganizations must be deposited

with the "Students’ Organization
Fund” for these organizations to
use University facilities for
either open or closed functions.”
“It shall bo unlawful for any
voluntary organization or group
to use the name ‘Stanford’ (or
any other name designating this
University) unless they shall
have first registered that organi
zation or group with the Commit
tee on Student Affairs and Serv
ices.”
Should the price of the flicks on April 28 be raised to 40 cents to support the Con Home
drive. Legislature, in its debut last night, proved unequal to the ask of resolving this question.
The first tally; thirty legislators for, thirty legis! I io gainst.
Unbelievable,” said presiding officer Annin Hr sencranz. A second count was made; thirty
two foi, thirty-two against. The new legislature, in its first meeting, had found an issue upon

which its members were dead- -t
locked. Jerry Jackson ended the
agony by asking for a quorum
call. By 9:45 p.m. nineteen of the
eighty-four members that had
answered the seventeen-minute
roll call earlier in the evening had
left, leaving the body thirteen
short of a quorum.
ASSU PRESIDENT Armin Ro
sencranz opened the meeting with
a summary of recent activities in
volving the ASSU. In reference
to the new Trustee regulations
prohibiting Legislature from tak
ing stands on public issues in the
name of the student body, he said
that the voice of the students at
Stanford would be more effective
ly heard in the national and in
ternational student community if
Legislature were allowed to speak
out in behalf of the student body.
However, he said, the Trustees’
reasoning, that such authority
would be inappropriate for the
representatives of a body whose
membership is compulsory, is cer
tainly not unreasonable and “I
personally accept it.”
