# Heiskell Discusses Difficulties Of Latin American Countries
## 
### SHEILA RICKETTS 
Andrew Heiskell, chairman of
the Board of Directors of Time,
Inc., pointed out the importance
of recognizing the vast differ
ences between the societies of
Latin America and of the United
States to the success of the Alli
ance for Progress yesterday at
4:15 p.m. in the Tresidder lounge
in a speech on "The United States
and Latin America.”
“For many, the idea of the ‘Ali
ancia’ was that we were in effect
doing a Marshall Plan in Latin
America as we did in Europe,”
said Heiskell.
“But in Europe,” he continued,
“we were taking societies which
were very similar to us and re
building on top of a viable struc
ture.”
IN LATIN AMERICA we are
dealing with very different soci
eties. We are. in fact, trying to
build underdeveloped nations into
developed nations.
Heiskell pointed to such differ
ences as the undiversified econ
omies of the Latin American
countries. These countries are
largely dependent on one crop or
raw material for their export in
comes. The prices of these ex
port crops have been dropping in
the last ten years while the prices
of the goods they have to import
have been rising.
He also pointed out political
differences. Parties are generally
followings of specific leaders and
power is concentrated in the
hands of the large hacienda or
land-holding families. Moreover,
the wide group of institutions
which prop up the democratic
process in the U.S. are largely
non-existent in Latin America.
“I THINK the ‘Aliancia’ is go
ing to work,” said Heiskell, “but
it is a terrible misconception to
think it’s going to work rapidly.”
The problem is, he explained,
that we don’t have the 10, 15 ox
-25 years necessary, largely be
cause of the Castro Revolution.
Heiskell pointed out three
things that we have to do in order
to gain time.
“One way or the other,” he said,
“wo have to remove Castro.”
We also have to create the kind
of left-of-center leadership that
will make development possible.
Finally, we have to do some
hting about the import-export
squeeze.
