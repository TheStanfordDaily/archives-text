# Sandperl, Weinig Will Lead Open Discussion on Shelters
## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
Ira Sandperl and Dick Weinig will lead an open debate on the
morality and polities of fallout shelters this evening at 8:45 in
room 274-275 of Tresidder Union. Following comments and argu
ments presented by onlookers, resolutions concerning the issues
discussed will be amended and voted upon by the 1 audience.

The resolutions and the record-"
ed votes will be sent to appropri
ate persons and agencies by the
newly formed Stanford Student
Congress, which organized the
discussion.
SANDPERL, who will speak
against fallout shelters, asserted
in an interview that the existence
of fallout shelters and a fallout
shelter program promotes a men
tality prone to accept the illusion
that nuclear war is a feasible
method of preserving democracy.
Weinig, in a similar interview,
stated that “Any thorough study
of Soviet military thought indi
cates that construction of Ameri
can fallout shelters will, if any
thing, help forestall a Soviet nu
clear strike. This is not to men
tion the lives which shelters
would save should the United
States undergo nuclear attack by
Soviet design or by accident.”
Bob Beyers, Direstor of the
Stanford University News Serv
ice. will precede the discussion
with a statement concerning the
status of fallout shelters at the
University.
Tin; FOLLOWING brief ac
count of fallout shelters was re
lated to the Daily by Carl Irwin,
University Health Physicist:
• The first stage of the Civil
Defense program, as far as fall

out shelters were concerned, was
to determine what kind of fallout
protection was already available.
• Architectural engineers were
commissioned throughout the na
1 1ion to survey all buildings that
might serve as fallout shelters.
I Each building was given a cer
-1 tain protection rating,
t • Civil Defense headquarters
| examined this list of buildings
and selected those with a protec
tion above a certain level. Owners
were asked to volunteer these
buildings for use by the govern
ment in the Civil Defense pro
gram.
• The fallout shelters at Stan
ford are part of this first stage
development. They are stocked
with dog biscuit and empty water
cans. The water cans are gradu
ally being filled by the fire de
partment.
• AS PUBLIC SHELTERS, the
Stanford fallout shelters are open
to resident of Palo Alto and the
surrounding vicinity as well as
to Stanford students and faculty.
• The stated capacity of the
fallout shelters is limited by a
| two-week food supply. After two
weeks, any abnormal radiation
level is decreased by a factor of
about a thousand. The present
fallout shelters will accommodate
considerably more than the stated
number of people, but for corre
spondingly less time.

number of people, but for corre
spondingly less time.
Ira Sandperl and Dick Weinig will lead an open debate on the
morality and polities of fallout shelters this evening at 8:45 in
room 274-275 of Tresidder Union. Following comments and argu
ments presented by onlookers, resolutions concerning the issues
discussed will be amended and voted upon by the 1 audience.

The resolutions and the record-"
ed votes will be sent to appropri
ate persons and agencies by the
newly formed Stanford Student
Congress, which organized the
discussion.
SANDPERL, who will speak
against fallout shelters, asserted
in an interview that the existence
of fallout shelters and a fallout
shelter program promotes a men
tality prone to accept the illusion
that nuclear war is a feasible
method of preserving democracy.
Weinig, in a similar interview,
stated that “Any thorough study
of Soviet military thought indi
cates that construction of Ameri
can fallout shelters will, if any
thing, help forestall a Soviet nu
clear strike. This is not to men
tion the lives which shelters
would save should the United
States undergo nuclear attack by
Soviet design or by accident.”
Bob Beyers, Direstor of the
Stanford University News Serv
ice. will precede the discussion
with a statement concerning the
status of fallout shelters at the
University.
Tin; FOLLOWING brief ac
count of fallout shelters was re
lated to the Daily by Carl Irwin,
University Health Physicist:
• The first stage of the Civil
Defense program, as far as fall

out shelters were concerned, was
to determine what kind of fallout
protection was already available.
• Architectural engineers were
commissioned throughout the na
1 1ion to survey all buildings that
might serve as fallout shelters.
I Each building was given a cer
-1 tain protection rating,
t • Civil Defense headquarters
| examined this list of buildings
and selected those with a protec
tion above a certain level. Owners
were asked to volunteer these
buildings for use by the govern
ment in the Civil Defense pro
gram.
• The fallout shelters at Stan
ford are part of this first stage
development. They are stocked
with dog biscuit and empty water
cans. The water cans are gradu
ally being filled by the fire de
partment.
• AS PUBLIC SHELTERS, the
Stanford fallout shelters are open
to resident of Palo Alto and the
surrounding vicinity as well as
to Stanford students and faculty.
• The stated capacity of the
fallout shelters is limited by a
| two-week food supply. After two
weeks, any abnormal radiation
level is decreased by a factor of
about a thousand. The present
fallout shelters will accommodate
considerably more than the stated
number of people, but for corre
spondingly less time.
