# Plans Underway For Latin America Study Residence
## 
### 
Plans are now proceeding for a
Latin America House in Stern
next year. The house will offer
its residents an opportunity to
extend their education into their
residence, and to arouse interest
in Latin America on the Stan
ford campus.
Fred Goff, Stu Rawlings, and
Holt Ruffin, co-chairmen of the
project, conducted an informal
poll last quarter and found that
more than enough students are
interested in the living arrange
ment. A selection committee has
been formed and applications
have been printed.
HOLLADAY HOUSE with a ca
pacity of forty-three students,
will house the project next year.
Members will include sopho
mores, juniors, seniors, and six
Latin American students. The
resident assistant will preferably
be interested in Latin America.
Groups within the house will
work on such projects as estab
lishing a field work program
similar to “Crossroads Africa” in
Latin America. Language tables,
guest speakers, a Latin American
film series, a shortwave radio for
contact with any area of Latin
America, a newsletter, a library
subscribing to Latin American
publications, a soccer team, a
mariachi group, and Latin Amer
ican house decorations are among
cultural projects under consider
ation.
TAD SZULC, specialist in Lat
in American affairs for the “New
York Times” who spoke recently
at Stanford, was enthusiastic
about the idea and felt that Stan
ford is the ideal campus for such
a project.
Those interested in Latin
America house may obtain more
information by contacting either
Fred Goff or Holt Ruffin. Appli
cations for Latin America House
may bo obtained at the Stern of
fice, and must bo returned by
April 22. Selections will be an
nounced on May 1. There will
probably be a hostel for those
selected on May fl.
