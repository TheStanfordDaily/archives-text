(Editors’ note; A political analysis of recent Soviet activity in
control of the arts, by Dr. Irene Blumenthal of the Department of
rolitical Science and Assistant Director of the Overseas Campus
Program, will appear In tomorrow’s Daily.)
Yevgeny Yevtushenko, outspoken young Russian poet, will not
appear at Stanford as scheduled tor the May 28 Tuesday Evening
Series.

Agnes Norhenberg, head of Stanford’s Committee on Public
Exercises, received a call Friday from Albert Todd, organizer of

•Yevtushenko’s visit here and pro
fessor of Slavic languages at the
University of Indiana. Todd re
ported that he had received a ca
ble from Mrs. Yevtushenko indi
cating that her poet-husband’s
trip here was cancelled “for rea
sons of health.”
DUE TO Soviet Premier Khru
shchev’s increasing attacks
against the poet, speculation has
been high in past weeks on pos
sible cancellation of his six-week
U.S. visit during April and May.
The Soviet was scheduled to
speak at 16 university campuses
and the New York Poetry Center.
Ho was to spend a few days in
residence at Stern.
The New York Times of last
Saturday reported that “reliable
Soviet sources” indicated that
there must have been some “mis
understanding” regarding the
promise the Soviet Embassy in
Washington made to Princeton
University student organizers to
have the 29-year-old poet appear
at a symposium there. However,
a letter to President Sterling
from the U.S. State Department
affirmed that arrangements for
the tour were being made by
Todd.
IT IS SINCE the initial sched
uling of this trip, however, that
Yevtushenko's activities have
drawn their most violent and spe
cific condemnations from Soviet
political leaders.
During his recent trip to Paris,
the controversial poet published a
frank and much criticized autobi
ography in “L'Express.” He of
fered views of Soviet life, in this
publication, which were not in ac
cord with the current official par
ty line.
Yevtushenko’s disfavored stat
us is not a thing of long standing.
This summer he was a delegate
to the Soviet-backed “Eighth
World Festival of Youth and Stu
dents for Peace and Friendship”
at Helsinki, Finland. Ho read his
poetry at the Soviet nightclub
there, and was open in his frater
nizing with delegates.
After a March 8 attack by Pre
mier Khrushchev at a meeting of
Soviet artists and writers, the
young Soviet contacted the Indi
ana Department of Slavic Lan
guages to say that he still
planned his U.S. trip. This, how
ever, was before the “L’Express”
incident. The Soviet press de
manded that young artists and
writers be prevented from mak
ing trips abroad until they “ma
ture politically.”
IN DECEMBER of last year,
Russian composer Dmitri Shos
takovich was criticized by Khru
shchev for utilizing parts of Yev
touchenko’s poem “Baby Yar” in
a symphony. The poem is a com
mentary on the history of Soviet
anti-Semitism.
The New York Times reports
that the Soviet press last Friday
demanded that Yevtushenko be
ousted from the Writers’ Union.
The United States Embassy has
indicated that no application for
a visa has been received from the
poet.
