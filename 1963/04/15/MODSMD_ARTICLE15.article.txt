## Creeping Bigwheelism 
### K W SMITH 
Look at the Big Wheel.
Look. Look.
That is our Leader.
His name in Armincranz.
Bow. Bow.
Strew his path with red roses and prostrate thyself.
Some people say that Armin’ is Charmin’.
Charmin’. Charmin’.
Some people charm easy.
Hail to the Chief,
Heil. Hail.
Armin’ takes important things very seriously.
The most important thing is Armin’.
Look at Armin’ stand before the Grand Legislature.
Clap. Clap.
They are Proud of him.
He is (he Great White Father.
Salaam. Salaam.
He is proud of them.
They are his Sheep.
Baa. Baa.
See him bang the mighty brown gavel.
Womp. Womp.
Before there was disorganized noise and Babble.
Now Armin’ allows only organized Babble and noise.
Led by himself.
One must tread lightly around the Chief.
He experiences Trauma from certain bad words.
Like "Waterloo”.
Quiver. Quiver.
“Et tu, Scotty?”
Armin’ likes to do things in Reverse.
First he passed the Washington, D.C., Bar Exam.
Then he won the StußodChief Office.
Next year he will run for Freshman Class Vice President.
And Win.
Success. Success,
Armin’ has much spare time. Time. Time.
So he took up a new Hobby.
Letter Writing.
Write. Write.
Write to Pen Pals in Washington.
Other Bigger Wheels do not favorably view this new hobby
for StußodyPreses.
Armin’ is now seeking a now Hobby.
Suggestions? ?
Here comes Armin’ now.
Drip. Drip.
Ho is always dripping wet.
He has been trying his Walk-on-theWater trick again.
We will ask him a few questions.
"Armin’ the First, we would like to ask you —”
"Ask not what Armin’ the First ought do for you . . . .”
In those days of Mass Suicide
One can propose
Complete and Unilateral
Dis-armin-ment.
