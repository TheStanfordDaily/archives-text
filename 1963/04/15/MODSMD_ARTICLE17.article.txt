# CAMPUS OPINION
## The 						College YR Convention 
### MICHAEL J. MATHESON Vice-President, SAYB 
I am, to put it mildly, absolutely amazed at the descriptions
appearing in last week’s Daily of the recent YR College Federa
tion Convention in Fresno. Mr. Richard Weinig’s article, in par
ticular, struck me as an unusually biased and distorted por
trayal of the facts and issues involved. As a state officer and
member of the Executive Board of the Federation during that
Convention, perhaps I can clarify Just exactly what did take
place.
This was, to begin with, the annual convention of the Cali
fornia YR college Federation, conducted by the Federation’s own
elected officers and operated in accordance with the provisions
of its own Constitution. The Chairman of its Credentials Commit
tee. John Roveda, followed to the letter the procedures described
in the Federation’s Constitution and By-Laws (Article VIII,
Sections 9-12) which require that delegations challenged on the
basis of substantial documentary evidence be excluded from
voting on any committee until such challenges are resolved by
Credentials Committee. In this interpretation, Mr. Roveda was
subsequently backed unanimously by the Federation’s President,
Parliamentarian, Legal Counsel, and its entire Executive Board.
The Credentials Committee meeting was held in the largest
room available at that time (another larger room was being
prepared for a banquet and could not be used); every club
president and every delegate W’ho had challenges to present was
admitted to the room; the three officers of the State YR Or
ganization, with whom the College Federation is affiliated, who
had a legitimate place in the Committee (its Treasurer, General
Counsel, and College Advisor) were admitted and welcomed; at
no time were delegates prevented from conferring in an orderly
fashion with one another; and finally, the only persons in
structed to maintain order by force if necessary were two uni
formed members of the Fresno Police Department. At no time
was anyone thrown out, molested, or threatened with force; the
Credentials Committee employed no muscular goons or armed
agents whatsoever.
At this point, Robert Gaston, the man who was two months
ago elected with (he crucial and much-solicited help of (he state’s
John Birch Society members to the Presidency of the State YR
Organization, invited himself to our proceedings and discovered
that most of the units against W'hich documentary evidence had
been compiled were Gaston-oriented clubs. Without hesitating
to consider the consequences of his actions, Mr. Gaston quickly
organized his own college convention which convened the fol
lowing morning (in the very same room Mr. Weinig considered
too small for Credentials Committee) and elected a slate of state
officers.
Meanwhile, the College Federation Convention, attended and
supported by well over a majority of the college delegates in
Fresno (this was verified by reports from the wire service and
newspaper correspondents present) and by every single one of
its officers, had convened on schedule, elected Randy Siefkin
of UC at Santa Barbara its President, and in response to Mr.
Gaston’s threats empowered its newly-elected Executive Board
to end the Federation’s affiliations with the State YR Organiza
tion if necessary.
Five members of the Stanford delegation, led by Vice-Presi
dents Steve Raffin and Paul Finney, attended and participated
in the College Federation Convention. It has been said that they
were merely confused; let me only comment that their decision
was based upon extensive discussions with College Federation
President Harold Phillips and the two presidential candidates;
to this day they have publicly defended that decision in no un
certain terms. Their return to the Gaston Convention was forced
by their club President’s threat to vote their proxies for whom
ever she chose in their absence.
Finally, a word about ideologies. Our newly elected Federa
tion President, Randy Siefkin, is and to my knowledge always
has been a conservative Republican and a Goldwater supporter.
But he, like the Senator’s own campaign manager who attended
the Convention Saturday night to plead with the delegates to
reject right-wing extremism, ihas pledged to work with all ele
ments of the Party as we have pledged to work with him.
