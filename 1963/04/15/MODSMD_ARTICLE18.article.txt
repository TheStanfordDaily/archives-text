## Rocky: 'Out Front... as Candidate' 
### MICHAEL J. MATHESON By WILLIAM MOORE 
Governor Nelson Rockefeller is doing an excellent job of
proving that old political bromide—the one that says you can
always spot a Presidential hopeful by the number of times he
denies he’s running for office.
And, judging by the number of denials he’s made in the past
few months, Rocky is way out in front. As a matter of fact, the
poor man has had to travel all around the country trying to tell
people he’s really not running.
But whether he likes it or not, he has opened Presidential
season—and has paved the way for an endless barrage of advice
from pseudo pundits. Like me, for instance.
So-o-o, if the governor plans to seriously challenge Presi
dent Kennedy next year, he’d do well to junk some of the ludi
crous "issues” he’s been flaunting around lately., , • - ,
Last week, for example, he’.attacked the Administration’s
policy of not allowing U.S.-based Cuban revolutionaries to en
gage in aggression in Ihe Caribbean. His stand, unfortunately,
was ill-timed and ill-advised. The Republican leadership in Con
gress had already endorsed the Administration’s policy. And
Rockefeller himself had to side-step an embarrassing question:
Is it not un-Constitutional to permit foreigners to launch ag
gression from neutral U.S. territory?
Earlier this year, during the time of Britain’s unsuccessful
attempt to enter the Common Market, Rockefeller leveled an
other blast at Kennedy, holding him responsible for the split in
Anglo-American relations with France. The Administration, said
the governor, was trying to dictate excessively to our allies —
and, namely, to France.
Perhaps there might have been some truth to this. But
Rockefeller appeared as if he was supporting De Gaulle’s anti-
British action, and this was hardly a popular stand—as was evi
denced by the immense national and international criticism that
was heaped on De Gaulle.
Obviously, in these two issues of revolutionary activities and
Britain’s Common Market bid—issues on which Rockefeller has
laid considerable stress—the governor has shown that he is
desperately seeking ammunition for his 1964 campaign. And he
has failed miserably.
Rockefeller then, would do well to start looking for some
weighty issues that will hit home. And “home," according to
most political analysts, will most likely be the six big industrial
states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and
California—states where labor and minority groups are abun
dant, and where more than 160 electoral votes are at stake.
To woo voters here, Rocky should concentrate on civil rights
and economic issues.
Strong support of civil rights action is one of his biggest
potential bombshells, especially in the light of recent criticism
of Administrative “dawdling’ in this area. By taking such a
stand he would pick up a sizeable minority vote, while not alien
ating his support from most GOP regulars. Granted, he wouldn’t
enhance his opportunities in the South—but this area, for the
most part, is already conceded to Kennedy.
It is in the economic field that the governor is most open to
criticism. While on the stump lately he has been preaching “fis
cal economy.” And although the issue could be a powerful one
■ perhaps even among labor if there’s a bad recession before
the election—it is at present sheer hypocrisy for Rockefeller to
promote such a cause. His record as governor of New York in
dicates that he would be a high tax, high budget President.
His concept of government, as his aides will candidly admit,
is one of broad responsibility—and not too compatible with
“fiscal economy” in the sense he’s using it.
Today the governor is straddling two horses, and they’re
going in opposite directions. Rockefeller would do well to learn
a lesson from Richard Nixon’s experience; That image of hypoc
risy is a difficult one to reverse. The governor, then, should
either trim his own state budget or trim his political oratory.
Rockefeller will have an extremely difficult time of it if he
decides to run against Kennedy. He needn’t compound it any
further by floundering around in questionable, unpopular stands
on the foreign front and indulging in the double standard
on the domestic front.

proving that old political bromide—the one that says you can
always spot a Presidential hopeful by the number of times he
denies he’s running for office.
And, judging by the number of denials he’s made in the past
few months, Rocky is way out in front. As a matter of fact, the
poor man has had to travel all around the country trying to tell
people he’s really not running.
But whether he likes it or not, he has opened Presidential
season—and has paved the way for an endless barrage of advice
from pseudo pundits. Like me, for instance.
So-o-o, if the governor plans to seriously challenge Presi
dent Kennedy next year, he’d do well to junk some of the ludi
crous "issues” he’s been flaunting around lately., , • - ,
Last week, for example, he’.attacked the Administration’s
policy of not allowing U.S.-based Cuban revolutionaries to en
gage in aggression in Ihe Caribbean. His stand, unfortunately,
was ill-timed and ill-advised. The Republican leadership in Con
gress had already endorsed the Administration’s policy. And
Rockefeller himself had to side-step an embarrassing question:
Is it not un-Constitutional to permit foreigners to launch ag
gression from neutral U.S. territory?
Earlier this year, during the time of Britain’s unsuccessful
attempt to enter the Common Market, Rockefeller leveled an
other blast at Kennedy, holding him responsible for the split in
Anglo-American relations with France. The Administration, said
the governor, was trying to dictate excessively to our allies —
and, namely, to France.
Perhaps there might have been some truth to this. But
Rockefeller appeared as if he was supporting De Gaulle’s anti-
British action, and this was hardly a popular stand—as was evi
denced by the immense national and international criticism that
was heaped on De Gaulle.
Obviously, in these two issues of revolutionary activities and
Britain’s Common Market bid—issues on which Rockefeller has
laid considerable stress—the governor has shown that he is
desperately seeking ammunition for his 1964 campaign. And he
has failed miserably.
Rockefeller then, would do well to start looking for some
weighty issues that will hit home. And “home," according to
most political analysts, will most likely be the six big industrial
states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and
California—states where labor and minority groups are abun
dant, and where more than 160 electoral votes are at stake.
To woo voters here, Rocky should concentrate on civil rights
and economic issues.
Strong support of civil rights action is one of his biggest
potential bombshells, especially in the light of recent criticism
of Administrative “dawdling’ in this area. By taking such a
stand he would pick up a sizeable minority vote, while not alien
ating his support from most GOP regulars. Granted, he wouldn’t
enhance his opportunities in the South—but this area, for the
most part, is already conceded to Kennedy.
It is in the economic field that the governor is most open to
criticism. While on the stump lately he has been preaching “fis
cal economy.” And although the issue could be a powerful one
■ perhaps even among labor if there’s a bad recession before
the election—it is at present sheer hypocrisy for Rockefeller to
promote such a cause. His record as governor of New York in
dicates that he would be a high tax, high budget President.
His concept of government, as his aides will candidly admit,
is one of broad responsibility—and not too compatible with
“fiscal economy” in the sense he’s using it.
Today the governor is straddling two horses, and they’re
going in opposite directions. Rockefeller would do well to learn
a lesson from Richard Nixon’s experience; That image of hypoc
risy is a difficult one to reverse. The governor, then, should
either trim his own state budget or trim his political oratory.
Rockefeller will have an extremely difficult time of it if he
decides to run against Kennedy. He needn’t compound it any
further by floundering around in questionable, unpopular stands
on the foreign front and indulging in the double standard
on the domestic front.
Governor Nelson Rockefeller is doing an excellent job of
proving that old political bromide—the one that says you can
