# Theta Delt, Beta, Campus, Sigma Chi in Semi-Finals
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Still encroaching on the new
baseball season are a couple of
vestiges of last winter’s basket
ball competition. In Boston and
Los Angeles, the NBA champion
ship is being decided. And at Stan
ford, the University intramural
playoffs continue.
The intramural field has been
narrowed from 35 teams down to
four, and tonight the semi-final
games will be played in the Pa
vilion. At 7:30, Sigma Chi, the
defending champ, meets a group
of independents going under the
straight-forward ittle of Off Cam
pus. In the 8:30 game, Theta Delt,
last year’s runner-up, plays Beta.
It is quite possible that the
championship game, to be played
tomorrow night, will be a re
match of last year’s final round,
between Sigma Chi and Theta
Delt. However, this year the lat
ter would be expected to win.

Theta Delt not only has its en
tire first-string back but has
added four sophomores, two of
whom, Bob Strohecker and Terry
White, are now starters. Its pro
lific-scoring, race horse offense,
led by Munn Chin, John Wells,
and Steve King, is now comple
mented by a few set plays and a
tight defense.
SIGMA CHI, on the other hand,
lost three starters from last year,
but its steady, contx-ol offense is
still potent. It depends on outside
shooting by Nels Christensen,
Jim Shi’oyer, and Chuck Hudkins
and on xebounding by Chris Jes
sen.
Beta has the best chance to
prevent a Sigma Chi-Theta Delt
championship rematch. It has
great board strength from Pete
Rowe, Bob Drakulich, John Pat
terson, and Beau Bianchi, who
may he too much for Theta Delt,
a relatively small team. Patter
son is also a flashy if not unbe
lieveably accurate shooter.
Off Campus upset both Delt
and DU with consistent shooting
and aggressive defense. But it
lacks the size and probably the
overall talent to beat Sigma Chi.
