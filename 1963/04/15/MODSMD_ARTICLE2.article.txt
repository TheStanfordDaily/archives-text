### 
United Press International

COATESVILLE, Pa. Lukcns Steel Co. yesterday announced a
$5-$7 per ton price increase in steel plates, the second steel company
in less than a week to announce a price hike. Some observers con
sidered the present price boosts a test of the market as well as a
challenge to the Kennedy administration’s policy of wage and price
moderation. Other steel producers generally appeared to be waiting
to see what the “Big Steel” companies decide to do. It was believed
(hat if the industry generally docs not follow the example set by the
two smaller steel companies, they probably will have to back down.
Lukens is the nation’s third ranking producer of steel plate although
it is not considered one of the “Big Steel” companies in the industry.
U.S. Steel, the nation’s largest steel producer, said following yester
day’s Lukens price raise that it was standing on its statement last
week that it would have no comment on such increases until after
Easter. The White House reacted last night to the Lukens Steel
Company’s price rise announcement by renewing President Ken
nedy’s call for “overall price stability” in the industry.
