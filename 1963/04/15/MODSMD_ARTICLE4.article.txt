# 'Contact' Formed By IIR to Assist Foreign Students
## 
### 
“Contact,” the foreign student
pre-reg committee being launched
by the HR this week, is a new
program of orientation designed
for easing rather than merely
dropping foreign students into
the Stanford community.
Most of the new two hundred
foreign visitors expected to en
roll next fall have had little or no
previous contact with American
universities and American student
groups. These newcomers could
often use one willing and inter
ested friend to discuss problems
and open up channels of social
communication. With this in
mind, “Contact,” is attempting to
j pair each foreign student with an
I already matriculated Stanford
1 student who will act as his host
and companion for the first two
weeks of the fall quarter, and
who will, hopefully, remain a
close friend afterwards.
The Stanford students who are
to act as companions will be re
quired to attend a short series of
seminars during the next few
weeks, and will be given the name
of their contact so that, they can
correspond during the summer.
They will also return to partici
pate in the last two days of pre
reg week.
After this, it will be left to the
discretion of each individual to
decide what he can do, working
from a friendship basis, to best
help the foreign student get what
he wants from his Stanford ex
perience. Every attempt will be
made to pair persons of similar
j academic and social interests.
Although the program is open
to juniors and seniors, graduate
students are particularly urged
jto apply, since the foreign stu-
I dents fend to be older than most
| upperclassmen. Sign-ups for in
| terviews will be in the ASSU of
| fice from tomorrow through
Thursday, April 25.
