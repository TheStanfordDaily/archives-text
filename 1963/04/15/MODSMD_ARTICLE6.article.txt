# Oregon Edges Harriers, 74-71

### GLENN ALFORD 
Close but no cigar!
Stanford came close lo upsetting Oregon’s powerful track ma
chine Saturday, but the Ducks got clutch performances from Keith
Forman and their mile relay team, especially Ray Van Asten, and
edged the Tribe 74-71. The Indians trailed almost all through the

’•meet, and after 12 events were
behind 54-50. A rally in the triple
jump and intermediate hurdles
saw Stanford take a 67-55 lead.
But Oregon clutch performances
in the pole vault cut the lead to
68-63 with only the, two-mile and
relay remaining.

A Stanford win seemed immi
nent, since only a first in either
the two-mile or the mile relay
would clinch the triumph. A first
is worth five points, and 73 wins
the meet.
Stanford pinned its hopes in the
two-mile on Weym Kirkland and
Harry McCalla, while Oregon
countered with Keith Forman and
Archie San Romani. Stanford’s
Paul Schlicke was scratched with
a sore arch. Kirkland and McCal
la took the early lead, with the
Duck pair trailing about eight
yards behind. Forman was show
ing no ill effects from having run
a 4:00.1 mile earlier, fastest of
the 1963 outdoor season.
FINALLY THE Oregon pair
made its move and passed McCal
la. San Romani dropped back and
Froman stayed light on Kirk
land’s heels. The Stanford soph
tried to set a killing pace and let
the after-effects of the mile take
their toll, but Forman stayed with
him and out-kicked him in the
final 100 yards to win in 8:56.8.
Forman thus ran the fastest mile
two-mile double in collegiate his
tory. Kirkland ran magnificently
to finish in 8:58.2, fourth fastest
collegiate two-mile of the year.
