# Oregon Edges Harriers, 74-71
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Close but no cigar!
Stanford came close lo upsetting Oregon’s powerful track ma
chine Saturday, but the Ducks got clutch performances from Keith
Forman and their mile relay team, especially Ray Van Asten, and
edged the Tribe 74-71. The Indians trailed almost all through the

’•meet, and after 12 events were
behind 54-50. A rally in the triple
jump and intermediate hurdles
saw Stanford take a 67-55 lead.
But Oregon clutch performances
in the pole vault cut the lead to
68-63 with only the, two-mile and
relay remaining.

A Stanford win seemed immi
nent, since only a first in either
the two-mile or the mile relay
would clinch the triumph. A first
is worth five points, and 73 wins
the meet.
Stanford pinned its hopes in the
two-mile on Weym Kirkland and
Harry McCalla, while Oregon
countered with Keith Forman and
Archie San Romani. Stanford’s
Paul Schlicke was scratched with
a sore arch. Kirkland and McCal
la took the early lead, with the
Duck pair trailing about eight
yards behind. Forman was show
ing no ill effects from having run
a 4:00.1 mile earlier, fastest of
the 1963 outdoor season.
FINALLY THE Oregon pair
made its move and passed McCal
la. San Romani dropped back and
Froman stayed light on Kirk
land’s heels. The Stanford soph
tried to set a killing pace and let
the after-effects of the mile take
their toll, but Forman stayed with
him and out-kicked him in the
final 100 yards to win in 8:56.8.
Forman thus ran the fastest mile
two-mile double in collegiate his
tory. Kirkland ran magnificently
to finish in 8:58.2, fourth fastest
collegiate two-mile of the year.

STANFORD’S Larry Questad (second from right) upsets Dave Blunt
(left) of Oregon in the 100-yard dash in Saturday's track meet. Que stad's time of 9.5 seconds was the second fastest Stanford 100 time
i ever.
The relay, then, was to deride
the meet, as everyone had pre
dieted. Stanford had a best of
3:12, while Oregon was over six
seconds slower. The Tribe had
four fresh quarter-milers ready.
Oregon had to rely on a pair of
half-milcrs who hadn't competed
in the relay yet this year, Lewis
Powell and Ray Van Asten.
STANFORD TOOK a short lead
with Bob Mclntyre opposing A1
O’Leary, and the advantage was
widened when the Ducks had a
poor pass. Dale Meinert fell
quickly behind Phil Lamoreaux
in the second leg but made up the
lost ground with a tremendous
burst and actually gave Powell a
lead when he took the baton to
oppose Rich Chesarek, who had
won the 440 for Stanford.
Powell ran even with Chesarek
and took a lead going to the final
pass, to Van Asten. Chesarek’s
good pass to Ken Emanuels
sprung Stanford to a lead, and
Emanuels widened the margin to
seven yards after the first 220.
Van Asten started to creep up on
the backstretch and took the lead
as the runners entered the last
70 yards. Emanuels never quit
and ran a creditable 47.7, but Van
Asten couldn’t be caught.
Both Stanford and Oregon
trackmen had excellent perform
ances in leading up to the relay
drama.

Stove Cortright took 15 points
for the Indians with three wins.
He beat All-American high-hur
dler Mel Renfro in a personal best
of 14.3, led a Stanford sweep in
the intermediate hurdles in 37.4,
and won the triple jump in 47-5.
STANFORD showed promise of
three-way strength in the latter
two events. Phil Arnaudo was
second in the intermediates in
38.2, while John Groeling sped to
a 38.5 in beating Renfro for third
place. In the triple jump, Sheri
dan Downey was second, a foot
behind Cortright, and Russ Pe
terson outdid his best previous
mark by two feet in just missing
a third place.

As expected, Dave Weill romp
ed in the discus with a toss of
185-5, and Oregon's Dave Steen,
who was held out of the discus
with a bad elbow, still won his
specialty, the shot put.
Larry Questad was superb in
the sprints for Stanford. He ran
a 9.5 century to tie the meet rec
ord, and then completed his dou
ble win by taking the 220 in 21.4.
THE MILK WAS expected to
be the day’s best race, and it dis
appointed no one. Forman, who
is second-fastest collegiate miler
in history, won the race in close
to a sub-four-minute clocking. He
was given a 4:00.1 time. McCalla
likely became the fastest Negro
miler in history with his 4:01.5.

MeCalla took over the lead in
the second lap after Bob Miltz,
who acted as the rabbit in setting
a fast pace, tired. Forman stayed
with him until the pair just came
out of the turn for the last 70
yards. Forman turned on his kick
and won going away.

pass, to Van Asten. Chesarek’s
good pass to Ken Emanuels
sprung Stanford to a lead, and
Emanuels widened the margin to
seven yards after the first 220.
Van Asten started to creep up on
the backstretch and took the lead
as the runners entered the last
70 yards. Emanuels never quit
and ran a creditable 47.7, but Van
Asten couldn’t be caught.
Both Stanford and Oregon
trackmen had excellent perform
ances in leading up to the relay
drama.

Stove Cortright took 15 points
for the Indians with three wins.
He beat All-American high-hur
dler Mel Renfro in a personal best
of 14.3, led a Stanford sweep in
the intermediate hurdles in 37.4,
and won the triple jump in 47-5.
STANFORD showed promise of
three-way strength in the latter
two events. Phil Arnaudo was
second in the intermediates in
38.2, while John Groeling sped to
a 38.5 in beating Renfro for third
place. In the triple jump, Sheri
dan Downey was second, a foot
behind Cortright, and Russ Pe
terson outdid his best previous
mark by two feet in just missing
a third place.

As expected, Dave Weill romp
ed in the discus with a toss of
185-5, and Oregon's Dave Steen,
who was held out of the discus
with a bad elbow, still won his
specialty, the shot put.
Larry Questad was superb in
the sprints for Stanford. He ran
a 9.5 century to tie the meet rec
ord, and then completed his dou
ble win by taking the 220 in 21.4.
THE MILK WAS expected to
be the day’s best race, and it dis
appointed no one. Forman, who
is second-fastest collegiate miler
in history, won the race in close
to a sub-four-minute clocking. He
was given a 4:00.1 time. McCalla
likely became the fastest Negro
miler in history with his 4:01.5.

MeCalla took over the lead in
the second lap after Bob Miltz,
who acted as the rabbit in setting
a fast pace, tired. Forman stayed
with him until the pair just came
out of the turn for the last 70
yards. Forman turned on his kick
and won going away.

in the final stretch of the 880. Powell, in addition to turning in a
creditable 1:52, helped the Ducks win the mile relay.
Close but no cigar!
Stanford came close lo upsetting Oregon’s powerful track ma
chine Saturday, but the Ducks got clutch performances from Keith
Forman and their mile relay team, especially Ray Van Asten, and
edged the Tribe 74-71. The Indians trailed almost all through the

’•meet, and after 12 events were
behind 54-50. A rally in the triple

saw Stanford take a 67-55 lead.
But Oregon clutch performances
in the pole vault cut the lead to
68-63 with only the, two-mile and

A Stanford win seemed immi

the two-mile or the mile relay
would clinch the triumph. A first
is worth five points, and 73 wins
the meet.
Stanford pinned its hopes in the
two-mile on Weym Kirkland and
Harry McCalla, while Oregon
countered with Keith Forman and
Archie San Romani. Stanford’s
Paul Schlicke was scratched with
a sore arch. Kirkland and McCal

Duck pair trailing about eight
yards behind. Forman was show
ing no ill effects from having run
a 4:00.1 mile earlier, fastest of
the 1963 outdoor season.
FINALLY THE Oregon pair
made its move and passed McCal
la. San Romani dropped back and
Froman stayed light on Kirk
land’s heels. The Stanford soph
tried to set a killing pace and let
the after-effects of the mile take
their toll, but Forman stayed with
him and out-kicked him in the
final 100 yards to win in 8:56.8.
Forman thus ran the fastest mile
two-mile double in collegiate his

to finish in 8:58.2, fourth fastest
collegiate two-mile of the year.

saw Stanford take a 67-55 lead.
But Oregon clutch performances
in the pole vault cut the lead to
68-63 with only the, two-mile and
relay remaining.

A Stanford win seemed immi
nent, since only a first in either
the two-mile or the mile relay
would clinch the triumph. A first
is worth five points, and 73 wins
the meet.
Stanford pinned its hopes in the
two-mile on Weym Kirkland and
Harry McCalla, while Oregon
countered with Keith Forman and
Archie San Romani. Stanford’s
Paul Schlicke was scratched with
a sore arch. Kirkland and McCal
la took the early lead, with the
Duck pair trailing about eight
yards behind. Forman was show
ing no ill effects from having run
a 4:00.1 mile earlier, fastest of
the 1963 outdoor season.
FINALLY THE Oregon pair
made its move and passed McCal
la. San Romani dropped back and
Froman stayed light on Kirk
land’s heels. The Stanford soph
tried to set a killing pace and let
the after-effects of the mile take
their toll, but Forman stayed with
him and out-kicked him in the
final 100 yards to win in 8:56.8.
Forman thus ran the fastest mile
two-mile double in collegiate his
tory. Kirkland ran magnificently
to finish in 8:58.2, fourth fastest
collegiate two-mile of the year.

STANFORD’S Larry Questad (second from right) upsets Dave Blunt
(left) of Oregon in the 100-yard dash in Saturday's track meet. Que stad's time of 9.5 seconds was the second fastest Stanford 100 time
i ever.
The relay, then, was to deride
the meet, as everyone had pre
dieted. Stanford had a best of
3:12, while Oregon was over six
seconds slower. The Tribe had
four fresh quarter-milers ready.
Oregon had to rely on a pair of
half-milcrs who hadn't competed
in the relay yet this year, Lewis
Powell and Ray Van Asten.
STANFORD TOOK a short lead
with Bob Mclntyre opposing A1
O’Leary, and the advantage was
widened when the Ducks had a
poor pass. Dale Meinert fell
quickly behind Phil Lamoreaux
in the second leg but made up the
lost ground with a tremendous
burst and actually gave Powell a
lead when he took the baton to
oppose Rich Chesarek, who had
won the 440 for Stanford.
Powell ran even with Chesarek
and took a lead going to the final
pass, to Van Asten. Chesarek’s
good pass to Ken Emanuels
sprung Stanford to a lead, and
Emanuels widened the margin to
seven yards after the first 220.
Van Asten started to creep up on
the backstretch and took the lead
as the runners entered the last
70 yards. Emanuels never quit
and ran a creditable 47.7, but Van
Asten couldn’t be caught.
Both Stanford and Oregon
trackmen had excellent perform
ances in leading up to the relay
drama.

Stove Cortright took 15 points
for the Indians with three wins.
He beat All-American high-hur
dler Mel Renfro in a personal best
of 14.3, led a Stanford sweep in
the intermediate hurdles in 37.4,
and won the triple jump in 47-5.
STANFORD showed promise of
three-way strength in the latter
two events. Phil Arnaudo was
second in the intermediates in
38.2, while John Groeling sped to
a 38.5 in beating Renfro for third
place. In the triple jump, Sheri
dan Downey was second, a foot
behind Cortright, and Russ Pe
terson outdid his best previous
mark by two feet in just missing
a third place.

As expected, Dave Weill romp
ed in the discus with a toss of
185-5, and Oregon's Dave Steen,
who was held out of the discus
with a bad elbow, still won his
specialty, the shot put.
Larry Questad was superb in
the sprints for Stanford. He ran
a 9.5 century to tie the meet rec
ord, and then completed his dou
ble win by taking the 220 in 21.4.
THE MILK WAS expected to
be the day’s best race, and it dis
appointed no one. Forman, who
is second-fastest collegiate miler
in history, won the race in close
to a sub-four-minute clocking. He
was given a 4:00.1 time. McCalla
likely became the fastest Negro
miler in history with his 4:01.5.

MeCalla took over the lead in
the second lap after Bob Miltz,
who acted as the rabbit in setting
a fast pace, tired. Forman stayed
with him until the pair just came
out of the turn for the last 70
yards. Forman turned on his kick
and won going away.

Close but no cigar!
Stanford came close lo upsetting Oregon’s powerful track ma
chine Saturday, but the Ducks got clutch performances from Keith
Forman and their mile relay team, especially Ray Van Asten, and
edged the Tribe 74-71. The Indians trailed almost all through the

’•meet, and after 12 events were
