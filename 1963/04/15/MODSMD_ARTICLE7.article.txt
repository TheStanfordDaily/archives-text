# Cayce Will Speak On 'ESP' Trances
## 
### 
Hugh Lynn Cayce, son of the
phychic phnomena Edgar Cayce,
will discuss E.S.P. (extra-sensory
perception) and other related top
ics in Junipero Lounge of Wilbur
Hall today at 4:15 p.m.
Edgar Cayce had (he ability to
induce himself into a deep trance
in which he seemed to have access
to unlimited sources of informa
tion. Ho used this ability princi
pally for medical diagnosis.
Given the name and current loca
tion of an individual he was able
to diagnose illness and recom
mend treatment with repeated ac
curacy.
While under a trance, Cayce
once said that the source of his
vast supply of information was
his own unconscious mind. He de
scribed various levels of an in
dividual’s unconscious mind, con
ceiving of the universal uncon
scious as a river of thought flow
ing through eternity.
The indexing and organizing of
Edgar Cayce’s notes and docu
ments is currently being under
taken. Physicians, psychologists
and other professional people
have begun conducting research
in tlie Cayce files which are grad
ually coming to be considered an
invaluable source for all profes
sional fields.
