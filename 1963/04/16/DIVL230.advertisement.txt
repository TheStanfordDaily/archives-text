Being an old tennis
buff, we could never
figure the appellation
of “sneakers” for
these eminently com
fortable shoes. Be that
as it may, R/A has
’em, in the great Jack
Purcell model by
Goodrich PF, laced to
the toe, in traditional
white or soil-resistant
black. Great for active
sports or for sneaking
around the campus,
whatever is your
game. Sneak into a
pair today, a steal at
our price, but $8.95
the pr.
