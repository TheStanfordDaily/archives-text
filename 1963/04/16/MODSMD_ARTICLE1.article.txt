# Cotton Elected IIR President; Plans to Consolidate IIR Aims
## 
### VICKI NICOL 
Last night the Executive Board of the 118 elected Thomas A.
Cotton to succeed W . Scott Thompson in the presidency of the
118 hy a 30-16 vote. The JIB is the largest organization of its
kind in the country and the only student-run organization of its
type. Cotton is a sophomore from Dallas, Texas, the second soph
omore in I lie sixteen-year history*-

of the HR to be elected to this of
fice. He has been consistently on
the Dean's list and maintains a
3.8 grade point average in his
Electrical Engineering major.
Cotton's first contact with the
HR was last spring in relation to
tin* Helsinki Youth Festival. He
participated in the interviewing
for the delegates and was also a
delegate himself. This fall quar
ter ho was active in the Stanford
United Nations program and last
quarter and this quarter has
served as administrative assis
tant to Thompson. This summer
he will be a delegate to the Na
tional Student Association’s In
ternational Student Relations
Seminar in Philadelphia.
Cotton will take office later
this quarter. It is his ambition
to consolidate the many facets
of the HR into as compact and ef
ficiently running an organization
as possible. He means to concen
trate not so much on enlarging
the organization which has al
ready expanded by amazing pro
portions in the past year, as to
improve the programs already in
existence. He hopes to bring all
the programs in the organization
up to equal levels of efficacy.
“TEAMWORK and cooperation
should be the basis of our opera
tion for next year.” Cotton said.
He may be helped by the new
constitution which was also pass
ed last night in a meeting of the
HR policy board. This constitu
tion will go into effect when it is
passed by LASSU. It does not af
fect any policy changes but is for
the most part a reorganization
along functional lines. This new
constitution will contribute to the
consolidation of the organization.
"With the functional reorgani
zation of the HR provided by the
new constitution we will have a
great many opportunities open
for students with widely varied
interests. In the next two weeks
positions will be available in the
Foreign Student Pre-Reg and
“Contact” Programs, two of the
many HR efforts to integrate our
700 foreign students into the
Stanford community. •
“Those efforts form a basic
part of the entire HR program.
Our goal is to increase coopera
tion and understanding in the in
ternational student community
by sponsoring educational pro
grams for Stanford students, by
providing the finest foreign stu
dent program in the country, and
by giving valuable personal ex
perience to HR members.
“THK HR is a symptom of a
new interest and enthusiasm
among American students. It is
our job to sec that this interest
is furthered by all means possi
ble.
“The purpose of the HR,” Cot
ton explained, “is to develop a
commitment to international af
fairs among students which will
carry through to their activities
after they have left the Stanford
community. Cotton himself plans
to get a masters degree in en
gineering and then study econ
omics and eventually go into in
ternational technicalogical devel

opment, possibly in Africa.
Cotton will be busy all summer
keeping in close contact with the
other HR officers to organize the
programs for next fall.
