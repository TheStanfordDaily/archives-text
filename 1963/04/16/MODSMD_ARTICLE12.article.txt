## SSC: Answer to Trustees' Rules 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
As the dust created by last quarter’s hassle over student
rights settles about the new Trustee policy statement, two things
become apparent. First, while the University’s liberalized regu
lations acknowledge the right of students to speak collectively
on issues outside the campus, the new rules prohibit such ex
pression through ASSU organizatins, such as Legislature, al
though these already formed organizations are the obvious
bodies through which the right of student expression on public
issues might be implemented. Second, as a result, if students
wish to take public stands on public issues they will have to
form new organizations for this purpose. The Trustee policy has
dismantled the speakers platform once provided by LASSU, and
is forcing students to build a new one from scratch.
The initial student response was a meeting held at the re
quest of ASSU president Armin Rosencranz on April 3. The
forty-odd students present considered the formation of a volun
tary organization with the intent of discussing contemporary
issues outside the Stanford community and voicing opinions on
these issues. They selected the name “Stanford Student Con
gress" and asked Nick Wessell. former Daily Editor, to head the
organization until a permanent structure and function were
settled upon. Wessell, in turn, asked Jim Woolsey, Rhodes Schol
ar and assistant to the ASSU president, Chuck Bischoff, a stu
dent member of the Student Affairs and Services Committee,
Fred Goff, former NSA coordinator, and Barrie Thorne to help
him draw up plans for the organization.
Wessell and his committee proceeded to arrange the open
discussion of fallout shelters which was held last night in Tresid
der, hoping thereby to test some practical aspects of plans for
the Stanford Student Congress. At present these plans are hazy
and revolve around speculation as to 1) how the Student Con
gress will develop, and 2) how the Student Congress ought to
develop.
Those emphasizing ‘will’ are of the opinion that regardless
of how the Student Congress is organized, there will be a rela
tively small number of students who will continually participate
in. and therefore dominate, the deliberations of the body. Stress
ing this view, they feel that only those students planning to
participate extensively should become members of the Student
Congress. Proponents of this thesis believe that the smaller
group thus formed would develop a cohesion, spirit, and sense
of purpose and identity that would not appear in a larger group.
Those that emphasize ‘ought to’ believe that the Student
Congr ess should promote as well as provide for the expression of
student opinion on issues outside the University. They are of the
opinion that last quarter’s controversy over student rights came
about because of an increased interest of students in their role
as members of a world community. Stressing this view, they
feel that the Student Congress should actively support this in
creasing interest by encouraging any student even remotely in
terested in discussing issues outside the University to become a
member of the Stanford Student Congress. Proponents of this ap
proach believe that the larger group thus formed would promote
a degree of participation by the student body at large that would
not occur if the Student Congress were a smaller group.
The relative merits of the organizations that would result
from exclusive development along either of the above paths are
still being discussed, and certainly nothing precludes the for
mation of a voluntary organization, or voluntary organizations,
that would incorporate the strengths of both of the above lines
of development. However, such a possibility awaits a more
detailed consideration of the particulars involved, and the actual
application of these considerations to the peculiar Stanford mix
ture of a disempowered Legislature, a befuddled Political Union
and an observing Administration.
