## Federal Government: How Much? 
### JAMIE G. HUNTER DAVID FRENCH 
Stanford Delegates to the M.I.T. Conference
The dilemma of the space age is achieving a balance between
the overwhelming need for technological progress and the desir
ability of maintaining a free enterprise system, stated Dr. Julius
Adams Stratton, President of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, in his introductory speech to a student conference,
April 3-6, at M.I.T. on the role of the federal government in
economic control, scientific research and development, and labor
management relations. During four busy days delegates of all
political leanings from 32 colleges and universities listened to
eminent speakers, questioned panelists and adjourned to semi
nars for full discussion of the topics.
Noting that 45 per cent of M.l.T.’s budget comes from fed
eral research grants (78 per cent of total federal contribution),
Dr. Stratton concluded that there is no road back from govern
ment participation in research, and urged delegates to start
from that premise and consider ways in which the government
can channel grants to be the least disruptive of the goals of the
recipient universities.
Other speakers on the topic of the government’s role in
scientific research and development were William Baker, head
of Bell Telephone Laboratories, and Jerome Weisner, President
Kennedy’s special assistant for science and technology. The
difference of viewpoints between a head of a private enterprise
laboratory and a presidential adviser never developed fully as
Baker was too aloof and Weisner too reserved.
The most interesting of the seminars on this topic focused
on the impact of government grants upon student-faculty rela
tionships. There was a great contrast between the attitudes of
delegates from M.I.T. where almost all the faculty are receiv
ing federal support, which commits them to extensive research,
and Reed, which has refused all federal support conditioned
upon the signing of disclaimer affidavits, leaving the faculty
more time to be spent with their students. Part of this differ
ence is undoubtedly due to the presence of graduate students
at M.I.T. and their absence at Reed.
The speakers on the government’s role in economic control
were Professors Abba Lerner and Paul McCracken, former
Eisenhower adviser. Panelists included M.I.T. professors Paul
Samuelson (Economics) and Ithel Pool (Political Science). Sur
prisingly, there was substantial agreement that the President
needed moie flexible tools to deal with an impending recession.
McCracken noted that “all recessions seems to begin when
Congress adjourns,” making new legislation impossible when
it is most needed. Political scientist Ithel Pool advised the
economists to stop blaming public ignorance of basic economics
concepts, (such as the difference between a household and a
government budget) for the failure of Congress to adopt “en
lightened” economic regulation, and urged them to assume a
more active role in forming public opinion.
The most fruitful topic of the entire conference was the
role of the government in labor-management relations. Profes
sor George Schultz, an adviser to both Eisenhower and Kennedy,
said that collective bargaining was a success in this country to
day as only 0.16 per cent of working time is lost due to strikes.
He criticized former Secretary of Labor Goldberg for damaging
the basic framework of private collective bargaining by doing
"too much too soon.” The clearest example of this was his settle
ment of the New York opera strike which was not a national
emergency, notwithstanding, he said, the first lady’s love for
music. Schultz spoke at length on the problems of relocating and
retraining the unemployed. He criticized the Manpower Retrain
ing Program for helping only those who least need help in order
to compile a “good record" showing a high percentage employed
of those retrained.
The other speaker on this topic was Saul Wallen, who is
currently the government mediator in the Boeing dispute. Wallen
criticized the overuse of “national emergency” provisions of the
Taft-Hartley and Railway Labor Acts by both Eisenhower and
Kennedy, in strikes which posed no real public danger. He stated
that the public frequently overestimates the secondary effects of
a strike, noting that during the recent New York newspaper
strike theater attendance increased 11 per cent. He concluded
that government should avoid intervention wherever possible,
and should make more imaginative recommendations when it
does get involved.
In response to questions about the dispute between Roger
Blough and President Kennedy, both Schultz and Wallen agreed
that Kennedy had demonstrated a lack of confidence in the
free enterprise system. Wallen believed that the steel market
was soft at the time of the price increase by U.S. Steel, and this
would have forced Blough to lower prices within a few months
anyway, making Kennedy's television show quite unnecessary.
At a concluding session. Don K. Price observed “How much
federal government? 1 don’t think anyone really cares how
much.” The dean of Harvard University’s School of Public Ad
ministration asserted rather that the concern of the delegates
correctly lay in a pragmatic study of solutions to specific
problems. Government action was simply one among many ap
proaches to these problems.
This distrust of the doctrinaire pervaded the conference
throughout. Delegates reacted little to the idea of government
involvement as such; ultimately their response to the confer
ence’s central “How Much?” was—"Enough.”
