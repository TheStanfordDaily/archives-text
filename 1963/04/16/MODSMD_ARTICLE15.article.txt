Editors, The Daily:
As one of four Stanford Area Young Republicans (others:
Jim Sensenbrenner, Barbara Westerlund, and Barbara Herwig)
present as guests at the Credentials Committee meeting of the
California Young Republican College Federation Convention, I
do not recall seeing Michael J. Matheson (ordinary member, not
vice-president; his resignation was asked for and received
months agoi present at any time during the Committee meeting.
Therefore, as a first-hand witness, I would like to clarify a few
facts that Mr. Matheson missed in his second- or third-hand
account.
It was not a Fresno policeman who first pushed Robert
Gaston, President of the California Young Republicans, but
rather it was a college student whose delegate badge indicated
he was from Redlands University. There were six additional
white-shirted “gentlemen” who stood at the door and admitted
or rejected people according to whether or not the white pass
was presented.
After Jim Sensenbrenner had a fifteen-second conference
with Richard Noble, delegate to the committee, Hal Phillips said
to one of the “gentlemen” in a voice loud enough for those on
that side of the room to hear, “Don’t let him get out of his seat,”
and pointed to Jim. Immediately thereafter, this gentleman
walked over and stood by Jim. Jim had a folder full of evidence
which, if presented, would display grave irregularities in the
delegation from Foothill College. This delegation was com
mitted to the Phillips-Siefkin slate. Only Mr. Noble, the dele
gate, could present this information to the committee. Had the
issue come up before the committee broke up, these facts
would have never reached the floor.
From my observations as a delegate to the convention. Mr.
Weinig’s summary of events is quite correct. I am certain that
most of the seventeen-person delegation would agree whole
heartedly with me on that point.

Having attended Mr. Heiskell’s address last Thursday after
noon in Trosidder Union, I do not believe The Daily gave a full
and objective report of his remarks in its front page article of
April 12. It is true that Mr. Heiskell said “One way or the other
we have to remove Castro.” However, he went on to define
exactly what he meant by “one way or the other.” He suggested
the following two alternatives: 1) the United States’ “dirty
works department” (this was his term) should assassinate
Castro; 2> the United States should enforce a complete em
bargo on all oil to Cuba. Mr. Heiskell was then asked if he
thought a United States invasion of Cuba would alienate any
group of people in Latin America. His answer was: “I can’t
think of any.”
For me, these comments constituted some of the major
Points of his address. Because they involve important policy
decisions by our country towards Cuba, I think they would have
been of much interest to all Stanford students arid should not
have been omitted from The Daily’s report.

present as guests at the Credentials Committee meeting of the
California Young Republican College Federation Convention, I
do not recall seeing Michael J. Matheson (ordinary member, not
vice-president; his resignation was asked for and received
months agoi present at any time during the Committee meeting.
Therefore, as a first-hand witness, I would like to clarify a few
facts that Mr. Matheson missed in his second- or third-hand
account.
It was not a Fresno policeman who first pushed Robert
Gaston, President of the California Young Republicans, but
rather it was a college student whose delegate badge indicated
he was from Redlands University. There were six additional
white-shirted “gentlemen” who stood at the door and admitted
or rejected people according to whether or not the white pass
was presented.
After Jim Sensenbrenner had a fifteen-second conference
with Richard Noble, delegate to the committee, Hal Phillips said
to one of the “gentlemen” in a voice loud enough for those on
that side of the room to hear, “Don’t let him get out of his seat,”
and pointed to Jim. Immediately thereafter, this gentleman
walked over and stood by Jim. Jim had a folder full of evidence
which, if presented, would display grave irregularities in the
delegation from Foothill College. This delegation was com
mitted to the Phillips-Siefkin slate. Only Mr. Noble, the dele
gate, could present this information to the committee. Had the
issue come up before the committee broke up, these facts
would have never reached the floor.
From my observations as a delegate to the convention. Mr.
Weinig’s summary of events is quite correct. I am certain that
most of the seventeen-person delegation would agree whole
heartedly with me on that point.

Having attended Mr. Heiskell’s address last Thursday after
noon in Trosidder Union, I do not believe The Daily gave a full
and objective report of his remarks in its front page article of
April 12. It is true that Mr. Heiskell said “One way or the other
we have to remove Castro.” However, he went on to define
exactly what he meant by “one way or the other.” He suggested
the following two alternatives: 1) the United States’ “dirty
works department” (this was his term) should assassinate
Castro; 2> the United States should enforce a complete em
bargo on all oil to Cuba. Mr. Heiskell was then asked if he
thought a United States invasion of Cuba would alienate any
group of people in Latin America. His answer was: “I can’t
think of any.”
For me, these comments constituted some of the major
Points of his address. Because they involve important policy
decisions by our country towards Cuba, I think they would have
been of much interest to all Stanford students arid should not
have been omitted from The Daily’s report.
