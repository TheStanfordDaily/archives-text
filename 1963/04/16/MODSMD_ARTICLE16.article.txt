## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Sigma Chi and Theta Delt both
gained entrance to the intramural
basketball championship round
by scoring nine-point wins in
their semi-final games last night
in the Pavilion. The champion
ship game will thus be a re
match of last year’s Sigma Chi-
Theta Delt playoff, won by Sig
ma Chi.
SIGMA nil won the first
game, beating Off Campus, 46-37,
after the independents led and
actually controlled the game for
the first 2a minutes. Led by var
sity tennis player John Burt, Off
Campus played nearly perfect
basketball to run up a lead of
25-13 near the end of the first
half. At that point they had miss
ed only six of 15 field goal at
tempts, one of eight free throws,
and had made very few ball con

trol errors. Burt had shattered
Sigma Chi’s defense for 14 points.
But the law of averages soon
caught up to the independents.
Nels Christensen hit a jumper
and Chuck Hudkins scored a fast
break three-pointer for Sigma
Chi to make the half time score
25-18. In the second half, Off
Campus continually lost the ball
on missed shots and careless
passing; Sigma Chi methodically
caught up, mainly on Christen
sen's outside shooting.
IT WAS TIKI) finally, at 30-30
with 13 minutes left. Four bas
kets were traded and Sigma Chi
went ahead to stay, 36-34, on
Gary Sargent’s jumper. Sigma
Chi’s superior rebounding and
consistent shooting widened the
margin to 46-37, the final score,
but one felt that had the game
lasted longer, they would have
continued to pull farther away.
Burt was high scorer with 21,
while Christensen lead Sigma
Chi with 17; Hudkins had 13 and
Sargent nine.
The second game saw Theta
Delt’s all-out hustle and aggres
siveness and adequate outside
shooting offset Beta’s tremen
dous heighth and strength ad
vantage and end in a 44-35 win.
Beta’s shooting was off the entire
game, many of its attempts fail
ing even to hit the rim. But its
biggest disappointment was its
failure to utilize its offensive re
bounding opportunities.
MEANWHILE, Theta Delt
shook off some early cold shoot
ing and got its fast break going
to withstand a Beta rally which
closed the margin from eight to
two points (16-14), and moved to
a 22-16, half score. Two fast
break baskets and Steve King's
jumper made it 28-16 three min
utes into the second half and
Theta Delt maintained an 11-13
point lead thereafter.
Bob Strohecker led them with
12 points, while King, John Wells.
Dave Hisey, Charles Burke, and
Terry White all scored at the 6-8
point level. Pete Rowe had 13
for Beta.

with 13 minutes left. Four bas
kets were traded and Sigma Chi
went ahead to stay, 36-34, on
Gary Sargent’s jumper. Sigma
Chi’s superior rebounding and
consistent shooting widened the
margin to 46-37, the final score,
but one felt that had the game
lasted longer, they would have
continued to pull farther away.
Burt was high scorer with 21,
while Christensen lead Sigma
Chi with 17; Hudkins had 13 and
Sargent nine.
The second game saw Theta
Delt’s all-out hustle and aggres
siveness and adequate outside
shooting offset Beta’s tremen
dous heighth and strength ad
vantage and end in a 44-35 win.
Beta’s shooting was off the entire
game, many of its attempts fail
ing even to hit the rim. But its
biggest disappointment was its
failure to utilize its offensive re
bounding opportunities.
MEANWHILE, Theta Delt
shook off some early cold shoot
ing and got its fast break going
to withstand a Beta rally which
closed the margin from eight to
two points (16-14), and moved to
a 22-16, half score. Two fast
break baskets and Steve King's
jumper made it 28-16 three min
utes into the second half and
Theta Delt maintained an 11-13
point lead thereafter.
Bob Strohecker led them with
12 points, while King, John Wells.
Dave Hisey, Charles Burke, and
Terry White all scored at the 6-8
point level. Pete Rowe had 13

Theta Delt playoff, won by Sig

Campus played nearly perfect
basketball to run up a lead of
25-13 near the end of the first
half. At that point they had miss
ed only six of 15 field goal at
tempts, one of eight free throws,
and had made very few ball con

trol errors. Burt had shattered
Sigma Chi’s defense for 14 points.
But the law of averages soon
caught up to the independents.
Nels Christensen hit a jumper
and Chuck Hudkins scored a fast
break three-pointer for Sigma
Chi to make the half time score
25-18. In the second half, Off

caught up, mainly on Christen
