# Cal Crew Tops Tribe Bui Frosh Manage Win
## 
### 
A smooth stroking Cal crew
showed Saturday that Stanford
still has a ways to go in building
up enough talent to heat the
Bears, as they easily defeated the
Indian varsity in the Big Row by
two and a half lengths on the
Oakland Estuary.
However, the Stanford fresh
men drew praise from the many
onlookers as they won a thriller
from the Cal yearlings by a quar
ter of a length. It was the first
time any Stanford boat had beat
en Cal since 1960 (the frosh flirt
it then, too).
ROWING OFF to a quick half
length lead, the frosh maintained
that margin almost all the way.
In the final 200 meters, Cal
sprinted and gained on the In
dians. Just as the Tribe was an
swering the challenge with a
sprint of its own, (he number
seven Cal rower caught a crab
(his oar stuck in the water) and
it slowed the Cubs down. Stan
ford won in thr* respectable time
of 6:17.2.
In the varsity race the Cal
shell pulled away steadily
throughout the race, leading by
about a boat-length at the half
way mark. The Bears finished the
2000 meters in 5:58.2, while Stan
ford had a 6:08.8 time.
COACH Conn Findley and for
mer coach Lou Lindsey were
hard put to determine why the
Indian varsity rowed poorly.

Findley said his oarsmen hart
rowed better in practice last
week, but that their overall ap
pearance Saturday was still im
pressive. Number five oarsman,
John Edmunds, mentioned that
Stanford had trouble spacing its
strokes during the race, an indi
cation that power may have been
lacking. Said the Cal coach,
“Stanford wasn’t as rough as we
thought they were going to be.”
Cal effortlessly rowed at a 32-
strokes-per-mlnute rate for al
most the entire distance. Stan
ford tried for the same rate, but
slowly inched up to a 34-35 count.
The Cal junior varsity shell
took nearly a one-length lead at
midway, and pulled away from
Stanford for a two-length victory
in 6:35.
IT WAS THE sixth straight
varsity Big Row win for Califor
nia. In three weeks they will
meet Washington, perennial West
Coast rowing power, in a race
that should determine the best
Coast team.
Findley and Ed Ferry, varsity
stroke man, leave this week for
the Pan American Games, in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, where they will
compete in the pair-oared race.
