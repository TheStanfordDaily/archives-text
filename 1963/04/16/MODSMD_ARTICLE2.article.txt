# Focus Talk OK's Use Of Strike
## 
### RON DEFELICE 
The right to strike was defend
ed yesterday afternoon as ‘‘some
thing which has always charac
terized a democracy,” by Univer
sity of Wisconsin Law Professor
Nathan P. Feinsinger in Ins key
note address to Political Union’s
Focus 1963.
Speaking on “Changing Con
cepts of the Public Interest in
Labor-Management Relations,”
Feinsinger traced the develop
ment of the right to strike.
Before the 1930’5, he said, the
concept of public interest was
the classic laissez-faire approach.
Under the Sherman and Clay
Acts, management and labor em
ployed a policy of “dog-eat-dog
or, more appropriately, of lion
eat-mouse.” Such a situation, said
Feinsinger, could not last in a
country where people “would not
allow themselves to be pushed
around.”
THE FIRST significant change
in this attitude was the Norris-
La Guardia Act of 1932, which
took labor disputes out of the
hands of the courts. In 1935, Con
gress passed the Wagner Act,

compelling employers to recog
nize and bargain collectively with
unions. The act defined collective
bargaining as an agreement, be-1
tween an employer and a recog
nized union, arrived at without a
strike. The act, however, did not
outlaw strikes, Feinsinger noted.
Today the concept of public in
terest ranges from advocating
government arbitration of labor
disputes to advocating a return
of laissez-faire. Feinsinger at-!
tacked both views as “oversim-1
plifications” and “gimmicks.”
Collective bargaining, he con-1
tends, is still the best solution to
labor disputes.
Feinsinger advocated what he I
called “creative bargaining.” ]
Such bargaining not only avoids j
strikes but also creates new ap
proaches to labor settlements. l
Feinsinger cited as the classic ex- j
ample of creative bargaining the j
contract between General Mo-1
tors and the United Auto Work- i
ers providing for pay increases j
as the cost of living rises.
CREATIVE bargaining, the
"highest level” of collective bar
gaining, is possible only when
management fully accepts un
ions. Other examples of creative
bargaining cited by Feinsinger
are the Armour Committee on
Automation, the Kaiser Study of
Profit-Sharing and the General
Motors Human Relations Com-1
rnittee.

The Focus program continues
today at 3:15 p.m. in Tresidder
Union with talks open to seminar
participants only. The talks, to
be given by Economics Professor
John G. Gurley and Business
School Professor John P. Troxell,
will be followed by seminars at
4:15 p.m. The program concludes
tomorrow with a panel discus
sion on Government, Business
and Labor at 7:45 p.m. in Me

tomorrow with a panel discus
sion on Government, Business
and Labor at 7:45 p.m. in Me
morial Auditorium.
The right to strike was defend
ed yesterday afternoon as ‘‘some
thing which has always charac
terized a democracy,” by Univer
sity of Wisconsin Law Professor
Nathan P. Feinsinger in Ins key
note address to Political Union’s
Focus 1963.
Speaking on “Changing Con
cepts of the Public Interest in
Labor-Management Relations,”
Feinsinger traced the develop
ment of the right to strike.
Before the 1930’5, he said, the
concept of public interest was
the classic laissez-faire approach.
Under the Sherman and Clay
Acts, management and labor em
ployed a policy of “dog-eat-dog
or, more appropriately, of lion
eat-mouse.” Such a situation, said
Feinsinger, could not last in a
country where people “would not
allow themselves to be pushed
around.”
THE FIRST significant change
in this attitude was the Norris-
La Guardia Act of 1932, which
took labor disputes out of the
hands of the courts. In 1935, Con
gress passed the Wagner Act,

compelling employers to recog
nize and bargain collectively with
unions. The act defined collective
bargaining as an agreement, be-1
tween an employer and a recog
nized union, arrived at without a
strike. The act, however, did not
outlaw strikes, Feinsinger noted.
Today the concept of public in
terest ranges from advocating
government arbitration of labor
disputes to advocating a return
of laissez-faire. Feinsinger at-!
tacked both views as “oversim-1
plifications” and “gimmicks.”
Collective bargaining, he con-1
tends, is still the best solution to
labor disputes.
Feinsinger advocated what he I
called “creative bargaining.” ]
Such bargaining not only avoids j
strikes but also creates new ap
proaches to labor settlements. l
Feinsinger cited as the classic ex- j
ample of creative bargaining the j
contract between General Mo-1
tors and the United Auto Work- i
ers providing for pay increases j
as the cost of living rises.
CREATIVE bargaining, the
"highest level” of collective bar
gaining, is possible only when
management fully accepts un
ions. Other examples of creative
bargaining cited by Feinsinger
are the Armour Committee on
Automation, the Kaiser Study of
Profit-Sharing and the General
Motors Human Relations Com-1
rnittee.

The Focus program continues
today at 3:15 p.m. in Tresidder
Union with talks open to seminar
participants only. The talks, to
be given by Economics Professor
John G. Gurley and Business
School Professor John P. Troxell,
will be followed by seminars at
4:15 p.m. The program concludes
tomorrow with a panel discus
sion on Government, Business
and Labor at 7:45 p.m. in Me
morial Auditorium.
