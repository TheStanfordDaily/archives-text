# West Vancouver Prevails, 88-86
## 
### ANDREW MA 
It was one of those unbearably
exciting games that went right
down to the wire. The West Van
couver XI. a powerful and well
balanced side, had already won
all I heir matches against other
combined sides around the Pe
ninsula and now Stanford chal
lenged them unassisted.
Winning the toss, skipper
Cthanjoo -elected to field first
since light drizzles earlier made
the pitch more advantageous for
the bowlers. In absence of Mi
chael English, Andrew Ma had to
shoulder the burden of the at
tack and soon had the batsmen
waving and lunging at his deliv
eries. Keen fielding kept the runs
down and well-made catches by
Elmo Perera, Clifford Severn,
and Charles Wong kept the oppo
sition to their lowest total. 88
runs. Ma finished with five wick
ets for a meager 21 runs, the best
figures of the game.
As in the past Clifford Severn

gave Stanford a magnificent
start with a delightful 37, high
for the game. Perera and Severn
also joined in the onslaught. Vic
tory was in sight when the first
four wickets put in GO odd runs.
However that was not to be. A
sudden burst of rain and some
bad running between wickets
combined to swing the advantage
to the opposition.
