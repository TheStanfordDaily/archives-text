# CELTICS LOSK HAVLICER
## 
### 
The Boston Celtics, admittedly
lucky to win the opener of their
best of seven title playoffs with
the Los Angeles Lakers, have
paid a high price for the victory.

John Havlicek, their pri/e rookie
from Ohio State, suffered a se
vere ankle sprain in the game.
Havlicek, who plays both forward
and guard, may he out until the
fifth game.
