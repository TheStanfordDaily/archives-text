# Foreign Policy Institute Conference investigates Sino-Soviet Conflict

‘‘The Impact of the Sino-Soviet
Conflict on U.S. Foreign Policy”
will be the topic of the 6th An
nual Foreign Policy Institute of
the HR. The conference, which
will be held from May 20 to 22,
will center around four main
speakers, to be announced later,
who arc well-known experts on
U.S. foreign policy.
Seminars, which will concen
trate on different aspects of the
main topic, will be held for stu
dents who want a deeper under
standing of the issues involved in
the Sino-Soviet conflict. To avoid
a classroom atmosphere, the sem
inars will be led by grad students
of the political science depart
ment.
In last year’s conference, semi
nars met following the speeches,
discussed the issues in depth, and
formed resolutions to present to
the other participants. At a final
meeting the resolutions were de
bated and voted on by the partici
pants.
The main speeches will prob
ably be open to the general pub
lic, but those who wish to attend
a seminar become “participants”
by joining the Institute and pay
ing an admittance fee. Partici
pants will be able to attend all

the institute functions and will
receive background information
about the main topic.
Because the Institute’s purpose
is to emphasize and investigate
new trends in American foreign
policy, the conference will stress
the impact of the conflict on the
U.S. rather than the technicali
ties of the conflict itself.
Since its founding in the spring
of 1958. the Institute has pre
sented five successful confer
ences. Keynote speakers in pre
vious years have been James
Reston, Gardiner Patterson, W.
Averill Harriman. and Ralph
Bunche. Last year, Christian Her
ter led the conference on the top
ic of peaceful coexistence.
The major complaint about the
Institute was that it was too
broad and general. Last year’s
conference and this year’s have
remedied Ihese faults by center
ing the conference on a theme
discussed by more than one ex
pert rather than on a topic pre
sented by an individual speaker.
Students who wish to study the
issue more deeply may partici
pate in organized seminars, sep
arating them from those who are
interested only in a general back
ground on the problem of the
Sino-Soviet conflict.
