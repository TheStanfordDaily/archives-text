# Restrictive Cultural Policy Stifles Soviet Poet, Evtushenko
## 
### DR. IRENE BLUMENTHAL 
The visit of the Soviet poet, E.
Evtushenko, has fallen victim to
(he increasingly restrictive policy
by the Soviet Union in the cul
tural field. We are witnessing at
present one of the re-occurring
attempts by the Party and gov
ernmental authorities in the
USSR to re integrate the cultural
activities of its most, creative
minds into the organizational
system which, under the guid
ance of the Party, shapes the life
of the Soviet people.
Since Stalinâ€™s death, or more
precisely since the big thaw of
19.16, these attempts at greater
regimentation have alternated
with periods of greater liberaliza
tion.
Although political considera
tions have undoubtedly played a
major part in the recent Soviet
decision to obtain full control of
the cultural sector, there was an
other factor which has strength
ened this tendency. The Soviet
people, by Western standards,
are very conservative in their
taste and many of them are gen
uinely outraged by new forms of
art and the expression of new
ideas. Thus the politically orient
ed conservative forces have
found allies among people who
genuinely dislike and distrust the
work of the new generation of
artists and intellectuals in the
USSR.
THE CASE of Evtushenko and
many of his colleagues is made
more difficult by the tact that
they are members of a society
which requires that everybody
should play a useful part in
working with his fellow men
towards the social and political
goals outlined by the Party. Thus,
other than in Western society, it
is very difficult for an artist or
intellectual to remove himself to

neutral or apolitical territory.
Evtushenko cannot be accused
of such tendencies, but he has
made (he mistake in the eyes of
the authorities to transgress into
spheres which are not acceptable
for Soviet artists. In particular,
lie laid himself open to criticism
by rather free and easy associa
tion with Western intellectuals
and writers. Undoubtedly his de
cision to make available a manu
script to the French press which
was not approved for publication
in the USSR has placed him in a
precarious position.
Although he is a member of
the young generation, he is old
enough to have witnessed in his
youth the persecution of non-con
formist elements in Soviet soci
ety who were convicted because
they had associated with foreign
ers.
I THINK that we should be en
couraged by the fact that not
only Evtushenko hut other intel
lectuals and artists are holding
their ground in the face of very
heavy attacks by the conserva
tive forces among their col
leagues and by the regular Party
leadership. Times have changed
and Soviet present-day leader
ship can no longer crush the cre
ative spirit of their best minds
without doing serious harm to
the creative abilities of their
people in other areas.
On the other hand, we ought
to appreciate that the USSR is
facing a real dilemma. The men
in power seem to be aware that
cultural and intellectual activi
ties need to be given room in a
progressively developing society.
But they do not want to offer
the world the wastelands of the
Stalin era because they do not
dare to leave the sphere of intel
lectual endeavors and art without
strict control for fear that it
holds the seed that could grow
to destroy their power.
