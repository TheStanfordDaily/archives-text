# Charismatic Revivalist Rev. Bennett To Lecture on 'Speaking in Tongues'
## 
### 
Bev. Dennis J. Bennett, an Episcopal priest from Seattle, will
speak on the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues in a speech at
Tresiclder Union tomorrow at 7:45 p.m.
father Bennett is closely associated with the charismatic re
vival in the Episcopal church. Three years ago, he and the

•members of his congregation at
Van Nuys, California, received a
“Baptism in the Holy Spirit” that
caused great interest and result
ed in world wide publicity.
Many of the congregation,
however, did not take kindly to
the new experience, and he was
transferred to a mission in Se
attle. He has increased the at
tendance five fold at his new
post.
BENNETT BELIEVES that
"something is wrong with the
Christian church; that the world
is not being won for Jesus
Christ.” He was dissatisfied with
his own spiritual condition until
he met an Episcopal couple who
introduced him to the Baptism of
the Holy Spirit.
Ho compares the experience he
received to that of pow'er being
turned on in a new house: the
house has all it appliances but it
needs the power to make them
operate.
Speaking in tongues is not a
group experience, according to
Bennett. Far from being a mode
of mass hysteria, it can occur in
complete isolation.
THE REACTIONS to the "char
ismatic revival” have been varied.
Dr. P. E. Hughes, editor of "The
Churchman,” an Anglican quar
terly, has written that “This re
vival is transforming lives. It is
revitalizing churches.” Other
churchmen have panned the
movement, particularly when ex
amples occur such as the 60 stu
dents at Yale who reportedly be
came “filled with the Spirit.”
Professor Robert McAfee
Brown of Stanford believes that
this movement, like all move
ments within the church, con
tains resources for both good and
evil. It is too early to predict
which way it will lead the church.
