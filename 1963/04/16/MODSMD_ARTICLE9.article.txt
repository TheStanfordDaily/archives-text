# Conservative, Pacifist Debate Shelter Merits
## 
### PELL FENDER 
Last night the Stanford Student Congress sponsored a debate
on the topic of fallout shelters at Stanford.
Arguing for the shelters was Dick Wei nig, "noted (in the
words of Nils Wessel) Bay Area conservative,” and against, Ira
Sandperl, noted Bay Area pacifist. Preceding the debate, Mr.

Robert Beyer, of the Stanford-
News Service, gave a short talk
recounting the facts pertaining
to the Stanford policy, Stanford’s
shelters, and the effects of a nu
clear blast.

In his talk, Beyer emphasized
three facts about Stanford’s shel
ters: our shelters protect us only
against fallout, the shelters
would not exist after an attack
on San Francisco or its proximi
ty, and, that the shelters were
“low-budget protection.”
BOTH SPEAKERS talked for
fifteen minutes. Weinig, based
his support of the shelters on two
arguments: (1) through shelters
and other defense measures
against a nuclear attack, the
United States, while assuring the
USSR that it is not about to at
tack, shows that it is prepared
to retaliate, and (2) should the
USSR attack, the shelters would
provide actual protection.
With “has the immense jour
ney into the light come to an
end?” Mr Sandperl started his
argument, basing his opposition
to the shelters on the Ghandian
precept, “you must speak for
man.”
“In the past,” Sandperl con
tinued, “war and preparations for
war have always led to war. The
ends do not justify the means
(fallout shelters); they become
moans in themselves.” Sandperl
closed with the plea that man
will realize that the people in
Peking or Moscow are brothers
to all men, and that no one has
the right to take a human life.
WEINIG PRECEDED Sand
perl in the five-minute rebuttal
period allowed to each. “I’m not
here speaking for a political par
ty or ideology,” said Weinig,
“ . . . but for the freedom for
man to come and go by himself.
In order to carry out a policy of
Christian love,” said Weinig, “we
must fight Communism by being
prepared to fight a war.”
“There is away of love,” said
Sandperl in his rebuttal, “and it’s
not through burning 200,000 peo
ple, as we did in Hiroshima.” In
stead, insisted Sandperl, we can
invoke the Ghandian principle of
non-violence.

BOTH SPEAKERS talked for
fifteen minutes. Weinig, based
his support of the shelters on two
arguments: (1) through shelters
and other defense measures
against a nuclear attack, the
United States, while assuring the
USSR that it is not about to at
tack, shows that it is prepared
to retaliate, and (2) should the
USSR attack, the shelters would
provide actual protection.
With “has the immense jour
ney into the light come to an
end?” Mr Sandperl started his
argument, basing his opposition
to the shelters on the Ghandian
precept, “you must speak for
man.”
“In the past,” Sandperl con
tinued, “war and preparations for
war have always led to war. The
ends do not justify the means
(fallout shelters); they become
moans in themselves.” Sandperl
closed with the plea that man
will realize that the people in
Peking or Moscow are brothers
to all men, and that no one has
the right to take a human life.
WEINIG PRECEDED Sand
perl in the five-minute rebuttal
period allowed to each. “I’m not
here speaking for a political par
ty or ideology,” said Weinig,
“ . . . but for the freedom for
man to come and go by himself.
In order to carry out a policy of
Christian love,” said Weinig, “we
must fight Communism by being
prepared to fight a war.”
“There is away of love,” said
Sandperl in his rebuttal, “and it’s
not through burning 200,000 peo
ple, as we did in Hiroshima.” In
stead, insisted Sandperl, we can
invoke the Ghandian principle of
non-violence.

Last night the Stanford Student Congress sponsored a debate
on the topic of fallout shelters at Stanford.
Arguing for the shelters was Dick Wei nig, "noted (in the
words of Nils Wessel) Bay Area conservative,” and against, Ira
Sandperl, noted Bay Area pacifist. Preceding the debate, Mr.

Robert Beyer, of the Stanford-
News Service, gave a short talk
recounting the facts pertaining
to the Stanford policy, Stanford’s
shelters, and the effects of a nu
clear blast.

In his talk, Beyer emphasized
three facts about Stanford’s shel
ters: our shelters protect us only
against fallout, the shelters
would not exist after an attack
on San Francisco or its proximi
ty, and, that the shelters were
“low-budget protection.”
