# Holifield Says U.S. Testing Must Continue

### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
“We cannot hide our heads in
the sand; because nuclear war is
‘unthinkable’ does not necessarily
mean it Is impossible.’’ Thus The
Honorable Chet Holifield, U.S.
representative from the 19th Dis
trict of California, began his an
alysis of the impact of atomic
energy upon international poli
tics last night.
Holifield, a 21-year veteran of
Congress and the present Vice-
Chairman of the Joint Committee
on Atomic Energy, emphasized
that today the question of peace
or nuclear holocaust rests solely
in the hands of the U.S. and Rus
sia.
He stressed, moreover, that,
“The strength of the free world
is the U.S. Our freedom is their
freedom; our security, their se
curity.’’
HOLIFIELD affirmed the posi
tion that there is a great deal to
bo gained by continuing U.S. nu
clear testing. “Our superiority in
nuclear weapons is the best as
surance for world peace,” he said.
“Therefore, our enlightened self
interest, and that of the free
world, demands we continue test
ing.”
Holifield was pessimistic on the
chance for an early test ban
treaty with Russia. He empha
sized that the Soviets have stub
bornly maintained their initial
position despite continued U.S.
willingness to compromise. Dur
ing the recent negotiations the
U.S. has reduced its original de
mand for 22 on-site inspections a
year to seven. The U.S.S.R., how
ever, insists upon no more than
three such inspections.
MOREOVER, Holifield stressed
that a test ban treaty is, in itself,
no assurance of world peace. He
emphasized that such a treaty
could not prevent nations other
than the U.S. and Russia, name
ly France and Red China, from
continuing their nuclear develop
ment.
Holifield is not opposed to con
tinued tost ban talks. However,
ho insists that they must “pro
ceed realistically.” “I want peace
on earth more than anything
else,” he said, “but I want to
make sure we’re not signing a
piece of paper but rather a rea
listic document not dependent
upon our trust and confidence in
the Soviets nor their trust and
confidence in us.”
The congressman denied that
NATO is “coming apart at the
scams.” He indicated, however,
that serious problems do exist
resulting from some of the al
lies’ reluctance to give up any
portion of their sovereignty and
their fear that the U.S. will fail
to live up to its mutual defense
commitments in a crisis. Holi
field stressed that the U.S. in
tends to live up to its NATO obli
gations in full and has made the
initial motions in creating a truly
multilateral military force. He
cautioned, however, that NATO
still lacks the decision-making
machinery necessary to make it
a working international entity.
IN A PRESS conference earlier
in the day, Holifield stated his
views on the U.S. underground
shelter program. He suggested
that America should spend less
on its space program and more
on shelters. “We are spending 20
to 30 billion dollars to put a man
on the moon,” he said. “I feel
that shelters . . . that could save
200 million lives would bo a bet
ter justified expenditure.”

than the U.S. and Russia, name
ly France and Red China, from
continuing their nuclear develop
ment.
Holifield is not opposed to con
tinued tost ban talks. However,
ho insists that they must “pro
ceed realistically.” “I want peace
on earth more than anything
else,” he said, “but I want to
make sure we’re not signing a
piece of paper but rather a rea
listic document not dependent
upon our trust and confidence in
the Soviets nor their trust and
confidence in us.”
The congressman denied that
NATO is “coming apart at the
scams.” He indicated, however,
that serious problems do exist
resulting from some of the al
lies’ reluctance to give up any
portion of their sovereignty and
their fear that the U.S. will fail
to live up to its mutual defense
commitments in a crisis. Holi
field stressed that the U.S. in
tends to live up to its NATO obli
gations in full and has made the
initial motions in creating a truly
multilateral military force. He
cautioned, however, that NATO
still lacks the decision-making
machinery necessary to make it
a working international entity.
IN A PRESS conference earlier
in the day, Holifield stated his
views on the U.S. underground
shelter program. He suggested
that America should spend less
on its space program and more
on shelters. “We are spending 20
to 30 billion dollars to put a man
on the moon,” he said. “I feel
that shelters . . . that could save
200 million lives would bo a bet
ter justified expenditure.”
“We cannot hide our heads in
the sand; because nuclear war is
‘unthinkable’ does not necessarily
mean it Is impossible.’’ Thus The
Honorable Chet Holifield, U.S.
representative from the 19th Dis
trict of California, began his an
alysis of the impact of atomic
energy upon international poli
tics last night.
Holifield, a 21-year veteran of
Congress and the present Vice-
Chairman of the Joint Committee
on Atomic Energy, emphasized
that today the question of peace
or nuclear holocaust rests solely
in the hands of the U.S. and Rus
sia.
He stressed, moreover, that,
“The strength of the free world
is the U.S. Our freedom is their
freedom; our security, their se
curity.’’
HOLIFIELD affirmed the posi
tion that there is a great deal to
bo gained by continuing U.S. nu
clear testing. “Our superiority in
nuclear weapons is the best as
surance for world peace,” he said.
“Therefore, our enlightened self
interest, and that of the free
world, demands we continue test
ing.”
Holifield was pessimistic on the
chance for an early test ban
treaty with Russia. He empha
sized that the Soviets have stub
bornly maintained their initial
position despite continued U.S.
willingness to compromise. Dur
ing the recent negotiations the
U.S. has reduced its original de
mand for 22 on-site inspections a
year to seven. The U.S.S.R., how
ever, insists upon no more than
three such inspections.
MOREOVER, Holifield stressed
that a test ban treaty is, in itself,
no assurance of world peace. He
emphasized that such a treaty
could not prevent nations other
than the U.S. and Russia, name
ly France and Red China, from
continuing their nuclear develop
ment.
