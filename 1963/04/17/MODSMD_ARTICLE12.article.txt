# The 						Enlarged Legislature
## 
### 
The meeting of the new Legislature last Thursday was
surprisingly well organized and handled. Contrary to the
predictions of those who could foresee only unbelievable
confusion and endless debate, a fairly large agenda was com
pleted in almost the same amount of time that the old LASSU
used to take.
The quarrel and adjournment for lack of quorum over
the raising of the "Flicks” cost for the Convalescent Home
charity drive was an unfortunate incident which could have
been avoided had the new by-laws—with a stipulation for a
majority quorum rather than two-thirds quorum—been in
effect. The disagreement and split were very healthy in
themselves, because they demonstrated a degree of indepen
dence in thought that is welcome.
There may be a number of problems coming up, how r
ever, which are worth considering. It must be remembered
that last Thursday’s meeting was the first for many of the
members, and the lack of endless debate and confusion may
have been due to stage fright and unfamiliarity. There were
also no really bitter or intricate issues, except perhaps the
"Flicks cost increase, which ended in an unofficial tie vote.
There was no opportunity or reason for a small majority to
tie up all proceedings as a number of people feared would
happen in such a large group.
To prevent trouble in the future a number of precautions
will, necessarily, have to be made. For the Speaker of the
Legislature, to he elected in two weeks, an articulate, well
organized and forceful leader will have to be elected. Al
though the committee organization established in the new
Constitution will eliminate much of the debate on the main
floor, procedures will have to be formed for the circulation
of the committee minutes to all LASSU members. It should
also be stipulated that all new motions will be presented
soon enough to allow for copies to be made for everyone. It
may prove necessary to provide for a limit of debate time
which could be approved by a given fraction of members
present for each individual issue.
The new, enlarged LASSU presents the student body
with the opportunity to he very well represented in the de
cisions that are made. The fulfillment of this opportunity
will depend largely on the amount and quality of conscien
tious work and careful organization.
