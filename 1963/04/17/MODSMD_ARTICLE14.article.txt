Editors, The Daily:
Monday night I attended the meeting of the Stanford Stu
dent Congress where the question of fallout shelters was dis
cussed. During the first few minutes of open debate the follow
ing clause was stricken from the pacifist resolution:
“Fallout shelters are a step toward (he complete regimenta
tion of society which characterizes all totalitarian states, and
their acceptance without protest constitutes an abdication of
the values of individual right which are vital to our democracy,”
The comment was made that this clause was over stated.
It appears to me that this clause is the only important one
and that the Stanford Student Congress, in striking it, reduced
the resolution to merely an expression of fear: fear of war and
of physical life. Reading over the rest of the resolution down to
the proposals I note that every other clause contains this fear
of war and of life. In fact the second “Whereas” clause begins
“the presence of fallout shelters enhances the probability of
thermonuclear war in the following ways,” and then proceeds
to list several.
Granted, perhaps, that war is important in relation to our
physical well-being, but is our physical well-being more im
portant that what we could call, for want of a better name, our
spiritual well-being? The stricken clause is the only one that
even remotely is concerned with the spirit, with values. True,
“humanitarian values” are mentioned somewhere, hut the men
tion is rather vague and might as well not he there. Avoidance
of regimentation—this is the only important thing mentioned
in the original draft of the resolution. If fallout shelters affect
only our lives, do not affect our “spirits,” our “souls,” then their
discussion becomes trivial, unworthy of our attention.
It was on these grounds, these grounds of life and death,
that Mr.Weinig argued, but not Mr. Sandperl. No, Mr. Sandperl
was wiser and, in what he, and I, consider important, he was
better informed. Mr. Sandperl spoke of integrity, of the life and
death of the soul.

It has been brought to our attention that certain elements
among the passengers and crew favor the installation of “life”
boats on this ship. These elements have advanced the excuse that
such action would save lives in the event of a maritime dis
aster such as the ship striking and iceberg. Although we share
their concern, we remain unalterably opposed to any considera
tion of their course of action for the following reasons:
1. This program would lull you into a false sense of security.
2. It would cause undue alarm and destroy your desire to
continue your voyage in this ship.
3. Such action would make the Captain want to strike an ice
berg.
4. It demonstrates a lack of faith in our Captain.
5. The apparent security which “life” boats offer will make
our Navigators reckless.
6. These proposals will distract our attention from more im
portant things, i.e., building un-sinkahle ships. They may even
lead our builders to false economies and the building of ships
that are actually unsafe.
7. In the event of being struck by an iceberg (we will never
strike first) the “life” boats w’ould certainly sink along with the
ship.
8. If they do not sink, you will only be saved for a worse
fate, inevitable death on the open sea.
9. If you should be washed ashore on a desert island, you
will be unaccustomed to the hostile environment and will surely
die of exposure.
10. If you should be rescued by a passing vessel, you would
spend a life of remorse mourning over your lost loved ones.
11. The panic engendered by a collision with an iceberg
would destroy all vestiges of civilized human behavior. We shud
der at the vision of one man shooting another for the possession
of a “life” boat.
12. Such a catastrophe is too horrible to contemplate. Any
one who does contemplate it obviously advocates it.

At the last meeting of Legislature. I introduced the motion
to have the price of the flick on April 28 raised to 40 cents with
(he 20-cent increase to go to the Con Home Drive. This proce
dure is certainly nothing new. Each year the admission prices
to two flicks are normally raised to support drives—a flick
during winter quarter with the proceeds going to Winter Drives
and a flick during spring quarter with the proceeds going to
Con Home. I was surprised that there was so much opposition
this time.
Perhaps some of the opposition was due to the misunder
standing from last quarter when the flick price for winter drives
was raised and not given adequate publicity. This won’t be the
case for this flick. Signs were up at the flick last Sunday warn
ing that there would be no flick on April 21 and that the flick
the following Sunday might be 40 cents. Posters will be dis
played advertising Con Home Week and listing under April 28
“Con Home Flick.” Reminders will also he placed in The Daily.
Some who spoke against the motion suggested that "Stan
ford students have a right to cheap entertainment.” Even ac
cepting this notion as one in some hypothetical “Stanford Bill
of Student Rights,” I would argue that 40 cents is still “cheap
entertainment.” True, the price of the flick has been “doubled,”
but it could be increased six or seven fold and still be less than
a flick off campus.
Others argued that to raise the price would be coercive and
would force people to contribute td Con Home. This simply isn’t
true. Attendance at the flicks is entirely voluntary. And I would,
question whether there were any Stanford students who were
so “anti-Con Home” that they would refuse to have their money
used to support it. If this was the case, however, they could
elect to resist passively and not attend.
I would urge all LASSU delegates to vote in favor of the in
crease when it is reconsidered at the next meeting. I am some
what apologetic that the issue caused so much turmoil. It was
not my intention to generate so much heat.

Editors, The Daily;
Now that two eminent concert pianists have displayed their
talents in Memorial Auditorium with slightly more than a week
between performances, a comparison is inevitable. Whatever
the reactions of the capacity crowd to the recital of Philippe
Entremont and however The Daily’s readers may have re
sponded to the severe but essentially just review by Walter
Moore, the fact remains that despite Mr. Entremont’s personal
charm and occasional technical brilliance, his overall perform
ance was erratic and disappointing. Leonard Pennario, on the
other hand, demonstrated last Monday to the few who turned out
to hear him, a mature and authoritative command of his instru
ment and a soundness of musical ideas lacking in the younger
man.
While controversy may still rage concerning the relative
merits of the two performers, there is now' no question whatso
ever regarding the fitness of the Mem And piano. This “vener
able Steinway donated from the Lucie Stern Estate,” as Mr.
Moore termed it, may have been partially, responsible for cer
tain of Mr. Entremont’s shortcomings and for some of the ob
vious difficulties encountered by Mr. Pennario. It lacks reso
nance in the lowest registers and is harsh and strident in the
uppermost, while a few keys in or near the center at certain
times produce a tone comparable to that of a twanging steel
guitar string. Chords emerge as muddy, runs are not cleanly
articulated, and the damper pedal seems to hold unevenly,
which would account for unbalanced sonorities and vagaries in
dynamics.
If these failures are thus apparent to the audience, imagine
their effects upon a performer. Before another artist is engaged
to try his skill-—and his luck—upon this instrument or another
audience is subjected to its sounds, the Mem And Steinway
should be reconditioned or replaced.

Editors, The Daily:
A daring critic is Mr. Smith,
Not a man to trifle with.
Upon his victims he descends
And bites and tears and rips and rends.
And yet one wonders at his style;
Its first grade level makes one smile,
And think perhaps for lack of matter
He adopts this childish manner.
