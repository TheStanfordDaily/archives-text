Sutherland fanned nine Gators
in his stint, and personally ac
counted for 14 of the 18 outs in
his innings.

for the game in the next round.
George Thacher opened with a
double. Jim Seckler singled him
to third, and Sutherland aided his

one walk while striking out
three.

fielder singled in the third and
proceeded to swipe his twelfth
base in 12 attempts this season.
