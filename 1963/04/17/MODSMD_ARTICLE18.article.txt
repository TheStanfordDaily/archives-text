NEW YORK The only things
that separate the New York Mets
(mm the New York Yankees are
the Harlem River and a little tal
ent.
One subway stop into the
Bronx. Yankee Stadium rises
proud and stately as a fort, which,
indeed, it is. A fort successfully
resisting nearly all attempts of
lowly American League upstarts
to relieve it of the flag that pro
claims its occupants the cham
pions of the world.
ANT) ON THE other side of
the river, in the northeastern
reaches of Manhattan, lies the
Polo Grounds. The plans to tear
this structure from its founda
tion have had to be postponed; it
is still needed. Baseball of a kind
is played there.
The Mets were to open this sea
son in a new ball park in Flush

ing, Queens. But it is not ready
and reports that it will he before
the end of the season tire doubted
in most quarters. An astute ob
server of the problem, Robert
Lipsyle, has said that undoubted
ly the new stadium will be finish
ed before the Mets win their first
pennant. Nobody doubts this.
'The Mets have brought a new
dimension to major league base
ball, love. That is the adjective
most often used to describe the
team. “The Mets are lovable,” pro
claim the papers, and many peo
ple believe it. It could give love
a bad name.
ON THE FIRST day of the new
season (hi 1 Mets were tied for
first 25,000 lovers came to the
Polo Grounds. The Mets were
playing the Cardinals. It was a
chilly spring day and it had been
threatening to rain all morning.
But around noon the sun came
out for good and. though it didn’t
get much warmer, the clouds dis
appeared.
All the players for both teams
were introduced and everybody
gave a nice hand to Stan Musial
of the Cardinals and to Duke Sni
der, whom the Mets had recently
obtained from the Dodgers. The
game began.
Roger Craig, the top pitcher
for the Mots, according to Casey
Stengel, threw the first pitch and
it was a strike. But then the Car
dinal batter, Curt Flood, hit a
slow roller down toward third
base. It was a tough chance and
Charley Neal ran in from third,
grabbed the ball and threw it five
feet out of the reach of the first
baseman. Flood went to second
and the new season was under
way.
“SAME 01,1) Mets,” somebody
was heard to say. The Cardinals
hit everything Craig had to offer
and when he was finally removed
they showed little mercy to his
successor. The Mets committed
four errors and their two pitchers
balked four times. The final score
was 7-0 and the Mets had two
hits. That’s National League
baseball in the big city.
Is there hope? Perhaps. The
Mets have an 18-year-old right
fielder named Ed Kranepool who
last year was hitting homeruns
for a high school in the Bronx.
He has lots of poise, plays his po
sition well and takes the big
swing. No doubt he will hit some
homeruns this year and his team
will be glad to have them.
But the Mets can’t hit (they got
four hits in their second game
and six in the third one) and they
can’t field. Their top pitcher
brings out the best in every bat
ter he faces and their manager
has to stop the game to show his
relief pitchers how not to balk.
It will bo a long season. It’s a
good thing the Mets are so lov
able, otherwise nobody would like
them.

balked four times. The final score
was 7-0 and the Mets had two
hits. That’s National League
baseball in the big city.
Is there hope? Perhaps. The
Mets have an 18-year-old right
fielder named Ed Kranepool who
last year was hitting homeruns
for a high school in the Bronx.
He has lots of poise, plays his po
sition well and takes the big
swing. No doubt he will hit some
homeruns this year and his team
will be glad to have them.
But the Mets can’t hit (they got
four hits in their second game
and six in the third one) and they
can’t field. Their top pitcher
brings out the best in every bat
ter he faces and their manager
has to stop the game to show his
relief pitchers how not to balk.
It will bo a long season. It’s a
good thing the Mets are so lov
able, otherwise nobody would like
them.

game began.
Roger Craig, the top pitcher
for the Mots, according to Casey
Stengel, threw the first pitch and
it was a strike. But then the Car
dinal batter, Curt Flood, hit a
slow roller down toward third
base. It was a tough chance and
Charley Neal ran in from third,
grabbed the ball and threw it five
feet out of the reach of the first
baseman. Flood went to second
and the new season was under
way.
“SAME 01,1) Mets,” somebody
was heard to say. The Cardinals
hit everything Craig had to offer
