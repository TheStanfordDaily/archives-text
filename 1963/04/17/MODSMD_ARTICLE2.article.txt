Last Monday night the Stan
ford Student Congress after con
siderable discussion passed a res
olution against fallout shelters by
a 70 to 27 vote. The resolution
states:
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE
STANFORD STUDENT CON
GRESS THAT: Stanford Univer
sity should take the following
steps toward abolishing fallout
shelters on the campus:
(1) Refuse to accept further
Federal funds for the develop
ment of additional proposed shel
ters;
(2) Suggest to the United
States government that it donate
the emergency rations in the
shelters to either Food For Peace,
or CARE;
(3) Remove all fallout shelter
signs on the campus;
(4) Aid and encourage research
devoted to finding means to the
peaceful resolutoin of conflict,
and seek to correct all mislead
ing information regarding the ef
ficacy of fallout shelters:
AND THAT: The United States
government should discontinue
the Federal fallout shelter pro
gram with the funds for civil de
fense to be turned over to an in
ternational agency such as World
Health Organization, or UNESCO.
This resolution will be sent to
President Kennedy, President
Sterling, and the Directors of the
civil defense programs of Palo
Alto, Santa Clara County, Cali
fornia, and the United States
Government.
It is the goal of the SSC to
provide a means of expression of
the views of students on political
and social issues through these
programs of debate, discussion,
and voting on resolutions. It has
been organized in response to the
Trustees’ liberalization of the
University policy of allowing stu
dents to speak out on issues. The
Advisory Board wishes to empha
size the fact that this is a volun
tary organization open to any
body who has an opinion to ex
press. Its resolutions are the ex
pressions of those present.
“WE WERE disappointed,” said
Chuck Bischoff. a member of the
Advisory Board, “that more of
the conservative opinion was not
present and expressed. If this is
going to be a working organiza
tion it must bo a dialogue be
tween two sides.”
The SSC will meet every week
to discuss issues of interest.
They plan to enrich their pro
gram with speakers when pos
sible.
