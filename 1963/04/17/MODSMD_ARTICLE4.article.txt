# Job Rehabilitation Aids Handicapped

### PATRICIA LONG 
What happens to a truck driver
whom an accident leaves para
lyzed from the waist down? To a
workman whose arthritic hands
can no longer grasp tools?
Researchers at the Stanford
Medical Center are developing
tests to determine what those
handicapped people can do. By
breaking a job down into a series
of elemental motions and measur
ing the subject’s performance on
j each activity, they can determine
| the general type of employment
j best suited to that particular per
son.
“We are not concerned with
[ persons who can find work or
who can adapt. What we’re look
ing for is people who wore not
| rehired or who cannot find jobs,
people who present problems to
themselves, their families, and
; service agencies," said Dr. G. Pe
j ter Paulhe, head of the Job Re
j habilitation Study.
THE PURPOSE of this study—
j which is the only project in the
j country to use scientific instru
ments to measure the extent to
j which the disabled can use vari
| ous parts of their bodies—is to
; develop ways of testing the work
capacity of the disabled.
To do this, the team has con
| structed a small but complete
“manufacturing plant” where
; various jobs are set up for pa
tients to do. The motions of each
job are scientifically classified;
as a patient works at a few jobs
for several days the team can de
termine which motions he can
, perform most efficiently. Gener
j al recommendations are then
i given to a vocational counselor
1 who works with service agencies.

The team also estimates the
patient’s fatigue, and differenti
ates between true physiological
fatigue and other effects such as
boredom and monotony.
“WE ARE most interested in
those borderline cases where
there is question in the counsel
or’s mind whether the lack of vo
cation is psychological or physi
cal,” explained Dr. Paulhe. The
tests are an attempt to determine
whether or not the patient is us
ing his handicap to become un
necessarily dependent.
In addition, the team is study
ing the individual’s ability to
adapt to variations in supervision,
and common stresses which
arise.
Following a prepared script,
the work supervisor varies the
pressure on the patient, building
from simple suggestions to stern
demands and personal criticism.
The patient’s verbal responses
are tape recorded and examined
for any inappropriate reactions.
Changes in breathing pattern,
sweating, blanching, and nervous
ness are noted. The recordings of
the motion limes are checked for
signs of disorganization. The
stress testing is followed by an
interview in which the procedure
is explained to the patient and
he is questioned about his reac
tions.
TESTS WHERE it is easy to
err. such as putting screws into
threaded holes where a slight
mistake prevents the screw from
fitting, also create high-pressure
situations.
Up-to-date techniques for teach
ing principles of rehabilitation to
medical students will he outlined
during the Third Institute on

Teaching of Rehabilitation Medi
cine at Stanford April 17 to 20.
The first such institute to be
held in the West, it is being spon
sored by (he Stanford University
School of Medicine in cooperation
with (he Vocational Rehabilita
tion Administration of the U.S.
Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare.
MORE THAN 75 representa
tives from medical schools hav
ing teaching programs in rehabil
itation medicine have been in
vited to attend the four-day
meeting.
Purpose of the periodic insti
tutes is to evaluate new methods
of teaching students to recognize
and manage problems caused by
crippling diseases or accidents
and their impact on the persons
involved.
The Job Rehabilitation Study
began a year and a half ago at
Stanford. A recent grant of $50,-
000 from the Office of Vocational
Rehabilitation of the U.S. Depart
ment of Health, Education, and
Welfare will facilitate the use of
now recording equipment and
permit the data to be processed.
MEMBERS of the team which
is headed by Dr. Paulho, are Dr.
David A. Thompson, assistant
professor of industrial engineer
ing: William Dauterman, chief,
Vocational Rehabilitation Serv
ices; Wallace McDonald, labora
tory supervisor; Dr. Jose Mon
tero, assistant professor of medi
cine; Bradley Efron, Statistics
Department; and Mark Draper,
research assistant. Dr. James
Bliss and Ken Gardner, research
engineers at Stanford Research
Institute in Menlo Park complete
the group.
