# Panel, Reception To Bring FOCUS Program to Close
## 
### SCOTT McBRIDE 
A panel discussion will be fea
tured in a program of the Politi
cal Union’s FOCUS 1963 tonight.
Students will have an opportuni
ty to meet the panelists at 4:15
at a reception in the large lounge
in Tresidder.
Prof. Arrow of the Department
of Economics will moderate the
panel discussion beginning at
7:45 p.m. in the Little Theater in
Mom. Aud.
RICHARD HOLTON, Assistant
Secretary for Economic Affairs,
will represent government in the
discussion of the FOCUS theme
“Relationships of Government,
Business, and Labor.” Holton is
presently on leave from his busi
ness administration professor
ship at the University of Califor
nia. At the University he is also
Director of Business and Eco
nomic Research, and author of
many books.
R. C ONRAD COOPER, Execu
tive Vice President of U.S. Steel,
will speak for business on the
panel. Representing business will
not bo a wholly new experience
for Cooper; he has been chief
spokesman for the steel indus
try’s major producers in negoti
ations with the United Steelwork
ers of America. Interestingly, he
began his career with Wheeling
Steel Corp. which has just re
cently initiated price increases
which were scorned last year by
the Administration and have not
drawn much more favor this
year.
PAUL SCHRADE, Regional Di
rector of the United Automobile,
Aerospace, and Agricultural Im
plement Workers of America will
represent labor. The strike pres
ently threatening at Boeing Air
craft is in his region. Also, his
union is a member of the AFL
CIO of which the United Steel
workers are members.
“The response to the FOCUS
program so far is disappointing,”
stated Jan De Bakcsy yesterday,
in the KZSU 5 p.m. news report.
It has been “unfortunately not
as successful a program from the
audience point of view.”
Because of the rising steel
prices problem, Leslie K. Wor
thington, President of U.S. Steel,
will not be able to bo present.
“Instead an equally competent—
if that’s possible—representative
of the industry, Cooper, will at
tend. He is a terribly delightful
young person, a past assistant to
Walter Rcuthcr.” said Miss De
Bakcsy.
BECAUSE of the lack of at
tendance, she said, the panel dis
cussion this evening has been
moved to the Little Theater from
Mem. Aud., but the members are
all still “terribly excited” about it.

began his career with Wheeling
Steel Corp. which has just re
cently initiated price increases
which were scorned last year by
the Administration and have not
drawn much more favor this
year.
PAUL SCHRADE, Regional Di
rector of the United Automobile,
Aerospace, and Agricultural Im
plement Workers of America will
represent labor. The strike pres
ently threatening at Boeing Air
craft is in his region. Also, his
union is a member of the AFL
CIO of which the United Steel
workers are members.
“The response to the FOCUS
program so far is disappointing,”
stated Jan De Bakcsy yesterday,
in the KZSU 5 p.m. news report.
It has been “unfortunately not
as successful a program from the
audience point of view.”
Because of the rising steel
prices problem, Leslie K. Wor
thington, President of U.S. Steel,
will not be able to bo present.
“Instead an equally competent—
if that’s possible—representative
of the industry, Cooper, will at
tend. He is a terribly delightful
young person, a past assistant to
Walter Rcuthcr.” said Miss De
Bakcsy.
BECAUSE of the lack of at
tendance, she said, the panel dis
cussion this evening has been
moved to the Little Theater from
Mem. Aud., but the members are
all still “terribly excited” about it.
A panel discussion will be fea
tured in a program of the Politi
cal Union’s FOCUS 1963 tonight.
Students will have an opportuni
ty to meet the panelists at 4:15
at a reception in the large lounge
in Tresidder.

of Economics will moderate the
panel discussion beginning at
7:45 p.m. in the Little Theater in
Mom. Aud.
RICHARD HOLTON, Assistant
Secretary for Economic Affairs,
will represent government in the

nia. At the University he is also
Director of Business and Eco
nomic Research, and author of
many books.
R. C ONRAD COOPER, Execu
tive Vice President of U.S. Steel,
will speak for business on the
panel. Representing business will
not bo a wholly new experience
for Cooper; he has been chief
spokesman for the steel indus
try’s major producers in negoti
ations with the United Steelwork
ers of America. Interestingly, he
began his career with Wheeling
Steel Corp. which has just re
cently initiated price increases
which were scorned last year by
