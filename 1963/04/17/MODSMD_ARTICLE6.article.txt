## 
### 
The princess who may some
day be Queen of The Netherlands,
took (he usual VIP-round of
Stanford University this after
noon: Memorial Church, the
President’s office, and Hoover
Tower for a look at the campus,
Palo Alto, and the mid-Peninsula.
Princess Beatrix requested of
President Wallace Sterling to
meet Stanford students who had
served with the Peace Corps or
had volunteered to serve. Of the
Peace Corps she said, “ . . . the
most interesting idea for young
people in years—a real oppor
tunity to serve.”
Students invited to chat with
the princess were William G.
Adams, Dorothy Brown, Ann
Chamberlain, Stephen Hass, Mi
chael Newman and Ruth Rouse
who were all in the Peace Corps.
Also asked to talk with her was
Peter Grothe, a teaching assis
tant at Stanford, who was one of
several persons who suggested
the Peace Corps plan to President
Kennedy. After Grothe gets his
Ph.D. at Stanford he has plans
to return to the Peace Corps.
Stanford is sixth among uni
versities in number of Peace
Corps Volunteers and is first for
universities with less than 10,000
students. As of February 1, 60
Stanford students were serving
in the Peace Corps. The nearest
competitor in the undcr-10,000
class was Yale with 37.
The blonde Dutch Princess was
accompanied to Palo Alto by a
lady-in-waiting and her San Fran
cisco hosts, Mr. and Mrs. J. D.
Zellerbach.
