# Liberal Education To Be Discussed By Dean Williamson
## 
### 
E. G. Williamson, Dean of Stu
dents and Professor of Psycholo
gy at the University of Minne
sota, will deliver an all-campus
address this afternoon at 4:15
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
on “The Responsibility of Stu
dents” in realizing the goals of a
liberal education. In his speech,
Williamson will concern himself
with the importance of academic
inquiry and its relation to aca
demic freedom. Williamson be
lieves that there should not be
the disparity between curricular
and extra-curricular life that is
often manifested in student ac
tivities on campus, and that this
disparity can be greatly de
creased by making available all
the resources of a university, i.e„
faculty, libraries, to the student
as he pursues out-of-class issues
such as fallout shelters, as well
as academic subjects.
THE DEAN’S speech is the sec
ond in a series of five addresses on
“The Revitalization of the Liberal
Arts,” each one dealing with a
particular segment of the univer
sity community and its responsi
bilities to the liberal arts.
A panel discussion on “The Re
sponsibility of Students” will fol
low Dean Williamson’s speech at
7:30 p.m. in the Main Lounge of
Tresidder. Participating with the
Dean will bo Stanford faculty
and students Armin Rosencranz,
Edie Brown, Chuck Bischoff; dis
cussion from the audience will be

Dean Williamson will be a
guest-in-residence in Stern Hall
throughout the week, and will
elaborate on his topic in informal
discussions and individual contact
in the dormitory.

Commager will speak to another
segment of the university commu
nity. His topic will be “The Re
sponsibility of Governing
Boards,” and will be at 7:30 p.m.,
