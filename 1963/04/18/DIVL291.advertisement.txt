HOW TO GET EDUCATED
ALTHOUGH ATTENDING COLLEGE
In your quest lor a college degree, are you becoming a narrow
specialist, or are you being educated in the broad, classical
sense of the word?
This question is being asked today by many serious observers
—including my barber, my roofer, and my little dog Spot—
and it would be well to seek an answer.
Are we becoming experts only in the confined area of our
majors, or does our knowledge range far and wide? Do we, for
example, know who fought in the Battle of Jenkins’ Ear, or
Kant’s epistemology, or Planck's constant, or Valsalva’s maneu
ver, or what Wordsworth was doing ten miles above Tintcrn
Abbey?
If we do not, we arc turning, alas, into specialists. How
then can we broaden our vistas, lengthen our horizons—be
come, in short, educated?
Well sir, the first thing wc must do is throw away our curri
cula. Tomorrow, instead of going to the same old classes, let
us try something new. Let us not think of college as a rigid
discipline, but as a kind of vast academic smorgasbord, with
all kinds of tempting intellectual tidbits to savor. Let's start
sampling tomorrow.

We will begin the day with a stimulating seminar in Hittite
artifacts. Then we will go over to marine biology and spend a
happy hour with the sea slugs. Then we will open our pores by
drilling a spell with the BOTC. Then we’ll go over to journalism
and tear out the front page. Then we ll go to the medical school
and autograph some casts. Then we’ll go to home economics
and have lunch.
And between classes we’ll smoke Marlboro Cigarettes. This,
let me emphasize, is not an added fillip to the broadening of
our education. This is an essential. To learn to live fully and
well is an important part of education, and Marlboros are an
important part of living fully and well. What a sense of com
pleteness you will get from Marlboro’s fine tobaccos, from
Marlboro’s pure filter! What flavor Marlboro delivers! Through
that immaculate filter comes flavor in full measure, flavor with
out stint nr compromise, flavor that wrinkled care derides,
flavor holding both its sides. This triumph of the tobacconist’s
art comes to you in soft pack or Flip-Top box and can be lighted
with match, lighter, candle, Welsbach mantle, or by rubbing
two small Indians together.
When we have embarked on this new regimen—or, more
accurately, lack of regimen—we will soon be cultured as all
get out. When strangers accost us on the street and say, “What
was Wordsworth doing ten miles above Tintcrn Abbey, hey?”
wc will no longer slink away in silent abashment. We will reply
loud and clear;
“As any truly educated person knows, Wordsworth, Shelley,
and Keats used to go to the Widdicombe Fair every year for
the poetry-writing contests and three-legged races, both of
which they enjoyed lyrically. Well sir, imagine their chagrin
when they arrived at the Fair in 1770 and learned that Oliver
Cromwell, uneasy because Guy Fawkes had just invented the
spinning jenny, had cancelled all public gatherings, including
the Widdicombe Fair and Liverpool. Shelley was so upset
that he drowned himself in a butt of malmsey. Keats went to
London and became Charlotte Bronte. Wordsworth ran blindly
into the forest until he collapsed in a heap ten miles above
Tintcrn Abbey. There he lay for several years, sobbing and
kicking his little fat legs. At length, peace returned to him. He
looked around, noted the beauty of the forest, and was so moved
that he wrote Joyce Kilmer’s immortal Trees ... And that,
smart-apple, is what Wordsworth was doing ten miles above
Tintern Abbey.”
