Result: Ford-built cars demonstrate outstanding durability
in competitions like the Daytona 500
Faults of recent competitive events prove dramatically the
durability and reliability of today’s Ford-built cars. Our cars swept
the first five places in the Daytona 500 for example. More important
to you-Ford-built entries had the highest ratio of finishers in
this grueling test of stamina! Less than half-just 23-of the 50
starters finished; 13 of them were Ford-built!
Competitions such as the Daytona 500 are car killers. Piston
rings can fail, transmissions can be demolished and engines
blow up under these maximum efforts. It's a grinding demand
for tota! performance and Ford-built cars proved they could take
it better than any of the others.
Quite an eye-opener for car buyers. And conclusive proof that
superior engineering at Ford Motor Company has produced more
rugged engines and transmissions, sturdier bodies and frames
and better all-round durability for today's Ford-built automobiles.
