# Public Attendance at Activities On Campus Might Be Curbed
## 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
Now questions are being asked about the future of the tradi
tional Stanford policy of public service and cultural contribution
to the surrounding community. Due to the rapid growth of the
University and Palo Alto, the policy of allowing the public to
attend campus events, especially lectures, is being threatened by

space limitations in Stanford fa-4
cilities.
An editorial entitled “Public
Should Not Bo Excluded” in the
Palo Alto Times of last Thursday
pointed to the Arnold Toynbee
lecture as a demonstration of the
need for larger facilities as well
as new attendance policies.
WHEN TOYNBEE spoke on
April 2 as a part of the Tuesday
Evening Series, as many people
wore turned away at the door of
Memorial Hall auditorium (seat
ing capacity 1700) as were ad
mitted. Because persons not affil
iated with the University were
excluded until the last 10 minutes
before the lecture began, almost
all the townspeople were unable
to attend.
Boyd Haight, author of the edi
torial, suggested that the ideal
solution to the problem would be
a much larger auditorium seat
ing “several thousand,” built on
Stanford land partly with funds
of Palo Alto and other Stanford
area municipalities.
FOR THE IMMEDIATE future

*.
a policy of reserving a certain
proportion of the space for the
public, possibly by issuing free
tickets made available on a first
come, first-served basis, is under
study.
Miss Agnes Nohrnberg, direc
tor of the Committee on Public
Exercises, has reaffirmed the
long-time policy of the committee
of service to both students and
the public. “But students never
theless should have preference,”
she said.
The Tuesday Evening Series,
mentioned specifically by the
Palo Alto Times editorial, has a
tradition dating back almost to
the founding of the University.
According to Miss Nohrnberg, the
Series was conceived by Jane
Stanford as “part of the universi
ty’s contribution to the young
and struggling town of Palo Al
to.” And, as pointed out in the
editorial, the townspeople regu
larly are “the main supporters”
of the series when student at
tendance is low.
