## A
						Republican Win in 1964? 
### JOHN E. BONINE 
Program Vice-President, Stanford Area Young Republicans
The article on Nelson Rockefeller’s chances of defeating
President Kennedy (Stanford Daily, April 15) was itself, I think,
a testimony to the fact that Rockefeller can’t win in 1964.
As William Moore pointed out in the article, Rockefeller is
looking desperately for ammunition, and is having a hard time
finding it. But Mr. Moore would have us believe that Rocke
feller has a chance of winning the Presidency if he tries to out
promise President Kennedy in the big industrial States. These
States hold about 160 of the electoral votes (268 being necessary
to win).
1 question (1) whether Rockefeller can win in these States,
and (2) whether all of them are necessary to a Republican
victory.
Since I'm being heretical today, let’s begin with the biggest
heresy of all: Rockefeller can’t carry his home State of New
York in 1964.
The Republican Party lost New York in the last Presidential
election by 400,000 votes. In 1958, Rockefeller beat Averell Har
riman by 573,000 votes. In 1962 his margin over Robert Mor
genthau fell to 529,000 (most pundits were confidently pre
dicting a 750,000 to 1,000,000 edge), and this against what one
analyst described as “a cigar-store Indian.” Another 142,000
votes went to a protest candidate against Rockefeller. But the
low Rockefeller vote was not the result of a bad year for the
Republicans in New York: Jacob Javits won re-election to the
Senate by 856,000 votes. Ideology aside, it seems the voters in
Rockefeller’s own State are becoming more and more displeased
with him.
In addition, Samuel Lubell, an independent pollster, reports
that 80 per cent of the Kennedy Democrats who supported
Rockefeller in 1962 have already decided to back Kennedy over
Rockefeller in 1964 if they are the opposing candidates for the
Presidency. Can Rockefeller take New York from Kennedy in
1964? Unlikely.
Let us take a look at the largest State in the nation, Cali
fornia. Richard Nixon, a native son, just barely kept the State
from Kennedy in 1960, and lost to Edmund G. Brown in 1962 by
over 300,000 votes. Don't forget. California is x'egisterd 2 to 1
Democratic. Rockefeller’s appeal to California Democrats is
limited (many would just as soon give Kennedy another term).
Californians rarely reject major incumbents, unless they are
seriously discontented and are presented with a meaningful ide
ological difference, such as with Max Rafferty. Nixon’s native
birth undoubtedly helped him overcome the registration in 1960,
against an out-of-stater, but was no help in 1962. Rockefeller
would not have any such advantage, and his coming from rival
New York probably wouldn’t help too much. Furthermore, as Mr.
Moore suggests, Rockefeller does not present a serious ideologi
cal alternative, and his attempts to do so are failing in most
cases.
Is Rockefeller the Republican who can overcome the Demo
cratic registration and carry California? Doubtful.
Is the electoin to be conceded then? Or is there some strat
egy which would bring the GOP victory in 1964?
Mr. Moore recognized in his article that Rockefeller could
not win the South. In order to win without the South, Rocke
feller would have to defeat Kennedy 268 to 139, or almost 2 to 1,
in the remaining States. And if he couldn’t win California and
New York, he wouldn’t stand a chance.
The South is no longer the Democratic monolith it used to
be. Kennedy carried only 6 of the 11 southern States in 1960. In
1962 Republican Congressional candidates received one-third of
the votes cast, counting for the Democrats even those seats
which were uncontested. Such factors as incumbency and the
accompanying seniority work in the Democrats’ favor (but of
course wouldn’t in a Presidential election). Even with their
seniority, those Democrats who followed Kennedy’s program too
closely ran into trouble in 1962. In Alabama, Democratic Sena
tor Lister Hill won by only 0.7 per cent and Senators Olin John
ston of South Carolina and J. W. Fulbright of Arkansas met
with formidable opposition.
Most significant, I think, is that dhe Republicans making
these impressive inroads are conservative Republicans, not lib
erals. Remember, the South is still thoroughly conservative. If
liberal Democrat John F. Kennedy ran against a conservative
Republican, for whom would the South cast its ballots? As was
pointed out in “U.S. News & World Report” immediately after
the 1962 elections, Democratic politicians fear that a conserva
tive Republican would carry most of the southern and border
States—a total of 174 votes.
A candidate who could carry the southern and border States
would only have to pick up an additional 94 electoral votes. Even
conceding a few unpredictable losses in that region, the possi
bility of winning up to about 140 votes in the Midwest, northern
New England, and the Mountain States, would put him over the
top, if barely. Granted, this is a preliminary and somewhat op
timistic figure, but it is far easier to visualize than Rocke
feller's picking up 268 electoral votes outside the South. A more
realistic appraisal for Rockefeller would be a maximum of 220.
Furthermore, whether a conservative Republican could
sweep California, (as Max Rafferty did), especially if helped by
a similarly inclined Senatorial candidate, is an open question.
But regardless, I do think it is obvious that there lies before
the Republican Party an opportunity to reshape the political
structure and the future of our nation. The Grand Old Party
is at the position where it can either turn its back on a rising
Republican South, or stride in and break the Democratic hold
and thereby elect a President.
