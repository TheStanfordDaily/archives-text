# STAFF OPINION
## LASSU Concerned Only With Trivia 
### RICK SEIFERT 
Staff Editor
Although “flick prices” weigh heavily in the world’s balance,
it seems that LASSU, as an organization representative of a
supposedly intelligent, perceptive and concerned student body,
might direct its attention to matters of greater concern. As a
result of the Trustees’ decision that this ostensible organ of
opinion cannot express itself on off-campus issues, we are left
with a hollow drum that 120 representatives heat once a week to
the concern of no one. The question, then, is what to do with
LASSU.
When the new constitution was drawn up last year, the
drafters assumed that their new Legislature would command
a long lacking respect because (1) it would be dealing with im
portant questions concerning life beyond the gates of Stanford
and because (2) it would have a more representative member
ship through an increased number of delegates.
It was apparent at the time of the drafting that both
changes would be essential to achieving the desired end. Power
to speak on off-campus issues would have little influence if the
body did not have a substantial representational foundation.
On the other hand, a larger body dealing with the insignificant
questions plaguing the twenty-four man group would simply
multiply the evil.
The trustees’ decision has left us with an organization that
can only wallow in trivia, and it doesn’t even do that well.
The Legislature ought to take a long look in the mirror
Until the body can decide on significant questions that will hope
fully interest its constituency, it will continue to he a pocket for
tripe that should be handled by the Administration. Stanford
has a paid bureaucracy to handle many petty but essential
tasks, and there is no reason why students should waste their
time with work that should be handled by that bureaucracy.
What a representative student organization should direct
its attentions to are topics which contribute to and are a part
of the educational process. Hopefully, the newly formed Stanford
Student Congress, which has an open membership, will estab
lish itself in this role given the student support it deserves.
Surely campus conservatives can’t sit hack idly while the SSC
passes resolutions banning the further construction of fall-out
shelters.
As for LASSU, the most meaningful thing it can do given
the Trustees’ ultimatum, is disband in protest and direct their
energies elsewhere.
