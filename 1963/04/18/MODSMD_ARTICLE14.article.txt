Editors, The Daily;
The Great Shelter Controversy would be amusing if it con
cerned something a little less drastic. It has, of course, provoked
some interestingly ironic comment on both sides, and that should
give both sides some pause. For both sides of the controversy
are quite liable to the ironic treatment.
My own feeling is that some of us are wasting breath and
energies making a crusade out of it, as if either pro-shelter or
anti-shelter opinion were demonstrable as the only opinion. To
the anti-shelter people, it must be granted that a shelter pro
gram by the government is tactically a provocative move and
that the provision of sufficient shelter space for a large propor
tion of the population might indeed make the population too
complacent with an overly aggressive military stance by the
government.
At the same time, it must be granted to the pro-shelter
people that the argument that shelters will be useless in the
event of nuclear attack is an argument proceeding not from
knowledge but from guess. We do not know that they will pro
vide no protection; some people surmise that they will provide
no protection. On the other hand, we can be all but certain that
failure to have shelter will be 400 per cent effective in destruc
tion of human life, in the event of sufficiently close nuclear
attack. I am not convinced that we have the moral right to
pursue a course that virtually guarantees that there will be no
survivors of nuclear attack.
It is clear, I think, that no one in his right mind hopes for
a nuclear missile to flop out of the sky on Treasure Island. It
is also clear that the avoidance of this eventuality is the busi
ness of diplomacy. Our job, then, is not to hover anxiously
around the periphery of the issue but to make quite clear to the
government that in our view nuclear war is an unacceptable
solution to the world's problems. In the meantime, I have finally
come around to the rather ambiguous view that I would rather
the shelters were there than not there. They may not represent
any particular chance for my survival, but they may conceivably
represent a chance for somebody’s survival if worst comes to
worst, and I would prefer even that slight chance to no chance
at all. And if somebody quotes at me the exhortation of Jesus,
“Take no thought for tomorrow,” I will quote back at him that
same Jesus’ exhortation, “Be wise as serpents and harmless as
doves.”

Speaking as one born and raised in the City of Boston, I
feel I must stand up for the dear old city and its clam chowder
and point out that you are in graye,error iq calling the particu
lar clam concoction which you sierve on Friday “Boston Clarrt
Chowder.”
No Bostonian in his right mind would think of ever putting
tomatoes into clam chowder; this particular piece of bad taste
is peculiar to the benighted residents of the Island of Manhattan.
Boston (or more properly) New England Clam Chowder is made
with milk, cream, butter, lots of clams, Worcestershire, and as
sorted spices. Sometimes it is legitimate to float a few well
crisped pieces of pork fat on the top of (he chowder.
So, if you insist on keeping your sign, then may I beg that
you serve real Boston Clam Chowder or, if you insist on serv
ing your present (perfectly satisfactory) soup by all that’s
sacred please label it Manhattan Clam Chowder.

Editors, The Daily:
What was the purpose of K W Smith's poem “Creeping
Bigwheelism”? Was it to be humorous, to present a rational
criticism, or merely to slander the President of the A.S.S.U.?
If it was the first of these, it failed. Neither the hysterical tone
nor the unsupported attacks are products of rational thought.
Instead of a constructive criticism Mr. Smith has only achieved
libelous name-calling.
Who has worked harder and taken a clearer stand on the
extension of student rights and academic freedom at this uni
versity than Armin Rosencranz?
In addition, the legislature, consisting of students from all
segments of the campus, can hardly be considered “his Sheen
Baa. Baa.”

Editors, The Daily:
In defense of the much-maligned K W Smith;
How is it possible for anyone to be so blunt-witted as to
regard the Poison Ivy Primer as the work of an “angry young
man”? And concerning Rosencranz, no matter how good his
record, anyone “in the public eye” is a target for satire, includ
es the good-natured sort that Mr. Smith amuses himself by
writing. I applaud Mr. Smith for his lively column. However
humorous Smith’s Primer may be, the controversy it seems to
have aroused is even more amusing.
