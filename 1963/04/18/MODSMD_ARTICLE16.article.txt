UR Political Analyst

One of the most spectacular developments in international
politics within the last few years has been the emergence of
divisive conflicts between the two giants of the Communist
world—the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China.
The time-honored stereotype of a monolithic, coordinated,

Moscow-dominated bloc is no
longer tenable, and gradually
Western statesmen are becoming
aware of the implications of this
split for the non-communist
world. Now that the differences
between Moscow and Poking have
been publicly aired, it is especi
ally important that we under
stand both the cohesive and the
divisive elements in the Sino-
Soviet alliance. To achieve some
perspective on this problem we
must turn to the historical devel
opment of Moscow’s relations
wdth the Chinese Communists.
SOON AFTER the Russian
Revolution in 1917, Soviet tactici
ans were predicting, in good
Marxist style, that the highly de
veloped "capitalist” countries of
the West w'ould turn to Commu
nism. But after the failure of
communist uprisings in Germany
and Hungary, it became clear
that “capitalism” was not yet
moribund. To account for the con
tinued vitality of the Western
powers, Lenin formulated his
theory of “Imperialism, the high
est stage of Capitalism.”
China, which throughout the
19th century had been exploited
by the imperialist, was seen to
be a potentially revolutionary
country. Soviet advisers wore
soon sent to China, and by 1921
they had helped to develop an in
digenous Communist Party. In
accordance with Lenin’s theory
of class struggle, the Communists
were to ally themselves with
other revolutionary classes—The
national bourgeoisie, the petty
bourgeoisie, the peasants, and the
proletariat against the "reac
tionaries.”
RIGID ADHERENCE to this
doctrine by Stalin led, in 1926 and
1927, to disastrous miscalcula
tions resulting in the massacre of
many Chinese Communists by
Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang
forces. In 1927 the Communists
split away from the Nationalist
forces and retreated to the moun
tains where new' armies could be
built up among the peasantry.
Thrown upon its own resources,
the Chinese Communist Party
(CCPi, from its rural bases in
Kiangsi, preceded to develop its
own strategy of revolution. After
the “Long March” the commu
nists centered in Shensi, and it
was during this period that Mao
Tse-tung emerged as the Party’s
chief strategist. Consequently.
Mao’s power w'as based upon in
ternal rather than Soviet support.
By the mid-1930’s when Mao
had gained control of the CCP, he
had learned to distrust the na
tional bourgeoisie. While accept
ing Lenin’s analysis of class
structure, he w’as adamant in in
sisting that the “revolution from
below” must gain control of the
four-class alliance before cooper
ating with the bourgeoisie. In
stressing the ‘revolution from be
low” Mao was drawing upon a
theory developed by a brilliant
young Indian revolutionary, M.
N. Roy.
In retrospect we sec that many
of the differences which arose
between Moscow and Peking in
subsequent years can be traced
to the conflict between Lenin’s
thesis of “revolution from above”

and Roy’s “revolution from be
low.”
AFTER THE Communist-Na
tionalist rapprochement of 1937
during the Sino-Japanese war,
the Soviet Union once again be
gan to aid the Chinese forces.
But now the aid was channeled
to the Nationalists under Chiang
rather than to the CCP. Nonethe
less, Mao remained loyal to Mos
cow. For the next few years
Communist forces in China con
centrated on the war with Japan,
but as soon as World War II was
over they returned to their revo
lutionary struggle.
Stalin, however, was still not
willing to give all out support to
the CCP. urging that Mao should
continue to ally his forces with
the Kuominlang. Mao agreed, but
went ahead in his own way, and
in a few short years had man
aged to evict Chiang's troops
from the mainland and to estab
lish hegemony over China. That
Stalin had hardly anticipated this
can be seen by his post-war poli
cies toward China. In 1945, for
example, Soviet forces in Man
churia had dismantled and car
ried off most of the industrial
plants.
With the Chinese Communist
victory in October 1949, now prob
lems had to be faced. Soviet lead
ership of the bloc was assured by
Mao’s doctrine of “lean to one
side.” In December 1949, Mao
made his first trip to Moscow—
also his first trip outside of Chi
na—to arrange with Stalin a
“Treaty of Friendship, Alliance,
and Mutual Assistance.” Russia
promised strong, though not un
qualified, military assistance, and
made some rather feeble offers
of economic aid. Clearly Stalin
was not anxious to divert scarce
Russian resources to developing
China.
EVEN AFTER the outbreak of
the Korean War in 1950, Soviet
aid was not overly generous. As
soon as it became evident that
the Korean war was likely to be
a prolonged and costly affair, ef
forts were made to bring it to
an end. China was then forced to
turn hei* attention to the im
mense problems of consolidating
control within the country and
of turning China into an indus
trial nation.
Stalin’s death in 1953 clearly
altered Sino-Soviet relations, for
now Mao Tsc-tung could claim
to be the foremost Communist
leader and theoretician in the
world. Certainly no Russian load
er could match his prestige, nor
had any Russian actually led a
successful revolutionary move
ment. The next few years of Par
ty struggle in Moscow had great
significance for Peking, but the
extent to which relations between
the two giants would be strained
was not apparent until the 20th
Party Congress in February
1956.
The process of de-Stalinization
and Khrushchev’s plea for peace
ful coexistence created many
doubts among the leaders in Pe
king, and in the course of a few
years latent conflicts over basic
communist principles were to re
appear in familiar terms.
