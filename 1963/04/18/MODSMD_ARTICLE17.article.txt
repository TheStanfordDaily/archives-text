# Agreement in Washington on Taxes
## 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
There has come to be general
agreement in Washington that
the only big and new measure
which has a chance to be passed
by Congress is the tax bill. There
are, of course, many other things
that we ought to be greatly con
cerned about—notably the in
adequacy of our educational sys
tem. But there we are immobiliz
ed by the deadlock over the
church schools and over states’
rights.
The lax bill touches all our In
terests, even education, since an
expanding economy would pro
duce more revenue for the states
and localities as well as the fed
eral government. It touches al
most every other public matter,
be it the race for the moon or un
employment and juvenile delin
quency. A measure which will
stimulate economic growth is the
hub of the wheel from which all
the spokes radiate.
ALTHOUGH the House has
completed its hearings, there are
few outward signs of what tax
measures Congress is in fact go
ing to enact. There has been one
decisively important develop
ment since the administration
sent its proposals to Congress.
Though it is not admitted offici
ally, tax reform, except in more
or less token face-saving details,
has been abandoned. The bill
which will go to the House this
summer will be a bill to reduce
taxes.
This will put before the Con
gress and the country the basic
question: shall wo reduce taxes,
though this means a bigger budg
etary deficit, in order to stimulate
economic growth by evoking a
greater demand for consumer
goods and a greater investment
in capital goods?
Two quite separate witnesses
have recently testified on this
question. The one is Mr. Maud
ling, the Chancellor of the Ex
chequer in the Conservative gov
ernment of Great Britain. The
other is Governor Rockefeller,
the leading contender for the Re
publican nomination for Presi
dent. It is a most interesting and
significant fact that the British
chancellor and the New York
governor take their stand on the
same economic doctrine which is
the foundation of the Kennedy
fiscal policy.
AEE THREE are concerned
with the same problem, asluggish
rate of growth accompanied by
unemployment. All of them pro
pose in principle the same rem
edy. All of them derive this rem
edy from the same school of eco
nomic thinking, that of the Swe
dish economists and John May
nard Keynes. All of them propose
to overcome sluggishness by ex
panding demand, and all of them
propose to do this by reducing
taxes and accepting budgetary
deficits. (Mr, Maudling not only
reduces taxes, but increases gov
ernment expenditures.) All three
believe that the way eventually to
balance the budget will be to pro
duce more tax revenues from an
expanding economy.
Precise comparisons cannot bo
made between the Maudling
budget and the Kennedy budget.
For one thing, the British have
no budget like our highly mis
leading administrative budget,
which we call the budget. Fur
thermore, the British economy
and the British population arc

much smaller than ours. The
British national product is about
14 per cent of the American, and
the British population is only 30
per cent of ours. But. insofar as
the two budgets are comparable,
the calculations which I have
seen show that in relation to the
size of the two economies, the
British cash deficit is somewhat
larger than ours.
Governor Rockefeller’s contri
bution to the discussion is in a
statement Issued on April 6. It is,
I think, no misrepresentation to
say that the statement endorses
the theory and the main sub
stance of the administration pro
gram. The governor, who is in
search of Republican votes, does
not, of course, want it too widely

realized that there is such funda
mental similarity between the
Kennedy and the Rockefeller di
agnosis of. and the Kennedy and
the Rockefeller prescription for
economic sluggishness.
Both the governor and the
President want a tax cut as soon
as possible, and both of them
hope that if the economy re
sponds adequately it will then be
possible to balance the budget.
They differ somewhat on how
much expenditures should bo
held down in next year’s budget.
But the differences between them
are trivial as compared with their
fundamental agreement.

which will go to the House this

This will put before the Con
gress and the country the basic
question: shall wo reduce taxes,
though this means a bigger budg
etary deficit, in order to stimulate
economic growth by evoking a
greater demand for consumer
goods and a greater investment
in capital goods?
Two quite separate witnesses
have recently testified on this
question. The one is Mr. Maud
ling, the Chancellor of the Ex
chequer in the Conservative gov
ernment of Great Britain. The
other is Governor Rockefeller,
the leading contender for the Re
publican nomination for Presi
dent. It is a most interesting and
significant fact that the British
chancellor and the New York
governor take their stand on the
same economic doctrine which is
the foundation of the Kennedy
fiscal policy.
AEE THREE are concerned
with the same problem, asluggish
rate of growth accompanied by
unemployment. All of them pro
pose in principle the same rem
edy. All of them derive this rem
edy from the same school of eco
nomic thinking, that of the Swe
dish economists and John May
nard Keynes. All of them propose
to overcome sluggishness by ex
panding demand, and all of them
propose to do this by reducing
taxes and accepting budgetary
deficits. (Mr, Maudling not only
reduces taxes, but increases gov
ernment expenditures.) All three
believe that the way eventually to
balance the budget will be to pro
duce more tax revenues from an
expanding economy.
Precise comparisons cannot bo
made between the Maudling
budget and the Kennedy budget.
For one thing, the British have
no budget like our highly mis
leading administrative budget,
which we call the budget. Fur
thermore, the British economy
and the British population arc

much smaller than ours. The
British national product is about
14 per cent of the American, and
the British population is only 30
per cent of ours. But. insofar as
the two budgets are comparable,
the calculations which I have
seen show that in relation to the
size of the two economies, the
British cash deficit is somewhat
larger than ours.
Governor Rockefeller’s contri
bution to the discussion is in a
statement Issued on April 6. It is,
I think, no misrepresentation to
say that the statement endorses
the theory and the main sub
stance of the administration pro
gram. The governor, who is in
search of Republican votes, does
not, of course, want it too widely

realized that there is such funda
mental similarity between the
Kennedy and the Rockefeller di
agnosis of. and the Kennedy and
the Rockefeller prescription for
economic sluggishness.
Both the governor and the
President want a tax cut as soon
as possible, and both of them
hope that if the economy re
sponds adequately it will then be
possible to balance the budget.
They differ somewhat on how
much expenditures should bo
held down in next year’s budget.
But the differences between them
are trivial as compared with their
fundamental agreement.

There has come to be general
agreement in Washington that
the only big and new measure
which has a chance to be passed
by Congress is the tax bill. There
are, of course, many other things
that we ought to be greatly con
cerned about—notably the in
adequacy of our educational sys
tem. But there we are immobiliz
ed by the deadlock over the
church schools and over states’
rights.
The lax bill touches all our In
terests, even education, since an
expanding economy would pro
duce more revenue for the states
and localities as well as the fed
eral government. It touches al
most every other public matter,
be it the race for the moon or un
employment and juvenile delin
quency. A measure which will
stimulate economic growth is the
hub of the wheel from which all
the spokes radiate.
ALTHOUGH the House has

measures Congress is in fact go

panding demand, and all of them
propose to do this by reducing
taxes and accepting budgetary
deficits. (Mr, Maudling not only
reduces taxes, but increases gov
ernment expenditures.) All three
believe that the way eventually to
balance the budget will be to pro
duce more tax revenues from an
expanding economy.
Precise comparisons cannot bo
made between the Maudling
budget and the Kennedy budget.
For one thing, the British have
no budget like our highly mis
leading administrative budget,
which we call the budget. Fur
thermore, the British economy
and the British population arc

much smaller than ours. The
British national product is about
14 per cent of the American, and
the British population is only 30
per cent of ours. But. insofar as
the two budgets are comparable,
the calculations which I have
seen show that in relation to the
size of the two economies, the
British cash deficit is somewhat
larger than ours.
Governor Rockefeller’s contri
bution to the discussion is in a
statement Issued on April 6. It is,
I think, no misrepresentation to
say that the statement endorses
the theory and the main sub
stance of the administration pro
gram. The governor, who is in
search of Republican votes, does
not, of course, want it too widely

realized that there is such funda
mental similarity between the
Kennedy and the Rockefeller di
agnosis of. and the Kennedy and
the Rockefeller prescription for
economic sluggishness.
Both the governor and the
President want a tax cut as soon
as possible, and both of them
hope that if the economy re
sponds adequately it will then be
possible to balance the budget.
They differ somewhat on how
much expenditures should bo
held down in next year’s budget.
But the differences between them
are trivial as compared with their
fundamental agreement.
