# Theta Delts Win in Last 11 Seconds
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
A bunch of intramural basket
ball players coached by two un
dergraduates produced an ath
letic drama in the university
championship game last night
that Alfred Hitchcock would have
been proud to take credit for.
STKVK KINO sank a 12-foot
jump shot for Theta Delt with 11
seconds left for what proved to
be the winning points over Sigma
Chi., 39-38. However, in the time
remaining, Sigma Chi took two
lime outs and nearly won the
game as Jim Shroyer missed a
six-footer and Chris .lessen
missed a tip just before the final
buzzer; a second tip by .lessen
fell through, futilely.
TIIKTA DKI/T’s win added the
basketball championship to a
second place in touch football
for their top university intra
murid accomplishments this year;
it also deprived Sigma Chi of its

fourth consecutive basketball
championship.
KING’S SHOT culminated a 32-
minute struggle by the Theta
Delts. who never led in the game
until the end. After a relatively
close first half. Sigma Chi
coached by Don Clemetson, led
23-17 at the intermission and
maintained a 6-7 point lead
throughout the third quarter.
They had been successful against
Theta Delt's zone defense with a
1-3-1 offensive setup; crisp pass
ing patterns continually set up
good shots for them, especially
for Nels Christensen, their best
shooter. On defense, they cur
tailed Theta Dell’s fast break and
forced the shorter Theta Delts
into shooting from well-guarded
situations.
This pattern continued until
6:58 remained when King scored
a three-point play immediately
after Bob Strohecker’s 20-foot
basket; the score stood 30-28 then,
but Sigma Chi quickly pulled out

on goals by Christenson and Jes-1
sen.
BI T TIIKTA Dolt out it to one
point, 34-33, at 4:45, on player
coach Munn Chin’s layup an d
Charlie Burke’s free throw. Chris
tensen sank two quick baskets
inside (38-35, Sigma Chi i hut
David Hisey retaliated on a lay-up
assisted by Chin, and a tip-in and
the score was 38-37 at 2:50. Sig
ma Chi’s shooting and floor game
completely gave out after that,
but Theta Dolt missed four floor
shots from excellent position, try
ing for the go-ahead points. A re
bounding scuffle and an out-of
bounds play finally set up King’s
winning shot.
King led Theta Dell with 11,
but Christensen was high for the
game with IS. Strohecker had
eight and Jessen and Don Yore
had seven for Sigma Chi. Theta
Dell hit 33 per cent and Sigma
Chi shot 28. The rebounds and
ball control errors were nearly
even.
