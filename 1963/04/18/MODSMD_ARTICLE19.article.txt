NEW YORK (UPIi Paul Hor
nung of the Green Bay Packers
and Alex Karras of the Detroit
Lions, two of the National Foot
ball League’s brightest stars,
were suspended indefinitely yes
terday for betting on games in;
the league’s biggest scandal since
1946.
Pete Rozelle, the 36-year-old
NFL commissioner, meted out >
the harsh penalties with express
ed regret following an intensive
investigation that took more than
10 months and included 52 inter
views related to players and of
ficials connected with eight clubs.
“It was the most difficult deci
sion I've ever had to make in my j
life," said Rozelle, in explaining |
that Hornung and Karras’ cases
could not possibly be reviewed
before 1964 and that they are
now “legally free’’ to play in any
other league if they like.
Other Leagues Refuse
However, both the American !
Football League and the Canadi
an League said the players would
not be permitted to play.
In other simultaneous decisions j
by Rozelle:
Five of Karras’ Detroit team
mates- guard John Gordy, defen
sive back Gary Lowe, lineback
ers Joe Schmidt and Wayne
Walker, and end Sam Williams
were fined $2,000 each for mak
ing a $5O bet on one game.
The Detroit team was fined
$4,000 because head coach George ;
Wilson didn’t report certain find
ings to the league and because i
unauthorized persons were per-;
mitted to have sideline passes I

and sit on the Linns' bench dur
ing games.
Rick Casares, veteran full
back for the Chicago Bears, and
Bob St. Clair. San Francisco
Forty Niners tackle, were given
a clean bill of health from ru
mors that they had associated
with gambling elements.
An investigation is being con
tinued regarding allegations that
President Carroll Rosenbloom of
the Baltimore Colts bet on league
games during a period eight to
10 years ago.
HOZKLLK, chain-smoking at
yesterday’s conference and obvi
ously somewhat tense, stressed
his investigation turned up “no
evidence that any NFL player
has given less than his best in
playing any game.”
“There is no evidence that any
player has ever bet against his
own team.” he added, “and there
is no evidence that any NFL
player has sold information to
gamblers.”
But, Rozelle hastily pointed out,
there was “clear evidence” some
NFL players knowingly carried
on undesirable associations which
in some instances, led to their
betting on their own team.
And there was also clear evi
dence, the commissioner added,
that many players have been too
free in passing along information
concerning their team to friends
and acquaintances.
POSSIBLY the biggest shock
to come out of the entire investi
gation was Hornung’s involve
ment.
“1 made a terrible mistake,”
Hornung said contritely. “I real
ize this now. I am truly sorry.
What else is there to say.”

investigation that took more than
10 months and included 52 inter
views related to players and of
ficials connected with eight clubs.
“It was the most difficult deci
sion I've ever had to make in my j
life," said Rozelle, in explaining |
that Hornung and Karras’ cases
could not possibly be reviewed
before 1964 and that they are
now “legally free’’ to play in any
other league if they like.
Other Leagues Refuse
However, both the American !
Football League and the Canadi
an League said the players would
not be permitted to play.
In other simultaneous decisions j
by Rozelle:
Five of Karras’ Detroit team
mates- guard John Gordy, defen
sive back Gary Lowe, lineback
ers Joe Schmidt and Wayne
Walker, and end Sam Williams
were fined $2,000 each for mak
ing a $5O bet on one game.
The Detroit team was fined
$4,000 because head coach George ;
Wilson didn’t report certain find
ings to the league and because i
unauthorized persons were per-;
mitted to have sideline passes I

and sit on the Linns' bench dur
ing games.
Rick Casares, veteran full
back for the Chicago Bears, and
Bob St. Clair. San Francisco
Forty Niners tackle, were given
a clean bill of health from ru
mors that they had associated
with gambling elements.
An investigation is being con
tinued regarding allegations that
President Carroll Rosenbloom of
the Baltimore Colts bet on league
games during a period eight to
10 years ago.
HOZKLLK, chain-smoking at
yesterday’s conference and obvi
ously somewhat tense, stressed
his investigation turned up “no
evidence that any NFL player
has given less than his best in
playing any game.”
“There is no evidence that any
player has ever bet against his
own team.” he added, “and there
is no evidence that any NFL
player has sold information to
gamblers.”
But, Rozelle hastily pointed out,
there was “clear evidence” some
NFL players knowingly carried
on undesirable associations which
in some instances, led to their
betting on their own team.
And there was also clear evi
dence, the commissioner added,
that many players have been too
free in passing along information
concerning their team to friends
and acquaintances.
POSSIBLY the biggest shock
to come out of the entire investi
gation was Hornung’s involve
ment.
“1 made a terrible mistake,”
Hornung said contritely. “I real
ize this now. I am truly sorry.
What else is there to say.”
