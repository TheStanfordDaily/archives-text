# Sprinters, Distance Men Impress in Practice
## 
### 
A 9.6 100-yard dash by Eric
Frische and a sparkling 2:50.6
three-quarter mile by Bob Miltz
highlighted practice this week as
the Stanford trackmen prepared
for their toughest dual meet of
the year against USC this Satur
day.
Three sprinters behind Frische
were clocked in 9.7 seconds, in
cluding Larry Questad, who last
week became the second fastest
Stanford sprinter in history with
a 9.5 lime. The duel between
these two and USC’s two 9.5
sprinters, Dick Cortese and Dave
Morris, should he one of the
greatest of the year.

I tance men in an encouraging
showing, missing the school 1320-

Close behind were Harlan An

(3:01.1) and a host of others.
With the likes of USC’s Julio
Marin (4:04.7, 8:50.2 1 in the mile

I and two-mile and Kevin Hogan
(1:50.3) in the 880, nothing less
(than superb performances will
| win for the Indians. According to
coach Payton Jordan, miler-two
i miler Harry McCalla is in better
shape than he was in practice
last week, when he ran a blazing
I 4:01.5 mile against Oregon. With
j Marin to push him, McCalla could
break four minutes Saturday, a
j feat no Stanford runner has ever
i accomplished.
QUARTER MIL E R Ken
j Emanuels ran a 48.0 lap this
j week, his fastest yet in practice,
i However, against USC’s two sub

47 second men, Emanuels will
have to run by far his best race
to have any chance to finish bel
ter than third.
Hurdler Steve Cortright has
been doing mostly speed work
(he ran a 9.8 100 Monday) in
preparation for two of the best

high hurdles men in the nation.
Brian Polkinghorne and Bob

Javelin thrower Dan Prono has

Shot putters Steve Arch and
Jack Chappie have looked great
all week, and a 1-2 sweep against
the Trojans is quite possible.
Jordan has announced a change
in the mile relay squad. Ken Fra

A 9.6 100-yard dash by Eric
Frische and a sparkling 2:50.6
three-quarter mile by Bob Miltz
highlighted practice this week as
the Stanford trackmen prepared
for their toughest dual meet of
the year against USC this Satur
day.
Three sprinters behind Frische
were clocked in 9.7 seconds, in
cluding Larry Questad, who last
week became the second fastest
Stanford sprinter in history with
a 9.5 lime. The duel between
these two and USC’s two 9.5
sprinters, Dick Cortese and Dave
Morris, should he one of the
greatest of the year.
MILT/ LEI) a group of dis-

I tance men in an encouraging
showing, missing the school 1320-
yd. record by only 2.3 seconds.
Close behind were Harlan An
drews (2:591, Robin Ruble
(3:01.1) and a host of others.
With the likes of USC’s Julio
Marin (4:04.7, 8:50.2 1 in the mile

I and two-mile and Kevin Hogan
(1:50.3) in the 880, nothing less
(than superb performances will
| win for the Indians. According to
coach Payton Jordan, miler-two
i miler Harry McCalla is in better
shape than he was in practice
last week, when he ran a blazing
I 4:01.5 mile against Oregon. With
j Marin to push him, McCalla could
break four minutes Saturday, a
j feat no Stanford runner has ever
i accomplished.
QUARTER MIL E R Ken
j Emanuels ran a 48.0 lap this
j week, his fastest yet in practice,
i However, against USC’s two sub

47 second men, Emanuels will
have to run by far his best race
to have any chance to finish bel
ter than third.
Hurdler Steve Cortright has
been doing mostly speed work
(he ran a 9.8 100 Monday) in
preparation for two of the best

high hurdles men in the nation.
Brian Polkinghorne and Bob
Pierce.
Javelin thrower Dan Prono has
been consistently around the
195-foot mark. He is being count
ed on by Jordan for a second
place Saturday.
Shot putters Steve Arch and
Jack Chappie have looked great
all week, and a 1-2 sweep against
the Trojans is quite possible.
Jordan has announced a change
in the mile relay squad. Ken Fra
ser, Len Breschini, Gary Walker,
and Skip Amos will be running
in place of the regulars.
