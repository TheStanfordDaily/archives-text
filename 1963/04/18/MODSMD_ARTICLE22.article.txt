# Golfers Go to Cal Friday for 7th Dual
## 
### 
The Stanford golf team goes
seeking its seventh straight dual
match victory tomorrow on the
University of California course.
The Golden Bears finished one
stroke up on Stanford in the Pas
atiempo tournament last week
end, but the Indians suffered an
unusually poor opening day. If
Stanford regains the poise and
consistency of their opening dual
matches, they could very well
come back to beat the Bears.
On Saturday, the varsity will
meet the Stanford Golf Club in a
showdown of supremacy on the
Stanford course at 12:30.
