# Frosh Pin Hopes on Distance, Field Men Against Speedy SJS
## 
### 
It will take a strong showing
in the distance and field events
for the freshman track team to
get past the powerful San Jose
Slate frosh thinclads in this af
ternoon’s dual meet beginning at
4 p.m. at Angell Field.
In last week’s meet with Col
lege of the Sequoias. Dave Deub
ner and Boh Stoecker accounted
for five victories between them,
Deubner in the mile, two-mile,
and 880. and Stoecker in the dis
cus and shot. But today Deubner
will probably compete in only the
mile and two-mile events and
Stanford hopes will ride on Bill
Klipperl in the 880. Stoecker. who
last year held the national high
school record in the discus, is ex
pected to repeat wins in both his
strong events.
Another' consistent standout on
the frosh team, John Goode, is
scheduled to compete in the hop
step-and-jump. which he won last
week; in the broad jump; and in
the high jump. Expected to score
heavily in the pole vault is Chuck
Smith, who holds the frosh rec
ord at 14’6”. George Porter in the
javelin and high jumper Sam
Kipp are also top entries for the
frosh in the field events.
But when the gun goes off for
the splints, the Tribe will have
to be thankful for all the points
gained in the field events, for in
the 100 and 220 San Jose State
will be close to unbeatable.
Although the frosh have won
all three of their triangular meets

[this season, they will be looking
I for their first dual meet victory
this afternoon, having lost to
College of the Sequoias and San
, Mateo in earlier outings.


BOB STOECKER, the national high school discus champion, is ex
pected to win both the discus and shot put events in today's meet
with the San Jose Freshmen.


DAVE DEUBNER, potentially the
finest distance man to compete
for Stanford, will run the mile
and the two-mile today against
San Jose State.
