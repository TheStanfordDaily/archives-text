# Students Reject NSA Membership Due to Political, Financial Problems
## 
### MIRIAM BETENSKY 
Dissatisfaction with the National Student Association has re
sulted in disaffiliation or consideration of same in universities
across the country.
Harvard, the University of Texas and Xavier University have
all seen dehate over NSA in the last few months. Main opposition
stemmed from the tyoe and de*+ ■

greo of political involvement de
sired and the manner of selecting
the school’s delegates to NSA
conventions.
THU FURrOSK of the NSA is
to make students aware of the
educational and social issues
which affect them and to encour
age creative action. A national
congress is held each summer,
and throughout the year the na
tional and regional NSA bodies
conduct conferences and semi
nars on such issues as race rela
tions and academic freedom.
The Harvard Council for Un
dergraduate Affairs voted in late
March to continue its member
ship by a vote of eleven to five.
Council members had objected to
remaining in the NSA because of
its political activities.
A Crimson editorial stated that
the important question should
not be whether Harvard should
remain in the NSA, but rather
how to select live representatives
to the annual congress and how
Harvard could most effectively
relate to the organization.
SAID TIIK Crimson, “NSA has
failed to exert a real influence at
Harvard largely because many of
its educational purposes are
achieved through political groups,
publications, and the critical-re
flective atmosphere of the Col
lege itself.’’ Opposition to the
group was often based on their
concern with “political questions
not relevant to student govern
ment.” Counterargument ran
(hat not only should students be
concerned with issues that affect
them as students, but also with
general political questions.
The University of Texas
dropped membership in the NSA
by a student referendum in early
April with 59 per cent favoring
the move. Texas dropped out of
NSA in 1952. after a student ref
erendum, but joined again in
1954 after action by the Student
Assembly.
Selection of delegates was a big
issue. The NSA was also attack
ed on the grounds it is "undemo

eratie, unrepresentative, and a
political organization.” It was
also charged the association is
over-represented by liberals and
Eastern schools.
IN' A SPECIAL election Xavier
also discontinued its membership
in the NSA by a vote of two to
one. The decision ended 18
months of sometimes stormy de
bate. The controversy centered
around political activities and fi
nancial matters.
Proponents stated that mem
bership would enhance the
school’s national stature, provide
communication with other
schools, and bring in new ideas.
Opponents charged that the
group is "dominated by the left
wing, controlled by non-student
groups, and that it could do noth
ing for Xavier that Xavier could
not do for itself.”
