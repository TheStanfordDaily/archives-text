# Kerr Forbids Race Clauses In Cal Frats
## 
### HOPE SELBY 
University of California Presi
dent Clark Kerr yesterday or
dered all fraternities and sorori
ties on the seven Cal campuses
to drop racial and discriminatory
clauses from their constitutions
by September 1, 1964.
Kerr gave deans on all the
campuses power to enforce the
ruling by taking action against
fraternities and sororities refus
ing to comply by the above date.
MANY OF the 47 fraternities
and 22 sororities on the Berkeley
campus are affiliated with na
tional organizations whose con
stitutions discriminate against
minority groups. A spokesman
for the The Daily Californian,
however, stated that the names
of the fraternities and sororities
with discriminatory clauses arc
kept confidential in files of the
dean of students.
Yesterday the Interfraternity
Council elected as president Tom
Hobday, who plans to work with
national organizations to allevi
ate the problem.
No action has been taken as of
yet by the sororities.
