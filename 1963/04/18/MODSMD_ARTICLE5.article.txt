# Frosh Play Major Role in Con Drive
## 
### JIM ROGERS 
Cardinals' Hoard Chairman
Each year Stanford students
participate in Convalescent Home
Drive sponsored by Cardinals’
Board to solicit money lb provide
for the maintance costs of Con
valescent Home, a non-profit or
ganization. Every year 65 chil
dren, most of whom have chronic
diseases or physical disabilities,

are able to profit from treatments
and use of therapeutic equipment
under the supervision of about
100 trained staff members at the
Con Home.
Children have boon going to the
Home since the early 1920s and
Stanford students have played a
vital role since its beginning by
their support, whether by (he Con
Home Drive or the Big Brother
program of the Stanford Volun
teers. The Stanford Convalescent
Home furnishes hospital facilities
and a rehabilitation program for
the major chronic illnesses and
disabling conditions of childhood
and adolescence. The homo is
open to any child from about the
ages of two to 16.
AVAILABLE in the program
of rehabilitation arc' the integrat
ed activities of pediatricians, or
thopedists, a specailist in physical
medicine, nurses, social workers,
physical therapists, school teach
ers, recreational workers, clinical
psychologist, and where needed,
speech and psychiatric consulta
tion and therapy. The goal is to
enable a child previously handi
capped to the point that he is un
able to function successfully in a
normal life situation, to be re
turned to his own environment
capable of successful living with
his family and his nonhandi
capped peers.
The fee for this care is based
on a sliding scale depending upon
the financial status of the par
ent. The Convalescent Home is a
non-profit corporation and the
maximum fee is never more than

the actual cost of care. The Stan
ford Convalescent Home Drive
is to defer the amount of cost of
this care in order that those chil
dren who need special attention
can receive it at absolute mini
mum cost to their parents.
Thus the purpose of the drive
for Con Home next week is to
raise money by solicitations on
and off campus to defer the main
tancc cost of the Home. Last
year SI 1,000 was raised; this year
the goal is $12,000. The methods
to gain this goal are three: H the
activities sponsored by various
living groups and classes, 2) the
on campus solicitation by living
group and the most important, 3)
off campus solicitations. The lat
ter method raises each year over
%ths of the total goal. Thus it is
apparent why so much emphasis
is placed upon it.
OFF CAMPUS solicitation each
year is in the hands of the Fresh
man. Plans are made by the co
chairmen, this year Edie Dunn
and Bruce Pruitt, well before Win
ter Quarter. Chairmen are ap
pointed in each of the freshmen
living groups who in turn appoint
corridor and floor chairmen.
Con Home Drive solicitation
will begin next Monday and run
through Saturday. Freshmen are
to see their individual corridor
chairmen about more details. The
success of the drive and the abil
ity of Con Home itself to function
at a moderate cost to all children
depends on the response of the
freshmen and the genei’osity of
the upper-classmen.

off campus solicitations. The lat
ter method raises each year over
%ths of the total goal. Thus it is
apparent why so much emphasis
is placed upon it.
OFF CAMPUS solicitation each
year is in the hands of the Fresh
man. Plans are made by the co
chairmen, this year Edie Dunn
and Bruce Pruitt, well before Win
ter Quarter. Chairmen are ap
pointed in each of the freshmen
living groups who in turn appoint
corridor and floor chairmen.
Con Home Drive solicitation
will begin next Monday and run
through Saturday. Freshmen are
to see their individual corridor
chairmen about more details. The
success of the drive and the abil
ity of Con Home itself to function
at a moderate cost to all children
depends on the response of the
freshmen and the genei’osity of
the upper-classmen.
Cardinals' Hoard Chairman
Each year Stanford students
participate in Convalescent Home
Drive sponsored by Cardinals’
Board to solicit money lb provide
for the maintance costs of Con
valescent Home, a non-profit or
ganization. Every year 65 chil
dren, most of whom have chronic
diseases or physical disabilities,

are able to profit from treatments
and use of therapeutic equipment
under the supervision of about
100 trained staff members at the
Con Home.
Children have boon going to the
Home since the early 1920s and
Stanford students have played a
vital role since its beginning by
their support, whether by (he Con
Home Drive or the Big Brother
program of the Stanford Volun
teers. The Stanford Convalescent
Home furnishes hospital facilities
and a rehabilitation program for
the major chronic illnesses and
disabling conditions of childhood
and adolescence. The homo is
open to any child from about the
ages of two to 16.
AVAILABLE in the program
of rehabilitation arc' the integrat
ed activities of pediatricians, or
thopedists, a specailist in physical
medicine, nurses, social workers,
physical therapists, school teach
ers, recreational workers, clinical
psychologist, and where needed,
speech and psychiatric consulta
tion and therapy. The goal is to
enable a child previously handi
capped to the point that he is un
able to function successfully in a
normal life situation, to be re
turned to his own environment
capable of successful living with
his family and his nonhandi
capped peers.
The fee for this care is based
on a sliding scale depending upon
the financial status of the par
ent. The Convalescent Home is a
non-profit corporation and the
maximum fee is never more than

the actual cost of care. The Stan
ford Convalescent Home Drive
is to defer the amount of cost of
this care in order that those chil
dren who need special attention
can receive it at absolute mini
mum cost to their parents.
Thus the purpose of the drive
for Con Home next week is to
raise money by solicitations on
and off campus to defer the main
tancc cost of the Home. Last
year SI 1,000 was raised; this year
the goal is $12,000. The methods
to gain this goal are three: H the
activities sponsored by various
living groups and classes, 2) the
on campus solicitation by living
group and the most important, 3)
off campus solicitations. The lat
ter method raises each year over
%ths of the total goal. Thus it is
