# Williamson: Freedom Readies Students for Self-Government
## 
### ANN TODD 
“Freedom is given not that man may do as he pleases but that
he may learn to govern himself,” stated E. G. Williamson, Dean
of Students at the University of Minnesota, yesterday, in his
speech on “Academic Freedom of Students.”
Williamson, in the second speech of the Stanford Today and

Tomorrow Scries, insisted that
academic freedom of students is
the heart of the liberal arts, and
that if “we” intend to revitalize
these liberal arts, “we” must as
sure this freedom.
This freedom, however, is not
clearly defined, admitted William-

son. There are
four competing
concepts of free
dom. He sum
marized these
freedoms as :
freedom from
restraint, free
dom from ac
c o un t a b i lity,
freedom to do as
one pleases, and
freedom within
restraint.

Elaborating on these concepts,
Williamson said, that freedom
from restraint means that there
are no limits except those de
fined by the individual student
himself. Democracy and self-rule
are considered synonymous.
Freedom from accountability, the
second concept, centers on the
right, ignoring responsibilities;
freedom to do as one pleases
equates democracy with license.
The last concept, freedom within
restraint, realizes that freedom
is learned and earned.
TODAY, THERE are four cru
cial issues of academic freedom
for students,” continued William
son. “First of all, students want
to be free to discuss topics of
their own choosing. They want
no restrictions to topics under
discussion; this springs from the
freedom to do as they please.”
“Students also want to be free
to hear speakers of their choice
on topics of their choice. This is
commonly called the freedom to
hear and listen. Thirdly, they
want freedom of editorial and
journalistic comment. This is at
the very basis of academic free
dom, for only so long as the criti
cal faculty is stimulated will free
dom survive.
