This statement on the Stanford
Today and Tomorrow Forum was
released by Student Body Presi
dent Armin Rosencranz yester
day:
“The student conference on the
revitalization of the Liberal Arts
was conceived on a note of in
quiry. It has been resolved to
approach the close of the year
not with self-satisfaction in the
solutions which students have
helped bring about, but with a
determination to raise new and
important questions about the
idea and the ideal of a university.
“NO TIME COULD bo riper
than the present to have a discus
sion at Stanford on the goals of a
liberal education. In the last ten
years, Stanford has grown as
much intellectually as it has
physically. The eminence of its
faculty is constantly increasing
and the kind of student that
comes here today is far more ded
icated than ever before to aca
demic excellence, intellectual
achievement and public service.
“At the same time, some mem
bers of the academic community,
particularly students, have been
concerned over the prevailing
‘one’ of the University. We all
seem more involved with fulfill
ing requirements, meeting com
mitments. and accepting respons
ibilities rather than with raising
questions, inquiring, challenging
assumptions, fighting complacen
cy and smugness, and pursuing
the search for truth. This has tra
ditionally been the main work of
academic communities and it is
somewhat disappointing that,
scholarly research excepted, the
note of search and inquiry seems
not overly important here. Too
often we seem content with easy
answers instead of posing hard
questions, the answers to which
we may seek all our lives.
“This year students have begun
to ask, perhaps more sharply and
more persistently than in the
past, what the purpose of liberal
education is and ought to be, and
what constitutes the educational
process. Wo have begun to seek
identity and commitment rather
than merely meeting established
requirements and accepting es

tablished policies. One of the en
deavors to which many students
have committed themselves is the
elimination of needless restraints
on student expression and other
phases of student life. The pur
pose of this endeavor has been
not to promote anarchy but rath
er to encourage diversity, to stim
ulate disagreement and dissent,
on the theory that this kind of
ferment is a catalyst to intellectu
al inquiry.
“THE MEN BROUGHT here to
participate in this conference will
continue the important and on
going discussion about the goals
of the university and the role of
the students within it.
“Much that has been accom
plished this year is attributable
to the farsightedness of the Pres
ident and Trustees. This evening
at 7:30 in Memorial Auditorium,
Henry Steele Commager, per
haps the most eminent American
historian, will talk about the re
sponsibility of the board of trus
tees in shaping liberal education.
