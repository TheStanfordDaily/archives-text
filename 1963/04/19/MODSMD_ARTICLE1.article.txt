# Commager Cites Responsibility, Powers of Governing Board
## 
### NORMAN REITZ 
The governing hoard, a characteristic common to American
colleges, is the, power behind the administration, said Henry Steele
Commager in his lecture last night on “The Responsibility of Cov
erning Boards.” But it is plagued, he said, with the problem John
Adams expressed when he became Vice-President, “Gentlemen, will

please tell me what I am to do.” -
Commager defined the major
areas of responsibility of the gov
erning board: 1 • they act as trus
tees of the facilities of the univer
sity, 2) they choose the college
president, 3) they develop the ed
ucational philosophy of the uni
versity, 4) they are to protect that
university from inordinate out
side pressures and to preserve
academic freedom, and 5) they
are to decide what donations are
to be accepted and how they are
to be used.
STATE INSTITUTIONS have
a Board of Regents which are
usually elected and are subject to
public opinion or a State Super
intendent of Schools. The regents
are in an unstable position, he
said, because, “They have no
place to go except out.”
The private university is more
fortunate, he said, because it has
a Board of Trustees which is usu
ally self-perpetuating. The Board
is an autonomous body and in
place of public pressure it has
alumni and prospective donors to
cope with.
The governing board, along
with the students and faculty, are
three segments of a four-fold di
vision in which administrative
work is loft to a group of profes
sional overseers called “The Ad
ministration.”
The lack of student and faculty
involvement in running the Uni
versity can be traced, he said, to
the initial formation of the Amer
ican University system. The first
American universities were
church-sponsored and were sub
ject to strict control. Students and
faculty had little leeway within
the confines of a school system
modeled on a particular set of
principles.

with the European universities
which were originally formed, di

ties still retain many duties rele
gated in American colleges to
non-faculty staff.

cessive grade-consciousness is re

as irresponsible children, and 3)
the administration thwarts their
potential “by giving them games
to play,” i.e. the fraternity-sorori
ty game and the athletic game.
THE AMERICAN college stu
dent, he said, must re-direct his
energies from trivialities and lr
relevancies" to important issues
in order to win the right to share
in university control.
The college president deserves
sympathy and support, Comma
gor said. The president is to be
the main money raiser, chief cere
monial officer, spokesman to the
public, a sometimes profound
scholar, and administrator. It is,
he said, “an impossible job.”

STATE INSTITUTIONS have
a Board of Regents which are
usually elected and are subject to
public opinion or a State Super
intendent of Schools. The regents
are in an unstable position, he
said, because, “They have no
place to go except out.”
The private university is more
fortunate, he said, because it has
a Board of Trustees which is usu
ally self-perpetuating. The Board
is an autonomous body and in
place of public pressure it has
alumni and prospective donors to
cope with.
The governing board, along

three segments of a four-fold di

work is loft to a group of profes

The lack of student and faculty
involvement in running the Uni
