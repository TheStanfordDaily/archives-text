## 'Our Absurd Lecture System' 
### VERNE REAVES 
The lecture is considered the basic unit around which un
dergraduate education is oriented. Yet, as I hope to show, the
“necessity” and "usefulness” of lectures are very for from being
self-evident or even logically defensible.
In a typical lecture-hour, the professor attempts to summa
rize, clarify, or supplement the assigned readings; there is no
class discussion. The lecture is a not-always coherent, too-sel
dom interesting, monologue. In short, this kind of lecturer is a
talking book, the important words of which are being under
lined, as it were, by the student taking notes. The advantages
of the written word its permanence, its usually having been
well thought-out, its availability in the sense that it can be
read over the spoken word being clear, it follows that, in an
age when mimeograph machines, books, and paperbacks are
common and inexpensive, the spoken lecture is an archaic and
inefficient mode of communication. The summarization and sup
plementation of assigned readings can easily be done by any stu
dent on his own, with the added advantage of having his activi
ties translated from the passive to the active note.
The clarification of assigned readings is another matter: it
is the one defensible activity of the teacher-as-teacher, and it
logically requires a dialogue between the teacher and student,
and between student and student. Outside of Honors Programs,
dialogues occur when the teacher devotes part of his lecture
hour to discussion, or in seminars. Simply because of size, the
latter form of inter-action is preferable. An obvious question
arises, however: how can a lecture-class of five-hundred be re
duced to seminar size? The answer is that many lectures of this
size have teaching assistants who lead discussion-groups, and
some of these groups are taught by the professors themselves.
Furthermore, and to meet other obvious objections, I refuse to
believe that a university with as many resources as Stanford
could neither hear (he financial burden or hiring so many teach
ers, nor that these teaching-assistants could not be preselected
primarily for their competence in teaching.
It may also be objected that lectures provide a unique op
portunity for the student to hear and see “great” professors,
to have their imaginations kindled in the presence of dynamic
thinkers. If this is true, it would only be more true in a semi
nar, or in lecture-discussions where the “great” teacher can re
spond to student’s questions. For too often, when even a “great”
professor is relegated to the role of monologist, we soon find
our initial liking of his quality as an entertainer giving way to
the realization that this goes on at the expense of learning: too
often are students constrained or content to merely bask in the
reflected light of “greatness” rather than having the time or the
motivations to try to attain it for themselves.
Lastly, if what has been argued above is considered true, two
more conclusions are forced upon us which are worth consider
ing: a) that students who, upon serious reflection, decide they
are getting little or nothing from certain lectures, should have
the right, even the duty, to be absent and devote their extra time
to pertinent outside reading; and b) that any teacher who de
signs his final examination so as to penalize the student who has
chosen not to attend all the lectures, is a sadist.

well thought-out, its availability in the sense that it can be
read over the spoken word being clear, it follows that, in an
age when mimeograph machines, books, and paperbacks are
common and inexpensive, the spoken lecture is an archaic and
inefficient mode of communication. The summarization and sup
plementation of assigned readings can easily be done by any stu
dent on his own, with the added advantage of having his activi
ties translated from the passive to the active note.
The clarification of assigned readings is another matter: it
is the one defensible activity of the teacher-as-teacher, and it
logically requires a dialogue between the teacher and student,
and between student and student. Outside of Honors Programs,
dialogues occur when the teacher devotes part of his lecture
hour to discussion, or in seminars. Simply because of size, the
latter form of inter-action is preferable. An obvious question
arises, however: how can a lecture-class of five-hundred be re
duced to seminar size? The answer is that many lectures of this
size have teaching assistants who lead discussion-groups, and
some of these groups are taught by the professors themselves.
Furthermore, and to meet other obvious objections, I refuse to
believe that a university with as many resources as Stanford
could neither hear (he financial burden or hiring so many teach
ers, nor that these teaching-assistants could not be preselected
primarily for their competence in teaching.
It may also be objected that lectures provide a unique op
portunity for the student to hear and see “great” professors,
to have their imaginations kindled in the presence of dynamic
thinkers. If this is true, it would only be more true in a semi
nar, or in lecture-discussions where the “great” teacher can re
spond to student’s questions. For too often, when even a “great”
professor is relegated to the role of monologist, we soon find
our initial liking of his quality as an entertainer giving way to
the realization that this goes on at the expense of learning: too
often are students constrained or content to merely bask in the
reflected light of “greatness” rather than having the time or the
motivations to try to attain it for themselves.
Lastly, if what has been argued above is considered true, two
more conclusions are forced upon us which are worth consider
ing: a) that students who, upon serious reflection, decide they
are getting little or nothing from certain lectures, should have
the right, even the duty, to be absent and devote their extra time
to pertinent outside reading; and b) that any teacher who de
signs his final examination so as to penalize the student who has
chosen not to attend all the lectures, is a sadist.
The lecture is considered the basic unit around which un
dergraduate education is oriented. Yet, as I hope to show, the
“necessity” and "usefulness” of lectures are very for from being
self-evident or even logically defensible.
In a typical lecture-hour, the professor attempts to summa
rize, clarify, or supplement the assigned readings; there is no
class discussion. The lecture is a not-always coherent, too-sel
dom interesting, monologue. In short, this kind of lecturer is a
talking book, the important words of which are being under
lined, as it were, by the student taking notes. The advantages
of the written word its permanence, its usually having been
well thought-out, its availability in the sense that it can be
read over the spoken word being clear, it follows that, in an
