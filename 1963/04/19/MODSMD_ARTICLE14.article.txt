## Unemployment and Wage Rates 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
The first report on manpower, which the President trans
mitted to Congress, raises a question about unemployment to
which there is no obvious answer. Why is it that for five con
secutive years since 1957—both under Eisenhower and under
Kennedy—the average rate of unemployment, 5.5 per cent, has
been so much higher than it was in the years immediately after
the war, when the average rate was less than 4 per cent.
Moreover, in the past 10 years, there have been three busi
ness recessions; and after each recovery, the rate of unemploy
ment has been higher than after the preceding recovery. These
facts indicate, as the Labor Department study accompanying
the President’s report puts it, that in recent years the American
economy has been moving away from full employment rather
than toward it.
It was by studying this gloomy situation that the adminis
tration came to the conclusion that corporate and individual in
come taxes are so high that they are depressing consumer de
mand and spending for capital investment. Though I believe
wholly that this is a sound conclusion, I am moved to ask
whether the administration remedy for economic stagnation is
adequate. What moves mo to ask this question is a reading of
two lectures by the managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, Mr. Per Jacobsson, one delivered at New York
University and the other at the American Bankers Association
meeting in Washington.
In reading these lectures, we must begin by remembering
that Mr. Jacobsson is a very distinguished Swedish economist,
whose ideas descend from the same original source as those of
John Maynard Keynes. Mr. Jacobsson, therefore, is in favor of
the prescription, which comes from Keynes, that in order to
overcome the sluggishness of an economy it is necessary to
expand the demand for goods and services.
Where Mr. Jacobsson differs from the administration pro
gram is not about the tax cut and the budgetary deficit. He dif
fers about wage policy. In substance, he says that, while ex
panding demand can stimulate growth, it will not cure unem
ployment unless it is accompanied by a freezing of production
costs and particularly wage rates. If I read him correctly, he
says that it is quite possible to stimulate the growth of the
economy without making much of an impression on unemploy
ment. It is very interesting and quite significant that Mr.
Jacobsson cites as his authority none other than John Maynard
Keynes himself.
Keynes, he says, thought that, while it is necessary that
“demand should be increased,” he was no less insistent that
“in time of marked unemployment, money wages should be
kept stable for unemployment to be reduced.” As a matter of
fact, Lord Keynes went further than that. In his celebrated
book. “The General Theory of Employment,” Keynes declared
that in a given organization, equipment and technology, real
wages and output are uniquely correlated so that “in general,
an increase in employment can only occur to the accompani
ment of a decline in the rate of real wages.” This decline in
real wages would happen if money wages are frozen (while
business is slack i while prices rise during th,e period of recov
ery from the recession.
Mr. Jacobsson’s view, and even more that of Lord Keynes,
differs from that of the administration in this respect. The ad
ministration has been trying, and with considerable success, to
keep wage increases from exceeding the rise in the productivity
of labor. Mr. Jacobsson's view is that this policy will not lead
to the same reduction in unemployment as would be achieved
if, during the expansion of demand, money wage rates were kept
consistent or rising more slowly than productivity.
Mr. Jacobsson argues that this unpopular remedy for un
employment is necessary because, in the past few years, we have
been in a "new situation.” The post-war inflation has worked
itself off; since 1959, wholesale prices have been practically
stable, and the cost of living has not risen much.
During the inflationary years, individual firms could grant
wage increases because they could raise prices without a decline
in their sales. But with inflation ended, most firms cannot raise
prices without a decline in their sales. But with inflation ended,
most firms cannot raise prices without losing sales and there
fore reducing their profit margins. In this kind of situation, Mr.
Jacobsson believes, it is not possible to cure unemployment
merely by cutting taxes and expanding demand. It is necessary,
also, to stabilize labor costs.
Needless to say. this is an unpopular remedy. As evidence
of it, there is Governor Rockefeller’s recent statement about
economic growth. He, too, wants to expand demand by cutting
taxes. But he is discreetly silent about wage policy.
An analysis of the figures shows why the country is more
likely to put up with the existing unemployment that to brace
itself to the disagreeable remedy which Keynes and Jacobsson
recommend. Who are the unemployed? In the main, they are
the politically feeble. They are young people, many of them
without votes. They are the older workei’s. They are Negroes.
They are workers in declining and unstable industries and in the
depressed areas. They are, in general, unskilled workers. There
are some 4 million of them, not counting another 2.5 million who
are partially employed.
All of them together are not a politically formidable group;
and as long as they are taken care of, neither party is likely to
take on the kind of opposition which the Jacobsson-Keynes for
mula would arouse.
