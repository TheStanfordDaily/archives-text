Editors, The Daily:
I was not surprised to read Mr. Seifert’s plea for the Legis
lature to “disband in protest and direct their energies else
where,” but I believe that before we disband, we should see what
we are disbanding.
This year a major campaign was carried through by stu
dent leaders. At its close a compromise was made—student gov
ernment had its new structure, but was denied its all-important
“freedom to speak out.” I answer the protestations on the with
holding of this freedom with the words of our recent visitor,
Dean Williamson of Minnesota. “Freedom is learned and
earned.”
The Administration has given the student body and govern
ment a somewhat new organization. This organization is pres
ently concerned with the weeding out of stagnant parts of its
old self and the instilling of new life in its dying organs. The
major attribute of the new organization is its “newness.” This
“newness” allows strong and hard-working individuals a freedom
to speak and instill new meaning and purpose.
Student government’s lack of originality, and spirit has
plagued the Stanford Campus for years, producing a weak com
munication between administrators and students. Students have
felt for the last few years that the only way to get things done
was through mob reaction. “Show ’em the students want it.”
But this method often tends to alienate the people you are trying
to impress. Administrators will not allow students more “free
dom” when students have not evolved a responsible organ to
control that freedom.
These are the reasons which make me ask members of
Legislature and interested parties to see what they would dis
band and think over the consequences. We have gained new life,
but have not also reecived the rewards of maturity. We must
produce a mature, sophisticated and self-revitalizing student
body before we deserve those rewards. For these reasons, don’t
junk a ship because you think it un-seaworthy; repair it, and
sail it in shallow water first.

In William Moore’s article of Monday, April 15. on Gov.
Rockefeller's candidacy, he attaches vast importance to the six
biggest industrial states. This raises the question: why is it
necessary that a Republican Presidential candidate carry these
industrial states?
William A, Rusher, in a recent “National Review” article
i Crossroads for the GOP,” NR, Feb. 12, 1963) contends that by
bidding for the Southern electoral votes, the Republican Party
can offset the inevitable Kennedy conquests in the big indus
trial states of the North and still stand a serious chance of win
ning the election.”
Mr. Moore states that the South is “already conceded to
Kennedy. Perhaps so, if Kennedy’s opponent is Rockefeller.
But a conservative Republican, of the stamp of Sen. Goldwater,
would have an excellent chance of carrying enough Southern
states to effect the result described by William Rusher,

But this method often tends to alienate the people you are trying
to impress. Administrators will not allow students more “free
dom” when students have not evolved a responsible organ to
control that freedom.
These are the reasons which make me ask members of
Legislature and interested parties to see what they would dis
band and think over the consequences. We have gained new life,
but have not also reecived the rewards of maturity. We must
produce a mature, sophisticated and self-revitalizing student
body before we deserve those rewards. For these reasons, don’t
junk a ship because you think it un-seaworthy; repair it, and
sail it in shallow water first.

In William Moore’s article of Monday, April 15. on Gov.
Rockefeller's candidacy, he attaches vast importance to the six
biggest industrial states. This raises the question: why is it
necessary that a Republican Presidential candidate carry these
industrial states?
William A, Rusher, in a recent “National Review” article
i Crossroads for the GOP,” NR, Feb. 12, 1963) contends that by
bidding for the Southern electoral votes, the Republican Party
can offset the inevitable Kennedy conquests in the big indus
trial states of the North and still stand a serious chance of win
ning the election.”
Mr. Moore states that the South is “already conceded to
Kennedy. Perhaps so, if Kennedy’s opponent is Rockefeller.
But a conservative Republican, of the stamp of Sen. Goldwater,
would have an excellent chance of carrying enough Southern
states to effect the result described by William Rusher,

I was not surprised to read Mr. Seifert’s plea for the Legis
lature to “disband in protest and direct their energies else
where,” but I believe that before we disband, we should see what
we are disbanding.
This year a major campaign was carried through by stu
dent leaders. At its close a compromise was made—student gov
ernment had its new structure, but was denied its all-important
“freedom to speak out.” I answer the protestations on the with
holding of this freedom with the words of our recent visitor,
Dean Williamson of Minnesota. “Freedom is learned and
earned.”
The Administration has given the student body and govern
ment a somewhat new organization. This organization is pres
ently concerned with the weeding out of stagnant parts of its
old self and the instilling of new life in its dying organs. The
major attribute of the new organization is its “newness.” This
“newness” allows strong and hard-working individuals a freedom
to speak and instill new meaning and purpose.
Student government’s lack of originality, and spirit has
plagued the Stanford Campus for years, producing a weak com
munication between administrators and students. Students have
felt for the last few years that the only way to get things done
was through mob reaction. “Show ’em the students want it.”
But this method often tends to alienate the people you are trying
to impress. Administrators will not allow students more “free
dom” when students have not evolved a responsible organ to
control that freedom.
These are the reasons which make me ask members of
