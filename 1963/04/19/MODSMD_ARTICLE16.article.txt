## Symbol for the Nuclear Age 
### RICHARD SUCH 
One seeks a symbol for the nu
clear age; optimistically, he takes
the atomic power plant or the
UN Building more likely, he
takes the mushroom cloud or the
fallout shelter. There are other
possible symbols, the guided
missile for example, but perhaps
the most powerful, because it en
ters most directly into our daily
lives, is the fallout shelter. It was
inevitable, therefore, that some
reaction would bo brought about
by the University’s not entirely
undevious provision of such fa
cilities in the absence of the Stu
dent Body. As a symbol, the fall
out shelter is capable of evoking
the whole range of Cold-War
emotions—from intense revulsion
of a moral sort, through a sense
of wombish security at the ma
ternal solicitude of the Defense
Department, to a positive glee at
the prospect of being among the
favored few to escape the death
and destruction which would
abound in a thermonuclear war.

The emotional reaction may be
basic, but it does not stand alone:
I intend to suggest that there are
very good reasons for the moral
revulsion expressed by the sign
ors a petition requesting the re
moval of the now shelters, that
these reasons obscure any others
which might assign sufficient
value to the shelters to argue for
their retention, and that, inci
dentally, it is ignorance of these
reasons which keeps the issue
largely on the emotional plane,
creates the contradictory atti
tudes and complacency which
prevent the issue from being
squarely confronted, and causes
the issue to be resolved or ig
nored on the grounds of expedi
ency, rather than a rationality or
morality.
IT IS FIRST necessary to meet
an objection which levels itself
not against the conclusions of
this inquiry, but against the in
quiry itself: What difference
does it make whether the shelters
are here or not?—why even talk
about it? The answer to this ob
jection is that while the presence
of shelters on the Stanford cam
pus may or may not make any
real difference, it makes a very

great symbolic difference, for
the acceptance of the particular
Stanford shelter implies accept
ance of the general institution of
shelters, while the rejection of
the Stanford shelter implies re
jection of the generality of shel
ters. So my argument is address
ed against the institution of fall
out shelters, even though I shall
find the Stanford shelter a use
ful illustration. I might counter
this objection in another way by
calling attention to its element of
abstentionism—the moral and in
tellectual lethargy which refuses
to inform itself of those issues
which have an immediate bearing
not only on one’s own life or
death but on the life or death of
countless others, the silly noncha
lance that renounces the respon
sibilities concomitant with one’s
status as a free and mature per
son. And, as another starting
point, I shall assume that this is
a moral issue, not one of the ex
pediency which has all but
drowned out the moral voice in
the discussion, such as it is, of
Cold-War problems: thus, I ask
not ‘Do fallout shelters serve this
or that purpose in a Grand De
sign’? (They do.)—but instead,
'Do fallout shelters contribute to
the preservation of life’?
To begin, I must list eight pos
sible beginnings of a thermonu
clear war, arranged in a progres
sive order of their intentionality:
1) war by the failure of mechani
cal control over weapons sys
tems, 2) war’ by the failure of
human control over - weapons sys
tems (due to deranged behavior,
etc.), 3) war by the catalytic ac
tion of a third power' (e.g. Chi
na), 4) general war by the escala
tion of a limited conflict, 5) war
by a breakdown of diplomatic vi
ability (the tragic consequence
of the game of international
‘Chicken’), 6) war by the antici
pation (correct or mistaken) of
an enemy’s intent to attack (i.e.
preventive or pre-emptive war),
7) war by capitalization on a dra
matic technological breakthrough
(e.g. the development of an effec
tive anti-missile missile), 8) war
by the application of the counter
force calculus.
THESE EIGHT circumstances
inceptive of a conflict with over
kill weapons are not mutually ex
clusive; war might, and probably
would, be a combination of two
or more of these circumstances.
They may bo roughly split in
half, into the ‘unpremeditated’
(numbers one through four) and
the ‘premeditated’ (numbers five
to eight). The ‘unpremeditated’
or ‘impulsive’ origins of war are
not, except for certain natural
precautions, amenable to pre
ventive measures. To relate this
to my subject: fallout shelters
can neither encourage nor dis
courage the inception of gu ‘im
pulsive’ war—(this is not entire
ly true, for shelters do slightly
increase the chances of a war of
this type origin by encouraging
a degree of laxncss in providing
mechanical controls, by decreas
ing the moral inhibitions of a
man or nation in the role of a de
ranged weapons-commander or
catalytic agent, and by allowing
a nation to risk (he escalation of
a limited war; but shelters are
not an integral part of war by
impulse in the same way that

they do constitute an essential
element of war by premedita
tion.) It is sufficient to say that
unpremeditated war has a dy
namic of its own which is largely
uninfluenced by the existence or
non-existence of shelters. This is
certainly not to deny that in the
event of an impulsive war we
would be better off with shelters
than without them. How much
better off we would be is a ques
tion as yet unanswered. The
point 1 mean to make is that if
we say that shelters encourage or
discourage war, it is premeditat
ed war that we are talking about.
If we find that they do encourage
war, we will then be faced with
the question: Rather to provide
some protection, however limit
ed, in the event of an impulsive
war—or to do whatever we can
to discourage the inception of a
premeditated war?
I lead up to a consideration of
the part played by shelters in a
premeditated war by moans of a
discussion of their usefulness.

THEBE ARE FOUR types of
targets for a nuclear attack: in
dustrial, commercial, populated,
and military. If the Soviet Union
chose to include targets, the Sun
nyvalc-Palo Alto missile-electron
ics complex would approach the
ideal: Stanford, in this case,
would almost instantaneously
come to bear a striking resem
blance to downtown Hiroshima
on the afternoon of August 6,
1945. If a population and commer
cial targeting were chosen, San
Francisco or San Jose would be
likely points of attack (in fact,
because of the present short
range of Soviet submarine-based
missiles, limiting them to ocastal
targets, both cities would prob- j
ably be chosen).
Let us consider the effects of j
a twenty megaton bomb (it could
be of lather less or rather more 1
a magnitude), detonated over
San Francisco on a more or less J
clear day. (My information comes
mainly from a report prepared
by Dr. Tom Stonier for the Sci- j
entists’ Committee for Radiation
Information, numbering about
100 technical and authoritatively
documented pages.) Only the
most deeply shelter inhabitants
of this city, situated on its
fringes, would survive.
Blast damage would be lim-!
ited to a few broken windows—
that is, unless the concussion j
‘triggered’ the fault along which j
San Francisco and Palo Alto lie,
resulting in a seismic upheaval |
not unlike that which occurred j
early in this century. The imme
diate thermal effects would in-1
elude the permanent blinding of j
any Stanford student who hap- j
pened to look in the direction of 1
the bomb. If he were standing in i
the open, it is entirely possible I
that his clothing would be ignit-1
ed; a twenty megaton bomb can
produce third-degree burns (char- j
ring of the flesh) out to twenty-j
seven miles (not road-mileage)
from the point of explosion, sec-1
ond-degree burns at thirty-one
miles: such burns, if not fatal by
themselves, almost unavoidably i
become infected: without careful 1
medical attention death is the
nearly certain result. No imme
diate radiological effects. There
is an interlude during which
those unexposed at the moment
of detonation can hasten to shel-!
ter. One qualification should be
made: it seems possible that, de-1
pending upon where it is deto
nated, the bomb would vaporized
a largo portion of the Bay; the
compensating tidal movement |
might well reach the proportions 1
of a tidal wave, which travelling ,
down the Bay would inundate all i
or part of the Stanford commu
nity, carrying off many people
and—filling basements.
(Editors’ note: This is the first
of a four-part series by Mr. Such
on fallout shelters. The next ar-1
tide in the series will consider in
more detail the effect on Stan- :
ford of a nuclear blast.)
