tions which has both vitality and

will be “The United Nations in
Evolution,” "Arms Control and
Disarmament,” “Economic De
velopment: Theory and Reality,”
and “The Politics of Peace Con
go, Suez and Cuba.”

Interested persons should ap

will be based upon an essay and
recommendations to the CCUN
by a board of review and by a
faculty member. The cost entails
a $lO reservation fee and a $65

public support of a United Na
tions which has both vitality and
effectiveness. I congratulate the
CCUN for its continued program
in the enduring tasks of public
enlightenment and leadership.”
President Kennedy addressed
those words to a past Leadership
Institute of the Collegiate Coun
cil for the United Nations. The
Institute is a yearly week-long
student conference dealing with
the United Nations. The forth
coming Institute will be held dur
ing the week of Juno 14-21 at
Sarah Lawrence College and at
the UN headquarters in New
York. Student delegates will have
a chance to study the history,
aims, and functions of the United
Nations as they can through no
other program. The primary pur
pose, however, is to train student
leaders for roles in the CCUN.
The Collegiate Council for the
United Nations has existed since

the beginning of the UN in an
effort to provide an understand
ing of the UN for students across
the country, and to give expres
sion to student opinion on the UN
on a national and international
level.

The CCUN Leadership Insti
tute is an opportunity for study
in the area of international rela
tions. Delegates hear diplomats
from all of the major power blocs
in the world speak on their own
nations’ activities with the UN,
and also have occasion to chat in
formally about world affairs.
Past speakers have included the
head delegates from Russia and
India and such personalities as
Dag Hammarskpold and Dr.
Ralph Bundle. Discussion groups
are also part of the program.
Topics to be dealt with this June
will be “The United Nations in
Evolution,” "Arms Control and
Disarmament,” “Economic De
velopment: Theory and Reality,”
and “The Politics of Peace Con
go, Suez and Cuba.”

Interested persons should ap
ply soon. The selection process
will be based upon an essay and
recommendations to the CCUN
by a board of review and by a
faculty member. The cost entails
a $lO reservation fee and a $65
registration fee. Partial scholar
ships are available. Applications
will be found and interviews
scheduled at the ASSU Office. In
terviews begin April 29.

“In this critical lime in history,
the United Nations offers man
kind an important means of
achieving a stable and peaceful
world. As student leaders, you
have a special responsibility and
competence to develop informed
public support of a United Na
tions which has both vitality and
effectiveness. I congratulate the
CCUN for its continued program
in the enduring tasks of public
enlightenment and leadership.”
