Editors, The Daily:
The time has come to be real
istic about Stanford’s Shelter
Plan. There are those who would
have us discuss the issues. Well,
this is just not the “Stanford
Way”; for, as everyone knows,
there is a stigma attached to en
lightened discussion which is sec
ond only to that attached to stu
dent action. Others try to bring
in some hypothetical, non-con
formist arguments those of
such die-hards as Patrick Henry.
Won’t we ever learn? Here at
Stanford we are intellectually
sheltered from worldly reality.
It is a logical extension that we
should now be physically shelter
ed. We should, rather, consider a
more pertinent question; What
would Mrs. Stanford say? I can
almost hear the words “ . . . the
Memorial Fallout Shelter should
occupy the central position in the
academic area, and in the hearts
of the students, and must at all
costs remain non-sectarian
whatever that means.”
Let’s face reality; the shelters
are with us. Let’s think of our
selves as we are—with our heads
in the clouds and the rest of our
bodies safely and snugly under
ground (what I like to call the
“Inverted Ostrich Image”)—and
look forward (or downward) to
the solution of these more press
ing problems:
1. Should our shelters be co
educational?
2. Should alcoholic beverages
bo served in them?
3. How can the House Plan bo
implemented into Shelter Living?
4. Is the Shelter Plan truly non
partisan, or can it bo viewed as a
form of New Deal hole-digging,
or of a reactionary return to cave
dwelling?
While we anxiously await the
Board of Trustees’ solution of
t hose grave problems (no pun
intended) for us, I sincerely hope
that the students will attempt to
learn, as I have learned, how we
do things here at Stanford. There
is still time, brother.
