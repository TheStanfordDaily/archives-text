Laos in defiance of a cease-fire accord, battled heseiged neutralist
forces at the strategic base of Phone Savan yesterday and Premier

the spot where the premier met with Gen. Kong Le, commander of
Laotian neutralist forces, and the commander of the rival pro-Com
munist Pathet Lao, Gen. Singkapo, last Sunday to roach a shaky
cease-fire tjiat was promptly violated by leftist troops. It is a few
minutes’ drive from the vital Plain of Jars airport that is Kong Le’s
vital remaining supply link with the outside.
HUSK TALKS TO ASNK— WASHINGTON Secretary of State Doan
Rusk told the annual American Society of Newspaper Editors yes
terday that the United States has made a “major commitment of
force” to keep the Communist threat in Cuba within bounds. He also
said U.S. policy did not call for an invasion. At the same time, Sen.
Kenneth B. Keating, R-N.Y., a persistent critic of administration
Cuba policies, disputed President Kennedy’s assurances that Russia
is reducing the number of its troops on tlie island. Keating said there
still are about 17,000 Soviet military personnel there, with no sub
stantial reduction since the October missile crisis.
THRESHER’S DEFECTS REVEALED- PORTSMOUTH. N.H. Ma
chinist’s Mate 2c Frank Do Stephano, a former crewman aboard the
the sunken submarine hreshor, told a Navy court of inquiry yester
day that design changes on the sub may have hampered the crew’s
ability to respond with split-second precision to emergencies. He also
said that some general work done by personnel at Portsmouth Naval
Shipyard during the sub’s nine-month overhaul was “very sloppy.”
De Stefano’s testimony came after a veteran submarine officer told
the court Thresher had had continuous trouble with the vital high
pressure air system used for surfacing.
