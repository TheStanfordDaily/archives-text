# STANFORD THIRD IN CIBA
## Pitching Depth Sought as Indians Play Three Games This Weekend 
### GLENN ALFORD 
A Stanford baseball te;un that
hopes to make a serious run at
the CIBA championship will find
out very soon if its title hopes
are well-founded. The Indians
play seven league contests in the
next nine days, including two
double-headers.
This rigorous schedule will test
whether Dutch Fehring has been
able to find a couple of back-up
hurlers for mound aces Jim Lon
borg and Darrell Sutherland.
Warren Newell and Dick Kovace
vich have done well against less
talented opposition than the
CIBA presents. It remains to be
seen whether they can withstand
the better hitting of such as USC
and Santa Clara.
THE INDIANS, third in the
league, start their run for the
flag this afternoon at Berkeley,
when Lonborg faces the some-

what less (Iran potent sluggers
I of the University of California.
1 Cal has pitching galore, including
Dave Dowling, the probable
I starter against Stanford.
| According to last reports from
up north, Dowling has given up
exactly two earned runs all year.
But the Bears are woefully weak
at the plate, with a team average
I of less than .200.
, I Lonborg should be able to stop
j the Bears if his 1963 statistics
j are any indication. He struck out
[64 and has an earned run aver
[age of 1.55 in 64 frames. The
light batting support he has re
ceived leaves him with only a

1-4 record this year. In CIBA ac
tion he shut out Simla Clara and
gave up only one earned run to
USC in 11 innings.
TOMORROW the Tribe faces
UCLA, current CIBA leaders
with a 7-0 slate, in a double-head
er starting at 1 p.m. Sutherland
will hurl against the Bruins in
the nine inning opener and Now
ell is the choice in the seven
frame nightcap.

Sutherland, the string-bean
righthander, is 3-1 in 1903. His
only loss was 1-0 to USC, with the
lone run scoring on a double
steal. He has struck out 39 in 24
innings, and only given up 14
hits and five walks, with a 0.7.)
E.R.A. Newell hasn’t given up an
earned run this year, also in 24
innings. He has been touched for
17 hits and seven walks and
hasn’t been involved in a deci
sion.
UCLA is likely to start Tim
Bottoms, for three years the ace
of their staff, and Tom Pederson,
an outstanding relief pitcher who
decisioned Stanford last year.
The Bruins have six sophs in
their starting lineup, and three
seniors. Their leading hitter is
first baseman Randy Schwartz,
while Dave Ardell is a top glove
man in center field.
FLUKING WILL start the
same lineup he has been using
in the last several games, and
which has won four in a row, in
cluding three shutouts.
The infield is Bob Hollmann at
first base, George Thacher at sec
ond base, Joel Shulman at short
stop and Gary Smith at third
base. The outfield, from left to
right, is Bobby Cox, Greg Post
and either Kovacevich or Newell.
Either Jim Seckler or Chuck
French will be behind the plate.
Post is Stanford’s leading bat
ter at .458. and has also stolen 13
bases in 14 attempts, making him
one of the most successful base

runners ever to trod Sunken Dia
mond's base paths. Kovacevich
is batting .300 in a limited num
ber of plate appearances.
THACHER IS the most con
sistent hitter, at .288. He has hit
safely in 16 of Stanford’s 20
games, and has three triples,
three doubles and 10 runs batted
in. Gary Smith leads the latter
department with 16.
The Indian strong-point in 1963,
as expected, has been pitching.
Stanford has a team earned run
average of 1.2. This is incredible.
Even with unearned runs con
sidered. the Indians have allowed
only 2.1 runs per game. Stan
ford’s 13-5 season mark is easily
understandable when one consid
ers that the Indians have scored
runs to the tune of 5.6 per game.
5.1 to 2.1 is a very favorable
ratio.
However the runs scored fig
ure is misleading. Stanford has
tallied only three runs in three
CIBA games. Luckily Sutherland
and Lonborg have given up only
three or Stanford wouldn’t even
have the one league it docs pos
sess.
Since Stanford's fantastic pitch
ing can’t continue indefinitely the
Indians better score some runs.
Maybe a friendly home atmos
phere in five of the seven crucial
games will induce a few base
hits. It better.
