# Stanford Meets SC, No. 1 in U.S.
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
The stunning array of athletes
that makes USC the best dual
meet track team in the country
will perform tomorrow in Stan
ford Stadium beginning at 1:30
p.m. A victory for the Indians
over this group would neutralize
the bitter disappointment of Stan
ford's three-point loss to Oregon
last week, and would make 1963 a
red-letter year in Stanford sports
history the Indians have? nol
beaten the Trojans in track since
1932.
To accomplish such a feat, Stan
ford coach Payton Jordan empha
sized that the Indians must not
he overawed by USC’s powerful
image. “R eme m be 1 i n g 1 hat
they’re on one of the top four or
five teams in the country, them
selves, should help them maintain
their confidence and prevent any
freezing-up in the meet,” he said.
‘‘SC’s strength comes from its
great tradition in track. They
scare the average team out of 20
points each meet, but they won’t
scare us out of any.”
As always though, SC has plen
ty of talent this year, besides tra
dition. It has won eight straight
meets (his season, including a 92-
53 victory two weeks ago over
Oregon, the 1962 NCAA champs.
SC performers hold seven of the
lop marks and eight of the sec
ond best marks recorded in the
AAWU this year. Stanford ath
letes hold five bests and four sec
ond bests. Several of these best
and second best mark holders will
meet tomorrow, producing some
outstanding individual duels.

This will he the case in the dis
tance races, where Stanford’s
Harry McCalla will try for the
greatest double of his career. He
set a personal record in the mile
(4:01.5) last week against Ore
! gon’s Keith Forman but was too
tired after that even to place in
! the two-mile. He ran an 8:52.7 last
year in that event,
j He'll be pushed, or perhaps
even led, in both races by SC’s
j veteran Julio Marin, who has run
! 1;04.7 in the mile and 8:52.0 in the
two-mile. McCalla will have help
; in the latter race from sopho
mores Paul Schlicke (9:01.0), who
has completely recovered from a
foot injury that scratched him
last week, and Weyrn Kirkland
(8:58G). who iias been drastically
reducing his limes in recent
i weeks.
The 100-yard dash will undoubt
-1 edly produce the closest finish
iof the meet. Stanford’s Larry
i Questad, who appears to have fi- ]
nally rounded into top form, is
favored after his 9.5 run last
week, the third best in the U.S.
SC will enter Dave Morris (9.7),
who ran a 9.4 last year in junior
college, and Dick Cortese (9.6). ]
They will also run in the 220, |
| where (hey are favored to finish j
1-2. Eric Frische and Len Bres- |
I chini, both 9.7, will also run for
| Stanford.
| In the 330 intermediate hurdles, j
Steve Cortright (37.0, the third
1 best in the U.S.) will meet three j
of SC’s truly outstanding men. j
1 Rex Cawley (37.1), who runs the I
1 440 in 46.5, the AAWU’s best, will j
give Cortright the closest battle, ■
Bob Pierce (37.4) and Brian Polk- j
inghorne (37.7) will probably be
fighting for third. However, these
two are the top high hurdles in
the country this year, with times j
of 14.0 and 13.9 respectively.
The field events will display
some of the NCAA's best ath
letes. although there will not be
as many close duels as in the
races. In the javelin, SC’s Larry
Stuart has the best collegiate
mark this year, 267-3. Lew Hoyt
has the second best high jump,
7-o' 2. Mike Flanagan and Mel
Hein, Jr. pole vault consistently
above the 15-3 level.
Countering for Stanford will be
Dave Weill, the NCAA discus
record holder with a mark of
194-6, thrown two weeks ago; Dan
Moore, the AAWU broad jump
champ at 25-9'2. who has been
hampered until recently by a leg
1 injury and should go well beyond
24 feet tomorrow; and Phil White,
a potential 15-foot pole vaulter,
who epitomizes the athlete who
j is overdue for an outstanding per-
I formance.
Having grown accustomed to
expecting rain in time to jeop-
I ardize the Stanford track meet
each week, we add the following,
hopefully inapplicable informa
tion: in case the meet is washed
! out it will be rescheduled for 1:30
3 Sunday; and if rained out again,
) il will be held late Monday after
s noon, around dusk.


HALF-MILER Bob miltz will be
Stanford's biggest, hope for an
880 win tomorrow. Miltz has
run 1:51.4 this year, best on the
team.


JACK CHAPPLE will be a key man in tomorrow's shot put competi
tion. A second place behind teammate Steve Arch would give
Stanford crucial team points. Chappie's best is 55-8½, set last
Saturday, and the 220-pound sophomore has been improving
with every week.

some of the NCAA's best ath

record holder with a mark of
194-6, thrown two weeks ago; Dan
Moore, the AAWU broad jump
champ at 25-9'2. who has been
hampered until recently by a leg
1 injury and should go well beyond

) il will be held late Monday after

HALF-MILER Bob miltz will be
Stanford's biggest, hope for an
880 win tomorrow. Miltz has
run 1:51.4 this year, best on the
team.


JACK CHAPPLE will be a key man in tomorrow's shot put competi
tion. A second place behind teammate Steve Arch would give
Stanford crucial team points. Chappie's best is 55-8½, set last
Saturday, and the 220-pound sophomore has been improving
with every week.
The stunning array of athletes
that makes USC the best dual
meet track team in the country
will perform tomorrow in Stan
ford Stadium beginning at 1:30

over this group would neutralize
the bitter disappointment of Stan
ford's three-point loss to Oregon
last week, and would make 1963 a
red-letter year in Stanford sports
history the Indians have? nol
beaten the Trojans in track since
1932.
To accomplish such a feat, Stan
ford coach Payton Jordan empha
sized that the Indians must not

freezing-up in the meet,” he said.
‘‘SC’s strength comes from its
great tradition in track. They
scare the average team out of 20
points each meet, but they won’t
scare us out of any.”
As always though, SC has plen
ty of talent this year, besides tra
dition. It has won eight straight
meets (his season, including a 92-
53 victory two weeks ago over
Oregon, the 1962 NCAA champs.
SC performers hold seven of the
lop marks and eight of the sec
ond best marks recorded in the
AAWU this year. Stanford ath

and second best mark holders will
meet tomorrow, producing some
outstanding individual duels.

This will he the case in the dis
tance races, where Stanford’s
Harry McCalla will try for the
greatest double of his career. He
set a personal record in the mile
(4:01.5) last week against Ore
! gon’s Keith Forman but was too
tired after that even to place in
! the two-mile. He ran an 8:52.7 last
year in that event,
j He'll be pushed, or perhaps
even led, in both races by SC’s
j veteran Julio Marin, who has run
! 1;04.7 in the mile and 8:52.0 in the
two-mile. McCalla will have help
; in the latter race from sopho

team.


JACK CHAPPLE will be a key man in tomorrow's shot put competi
tion. A second place behind teammate Steve Arch would give
Stanford crucial team points. Chappie's best is 55-8½, set last
Saturday, and the 220-pound sophomore has been improving
with every week.
The stunning array of athletes
that makes USC the best dual
meet track team in the country
will perform tomorrow in Stan
ford Stadium beginning at 1:30
p.m. A victory for the Indians
over this group would neutralize
the bitter disappointment of Stan
ford's three-point loss to Oregon
last week, and would make 1963 a
red-letter year in Stanford sports
history the Indians have? nol
beaten the Trojans in track since
1932.
To accomplish such a feat, Stan
ford coach Payton Jordan empha
sized that the Indians must not
he overawed by USC’s powerful
image. “R eme m be 1 i n g 1 hat
they’re on one of the top four or
five teams in the country, them
selves, should help them maintain
their confidence and prevent any
freezing-up in the meet,” he said.
‘‘SC’s strength comes from its
great tradition in track. They
scare the average team out of 20
points each meet, but they won’t
scare us out of any.”
As always though, SC has plen
ty of talent this year, besides tra
dition. It has won eight straight
meets (his season, including a 92-
53 victory two weeks ago over
Oregon, the 1962 NCAA champs.
SC performers hold seven of the
lop marks and eight of the sec
ond best marks recorded in the
AAWU this year. Stanford ath
letes hold five bests and four sec
ond bests. Several of these best
and second best mark holders will
meet tomorrow, producing some
outstanding individual duels.

This will he the case in the dis
tance races, where Stanford’s
Harry McCalla will try for the
greatest double of his career. He
set a personal record in the mile
(4:01.5) last week against Ore
! gon’s Keith Forman but was too
tired after that even to place in
! the two-mile. He ran an 8:52.7 last
year in that event,
j He'll be pushed, or perhaps
even led, in both races by SC’s
j veteran Julio Marin, who has run
! 1;04.7 in the mile and 8:52.0 in the
two-mile. McCalla will have help
; in the latter race from sopho
mores Paul Schlicke (9:01.0), who
has completely recovered from a
foot injury that scratched him
last week, and Weyrn Kirkland
(8:58G). who iias been drastically
reducing his limes in recent
i weeks.
The 100-yard dash will undoubt
-1 edly produce the closest finish
iof the meet. Stanford’s Larry
i Questad, who appears to have fi- ]
nally rounded into top form, is
favored after his 9.5 run last
week, the third best in the U.S.
SC will enter Dave Morris (9.7),
who ran a 9.4 last year in junior
college, and Dick Cortese (9.6). ]
They will also run in the 220, |
| where (hey are favored to finish j
1-2. Eric Frische and Len Bres- |
I chini, both 9.7, will also run for
| Stanford.
| In the 330 intermediate hurdles, j
Steve Cortright (37.0, the third
1 best in the U.S.) will meet three j
of SC’s truly outstanding men. j
1 Rex Cawley (37.1), who runs the I
1 440 in 46.5, the AAWU’s best, will j
give Cortright the closest battle, ■
Bob Pierce (37.4) and Brian Polk- j
inghorne (37.7) will probably be
fighting for third. However, these
two are the top high hurdles in
the country this year, with times j
of 14.0 and 13.9 respectively.
The field events will display
some of the NCAA's best ath
letes. although there will not be
as many close duels as in the
races. In the javelin, SC’s Larry
Stuart has the best collegiate
mark this year, 267-3. Lew Hoyt
has the second best high jump,
7-o' 2. Mike Flanagan and Mel
Hein, Jr. pole vault consistently
above the 15-3 level.
Countering for Stanford will be
Dave Weill, the NCAA discus
record holder with a mark of
194-6, thrown two weeks ago; Dan
Moore, the AAWU broad jump
champ at 25-9'2. who has been
hampered until recently by a leg
1 injury and should go well beyond
24 feet tomorrow; and Phil White,
a potential 15-foot pole vaulter,
who epitomizes the athlete who
j is overdue for an outstanding per-
I formance.
Having grown accustomed to
expecting rain in time to jeop-
I ardize the Stanford track meet
each week, we add the following,
hopefully inapplicable informa
tion: in case the meet is washed
! out it will be rescheduled for 1:30
3 Sunday; and if rained out again,
) il will be held late Monday after
s noon, around dusk.
