# Ed Ferry Out For OSU Race
## 
### 
The Stanford crew will lower
their racing shell into the Wil
lamette River at Corvallis, Ore
gon, tomorrow in preparation for
their second race with Oregon
State.
The Indians won the first en
counter earlier in the month by
a scant two seconds. However,
the race was held in a wind-swept
Redwood City Yacht Harbor, and
wasn’t a true indication of the
relative merits of the two crews.
In other races this year the Bea
vers lost to Cal by a whopping
four lengths, while Stanford was
beaten by two and a half lengths
by the Bears,
THE INDIANS will be without
the services of stroke oarsman
Ed Ferry and coach Conn Find
ley, who left last week for Bra
/il and the Pan American Games.
In preliminary races, the fresh
men and .IV's will row against
the Beavers. Earlier, the fresh
men scored a convincing win at
Redwood City, while (he JV’s
lost by about eight feet.
