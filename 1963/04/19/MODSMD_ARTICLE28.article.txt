# Students Veto Smoking In Main Libe's RBR
## 
### 
A written survey was conducted
last quarter to determine how
students feel about permitting
smoking in the Reserve Book
Room. A total of 1,313 replies
were completed with the result
that 424 were in favor of smoking
while 889 were not in favor of
smoking in the RBR.
The library staff, claiming that
it is usually beyond surprise, ad
mitted that it was taken aback
at this two to one rejection of
“what commonly passes as a
much-desired privilege, if not a
basic human right.”
