### ILENE H. STRELITZ Associate Editor 
Professors John Bunzel of Po
litical Science, Irving Howe of
the English Department, and
Samuel Stokes of the French De
partment are among seven pro
fessors of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences who have indi
cated to the University that they
will leave Stanford after this
quarter. Bunzoll will bo teaching
at San Francisco State. Howe at
the City University of New York
at Hunter College, and Stokes at
the University of New Hamp
shire.

BUNZEL has been well known
by the student body and his col
leagues for his intense activity
within th e field of political
science. Ho is currently the presi
dent of the Northern California
Political Science Association.
He has served as a member of
the California Attorney General’s
Rights, and is currently working
Committee on Constitutional
with the National Education As
sociation's project on the Educa
tional Implications of Automa
tion and has recently contributed
a chapter to the Association’s
book on the subject. Last sum
mer he published a book dealing
with the American small busi
nessman.
Bunzel came to Stanford in
1957, and has taught courses in
the field of politics.
WELL KNOWN literary an d
social clitic Irving Howe joined
the Stanford faculty two years
ago from Brandeis University.
Howe's contributions to such jour
nals as “Dissent” and the “New
Republic” are frequent; his book
“Politics and the Novel” is a defi
nitive one in its field.
When approached on the sub
ject of his evaluation of Stanford
and possibilities for change,)
Howe commented. “There is not j
any coherent group life, so far as !
I can see, among the intellectual
minority of Ihe students. They
don’t form a sufficiently unified
group. There is no hang-out for
them, no place that is their own
where they can form a bohemia 1
within the folds of this pleasant
university,
“Far too many of Stanford’s [
students have not been exposed j
to the shock of modern history
They live in a sheltered dream
world of their own, that to be an
American means one can have

whatever one wants even that
then one deserves whatever one
wants. They are cut off from all
the pain and trouble of the twen
tieth century.”
STOKES ' LEFT Harvard in
in 1959 for Stanford, and at that
time assumed the leadership of
the lower division French pro
gram here. As one involved with
language teaching, Stokes was
asked to comment on the Over
seas Campus Program. He noted,
“For the enterprising student the
European campuses can be a
wonderful opportunity. For stu
dents who confine themselves to
the Stanford Campuses abroad
they might as well not go.
“I do not recommend any
change in program, but I would
like the Stanford community to
understand that none of the for
eign campuses is run by the lan
guage departments, so that praise
as well as criticism should no t
be directed to Stanford in Cali
fornia language professors.”
IN REFERENCE to University
policy in general, Stokes stated.
“For Stanford to become more
than a great science institution,
I would strongly recommend,
among other things, the allocation
I to the present library from the
j PACE program of twice the total
I amount donated and used in the
construction of Tresidder.”
Stokes feels that his New
Hampshire position will offer him
broader teaching experience with
less administrative work, as well
i as a personal return to the semes
ter system, which he has advo
-1 rated for Stanford in The Daily.
Also leaving Stanford are Hu
| inanities and Sciences professors
I Herbert Grubel of Economics,
June McFee in Art and Education,
Burton Richter of Physics, an d
Gerald Williams of Anthropology.
