## 
### 
Three Stanford graduate busi
ness school students, Gordon
Mann, Barry Roach, and Frede
rick Webster, have been selected
for “Journey for Perspective,” a
summer European travel-study
program sponsored by the John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance
Company.
The students will leave Boston
June 19 for a three week tour of
Great Britain, France, Belgium,
West Germany, and Sweden.
There they will attend meetings
and seminars with leading indus
trialists, businessmen, and gov
ernment officials. Following these
meetings, each of the students
will receive a fellowship for a
month of independent study and
research before returning to Stan
ford in the fall.
The students were selected on
the basis of their academic rec
ord and interviews with members
of the John Hancock advisory
committee of western business
leaders.
