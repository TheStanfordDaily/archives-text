# Wiegand to Offer New Interpretation Of J. D. Salinger
## 
### 
William Wiegand, Professor of
English at San Francisco State
College, will lead a discussion on
J. D. Salinger Sunday, April 21,
at 4 p.m. in the small lounge of
Tresidder Memorial Union.
Wiegand feels that Salinger’s
recent book “Raise High the Roof
Beam, Carpenters and Seymour
an Introduction” is sufficiently
different from his well-known
“Catcher in the Rye” to warrant
an entirely new critical approach
to Salinger.
Wiegand will attempt to supply
this new approach by analyzing
Salinger as a misunderstood ro
manticist. He terms Salinger a
man whom people have put “in
the wrong pigeon hole.”
Ho believes that there has been
a misguided tendancy among re
viewers to criticize Salinger for
failing to be what, in fact, ho
never intended to be. In his dis
cussion Wiegand plans to re-eval
uate and perhaps to rehabilitate
Salinger in light of his most re
cently published stories.
Wiegand, a novelist in his own
right, has published two articles
on Salinger. His first essay was
published in 19.16, making him
one of the first critics to analyze
Salinger.
The discussion will be limited
to 20 people. Tickets may be ob
tained at the Tresidder Ticket Of
fice.
