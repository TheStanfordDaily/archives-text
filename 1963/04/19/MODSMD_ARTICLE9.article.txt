# Rusher to Discuss '64 GOP Challenge
## 
### 
William A. Rusher, publisher of
“The National Review,’’ will
speak on “1964—Crossroads for
the GOP,” Monday at 4:15 p.m.
in Cubberley Auditorium. His
speech is sponsored by the Con
servation Caucus of the Political
Union, in co-operation with the
Stanford Area Young Republi
cans.
One of the country’s outspoken
conservatives, Rusher makes no
secret of the fact that he favors
Senator Barry Goldwater for the
GOP Presidential nomination.
Asked about Goldwaler’s chances
for winning if nominated, Rusher
replied, "There will inevitably
come a time when the American
people determine that world Com
munism must be destroyed. If
that time comes before November
of 1964, Goldwater will be elected.
If it comes after 1964, he will be
defeated.” In a recent editorial, he
wrote that Goldwater could win
the South from Kennedy while
Nelson Rockefeller could not.
Rusher became an expert on
Communism in the United States
through his former service as as
sociate counsel to the Senate In
ternal Security Subcommittee. Be
sides his work on the Subcommit
tee, it is rumored that he is the
spirit behind the Young Ameri
cans for Freedom, the national
Young Republicans, the Conserv
ative Party of New York, and the
campaign to nominate Barry
Goldwater for President.
After leading the Republicans
in the Princeton Model Senate
during his undergraduate days,
Rusher became a member of the
Republican Party's liberal wing
until, as he says, “about 1955,
when I got pretty thoroughly dis
gusted with the monumental ir
relevancies of Liberalism.”
