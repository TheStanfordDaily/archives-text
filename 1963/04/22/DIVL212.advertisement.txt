When the question is
a cool, comfortable,
yet crisp-looking suit
for summer wear, the
answer, quite natu
rally, is provided by
Haspel, the outfit that
pioneered this sort of
garment. 75% da
cron, 25% cotton, in
grey green, black or
brown, an ideal
choice for travelling
in warm climes, and a
typical R/A buy at a
modest 42.50. Today
would be a very
suitable time to select
yours.
