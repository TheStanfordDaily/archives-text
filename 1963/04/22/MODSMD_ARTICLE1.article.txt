# Russian Security is Not Increased by Suppression of Voices'

### IRVING HOWE Professor of English 
(Editors’ note: Professor Howe has permitted
The Daily to excerpt (tortious of his review of
two books, “Dissonant Voices in Soviet Litera
ture" edited by Patricia Blake and Max Hay
ward and “People and Life” by Ilya Ehrenberg,
to appear in a coming issue of the “New Re
public.” This article is the first of a two-part
series.)
The excerpt below is that portion which
sheds some light upon the type of conflict sur
rounding the young Soviet poet Yevgeny Yev
tushenko, whose lour of the United States and
scheduled appearances at Stanford and univer
sities across the country were recently can
celled. In his review, Howe refers to Yevtu
shenko as “a journalistic ryhmster who, de
spite his current disfavor, has not raised any
fundamental questions as to the nature of the

regime.”
(The passage cited by Howe early in this
excerpt is from Max Hayward’s introduction
to “Dissonant Voices in Soviet Literature.’’)
APPARENTLY a literary underground of
some importance has grown up in Russia,
somewhat like the underground for experimen
tal painting. On what grounds, however, can
the writers who appear in the official maga
zines, even those who try to inject a word of
sincerity or restrained criticism in their work,
be called “dissonant?”
Mr. Hayward, in his excellent introduction,
sets down the following:
Most of the voices represented here are
dissonant, not in any political sense, but in
that they do not speak in that trite and
monotonous accent which, owing to the
long and bitter years of Stalin’s dictator
ship, is still regarded by many people in

the West as the sole voice of Soviet litera
ture.
ELASTIC though it may seem, this princi
ple of selection is quite justified. Justified po
litically: any deviation, no matter how trivial,
from the norms of the state raises the possi
bility of freedom. Justified in literary terms:
“socialist realism” is not a serious if mistaken
esthetic doctrine, it is a mere swindle, a pre
text for stale domination of the arts. The devia
tion which raises the possibility of a genuine
literature.
Under Czarism writers could not print di
rect attacks on the state, though they often
found ways of circumventing this prohibition.
However, they did not have to adhere to a par
ticular stylo or literary doctrine, nor did they
have to compose tributes to the Czar. Since the
late twenties, by contrast, the Communist dic
tatorship has not merely suppressed dissidents,

it has required that approval of its claims be
registered by writers through an official style
called “socialist realism,” which is practice
comes to little more than unremlttant propa
ganda. As Mr. Hayward remarks:
. . . literature need not necessarily suf
fer from purely negative limitations on the
right of publication (nineteenth-century
Russian literature and early Soviet litera
ture flourished under censorship) or from
the “voluntary” acceptance of a particular
set of doctrinal terms of reference (as in
the case of Catholic writers), but when
matters of form and content are strictly
regulated in accordance with extraliterary
criteria, the result is very serious for cre
ative effort.
YET IN READING “Dissonant Voices” and
reflecting upon Khrushchev’s recent measures
against writers and artists, one cannot help

wondering: Is such a degree of repression
necessary or "inherent” even in a totalitarian
society? Suppose Khrushchev allowed the ab
stract painters to exhibit their work, would
that really threaten the security of the re
gime?
Surely not; and in the short run it might
even strengthen the dictatorship. Other Com
munist slates, such as those in Poland and
Yugoslavia, have managed to survive public
displays on "avant garde” paintings. And in
Russia itself, very few of the younger writers
or artists can be regarded as opponents of
Communism. Tcrtz and Arzak may be, but
most of the others are not. Solzhenitsyn never
calls into question the Communist monopoly of
power, and Yevtushenko makes it clear that
he considers himself a loyal supporter of the
regime. All such men ask for is a chance to
breathe a little more freely.

wondering: Is such a degree of repression
necessary or "inherent” even in a totalitarian
society? Suppose Khrushchev allowed the ab
stract painters to exhibit their work, would

gime?
Surely not; and in the short run it might
even strengthen the dictatorship. Other Com
munist slates, such as those in Poland and
Yugoslavia, have managed to survive public
displays on "avant garde” paintings. And in
Russia itself, very few of the younger writers
or artists can be regarded as opponents of
Communism. Tcrtz and Arzak may be, but
most of the others are not. Solzhenitsyn never
calls into question the Communist monopoly of
power, and Yevtushenko makes it clear that
he considers himself a loyal supporter of the
regime. All such men ask for is a chance to
breathe a little more freely.

APPARENTLY a literary underground of
some importance has grown up in Russia,
somewhat like the underground for experimen
tal painting. On what grounds, however, can
the writers who appear in the official maga
zines, even those who try to inject a word of
sincerity or restrained criticism in their work,
be called “dissonant?”
Mr. Hayward, in his excellent introduction,
sets down the following:
Most of the voices represented here are
dissonant, not in any political sense, but in
that they do not speak in that trite and
monotonous accent which, owing to the
long and bitter years of Stalin’s dictator
ship, is still regarded by many people in

the West as the sole voice of Soviet litera
ture.
ELASTIC though it may seem, this princi
ple of selection is quite justified. Justified po
litically: any deviation, no matter how trivial,
from the norms of the state raises the possi
bility of freedom. Justified in literary terms:
“socialist realism” is not a serious if mistaken
esthetic doctrine, it is a mere swindle, a pre
text for stale domination of the arts. The devia
tion which raises the possibility of a genuine
literature.
Under Czarism writers could not print di
rect attacks on the state, though they often
found ways of circumventing this prohibition.
However, they did not have to adhere to a par
ticular stylo or literary doctrine, nor did they
have to compose tributes to the Czar. Since the
late twenties, by contrast, the Communist dic
tatorship has not merely suppressed dissidents,

it has required that approval of its claims be
registered by writers through an official style
called “socialist realism,” which is practice
comes to little more than unremlttant propa
ganda. As Mr. Hayward remarks:
. . . literature need not necessarily suf
fer from purely negative limitations on the
right of publication (nineteenth-century
Russian literature and early Soviet litera
ture flourished under censorship) or from
the “voluntary” acceptance of a particular
set of doctrinal terms of reference (as in
the case of Catholic writers), but when
matters of form and content are strictly
regulated in accordance with extraliterary
criteria, the result is very serious for cre
ative effort.
