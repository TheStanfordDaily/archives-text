# Student Creations on Display at Annual Architecture Show
## 
### JANE SOKOLOW 
The Annual Student Architec
ture Show will run through May
12 at the Stanford Art Gallery,
which has been decorated for the
show with a wooden pavilion en
trance. Sid Hoover is in charge
of the exhibit and his assistant is
Rob Cormack.
“We hope that through this
show greater interest will bo
stimulated in the University to
wards architecture,” Hoover said.
Hoover’s arrangement of the dis
play is as much an architectural
project as the individual works
exhibited. “Wo have a huge room
and a high ceiling,” Hoover indi
cated, and must “divide the space
to give a more intimate feeling.”
THE FIRST thing Hoover
did was to lower the coiling by
creating a now one of drafting
paper between strings. To deal
with the huge space, Hoover di
vided the room into three areas.
The first (the entrance room' is
relatively small; the second is a
narrow passage which leads into
a very large third room. Panels
are used throughout to break up
the space “in a pleasing way.”
Furthermore, Hoover tried to con
nect the objects in the space of

(ho rooms by a pattern of light!
and shadows and of occasional ac
cents of color.
In the entrance room a huge
gold sun, painted on gold card
board, hangs horizontally from
the ceiling. The only lights in the
room arc* spotlights: one is fo
cused on the sun, two others are
focused on two chairs at the back
of the room. The lights on the
chairs cast shadows on the white
panels behind them so that the
walls will not appear stark. The
exit is emphasized by its off-cen
tered position and by its accents
of hanging stripes of colored
crepe paper. Also of interest is
I lie etching by Piranesi which can
be seen through the tassals. This
etching, which is actually a slide,
is a picture of a Roman stage-set
for an opera. It carries out the
theme of the exhibit: “Early Clas
sical Architecture.”
THE SHOW consists of work
done by many different levels of
students of architecture. The serv
ice station project is a central
feature. The purpose of this
project was to produce an aesthet
ically pleasing, functional, and
inexpensive service station. This
exhibit presents various inter
pretations of the relationship be

j tween a service station and its .
surrounding area.
A second important project is |

the library project. The students
were asked to design a branch
library for Woodside. The main

considerations for the plans were
low cost and central control from
(he librarian’s desk.

with the huge space, Hoover di
vided the room into three areas.
The first (the entrance room' is
relatively small; the second is a
narrow passage which leads into
a very large third room. Panels
are used throughout to break up
the space “in a pleasing way.”
Furthermore, Hoover tried to con
nect the objects in the space of

(ho rooms by a pattern of light!
and shadows and of occasional ac
cents of color.
In the entrance room a huge
gold sun, painted on gold card
board, hangs horizontally from
the ceiling. The only lights in the
room arc* spotlights: one is fo
cused on the sun, two others are
focused on two chairs at the back
of the room. The lights on the
chairs cast shadows on the white
panels behind them so that the
walls will not appear stark. The
exit is emphasized by its off-cen
tered position and by its accents
of hanging stripes of colored
crepe paper. Also of interest is
I lie etching by Piranesi which can
be seen through the tassals. This
etching, which is actually a slide,
is a picture of a Roman stage-set
for an opera. It carries out the
theme of the exhibit: “Early Clas
sical Architecture.”
THE SHOW consists of work
done by many different levels of
students of architecture. The serv
ice station project is a central
feature. The purpose of this
project was to produce an aesthet
ically pleasing, functional, and
inexpensive service station. This
exhibit presents various inter
pretations of the relationship be

j tween a service station and its .
surrounding area.
A second important project is |

the library project. The students
were asked to design a branch
library for Woodside. The main

considerations for the plans were
low cost and central control from
(he librarian’s desk.

The Annual Student Architec
ture Show will run through May
12 at the Stanford Art Gallery,
which has been decorated for the
show with a wooden pavilion en
trance. Sid Hoover is in charge
of the exhibit and his assistant is
Rob Cormack.
“We hope that through this
show greater interest will bo
stimulated in the University to
wards architecture,” Hoover said.
Hoover’s arrangement of the dis
play is as much an architectural
project as the individual works
exhibited. “Wo have a huge room
and a high ceiling,” Hoover indi
cated, and must “divide the space
to give a more intimate feeling.”
THE FIRST thing Hoover
did was to lower the coiling by
creating a now one of drafting
paper between strings. To deal
with the huge space, Hoover di
vided the room into three areas.
The first (the entrance room' is
relatively small; the second is a
narrow passage which leads into
