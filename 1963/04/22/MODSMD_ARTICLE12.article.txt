# Dr. A.W. Griswold of Yale
## 
### 
A. Whitney Griswold, the president of Yale University,
died last Friday afternoon at his home on the Yale campus.
He had been ill with cancer for several weeks.
Dr. Griswold became president of the nation's second
oldest university in 1950. In his acceptance speech, he out
lined his ideas on education, declaring that all United States
citizens “able and eager to assimilate it” had a right to a col
lege education. Dr. Griswold’s views on education were ex
emplified by the programs which he initiated at Yale, where,
according to the New York Times, he “put into practice his
belief that a college education is not merely a quantitative
body of memorized and catalogued facts.”
At Yale, Dr. Griswold made many curriculum and tradi
tion changes. lie put more emphasis on courses designed to
stimulate independent and creative thinking by students, and
doubled faculty salaries. He is the author of several hooks
on the meaning and goals of American education, including
“Essays on Education,” and “Liberal Education and the Dem
ocratic Ideal.”
Dr. Griswold has made many significant contributions to
the cause of American education. The academic community
will feel his loss.
