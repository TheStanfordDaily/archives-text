## A 						German Speaks Up' 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
A very interesting turn in European affairs took place a few
weeks ago. Little attention has been paid to it in this country,
but there is a big to-do about it in the German newspapers. The
president of the Commission of the European Economic Com
munity (the Common Market) is Dr. Walter Hallstein, not only
a German, hut in the past a deputy foreign minister in the Ade
nauer government and a close associate of the chancellor. Speak
ing to the European parliament, which meets in Strasbourg, he
warned Germany and France in the name of the commission of
which he is the president that Bonn and Paris should not ratify
the Gaullist-Adenauer pact of friendship without disclaiming
the intent to set up an inner alliance within the European com
munity of the six.
It was evident as soon as the pact was published some three
months ago that one of its purposes was to arrange it so that
the Common Market would be run by a Franco-German com
bination dominated by General de Gaulle. For the pact, obliges
Paris and Bonn to consult and reach “as far as possible a simi
lar position” in European affairs. Paris and Bonn would control
the Common Market. For Italy and the Benelux countries would
have little power and influence as compared with a Franco-
German combination.
This, said Dr. Hallstein in his Strasbourg speech, is contrary
to the spirit, if not to the letter, of the Treaty of Rome, which is
the charter of the Common Market. It is apparent from the
German newspapers, of which I have seen excerpts, that the
Hallstein speech has evoked a wide response among Germans.
Anyone who has been recently to Germany, or has talked
with Germans visiting Washington, knows (hat for the most
part West Germans are very uneasy-about the Gau Hist conception
of Europe. They want reconciliation with France. But they do
not wish to be forced into a break with Great Britain, with the
Scandinavian countries and, least of all, with the United States..
It would be undesirable. I think, to have the Paris-Bonn
pact fail entirely. Good feeling between the French and German
nations is most important for the stability and peace of Europe.
But it is difficult to see how the Germans are to stay with the
French and at the same time remain close to the English
speaking countries. There will be many headaches in Germany
over this dilemma.
It is, let us hope, needless to say once more that the best
thing the United States can do is to do nothing. This rule should
apply, also, to our embassy in Bonn which, if the newspaper
reports are correct, went out of bounds in trying to influence
the German Bundestag in the matter of the wretched oil pipes.
The crucial European question is whether the Common
Market is to turn inward and become land-locked or is to turn
outward toward the open sea. On this question, the facts of geog
raphy and history, of economic and political interest, will plead
our cause better than we can plead it ourselves. There is an At
lantic Community because Spaniards and Portuguese, English
and French crossed the Atlantic Ocean to settle in the New'
World. That is as much an historical fact as is the grandeur of
France.
