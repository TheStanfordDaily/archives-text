### RICHARD SUCH 
From bomb tests in arid regions or over water little has
been learned about the nature of a nuclearly ignited firestorm;
fallout patterns vary with local geography and wind currents
and similarly unpredictable with any degree of precision. Never
the less, there appears a general outline of thermal and radiation
effects which attains a high level of probability:
Over a broad area, including Stanford, the sun-hot heat of
a bomb detonated over San Francisco would kindle innumer
able small fires in readily flammable material. The air displaced
by the shock front will come sweeping back toward the fireball
with greater than hurricane force, feeding and spreading the
small fires until they merge into one vast conflagration. The
greater blaze which would form a ring about ‘ground-zero,‘
where literally everything is either vaporized or pulverized be
yond burning, would swell ever outward, dying out only when
it reached a natural barrier or when it found nothing left to
consume. In the summer and full, the fire would sweep across
the dry hills between San Francisco and Palo Alto in a matter,
not of hours, but of minutes. The nearly continuous construction
between the two cities would provide a natural avenue for the
flames. It is difficult to imagine how Stanford might be spared.
But supposing that by miraculous intercession or by a freak
(other than the obvious) of Stanford architecture, the Stanford
family is not incinerated, roasted alive in its oven-like shelters,
or drowned in carbon dioxide or monoxide—what then?
Fallout is distributed, often in irregular intensities, over two
patterns: one circular and containing the heavier particles, the
other elliptical, with its major axis following the prevailing
winds. The circular, high-intensity zone would include Stanford.
Within an hour after the blast, the radioactivity throughout this
circle w’ould reach something on the order of 20,000 roentgens
per hour. 700-900 roentgens is always fatal—a two-minute dose.
Lucky we within our shelters! Pity the off-campus resident who
didn’t make it in time! Including the 100 or so roentgens which
one would receive while running, shoving, screaming, trampling,
slugging, gnawing his way into the shelter, he would receive
an approximate total of 900 roentgens during his two weeks of
‘protection’ (assuming that the Stanford shelters have no more
than the stated protective factor of 100).
After (wo weeks, when shelter supplies will have been de
pleted and it is necessary to emerge (or after a lesser length of
time, if one’s sheltermates prove particularly voracious cracker
eaters), the radioactivity level outside the shelters will have
cooled down to about 20 roentgens per hour—which gives the
survivor about two days of exposure to pick up another fatal
dose. In the meantime, despite the best efforts of the local demo
eratic officials and hastily recruited civil defense volunteers,
there will be found no potable water—Tresidder, alas, will have
discontinued food services, there is no food. One’s capacity to
resist diseases of epidemic proportions will be markedly lowered.
Streets, if they remain, will be choked with rubble, barring es
cape to. . . . The rest is left to the reader’s imagination. This
very brief survey considers only one bomb and its consequences,
and it assumes that a Bay Area city were hit; if these two con
ditions were not mot, the consequences would he, respectively,
more or less severe.
Is all this unknown to those who have provided us with shel
ters? Certainly not; by their own calculations, a counter-city
attack like that nighlmarishly described above would result in
the deaths of at least 100,000.000 million Americans- nearly the
entire population of our - urban areas. Is, then, the provision of
fallout shelters at Stanford an instance of sheer lunacy—or is
there a method in this apparent madness?
There is. Shelters make sense only in one context—that of
the counter-force doctrine. What, then, is the counter-force doc
trine?

series by Mr. Such on fallout shelters. Tin* next article in the

From bomb tests in arid regions or over water little has
been learned about the nature of a nuclearly ignited firestorm;
fallout patterns vary with local geography and wind currents
and similarly unpredictable with any degree of precision. Never
the less, there appears a general outline of thermal and radiation
effects which attains a high level of probability:
Over a broad area, including Stanford, the sun-hot heat of
a bomb detonated over San Francisco would kindle innumer
able small fires in readily flammable material. The air displaced
by the shock front will come sweeping back toward the fireball
with greater than hurricane force, feeding and spreading the
small fires until they merge into one vast conflagration. The
greater blaze which would form a ring about ‘ground-zero,‘
where literally everything is either vaporized or pulverized be
yond burning, would swell ever outward, dying out only when
it reached a natural barrier or when it found nothing left to
consume. In the summer and full, the fire would sweep across
the dry hills between San Francisco and Palo Alto in a matter,
not of hours, but of minutes. The nearly continuous construction
between the two cities would provide a natural avenue for the
flames. It is difficult to imagine how Stanford might be spared.
But supposing that by miraculous intercession or by a freak
(other than the obvious) of Stanford architecture, the Stanford
family is not incinerated, roasted alive in its oven-like shelters,
or drowned in carbon dioxide or monoxide—what then?
Fallout is distributed, often in irregular intensities, over two
patterns: one circular and containing the heavier particles, the
other elliptical, with its major axis following the prevailing
winds. The circular, high-intensity zone would include Stanford.
Within an hour after the blast, the radioactivity throughout this
circle w’ould reach something on the order of 20,000 roentgens
per hour. 700-900 roentgens is always fatal—a two-minute dose.
Lucky we within our shelters! Pity the off-campus resident who
didn’t make it in time! Including the 100 or so roentgens which
one would receive while running, shoving, screaming, trampling,
slugging, gnawing his way into the shelter, he would receive
an approximate total of 900 roentgens during his two weeks of
‘protection’ (assuming that the Stanford shelters have no more
than the stated protective factor of 100).
After (wo weeks, when shelter supplies will have been de
pleted and it is necessary to emerge (or after a lesser length of
time, if one’s sheltermates prove particularly voracious cracker
eaters), the radioactivity level outside the shelters will have
cooled down to about 20 roentgens per hour—which gives the
survivor about two days of exposure to pick up another fatal
dose. In the meantime, despite the best efforts of the local demo
eratic officials and hastily recruited civil defense volunteers,
there will be found no potable water—Tresidder, alas, will have
discontinued food services, there is no food. One’s capacity to
resist diseases of epidemic proportions will be markedly lowered.
Streets, if they remain, will be choked with rubble, barring es
cape to. . . . The rest is left to the reader’s imagination. This
very brief survey considers only one bomb and its consequences,
and it assumes that a Bay Area city were hit; if these two con
ditions were not mot, the consequences would he, respectively,
more or less severe.
Is all this unknown to those who have provided us with shel
ters? Certainly not; by their own calculations, a counter-city
attack like that nighlmarishly described above would result in
the deaths of at least 100,000.000 million Americans- nearly the
entire population of our - urban areas. Is, then, the provision of
fallout shelters at Stanford an instance of sheer lunacy—or is
there a method in this apparent madness?
There is. Shelters make sense only in one context—that of
the counter-force doctrine. What, then, is the counter-force doc
trine?
