# PEACE CORPS LETTER
## The 						Peace Corps in Ghana 
### RALPH GILMAN 
(Editors' note: This is the first section of a three-part letter
written by Ralph Gilman, a Stanford graduate now working
for the Peace Corps in Ghana.)

The yellow rays of the sun are just about to disappear into
another insect-filled night. Here I sit on the front porch of my
African bungalow, the Italian typewriter I bought in the States
in front of me and a bottle of Ghanian beer beside me. From
across the grass comes the sound of voices engaged in that
peaceful Sunday afternoon chatter that is typical of students
everywhere.
This has been a period of transition for me, the likes of
which I haven’t been through since I entered college. Studying
for that last group of finals at Stanford was like trying to get a
drink from a fire hose— and then the excitements of the “black
robe.” Some say graduation is only for parents, but to me it
covered the sadness of farewells and leaving behind the innocent
freshman who had entered four years earlier. I was forced to
think back over those years and to realize how much I’d changed.
I allowed myself this slice of reverie and then left it with the
rented robe. Three days later I was walking up the steps of the
Peace Corps Training Center at the University of California in
Berkeley, loaded with banjo and lots of “vigah.” This was one
person to whom “new frontiers” meant just that!
Why did I join the Peace Corps? That question, about which
I wondered so much my senior year, hasn’t crossed my mind
since I've been in Ghana. I’ve been too busy. Just teaching and
getting all I can from this experience leaves little time to won
der. Those of you who have discovered the possibility of alter
native actions and must decide what to do next may he inter
ested in my reasoning.
I had been exposed to an education. Experiences come ex
tremely concentrated from books and the tensions of campus
society. I began to feel I’d had enough of second-hand knowl
edge (be it ever so academic) which had been picked over for
my consumption. Now was the time to learn directly from
people struggling with life! Besides, I didn’t know what to
choose as a career and hadn’t enough experience to make a
choice anyway. I did know that I wasn’t ready to go directly on
to grad school because the responsibility of making my educa
tion useful and the inevitable desire to justify a decision to
study deeply one outlook on life might make a great difference.
It could lead to a stratified and narrow viewpoint just at the
time when a broadening should occur. So early in my senior
I decided on a moratorium to compare and contrast myself and
my culture outside my accustomed way of life. I looked into
various possibilities and the Peace Corps seemed the best al
ternative.
Besides wanting to help myself, I wanted to put this expen
sive education to some good use. Americans of my generation
have inherited a healthy and abundant country from the hard
work and good fortune of those who’ve gne before. We seldom
stop to think just how rich and sanitary America really is, un
less we are among the few who are fortunate enough to meet
an inspiring character like A1 Lowenstein, or to come in contact
wdth the wisdom of a William Craig, or the tolerance and in
tense empathy of a Dwight Clark. But this good fortune implies
the responsibility of some constructive use—responsibilities to
the people who go to bed at night without food, to the people
yearning for an education, and for the people who wish to dis
card their freedoms (which we tend to do so lavishly and un
thinkingly). For those who believe in self-interest, this world is
so very small and our fate is not only entangled with the man
across the street, but has reached out to encircle the man across
the ocean too. We tend to become so involved with our frater
nities, our jobs, our competition for an education, and our court
ship system that we forget to ask “to what end?” After asking
myself these questions, 1 concluded that I hadn’t found all the
answers in school. Before you can feel “free” your stomach
must be full; before you can lead you must learn. And so I
came to Ghana—not because I feel sorry that others are not
like me. and not out of sloppy, superior pity—but because they
asked and I am able to help. People solve their problems in
their own unique way, but if one can help when and where we
are asked, the solving might come a little sooner. These are my
justifications.

It could lead to a stratified and narrow viewpoint just at the
time when a broadening should occur. So early in my senior
I decided on a moratorium to compare and contrast myself and
my culture outside my accustomed way of life. I looked into
various possibilities and the Peace Corps seemed the best al
ternative.
Besides wanting to help myself, I wanted to put this expen
sive education to some good use. Americans of my generation
have inherited a healthy and abundant country from the hard
work and good fortune of those who’ve gne before. We seldom
stop to think just how rich and sanitary America really is, un
less we are among the few who are fortunate enough to meet
an inspiring character like A1 Lowenstein, or to come in contact
wdth the wisdom of a William Craig, or the tolerance and in
tense empathy of a Dwight Clark. But this good fortune implies
the responsibility of some constructive use—responsibilities to
the people who go to bed at night without food, to the people
yearning for an education, and for the people who wish to dis
card their freedoms (which we tend to do so lavishly and un
thinkingly). For those who believe in self-interest, this world is
so very small and our fate is not only entangled with the man
across the street, but has reached out to encircle the man across
the ocean too. We tend to become so involved with our frater
nities, our jobs, our competition for an education, and our court
ship system that we forget to ask “to what end?” After asking
myself these questions, 1 concluded that I hadn’t found all the
answers in school. Before you can feel “free” your stomach
must be full; before you can lead you must learn. And so I
came to Ghana—not because I feel sorry that others are not
like me. and not out of sloppy, superior pity—but because they
asked and I am able to help. People solve their problems in
their own unique way, but if one can help when and where we
are asked, the solving might come a little sooner. These are my
justifications.

The yellow rays of the sun are just about to disappear into
another insect-filled night. Here I sit on the front porch of my
African bungalow, the Italian typewriter I bought in the States
in front of me and a bottle of Ghanian beer beside me. From
across the grass comes the sound of voices engaged in that
peaceful Sunday afternoon chatter that is typical of students
everywhere.
This has been a period of transition for me, the likes of
which I haven’t been through since I entered college. Studying
for that last group of finals at Stanford was like trying to get a
drink from a fire hose— and then the excitements of the “black
robe.” Some say graduation is only for parents, but to me it
covered the sadness of farewells and leaving behind the innocent
freshman who had entered four years earlier. I was forced to
think back over those years and to realize how much I’d changed.
I allowed myself this slice of reverie and then left it with the
rented robe. Three days later I was walking up the steps of the
Peace Corps Training Center at the University of California in
Berkeley, loaded with banjo and lots of “vigah.” This was one
person to whom “new frontiers” meant just that!
Why did I join the Peace Corps? That question, about which
I wondered so much my senior year, hasn’t crossed my mind
since I've been in Ghana. I’ve been too busy. Just teaching and
getting all I can from this experience leaves little time to won
der. Those of you who have discovered the possibility of alter
native actions and must decide what to do next may he inter
ested in my reasoning.
I had been exposed to an education. Experiences come ex
tremely concentrated from books and the tensions of campus
society. I began to feel I’d had enough of second-hand knowl
edge (be it ever so academic) which had been picked over for
my consumption. Now was the time to learn directly from
people struggling with life! Besides, I didn’t know what to
choose as a career and hadn’t enough experience to make a
choice anyway. I did know that I wasn’t ready to go directly on
to grad school because the responsibility of making my educa
tion useful and the inevitable desire to justify a decision to
study deeply one outlook on life might make a great difference.
