# Sutherland, Lonborg Stop UCLA, 3-0, 3-1
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford used its 1-2 pitching
punch against UCLA yesterday
and (he Bruins are still reeling
from the blow. Darrell Suther
land and Jim Lonborg each
hurled a complete game and al
lowed a total of only four Bruin
hits in the double-header played

yesterday at Sunken Diamond as
Stanford won both games. The
Cards are now 17-5.
Sutherland pitched the first
game and set UCLA down on just
three hits as Stanford won 3-0.
Lonborg hurled the seven-inning
nightcap and improved on Suth
erland’s work just slightly, giv

ing up only one hit as Stanford
took the second contest 3-1.
THE TWO victories brought
Stanford back into contention in
the tight CIBA race. UCLA still
leads the pack at 7-3, but Stan
ford trails closely with a 3-2
CIBA record. The Indians will
have to prove their mettle four
times in the coming week. Stan
ford meets defending champs
Santa Clara tomorrow and Fri
day at Buck Shaw stadium, and
then USC in a double-header Sat
urday.

Lonborg (5-4) was in constant
trouble in the second game. He
walked six, hit two, and was
often behind in the count. He
gave up UCLA's only hit with
one out in the seventh. His big

gest problem round was the
sixth, after Stanford had taken
a 3-0 lead in the bottom of the
fifth.
LON BORG GOT out of a
seventh inning jam thanks to
George Thaeher’s defensive work.
Two were on and one out when
Thaeher converted Bill Maori’s
grounder into a game-ending
double play.
Stanford’s three runs were un
earned. The bases were loaded
and two were out in the fifth
when Warren Newell sent a rou
tine grounder to UCLA shortstop
E/ell Singleton and he booted it.
Gary Smith singled in two more
Indians.
Sutherland (4-1) was never in
trouble in the first game. He
walked only three and struck out
nine. UCLA never got a man past
second base.
STANFORD GOT all three runs
in the second frame. Newell led
off with a single and Smith laid
down a perfect sacrifice bunt.
He was safe at first and Newell
at third when Bruin pitcher Jim
Arens’ throw hit him in the back.
Thaeher and Seckler were hit by
pitches to send Newell across
with the only run Sutherland was
to need.

I n other weekend sports,
the Stanford varsity crew
heat Oregon State in a dis
puted decision, and the ten
nis team lost to UCLA, fi-0.
Stories will appear in tomor
row’s Daily.
Stanford used its 1-2 pitching
punch against UCLA yesterday
and (he Bruins are still reeling
from the blow. Darrell Suther
land and Jim Lonborg each
hurled a complete game and al
lowed a total of only four Bruin
hits in the double-header played

yesterday at Sunken Diamond as
Stanford won both games. The
Cards are now 17-5.
Sutherland pitched the first
game and set UCLA down on just
three hits as Stanford won 3-0.
Lonborg hurled the seven-inning
nightcap and improved on Suth
erland’s work just slightly, giv

ing up only one hit as Stanford
took the second contest 3-1.
THE TWO victories brought
Stanford back into contention in
the tight CIBA race. UCLA still
leads the pack at 7-3, but Stan
ford trails closely with a 3-2
CIBA record. The Indians will
have to prove their mettle four
times in the coming week. Stan
ford meets defending champs
Santa Clara tomorrow and Fri
day at Buck Shaw stadium, and
then USC in a double-header Sat
urday.

Lonborg (5-4) was in constant
trouble in the second game. He
walked six, hit two, and was
often behind in the count. He
gave up UCLA's only hit with
one out in the seventh. His big

gest problem round was the
sixth, after Stanford had taken
a 3-0 lead in the bottom of the
fifth.
LON BORG GOT out of a
seventh inning jam thanks to
George Thaeher’s defensive work.
Two were on and one out when
Thaeher converted Bill Maori’s
grounder into a game-ending
double play.
Stanford’s three runs were un
earned. The bases were loaded
and two were out in the fifth
when Warren Newell sent a rou
tine grounder to UCLA shortstop
E/ell Singleton and he booted it.
Gary Smith singled in two more
Indians.
Sutherland (4-1) was never in
trouble in the first game. He
walked only three and struck out
nine. UCLA never got a man past
second base.
STANFORD GOT all three runs
in the second frame. Newell led
off with a single and Smith laid
down a perfect sacrifice bunt.
He was safe at first and Newell
at third when Bruin pitcher Jim
Arens’ throw hit him in the back.
Thaeher and Seckler were hit by
pitches to send Newell across
with the only run Sutherland was
to need.

I n other weekend sports,
the Stanford varsity crew
heat Oregon State in a dis
puted decision, and the ten
nis team lost to UCLA, fi-0.
Stories will appear in tomor
row’s Daily.
Stanford used its 1-2 pitching
punch against UCLA yesterday
and (he Bruins are still reeling
from the blow. Darrell Suther
land and Jim Lonborg each
hurled a complete game and al
lowed a total of only four Bruin
hits in the double-header played

yesterday at Sunken Diamond as
Stanford won both games. The
Cards are now 17-5.
Sutherland pitched the first
game and set UCLA down on just
three hits as Stanford won 3-0.
Lonborg hurled the seven-inning
nightcap and improved on Suth
erland’s work just slightly, giv

ing up only one hit as Stanford
took the second contest 3-1.
THE TWO victories brought
Stanford back into contention in
the tight CIBA race. UCLA still
leads the pack at 7-3, but Stan
ford trails closely with a 3-2
CIBA record. The Indians will
have to prove their mettle four
times in the coming week. Stan
ford meets defending champs
Santa Clara tomorrow and Fri
day at Buck Shaw stadium, and
then USC in a double-header Sat
urday.

Lonborg (5-4) was in constant
trouble in the second game. He
walked six, hit two, and was
often behind in the count. He
gave up UCLA's only hit with
one out in the seventh. His big

gest problem round was the
sixth, after Stanford had taken
a 3-0 lead in the bottom of the
fifth.
LON BORG GOT out of a
seventh inning jam thanks to
George Thaeher’s defensive work.
Two were on and one out when
Thaeher converted Bill Maori’s
grounder into a game-ending
double play.
Stanford’s three runs were un
earned. The bases were loaded
and two were out in the fifth
when Warren Newell sent a rou
tine grounder to UCLA shortstop
E/ell Singleton and he booted it.
Gary Smith singled in two more
Indians.
Sutherland (4-1) was never in
trouble in the first game. He
walked only three and struck out
nine. UCLA never got a man past
second base.
STANFORD GOT all three runs
in the second frame. Newell led
off with a single and Smith laid
down a perfect sacrifice bunt.
He was safe at first and Newell
at third when Bruin pitcher Jim
Arens’ throw hit him in the back.
Thaeher and Seckler were hit by
pitches to send Newell across
with the only run Sutherland was
to need.
