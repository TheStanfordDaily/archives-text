# Indians Lose to Best Team, SC, Under Worst Track Conditions
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Despite several inspired performances by Stanford athletes, a
rain storm and muddy field, and the efforts of the California
Highway Patrol, USC won the track meet Saturday, 73-72. As
usual in Stanford track for 1963, the meet was decided by the last
race, the mile relay, which the Trojans won by a comfortable
five yards. Thereby, SC extended* ——

its winning streak over Indian
track teams to 27; it has not lost
since 1932.
The setting for the meet, at
Foothill College, would have been
quite humorous had the weather
not been so uncomfortable. There
was USC, the number one track
team in the U.S., competing
against Stanford, also one of the
nation’s best, on a junior college
field that looked like the site of
last year’s Con Home mud follies.
Early Saturday, the meet had
been rescheduled for late Mon
day afternoon; USC athletic di
rector Jess Hill had given Coach
Vein Wolfe permission to keep
the team in the Bay Area until
then.
BUT WOLFE balked, pointing
out that a postponement till Mon
day would force SC to compete
three times in one week (SC has
meets this Friday and Saturday!;

that would bo too great an exer
tion for his athletes, especially
during the current mid-term
exam period. So he forced the
meet at the last minute to be
held on Foothill’s asphalt track
in the downpour.
This caused Stanford coach
Payton Jordan great complica
tions. and ultimately it cost him
the meet. -47- and 43-foot triple
jumpers Sheridan Downey and
Russ Peterson had taken off for
bridge tournament in Santa
Rosa when they heard that the
meet was postponed. For five
hours, through telephone calls
and the highway patrol, Stanford

STANFORD got outstanding upset performances in the 880 Sat
urday from Bob Miltz (far right) and Bill Pratt. SC's Kevin Hogan,
fourth best half-miler in the U.S., finished fourth, behind Bill Lile
tried futilely 1o locate and redi
rect them to Foothill where Jor
dan hoped they could pick up the
one, third-place point that would
have won the meet for Stanford.
The event was being held open
for them for only one attempt,
as if they had passed their first
five jumps but had not scratched,
Downey would have needed only
one jump to beat SC’s Carlos do
la Rose (40-9 :, i ) for third and
possibly Max Johnson <42-9'4)
for second. Such an occurrence
would have made the score either
73-72 or 75-71 for Stanford.
AS IT WAS, Stanford came
within the judges’ decision of
winning. In the 220 all of the
judges agreed that SC’s Dick
Cortese (21.9) had just barely
held off Stanford’s Larry Que
stad (22.0), though Questad ada
mantly protested “I felt the tape
break on my chest.” Stanford
lost that event only 4-5, however,
as Eric Frische was third; the
Indians had figured to finish be
hind both Cortese and Dave Mor
ris, who ran 22.9.
Thus Stanford picked up an
unexpected point in the 220 as it
did in the 100-yard dash, w'here
Morris again failed even to place.
This time Frische and Questad
finished 2-3 behind Cortese (9.7).
However, Stanford biggest up
sets in the meet came in the 880
and pole vault. SC’s Kevin Ho
gan. the fourth best half-miler
in the NCAA at 1:50.2, was a sure
bet. But Stanford’s Boh Miltz
(1:52.2) and Bill Pratt (1:52.8)
sprinted away from tiim in the
third 220, according to Jordan’s
plan, and withstood his token
comeback attempt in the last 120
yards to finish 1-2 and win eight
points.
THE POLE VAULT, delayed
again and again by the rain, was
not decided until very late in the
meet. Phil White won it, clearing
14-6 on his first attempt, after
requiring three tries to make
14-0. Then he watched as the fa
vored SC vaulters, Mike Flana
gan and Me] Hein, missed 14-6 on
each of their two remaining tries.
Stanford also picked up unex
pected points as it swept the
mile, because 4:04.7 miler Julio
Marin was held out by Wolfe.
Harry McCalla (4:09.0), Harlan
Andrews, and Robin Ruble all fin

j ished ahead of SC’s lone entrant,
| Doug Calhoun. However, Marin,
then fresh for the two-mile, easi
ly ran away from Stanford’s out
standing trio. McCalla, Weym
Kirkland, and Paul Schlicke, and
won by 50 yards (8:57.01;
Schlicke re-injured his foot and
did not finish.
ALL THE OTHER events
went as expected, except that
Steve Cort right couldn’t quite
take Rex Cawley in the 330-yd.
intermediate hurdles (37.4 to
37.5), so Stanford led by four
points going into the mile relay,
which is always scored 5-0, not
5-3. But that was as close as
Stanford came to winning the
meet. SC grabbed an early lead
in the relay and coasted home to
win.

AS IT WAS, Stanford came
within the judges’ decision of
winning. In the 220 all of the
judges agreed that SC’s Dick
Cortese (21.9) had just barely
held off Stanford’s Larry Que
stad (22.0), though Questad ada
mantly protested “I felt the tape
break on my chest.” Stanford
lost that event only 4-5, however,
as Eric Frische was third; the
Indians had figured to finish be
hind both Cortese and Dave Mor
ris, who ran 22.9.
Thus Stanford picked up an
unexpected point in the 220 as it
did in the 100-yard dash, w'here
Morris again failed even to place.
This time Frische and Questad
finished 2-3 behind Cortese (9.7).
However, Stanford biggest up
sets in the meet came in the 880
and pole vault. SC’s Kevin Ho
gan. the fourth best half-miler
in the NCAA at 1:50.2, was a sure
bet. But Stanford’s Boh Miltz
(1:52.2) and Bill Pratt (1:52.8)
sprinted away from tiim in the
third 220, according to Jordan’s
plan, and withstood his token
comeback attempt in the last 120
yards to finish 1-2 and win eight
points.
THE POLE VAULT, delayed
again and again by the rain, was
not decided until very late in the
meet. Phil White won it, clearing
14-6 on his first attempt, after
requiring three tries to make
14-0. Then he watched as the fa
vored SC vaulters, Mike Flana
gan and Me] Hein, missed 14-6 on
each of their two remaining tries.
Stanford also picked up unex
pected points as it swept the
mile, because 4:04.7 miler Julio
Marin was held out by Wolfe.
Harry McCalla (4:09.0), Harlan
Andrews, and Robin Ruble all fin

j ished ahead of SC’s lone entrant,
| Doug Calhoun. However, Marin,
then fresh for the two-mile, easi
ly ran away from Stanford’s out
standing trio. McCalla, Weym
Kirkland, and Paul Schlicke, and
won by 50 yards (8:57.01;
Schlicke re-injured his foot and

intermediate hurdles (37.4 to
37.5), so Stanford led by four
points going into the mile relay,
which is always scored 5-0, not
5-3. But that was as close as

in the relay and coasted home to

Despite several inspired performances by Stanford athletes, a
rain storm and muddy field, and the efforts of the California
Highway Patrol, USC won the track meet Saturday, 73-72. As
usual in Stanford track for 1963, the meet was decided by the last
race, the mile relay, which the Trojans won by a comfortable
five yards. Thereby, SC extended* ——

its winning streak over Indian
track teams to 27; it has not lost
since 1932.
The setting for the meet, at

quite humorous had the weather
not been so uncomfortable. There
was USC, the number one track
team in the U.S., competing

nation’s best, on a junior college
field that looked like the site of
last year’s Con Home mud follies.
Early Saturday, the meet had
been rescheduled for late Mon
day afternoon; USC athletic di
rector Jess Hill had given Coach
Vein Wolfe permission to keep
the team in the Bay Area until
then.

out that a postponement till Mon
day would force SC to compete
three times in one week (SC has
meets this Friday and Saturday!;

that would bo too great an exer

during the current mid-term
exam period. So he forced the

STANFORD'S Lorry Questod (right) and SC's Dave Cortese approach
the 220 tape Saturday, in what appears to be a dead heat, but
Cortese was proclaimed winner 21.9 to 22.0. Eric Frische was third.
Despite several inspired performances by Stanford athletes, a
rain storm and muddy field, and the efforts of the California
Highway Patrol, USC won the track meet Saturday, 73-72. As
usual in Stanford track for 1963, the meet was decided by the last
race, the mile relay, which the Trojans won by a comfortable
five yards. Thereby, SC extended* ——

its winning streak over Indian
track teams to 27; it has not lost
since 1932.
The setting for the meet, at
Foothill College, would have been
quite humorous had the weather
not been so uncomfortable. There
was USC, the number one track
team in the U.S., competing
against Stanford, also one of the
nation’s best, on a junior college
field that looked like the site of
last year’s Con Home mud follies.
Early Saturday, the meet had
been rescheduled for late Mon
day afternoon; USC athletic di
rector Jess Hill had given Coach
Vein Wolfe permission to keep
the team in the Bay Area until
then.
BUT WOLFE balked, pointing
out that a postponement till Mon
day would force SC to compete
three times in one week (SC has
meets this Friday and Saturday!;

that would bo too great an exer
tion for his athletes, especially
during the current mid-term
exam period. So he forced the
meet at the last minute to be
held on Foothill’s asphalt track
in the downpour.
This caused Stanford coach
Payton Jordan great complica
tions. and ultimately it cost him
the meet. -47- and 43-foot triple

STANFORD got outstanding upset performances in the 880 Sat
urday from Bob Miltz (far right) and Bill Pratt. SC's Kevin Hogan,
fourth best half-miler in the U.S., finished fourth, behind Bill Lile
tried futilely 1o locate and redi
rect them to Foothill where Jor
dan hoped they could pick up the
one, third-place point that would
have won the meet for Stanford.
The event was being held open
for them for only one attempt,
as if they had passed their first
five jumps but had not scratched,
Downey would have needed only
one jump to beat SC’s Carlos do
la Rose (40-9 :, i ) for third and
possibly Max Johnson <42-9'4)
for second. Such an occurrence
would have made the score either
73-72 or 75-71 for Stanford.
AS IT WAS, Stanford came
within the judges’ decision of
winning. In the 220 all of the
judges agreed that SC’s Dick
Cortese (21.9) had just barely
held off Stanford’s Larry Que
stad (22.0), though Questad ada
mantly protested “I felt the tape
break on my chest.” Stanford
lost that event only 4-5, however,
as Eric Frische was third; the
Indians had figured to finish be
hind both Cortese and Dave Mor
ris, who ran 22.9.
Thus Stanford picked up an
unexpected point in the 220 as it
did in the 100-yard dash, w'here
Morris again failed even to place.
This time Frische and Questad
finished 2-3 behind Cortese (9.7).
However, Stanford biggest up
sets in the meet came in the 880
and pole vault. SC’s Kevin Ho
gan. the fourth best half-miler
in the NCAA at 1:50.2, was a sure
bet. But Stanford’s Boh Miltz
(1:52.2) and Bill Pratt (1:52.8)
sprinted away from tiim in the
third 220, according to Jordan’s
plan, and withstood his token
comeback attempt in the last 120
yards to finish 1-2 and win eight
points.
THE POLE VAULT, delayed
again and again by the rain, was
not decided until very late in the
meet. Phil White won it, clearing
14-6 on his first attempt, after
requiring three tries to make
14-0. Then he watched as the fa
vored SC vaulters, Mike Flana
gan and Me] Hein, missed 14-6 on
each of their two remaining tries.
Stanford also picked up unex
pected points as it swept the
mile, because 4:04.7 miler Julio
Marin was held out by Wolfe.
Harry McCalla (4:09.0), Harlan
Andrews, and Robin Ruble all fin

j ished ahead of SC’s lone entrant,
| Doug Calhoun. However, Marin,
then fresh for the two-mile, easi
ly ran away from Stanford’s out
standing trio. McCalla, Weym

won by 50 yards (8:57.01;

the 220 tape Saturday, in what appears to be a dead heat, but
Cortese was proclaimed winner 21.9 to 22.0. Eric Frische was third.
Despite several inspired performances by Stanford athletes, a
rain storm and muddy field, and the efforts of the California
Highway Patrol, USC won the track meet Saturday, 73-72. As
usual in Stanford track for 1963, the meet was decided by the last
race, the mile relay, which the Trojans won by a comfortable
five yards. Thereby, SC extended* ——

its winning streak over Indian
track teams to 27; it has not lost
since 1932.
The setting for the meet, at
Foothill College, would have been
quite humorous had the weather
not been so uncomfortable. There
was USC, the number one track
team in the U.S., competing
against Stanford, also one of the
nation’s best, on a junior college
field that looked like the site of
last year’s Con Home mud follies.
Early Saturday, the meet had
been rescheduled for late Mon
day afternoon; USC athletic di
rector Jess Hill had given Coach
Vein Wolfe permission to keep
the team in the Bay Area until
then.

out that a postponement till Mon
day would force SC to compete
three times in one week (SC has
meets this Friday and Saturday!;

that would bo too great an exer

during the current mid-term
exam period. So he forced the
meet at the last minute to be

STANFORD got outstanding upset performances in the 880 Sat
urday from Bob Miltz (far right) and Bill Pratt. SC's Kevin Hogan,
fourth best half-miler in the U.S., finished fourth, behind Bill Lile
tried futilely 1o locate and redi
rect them to Foothill where Jor
dan hoped they could pick up the
one, third-place point that would
have won the meet for Stanford.
The event was being held open
for them for only one attempt,
as if they had passed their first
five jumps but had not scratched,
Downey would have needed only
one jump to beat SC’s Carlos do
la Rose (40-9 :, i ) for third and
possibly Max Johnson <42-9'4)
for second. Such an occurrence
would have made the score either
73-72 or 75-71 for Stanford.
AS IT WAS, Stanford came
within the judges’ decision of
winning. In the 220 all of the
judges agreed that SC’s Dick
Cortese (21.9) had just barely
held off Stanford’s Larry Que
stad (22.0), though Questad ada
mantly protested “I felt the tape
break on my chest.” Stanford
lost that event only 4-5, however,
as Eric Frische was third; the
Indians had figured to finish be
hind both Cortese and Dave Mor
ris, who ran 22.9.
Thus Stanford picked up an
unexpected point in the 220 as it
did in the 100-yard dash, w'here
Morris again failed even to place.
This time Frische and Questad
finished 2-3 behind Cortese (9.7).
However, Stanford biggest up
sets in the meet came in the 880
and pole vault. SC’s Kevin Ho
gan. the fourth best half-miler
in the NCAA at 1:50.2, was a sure
bet. But Stanford’s Boh Miltz
(1:52.2) and Bill Pratt (1:52.8)
sprinted away from tiim in the
third 220, according to Jordan’s
plan, and withstood his token
comeback attempt in the last 120
yards to finish 1-2 and win eight
points.
THE POLE VAULT, delayed
again and again by the rain, was
not decided until very late in the
meet. Phil White won it, clearing
14-6 on his first attempt, after
requiring three tries to make
14-0. Then he watched as the fa
vored SC vaulters, Mike Flana
gan and Me] Hein, missed 14-6 on
each of their two remaining tries.
Stanford also picked up unex
pected points as it swept the
mile, because 4:04.7 miler Julio
Marin was held out by Wolfe.
Harry McCalla (4:09.0), Harlan
Andrews, and Robin Ruble all fin

j ished ahead of SC’s lone entrant,
| Doug Calhoun. However, Marin,
then fresh for the two-mile, easi
ly ran away from Stanford’s out
standing trio. McCalla, Weym
Kirkland, and Paul Schlicke, and
won by 50 yards (8:57.01;
Schlicke re-injured his foot and
did not finish.

intermediate hurdles (37.4 to
37.5), so Stanford led by four
points going into the mile relay,
which is always scored 5-0, not

in the relay and coasted home to
win.

STANFORD got outstanding upset performances in the 880 Sat
urday from Bob Miltz (far right) and Bill Pratt. SC's Kevin Hogan,
fourth best half-miler in the U.S., finished fourth, behind Bill Lile
tried futilely 1o locate and redi
rect them to Foothill where Jor
dan hoped they could pick up the
one, third-place point that would
have won the meet for Stanford.
The event was being held open
for them for only one attempt,
as if they had passed their first
five jumps but had not scratched,
Downey would have needed only
one jump to beat SC’s Carlos do
la Rose (40-9 :, i ) for third and
possibly Max Johnson <42-9'4)
for second. Such an occurrence
would have made the score either
73-72 or 75-71 for Stanford.
AS IT WAS, Stanford came
within the judges’ decision of
winning. In the 220 all of the
judges agreed that SC’s Dick
Cortese (21.9) had just barely
held off Stanford’s Larry Que
stad (22.0), though Questad ada
mantly protested “I felt the tape
break on my chest.” Stanford
lost that event only 4-5, however,
as Eric Frische was third; the
Indians had figured to finish be
hind both Cortese and Dave Mor
ris, who ran 22.9.
Thus Stanford picked up an
unexpected point in the 220 as it
did in the 100-yard dash, w'here
Morris again failed even to place.
This time Frische and Questad
finished 2-3 behind Cortese (9.7).
However, Stanford biggest up
sets in the meet came in the 880
and pole vault. SC’s Kevin Ho
gan. the fourth best half-miler
in the NCAA at 1:50.2, was a sure
bet. But Stanford’s Boh Miltz
(1:52.2) and Bill Pratt (1:52.8)
sprinted away from tiim in the
third 220, according to Jordan’s
plan, and withstood his token
comeback attempt in the last 120
yards to finish 1-2 and win eight
points.
THE POLE VAULT, delayed
again and again by the rain, was
not decided until very late in the
meet. Phil White won it, clearing
14-6 on his first attempt, after
requiring three tries to make
14-0. Then he watched as the fa
vored SC vaulters, Mike Flana
gan and Me] Hein, missed 14-6 on
each of their two remaining tries.
Stanford also picked up unex
pected points as it swept the
mile, because 4:04.7 miler Julio
Marin was held out by Wolfe.
Harry McCalla (4:09.0), Harlan
Andrews, and Robin Ruble all fin

j ished ahead of SC’s lone entrant,
| Doug Calhoun. However, Marin,
then fresh for the two-mile, easi
ly ran away from Stanford’s out
standing trio. McCalla, Weym
Kirkland, and Paul Schlicke, and
won by 50 yards (8:57.01;
Schlicke re-injured his foot and
did not finish.
ALL THE OTHER events
went as expected, except that

take Rex Cawley in the 330-yd.
intermediate hurdles (37.4 to
37.5), so Stanford led by four
points going into the mile relay,
which is always scored 5-0, not
5-3. But that was as close as
Stanford came to winning the
meet. SC grabbed an early lead
in the relay and coasted home to
win.

STANFORD'S Lorry Questod (right) and SC's Dave Cortese approach
the 220 tape Saturday, in what appears to be a dead heat, but
Cortese was proclaimed winner 21.9 to 22.0. Eric Frische was third.
Despite several inspired performances by Stanford athletes, a
rain storm and muddy field, and the efforts of the California
Highway Patrol, USC won the track meet Saturday, 73-72. As
usual in Stanford track for 1963, the meet was decided by the last
race, the mile relay, which the Trojans won by a comfortable
five yards. Thereby, SC extended* ——

its winning streak over Indian
track teams to 27; it has not lost
since 1932.
The setting for the meet, at
Foothill College, would have been
quite humorous had the weather
not been so uncomfortable. There
was USC, the number one track
team in the U.S., competing
against Stanford, also one of the
nation’s best, on a junior college
field that looked like the site of
last year’s Con Home mud follies.
Early Saturday, the meet had
been rescheduled for late Mon
day afternoon; USC athletic di
rector Jess Hill had given Coach
Vein Wolfe permission to keep
the team in the Bay Area until
then.
