# Indians Lose to Best Team, SC, Under Worst Track Conditions
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Despite several inspired performances by Stanford athletes, a
rain storm and muddy field, and the efforts of the California
Highway Patrol, USC won the track meet Saturday, 73-72. As
usual in Stanford track for 1963, the meet was decided by the last
race, the mile relay, which the Trojans won by a comfortable
five yards. Thereby, SC extended* ——

its winning streak over Indian
track teams to 27; it has not lost
since 1932.
The setting for the meet, at
Foothill College, would have been
quite humorous had the weather
not been so uncomfortable. There
was USC, the number one track
team in the U.S., competing
against Stanford, also one of the
nation’s best, on a junior college
field that looked like the site of
last year’s Con Home mud follies.
Early Saturday, the meet had
been rescheduled for late Mon
day afternoon; USC athletic di
rector Jess Hill had given Coach
Vein Wolfe permission to keep
the team in the Bay Area until
then.
BUT WOLFE balked, pointing
out that a postponement till Mon
day would force SC to compete
three times in one week (SC has
meets this Friday and Saturday!;

that would bo too great an exer
tion for his athletes, especially
during the current mid-term
exam period. So he forced the
meet at the last minute to be
held on Foothill’s asphalt track
in the downpour.
This caused Stanford coach
Payton Jordan great complica
tions. and ultimately it cost him
the meet. -47- and 43-foot triple
jumpers Sheridan Downey and
Russ Peterson had taken off for
bridge tournament in Santa
Rosa when they heard that the
meet was postponed. For five
hours, through telephone calls
and the highway patrol, Stanford
