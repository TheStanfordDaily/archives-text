# Chappie's 'Old Boy' Seeks New Blood
## 
### MICHAEL SAKS 
The Stanford Chaparral is a
humor magazine in search of a
staff. Longevity, tradition, and
quality it has, but it is suffering
from “in groupitls,” a chronic dis
ease in which the same staff
members stay around for too long
without adding any new blood,
and the magazine becomes di
vorced from the center of campus
life.
Now that spring quarter is un
derway, and two Chappie issues
are destined to hit the newsstands
before the Farm rotates into sum
mer plowing, the Old Boy and his
cronies have taken a long look
around their cluttered, dear office
and have soon that there are only
five freshmen on the staff, hardly
the way to perpetuate a maga
zine.
STIFFEB academic loads have
increased the difficulties of staff
recruiting for all student organi
zations, but as Stanford’s GPA
has Increased, so has its apprecia
tion for sophisticated humor. The
Chaparral’s job is to reflect this;
that is, if the hidden talent for
satire lying dormant ni the minds
of countless Stanford students
would make itself apparent.
The Chaparral is holding
tryouts Wednesday afternon at
Tresidder for all prospective staff
members. This is an opportunity
for a new, fresh staff to present
its ideas and revitalize the maga
zine. Ever-present Chappie criti
cism can be turned into concrete
ideas and improvements.
There are openings in the writ
ing and art departments that will
enable talented individuals to see
their creations in print.
STUDENTS more interested in
how the financial side of the
magazine operates can Join the
business staff and receive a salary
01 commission. All departments
give activity credit.
Working on the Chappie offers
an extra bonus, a long and suc
cessful partying tradition com
plete with a distaff side of the
Hammer and Coffin society which
adds that certain something to
social functions.
The Chappie does not rule out
straight arrows or relatives of
the dean, but it does encourage
anyone interested in joining a
creative, fun-loving group, talent
or no talent, to come to the
Chaparral tryouts.
