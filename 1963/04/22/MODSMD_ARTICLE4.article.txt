the Tresidder Lounge this after
noon at 4:30. This informal lec
ture, one of the Monday after
noon coffee hour scries presented
by the Program Division of Ties
siclor Union, is entitled, “Toward
World Religion.”
Smith fools that the movement
from tribal religion through na
tional and international religion
to world religion will not end un
til dogmatism, obscurantism, and
parochialism arc seen to be as
false to religion as they are to
science.
“By world religion I do not
mean a single monolithic reli

munity of religions that are re
sponsive to the world conditions
and world needs of the atomic
age.”
