# J. D. Salinger Now Romantic, Says Wiegand
## 
### AL HEINEMAN 
Tho characterization of Sey
mour Glass, J. D. Salinger’s fic
tional hero, as “boring and stu
pid” was one which Professor
William Wiegand disputed in a
lecture at the Tresidder small
lounge on Sunday. The audience
was to have been limited to 20.
Such was the attraction of the
subject matter, however, that al
most 50 people jammed in at the
last moment.
Dr. Wiegand’s thesis is that
the social criticism of Salinger’s
earlier works, as exemplified by
“Catcher in the Rye,” has given
way to a propensity for the ro
mantic. Seymour Glass is the em
bodiment of tho virtues Salinger
propounds. He is unacceptable to
critics accustomed to the modern
protagonist with the accepted,
indeed, demanded, minor vices;
instead ho is perfect.
Dr, Wiegand set up Seymour
as a cultural hero. In Salinger’s
introduction of him. there is men
tion of reincarnatoin, stress of
the transcendental moment, and
the Keats doctrine of “truth is
beauty.” All those hark back to
the Romanticists, to the Gocthe
an folk hero.
As a romantic, alleged flaws in
his style may be interpreted in
Salinger’s favor. His failure of
selectivity, his criticism of tradi
tional form (L. Manning Vines
and Flaubert undergo some not
ably heavy bombardment.), his
subordination of plot to charac
ter, and his underlying mysticism
and subsequent emphasis of the
transcendental moment, are all
part of tho rotation of this author
from the realistic social doctrine
toward a personal credo.
Salinger offers moral insights
through aesthetic ones, and these
latter must be apprehended, and
their validity acknowledged, be
fore they may be criticized. “Ted
dy.” then, and not Holden Cauli
field, is the stimulus for Salin
ger’s growth, according to the
lecturer.
