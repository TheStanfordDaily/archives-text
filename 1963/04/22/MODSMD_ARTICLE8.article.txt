# Freshman Government Votes Own Dissolution
## 
### HOPE SELBY 
T lie Freshman class ex-eoin passed almost unanimously yes
terday a motion that “the government of the class of 1966 be
dissolved effective April 25, 1965, and that "a recommendation
be sent to the ASSU suggesting the total dissolution of class
government over a three-year period; and that plans to organize

ta government for the incoming
class of 1967 be dropped.” The
vote was 23 yes, 1 no, and 1 ab
stention.
Since ex-com members had not
been previously acquainted with
the motion before the meeting,
and since the meeting itself last
ed less than an hour, this action
may be reconsidered by the com
mittee and other action proposed.
THK MOTION, presented by
class financial manager Richard
Stearns, also included the pro
posal to return funds from the
sale of class cards on a pro-rated
basis, and that money loft in the
class trust be applied to gradua
tion expenses and the senior gift.
Class president Terry Taketa,
vice president Peggy McFadden,
and class financial manager Rich
ard Stearns resigned from their
posilions in support of the mo
tion.
Taketo stated that the motion
“would not in itself abolish class
government.” He felt that it
merely expressed the opinion of
the officers that there wore "no
necessary functions that class
government could perform,” and
that there was “a lack of backing
for what the class government
did plan.” The motion expressed
this by stating that “necessity
does not justify the continuation
of class government,” and that
“Stanford students arc justifi
ably apathetic toward so-called
matters of class interest.”
