NOW YOU CAN BE YOUNGER

It is a scientific fact that girls reach emotional maturity earlier
than boys. For this reason freshman girls are reluctant to make
romantic alliances with freshman boys, but instead choose men
from the upper classes.
Thus the freshman boys are left dateless, and many is the
night the entire freshman dorm sobs itself to sleep. An equally
moist situation exists among upper-class girls. With upper-class
men being snapped up by freshman girls, the poor ladies of the
upper class are reduced to dreary, manless evenings of Monop
oly and home permanents.
It pleasures me to report there is a solution for tins morbid
situation indeed, a very simple solution. Why don’t the two
great have-not groups—the freshman boys and the upper-class
girls—find solace with each other?
True, there is something of an age differential, but that need
not matter. Take, for example, the case of Albert Payson
Sigafoos and Eustacia Vye.
Albert Payson, a freshman in sand and gravel at Vanderbilt
1 niversily. was walking across the campus one day, weeping
softly in his loneliness. Blinded by tears, he stumbled upon

the supine form of Eustacia Vye, a senior in wicker and raffia,
who was collapsed in a wretched heap on the turf.
“Why don’t you watch where you’re going,you minor youth?”
said Eustacia peevishly.
“I’m sorry, lady,” said Albert Payson and started to move
on. Hut suddenly he stopped, struck by an inspiration. “Lady,”
he said, tugging his forelock, “don’t think me forward, but I
know why you’re miserable. It’s because you can’t get a date.
Well, neither can I. So why don’t we date each other?”
“Surely you jest!” cried Eustacia, looking with scorn upon
his tiny head and body.
“Oh, I know I’m younger than you are,” said Albert Payson,
“but that doesn’t mean we can’t find lots of fun things to do
together.”
“Like what?” she asked.
“Well,” said Albert Payson, “we could build a Snowman.”
“Bah!” said Eustacia, grinding her teeth.
“All right then,” said Albert Payson, “we could go down to
the pond and catch some frogs.”
“Ugh!” said Eustacia, shuddering her entire length.
“How about some Run-Sheep-Run?” suggested Albert Payson.
“You are callow, green, and immature,” said Eustacia, “and
I will thank you to remove your underaged presence from
mine eyes.”
Sighing, Albert Payson lighted a cigarette and started away.
“Stay!” cried Eustacia.
Ifi' stayed.
“Was that a Marlboro Cigarette you just lighted?” she asked.
“What else?” said Albert Payson.
“Then you are not immature!” she exclaimed, clasping him
to her clavicle. “For to smoke Marlboros is the very essence
of wisdom, the height of American know-how, the incontro
vertible proof that you can tell gold from dross, right from
wrong, fine aged tobaccos from pale, pathetic substitutes. Albert
Payson, if you will still have me, I am yours!”
“1 will,” he said, and did, and today they are married and
run the second biggest wicker and raffia establishment in
Duluth, Minnesota.

on. Hut suddenly he stopped, struck by an inspiration. “Lady,”
he said, tugging his forelock, “don’t think me forward, but I
know why you’re miserable. It’s because you can’t get a date.
Well, neither can I. So why don’t we date each other?”
“Surely you jest!” cried Eustacia, looking with scorn upon
his tiny head and body.
“Oh, I know I’m younger than you are,” said Albert Payson,
“but that doesn’t mean we can’t find lots of fun things to do
together.”
“Like what?” she asked.
“Well,” said Albert Payson, “we could build a Snowman.”
“Bah!” said Eustacia, grinding her teeth.
“All right then,” said Albert Payson, “we could go down to
the pond and catch some frogs.”
“Ugh!” said Eustacia, shuddering her entire length.
“How about some Run-Sheep-Run?” suggested Albert Payson.
“You are callow, green, and immature,” said Eustacia, “and
I will thank you to remove your underaged presence from
mine eyes.”
Sighing, Albert Payson lighted a cigarette and started away.
“Stay!” cried Eustacia.
Ifi' stayed.
“Was that a Marlboro Cigarette you just lighted?” she asked.
“What else?” said Albert Payson.
“Then you are not immature!” she exclaimed, clasping him
to her clavicle. “For to smoke Marlboros is the very essence
of wisdom, the height of American know-how, the incontro
vertible proof that you can tell gold from dross, right from
wrong, fine aged tobaccos from pale, pathetic substitutes. Albert
Payson, if you will still have me, I am yours!”
“1 will,” he said, and did, and today they are married and
run the second biggest wicker and raffia establishment in
Duluth, Minnesota.

It is a scientific fact that girls reach emotional maturity earlier
than boys. For this reason freshman girls are reluctant to make
romantic alliances with freshman boys, but instead choose men
from the upper classes.
Thus the freshman boys are left dateless, and many is the
night the entire freshman dorm sobs itself to sleep. An equally
moist situation exists among upper-class girls. With upper-class
men being snapped up by freshman girls, the poor ladies of the
upper class are reduced to dreary, manless evenings of Monop
oly and home permanents.
It pleasures me to report there is a solution for tins morbid
situation indeed, a very simple solution. Why don’t the two
great have-not groups—the freshman boys and the upper-class
girls—find solace with each other?
True, there is something of an age differential, but that need
not matter. Take, for example, the case of Albert Payson
Sigafoos and Eustacia Vye.
