R2 SUPER LARK

R2 SUPER HAWK fg/0 m
We designed two new cars—and built
a lot of our record-setting Avanti into
them: supercharged R2 engines...
heavy duty springs and shock absorb
ers, plus anti-sway bars, front and rear
~. trac rods, rear,.. racing type disc
brakes, the safest known and ours
alone.
We named them R2 Super Lark and R2
Super Hawk and had Andy Granatelli
fake them out to the infamous Bonne
ville Salt Flats for final performance
and endurance tests.
We could scarcely believe the results,
but the official U.S. Auto Club timers
confirmed them; R2 Super Lark—l 32
mph! R2 Super Hawk—l4o mph! Two
way averages—under the most punish
ing weather and surface conditions.
That kind of performance, combined
with their gentle ’round-town man
ners, told us these cars were ready.
R2 Super Lark and R2 Super Hawk are
now available on special order at your
Studebaker dealer's.
Flash; front seat safety belts now
come factory-installed on every car
another advance from Studebaker.
