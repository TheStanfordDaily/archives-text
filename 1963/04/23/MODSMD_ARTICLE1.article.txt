# Dissident Young Soviet Writers Threaten Party's Monopoly of Power

Editors’ note; Professor Howe lias permitted
The Daily to excerpt portions of his review of
two books —“Dissonant Voices in Soviet Litera
tnre," edited l>y Patricia Blake and Max Hay
ward, and “People and Life,” by Ilya Ehren
berg—to appear in a coming' issue of the “New
Republic.” This article is the second of a two
part series.

There is a counter-argument, which both
the Soviet regime and its foreign critics seem
to take seriously: Between what the dissident
young writers want and the possible conse
quences of acting upon their desire lies a con
siderable distance. Revolutionary dissatisfac
tion in the past has often begun among people
who regarded themselves not as fundamental
opponents of the state but as its loyal if dis
satisfied supporters.
The dissident writers, even when most sin
cere in their allegiance to Communism, threat
en the party's monopoly of power. They have
no political ambitions, they speak for no po
litical movement, yet it is in the nature of
totalitarianism, both as an ideology and a sys
tem of power, that it regard each deviation as
a potential dissidenee and each dissidence as a

I potential opposition.
KHRUSHCHEV and his accomplices retain
j enough memories of Marxism, or just plain
j realism, to suspect that isolated figures can
I embody the historical dynamism of tomorrow:
! An Evtushenko may unwittingly become the
I intellectual equivalent of a Father Gapon, who
set off the 1905 revolution not as an enemy but
as a loyal subject of the Czar.
Khrushchev's policy—so this argument con
tinues —bears within itself an insoluble con
j tradiction. It requires him either to take fur
ther steps toward liberalization, which can
threaten the Communist monopoly of power to
which he is committed, or to retreat to harsher
rule and perhaps terror, which threatens the
; popularity he has gained through reforms and
I the ease felt by party leaders who need no
j longer fear they will end their days in Siberia.
In this tense situation, writers who may
j want nothing more than to have a bit of free
i dom for their own work, are forced to assume
historical roles they do not desire and may
even fear.
NOW IN SOME long-range sense this analy- [
| sis is probably correct, and the regime can be j
credited with historical shrewdness in suspect- j
I ing that an Evtushenko writing freely today |

could lead to (he far more serious threat of a
Tertz or Arzak publishing in Russia tomorrow.
But I would suspect that, while aware of
such ultimate considerations, there are more
immediate reasons for Khrushchev’s repres
sions. Memories of 1956 remain alive in the
Kremlin, if nowhere else. Inner disputes among
the party bureaucrats can force the hand of
the dominant leaders. The Chinese have a stul
tifying effect. And the Russian bureaucracy as
a whole, getting fatter and more complacent,
finds the idea of experiment in literature and
art offensive to its taste, its security, its self
esteem.
Especially does this seem to be true for that
section of the party leadership which came up
from the peasantry or the urban poor’, and now
revels in a kind of “arriviste” smugness, re
peating the cliches of Marxism with the solem
nity of a Josiah Bounderby repeating the cliches
of utilitarianism. Now that he has made the
Central Committee (only last week Khrushchev
j slapped him on the back and praised his firm
j ness in keeping the local party in line), why
■ should the Communist bureaucrat put up with
j such affronts to his dignity—nay, to his "cul-
S Hire”—as the mumbo-jumbo poems of Vozne- j
I sensky or the donkey-tail paintings of the ex- 1

GHRHNBERG'S BOOK of memoirs is one of
the saddest books I have ever read. It comes
with an air of bravado, bearing promises of
candor. It is written with journalistic skill: he
knows how to compose a sketch that will bristle
with half-visible suggestion, he knows how to
drop a telling phrase, he knows how to draw
the external likeness of a famous writer. But
what he cannot do, or thinks it wise not to do,
is tell the whole truth.
(At this point, Howe cites in what matters
Ehrenburg has not told “the whole truth.” His
conclusion to this point and the review follows.)
Today Ilya Ehrenburg is being harassed by
the Kremlin, and one hopes that he will not suf
fer even a minute fraction of what his col
leagues suffered. But one hopes, too, that the
truth about his past, whether it comes from
him or someone else, will reach the young
writers in Russian who are trying to find a new
say. I believe that the obligation of historical
memory is a sacred one which each generation
must bear. Whether it will make the future any
better, whether it will inhibit the tyrants of
tomorrow or give strength to their victims,
whether it will have any practical use at all, I
do not know. But without historical memory,
it is impossible to be human.

pressionists.
AT THE MOMENT, Ilya Ehrenberg is said
to be a hero among the dissident young in Mos
cow. If so, it is more Khrushchev’s doing than
Ehrenberg’s. For Ehrenberg has not really
earned such a reputation, and among the more
sophisticated of his younged colleagues it may
well be based on a tacit decision to let a full
scrutiny of his career wait until a more con
venient time.
During the Khrushchev years Ehrenberg
has kept a cautious step or two ahead of the
regime, advocating a damper “thaw,” hinting
that the Kremlin will not topple if an abstract
painting is seen by Moscovites, and tempting
young readers with reminiscences of his days
in Paris. But the total history of the man is
dismal, a record of time saving and trimming.
No one, from afar, has the right to demand
heroism of others, especially of people who had
to suffer the terror of Hitler or Stalin; but it
remains indispensible to point out that some
men behaved better than others that Pasternak
didn’t lower himself to the opportunism of an
Ehrenberg, and above all, that it is a piece of
1 effrontery, as well as an injustice to the fallen,
for Ehrenberg not to assume the posture of a
j man dedicated to cultural freedom.
