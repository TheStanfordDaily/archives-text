### RICHARD SUCH 
(Editors’ note: This is the third article in a four-part series
hy Mr. Such. The next article will explain the workings of
“connterforce.”)
Counter force is the widely-ramifying notion of military
theorists, largely associated with the Air Force, that a thermo
nuclear war (which is probably inevitable anyway and not en
tirely undesirable at thatt can be made possible, restoring the
usefulness of the military establishment, if and only if a means
can be found to make war more attractive to civilians that is,
somewhat less murderous. It is obvious that the terrible destruc
tive force of overkill weapons has made obsolete the institution
of war. Lacking the imagination or courage to seek an alterna
tive way of providing for national security and national via
bility and wishing not to upset any vested interests (this is far
from the whole story), our leaders seem to suppose that a solu
tion to the dilemma can be found not in abandoning war ( perish
the thought!), but in limiting its destructive effects —this the
counter-force idea purports to do. It would not restore to war
and end in victory or defeat, but would at least allow us to
‘prevail’—the mystic good of coming out of a war with the
longer of (wo short ends. On the face of things, this is a barely
laudable attempt, but on further inquiry, it is seen that war is
made less unconscionable, certainly not ‘conscionable,’ and that,
in fact, counter-force is probably incapable of working as pos
tulated and makes war an even greater possibility.
It is generally agreed that in his Ann Arbor speech of
June, 1962, Secretary McNamara enunciated a preference to
‘opt’ for a counter-force strategy. (It is important to note that
the Pentagon’s overall strategy is best described as ‘The Mix,’
a melange of strategies appropriate to particular circumstances,
such that, where possible and proper, a future war would be
fought in Guatemalan, Vietnamese, or Korean terms; but what
stands at the apex of this pyramid of strategies and makes its
weight felt throughout is counter-force). More important than
any enunciation, however, is the existing or soon-to-exist capa
bility to implement the counter-force calculus. The United States
at present possesses a four-to-one superiority over the Soviet
Union in terms of nuclear delivery vehicles (who the hare?—
who the hound?). Because of the higher quality of American
weapons, this quantitative superiority might be translated into
a qualitative superiority of, say, ten-to-one. In the event of an
American first-strike, this advantage might approach one him
dred-to-one, or more. (Can we wonder, therefore, that the Soviet
Union would be driven to so desperate a strategem as placing
missiles 90 miles from our shores?) By the middle of 196 i) our
capacity for nuclear attack will have been increased by the
addition of 900 or more Minuteman ICBM's and by the near com
pletion of the Polaris submarine force, which will reach a total
of 41 ships, bearing 636 missiles of a range of nearly 3000 miles.
In 1967, the Minuteman system should number 2000. The Soviet
Union is already staggering economically as a result of the
strain put on that nation by the pace of our armaments build-up
(and, to the greater glory of free men everywhere, has reflected
that svrain in the ‘re-icing’ of the liberalization ‘thaw’); it is
anyone’s guess as to whether or not the Russians can catch up;
the Institute for Strategic Studies in London predicts that they
will fall ever farther behind. Before we begin to gloat over these
facts, it would be well to test their implications.
Thermonuclear war has been avoided thus far because of a
‘balance of terror’—that balance has been radically upset and
may turn even more disproportionate. One cannot help but to
suspect the motives of our leaders in unilaterally abolishing the
modicum of poise and stability which once existed in the mili
tary power struggle and which allowed us. at least, to keep our
absurd teeter-totter grounded on this side of the abyss. But the
abolition of this balance is an essential ingredient of counter
force.
Counter-force purports to restore national viability and se
curity. It would restore viability by making credible a threat
to go to war—such a threat is credible only if our opponents
are convinced that we are willing to go to war—they can only be
so convinced if we are indeed thus willing. To be willing to go to
war a nation must be able to keep its casualties at an ‘accept
able’ level. ‘Acceptability’ is defined as not more than 30 or 60
million dead and the surviving potential to reconstruct the eco
nomic system in ten or so years (so that we can destroy it
again?)—it is a product of the nation of the ‘replaceability’ of
the human body, learned so well in World War 11. Nuclear de
struction can be kept thus limited only if a Soviet strike were
directed not against our cities, but against our forces. The 30
to 60 million people who die anyway (because of their proximity
to military targets, like those living near the Mare Island mis
sile submarine station in San Francisco Bay) are included in the
apt abstraction, ‘counter-force collateral damage.’ Counter-force
claims to restore national security by making it impossible for
the Soviet Union to deliver a first-strike against us—to do so
would he suicidal.
