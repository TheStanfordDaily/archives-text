# PEACE CORPS LETTER
## The 						Peace Corps in Ghana 
### RALPH GILMAN 
(Editors’ note: This is the second section of a four-part
letter written by Mr. Gilman, a Stanford graduate now working
for the Peace Corps in Ghana.)

In P.C. training, the class stayed at the International
House. This was an exciting experience in itself! I met those
who challenged my uni-cultural opinions and who were chal
lenged in return. I left with many new friends. About being
challenged —the professors gathered there for our special classes
were the best I’ve encountered. They put together a course
which included some 15 books, two term papers, plus physical
education. At Stanford I had wondered just how much “indoc
trination” or freedom of action and thought we would get. The
answer came in those lectures. Rather than indoctrination, we
were challenged to defend our culture, political philosophies,
solutions to America’s current problems in civil liberties, racial
prejudice, the Cold War, a mass society, an economy of abun
dance, atomic testing, and more. I found I was the one being dog
matic. For the “vigah” part—-I proved that I could stand on my
head and oven do a cartwheel.
After dinner there were informal lectures, discussions,
movies about Ghana and learning the Ghanian national dance,
called “High-Life.” We were then free to study or get involved
in discussions on prejudices, disarmament, etc., over a glass of
beer at the local Rathskeller. Sometimes these lasted into the
droopy morning.
Those foggy, unreal times were some of the best! They were
also some of the more important, for here I began to learn
about the position of the American negro. Racial prejudice and
segregation is a problem facing American today. Housewives
don’t have to look beyond the corner grocery to find it, nor most
colleges beyond their admissions office. I cannot possibly com
pete with the many books written on the facets and subtilities
of this subject. I did come to realize, though, that I had been
walking around in a protected white cage, oblivious to what was
happening around me.
This was strikingly brought home by one of my friends,
whose story went something like this: Being a negro in the U.S.
is like being an infantry man walking through mined enemy
territory. As long as you keep your place, you are comparatively
safe; as soon as you strike out across the field as a man, you
don’t know when a wrong step will blow you to bits. It’s not the
incident that bother you; it’s the constant, eternal uncertainty.
When you enter a restaurant, you don't know if the owner will
accept you or spit in your eye. To avoid unpleasantness, you
don’t go in. But that’s part of the game too! You begin to wonder
if the rules will ever change and if you’ll not begin to assert
yourself as a person. But more important, you start asking
yourself what kind of man you are. You begin to wonder beyond
all reason if all those things they keep yelling at you could be
true.
Then, and especially here in Ghana, I realize just how false
we sometimes are. Our unspoken, half-formed, underlying be
liefs that a man is more sexually stimulated, slightly homo
sexual, lazy, and easy with money just because he is a negro
are false. Perhaps they might be true of a certain class in society
that our culture has created, hut they are certainly not true of
a race.

liefs that a man is more sexually stimulated, slightly homo
sexual, lazy, and easy with money just because he is a negro
are false. Perhaps they might be true of a certain class in society
that our culture has created, hut they are certainly not true of
a race.

letter written by Mr. Gilman, a Stanford graduate now working

In P.C. training, the class stayed at the International
House. This was an exciting experience in itself! I met those
who challenged my uni-cultural opinions and who were chal
lenged in return. I left with many new friends. About being
challenged —the professors gathered there for our special classes
were the best I’ve encountered. They put together a course
which included some 15 books, two term papers, plus physical
education. At Stanford I had wondered just how much “indoc
trination” or freedom of action and thought we would get. The
answer came in those lectures. Rather than indoctrination, we
were challenged to defend our culture, political philosophies,
solutions to America’s current problems in civil liberties, racial
prejudice, the Cold War, a mass society, an economy of abun
dance, atomic testing, and more. I found I was the one being dog
matic. For the “vigah” part—-I proved that I could stand on my
head and oven do a cartwheel.
After dinner there were informal lectures, discussions,
movies about Ghana and learning the Ghanian national dance,
called “High-Life.” We were then free to study or get involved
in discussions on prejudices, disarmament, etc., over a glass of
beer at the local Rathskeller. Sometimes these lasted into the
droopy morning.
Those foggy, unreal times were some of the best! They were
also some of the more important, for here I began to learn
about the position of the American negro. Racial prejudice and
segregation is a problem facing American today. Housewives
don’t have to look beyond the corner grocery to find it, nor most
colleges beyond their admissions office. I cannot possibly com
pete with the many books written on the facets and subtilities
of this subject. I did come to realize, though, that I had been
walking around in a protected white cage, oblivious to what was
happening around me.
This was strikingly brought home by one of my friends,
whose story went something like this: Being a negro in the U.S.
is like being an infantry man walking through mined enemy
territory. As long as you keep your place, you are comparatively
safe; as soon as you strike out across the field as a man, you
don’t know when a wrong step will blow you to bits. It’s not the
incident that bother you; it’s the constant, eternal uncertainty.
When you enter a restaurant, you don't know if the owner will
accept you or spit in your eye. To avoid unpleasantness, you
don’t go in. But that’s part of the game too! You begin to wonder
if the rules will ever change and if you’ll not begin to assert
yourself as a person. But more important, you start asking
yourself what kind of man you are. You begin to wonder beyond
all reason if all those things they keep yelling at you could be
true.
Then, and especially here in Ghana, I realize just how false
we sometimes are. Our unspoken, half-formed, underlying be
liefs that a man is more sexually stimulated, slightly homo
sexual, lazy, and easy with money just because he is a negro
are false. Perhaps they might be true of a certain class in society
that our culture has created, hut they are certainly not true of
a race.
