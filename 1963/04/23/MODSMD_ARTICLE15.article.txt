the Stanford netters by winning
their 36th straight against the

Rain also caused several delays

of the opposition. “The team is
playing better against them.” he
said, “and we’re getting close to
catching them.”
Renker added that Stanford’s
top player, Yoshi Minegishi play
ed quite well against the Bruin's
Charles Pasarell, who is the tenth
ranked player in the country.
“The only difference between the
two players was Pasarell’s
serve,” he said.
