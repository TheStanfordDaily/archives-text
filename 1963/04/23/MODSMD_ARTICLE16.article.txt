Looping a cool head amidst
Oregon State trickery, coxswain
Mike Hanley steered the Stanford
varsity crew to a convincing
length-andahalf victory over

OSLI on the Willamette River in
Corvallis, Oregon on Saturday.
THE BEA\ ERS, who hart been
beaten earlier this month by
Stanford, pulled their usual she
nanigan of assigning themselves
to the inside lane, thereby avoid
ing much of the force of the op
posing six-mile-per-hour current.
Even though the judges in the
launch hollered at the Beavers to
get back in their lane, they
wouldn’t, so Hanley moved the
Indian shell closer to the bank to
calmer water. When OSU wanted
to move back out to midstream
in order to bypass of bridge pier,
Hanley forced them to stay next
to the bank until the very last
moment, and consequently the
Beavers went through some
rough eddies, while Stanford
glided under the bridge on calm
waters.
AFTER THAT, Hanley maneu
vered the Indians over near the
opposite bank, in calm water, and
they rowed on to the win. Oregon
State protested Stanford's mov
ing out of its lane, and Stanford
also protested OSU’s bank-hug
ging tactics. Rather than call the
race no contest, the judges de
cided to let the results stand.
In earlier races, the freshman
second string crew rowed 1650
meters to a tie with the Reaver
yearlings. The OSU frosh were
at first ecstatic, thinking they
had lied the boat that beat the
Cal frosh. until someone deflated
them with the sad news that their
opponent wasn’t Stanford's num
ber one frosh boat.
THE STANFORD JV’s lost
badly, by more than four lengths,
to the OSU JV's. They have yet
to win a race this year, but have
a disadvantage. They are oars
men who couldn’t make the var
sity squad, whereas most other
schools have a separate ,iV crew,
with its own first and second
team.
Stanford meets UCLA this Sat
urday down south for the In
dians’ fifth race of the year.
Their dual record is 3-1.

rough eddies, while Stanford
glided under the bridge on calm
waters.
AFTER THAT, Hanley maneu
vered the Indians over near the
opposite bank, in calm water, and
they rowed on to the win. Oregon
State protested Stanford's mov
ing out of its lane, and Stanford
also protested OSU’s bank-hug
ging tactics. Rather than call the
race no contest, the judges de
cided to let the results stand.
In earlier races, the freshman
second string crew rowed 1650
meters to a tie with the Reaver
yearlings. The OSU frosh were
at first ecstatic, thinking they
had lied the boat that beat the
Cal frosh. until someone deflated
them with the sad news that their
opponent wasn’t Stanford's num
ber one frosh boat.
THE STANFORD JV’s lost
badly, by more than four lengths,
to the OSU JV's. They have yet
to win a race this year, but have
a disadvantage. They are oars
men who couldn’t make the var
sity squad, whereas most other
schools have a separate ,iV crew,
with its own first and second
team.
Stanford meets UCLA this Sat
urday down south for the In
dians’ fifth race of the year.
Their dual record is 3-1.
