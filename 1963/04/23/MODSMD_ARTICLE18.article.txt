### 
A surging Stanford baseball
team meets resurgent Santa
Clara this afternoon in Santa
Clara. The teams are fighting for
second place in the CIBA behind
leading UCLA.
FCI.A AND California met in
a double-header yesterday. The
Bruins could not have lost their I
leadership even if the winless |
Bears swept the twin-bill, a doubt
ful possibility. Not including the
results of the double header, the
standings now read:
UCLA 7 3
Stanford 3 2
use 2 2
Santa Clara 3 ■!
California 0 4
Through a scheduling freak i
UCLA has played 12 league con
tests, five more games than any
other team, so no team can he
counted out. The Trojans are in
especially good position, since |
they have only two games re
maining with UCLA and two |
with Stanford. Their remaining |
eight are with tail enders Cal and
Santa Clara.
STANFORD has two left with
USC and UCLA, three with Santa
Clara, and four with California.
The Indians have four games this
week. They moot Santa Clara to
day and Friday down the Penin-1
sula, and face the Trojans for
the last time in 1963 in a double
header Saturday.
Stanford Coach Dutch Fohring
plans to use Warren Newell
against Santa Clara this after j
noon. Newell hasn’t won or lost
for Stanford this year, but more
important, he hasn’t given up an
earned run in 24 innings. Either
of Stanford’s ace right-handers
Jim Lontaorg or Darrell Suther
land is available for relief.
Fehring’s pitching rotation for
the rest of the week is anybody’s
guess. A possibility is Dick Kova
cevich Friday against the Bron
cos and Lonborg and Sutherland
against the Trojans.
KOVACEVICH is t-0 this year.
Lonborg is 5-4, 2-1 in the CIBA,
and has given up two earned runs
in 27 league innings. Sutherland
is 1-1 in the CIBA and 4-1 over
all. He has given up two earned
runs all year,
A possible Stanford starting

lineup this afternoon would in
clude Joel Slmlman, shortstop;
Bobby Cox, left field; Grep Post,
centerfield; Boh Hollmann, first
base; Newell, pitcher; Gary
Smith, third base; George Thach
er, second base; Kovacevich, right
field; and either Jim Seckler or
Chuck French, catcher.

against Santa Clara this after j
noon. Newell hasn’t won or lost
for Stanford this year, but more
important, he hasn’t given up an
earned run in 24 innings. Either
of Stanford’s ace right-handers
Jim Lontaorg or Darrell Suther
land is available for relief.
Fehring’s pitching rotation for
the rest of the week is anybody’s
guess. A possibility is Dick Kova
cevich Friday against the Bron
cos and Lonborg and Sutherland
against the Trojans.
KOVACEVICH is t-0 this year.
Lonborg is 5-4, 2-1 in the CIBA,
and has given up two earned runs
in 27 league innings. Sutherland
is 1-1 in the CIBA and 4-1 over
all. He has given up two earned
runs all year,
A possible Stanford starting

lineup this afternoon would in
clude Joel Slmlman, shortstop;
Bobby Cox, left field; Grep Post,
centerfield; Boh Hollmann, first
base; Newell, pitcher; Gary
Smith, third base; George Thach
er, second base; Kovacevich, right
field; and either Jim Seckler or
Chuck French, catcher.

team meets resurgent Santa
Clara this afternoon in Santa
Clara. The teams are fighting for
second place in the CIBA behind
leading UCLA.
FCI.A AND California met in
a double-header yesterday. The
Bruins could not have lost their I
leadership even if the winless |
Bears swept the twin-bill, a doubt
ful possibility. Not including the
results of the double header, the
standings now read:
UCLA 7 3
Stanford 3 2
use 2 2
Santa Clara 3 ■!
California 0 4
Through a scheduling freak i
UCLA has played 12 league con
tests, five more games than any
other team, so no team can he
counted out. The Trojans are in
especially good position, since |
they have only two games re
maining with UCLA and two |
with Stanford. Their remaining |
eight are with tail enders Cal and
Santa Clara.
STANFORD has two left with
USC and UCLA, three with Santa
Clara, and four with California.
The Indians have four games this
week. They moot Santa Clara to
day and Friday down the Penin-1
sula, and face the Trojans for
the last time in 1963 in a double
header Saturday.
