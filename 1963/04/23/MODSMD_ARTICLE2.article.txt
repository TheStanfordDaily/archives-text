# Right-Wing Publisher Asserts Power of Democrats Declining
## 
### Rv MADELINE PUZO 
William Rusher, publisher of the National Review and, as he
calls himself, a "life-long Republican,” declared yesterday that
the Democrats are rapidly losing strength to the Republicans.
According to Rusher, beginning with the post-Reconstruction
years and continuing up through 1932, there developed a political

•concensus which successfully
produced Republican presidents.
In 1932, although the Midwest re
mianed Republican, and the
South remained Democratic, the
industrial states of the north
eastern United States switched
from Republican to Democratic
preference.
NOW, HOWEVER, the Demo
cratic consensus is in ‘deep
trouble,’ he claimed. Since the

death of Roose
velt, it has never
been as power
ful as the Re
publican was.
Rusher pr e
dicts the North
east and Mid
west will remain
the same, but
the South will
move toward the
GOP. In order
to carry the

South in 1964. a conservative can
didate is needed, he said. Gold
water, whom Rusher describes as
a strong “Lincolnesque type of
personality,” is the only candidate
who will be able to do this, the
publisher continued.
He compared Rockefeller and
Goldwater to two triangles of
popularity; one inverted and with
narrow popular support spread
ing out to broad popularity at
the top of the party, and the lat
ter with a wide, solid base of
popularity among the people
which narrows at the top.
Rusher concluded that Rocke
feller’s only dowry to the Re
publican party is money, not
votes, and that only Goldwater
could be expected to win in 1964.
