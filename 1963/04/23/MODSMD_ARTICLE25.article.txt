# IIR Plans CONTACT For Foreign Students
## 
### 
Next fall the HR will start a
new program for the incoming
foreign students; the new pro
gram will be called CONTACT.
This program will attempt to help
foreign students to become ac
customed to the complexities of
the University.
Each incoming foreign student
will be introduced, through a
summer correspondence, to a
specific Stanford upperclassman
or graduate student who will
meet him in the fall. The Stan
ford student will help him
through registration and be avail
able for discussion and advice.
The HR feels that the program
will be officially over after the
first two weeks of fall quarter,
but they hope that many lasting
friendships will result from this
program.
Any undergraduate or gradu
ate student who is interested in
being introduced to a foreign stu
dent is urged to sign up for an in
terview' at the HR loft in Tresid
der any time before Friday,
April 26.
