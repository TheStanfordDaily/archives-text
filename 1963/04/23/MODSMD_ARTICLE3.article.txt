# MRA's 'El Condor' To Be Shown by IIR
## 
### 
The Latin America desk of the
HR in conjunction with the Moral
ReArmamenl organization will
present the movie “El Condor”
this afternoon at 4:15 in room 274
of Tresidder Union.
The movie has been adapted
from the play of the same name,
which was written by the stu
dents of San Marcos University
in Lima, Peru—the same ones
who stoned Vice-President Nixon
several years ago. The play has
been presented throughout South
America, where it has been ac
corded widespread praise. The
students are currently in Italy
giving the play.
THE STUDENTS, once ex
treme left-wing radicals, were ex
posed to moral re armament and
decided to write the play and
work towards uniting North and
South America on ideological
bases.
The movie, according to MRA
spokesmen, ptesents the feelings
of these students for their con
jtinent and country, and their
ideas on the relationship of their
country to the United Slates. The
scope of the movie is broadened
by the fact that the students
i come from nine Latin America
i countries.
The movie points out that the
change in these students was
brought about by MRA and
caused them to give up their
radical political views.
