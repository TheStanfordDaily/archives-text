Ihe American Academy of Arts
and Sciences, the Avery Hopwood J

He is also the author of several
books of poetry and criticism,
the most famous being “How
Does a Poem Mean?”
According to Stanford English j
Professor Claude Simpson, a j
long-time friend of his, Ciardi |
“has a dynamic personality, and [
his poetry has a rugged, asser- 1
live quality. He speaks his mind j
freely and candidly.”
Ciardi is eating dinner in the
dining room of Madera House in j
Wilbur and will be introduced at j
his speech by Madera’s faculty
resident, Dr. Lawrence G. Thom
as, of the Education Department. |
COWLEY IS the first occupant j
of the world’s first endowed chair I
in higher education. Internation-1
ally renowned for his teaching, |
researching, lecturing, and writ- 1
ing, Cowley is known for his at
tacks on what he calls “myths”
about trustees and presidents.
Lay boards of trustees, he con- j
tends, are not an American in- [
vention nor modeled on U.S. com
mercial corporations. Both lay j
boards and the academic presi-1
dency have long-standing prece- j
dents in continental universities. |
