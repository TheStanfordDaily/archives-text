Peoplc-to-People.
In ceremonies held last night
at Tresidder Union Frank Con
way, regional representative of
the national organization, pre

operation since January, 1963.
UNIVERSITY People-to-People
is an organization whose purpose
is to bring students of various
nationalities into closer contact
and communication with the hope
that this will result in greater
understanding of diverse back
grounds and a positive attitude
toward international friendship.
The organization was estab
lished at the University of Kansas
in the spring of 1961. It has since
expanded into a program with
chapters on over sixty campuses
across the United Stales and pi
lot programs in several European
countries.
The goal of University People
to-People is to involve students
in activities that will bring them
into contact with individuals of
other nationalities. Because it is
an organization that operates on
the campus, most of its programs
place precedence on the idea of
student-to-student contact. How
ever, University Peopled o-People
also values the opportunity to
promote contact between students
of one nationality and non-stu
dents of another. This type of
contact occurs in the hosting, job
placement, and student ambassa
dor programs.
BROTHER-SISTER programs
establish student counterparts
for international students coming
to the host country. Students
I from the host country greet the
arriving foreign students upon
arrival and assist in housing,
j registration, and other necessary
areas to introduce the interna
i tional students to the campus sit
! nation.
Hospitality groups arrange
I farm tours, industrial tours.

placement in homes for week-|
end and vacation periods. They!
also coordinate such community |
activities as picnics, international j
festivals, and banquets.
Forum groups establish speak
ers and panel discussion groups
for campus programs and com
munity groups making requests.
Panels consist of several nation
alities who have lists of prepared
topics for these presentations.
Outside speakers are brought to
the campus and community by
this group.
EMPLOYMENT groups contact
potential employers to secure
summer and part-time employ
ment for foreign students. These
groups conduct interviews and
orientation sessions for interna
tional students who desire em
ployment. An employment ex
change program is also coordi
nated through the local campus
chapters.
Student Abroad committees as
similate information on all coun-)
tries in the world and set up an
information center for students!
wishing to travel abroad. The I

j committees interview and select
student ambassadors for summer
I trips. They also conduct orienta
j lion sessions presented by inter
mediate students on countries to
be visited—to bo attended by stu
dent ambassadors selected.
Student ambassadors are chos
en because they have shown an
I interest in people from other
parts of the world and will help
in establishing the contact neces
sary to improve understanding.
Each student ambassador pre
pares himself for his travel by se
lecting a program area and do-
I veloping an itinerary. The avail
able areas are: The Romance
Language countries, Central Eu-
I l ope, Scandinavia, Ireland and
i the United Kingdom, the Eastern
! Mediterranean area, and Mexico.
Of approximately 350 Ameri
