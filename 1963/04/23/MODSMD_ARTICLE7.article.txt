# CLASS OFFICERS CHARGE:
## Frosh 'Mis-Handled' Government Break-up 
### MARILYN FRYE 
The freshman class executive committee “mis-handled” the
problem of class government dissolution, the sophomore, junior,
and senior class presidents charged yesterday.

and all expressed skepticism*
about whether the functions of
class government might be better
performed by some alternative
organizations or might be
changed.
Richard Hillman interprets the
frosh action as “indicative of a
negative attitude.” The ex-com,
he said, could have taken a posi
tive approach by working
through the ASSU to broaden the
scope of class government. He
cites as an example of such ex
pansion the operation of the jun
ior class government as a pres
sure group to effect changes such
as in the University grading sys
tem.
MARSHALL TURNER explain
ed that all of the class officers
in recent years have been disil
lusioned to some extent about the
place of class government. Tur
ner said the freshman officers
take this problem more seriously
than the others, but that they
are right in deciding that the
school is not oriented about
classes and that the function now
served by their governments
could be better served in some
other w’ay.
John Bryson, sophomore presi
dent, objected to the resignations
mainly on the grounds that what
ever improvements arc needed in
the present organizations can be
made through appropriate
LASSU action, and such action
would bo facilitated by the avoid
ance of a “big political flourish.”
Declared Bryson in a letter to
The Daily:
“I must take issue with the
freshman class president’s state
ment that there are no necessary
functions that class governments
can perform. Class governments
I do perform a service for the cam
pus—that of .putting on social
events for the campus as a whole.
I have found this year that ef
forts in other areas, although
sometimes well received, involve
overlapping into the realms of
other campus organizations.
“I FEEL that the only justifi
cation for the abolition of class
I government would be on the
grounds of efficiency: Could an
other body perform this function
more efficiently? A more effici
ent body could be sot up in the
form of a social committee under
the office of the ASSU vice-presi
| dent. Such a committee would be
able to better regulate campus
social functions. In this way it
would overcome the duplication
of efforts which now exists.
“For these reasons, I notified
the ASSU president last week
that I was going to propose to
the Legislature at its next meet
ing the abolition of class govern
ment in favor of an all-campus
social committee under (he ASSU
vice-president and a senior class
graduation committee. I hope
that the class officers of all the
classes will be able to got to
gether and present such a pro
posal to the legislature in order
that something constructive may
come out of all the recent discus
sion on class government.
In another letter to The Daily,
the freshman class ex-com indi
cated that they see their action
as (he only constructive alterna
tive available to them. They have
| concluded that “no rationale, so
cial or political, exists which jus
tifies the continuation of a class
| organization.” They consider
j their action as final, “contrary to
I the intimation” in the article in
yesterday’s Daily that the ex
| com was contemplating a re-con
sideration of its decision.
THE DISSENTERS in the vote
which approved the resolution to
abolish class government disap
proved on the grounds that the
action taken was loo hasty.
Susan Henderson, who cast the
only negative ballot in the vote
on the resolution, said that she

Marshall Turner, 63, Richard Hillman, 64, and John Bryson,
’65, criticized the methods and aims of the freshman class officers

“was not voting for class govern
ment, but rather against the pro
cedure by which it was abolish
ed.”
According to Miss Henderson,
the members of the ex-com were
not informed before the meeting
that this issue was on the agenda
and thus could not be prepared
to offer arguments for or against
the resolution.
Further, she points out that the
ex-com is not an elected body and
thus cannot claim to represent
the class. The procedure of the
dissolution was also complicated
by a discussion in the meeting as
to whether a quorum was pres
ent; only 24 of the 48 members
of the board were present.
MISS HENDERSON said that
those complications were ignored
because if the resolution is to be
effective, it must be put through
before next Saturday, which is
the deadline for submitting peti
tions for nominations for next
year’s sophomore class officers.
According to Miss Henderson,
this need for haste precluded a
careful examination of the con
stitution of the body to discover
more acceptable procedures and
also was taken to exclude the
possibility of submitting a pro
posal on class government to a
LASSU ballot.
She said a bettor solution
would have been to have “the
class officers and members of
the commission resign in protest
against the general apathy of the
freshman class.”
MISS HENDERSON continu
ed: “Feeling that this would still
give glory hounds the opportuni
ty to re-organize the government,
the officers determined on a more
radical course by which all the
funds collected from class card
sales will bo returned to the pur
chasers. Any future attempt to
organize a government will have
to be done without funds, and
thus will be almost impossible.
While the goal of abolishing class
government may be warranted by
the general lack of enthusiasm in
class activities, it should be done
by a vote of all concerned rather
than by the unilateral action of
the officers with the support of
some of their friends to give the
action the appearance of legali
ty.”
ASSU President Arinin Rosen
cranz replied to questions re
garding class government by de
claring it a political issue. The
matter would come up at the

THE DISSENTERS in the vote
which approved the resolution to
abolish class government disap
proved on the grounds that the
action taken was loo hasty.
Susan Henderson, who cast the
only negative ballot in the vote
on the resolution, said that she

Marshall Turner, 63, Richard Hillman, 64, and John Bryson,
’65, criticized the methods and aims of the freshman class officers

“was not voting for class govern
ment, but rather against the pro
cedure by which it was abolish
ed.”
According to Miss Henderson,
the members of the ex-com were
not informed before the meeting
that this issue was on the agenda
and thus could not be prepared
to offer arguments for or against
the resolution.
Further, she points out that the
ex-com is not an elected body and
thus cannot claim to represent
the class. The procedure of the
dissolution was also complicated
by a discussion in the meeting as
to whether a quorum was pres
ent; only 24 of the 48 members
of the board were present.
MISS HENDERSON said that
those complications were ignored
because if the resolution is to be
effective, it must be put through
before next Saturday, which is
the deadline for submitting peti
tions for nominations for next
year’s sophomore class officers.
According to Miss Henderson,
this need for haste precluded a
careful examination of the con
stitution of the body to discover
more acceptable procedures and
also was taken to exclude the
possibility of submitting a pro
posal on class government to a
LASSU ballot.
She said a bettor solution
would have been to have “the
class officers and members of
the commission resign in protest
against the general apathy of the
freshman class.”
MISS HENDERSON continu
ed: “Feeling that this would still
give glory hounds the opportuni
ty to re-organize the government,
the officers determined on a more
radical course by which all the
funds collected from class card
sales will bo returned to the pur
chasers. Any future attempt to
organize a government will have
to be done without funds, and
thus will be almost impossible.
While the goal of abolishing class
government may be warranted by
the general lack of enthusiasm in
class activities, it should be done
by a vote of all concerned rather
than by the unilateral action of
the officers with the support of
some of their friends to give the
action the appearance of legali

ASSU President Arinin Rosen

Rosencranz said that if class
government fails to .justify its

The freshman class executive committee “mis-handled” the
problem of class government dissolution, the sophomore, junior,

about whether the functions of
class government might be better

Richard Hillman interprets the
frosh action as “indicative of a
negative attitude.” The ex-com,
he said, could have taken a posi
tive approach by working
through the ASSU to broaden the
scope of class government. He
cites as an example of such ex
pansion the operation of the jun

as in the University grading sys

MARSHALL TURNER explain

in recent years have been disil

place of class government. Tur

take this problem more seriously
than the others, but that they
are right in deciding that the
school is not oriented about
classes and that the function now
served by their governments
could be better served in some
other w’ay.
John Bryson, sophomore presi

mainly on the grounds that what
ever improvements arc needed in
the present organizations can be
made through appropriate
LASSU action, and such action
would bo facilitated by the avoid
ance of a “big political flourish.”
