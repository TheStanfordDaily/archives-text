# Change Class Government Structure
## 
### 
The Freshman class ex-tom passed a motion Sunday night
that â€œthe government of the class of 1966 be dissolved effec
tive April 25, 1963." The motion also asked that LASSU pass
a motion which would bring about the total dissolution of
class government over a three-year period.
The dissolution of class government in its present form
is not a new idea. A similar resolution was presented to
LASSU last fall, but w as lost in the By-Laws Committee. The
motion was not presented for a final vote because the presi
dents of the classes asked that they be given time during the
year to show that the class governments could be of value.
This has not been shown. In fact, John Bryson, Sophomore
Class President, drew up a motion two weeks ago for pre
sentation to LASSU which would ask for a reformation of
the class government structure.
The class government structure certainly should be
changed, but need not be dissolved entirely. Class govern
ments serve a definite social purpose. They are the only
structures large enough to sponsor some of the larger dances
and activities. In their present form, however, they tend to
duplicate their activities. They tend to present too much of
the same kinds of activities within a short time. Few of the
events are well attended, and traditionally they all lose a
great deal of money.
A much more profitable and well coordinated set of activi
ties could be presented by putting the class organizations
under the supervision of the office of (he ASSU Vice-Presi
dent, who could coordinate the social events which are the
only products of the class governments.
The Freshman class officers, however, chose a poor and
impractical method of attempting to point out the inadequacy
of class government. The resignation of the officers can only
produce a great deal of pointless controversy, and violates the
trust which the class members placed in them at election time.
The only justification for the officers resigning as they did is
as a last resort. Their resignation was definitely not a last
resort, as they had not attempted to pass their ideas through
the conventional channels. In addition, the officers had not
received the approval of their constituency for w hat they did.
It is very unfortunate that the Freshman Class officers took
the kind of action that they did.
This does not, however, take away from the fact that the
class government structure should be changed.
