Mow well would Stanford pitch
ers Jim Lunhurg and Darrell
Sutherland do if Stanford got
them some runs? The Indians
got six hits in Sunday’s double
header with UCLA, and no earned
runs to hack up the two tall
right-handers.
Yet Stanford won because the |
[ Bruins got only four hits and one 1
| run, earned or otherwise. In five!
I league contests Lonborg and !
i Sutherland have allowed only j
four runs, three earned, and yet,
! because of light batting support,
| the Indians lost two of them.
Lonborg has an earned run aver
age of close to 1.5 per nine in
| nings and yet has lost four games
[ this year, while winning five.
Sutherland has allowed two earn
ed runs all year and yet lost a
game to USC 1-0 because of a
double steal.
