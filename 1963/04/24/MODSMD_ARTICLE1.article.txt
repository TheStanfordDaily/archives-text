# Ciardi: Liberal Arts Education Needs Experience, Not Exams
## 
### BILL MOORE 
Education can he accomplished only through experience, “not
through syllabuses and objective tests,” poet John Ciardi told a
Tuesday Evening Series audience last night.
“The real purpose of a liberal arts education, he said, “is to
get us into contact with what the human race has been doing

—and how we’re feeling.”
Ciardi. a controversial colum
nist and poetry editor for the
“Saturday Review.” also leveled
a blast at “those who have more
answers than questions in life.”
The difference between the edu
cated and the non-educated man,
Ciardi continued, is that the for
mer asks questions.
According to the poet, there
are two kinds of education: “the
kind that has all the answers in
the back of the book and the
kind that you have to start with
nothing but questions.”
He cited high school physics
and English teachers. “Physics
is taught in high school much
better than English,” he said,
"because the physics teacher
doesn’t have to be human. All he
has to do is lead his students
through the course like a ma
chine.”
But, he added, a good English
teacher can begin only by asking
questions.
Ciardi also told his audience
that more poems “die of decency”
than of any other causes. “At
Saturday Review we see (his all
the time—those tenable, ‘decent’
poems that are all in favor of
God, motherhood, love, and coun
try. But unfortunately they never
got down to the more basic
things.”
The poet outlined two types of
poetry—horizontal and vertical.
The horizontal poem, he said, has
widespread though not lasting
appeal. But the vertical poem has
an historical appeal.
"When art is great.” he pointed
out, “more people participate in
it and appreciate it throughout
time. It has the experience of the
human race stored up in it.”
Ciardi was also articulate on a

number of other subjects.
On read i n g, speed-reading
courses: “They’re good for things
you don’t have to have fe( ling
for, things that aren’t art. But
imagine, for instance, judging an
| orchestra conductor by the speed
in which he goes through a
score.”
1 On popular poet Eddie Guest:
i “Ridiculous.”
