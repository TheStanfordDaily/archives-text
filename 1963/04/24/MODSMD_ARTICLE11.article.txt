# Cowley Says Higher Education Reforms Should Be Reformed
## 
### CHARLES McBRIAN 
We have made great reforms in
education, but now we need to
“reform tire reforms,” said Stan
ford Professor of Higher Educa
tion W. H. Cowley yesterday. His
speech was delivered as a part of
the series on the “revitalization
of the liberal arts.”
COWLEY POINTED to the
complete lack of specialized edu
cation which prevailed in the last
century. Harvard in 1823 empha
sized Latin, Creek, divinity, and
arithmetic, the same subjects
which prevailed in medieval
times. No student was allowed to
take a major; in fact, there were
no separate departments to ma
jor in. Graduate work, as we
think of it, was non-existent. Al
most no research was financed by
the university.
Today the situation is, of
course, ralically different. Cow
ley stated that research and spe
cialized graduate and professional
training arose to fill a definite
need in American education but
at the present time threaten to
overshadow general or “dcmocen
tric” education, which consists of
the typo of knowledge that a doc
tor, for example, might wish to
have about literature, philosophy,
or economics.

According to Cowley the liberal
arts consist essentially of this
“democentric” education, not in
any specific disciplines. Thus an
elementary knowledge of chem
istry might be part of the “lib
eral” education of a prospective
historian.
A MAJOR REASON that demo
centric education is under-empha
sized is that graduate education
is not oriented toward producing
non-specialized courses for the
general student.
Furthermore, the incentives for
such teachers in terms of promo
tion and academic “respectability”
are not very high: “Often, a fac
ulty member who turns out a
stupid book or stupid article
moves up faster.” Also, certain
professional accrediting associa
tions, such as the American
Chemical Association, demand
highly specialized education.
All these difficulties are large
ly the result of general and
specialized educat ion taking
place within the same institution
and ‘general education has suf
fered for it severely.”
COWLEY STATED that “in all
the groat educational changes of
the past hundred and fifty years
we have had an interplay of dif
ferent types of individuals,”
students, faculty, college adminis
trations, and the general public.
Referring especially to the role
of students in these changes, Cow
ley pointed out that the student
body at Harvard in 1823 insti
tuted major reforms by the
“Great Rebellion”—student riots
directed at Latin, Greek, and
arithmetic.
Though presumably not advo
cating such a course of action for
today’s students, Cowley said
that the student who feels him
-1 self cheated, after careful consid
eration and a sincere effort to
understand the issues, should
“rare up on his hind legs and
yell.”

Bowles, the final speaker in the.
ST&T Revitalization of Liberal
Arts program, will speak Thurs
day evening; he is arriving on
campus tomorrow and will be a
guest in residence in Florence
Moore.

tion W. H. Cowley yesterday. His
speech was delivered as a part of
the series on the “revitalization
of the liberal arts.”
COWLEY POINTED to the
complete lack of specialized edu
cation which prevailed in the last
century. Harvard in 1823 empha
sized Latin, Creek, divinity, and
arithmetic, the same subjects
which prevailed in medieval
times. No student was allowed to
take a major; in fact, there were
no separate departments to ma
jor in. Graduate work, as we
think of it, was non-existent. Al
most no research was financed by
the university.
Today the situation is, of
course, ralically different. Cow
ley stated that research and spe
cialized graduate and professional
training arose to fill a definite
need in American education but
at the present time threaten to
overshadow general or “dcmocen
tric” education, which consists of
the typo of knowledge that a doc
tor, for example, might wish to
have about literature, philosophy,
or economics.

According to Cowley the liberal
arts consist essentially of this
“democentric” education, not in
any specific disciplines. Thus an
elementary knowledge of chem
istry might be part of the “lib
eral” education of a prospective
historian.
A MAJOR REASON that demo
centric education is under-empha
sized is that graduate education
is not oriented toward producing
non-specialized courses for the
general student.
Furthermore, the incentives for
such teachers in terms of promo
tion and academic “respectability”
are not very high: “Often, a fac
ulty member who turns out a
stupid book or stupid article
moves up faster.” Also, certain
professional accrediting associa
tions, such as the American
Chemical Association, demand
highly specialized education.
All these difficulties are large
ly the result of general and
specialized educat ion taking
place within the same institution
and ‘general education has suf
fered for it severely.”
COWLEY STATED that “in all
the groat educational changes of
the past hundred and fifty years
we have had an interplay of dif
ferent types of individuals,”
students, faculty, college adminis
trations, and the general public.
Referring especially to the role
of students in these changes, Cow
ley pointed out that the student
body at Harvard in 1823 insti
tuted major reforms by the
“Great Rebellion”—student riots
directed at Latin, Greek, and
arithmetic.
Though presumably not advo
cating such a course of action for
today’s students, Cowley said
that the student who feels him
-1 self cheated, after careful consid
eration and a sincere effort to
understand the issues, should
“rare up on his hind legs and
yell.”

Bowles, the final speaker in the.
ST&T Revitalization of Liberal
Arts program, will speak Thurs
day evening; he is arriving on
campus tomorrow and will be a
guest in residence in Florence
Moore.
