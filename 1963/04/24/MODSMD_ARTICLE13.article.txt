## The 						Usefulness of Fallout Shelters 
### DR. ROBERT E. GREENBERG Scientists’ Committee for Information on Radiation 
(Editors' note: The Scientists’ Committee for Information on
Hudiation is a group of scientists, largely at the School of
Medicine, who have organized in order to interpret to the general
population scientific information, pertinent to major national
and international problems, in understandable and objective
terms. Similar groups are in existence at many universities and
cities throughout the country.)
Construction of fallout shelters is both a personal issue and
one upon which citizens must consider government policy. The
personal issue necessitates understanding of the total effects of
nuclear war, and the relative role of fallout shelters as protec
tion. Government policy must view a shelter program in the
context of international relations, and must consider its effect
on maintenance of world peace. The final decision concerning
shelter construction would also wisely be weighed against
methods of preventing war. It is the purpose of this article to
briefly outline a few of the consequences of thermonuclear war
which enter into the evaluation of the usefulness of fallout
shelters.
Primary immediate consequences of a nuclear attack are
blast, heat and radiation effects. Of equal significance are the
long range effects on the biology of man and other mammalian
species, on the ecology of the bioshpere and on the economy and
socio-political structure of the country. Assessment of the im
mediate impact of a 20 megaton blast and analyses of the
effects of a nationwide nuclear attack have been made by both
governmental and nongovernmental scientists.
Blast effects of a 20 megaton blast above ground, for ex
ample, must be considered in terrris of immediate blast damage,
consequences of building collapse and flying objects. Within a
radius of four to six miles, even the most heavily reinforced
structure would be demolished. Up to ten miles, unreinforced
buildings would collapse and wooden structures would be de
stroyed up to a radius of thirteen miles.
The enormous thermal energy released by such a bomb
blast w'ould set afire exposed clothing up to twenty-one miles
from the hypo-center, and, within a radius of some thirty miles,
most dry, flammable materials would ignite. The possibility of
a fire storm, resulting from coalescence of countless fires
followed by fanning effects of associated winds of high velocity,
would bo great. Should such occur, individuals in shelters would
succumb because of oxygen deprivation and actual incinera
tion. The extent and effects of a fire storm are dependent on
local ground and climatic conditions at the time of nuclear
attack.
Fallout, which is of real significance only beyond the
range of blast and thermal effects, would depend on wind pat
terns at the time of blast. Assuming an idealized pattern, con
tamination of 4000 square miles around the blast would be such
that an unshielded person at the edge of this area would receive
450 rem in 48 hours. Assuming no fire or blast damage, a shel
ter surrounded by 20 inches of concrete would give a protection
factor of 250, reducing the two week accumulative dose to 45
rem. Exposure to radiation upon emergence from the shelter
would probably not he immediately life-threatening, hut would
he productive of definite somatic and genetic effects in the
exposed population.
Survival in the post attack period would be jeopardized by
disot ganization of medical facilities and lack of medical per
sonnel, by destruction of water sources and sewage facilities, by
disruption of transportation and communication media. Should
such an attack come during the dry season so that forests and
farmlands were kindled, far-reaching changes in the ecology of
the biosphere would be produced. Such changes would be pro
duced by radiation itself, since insects and bacteria are more
resistant to radiation than mammals, whereas radiation reduces
the ability of mammals to resist infection. The sequellae of such
effects can only be crudely estimated, but there is little doubt
of their importance.
The above data are fragmentary and incomplete, and are
presented to sketch the total impact of a nuclear attack. How
ever, it is within such a context that protective devices aimed at
only one aspect of the total effects of nuclear war, must be
evaluated.
