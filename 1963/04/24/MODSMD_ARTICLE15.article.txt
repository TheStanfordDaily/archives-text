Here is how counter-force works to provide national se
curity: If the Soviet Union should strike the United States first,
it would necessarily wish to minimize our retaliation: nearly
the whole force of its blow would, therefore, come down upon
our air bases, missile sites, and other military targets. It would
all be in vain, however, for we would have sufficient power in
reserve not only to knock out that part of their forces which
had not been depleted but to retain tire credibility of a threat
utterly to destroy their society if our terms of peace were not
accepted—this, the cruel practice of ‘nuclear blackmail,’ which
holds up the extinction of an unarmed people as (he conse
quence for non-compliance with our demands. The Soviets would
always be deterred from hitting our cities, knowing that we
would repay in kind. Counter-force, or more accurately the
counter-force capacity, has already succeeded in this respect:
national security (in a sense) has been provided for: that the
Soviet Union might launch a surprise attack against the United
States is indeed the last thing in the world that we need worry
about—whatever other morbid aspects of Soviet policy might
he observed, a tendency toward suicide is not among them.
But there is nothing particularly revolutionary about that:
a few missile submarines would perform essentially the same
function--that of making the consequences of a Soviet attack
too high a price to pay for whatever uncertain advantages they
might expect to reap from the initiation of a nuclear war. So
why build the 2000 Minutemen? Why arm ourselves so mightily
that a general would recently have remarked that the Soviet
Union could be destroyed in a nuclear war even if not a single
bomb exploded—by the impact of the metal alone? The answer
is that while a ‘finite’ deterrent, or balanced against that of the
Soviets, would mantain national security, would make a Soviet
first strike impossible, a counter-force capability, an unbalance
of power, restores to war a certain usefulness as an instrument
of national policy, makes war a credibility and a possibility
by no means other than an American willingness to strike first
and accept the consequences.
And here is how that would work: In the event of a Soviet
refusal to accede to an American ultimatum, or where local
conditions forbade the effective use of conventional force, or out
of an urge just to ‘finish the job’ (cf. Gen. Twiningi, a portion
or the overwhelming American nuclear strike potential would
he sent against Soviet forces, destroying much of their retalia
tory capacity—which could not be done without our overplus of
kill-power.
It is not supposed (hat the Soviet capacity could be entirely
wiped out, but with the percentage that survived, our opponent
would be faced with the following three alternatives: hold those
remaining weapons rather than fire them and then be disarmed
(in which case those remaining weapons, on land and sea, would
be systematically sought out and one-by-one destroyed); levy a
retaliatory strike against American forces; or, hit back at
American cities. It is assumed that the Soviet strike would be
directed against our forces, for again they must realize that a
strike against our cities would produce a similar but much more
severe fate for their own. This counter-force retaliation would
be in vain, for the Soviets would not know which forces had
been depleted—and thus would have to strike randomly—and
even then we would still retain enough power to hold their
cities as hostages agains the acceptance of our terms of sur
render—probably none too liberal. But here’s the rub: the
Soviet leaders would surely realize the vanity of a counter
force retaliation—realize that their glorious earthly paradise
would thereafter come to an abrupt end, yet know that if they
struck back at our cities, our society would be so disrupted
that all thoughts of a ‘peace’ settlement unfavorable to the
Soviets would be forgotten. Their society would then be laid
waste itself, but in the meantime they might evacuate their
cities and marshall their active defenses, and the possibility,
however slight, of restoring their system would still lie open.
Who can tell what the Russians would choose?
So to suppose that the counter-force calculus would work
‘according to Kahn’ or the game-theorists, that its implementa
tion would not bring down a terrible vengeance on the Ameri
can people, is a very, very precarious assumption—its precari
ousness multiplied a billion-fold by the nature of the odds. Yet
men in high places do think that it will work and are set about
to risk the life of our nation, to say nothing of the lives of mil
lions upon millions of human beings, on the dubious validity
of that assumption.
Are they indeed? The evidence is before us. We have seen
that fallout shelters are all but useless in a counter-city war,
but that they are essential to the counter-force calculus and its
attendant adventurous policy, wherein they would serve to pro
tect from radiation those fortunate enough to find themselves
some distance from a military target. Fallout shelters serve one
purpose: to limit the extent of ‘counter-force collateral damage.’
Counter-force is representative of the utter ineptitude and
depravity of organized violence—perhaps not nearly so diabolic
as it is half witted—the senility of an organism gone so far in its
dying, thrashing rage that it can in no way be reincorporated
into the human kin that it so unashamedly and absolutely re
jects. Above its roar we are called upon to raise a voice to
affirm what it has not been necessary to affirm since Man first
dared to call himself Man: the power to say ‘No’ to a retreat
from humanity. Yet in accepting the institution, of fallout shel
ters, this University is affirming the opposite, is making an
active contribution to a theory and policy which repudiate every
value for which we are assembled, pose a paramount danger to
the lives of a great portion of our race, and point the road to
ruin for our nation. The choice may be difficult for an adminis
tration pressed by various immediacies, but to my mind there
is litle question but that something is involved which vastly
transcends our everyday concerns and that the withdrawal of
the Stanford shelter facilities should be carried out with resolu
tion and dispatch and with an admonition to our government
against the folly which these facilities represent.

conditions forbade the effective use of conventional force, or out
of an urge just to ‘finish the job’ (cf. Gen. Twiningi, a portion
or the overwhelming American nuclear strike potential would
he sent against Soviet forces, destroying much of their retalia
tory capacity—which could not be done without our overplus of
kill-power.
It is not supposed (hat the Soviet capacity could be entirely
wiped out, but with the percentage that survived, our opponent
would be faced with the following three alternatives: hold those
remaining weapons rather than fire them and then be disarmed
(in which case those remaining weapons, on land and sea, would
be systematically sought out and one-by-one destroyed); levy a
retaliatory strike against American forces; or, hit back at
American cities. It is assumed that the Soviet strike would be
directed against our forces, for again they must realize that a
strike against our cities would produce a similar but much more
severe fate for their own. This counter-force retaliation would
be in vain, for the Soviets would not know which forces had
been depleted—and thus would have to strike randomly—and
even then we would still retain enough power to hold their
cities as hostages agains the acceptance of our terms of sur
render—probably none too liberal. But here’s the rub: the
Soviet leaders would surely realize the vanity of a counter
force retaliation—realize that their glorious earthly paradise
would thereafter come to an abrupt end, yet know that if they
struck back at our cities, our society would be so disrupted
that all thoughts of a ‘peace’ settlement unfavorable to the
Soviets would be forgotten. Their society would then be laid
waste itself, but in the meantime they might evacuate their
cities and marshall their active defenses, and the possibility,
however slight, of restoring their system would still lie open.
Who can tell what the Russians would choose?
So to suppose that the counter-force calculus would work
‘according to Kahn’ or the game-theorists, that its implementa
tion would not bring down a terrible vengeance on the Ameri
can people, is a very, very precarious assumption—its precari
ousness multiplied a billion-fold by the nature of the odds. Yet
men in high places do think that it will work and are set about
to risk the life of our nation, to say nothing of the lives of mil
lions upon millions of human beings, on the dubious validity
of that assumption.
Are they indeed? The evidence is before us. We have seen
that fallout shelters are all but useless in a counter-city war,
but that they are essential to the counter-force calculus and its
attendant adventurous policy, wherein they would serve to pro
tect from radiation those fortunate enough to find themselves
some distance from a military target. Fallout shelters serve one
purpose: to limit the extent of ‘counter-force collateral damage.’
Counter-force is representative of the utter ineptitude and
depravity of organized violence—perhaps not nearly so diabolic
as it is half witted—the senility of an organism gone so far in its
dying, thrashing rage that it can in no way be reincorporated
into the human kin that it so unashamedly and absolutely re
jects. Above its roar we are called upon to raise a voice to
affirm what it has not been necessary to affirm since Man first
dared to call himself Man: the power to say ‘No’ to a retreat
from humanity. Yet in accepting the institution, of fallout shel
ters, this University is affirming the opposite, is making an
active contribution to a theory and policy which repudiate every
value for which we are assembled, pose a paramount danger to
the lives of a great portion of our race, and point the road to
ruin for our nation. The choice may be difficult for an adminis
tration pressed by various immediacies, but to my mind there
is litle question but that something is involved which vastly
transcends our everyday concerns and that the withdrawal of
the Stanford shelter facilities should be carried out with resolu
tion and dispatch and with an admonition to our government
against the folly which these facilities represent.

Here is how counter-force works to provide national se
curity: If the Soviet Union should strike the United States first,
it would necessarily wish to minimize our retaliation: nearly
the whole force of its blow would, therefore, come down upon
our air bases, missile sites, and other military targets. It would
all be in vain, however, for we would have sufficient power in
reserve not only to knock out that part of their forces which
had not been depleted but to retain tire credibility of a threat
utterly to destroy their society if our terms of peace were not
accepted—this, the cruel practice of ‘nuclear blackmail,’ which
holds up the extinction of an unarmed people as (he conse
quence for non-compliance with our demands. The Soviets would
always be deterred from hitting our cities, knowing that we
would repay in kind. Counter-force, or more accurately the
counter-force capacity, has already succeeded in this respect:
national security (in a sense) has been provided for: that the
Soviet Union might launch a surprise attack against the United
States is indeed the last thing in the world that we need worry
about—whatever other morbid aspects of Soviet policy might
he observed, a tendency toward suicide is not among them.
But there is nothing particularly revolutionary about that:
a few missile submarines would perform essentially the same
function--that of making the consequences of a Soviet attack
too high a price to pay for whatever uncertain advantages they
might expect to reap from the initiation of a nuclear war. So
why build the 2000 Minutemen? Why arm ourselves so mightily
that a general would recently have remarked that the Soviet
Union could be destroyed in a nuclear war even if not a single
bomb exploded—by the impact of the metal alone? The answer
is that while a ‘finite’ deterrent, or balanced against that of the
Soviets, would mantain national security, would make a Soviet
first strike impossible, a counter-force capability, an unbalance
of power, restores to war a certain usefulness as an instrument
of national policy, makes war a credibility and a possibility
by no means other than an American willingness to strike first
and accept the consequences.
And here is how that would work: In the event of a Soviet
refusal to accede to an American ultimatum, or where local

lions upon millions of human beings, on the dubious validity
of that assumption.
Are they indeed? The evidence is before us. We have seen
that fallout shelters are all but useless in a counter-city war,
but that they are essential to the counter-force calculus and its
attendant adventurous policy, wherein they would serve to pro
tect from radiation those fortunate enough to find themselves
some distance from a military target. Fallout shelters serve one
purpose: to limit the extent of ‘counter-force collateral damage.’
Counter-force is representative of the utter ineptitude and
depravity of organized violence—perhaps not nearly so diabolic
as it is half witted—the senility of an organism gone so far in its
dying, thrashing rage that it can in no way be reincorporated
into the human kin that it so unashamedly and absolutely re
jects. Above its roar we are called upon to raise a voice to
affirm what it has not been necessary to affirm since Man first
dared to call himself Man: the power to say ‘No’ to a retreat
from humanity. Yet in accepting the institution, of fallout shel
ters, this University is affirming the opposite, is making an
active contribution to a theory and policy which repudiate every
value for which we are assembled, pose a paramount danger to
the lives of a great portion of our race, and point the road to
ruin for our nation. The choice may be difficult for an adminis
tration pressed by various immediacies, but to my mind there
is litle question but that something is involved which vastly
transcends our everyday concerns and that the withdrawal of
the Stanford shelter facilities should be carried out with resolu
tion and dispatch and with an admonition to our government
against the folly which these facilities represent.

Here is how counter-force works to provide national se
curity: If the Soviet Union should strike the United States first,
it would necessarily wish to minimize our retaliation: nearly
the whole force of its blow would, therefore, come down upon
our air bases, missile sites, and other military targets. It would
all be in vain, however, for we would have sufficient power in
reserve not only to knock out that part of their forces which
had not been depleted but to retain tire credibility of a threat
utterly to destroy their society if our terms of peace were not
accepted—this, the cruel practice of ‘nuclear blackmail,’ which
holds up the extinction of an unarmed people as (he conse
quence for non-compliance with our demands. The Soviets would
always be deterred from hitting our cities, knowing that we
would repay in kind. Counter-force, or more accurately the
counter-force capacity, has already succeeded in this respect:
national security (in a sense) has been provided for: that the
Soviet Union might launch a surprise attack against the United
States is indeed the last thing in the world that we need worry
about—whatever other morbid aspects of Soviet policy might
he observed, a tendency toward suicide is not among them.
But there is nothing particularly revolutionary about that:
a few missile submarines would perform essentially the same
function--that of making the consequences of a Soviet attack
too high a price to pay for whatever uncertain advantages they
might expect to reap from the initiation of a nuclear war. So
why build the 2000 Minutemen? Why arm ourselves so mightily
that a general would recently have remarked that the Soviet
Union could be destroyed in a nuclear war even if not a single
bomb exploded—by the impact of the metal alone? The answer
is that while a ‘finite’ deterrent, or balanced against that of the
Soviets, would mantain national security, would make a Soviet
first strike impossible, a counter-force capability, an unbalance
of power, restores to war a certain usefulness as an instrument
of national policy, makes war a credibility and a possibility
by no means other than an American willingness to strike first
and accept the consequences.
And here is how that would work: In the event of a Soviet
refusal to accede to an American ultimatum, or where local
conditions forbade the effective use of conventional force, or out
of an urge just to ‘finish the job’ (cf. Gen. Twiningi, a portion
or the overwhelming American nuclear strike potential would
he sent against Soviet forces, destroying much of their retalia
tory capacity—which could not be done without our overplus of
kill-power.
It is not supposed (hat the Soviet capacity could be entirely
wiped out, but with the percentage that survived, our opponent
would be faced with the following three alternatives: hold those
remaining weapons rather than fire them and then be disarmed
(in which case those remaining weapons, on land and sea, would
be systematically sought out and one-by-one destroyed); levy a
retaliatory strike against American forces; or, hit back at
American cities. It is assumed that the Soviet strike would be
directed against our forces, for again they must realize that a
strike against our cities would produce a similar but much more
severe fate for their own. This counter-force retaliation would
be in vain, for the Soviets would not know which forces had
been depleted—and thus would have to strike randomly—and
even then we would still retain enough power to hold their
cities as hostages agains the acceptance of our terms of sur
render—probably none too liberal. But here’s the rub: the
Soviet leaders would surely realize the vanity of a counter
force retaliation—realize that their glorious earthly paradise
would thereafter come to an abrupt end, yet know that if they
struck back at our cities, our society would be so disrupted
that all thoughts of a ‘peace’ settlement unfavorable to the
Soviets would be forgotten. Their society would then be laid
waste itself, but in the meantime they might evacuate their
cities and marshall their active defenses, and the possibility,
however slight, of restoring their system would still lie open.
Who can tell what the Russians would choose?
So to suppose that the counter-force calculus would work
‘according to Kahn’ or the game-theorists, that its implementa
tion would not bring down a terrible vengeance on the Ameri
can people, is a very, very precarious assumption—its precari
ousness multiplied a billion-fold by the nature of the odds. Yet
men in high places do think that it will work and are set about
to risk the life of our nation, to say nothing of the lives of mil
lions upon millions of human beings, on the dubious validity
