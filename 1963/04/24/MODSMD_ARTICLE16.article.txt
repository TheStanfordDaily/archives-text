Editors, Tin* Daily:
The opinion of the freshman class ex-com regarding class
government is certainly justifiable: large-scale apathy has
plagued freshman class activities from the beginning of Au
tumn Quarter. The actions of the ex-com, however, are certainly
not justifiable. While the ex-com has the right to direct atten
tion to the problem of class apathy, even by the extreme action
of resigning in protest, it does not have the right to decide
whether the freshman class should abolish class government.
Only the Class of 1966, as a whole, has that right. If class
govei’nment is to be abolished or reformed, any such action
must be approved in a class referendum. I agree wholeheartedly
with Miss Henderson’s position that the resolution passed by
the freshman class ex-com was passed without authority and
sufficient discussion. Further, I wish to make the following
propositions:
1. That all freshmen now possessing class cards refuse to
sell them back until a referendum is held.
2. That all freshmen interested in sophomore class office
disregard the ex-com resolution and submit nominating petitions.
3. That the ex-com resolution be referred to the freshman
class either with or prior to the sophomore class elections.
Freshman class government ought to exist as long as the
freshman class, not just the class officers, want it.
Art Stawinski: C lass of '66
Editors, The Daily;
As members of the “apathetic” class of 1966. we would like
to express our apathy. "Our” Ex-com has decided to dissolve
class government. Although we do not object to the abolition
itself, we do object to the method by which the decision was
reached.
1 he Ex-com was not elected by the class. Therefore, we do
not feel that it had the power to make a decision of such im
portance. The class as a whole should have been consulted
through house meetings or referendum.
Of the 48 Ex-com members only 25 attended the meeting,
unaware that dissolution of class government was to be con
sidered. The 23 affirmative votes did not even constitute a ma
jority. Thus, Ex-corn’s decision lacks validity within its own
structure.
