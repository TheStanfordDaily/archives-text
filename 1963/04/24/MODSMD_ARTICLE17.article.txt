## 
### 
The Lit lie Big Baseball Game
between the Stanford and Cal
frosh teams, to be played in
Sunken Diamond today at 3 p.m.,
will match an undefeated team
(Stanford) with another strong
squad (Cali that has played con
siderably more games.
In a season marred by 11 rain
ed-out games, Stanford is unde
feated with a 4-0 record. Thus
far, much of the impetus has
been supplied by the hitting of
pitcher-outfielder Lon Raymond
(.300), catcher Jimmy Hibbs
(.417, two homers, and six RBIs),
and third baseman Tom Mel/er
(.385). The entire pitching staff
has allowed but two runs in 37
innings, with a combined earned
j run average of a measly .486.
Cal has escaped the rain and
sports a 15-2 record.
This weekend the frosh will
host Santa Clara on Friday in
Sunken Diamond at 3:10 p.m.
and play powerful San Francisco
j State in either a single game or a
j doubleheader on the freshman
â–  diamond at 2 p.m. on Saturday,
