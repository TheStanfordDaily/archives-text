# OUR MAN ON THE FARM-
## Why Was 'Big Slosh' Even Held? 
### Glenn Alford 
"Can you believe it?" arked USC trackman Rex Cawley, "We
actually could have lost this thing!” I have to agree with both Caw
I ley’s analysis of the meet and his terminology in describing it.
Stanford could have and indeed should have beaten USC in the
“Big Slosh” held last Saturday on the Foothill College track. And
certainly the only proper word to describe the meet itself is the
word “thing.”
However, the big question in the minds of most people in at
tendance at the meet wasn’t whether Stanford could heat USC, it
was why in the hell was the meet being held in such miserable con
ditions in the first place?
The first question was answered. No, Stanford could not beat
Southern California in the rain without its second and third triple
jumpers.
THE ANSWKK TO THE SECOND question is still unclear to
most people, so an explanation might be in order. Around 9 a.m.

Saturday morning Payton Jor
dan, USC Coach Vern Wolfe and
the USC track squad examined
the Stanford Stadium running
track and found it unusable. USC
Athletic Director, Jess Hill, was
contacted and he gave permission
for the USC team to stay in Palo
Alto 'til Monday, when the meet
would be held.
The Stanford team met at 10
a.m. for the pre-meet meal and
Jordan told them the meet was
off. After the meal the team
scattered. Steve Cort right went
to the Stanford Shopping Center
with a date to go shopping. Sheri
dan Downey and Russ Peterson
decided to go to Santa Rosa for
a bridge turnament. Others took
off to different places.
Then Wolfe had second
thoughts. USC had meets next
Friday, against California, and

Saturday, tin* Ml. Sac Relays, and most of the squad had midterms
j rapidly approaching.
| He talked to Jordan and told him the squad couldn't stay over 1
I 'til Monday. Either USC would meet Saturday or they wouldn’t
I meet at all. Jordan talked to Stanford co-captains and they agreed
j with him that Stanford should take on the Trojans, regardless of
I the conditions, and whether or not all the team members could be
found. It would be Stanford’s only chance this year to face USC in
a dual meet.
TEAM MEMBERS SPREAD OUT to find the missing. Cort-
I right was found in Blum’s, eating ice cream. They discovered that
I Downey and Peterson were on their way to Santa Rosa. Jordan
j notified the California Highway Patrol that Downey and Peterson
| must be found and gave the Patrol Downey’s license number,
j Downey’s mother called the Santa Rosa hotel, where the bridge
| tournament was being held, at 1 p.m., 1:15 and 1:30. They paged
| the lobby, but couldn’t find him.
Finally at 4 p.m. the hotel thought of paging the room where
the tournament was being held. Downey answered the phone and
when he came back to the table where he had been playing he col
lapsed into his chair. Peterson said afterwards the only thing he
could think of that would make Downey so white and sick was if one
of his parents had died. Peterson was equally sick and pale when he
found out that the meet had been held after all, and that a mere
: third in the hop-step, which Stanford could have swept, would have
j saved the meet.
NO ONE (AN DEFINITIVELY SAY one way or the other
whether Wolfe was correct in refusing to compete Monday. Jordan
I said that Stanford is in the same position as SC, with the Drake
Relays coming up next Friday and Saturday, and with midterms
; lacing the Stanford team. He said that Stanford would just have
the meet instead of the usual Monday practice. It would surely take
| less time than a norma] practice.
But Wolfe was adamant. Stanford accommodated him despite
i the risk of weakening the team, and the Indians almost became/
