# Broncos Buck Indians From CIBA Lead, 4-3
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
John Boccabella, whose batting
had not helped Santa Clara one
bit in its defense of the CIBA
title, suddenly name alive with
two home runs and the Broncos
knocked Stanford from the league
lead with a 4-3 win yesterday at
Santa Clara.
BOTH HOMKKS WKKK balls
that would not have been out of
the Bronco ha'l park had not the
outfield fences been moved in
just a few days ago.
Warren Newell pitched the
complete game for Stanford, giv
ing up seven hits and two walks,
while striking out seven.
The Indians blasted Bronco
starting pitcher Nelson Briles
from the mound early. Charley
Marcenero took over in the fourth
inning, allowed a hit to the first
man he faced, and then set down
the Indians with no more safeties
for the rest of the game.
BOCCABKI.I.A opened the scor
ing with his homer in the second
inning, but Stanford came back

in the third to go ahead 2-1. Bob
Cox singled to open the inning
and went to second on Greg
Post's grounder. Boh Hollmann’s
double to the left field fence
brought him in. Hollmann scored
on Gary Smith's fine single to
left.
The Indians stretched their lead
to 3-1 in the fourth with a walk,
a hit batter and Greg Post’s
double. Cox was thrown out at
the plate to end the inning, and
from then on Marcenero was un-
touchable.
Stanford moved into a three
way tie with Santa Clara and
USC for second place in the
CIBA behind UCLA’s 7-5 record.
