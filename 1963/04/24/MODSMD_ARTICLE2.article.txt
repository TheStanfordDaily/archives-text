# Triska Claims U.S. Must Change Rules By Unilateral Action

Bilateral agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union are probably not going to
be effective in the long run, said
Dr. Jan F. Triska of the Political
Science Department yesterday in
a speech on Soviet Foreign Poli
cy. He advocated that the U.S.
start acting unilaterally and
thereby change the “rules of the
Cold War.”
Going on the assumption that
the cold war will be with us for
a long time, it is important to
“keep the center gravity of mili
tary at a low level” Triska stated.
BOTH THE United States and
the Soviet Union are afraid of
each destroying the other. Be
cause of this there has been the
conscious attempt on both sides
to equalize the “bridge gap” and
to surpass the other.
“The symmetry and balance
must be met,” Triska said. The
issue for the United States is,
however, to “realize, perceive,
meet, and match the Soviet chal
lenge and at (he same time to
initiate stimuli of its own into
other sectors,” e.g. in the fields
of legal and social equality, edu
cation, communication.
According to Triska many fac
tors could cause a disruption of
symmetry in military power
which would lead to war: the
failure to ever establish sym
metry and consequently the lead
ing side's decision to utilize its
large gap; the rapid progression
rate of escalation leading to a
progressive breakdown on one
side.
THUS, TO PROLONG war, the
United States must divert energy
to other areas besides military
and to make sure there is parity
in the new sector and the mili
tary.
Concluding with the advocation
to make “parity a statement of
policy,” Triska said, “The cold
war is real and will be with us
for a long time, yet we can regu
late it.”
