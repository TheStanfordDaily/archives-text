### FRED BURBANK 
Michael Cooney, versatile folk singer and musician, will be
presented in concert Friday night, 8-10 p.m., in the informal at

It was about two months ago when 1 first saw Michael Cooney
singing in a small coffee house in San Jose*. He was playing a
five-string banjo when I walked*

MICHAEL COONEY has sung
with Travis Edmonson (now of
Bud and Travis) and with the
blues singer, Barbara Dane. For
throe years he has traveled and
sung in Arizona, California, Colo
rado. Idaho, Oregon, and Wash
ington. As he has traveled, he has
made his living by entertaining
and has expanded his collection
of songs.
For example, when he was sit
ting in the back of a church in
Denver, he noticed two old wom
en across the aisle singing a
slightly modified version of one
of the hymns. As the congrega
j tion was singing “Halleluiah,
! Praise the Lord” they were
double timing the ryhthm and
singing “Halleluiah, I'm a bum.”
He now sings this as one of his
numbers.
HIS CONCERT will bo held in
the dining area of Tresiddcr Un
ion creating an informal atmos
phere and permitting the audi
ence to bring coffee in with them.
Tickets (50 cents each) will be
sold at the Tresidder Box Office
and at the door on Friday night.

in. After about half an hour he
had switched to a six-string gui
tar. Then before his first break
he began playing the twelve
string guitar.
ONE OK HIS numbers was a
child’s lullaby, another a slow
blues, another a catchy honky
tonk, and others blue grass tunes
from the K«, atucky hills. Around
midnight Michael began to draw
the audience into participation
and by one o'clock everyone in
the coffee house was singing and
clapping his hands.
Michael’s performance was so
impressive that when it was com
pleted, I told him that if he wore
interested I might be able to ar
j range for him to present a con
j cert at Stanford’s new student
union. We tentatively set a date
I for April.
I Two months passed and not a
! word from him. Then last week
i when I returned homo from a
| lab, I found him sitting in my
I living room playing a twelve
string guitar. The first thing he
I said was that he hated to write.
' I smiled and replied that I would
start arranging a conceit for the
I 26(h of April.

string guitar.

It was about two months ago when 1 first saw Michael Cooney
singing in a small coffee house in San Jose*. He was playing a
five-string banjo when I walked*

MICHAEL COONEY has sung
with Travis Edmonson (now of
Bud and Travis) and with the
blues singer, Barbara Dane. For
throe years he has traveled and
sung in Arizona, California, Colo
rado. Idaho, Oregon, and Wash
ington. As he has traveled, he has
made his living by entertaining
and has expanded his collection
of songs.
For example, when he was sit
ting in the back of a church in
Denver, he noticed two old wom
en across the aisle singing a
slightly modified version of one
of the hymns. As the congrega
j tion was singing “Halleluiah,
! Praise the Lord” they were
double timing the ryhthm and
singing “Halleluiah, I'm a bum.”
He now sings this as one of his
numbers.
