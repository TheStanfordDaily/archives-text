# Argentine Students Demand Reforms
## 
### SHEILA RICKETTS 
“The Reformista Student Movement had its
origins in the reform movement of 1918.” ex
plained Eduardo Casalderrey, a member of the
movement and a former-president of the Reforrn
ista movement in the Center of Engineering at
the University of Buenos Aires, in a Daily inter
view yesterday.
Casalderrey is one of the Argentine student
loaders, representing the country’s major student
movement, who are visiting Stanford this week.
He is travelling with Carlos Comas, University
of Buenos Aires, Roberto Contreras, University
of Cordoba, and Gonzalo Rubiano, escort-officer
and interpreter for the group.
Casalderrey, speaking through Rubiano, ex
plained the four basic principles of the University
reform movement.
ARGENTINE STUDENTS have demanded and
attained student participation in University gov
ernment as their first goal. The University of
Buenos Aires, for example, is governed by a
Faculty Council and a Superior University Coun
cil.
The Faculty Council is composed of eight pro
fessors, four alumni, and four students and is
presided over by the Dean of the Faculty. The
Superior University Council is composed of five
professors, five students, five alumnae, and one
dean from each of the ten faculties in the Univer
sity and is presided over by the President of the
University.
The second goal of the Reformista movement
is to make the University open to the public. The
movement has helped break the monopoly of the
privileged classes on education.
THE REFORM I ST A has also demanded a peri
odic change in professorships. In other words
there is no tenure for Argentine professors. Fi
nally, the movement has demanded a "public con
test to obtain a professorship. Each professor is
elected according to his record.”
Comas, president of the Huminista League at
the University of Buenos Aires, and Contreras, a

former president of the Integralista Movement of
the Faculty of Economic Sciences at tlie Univer
sity of Cordoba, stated that their groups also sup
ported the University reform policies of the Re
formista Group.
When asked to comment on the current political
activities of the Peronists in Argentina. Casalder
rey commented: “Peron’s name is a myth. They
speculate with Peron’s name to hold together the
masses, but the day Poron’s name disappears, the
masses will disappear. After disintegration, a
very important sector of the masses will follow
a democratic process.
“THIS MASS represents many millions of votes
and various politicians are interested in holding
the movement together as a unit and capturing
it.”
Comas pointed out that Peron was able to take
advantage of the prosperous economic conditions
after World War II and to create "superficial
economic progress.” The “liberating revolution”
found that the economic prosperity was not real
and initiated a program of economic austerity.
During the last seven years the working class
has suffered from depression. They have com
pared these years of hard times with the twelve
years of "fictitious prosperity” under Peron and
have continued to be pro-Peron.
“PERON LEFT THE country in extremely bad
financial condition,” said Molly Brandt of the In
stitute of Hispanic American Studies, clarifying
the issue. "He tried to industrialize very quickly
and let the tremendous agricultural potential of
the country sink.”
Peron had inherited a large overseas credit in
gold, earned by selling food to the British during
the war, and ho wasted it buying such useless
utilities as an obsolete railroad system from the
British, according to Miss Brandt.
The Argentine students will be available for
discussion at the Latin American Luncheon at
the Women's Clubhouse today at noon, after din
ner tonight at Stern Hall, and after dinner tomor
row night at Roble.
