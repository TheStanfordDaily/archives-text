In this case, nepotism's a pretty good idea.
And the best way to get it is through Air Force
ROTC—because the Air Force prefers to com
mission its officers directly upon graduation.
But if you couldn’t fit AFROTC into your
schedule, you can still apply for Air Force
Officer Training School.
OTS offers college men and women an oppor
tunity to assume great responsibility. When
you complete the three-month course, you’ll
be commissioned a second lieutenant, and be
come a part of a vital aspect of our defense
effort. As an Air Force officer, you’ll be a
leader on the Aerospace Team.
We welcome your application for OTS now—
but the same may not be true next year. So if
you’re within 210 days of graduation, get full
information from the Professor of Air Science.
