Result: The experimental Ford Mustang,
lively 2-seater loaded with
significant engineering features
Just under 13 feet long—weight, 1544 pounds, 400 to 700 pounds
less than comparable models of popular imported sports jobs—
the Mustang is representative of the interesting design chal
lenges at Ford Motor Company, Unique ways of reducing weight
without sacrificing strength, to improve performance and
economy, may stem from its design.
For example, seats are an integral part of the Mustang's body,
adding structural rigidity, Brake, clutch and accelerator are
mounted on a movable cluster which can be adjusted fore and
aft (as can the steering wheel) to suit varying sizes of drivers.
Other important features: low-drag, aerodynamic shape proven
in the wind tunnel; independent front and rear suspension; disc
front brakes; roll bar built as an integral part of the body/frame
structure; hot V-4 engine mounted forward of the rear axle in
unit with a 4-speed manual transmission.
The Mustang is another example of how challenging assign
ments met by our engineers and stylists help Ford Motor
Company maintain engineering leadership and provide new
ideas for the American Road.
