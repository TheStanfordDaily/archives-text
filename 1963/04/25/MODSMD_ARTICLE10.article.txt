# Vigil to Be Kept By Peace Caucus
## 
### JAMES POAGE 
The Peace Caucus plans to hold
a continuous vigil protesting that
there has been no public discus
sion between the administration
and student on the advisability of
having fallout shelters on cam
pus.
Beginning today at noon, a
twenty-four-hour vigil will bo
held by the President’s Office
buildings during the day and at
Wallace Sterling’s home at night.
According to Stephen Weiss
bluth, member of the steering
committee of the Peace Caucus,
the vigil will be maintained in
definitely.
Weissbluth stressed that the
vigil is not directed at one in
dividual. but is only an effort to
confront the administration with
the need for public discussion on
the shelter issue which the Cau
cus feels should take place.
The members of the Peace Cau
cus met with Sterling last Tues
day to discuss the issue. Three
members of the Caucus sent the
following letter to Sterling after
the meeting:
“We thank you for the oppor
tunity you have given us to
speak with you personally. After
talking with you we realize the
ways in which our concern can
bo brought to bear on adminis
trative changes.
“We feel the strongest way to
express ourselves to you is to
conduct a continuous vigil. We
vigil to further express our con
cern that the administration seek
a dialogue witli the University
community on issues which sig
nificantly affect us all. The vigil
is an expression of the extent of
our commitment in this matter;
we vigil in the hopes that you
may more fully understand our
commitment and be able to con
sider it with the Board of Trus
tees in the formulation of fur
ther University policy.
“We urge the Administration
to reconsider its refusal to repre
sent, or have represented, its po
sition on fallout shelters in a
public debate. Wo vigil, also, in
the hopes that in the future such
issues can be opened to debate in
the community as an aid and in
fluence in the decision-making
process before the decision is fi
nally formulated.”
Yesterday, Sterling issued a
statement on the issue:
“The University policy concern
ing fall out shelters has been for
mulated as a result of staff dis
cussions, discussions with the
Committee on University Policy,
and with the Board of Trustees.
“While the University encour-
I ages, as a proper educational
enterprise, discussion of matters
concerned with nuclear war, fall
out shelters and other public is
sues, it sees no need to reopen
discussion on its decision to pro
j vide shelters, and therefore does
j not propose to debate the deci
sion.
“It would be well for everyone
| to bear in mind that the Universe
! ty has a responsibility to main-
I tain orderliness on tire campus,
and to see to it that there is no
trespass on private property.”
Weissbluth acknowledged that
every issue can not be debated,
but he said the Caucus felt the
magnitude of the shelter issue re
quired discussion.
