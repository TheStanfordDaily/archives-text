Dont think that anyone who says terrible things arc hap
pening in South Africa is crying wolf,” advised Allard K. Lowen
stein, professor of political science at North Carolina University,
to his audience last night in Tresidder Union.
Discussing “South Africa-The Point of No Return,” Lowen-

stein outlined the development
and spread of violence in the Por
tuguese colonies of southern Af
rica, resulting from the determi
nation of massive Negro organi
zations to overthrow existing gov
ernments controlled by whites.
IN ANGOLA “there is a war—
and it's not to be talked about
lightly,” he asserted. Although
few outsiders are allowed in the
country, reports concerning the
critical situation in Angola have
been pieced together from the
scattered statements of reliable
sources who have visited the
country, and from various An
golan communiques. “We also
know that thousands of refugees
have left the country since the
fighting began in a series of re
volts in 1951,” he stated.
The Portuguese have formida
ble equipment, and “they’re not

fighting a very pleasant war.”
Lowenstein continued. There is
no mercy on either side; armies
have committed mass murders
when they felt terrorization was
needed. Even worse, the warfare
“gives every sign of going on in
definitely.”
Conflict and disturbance are
not confined to Angola, Lowen
stein added. Revolution in Mo
zambique is to start in a year; in
Portuguese Guinea fighting has
already started, and is mounting
in intensity: and in Southern
Rhodesia there is “an immediate
threat of the spread of violence
on a massive scale.”
THE PRIMARY concern in
Southern Rhodesia is whether
the country will gain freedom
from Britain as a nation under
white or under Negro leadership.
The whites, who are in control
now, want immediate independ
ence; African groups oppose it.
In Lowenstein’s opinion, “the
likelihood of fighting is over
whelming . , . intervention is in
evitable.”
PRESENTLY, there is a kind
of “schizophrenic situation” in
South Africa. Many white per
sons are still living well, basical
ly unchanged by the growing
turmoil. But the evidence is “in
disputable” that Africa is “leap
frogging” to a drastic upheaval.
Lowenstein emphasized that
the present conditions in south
ern Africa will have definite im
plications for the United States
in the near future, and urged that
we not remain “unaware, and for
that matter, uninterested.”
