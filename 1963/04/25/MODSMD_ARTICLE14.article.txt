# Attendance at Campus Programs
## 
### 
Last week’s FOCUS program, sponsored by the Political
Union, was attended by a discouragingly small number of
people. The fault did not stem from the program itself, as a
number of excellent speakers delivered talks, seminars and
panel discussions on the relationships of government, business
and labor. The program was extremely timely because of
the rise in steel prices at the same time as the program. The
rise, in fact, required a substitute for scheduled speaker Les
lie W orthington, tin* president of United States Steel.
Even with excellent speakers and a timely subject, only
about fifty people registered for the three-day conference,
and only seven people showed up for the seminars which were
held on Tuesday. The panel discussion, which was open to
the public and was originally scheduled for Memorial Audi
torium, was rescheduled for the Little Theatre, Between 165
and 170 people were present.
Something is very wrong when so few people, in a commu
nity as large as Stanford, are interested in a program of the
quality of FOCUS. In addition. Political Union is not the only
organization with an attendance problem. Stanford Todav and
Tomorrow, which held equally excellent speeches all last
week on “The Revitalization of the Liberal Arts" had very
few people participate in their program.
Why was there such a lack of support for these two pro-
Newspaper, radio, pamphlets and posters were all
used in extensive publicity campaigns, and there is little
doubt that the campus was aware that the programs were
being held. The speakers of both programs were well worth
hearing. The programs were held in the third week of the
quarter, supposedly before midterms and papers deadlines.
The problem is scheduling. The duplicate scheduling of
the Stanford Today and Tomorrow and the FOCUS pro
grams undoubtedly hurt both programs. Duplicate scheduling
was not the only reason for ill attendance, however, because
even on days when there was no direct competition between
programs, neither program was well attended.
A much greater cause for bad attendance to the programs
is the vast over-scheduling of campus events for the past few
weeks. The great number of programs which Tresidder Union
has added to the Stanford calendar, plus all of the other cam*-
pus events of Spring quarter, are simply too many events for
our apathetic and grade-conscious community to support.
