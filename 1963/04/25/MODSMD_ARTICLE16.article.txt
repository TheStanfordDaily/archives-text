# PEACE CORPS LETTER
## The 						Peace Corps in Ghana 
### RALPH GILMAN 
(Editors’ note: This is the third section of a letter by Mr.
Gilman, a Stanford graduate now working for the Peace Corps
in Ghana.)

I didn’t make every class at Berkeley, nor did I read every
honk, but it was a good summer. There was a new feeling of
excitement and of being honed to a peak of intellectual and
physical awareness. Never before had I been so well prepared
to do something. Finally, with information, shots, and exercise
(I felt like a cross between a stuck pig and a walking armoured
tank), I was graduated for the second time in three months.
The Peace Corps is probably the only organization in the world
which gives you a graduation diploma in one hand and malaria
suppressants in the other.
Only three days to pack my belongings and purchase special
clothing and equipment (the Peace Corps was quite thorough in
advice on the latter)—and th(>n off to the National Student As
sociation Convention at Ohio State University; I was just a very
unofficial observer, but became intensely interested as I was
immersed in this world of delegates. Sure, there were people
who had narrow views and who didn’t agree with my equally
narrow ones. Some were mainly interested in playing politics,
but this was offset by the many who were genuinely con
cerned with the world about them and in trying to come to some
conclusions and compromises, rather than leaving it to others.
What the NSA is doing is important and positive, hut its influ
ence is difficult to assess. To me, its main purpose is to pro
vide a means whereby the students at our colleges, who are
struggling to keep their own heads above water, will become
aware of their responsibilities in this world as an educated
minority.
I then moved on to four glorious days in New York City!
On September Ist, 1962, I left “the good old USA’’ with 55 other
Peace Corps Volunteers via first-class chartered flight to Ghana.
After a day and night in the air, we were flying over the
continent of Africa—over the great, multi-green textured plains
dotted with tin and thatched roofs of village huts, huddled in
small halos of foot-packed earth—over the great, wide, brown,
meandering rivers and narrow roads. At the airport, six Rus
sian planes were lined up in neat rows, their tails painted in
Ghana’s colors of red. yellow and green. These were given to
the Ghanian government, but are too big and expensive to use
except for trips to Moscow. So they sit! An impressive display!
My first adjustment was to the atmosphere. Just by rubbing
my fingers together I could feel the dampness. The clothes I
wore became limp and clinging as it was absorbed by this new
environment, but after four days I no longer noticed the hu
midity.
Ghana has no indigenous coal or oil, so she has turned to
hydro-electric power, represented by the Volta River Project
and the Akasambu Dam which, when completed, will hold back
a lake several hundred miles long. Construction has just recently
been started by Kaiser Company engineers and is financed, in
part, by U.S. loans. Ghanians were doing the surveying, driving
the huge earth-moving trucks, operating the steam shovels and
blasting rocks. Some of our group looked around, their eyes
glistening with tears of pride. I suddenly realized this was the
first time we had seen Negroes doing these jobs. This was living,
meeting reality; not prejudice and myth.
For the first few days I was continually tired. A two-hour
shopping trip to Accra wore me out for the remainder of the
day. This was partly due to the new climate and the small case
of dysentary most of us had contracted, but it was mostly due to
lack of familiar cultural ties and to my own awkwardness and
feelings of conspicuousness at being an “obruni” (white man).
The latter was just imagined. Racial prejudice is a foreign con
ception here. Last year a PCV couldn’t explain “prejudice" to
her Ghanian students when they studied “Cry, Beloved Coun
try.” After a week, I was unaware of my color, or lack of same,
as compared to the natives around me. It just didn’t register any
longer.
