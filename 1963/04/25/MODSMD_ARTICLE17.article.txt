## The 						Kennedy-Keating Cuban Policy 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Cuba got a good airing last week before the American Soci
ety of Newspaper Editors, and the significant fact about the
speeches of the President, Secretary Rusk and Senator Keating
was that there is substantial agreement about what the United
States should and should not do. It is hard to say what Mr.
Nixon’s Cuban policy would be. He sounded like a man who was
ready to go to war. But all he actually said what that he wanted
the Cuban exiles to make hit-and-run raids.
Senator Keating, who is the most conspicuous of the criti
cal opposition, began by saying that “it is foolish to pretend
that there are easy answers to the Cuban problem.” He did not
pretend. Then, in the course of his speech, he admitted that he
agrees with the main theses of our present Cuban policy. He is
opposed to an invasion. He is opposed to a blockade. He is op
posed to hit-and-run raids mounted from American soil. He is
in favor of “greater stress on non-military measures,” and he
wants to exert increasing economic pressure so that the Soviets
“will be driven to the conclusion that the price of maintaining, a
base in Cuba is too high.” i '
This is the same story which the administration is telling.
Senator Keating’s differences are ndt'in the substance of the
text, but in the editing, the typography, the layout and the cap
tions. The senator, like the President, excludes in present cir
cumstances the resort to war—invasion, blockade and raiding;
like the President he, too, would deal with Cuba by surveillance,
containment, isolation, economic pressures and propaganda.
How long must we put up with the Russian troops? The
honest answer is that we must put up with them until they can
be gotten rid of by measures short of nuclear war. Here is the
sticking point in the argument with Governor Rockefeller and
Mr. Nixon. They sound, they intend to sound, as if they know a
way to get rid of the Russian troops promptly without waging
nuclear war.
What is this prompter way to make the Russians go away
from Cuba? They do not tell us, but the most reasonable inter
pretation of what they say is that the prompter way is not to
make war, but to threaten war. Both Governor Rockefeller and
Mr. Nixon have avoided saying plainly what they do mean. But if
what they sound like has genuine meaning, it is that they be
lieve the United States can deliver an ultimatum which the
Soviet Union will bow to.
The Rockefeller-Nixon position appears then to be that
( üba can be liberated by ordering the Soviet Union to withdraw
from this hemisphere and to stand by passively while we block
ade Castro and arrange for a replacement of Castro’s govern
ment. If this is what they have in mind, they are making an
enormous guess. For nobody can possibly know that the Soviet
Union would surrender its whole position in Cuba as it sur
rendered its offensive weapons last October. It is the supreme
folly in the nuclear age to drive a nuclear power into a corner.
And if the Soviet Union refused to bow to the ultimatum, all
this would do for us would be to make us look like fools.
The President of the United States cannot play with an ulti
matum to a government like that of the Soviet Union. He cannot
use an ultimatum unless he is prepared to go through with it
and begin a war. If he is not prepared to go to war, an ultima
tum is a bluff, and everyone will soon see that it is.
While the present policy does not promise a quick with
drawal of the Russians or the fall of Castro, it is surely not
true to say that it is complacent, do-nothingism. To a degree
which is just short of war, Cuba is being photographed, pa
trolled, embargoed, squeezed and isolated. If Cuba were a great
power, we would be at war with her for what we are already
doing. I doubt whether there is any precedent where we have
exerted such strong measures short of war on any other country.
However much we are impatient and frustrated, we have to
grasp the fact that Cuba is no military threat to the United
States and is not very much of a threat to Latin America. The
worst of Castro is his example, and a long way after that such
agents as he is able to train and infiltrate into the Latin-Ameri
can countries. He is an affront to our pride, he is a nuisance, he
is a mischief maker. But he is not a mortal threat to the vital
interests of the United States, and therefore, in this age of
thermonuclear war, w'e must deal with him by measures that are
short of war.

This is the same story which the administration is telling.
Senator Keating’s differences are ndt'in the substance of the
text, but in the editing, the typography, the layout and the cap
tions. The senator, like the President, excludes in present cir
cumstances the resort to war—invasion, blockade and raiding;
like the President he, too, would deal with Cuba by surveillance,
containment, isolation, economic pressures and propaganda.
How long must we put up with the Russian troops? The
honest answer is that we must put up with them until they can
be gotten rid of by measures short of nuclear war. Here is the
sticking point in the argument with Governor Rockefeller and
Mr. Nixon. They sound, they intend to sound, as if they know a
way to get rid of the Russian troops promptly without waging
nuclear war.
What is this prompter way to make the Russians go away
from Cuba? They do not tell us, but the most reasonable inter
pretation of what they say is that the prompter way is not to
make war, but to threaten war. Both Governor Rockefeller and
Mr. Nixon have avoided saying plainly what they do mean. But if
what they sound like has genuine meaning, it is that they be
lieve the United States can deliver an ultimatum which the
Soviet Union will bow to.
The Rockefeller-Nixon position appears then to be that
( üba can be liberated by ordering the Soviet Union to withdraw
from this hemisphere and to stand by passively while we block
ade Castro and arrange for a replacement of Castro’s govern
ment. If this is what they have in mind, they are making an
enormous guess. For nobody can possibly know that the Soviet
Union would surrender its whole position in Cuba as it sur
rendered its offensive weapons last October. It is the supreme
folly in the nuclear age to drive a nuclear power into a corner.
And if the Soviet Union refused to bow to the ultimatum, all
this would do for us would be to make us look like fools.
The President of the United States cannot play with an ulti
matum to a government like that of the Soviet Union. He cannot
use an ultimatum unless he is prepared to go through with it
and begin a war. If he is not prepared to go to war, an ultima
tum is a bluff, and everyone will soon see that it is.
While the present policy does not promise a quick with
drawal of the Russians or the fall of Castro, it is surely not
true to say that it is complacent, do-nothingism. To a degree
which is just short of war, Cuba is being photographed, pa
trolled, embargoed, squeezed and isolated. If Cuba were a great
power, we would be at war with her for what we are already
doing. I doubt whether there is any precedent where we have
exerted such strong measures short of war on any other country.
However much we are impatient and frustrated, we have to
grasp the fact that Cuba is no military threat to the United
States and is not very much of a threat to Latin America. The
worst of Castro is his example, and a long way after that such
agents as he is able to train and infiltrate into the Latin-Ameri
can countries. He is an affront to our pride, he is a nuisance, he
is a mischief maker. But he is not a mortal threat to the vital
interests of the United States, and therefore, in this age of
thermonuclear war, w'e must deal with him by measures that are
short of war.

Cuba got a good airing last week before the American Soci
ety of Newspaper Editors, and the significant fact about the
speeches of the President, Secretary Rusk and Senator Keating
was that there is substantial agreement about what the United
States should and should not do. It is hard to say what Mr.
Nixon’s Cuban policy would be. He sounded like a man who was
ready to go to war. But all he actually said what that he wanted
the Cuban exiles to make hit-and-run raids.
Senator Keating, who is the most conspicuous of the criti
cal opposition, began by saying that “it is foolish to pretend
that there are easy answers to the Cuban problem.” He did not
pretend. Then, in the course of his speech, he admitted that he
agrees with the main theses of our present Cuban policy. He is
opposed to an invasion. He is opposed to a blockade. He is op
posed to hit-and-run raids mounted from American soil. He is
in favor of “greater stress on non-military measures,” and he
wants to exert increasing economic pressure so that the Soviets
“will be driven to the conclusion that the price of maintaining, a

what they sound like has genuine meaning, it is that they be
lieve the United States can deliver an ultimatum which the
Soviet Union will bow to.
The Rockefeller-Nixon position appears then to be that
( üba can be liberated by ordering the Soviet Union to withdraw
from this hemisphere and to stand by passively while we block
ade Castro and arrange for a replacement of Castro’s govern
ment. If this is what they have in mind, they are making an
enormous guess. For nobody can possibly know that the Soviet
Union would surrender its whole position in Cuba as it sur
rendered its offensive weapons last October. It is the supreme
folly in the nuclear age to drive a nuclear power into a corner.
And if the Soviet Union refused to bow to the ultimatum, all
this would do for us would be to make us look like fools.
The President of the United States cannot play with an ulti
matum to a government like that of the Soviet Union. He cannot
use an ultimatum unless he is prepared to go through with it
and begin a war. If he is not prepared to go to war, an ultima
tum is a bluff, and everyone will soon see that it is.
While the present policy does not promise a quick with
drawal of the Russians or the fall of Castro, it is surely not
true to say that it is complacent, do-nothingism. To a degree
which is just short of war, Cuba is being photographed, pa
trolled, embargoed, squeezed and isolated. If Cuba were a great
power, we would be at war with her for what we are already
doing. I doubt whether there is any precedent where we have
exerted such strong measures short of war on any other country.
However much we are impatient and frustrated, we have to
grasp the fact that Cuba is no military threat to the United
States and is not very much of a threat to Latin America. The
worst of Castro is his example, and a long way after that such
agents as he is able to train and infiltrate into the Latin-Ameri
can countries. He is an affront to our pride, he is a nuisance, he
is a mischief maker. But he is not a mortal threat to the vital
interests of the United States, and therefore, in this age of
thermonuclear war, w'e must deal with him by measures that are
short of war.
