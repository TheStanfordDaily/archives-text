### JIM DONOVAN 
Yesterday the Frosh baseball
team lost its first game of the
season, allowing arch-rival Cal to
come from behind with four runs
in the ninth and win 7-4. The
Frosh are now 5-1.
Ace right-hander Terry Dock
on, who pitched the last three in
nings. was charged with the loss.
In the ninth with men on first
and second and none away, Dock
en was tagged for a run-scoring
double which tied it at four all.
He then issued an intentional
pass, to load the bases and bring
up the pitcher; however he, too,
looked at four balls and the win
ning run was forced it.
The game was marred by er
rors and other miscues. Stanford
committed four bobbles and In
dian pitchers hit another four
batsmen. Thus eight players
reached base when they might
have been retired.
DOCKKN, who was .making
his first appearance since he con
tracted a sore arm three weeks
ago, had pitched near perfect
baseball in the top of the seventh,

■ relieving starter Dick Conway
| with the bases loaded, only
:one out and two runs in and
| striking out the two remaining
men.
In the bottom of the seventh
the Frosh rallied for two runs to
i go ahead 4-3. Docken singled over
[third, second-baseman Nick Lov
i rich doubled deep to left center
off the fence and Lon Raymond
followed with a Texas-league
1 double to left, to close the scor
ing until the unfortunate ninth.
COACH RAY YOUNG praised
i Cal’s pitcher, lefty Jeff Nye (who
[ went all the way for the win) and
bemoaned Stanford's errors. “We
just made too many mistakes to
l win, but we did come back well in
the seventh.”
I On Tuesday the Frosh warmed
up for the Cal game by burying
Menlo College 27-2 in six innings,
j Ron Yett went four frames and
