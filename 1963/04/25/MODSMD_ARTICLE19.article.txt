The Stanford golf team shares
the sports spotlight this week
when they travel to San Jose
State on Friday, and come back
to host the Trojans of Southern
California Saturday afternoon on
the Stanford course.
Last week the Indian club men
secured their eighth straight dual
match victory by understroking
the Golden Bears of California.
But from this season’s perform
ances, it appears that San Jose
State will furnish the most dan
gerous competition, and the Tro
jans figure to finish among the
top two teams in the Big Five
Conference, threatening Stanford
supremacy.
All of San Jose’s Spartans
march behind their mightiest,
John Lotz. Lotz was last year’s
Jr. Amateur Champion of Cali
fornia, and individual champion
at the Pasatiempo Collegiate Golf
Tournament, enough to earn him
a rating as one of the finest
young golfers on the West Coast
—and in the nation.
THE SPARTAN ranks over
whelmed a 31-team field (includ
ing Stanford) at this season’s
tournament at Pasatiempo, while
chipping some eleven strokes off
the course record set last year
by the Indians. Stanford finished
two strokes over the record they
had previously set, and one
stroke behind USC, for third
place. There is a possible line up
change for Stanford this week
end, as number one man, Peter
Choate did not play against Cal,
and it is not known for certain if
he will golf this weekend in
either match.
