# Lacrosse Team Splits First Series
## 
### 
Tho season started auspicious
ly last weekend for a group of
self-organized Stanford lacrosse
players, who journeyed south to
test their skill against the Uni
versity of Arizona in Palm
Springs, and the Oceanside Ma
rine Corps Ist Division. The
Tribe managed a two-game split.

Harvard team captain and All-
American, Stanford jumped off
to a quick 4-1 lead in the first
period against Arizona State.
Three more goals in the final pe
riod capped a fine 10-5 victory.
Walts tallied five goals and as
sisted in three more. Lew van
Amerongan scored two, and
Howie Taylor, George Peters, and
Tony King one each.
The following day, the team
met the Marines, who were last
year’s All-West Open Champions.
Woody Woods, van Amerongen,
Hal Louchheim, and Watts broke
through a strong Marine defense
to score a goal each.
STANFORD trailed only 3-2 at
halftime and kept the same mar
gin until the fourth quarter,
when Carl Ripplemeyer and Ed
Gibbons, former stars for a Navy
team that is perennially the coun
try’s best, led a Marine surge that
carried them to a 7-4 win.
The Indians’ showing was par
ticularly impressive, since Stan
ford is a brand new team, the
first college lacrosse team in Cali
fornia, and the teams it played
were composed of several top
notch players. The day before
they played Stanford, the Marines
had walloped the Southern Cal
All-Stars, 16-6.
But gritty play by the attack
men and particularly by goalie
Toby Hayes (who had been at the
position only two weeks), who
blocked 20 Marine shots, stymied
the Marines until late in the
game.
