# Living Group Debaters To Argue Civil Defense
## 
### 
The Speech Association is spon
soring a debate tournament
among living groups on the ques
tion of civil defense in the United
States. Entries for the second an
nual “Issues of Challenge” con
test, which will take place during
the first week of May, are being
accepted this week.
“ ‘lssues of Challenge’ provides
a chance for every Stanford stu
dent to express himself rationally
on a controversial national is
sue,” according to Speech Associ
ation President Chuck Bischoff.
“The fallout shelter dispute has
been chosen because of the great
interest on campus at the present
time, and because it is so contro
versial.”
Last year, in the first “Issues
of Challenge," El Campo defeated
Lagunita in the final round, sup
porting the abolition of the Un-
American Activities Committee.
The exact topic for this year is:
"Resolved, that the United States
Civil Defense program should be
discontinued.”
Each Stanford living group is
entitled to enter a team of two
speakers. All undergraduates, ex
cept those with more than a year
of inter collegiate forensic experi
ence. are eligible. Independents
may also organize teams. One
speaker will uphold the affirma
tive side of the proposition: the
other will support the negative,
and each will debate representa
tives of other living groups. Each
contestant will keep the same
side throughout the tournament.
Three preliminary rounds,
quarterfinals and semifinals will
be held on Saturday, May 4. The
final round will be during the
following week. Deadline for en
tries is Tuesday, April 30.
