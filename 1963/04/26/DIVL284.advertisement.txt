Whaf’s the most
popular shoe we have
at R/A for active
sports or just striding
the campus? Right,
it : s none other than
the justly-famed
Jack Purcell canvas
sneaker by B. F.
Goodrich. These ksce
to the toe for extra
comfort and come in
the traditional tennis
white, or in non
traditional black,
obviously much
easier to keep clean.
Take your pick,
whichever, but 8.95
the pr. Sneak info R/A
for a set today while
the mood is right.
