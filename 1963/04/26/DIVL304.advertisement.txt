1. My theory on looking for a job
is —Play it big! Shoot for
the top! Go straight to the
prez for your interview.
I don’t know any presidents.
2. Use your head, man. Have your
dad set up appointments with
some of the big shots he knows.
He’s a veterinarian.

3. Beautiful! All you have to do
is find a president who likes
dogs. You'll have him eating
out of your hand in no time.
I don't know an Elkhound
from an Elk.

B A letter to the employment managerl
Ho ho ho! You’ve a lot to learn.
Then how come I landed a
great job at Equitable
an executive training spot
that’s interesting, pays
a good salary and has a lot
of promise for the future.
4. Frankly. I don't know what else to
tell you. You’ve got a problem.
It’s not as bad as it seems.
My idea is to find out the name
of the employment manager
at the company I’m interested
in. Write him a letter telling him
my qualifications. Spell out my
interests, marks. Simple as that.
fi. Pay, could you set something up
for me at Equitable?
I’m not the president,
but I'll try.
