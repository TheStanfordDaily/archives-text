How Ford economy won
for Tiny Lund at Daytona

The Daytona 500 is one of America’s
toughest stock car events. It measures
the toughness, stability, over-all per
formance and economy characteristics
of the cars that take up its challenge
in away that compresses years of driving
punishment into 500 blazing miles. This
year mechanical failures claimed over 50
per cent of the cars that entered. That’s
why Tiny Lund’s victory in a Ford (with
four other Fords right behind him) is a
remarkable testimony to sheer engineer
ing excellence.
Lund attributed his victory in part to
the “missing pit stop.” He made one less
pit stop for fuel than his competition
proving that Ford economy can pay off
in some fairly unlikely situations!
Economy and the winner of the Day
tona 500 might sound like odd bedfellows
at first. Yet economy is basic in every car
we make . . . yes, even the Thunderbird
is an economy car in its own way. Here’s
what we mean . . .
Economy is the measure of service and
satisfaction the customer receives in rela
tion to the price he pays for it. It does
not mean, however, austerity . . . you
have taught us this. Americans want—
and we try hard to give them—cars that
are comfortable to ride in, fun to drive,
and powerful enough to get out of their
own way. Not many Americans want to
settle for basic transportation. You see
this in our sales figures—more than half
of our 1963 sales are coming from the top
of each model line. We’re selling con
vertibles, hardtops, the jazzy cars . . .
the bucket-seat, high-performance, lux
ury editions are going like hot cakes.
Yet for all the fun that people are
demanding in their cars, they still are
very conscious of the element of thrift—
of avoiding unnecessary expense. This is
the kind of economy we build into every
car from the compact Falcon to the lux
urious Thunderbird.
There’s a special economy, for instance,
in Ford’s freedom from service. Every
car and virtually every wagon can travel
36,000 miles before it needs a major
chassis lubrication. Other routine service
has been reduced, too—because these
Fords are simply built better—and of
better materials—than ever before.
In its own elegant way, even the
Thunderbird gives you economy. It will
travel 100,000 miles or 3 years before you
have to lubricate the chassis. Thunder
birds have away of becoming classics—
as a look at their remarkably high resale
value will quickly tell you. This, too, is
economy.
Once, long ago—before the arrival of
the Income Tax—a wealthy lady was
asked to comment on the solid gold
plumbing of her latest villa at Newport.
“So thrifty, my dear,” said the dowager
.. . “it will never, ever rust.”
Economy then, is many things to many
people. Whatever economy means to you,
you're pretty sure to find it in a Ford.
America’s liveliest,
most care-free cars!
