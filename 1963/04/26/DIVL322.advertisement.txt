ALL TO GO!
Chevy’s got four entirely
different kinds of bucket-seat
coupes and convertibles to get
your spring on the road right
now—the Super Sports! With
a choice of extra-cost options
like electric tachometers,
4-speed shifts and high
performance engines, they’re
as all out for sport as you want
to go!
First, the Jet-smooth Impala
Super Sport with your choice
of 7 different engines that range up to
425 hp and include the popular Turbo-Fire
409* with 340 hp for smooth, responsive
driving in city traffic.
Then there’s the Chevy II Nova 400 Super
Sport. Special instrument
cluster, front bucket seats,
full wheel discs, three-speed
shift or floor-mounted Power
glide automatic* and other
sporty features.
Two more cures for spring
fever —the Corvair Monza
Spyder with full instrumenta
tion and a turbo-supercharged
six air-cooled rear engine. And
if you want to pull out the
stops, the Corvette Sting Ray,
winner of the “Car Life’’ 1963 Award for
Engineering Excellence.
If the promise of spring has been getting
to you, we can practically guarantee one
of these will, too! *Optionalat extra cost.
