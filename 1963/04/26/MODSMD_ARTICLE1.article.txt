## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
Legislature last niglit “interpreted that the Fundamental Stan
dard is not violated by peaceful demonstrations by students on
University property.” This interpretation was approved by a vote
of 41-32.
This action followed disclosure of'a series of events relating

♦to the picketing against Univer
sity policy on fallout shelters be
ing conducted outside President
Sterling’s home by a number of
students. According to ASSU
President Armin Rosencranz, the
Judicial Council members were
called to a special meeting
Wednesday evening by the Dean
of' Students, the Dean of Men and
the Dean of Women. The Council
was informed of a new Universi
ty policy which limited vigils to
those which are held in areas
generally accepted as public. The
Council’s opinion on the policy
was solicited. The Council was
asked to indicate with what seri
ousness it would view violations.
SOME LEGISLATURE mem
hers felt that the integrity of the
Judicial Council was being threat
ened by their being called upon
to give prior opinions on a case
before the case had come before
them. Some members felt that it
was certainly the privilege of
the University to consult with the
Judicial Council about a newly
announced University policy.
By a vote of 53-19 the Legisla
ture passed a resolution “deplor
ing in the strongest terms any
prior consultation of this sort be
fore an actual case arises, and
questioning the wisdom and ap
propriateness of prior consulta
tion in any circumstances.”
Immediately following this the
question of interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard was dis
cussed. Some members felt that
the motion deploring prior con
sultation was sufficient. Others
felt that peacefully conducted
picketing carried on by students
on University grounds should not
ho regarded as a violation of the
Fundamental Standard. Still
others felt that the home of Pres
ident Sterling should be exempt
from picketing.
MOST MEMBERS wanted to
get on with the orders of the day.
Noting the loss of $l,OOO on the
Bud and Travis concert. Legisla
ture voted to increase the price
of the flicks, for next Sunday
only, to 40 cents, with the extra
proceeds going to the Con Home.
In other business, Legislature
selected Brad Efron and Tom
1 Cover to serve on the Men’s Coun
cil selection committee. Carol
Stevens and Ann Osborn were
selected to serve on the Women’s
Council selection committee.
A By-LAW, submitted by the
officers of the various class gov
ernments, providing for the dis
solution of all but senior class
governments in favor of a social
committee under the ASSU Vice
j President, was read for the first
time. It will be voted upon next

of 41-32.
This action followed disclosure of'a series of events relating

♦to the picketing against Univer
sity policy on fallout shelters be
ing conducted outside President
Sterling’s home by a number of
students. According to ASSU
President Armin Rosencranz, the
Judicial Council members were
called to a special meeting
Wednesday evening by the Dean
of' Students, the Dean of Men and
the Dean of Women. The Council
was informed of a new Universi
ty policy which limited vigils to
those which are held in areas
generally accepted as public. The
Council’s opinion on the policy
was solicited. The Council was
asked to indicate with what seri
ousness it would view violations.
SOME LEGISLATURE mem
hers felt that the integrity of the
Judicial Council was being threat
ened by their being called upon
to give prior opinions on a case
before the case had come before
them. Some members felt that it
was certainly the privilege of
the University to consult with the
Judicial Council about a newly
announced University policy.
By a vote of 53-19 the Legisla
ture passed a resolution “deplor
ing in the strongest terms any
prior consultation of this sort be
fore an actual case arises, and
questioning the wisdom and ap
propriateness of prior consulta
tion in any circumstances.”
Immediately following this the
question of interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard was dis
cussed. Some members felt that
the motion deploring prior con
sultation was sufficient. Others
felt that peacefully conducted
picketing carried on by students
on University grounds should not
ho regarded as a violation of the
Fundamental Standard. Still
others felt that the home of Pres
ident Sterling should be exempt
from picketing.
MOST MEMBERS wanted to
get on with the orders of the day.
