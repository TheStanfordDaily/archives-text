## The 						Recent Canadian Election 
### RONALD I. McKINNON Assistant Professor of Economics 
The course of Canadian politics culminating on April 17th
with Liberal Party chief Lester Pearson becoming Prime Min
ister in place of Conservative John Diefenbaker undoubtedly
mystifies many Americans. Not since the American invasion of
Canada in 1812 was decisively defeated has anti-Americanism
been such an important political theme.
One of the immediate issues was the role of Canadian
forces in North American continental defense vital to the se
curity of both countries. The American defense department has
found dealing with Canadian officialdom to be extremely frus
trating. Since assuming power in 1957, the Diefenbaker govern
ment has taken literally years to decide what kind of aircraft
and anti aircraft equipment to buy, and then last summer re
fused to accept the nuclear armaments which would make the
admittedly now obsolete equipment partially effective. There
was an announcement last fall from the Kennedy government
that the Diefenbaker government was not living up to its com
mitments and had misrepresented the agreement in the Canadian
Parliament. This provoked a political storm on the part of Die
fenbaker, who charged this was one more example of gross in
terference by the U.S. in Canadian affairs: a political theme he
had used quite successfully since 1957. Diefenbaker’s Minister
of Defense, Mr. Harkness, then resigned, substantially vindicat
ing the American position. Later, three other ministers resigned
and the Conservatives, having lost their absolute majority in
Parliament in the election of spring 1962, lost a vote of confi
dence and had to schedule the election of April Bth, 1963. Diefen
baker campaigned on not accepting nuclear weapons, but the
Liberals won the most seats—l3o to 94. This is not quite enough
for an absolute majority but they can probably get enough sup
port from the minority parties to govern for a while.
The amazing thing about the Canadian election is that the
Conservatives under Diefenbaker won as many as 94 seats. In
addition to the defense problem. Canada has had very heavy
unemployment and the rate now, over 8 per cent, is by far the
highest of the industrial countries. Since 1957 there has been
negligible per capita real income growth in a country with very
high endowment per capita in natural resources- a rather miser
able economice record showing substantial incompetence in deal
ing with technical economic questions. The Diefenbaker gov
ernment has shown hostility to the European Common Market,
particularly in the question of British entry. Throw in the resig
nations of the cabinet ministers and the support given by most
newspapers to the Liberals (even those that normally do not
support them) and one wonders how the Conservatives won 94
seats.
Part of the answer is the successful sale of Canadian wheat
to Red China, benefitting pi’airie wheat farmers; but the per
sonal ability of Diefenbaker to invoke a spirit of nationalism in
the Canadian people seems to be dominant. This spirit of nation
alism and patriotism, euphemistically called “pro-Canadianism”
by Diefenbaker, takes the predictably negative form of anti-
Americanism and hostility towards international cooperation.
Canada has alwasy had great difficulty in preserving its cul
tural and economic independence from its large southern neigh
bor, and Diefenbaker has set himself up as the champion of this
independence. He has talked of “powerful interests” w'ho wish to
"sell out Canadian independence” and has associated these with
the Liberal Party. He sways crowds with impassioned oratory
having strong emotional connotations and litle logic, much in
the style of a prairie evangelist. He has a strong sense of his
own historical destiny as Canadian leader, having a semi-mysti
cal feeling of identification with Canada’s first Prime Minister,
John A, McDonald.
By contrast, Pearson has a dry, professorial speaking
style which is poor for political rallies. He won the Nobel Peace
Prize for his work in the United Nations on the Suez crisis
while being Canadian foreign minister up to 1957. He assembled
a fairly technically competent group of younger people for his
government and has prepared a very active legislative program
for his first sixty days in office.
The Canadian experience illustrates how easily nationalism
can be used to shield technical incompetence on real issues of
economic welfare and also endangering the whole idea of inter
national unity and cooperation. This is particularly true of
Gaullist France where the attempt to recapture "la gloire” of the
past is accompanied by outright hostility to the “Anglo-Saxons,”
together with studied contempt for international cooperation in
the European Common Market and the United Nations. But no
western country is immune from these influences. The move
ment away from the obsolete political organizations known as
the nation state to viable and technically competent interna
tional government like the emerging institutions of the Com
mon Market, requires a great reduction in the political power
of the flag-waving politicians everywhere which, unfortunately,
has very deep psychological roots.
