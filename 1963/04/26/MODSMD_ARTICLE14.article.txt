# PEACE CORPS LETTER
## The 						Peace Corps in Ghana 
### RALPH GILMAN 
(Editors* note: This is (lie last part of a letter by Mr. Gil
man, now a Peace Corps Volunteer working in Ghana.)
At first, the Peace Corps Volunteers (myself included)
wanted to fit into Ghanian society as natives and not tourists.
We wanted to meet the people as old friends and began deep
conversations after five minutes to show we were truly inter
ested in Ghana and its people. I soon realized, of course, that
this wasn't working, that there were some Ghanians I liked
more than others and that I w r as compromising my own per
sonality and background. Like the skin color, the necessity
for (his gradually faded as I began to understand Ghanian life
and was wooed by the light-hearted, easygoing manner of the
average person.
Two weeks after our sojourn at the University of Ghana
came the day for departure to our individual school assignments,
Don Fontaine and I were assigned to Dunkvva-on-Offin. The
Headmaster sent a taxi to carry us in comfort the 200-odd miles,
where we would make a new home for the next two years. This
was the first time I had been off the main roads and onto the
dirt surfaces which wind over (he countryside. We bounced
through jungles that had been cleared underneath and planted
with cocoa trees. (Ghana supplies 40 per cent of the world’s
cocoa.) We streaked through crowded village streets at 50
m.p.h., trusting to the horn and a universal sense of self-preser
vation to avoid manslaughter. The scenery went by so fast that
the glimpses I had of village life seemed to catch (he people in
suspended animation.
Here are a few flash-backs that come to mind: The boy with
arms hanging mutely at his side, just watching us go by. Men
standing amid billowy clouds of wood shavings as they look up
from their work. Children hanging in space as they jump and
scream in excitement. Women in that continuous, immovable
stability of nursing a tiny, clinging life while sealed behind
a tray of oranges or bread being offered for sale. An old man
asleep on a chair tilted against a tree. A small boy carrying
a younger brother astride his hip, his expression depicting
strong family loyalty and responsibility.
Just after sunset we came over the crest of a hill and there
before us was the school, a majestic silhouette agains the dark
African sky, its bright lights twinkling in welcome. We un
packed a can of corned beef (this is almost a staple), sprayed
our beds with insecticide, and stretched out to await the new
day. Don and I were each given a five-room bungalow to live
in, and the next four days were spent scrubbing walls, sweeping
out beetles and lizards, and spraying constantly. At least this is
what I did. Don spent his time, armed with spray gun, trying to
conquer the two-inch cockroaches that infested his place. Hun
dreds could and did crawl out of unbelievably small cracks in
the woodwork. Each night Don would arrive at my house to
spend the night. He finally gave up the battle and moved into the
extra bedroom in what is now “our” bungalow, over the dis
approval of a native teacher who, with typical logic, just couldn’t
understand how we would entertain our female guests.
It was expected of us to hire a steward. So now we have
Robert, an eighteen-year-old Ghanian boy, whose light-hearted
manner and “unmastery” of the English language is a continual
source of amusement. His big ambition is to be like an American
cowboy. At one time I had him convinced that everyone in
America wears six-shooters. We were introduced to the students
and then began the trials of teaching in a boarding, secondary
school. But that is another story and will wait until the next
letter.

(Editors* note: This is (lie last part of a letter by Mr. Gil
man, now a Peace Corps Volunteer working in Ghana.)
At first, the Peace Corps Volunteers (myself included)
wanted to fit into Ghanian society as natives and not tourists.
We wanted to meet the people as old friends and began deep
conversations after five minutes to show we were truly inter
ested in Ghana and its people. I soon realized, of course, that
this wasn't working, that there were some Ghanians I liked
more than others and that I w r as compromising my own per
sonality and background. Like the skin color, the necessity
for (his gradually faded as I began to understand Ghanian life
and was wooed by the light-hearted, easygoing manner of the
average person.
Two weeks after our sojourn at the University of Ghana
came the day for departure to our individual school assignments,
Don Fontaine and I were assigned to Dunkvva-on-Offin. The
Headmaster sent a taxi to carry us in comfort the 200-odd miles,
where we would make a new home for the next two years. This
was the first time I had been off the main roads and onto the
dirt surfaces which wind over (he countryside. We bounced
through jungles that had been cleared underneath and planted
with cocoa trees. (Ghana supplies 40 per cent of the world’s
cocoa.) We streaked through crowded village streets at 50
m.p.h., trusting to the horn and a universal sense of self-preser
vation to avoid manslaughter. The scenery went by so fast that
the glimpses I had of village life seemed to catch (he people in
suspended animation.
Here are a few flash-backs that come to mind: The boy with
arms hanging mutely at his side, just watching us go by. Men
standing amid billowy clouds of wood shavings as they look up
from their work. Children hanging in space as they jump and
scream in excitement. Women in that continuous, immovable
stability of nursing a tiny, clinging life while sealed behind
a tray of oranges or bread being offered for sale. An old man
asleep on a chair tilted against a tree. A small boy carrying
a younger brother astride his hip, his expression depicting
strong family loyalty and responsibility.
Just after sunset we came over the crest of a hill and there
before us was the school, a majestic silhouette agains the dark
African sky, its bright lights twinkling in welcome. We un
packed a can of corned beef (this is almost a staple), sprayed
our beds with insecticide, and stretched out to await the new
day. Don and I were each given a five-room bungalow to live
in, and the next four days were spent scrubbing walls, sweeping
out beetles and lizards, and spraying constantly. At least this is
what I did. Don spent his time, armed with spray gun, trying to
conquer the two-inch cockroaches that infested his place. Hun
dreds could and did crawl out of unbelievably small cracks in
the woodwork. Each night Don would arrive at my house to
spend the night. He finally gave up the battle and moved into the
extra bedroom in what is now “our” bungalow, over the dis
approval of a native teacher who, with typical logic, just couldn’t
understand how we would entertain our female guests.
It was expected of us to hire a steward. So now we have
Robert, an eighteen-year-old Ghanian boy, whose light-hearted
manner and “unmastery” of the English language is a continual
source of amusement. His big ambition is to be like an American
cowboy. At one time I had him convinced that everyone in
America wears six-shooters. We were introduced to the students
and then began the trials of teaching in a boarding, secondary
school. But that is another story and will wait until the next
letter.
