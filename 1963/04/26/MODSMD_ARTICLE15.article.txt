Editors, The Daily;
At noon today the Peace Caucus began a twenty-four hour
“vigil” in front of President Sterling’s office; it will continue
in front of his house during the night. The Peace Caucus ex
plained their action in a letter to the President following a con
ference with him. “We feel the strongest way to express our
selves to you is to conduct a continuous vigil.” Each side has
publicly made clear its position concerning fallout shelters on
campus. There has been open public debate on the subject. And
there has been the above-mentioned conference between mem
bers of the Peace Caucus and President Sterling. There has been
no curtailment of discussion, and it is difficult to see how public
debate with the administration would further clarify the issue.
By staging this vigil the Caucus is harassing the very man
who has made it possible for free and open discussion to be held
by student organizations on campus. “Weissbluth stressed that
the vigil is not directed at one individual, but is only an effort
to confront the administration . . .” There is nothing imper
sonal in demonstrating in front of a man’s house.
Their primary desire is that their “concern can be brought
to bear on administrative changes.” If a university is to exist
as a permanent institution, the ultimate responsibility for ad
ministrative decisions must rest with a continuing administra
tive body, and not with the students whose views are diverse,
changing, unorganized, and often lacking in foresight. The fact
that certain administrative decisions have moral implications
does not mean that the authority for making such decisions
should be relinquished to the student body.

Editors, The Daily:
The comic opera events of the last few days involving clasp
government would be mildly humorous if it were not for the
fact that the same situation has taken place before—notably
three years ago.
At that time the Freshman class officers said in effect that
they had done nothing and there was nothing to be done. It was
as unfortunate an attitude then as it is now.
I do not believe, however, that the answer to the problem is
the one supplied by the editorial in Tuesday’s Daily. To put class
organizations under the supervision of the ASSU Vice-President
would only confuse the issue further and would strictly limit the
classes to social events. Although important, it is my belief
that there is much more to class government than merely a
concern for dances and social activities—or at least there should
be more to it than that.
In many respects the University is very conservative, per
haps too conservative. The student is in the position of the cus
tomer who buys a service. When we go to an accountant we do
not tell him how to run his business. But I believe that helpful
suggestions should be offered and accepted in good faith for the
improvement of that service. Through a positive approach class
government can effectively accomplish or at least strongly con
tribute to a better awareness and understanding of what is
taking place and can better define the role of the student in the
university.
A major problem created by the dissolution of class gov
ernment is that of class cards. Part of the Freshman ex-com’s
motion was to refund most of the money collected and to do
away with class cards netirely. Yet the absence of these cards
would entirely wipe out any chance for activities in the senior
year. In this respect the officres have out-foxed themselves and
have hurt future classes by eliminating the only means of
raising money for class affairs—particularly those in the senior
year.
What is needed is a redefining of the purpose of class gov
overnment, or at least a fulfilling of the purposes already out
lined in the ASSU Bylaws. With this should go a critical look
at a possible reorganization of it’s structure.
At present LASSU acts as a containing body for the numer
ous specialized groups and sub-interest groups which we have
on this campus. But LASSU has a totally impossible and un
wieldy membership of 120 students and bogs down everytime a
decision has to be made. I am confident that this will be im
proved eventually, but until then I feel that our best bet is
class government.
It appears in a final view that the question of class govern
ment, yea or nay, is dependent upon interest. The problem is
whether there is enough interest (or confidence) in class govern
ment to have it continue. A lack of enthusiasm, of course, does
not necessarily mean that something is not worthwhile, but
perhaps the recent action taken by the Freshman ex-com will
challenge students who are interested enough to do something
about the situation—students who are willing to at least try
and to give it their support. I sincerely hope that this will
happen.

Editors, The Daily:
The comic opera events of the last few days involving clasp
government would be mildly humorous if it were not for the
fact that the same situation has taken place before—notably
three years ago.
At that time the Freshman class officers said in effect that
they had done nothing and there was nothing to be done. It was
as unfortunate an attitude then as it is now.
I do not believe, however, that the answer to the problem is
the one supplied by the editorial in Tuesday’s Daily. To put class
organizations under the supervision of the ASSU Vice-President
would only confuse the issue further and would strictly limit the
classes to social events. Although important, it is my belief
that there is much more to class government than merely a
concern for dances and social activities—or at least there should
be more to it than that.
In many respects the University is very conservative, per
haps too conservative. The student is in the position of the cus
tomer who buys a service. When we go to an accountant we do
not tell him how to run his business. But I believe that helpful
suggestions should be offered and accepted in good faith for the
improvement of that service. Through a positive approach class
government can effectively accomplish or at least strongly con
tribute to a better awareness and understanding of what is
taking place and can better define the role of the student in the
university.
A major problem created by the dissolution of class gov
ernment is that of class cards. Part of the Freshman ex-com’s
motion was to refund most of the money collected and to do
away with class cards netirely. Yet the absence of these cards
would entirely wipe out any chance for activities in the senior
year. In this respect the officres have out-foxed themselves and
have hurt future classes by eliminating the only means of
raising money for class affairs—particularly those in the senior
year.
What is needed is a redefining of the purpose of class gov
overnment, or at least a fulfilling of the purposes already out
lined in the ASSU Bylaws. With this should go a critical look
at a possible reorganization of it’s structure.
At present LASSU acts as a containing body for the numer
ous specialized groups and sub-interest groups which we have
on this campus. But LASSU has a totally impossible and un
wieldy membership of 120 students and bogs down everytime a
decision has to be made. I am confident that this will be im
proved eventually, but until then I feel that our best bet is
class government.
It appears in a final view that the question of class govern
ment, yea or nay, is dependent upon interest. The problem is
whether there is enough interest (or confidence) in class govern
ment to have it continue. A lack of enthusiasm, of course, does
not necessarily mean that something is not worthwhile, but
perhaps the recent action taken by the Freshman ex-com will
challenge students who are interested enough to do something
about the situation—students who are willing to at least try
and to give it their support. I sincerely hope that this will
happen.

At noon today the Peace Caucus began a twenty-four hour
“vigil” in front of President Sterling’s office; it will continue
in front of his house during the night. The Peace Caucus ex
plained their action in a letter to the President following a con
ference with him. “We feel the strongest way to express our
selves to you is to conduct a continuous vigil.” Each side has
publicly made clear its position concerning fallout shelters on
campus. There has been open public debate on the subject. And
there has been the above-mentioned conference between mem
bers of the Peace Caucus and President Sterling. There has been
no curtailment of discussion, and it is difficult to see how public
debate with the administration would further clarify the issue.
By staging this vigil the Caucus is harassing the very man
who has made it possible for free and open discussion to be held
by student organizations on campus. “Weissbluth stressed that
the vigil is not directed at one individual, but is only an effort

three years ago.
At that time the Freshman class officers said in effect that
they had done nothing and there was nothing to be done. It was
as unfortunate an attitude then as it is now.
I do not believe, however, that the answer to the problem is
the one supplied by the editorial in Tuesday’s Daily. To put class
organizations under the supervision of the ASSU Vice-President
would only confuse the issue further and would strictly limit the
classes to social events. Although important, it is my belief
that there is much more to class government than merely a
concern for dances and social activities—or at least there should
be more to it than that.
In many respects the University is very conservative, per
haps too conservative. The student is in the position of the cus
tomer who buys a service. When we go to an accountant we do
not tell him how to run his business. But I believe that helpful
suggestions should be offered and accepted in good faith for the
improvement of that service. Through a positive approach class
government can effectively accomplish or at least strongly con
tribute to a better awareness and understanding of what is
taking place and can better define the role of the student in the
university.
A major problem created by the dissolution of class gov
ernment is that of class cards. Part of the Freshman ex-com’s
motion was to refund most of the money collected and to do
away with class cards netirely. Yet the absence of these cards
would entirely wipe out any chance for activities in the senior
year. In this respect the officres have out-foxed themselves and
have hurt future classes by eliminating the only means of
raising money for class affairs—particularly those in the senior
year.
What is needed is a redefining of the purpose of class gov
overnment, or at least a fulfilling of the purposes already out
lined in the ASSU Bylaws. With this should go a critical look
at a possible reorganization of it’s structure.
At present LASSU acts as a containing body for the numer
ous specialized groups and sub-interest groups which we have
on this campus. But LASSU has a totally impossible and un
wieldy membership of 120 students and bogs down everytime a
decision has to be made. I am confident that this will be im
proved eventually, but until then I feel that our best bet is
class government.
It appears in a final view that the question of class govern
ment, yea or nay, is dependent upon interest. The problem is
whether there is enough interest (or confidence) in class govern
ment to have it continue. A lack of enthusiasm, of course, does
not necessarily mean that something is not worthwhile, but
perhaps the recent action taken by the Freshman ex-com will
challenge students who are interested enough to do something
about the situation—students who are willing to at least try
and to give it their support. I sincerely hope that this will
happen.
