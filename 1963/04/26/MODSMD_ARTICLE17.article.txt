## Judicial Council Adopts New Method of Selection 
### WILLIAM SMILAND Chairman, Men’s Council 
The recently approved ASSU
Constitution provides for a chal
lenging new method of selecting
members of Men’s and Women’s
Councils. Men’s Council will be
chosen by a board consisting of
two members of the current
Men’s Council, two elected mem
bers of LASSU, and the President
and the ASSU, while Women's
Council will be chosen by two
members of Women’s Council,
two members of LASSU, and the
President of AWS.
There has been some degiee of
speculation about the benefits of
this change from the old electoral
system. Some students wonder if
this method of selection, based on
indirect representation, rather
than on the direct “will” of the
student body, will not cause a loss
of contact with student opinion
by creating a self-perpetuating
cycle.

SUCH A RESULT, while con
ceivable, is made highly unlikely
by the strengths of the new sys
tem. Qualified judicial candidates
will be freed from the exacting
and inappropriate rigors of a
campus-wide campaign. At the
same time the student body may
expect its representatives on the
board of selection to try consci
entiously to choose the most ca
pable people for the job.
By providing this new method
of selection of members of the
Judicial Council, the now Consti
tution focuses attention on the
possibilities for change and im
provement in the Stanford judi
cial system. However, the success
of the new method must ultimate
ly depend on the quality of those
who seek to fill positions which
are open for next year. In select
ing by interview, the committee
hopes to appoint people of integ
rity who are deeply aware and
critically concerned with the role
of Judicial Council in setting the
tone of the campus and in dealing
with the Administration.
THIS RAISES the question of
just what makes a student judi
cial officer effective. Perfect jus
tice is an elusive target that can
not always be hit. But it must
ever be held directly in one’s
sights. The most capable marks
man with a steadfast hand will
come closest to the mark. We
would hope that our fellow stu
dent who sits in judgment in Fun
damental Standard and Honor
Code cases would be our best
marksman.
