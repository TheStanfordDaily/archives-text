# IIR Committee Tries To Ease Adjustment Of Foreign Students
## 
### JIM CLAUSE 
Stanford's 650 international
students represent a human and
monetary investment in world
oeace; more importantly, they
■epresent the opportunity for us
to really know other people, to
find for ourselves that common
denominator of humanity which
is, in the end, our only means to
a better world. Both investment
and opportunity are lost when,
with Stanford’s American stu
dents among the best-travelled in
the world, the foreign student
community on campus is un
known and ignored.
What of the foreign students
themselves? They come to the
United States not to study
physics of engineering as much as
to learn of America and Ameri
cans. Interpreting our silence as
indifference, many withdraw to
books and leave Stanford at the
end of a year with memories of
loneliness, having made Ameri
can acquaintances, but not a
single American friend.
The Institute of International
Relations Foreign Student Pre-
Reg Committee, to be headed next
year by Doug Moir, was formed
to help the foreign student make
the major adjustments to Ameri
can life, to encourage him to en
ter actively Stanford campus life,
and most importantly, to offer
him the beginnings of American
friendship for which he came.
The activities of the commit
tee are fully financed by the in
genuity and imagination of th e
Committee members themselves.
Two quarters of activity credit
are offered to participants; sign
up sheets are posted in the HR
Loft for try-outs Friday and
Monday, 4-6 p.m.
