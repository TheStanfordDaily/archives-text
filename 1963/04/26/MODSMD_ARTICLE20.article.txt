# IIR Organizes New Middle East Desk
## 
### 
An organizational meeting will
be held Friday afternoon in room
271 of Tresidder at 4 for all stu
dents graduate or undergradu
ate, foreign or American inter
ested in working on the newly
formed Middle Eastern Desk of
the HR Prof. Christina Harris,
an authority on the Middle East
who is conducting graduate sem
inars here at Stanford, will serve

as the gr oup’s advisor. The Desk
Chairman will he Flashy Khosro
vani, an Iranian student who
studied in Switzerland and Eng
land before coming to Stanford
this year.

It is imperative that desk proj
ects bo planned before this quar
ter is over, or funds will not be

available for - the completion of
its programs. Presently planned
are panel discussions, speeches on
various aspects of the Middle
East by authorities, and a Middle
Eastern Week to be held the mid
| die of Winter Quarter, 1963. to
I interest and inform the Stanford
campus on the cultural, religious,
and political aspects of the Mid
dle East.
THE DESK, however, is by no
means a political organization;

its purpose is to serve as an in
formation center for students
traveling to the Middle East, for
papers or projects on the Middle
East, as a guide for any Middle
Eastern visitors to campus, and
an educational device whereby
| the campus may become bettor
I informed about a vital and oft
forgotten section of the globe.
The Desk includes in its sphere
! Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Libya,
| Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Jordan,
j Syria, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Is
rael, Iraq, Yemen, Turkey, Iran,
j Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Ku
wait. While not all of these coun
! tries are geographically located
j in the Middle East, they are re
| lated by religion and culture;
I and, the primary purpose for
forming the Middle Eastern Desk
j being to interest and educate the
j Stanford Campus, it was felt that
ito limit the Desk’s interests
' strictly to the geographical Mid
j die East would be to nullify its
I stated objectives.
