# Stanford Fights Trojans Broncos, Weatherman in CIBA
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
If the weatherman, a very hos
tile figure in the last few weeks,
doesn’t interfere again, Stan
ford's varsity baseballers will
play three league games in two
days this weekend. The outcome
could well decide the Tribe’s
championship chances.
FRIDAY the Indians are slated
to travel to Santa Clara to play
their third game with the Bron
cos. Stanford lost to Santa Clara
Tuesday, 4-3. after taking the
first game in the series earlier in
the season. 2-0. Then Saturday
the Indians tackle Southern Cali
fornia in a doubleheader. Game
time for the opener is 1 p.m. at
the Sunken Diamond.
Going into action this weekend,
Stanford is a scant one game be
hind league-leading UCLA. Stan
ford put itself into contention last
week by sweeping a double-head
er from the Bruins.
Coach Fehring plans to start
right-hander Jim Lonborg against
Santa Clara Friday. Lonborg has
a so-so five and four won-lost
record, but this is not a true in
dication of his ability. His earned
run average is an excellent 1.5.
IN THE double-header Satur
day the Tribe will go with the ace
of the staff, Darrell Sutherland,
who has given up only two
earned runs all season, and War
ren Newell, the losing pitcher in

Tuesday’s 4-3 decision.
Stanford dropped its first two
CIBA games to USC in Los An
geles by narrow 2-1 and 1-0 mar
gins. Sutherland and Lonborg
were the losing pitchers then, al
though they allowed only a single
earned run. With the yawning
vastness of Sunken Diamond to
support the pitchers tomorrow,
and an increase in the weak Stan
ford hitting, this time they should
fare better.
THE TROJANS may be tired
by the time Stanford plays them.
Their grueling weekend schedule
includes double-headers on Fri
day, Saturday, and Monday.

I The standings:
W L GBL
UCLA 7 5
USC 2 2 1
Stanford 3 3 1
Santa Clara .... 4 4 1

Bailey and Orlando Cepeda each
homered yesterday while driving

sparked the San Francisco Giants
j to an 8-4 victory over the St.
Loins Cardinals and deadlocked
the two teams for first place in
1 the National League.

WHILE the Indians will feature pitching this weekend against Santa
Clara and USC, what little power there is will most likely be sup
plied by Bob Hollman (shown here against UCLA). The first base
man leads Stanford sluggers with three home runs.
