# 10 Indians in Drake Relays
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Stanford gets a chance to
broaden the horizons of its track
fame this weekend when a 10-
man contingent from the team
competes in the Drake Relays.
So far, Stanford's perform
ances, though impressive, have
been restricted entirely to the
West Coast. This should not de
tract from the Indians’ accom
plishments, however, since the
best two dual meet teams in the

U.S., USC and Oregon, lead a
group of schools that make the
West probably the strongest
track region in the country for
1963.
While Stanford has achieved
some status nationally through
its impressive, though one-point
losing performances against the
Trojans and the Ducks, it is
bound to receive even more at
tention tomorrow when all col
lege track interest will be con
centrated on a trio of traditional
ly excellent relay meets: Penn
Relays in Philadelphia, Mt. Sac
Relays in Walnut, California, and
Drake Relays in Des Moines.
STANFORD has not gone to
the Drake meet since 1959, when
its outstanding quartet of run
ners. Don Cheserak, Dick Lassen,
Bertil Lundh, and Ernie Cunliffe,
won the distance medley relay
and John Kelly won the triple
jump. Since then it has competed
annually at Mt. Sac.
The Drake Relays, which is
scored on a team basis, is the
showplace for the track teams of
the small midwestern and south
western schools. Such colleges as
Southern Illinois, Abilene Chris
tian, Texas Southern, Western
Michigan, and Houston perennial
ly produce some of the outstand
ing runners in the country, es
pecially in the sprints. This is
the field that Stanford will be
up against.
In response to the invitation
from the meet officials, Coach
Payton Jordan has chosen to take
ten men, who will represent Stan
ford in eight events. Stanford's
outstanding entry in the meet
will be Dave Weill, the best col
lege discus thrower in the coun
try; he set the NCAA record of
194-6 three weeks ago. His major
competition will come from Kan
sas’ A1 Stoner, who set a fresh
man record last year with a toss
of 174-10.
TWO other outstanding Stan
ford runners. Harry McCalla and
Larry Questad. will be competing
in relay races only; Jordan is
holding them from individual
competition partially to save
them for the Big Meet against
Cal next week.
McCalla, a 4:01.5 miler, will
run the mile leg in the distance
medley relay. Running along with

him will be Bob Miltz (440), Bill
Pratt (880), and Harlan Andrews
(1320'). Andrews is replacing
Paul Schicke. who is still suf
fering from a foot injury. The
meet favorite is the team from
Southern Illinois, which includes
Russian-American Meet stars,
Jim Dupre (440) and Ray Sad
dler (880).
MILTZ, Pratt, Andrews, and
McCalla will all come hack to
run in the four-mile relay, an
event which Stanford has not yet
competed in this year. The three
best college teams in this event
will be on hand; they are Nebras
ka (17:10.3), Houston (17:11.0),

and Abilene Christian (17:18.5).
Questad, a 9.5 sprinter, will
lead a quartet, which also in
cludes Boh Mclntyre, Eric
Frische, and Len Breschini, in the
440 and 880 relays. They will
compete against Texas Southern,
the best in the country in both
events, with times of 40.7 and
1:25.0. Stanford’s best times are
31.2 and 1:35.9 respectively.
Stanford’s final entry is Steve
Cortright, 14.2 and 37.0, the
hurdler and 47-6’l' triple jumper.
He will have a chance to upset
freshman John Roderick, a 14.0
hurdler, who ran a 13.8 in high
school.

Highlights of tomorrow’s
Drake Relay Meet, in which
Stanford is competing, will
In* televised delayed by ABC
TV from 5 to 6:30 on Chan
