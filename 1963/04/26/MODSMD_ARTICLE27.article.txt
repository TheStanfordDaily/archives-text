# Frosh, Varsity In Tune-up for Cal Meet
## 
### JUSTIN BECK 
The frosh track squad faces the
varsity reserves in a meet this
afternoon at 4 p.m. on Angel
Field, weather permitting. Los
Angeles Slate is also scheduled
to participate. However, they are

only sending a two-man squad
and so do not figure to take a
predominate part in the meet.
The varsity reserves will con
sist of the entire varsity squad
except for the ten men entered
in the Drake Relays this week

end. L.A. State will be represent
ed by only a broad jumper and a
miler.
PROBABLY (he field events
will be the best of the day. The
frosh have looked strongest in
t hose events and only Steve Corl
right and Dave Weill are missing
from the varsity in that area.
In the 100- and 220-yard dashes,
the frosh could win, particularly
if Phil Lamoreaux, still recover
ing from injuries, decides not to
run. Frosh miler Dave Duehner
should also pick up firsts in the
mile and two-mile on the basis of
his bests of 4:16.1 and 9:18.1.
SOME of the lop duels in the
field events should be in the high
jump, triple jump, and broad
jump. The frosh have two jump
ers, Sam Kipp and John Goode,
who have cleared 6-3 earlier in
the year, right behind Clayton
Raaka’s 6-514. Goode also has a
triple jump of 46-1, a frosh rec
ord, and a broad jump of 23-10'
The varsity’s Sheridan Downey
has a top mark of 47-7 Vz in the
triple jump, and Dan Moore has
a 23-11 broad jump this year.
