# Bowles Compares Education Systems
## 
### CHRIS CHRISMAN 
The American and Russian
school systems tending toward
universal education are almost
unique in the world whore the
traditional European view of
aristocratic higher education pre
vails, said Frank H. Bowles in
his talk yesterday comparing
the American educational system
with others in use.
Bowles, recently having com
pleted a world-wide study for
UNESCO soon to be published in
a book titled “Access to Higher
Education,” feels the critical im
portance of education has recent
ly been felt everywhere. Under
devloped countries cannot attain
economic well-being without it.
Imaginative and costly develop
ment programs sponsored by the
well-to-do nations (such as Alli
ance for Progress) are failing be
cause of a lack of local trained
manpower.
The European system of edu
cation was characterized by
Bowles as being “polarized along
a line between low and medicine,”
and limited to a small group of
elites. While some “democratiza
tion” has taken place to make
higher education less restricted
by social class, European educa
tors are alarmed by the prospect
of making higher education uni
versal. Europeans and educators
in other countries cannot con
ceive how' Americans can make
higher education available to so
many without lowering the edu
cational standards.
In America and Russia, on the
other hand, higher education is
evolving toward universality.
While less qualified high school
graduates may be funneled off
into junior colleges in America,
or part-time and correspondence
shcools in Russia, the access to
higher education is not restricted
to a class or small elite. In
Bowles’ opinion, one of the main
differences between the Ameri
can and Russian views of educa
tion has to do with the purpose
of education. Russians feel that
students must develop them
selves for the benefit of the state,
while we stress education for the
benefit of the individual.
Bowles concluding, pointed out
some of the difficulties facing
American higher education.
Many of the subjects which are
now being offered are not recog
nized as “higher education." The
costs of higher education are in
creasing, and more of the burden
is resting on the shoulders of the
individual students, preventing
underprivileged students from
continuing their education. Our
standards may be lowering by ex
tending education (But perhaps
(he existence of junior colleges
allows stale* universities to main
tain oven higher standards.). And
finally Bowles feels that Stan
ford and other colleges are be
coming “way stations” on the
way to graduate schools, and that
this is changing the character of
universities.
