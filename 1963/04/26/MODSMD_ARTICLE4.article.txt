# Dean Clark Affirms Possibility to Live According to Ideals
## 
### MAUREEN STRAIN 
With a quiet but firm challenge
to the idea that “after the college
years, ideals simply don’t fit in
with the needs of society,”
Dwight Clark, Dean of Freshman
Men yesterday offered his “My
Last Lecture Series” audience a
provocative invitation to accept
the freedom of living in terms of
one’s ideals.
Clark began with the example
of three men who have spoken
at Stanford and who, he feels,
seem to have “made a successful
practice of impracticality”: Erich
Fromm, Ira Sandperl, and Paul
Goodman.
These men, he said, have evi
dently not accepted some assump
tions which most of us never
question.
THE FIRST, that the higher
one goes in an organizational
hierarchy, the more power one
has, and the more one is able to
do, is most evidently not true
where there is concern for change
in an individual, such as in a uni
versity.
“We just can't automatically
assume,” Clark said, "that the
most important jobs are always
found at the top. The real work
is done at the bottom, also,” he
said.
“Those who are free to act are
often those without any ‘power’
in the usual sense . . . who are
free to operate on the basis of
what they believe.”
We also usually think, Clark
said, that the most meaningful
jobs to be had are already in ex
istence. On the contrary, he said,
the most needed jobs are those
that are waiting to be identified
as such.
FINALLY, Clark said, certain
assumptions such as the need for
job security, can really be ques
tioned if we realize that “the only
man who has a real choice of the
complete range of possible voca
tions is the man who is com
pletely free of expectations.”
“If we can learn to live happily
at low cost,” he said, “we c an
have an extraordinary amount of
power, because our choice can be
made exclusively on the basis of
where we see a need.”
STRESSING the idea that col
lege is the time for dealing with
the possibility of “being that self
which one truly is ... of living
life on one’s own terms,” Clark
underlined the necessity of fac
ing within oneself the possibili
ties of living “idealistically.”

Once this is done, he said,
“we’re hooked . . . with an exqui
site agony”; the realization that
il is, indeed, possible to “live life
on one’s own terms,” even if only
for a few hours a day.
