# 'Sweet Bird' Sentimental; But Simple, Sound Psychology
## 
### JAMES KERANS Director, “Sweet Bird of Youth 
“Sweet Bird of Youth” is an in
verted Easter play. Its themes
are rebirth after suffering, reju
venation. sacrifice and release,
but they appear in forms so dis
torted that to know them is to
repudiate them.
An ironic Easter is a contradic
tion in terms. The terrors and ex
altations of the believer’s Spring
are not here. Souls are not
damned, they are only lost;
bodies arc not cast off, they are
‘operated upon.’ Even monsters
are ‘pitiful.’
NEEDLESS TO SAY, there are
no deliria; the only virtue (and
its own reward) is ‘facing it’—
cryptic, negligent slang for tell
ing the truth, enduring, end a
little bit more.
Are you tired of all this? So am
I. The ‘diminished modern world,
bereft of stabilizing nobilities and
faith’ is to me a radically senti
mental notion.
I would not go to see in “Sweet
Bird of Youth” another version
of the “tragedy of no tragedy,”
still less a version of the decay or
corruption of the ‘old South.'

Even Williams’ virtuosity as a
writer for actors and designers
seems- in this play, at least—an
inadequate reward.
WHAT THE PLAY does
achieve is a strangely modest ac
tion: we are persuaded to live
through a typical crisis of our
lives—a regression to ‘unasham
ed youth’ forced by fear of the
brutality (and oven the promise
of success) offered by the world.
Glamorous and delicate though
this play is in certain passages,
it has a good old-fashioned mes
sage: grow up, accept your sins
and your achievements, reduced
though they may be.
Williams will probably never
be the ‘great’ playwright every
one wants him to try to become,
but if we can accept this ethical
simplicity and sound psychology
as his range, we may find it
easier to admire his wonderful
sense of what the theatre can do.
“Sweet Bird of Youth” opens
tonight, 8:30, at Memorial Audi
torium. Besides performances to
night and tomorrow night, there
will also be performnaces the
same time next Thursday, Fri
