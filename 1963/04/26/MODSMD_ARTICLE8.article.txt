# Shelter Controversy Leads to Student Vigil
## 
### BERT CARP 
I lie peaceful atmosphere of the Farm was violently upset last
night by complications surrounding a vigil of President Sterling’s
borne kept by students protesting the erection of fallout shelters
on the campus and the unwillingness of the Administration to
debate the issue. Controversy centered around the Administration

statement that, “A vigil may be<
held on the campus in the areas
which are generally acceptable to
the public, provided it is con
ducted in an orderly manner, and
does not interfere with classes or
other educational processes and
business of the University.”
Demonstrators, in no way con
nected with the Peace Caucus,
issued the following statement in
reply:
“THE ADMINISTRATION has
announced its policy regarding
vigils by students and student or
ganizations: they have prohibited
us from vigiling in any Universi
ty residential area. We believe we
have a right to vigil and that this
is as basic a right as our freedom
of speech and assembly. The Uni
versity is acting in our behalf
but has issued a regulation which
we feel is unjust. We, as Stanford
students, must announce our feel
ings and must act according to
our consciences.”
Vigilists have not been arrest
ed, but police have taken their
student body cards, and, accord
ing to Dean Winbigler, their case
will be brought before Judicial
Council. Legislature, however,
has issued the decision that the
Fundamental Standard is not vi
olated by peaceful picketing (see
LASSU story). This has led to
conjecture among interested par
ties that Judicial Council may not
be empowered to try the case.
The demonstrators plan to
keep at least two vigilists sta
tioned outside President Ster
ling’s home ‘for as long as neces
sary.” the first two demonstra
tors, Alex Maurize and Kit Ha
vice, both first-year graduate stu
dents, reported that police had
been ‘‘very friendly” but several
Stanford students had been less
so. These gentlemen apparently
threatened to remove them bodily
from in front of the Sterling resi
dence, but were pacified, and end
ed up debating the fallout shelter
question with a second group of
vigilists in front of President
Sterling’s office on Inner Quad.
This second vigil is being kept
under the auspices of Peace Cau
cus. Steve Wassenbluth, leader
of the Quad demonstration, stated
that the vigil is “a direct confron
tation, an example of a non-vio
lent method of bringing about
change.”
CONFUSION and poor com
munications resulted in the ru
mor that two students had been
arrested. Police, however, wore
found amicably discussing the
pros and cons of fallout shelters
with demonstrators. No students
were arrested.
Wilbur Sponsor Bill Shurtlcff
stated that he and Head Sponsor
John Steinbruner would join the
vigilists in support of the right
to vigil.
Vigilists stated that they had
no real hope of abolishing fallout

shelters on the campus, but that
they did hope to bring about a
change in University policy re
garding debate, and introduce the
vigil as a new method of exerting
the influence of student opinion.
A GROUP of freshmen partici
pating in the vigil stated that:
“The question is whether there
should bo communication be
tween the Administration and (he
University community. We had
no say in this matter. We do not
know whether faculty and stu
dents approve of fallout shelters
or not.”
Some vigilists were apprehen
sive about coming before Judicial
Council, and upset by rumors
that Dean Winbigler and Judicial
Council had already “prejudged”
the case. Dean Winbigler, in his
statement over KZSU last night,
said that he met with the Coun
cil in an advisory session, and
that such sessions should be hold
more, not loss, frequently.
The demonstrators had obvi
ously considered their posiiton
carefully, and reached the deci
sion to vigil with full knowledge
of the probable consequences.
They plan to carry on their vigil
as quietly as possible, but they
seem determined to continue un
til their alleged rights ar recog
nized or they are forced to stop.
They will have achieved their
main purpose if they arouse stu
dent interest in their right to ex
press themselves.
