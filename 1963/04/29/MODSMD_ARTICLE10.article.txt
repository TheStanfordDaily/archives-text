# Vigil on Sterling's Home Stopped; Shelter Protest Continues on Quad
## 
### PHIL DEGUERE 
Tlie Peace Caucus vigil which began late last week outside
President Sterling’s office continued over the weekend and is still
in progress this morning. Since Friday a moratorium has been
placed on the evening vigil outside Sterling’s home after Admin
istration threats of dismissal. The Administration responded to

the vigil Thursday evening by<
issuing a statement saying that
such activities wore not permit
ted in private residential areas,
and said that if the vigilers did
not disperse, their student body
cards would be confiscated. Later
that evening the students refused
to leave and their cards were
taken by the Stanford Police De
partment and held at the police
station.
Friday morning the students
returned to the police station,
had their student body cards re
turned to them, and were asked
to return again that afternoon.
At that time they met with Deans
Larimer and Clark and discussed
with them the issues involved.
Kit Havice, a spokesman for the
group, said that they presented
their arguments to Larimer and
Clark and explained their desire
for a debate with a University
representative on the presence of
fallout shelters on the campus,
and that Larimer seemed
“moved” by the arguments.
AT THAT TIME the vigilers re
ceived letters from Dean Win

bigler which stated:
“1. A vigil may be held on the
campus in the areas which are
genexally available to the pub
lic, provided it is conducted in an
orderly manner and does not in
terfere with classes or other edu
caitonal processes and business
of the University.
“2. A vigil may not be con
ducted in the private residential
areas of the campus or in any
manner which represents harass
ment to any person on the cam
pus.
“This is to serve notice that
your actions have boon in viola
tion of this regulation and that
any further violation on your
part will result in your dismissal
from the University.”
Copies of the letter were also
sent to the students’ parents.
After reading the letter the vig
ilers announced verbally a mora
torium of the vigil in front of
Sterling’s home for an uncertain
period, but said that it would be
continued on inner quad.
Saturday afternoon ten vigilers
signed a letter stating that the
vigil at Sterling’s home would bo
started again that night. They
said that they were aware of the
consequences of such an action
and were prepared to face them.
Students signing the letter
were: Kit Havice and Stephen
Morris, both members of the
Steering Committee of the Peace
Caucus, Alex Maurizi, Phil Co
hen, Diana Shugart, Tony Kemer
off, Jane Gilbert, Jan Shafes, In
gred Jacobsen, and Lars Kamp
mann. who signed later at the
police station.
That afternoon, Larimer again
spoke with the vigilers and men
tioned the possibility of a Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow-spon
sored forum on the fallout shel
ter question as a compromise
with the Administration but, ac
cording to Miss Havice, made no
pi’omises.
Yesterday morning the vigilers
again met and at that time drew
up a compromise proposal which
was delivered to Winbigler by
John Fromeyer, head of Stanford
Today and Tomorrow. Miss Ha
vice said it was hoped that Fro
meyer would serve as a liaison
between the vigilers and the ad
ministration.
WINBIGLER issued a state
ment to The Daily yesterday af
ternoon which said that the Ad
ministration would not authorize
any type of debate, but that a
statement would be made explain
ing the Administration’s reasons
for having the shelters on cam
pus. (See accompanying article
by Lyle Nelson, Director of Uni
versity Relations.) Spokesman
for the vigilers said that such a
solution would not be acceptable
to them.
Miss Havice said that she and
the nine other students were sure
1 that the vigil woxdd be resumed
only if there appeared to be no
progress in the matter. She said
I it would probably not begin again
1 before Wednesday since several
statements signed by faculty
1 members concerning the issue
■ may have reached the Adminis
tration by then.
