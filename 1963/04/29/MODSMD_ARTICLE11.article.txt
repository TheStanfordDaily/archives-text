# A 						Compromise Must Be Reached
## 
### 
The conflict over the fallout shelters and the prohibition
of picketing on parts of the campus has turned from a very
small and easily solved question to a near fiasco of misunder
standing. A great number of people have acted in both small
and mistaken ways; their actions have been misinterpreted
and used by a great number of others, who have also acted
foolishly.
Members of the Peace Caucus, last week, asked the Ad
ministration to “discuss” the reasons why the University had
joined a Federal program to provide fallout shelters in cer
tain areas on campus. According to an Administration spokes
man, the University had the impression that the Peace Cau
cus desired an “open debate” with a spokesman of the Uni
versity on the desirability of University policy, in correspond
ence with the University and The Daily, the Peace Caucus
did, in fact, ask for an “open debate.”
However, according to a spokesman of the Stanford Stu
dent Congress, Administration officials have actually refused
to discuss the matter—in any way.
Members of the Peace Caucus, protesting the absence of
an open debate, informed the University that they would
picket President Wallace Sterling’s office by day and his home
by night for an indefinite period.
The night before the start of the “vigil,” Dean of Students
If. Donald Winbigler, and the Dean of Men and Dean of
Women, met with the members of the student judicial coun
cils to discuss what action would be taken if such picketing
did take place. The council members were informed that
picketing in the residential areas would be considered a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard and could be punishable by
separation from the University. The Peace Caucus members
were also informed of this policy.
The “vigil” was begun at noon on Thursday, At the
LASSU meeting that night, the members were informed that
two people had been arrested while picketing in front of tin 4
Sterlings’ residence. This report was later corrected to state
that the students, and others, had simply had their student
body cards taken by the Stanford police. A number of people
went up to the house through the night; a total of sixteen
cards were taken.
At the LASSU meeting, an extremely strong motion was
passed which condemned the action taken by the Deans in
meeting with the judicial councils before an actual case had
arisen. LASSU also passed a motion which interpreted that
peaceful demonstrations in the University area are not viola
tions of the Fundamental Standard.
The Acting Dean of Men informed those whose student
body cards had been taken that any further violation of Uni
versity rules—i.e., further demonstrations in residential areas
—would be adequate grounds for dismissal.
University administrators have agreed to release a state
ment as to their reasons for establishing the fallout shelters;
they June refused to participate in open debate. The Peace
Caucus members have threatened to return to the Sterling
home and its reasonable to assume that a great number of
students and faculty would join them in sympathy of their
right to “vigil.”
.Much of the trouble could have been avoided if more people
had acted wisely at the right time. There can be 4 little doubt
that only the best intentions were intended when the Deans
met with the judicial councils, and the council members did
not feel that they had been prejudiced. It would, however,
have been a much wiser decision to meet with students
other than council members to discuss the problems involved.
At the same time, the motions passed by the Legislature
contained wording that was much too strong for the incident,
particularly considering the motives of the people involved.
There is doubt that any person should be subjected to a
vigil in front of his home. Picketing a private home is an
unwarranted invasion of privacy. However, the picketers were
down the road far from the house itself. Also, such demon
strations are something which a university president should
accept as part of his normal job. It would have shown a
healthier sense of humor had the “vigilers” been asked in for
a cup of coffee or been ignored completely.
Ihe main issue, however, is one of information: are the
members of the campus community entitled to hear the rea
sons for I Diversity policy? The answer can only be that they
are.
Members of the Peace Caucus have stated they would be
satisfied and would discontinue their vigil if a representative
of The University were to give a speech about the Universi
ty s policies and answer questions from the audience. Dean
\\ inbigler has said that there is no possibility of such an
action. He said that the University feels that such an event
would be a “challenge to the University’s authority.”
It is difficult to see how such an event would constitute a
challenge. No one is questioning the right of the University
to make decisions. They are merely asking that the commu
nity be given a chance to hear the reasons and ask questions
about them.
Many people, and the University, could be hurt if a com
promise is not reached. Considering the ease of compromise,
it seems ridiculous to risk such trouble to so many.
It is time for everyone involved to calm down and to con
sider some form of mutual courtesy which has not yet existed
on cither side. It is time for everyone to stop acting like chil
dren at play—or, rather, at war-and attempt to solve the prob
lems involved rather than proving a large number of minute
and insignificant points.

passed which condemned the action taken by the Deans in
meeting with the judicial councils before an actual case had
arisen. LASSU also passed a motion which interpreted that
peaceful demonstrations in the University area are not viola
tions of the Fundamental Standard.
The Acting Dean of Men informed those whose student
body cards had been taken that any further violation of Uni
versity rules—i.e., further demonstrations in residential areas
—would be adequate grounds for dismissal.
University administrators have agreed to release a state
ment as to their reasons for establishing the fallout shelters;
they June refused to participate in open debate. The Peace
Caucus members have threatened to return to the Sterling
home and its reasonable to assume that a great number of
students and faculty would join them in sympathy of their
right to “vigil.”
.Much of the trouble could have been avoided if more people
had acted wisely at the right time. There can be 4 little doubt
that only the best intentions were intended when the Deans
met with the judicial councils, and the council members did
not feel that they had been prejudiced. It would, however,
have been a much wiser decision to meet with students
other than council members to discuss the problems involved.
At the same time, the motions passed by the Legislature
contained wording that was much too strong for the incident,
particularly considering the motives of the people involved.
There is doubt that any person should be subjected to a
vigil in front of his home. Picketing a private home is an
unwarranted invasion of privacy. However, the picketers were
down the road far from the house itself. Also, such demon
strations are something which a university president should
accept as part of his normal job. It would have shown a
healthier sense of humor had the “vigilers” been asked in for
a cup of coffee or been ignored completely.
Ihe main issue, however, is one of information: are the
members of the campus community entitled to hear the rea
sons for I Diversity policy? The answer can only be that they
are.
Members of the Peace Caucus have stated they would be
satisfied and would discontinue their vigil if a representative
of The University were to give a speech about the Universi
ty s policies and answer questions from the audience. Dean
\\ inbigler has said that there is no possibility of such an
action. He said that the University feels that such an event
would be a “challenge to the University’s authority.”
It is difficult to see how such an event would constitute a
challenge. No one is questioning the right of the University
to make decisions. They are merely asking that the commu
nity be given a chance to hear the reasons and ask questions
about them.
Many people, and the University, could be hurt if a com
promise is not reached. Considering the ease of compromise,
it seems ridiculous to risk such trouble to so many.
It is time for everyone involved to calm down and to con
sider some form of mutual courtesy which has not yet existed
on cither side. It is time for everyone to stop acting like chil
dren at play—or, rather, at war-and attempt to solve the prob
lems involved rather than proving a large number of minute
and insignificant points.
The conflict over the fallout shelters and the prohibition
of picketing on parts of the campus has turned from a very
small and easily solved question to a near fiasco of misunder
standing. A great number of people have acted in both small
and mistaken ways; their actions have been misinterpreted
and used by a great number of others, who have also acted
foolishly.
Members of the Peace Caucus, last week, asked the Ad
ministration to “discuss” the reasons why the University had
joined a Federal program to provide fallout shelters in cer
tain areas on campus. According to an Administration spokes
man, the University had the impression that the Peace Cau
cus desired an “open debate” with a spokesman of the Uni
versity on the desirability of University policy, in correspond
ence with the University and The Daily, the Peace Caucus
did, in fact, ask for an “open debate.”
However, according to a spokesman of the Stanford Stu
dent Congress, Administration officials have actually refused
to discuss the matter—in any way.
Members of the Peace Caucus, protesting the absence of
an open debate, informed the University that they would
picket President Wallace Sterling’s office by day and his home
by night for an indefinite period.
The night before the start of the “vigil,” Dean of Students
If. Donald Winbigler, and the Dean of Men and Dean of
Women, met with the members of the student judicial coun
cils to discuss what action would be taken if such picketing
did take place. The council members were informed that
picketing in the residential areas would be considered a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard and could be punishable by
separation from the University. The Peace Caucus members
were also informed of this policy.
The “vigil” was begun at noon on Thursday, At the
LASSU meeting that night, the members were informed that
two people had been arrested while picketing in front of tin 4
Sterlings’ residence. This report was later corrected to state
that the students, and others, had simply had their student
body cards taken by the Stanford police. A number of people
went up to the house through the night; a total of sixteen
cards were taken.

\\ inbigler has said that there is no possibility of such an
action. He said that the University feels that such an event
would be a “challenge to the University’s authority.”
It is difficult to see how such an event would constitute a
challenge. No one is questioning the right of the University
to make decisions. They are merely asking that the commu
nity be given a chance to hear the reasons and ask questions
about them.
Many people, and the University, could be hurt if a com
promise is not reached. Considering the ease of compromise,
it seems ridiculous to risk such trouble to so many.
It is time for everyone involved to calm down and to con
sider some form of mutual courtesy which has not yet existed
on cither side. It is time for everyone to stop acting like chil
dren at play—or, rather, at war-and attempt to solve the prob
lems involved rather than proving a large number of minute
and insignificant points.
The conflict over the fallout shelters and the prohibition
of picketing on parts of the campus has turned from a very
small and easily solved question to a near fiasco of misunder
standing. A great number of people have acted in both small
and mistaken ways; their actions have been misinterpreted
and used by a great number of others, who have also acted
foolishly.
Members of the Peace Caucus, last week, asked the Ad
ministration to “discuss” the reasons why the University had
joined a Federal program to provide fallout shelters in cer
tain areas on campus. According to an Administration spokes
man, the University had the impression that the Peace Cau
cus desired an “open debate” with a spokesman of the Uni
versity on the desirability of University policy, in correspond
ence with the University and The Daily, the Peace Caucus
did, in fact, ask for an “open debate.”
However, according to a spokesman of the Stanford Stu
dent Congress, Administration officials have actually refused
to discuss the matter—in any way.
Members of the Peace Caucus, protesting the absence of
an open debate, informed the University that they would
picket President Wallace Sterling’s office by day and his home
by night for an indefinite period.
The night before the start of the “vigil,” Dean of Students
If. Donald Winbigler, and the Dean of Men and Dean of
Women, met with the members of the student judicial coun
cils to discuss what action would be taken if such picketing
did take place. The council members were informed that
picketing in the residential areas would be considered a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard and could be punishable by
separation from the University. The Peace Caucus members
were also informed of this policy.
The “vigil” was begun at noon on Thursday, At the
LASSU meeting that night, the members were informed that
two people had been arrested while picketing in front of tin 4
Sterlings’ residence. This report was later corrected to state
that the students, and others, had simply had their student
body cards taken by the Stanford police. A number of people
went up to the house through the night; a total of sixteen
cards were taken.
At the LASSU meeting, an extremely strong motion was
passed which condemned the action taken by the Deans in
meeting with the judicial councils before an actual case had
arisen. LASSU also passed a motion which interpreted that
peaceful demonstrations in the University area are not viola
tions of the Fundamental Standard.
The Acting Dean of Men informed those whose student
body cards had been taken that any further violation of Uni
versity rules—i.e., further demonstrations in residential areas
—would be adequate grounds for dismissal.
University administrators have agreed to release a state
ment as to their reasons for establishing the fallout shelters;
they June refused to participate in open debate. The Peace
Caucus members have threatened to return to the Sterling
home and its reasonable to assume that a great number of
students and faculty would join them in sympathy of their
right to “vigil.”
.Much of the trouble could have been avoided if more people
had acted wisely at the right time. There can be 4 little doubt
that only the best intentions were intended when the Deans
met with the judicial councils, and the council members did
not feel that they had been prejudiced. It would, however,
have been a much wiser decision to meet with students
other than council members to discuss the problems involved.
At the same time, the motions passed by the Legislature
contained wording that was much too strong for the incident,
particularly considering the motives of the people involved.
There is doubt that any person should be subjected to a
vigil in front of his home. Picketing a private home is an
unwarranted invasion of privacy. However, the picketers were
down the road far from the house itself. Also, such demon
strations are something which a university president should
accept as part of his normal job. It would have shown a
healthier sense of humor had the “vigilers” been asked in for
a cup of coffee or been ignored completely.
Ihe main issue, however, is one of information: are the
members of the campus community entitled to hear the rea
sons for I Diversity policy? The answer can only be that they
are.
Members of the Peace Caucus have stated they would be
satisfied and would discontinue their vigil if a representative
of The University were to give a speech about the Universi
ty s policies and answer questions from the audience. Dean
\\ inbigler has said that there is no possibility of such an
action. He said that the University feels that such an event
