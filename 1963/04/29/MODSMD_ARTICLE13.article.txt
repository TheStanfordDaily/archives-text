## Vigils and the University 
### MAUREEN STRAIN Associate Editor 
We must certainly he embarrassed as a University over the
events of this past weekend. In a moment of panic at the pros
pect of a handful of peaceful students standing in the rain
overnight up on Mirada Road, we formulated a University
policy, the Policy of Vigils on Private Property.
It is impossible to believe that the President Sterling of
“The Edge of Greatness” would feel anything by sympathy for
the quiet expression of personal conviction, whether such ex
pression took place in front of his office, or in front of his home.
It is equally impossible to believe that a man who has so
often reiterated his primary responsibility for University policy,
adding for emphasis, “If you can’t stand the heat, stay out of
the kitchen,” could construe a demonstration at the top of the
hill as anything more personal than a demonstration of Peace
Marchers at the While House in Washington.
Dr, Sterling could not possibly have taken offense, and we
must therefore presume that the Dean of Students, acting in
good faith, either took offense in the President’s behalf, or per
haps more probably, was sincerely attempting to protect the
person of the President, whom we can safely assume would
have no desire to be so protected.
This is an attempt which we must of course respect. But
look where it has led us. We now have a special vigil policy,
which comes close to, if it does not in fact constitute, a violation
of the freedoms of speech, peaceful assembly, and right to peti
tion for the redress of grievances guaranteed to every American
citizen by our Constitution.
We cannot quarrel with the desire of the University to pro
mote order and respect for the rights of others. We must ques
tion, however, the propriety and justice of promoting this order
and respect at the expense of peaceful expression of opinion.
Such an action as was taken over this weekend will almost
inevitably be construed by the community afi a want, either of
courage, or of a sense of proportion. What could have been ig
nored, or laughed at, has had to be fended off by the formid
able presence of a permanent, inviolable rule, vested with all
the seriousness and pomp of a Fundamental Standard Violation,
and carrying the ultimate penally for infraction—suspension
from the University.
Whatever has happened to the “concept of individual free
dom, tempered by responsibility (which we call) the Funda
mental Standard?”
What sort of personal responsibility and individual freedom
can be maintained in the face of arbitrary rules about what
rioes, or does not, exceed the bounds of propriety? To make a
special rule to fit a special case is a violation of the very prin
ciples upon which the Fundamental Standard is based. “ . . .
rules apply only to limited areas and rely for their proper func
tioning on a broader concept ... of personal honor, based on
the principles of integrity, common sense, and respect for civil
law . . .” So states the exegisis of the Fundamental Standard.
The more rules we have, the more precarious becomes the
concept of a Fundamental Standard, of a “moral community,”
of the “atmosphere of mutual trust,” upon which our system
is supposedly maintained.
We can only hope that the University administration will
reconsider its position.

mental Standard?”
What sort of personal responsibility and individual freedom
can be maintained in the face of arbitrary rules about what
rioes, or does not, exceed the bounds of propriety? To make a
special rule to fit a special case is a violation of the very prin
ciples upon which the Fundamental Standard is based. “ . . .
rules apply only to limited areas and rely for their proper func
tioning on a broader concept ... of personal honor, based on
the principles of integrity, common sense, and respect for civil
law . . .” So states the exegisis of the Fundamental Standard.
The more rules we have, the more precarious becomes the
concept of a Fundamental Standard, of a “moral community,”
of the “atmosphere of mutual trust,” upon which our system
is supposedly maintained.
We can only hope that the University administration will
reconsider its position.
We must certainly he embarrassed as a University over the
events of this past weekend. In a moment of panic at the pros
pect of a handful of peaceful students standing in the rain
overnight up on Mirada Road, we formulated a University
policy, the Policy of Vigils on Private Property.
It is impossible to believe that the President Sterling of
“The Edge of Greatness” would feel anything by sympathy for
the quiet expression of personal conviction, whether such ex
pression took place in front of his office, or in front of his home.
It is equally impossible to believe that a man who has so
often reiterated his primary responsibility for University policy,
adding for emphasis, “If you can’t stand the heat, stay out of
the kitchen,” could construe a demonstration at the top of the
hill as anything more personal than a demonstration of Peace
Marchers at the While House in Washington.
Dr, Sterling could not possibly have taken offense, and we
must therefore presume that the Dean of Students, acting in
good faith, either took offense in the President’s behalf, or per
haps more probably, was sincerely attempting to protect the
person of the President, whom we can safely assume would
have no desire to be so protected.
This is an attempt which we must of course respect. But
look where it has led us. We now have a special vigil policy,
which comes close to, if it does not in fact constitute, a violation
of the freedoms of speech, peaceful assembly, and right to peti
tion for the redress of grievances guaranteed to every American
citizen by our Constitution.
We cannot quarrel with the desire of the University to pro
mote order and respect for the rights of others. We must ques
tion, however, the propriety and justice of promoting this order
and respect at the expense of peaceful expression of opinion.
Such an action as was taken over this weekend will almost
inevitably be construed by the community afi a want, either of
courage, or of a sense of proportion. What could have been ig
nored, or laughed at, has had to be fended off by the formid
able presence of a permanent, inviolable rule, vested with all
the seriousness and pomp of a Fundamental Standard Violation,
and carrying the ultimate penally for infraction—suspension
from the University.
Whatever has happened to the “concept of individual free
dom, tempered by responsibility (which we call) the Funda
mental Standard?”
