Dear Mom and Dad,
As you know, the students have been carrying on a running
feud with the administration all year long. Behind all the feud
ing was an attitude on the part of the administration which the
students simply refused to accept. This was the attitude that
the administration was free to make seemingly arbitrary deci
sions on all sorts of issue which affected the students both
directly and indirectly without even revealing the reasons for
the decision, much less discussing them. Let me emphasize that
the students did not question the administration’s right to make
the decisions. They merely found that, in a university commu
nity which constantly stresses the value of the free and open
exchange of ideas and reasons between governors and governed
in a democracy which respects the rights and opinions of the
lowliest citizen, the administration’s refusal even to reveal the
reasons for its decisions, much less debate them, was both in
comprehensible and frustrating.
There was considerable debate among the students and in
the pages of The Daily. Finally the issue came before the Stan
ford Student Congress. The chairman of the Congress went to
the University Health Physicist and asked him if he would ex
plain to the Congress the facts about the shelters—the sort of
protection they would provide, etc. He said he would be delight
ed to, but first he had to get permission from his superior. The
next day he informed the Chairmen that permission had been
denied. When the Chairman went to inquire why, he was re
ferred to the Vice President for Business. The Business Vice
President told him that the administration had turned down the
request because they feared that the Health Physicist might be
drawn into a discussion of the wisdom of the policy, and this
they were not willing to debate. Thenceforth all members of the
administration categorically refused even to reveal publicly the
reasons which led them to install the shelters.
At this point, if is interesting to take lime out to see what
was going on across the Bay on the Berkeley Campus. Their
administration had also begun installing shelters without any
prior notification. When a similar protest arose among the Ber
keley students, their administration willingly submitted the mat
ter to debate. Furthermore, they permitted students to vote on
it, and when the students voted two-and-a-half to one against
the shelters, the administration agreed to submit the matter to
the Board of Regents.
Meanwhile, back on the Farm, the Peace Caucus went to
President Sterling to protest the administration’s refusal to dis
cuss the issue. When he remained adamant, they withdrew and
wrote a letter to him and The Daily stating their intention of
keeping peaceful two-man vigils, outside his office during the
day and outside his home during the night, twenty-four hours
a day for an indefinite period, as a protest against the admin
istration’s refusal even to discuss the issue.
That night the Deans called an extraordinary session of the
student Judicial Council to inform them that the University had
formulated a new policy prohibiting any form of vigiling or
picketing in residential areas of the campus. They also tried to
obtain some indication of the Council’s opinion of the new
policy and how they would judge people who violated it.
The next night the vigil began and the legislature met. The
legislature passed a resolution deploring the administration’s
attempt to prejudice the judicial body in advance and another
resolution stating that the legislature (who, according to the
constitution, is the final interpreter of the Fundamental Stan
dard) construed that peaceful picketing by students anywhere
on University premises was not a violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
Midway through the legislative meeting (I was present as
an off-campus representative) word came that the police had
taken the Student Body Cards of the two people keeping a vigil
near the President’s house. The offense of which these two stu
dents were guilty was standing by the side of the road in the
rain at the foot of the President’s driveway out of sight of his
house in protest against a policy which they felt violated a basic
principle of any good university—the free and reasonable discus
sion of issues about which honorable men may disagree. Natur
ally the police action caused a furor. About midnight several
other students, many of whom, like myself, were indifferent to
the fall-out shelter issue, began to show up at the foot of the
driveway with the express intent of having their Cards taken.
Through repeated visits, the police collected sixteen Student
Body Cards.
Today administrative machinery went into full gear; com
mittees met, Deans consulted, and the students waited. At four
o’clock we were called before the Acting Dean of Men and
given a letter warning that resumption of the vigil now means
dismissal.
What will happen next, no one knows. We can only hope
everything will work out all right for everyone involved.
