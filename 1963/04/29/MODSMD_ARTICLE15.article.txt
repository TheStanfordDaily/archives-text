# Tribe Beats Santa Clara; Splits Pair With USC
## 
### GLENN ALFORD MARSHALL COOK 
Jim Lonborg stopped Santa
Clara on two hits and batery
mate Chuck French poled a two
run homer for all the scoring he
needed as Stanford beat the Bron
cos 4-1 Friday in Santa Clara.
Lonborg allowed only one
Bronco to get past second base,
and he scored. The 6-6 right-hand
er struck out six and walked only
one in posting his third CIBA tri
umph, as against one setback.
He kept the ball low, so the
Broncs couldn’t loft the ball into
the strong wind and over the
short fences.
FRENCH HIT his homer in the
lop of the second inning to cap
a three-run inning that put the
Cards ahead for good. Dick Kova
cevich had walked with one out,
and he scored on George Thach
er’s double to the fence in the
right-center field.
Bronc right-hander Charlie
Marcenero got the ball a little too
high to French and he lofted it
right down the left-field line and
barely over the fence for a 3-0
Stanford lead. So the Broncs, who
used two fly balls that barely
got over the fence to beat Stan
ford Tuesday, were victimized by
the same weapon Friday.
Satnford got Lonborg an insur
ance run in the sixth inning. Boh
Hollmann scored from second
base on Kovacevich’s single that
Bronc shortstop Gary Malvini
knocked down on the edge of the
outfield grass. Hollmann had
reached first when he forced out
Greg Post, and moved to second
on Gary Smith’s soft single to
center.
LONBORG WAS in trouble
only in the sixth inning. He
hadn’t given up a hit to that
point, and the strain was begin
ning to tell on him. Ht hit Mal
vini and top Bronco slugger John
Bossabella with consecutive
pitches, A strikeout got Lonborg
out of some difficulty, but Ron
Calcagno singled to center for the
only Bronc run.
With the worry about the no
hitter gone, Lonborg struck out
Reno Dißono to end the threat.
Lonborg got good defensive
help from Thacher at second
base and Joel Shulman at short
stop, both of whom made nice
plays early in the game to keep
several Broncos off base.
The win made Stanford’s rec
ord 18-6, put Lonborg’s season
record at 6-4, and left (he Indi
ans half a game behind UCLA’s
7-5 record at 4-3.

The Stanford hitters couldn't
get any runs for their great right
hander Darrell Sutherland, but
they staked Warren Newell to
five first inning runs in the sec
ond game to salvage a split in
Saturday’s doubleheader with SC
at the Sunken Diamond. The first
game went 10 innings before the
Cards submerged 2-1. The Indians
won the abbreviated seven-inning
nightcap by a 6-3 margin.
As usual, Sutherland pitched
well enough to win most games,
while being handed his second de
feat of the season. Sutherland
pitched the fidl 10 innings, giving
up six hits and four walks while
fanning six.
Sutherland gave himself a one
run lead in the second inning.
Dick Kovacevich and George
Thacher walked and the thin
right hander grounded a double
down the left field line, chasing
home Kovacevich.
After Sutherland had set down
the Trojans without a hit
through the first four frames, SC
got the run back in the fifth.
Larry Sandel and Ken Walker
singled, putting runners on first
and second with one out. On an
infield grounder Stanford at
tempted to get a double play to
end the inning, but the relay to
first was late and Sandel came
all the way home.
At the end of the regulation
nine innings the score was still
1-1, and Sutherland must have
felt that he was using the wrong
soap or had done something else
to offend his teammates, for they
still were unable to get any runs
off of SC’s fine righthander Walt
Peterson. Peterson went the dis
tance to get the win, giving up
seven hits but no two in any one
inning.
In the top of the tenth the end
came. With one out Willie Brown,
of Rose Bowl fame, got aboard
on a bunt single. After Brown
had swiped second, the second
theft of the game for the speer
ster, Kenny Washington worked
Sutherland for a walk. Gary Hol
man rammed a single to left, and
the ball game was over.
In the bottom of the tenth Joel
Shulman got a one-out triple, but
Bob Cox and Greg Post were un
able to bring him in.
Stanford came out swinging
against lefty A1 Lasas in the sec
ond game, and before the smoke
had cleared in the bottom of the
first the Tribe had rolled up five
runs, four against Lasas and one
against his successor Pete Hill
man. Shulman and Post walked
and Bob Hollmann singled in the
first run. Moments later catcher
Piscovitch picked the big first
baseman off of first, the only out
that Lasas recorded during his
brief visit. Gary Smith then hit
a chopper to short which Walker
threw away for a two-base error.
Thacher singled to center, driving
in Post. At this point Hillman
came on and walked Cox on four
pitches to load (he bases. He then
wild pitched the third run of the
inning in. Pitcher Newell finished
the scoring with a two-run single.
Newell breezed along with his
rare lead until the fifth inning,

when Ihe roof almost raved in.
Brown singled in a run, and New
: ell barely escaped with his life
when he got Holman to fly to
| deep left with the bases full.
In the next round Newell ran
out of steam. A walk to Fred
Hill and singles to Justin Dede
aux and Lotz drove Newell to the
showers, and brought on Jim
Lonborg, who had just pitched a
nine-inning win against Santa
Clara the day before. Lonborg
gave up another single and a
walk before striking out the side
to end the danger with only two
runs over in the inning.
After Kovacevlch’s perfect sac
rifice bunt had netted Stanford a
sixth run in the bottom of the
sixth, Lonborg went out to tack
down Newell’s first win of the
season. Lonborg was not sharp,
giving up a triple to Holman
which was not costly only be
cause he was out at the plate
trying for an inside the park
home run. However, Lonborg
fanned Gagle to end the game.
The split leaves Stanford with
a five and four record in league
play. They are in a virtual tie
with Santa Clara, a scant one
half a game behind UCLA. If
Sutherland and Lonborg, the two
iron-armed right handers, can get
some runs behind them, Stanford
is in a good position to capture
the title. But no pitcher, no mat
ter how good he is, can win with
out runs.
