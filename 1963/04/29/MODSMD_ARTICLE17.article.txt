# Stanford's Four Firsts Pace Drake Relay Win
## 
### 
Harry McCalla, Dave Weill, and
Steve Cortright led Stanford to
four first places this weekend in
the Drake Relay which provided
a nucleus for a meet victory in
the university division.
Scoring relay events 10-8-6-4-2
and individual events 3-4-3-2-L
Stanford compiled 33 points on
two relay firsts and two individu
al firsts and an individual third.
Southern Illinois University was

second with 31 points. Texas
Southern won the college divi
sion, scoring 43 points on four
relay firsts and an individual
third.
THK MKKT was run under
weather conditions in Dps Moines
which closely approached those
of last week’s USC-Stanford

meet. Thus many of the running
times were not particularly im
pressive.
In Friday’s competition, Stan
ford’s depth in distance runners
completely dominated the four
mile relay with a time of 16:43.4,

| a now Drake Meet record by sev
en seconds. After Harlan An
drews (4:12.21, Hill Pratt (1:13.2),
| and Boh Milt/ (4:13.2) all ran
j creditable legs in the race. Me-
Calla anchored the Stanford en
try with a great 4:04.8 leg. West
ern Michigan was second, 16:47.7.
| This same relay team came
back Saturday in the distance
medley, and this time appeared
destined to lose as Southern Illi
nois led by some forty yards go
\ ing into the final leg, the mile
run. But McCalla made up the
j deficit, against Brian Turner, and
won for Stanford by half a step.
The times were 9:54.4 to 9:54.6.
DAVE WEILL, the NCAA dis
cus record holder, had an easy
jtime of it Friday. A throw of
j 183-2, well below his record of
j 196-4, beat the rest of the field by
j at least fifteen feet.
| Hurdler-triple jumper Cort
| right personally accounted for
Stanford’s other nine points. He
j took a third in the 440 hurdles at
j 32.4, one second off the winning
1 time. It was the first time he had
run that event this year since he
normally competes in the 330 in
termediate hurdles in dual meets,
j The same day, Cortright ran a
\ 14.3 race in the 120 high hurdles.
Although the time equalled his
best previous performance, it
was not good enough to qualify
j for the finals, run Saturday.
] Nevertheless, Cortright did
come through Saturday to win
the triple jump with an effort of
48-6 ’2 . This was his best mark
ever, by over one foot.
STANFORD’S sprinters, led by
Larry Questad, who has run a
9.5 100-yard dash, did not fare so
well. Questad did not finish in
the first five in the 100, which
was won by Roger Sayers of
Omaha in 9.6.
The 880 relay team of Questad,
Len Breshini, Bob Mclntyre, and
Eric Frische, qualified for the
finals but was disqualified dur
ing the race for an illegal baton
pass. The 440 relay team, com
posed of the same men, did not
qualify for the finals.
