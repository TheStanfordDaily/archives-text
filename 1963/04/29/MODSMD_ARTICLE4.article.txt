# Halkett, Angeloff Applauded For Performance in 'Sweet Bird'
## 
### FOSTER HIRSCH 
Tennessee Williams has at his 1
command a whole gallery of per- 1
versions which he distributes lib- 1
erally among his plays. He con
tinues to offer his distorted vision
of the world in such away that
his “Sweet Bird of Youth”
emerges not so much an original
but a copy of a copy.
“Sweet Bird of Youth” recounts !
with unrelenting viciousness the [
history of two frightened people 1
who yearn for their “clean, un
ashamed” youth. Both are fail- (
ures who cannot admit their
defeat, both live in a prison of
illusion.
Chance Wayne seeks recogni
tion in the glare and flash of a
Hollywood career. Alexandra Del
Lago (or, if you will, the Princess
Kosmonopolis) is an aging ac
tress who flees from a disastrous i
comeback with the assistance of j
young men, alcohol, and hashish, j
Both hold on with grasping fin-I
gers to a dream which is fast van
ishing, and both brutally use the j
other to delay the horrible and in-!
evitable moment when they must j
face the reality of their insignifi-1
cance.
j CHANCE AND Alexandra arc |
frighteningly memorable por |
traits, and it is regrettable that j
Williams does not focus his en-1
j tire attention upon them. He has 1
| instead considerably diluted his j
play with a detailed subplot in

volving Chance’s attempts to re- 1
gain Heavenly, the girl from his |
days of youth and innocence. His
efforts are frustrated by Heaven
ly’s dictatorial father, Boss Fin
ley.
Nevertheless, even mediocre
Williams makes exciting theatre.
Indeed, any Williams is a heyday
for an ambitious company, and
; the Stanford Players do quite
j well in their version of “Sweet
! Bird.” The Princess Kosmonopo-
I iis is a luscious role and Nelda
j Halkett obviously relishes every
minute of it. She is at once an
extravagantly evil, insidiously
cunning, and grotesquely pathetic
figure. Mrs. Halkett suggests
with style and a majestic assur
ance the egomania, the bitter
ness, the humor, and the hysteria
of this faded woman.
PHILIP N. ANGELOFF as
j Chance Wayne is much less spec
j tacular, but this is because of the
more conventional and thus more
I difficult nature of the role. Mr,
| Angeloff nevertheless is believ-
I able throughout in a brisk, pro
| fessional sort of way. The scenes
j between him and Mrs. Halkett
are continuously vital.
Like the characters in Sartre’s
j “No Exit,” Chance and Alexan
-1 dra are caught in a hell of their
j own making. Alexandra escapes
! through an improbable phone call
! informing her of the success of
[ her comeback; for Chance, there
| is a final confrontation with the
futility of his quest in the form
of castration. The two actors
j skillfully convey their characters’
changes of fortune. Particularly
vivid is Mrs. Halkett’s telephone
scene in which her mood ranges
[ from fearful self-pity to exultant
| triumph.
| Of the supporting cast, only
j Mark Hammer as Boss Finley
I creates a substantially round
i character. Hammer’s Finley is
loud, gross, arrogant, affected,

I self-aggrandizing, and flagrantly J
hypocritical: an invincible tower
of strength who dominates with ,
1 brute force the lives of all those ‘
I about him. It is only Heavenly
who has the spark of rebellion.
Unfortunately, Christine *
Vaughn as Heavenly is given lit- ■'
tie to do, although she delivers '
her few lines with an unfaltering !
assurance. Claire Christman as '
Aunt Nonnie does not fully rea- (
lize her character’s weaknesses 1
and uncertainty, and William 1
Houck as Tom Junior is nonde- 1
script where he should be a net
work of nerves. Sherril Spencer ■
is unfortunate as Miss Yucy, the
Boss’ money-grabbing mistress.
Herbert Kennedy, who appears 1
briefly as George Scudder,
Chance’s rival for Heavenly, has
mastered an admirable Southern
i accent.

Tennessee Williams has at his 1
command a whole gallery of per- 1
versions which he distributes lib- 1
erally among his plays. He con
tinues to offer his distorted vision
of the world in such away that
his “Sweet Bird of Youth”
emerges not so much an original
but a copy of a copy.
“Sweet Bird of Youth” recounts !
with unrelenting viciousness the [
history of two frightened people 1
who yearn for their “clean, un
ashamed” youth. Both are fail- (
ures who cannot admit their
defeat, both live in a prison of
illusion.
Chance Wayne seeks recogni
tion in the glare and flash of a
Hollywood career. Alexandra Del
Lago (or, if you will, the Princess
Kosmonopolis) is an aging ac
tress who flees from a disastrous i
comeback with the assistance of j
young men, alcohol, and hashish, j
Both hold on with grasping fin-I
gers to a dream which is fast van
ishing, and both brutally use the j
other to delay the horrible and in-!
evitable moment when they must j
face the reality of their insignifi-1
cance.
j CHANCE AND Alexandra arc |
frighteningly memorable por |
traits, and it is regrettable that j
Williams does not focus his en-1
j tire attention upon them. He has 1
| instead considerably diluted his j
play with a detailed subplot in

volving Chance’s attempts to re- 1
gain Heavenly, the girl from his |
days of youth and innocence. His
efforts are frustrated by Heaven
ly’s dictatorial father, Boss Fin
ley.
Nevertheless, even mediocre
Williams makes exciting theatre.
Indeed, any Williams is a heyday
for an ambitious company, and
; the Stanford Players do quite
j well in their version of “Sweet
! Bird.” The Princess Kosmonopo-
I iis is a luscious role and Nelda
j Halkett obviously relishes every
minute of it. She is at once an
extravagantly evil, insidiously
cunning, and grotesquely pathetic
figure. Mrs. Halkett suggests
with style and a majestic assur
ance the egomania, the bitter
ness, the humor, and the hysteria
of this faded woman.
PHILIP N. ANGELOFF as
j Chance Wayne is much less spec
j tacular, but this is because of the
more conventional and thus more
I difficult nature of the role. Mr,
| Angeloff nevertheless is believ-
I able throughout in a brisk, pro
| fessional sort of way. The scenes
j between him and Mrs. Halkett
are continuously vital.
Like the characters in Sartre’s
j “No Exit,” Chance and Alexan
-1 dra are caught in a hell of their
j own making. Alexandra escapes
! through an improbable phone call
! informing her of the success of
[ her comeback; for Chance, there
| is a final confrontation with the
futility of his quest in the form
of castration. The two actors
j skillfully convey their characters’
changes of fortune. Particularly
vivid is Mrs. Halkett’s telephone
scene in which her mood ranges
[ from fearful self-pity to exultant
| triumph.
| Of the supporting cast, only
j Mark Hammer as Boss Finley
I creates a substantially round
i character. Hammer’s Finley is
loud, gross, arrogant, affected,

I self-aggrandizing, and flagrantly J
hypocritical: an invincible tower
of strength who dominates with ,
1 brute force the lives of all those ‘
I about him. It is only Heavenly
who has the spark of rebellion.
Unfortunately, Christine *
Vaughn as Heavenly is given lit- ■'
tie to do, although she delivers '

assurance. Claire Christman as '
Aunt Nonnie does not fully rea- (
lize her character’s weaknesses 1
and uncertainty, and William 1
Houck as Tom Junior is nonde- 1
script where he should be a net
work of nerves. Sherril Spencer ■

Herbert Kennedy, who appears 1

Tennessee Williams has at his 1
command a whole gallery of per- 1
versions which he distributes lib- 1
erally among his plays. He con
tinues to offer his distorted vision
of the world in such away that
his “Sweet Bird of Youth”
emerges not so much an original
but a copy of a copy.
“Sweet Bird of Youth” recounts !
with unrelenting viciousness the [
history of two frightened people 1
who yearn for their “clean, un
ashamed” youth. Both are fail- (
ures who cannot admit their
defeat, both live in a prison of
illusion.
Chance Wayne seeks recogni
tion in the glare and flash of a
Hollywood career. Alexandra Del
Lago (or, if you will, the Princess
Kosmonopolis) is an aging ac
tress who flees from a disastrous i
comeback with the assistance of j
young men, alcohol, and hashish, j
Both hold on with grasping fin-I
gers to a dream which is fast van
ishing, and both brutally use the j
other to delay the horrible and in-!
evitable moment when they must j
face the reality of their insignifi-1
cance.
j CHANCE AND Alexandra arc |
frighteningly memorable por |
traits, and it is regrettable that j
Williams does not focus his en-1
j tire attention upon them. He has 1
| instead considerably diluted his j
play with a detailed subplot in

volving Chance’s attempts to re- 1
gain Heavenly, the girl from his |
days of youth and innocence. His
efforts are frustrated by Heaven
ly’s dictatorial father, Boss Fin
ley.
Nevertheless, even mediocre
Williams makes exciting theatre.
Indeed, any Williams is a heyday
for an ambitious company, and
; the Stanford Players do quite
j well in their version of “Sweet
! Bird.” The Princess Kosmonopo-
I iis is a luscious role and Nelda
j Halkett obviously relishes every
minute of it. She is at once an
extravagantly evil, insidiously
cunning, and grotesquely pathetic
figure. Mrs. Halkett suggests
with style and a majestic assur
ance the egomania, the bitter
ness, the humor, and the hysteria
of this faded woman.
PHILIP N. ANGELOFF as
j Chance Wayne is much less spec
j tacular, but this is because of the
more conventional and thus more
I difficult nature of the role. Mr,
| Angeloff nevertheless is believ-
I able throughout in a brisk, pro
| fessional sort of way. The scenes
j between him and Mrs. Halkett
are continuously vital.
Like the characters in Sartre’s
j “No Exit,” Chance and Alexan
-1 dra are caught in a hell of their
j own making. Alexandra escapes
! through an improbable phone call
! informing her of the success of
[ her comeback; for Chance, there
| is a final confrontation with the
futility of his quest in the form
of castration. The two actors
j skillfully convey their characters’
changes of fortune. Particularly
vivid is Mrs. Halkett’s telephone
scene in which her mood ranges
[ from fearful self-pity to exultant
| triumph.
| Of the supporting cast, only
j Mark Hammer as Boss Finley
I creates a substantially round
i character. Hammer’s Finley is
loud, gross, arrogant, affected,

I self-aggrandizing, and flagrantly J
hypocritical: an invincible tower
of strength who dominates with ,
1 brute force the lives of all those ‘
I about him. It is only Heavenly
who has the spark of rebellion.
Unfortunately, Christine *
Vaughn as Heavenly is given lit- ■'
tie to do, although she delivers '
her few lines with an unfaltering !
assurance. Claire Christman as '
Aunt Nonnie does not fully rea- (
lize her character’s weaknesses 1
and uncertainty, and William 1
Houck as Tom Junior is nonde- 1
script where he should be a net
work of nerves. Sherril Spencer ■
is unfortunate as Miss Yucy, the
Boss’ money-grabbing mistress.
Herbert Kennedy, who appears 1
briefly as George Scudder,
Chance’s rival for Heavenly, has
mastered an admirable Southern
i accent.
