# Official Position Given on Shelters
## 
### LYLE NELSON Director of University Relations 
(Editors’ note: This statement
was prepared for The Daily to
explain the Administration's rea
sons for having fallout shelters
on campus.)

1 understand that one of the
issues which has been raised con
cerns the University’s willingness
to provide information on the de
cision to sot aside fallout shelters
on the Stanford campus. While I
do not think this is a valid issue,
nevertheless, to clear up any
doubt whatsoever, I am making
the following statement.
In essence it is based upon a
factual report given by Robert
Beyers of this office to a meeting
of the student congress on April
15. The material also has been
covered in two issues of the fac
ulty-staff newsletter and was dis
cussed by President Sterling in
his meeting with leaders of the
Peace Caucus on Tuesday.
The statement follows:
“For the past several years,
Stanford has cooperated with
county, state and national civil
defense officials in planning for
any type of disaster—fire, earth
quake, or military alert.
“The decision to participate in
the federally financed fallout
shelter program was made by the
University trustees following con
sultation by the administration
with faculty members and others
expert in this field. It is in accord
with recommendations of the
Committee on University Policy
and President Sterling.
“In general, the shelters repre
sent an extension of the Universi
ty’s continuing effort to mini
mize the effects of any potential
disaster on students, faculty, and
staff members. In this respect the
University recognizes a funda
mental obligation to parents of
students as well as to the stu
dents themselves.
“The effectiveness of the pres
ent program is clearly limited by
the minimum budget provided by
the Congress. Nevertheless, the
basement areas now designated
offer several times as much pro
tection against radioatcive fallout
as an exposed individual would
have outdoors. However unlikely
a nuclear accident or attack may
appear, it cannot be ruled out en
tirely as a possibility for the fu
ture. If such a disaster did occur,
the minimum protection offered
by the present program clearly
would be better than no protec
tion at all.
“Finally, it is pertinent to note
that those shelters are available
to all members of the campus
community: there is no require
ment that anyone not wishing to
use them must do so.”

disaster on students, faculty, and
staff members. In this respect the
University recognizes a funda
mental obligation to parents of
students as well as to the stu

“The effectiveness of the pres
ent program is clearly limited by
the minimum budget provided by
the Congress. Nevertheless, the
basement areas now designated
offer several times as much pro
tection against radioatcive fallout
as an exposed individual would
have outdoors. However unlikely
a nuclear accident or attack may
appear, it cannot be ruled out en
tirely as a possibility for the fu
ture. If such a disaster did occur,
the minimum protection offered
by the present program clearly
would be better than no protec
tion at all.
“Finally, it is pertinent to note
that those shelters are available
to all members of the campus
community: there is no require
ment that anyone not wishing to
use them must do so.”
(Editors’ note: This statement
was prepared for The Daily to
explain the Administration's rea
sons for having fallout shelters
on campus.)

1 understand that one of the
issues which has been raised con
cerns the University’s willingness
to provide information on the de
cision to sot aside fallout shelters
on the Stanford campus. While I
do not think this is a valid issue,
nevertheless, to clear up any
doubt whatsoever, I am making
the following statement.
In essence it is based upon a
factual report given by Robert
Beyers of this office to a meeting
of the student congress on April
15. The material also has been
covered in two issues of the fac
ulty-staff newsletter and was dis
cussed by President Sterling in
his meeting with leaders of the
Peace Caucus on Tuesday.
The statement follows:
“For the past several years,
Stanford has cooperated with
county, state and national civil
defense officials in planning for
any type of disaster—fire, earth
quake, or military alert.
“The decision to participate in
the federally financed fallout
shelter program was made by the
University trustees following con
sultation by the administration
with faculty members and others
expert in this field. It is in accord
with recommendations of the
Committee on University Policy
and President Sterling.
“In general, the shelters repre
sent an extension of the Universi
ty’s continuing effort to mini
mize the effects of any potential
disaster on students, faculty, and
staff members. In this respect the
University recognizes a funda
mental obligation to parents of
students as well as to the stu
dents themselves.
