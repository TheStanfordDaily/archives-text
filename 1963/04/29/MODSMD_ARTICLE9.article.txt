campus other than in private res

(Editors’ note; The following is
a statement by President Sterling
explaining University policy on
student demonstrations.)

Some Stanford students have
recently protested the Universi
ty’s decision to provide “fallout
shelters” in accord with the Na
tion’s Civil Defense program;
they have also protested that they
had no voice in the making of
that decision. These protests
were aired in a student-sponsored
public debate. Subsequently, a
small group of students met with
the President of the University to
request that ho or another officer
of the University publicly debate
the University’s decision with
them or their representatives.
The request was denied. These
students then gave notice that
they would protest the denial of
this request by conducting a
“vigil” outside the President’s
office by day and outside his
home by night,—this “vigil” to bo
of indefinite duration.
The University has notified stu
dents participating in this “vigil”
as follows;
1. A vigil may bo hold on the
campus in the areas which are
generally available to the public,
provided it is conducted in an or
derly manner and does not inter
fere with classes or other educa
tional processes and business of
the University.
2. A vigil may not be conducted
in the private residential areas of
the campus or in any manner
which represents harassment to
any person on the campus.
The University will assure it
self that each student involved
is apprised of this regulation and
will give notice that subsequent
violation of the regulation will
result in dismissal from the Uni
versity.
Those notifications have the
unanimous endorsement of the
Committee on University Policy,

mittee of the regular F'aculty of
