## 
### ELIZABETH FREEMAN 
Dr. Irving Howe, professor of English, speaking last evening
for die socialist caucus on “Problems of Socialist Thought,” point
ed out many reasons for a socialist to not make “intellectual peace”
with the status quo in America.
Although the living standards in the United States have risen,

the average national income is
low. since the affluence belongs
to a small number of people, he
said. Many groups of people lack
control and influence, he stated.
The capitalist society breeds
“false values,” such as the deceit
fulness involved in advertising.
The under-developed countries
look upon capitalism as some
thing left from the decadent past,
Much of the radical thought of
today has broken away from the
traditions of Marxism; with the
possibility of world destruction
we have lost faith in the idea of
the knowledge of history’s inner
logic.
HK FELT there were two kinds
of socialists one should not be:
the ex-radical, embittered, look
ing upon society as something
static that cannot after all be
changed, and the sect or ideologi
cal believer, fanatic and rigid in
his beliefs.
Socialism has two motivating
ideas—to build a state of free
dom and equality, and to estab
lish a society in which a certain
portion of the institutions are so
cially controlled.
He felt the economic gains
made under a ruthless authori
tarian communist state were not
worth the sacrifice in humane
values. And he stated that de
mocracy is an essential factor of
the socialist state.
