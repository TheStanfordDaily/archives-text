# Committees Study IHC Dead Week Proposal
## 
### MIKE SAKS 
The Inter-House Council (IHC), in its meeting last Sunday
night, unanimously aproved its proposal “For a Revitalized Dead
Week.” This proposal is now being studied by four University
committees: Student Affairs, General Studies, Schedule and
Exams, and Registrars, all of whose heads say that the proposal

•deserves "serious consideration.”
As background, the IHC pro
posal states that it is the current
policy of the Stanford faculty to
hold classes during the week pri
or to final examinations. Some
professors cancel classes during
the week prior to final examina
tions. Some professors cancel
classes or make no assignments
to help the students prepare for
exams, but many professors in
crease the work load and throw
in term paper deadlines.
The IHC supports the principle
that “education through course
work is not so much a matter of
glimpses of each assignment” as
it is “assimilation of all assign
ments and classes into a coherent
whole.” It believes that “assimi
lation is necessarily a part of any
review, but would have far great
er lasting value if time were al
lowed to reflect on, absorb, and
ultimately tie together the under
lying threads that run through
the daily class and assignment
schedules.”
With the rapid pace required
to complete a quarter’s work, the
IHC believes such assimilation
time is necessary for a liberal
education.
THE PROPOSAL has now to
thread its way through the laby
rinth of Stanford committees.
First, there is the Committee on
Student Affairs, headed by Eric
Hutchinson, and the Commit tee on
General Studies, headed by Rob
ert Walker. From there, the pro
posal, with the committees’ com
ments, goes on to the Committee
on Schedule and Exams, headed
by Joseph Franzini, which is a
subcommittee of the Registrar’s
Committee, which will recom
mend it to the Academic Commit
tee which will make the final de
cision..
The proposal reads: “Recogniz
ing the importance of academic
excellence at Stanford, the Inter-
House Council believes that the
study time allotted for final ex
amination preparation should be
increased. It is our unanimous
recommendation that no regular
classes and no tests should be
held during the five calendar
days immediately preceding final
exams (e.g. Wednesday-Sunday
in a typical Autumn or Winter
Quarter), and that no assign
ments or term papers should fall
due during this period.
“While recognizing that in a
very few cases (e.g. introductory
language courses), class meeting
during this period would contrib
ute more than a student could
achieve on his own, we believe
this to be the exceptional case,
and in no case can we justify ad
ditional assignments. We affirm,
however, the importance of in
dividual contact with the faculty
and believe that office hours
should be kept and increased dur
ing this time.
“WE CONCUR in the present
University policy of prohibiting
organized students’ activities dur
ing this period and believe that
it should be strictly followed.
Adoption of such a dead week
would best alleviate the pressure
of finals week and would bo a
significant step toward increas
ing the value of the Stanford edu
cational experience.”

committees: Student Affairs, General Studies, Schedule and
Exams, and Registrars, all of whose heads say that the proposal

•deserves "serious consideration.”
As background, the IHC pro
posal states that it is the current
policy of the Stanford faculty to
hold classes during the week pri
or to final examinations. Some
professors cancel classes during
the week prior to final examina
tions. Some professors cancel
classes or make no assignments
to help the students prepare for
exams, but many professors in
crease the work load and throw
in term paper deadlines.
The IHC supports the principle
that “education through course
work is not so much a matter of
glimpses of each assignment” as
it is “assimilation of all assign
ments and classes into a coherent
whole.” It believes that “assimi
lation is necessarily a part of any
review, but would have far great
er lasting value if time were al
lowed to reflect on, absorb, and
ultimately tie together the under
lying threads that run through
the daily class and assignment
schedules.”
With the rapid pace required
to complete a quarter’s work, the
IHC believes such assimilation
time is necessary for a liberal
education.
THE PROPOSAL has now to
thread its way through the laby
rinth of Stanford committees.
First, there is the Committee on
Student Affairs, headed by Eric
Hutchinson, and the Commit tee on
General Studies, headed by Rob
ert Walker. From there, the pro
posal, with the committees’ com
ments, goes on to the Committee
on Schedule and Exams, headed
by Joseph Franzini, which is a
subcommittee of the Registrar’s
Committee, which will recom
mend it to the Academic Commit
tee which will make the final de
cision..
The proposal reads: “Recogniz
ing the importance of academic
excellence at Stanford, the Inter-
House Council believes that the
study time allotted for final ex
amination preparation should be
increased. It is our unanimous
recommendation that no regular
classes and no tests should be
held during the five calendar
days immediately preceding final
exams (e.g. Wednesday-Sunday
in a typical Autumn or Winter
Quarter), and that no assign
ments or term papers should fall
due during this period.
“While recognizing that in a
very few cases (e.g. introductory
language courses), class meeting
during this period would contrib
ute more than a student could
achieve on his own, we believe
this to be the exceptional case,
and in no case can we justify ad
ditional assignments. We affirm,
however, the importance of in
dividual contact with the faculty
and believe that office hours
should be kept and increased dur
ing this time.
“WE CONCUR in the present
University policy of prohibiting
organized students’ activities dur
ing this period and believe that
it should be strictly followed.
Adoption of such a dead week
would best alleviate the pressure
of finals week and would bo a
significant step toward increas
ing the value of the Stanford edu
cational experience.”
The Inter-House Council (IHC), in its meeting last Sunday
night, unanimously aproved its proposal “For a Revitalized Dead
Week.” This proposal is now being studied by four University
committees: Student Affairs, General Studies, Schedule and
