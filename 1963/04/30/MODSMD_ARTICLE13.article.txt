# Have All Questions Been Answered?
## 
### 
Tlii' Peace Caucus “vigilers” are asking that a representa
tive of the University participate in a discussion in which he
would give a speech and answer questions from the floor
concerning the University’s reasons for adopting its policy
on fallout shelters.
President Sterling, however, feels that such a discussion
lias, in fact, already taken place. When Mr. Robert Beyers,
of the Stanford News and Publications Service, spoke before
the Stanford Student Congress, he made it clear that he was
there as an official of the University. lie answered, to the
best of his ability, all of the questions that were asked him.
IF, as it appears so, such a discussion was held, the Peace
Caucus people actually have very little else that they may ask
for rightfully, because that which they are demanding has
already taken place. The University can not be held responsi
ble for the absence of some interested people from the meet
ing, or, supposedly, for the lack of the proper questions being
asked.
Mr. Beyers was asked mostly technical questions, many of
which he could answer only partially because of a lack of
technical knowledge. According to a spokesman of the Stu
dent Congress, he was not asked questions about the reasons
for the policy of the University because the Congress had
been previously informed that Mr. Beyers would discuss only
information about the shelters themselves, and would not
discuss questions of policy formation.
It is apparent, then, that there has not been a session in
which such questions have been asked.
The University has issued a statement, which appeared in
yesterday’s Daily, which told the University’s reasons for hav
ing the fallout shelters. The University is most concerned with
the ideas that this is a low budget project paid almost entirely
by the Federal Government, and thus not taking money away
from the usual University expenses; and that this is a logical
extension of the University’s policy to provide some type of
general disaster protection for the members of the com
munity.
The members of the Peace Caucus, however, are concern
ed with the moral and political implications of the establish
ment of the shelters. This is a reasonable concern which has
not, apparently, been commented upon publicly by the Uni
versity.
The University cannot be entirely adverse to speaking
and answering questions about the policy on the shelters if
Mr. Beyers was allowed to speak at the Student Congress.
Both the technical questions which Mr. Beyers could not
answer, and the moral-political questions which he was not
asked, have not really been answered and are of concern to
the members of the community. It does not seem out of
place to ask that these questions be answered, and to ask that
agreement on a method of exchange he reached.
