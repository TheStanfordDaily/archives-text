# STAFF OPINION
## Vigils: For The Birds? 
### RICHARD WEING Contributing Editor 
(The following is an open letter to the President of Bodega
University—Stanford-On-The Russian River)
Dear President Starling:
It has come to our attention that this University entertains
the hysterical belief that, at some future time, Bodega Bay may
be subjected to a massive, surprise attack by large numbers of
crows, gulls, and other species of fowl: an assault which would
endanger human life and limb; a feathered Pearl Harbor.
Therefore, the University has, without consulting either
students or faculty, attempted to “protect” its members from
The Birds by:
(a) Equipping ail buildings containing plate glass windows
with storm shutters and side boards;
(b) Providing all “shelters” with shovels and hoses, for
later ridding the campus of the unlimited quantities of con
taminating fall-out which such an aerial attack would inevitably
deposit;
(c) Procuring a bountiful supply of sling-shots and cats.
While we sympathize with the University’s concern, we
stand unalterably opposed to this course of action for the follow
ing reasons:
tl) No danger of such attack exists, save in the feverish
minds of paranoiac, right-wing alarmists.
Everyone knows that The Birds desire nothing more than to
live in peace. Man’s peaceful little feathered friends hut bring
beauty and song into the world. They would never attack any
thing without having first been molested, tormented, or other
wise unjustly provoked. Anyone who thinks differently has
simply been seeing too many motion pictures.
(2) The University’s present policy will, undoubtedly, be
construed as part of an aggressive policy against our feathered
friends and might, hence, provoke them into just such an attack.
Providing clap board for windows and doors could well con
vince The Birds that wo are preparing for any retaliation which
might be incurred by our participation in a turkey shoot or
pheasant hunt. Therefore, The Birds might understandably be
tempted to indulge in a pre-emptive strike to protect them
selves. After all, unguarded plate glass windows do signify our
good faith in their intentions, etc., etc., etc.
(3) If an attack should occur, these few precautions would
provide the academic community with no real protection at all.
Any attack would come so swiftly that few persons would be
able to reach the shelters before being overcome by either The
Birds or their demoralizing fall-out.
(4) Living in the University’s “shelters” would destroy the
few vestiges of civilization which a student has managed to re
tain during his prior tenure in the academy.
The regimentation necessary to maintain order in any given
“shelter” would induce a form of collectivism inimical to every
concept of individual liberty extolled in our classrooms. Such
discipline would constitute a form of “creeping fascism,” has
tening the descent on the road to tyranny initiated by its insidi
ous predecessor: the fire drill.
Besides, house-mothers would always be present . . .
(5) The University’s program will distract our attention
from discovering more important, positive steps to reduce the
mutual misunderstandings which create tensions between our
selves and The Birds.
Therefore, the University should discontinue its present
program of “civil defense”; divert funds appropriated for this
purpose to the Audubon Society; construct bird-baths; and ex
plore new horizons of cultural exchange. All existing storm shut
ters and side-boards should be dismantled, forthwith, and dis
tributed among the living groups so that student fireside discus
sions on ornithology might receive great enlightenment.
Moreover, sir, if you do not engage in open debate with us
on the virtue of our proposals, we have no alternative but to
register our discontent by maintaining moonlight vigils around
your home and office; and by liberally adorning each with bird
seed.

University—Stanford-On-The Russian River)
Dear President Starling:
It has come to our attention that this University entertains
the hysterical belief that, at some future time, Bodega Bay may
be subjected to a massive, surprise attack by large numbers of
crows, gulls, and other species of fowl: an assault which would
endanger human life and limb; a feathered Pearl Harbor.
Therefore, the University has, without consulting either
students or faculty, attempted to “protect” its members from
The Birds by:
(a) Equipping ail buildings containing plate glass windows
with storm shutters and side boards;
(b) Providing all “shelters” with shovels and hoses, for
later ridding the campus of the unlimited quantities of con
taminating fall-out which such an aerial attack would inevitably
deposit;
(c) Procuring a bountiful supply of sling-shots and cats.
While we sympathize with the University’s concern, we
stand unalterably opposed to this course of action for the follow
ing reasons:
tl) No danger of such attack exists, save in the feverish
minds of paranoiac, right-wing alarmists.
Everyone knows that The Birds desire nothing more than to
live in peace. Man’s peaceful little feathered friends hut bring
beauty and song into the world. They would never attack any
thing without having first been molested, tormented, or other
wise unjustly provoked. Anyone who thinks differently has
simply been seeing too many motion pictures.
(2) The University’s present policy will, undoubtedly, be
construed as part of an aggressive policy against our feathered
friends and might, hence, provoke them into just such an attack.
Providing clap board for windows and doors could well con
vince The Birds that wo are preparing for any retaliation which
might be incurred by our participation in a turkey shoot or
pheasant hunt. Therefore, The Birds might understandably be
tempted to indulge in a pre-emptive strike to protect them
selves. After all, unguarded plate glass windows do signify our
good faith in their intentions, etc., etc., etc.
(3) If an attack should occur, these few precautions would
provide the academic community with no real protection at all.
Any attack would come so swiftly that few persons would be
able to reach the shelters before being overcome by either The
Birds or their demoralizing fall-out.
(4) Living in the University’s “shelters” would destroy the
few vestiges of civilization which a student has managed to re
tain during his prior tenure in the academy.
The regimentation necessary to maintain order in any given
“shelter” would induce a form of collectivism inimical to every
concept of individual liberty extolled in our classrooms. Such
discipline would constitute a form of “creeping fascism,” has
tening the descent on the road to tyranny initiated by its insidi
ous predecessor: the fire drill.
Besides, house-mothers would always be present . . .
