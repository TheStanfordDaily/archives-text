## Bruins Swamp Indian Crew 
### 
Total disaster struck the Stan
ford crew in Los Angeles Satur
day, as the varsity, junior varsi
ty, and freshman UCLA crews
registered a throe-race sweep
over the Indian oarsmen. It was
the first UCLA varsity win over
Stanford in 10 years.
THE VARSITY lost by a boat
length in the 2000-meter race.
UCLA started out fast at a 40-
strokes per minute rate, as the
Tribe crewmen expected. But the
Bruins kept up the withering
pace, instead of dropping flown
to a 32-stroke rate, as they had
done in past races.
Stanford was a mere half
length behind at the midway
point, but then raised its stroke
rate instead of lowering it to the
normal Stanford rate of 31. After
that UCLA slowly pulled away
to a convincing four-second mar
gin at the finish.
The junior varsity rowed its
best race of the year, but lost by
two and a half lengths to a UCLA
JV crew that was as good as the
Bruin varsity.
THK SECOND Stanford fresh
man boat lost to the regular
UCLA frosh by awhopping five
lengths.
The loss gave the varsity a 3-2
race record, while the JVâ€™s are
0-5 and the 2nd frosh crew is
0-2-1. The first string Indian frosh
boat is undefeated at 2-0 and will
race the Bruin yearlings this Sat
urday in the Harbach Cup in
San Pedro.
Stanford has won the Harbach
Cup ever since it was offered
nine years ago. The Cup is given
to the victor in the Stanford-
UCLA-USC race.
TWO STANFORD crewmen
have won a gold medal in the
pair-oared with coxswain race at
the Pan American Games in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, Conn Findley, Stan
ford crew coach; Ed Ferry, var
sity crew stroke; and freshman
Charley Blitzer (who was eoxt
won their 2000-meter race in a
fine 7:30 time.
