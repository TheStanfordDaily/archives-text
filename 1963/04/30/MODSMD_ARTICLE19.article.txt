## 
### JIM DONOVAN 
On Friday the frosh baseball
team, plagued by a lack of pitch
ing depth, was caught from be
hind by the Santa Clara Frosh,
losing 6-5.
Stanford led by one going into
the ninth. 5-4, but after two were
out Santa Clara scored twice on
a walk, a check-swing double, and
a two-bagger down the left field
line.
DICK CONWAY was the losing
pitcher, working but 5 innings;
however, Conway had pitched 7
frames against Cal on Wednes
day and so was working with
only one day of rest.
The number one and number
four pitchers, Terry Docken and
Ron Yett both have sore arms
and are unable to throw at all.
Thus, the load has fallen on Con-
W'ay and tall Lon Raymond who
sees double duty in the outfield.
Moreover the frosh are now play
ing four or five games a week in
a frantic effort to make up the
2 that were rained out or can
celled during the earlier weeks of
the season.
The pitchers show signs of, if
not collapse, at least serious fa
tigue. The frosh hitters cotinued
to give them consistent, power
ful support, outhitting Santa
Clara 11 to 9,
STAR CATCHER Jimmy Hibbs
hit his third home run of the
year and drove in his thirteenth
run. He leads the squad in both
the power departments and is
second in batting with a ,435 av

erage. (The versatile Raymond
leads the squad at .458) Outfield
er Cliff Harris collected three hits
in four trips and now is the
third leading hitter with an avre
age of .368. The over-all team bat
ting average is ,2X8 as opposed
to the opponents’ .127.
The frosh play four games this
week, a double-header at San
Jose on Wednesday, a single home
game against Balboa High on
Friday, and a rematch with the
Cal frosh at Berkeley on Satur
day.
