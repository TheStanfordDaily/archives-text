### 
Entries close today for the "Is
sues of Challenge’’ debate tour
nament, to be contested among
Stanford living groups on the
question of United States civil
defense. The preliminary rounds
of the tournament will take place
this Saturday.
“The response so far has been
loss than enthusiastic,” according
to Speech Association President
Chuck Bischoff. “Either every
one who cares about civil de
fense is out ‘vigiling’ or Stanford
students are just too inarticulate
to develop their opinions into log
ical arguments.”
"It is somewhat disappointing
that Stanford students got so hot
under the collar about the right
to express their opinions, but
when they are given a platform
and a controversial issue, they
seem unwilling to take advantage
of it,” Bischoff said.
Teams, which consist of one af
firmative and one negative speak
er, may bo entered by any living
group. In addition, independents
may organize their own teams.
Debates will be in the Lincoln-
Douglas style, with one speaker
on each side of the proposition
“Resolved, that the United States
Civil Defense program should be
discontinued.”
After three preliminary rounds
on Saturday, the records of both
team members will be added to
gether to determine which teams
will enter the elimination rounds.
The final debate is scheduled for
Wednesday, May Bth.
Questions on the debate can be
addressed to Bischoff. at DA 3-
3347. Entries must be turned in
to the ASSU office by today.
