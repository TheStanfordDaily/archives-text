# 'Project Amigos' Applications Open
## 
### 
Applications are now available
in the HR Loft for students in
terested in spending from a week
to a month this summer working
to improve the living conditions
in the Tijuana, Mexico, area.
Called “Project Amigos,” this
nonprofit organization will send
students in groups of about
twelve to do work such as nurs
ing, teaching, typing, building
and repair, recreation direction
and work in improving nutrition
and sanitation.
“Project Amigos” is presently
operating in army barracks
which will eventually become a
social center for the whole Ti
juana area. The work now going
on, done by young adults, both
American and Mexican, plans and
coordinates activities involving
health, education and recreation.
The chairman of the project,
Mrs. Mabel Dancelis, has had
thirty years of experience in so
cial work, including service with
the United Natoins Relief Asso
ciation in China. She has organiz
ed the current program on a
"help-them-to - help - themselves"
basis; she is training Mexicans to
teach and do social work so that
they can carry on the present
work when “Project Amigos”
ends.
The program has the full sup
port of the Tijuana government,
including help from a mayor-ap
pointed committee. It also has
backing from American groups
like the YMCA and church or
ganizations.
Applications should be return
ed to the HR Loft by May 10.
