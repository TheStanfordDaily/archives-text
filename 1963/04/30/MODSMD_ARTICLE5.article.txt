SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic—Haiti bowed to a de
mand from the Dominican Embassy in Port Au Prince, the govern
ment announced last night. The announcement appeared to reduce
sharply a threat of war that had been building up since Friday
between the two nations which occupy the Caribbean island of His
paniola. So tense had the situation become before last night’s an
nouncement, the U.S. Navy declared itself ready to move “in hours
if not minutes" either to evacuate the more than 1,000 Americans
from the area or participate in any peacemaking. The Dominican
Republic had gone on a war footing, moving tanks and troops toward
the border and warships to waters off Haiti,

COMMUNISTS GAIN GROUND ROME—Premier Amintorc Fan
fani’s lcft-of-center government lost ground steadily yesterday as
thousands of protest votes in Italy’s parliamentary elections went
to the Communists and the far right. The biggest gain appeared to
have been made by the liberals which, despite the name, form an
ultra right-wing party. The liberal trend had been expected but the
strengthened Communist vote came as a surprise. The Communists
polled 23.7 per cent of the popular vote in the last elections and
could top that in this election.
