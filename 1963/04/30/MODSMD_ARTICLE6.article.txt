# Provost Ter man Describes Job
## 
### WILLIAM MOORE 
He's like the corner policeman.
Except he covers a much bigger beat;—and he
wields a different kind of stick.
He’s Frederick Terman, Stanford’s provost.
“I’m the man that sees that decisions get made
that academic people need to have made,” Terman
explains. “The title of provost entails entirely
different work at different universities, so the
title itself doesn’t mean very much.”
But the job does at Stanford. And it entails
“final administrative responsibility” for such
areas as departmental budgets, faculty appoint
ments, interdepartmental coordination, academic
building construction, and overall educational poli
cy and planning—all of which are subject to ap
proval by the president.
Last week, for instance, Terman leafed
through memorandums ranging from a report on
“The Problems of Furnishing Confidential In
formation of University Academic Policy to Gov
ernment Agencies" to the financial details of con
verting a yacht into a floating biology laboratory.
“No doubt about it,” Terman admits. “It’s diversi
fied work.”
One of the provost’s most important responsi
bilities is that of watchdog over the multitude of
departmental budgets. “I receive budgets from
all the deans, the library, and the registrar’s of
fice,” points out Terman. “Each of them, of
course, work out their own budgets; but since
we’re limited on funds, I have a responsibility to
the president to see that the total budget is put
together . . . and meets ends.”
Terman also spends long hours reviewing fac
luty appointments and promotions. He and a staff
of three—Robert Wert, vice provost; Albert Bow
ker, dean of the Graduate Division; and Howard
Brooks, associate dean of the Graduate Division
sift through hundreds of recommendations sub
mitted by the department heads.
“After we’ve all read each person’s folder, we
discuss the whole list (of recommendations) in
my office,” Terman says. “Some of them are
merely routine, but we don’t always approve
what’s recommended-even though the deans do
a good job of filtering.”
Terman and his staff are particularly critical
of re-appointments involving tenure. “Wo keep

constant pressure on the departments and the
schools,” he explains. “If they get soft-hearted,
our duty is to be firm.”
After receiving approval from the president,
the provost submits his final recommendations to
the Advisory Board, a seven-man faculty commit
tee that represents the faculty. “Usually this
group agrees with our review,” says Terman. But,
in the rare instances that it doesn’t, the Advisory
Board can register a dissenting opinion. The final
decision is made by the Board of Trustees. “If
there’s no dissent involved (with the Advisory
Board), the trustees almost always concur with
the president’s recommendation and the review
from the provost's office.”
In scouting for new faculty members, Terman
and his staff operate on what he calls a “steeples
of strength” strategy. “We try to build up unusual
strength in areas of basic importance,” he ex
plains. “For instance, not too long ago we hired
several superb people in natural products chemis
try. an important field."
Terman also points to the Mathematics De
partment with pride. “It’s something we should
be—and are- strong in. Like chemistry, it’s a
central area that serves many other areas.”
A big potential pitfall in faculty recruiting is
what Terman calls the “dead area.” “We make a
special effort,” explains the provost, “to stay
away from hiring professors whose fields are
becoming extinct. For instance, high-voltage en
gineering used to bo a big thing in the thirties
but has litle importance academically today. You
can bet we won't hire anyone whose specialty is
high-voltage engineering.
Is there any difference in the emphasis at the
University on the sciences and the humanities
and social sciences? No. According to Terman,
“Wo try to keep them all in balance. Of course,
many government funds are being given for en
gineering and science research, but we tend to
give compensation to the other non-science areas.
We don’t starve them just because they receive
no outside funds.”
Stanford. Terman pointed out, has pumped
much money recently into such departments as
history, art, and drama.
But, he adds: "We follow no strict formula that
divides the departments up and determines what
they will get.”


ANTI-VIGIL VIGILERS have staked their own spot next to the Peace Caucus vigilers in front of
President Sterling’s office. They respect the right to maintain a vigil and their vigil represents
their opposition to the aims of the original vigil. The Peace Caucus in a statement to the Daily
reiterated the purpose of its vigil: “The vigil is not designed to protest fallout shelters per se,- the
goal of public discussion remains as the purpose of the vigil.”

A big potential pitfall in faculty recruiting is
what Terman calls the “dead area.” “We make a
special effort,” explains the provost, “to stay
away from hiring professors whose fields are
becoming extinct. For instance, high-voltage en
gineering used to bo a big thing in the thirties
but has litle importance academically today. You
can bet we won't hire anyone whose specialty is
high-voltage engineering.
Is there any difference in the emphasis at the
University on the sciences and the humanities
and social sciences? No. According to Terman,
“Wo try to keep them all in balance. Of course,
many government funds are being given for en
gineering and science research, but we tend to
give compensation to the other non-science areas.
We don’t starve them just because they receive
no outside funds.”
Stanford. Terman pointed out, has pumped
much money recently into such departments as
history, art, and drama.
But, he adds: "We follow no strict formula that
divides the departments up and determines what
they will get.”


ANTI-VIGIL VIGILERS have staked their own spot next to the Peace Caucus vigilers in front of
President Sterling’s office. They respect the right to maintain a vigil and their vigil represents
their opposition to the aims of the original vigil. The Peace Caucus in a statement to the Daily
reiterated the purpose of its vigil: “The vigil is not designed to protest fallout shelters per se,- the
goal of public discussion remains as the purpose of the vigil.”
He's like the corner policeman.
Except he covers a much bigger beat;—and he
wields a different kind of stick.
He’s Frederick Terman, Stanford’s provost.
“I’m the man that sees that decisions get made
that academic people need to have made,” Terman
explains. “The title of provost entails entirely
different work at different universities, so the
title itself doesn’t mean very much.”
But the job does at Stanford. And it entails
“final administrative responsibility” for such
areas as departmental budgets, faculty appoint
ments, interdepartmental coordination, academic
building construction, and overall educational poli
cy and planning—all of which are subject to ap
proval by the president.
Last week, for instance, Terman leafed
through memorandums ranging from a report on
“The Problems of Furnishing Confidential In
formation of University Academic Policy to Gov
ernment Agencies" to the financial details of con
verting a yacht into a floating biology laboratory.
“No doubt about it,” Terman admits. “It’s diversi
fied work.”
One of the provost’s most important responsi
bilities is that of watchdog over the multitude of
departmental budgets. “I receive budgets from
all the deans, the library, and the registrar’s of
fice,” points out Terman. “Each of them, of
course, work out their own budgets; but since
we’re limited on funds, I have a responsibility to
the president to see that the total budget is put
together . . . and meets ends.”
Terman also spends long hours reviewing fac
luty appointments and promotions. He and a staff
of three—Robert Wert, vice provost; Albert Bow
ker, dean of the Graduate Division; and Howard
Brooks, associate dean of the Graduate Division
sift through hundreds of recommendations sub
mitted by the department heads.
“After we’ve all read each person’s folder, we
discuss the whole list (of recommendations) in
my office,” Terman says. “Some of them are
merely routine, but we don’t always approve
what’s recommended-even though the deans do
a good job of filtering.”
Terman and his staff are particularly critical
of re-appointments involving tenure. “Wo keep

constant pressure on the departments and the
schools,” he explains. “If they get soft-hearted,
our duty is to be firm.”
After receiving approval from the president,
the provost submits his final recommendations to
the Advisory Board, a seven-man faculty commit
tee that represents the faculty. “Usually this
group agrees with our review,” says Terman. But,
in the rare instances that it doesn’t, the Advisory
Board can register a dissenting opinion. The final
decision is made by the Board of Trustees. “If
there’s no dissent involved (with the Advisory
Board), the trustees almost always concur with
the president’s recommendation and the review
from the provost's office.”
In scouting for new faculty members, Terman
and his staff operate on what he calls a “steeples
of strength” strategy. “We try to build up unusual
strength in areas of basic importance,” he ex
plains. “For instance, not too long ago we hired
several superb people in natural products chemis
try. an important field."
Terman also points to the Mathematics De
partment with pride. “It’s something we should
be—and are- strong in. Like chemistry, it’s a
central area that serves many other areas.”

my office,” Terman says. “Some of them are
merely routine, but we don’t always approve
what’s recommended-even though the deans do
a good job of filtering.”
Terman and his staff are particularly critical
of re-appointments involving tenure. “Wo keep

constant pressure on the departments and the
schools,” he explains. “If they get soft-hearted,
our duty is to be firm.”
After receiving approval from the president,
the provost submits his final recommendations to
the Advisory Board, a seven-man faculty commit
tee that represents the faculty. “Usually this
group agrees with our review,” says Terman. But,
in the rare instances that it doesn’t, the Advisory
Board can register a dissenting opinion. The final
decision is made by the Board of Trustees. “If
there’s no dissent involved (with the Advisory
Board), the trustees almost always concur with
the president’s recommendation and the review
from the provost's office.”
In scouting for new faculty members, Terman
and his staff operate on what he calls a “steeples
of strength” strategy. “We try to build up unusual
strength in areas of basic importance,” he ex
plains. “For instance, not too long ago we hired
several superb people in natural products chemis
try. an important field."
Terman also points to the Mathematics De
partment with pride. “It’s something we should
be—and are- strong in. Like chemistry, it’s a
central area that serves many other areas.”
A big potential pitfall in faculty recruiting is
what Terman calls the “dead area.” “We make a
special effort,” explains the provost, “to stay
away from hiring professors whose fields are
becoming extinct. For instance, high-voltage en
gineering used to bo a big thing in the thirties
but has litle importance academically today. You
can bet we won't hire anyone whose specialty is
high-voltage engineering.
Is there any difference in the emphasis at the
University on the sciences and the humanities
and social sciences? No. According to Terman,
“Wo try to keep them all in balance. Of course,
many government funds are being given for en
gineering and science research, but we tend to
give compensation to the other non-science areas.
We don’t starve them just because they receive
no outside funds.”
Stanford. Terman pointed out, has pumped
much money recently into such departments as
history, art, and drama.
But, he adds: "We follow no strict formula that
divides the departments up and determines what
they will get.”


ANTI-VIGIL VIGILERS have staked their own spot next to the Peace Caucus vigilers in front of
President Sterling’s office. They respect the right to maintain a vigil and their vigil represents
their opposition to the aims of the original vigil. The Peace Caucus in a statement to the Daily
reiterated the purpose of its vigil: “The vigil is not designed to protest fallout shelters per se,- the
goal of public discussion remains as the purpose of the vigil.”
He's like the corner policeman.
Except he covers a much bigger beat;—and he
wields a different kind of stick.
He’s Frederick Terman, Stanford’s provost.
“I’m the man that sees that decisions get made
that academic people need to have made,” Terman
explains. “The title of provost entails entirely
different work at different universities, so the
title itself doesn’t mean very much.”
But the job does at Stanford. And it entails
“final administrative responsibility” for such
areas as departmental budgets, faculty appoint
ments, interdepartmental coordination, academic
building construction, and overall educational poli
cy and planning—all of which are subject to ap
proval by the president.
Last week, for instance, Terman leafed
through memorandums ranging from a report on
“The Problems of Furnishing Confidential In
formation of University Academic Policy to Gov
ernment Agencies" to the financial details of con
verting a yacht into a floating biology laboratory.
“No doubt about it,” Terman admits. “It’s diversi
fied work.”
One of the provost’s most important responsi
bilities is that of watchdog over the multitude of
departmental budgets. “I receive budgets from
all the deans, the library, and the registrar’s of
fice,” points out Terman. “Each of them, of
course, work out their own budgets; but since
we’re limited on funds, I have a responsibility to
the president to see that the total budget is put
together . . . and meets ends.”
Terman also spends long hours reviewing fac
luty appointments and promotions. He and a staff
of three—Robert Wert, vice provost; Albert Bow
ker, dean of the Graduate Division; and Howard
Brooks, associate dean of the Graduate Division
sift through hundreds of recommendations sub
mitted by the department heads.
“After we’ve all read each person’s folder, we
discuss the whole list (of recommendations) in
my office,” Terman says. “Some of them are
merely routine, but we don’t always approve
what’s recommended-even though the deans do
a good job of filtering.”
