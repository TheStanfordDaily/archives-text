# UC Student Body Votes to Replace Semester System With Quarter Plan
## 
### MIKE SAKS 
In a campus-wide election last
Thursday and Friday, students at
Cal in Berkeley voted in favor of
a quarter system similar to Stan
ford’s to replace their present
two-semester system.
The poll is part of a state-wide
survey conducted by the Board
of Regents, which has voted to
abandon the present two-semes
ter system with a brief summer
session and intersession sand
wiched in. The Master Plan for
Higher Education in California
and the Academic Plan for the
University of California both rec
ommend that the University im
plement a year-round calendar to
improve the utilization of exist
ing facilities.
In the next five years, enroll
ment at the State universities is
expected to increase from a pres
ent 57,000 to more than 87,000.
Cal will handle its share of the
increased enrollment by improv
ing utilization of its existing
campus. Berkeley is expected to
reach its enrollment ceiling of
27,500 in two years.
STUDENTS AT Uf LA have
voted their approval of a trimes
ter system that would provide
three terms of equal length, one
being a four-month summer va
cation.
An editorial in (he Daily Cali
fornian last Thursday came out
strongly in favor of the quarter
system. Among the advantages

listed were: greater variety of
courses, increase in study con
centration, an end to the two
week “lame duck” period after
Christmas vacation, and better
co-ordination with other academic
institutions.
DRAWBACKS to the quarter
system include the need for com
plete course revision and doubl
ing of exam and counseling work.
The three-term system would
require no significant course
changes, but it would mean the
May-to-August term would lit
badly with almost every univer
sity calendar. Students would
normally attend two terms and
have the third for a four-month
vacation, or they could accelerate
their studies and graduate in less
than four years.
Berkeley is expecting a present
summer enrollment of 10,000 stu
dents, if graduate students are
counted. With year-round opera
tion, President Clark Kerr said
that the summer term would be
tuition-free to California resi
dents, and all students would
have to be fully admissable stu
dents.
The status quo also has its de
fenders. An English professor at
Cal had a letter to the editor pub
lished in the Daily Californian
stating that the dangers of the
present system have been worked
ot t over the years. All this would
bo lost if a new plan were adopt
ed.
