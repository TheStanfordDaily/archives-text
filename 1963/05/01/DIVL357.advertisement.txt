IT’S A GAS!
(and easy on it]
This is quite a car . . . the Rambler American 440-H
Hardtop. Clean lines and a sporty flair. Looks that
say "go." A power plant that has the message, plus
saving ways with a tank of gas.
Plenty of people room. Buckets, console, and
138-hp engine standard. Twin-Stick Floor Shift
adds lots of action at little cost.
Rambler prices are tagged to save you money.
And you keep saving after you own one. More serv
ice-free. Muffler and tailpipe designed to last at
least as many years as the original buyer owns the
car. Double-Safety Brakes (self-adjusting, too) and
a host of other solid Rambler features. Why not see
and drive a Rambler soon—at your Rambler dealer.
