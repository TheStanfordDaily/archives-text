FILLING A WELL-NEEDED GAP
Although my sou is u college freshman, I am glad to say that
he is still not too old to climb up on my lap and have a heart
to-heart talk when things are troubling him. My boy is enrolled
at Harvard wiiere ho is studying to be a fireman. From the
time he was a little tiny baby he always said he wanted to lie
a fireman. Of course, my wife and I believed that he would
eventually grow out of it, but no sir, the little chap never
wavered in his ambition for one minute!
So here he is at Harvard today taking courses in net holding,
mouth-to-mouth breathing, carbon tetrachloride, and Dalma
tian dogs. It is a full schedule for the young man, and that, in
fact, is exactly what we talked about when last he climbed
upon my lap.
He complained that every bit of his time is taken up with his
major requirements, lie doesn’t have so much as one hour a
week to sample any of the fascinating courses outside his major
—history, literature, language, science, or any of the thousand
and one things that appeal to his keen young mind.
I am sure that many of you find yourselves in the same
scholastic bind; you are taking so many requirements that you
can’t find time for some appealing electives. Therefore, in to
day's column I will forego levity and give you a brief survey in
a subject that is probably not included in yonr curriculum.

I have asked the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes whether I
might employ this column—normally a vehicle for innocent
merriment —to pursue this serious end. “Of course you may,
crazy kid,” they replied kindlily, their grey eyes crinkling at
the corners, their manly mouths twisted in funny little grins.
If you arc a Marlboro smoker —and what intelligent human
person is not?—you would expect the makers of Marlboro to
be fine men. And so they are —wonderful guys, every man-jack
of them—good, generous, understanding, wise. They are each
lipped with a pure white filter and come in soft pack or Flip-
Top box.
Hut I digress. We were going to take up a topic you arc
probably unable to cover vn yonr busy academic life. Let us
start with the most basic topic of all—anthropology, the study
of man himself.
Man is usually defined as a tool-making animal, but I per
sonally do not find this definition entirely satisfactory. Man is
not the only species which makes tools. The simians, for ex
ample, make monkey wrenches.
Still, when you come to a really complicated tool—like a
linotype, for instance—you can be fairly sure it was made by
Homo sapiens or else a very intelligent tiger. The question one
should ask, therefore, is not who made the tool, but what did
he do with it.
For example, in a recent excavation in the Olduvai Gorge a
large assortment of hominoid fossils was found, all dating back
to the Middle Pleistocene Age. Buried with the fossils was a
number of their artifacts, the most interesting being a black
metal box which emitted a steady beeping sound. Now, of
course, zoologists will tell you that tree frogs make such boxes
which they employ in their mating activities (I can’t go into
detail about it in this family newspaper) but the eminent an
thropological team, Mr. and Mrs. Walther Sigafoos (both he
and she are named Walther) were convinced that this particular
box was made not by tree frogs but by Neanderthal men. To
prove their point, they switched on the box and out came
television, which, as everyone knows, was the forerunner of fire.
If there is anything more you need to know about anthro
pology, just climb uj) on my lap as soon as my son leaves.

The makers of Marlboro Cigarettes who sponsor (his column, often
with trepidation, are not anthropologists. They are tobacconists—
good ones, I think—and I think you'll think so too when you sample
their wares—available wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty
states.
