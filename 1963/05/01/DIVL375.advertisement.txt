COULD THIS
BE WHY
THE FOUR
FRESHMEN
CAN'T FINISH
SCHOOL?
Yes, But there's nothing wrong
with their addition. Four master
vocalists, plus four swinging
instrumentalists, plus four on
stage-off the cuff comedians
total Four Freshmen. Floncst.
And this fantastic triple threat
versatility is why college audi
ences refuse to let the Freshmen
finish school.
In “The Four Freshmen in
Person • Volume 2” on Capitol,
you'll hear them at their versa
tile best, in a recording made
during an unforgettable per
formance at Long Beach City
College. The packed house
called it great, and so will you.
Look for“ The Four Freshmen
in Person • Volume 2” on Capi
tol, and look for the Four Fresh
men in concert on your campus.
