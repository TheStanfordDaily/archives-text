MANY of you like our button-downs so much that you can hardly
. bear to wear anything else even on special evenings; now there is
no reason why you should. And since we already make button-downs
in 386 fabrics, patterns, and colors it would have been unthoughtful of
us not to make it an even 387 with this button-cuff button-down
of fine broadcloth * You can find it at the best men’s shops although not
always under our label (many stores like our shirts so much they sell
them under their own names). If you’d like to know which in your
vicinity please write us: Eagle Shirtmakers, Quakertown, Pennsylvania.
■"Notice it bulges gracefully at the collar just like the other 386. One time a man, new to our button-downs, wrote
to say that the collar didn't lie flat. When we told Helen Mohr, in Collars, about it she said that she was relieved.
