# Max Rafferty to Evaluate Trends in Education
## 
### 
Dr. Max Rafferty, controversial
Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion of California, will be pre
sented by (he Freshman Class
Ex-Com tomorrow at 4:15 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium. His topic
will be “What’s Wrong with Ed
ucation’’ in which he will discuss
current trends in U.S. education,
especially those in California.
He will give suggestions on how
they might be improved.
His visit should be of particu
lar interest because of his current
verbal battle with California As
sembly Speaker Jesse unruh over
a bill Unruh introduced taking
away Rafferty’s power of ap
pointing a key position in his of
fice.
This is Dr. Rafferty's first ap
pearance at Stanford since his
election to the statewide post
last November. All Stanford stu
dents and faculty, especially
members of the School of Educa
tion, are invited to attend the ad
dress.
Whether one agrees or disa
grees with Dr. Rafferty’s educa
tional philosophy, it cannot be
denied that he represents the
feelings of a great many citizens
in California and throughout the
nation.
