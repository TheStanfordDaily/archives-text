Look at the PACE Solicitor.
Look. Look.
He is an agent of the Plot for Alumni Currency Extortion.
Extort. Extort.
See the pretty green Label pinned on his black-flannel suit;
“Money is the root of all Progress.”
Root. Toot.
See the pretty yellow Label pinned on his striped trousers:
“Gold is the branch-ment of all Advancement.”
Branch. Blanch.
Help keep Stanford Green and Golden.
All he wants is your Money.
All Mortgages and Gold Fillings he also wants.
Sometimes he patiently awaits even your Life Insurance.
And sometimes, not so patiently.
“Rest in PACE, ex-alumni-martyr.”
“An alumni’s born every minute.”
Yesterday a Contributions-Man cornered me.
"Hello, Con-Man,’ said I,
“I’m so very glad to meet you at last.
Here let me shake you hand— .. . —dy pledge card?”
From up his sleeve unrolled the Plot Projects:
Stanford’s First Five-Year Plan.
“To us according to our needs,
From you according to your ability to pay.”
“Commemorate thy name to all history and Stanford.”
Glory. Glory,
And he offered up to me a Great Monument:
"Think,” envisioned he, “of that elegant gold Plaque:
The K W Smith Memorial Physics John.”
Flushed with zeal he showed more Groat Monuments;
The Ira Sandbag Memorial Fall-out Shelter
The Joseph Kennedy Little-White-House President’s
Office
The Peace Vigilers’ Memorial Comfort Station
(Portable)
The Hoover Vacuum Memorial Institute of War, Revo
lution and Depression
“Match the original Endowment—
And we’ll rename the University.”
Ah, dear old Alma Mater.
Dear J. Paul Getty Junior University.
Remember: It is fax', far better to have pledged and gone bank
rupt,
than ner’ to have pledged at all.
“Hear the PACE Plot musical,” he said:
It is called “Pledge-Maily-in.’
Or—“My Fair Wally.”
Hear the agents sing the Theme Song:
“I’m getting Money in the Morning,
Clink, clank the Coins are going to Chime.
Bucks come and kiss me
No pledge will miss me
Get me to the Vault on time.”
Hail the Noble PACE Plot.
Hail the Noble PACE Motto:
“E Pluribus Pecunum”

And he offered up to me a Great Monument:
"Think,” envisioned he, “of that elegant gold Plaque:
The K W Smith Memorial Physics John.”

The Ira Sandbag Memorial Fall-out Shelter
The Joseph Kennedy Little-White-House President’s
Office
The Peace Vigilers’ Memorial Comfort Station
(Portable)
The Hoover Vacuum Memorial Institute of War, Revo
lution and Depression
“Match the original Endowment—

“Hear the PACE Plot musical,” he said:
It is called “Pledge-Maily-in.’
Or—“My Fair Wally.”
Hear the agents sing the Theme Song:
“I’m getting Money in the Morning,
Clink, clank the Coins are going to Chime.
Bucks come and kiss me
No pledge will miss me
Get me to the Vault on time.”
Hail the Noble PACE Plot.
Hail the Noble PACE Motto:
“E Pluribus Pecunum”
(Out of Many, Money)
