# Vigils: 'Students vs. Administration'
## 
### MARK J. GOODMAN 
For the last few days strange things have been happening at
Stanford. Students are disagreeing with the University Admin
istration, and more, seem determined to defend their views even
if it shoidd mean suspension. Only rarely has such distemper
erupted in my four years here; and usually the issue have been
much more concrete, and in their way, much less political. But
the liquor debate, the co-ed housing flurry, the half-cups of
coffee at the union squabble—these are all pretty ancient his
tory. They went out with a wimper: a student wimper. The ad
ministration simply refused to concern itself.
What makes the fallout shelter conflict different is that
students, or better, a very small minority of students, have re
fused to let the issue die. They demand that the University
defend its actions. They protest what seems an unconscionable
exercise of power.
The Daily editorial in Monday’s issue has very neatly
avoided drawing this conclusion. For the editors, the thing has
just got out of hand. Anger in high places, confusion, mis
understanding, have been the villains. It has all been, and re
mains for them, a “fiasco of misunderstanding.” And with a little
common sense, and perhaps the intercession of responsible (care
ful) student opinion, equilibrium may be restored. Equilibrium
and Stanford’s reputation are very dear to them.
But even the editors of The Stanford Daily know that some
issue must lie at the base of the controversy. “Hotheadedness”
explains only the acceleration (or polarization) of the argument;
it does not tell us of its origins. So what is it all about, finally?
For them it seems to be “all about”—information! But is it pos
sible that the Peace Caucus stood out in the rain in front of
Sterling’s house for “information”: that the whole issue resolves
itself into an ordinary problem of public relations and propa
ganda; that the world’s problems can be resolved thru the use
of well-illustrated brochures and gentle music?
The plain facts are that the aggrieved students are not
merely in want of information, and the Administration knows it.
Nor are they merely resentful. ‘Ressentiment’ ends when the
props of authority begin to wither. This, the Administration
also knows: it has rushed in new props. It points to the ulti
mate locus of authority and makes clear, once again, that “no
University policy-making function has been delegated to the
students of Stanford University.” And it has tried to reinforce
the basis of its legitimacy by shabbily recalling to students that,
afterall, ”... in the formulation of policy recommendations
to the Trustees by the President of the University, the Faculty of
the University has extensive participation.” (President Sterling’s
statement, printed April 29).
This whole lino of “argument” on the part of the Adminis
tration has not been accidental. It cannot be explained as con
fusion, miscalculation or misunderstanding. As a matter of fact,
it is quite effective, despite The Daily’s complaints. For it simply
withdraws from debate the central issues, i.e., takes for granted
its conclusions and announces that dispute will not be heard.
It is crucial to understand this. For once we understand it, we
can understand, also, why the whole affair has been negotiated
in the alloy—why the police must deliver the ‘pronunciamento,’
why “liaison officers” must be obtained, why Dean Larimer
must make clear in advance that he speaks without authority
when he offers the most moderate concession.
With this in mind it is not surprising that the Administra
tion should seek an out in the Stanford Today and Tomorrow
program. For here is an institution, not yet old and hoary to be
sure, but an institution bland as the California day. Under its
aegis a real attempt to alter the balance of power—a real at
tempt at dissent—becomes nothing more than a search for dis
interested knowledge. A pleasant chat and things are back to
normal.
But according to latest reports even this proposal has been
vetoed. And here the Administration makes a mistake: it exposes
its own technique. The repression becomes too bald. Even the
moset apolitical students “get mad.” And those genuinely in
terested in the free discussion Stanford so widely advertises
start reading college catalogues.
