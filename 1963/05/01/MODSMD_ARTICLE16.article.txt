Editors, The Daily:
The following letter was delivered to President Sterling
yesterday:
President Sterling:
We, the undersigned members of the Stanford faculty and
professional community, wish to express our opposition to fall
out shelters being placed on the Stanford campus, in view of
the following considerations;
1. A primary responsibility of a university community is to
apply reason, fact and logic to matters of public concern and to
contribute to the clarification and solution of human problems.
2. The development of a fallout shelter program on this
campus implies that the university community believes it to be
a necessary and effective means of protection against a first
strike attack or, more significantly, retaliation.
3. Shelter programs are not a realistic approach to the pos
sibilities of international conflict and, in fact, represent a poten
tially dangerous development, since a public which feels it is
protected is more likely to adopt a permissive attitude toward
the promiscuous use of nuclear W’eapons to attain transient po
litical ends.
4. Even if the concept of a shelter program were acceptable
as public policy, the claim that the proposed Stanford program
in any significant way provides protection against a nuclear
attack is not in keeping with 0191 analysis of the effects of
nuclear war. I" r "
Accordingly, we urge that the administration initiate full
and open discussion of the question of effectiveness and advis
ability of a Stanford fallout shelter program, that it support
the efforts of faculty and students to explore these and related
issues on campus and that it reconsider its decision to adopt a
fallout shelter program as official Stanford policy in the Ugh', of
these discussions.

Editors, The Daily:
A few weeks ago the board of trustees granted Stanford
students the rare privilege of saying what they thought on
matters of current interest. Thursday evening, LASSU did its
part to implement this privilege by denying permission to pub
lish, by an overwhelming voice vote, to a new magazine which
would have given students the means to express themselves on
matters of current interest in a manner that has not been pos
sible to date. The magazine was to be called The Bridge, and its
intention was to publish student-written articles on all aspects
of international affairs. No campus publication presently en
gages in publishing such articles, and now that the proposed
Bridge has been rejected, none is forthcoming.
All this would at least have been forgivable, had the legis
lature come to its decision after cool and rational consideration
of the issue. But here is how the measure was considered. Mem
bers of the legislature, arriving at the meeting uninformed as to
the agenda, found to their surprise that they were to discuss
giving funds to The Bridge. Discussion was devoted almost en
tirely to arguments against. Fred Nelson, student financial man
ager, said similar magazines under the same name had failed in
the past, and therefore The Bridge couldn’t be expected to suc
ceed now. Someone from the Publications Board got up and said
that, well, they’ll never get it finished in time to publish this
quarter, and besides, even if they do, it will be competing with
the Chappie and the Sequoia and therefore the Chappie and the
Sequoia couldn’t permit it. And also The Bridge would be taking
away the Chappie’s and the Sequoia’s advertisers, and the good
people from the Publications Board couldn’t permit that either.
Scott Thompson spoke briefly in favor of The Bridge, saying
that if it wasn't permitted to come out this quarter then it would
never come out. By this time Legislature was getting restless
and voted to choke off debate, thereby cutting off several people
who had been trying through most of the debate to speak in
the affirmative. LASSU then killed the measure.
From all this I conclude that the enemies of The Bridge op
posed the magazine largely from motives of selfishness and
fear of novelty, and that LASSU voted down The Bridge largely
because it did not trouble to hear out both sides of the question
fully. The whole affair casts grave doubt on the integrity of the
Publications Board and on LASSU's sense of responsibility. This
is a far cry from the vision of student intelligence and clear
sightedness the trustees had in mind last month when they
granted students the hopefully precious right to speak out on
public issues.
