# Sino-Soviet Conflict Product of Many Years' Interplay
## 
### WILLIAM B. QUANDT IIR Political Analyst 
Although divisive elements had
existed within the Sino-Soviet al
liance previous to the 20th Con

gress of the CPSU, it was pri
marily after Februax-y 1956, that
the conflict began to appear in
its present form. Now that Pe
king and Moscow have publicly

aired their disagreements, it is
well to examine some of the rea
sons for this dramatic develop
ment. Some differences between
China and Russia can be traced
to their unequal economic devel
opment, others to contrasting
evaluations of the “current situ
ation.” Many observers have
pointed to long-standing issues,
such as the conflicting claims
over territory on China’s north
ern frontier. Supposedly “realis
tic” analysts see the current de
bate as merely a phase in a more
profound power struggle. While
there may be some validity in
each of these interpretations,
none Is complete without a recog
nition of the many factors, fused
together by a revolutionary ide
ology, which work concurrently
to bind and to divide the two
great communist nations. In or
der to understand the subtle in
terplay between ideology and
power in Sino-Soviet relations
we must turn to the startling
events of the past few years.
For some time China had been
cautiously exploring the possi
bilities of loosening control of her
intellectuals, so when in Febru
ary 1937 Mao announced a liber
alization campaign under the title
of “Let one hundred flowers
bloom, let one hundred schools of
thought contend,” many were
quick to conclude that China had
become the most liberal member
of the communist bloc. By June,
however, it was patently clear
that Mao had overestimated the
unity of his regime, for criticism
had come forth with unexpected
virulence, and the only way to
meet it was to reimpose party
control. From June to December,
China and the Soviet Union
seemed to switch roles, China ar
guing for greater bloc centraliza
tion and a more aggressive policy
toward the West, while Russia
advocated pluralism and peaceful
coexistence.
During this period of change
the Soviet Union made a major
breakthrough in weapons tech
nology by launching her first
ICBM. Mao was eager to conclude
from this that a new phase in
world history had begun, a phase
in which “the East wind prevails
over the West wind.”
China, in 1958, announced the
"Great Leap Forward,” a con
certed effort to raise her standard
of living overnight. During the
month of August the movement
of peasants into communes began
and was completed in an incredi
bly short time. Accompanying
this profound social change was
a new doctrine entitled “sprouts
of communism.” China, it was as
serted, was beginning .to pass
over into the stage of pure com
munism, an ideological position
never before taken. Moscow, still
in its “socialist” phase, observed
an ominous silence toward this
heresy. Fortunately for bloc re
lations, Peking withdrew her
claim in December 1958.
At the 21st Congress of the
CPSU in January 1959, Khru
shchev set forth his policy on nu
clear war. So dire had the conse
quences of nuclear war become
that it must be avoided. No one
could possibly win such a war.
Furthermore, the USSR was
strong enough to deter any ag
gression. She was also strong
enough to win the struggle with
capitalism by means short of
war.
China did not see things in the
same light. Men, not weapons,
were the decisive elements in
warfare. China had nothing to
fear from a nuclear war, for she
could lose half her population
and still be the largest country in
the world.

prochement late in 1959 further
Strained relations between Pe
king and Moscow. In September
of that year Tass published its

first overt criticism of Chinese
policy concerning the Sino-Indian
border dispute. Concurrently, the
old Roy-Lenin debate over revo
lutionary tactics reappeared,
Khrushchev favoring support of
"bourgeois nationalists,” Mao in
sisting upon the seizure of heg
emony by the proletariat through
the Communist Party. Liu Shao
ch’i subtly recalled how the
“right opportunists” during the
1920’s in China had made the cru
cial error of “capitulation" to the
bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao had
fortunately rectified this error.
Debate has continued during
the past few years, reaching at
times such an intensity that ob
servers have confidently predict
ed a split between the communist
giants. We must seriously con
sider whether or not China is
more of a threat within or with
out the bloc. No simple answers
exist, however, for our ability to
project into the future is limited.
But new approaches must be
taken, for the West has wasted
too many years already simply
reacting to cleverly manipulated
crises. It is now time for us to
adopt creative, visible policies
which recognize both the oppor
tunities and the threats posed by
the current Sino-Soviet conflict.

For some time China had been
cautiously exploring the possi
bilities of loosening control of her
intellectuals, so when in Febru
ary 1937 Mao announced a liber
alization campaign under the title
of “Let one hundred flowers
bloom, let one hundred schools of
thought contend,” many were
quick to conclude that China had
become the most liberal member
of the communist bloc. By June,
however, it was patently clear
that Mao had overestimated the
unity of his regime, for criticism
had come forth with unexpected
virulence, and the only way to
meet it was to reimpose party
control. From June to December,
China and the Soviet Union
seemed to switch roles, China ar
guing for greater bloc centraliza
tion and a more aggressive policy
toward the West, while Russia
advocated pluralism and peaceful
coexistence.
During this period of change
the Soviet Union made a major
breakthrough in weapons tech
nology by launching her first
ICBM. Mao was eager to conclude
from this that a new phase in
world history had begun, a phase
in which “the East wind prevails
over the West wind.”
China, in 1958, announced the
"Great Leap Forward,” a con
certed effort to raise her standard
of living overnight. During the
month of August the movement
of peasants into communes began
and was completed in an incredi
bly short time. Accompanying
this profound social change was
a new doctrine entitled “sprouts
of communism.” China, it was as
serted, was beginning .to pass
over into the stage of pure com
munism, an ideological position
never before taken. Moscow, still
in its “socialist” phase, observed
an ominous silence toward this
heresy. Fortunately for bloc re
lations, Peking withdrew her
claim in December 1958.
At the 21st Congress of the
CPSU in January 1959, Khru
shchev set forth his policy on nu
clear war. So dire had the conse
quences of nuclear war become
that it must be avoided. No one
could possibly win such a war.
Furthermore, the USSR was
strong enough to deter any ag
gression. She was also strong
enough to win the struggle with
capitalism by means short of
war.
China did not see things in the
same light. Men, not weapons,
were the decisive elements in
warfare. China had nothing to
fear from a nuclear war, for she
could lose half her population
and still be the largest country in
the world.

prochement late in 1959 further
Strained relations between Pe
king and Moscow. In September
of that year Tass published its

first overt criticism of Chinese
policy concerning the Sino-Indian
border dispute. Concurrently, the
old Roy-Lenin debate over revo
lutionary tactics reappeared,
Khrushchev favoring support of
"bourgeois nationalists,” Mao in
sisting upon the seizure of heg
emony by the proletariat through
the Communist Party. Liu Shao
ch’i subtly recalled how the
“right opportunists” during the
1920’s in China had made the cru
cial error of “capitulation" to the
bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao had
fortunately rectified this error.
Debate has continued during
the past few years, reaching at
times such an intensity that ob
servers have confidently predict
ed a split between the communist
giants. We must seriously con
sider whether or not China is
more of a threat within or with
out the bloc. No simple answers
exist, however, for our ability to
project into the future is limited.
But new approaches must be
taken, for the West has wasted
too many years already simply
reacting to cleverly manipulated
crises. It is now time for us to
adopt creative, visible policies
which recognize both the oppor
tunities and the threats posed by
the current Sino-Soviet conflict.
Although divisive elements had
existed within the Sino-Soviet al
liance previous to the 20th Con

gress of the CPSU, it was pri
marily after Februax-y 1956, that
the conflict began to appear in
its present form. Now that Pe
king and Moscow have publicly

aired their disagreements, it is
well to examine some of the rea
sons for this dramatic develop
ment. Some differences between
China and Russia can be traced
to their unequal economic devel
opment, others to contrasting
evaluations of the “current situ
ation.” Many observers have
pointed to long-standing issues,
such as the conflicting claims
over territory on China’s north
ern frontier. Supposedly “realis
tic” analysts see the current de
bate as merely a phase in a more
profound power struggle. While
there may be some validity in
each of these interpretations,
none Is complete without a recog
nition of the many factors, fused
together by a revolutionary ide
ology, which work concurrently
to bind and to divide the two
great communist nations. In or

terplay between ideology and

Although divisive elements had
existed within the Sino-Soviet al
liance previous to the 20th Con

gress of the CPSU, it was pri
marily after Februax-y 1956, that
the conflict began to appear in
its present form. Now that Pe
king and Moscow have publicly

aired their disagreements, it is
well to examine some of the rea
sons for this dramatic develop
ment. Some differences between
China and Russia can be traced
to their unequal economic devel
opment, others to contrasting
evaluations of the “current situ
ation.” Many observers have
pointed to long-standing issues,
such as the conflicting claims
over territory on China’s north
ern frontier. Supposedly “realis
tic” analysts see the current de
bate as merely a phase in a more
profound power struggle. While
there may be some validity in
each of these interpretations,
none Is complete without a recog
nition of the many factors, fused
together by a revolutionary ide
ology, which work concurrently
to bind and to divide the two
great communist nations. In or
der to understand the subtle in
terplay between ideology and
power in Sino-Soviet relations
we must turn to the startling
events of the past few years.
For some time China had been
cautiously exploring the possi
bilities of loosening control of her
intellectuals, so when in Febru
ary 1937 Mao announced a liber
alization campaign under the title
of “Let one hundred flowers
bloom, let one hundred schools of
thought contend,” many were
quick to conclude that China had
become the most liberal member
of the communist bloc. By June,
however, it was patently clear
that Mao had overestimated the
unity of his regime, for criticism
had come forth with unexpected
virulence, and the only way to
meet it was to reimpose party
control. From June to December,
China and the Soviet Union
seemed to switch roles, China ar
guing for greater bloc centraliza
tion and a more aggressive policy
toward the West, while Russia
advocated pluralism and peaceful
coexistence.
During this period of change
the Soviet Union made a major
breakthrough in weapons tech
nology by launching her first
ICBM. Mao was eager to conclude
from this that a new phase in
world history had begun, a phase
in which “the East wind prevails
over the West wind.”
China, in 1958, announced the
"Great Leap Forward,” a con
certed effort to raise her standard
of living overnight. During the
month of August the movement
of peasants into communes began
and was completed in an incredi
bly short time. Accompanying
this profound social change was
a new doctrine entitled “sprouts
of communism.” China, it was as

munism, an ideological position
