# PEACE CORPS LETTER
## Peace Corps in Ethiopia 
### CAROLYN WOOD 
(Editors’ note: Miss Wood, a Stanford graduate in history, wrote
this letter to a friend at Stanford about her life as a Peace Corps
Volunteer in Asmara, Ethiopia.)
... 1 am teaching English at Prince Makonnen Secondary
School in Asmara, undoubtedly, the nicest city in Ethiopia. As
mara is quite a city. It is part African and part European. The
area was ruled by the Italians from 1890 to 1945, and the build
ings look very European. The majority of the city, however, is

definitely African in living stan--t
dards. There are not many Itali
ans left today—a mere 5,000 com
pared to the former 200,000.
The city is full of very differ
ent people. You see everything
on the street from veiled Moslem
women, wild, wild-looking bush
men with dung in their hair,
barefoot native women selling
eggs and nursing their baby at
the same time, to the most chic
Italian girls who look straight
out of a fashion magazine. Then,
of course, there is the Peace
Corps who sticks out somehow.
I don’t know if it is our looks,
dress, or bicycle, but everyone
knows who we are.
This city is the perfect place
to learn languages. Almost every
thing is spoken by someone here.
Most of the people here can speak
a good amount of Italian, Tigren
ian (the language of the people
here—for which we were not
trained at all because they did
not know who would be sent
here), Amharic (the language of
Ethiopia), Arabic, and English.
Our school here has nothing, a
few classrooms, and that is all—
not enough books to go around,
not enough supplies, no extras at
all. The Peace Corps is doing a
lot at our school. The Volunteers
do all of the extra curricular ac
tivities. We have started a home
economics class, school news
paper, science club, drama club,
gardening club, future business
leaders club, model UN, and de
bating society. Besides teaching,
I am the school librarian (the li
brary was a total wreck when we
came), the guidance counselor,
the sponsor of the newspaper,
and the nurse.
For Easter, we hope to go to
Gonda, site of the ancient castles
of Ethiopia, then take a boat
across Lake Tana to Bahar Dar
la new city), and then take a

mule trip to the famous water
falls of the Blue Nile. All in all,
this has ben the most interesting
seven months of my life.

a good amount of Italian, Tigren
ian (the language of the people
here—for which we were not
trained at all because they did
not know who would be sent
here), Amharic (the language of
Ethiopia), Arabic, and English.
Our school here has nothing, a
few classrooms, and that is all—
not enough books to go around,
not enough supplies, no extras at
all. The Peace Corps is doing a
lot at our school. The Volunteers
do all of the extra curricular ac
tivities. We have started a home
economics class, school news
paper, science club, drama club,
gardening club, future business
leaders club, model UN, and de
bating society. Besides teaching,
I am the school librarian (the li
brary was a total wreck when we
came), the guidance counselor,
the sponsor of the newspaper,
and the nurse.
For Easter, we hope to go to
Gonda, site of the ancient castles
of Ethiopia, then take a boat
across Lake Tana to Bahar Dar
la new city), and then take a

mule trip to the famous water
falls of the Blue Nile. All in all,
this has ben the most interesting
seven months of my life.
(Editors’ note: Miss Wood, a Stanford graduate in history, wrote
this letter to a friend at Stanford about her life as a Peace Corps
Volunteer in Asmara, Ethiopia.)
... 1 am teaching English at Prince Makonnen Secondary
School in Asmara, undoubtedly, the nicest city in Ethiopia. As
mara is quite a city. It is part African and part European. The
area was ruled by the Italians from 1890 to 1945, and the build
ings look very European. The majority of the city, however, is

definitely African in living stan--t
dards. There are not many Itali
ans left today—a mere 5,000 com
pared to the former 200,000.
The city is full of very differ
ent people. You see everything
on the street from veiled Moslem
women, wild, wild-looking bush
men with dung in their hair,
barefoot native women selling
eggs and nursing their baby at
the same time, to the most chic
Italian girls who look straight
out of a fashion magazine. Then,
of course, there is the Peace
Corps who sticks out somehow.
I don’t know if it is our looks,
dress, or bicycle, but everyone
knows who we are.
This city is the perfect place
to learn languages. Almost every
thing is spoken by someone here.
Most of the people here can speak
a good amount of Italian, Tigren
ian (the language of the people
here—for which we were not
trained at all because they did
not know who would be sent
here), Amharic (the language of
Ethiopia), Arabic, and English.
