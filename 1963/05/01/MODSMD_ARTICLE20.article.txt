# Bearded Men Head for Hills With Geology Tools in Hand
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD 
,Equipped with food, water, a compass, a
sample bag, note paper and pad, a field
microscope, and a few portable surveying
instruments, the poorly shaved young men
set out into the unmapped hills. Alas, these
men are not the remnants of the Louis and
Clark expedition, for instead of wearing
leather breeches and coonskin hats, they
sport levis and Stanford sweaters.
These students are geology majors taking
a course that one professor called "sophisti
cated lab work,” and one of the students
termed “an interesting but isolated grind.”
The course in question is the 15-unit summer
field trip that is required for all geology ma
jors. It takes ten weeks of the student’s
time; four weeks at each of two different
camps, and two weeks back at Stanford writ
a summary report.
LAST SUMMER, Professor Robert Comp
ton of the Geology Department took 15 stu
dents to the San Lucia Range, northwest of
King City, and then to a part of the Sierra
Nevada Range 20 miles west of Dormer
Summit. At each of the two areas, there was
a base camp with large Army surplus tents,

stoves, lanterns, cots, a cook, and other com
forts. During their stay, the students drew
geological maps of the surrounding area.
A typical day’s work entailed the follow
ing: up at six, breakfast, split up into pairs
or groups of three and take a truck out to
the assigned area, spend the rest of the day
mapping formations and structures, return
to camp at five, eat, and then re-copy the
work of the day in ink. At the end of each
week, a pair will usually have covered an
area of 3-6 square miles. At that time, the
gi’oups are shuffled and new areas are as
signed. In this manner, between 60-100
square miles are comprehensively mapped
in each of the month-long sessions.
The only piece of equipment that is always
necessary for mapping, aside from pencil
and pad, is a Brunton compass. According
to Professor William Dickinson of the
Geology Department, who is heading this
summer’s foray into the Pine Mountain area
and thence into the Sweetwater Range, this
50 dollar instrument is a field geologist’s
“third arm.” Therefore, most students buy
their own and use it the rest of their life. In
areas where students have to do surveying
as well as mapping, triangulation instru
ments, tape and chain are supplied to them.
After spending two months in the field,
the students return to the University for two
week of writing. Each student has covered
four areas himself. Also he is given copies
of the summary reports that each group has
written at the end of each week’s work. With
this massive pile before him, he begins to
work, and within two weeks has turned out
a comprehensive descriptive report.
THESE REPORTS are not written and for
gotten. The areas covered have been specifi
cally chosen because they wore unmapped
or sketchily mapped. Thus, no Stanford sum
mer class ever returns to a previously visited
place. “Early Stanford field classes shaped
up large chunks of California,” commented
Compton, “and the current summer classes
are continuing this work.” The maps that
have been drawn are used by interested com
panies as well as the U.S. Geoloical Associa
tion.
Another bonus from the trips, aside from
the valuable maps, is the many new fossils
that the students find. These are added to
the Department’s already large collection.
While in the field, most of the work is
done by the students themselves although
the professor and the two TA’s accompany
the group in rotation. “This course does a
good job of training geologists,” said Comp
ton, “and although it is not as luxurious as
many college programs of its type—indeed,
the areas are sometime quite dismal the
follows find out whether they like field
geology or not. That is the most important
thing they learn in these sessions.”


THREE STANFORD GEOLOGISTS take time out from lithology and stratigraphy to tend
to the less complicated task of washing the dishes. They are modeling the latest
fashions in summer field trip wear, including the over-grown goatee, which all
geologists left in the wilderness for two months generally find expedient at some
time or other. Aside from beards, the geologists pick up many other objects in their
two month sojourn; objects such as fossils, both recent and ancient, and 15 units
of required credit.

area of 3-6 square miles. At that time, the
gi’oups are shuffled and new areas are as
signed. In this manner, between 60-100
square miles are comprehensively mapped
in each of the month-long sessions.
The only piece of equipment that is always
necessary for mapping, aside from pencil
and pad, is a Brunton compass. According
to Professor William Dickinson of the
Geology Department, who is heading this
summer’s foray into the Pine Mountain area
and thence into the Sweetwater Range, this
50 dollar instrument is a field geologist’s
“third arm.” Therefore, most students buy
their own and use it the rest of their life. In
areas where students have to do surveying
as well as mapping, triangulation instru
ments, tape and chain are supplied to them.
After spending two months in the field,
the students return to the University for two
week of writing. Each student has covered
four areas himself. Also he is given copies
of the summary reports that each group has
written at the end of each week’s work. With
this massive pile before him, he begins to
work, and within two weeks has turned out
a comprehensive descriptive report.
THESE REPORTS are not written and for
gotten. The areas covered have been specifi
cally chosen because they wore unmapped
or sketchily mapped. Thus, no Stanford sum
mer class ever returns to a previously visited
place. “Early Stanford field classes shaped
up large chunks of California,” commented
Compton, “and the current summer classes
are continuing this work.” The maps that
have been drawn are used by interested com
panies as well as the U.S. Geoloical Associa
tion.
Another bonus from the trips, aside from
the valuable maps, is the many new fossils
that the students find. These are added to
the Department’s already large collection.
While in the field, most of the work is
done by the students themselves although
the professor and the two TA’s accompany
the group in rotation. “This course does a
good job of training geologists,” said Comp
ton, “and although it is not as luxurious as
many college programs of its type—indeed,
the areas are sometime quite dismal the
follows find out whether they like field
geology or not. That is the most important
thing they learn in these sessions.”


THREE STANFORD GEOLOGISTS take time out from lithology and stratigraphy to tend
to the less complicated task of washing the dishes. They are modeling the latest
fashions in summer field trip wear, including the over-grown goatee, which all
geologists left in the wilderness for two months generally find expedient at some
time or other. Aside from beards, the geologists pick up many other objects in their
two month sojourn; objects such as fossils, both recent and ancient, and 15 units
of required credit.
,Equipped with food, water, a compass, a
sample bag, note paper and pad, a field
microscope, and a few portable surveying
instruments, the poorly shaved young men
set out into the unmapped hills. Alas, these
men are not the remnants of the Louis and
Clark expedition, for instead of wearing
leather breeches and coonskin hats, they
sport levis and Stanford sweaters.
These students are geology majors taking
a course that one professor called "sophisti
cated lab work,” and one of the students
termed “an interesting but isolated grind.”
The course in question is the 15-unit summer
field trip that is required for all geology ma
jors. It takes ten weeks of the student’s
time; four weeks at each of two different
camps, and two weeks back at Stanford writ
a summary report.
LAST SUMMER, Professor Robert Comp
ton of the Geology Department took 15 stu
dents to the San Lucia Range, northwest of
King City, and then to a part of the Sierra
Nevada Range 20 miles west of Dormer
Summit. At each of the two areas, there was
a base camp with large Army surplus tents,

stoves, lanterns, cots, a cook, and other com
forts. During their stay, the students drew
geological maps of the surrounding area.
A typical day’s work entailed the follow
ing: up at six, breakfast, split up into pairs
or groups of three and take a truck out to
the assigned area, spend the rest of the day
mapping formations and structures, return
to camp at five, eat, and then re-copy the
work of the day in ink. At the end of each
week, a pair will usually have covered an
area of 3-6 square miles. At that time, the
gi’oups are shuffled and new areas are as
signed. In this manner, between 60-100
square miles are comprehensively mapped
in each of the month-long sessions.
