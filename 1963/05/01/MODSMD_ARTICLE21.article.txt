# Marine Lab Offers Floating Classroom
## 
### MARSHA ROOD 
With its “Te Vega,” a “floating class
room,” Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station
is one of the most unique and outstanding
marine stations in the country. It was the
first marine laboratory on the American Pa
cific Coast and the third in the United States.
Through the generous co-operation of Tim
othy Hopkins, a suitable site and a sum of
money sufficient to erect the first building
(in 1892) were donated.
The buildings, situated on the otherwise
deserted point on the southern side of Mon
terey Bay, are small and plain. One is a gray
concrete structure, and the other is of sand
stone with a red tile roof. Inside, they are
the scones of much research, experimenta
tion and instruction in marine biology, plant
physiology and related subjects.
The station, staffed by five Stanford fac
ulty members headed by Dr. Lawrence
Binks, offers its facilities for research and
instruction to Stanford undergraduates and
graduates, and to students and scientists
throughout the world. Studies at the station,
which emphasizes marine biology r-ather
than physicochemical oceanography, are
taught on a permanent year-round basis.
THE STATION IS equipped with a 40-
foot oceanography boat, “Tage,” available
for collecting in offshore waters, and a
“Marinostat” facility for controlled-environ
ment studies of marine plants and animals.
The most outstanding feature of the sta
tion is the “Te Vega,” Stanford’s sea-going
biology project. This unique operation of the
Hopkins Marine Station is supported by
grants totaling more than $700,000 from the
National Science Foundation. The 135-foot
vessel, under the direction of Professor Rolf
Bolin, makes three 11-week cruises through
out the Pacific and Indian Oceans at times
roughly corresponding to academic quarters
at Stanford.
These cruises provide graduate training
in biological oceanography for approximate
ly 12 students and yield 15 quarter-units of
graduate credit. Normally the cruises are
open to men only, but occasional coeduca
tional cruises are planned. In the summer,
students from institutions all over the coun
try take advantage of the opportunities of
fered by the Te Vega for sampling organ
isms and determining the physical and
chemical characteristics of the water. Lec
tures supplement the daily laboratory work.
NEW THIS SPRING at the Hopkins Ma
rine Station is a 15-unit program open to
undergraduates. A Stanford student in his
senior year is now able to participate in a
program of concentrated marine biology.
Summing up the worth of the station as
part of the academic career of a student in
oceanography, Dr. Victory C. Twitty, head
of the Stanford biology department, stated,
“It gives the student a rare opportunity to
live and work with living organisms in their
natural habitat rather than in the labora
tory. Students are most enthusiastic about
the program as a pleasant and stimulating
academic experience.”

physiology and related subjects.
The station, staffed by five Stanford fac
ulty members headed by Dr. Lawrence
Binks, offers its facilities for research and
instruction to Stanford undergraduates and
graduates, and to students and scientists
throughout the world. Studies at the station,
which emphasizes marine biology r-ather
than physicochemical oceanography, are
taught on a permanent year-round basis.
THE STATION IS equipped with a 40-
foot oceanography boat, “Tage,” available
for collecting in offshore waters, and a
“Marinostat” facility for controlled-environ
ment studies of marine plants and animals.
The most outstanding feature of the sta
tion is the “Te Vega,” Stanford’s sea-going
biology project. This unique operation of the
Hopkins Marine Station is supported by
grants totaling more than $700,000 from the
National Science Foundation. The 135-foot
vessel, under the direction of Professor Rolf
Bolin, makes three 11-week cruises through
out the Pacific and Indian Oceans at times
roughly corresponding to academic quarters
at Stanford.
These cruises provide graduate training
in biological oceanography for approximate
ly 12 students and yield 15 quarter-units of
graduate credit. Normally the cruises are
open to men only, but occasional coeduca
tional cruises are planned. In the summer,
students from institutions all over the coun
try take advantage of the opportunities of
fered by the Te Vega for sampling organ
isms and determining the physical and
chemical characteristics of the water. Lec
tures supplement the daily laboratory work.
NEW THIS SPRING at the Hopkins Ma
rine Station is a 15-unit program open to
undergraduates. A Stanford student in his
senior year is now able to participate in a
program of concentrated marine biology.
Summing up the worth of the station as
part of the academic career of a student in
oceanography, Dr. Victory C. Twitty, head
of the Stanford biology department, stated,
“It gives the student a rare opportunity to
live and work with living organisms in their
natural habitat rather than in the labora
tory. Students are most enthusiastic about
the program as a pleasant and stimulating
academic experience.”
With its “Te Vega,” a “floating class
room,” Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station
is one of the most unique and outstanding
marine stations in the country. It was the
first marine laboratory on the American Pa
cific Coast and the third in the United States.
Through the generous co-operation of Tim
othy Hopkins, a suitable site and a sum of
money sufficient to erect the first building
(in 1892) were donated.
The buildings, situated on the otherwise
deserted point on the southern side of Mon
terey Bay, are small and plain. One is a gray
concrete structure, and the other is of sand
stone with a red tile roof. Inside, they are
the scones of much research, experimenta
tion and instruction in marine biology, plant
physiology and related subjects.
