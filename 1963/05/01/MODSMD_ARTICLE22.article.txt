# Population Bio Program Studies Plants, Animals

### VIVIAN LEE 
What happens when scientists from sev
eral different fields of a science pool their
efforts in an integrated study of a problem?
The population biology program is just such
an experiment. The National Institutes of
Health have invested a quarter of a million
dollars in Stanford’s unusual program, the
first of its kind to be attempted on so broad
a scale.
Students of ecology (plants and animals
studied in relation to their environments),
taxonomy (the classification of organisms),
population genetics, population dynamics,
behavior and psychology, are integrating
their varied studies in population biology
research. Instead of studying individual or
ganisms, the population biologists are in
terested in “all groups of organisms and
all organisms in groups,” explains Dr. Paul
R. Ehrlich, associate professor of biology.
They are curious about the ways plants and
animals influence each others populations,
and about the relation of populations to their
environments.
WHAT ARE SOME OF the problems
studied in population biology? The present
method of division of organisms into classes
(taxonomy) is one problem. The rigid hier
archic structure of taxonomic categories,
which requires that all organisms be arbi
trarily assigned to some level (species, sub
species, etc.) by a complex system of guess
work, may need revision, suggests Ehrlich,
to permit more accurate and thus more use
ful description of the intricate relationships
among these organisms.

Taxonomists have assumed in the past
that systems of relationships based on char
acteristics of adults will hold true for char
acteristics of immature individuals. Using
new methods, scientists may differentiate be
tween adult butterfly taxonomy and pupal
butterfly neuro-taxonomy (butterflies in
larval stages, classified according to differ
ences in the structure of their nervous sys
tems). The neuro-anatomist, the entimolo
gist, the taxonomist, and the behaviorist
may all lend their knowledge to the construc
tion of a better taxonomy.
Mathematicians, too, may contribute to
population biology studies. Computers are
indispensable to such methods of research.
Quantitative analysis of similarities and
variations among different organisms, when
graphed on a scale, may suggest more logi
cal relationships among them. In a pilot
study of the classification of individual but
terflies, based on their similarities, Ehrlich’s
computation of 3601 correlation coefficients
took 0 minutes, cost a total of about $23.00.
“The same computations on a desk calcu
lator would take a competent operator about
two years of full-time work,” he says.
ANOTHER PROBLEM under study in the
program is the interrelationship of organ
isms with their environment. Why do hun
dreds of species of butterflies of one family
eat only grasses, while a single species of
another butterfly group will eat plants of
many different families? Does this suggest
a tie-in between the evolution and variation
of grasses along with the variation of but
terflies? How easily can butterflies adapt to
new types of plants if their accustomed food
source is changed? Perhaps the general the
ory of evolution as accepted today wdll have
to be revised with new findings.
What are some of the specific areas bi
ologists at Stanford are now studying under
the population biology program? Dr. Peter
H. Raven and Dr. John H. Thomas are work
ing on the taxonomy of flowering plants,
with special emphasis on plant geography.
Raven and Dr. Richard W. Holm are ana
lyzing the interaction of plants and insects,
and the mechanics of pollination. In this
same field Ehrlich and Raven examine but
terflies as a group interacting with plants as
a group. Ehrlich is particularly interested in
the dynamics and genetics of a local popu
lation of a checker-spot butterfly.
Professor George S. Myers does research
work on fish taxonomy and zoogeography.
He used Stanford’s collection of preserved
fishes, one of the largest and most varied
collections in the world. Started by David
Starr Jordan, former Stanford president, it
contains over one million specimens. In her
petology, Dr. Alan E. Leviton is analyzing
the biochemistry of the venom and blood of
reptiles and amphibians, as a possible basis
for taxonomic studies.
PROFESSOR V. C. TWITTY, chairman of
the Department of Biological Sciences, has
largely given up his previous work in em
bryology (for which he was elected to the
National Academy of Sciences) in order to
investigate the amazing homing ability of a
California newt.
Cytogenetics—heredity studied on a cel
lular level—is the subject of Raven’s re
search on the cytogenetics of the Onogra
ceae. This plant family includes the evening
primrose, the flower examined by the Dutch
botanist, De Vries, in the work behind his
proposal of the mutation theory of evolu
tion around the turn of the century.
Where is this research carried on? Stan
ford biologists are proud of their outdoor
laboratory, Jasper Ridge, where much of the
field work for population biology is con
ducted. It is one of the few examples of a
biological preserve in close proximity to a
university campus in this country. This 735-
acre experimental area adjoining Searsville
Lake, about 6 miles from campus, permits
biologists to perform long-range research
programs without fear of having their work
destroyed by development, grazing, pesticide
treatment, and such.
JASPER RIDGE IS extraordinary be
cause it offers so many different types of
vegetation and their associated animal forms
in a concentrated area, and is thus an ideal
laboratory for a diversified department of
biology, and for studies of the interactions
of organisms in varied environments. It is
used for class field trips, the research train
ing of graduate students, and as a source of
living organisms for laboratory study.
The population biologists emphasize the
importance of the area for the preservation
of the natural topography and biology of
the San Francisco Peninsula amid the popu
lation increase and development of the Bay
region. Jasper Ridge is an irreplacable re
source.
