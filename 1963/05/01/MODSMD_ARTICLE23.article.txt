In Ihc summer of 19(16 a beam of electrons
about the size of a dime in cross-section will
issue from the most expensive pipe ever
built. At a cost of $ll4 million of Federal
money, the Stanford linear accelerator, the
largest of its type over planned, will he con
structed of 10,000 feet of copper pipe. Its
beam energy of between 10 and 20 billion
electron volts will make it the most power
ful electron accelerator in the world. Di
rected by Dr. Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky,
Stanford physics professor, the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center will be staffed by
730 scientists, engineers, and technicians who
will operate the two-mile accelerator day
and night to exploit its maximum efficiency.
The accelerator is intended for one pur
pose the production of a beam of high
energy electrons that can be used to study
the basic constituents of all matter. To most
physicists the accelerator itself is of sec
ondary interest. It is for them an expensive
cannon which will spew out particles for
conducting experiments.
Five main areas of experimentation are
presently planned. The first of these is in
vestigation of the processes in which short
lived particles are produced. These particles
appeal- only when atomic nuclei! are bom
barded by high-energy radiation, such as a
stream of electrons.
SECONDLY. TIIF ELECTRON beam will
he bounced off of sub-nuclear particles such
as protons. By studying the paths of the re
bounding electrons, new information can be
discovered about these particles and the
forces that act between them. Thirdly, the
electron beam can be used to create beams of
other particles, such as mesons and "strange”
particles, which will then be used in experi
ments.
A fourth use of the accelerator will be to
test Ihc validity of the laws of electromag
net ism in small regions. It is of great inter
est to scientists whether these laws remain
valid at distances that arc smaller than
atomic nuclei! (.000000000001 cm.).
Finally attempts may he made to discover
new kinds of elementary particles. The
scientists who are planning for the eventual
use of the two-mile accelerator say that it
wouldn’t be surprising if some of the most
important experiments turn out to be ones
that are not even imagined now. It may
seem strange to build an accelerator whose
exact future uses cannot be predicted, but
there would be little purpose in constructing
a machine if we already knew all the results
to expect.
Tin: ACCELERATOR i s essentially a long
copper pipe, four inches in diameter. A de
vise similar to the “electron gun” in a tele
vision tube shoots electrons into one end of
this pipe. A high frequency radio wave car
ries the electrons along, accelerating them
to very nearly the speed of light. After ac
celeration the electron’s mass has increased,
by Einstein’s laws, to 40,000 times its rest
mass.
There will be a power station every ten
feet along the pipe to boost the electron’s
energy. For every four of these stations
there will be one “klystron” tube. This is
the special tube that was invented at Stan
ford by the Varian brothers. If ever neces
sary, the energy of (ho accelerator could bo
doubled by putting one klystron tube at each
power station.
The accelerator pipe will be buried in a
concrete housing under 25 feet of earth.
This is the simplest and cheapest method
of shielding the laboratory personnel from
radiation generated inside the pipe. A kly
stron gallery is being built above the earthen
shield to house the klystrons and other
electronic equipment necessary for operation
of the accelerator.
The accelerator is designed to run con
tinuously for periods of weeks or oven
months. Occasionally it may bo necessary to
shut the machine off so that adjustments can
be made in the underground housing.
THE ACCELERATOR starts near the
junction of Sand Hill and Woodside Roads
and runs between Sand Hill Road and Alpine
Road towards campus. After full accelera
tion, a series of magnets can be used to de
flect (he electron beam to any one of several
experimentation areas. In this way. it will
be possible to carry on several experiments
at once.
The Atomic Energy Commission provides
all the financial support for (he project. The
“Monster,” as its designers occasionally call
it. will cost $l5 to $2O million dollars yearly
to operate. Each of its 240 klystron tubes
will cost several thousand dollars and it is
possible that 2 or 3 klystrons will have to
be replaced or repaired daily. Thus main
tenance of the klystrons alone could cost as
much as the electric power to run the Mon
ster.
FT AC \\ ill be a national facility , to be used

for experiments by all U.S. physicists ac
cording to the significance of their projects.
WHO WILL DECIDE which experiments
have precedence? The Director, now Dr.
Panofsky, will determine the experimental
program, and this program will be reviewed
periodically by the members of the SLAC
Scientific Policy Committee, a hoard of 10
to 12 eminent physicists from throughout
the U.S. The Committee will provide guar
antee that the most worthwhile experiments
are performed, regardless of who proposes
them.
Although quite separate from Stanford in
its administrative functions, SLAC will
maintain strong scientific ties with the Uni
versity, Its location on the campus should
be advantageous to SLAC in attracting
scientists, and because of the stimulation
provided by an active academic community.
For every physicist on the staff there will
be about eight supporting workers - engi
neers, technicians, craftsmen, administrative
personnel, and maintenance workers. Per
haps forty senior research physicists will
work in the laboratory, and it is expected
that approximately half of them will he per
manent members of the staff while the rest
will be visitors from other laboratories.
ANOTHER REASON for the Stanford
location of SLAC is that as a pioneer in the
use of linear accelerating machines, Stanford
is an undisputed authority in their develop
ment. The late William Webster Hansen de
veloped the first operating Stanford linear
accelerator. As early as 1935 he had become
interested in accelerating electrons for nu
clear physics studies and he developed the

resonating cavity principle the use of a
metal box as a resonant element for high
frequencies. However, practical application
of this principle for acceleration seemed to
require prohibitively large sources of power. !
In 1937 the Varian brothers came to Stan
ford with a different objective. They wanted
to enable a pilot to see better through the
use of high-frequency radio waves the
principle qf radar. Together with Hansen,
Russell Varian invented the klystron tube :
to produce such waves, and Sigurd Varian
built the first successful model.
After W W II the Hansen Microwave
Laboratory developed klystrons of high and
higher power, culminating in an intermittent
capacity of 30 million watts, an increase of
about a thousandfold capacity. This huge
power source made feasible Hansen’s earlier
ideas. He set out to devise a linear array of
his resonating cavities and in 1947 the first
successful accelerating pipe was built with
support from the Office of Naval Research.
HANSEN DIED IN 1919, and his work on
the much larger Mark HI linear accelerator,
now 310 feet long, was continued by Drs.
Edward L. Ginston, Richard B. Neal, Marvin
Chodorow, and by Dr. Panofsky.
In 1952 Dr. Panofsky and Dr. Robert Hof
stadler and their colleagues began work
with the Mark 111. Hofstadter received the
Nobel Prize in 1961 for his precise studies of
atomic nuclei! with that accelerator.
It was formally proposed in 1957 to build
an accelerator two miles in length. Congress
agreed in 1961 that the Atomic Energy Com
mission should supervise and finance the
$ll 4,000,000 project at Stanford.

late 1966.


CONSTRUCTION has already begun on the bed for the accelerator itself. This view,
facing west toward Searsville Lake, was taken from a point about a mile and a half
from the start of the accelerator and about a half a mile from the center shown in
