# New Facilities, Staff, Scholars Change Chemistry Department

### MIRIAM BETENSKY 
“Changing” is the best word to describe the
current situation of the Stanford chemistry
department. Now facilities, faculty, and
scholars have brought important changes to
the program in recent years.
Quite in evidence is the new John Stauffer
Laboratory for Physical Chemistry, being
constructed behind existing buildings.
Ground was broken for the lab in December
1962, and the work is expected to be finished
on the million dollar structure by December
1963. Basic financing for the building was
furnished by John Stauffer, senior vice
president of the Stauffer Chemical Company.
Additional support was given by the Na
tional Science Foundation.
THE BUILDING WILL comprise 22,000
square feet, in two floors and a basement.
Architecturally, it will be a close copy of
the existing Stauffer organic chemistry
building, which was occupied in October
1960 and dedicated in March 1961.
The new lab will provide much needed
space for physical chemical research, a na
tional center for advanced teaching and re
search. As the first Stauffer building, the
second will provide needed facilities unavail
able' in the old main chemistry building.
New professors and contributions by pres
ent faculty keep new ideas constantly circu
lating. Two new professors expected in the
near future are Drs. Harden McConnell from
California Institute of Technology and John
1. Brauman, a physical organic chemist.
Pi atimnn will arrive next fall and McCnn

Nell in the fall of 1964.
MANY NOTED TIEN comprise the present
chemistry department, headed by Prof. Wil
liam S. Johnson. He succeeded Dr. George
S. Parks in 1960. Johnson has made his
reputation for his work on the laboratory
synthesis of steroid and steroid-like com
pounds.
Also working in the steroid field, an im
portant part of the Stanford research pro
gram, is Prof. Carl Djerassi. He is also in
terested in various natural products.
IN PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY important
work is being carried out by Prof. Frederick
Koenig in the field of thermodynamics. Rich
ard Ogg in nuclear magnetic spectroscopy
and reaction kinetics, and Eric Hutchinson
in colloid and surface chemistry.
Two fairly recent appointments in physical
chemistry are Prof. Paul Flory and Prof.
Henry Taube. Flory is known for his work
on the physical chemistry of plastics and par
ticipated in pioneering studies such as those
leading to the pratical utilization of nylon.
Taube taught for a number of years at the
University of Chicago and his field is physi
cal inorganic chemistry, including such topics
as rapid reaction kinetics, the structure and
stability of complex ions.
GROWTH IN THE chemistry department
is also shown by the increasing number of
students. For example, the number of regis
tered graduate students has increased from
17 to 93 between 1958 and 1962. In the same
period postdoctoral scholars increased from
in to 45

1962, and the work is expected to be finished
on the million dollar structure by December
1963. Basic financing for the building was
furnished by John Stauffer, senior vice
president of the Stauffer Chemical Company.
Additional support was given by the Na
tional Science Foundation.
THE BUILDING WILL comprise 22,000
square feet, in two floors and a basement.
Architecturally, it will be a close copy of
the existing Stauffer organic chemistry
building, which was occupied in October
1960 and dedicated in March 1961.
The new lab will provide much needed
space for physical chemical research, a na
tional center for advanced teaching and re
search. As the first Stauffer building, the
second will provide needed facilities unavail
able' in the old main chemistry building.
New professors and contributions by pres
ent faculty keep new ideas constantly circu
lating. Two new professors expected in the
near future are Drs. Harden McConnell from
California Institute of Technology and John
1. Brauman, a physical organic chemist.
Pi atimnn will arrive next fall and McCnn

Nell in the fall of 1964.
MANY NOTED TIEN comprise the present
chemistry department, headed by Prof. Wil
liam S. Johnson. He succeeded Dr. George
S. Parks in 1960. Johnson has made his
reputation for his work on the laboratory
synthesis of steroid and steroid-like com
pounds.
Also working in the steroid field, an im
portant part of the Stanford research pro
gram, is Prof. Carl Djerassi. He is also in
terested in various natural products.
IN PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY important
work is being carried out by Prof. Frederick
Koenig in the field of thermodynamics. Rich
ard Ogg in nuclear magnetic spectroscopy
and reaction kinetics, and Eric Hutchinson
in colloid and surface chemistry.
Two fairly recent appointments in physical
chemistry are Prof. Paul Flory and Prof.
Henry Taube. Flory is known for his work
on the physical chemistry of plastics and par
ticipated in pioneering studies such as those
leading to the pratical utilization of nylon.
Taube taught for a number of years at the
University of Chicago and his field is physi
cal inorganic chemistry, including such topics
as rapid reaction kinetics, the structure and
stability of complex ions.
GROWTH IN THE chemistry department
is also shown by the increasing number of
students. For example, the number of regis
tered graduate students has increased from
17 to 93 between 1958 and 1962. In the same
period postdoctoral scholars increased from
in to 45
“Changing” is the best word to describe the
current situation of the Stanford chemistry
department. Now facilities, faculty, and
scholars have brought important changes to
the program in recent years.
Quite in evidence is the new John Stauffer
Laboratory for Physical Chemistry, being
constructed behind existing buildings.
Ground was broken for the lab in December
1962, and the work is expected to be finished
on the million dollar structure by December
1963. Basic financing for the building was
