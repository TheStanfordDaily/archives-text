# CARDS NOW 20-7
## Post's Homer Helps Beat Pepperdine 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Stanford faced the number one
college pitcher in (he nation ac
cording lo won-lost records yes
terday at the Sunken Diamond,
but apparently the disrespectful
Indians didn’t read Bob Hylton’s
press clippings before going out
and beating him and his lllh
ranked Pepperdine teammates 6-2.
Dick Kovacevich picked up his
fifth straight win of the season
without a loss in hurling the first
seven rounds. Darrell Sutherland
finished up and helped to hand
I the highly regarded Hylton his
j second loss against nine wins.
STANFORD GOT a clue as to
1 what kind of pitcher Hylton is
I when they noticed the catcher
using a butterfly net in warmups
instead of the more conventional
I glove. Hylton threw a variety of
cream puffs, marshmallows, and
butterflies, but the Tribe solved
him early in the game. In the
second inning Stanford got its
first run on a walk to George
Thacher, a single to Warren Now
ell. one of three hits he collected
' in the game, and a single by Gary
Smith.
In the home half of the fifth
the Indians, who have had trouble
finding the plate in recent games,
dented it four times. After Shul
man had walked, Post lined a
drive to right field. Pepperdine’s
right fielder Beaman looked like
a kid trying to follow the flight
of an erratic kite. He finally tried
J to shoestring the hall, but it skid
ded by him and back to the wall.
In Sunken Diamond a ball which
I gets by the outfielder has as
j much space to roll in as a marble
j in the Mojave Desert, and Post
romped home with an inside the
park home run.
THEN COX singled and Bob
Hollmann walked. Thacher lined
a single to left, but the left field
er nailed Cox at the plate. New
ell’s bloop single scored Holl
mann. When Smith took a fourth
ball, the ball squirted away from
catcher Hopkins. Thacher dashed
for the plate, but the throw from
Hopkins to pitcher Hylton cut
him down like so much wheat.
Pepperdine, a very hard hitting

club, finally found the range for j
their two runs in the sixth. A
walk lo Hopkins and an error by
Shulman put runners on first and 1
second. A single by Ted Bridges
j scored the first run, and the sec- 1
ond marker came over on Gary |
j Sabella’s force play.

GREG POST lays d own a bunt single to load the bases for Stanford
in the third inning of yesterday’s game with Pepperdine. The husky
outfielder later smacked an inside-the-park home run to score
the winning runs in the 5th inning. Stanford won its 20th game
in 27 starts with the 6-2 win.
Stanford faced the number one
college pitcher in (he nation ac
cording lo won-lost records yes
terday at the Sunken Diamond,
but apparently the disrespectful
Indians didn’t read Bob Hylton’s
press clippings before going out
and beating him and his lllh
ranked Pepperdine teammates 6-2.
Dick Kovacevich picked up his
fifth straight win of the season
without a loss in hurling the first
seven rounds. Darrell Sutherland
finished up and helped to hand
I the highly regarded Hylton his
j second loss against nine wins.
STANFORD GOT a clue as to
1 what kind of pitcher Hylton is
I when they noticed the catcher
using a butterfly net in warmups
instead of the more conventional
I glove. Hylton threw a variety of
cream puffs, marshmallows, and
butterflies, but the Tribe solved
him early in the game. In the
second inning Stanford got its
first run on a walk to George
Thacher, a single to Warren Now
ell. one of three hits he collected
' in the game, and a single by Gary
Smith.
In the home half of the fifth
the Indians, who have had trouble
finding the plate in recent games,
dented it four times. After Shul
man had walked, Post lined a
drive to right field. Pepperdine’s
right fielder Beaman looked like
a kid trying to follow the flight
of an erratic kite. He finally tried
J to shoestring the hall, but it skid
ded by him and back to the wall.
In Sunken Diamond a ball which
I gets by the outfielder has as
j much space to roll in as a marble
j in the Mojave Desert, and Post
romped home with an inside the
park home run.
THEN COX singled and Bob
