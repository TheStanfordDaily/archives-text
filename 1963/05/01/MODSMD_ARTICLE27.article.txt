SAO PAULO, Brazil (UP)
Cuba, birth-place of many major
league stars, clinched the base
ball championship in the Pan
American Games yesterday when
the United Stales amateur team
was upset by Brazil 4-3 on a wild
pitch in the 10th inning by relief
pitcher Bobby Bruckner of St.
Louis.
The powerful Cubans then
went on to defeat Mexico, 7-3, for
their sixth victory in seven
games and assure the United
States of the second place silver
medal with a 5-3 record. Cuba,
Pan-American champion in 1951,

defeated the United States both
limes they mot this year.
The United States, however,
picked up an unexpected gold
medal -its 65th of the games
when Jeffrey Fishback of Bel
mont, Calif., raced to an upset in
the gruelling 3,000 meter steeple
chase in 9:07.9. American coach
Lou Montgomery had given up
hopes (if a steeplechase triumph
when he was forced to withdraw
title favorite George Young be
cause of illness.
In other sports, Americans
scored advanoes in track and
field preliminaries, fencing and
equestrian events.
