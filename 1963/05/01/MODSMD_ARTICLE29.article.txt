# Law School Sluggers Loom as Mural Softball Contenders
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
With only two and a half weeks
of the intramural softball season
completed, it is still difficult to
determine the strongest contend
ers for the university champion
ship. Yet several teams have
drawn attention with strong per
formances in their first two or
three games.
Yesterday the Law School won
its third straight game, beating
Muir 12-3, thereby establishing a
commanding lead in its league.
Undoubtedly the best-dressed
team in the university, outfitted
in Stanford baseball caps and
jerseys with “LEX” inscribed on
them, the Law’ team is composed
of the same nucleus of multi
sport athletes that won the uni
versity football title. They have
also beaten Fremont (10-3) and
Mechanical Engineering (forfeit).
OFFENSE is the Law team’s
forte as the first six men in the
batting order are consistent line
drive hitters, all capable of the
long ball. Pitcher Harry Olivar
is a master of the high-arch "sky
ball” pitch, while shortstop Gary
Vanderwcghe is the best defen
sive player on the team.
The Eating Quo league fea
tures primarily a two-team race,
between El Capitan and Break
ers. both playoff entries last
year. Cap is 3-0, while Breakers
goes for its third straight win to
morrow afternoon, against El
Toro. Both are excellent defensive
teams, with Cap’s third base
shortstop combination of Dick
Bail and Sandy King-Smith possi
bly the best in the university. In
their five games so far, these two
clubs have allowed only nine
runs.
THE TWO strongest fraternity
teams appear to be Sigma Chi,
the defending champs, and ATO.
Due to a forfeit and rain-out, Sig
ma Chi has played only one
game, a 12-2 win over Chi Psi.
ATO has beaten Theta Delt (2-1),
AKL (19-7), andn SAE (7-6).
In the remaining four intra
mural leagues, the top teams

currently are Phi Delt (2-0), Fiji
and Theta Xi (tied at 2-0), Neu
trinos (2-0), and Madera (1-0).
