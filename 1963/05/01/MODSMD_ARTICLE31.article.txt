## Cricketeers Use Only 3 Batsmen In 1st League Win 
### Our Cricket Correspondent 
Carmel’s Pebble Beach was (he
setting last Sunday as the hand
some red-capped Stanford crick
eteers snowed under Del Monte
Cricket Club by nine wickets, 57-
56. It was Stanford’s first Cali
fornia Cricket Association game
and it served notice to the rest of
the league that a champion is on
the way.
STANFORD scored all its runs
with only one of their alloted 10
outs per inning. Had the other
nine men batted, Stanford could
have run the score up to 300-56,
but. as in baseball, scored just
enough runs in the bottom of the
inning to win.
Michael English immediately
started the rout by clean bowling
the Del Monte skipper with a
yorker that moved in and up
rooted the off-stump, and dis
missed yet another when team
mate Dhanjoo Ghista lunged for
ward and rolled over onto his
back to take a brilliant catch.
The Del Monte middle order
batsmen tried hard to rally when
English departed after having
taken three wickets (made three
outs). But Clifford Severn came
on to bowl in his place and all
hopes for a Del Monte recovery
went down the drain, as Severn
allowed only three runs on two
wickets. When modest Andrew
Ma, the team’s most agile player,
dove full length to hold a hot re
turn for his fifth wicket, he drove
the last nail into the Del Monte
coffin.
NEEDING ONLY 57 runs to
win, Stanford’s opening batsmen,
Severn and Tryfan Rogers, lost
no time in registering 30 of them
before the latter retired unde
feated.
Elmo Perera’s brilliant baiting
and Severn’s usual majestic
drives easily dispatched the Del
Monte bowler. The seagulls had
just started to settle on the grass
when Severn blasted an off-drive
to score his 36th run and win the
game.
