## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR 
Opponents of the National Student Association at the Uni
versity of Oregon kept the issue alive last week in spite of a stu
dent referendum approving NSA hy it 17(14-1471 vote. Raising a
question as to the constitutionality of University NSA member
ship, 20 law students appealed further to the student Senate

where their resolution was de
feated.
Walter Grebe, president of the
Oregon law school student body
and spokesman for the NSA op
ponents, clarified their position:
“Our fight is not with NSA as
such. We are not concerned about
the relative merits of NSA. Our
argument is purely on constitu
tional grounds.
“Our sole concern is in using
students’ money which was not

freely given but taken out of
student fees and in using that
money to help support an organi
zation which takes political
stands and lobbies on issues with
which many students are not in
agreement.

“There is a group of us who
feel it is not correct to take our
sturlent fees to join an organiza
tion whose stands wo disagree
with. This is a violation of our
constitutional rights under the
first and fourteenth amend
ments,” Grebe said.
ASUO President Phil Sher
burne consented to allowing
Glebe to present his case before
the Senate and appointed Bob
Ackerman, third-year law student
and former president of the
Young Democrats, to present a
counter argument at the same
time.

During the Senate debate,
Giebe contended that there were
3000 or 4000 students “who do
not want NSA membership and
whose rights will be violated by
joining.”

Ackerman said that the ulti
mate decision should be made in
a court of law, hut that “there is
also an opportunity for every stu
dent to run for NSA delegate, to
articulate his own ideas and ex
press his own opinions. I don’t
agree that, anyone would be de
nied an opportunity to participate
in NSA.” The Senate approved
NSA membership by a vote of
20-4.
