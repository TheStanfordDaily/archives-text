# Brugmans' Tuesday Evening Lecture Cites Problems Posed by De Gaulle
## 
### NANCY STEFFEN 
"It is too facile ot disregard DeGaulle’s challenge in hope that
one day one old man will die or resign. ’ Thus Hendrik Brugmans
in his Tuesday Evening Series speech last night, approached the
problem that French President DeGaidle poses to the European
Community and the Atlantic Alliance. Brugmans, rector of the

College of Europe in Bruges, Bel-'*
glum, stressed that for many
Frenchmen “DeGaulle represents
a long-desired element of continu
ity and leadership.”
DEGAULLE NOT provinci
al: he has a feeling for Europe as
a whole. But ultimately, he is a
nationalist, “DeGaulle feels
France is the heart of universal
civilization,” Brugmans comment
ed.
BKUGMAXS emphasized, how
ever, that although it may be dif
ficult to agree with President De-
Gaulle’s attitude, it is equally dif
ficult to ignore the unpleasant
questions his position poses.
Brugmans feels that DeGaulle,

> ■
misguided and out-dated as his
methods may be, recognizes that
“Europe is still an American pro
for her own problems. He stress
ed that the root of DeGaulle’s At
lantic policy lies in the fact that
i ‘Europe is still an American pro
tectorate.”
As an alternative to DeGaulle's
| position, Brugmans proposed that
! Europe work for a united de
fense under a central command,
including common nuclear arms,
and for the establishment of a
political community. “The final
goal is no European nation or
supra-state, but rather a Euro
pean Community,” Brugmans
. concluded. “Then Europe will set
, tie her own affairs."
