“Prior to 1958 there were only three long-term
field studies of monkeys and apes in a natural
habitat. ... At the present time more than fifty
persons from eleven countries, including zoolo
gists, psychologists, and anthropologists, are en
gaged in such studies," according to Dr. Irven De-
Vore. a University of California anthropologist
who is currently spending the year as one of the
50 Fellows at the Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences, located on the Lathrop
hill overlooking the Stanford campus.
DeVore points out that these anthropologists,
psychologists and zoologists working in the new
field of “primatology” were doing field work and
returning to their home institutions to write up
their results in isolation, basing them on varying
training, terminology, and conceptual frames of
reference.
IT WAS DECIDED to get the people who had
done major work in the field together to evaluate
current material in the field and to organize their
studies into a comprehensive book which would
serve as an approach to the whole discipline of
primate field work.
“This had never before happened in a young
science,” said DeVore. “The conception of the idea
was a unique moment in the history of a rapidly
expanding field.”
The primate study program, headed by Dr.
David A. Hamburg, head of the Department of
Psychiatry at Stanford Medical School, and Dr.
Sherwood L. Washburn of UC-Berkeley, was made
possible by a §99.000 grant from the National In
stitute of Mental Health.
The book, “Field Studies of Monkeys and
Apes,” which will be released next year, will con
tain a large section of descriptions of various
species of primates and a second section on field
and laboratory studies of primates.
The book will be edited by DeVore and will be
based on the work of twenty major contributors,
six of whom are in residence at the Behavioral
Sciences Center this year. Additional material and
ideas were gathered from other workers who at
tended a conference last September at the Center.
The Fellows working on the Primate project
have continued with their individual work in addi
tion to their contributions to the book. Dr. K. R. L.
Hall, of the University of Bristol, for example,
wrote nine papers during his half-year stay at the
Behavioral Sciences Center.
“THE MOUNTAIN GORILLA: Ecology and
Behavior,” a book by Dr. George Schaller will
soon bo published. Schaller spent 13 months in
the Viringa Volcano area of the East Congo where
ho became the first person to get accurate infor
mation on the way of life of gorillas.
Most of the workers, moreover, came from and
are returning to the field Hall F presently in

Uganda studying patas monkeys. Dr. Phyllis Jay,
a University of California anthropologist, has just
returned from a two-month tour of India, South
east Asia, and Japan with Alfred Eisenstaedt,
Life Magazine photographer. The trip was taken
to photograph a wide variety of monkeys.
Hiroki Mizuhara of Kyoto University has
studied Japanese monkeys at the Japan Monkey
Center and mountain gorillas in Uganda. He is re
turning to Africa this summer to study chimpan
zees.
i)li. VERNON REYNOLDS, an anthropologist,
and his wife Frances, a psychologist, have been in
the Budongo Forest in Uganda where they studied
the behavior of wild chimpanzees for eight
months.
An example of the kind of results that are
hoped to be obtained by combining several fields
of study can be seen in the work of DeVore and
Washburn.
They will return to Nairobi Park in Kenya to
study the ecology of baboons. Since these monkeys
are, aside from man. the most successful ground
living primates, DeVore and Washburn feel that
a study of their way of life will give insight into
the problems which confronted early man.
THEY WILL attempt to reconstruct the evolu
tion of human behavior by comparing the social
behavior and ecology of baboons with that of liv
ing hunter-gatherer groups such as the African
Bushmen and the Australian Aborigines, and by
applying these comparisons to the archeological
evidence.
DeVore and Richard Lee, a graduate student in
anthropology, will spend almost a year studying
the bushmon of the Kalahari desert in South West
Africa. They hope to obtain detailed information
about the lives of these primitive people through
out the year’s cycle.
DeVore and Washburn emphasize that: “Obvi
ously, man is not descended from a baboon, and
the behavior of our ancestors may have been very
different from that of living baboons. But we
think that in a general way the problems faced
by the baboon troop may be very similar to those
which confronted our ancestors.”
They also point out that contemporary hunter
gatherers cannot be equated with our ancestors.
But “while the social customs, religion, and art
of contemporary hunter-gatherers have surely un
dergone considerable change in the last half mil
lion years, the adaptation of the group to its en
vironment has probably changed far less.”
“However, these investigations must be carried
out as soon as possible,” say DeVore and Wash
burn in a recent report.
“Mining, ranching, and labor-recuiting activi
ties are expanding in northern South West Africa
and it is likely that the economic organization of
the northern Bushmen will be radically altered
within the next few years.

science,” said DeVore. “The conception of the idea
was a unique moment in the history of a rapidly
expanding field.”
The primate study program, headed by Dr.
David A. Hamburg, head of the Department of
Psychiatry at Stanford Medical School, and Dr.
Sherwood L. Washburn of UC-Berkeley, was made
possible by a §99.000 grant from the National In
stitute of Mental Health.
The book, “Field Studies of Monkeys and
Apes,” which will be released next year, will con
tain a large section of descriptions of various
species of primates and a second section on field
and laboratory studies of primates.
The book will be edited by DeVore and will be
based on the work of twenty major contributors,
six of whom are in residence at the Behavioral
Sciences Center this year. Additional material and
ideas were gathered from other workers who at
tended a conference last September at the Center.
The Fellows working on the Primate project
have continued with their individual work in addi
tion to their contributions to the book. Dr. K. R. L.
Hall, of the University of Bristol, for example,
wrote nine papers during his half-year stay at the
Behavioral Sciences Center.
“THE MOUNTAIN GORILLA: Ecology and
Behavior,” a book by Dr. George Schaller will
soon bo published. Schaller spent 13 months in
the Viringa Volcano area of the East Congo where
ho became the first person to get accurate infor
mation on the way of life of gorillas.
Most of the workers, moreover, came from and
are returning to the field Hall F presently in

Uganda studying patas monkeys. Dr. Phyllis Jay,
a University of California anthropologist, has just
returned from a two-month tour of India, South
east Asia, and Japan with Alfred Eisenstaedt,
Life Magazine photographer. The trip was taken
to photograph a wide variety of monkeys.
Hiroki Mizuhara of Kyoto University has
studied Japanese monkeys at the Japan Monkey
Center and mountain gorillas in Uganda. He is re
turning to Africa this summer to study chimpan
zees.
i)li. VERNON REYNOLDS, an anthropologist,
and his wife Frances, a psychologist, have been in
the Budongo Forest in Uganda where they studied
the behavior of wild chimpanzees for eight
months.
An example of the kind of results that are
hoped to be obtained by combining several fields
of study can be seen in the work of DeVore and
Washburn.
They will return to Nairobi Park in Kenya to
study the ecology of baboons. Since these monkeys
are, aside from man. the most successful ground
living primates, DeVore and Washburn feel that
a study of their way of life will give insight into
the problems which confronted early man.
THEY WILL attempt to reconstruct the evolu
tion of human behavior by comparing the social
behavior and ecology of baboons with that of liv
ing hunter-gatherer groups such as the African
Bushmen and the Australian Aborigines, and by
applying these comparisons to the archeological
evidence.
DeVore and Richard Lee, a graduate student in
anthropology, will spend almost a year studying
the bushmon of the Kalahari desert in South West
Africa. They hope to obtain detailed information
about the lives of these primitive people through
out the year’s cycle.
DeVore and Washburn emphasize that: “Obvi
ously, man is not descended from a baboon, and
the behavior of our ancestors may have been very
different from that of living baboons. But we
think that in a general way the problems faced
by the baboon troop may be very similar to those
which confronted our ancestors.”
They also point out that contemporary hunter
gatherers cannot be equated with our ancestors.
But “while the social customs, religion, and art
of contemporary hunter-gatherers have surely un
dergone considerable change in the last half mil
lion years, the adaptation of the group to its en
vironment has probably changed far less.”
“However, these investigations must be carried
out as soon as possible,” say DeVore and Wash
burn in a recent report.
“Mining, ranching, and labor-recuiting activi
ties are expanding in northern South West Africa
and it is likely that the economic organization of
the northern Bushmen will be radically altered
within the next few years.
“Prior to 1958 there were only three long-term
field studies of monkeys and apes in a natural
habitat. ... At the present time more than fifty
persons from eleven countries, including zoolo
gists, psychologists, and anthropologists, are en
gaged in such studies," according to Dr. Irven De-
Vore. a University of California anthropologist
who is currently spending the year as one of the
50 Fellows at the Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences, located on the Lathrop
hill overlooking the Stanford campus.
DeVore points out that these anthropologists,
psychologists and zoologists working in the new
field of “primatology” were doing field work and
returning to their home institutions to write up
their results in isolation, basing them on varying
training, terminology, and conceptual frames of
reference.
IT WAS DECIDED to get the people who had
done major work in the field together to evaluate
current material in the field and to organize their
studies into a comprehensive book which would
serve as an approach to the whole discipline of
primate field work.

Behavioral Sciences Center.
“THE MOUNTAIN GORILLA: Ecology and
Behavior,” a book by Dr. George Schaller will
soon bo published. Schaller spent 13 months in
the Viringa Volcano area of the East Congo where
ho became the first person to get accurate infor
mation on the way of life of gorillas.
Most of the workers, moreover, came from and
are returning to the field Hall F presently in

Uganda studying patas monkeys. Dr. Phyllis Jay,
a University of California anthropologist, has just
returned from a two-month tour of India, South
east Asia, and Japan with Alfred Eisenstaedt,
Life Magazine photographer. The trip was taken
to photograph a wide variety of monkeys.
Hiroki Mizuhara of Kyoto University has
studied Japanese monkeys at the Japan Monkey
Center and mountain gorillas in Uganda. He is re
turning to Africa this summer to study chimpan
zees.
i)li. VERNON REYNOLDS, an anthropologist,
and his wife Frances, a psychologist, have been in
the Budongo Forest in Uganda where they studied
the behavior of wild chimpanzees for eight
months.
An example of the kind of results that are
hoped to be obtained by combining several fields
of study can be seen in the work of DeVore and
Washburn.
They will return to Nairobi Park in Kenya to
study the ecology of baboons. Since these monkeys
are, aside from man. the most successful ground
living primates, DeVore and Washburn feel that
a study of their way of life will give insight into
the problems which confronted early man.
THEY WILL attempt to reconstruct the evolu
tion of human behavior by comparing the social
behavior and ecology of baboons with that of liv
ing hunter-gatherer groups such as the African
Bushmen and the Australian Aborigines, and by
applying these comparisons to the archeological
evidence.
DeVore and Richard Lee, a graduate student in
anthropology, will spend almost a year studying
the bushmon of the Kalahari desert in South West
Africa. They hope to obtain detailed information
about the lives of these primitive people through
out the year’s cycle.
DeVore and Washburn emphasize that: “Obvi
ously, man is not descended from a baboon, and
the behavior of our ancestors may have been very
different from that of living baboons. But we
think that in a general way the problems faced
by the baboon troop may be very similar to those
which confronted our ancestors.”
They also point out that contemporary hunter
gatherers cannot be equated with our ancestors.
But “while the social customs, religion, and art
of contemporary hunter-gatherers have surely un
dergone considerable change in the last half mil
lion years, the adaptation of the group to its en
vironment has probably changed far less.”
“However, these investigations must be carried
out as soon as possible,” say DeVore and Wash
burn in a recent report.
“Mining, ranching, and labor-recuiting activi
ties are expanding in northern South West Africa
and it is likely that the economic organization of
the northern Bushmen will be radically altered
within the next few years.
“Prior to 1958 there were only three long-term
field studies of monkeys and apes in a natural
habitat. ... At the present time more than fifty
persons from eleven countries, including zoolo
gists, psychologists, and anthropologists, are en
gaged in such studies," according to Dr. Irven De-
Vore. a University of California anthropologist
who is currently spending the year as one of the
50 Fellows at the Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences, located on the Lathrop
hill overlooking the Stanford campus.
DeVore points out that these anthropologists,
psychologists and zoologists working in the new
field of “primatology” were doing field work and
returning to their home institutions to write up
their results in isolation, basing them on varying
training, terminology, and conceptual frames of
reference.
IT WAS DECIDED to get the people who had
done major work in the field together to evaluate
current material in the field and to organize their
studies into a comprehensive book which would
serve as an approach to the whole discipline of
primate field work.
“This had never before happened in a young
science,” said DeVore. “The conception of the idea
was a unique moment in the history of a rapidly
expanding field.”
The primate study program, headed by Dr.
David A. Hamburg, head of the Department of
Psychiatry at Stanford Medical School, and Dr.
Sherwood L. Washburn of UC-Berkeley, was made
possible by a §99.000 grant from the National In
stitute of Mental Health.
The book, “Field Studies of Monkeys and
Apes,” which will be released next year, will con
tain a large section of descriptions of various
species of primates and a second section on field
and laboratory studies of primates.
The book will be edited by DeVore and will be
based on the work of twenty major contributors,
six of whom are in residence at the Behavioral
Sciences Center this year. Additional material and
ideas were gathered from other workers who at
tended a conference last September at the Center.
The Fellows working on the Primate project
have continued with their individual work in addi
tion to their contributions to the book. Dr. K. R. L.
Hall, of the University of Bristol, for example,
wrote nine papers during his half-year stay at the
Behavioral Sciences Center.
