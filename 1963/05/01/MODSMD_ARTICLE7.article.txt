United Press International

PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti—A five-man investigating team from
the Organization of American States arrived yesterday to keep the
heated dispute between Haiti and the Dominican Republic from
flaring into open warfare. The five-nation committee met with
President Francois Duvalier yesterday afternoon as several hundred
Haitians demonstrated in the streets in support of the government.
The city was completely calm. There were no outward signs of
military preparations. Political tensions oPthe weekend appeared to
have eased considerably. The presence of the inter-American group
here was expected in itself to lessen the danger of an armed clash
between the two nations. Diplomats indicated that the OAS truce
team, headed by Ambassador Alberto Zuleta Angel of Colombia,
would remain at least a week.
BERLIN MAY DAY CROWDS BLOCKED— BERLIN—West Berlin
police yesterday set up barricades near the Communist anti-refugee
wall to keep May Day crowds away from trigger-happy East Ger
man border guards. At least half a million West Berliners were
expected to assemble today in front of the old Reichstag building
about 173 yards from the wall in a May Day demonstration of their
determination to remain free.
Simultaneously, several thousand East Berliners were to meet
on the other side of the wall in the Marx-Engels Square, about a
mile from the Western assembly. The East Berlin celebration will
feature a huge May Day parade spearheaded by a Communist mili
tary display.

Embassy spokesman said Ambassador Foy D. Kohler and the em
bassy staff are boycotting the Soviet May Day celebrations today in
Red Square in which Cuban Premier Fidel Castro was starred. It
was the first such May Day boycott since the United States estab
lished relations with the Soviet Union in 1933.
The spokesman declined to state the official reason for the
boycott. However, it was understood to have been sparked by the
presence of Castro who took Cuba into the Communist camp under
the nose of the United States. Diplomatic sources said that in strict
protocol terms, the absence of the American ambassador from the
celebrations is not considered discourteous.
BROWN ANTICIPATED DEATH BILL DEFEAT —SACRAMENTO
—Gov. Edmund G. Brown admitted yesterday that his death penalty
bill had an “absolutely zero” chance of passage in the state senate.
Brown, a determined foe of capital punishment, made the admission
as one of his supporters in the legislature abandoned a controversial
plan to permit televising of the quadruple execution scheduled in
San Quentin’s gas chamber Friday.

U.S. BOYCOTTS SOVIET CELEBRATIONS —MOSCOW—A US.
Embassy spokesman said Ambassador Foy D. Kohler and the em
bassy staff are boycotting the Soviet May Day celebrations today in
Red Square in which Cuban Premier Fidel Castro was starred. It
was the first such May Day boycott since the United States estab
lished relations with the Soviet Union in 1933.
The spokesman declined to state the official reason for the
boycott. However, it was understood to have been sparked by the
presence of Castro who took Cuba into the Communist camp under
the nose of the United States. Diplomatic sources said that in strict
protocol terms, the absence of the American ambassador from the
celebrations is not considered discourteous.
