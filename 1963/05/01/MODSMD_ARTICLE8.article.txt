# 'Colors in Clay and Cloth' Theme of Union Art Display
## 
### KATHLEEN FARGO 
“Colors in Clay and Cloth,” a
display of pottery and fabrics
loaned by the San Francisco As
sociation of Potters and the Con
temporary Handweavers of Cali
fornia, will be on display at Tre
sidder through May 17.
The displays of pottery and
fabrics were prepared separately
by each organization, but their
combined showing illustrates the
complete compatibility of the two
crafts.
O.XK DISPLAY in particular
illustrates the jewel-like quality
that can be achieved in each craft.
The fabric, which is white and
delicate with a shiny thread run
ning through it, was originally
titled “Diamond” at a show in
which each fabric represented a
jewel. The pots in the showcase
are porcelain-glazed in blues and
greens. One, by H. H. Saunders,
is sprinkled with a light blue
crystal on its pale green surface,
and the glaze of another, by
Saunders, resembles foamy sea
I water.
A FABRIC DONE with an “M
and O” pattern, a very old and
intricate design, is featured with
pottery of unusual textures. The
varying textures of the fabric are
| complemented by pots of spiny,

foamy, and smooth surfaces.
AN UNUSUAL, bright orange
fabric by Janet MeNich domi
nates another display. It resem
bles a fish net of orange string
interwoven with strips of an
orange gauze-like material and is
displayed with two large, sturdy
jars by Minora Nojima.
Among the items of pottery are
some jars that show abstract ex
pressionism in pottery. They look
as if they were pieced together
instead of being made as an un
broken whole.
Of special interest is a mounted
display in the upstairs lobby
which was prepared by the Con
temporary Handweavers. This
part of the show was originally
done for the 1961 Conference of
Northern California Hand
weavers,
PHOTOGRAPHS of morning,
twilight, and evening scenes
were used as inspiration for creat
ing a sampler of fabric. The
samples recreate the colors of the
photographs, simplify the forms
of the scenes, and give textui'e
an dimension to the flat pictures.
The display was assembled by
the Cultural Arts Division of
Tresidder with the help of weav
ers Mrs. Alice Partanen, Mr s.
Betha White, and Mr. and Mrs.
Pric p. pierry.
