# Joyce Sees World Govt. As Answer to Exstinction
## 
### BRUCH CAMPBELL 
“ The issue of today is the arms
race versus the human race, j
World government must succeed ;
or there will be no world.” These i
views were presented yesterday |
by James Avery Joyce in his an- j
alysis of “What Are the Chances
for World Government?”, pre-1
sented in the main lounge of
Tresidder.
Joyce, British author, barrister. |
economist, and authority on j
world affairs, expressed the be
lief that the goal of world gov-j
eminent could be established by |
gradual transfer of power from !
the nations of the world to the'
United Nations, in order to (
“transmute the UN into an effee-i
live world-governing body.
HE OPENED HIS talk by re
ferring to a new thesis of evolu- j
lion, proposed by Professor Rob
ert Audrey in his book “African
Genesis,” that man’s ancestor is
the killer ape, which was su
preme in its day because it could
use weapons to defend its terri
tory.
Joyce, who attended the first
Geneva disarmament conference,
says men must subvert this “kill
er compulsion” and replace talk
ing and propagandizing with posi
tive actions.
He said he agrees with the paci
fist approach of unilateral dis
armament; “two years ago it was
unthinkable to say so, but experts
are now saying it | unilateral dis
armament! is inevitable oven
without agreement, which would
follow the disarmament in a year
or two.”
“I am on the side of all who

want to bring peace, but the im
portant question is, do we have a
program of disarmament that
will let us make the shift from
war to peace economies.”
HE FEEIaS THAT ideological
categories (East versus West i
are no longer valid, that all peo
ple must work as a unit to
achieve peace. What is now going
on is the “moral, political, psy
chological equivalent of war.”
Joyce would like to see the UN
“an assembly of representatives,
more parliamentary,” and wishes
the World Court and the Security
Council had more power.
“There is no alternative,” he
states. “If the deadlock is not re
solved, it will resolve us.”
Joyce, currently on a lecture
tour in which he is talking main
ly about criminology and capital
punishment, makes almost annu
al trips to the United States to
lecture on world problems, Brit
ish affairs, and legal and educa
tional problems. He is a graduate
of the University of London with
degrees in economics, political
science, history, and law.
HE WAS SPECIAL correspond
ent at League of Nations assem
blies in Geneva and has attended
most United Nations assemblies
in New York since the war.
