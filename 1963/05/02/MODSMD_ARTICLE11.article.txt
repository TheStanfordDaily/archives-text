### HOPE SELBY 
“Are you afraid of germs on
j doorknobs? Do people talk about
i you behind your back?”
Every Stanford freshman has
answered these questions. They
appear on the personality test
administered to all incoming
freshmen by the Counseling and
Testing Center as part of their
I undergraduate research studies
| program.
Dr. John G. Black, director of
(the center and associate consult
j ing professor of psychology, says
that this test is only one aspect
! of the many-sided program es
| tablished by the center to ‘‘help
j students acquire a working
I knowledge of themselves that will
] grow as it is tested by the de
j mands of future decisions and ad
! justments.”
STUDENTS' association with
I the center begins during pre-reg-
I istration, when they take a series
i of tests to determine the nature
[ of their vocational interests and
i to predict dominant aspects of
1 their personalities.
| The personality test, from
which the above quotation is
| taken, is designed to predict the
I development of qualities such as
| leadership, social presence, co
-1 operativeness, tolerance, and flex

ibilily during a student’s college 1
career. A separate scale on this
test measures academic potential
in relation to other non-intellect
ual characteristics. When scores
from this test were correlated
with freshmen men’s grades in
Western Civ, it was found that
those with the highest grades
generally scored high on the
scales relating to interest in in
tellectual activity, social assert
iveness, efficiency, and co-opera-
I tiveness.
The other test administered to
| incoming freshmen is the Strong
j Interest Test, which measures
vocational potential by compar
ing a student’s interests with
those of people already engaged 1
in a particular career. From these
tests a student learns the degree
of interest he has in a profession
such as teaching, engineering, ar- I
chitecture, or journalism.
Other tests administered by the |
center include the graduate rec
ord exams and tests for employ- i
ment in various companies.
PROFESSIONAL counseling as ’
j well as testing is provided by the
! center. Consider, for example, a
I student who is having difficulty
adjusting to certain aspects of
[ college life. Most of these stu
[ dents reveal feelings of personal
j inadequacy stemming from the
; separation from family and

| home, the competitive academic j
situation at Stanford, and the de-
I mands on them for self-govern-
I ment and social adjustment in a
| new milieu. These students can
be helped by the center through
more tests, a series of interviews,
or referral to a private psycholo
gist or psychiatrist in the com
munity.
Other students have difficul
ties deciding on their ultimate
career plans. These students can
Ibo helped through more voca
tional tests and interviews. The
additional tests are designed to
see if vocational interests have
changed since freshman year,
while the interviews serve to in
-1 tegrate the findings with the stu
dent’s personal evaluation of his
interests.
THE OTHER main service of
fered to students is a rapid read
ing and study aids course. Stu
dents meet three times a week in
groups of ten to fifteen to im
prove their ability to absorb the
content of reading material.
The center also conducts many
I surveys, including one on the
I grading system at Stanford and
| its effects on academic motiva
| tion. Another survey test, given
| to freshmen winter quarter, was
I designed to evaluate their reac
| tion to the Western Civ program
land to their Civ teachers.
