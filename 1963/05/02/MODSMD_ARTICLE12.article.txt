Auditorium on “What’s Wrong
with Education.” The speech is
sponsored by the freshman class.
Rafferty, who was elected last
November on the basis of a cam
paign against “progressive” edu
cation, is in favor of the follow
ing positions as stated in his book
“Suffer Little Children”; that
teachers be more firmly ground
ed academically in the subjects
they teach and should be paid on
the basis of merit, that more
homework be given, that Com
munism should be studied in the
schools, and that a stronger em
phasis be placed on the “3R’s.”
Attacking life-adjustment edu
cation. Rafferty has stated “Ad

is a pricked balloon. To adjust
to the twentieth century is to
come to terms with madness.
What is needed is the adjustment
of our environment to ourselves,
or rather what we would like our
selves to be.”
