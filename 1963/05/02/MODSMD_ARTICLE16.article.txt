# A 						Challenge Has Been Issued
## 
### 
The members of the Administration have now been chal
lenged. It is not a challenge to their authority; it is a chal
lenge to their maturity.
The members of the Peace Caucus have sent to the Ad
ministration letters announcing that they have suspended
plans to vigil in front of the President’s home and office as of
yesterday noon. The Peace Caucus members have taken this
move because they “believe progress is being made toward
reaching a solution.”
The members of the Peace Caucus have made the first
move. They have shown a sense of responsibility to the Uni
versity community and a belief in reconciliation by discus
sion and compromise. They have done this with the faith
that the Administration will make a “concerted effort” to
work toward an accepted solution to the questions at hand.
The Administration felt that the “vigils and the requests
connected with the “vigils” were a challenge to their authori
ty. No such challenge was actually issued; only a great in
security about its position could have provoked the fan
tasitcally extreme stand which was taken by the Administra
tion. A great lack of judgment and of faith in reasoning and
logic were shown when the Administration acted as it did.
One could accept action of a similar nature from members
of the student body—they are still students and have much to
learn. It is impossible, however, to accept such action from
the people who are running this University, and who are
supposed to have reached adulthood.
The Peace Caucus has taken the first move. They have
finally shown the maturity that has been needed all along. It
is only right to expect and demand that the Administration act
with the same amount of maturity.
