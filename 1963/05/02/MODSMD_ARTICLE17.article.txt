# 'Merci' to the French Students
## 
### 
Approximately thirty French students last Friday night
attracted over 300 students to the main lounge of Tresidder,
and managed to bring into sharp focus a challenge to the
University that has gone rather sorely unanswered in the past
three years.
The visiting students produced four hours worth of
“French night” as a means of—in the words of one of their
leaders—“saying thanks to Stanford.” From French pastry to
an imitation of DeCaulle, from a French actor reciting poetry
in his native language, to slides of France, the evening was a
well-planned success that thoroughly charmed its highly en
thusiastic audience.
And its audience was a hungry one. The greater portion
of them were veterans of Stanford-in-France, graduates of
one of the most daring and most successful experimental pro
grams undertaken by a modern university—the Overseas Cam
puses program. With one-third of the Stanford student body
now participating in the foreign campuses, and a total of one
half seen for tlie near future, Stanford has an excellent chance
of graduating over 35 per cent of its students bilingual and
multicultural in away that meets the highest ideals of the
broadened horizons that are the goal of a liberal education.
But the home campus has not met the brilliant lead set by
this program.
Curriculum in language and literature has not enlarged
in quality or scope to meet the more demanding require
ments of a transformed student body. “Once Around the
Quad is not checkered with announcements of plays, films,
speeches in French, German, Italian or of lecture series at a
sophisticated level on those facets of European culture of in
terest to the student who has studied abroad.
'1 he student body, partially through lack of initiative and
partially through lack of power and ability to make funda
mental changes has not answered this need. Nor has it been
met on an administrative level.
Stanfords body of French students merit a hearty “merci”
for a program “bien fait." Their Friday evening “French
night and Saturday evening dance met with an enthusiasm
that their hard work and the essential nature of their project
merited.
And for the challenge their activity points out so dramat
ically by its very success, thanks must be extended with the
hope that it doesn't stop here.
