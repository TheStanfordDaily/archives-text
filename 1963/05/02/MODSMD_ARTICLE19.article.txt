## 'Portrait': Good Initiation to Barth' 
### GARY GREEN 
(“Portrait of Karl Barth.” by Georges Casalis. Translated and
Introduced by Robert McAfee Brown. 13ft pp. Ilonbleday and
Company, $3.50.)
At the communist-organized World Youth Festival in Hel
sinki last summer, I attended an event billed as “A Meeting of
Young Christians,” unsure whether to expect a politically biased
or a merely irrelevant presentation of the Christian faith. Much
to my surprise, I arrived during an exciting and penetrating
address by Georges Casalis, a Protestant theologian from
France. M. Casalis, contrary to my suspicions, stressed (he need
for Christains to involve themselves actively in the political and
social realities of the contemporary world and to cooperate
wherever possible in good conscience with non-Christians- even
those who call themselves communists.
This spirit of engagement in the world which brought
Casalis to the controversial Helsinki Festival pervades his little
volume on Karl Barth, another theologian who has led a life of
active political involvement. Casalis reveals Barth as the wry
humorist, the impassioned opponent of Nazism, the lover and
interpreter of Mozart, the preacher to prisoners at Basel, and
the dedicated university teacher, as well as a great theologian.
‘‘Not since Luther and Calvin,” Casalis begins his “Por
trait,” “has Protestantism had a single theologian of the stature
and importance of Karl Barth.” One would hardly anticipate a
critical analysis of Barth after such an opening, and the reader
who expects a critical work will be disappointed. Casalis’s book
must be accepted for what it is: a tribute by an admirer and
student of Barth. The book is both biographical and bibliographi
cal. The first part, “The Direction of Barth’s Life,” outlines the
major events of his life, including his long friendship with Mar
tin Niemoeller, who shared the Helsinki platform with Casalis,
and their joint struggle against Hitler. The second major part
of the book. “A Critical Analysis of Barth’s Principle Works,”
though perhaps over-enthusiastic in its title, is nevertheless a
useful directory to Barth’s writings and a good bibliographical
commentary for the beginning student. A concluding “Note on
Dialectical Method,” largely quoted directly from Barth, is also
helpful to the student who undertakes the challenging task of
reading Barth’s theology.
Of special interest to the American (and particularly Stan
ford) reader, is Robert McAfee Brown’s introduction, which con
stitutes the first quarter of the book. Students of Professor
Brown’s courses at Stanford will discover the same lucidity in
presentation that characterizes his lectures. He tackles the dif
ficult problem of introducing Americans to a continental the
ologian whose major work, still incomplete, already fills twelve
thick volumes of heavy German prose.
Professor Brown devotes most of his introduction to a
refutation of some common American stereotypes of Barth. He
deals first with the charge that Barth is pessimistic and quiet
istic and concludes that “if Barth is someday adjudged a great
heretic, it will not be for his pessimism, but for his optimism!”
Dr. Brown also defends Barth against the criticisms that he
overemphasizes the trancendance of God, that he is anticul
tural, and that he is "theologically rigid, a ponderous orthodox
thinker at the far right of the theological spectrum.” The intro
duction also discusses some of the positive emphases of Barth’s
theology and some of the major criticisms of his thought.
With Dr. Brown’s introduction as an added attraction,
“Portrait of Karl Barth” is a good initiation into the thought of
a major contemporary intellectual figure.

Of special interest to the American (and particularly Stan
ford) reader, is Robert McAfee Brown’s introduction, which con
stitutes the first quarter of the book. Students of Professor
Brown’s courses at Stanford will discover the same lucidity in
presentation that characterizes his lectures. He tackles the dif
ficult problem of introducing Americans to a continental the
ologian whose major work, still incomplete, already fills twelve
thick volumes of heavy German prose.
Professor Brown devotes most of his introduction to a
refutation of some common American stereotypes of Barth. He
deals first with the charge that Barth is pessimistic and quiet
istic and concludes that “if Barth is someday adjudged a great
heretic, it will not be for his pessimism, but for his optimism!”
Dr. Brown also defends Barth against the criticisms that he
overemphasizes the trancendance of God, that he is anticul
tural, and that he is "theologically rigid, a ponderous orthodox
thinker at the far right of the theological spectrum.” The intro
duction also discusses some of the positive emphases of Barth’s
theology and some of the major criticisms of his thought.
With Dr. Brown’s introduction as an added attraction,
“Portrait of Karl Barth” is a good initiation into the thought of
a major contemporary intellectual figure.

At the communist-organized World Youth Festival in Hel
sinki last summer, I attended an event billed as “A Meeting of
Young Christians,” unsure whether to expect a politically biased
or a merely irrelevant presentation of the Christian faith. Much
to my surprise, I arrived during an exciting and penetrating
address by Georges Casalis, a Protestant theologian from
France. M. Casalis, contrary to my suspicions, stressed (he need
for Christains to involve themselves actively in the political and
social realities of the contemporary world and to cooperate
wherever possible in good conscience with non-Christians- even
those who call themselves communists.
This spirit of engagement in the world which brought
Casalis to the controversial Helsinki Festival pervades his little
volume on Karl Barth, another theologian who has led a life of
active political involvement. Casalis reveals Barth as the wry
humorist, the impassioned opponent of Nazism, the lover and
interpreter of Mozart, the preacher to prisoners at Basel, and
the dedicated university teacher, as well as a great theologian.
‘‘Not since Luther and Calvin,” Casalis begins his “Por
trait,” “has Protestantism had a single theologian of the stature
and importance of Karl Barth.” One would hardly anticipate a
critical analysis of Barth after such an opening, and the reader
who expects a critical work will be disappointed. Casalis’s book
must be accepted for what it is: a tribute by an admirer and
student of Barth. The book is both biographical and bibliographi
cal. The first part, “The Direction of Barth’s Life,” outlines the
major events of his life, including his long friendship with Mar
tin Niemoeller, who shared the Helsinki platform with Casalis,
and their joint struggle against Hitler. The second major part
of the book. “A Critical Analysis of Barth’s Principle Works,”
though perhaps over-enthusiastic in its title, is nevertheless a
useful directory to Barth’s writings and a good bibliographical
commentary for the beginning student. A concluding “Note on
Dialectical Method,” largely quoted directly from Barth, is also
helpful to the student who undertakes the challenging task of
reading Barth’s theology.
