Editors, The Daily:
In the last five years Publications Board has underwritten
losses incurred by The Bridge in excess of $700.00. Its average
circulation during this period was around 200 copies with a high
of 409 for Brooksley Born’s excellent 1961 Bridge.
The Board has in the past been willing to underwrite this
publication even though there has never been evidence of great
student interest in it.
This year, several factors mitigated to change (his policy.
First, a Bridge was approved last year and printed by the UR.
This magazine was never distributed and a sizable debt on it is
still outstanding. Second, this year’s Bridge was proposed to
Publications Board three weeks into Spring Quarter. The Board
claims some competence in matters of publishing mechanics (its
membership: the Editors and Business Managers of The Daily,
Quad, Sequoia, and Chaparral, the head of the Journalism De
partment, and representatives from LASSU and the Student
Financial Manager). It was our unanimous opinion that The
Bridge as proposed to us could not be readied for distribution
before dead week.
Therefore, Publications Board disapproved of The Bridge
proposal for financial and technical reasons. Our record demon
strates that legitimate, well-planned entreprises have never
lacked the Board’s active support and encouragement.

Editors, The Daily:
I would like to take specific issue with the letter that some
67 faculty members sent to President Sterling two days ago. In
their opposition to fallout shelters they argued that “a primary
responsibility of a university community is to apply reason, fact
and logic to matters of public concern ...” I question whether
they have done this.
They mentioned a claim made by somebody that the Stan
ford fallout shelters provide protection against a nuclear attack.
Who made this claim? Certainly, if the concerned 67 faculty
members heard Mr. Robert Beyers’ speech or read The Daily’s
report of his speech, they would have realized that he did not
claim this. The Administration has never claimed this.
Perhaps the 67 faculty members are confusing “fallout”
shelters with “bomb” or "blast” shelters. If this is the case then
we must conclude that they are the victims of “fuz.zy” thinking.
The fact remains, however, that Stanford’s fallout shelters make
no pretense of being designed for the protection from nuclear
attack or blast. Their purpose is to provide protection from the
slower death of radiation poisoning to those who survive a nu
clear attack. Their function is to preserve life and ideals. Anyone
who imagines that the basement of Encina or Dinkelspiel Audi
torium will protect one from direct nuclear attack is not apply
ing reason, fact and logic. Does the fallout shelter in the base
ment of Encina “represent a potentially dangerous development,
since a public which feels it is protected it more likely to adopt
a permissive attitude toward the promiscuous use of nuclear
weapons to attain transient political ends?”

Editors, The Daily:
Tuesday, I learned of a dittoed sheet entitled “The Five
Points of Mike Walsh” that is being circulated around campus
in connection with next week’s ASSU presidential election. This
sheet is a deliberate, vicious misrepresentation of part of a long
article I wrote on partisan politics at Stanford that appeared in
The Daily from February 6 to 8.
In doing research for this article last October, I had an
informal talk with Mr. Walsh about possible views students
could take both in favor of and against partisan politics. During
our discussion Mr. Walsh raised questions both in support of
and in opposition to partisan political activity, but he never
said or intimated that he held the views which are presently
being attributed to him by the ditto sheet.
Mr. Walsh was raising theoretical questions, therefore the
statements I attributed to him were not quotes, whereas per
sons who took definite stands were directly quoted in the article.
The dittoed sheet takes these questions which 1 attributed to Mr.
Walsh, pulls them out of context, making them appear as his
views.
I hope this letter reaches the people who have been duped
by the secret smear campaign against Mike Walsh, and that
they understand that what I wrote never pretended or was meant
to be a reflection of his personal opinions.
