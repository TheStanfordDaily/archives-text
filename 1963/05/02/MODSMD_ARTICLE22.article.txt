## 
### JUSTIN BECK 
After the first two weeks of
spring practice, new head foot
ball coach John Ralston still isn't
making any predictions. He mere
ly says that the team is moving
along. “They have a good general
attitude, but need plenty of ad
ditional work on fundamentals,”
Ralston says of (he team’s work
so far.
Assistant coach Rod Rust
echoed Ralston’s sentiment, say
ing, “The team is working hard
and as long as they have the de
sire to improve, we’re optimistic.”
With exception of the injured,
the approximately 90-man squad
has been working out four days
a week, on a mixture of offense
and defense fundamentals, and
the introduction of Ralston’s
system.

RALSTON declines to single
out any outstanding players as of
yet, and the staff stresses that
the strings are quite tentative
as of now and that quite a bit of
moving around is to be expected
during the rest of the spring.
As of the last couple of days
the number one squad (the reds)
has included three of last year’s
regulars, tackle A1 Hildebrand,
guard Frank Dubofsky, and quar

terback Steve Thurlow.
THE REST of the red squad
included ends Bob Burke, and
Guy Rounsaville, tackle Bob
Nichols, guard Bruce Kehrli. cen
ter Cal l Schrader, and backs Alan
Curr, Danny Spence, and Glenn
Myers.
Yesterday Ralston also made
several position changes. These
included moving Joe Neal from
center to tackle, George Maentz
from end to tackle, and Boh Rath
from fullback to center.

One of the biggest surprises of
the week was that Frank Patti
(ucci, a regular on last year’s
squad, was on the third team, be
hind Rounsaville and John Ma
son. Another returning regular,
Marv Harris, is at center behind
Schrader as of right now.
J. D. Lodato, a regular half
back last year, is recovering from
a broken leg, and is not expected
to see heavy duty this spring.
Ralston also said that the squad
will hold a scrimmage Saturday
in the Stanford Stadium from
9-12.
