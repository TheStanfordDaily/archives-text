# Foreign Policy Institute Plans Analysis of Sino-Soviet Dispute
## 
### 
The Foreign Policy Institute, I
the major spring program of the j
HR, will hold a three-day confer
ence to investigate and compare i
new trends in American foreign '
policy. The topic of the confer-1
ence will he the impact of the I
Sino-Soviet dispute on American j
policy and its ramifications in I
the West as a whole.
Entitled “The Sino-Soviet Dis- j
pute: Its Implications for United j
States Foreign Policy,” the con- I
ference will last from May 20 j
through May 22. Registration bo-)
gins next Wednesday, May 8, and I
will continue through May 17.
A nominal fee is required for j
enrollment, which will grant free j
admission to all speeches. In ad- j
dition, membership includes pref- j
erential seating at speeches, semi- ]
nars conducted by graduate stu-1
dents and attended by the speak-!
ers, and suggested readings and '
background material.
In afternoon and evening
speeches, five recognized experts
will present their views on the
Sino-Soviet dispute. Seminars
will allow an opportunity for stu
dent expression and contact with j
speaking guests.
THE CONFERENCE intends to -
investigate the future of U.S. for- i
eign policy by discussing such
questions as: Will the Sino-Soviet
conflict lead to increased or de
creased tension between the
United States and the Soviet Un
ion? Should the United States re
gard the U.S.S.R. and China as
separate antagonists in South
east Asia? Should the United
States grant diplomatic recogni
tion to Red China in view of her
increasingly independent action?
These issues can affect all
j areas of United States foreign
I policy. For example, the future

relations of the United States
with Cuba might depend on i
whether she turns to the Chinese j
“hard” line toward the United j
States or continues to follow the!
U.S.S.R. in its “soft” policy. (
Investigation of this topic is
being conducted now’ on the Stan
ford campus under the Conflict
project.
The Foreign Policy Institute
has one purpose: attempts to pro
vide students with a stimulating
program including competent
speakers and thought-provoking
seminars.
