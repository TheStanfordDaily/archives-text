# New Newspaper Challenges Daily
## 
### 
"Communication is the central
problem confronting the Stan
ford community." With these
words as its justification for ex
istence, a now newspaper has be
gun publication at Stanford.
The new paper, The Stanford
Nightly, is “The unofficial Organ
of the Anarchist Caucus” and
was first published last week. It
is scheduled to appear again to
morrow and each week for the
rest of the quarter.
Kim Maxwell, business man
ager for the Caucus, said that
they wish to encourage students
to actively contribute opinions
rather than to passively read
them.
In a meeting Tuesday, the An
archist Caucus agreed to con
tinue sponsorship of the news
paper, after having seen the first
issue. Contributions will be so
licited to cover publication costs.
In an editorial in its first is
sue, the Nightly took The Dally
to task bn the question of stu
dent communication. The editori
( al said in part. “It should be the
; function of a campus newspaper
j such as The Daily to promote
| communication among the stu
, dent body, and to serve as a
I clearing house for the exchange
j and expression of student opin
ion.”
The Anarchist Caucus felt that
| The Daily does not fulfill this
need; hence the appearance of the
! Nightly. About 1000 copies of the
| paper will be distributed tomor
row.
