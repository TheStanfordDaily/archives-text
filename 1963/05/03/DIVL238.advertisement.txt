NATURALLY I’M
BUYING MY DIAMOND
from CARLYLE’S
Doesn’t Everyone?
Well, perhaps not everyone
. . . but more people do come
to Carlyle Jewelers for their
Diamond Rings because they
have shopped, compared, and
have found Carlyle's prices
are never higher and in MOST
cases SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER
for the same quality diamond
rings.
