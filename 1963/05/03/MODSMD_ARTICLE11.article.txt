# Candidate Walsh Charges Malicious Campaigning
## 
### ANN TODD 
ASSU Presidential Candidate Mike Walsh claimed Wednes
day that “The Five Points of Mike Walsh,” a ditto sheet circulat
ing around campus, is a malicious misrepresentation of his views,
in a speech on KZSU.

The statements in the sheet, Walsh insisted, were taken out of

context from an article in a Feb--*
ruary Daily, quoted from a con
verstion which took place last
October. “These statements were
meant to be hypothetical ques
tions; they were not stated as be
ing my opinions.”
In response to Walsh's charge
of a smear campaign, Sandy Mc-
Kenzie, campaign manager for
Bud Wcdin, stated that the ditto
sheets were printed up and dis
tributed not as fact sheets hut as
background material on Walsh
for Wedin supporters. “The in
formation was taken directly
from The Daily article.”
Ned Borgstrom, who wrote the
ditto sheet, claims “the sheet is a
direct quotation from the first
six paragraphs of the article en
titled, ‘Opinions Differ on Parti
san Politics.’ This article stated
the questions proposed by Walsh
and then moved directly to dis
cussing Jim Woolsey’s ideas. It
made no further reference to
Walsh’s questions. Rather, he
sets those questions in contrast
to Woolsey’s position. It there
fore strikes me as unreasonable
to assert that these questions
were ‘pulled out of context’ and
made to ‘appear as his views.’
Both the article and the sheet
leaves each individual to draw r his
own conclusions, and since the
‘questions’ were never denied by
Mr. Walsh, it seems fair to attrib
ute them to him.”

> — . —— .
CONCLUDING the statement,
McKenzie said “The ditto sheet
was not a misrepresentation of
Walsh’s statements as they ap
peared in The Daily. Any misrep
resentation of Walsh was done by
the reporter.”
Walsh also stated his platform
in the short KZSU speech. He
elavuated this year’s student gov
ernment at Stanford and cited
great gains of student voice in
University policy; however, he
warned that we as students “may
be in danger of sacrificing our
ends to our means.” Ultimatum,
he later said, is not the answer.
“Often the threat of power and
pressure is more effective than
the pressure itself.
“Next year we must continue
to work in the area of student
rights,” he said. He suggested
having student issues presented
to the administration in a peti
tion signed by 5 per cent of the
student body to be submitted to
the Student Affairs Committee,
which meets four times a year.
WALSH ALSO suggested a re
view of academic issues, an “as
sociate program” to enhance so
cial integration of foreign stu
dents, a “Speakers’ Bureau” to
co-ordinate speakers on campus,
and a “cabinet” of student leaders
to meet, perhaps, twice monthly.
Concerning LASSU, Walsh
feels that it should not speak out
on off-campus issues in the name
of the Associated Students but
rather that such opinions be ex
pressed by the newly formed Stu
dent Congress, under the condi
tion that the Congress state that
the views are not necessarily
those of the Associated Students
of Stanford University “because,”
explained Walsh, “students have
no choice about belonging to the
ASSU; membership dues arc
taken from tuition. Thus, by
speaking in the name of the
ASSU, LASSU is speaking for
students who do not necessarily
share their opinions.”

tions; they were not stated as be
ing my opinions.”
In response to Walsh's charge
of a smear campaign, Sandy Mc-
Kenzie, campaign manager for
Bud Wcdin, stated that the ditto
sheets were printed up and dis
tributed not as fact sheets hut as
background material on Walsh
for Wedin supporters. “The in
formation was taken directly
from The Daily article.”
Ned Borgstrom, who wrote the
ditto sheet, claims “the sheet is a
direct quotation from the first
six paragraphs of the article en
titled, ‘Opinions Differ on Parti
san Politics.’ This article stated
the questions proposed by Walsh
and then moved directly to dis
cussing Jim Woolsey’s ideas. It
made no further reference to
Walsh’s questions. Rather, he
sets those questions in contrast
to Woolsey’s position. It there
fore strikes me as unreasonable
to assert that these questions
were ‘pulled out of context’ and
made to ‘appear as his views.’
Both the article and the sheet
leaves each individual to draw r his
own conclusions, and since the
‘questions’ were never denied by
Mr. Walsh, it seems fair to attrib
ute them to him.”

CONCLUDING the statement,
McKenzie said “The ditto sheet
was not a misrepresentation of
Walsh’s statements as they ap
peared in The Daily. Any misrep
resentation of Walsh was done by
the reporter.”
Walsh also stated his platform
in the short KZSU speech. He
elavuated this year’s student gov
ernment at Stanford and cited
great gains of student voice in
University policy; however, he
warned that we as students “may
be in danger of sacrificing our
ends to our means.” Ultimatum,
he later said, is not the answer.
“Often the threat of power and
pressure is more effective than
the pressure itself.
“Next year we must continue
to work in the area of student
rights,” he said. He suggested
having student issues presented
to the administration in a peti
tion signed by 5 per cent of the
student body to be submitted to
the Student Affairs Committee,
which meets four times a year.
WALSH ALSO suggested a re
view of academic issues, an “as
sociate program” to enhance so
cial integration of foreign stu
dents, a “Speakers’ Bureau” to
co-ordinate speakers on campus,
and a “cabinet” of student leaders
to meet, perhaps, twice monthly.
Concerning LASSU, Walsh
feels that it should not speak out
on off-campus issues in the name
of the Associated Students but
rather that such opinions be ex
pressed by the newly formed Stu
dent Congress, under the condi
tion that the Congress state that
the views are not necessarily
those of the Associated Students
of Stanford University “because,”
explained Walsh, “students have
no choice about belonging to the
ASSU; membership dues arc
taken from tuition. Thus, by
speaking in the name of the
ASSU, LASSU is speaking for
students who do not necessarily
share their opinions.”
ASSU Presidential Candidate Mike Walsh claimed Wednes
day that “The Five Points of Mike Walsh,” a ditto sheet circulat
ing around campus, is a malicious misrepresentation of his views,
in a speech on KZSU.

The statements in the sheet, Walsh insisted, were taken out of

context from an article in a Feb--*
ruary Daily, quoted from a con
verstion which took place last
October. “These statements were
meant to be hypothetical ques
tions; they were not stated as be
ing my opinions.”
