## The 						Italian Elections 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Italian elections must be regarded as not quite decisive. For
much depends now on what happens this summer at the con
vention of Nenni’s Socialist Party. These are the Socialists who
used to be affiliated with the Communist Party, but since 1962
have been supporting the coalition led by the Christian Demo
crats.
There is a crisis in the making on the question of whether
the Nenni Socialists will divorce the Communists completely or
whether they will continue to collaborate with them in regional
politics. There has long been a bill pending in the Italian parlia
ment to grant what we would call states’ rights to each of the 19
regions of which Italy is composed. There are, however, two
regions, Emilia and Tuscany, where the Communists and the
Nenni Socialists combined would have an absolute majority. The
Fanfani government is not likely to pass the states’ rights bill
unless the Nenni Socialists promise not to form a governing
coalition with the Communists.
The critical question is whether Nenni can make this prom
ise and still hold his party together. If he cannot, the Fanfani
coalition government will be in grave danger.
While the outcome is not decisive, nevertheless it is true
that, while the Fanfani coalition has lost some seats in the par
liament, it is still very considerably stronger than any other com
bination which could be put together. If, for example, the Nenni
Socialists were excluded, either of the other conceivable com
binations would have only about 53 per cent of the seats as
against the 60 per cent which these elections have given to the
Fanfani coalition.
A somewhat closer study of the vote shows that there has
been a general movement to the left. Starting with the Commu
nists on the extreme left, we see that they gained about a mil
lion votes. Presumably the Communist gains come from those
Socialists who disapproved of Nenni’s arrangement with the
Christian Democrats. Yet, curiously enough, the Nenni Social
ists held steady. Their share of the popular vote is only one
third of 1 per cent lower than in 1958. If, indeed, they lost a mil
lion votes to the Communists, they must have gained about that
many from the Christian Democrats.
Moving another step to the right, the Saragat Democratic
Socialists, who have never collaborated with the Communists,
gained over half a million votes. These, too, must have come
from the Christian Democrats. All in all, the Christian Demo
crats lost a little more than a million votes, and the bulk of them
must have gone to the parties on the left. It is true that the
Conservative Party, which in Italy is called the Liberal Party,
and is comparable with the Eisenhower Republicans in this
country, made big gains. But these appear to have been at the
expense of the Monarchist Party on its own right. The Conserv
ative Liberals gained over a million votes, while the Monarchists
lost over a million votes. Thus there was no real gain on the
right, although the Neo-Fascists gained about 165,000 votes.
Parenthetically, it has been said that the Communist gains
must have come from the 1,750.000 young people who are the
new voters. The figures do not bear out this conclusion. The
electorate for the Chamber of Deputies begins at 21 years of
age. The electorate for the Senate begins at 25 years of age. The
new voters, therefore, were in the electorate of the Chamber
of Deputies and not in that of the Senate.
If it was these young people who swelled the Communist
vote, there should have been a greater Communist gain in the
Chamber of Deputies elections than in the Senate elections.
In fact, the contrary is true. The Communist gain was smaller
by 234,000 votes in the younger electorate than it was in the
older one. A slightly higher proportion of the older electorate
voted Communist than did the younger.
Speaking generally, the Italian elections show that a ma
joruy of the Italian voters are left of center. If it happens this
summer that the Nenni Socailists cannot detach themselves suc
cessfully from the old collaboration with the Communists the
governing coalition of the parliament will have to move from
the center-left to the center-right.
In all likelihood, this would bring about a renewal of those
weak governments which Fanfani has sought to overcome by
diawing the Nenni Socialists aw'ay from the Communists.

crats lost a little more than a million votes, and the bulk of them
must have gone to the parties on the left. It is true that the
Conservative Party, which in Italy is called the Liberal Party,
and is comparable with the Eisenhower Republicans in this
country, made big gains. But these appear to have been at the
expense of the Monarchist Party on its own right. The Conserv
ative Liberals gained over a million votes, while the Monarchists
lost over a million votes. Thus there was no real gain on the
right, although the Neo-Fascists gained about 165,000 votes.
Parenthetically, it has been said that the Communist gains
must have come from the 1,750.000 young people who are the
new voters. The figures do not bear out this conclusion. The
electorate for the Chamber of Deputies begins at 21 years of
age. The electorate for the Senate begins at 25 years of age. The
new voters, therefore, were in the electorate of the Chamber
of Deputies and not in that of the Senate.
If it was these young people who swelled the Communist
vote, there should have been a greater Communist gain in the
Chamber of Deputies elections than in the Senate elections.
In fact, the contrary is true. The Communist gain was smaller
by 234,000 votes in the younger electorate than it was in the

voted Communist than did the younger.
Speaking generally, the Italian elections show that a ma
joruy of the Italian voters are left of center. If it happens this
summer that the Nenni Socailists cannot detach themselves suc

governing coalition of the parliament will have to move from
the center-left to the center-right.

Italian elections must be regarded as not quite decisive. For
much depends now on what happens this summer at the con
vention of Nenni’s Socialist Party. These are the Socialists who
used to be affiliated with the Communist Party, but since 1962
have been supporting the coalition led by the Christian Demo
crats.
There is a crisis in the making on the question of whether
the Nenni Socialists will divorce the Communists completely or
whether they will continue to collaborate with them in regional
politics. There has long been a bill pending in the Italian parlia
ment to grant what we would call states’ rights to each of the 19
regions of which Italy is composed. There are, however, two
regions, Emilia and Tuscany, where the Communists and the
Nenni Socialists combined would have an absolute majority. The
Fanfani government is not likely to pass the states’ rights bill
unless the Nenni Socialists promise not to form a governing
coalition with the Communists.
The critical question is whether Nenni can make this prom
ise and still hold his party together. If he cannot, the Fanfani
coalition government will be in grave danger.
While the outcome is not decisive, nevertheless it is true
that, while the Fanfani coalition has lost some seats in the par
liament, it is still very considerably stronger than any other com
bination which could be put together. If, for example, the Nenni
Socialists were excluded, either of the other conceivable com
binations would have only about 53 per cent of the seats as
against the 60 per cent which these elections have given to the
Fanfani coalition.
A somewhat closer study of the vote shows that there has
been a general movement to the left. Starting with the Commu
nists on the extreme left, we see that they gained about a mil
lion votes. Presumably the Communist gains come from those
Socialists who disapproved of Nenni’s arrangement with the
Christian Democrats. Yet, curiously enough, the Nenni Social
ists held steady. Their share of the popular vote is only one
third of 1 per cent lower than in 1958. If, indeed, they lost a mil
lion votes to the Communists, they must have gained about that
many from the Christian Democrats.
Moving another step to the right, the Saragat Democratic
Socialists, who have never collaborated with the Communists,
gained over half a million votes. These, too, must have come
from the Christian Democrats. All in all, the Christian Demo
crats lost a little more than a million votes, and the bulk of them
must have gone to the parties on the left. It is true that the
Conservative Party, which in Italy is called the Liberal Party,
and is comparable with the Eisenhower Republicans in this
