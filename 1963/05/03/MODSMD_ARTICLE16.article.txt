## The
						Great Fear' in Latin America 
### ALLEN YOUNG 
(“The Great Fear: The Reconquest of Latin America by
Latin Americans,” by John Gerassi. New York. The .Macmillan
Company, 1963. 457 pp. $6.35.)
John Gerassi’s “The Great Fear" is a powerful book, often
brilliant, somestime polemical, about the impending revolution
in Latin America. This revolution, Mr. Gerassi argues, will be
made by Latin American nationalists committed to a basic trans
formation of the old order in Latin America —as he puts it,
“reconquest.” The nationalists are often opposed by the Com
munists, who call them adventurists. More significantly, the
nationalists are opposed by local oligarchs and by the United
States, who call them Communists.
The villain of this book is the United States, and the author
presents an impressive amount of evidence to prove that U.S.
policy is directed toward preserving the vested interests of
Americans in Latin America.
Admitting that in some cases the Alliance has made “gains,”
Mr. Gerassi stresses that these are not “changes.” The Alliance
has failed, he states, because of “its unending allegiance to pri
vate enterprise." He adds that “Latin America’s capitalists are
Just as unpreoccupied with its development as are ours.” In
several fact-laden chapters, he explains how U.S. and Latin
American businessmen drain the Latin American economies.
Mr. Gerassi explains why a truly nationalist revolution is
necessary, and he shows how the reforms of the so-called “demo
cratic left,” exemplarized by President Romulo Betancourt of
Venezuela, are inadequate. He calls Betancourt a “phony re
former,” and is equally unkind to Peru’s Victor Raul Haya de la
Torre and Costa Rica’s Jose Figueres.
In defining the nationalists, Mr. Gerassi avoids the term
“Fidelista," used by other writers, but indeed his nationalists
combine the defense of the Cuban Revolution with the call for
deep social change (and usually armed insurrection) at home.
There are a few weak spots in the analysis, the most im
portant of which is the author’s failure to consider the effect
of the ever-present U.S. military force on dampening revolu
tionary activity in Latin America, and to consider the possible
results of U.S. military action against such activity.
Mr. Gerassi makes a clear distinction between the Commu
nists (whom he accuses of being reactionary for their alliances
with non-revolutionary forces, despite their pro-Cuban rhetoric),
and the nationalists. He mentions the Brazilian nationalist, peas
ant leader Francisco Juliao, and states point blank that the
Communists oppose him. This is not entirely correct; in fact,
the Brazilian Communists have split in two, with one wing
joining Juliao and the nationalists. Ostensibly, similar debate is
taking place in the Communist camp throughout Latin America,
and although Mr. Gerassi’s overall evaluation of the Commu
nists is correct, he does not take into account the possibility of a
change in the Communist position and does not discuss the re
sultant effect on the nationalist movements.
Mr. Gerassi surveys contemporary politics in each of the
Latin American republics, and concludes the book with some
policy suggestions, which he admits are at least in part “unrea
listic” and “unrealizable.” They are—not because they are not
good policies, but because the United States is simply not pre
pared to permit Latin America to reconquer itself. The end of
the reconquest, Mr. Gerassi states, is Latin America’s “economic
independence, its balanced development, its industrialization, its
capacity of making its own moral, political and economic de
cisions—in sum, its need to limit our power in Latin America.”
He says that American policy as it now stands is designed to
protect “the profit of the few.” He makes his policy sugges
tions as “a friend of the United States” devoted to the conserva
tion of “our freedoms, our political structure, our rights, and
our personal safety.” His policy for reconquest is not incon
sistent with all of these. That the United States opposes recon
quest is perhaps one of the unhappiest testimonies to Cold War
America.
“The Great Fear” is an important book not only for its ex
cellent analysis of contemporary Latin America, but because it
is the first book to be written about Latin America as a whole
in terms of the aspirations of the national revolutionaries.
Mr. Gerassi successfully avoids the phraseology and cate
gories of Marxist writers (such as J. P. Morray) and of the
writers of the Liberal establishment (such as A. A. Berle, Jr.).
And although many Marxists will agree with Mr. Gerassi’s
analysis, it is significant that he did not reach his conclusions
as a Marxist.
The author really represents a new generation of Latin
Americanists. He is interested in the whole area, not only in
Cuba, which separates him from authors such as Theodore
Draper and William Appleman Williams. He has no sentimental
attachment to the “democratic left,” which separates him from
writers such as Robert Alexander and Harry Kantor.
Mr. Gerassi, a Time correspondent and editor from 1957 to
1961, has also worked for the Baltimore Sun and The New York
Times. (The Times, by the way, comes in for some bitter criti
cism, in the book, some of it valid, but most of it petty.) Most
recently, he has written articles for the New Republic.
