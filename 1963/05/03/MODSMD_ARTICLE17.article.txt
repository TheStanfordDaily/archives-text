Editors, The Daily:
Although we support the Publications Board decision in
regards to denial of support for The Bridge on .grounds of this
magazine’s unrealistic aims and 'demands for excessive Under
writing, we do take issue with Charles Landis’s statement that
“legitimate, well-planned enterprises have hevei' lacked the
Board’s active support and encouragement.” The case in point
concerns a request for publication of an off-campus newspaper
devoted to the expression of student opinion. Denial of publica
tion rights for this paper, to be know as The Lip, was based
primarily upon the staff’s alleged inability to avoid “personal
bias and editorial opinion” (key aspects of a free press) and
upon the competition which would be offered to already existing
on-campus publications in the field of advertising.
Supporters of The Lip did show that they were proposing
both a legitimate (on the basis of a free press) and well-planned
publication without any demand for underwriting on the part
of the Board or the University. Yet, because of inadequate
notification of times and places for meetings (in one case The
Lip editors were not called until five minutes after the meeting
began), insufficient time allotted for presentation of The Lip’s
position, and, in one case, open denial of the right to present a
rebuttal to objections, the proposal was rushed through Pub
Board and, unknown to The Lip supporters, through Legisla
ture without fair consideration.
What the facts boil down to is that the Publications Board
(consisting of a few individuals who are not elected by a majority
of the student body nor appointed by elected officials) has,
through power given it in the by-laws, set itself up as a monop
olistic body which refuses to grant the rights of free competi
tion and a free press on the basis of its own personal concerns.
It sems then that the issue with which we are here con
cerned is one of the basic philosophy behind student government
in this university. Can we be satisfied with the present system
with its power cliques, where the only way the individual may
voice an opinion is to work himself directly into such a clique?
Can we continue to operate a government without examining
and taking definite stands upon the principles behind govern
ment? Or must we re-evaluate the concepts of a free press and
free competition in relation to our “community” and the philoso
phy of representation as opposed to finality of decision in oli
garchical bodies?

In behalf of the Stanford YWCA I wish to express sincere
thanks to the many people who helped to make this year’s
Strawberry Brunch such a success. Approximately $650 was
raised which is far beyond our anticipated pledge to the Sanyu
Baby Home in Oganda. I would especially like to thank my com
mittee chairmen, Chick Sullivan, Joan Ellis, Ann Malchior,
Mary Ellen Hoy. Chris Vaughn, Val Olander and Sara Knox.
I wish also to thank the many merchants who donated their
products: Dolly Madison Bakery, Stickney’s, El Real Bakery,
Peninsula Creamery, Allied Produce, Tarantino’s, Bruce’s Cookie
Jar, Marcel’s Bakery, Pier’s Creamery, Colonial Bakeries, Pink
Pastry Shoppe, All-American Market, Kristine’s Bakery. El
Camino Supply, Liddicoat Market and McCauley and Richards
Food Market.

Editors, The Daily:
Although we support the Publications Board decision in
regards to denial of support for The Bridge on .grounds of this
magazine’s unrealistic aims and 'demands for excessive Under
writing, we do take issue with Charles Landis’s statement that
“legitimate, well-planned enterprises have hevei' lacked the
Board’s active support and encouragement.” The case in point
concerns a request for publication of an off-campus newspaper
devoted to the expression of student opinion. Denial of publica
tion rights for this paper, to be know as The Lip, was based
primarily upon the staff’s alleged inability to avoid “personal
bias and editorial opinion” (key aspects of a free press) and
upon the competition which would be offered to already existing
on-campus publications in the field of advertising.
Supporters of The Lip did show that they were proposing
both a legitimate (on the basis of a free press) and well-planned
publication without any demand for underwriting on the part
of the Board or the University. Yet, because of inadequate
notification of times and places for meetings (in one case The
Lip editors were not called until five minutes after the meeting
began), insufficient time allotted for presentation of The Lip’s
position, and, in one case, open denial of the right to present a
rebuttal to objections, the proposal was rushed through Pub
Board and, unknown to The Lip supporters, through Legisla
ture without fair consideration.
What the facts boil down to is that the Publications Board
(consisting of a few individuals who are not elected by a majority
of the student body nor appointed by elected officials) has,
through power given it in the by-laws, set itself up as a monop
olistic body which refuses to grant the rights of free competi
tion and a free press on the basis of its own personal concerns.
It sems then that the issue with which we are here con
cerned is one of the basic philosophy behind student government
in this university. Can we be satisfied with the present system
with its power cliques, where the only way the individual may
voice an opinion is to work himself directly into such a clique?
Can we continue to operate a government without examining
and taking definite stands upon the principles behind govern
ment? Or must we re-evaluate the concepts of a free press and
free competition in relation to our “community” and the philoso
phy of representation as opposed to finality of decision in oli
garchical bodies?

In behalf of the Stanford YWCA I wish to express sincere
thanks to the many people who helped to make this year’s
Strawberry Brunch such a success. Approximately $650 was
raised which is far beyond our anticipated pledge to the Sanyu
Baby Home in Oganda. I would especially like to thank my com
mittee chairmen, Chick Sullivan, Joan Ellis, Ann Malchior,
Mary Ellen Hoy. Chris Vaughn, Val Olander and Sara Knox.
I wish also to thank the many merchants who donated their
products: Dolly Madison Bakery, Stickney’s, El Real Bakery,
Peninsula Creamery, Allied Produce, Tarantino’s, Bruce’s Cookie
Jar, Marcel’s Bakery, Pier’s Creamery, Colonial Bakeries, Pink
Pastry Shoppe, All-American Market, Kristine’s Bakery. El
Camino Supply, Liddicoat Market and McCauley and Richards
