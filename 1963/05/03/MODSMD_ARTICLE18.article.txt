# Cards Try for 100 Points in Big Meet
## 
### PETE KING 
The strongest Stanford track
team in several years travels to
Berkeley tomorrow for what
could be its greatest Big Meet
victory ever in the 70-year history
of the Indian-Bear classic. Field
events start at 1 p.m., and track
events at 1 ;30 in Cal’s Edwards
Stadium.
THE TWO freshman teams will
battle it out with field events be

ginning at It a.m. and each run
ning event preceding the varsity
event beginning at 1:20 p.m.
Stanford leads the Big Meet
series, 33-32, with two ties. The
Tribe won last year. 88 1 ;i-42*a,
breaking a five-year Cal domina
tion. The highest previous Stan
ford total was 101 % in 1931.
Stanford has shown itself to he
among the top four teams in the
eountry this year, while Cal’s
Golden Bears, so powerful a few
years baek, have become a bit
tarnished of late, and it will take
a supreme effort by the Bears to
overcome the Tribe might.
The dope sheet shows Stanford
winning, 95-50, but the Indians
could score over 100 points, and
if the Bears can score as many
as 60 points, it will be a moral
victory for them.
CAL COACH Brutus Hamilton
lias said of his team, “We’re thin
and we’re hurting.” Hamilton is
perennially pessimistic going in
to the Big Meet, but this year his
statement seems to be justified
by performances.
The Bears are weak in the dis
tances, somewhat thin in the
sprints, and fair in the hurdles.
They will pile up most of their
points in the field events, where
they boast a 6-8 high jumper, a

56-foot shot putter, and a 48-foot |
triple jumper.
The top duels of the afternoon !
will probably occur in the mile,!
high hurdles, and mile relay.
Cal’s John Hatton has a 4:10.2:
best in the mile against Card I
Harlan Andrews’ 4:09.8. Harry j
MeCalla. who has run a 4:01.5
this year, will he competing only
in the two-mile, where he will be;
trying to break his own Stanford i
record of 8:52.7.
VERSATILE Steve Cortright
could pick up three firsts for
Stanford, but it won’t be easy.
Cal’s Bill Sprague has run 14.6 in :
the high hurdles to challenge j
Cortright’s 14.3, and triple jump-1
er Todd Gaskill has a best only a j
quarter-inch behind Cortright’s
48-6 : h effort last week. In his
other event, the intermediate
hurdles, Cortright should lead a
possible Indian 1-2-3 sweep.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan j
has entered Ken Emanuels, Phil;
Lamoreaux, Rich Chesarek, and
Bob Miltz in the mile relay. They j
have a better time than Cal, but |
if the meet does down to the re
lay, Cal anchor man Dave Archi
bald will provide the Bears with a 1
blazing finish and a good chance
for a win.
A total of nine meet records |
are in danger (six fell in last j
year’s meet), anti the man who j
has the best chance to break two |
of them is Stanford’s Larry Que-1
stad. The powerful sophomore |
sprinter has a 9.5 to his credit j
in the 100, and a 21.4 in the j
curved 220, while the records are j
9.5 and 21.7, respectively. Last j
week at the Drake Relays, Que- j
stad ran a blistering 20.2 leg for j
the Tribe 880 relay team. He ■
should beat Dale Rubin (9.8) and i
Dave Archibald (21.9).
IN THE 880 and two-mile the I
Bears will be lucky to take one j
third place. Bob Miltz (1:51.4),
Bill Pratt (1:51.5), and Robin Ru
ble (1:52.2), figure to sweep the
half-mile and with MeCalla lead

ing the way in possibly under
8:30, a 1-2 finish in the eight
lapper is probable.
In (he rest of the field events.
Stanford’s Dave Weill < 194-6) is
a shoo-in in the discus, as are
Cal’s Roger Olsen (6-8t in the
high jump and Neil Schmidt
(213-7) in the javelin. Inconsis
tent fifteen-foot pole vaulter Phil
White should top Cal’s 14-foot op
position, and Stanford’s Dan
1 Moore should ulbroad jump 24
feet for the first time this year
i to win.
A three-way battle will be on in
i the shot put, with Cal’s Matt Bag
gett t r>6-9 1 l; ) favored. However,
Stanford’s Steve Arch (36-4) and
improving Jack Chappie (55-B‘a)
i are close enough to challenge the
hefty Bear.
.MOST OF THE close meet ex
j citement will be provided by the
| frosh. but Stanford rooters had
better arrive at 11 a.m. for the
i field events, because the Tribe
I yearlings could win every one of
j them. However, Cal’s tremendous
| running strength, led by sprinter
| Forrest Beaty, should be enough
i to nearly equal Stanford’s early
1 point bulge.
I The dope sheet shows a Stan
| ford victory, 77-68, but come
| through performances could give
j it to Cal. Dave Deubner of Stan
| ford is way ahead of Cal men in
j the mile and two-mile with 4:13.5
and 9:18.1 clockings. Bill Klip
pert’s 1:56.5 half-mile time is
] barely ahead of Cal’s Harry
j Cross, at 1:57, and Card Tyler
j Wilkin and Bear Ron Gould have
j identical 15,5 times in the high
| hurdles.
OTHER THAN that, Cal should
sweep both dashes and win both
| relays for 28 valuable points.
! Stanford will counter with a javo-
I lin sweep and a 1-2 finish in the
| high jump. Bob Stoecker in the
j discus and shot put, Chuck Smith
j in the pole vault, and John Goode
in the broad and triple jumps are
1 favored to win.

KC'BS Radio will carry re-
I»orts on the Big Meet Inter
niittently starting at 2:10 to
morrow.
