# 'Big Ball Games' This Weekend
## 
### GIENN ALFORD 
A Stanford baseball team fight
ing for its life in a very close
CIBA race faces the University
of California twice this weekend.
The Indians meet Cal today at 3
p.m. in Sunken Diamond and to
morrow at 3 p.m. in Berkeley.
The Indians (5-4 in league
play) are third, half a game be
hind league-leading USC (6-41
and UCLA (7-5). Santa Clara
(7-6) is also half a game behind.
California (2-Hi is out of conten
tion.
COACH Dutch Fehring will
start his two top pitchers against
the Bears, right-handers Darrell
Sutherland (4-2 1 and Jim Lon
borg (6-4*. Sutherland will pitch
this afternoon with Lonborg
throwing tomorrow. Lonborg
beat the Bearâ€™s twice last year,
while Sutherland lost a pair of
heart-breakers to Cal.
The Indians are now 20-7 after
heating nationally ranked Pep
perdine Tuesday. The Indians
knocked the winningest pitcher in
college baseball out of the box
and kept Dick Kovacevich unde
feated in five decisions. Should
Stanford beat the Bears twice, a
move into the top twenty in col
lege baseball ratings is likely.
THE BEARS played a double
header against USC Tuesday and
they decided to save their best
pitchers for Stanford. Larry Col
ton will oppose Lonborg today,
while Dave Dowling is to pitch
tomorrow. Outfielders Dave My
ers and Mike Epstein, and short
stop George McCarn lead the
Bears at the plate.
