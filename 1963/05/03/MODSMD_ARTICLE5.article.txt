protested to Haiti against abuses of diplomatic immunity yesterday

American and Brazilian complaints involved the hailing and search
ing of diplomatic vehicles by heavily armed Haitian troops. In Wash
ington, the State Department accused the Duvalicr regime of in
flaming the situation in the tiny Caribbean country as “potentially
explosive.” A fact-finding committee of the Organization of Ameri
can States sent here to ease Haitian-Dominican tensions ended a
three-day inquiry into (he dispute and prepared to leave for Santo
Domingo, en route back to Washington to make a formal report.
Thus, as the direct confrontation between Haiti and the Dominican

TWO AMERICANS SCALE EVEREST—KATMANDU, Nepal—An
American expedition said yesterday that two of its climbers had
reached the summit of Mt. Everest, the first victory in a quest for
a Himalayan triple crown for the United States. The American ex
pedition still has two major goals to scale Everest’s sister peaks
before the end of the month. One of them.lhotse, at 27.890 feet is the
world’s fourth highest mountin. The other is 25,850 feet high Nuptse.
Never before has one expedition attempted to conquer all three.
The expedition, the dream of explorer Norman G. Dyhrenfurth, of
Santa Monica, Calif., probably is the best organized and financed
ever to venture to the once-forbidden peaks of the world's highest
mountains.
