# FM SERVICE PLANNED
## KZSU Expands Staff and Programs 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
“Voice of Diversity. Radio Stanford.”
On-the-air “promos” such as this are one of the
ways KZSU is increasing interest in its expanding
radio format. Since (he start of the school year,
Stanford’s radio station has doubled its staff—to
over eighty, making it (he largest activity credit
group on campus- and increased its broadcasting,
both in scope and length of time on the air.
The station now broadcasts from 4 p.m. to 12
midnight Monday through Friday and from 1:30
to 11 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Resides the
weekend programming, which began last quarter.
KZSU now' features coverage of special campus
events of student interest, such as the recent Con
Home Hydrofollies, broadcast in part, with a wire
less mike from a motorboat on Lake Lag.
THE EXPANSION of broadcasting is shown in
the now format, which, according to station man
ager Ken Byram, “is not designed to appeal con
sistently to a certain group of listeners. Rather,
each program is designed to appeal to a select
group who are interested in its subject and pro
gramming material.
Byram feels KZSU has advantages over com
mercial stations, most of which “must broadcast
to offend the fewest number of people in a wide
audience,” because the Stanford station is ap
pealing to a select group and can design special
ized programming to have “something for every
one” in that limited group. “We’re trying to
orient our programming to the many, diversified
needs of the campus,” says Byram .

Also in tho expansion plans is a future FM
channel, to broadcast the same programs hoard
on AM on a ten-watt educational band. Commer
cials would be deleted from the FM portion of the
broadcast, as the FCC does not allow any adver
tisements on educational stations. In operation
“possibly by next spring,’’ the FM channel will
transmit over a five-mile radius from an antenna
on fop of Memorial Auditorium, The proposal for
the channel will be presented to the presidential
committee on communications, probably next fall.
THE ADVENT of the FM channel, and thus a
wider broadcasting area, would probably mean
stricter control over programming, at least for a
while, according to Byram. Now, oven though it
is under the nominal control of tho communica
tions department and received an $lBOO operating
funds grant from the University three years ago.
KZSU is independent of faculty or administration
al restrictions and operates on funds derived from
the sale of advertisements.
The station is entirely student-run, with the
exception of the “Flinthill Special’’ (Tuesday at
9 p.m.). a show featuring the two sponsors of the
Top of the Tangent, a Palo Alto coffee house.
The station’s biggest problem, and one which
would be at least partially eliminated by having
the FM channel, is its limited broadcasting range.
The KZSU signal is transmitted by “carrier cur
rent.” The broadcasts are fed into power lines
leading to dorms, some row' houses, and recently
the clusters. With the FM channel, KZSU w'ould
reach the rest of the row, faculty homes, and off
campus students.
