# PATRIOTISM MUST BE TAUGHT
## Progressive Education Slights Basic Skills, Rafferty Charges 
### CHUCK McBRIAN 
Education is no longer a non-controversial subject, Dr. Max
Rafferty, California State Superintendent of Education, told a Stan
ford audience yesterday at Memorial Auditorium. Today, ho said,
education is blamed for almost everything, from lurid comics to the
shortage of engineers. “We can’t

even come up with a non-contro
versial definition of education."
Time was when education was
considered well-defined in terms
of elevation of the public mind
and tastes, preparation for par
ticipation in public life, and the
“liberal” ideal, Rafferty said.
Then “progressive” education
came into vogue—an unfortunate
use of the term “progress!vism,”
since progressive education has
“no demonstrable relationship
with political progressivism,” he
continued.
PROGRESSIVE education was
the product of a reaction against
classicism, lower moral stan
dards and the influence of the to
talitarian concept of socialized
man, ho said. Progressivism re
jected the liberal ideal of learning
for its own sake and propounded
an educational philosophy based
on “adjustment,” discouraging
both competition and non-con
formity. Progressive educators
are generally in favor of auto- -
matic promotion and against giv
ing of grades and ability-group
ing.
Rafferty charged that progres
sive education has eroded mas- i
tery of basic skills, knowledge of
great cultures, and reverence for
our nation’s heroes. Competence
in the English language has suf
fered under the influence of
“those who think it authoritarian
to impose middle class speech
patterns on lower class children,
that a child should have the same
language standards as his peers
lest he be rejected by his more
colloquial and less liberate play
mates.”
RAFFERTY outlined his own
philosophy of education—“educa
tion in depth,” which is commit
ted to the idea that certain things
and subject-matters are of lasting
imporatnee and that “education
exists for the sake of the true,
the beautiful, and the good.”
Rafferty decried the rift that
| has developed between teachers
j and the public. Professional edu
cators have not paid enough at
j tention to public demands for the
| teaching of basic skills and pa
j triotism. he said. When these de
j mands are met, “the teacher will
be respected as a scholar and a
j subject-matter expert.” largely
j eliminating public opposition to
■ higher teachers’ salaries.
