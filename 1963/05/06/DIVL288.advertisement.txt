HOW TO SEE EUROPE
FOR ONLY $3OO A DAY: NO. 1
Summer vacation is just around the corner, and naturally all
of you are going to Europe. Perhaps I can offer a handy tip
or two. (I must confess that I myself have never been to
Euro|x», but I do have a French poodle and a German shepherd,
so I am not entirely unqualified.)
First let me say that no trip to Euro]*; is complete without
a visit to England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, Germany,
Spain, Portugal, Italy, Lichtenstein, Holland, Belgium, Luxem
bourg, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Po
land, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Russia,
Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, Crete, Sardinia, Sicily, Hungary,
Rumania, Bulgaria, Lapland, and Andorra.

The capital of England is London—or Liverpool, as it is
sometimes called. There are many interesting things to see in
London—chiefly the changing of the guards. The guards are
changed daily. The old ones are thrown away.
Another “must” while in Ixmdon is a visit to the palace of
the Duke of Marlborough. Marlborough is spelled Marlborough,
but pronounced Marlboro. English spelling is very quaint, but
terribly disorganized. The late George Bernard Shaw, author
of Little Women, fought all his life to simplify English spelling.
They tell a story about Shaw once asking a friend, “What docs
g-h-o-t-i spell?”
The friend pondered a bit and replied, “Goatee.”
Shaw sniggered. “Pshaw,” said Shaw. “G-h-o-t-i docs not
six'll goatee. It spells fish.”
“How is that?” said the friend.
Shaw answered, “Gh as in enough, o as in women, li as in
motion. Put them all together, you get fish."
This was very clever of Shaw when you consider that he was
a vegetarian. And a good thing he was. As Disraeli once re
marked to Guy Fawkes, “If Shaw were not a vegetarian, no
lamb chop in Ixmdon would be safe.”
But 1 digress. We were speaking of the palace of the I hike of
Marlborough—or Marlboro, as it is called in the United States.
It is called Marlboro by every smoker who enjoys a fine, rich
breed of tobaccos, who appreciates a pure white filter, who likes
a soft pack that is really solt, a Flip-Top box that really flips.
Be sure you are well supplied with Marl boros when you make
your trip abroad. After a long, tiring day of sightseeing there
is nothing so welcome as a good flavorful Marlboro and a foot
bath with hot Epsom salts.
Epsom salts can be obtained in England at Epsom Downs.
Kensington salts can be obtained at Kensington Gardens,
Albert salts can be obtained at Albert Hall, Hyde salts can be
obtained at Hyde Park, and the crown jewels can be obtained
at the Tower of Ixmdon.
The guards at the Tower of Ixmdon are called Beefeaters
because they are always beefing about what they get to cat.
This is also known as “cricket” or “petrol.”
Well, I guess that about covers England. In next week s
column we will visit the Land of the Midnight Sun—France.

a soft pack that is really solt, a Flip-Top box that really flips.
Be sure you are well supplied with Marl boros when you make
your trip abroad. After a long, tiring day of sightseeing there
is nothing so welcome as a good flavorful Marlboro and a foot
bath with hot Epsom salts.
Epsom salts can be obtained in England at Epsom Downs.
Kensington salts can be obtained at Kensington Gardens,
Albert salts can be obtained at Albert Hall, Hyde salts can be
obtained at Hyde Park, and the crown jewels can be obtained
at the Tower of Ixmdon.
The guards at the Tower of Ixmdon are called Beefeaters
because they are always beefing about what they get to cat.
This is also known as “cricket” or “petrol.”
Well, I guess that about covers England. In next week s
column we will visit the Land of the Midnight Sun—France.

HOW TO SEE EUROPE
FOR ONLY $3OO A DAY: NO. 1
Summer vacation is just around the corner, and naturally all
of you are going to Europe. Perhaps I can offer a handy tip
or two. (I must confess that I myself have never been to
Euro|x», but I do have a French poodle and a German shepherd,
so I am not entirely unqualified.)
First let me say that no trip to Euro]*; is complete without
a visit to England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, Germany,
Spain, Portugal, Italy, Lichtenstein, Holland, Belgium, Luxem
bourg, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Po
land, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Russia,
Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, Crete, Sardinia, Sicily, Hungary,
Rumania, Bulgaria, Lapland, and Andorra.

The capital of England is London—or Liverpool, as it is
sometimes called. There are many interesting things to see in
London—chiefly the changing of the guards. The guards are
changed daily. The old ones are thrown away.
Another “must” while in Ixmdon is a visit to the palace of
the Duke of Marlborough. Marlborough is spelled Marlborough,
but pronounced Marlboro. English spelling is very quaint, but
terribly disorganized. The late George Bernard Shaw, author
of Little Women, fought all his life to simplify English spelling.
They tell a story about Shaw once asking a friend, “What docs
g-h-o-t-i spell?”
The friend pondered a bit and replied, “Goatee.”
Shaw sniggered. “Pshaw,” said Shaw. “G-h-o-t-i docs not
six'll goatee. It spells fish.”
“How is that?” said the friend.
Shaw answered, “Gh as in enough, o as in women, li as in
motion. Put them all together, you get fish."
This was very clever of Shaw when you consider that he was
a vegetarian. And a good thing he was. As Disraeli once re
marked to Guy Fawkes, “If Shaw were not a vegetarian, no
lamb chop in Ixmdon would be safe.”
But 1 digress. We were speaking of the palace of the I hike of
Marlborough—or Marlboro, as it is called in the United States.
It is called Marlboro by every smoker who enjoys a fine, rich
breed of tobaccos, who appreciates a pure white filter, who likes
a soft pack that is really solt, a Flip-Top box that really flips.
