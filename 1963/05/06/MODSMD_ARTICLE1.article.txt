# Card Squad Smothers Cal 92-53; Weill Sets NCAA Discus Record
## 
### FETE KING 
Stanford’s talented young trackmen asserted their complete dominance over California for
the second straight year by overwhelming the Golden Bears, 92-53, in the Big Meet at Berkeley
Saturday,
Promise of an even bigger victory next year came when the Tribe freshmen piled up a 53-10
lead in the field events and coasted to a 79-66 win over the Bear yearlings, to avenge last year’s
75 % -35 '.-i loss.

It was the highest point total
run up against the Bears by Stan
ford in 30 years, and marked
Stanford coach Payton Jordan’s
second Big Meet victory in his
seven-year reign. Stanford now
leads in the 68-year history of the
meet, 34-32. with two ties.
Although the poor track and
cold wind kept the runners from
turning in outstanding times, the
men who jump, vault, and throw
things had a field day. An NCAA,
a Stanford, and a Cal record were
set, and five Stanford varsity and
seven frosh field men had best
personal or season marks.
High point of the meet was a
193-2 discus toss by Stanford’s
Dave Weill. The 270-pound senior
erased his own NCAA record dis
tance of 191-7'g, set last year.
Weill's 194-6 toss earlier at UCLA
was disallowed because of a slop
ing field.
