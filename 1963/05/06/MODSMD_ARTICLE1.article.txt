# Card Squad Smothers Cal 92-53; Weill Sets NCAA Discus Record
## 
### FETE KING 
Stanford’s talented young trackmen asserted their complete dominance over California for
the second straight year by overwhelming the Golden Bears, 92-53, in the Big Meet at Berkeley
Saturday,
Promise of an even bigger victory next year came when the Tribe freshmen piled up a 53-10
lead in the field events and coasted to a 79-66 win over the Bear yearlings, to avenge last year’s
75 % -35 '.-i loss.

It was the highest point total
run up against the Bears by Stan
ford in 30 years, and marked
Stanford coach Payton Jordan’s
second Big Meet victory in his
seven-year reign. Stanford now
leads in the 68-year history of the
meet, 34-32. with two ties.
Although the poor track and
cold wind kept the runners from
turning in outstanding times, the
men who jump, vault, and throw
things had a field day. An NCAA,
a Stanford, and a Cal record were
set, and five Stanford varsity and
seven frosh field men had best
personal or season marks.
High point of the meet was a
193-2 discus toss by Stanford’s
Dave Weill. The 270-pound senior
erased his own NCAA record dis
tance of 191-7'g, set last year.
Weill's 194-6 toss earlier at UCLA
was disallowed because of a slop
ing field.

which he set last year. He ran
the first mile in a fine 4.23, hut
successive laps of 70, 71, and 72
seconds eliminated his chances.
At the finish he was a lonely
man. half a lap ahead of Cal’s Art

! foot.
j Cal was figured to sweep the

[toss into the wind to take second

best by seven feet. Another come

tered by Sheridan Downey, who

Stanford's Dan Moore won the
event at 24-10%, the first time
this season he has exceeded 24
feet.
JAY MARIK had his finest day

Stanford could have scored over
100 points if it weren’t for two
unexpected losses in the relays.

j Bob Miltz ran fine legs of 49.4

THE SLIM C ROWD of 4000 was
treated to a neat bit of strategy
in the mile. Stanford runners

i John Beck, and Weym Kirkland
j put a four-man wall around hap
less Cal miler John Hatton for
3% laps, forcing him to run at
