# Freshman Integration
## 
### 
It lias been charged that the Stanford student body as a
whole is apathetic toward student activities, elections, public
expression of opinion, and other campus issues. This apathy
is no doubt due to a multitude of causes, but it would seem
that the most serious of these is the failure of students to
identify themselves with what is actually happening on cam
pus through a lack of information as well as of enthusiasm.
From a freshman point of view, this situation might be im
proved by a change in the way students are housed. To strike
at student apathy where it begins, in the freshman year, fresh
men should be housed in dorms where there are at least as
many upperclassmen as ther are freshmen.
At present over three-fourths of the freshman class live
for the whole of their first year in one of the all-freshman
dorms, Wilbur, Branner, or Roble. Undoubtedly this plan is
more convenient. But its major justification is that fresh
men find it easier to adjust to the more confusing aspects of
college life when surrounded by others w ho are going through
the same adjustment period, taking the same courses, having
similar problems. This is simply not so. Problems of getting
used to the new situation aren’t solved by being in company
with a group of equally confused freshmen.
At present integration into the Stanford community for
the new class is made easier by means of sponsors. The bene
fits a freshman derives from his sponsor—exposure to a more
mature point of view, experience, information, and advice—
would be concentrated by increasing the number of upper
classmen in a dormitory. Upperclassmen have been at Stan
ford for at least a year. They are familiar with the area. They
have taken courses in various fields and can talk about the
good points or the difficulties in the department of their
major field, and can recommend certain teachers or lectur
ers because they have had courses from them or are ac
quainted with their reputations. They can use their wider
experience to make discussions more interesting.
because of their physical isolation freshmen are often also
emotionally and academically isolated from the rest of the
campus, which is already isolated enough from the rest of
the world. The separate housing of freshmen, despite its ap
parent advantages of convenience and help in adjustment,
actually deprives them of all the information and ideas and
advice from upperclassmen, all of which would make adjust
ment a simpled process.
In addition, a housing plan of the type already used in
Stern to some extent, by integrating the freshmen, would en
courage their participation in student activities. What better
way to find out what the current ASSU officers and Legisla
ture are doing or how they compare to last year’s than listen
ing to an informed discussion, and what better way to find
out if the Poli Union caucuses or Ram’s Head or any other ac
tivity is worth working for than to talk to someone who is
already a member?
1 here would of course be many difficulties in converting
any of the existing dorms over to an all-class plan. However,
the PACE program includes plans for a series of undergradu
ate women’s residences to be located on the Knoll. Housing
freshmen as well as upperclass women in at least one of these
residences would not be difficult and could be a good be
ginning toward eventual integration of all freshmen with the
rest of the students.
