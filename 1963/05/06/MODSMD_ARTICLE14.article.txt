## Hell of a Way To Run a Railroad' 
### PHIL DEGUERE Associate Editor 
Th(> recent affair of the Peace Caucus vigilers versus the
Administration has apparently ended amicably, with every indi
cation that an effective compromise has been reached. The vigil
ers have seen “progress” in (heir cause, and are hopeful that the
result of their attempts at “non-violent” coercion will eventually
result in a greater student body voice in University affairs.
Similarly the Administration has had peace returned to the
campus, with no more nasty publicity.
That the student body endorsed the aims (if not the
methods) of the vigilers is attested to by the large response to
the petition circulated last week, also calling for more student
participation in Administration policy making. Those students
who were not overly sympathetic with the pacifistic aims of the
Peace Caucus were sufficiently moved (or annoyed) by the
Administration’s response to lend their support to the movement.
But this whole business has brought to light once again one
of the most serious faults of the University. It is a fault which
has been present since the University began, and although grad
ually, year by year, steps are being taken to alleviate it. the
progress is obviously not fast enough for some. Students have
more voice in Administration affairs today than ever before, but
they still have nowhere near enough. And surely by now the
Administration must have realized that if it wants to avoid such
demonstrations as vigils in the future, it will have to grant the
students this voice.
It has been said (hat Stanford is run by committees, an old
American tradition which de Tocqueville noticed way back in the
beginning of the last century. It has also been said that a very
significant step forward in the granting of student rights has
been the formation of various student-faculty committees in
which the two opposing forces can meet on neutral ground to
discuss their problems. This is of course very comforting to the
student body in general, to know that if they have an opinion
concerning University affairs they can submit it to the correct
representative and see if it makes its way through all the red
tape concomitant with such a system.
But student-faculty committees do nothing (or very little)
to remove the image the Administration has built up for itself,
and which it seems very loath to renounce. The image is that of
a group of men, more or less isolated from the student body,
sitting in an ivory tower and making the rules. Authority
trickles down from the tower through various deans to reach,
somewhat watered down, (he committees.
The ivory tower may lend a great deal of authority to the
policy makers, but it has a very detrimental effect on the stu
dents, for the more inaccessible these men are, the more the
students are made to feel that no matter how loudly they cry,
they will not be heard, or if heard, ignored, the more disinter
ested they will become. After all, why hold an opinion, why dis
cuss issues concerning the University, if such discussion leads
nowhere. There is a noun very familiar to Stanford students
which describes such a condition. It is apathy.
The apathy on the campus is very apparent and very dis
concerting. It greets the freshman soon after he first arrives
and stays with him until he leaves. It is the source of the ma
jority of standard campus jokes, like the one almost all fresh
men hear their first day on the Farm: “You’ll see the President
twice during your stay here, on the day you arrive and on the
day you leave.”
But it’s a great privilege to be at Stanford, the Adminis
tration tells us. Why do the students make so much trouble?
And yet surely it is not so hard to realize that the students are
very impressed with this privilege, cherish it, and want to make
the most of it. It is something of a hollow privilege to be al
lowed to take the courses, live in the dorms, walk around the
campus, and receive a diploma. The students would like to feel
a little more connection with the University than that.
The respect that comes from association with the officials
of an institution is far more effective than the authority of a
few men. the trustees and the president, whom the students
never see. If the day comes when the students accept this au
thority without comment, when they cease to have any interest
in Administration affairs, then the University will have what it
apparently wants: a group of students without the primary
characteristics of students, curiosity, imagination, energy, and
the spirit of a rebel.
