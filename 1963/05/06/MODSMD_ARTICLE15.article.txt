## Are the Vigilers Defeated? 
### PELL FENDER Associate Editor 
The Peace Caucus has suspended the vigil in front of Presi
dent Sterling’s office, acting maturely in hopes of prompting
the policy makers to debate the fallout shelter issue. But, hav
ing submitted the issue to the authority of (he policy makers,
the Peace Caucus is losing. For the policy makers have the
weapon of time; by delaying the Peace Caucus until the end of
the quarter, the policy makers hope to ignore its requests until
the autumn quarter, or (as we all know), more probably per
manently. i
The policy makers considered the Peace Caucus’ convic
tions a direct threat to their authority and, after the first night
of vigiling, dealt with this "threat” in a typically reactionary
method. Since the first few days of the vigil, however, the policy
makers have adopted a more sophisticated and effective strategy
towards the requests of the Peace Caucus: the policy makers
will w'ait out the Peace Caucus and, hopefully, the whole issue
will be forgotten.
And the issue is being forgotten. The belief of the policy
makers is that students are not mature enough to have a voice
in university affairs. While we as students should only be
concerned with getting an education, they, as administrators,
attend to policy. The students of this university, like the policy
makers, have accepted the fact that the two are divorced.
There are some students, however, who feel the desire for
a student voice in university affairs is a sign of maturity and
that, particularly at Stanford, there is a desperate lack of com
munication between generations. Perhaps such conviction as
the conviction of the Peace Caucus has been lacking to this uni
versity in the past, but, if this school year is any indication,
conviction is no longer foreign. In any case, the policy makers
are being extremely unrealistic in ignoring the issue.
The quarter is running out and, consequently, the fallout
shelter issue may never reach a debate. The irrestible force
has met the immovable object. The irresistible force is winning.
