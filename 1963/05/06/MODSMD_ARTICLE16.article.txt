## Class Government Controversy 
### 
Editors, The Daily:
This Wednesday the primary elections for ASSU offices are
to bo held. Since LASSU has been unable to act, the existing
By-Laws provisions for class government are still in effect.
Rightfully then, the elections for these offices should be hold as
originally scheduled.
But then the question arises, who will settle this issue and
when will it be settled? LASSU has been unable to meet to even
discuss the proposition. The only reasonable method would seem
to be to put this on the upcoming ballot for a vote by the stu
dents themselves.
I am not at all satisfied with the present state of class gov
ernment. It is unfortunate, however, that the energy devoted to
a crusade to abolish it could not have been used to improve the
organization. I do not believe (hat its elimination will solve any
thing. The apathy will still be present and we will have just one
less means of trying to do something about it.
I believe that the only answer at this late date is to hold
class elections and to elect officers who are interested and am
bitious enough to put into effect any changes and reforms which
are needed.
It is my hope, therefore, that students will initiate a peti
tion to place the issue itself on the ballot so that the continuance
of class government can be decided by the student body.
