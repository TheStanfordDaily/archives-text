# Card Horsehiders Split With Bears; Lonborg Wins Saturday Contest
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
The Stanford baseball team
played at being Jeckyl and Hyde
last weekend. The Tribe looked
as bad as a college baseball team
can look Friday in losing to Cali
fornia 5-4. In an abrupt about
face, the Indians played some of
their best baseball of 1963 in beat
ing the Bears 5-1 Saturday.
Jim Lonborg stopped the Bears
on eight hits in the latter contest
and received help from both his
mates 10 hits and Cal’s putrid
base-running.
CAL HAD three potential big
innings nipped by what can he

classified as either alert Indian
defense or stupid Bear base-run
ning. In the fourth frame Cal
scored its only run, but lost a big
chance to get a bundle more
when Mike Epstein was picked
off first base. Craig Morton fol
lowed with a single and then he
was caught stealing to retire the
side.
Stanford scored first. George
Thacher singled infield, one of
the six hits he got over the week
end, and went to second on Boh
Hollmann’s sacrifice bunt. War
ren Newell’s double drove him in.
Newell eventually scored on Joel
Shulrnan’s infield single.
LONBORG HELPED his own
cause in the sixth inning. He
walked with the bases loaded and
two out to force in Hollmann with
the third Card score.
Stanford’s last two runs scored
on Greg Post’s double, Thacher’s
single, a walk, a bunt and a pass
ed ball.
In the Friday contest, Stan
ford’s defense was bad, but their
hitting was worse. The Indians
committed five errors, and de
pended on an error with the bases
loaded, a stolen base and a throw
ing error, and two straight wild
pithces for their four runs.
C ARD HURLER Darrell Suth
erland was touched for only
seven hits and three walks, but
he was hit harder than this would
indicate. He frequently got two
strikes on the Cal batter only to
throw a fat pitch that could he
rapped for a hit.
This was particularly true in
Cal’s three-run fourth inning, My
ers and Epstein opened the frame
with singles, both with two
strikes on them. Sutherland wild
pitched them to second and third.
A sacrifice fly brought in one
run, Morton’s triple with two
strikes on him plated the second,
and an infield error let in the
third.
Cal got its winning run in the
seventh inning. Dick Hoover got
to second base on two errors and
scored on Myers’ single, his third
hit of the game, all with two
strikes on him.
Thacher rapped out six hits in
the weekend series, raising his
season’s average from ,298 to .333
and his CIBA average to .417.
Post hit safely four times and
now is hitting .337 to lead the
team.

base-running.
CAL HAD three potential big
innings nipped by what can he

classified as either alert Indian
defense or stupid Bear base-run
ning. In the fourth frame Cal
scored its only run, but lost a big
chance to get a bundle more
when Mike Epstein was picked
off first base. Craig Morton fol
lowed with a single and then he
was caught stealing to retire the
side.
Stanford scored first. George
Thacher singled infield, one of
the six hits he got over the week
end, and went to second on Boh
Hollmann’s sacrifice bunt. War
ren Newell’s double drove him in.
Newell eventually scored on Joel
Shulrnan’s infield single.
LONBORG HELPED his own
cause in the sixth inning. He
walked with the bases loaded and
two out to force in Hollmann with
the third Card score.
Stanford’s last two runs scored
on Greg Post’s double, Thacher’s
single, a walk, a bunt and a pass
ed ball.
In the Friday contest, Stan
ford’s defense was bad, but their
hitting was worse. The Indians
committed five errors, and de
pended on an error with the bases
loaded, a stolen base and a throw
ing error, and two straight wild
pithces for their four runs.
C ARD HURLER Darrell Suth
erland was touched for only
seven hits and three walks, but
he was hit harder than this would
indicate. He frequently got two
strikes on the Cal batter only to
throw a fat pitch that could he
rapped for a hit.
This was particularly true in
Cal’s three-run fourth inning, My
ers and Epstein opened the frame
with singles, both with two
strikes on them. Sutherland wild
pitched them to second and third.
A sacrifice fly brought in one
run, Morton’s triple with two
strikes on him plated the second,
and an infield error let in the
third.
Cal got its winning run in the
seventh inning. Dick Hoover got
to second base on two errors and
scored on Myers’ single, his third
hit of the game, all with two
strikes on him.
Thacher rapped out six hits in
the weekend series, raising his
season’s average from ,298 to .333
and his CIBA average to .417.
Post hit safely four times and
now is hitting .337 to lead the
team.

The Stanford baseball team
played at being Jeckyl and Hyde
last weekend. The Tribe looked
as bad as a college baseball team
can look Friday in losing to Cali
fornia 5-4. In an abrupt about
face, the Indians played some of
their best baseball of 1963 in beat
ing the Bears 5-1 Saturday.
Jim Lonborg stopped the Bears
on eight hits in the latter contest
and received help from both his
mates 10 hits and Cal’s putrid
base-running.
