# HUTCHINSON:
## Universities Stifle Faith in Religion 
### MARTHA MASKALL 
“Religious faith is stifled by
present-day universities,” stated
Professor Eric Hutchinson in his
Memorial Church sermon yester
day morning. Hutchinson, profes
sor of chemistry and chairman of
the Student Services and Affairs
Committee, agreed that the “chal
lenge to cherished beliefs is good
because they must be able to
stand up to questioning.” But he
added that a dialogue, which, by
challenging cherished beliefs, is
supposed to lead to synthesis, is
more often two monologues from
which neither participant bene
fits.
Hutchinson asserted that today
“those questioning youths are
not the concern of university fa
culty, the church, or parents.”
The faculty offers little guidance
in spiritual learning. The church,
instead of offering guidance to
questioning youth, caters to chil
dren still too young to doubt
their religion and to the very old.
Parents also shirk their respon
sibility by making an insufficient
attempt to inform about religion.
"... Silence ignorance ...”
He used as an example a bibli
cal cerse, I St. Peter 2:15, in
which St. Peter urges the Chris
tians to “put to silence the ignor
ance of foolish men.” This verse,
which Hutchinson termed “a mes
sage to a people subjected to the
propaganda and threats of the
shallow, ruthless, and faithless
Romans,” is applicable for today’s
students. In a university com
munity, he said, there is too lit
-1 le well-doing and altogether too
much ignorance and folly.
Hutchinson believes that there
is a growing religious concern
among students and that matters
of faith are no longer' regarded
trival.
