# West Lecturer Rabbi Heschel Searches Inner Nature of Man
## 
### ANN TODD 
Abraham Heschel, philosopher-author and professor of ethics
and mysticism at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America,
yesterday described man as a peculiar being trying to understand
his uniqueness, a being not in search of his origin but of his
destiny as the first answer to the question “Who Is Man?”—the

■topic of his series of three lec
tures.
Each generation tries to rede
fine man. “This generation,”
stated Heschel, “is failing more
miserably than it should in this
definition. Today we speak of
man as a machine, the human
machine. Is this all that makes
up man?”

Distinguishing man from an
animal, Heschel said that man is
a beast that knows he will die:
he is cultivating the doubt that
man is worthy of being saved.
Thus he has a “superior sense of
inferiority.”
“The questions man asks him
self today would have seemed ab
hurd twenty years ago .. .
questions such as ‘Are we the last
generation? Is this the last
hour?’ ” There is a great demonic
force present. The preface of a
hook on atheism in Western Civi
lization reads:' God has died; the
time has come to write his his
tory.’ Today man may be dying,
and there will be no one to write
his history.”
Yesterday’s speech was part of
the Raymond Fred West Memori
al Lectures on Immortality, Hu
man Conduct, and Human Des
tiny.
