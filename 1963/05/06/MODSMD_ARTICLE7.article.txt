# Wedin Wants Increase Of Efficiency in LASSU
## 
### PELL FENDER Associate Editor 
ASSU Presidential candidate
Bud Wedin aired his platform and
his position in the “smear cam
paign” attributed against him
over KZSU Radio Friday night.
Wedin explained, referring to
“The Five Points of Mike Walsh,”
a ditto sheet printed by some of
Wedin’s campaigners, that he
found implicit in the article by
Mike Saks (Feb. 8i that Walsh

did agree with the questions.
Whatever the case, said Wedin,
Walsh has not publicly denied
that he does not agree with the
five points.
Wedin was disappointed that
the presidential campaign had
turned into a determination of the
effectiveness of a smear cam
paign. and an attempt “to concen
trate on personalities.”
.. .to question and probe ..
As students, said Wedin ex
plaining his platform, “our job is
not to run the University smooth
ly, but to question and to probe.
An inquiry into the curriculum,
perhaps in the division of senior
colluquia, would be an area of in
vestigation next year. Also,
stated Wedin, student govern
ment might look into the restric
tions of the graduate students.
Graduate students are treated
like undergraduates, stated We
din. A third area might be an in
creasing of awareness of national
and interfnational affairs by cre
ating, perhaps, official student
unions overseas.
