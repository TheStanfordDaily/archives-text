## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR 
Over 22 per cent of Stanford
students want to abolish student
government altogether while few
er than 16 per cent are satisfied
with it in its present form, ac
cording to a sample opinion poll
taken by The Daily.
The poll, which questioned 374
students from all classes, includ
ing graduates, and most living
groups (Stern, Florence Moore,
Eating Clubs, Fraternities, etc.),
also indicates an overwhelming
opposition to compulsory student
fees for the support of ASSU-op
erated organizations, and a gen
eral dissatisfaction with class
government.
While a bare 53 per cent of stu
dents think student government
is “worthwhile,” the answers to
the question “Do you think stu
dent government should be re
tained in its present form?” were,
to the nearest percent, as follows:
Abol-Unde-
Yes Alter ish ruled
Overall . 16% 45% 22% 17%
Men .... 16% 41% 26% 17%
Women . 17% 62% 5% 16%
Of the men’s living groups, stu
dent government receives the
most favorable response from the
fraternities, the least favorable

from the eating clubs. More sen
iors favor abolition than any
other class, whereas the junior
class just wants alterations.
In answer to the question “Do
you think ASSU Legislature now
serves a useful purpose?” 37 per
cent indicated yes, 41 per cent,
no; and 22 per cent, undecided.
The freshman class is the only
class that favors the present
Icgislat ure.
The question “Do you think
ASSU organizations such as
Ram's Head. Political Union, and
the Institute of International Re
lations should receive support
from compulsory student fees?”
was answered: yes, 24 per cent;
no, 64 per cent; undecided, 12 per
cent.

class government is worthwhile?”
