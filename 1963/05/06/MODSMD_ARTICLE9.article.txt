# Present ASSU Plans for Future Discussed by Walsh. Wedin at Lag
## 
### JANE DUDERSTADT 
In a discussion at Lagunita Court last night, Mike Walsh and Bud Wedin, candidates for
ASSU president gave their views of what the faculty-student relationship should be, of the role
students should play in a university, of Rosencranz’s administration, and of their roles in the
“smear campaign.”
Wedin said that in many universities there was the misconception that things should be run-

I nlng harmoniously between the
students and administration. He
disagreed and said that some
thing was wrong in a completely
harmonious situation. The stu
dents must challenge and discuss
affairs of religion, politics, and
other controversial issues, “It is
their duty to question things
without the university, also ev
erything that affects them within
the university.” He advocated
I perpetuation of Rosencranz’s stu
dent affairs committees, credit-
I ing them “as one of the key rea
j sons why overnights were not
I abolished.”
Students Can Contribute
I Walsh stated that students have
a lot to contribute to a university.
! “The question is, where do you
draw the lino?”, he said. There
j are places where students really
j will never have a vote on student
faculty committees, such as those
i areas of university finance. The
j students must concentrate on
those things which directly affect
them. According to Walsh the
two criteria for students gaining
a larger role on student commit
| tees are that they make contribu
tions and represent the student
attitude accurately and that they
I keep aware of what Is going on.
| “It isn’t so much the loudness of
I voice that is important in stu
| dents. but the quality of
j thought,” he said. Students
should be careful of trying to
dictate to the faculty.
Cops and Robbers
Walsh accused Armin Rosen
cranz of having the attitude that
the students and administration
were involved in “a game of cops
and robbers in perpetual strug
gle.” According to Walsh, stu
dents and administration wore
here for the same reason—educa
tion. Charging that Rosencranz
assumed the role of an “enlight
ened Moses” by making rash
statements so that his only weap
on was pressure, Walsh said,
“This is a foolish approach in an
academic community.” He stated
that pressure is needed in cer
tain areas, yet the first step
toward gaining more students
rights was co-operation. Never
theless, he conceded that Rosen
cranz had opened some doors and
that this school year had been “a
revolutionary one.”
Wedin, on the other hand, said
that while Armin’s public state
ments were most glaring, behind
the scenes he had proved a good
diplomat and had done much to
enhance the role of the student.
Smear Cainpiagn
In a brief resume of the “smear
campaign” Wedin stated that his
supporters in publishing “The
Five Points of Mike Walsh” had
no intent to smear. “I decided to
run in order to give students the
chance to have a part in student

affairs,” said Wedin. "Walsh did
not come out for them until re
cently.” Therefore his supporters
drew the only conclusion possi
ble from Walsh’s rhetorical ques-

tions, used by Saks in his Daily
editorial in February.
Walsh said that he felt the
whole blowup of the “smear
campaign” was “silly, irrelevant,
and had been misrepresented.”
He said that the statements he
had made to Saks in October and
from which Wedin’s supporters
had ocncluded, “The Five Points
of Mike Walsh” were in no way
his attitude towards politics.
“They were merely taken by Saks
from a lunch discussion I had
with him in which I was trying
to introduce him to different at
titudes toward politics at Stan
ford,” said Walsh. The only thing
which dissatisfied me about the
“Five Points of Mike Walsh,”
however, was the title. Walsh
stated, however, that he felt the
controversy on the “smear cam
paign” was obscuring the issues
of the campaign.

Quality, not loudness
In a discussion at Lagunita Court last night, Mike Walsh and Bud Wedin, candidates for
ASSU president gave their views of what the faculty-student relationship should be, of the role
students should play in a university, of Rosencranz’s administration, and of their roles in the
“smear campaign.”
Wedin said that in many universities there was the misconception that things should be run-

I nlng harmoniously between the
students and administration. He
disagreed and said that some
thing was wrong in a completely
harmonious situation. The stu
dents must challenge and discuss
affairs of religion, politics, and
other controversial issues, “It is
their duty to question things
without the university, also ev
erything that affects them within
the university.” He advocated
I perpetuation of Rosencranz’s stu
dent affairs committees, credit-
I ing them “as one of the key rea
j sons why overnights were not
I abolished.”
Students Can Contribute
I Walsh stated that students have
a lot to contribute to a university.
! “The question is, where do you
draw the lino?”, he said. There
j are places where students really
j will never have a vote on student
faculty committees, such as those
i areas of university finance. The
j students must concentrate on
those things which directly affect
them. According to Walsh the
two criteria for students gaining
a larger role on student commit
| tees are that they make contribu
tions and represent the student
attitude accurately and that they
I keep aware of what Is going on.
| “It isn’t so much the loudness of
I voice that is important in stu
| dents. but the quality of
j thought,” he said. Students
should be careful of trying to
dictate to the faculty.
Cops and Robbers
Walsh accused Armin Rosen
cranz of having the attitude that
the students and administration
were involved in “a game of cops
and robbers in perpetual strug
gle.” According to Walsh, stu
dents and administration wore
here for the same reason—educa
tion. Charging that Rosencranz
assumed the role of an “enlight
ened Moses” by making rash
statements so that his only weap
on was pressure, Walsh said,
“This is a foolish approach in an
academic community.” He stated
that pressure is needed in cer
tain areas, yet the first step
toward gaining more students
rights was co-operation. Never
theless, he conceded that Rosen
cranz had opened some doors and
that this school year had been “a
revolutionary one.”
Wedin, on the other hand, said
that while Armin’s public state
ments were most glaring, behind
the scenes he had proved a good
diplomat and had done much to
enhance the role of the student.
Smear Cainpiagn
In a brief resume of the “smear
campaign” Wedin stated that his
supporters in publishing “The
Five Points of Mike Walsh” had
no intent to smear. “I decided to
run in order to give students the
chance to have a part in student

affairs,” said Wedin. "Walsh did
not come out for them until re
cently.” Therefore his supporters
drew the only conclusion possi
ble from Walsh’s rhetorical ques-

tions, used by Saks in his Daily
editorial in February.
Walsh said that he felt the
whole blowup of the “smear
campaign” was “silly, irrelevant,
and had been misrepresented.”
He said that the statements he
had made to Saks in October and
from which Wedin’s supporters
had ocncluded, “The Five Points
