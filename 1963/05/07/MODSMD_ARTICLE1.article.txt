# Eleven Stanford Delegates Take Active Part in Model United Nations
## 
### LINDA HESS Contributing Editor 
(First of a Two-I'art Series)
Stanford’s eleven delegates to the Model
United Nations, representing India in this
year’s conference at San Jose, were among the
most active participants both Individually and
in their national role as leaders of the neutral
ist A fro-Asian bloc.
Highlights of the thirteenth annual M.U.N.
included an address by Nicolai Fedorenko, who
recently replaced Valerian Zorin as Russian
ambassador to the U.N., and an unexpected
anti-U.N. demonstration which picketed and
distributed literature throughout the four-day
conference.

BV THE NIGHT of the final banquet at
which Fedorenko was featured speaker, the
demonstrators had mustered a group of more
than 100 students and citizens of San Jose to
march around the entrance to the fairgrounds

bearing placards with such choice slogans as
“Red Butcher, Go Home!” and “The U.N. Is a
'Bunche' of Reds!”
In the actual business of the M.U.N. debate
in committees and on the floor of the General
Assembly—Stanford Indians spearheaded reso
lutions of special concern to the neutralist na
tions.

In a speech before the Special Political Com
mittee, delegation chairman Bob Ronka ap
pealed to Afro-Asian nations to put aside petty
differences in favor of a unified stand on issues
in which the neutralist world could play a key
role; immediate steps toward nuclear disarma
ment, the eradication of colonialism, and the
upholding of basic human rights.
ONLY A WALKOUT by the Western Bloc
prevented a resolution on the admission of
Red China from reaching the General Assem
bly for the first time in M.U.N. history. Again
under the leadership of India, neutralist na-

tions were proving themselves the dynamic
power of the conference in urging the admis
sion of Red China. When all indications pointed
to the probability of the resolution’s passage,
the Western allies walked out on the voting,
leaving the committee short of the quorum
necessary to send the resolution to the General
Assembly.
Antonio Armellini was highly commended
for his defense of India in the International
Court of Justice, where Portugal had indicted
her for her 1961 seizure of Goa. Although the
ICJ found India’s action to be in violation of
the U.N. charter and the principles of inter
national law, the Justices did not attempt to
order reinstatement of the territories to Portu
guese control. Their reason w'as that Portugal,
as demonstrated by defender Armellini, had
not complied with the resolutions of the Gen
eral Assembly on non-self governing territories.
The Soviet ambassador to the U.N., address

ing the delegates, staff, and townspeople on
the last night of the conference, was congenial,
sly, and surprisingly willing to answer pointed
questions.

SPEAKING IN ENGLISH, Fedorenko open
ed with a series of informal witticisms. He and
his wife expressed their appreciation for the
flowers offered by the Hawaiian delegation and
especially for the fact that the flowers were
the most beautiful of all colors: red. He cor
rected the master of ceremonies for having
said that ho was sitting on the Secretary-Gen
eral’s right. “I was and have always been,” he
emphasized, "to the left of the Secretary-Gen
eral.”

One written question concerned the Sino-
Soviet dispute, and Fedorenko reported that
the questioner had written some Chinese char
acters at the bottom. “Let me answer that
question in the language of those characters,”
he said. After holding forth for several min

utes in Chinese, the ambassador paused. “In
other words,” he continued in English, “this is
a family dispute, a dispute between brothers.
Communist brothers. That is all.”

A final question was directed at Fedoren
ko’s endorsement of peaceful coexistence. Just
what did he have in mind when he referred to
“cooperation,” the delegate wanted to know.
The ambassador’s answer was unhesitating:
“The fact that we have different systems
does not mean that w r e have to fight to annihi
late each other. My country needs peace to
continue its great efforts for progress. No one
can gain by war; everyone knows that. We will
support the principle of peaceful coexistence,
and we will see which system is best. We sin
cerely believe that our system is much better.
We need peace to confirm this.”

In a speech before the Special Political Com
mittee, delegation chairman Bob Ronka ap
pealed to Afro-Asian nations to put aside petty
differences in favor of a unified stand on issues
in which the neutralist world could play a key
role; immediate steps toward nuclear disarma
ment, the eradication of colonialism, and the
upholding of basic human rights.
ONLY A WALKOUT by the Western Bloc
prevented a resolution on the admission of
Red China from reaching the General Assem
bly for the first time in M.U.N. history. Again
under the leadership of India, neutralist na-

tions were proving themselves the dynamic
power of the conference in urging the admis
sion of Red China. When all indications pointed
to the probability of the resolution’s passage,
the Western allies walked out on the voting,
leaving the committee short of the quorum
necessary to send the resolution to the General
Assembly.
Antonio Armellini was highly commended
for his defense of India in the International
Court of Justice, where Portugal had indicted
her for her 1961 seizure of Goa. Although the
ICJ found India’s action to be in violation of
the U.N. charter and the principles of inter
national law, the Justices did not attempt to
order reinstatement of the territories to Portu
guese control. Their reason w'as that Portugal,
as demonstrated by defender Armellini, had
not complied with the resolutions of the Gen
eral Assembly on non-self governing territories.
The Soviet ambassador to the U.N., address

ing the delegates, staff, and townspeople on
the last night of the conference, was congenial,
sly, and surprisingly willing to answer pointed
questions.

SPEAKING IN ENGLISH, Fedorenko open
ed with a series of informal witticisms. He and
his wife expressed their appreciation for the
flowers offered by the Hawaiian delegation and
especially for the fact that the flowers were
the most beautiful of all colors: red. He cor
rected the master of ceremonies for having
said that ho was sitting on the Secretary-Gen
eral’s right. “I was and have always been,” he
emphasized, "to the left of the Secretary-Gen
eral.”

One written question concerned the Sino-
Soviet dispute, and Fedorenko reported that
the questioner had written some Chinese char
acters at the bottom. “Let me answer that
question in the language of those characters,”
he said. After holding forth for several min

utes in Chinese, the ambassador paused. “In
other words,” he continued in English, “this is
a family dispute, a dispute between brothers.
Communist brothers. That is all.”

A final question was directed at Fedoren
ko’s endorsement of peaceful coexistence. Just
what did he have in mind when he referred to
“cooperation,” the delegate wanted to know.
The ambassador’s answer was unhesitating:
“The fact that we have different systems
does not mean that w r e have to fight to annihi
late each other. My country needs peace to
continue its great efforts for progress. No one
can gain by war; everyone knows that. We will
support the principle of peaceful coexistence,
and we will see which system is best. We sin
cerely believe that our system is much better.
We need peace to confirm this.”

Stanford’s eleven delegates to the Model
United Nations, representing India in this
year’s conference at San Jose, were among the
most active participants both Individually and
in their national role as leaders of the neutral
ist A fro-Asian bloc.
Highlights of the thirteenth annual M.U.N.
included an address by Nicolai Fedorenko, who
recently replaced Valerian Zorin as Russian
ambassador to the U.N., and an unexpected
anti-U.N. demonstration which picketed and
distributed literature throughout the four-day
conference.

BV THE NIGHT of the final banquet at
which Fedorenko was featured speaker, the
demonstrators had mustered a group of more
than 100 students and citizens of San Jose to
march around the entrance to the fairgrounds

bearing placards with such choice slogans as
“Red Butcher, Go Home!” and “The U.N. Is a
'Bunche' of Reds!”
