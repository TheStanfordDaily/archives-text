# Sunday Flicks: They Ain't What They Used To Be
## 
### BIEL MOORE 
\ Olcy Killingsworth gazed sadly
| at the Sunday Evening Flicks au
dience from the projection booth
high above Memorial Auditorium.
| “No,” he sighed, “these kids
1 .just aren’t like they used to he.
(They don't have as much fun to
-1 day.”
Killingsworth ought to know.
! He’s been a projectionist at the
| Flicks since the film series be
gan in 1938.
I “I RKMKMKEK those days
clearly,” he said. “The local the
atres used to threaten to boycott
the distributors if they ever gave
us any good, recent movies. So
we had to put up with the really
lousy ones like Gene Autrey,
Tom Mix. and those serials.”
But it didn’t bother the old au
diences. “The movies were so bad
they created their own entertain
ment,” Killingsworth explained.
“You’d never believe how ingeni
ous they were then.”
He motioned toward the audi
ence. “Look at ’em out there. Boy,
I they’re really tame in this day
i and age.”
tThe cartoon was on. A few

mild hisses resounded as Bugs
Bunny cracked a bad pun. And a
number of cheers- followed by
some feeble applause greeted
Ihe hero when he took a nasty
fall into a deep pit.)
“THAT’S ALL they 1 enow how
to do now,” Killingsworth con
tinued. “Just ‘boo’ and ‘yeh’ and
yell obscene phrases. Maybe it’s
because they study so much they
don’t have time to be ingenious.”
But it used to he different.
Back then.
"The kids loved the old beat-up
serials. They dressed up in space
outfits and what-have-you. And
during the show they’d parade
across the stage and have a great
lime.”
tThe main feature had just be
gun. There were a few giggles
as Peter Sellers thumbed through
a novel entitled “Is Sex Neces
sary?” i
“WHY 1 (’AN remember,” Kil
lingsworth continued, "when they
dropped chickens both live and
dead—and pigeons from this long
and narrow opening in the attic
above the audience. And some-
I times they’d even drop water bal
j loons.
! “There was cure guy who
strung a whole row of about 20

water balloons in the attic. As
one fell, it would pull another
with it. You’ve never seen so
much water. That's getting out
of hand, of course.”
Then there were the alarm
clocks.
“Every so often some really
clever student would attach one
of them to the ceiling with a
string. When the clock would go
1 off say it was set for the middle
j of the show —it would swing back
j and forth across the heads of the
audience. Funniest thing you ever
{saw.”
KILLINGSWORTH paused to
scratch his chin. “I’ll let you in
on a secret. I always suspected it
was Ram’s Head that was re
sponsible for those swinging
clocks. You see, it had to be
| someone familiar with the audi
torium.”
Shortly after World War 11. he
pointed out, the students’ inge
[ nuity rose to calamitous propor
[ tions.
“We had to stop the movie
sometimes and give them a lec
ture because they'd got so wild.
They’d be throwing tomatoes and
blowing away at horns and Lord
knows what.”
• Peter Sellers had by Ibis lime

made a pass at the leading lady.
“Bow wow,’’ someone in the au
dience barked meekly.)
“THEY USED to put up with
a lot. however,” Killingsworth
continued. “Booking got so bad
we had to show the same movies
year after year. I don’t know how
long we kept showing the ‘Count
of Monte Cristo.’ ”
Killingsworth said he first
came to Stanford as on employe
in the Engineering Department,
Today he is supervisor of commu
nications.
“I just do the Flicks now as a
kind of hobby,” ho explained. “I
used to do the Flicks all by my
self. Bui now I have two assis
tants, and we rotate around.”
WOULD KILLINGSWORTH
like to see a return to the old
time movies?
“No. If we showed those no
one would come to the Flicks any
more. They can see 'em on TV
today.”
(Peter Sellers had progressed
to the boudoir of the leading lady.
“Score now, Big Red!” a carper
in the audience yelled. Mild
laughter followed.)
“Nope.” observed Killings
worth, “these kids just aren’t like
thov used to be.”
