## Ideology of Sino-Soviet Split 
### TOM GRAY IIR Political Analyst 
In the first two articles of this series, Mr. Quandt sketched
the history of Sino-Soviet relations since 1917, and described
the origins of the current rift between the two great communist
powers. He also mentioned one of the grounds of the rift; the
theoretical dispute over the concepts of “revolution from above’’
and “revolution from below.”
It is fashionable in the West today to pass rather lightly
over the ideological issues in the Sino-Soviet conflict, mention
ing them only as the “outward manifestations” of the “real”
struggle, which is presumed to have its roots firmly planted in
power politics rather than Marxist theory. While it is useful to
examine the geopolitical elements of any conflict between
powers, it would be foolish to ignore the real force of the ideo
logical and the other non-political differences which make up the
current conflict between the Soviet Union and China.
The ideological dispute has been given a new sharpness by
the publication in Peking this March of a lengthy and specific
article attacking the doctrinal heresies of the Soviet leadership.
The article speaks of the Soviets as “modern revisionists,” and
in a burst of remarkable bluntness calls the current conflict “the
third historic struggle in Communist history, comparing it to
Lenin’s struggle with Kautsky and Bernstein and Stalin’s fight
against Trotsky and Bukharin.” (“Reporter,” April 25>.
The Chinese are trying to identify the current Soviet lead
ership particularly with the most despised heretics of the Com
munist mythology—the “reformists” and “parliamentary social
ists” of the Second International—with all the implications of
cowardice and of a “sell-out to the bourgeoisie” such an identi
fication bears to a well-schooled Marxist.
The Chinese indictment of the Soviet leadership carries
other serious implications. One of these ties together the issues
of colonialism and race. The Chinese are making an overt bid
for recognition as the legitimate heirs of the Marxist tradition
among the communist parties of the developing nations. They
have won considerable followings, particularly among the rank
and-file party members in many of these countries, by their sup
port of (he traditional doctrines of violent revolution.
The whole picture they are attempting to draw of the Soviet
Union is something like this: It has become one of the “have”
powers, with a stake in the world, and a vested interest in
stability. It is a white European nation, with little sympathy
and less understanding for the non-white and subjugated peo
ples of the world. In its power and complacency, it has forgotten
its revolutionary heritage; having won its place in the sun. it is
primarily concerned with keeping it by coexisting with the im
perialist powers.
It cannot be denied that such a campaign platform has
definite appeal to many revolutionaries around the world—par
ticularly those who are not white, and those “fundamentalists”
who believe in the “literal interpretation of communist scrip
ture.” The Soviets, however, have an answering platform which
may turn out to have greater appeal.
On their side, (he Soviet leaders can also “cite scripture.”
They can tie the Chinese into the tradition of communist ex
tremists—such as those denounced by Lenin in his “Left-Wing
Communism,” and more particularly with the “Trotskyists.”
Today, they can add the charge of “Stalinism,” and link up the
"hard-line” in foreign policy with “police-state” practices at
home. However, the Soviets have not yet done this; Stalin has
not yet been debunked as far as the broad lines of his foreign
policy go.
The arguments in the Soviet platform which will probably
prove decisive are 1) the argument for peace, and 2) the argu
ment from success. The first of these is a very powerful one
today, in a world under the shadow of nuclear war. The Soviets,
with the policy of coexistence, can appear as the champions of
peace, as against the “adventurist Chinese,” who are repre
sented as holding the doctrine that war with capitalism is inevita
ble. The communist leadership in most of the Western world has
adopted this as their main line of attack on the Chinese, and it
has great appeal in the underdeveloped world as well.
Finally, of course, the Soviet Union is the historic mother
land of communism, and the place where the communist experi
ment has best succeeded. In contrast, China has suffered con
tinuous economic setbacks in recent years, particularly as a
result of deviating from the advice of the Soviets and attempting
a too-radical industrialization drive. If China wishes to gain
substantial support in her drive to lead international commu
nism, she will have to effect some spectacular successes on the
domestic front. The likelihood is that her appeal to ideological
orthodoxy, to racism, and to the revolutionary spirit, will not
suffice to overcome her image of immaturity and immoderation.
