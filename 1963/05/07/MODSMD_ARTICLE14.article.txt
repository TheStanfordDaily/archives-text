## 'Lunch in Paris' 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
In Mr. Khrushchev’s response to our call to check the Com
munists in Laos and 1o uphold the Geneva accord of 1961, we
shall have a measure of his power and influence in southern
Asia. Two years ago, when he met the Piesident in Vienna and
agreed with him that Laos should be neutral and uninvolved in
the cold war, Mr. Khrushchev was still the leader and hig boss
of communism in Asia.
Is he still the big boss and the leader? Much has happened
in the past two years. The biggest event was the Chinese attack
on India. There is reason for thinking that the disturbance in
Laos as well as the mounting pressure of the guerrillas in South
Viet-Nam are part of the same Chinese thrust to the south.
Does Mr. Khrushchev still have the power and influence to
overrule the Chinese? Presumably—for we can only speculate—
the controlling fact is that (he Russians and the Chinese, though
they have conflicting interests and theories, cannot break with
each other. This probably means that the Chinese can go some
way, but not a very long way against India and Southeast Asia
and, beyond that, against Indonesia. The Chinese cannot force
the issue in Asia to a point where not only they, but the Soviet
Union as well would be brought into a major nuclear confronta
tion with the United States.
On the other hand, the Russians cannot afford to exert the
kind of economic and military pressure on China which will be
needed to prevent the Chinese from nibbling their way forward
into southern Asia.
In the short view, there is the possibility of a patched-up
arrangement which will put off a showdown. Laos is still too far
from everybody, from the Soviet Union, from the United States
and even from China, to make it a good place for a showdown.
In the long run, the Chinese will surely keep on moving.
With their birth rate and their poverty, they are sure to push
outward. Assam, East Pakistan, Burma, Southeast Asia and
Indonesia are rich, poorly defended, highly susceptible and very
tempting. The Soviet Union will at the same time become in
creasingly concerned about its long frontier with China and
about the security of the territories which were once under-
Chinese suzerainty.
While these great developments are taking place in the Com
munist world, we and our allies have got ourselves into such a
mess that France and the United States are seriously estranged.
We have let our relations degenerate to a point where the Presi
dent of the United States is planning to visit Italy, Germany and
Ireland and to avoid London, lest a visit there would annoy the
French, and to avoid Paris, because the General does not want
to invite him.
So far as I know, no one has ever explained why the two
Presidents have to behave like two monuments rather than like
two men. As men, it would be quite normal since Mr. Kennedy
will be within an hour of Paris, for the President of France to
invite the President of the United States to lunch.

the cold war, Mr. Khrushchev was still the leader and hig boss
of communism in Asia.
Is he still the big boss and the leader? Much has happened
in the past two years. The biggest event was the Chinese attack
on India. There is reason for thinking that the disturbance in
Laos as well as the mounting pressure of the guerrillas in South
Viet-Nam are part of the same Chinese thrust to the south.
Does Mr. Khrushchev still have the power and influence to
overrule the Chinese? Presumably—for we can only speculate—
the controlling fact is that (he Russians and the Chinese, though
they have conflicting interests and theories, cannot break with
each other. This probably means that the Chinese can go some
way, but not a very long way against India and Southeast Asia
and, beyond that, against Indonesia. The Chinese cannot force
the issue in Asia to a point where not only they, but the Soviet
Union as well would be brought into a major nuclear confronta
tion with the United States.
On the other hand, the Russians cannot afford to exert the
kind of economic and military pressure on China which will be
needed to prevent the Chinese from nibbling their way forward
into southern Asia.
In the short view, there is the possibility of a patched-up
arrangement which will put off a showdown. Laos is still too far
from everybody, from the Soviet Union, from the United States
and even from China, to make it a good place for a showdown.
In the long run, the Chinese will surely keep on moving.
With their birth rate and their poverty, they are sure to push
outward. Assam, East Pakistan, Burma, Southeast Asia and
Indonesia are rich, poorly defended, highly susceptible and very
tempting. The Soviet Union will at the same time become in
creasingly concerned about its long frontier with China and
about the security of the territories which were once under-
Chinese suzerainty.
While these great developments are taking place in the Com
munist world, we and our allies have got ourselves into such a
mess that France and the United States are seriously estranged.
We have let our relations degenerate to a point where the Presi
dent of the United States is planning to visit Italy, Germany and
Ireland and to avoid London, lest a visit there would annoy the
French, and to avoid Paris, because the General does not want
to invite him.
So far as I know, no one has ever explained why the two
Presidents have to behave like two monuments rather than like
two men. As men, it would be quite normal since Mr. Kennedy
will be within an hour of Paris, for the President of France to
invite the President of the United States to lunch.

In Mr. Khrushchev’s response to our call to check the Com
munists in Laos and 1o uphold the Geneva accord of 1961, we
shall have a measure of his power and influence in southern
Asia. Two years ago, when he met the Piesident in Vienna and
agreed with him that Laos should be neutral and uninvolved in
the cold war, Mr. Khrushchev was still the leader and hig boss
of communism in Asia.
Is he still the big boss and the leader? Much has happened
in the past two years. The biggest event was the Chinese attack
on India. There is reason for thinking that the disturbance in
