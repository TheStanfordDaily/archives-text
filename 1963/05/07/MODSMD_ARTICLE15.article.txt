Editors, The Daily:
Just when we thought there wasn’t going to be one this
season, the identity of Stanford’s Martyr of the Year was sud
denly made known to an eagerly waiting student body last Fri
day. Mr. Walsh (who is also running for student body President,
a much less prestigeful office) revealed himself, in the sense of
the preceding sentence, over radio station KZSU. To those of us
for whom no school year is complete until at least one student
has been broken on the rack, Walsh’s martyrdom came in (he
very nick of time.
But how can we be certain that Walsh is a genuine martyr?
Easy enough— he says so himself. It seems that Walsh’s oppo
nent in the current presidential race is one Bud Wedin, a black
hearted wretch who will stop at nothing to gain his own evil
purposes. Wedin, who as a matter of course kicks dogs, steals
from poorboxes, and pushes wheel-chair victims down escala
tors, has really overstepped himself this time. Now get this: he
had his campaign manager clip from The Stanford Daily several
rhetorical questions previously raised by Walsh, reprint them,
and circulate them around campus as Walsh’s own views! Make
your blood boil? Well I should say.
Just how unfair Wedin's actions are becomes clear when you
consider that Mr. Walsh made the statements in question before
the camapign started; indeed, before he even knew he was going
to run for student body president! It seems obvious that under
such adverse circumstances any one of us might have said some
thing like “Do twenty-year-old students really know enough
about all sides of a question to campaign and vote wisely?” Yet
reprinted now, during the heat of the campaign, they make
Walsh sound more like a member of the Administration than of
the student body.
Of course, nothing could he a worse approximation of the
truth. In contrast with Wedin, who in all likelihood has never
been further away from Stanford than the nearest low bar,
Walsh is a high-minded indivadual who has logged several thou
sand miles making speeches for the Alumni Association (and
just who are alumni if they aren’t ex-students!); a situation that
virtually guarantees he will maintain the student point of view
if any items of disagreement with the administration should
arise in the future.
As Walter Lippmann would say, we oah expect Wedin’s low ;
blows to increase in their frequency in-the perilous days ahead.
He has proven himself the type of politician that likes to grub
around in student affairs, leaving the loftier activities for the
Walshes of the world. We can be grateful that Mr. Walsh, who
might easily have chosen to run for alumni president (even
before his graduation) has chosen instead to devote his atten
tion to the student body.

Editors, The Daily:
The tone of recent letters and editorials on the issue of
student-administration discussion implies that students have a
rightful place in determining university policy. If the arguments
in favor of student-administration discussion are based on the
assumption that Stanford students have the right to be heard
and considered by the Administration, this assumption must be
examined.
A student attends Stanford of his own free will. He pays for
education as the school chooses to administer it. He does not
pay for the right or privilege to contribute to university policy.
Acknowledgment of his desires by the Administration may be in
the interests of the University, and will be realized at the dis
cretion of the Administration. Whether or not student feelings
shall be considered in forming university policy is the choice of
the Administration.
If any student becomes dissatisfied and feels that his free
dom is limited beyond that which he is willing to permit in order
to receive (he education offered at Stanford, he may simply
leave. If enough students and university supporters become dis
pleased, they will affect university policy by withdrawing their
attendance and contributions.
It is the function, and the right, of the Administration of a
private university to dictate the policies of that institution.
Those who attend and support Stanford do so by choice, signi
fying their belief that adherence to those policies is just pay
ment for the education being given by Stanford. Those who do
not approve may cease to attend or contribute; their freedom
is limited only by their own choice. Students may ask but may
not demand a voice in Stanford’s policies.

Editors, The Daily:
It is my sineexe hope as President of IFC that fraternities
will not vote in tomorrow’s ASSU election for the sole reason
that, a member of the row is one of the candidates. I feel that
any segment of the student body with such narrow intentions,
whether the fraternities, eating clubs, etc., has not only abused
its responsibility to the student body of which it is a part, but
has done little justice to the gioup which it represents.
I would venture to say that less than one-third of the row
voted in the student body election of last year, and the subse
quent participation and interest in student government over the
course of the year certainly reflected this disinterest and apathy.
I hope that this year the row will take the time and interest
not only to objectively and rationally evaluate the issues at
stake and the course of student government over the last few
years, but also to responsibly cast their ballot as an individual
voter.
Don Haider; President, IFC
