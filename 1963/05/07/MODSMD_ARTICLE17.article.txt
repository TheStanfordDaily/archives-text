# Tough Marines Top Lacrosse Team
## 
### OUR LACROSSE CORRESPONDENT 
A tough, star-studded First Di
vision Marine team staged a last
quarter rally last Saturday to de
feat the Stanford Lacrosse Club
13-9, in the first official lacrosse
game to be played in the Bay
area. The Marines beat Stanford
last week down south, 7-4.
The young Indian team held a
narrow 8-7 lead going into the
fourth quarter when the Marines

took over. The visitors held the
Tribe to one goal in that period,
scoring six of their own.
THREE All-Americans, Karl
Ripplemyer, Dick Conner, and
Torn Mitchell monopolized the
Marine scoring, getting 12 of 13
goals. Mitchell led the individual
scoring with six goals and four
assists.
“Man for man, we could not
match the Marines’ level of ex
perience and stick-handling skill,”

said Hal Louchheim, tlio Stan
ford coach. Louchheim, who
scored once himself fluring the
third quarter to put the Indians
in the lead, noted that a strong
Marine defense limited all Stan
ford attackmen to one goal each,
including All-American Grady
Watts.
Parker Llewellyn, Cary Kelly,
and George Peters starred for the
Indian midfield and consistently
maneuvered the ball into the
scoring position. Vicious Marine
bodychecks failed to sideline 1
starting center Woody Woods, 1
who returned to take charge of
midfield during the third quarter
and played the rest of the game.
UNTIL THU last period, goalie
Toby Hayes managed to stem the
Marine attack as the score see- i
sawed throughout the first 43 ;
minutes.
But occasional weak midfield
cuts and a Marine defense bom
bardment held veterans Howie
Taylor and Lew van Amerongen
to infrequent clear shots at the
goal.
At the other end of the field,
Mitchell and Ripplemyer opened
up in the final minutes of the
game to give the over 300 spec
tators an outstanding ground and
aerial display of dodging and
shooting despite the defensive ef
forts of Chip Greening, Ed Rath
je, and Bill Heyn to wrap up what
had looked like a possible Stan
ford victory.
Stanford hosts the Southern
California Allstars in their next
home match, Saturday, May 11,
at 2 p.m. on the Stanford rugby
field. The Indians have a 1-2 rec
ord.
