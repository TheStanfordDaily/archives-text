## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
The University lias recently
Winds of Freedom Foundation
offered by that organization.
The money is being rejected
lation of a Board of Trustees pol
reserve the right to designate the- 1
use of gifts given to the Univer
sity. The foundation made its do
nations with the stipulation that
their use would be designated or
approved by the foundation’s di
rectors.
The organization, formed last
year by a group of alumni and
students, “has not been authoriz
ed to solicit gifts on behalf of
Stanford University,’’ said a
statement from university offi
cials released yesterday.
THE UNIVERSITY’S position
is based on this Board of Trus
tees statement: “The Board can
not surrender or divide the re
sponsibility and authority for
controlling the University’s af
fairs, including the solicitation
and acceptance of gifts and the
determinations of their use. One
aspect of this policy is that gifts
tendered to the University and
not exclusively subject to Uni
versity control cannot be accept
ed."
The foundation, a non-profit
California corporation organized
in June. 1962. feels “a concerted
effort should be made to help
Stanford be a leader in overtly
standing for traditional Ameri
can principles ... of individual
ism, free enterprise, private prop
erty, limited government and na
tional sovereignty.”
The organizations’ “prime pur
pose ... is to aggregate funds
for gifts to Stanford.” The im
mediate aim of the group is to
“make available at least $lOO,OOO

turned down two gifts from the*
and will not accept any more if
because it is being given in vio
icv which states that the Trustees

a year to Stanford on a term
basis to underwrite the work of
distinguished faculty members
who are not enamored of social
ism . . . but who are dedicated
to leaching the true nature of
our American economic, social,
and political system.”
THE (IROUi* has not sought
approval of the University to so
licit in the name of Stanford.
A 1958 Boa i - d of Trustees gen
eral policy statement on volunteer
groups working within the Uni
versity tax exemptions states:
“The Board of Trustees wel
comes the formation of organized
groups to work for the welfare
of the University and wishes to
encourage active participation by
alumni and friends in these or
ganizations, but the interests of
orderly and effective procedure
suggest that Board approval and
endorsement be sought before
any groups bearing the Stanford
name are formed outside the
present pattern of organizations
to work on behalf of the Univer
sity.”
The literature of the organiza
tion closely resembles that of the
official Alumni Soliciting Organ
ization, Stanford Associates, hav
ing a red Palo Alto free and a
Stanford, Calif., post box return
address.

“The Board of Trustees wel
comes the formation of organized

of the University and wishes to

Yesterday’s press statement by
University officials was in re

use of gifts given to the Univer

The organization, formed last
year by a group of alumni and
students, “has not been authoriz
ed to solicit gifts on behalf of
Stanford University,’’ said a
statement from university offi
cials released yesterday.
THE UNIVERSITY’S position
is based on this Board of Trus
tees statement: “The Board can
not surrender or divide the re
sponsibility and authority for
controlling the University’s af
fairs, including the solicitation
and acceptance of gifts and the
determinations of their use. One
aspect of this policy is that gifts
tendered to the University and
not exclusively subject to Uni
versity control cannot be accept
ed."
The foundation, a non-profit
California corporation organized
in June. 1962. feels “a concerted
effort should be made to help
Stanford be a leader in overtly
standing for traditional Ameri
can principles ... of individual
ism, free enterprise, private prop
erty, limited government and na
tional sovereignty.”
The organizations’ “prime pur
pose ... is to aggregate funds
for gifts to Stanford.” The im
mediate aim of the group is to
“make available at least $lOO,OOO

turned down two gifts from the*

basis to underwrite the work of
distinguished faculty members

our American economic, social,
and political system.”

approval of the University to so
