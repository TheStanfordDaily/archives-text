Cai'ds.
The first match of the unusual
tennis doubleheader was begun
at Berkeley, April 13. However,
rain halted play shortly after the
doubles had started, with Stanford
holding a 4-2 lead. An Indian vic
tory was almost certain, for the
Tribe, needing only one doubles
victory, was ahead 1-1 in (he sec
ond doubles, and had won the
first set in the third doubles
when the match was postponed.
NOT ONLY did the netters win
both those matches, hut the first
doubles team of Yoshi Minegishi
and Brad Hodgman almost upset
the Bears’ top team of Jim Mc-
Manus and Doug Sykes, 4-6, 6-1.
9-7. Hodgman appeared to carry
the team in the first part of that
match, as Minegishi, (he number
one singles player on the squad,
was playing poorly.
In the second match the visiting
Bears were definitely improved
with the addition of Barry Bas
kin, who missed the first match
at Berkeley.
This time the singles split 3 3.
Minegishi continued to have
troubles with McManus, possibly
(he best player in Northern Cali
fornia, as the Cal star won again,
6-3, 6-4.
ON THU OTHER hand, Ron
Preissman, who had been having
his trouble with Sykes, finally
beat him for the first time.

Preissman was aided by the col
lapse of Sykes in the third set.
Preissman’s match was proba
bly the best of the afternoon.
Neither player was particularly
powerful, Sykes relying on his
ability to return the ball, and
Preissman on his shot-making
ability. The result was several
long, leisurely volleys.
In the doubles, the Cards were
aided by the upset win by Hodg
man and Minegishi in the first
doubles. Preissman and Isaacs
picked up the final match for the
Indians in the second doubles,
combining to heat Baskin and
