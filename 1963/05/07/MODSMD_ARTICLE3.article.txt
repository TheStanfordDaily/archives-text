# It's Lacrosse at Stanford
## 
### TONY TUFT 
The Stanford lacrosse team,
independently organized and fi
nanced, met the Marines Satur
day in the first lacrosse game
ever played in the Bay Area.
Pete Faulkned. “Father of
Stanford lacrosse,” hopes that his
club and others like it will make

the game as popular in California
as it has been in Canada and the
East.
Developed as a primitive kind

; of eugenics among Canadian In-
I dians, lacrosse has often been
i called both brutal and boring.
THESE CHARGES have al
ways frustrated attempts to or
ganize the game at the varsity
level. The Indians played it in
j deadly earnest, not stopping until
’ all the weaker warriors had been
; eliminated. Even today, after
| much careful regulation, it is not
I a game for the timid. Face guards
and knee padding, long standard
equipment for football players.
| are a recent concession to safety.
| These and other reasons pre-
I vent lacrosse from ever becoming
j a major spectacle. But as a minor
i sport it claims enthusiastic fans
|at Johns Hopkins, eastern prop
.schools, and the service acade
j mies.
Lacrosse is played with fever
ish intensity: a skilled player
| must combine the strength and
! stamina required for football
| with the quick agility needed for
basketball.
THE TEN players on each side
are equipped with crosses long
! clubs with a net at one end. They
I can be used to carry the ball or
to prevent an opponent from
keeping it.
At times during the game on
Saturday, the action was as con
fusing to follow as a tennis match
played on a revolving court. The
ball would disappear into a
thrashing mass of clubs and
legs, then go bouncing into the
outfield. To spectators, it was no
less disconcerting to watch a ball
carrier being chased across the
field by the clubs of his oppo
nents.
“I don’t like the way they’re
hitting,” groaned a sympathetic
coed in the stands.
