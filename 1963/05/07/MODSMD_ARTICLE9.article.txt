# Dissident IIR Members Attempt To Ammend New Constitution
## 
### MICHAEL SAKS 
Members of the 1111, at an informal meeting last night,
decided to circulate a petition to stop the new 1111 constitution
before it gets to LASSU By-laws Committee Thursday night. The
members want to make certain amendments to broaden the base
of power and policy making in the organization.

” The meeting was called by
Charles Kendall because of grow
ing dissatisfaction among HR
members that governing power
is becoming too centralized in the
HR policy board.
THE MEMBERS as last night's
meeting did not draft specific
proposals; they all had their own
ideas. But they did agree that the
new constitution must be stopped
for closer scrutinization.
Although work was begun on
the new constitution last quarter,
there has been no constitution on
paper that could be reviewed un
til a few days ago.
Kendall personally proposes
that the “executive board should
have over-all power of review.”
At present, (his power rests ex
clusively with the policy board.
HE WOULD like the executive
board to meet biweekly or
monthly to review the general
workings of the policy board. No
conclusions were made as to who
would be on the executive board,
but. generally, it would bo com
posed of the policy board, the HR
president, the heads of the desks
ad departments, all with equal
voting power. He believes there
is “nothing silly in having more
members of the HR participate
in the HR.”
Lawrence Deßivort stated that
the way the HR is run now, “if
you don’t like what’s going on,
you sit on your hands or get
out.”
Since the new constitution is a
result of an expanded HR. he be
lieves that final decisions should
rest with the executive, not the
policy board. More students
would be allowed to participate,
and apathy would diminish.
Marty Greenwald raised the ob
jection that a big meeting, such
as an executive board, would not
get enough done. “Participation
requires co-ordination, which you
won’t get in a big group,” he
said.
Robert Ronka believes that
“having everyone interested in
the HR and having directives
coming from the policy board are
not mutually exclusive.” He
wants the executive board to
meet in session only to serve as
a democratic safeguard when
things get out of line.

Marty Greenwald raised the ob
jection that a big meeting, such
as an executive board, would not
get enough done. “Participation

Robert Ronka believes that
“having everyone interested in
the HR and having directives
coming from the policy board are
not mutually exclusive.” He
wants the executive board to
meet in session only to serve as
a democratic safeguard when
things get out of line.
