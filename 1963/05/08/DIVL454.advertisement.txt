Early this year we put a 164-hp V-8 in a
new kind of Falcon called the Sprint, and
entered the stiffest winter road test we could
find . ..the 2,500-mile Monte Carlo Rallye. We
didn’t know what would happen . . . but happen it did.
First, no one dreamed all the Rallye cars would have to
experience the worst winter in decades. Snow, below

A lot of experts told us that the
Falcon V-B's, untried as they were,
could not hope to finish the Rallye
with the best of weather. But not only
did two Falcon Sprints finish, they
placed first and second in their class.

So you see something has happened
to the Falcon. It can be what you
want it to be ... a V-8 that travels
in the same circle as Europe's per
formance kings ... or a Six that
can travel cross-country on a
budget. There's something to put

So you see something has happened
to the Falcon. It can be what you
want it to be ... a V-8 that travels
in the same circle as Europe's per

can travel cross-country on a
budget. There's something to put
into your compact.
