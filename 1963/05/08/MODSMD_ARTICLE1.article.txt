“Why KILL - KILL - KILL ... in the name
of peace?”
Alongside a picture of a bloody automobile
accident, this slogan introduced a leaflet con
demning U.N. intervention in the Congo, dis
tributed by anti-U.N. demonstrators at the
Model United Nations in San Jose.
The demonstration, result of two and a
half months' planning by San Jose zealots,
lurched forward on several fronts during the
four-day conference.
Pickets paraded before the entrance of the
Civic Auditorium, led by an American flag.
MATCHBOOKS with MUN GO HOME on the
front and a U.N. Building resembling the loan
ing Tower of Pisa on the back (“How far left
will it lean?” was the caption) were handed to
anyone who would take them.
A car equipped with P.A. system circulated

i measure directing the chairman

through the town blaring out a list of U.N.
“abuses.”
And, in a climactic last-night protest against
the appearance of Soviet U.N. Ambassador
Nicolai Fedorenko, loudspeakers, leaflets,
matchbooks, and demonstrators—over a hun
dred strong— gathered together to strike dele
gates and guests with the full impact of their
belief in freedom and their opposition to the
communist-dominated world organization
THE STUDENT LEADER of the anti-U.N.
movement is Thomas Di Pippo, a sophomore
English major at San Jose State. In an inter
view compiled in the midst of marching demon
strators, Di Pippo stated that the purpose of
the movement was to see that both sides of the
“U.N. controversy” were fairly presented.
Sensing a certain inconsistency between the
tenor of the placards and the claim that a fail
consideration of both sides was the group’s
goal, I asked Mr. Di Pippo if he and his fellow
demonstrators were not indeed opposed to the

United Nations.
“We’re not opposed to it in principle,” ho
replied, “but to the abuses in it as it stands
now.”
AS EXAMPLES of abuses ho pointed to the
action of U.N. forces in Katanga, the fact that
Russia has three votes to the U.S.’s one (refer
ring to the Ukraine and Byelorussian S.S.R.),
and the dishonesty of the so-called neutrals.
What did he propose to do about the “abuse”
of the uncommitted countries?
“Let’s cut this ‘both sides’ business out.
Lot’s make the neutrals declare themselves—
whether they’re western or led.”
Q: THEN EVERY nation in the U.N. should
have to pledge itself to either the western or
the communist bloc?
A: Yes . . . No, you’re writing down what
you want me to say. I say that every nation
should pledge itself to peace and freedom.
Q: Do you identify the principles of peace
and freedom with the western powers, led by

the U.S.?
A: The principles of peace and freedom are
such inalienable rights as those stated in the
Declaration of Independence. This does not
mean that there are not abuses in our own
country.
DI PIPPO AGREED that the ideals of peace
and freedom are affirmed in the U.N. Charter.
Q: Then are not all member nations al
ready pledged to those ideals?
A: You tell me if the communist nations
are pledged to peace and freedom. Communism
in practice flourishes on chaos and poverty,
not on peace.
Q: Might it not be possible to compile a list
of the U.N.’s positive achievement’s which
would be as long as or longer than your list
of abuses?
A: Probably. But there is an abuse inherent
in these achievements. I don’t like the idea of
a world government taking care of everybody’s
health or education. That Is the basic fault of

**
socialism. It weakens the moral fiber.
“THE QUESTION it all boils down to is
this: is it so bad to be poor? We think so, be
cause we are prosperous and educated. But the
native on the plains of Africa is happy in his
own way.”
Is it so bad to be miserable, diseased, and
ignorant? Di Pippo didn’t put the question that
way, and, in order to avoid a discourse on the
noble savage, I abandoned the subject.
Although I tried to keep the interview ob
jective, it was difficult to do so in the total
absence of any coherent argument. While pious
ly affirming that all sides of a controversy
should be thoroughly understood and fairly
considered, Di Pippo flatly refused to consider
that communism should recieve equal hearing
with democracy in a world organization.
“The representatives of a communist nation
do not truly represent the people,” was his con
cluding statement. “They are appointed by
dictators.”
