BALDWIN’S NEWEST book.
I “The Fire Next Time,” is a scries
!of essays which originally ap
j peared in the New Yorker. In
| these, he seeks a realistic aecom
j modation between whites and Ne
groes “to end the racial night
mare.” His position is not as
pessimistic as the title of his book
would imply. The title is an allu
sion to the biblical era of Noah
and the flood in which “God gave
Noah the rainbow sign, no more
water, the fire next time.”
Baldwin, a prolific writer who
has turned out the whole body of
his published work in less than 10
years, has won a Guggenheim
Fellowship and a Ford Foundation
Grant-in-Aid.
His 1961 book, “Nobody Knows
I My Name,” was recognized by the
I National Conference of Christians
I and Jews and was selected by the
Notable Books Council, American
j Library Association, as one of the
i outstanding books of that year.
ASIDE FROM “The Fire Next
Time” and “Nobody Knows My
Name,” the author’s other works
include “Go Tell It on the Moun
tain,” “Notes from a Native Son,”
“Giovanni’s Rome,” and numerous
essays.

Overcome” today at 4:30 p.m,
