# The 						Winds of Freedom Funds

### 
Tlie Board of Trustees is to be highly commended for its
refusal to accept restricted funds from the Winds of Freedom
Foundation. This action is especially praiseworthy when the
University is in the midst of a mammoth fund-raising drive.
The Winds of Freedom Foundation funds were to be ear
marked for the purpose of supporting the “many Stanford
faculty members whose philosophies are pro-American.” The
foundation hoped that its donation would provide a “prompt,
scholarly and articulate rebuttal” to the so-called “socialist
liberals" among the faculty members. However, any such fi
nancial restriction on the political or economic teaching of
professors would be detrimental to the University, turning it
into a propaganda mill.
Stanford has a reputation as a “conservative” school. The
majority of its alumni are economically and politically con
servative. In view of this fact, the Board of Trustees has ex
hibited great courage and a willingness to stand by its ideals.
This willingness to do what is best for the University despite
money is an encouraging sign, a sign contradicting the current
fear that the “University will do anything for money.”
