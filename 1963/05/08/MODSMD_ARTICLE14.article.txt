Editors, The Daily:
In the heat of the final days of campaigning for the ASSU
Presidency, some humor and all too much ill will has resulted.
I do not wish to add to that ill will, and am incapable of
matching the humor, but do feel compelled to point out an alarm
ing discrepancy in Mike Walsh’s statements concerning student
government this year.
In The Daily, October 15, 1962, Mr. Walsh severely criticized
Armin Rosencranz’s address to the freshmen, calling his sub
stantive position “considerably unrealistic, grossly irresponsible,
and alarmingly naive.” Armin's “Four Freedoms” (freedom to
participate in University policy deliberations, freedom to emerge
from lethargy and apathy and to concern ourselves with in
justices in every part of the world, etc.), according to Mr. Walsh
“should invoke indignant response from the more responsible
members of the Student Body . . Mr. Walsh’s last paragraph
in this letter concludes: “The unrealistic, irresponsible and naive
manner of his presentation raises grave questions as to the
future of this year’s student government.”
On May 6, 1963, a representative of Mr. Walsh’s campaign
staff stopped by my room and left me a copy of the candidate’s
platform. The first plank of this platform is an endorsement of
the ends, “i.e. a greater student voice in the determination of
University Policy, especially those areas which directly affect
students,” of this year’s student government. His next point is
an embracing of the Stanford Student Congress—“a healthy or
ganization which should be encouraged.”
Now the extent to which this year’s student government
and the SSC embody the principles set forth in the Student Body
President’s address to the freshmen, and the partial attainment
of the same, is certainly great. Mr. Walsh’s first two planks in
his platform, however, can by no stretch of the imagination be
considered an “indignant response” to these principles; hence, a
serious inconsistency in the candidate’s thought. Mr. Walsh is
now embracing the very aims of student government which he
so severely criticized during Fall Quarter. Either he does not
understand this year’s student government and the SSC to be
representative of the policy stated in Armin’s address to the
freshmen, in which case we can only conclude that the candidate
is ill-informed; or Mr. Walsh has realized how terribly impolitic
his criticism of the position taken in the speech is in light of a
student body election.

Now the extent to which this year’s student government
and the SSC embody the principles set forth in the Student Body
President’s address to the freshmen, and the partial attainment
of the same, is certainly great. Mr. Walsh’s first two planks in
his platform, however, can by no stretch of the imagination be
considered an “indignant response” to these principles; hence, a
serious inconsistency in the candidate’s thought. Mr. Walsh is
now embracing the very aims of student government which he
so severely criticized during Fall Quarter. Either he does not
understand this year’s student government and the SSC to be
representative of the policy stated in Armin’s address to the
freshmen, in which case we can only conclude that the candidate
is ill-informed; or Mr. Walsh has realized how terribly impolitic
his criticism of the position taken in the speech is in light of a
student body election.
