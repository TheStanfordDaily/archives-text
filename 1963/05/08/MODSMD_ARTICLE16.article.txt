# POISON IVY PRIMER
## Elect Me Emperor 
### K W SMITH 
Friends, Students, and Apathetic Commoners:
Democracy is Dead.
What we need is a good old iron-fisted Tyrant.
I cast my Crown into the Ring.
Let us end forever the Confusion and the Corruption of Repre
sentative Government.
Government by Clodlsh Commoners is a democratic Drag.
Dump on Democracy.
Really now, who cares what the President or the Legislature
Rabble. Babble about.
Call on a King to load (he way.
Let the man with Divine Right make your decisions for you.
We need the Stability and (he Security of an Hereditary House.
And the Glittering Glamour of Regal Grandeur.
Support the Sovereign of your choice.
Republicanism today is Rotten,
The Wave of the Future is Utopian Feudalism.
I say: Feudalism Forever.
The other Candidopes are anti-Royalist Reactionaries.
They are genetically unfit . . . and they only last a year.
Frequent elections are messy . . . and they deplete the Treasury.
But with a little divine luck, Empire will be Eternal.
Besides, my two worthy-less Opponents are Wishy-Walshy.
A vote for Walshy is a vote for a Wimp.
A vote for Wishy is a vote for a Wiennie.
They are Tools of the Administration
The Servants of the Straight and Narrow.
They are the Lackies of Goodness.
They are the Patsies of Purity and Wholesomeness.
Dump on the Dorm Dumpling and Gaf the Greek Gobbler.
What’s good for General Morons is Not good for the University.
Therefore, Loyal Subjects, Make the World safe from Democracy.
Vote the straight Tyranny Ticket.
Give me Dictatorship or give me Death.
Popular Rule is for Pedestrian Plebians.
Fellow Princes and Princesses:
Freshmen Field Marshalls . . . Sophomore Sultans . . .
Junior Czars . . . Senior Shahs . . .
Graduate Grand Dukes:
Be Blue - Blooded Americans.
It’s Time to Re-Affirm Aristocracy.
Know your class, Faculty Footmen.
Know your place, Administration Jesters,
The Royalist Revolution is Imminent.
Well-borners of the World, Unite.
We have nothing to lose but our Claims.
Get out the Aristocratic Apathy Vote.
Write In Royalty.
