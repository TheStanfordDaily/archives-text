## Pacifism: An Anachronism? 
### BRUCE NAEGELI Chairman, Conservative Caucus 
Today is “World-Strike-for-Pcace Day.” As, all over the free
world, groups of pacifists advertise their presence on this day,
it behooves us to consider the relevance of pacifism in today’s
world.
For thousands of years, men have coveted each others’ pos
sessions, and have, either physically or cerebrally, fought each
other for them. Whenever entire tribes or nations have thus
coveted the property or territory of another tribe or nation,
wars have resulted. Since greed seems to be an ingrained trait
of humans, and since the most obvious means to satisfy this
greed has always been war, countless bloody conflicts have
marked the entire course of recorded history, until it has been
said that there have been only six years of complete peace since
the birth of Christ.
In the midst of all of these wars, there have always been
people who have recognized that mankind was destroying the
best of its human resources in what was merely a continual
greedy grubbing for land—that the desire on the part of leaders
for personal aggrandizement was the cause of a good part of
mankind’s woes.
These people have protested against the wars of their na
tions, almost always without effect, for they were a- small mi
nority (for a long time, a very snipll minority indeed). But they
have always been there.
This condition prevailed for thousands of years, finally cul
minating in the First World War, in which nine million men
died in a massive melee over border provinces, colonies, and
trade. Although President Wilson tried to inject a note of
idealism into it, World War I remained basically the same as all
of the previous wars—the result of greed—on a larger scale.
Considerable numbers of pacifists (including Stanford's first
president, Dr. Jordan) lodged their usual protest against the
war, with the usual dismal lack of results. To all appearances,
this pattern would continue forever.
But, in the years following World War I a change took
place in international politics. There arose in certain circles a
violent repugnance towards the democratic systems which had
been established over much of the world. In two nations—ltaly
and Russia—men came into control to whom tyranny was not
meerly an expedient for their own benefit, but a philosophy, a
doctrine, a secular religion. Both Fascism and Communism
preached conquest and expansion for its own sake. Armed oppo
sition. not only to their neighbors, but to democracy everywhere,
became the policy of these nations.
At the same time, coincidentally, pacifism at last began to
attract a sizable following. For the first time in history, the paci
fists, from being an infinitessimal minority, began to be a po
litical force.
Fascism matured, and when the governments of Italy and
Germany began actively to pursue their policy of conquest, it
became apparent to many people that (he resulting European
VVar was not merely another battle for some provinces or colo
nies, but a war between democracy and tyranny. Indeed, many
of the former pacifists, recognizing this fact, deserted their
pacifism and worked to alert America to the danger of Fascism
and, later, contributed to the war effort (most notable example:
Albert Einstein).
But not all. Many other pacifists refused to abandon their
crusade, even when their crusade was completely incongruent
to realities. ‘‘No more foreign wars!” they cried. “No more
American boys killed!” The antics of our pre-Pearl Harbor iso
lationists are well-chronicled.
When, in spite of the pacifists’ efforts. Fascism was de
stroyed, the democratic nations of the world found themselves
faced with the second of the enemies of freedom, Communism.
This is the situation in which we are today. And yet, in
spite of this situation, (he pacifists are still with us. in aug
mented numbers. The pacifist movement, using the momentum
it has been gathering for centuries, plunges forward into irrele
vance, like a taxiing airplane, which, overshooting the end of the
runway, finds itself trying to take off from a ploughed field.
Today’s pacifists, like the America Firsters and isolation
ists of 1940, demand that we ignore the threat to freedom while
we try to avoid war. To paraphrase Cicero, “They think that we
do enough for liberty if we merely avoid the weapons of its
enemies.”
It is indeed tragic (hat when, after centuries, pacifism has
begun to come into its own, it has suddenly become irrelevant
But such is the case. Let us not let the nobility of pacifism’s
history confuse us about its lack of applicability today.
