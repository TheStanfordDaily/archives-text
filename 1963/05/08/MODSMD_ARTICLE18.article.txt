Lditors, The Daily;
Mr. Purscll has suggested that
if I as a student of Stanford do
not like the policies laid down by
the Administration, I may leave
the University to seek my educa
tion elsewhere. I am not convinced
that this is the only available
choice. Nor, I believe, is it al
ways the best choice.
In addition to being a student
of Stanford, I am also a citizen of
the United States, for which 1 pay
taxes and receive the benefits of
citizenship. If I do not like the
policies of the government of this
country, I can, of course, re
nounce my citizenship and go to
another country where the poli
cies are more to my liking. But
many people feel that it is better
for me to remain in the United
States as a citizen and to attempt
to change policies which I feel
need improvement. Some people
even claim that I am evading re
sponsibility if I leave. Perhaps a
weakness in the analogy so far is
that the government of this
country has been constitutionally
established with provision for
citizens to work for policy
changes, whereas there is no pro
vision in the Founding Grant or
under the Board of Trustees for
students of Stanford to work for
changes of University policy. But
then, what about a nondcmocratic
country like Cuba? Should the
Cuban citizen not work for a
change of policy because such
change is against the decree of
the government or the constitu
tion?
The analogy I have used is not
perfect, but I tl â€™nk a basic prin
ciple underlies it. In whatever set
of circumstances i ? may bo in, an
individual has the opportunity to
work for changes > nd for correc
tion of existing wro gs.
You may choose tt adhere com
pletely to the policies of the Stan
ford Administration, Mr. Pursell,
but it is your own choice.
