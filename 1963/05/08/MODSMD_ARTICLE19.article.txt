## University Fraternities Are Entering a Significant Period of Change' 
### Collegiate Press Service 
That most venerable and most
debated institution, the American
college fraternity, is entering a
significant period of change, the
Associated Press has decided.
Noting widespread debate on
the merits of the Greek system
throughout the U.S. educational
community this year, the AP
polled 150 campuses across the
nation to discover what changes
have been wrought in the frater
nity system as a result of the con
troversies of the past few years.
The AP poll revealed that there
are many still remaining on U.S.
campuses who see the fraternity
system as either all good or all
bad—but that a significant num
ber of students and educators
have begun to look at the system
with an eye to improving it to
fit into the modern educational
scheme of things.
The debate, of course, has raged
for decades. The Greek will tell
you that the fraternity is the in
valuable inculcator of self-reli
ance, the social graces, group de
mocracy, and scholarship in the
otherwise hapless student masses.
And the non-Greek will tell you
that fraternities are the last ref
uge of bigots, snobs, and rich
men’s sons who need a crutch to
get them through school.
Last year, Williams College, in
Massachusetts, a genteel liberal
arts school steeped in the ancient
fraternity tradition, gave the pro-
Greeks their worst setback in
years: the school’s administration
decreed that fraternities were in
imical to educational pursuits and
that Williams’ 15 fraternities
would have to go.
Williams’ action came at a time
when the fraternity-sorority sys
tem in the nation was numerical
ly at its highest point. There are
currently 262 national Greek let
ter collegiate societies, with 16,-

006 chapters and a membership
of 6.X million, counting graduates.
There are fraternities for gen
tiles, Jews, Poles, engineers, far
mers, Filipinos, Negroes, and so
on.
Yet while the fraternity sys
tem is at a numerical peak, it is
actually on the decline in relation
to the total enrollment figures of
the nation’s higher educational
system. And fraternities are be
ing increasingly hard-pressed to
justify their existence in the U.S.
of the 1960’s—when American
education feels itself challenged
to respond to the competition of
the Cold War; an age that is in
creasingly sensitive to the egali
tarian mood of the newly inde
pendent nations; an age that has
seen soldiers march to integrate
a university.
At a time when the nation sees
itself as hard-pressed for creative
minds from the universities, some
critics picture the fraternities and
sororities as a vast anti-intellec
tual desert, where the “bonds of
brotherhood too often tie knots of
conformity and the climb to the
social graces too often stumbles
into a trap of hooch"—as an AP
writer put it.
The Associated Press poll found
that the fraternity system is as
strong as over, if not stronger in
the traditionally conservative
Midwestern universities, and in
the traditionally reactionary
Southern schools. The system is
under the most pressure in the
urbanized and liberal Northeast.
But everywhere, the Greek sys
tem seems to be undergoing a
great process of reform, both
from within and without.
The one issue that all fraterni
ties and sororities must eventual
ly face up to, of course, is the
discrimination question. Many
fraternities have iliminated writ
ten constitutional bans against
members of minority groups—in
order to remain on campus in
most cases but very few have
actually integrated their member
ship. In an age where more and
more of the country’s youth are
finding themselves impatient
with racial bigotry, the Greeks
find that they are losing many
potentially outstanding members
because of their inability to inte
grate.
In many cases, it is not the un
dergraduate chapter of the fra
ternity or sorority that is unwill
ing to integrate, but the alumni
chapter, which often controls the
finances, and exercises a strong

influence, if not outright veto
power, over the selection of
pledges. As a result, a number of
chapters have “gone local” or left
their national organizations and
in some cases their alumni orga-
I nizations, in order to escape the
j burden of discriminatory pledg
ing rules. Swarthmoro College
has lost three chapters in this
fashion this year.
Attitudes among university ad
ministrators toward the frater
nity system are widely varied. At
Oregon State, they are “welcome,
not just tolerated,” But Boston
University Dean Stanton R. Cur
| tis says “time is running out, I
fear,” citing fraternities’ "fiscal
mismanagement, low academic
achievement, and failure to
choose a representative member
ship.”
j The AP poll found that “The
1 average fraternity house (they
jean be worth as much as $300,-
000» may have 50-60 members,
j half of whom live in, a drinking
j room lined with irreverent car
toons of the brothers, a secret
meeting or ‘goal’ room perhaps
with a skull or two or such cere
j monial equipment. If the house
is lucky enough to have a good
| cook, living can be easy.”
And the easy living can inspire
some fairly turgid prose: From a
fraternity handbook at Arizona
State University “Brotherhood
isn’t just a 50-50 deal. It’s 60-60.
It’s that extra 20 percent that
really counts.” Or it can inspire
some pretty scathing comments:
“Greeks are colorless, personali
ty-less men who feel confident
wearing a pin. The university is
paternalistic enough, but Greeks
want to go further and find their
childhood” a German exchange
student at Michigan.
Or plain indifference: “An
alumnus owes loyalty first to his
college, then to Ids class, and last
; ly to his fraternity if he can re
member the name of it.” a Dart
mouth graduate.
One of the biggest arguments
is over the selective nature of
Greek pledging systems. Few ar
gue with the right to free associ
ation of individuals, but many as
sert that most fraternities ex
elude entire ethnic groups, not
I just individuals. While the fra
ternities still insist on their right
to pick and choose their members
as they please, the AP poll
showed a definite trend toward
| increasing liberalization of selec
tion policies.
A Duquesne official said that
i he was somewhat surprised re
cently to sec a Chinese student
wearing the emblem of a pre
[dominantly Polish fraternity. At
S Rutgers, where restrictive clauses
were outlawed in 1958, many
houses are now integrated, with
no apparent ill effects. In 1952,
the University of Wisconsin had
j 13 chapters with discriminatory
clauses. None does now but
there are still very few members

of minority groups among the
brothers.
At Dartmouth, undergraduates
voted to do away with restrictive
clauses on their own initiative. In
fact, the AP reported that the
poll showed that in almost all
such cases, the initiative came
from the students themselves.
At Stanford University, the lo
cal Sigma Nu chapter voted to
break its national ties because of
the national’s discriminatory
clause. Chapter president Thomas
Grey explained “it is becoming
increasingly difficult to find a
good pledge class which is willing
to accept membership in an or
ganization which denies admit
tance on purely racial grounds.”
Five University of Virginia stu
dents recently chartered a plane
to fly to Yale University to pro
test the imminent pledging of a
Negro by the Delta Psi chapter
there. They were given a hearing,
but the Negro was pledged.
Sometimes troubles with the
national work the other way
around. A sorority at Beloit, Del
la Gamma, was dumped by its
national after pledging a Negro
girl. A fraternity at Willamette
reportedly gave up the idea of
pledging a Negro because it was
a foregone conclusion that the
national would not permit it.
Yet, as local chapters are eas
ing up their pledging require
ments, so are the nationals. The
few that have clauses left have
attempted to conceal them in am
biguous language, especially since
fraternity discrimination has
been outlawed in several states,
including California and Oregon.
Perhaps the most popular cur
rent gambit is to erase the clause
completely, but include a pro
vision whereby the members of
any chapter of the fraternity
may thumb down a pledge of any
other chapter and most frater
nities have numerous chapters in
the South.
Other anti-Greeks argue that
the fraternity system. even
though it is changing, is inimical
to the needs of modern education.
They assert that the fraternity,
even when it is selecting on an
individual rather than ethnic ba
sis, too often overlooks brighter
and potentially bettor students,
tends to select students who “fit
in” to the mold of the group. Pro-
Greks argue that life is a long
process of selection and rejection,
and that the best place to get
used to it is in college.
Responding to these criticisms
in varying degrees, some frater
nity systems at various schools
have postponed rushing until the
Sophomore year in an attempt to
allow the student to get academ
ically well established before'
rushing.
The most common criticism of
the fraternity system is that it
enforces conformity. The case of
an Illinois student who had to
hold off his romance until his

girl could bo diplomatically
pledged to a sorority is often
cited.
But the person who thinks that I
all Greeks are exactly alike, right j
down to their dirty white bucks, |
has another think coining. The ■
president of the Michigan State |
Young Socialists, who is con-1
vinced that today’s Greeks, arc
“tomorrow’s organization men''
had to admit that one of the lead
ers of his group was a sorority j
girl.
An the organization-centered j
way of life brings its dividends j
to the Greeks. Greeks have a lit
eral stranglehold on student poli
tics in the nation. At Ohio State, |
for instance, 20 per cent of the
students are Greek yet of 2001
leaders of extra-curricular orga-j
nizations, only four or five are j
non-Greek. The pattern is similar
at most large state universities.
It has been estimated that To per I
cent of the officers of the U.S.
National Student Association
have been Greeks.
And thus, it would seem, while
the Greek system may be under
pressure, the decline and fall of
the empire is still a long way off.
But one thing confuses observ
ers of the nation’s nearly seven
million Greks they seem to have
surprisingly little to say about
anything as a group. It has been
noticed on campus after campus
that though Greeks may run
campus politics, there is seldom i
such a thing as a “Greek” posi
tion the students usually are in
the game only to be in the game, j
They are after position and pres
tige, not dedicated to the resolu
tion of issues.
There is a sizeable mystique
about a system that continues to
attract millions of new members
yet has no coherent philosophy
or apparent purpose. But it ap
pears that it will be with us for
some time.
