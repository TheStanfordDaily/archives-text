## AWS NOMINEES Sydne Rogers Uncontested for Presidency; Sandra Bergen, Rozella Knox Run for V.P. AWS Vice-President 
### 
The Vice-President implements
the plans of the board, and there
are innumerable things to he
done. Programs such as Fresh
man Integration and Women’ s
Week need to be analyzed and im
proved. An AWS handbook
should be published.
I offer experience: past Presi
dent of Roble, Administrative As
sistant to AWS, and attendance
at the lAWS convention, and a
willingness to work for the inter
est of the women students.
Sandra Bergen

Stanford women aspire to di
verse goals demanding individual
ity, perceptiveness, self-respect
and responsibility. AWS officers
working with the house presidents
and the woman’s administration
can provide a strong, respected
organization with lucid policies
on social regulations and with
programs for guidance toward in
tellectual and social maturity.
As Vice-President, I would en
courage the recognition of each
woman’s individuality and the
development of characteristics
which will be to her benefit in
society.
