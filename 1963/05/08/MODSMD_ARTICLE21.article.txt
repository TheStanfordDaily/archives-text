The Associated Women Stu
dents has HUGE potential (i.e. j
World Unity for Women), which!
has only recently begun to be
realized. The most crucial role i
its officers play is that of making I
Stanford women more aware of i
AWS’ existenc and its poten
tial especially the possibility
of creating more and friendlier
communication among all of us
(United Front Theory),
Once attracted, your enthusi
asm can’t help but lead to a
greater awarenes of your own
part in Stanford life and of the
variety of positive contributions
you can make to it.
