# AWS Corresponding Secretary
## 
### 
As AWS Corresponding Secre
tary, my decisions would he based
on these facts: li It is vital that
AWS Board and Cabinet truly
represent the opinions of women
students, since (heir decisions af
fect every Stanford woman. 2)
AWS should continue to grow as
an organ for the discussion of stu
dent problems and complaints
working always for relevance and
significance; 3) By sponsoring
speakers and seminars such as
Women’s Week, AWS can help
the individual woman student un
derstand those problems uniquely
hers.

The office of AWS Correspond
ing Secretary does not entail
much routine work; consequently,
the girl holding this position
usually adopts a special project.
If elected, I would like to concen
trate my efforts in two areas:
working with the AWS Cabinet

to define concretely the purpose
of AWS for each woman on cam
pus, and increasing personal com
munication between the Dean's
office and the women’s houses.
As a freshman this year I
served on the AWS Housing Com
mittee which prompted me to con
tinue work in and seek a wider
perspective of the entire organi
zation.
