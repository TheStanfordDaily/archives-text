# WRA Vice-President
## 
### 
I am in favor of a program for
better coordination: (1) of WRA
activities and the ASSU calendar;
(2) of WRA and the women stu
dents, with special attention to
a freshman program chairman;
(3) of WRA and the general stu
dent body, by more information
in the Daily; (4) of co-recrea
tional sports, perhaps organized
on the basis of living groups,
rather than the individual, for
greater participation.
