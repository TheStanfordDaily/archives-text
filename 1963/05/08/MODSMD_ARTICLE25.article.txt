The primary purpose of WRA
is to provide recreational oppor
tunities for all Stanford women.
The only way WRA can effec
tively fulfill its purpose is by in
forming all women of current ac
tivities. Presently, communica
tion within the organization is in
efficient.
In addition to strengthening
communication, my aim is to
create a coherent, unified WRA
board which will continually con
sider new ideas and re-evaluate
present activities in an effort to
provide you, (he Stanford wom
an, with stimulating recreational
opportunities.

W.RA stands for Women’s Rec
reation Association. This is my
platform: communication. Not
only what WRA stands for, but
who runs it, for' what purpose,
who benefits, how one may take
part, what activities are offered
throughout the year (tourna
ments, exhibitions, intramural
competition) will be my focus.
This calls for active WRA rep
resentatives in every women’s liv
ing group, including corridor rep
resentatives in Branner and
Roble, for which I would enthusi
astically work.
