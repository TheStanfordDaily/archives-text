# Walsh, Wedin Seek ASSU Presidential Posts; Stevie Aden, Alice Ivey Vie for Vice-Presidency
## Vice-President 
### 
Too often people associate (ho
office of ASSU Vice-President
with paperwork, hut (his need not
be the most important part of the
job.
Although much depends on (he
pending class government and
other by-law changes, I am spe
cifically interested in working
with the new overnight policy
and would concentrate on improv
ing this next year.
Stevie Aden
The office of ASSU Vice-Presi
dent will assume greater impor
tance in the coming school year:
coordination of social activities of
classes may work through a com
mittee under the direction of the
vice-president, (thus increasing
the responsibilities of that office).
I am willing to accept this re
sponsibility and would work to
make such a program effective.
In addition, modifications in
registration of living groupsâ€™s so
cial functions making procedures
more consistent would be one of
my chief goals; I would also work
to improve overnight policy. It
has been an honor to run for
office, and would be a privilege
to serve.
