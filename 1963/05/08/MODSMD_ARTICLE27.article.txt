# Senior Class Vice-President
## 
### 
Next yearâ€™s senior class has un
bounded potential. What we do
with this potential, how we mould
and shape it, and in whal direc
tions we thrust it depends in large
measure on elected class leader
ship.
New dimensions of class inter
est have been opened and more
are available for us to pursue.
The burden of selecting energetic,
enthusiastic leaders capable of
discovering these new dimensions
and pushing forward into them
falls on you, the class of '64.
