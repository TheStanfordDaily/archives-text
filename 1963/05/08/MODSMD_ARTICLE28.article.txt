# Senior Class President

### 
Senior-year activities necessi
tate effective, imaginative ad
ministration to ensure success.
Traditionally, the senior class
president has been responsible for j
the coordination and integration I
of programs pertinent to the last
year at Stanford: Senior Ball, i
graduation, Heritage Fund drive. I
future alumni organization, and!

various social activities (happy
hours, movie nights, etc.).
Establishing a responsible, di
versified senior ex-com to ener
gize class functions would be my
first and most important duty.

Addressing Stanford Seniors. I
wouldn't suggest that by lean
ing on such freshmanisms as
“strength” or “traditional unity”
that the Class of 1964 will be able
to accomplish very much. How
ever, a Class President bringing
energy and common sense to (he
office could make our last year
at Stanford more rewarding
simply by doing a competent job.

As always, the Senior Ball
Heritage Drive, and tasteful se

lection of a class gift will he im
portant. The Happy Hours, which
have fallen down because th e
women have not been attracted to
them, demand particularly close
attention and wider publicity.
