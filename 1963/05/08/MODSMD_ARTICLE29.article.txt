Of all the sensitivities a student
must develop, an awareness of the
j importance of thorough consider
! at ion of all factors is one of the
most vital. We must inspect
issues carefully, basing our stands
on fact, not fancy.
Controversy between the Ad
ministration and students is in
evitable. We will never run the
University, yet we deserve a
healthy say as to how it is oper
ated. In arriving at a solution, it
it the obligation of student lead
ers to see that students interests
are maximized.
I would promise you only a
concerted attempt to best pro
mote students’ interests as de
termined by my constituency and
my conscience.
Mike Walsh
A creative rather than a regu
latory student government is
necessary for the encouragement
and stimulation of contractive
student programs. It is in this
role that student government can
make trew and worthwhile contri
butions, whether it be in a review
of certain University regulations,
a study into areas of the curri
j culum, or an inquiry into Univer
! sity scheduling mechanics.
In this type of action it is im
i perative that we realize the stu
dent’s role. I believe we must be
firm in carrying out this respon
j sibility.
