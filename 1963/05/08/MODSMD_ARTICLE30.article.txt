# Stanford Nine Pummels Gaels, 13-0
## 
### 
Stanford hitlers fattened their
batting averages at the expense
of a hapless St. Mary’s baseball
team yesterday, pummeling the
Gaels into submission. 13-0, at
Sunken Diamond. The game was
switched from the Gael field to
Stanford at the last moment.

JUST ABOUT everybody got in
some licks in the 14-hit attack,
with shortstop Joel Shulman’s
double and two singles in four
trips leading (he Indian sluggers.
Shulman batted in two runs.
Coach Dutch Fehring used
three Stanford pitchers, with
Warren Newell, Dick Kovacevich,
and Darrell Sutherland each go
ing three innings. St. Mary’s got
two doubles off Newell, but
couldn’t get another base runner
until the eighth inning.
Sutherland struck out the side
on nine straight pitches in the
seventh inning and whiffed three
mure Gaels in the eighth and
ninth.
IN THE six-run fifth inning,
Newell led off with a single. A
walk to Bob Cox and a ground
out by Gary Smith put men on
second and third. Then a single
by Kovacevich and a sacrifice fly
by Jim French scored two runs.
Shulman blasted a double down
the left baseline, and Kovacevich
scored when left fielder Bernie
Lambert made his second error
of the day. A single by Post, a
walk to George Thacher, and a
triple by Hob Hollmann plated the

last three runs.
Hollmann. Smith, and French
all had a pair of RBl’s in the one
sided contest.
The win gives Stanford a 22-8
season record going into two cru
cial road games with UCLA this
weekend.
