## Tragic Accident Shows Football's Bad Side 
### PETE KING 
The tragic football accident last Friday afternoon shocked and
saddened all those connected with Stanford sports and served as a j
grim reminder of the potential dangers of rough, contact sports like
football.

That afternoon Lowoll Wilson, a freshman football player, hit
a swinging tackling dummy (he wfong way in practice, resulting in
his near death from a dislocated neck and probable lifetime paraly
sis. Ho is currently at Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital in critical con
dition, conscious, and so completely paralyzed below the neck that
his heartbeat have to be artificially stimulated. The
doctors in charge are not sure to what extent Lowell will regain |
physical control, and it may he weeks before they do know.
LOWELL’S LOSS will he felt by football coach John Ralston
next season. The 220-pound guard played over TO per cent of the
time on last year’s fine freshman
squad, fie was one of the two or
three defensive stars in the Little
Big Game, which Stanford won,
3-0. This year in spring practice
drills, he had started out on the
sixth string, and through hard
work and dedication had made
the third string at the time of the
accident.
Even though, as trainer Con
nie Jarvis points out, the acci
dent was a "one-in-a-million oc
curence” with numerous factors
involved, it’s a painful reminder
of the unfortunate side of foot
ball injuries. Even with all the
modern equipment and training
techniques to develop the body’s
resistance to rough contact, a
tragic event like last Friday’s is
still possible.

There’ll Always Be Risk Incidents like this one and the
rising number of deaths and per
manent injuries in high school and professional football have tainted
what is fast becoming, if not already, the national sport. Not a few
people have strongly advocated much more strict regulations, or
even outright abolition of the game on the grounds that the damage
it can do to a player isn’t justified no matter how popular football is.
BUT THEN one would be hard put to name many popular spec
tator sports where there is no risk of serious injury. Basketball,
baseball, hockey, and boxing all have their share of injuries and
even fatalities in a typical year. The plain fact is that there is always
going to be some risk involved in football. Part of the beauty of the
game are the hard-hitting fullback, the perfectly executed block, the
slamming together of two 1500-pound lines.
Rather than being eliminated, these aspects of (he game have
been improved and refined by the introduction of new safety equip
ment and muscle training methods which allow the body to take
more punishment. While not insuring complete safety, they have
reduced the risk of playing football far below what it was in the
days when a man donned only two shoulder pads, a hip guard, and
a leather helmet and charged full tilt into the line.
Stanford’s 72-year history of no fatal or near-fatal sports acci
dents bears out the statement that risk has been minimized. An
accident like Lowell Wilson’s serves to remind us that modern
methods can’t ever eliminate it.
