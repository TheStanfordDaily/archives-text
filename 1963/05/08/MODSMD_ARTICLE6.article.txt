# Gosselin Explains Eugene lonesco's Anti-Play Theory
## 
### FOSTER HIRSCH 
"Realism in the theatre is a
fraud.” As seen by Jean Gosselin
of the French Department in his
discussion yesterday, this is the
basic tenet of the French avant
garde playwright, Eugene lones
co. Gosselin suggested that from
this premise lonesco has formu
lated his theory of the anti-play.
“lonesco is emotionally against
system, order, discipline, and
strait-jackets of all sorts,” stated
Gosselin. Consequently, lonesco
dislikes convention in the theatre
and wants for the playwright an
unrestrained freedom.
HOWEVER, lonesco finds it
difficult to "exteriorize his ideas”
principally because “he is against
commitment,” said Gosselin. Also,
lonesco is often quite contradic
tory; he opposes “immutable the
ory, yet is often dogmatic him
self.”
Gosselin indicated that lonesco
has certain basic ideas around
which his style is integrated. He
sees life as essentially meaning
less: “man is completely over
whelmed by the objects around
him;” man is alone, imprisoned
within the confines of language,
Although his themes are poten
tially tragic, Gosselin added that
lonesco “makes us laugh at the
absurdity of life.”
In his plays, language loses all
meaning, characters can’t com
municate, reality is “dislocated.”
"objects live,” and “symbols are
materialized.” It is an illogical
world of “new revelations.”
Gosselin mentioned that “Vic
tims of Duty,” “The Chairs,”
“The Lesson,” and "Rhinoceros”
are particularly indicative of lo
nesco’s state of mind and the
atrical techniques.
