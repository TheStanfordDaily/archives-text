United Press International
SANTO DOMINGO—Street rioting broke out yesterday between
police throwing tear gas bombs and several hundred youths sup
porting a surprise walkout of 20,000 Dominican government work
ers. Authorities charged Communists wore behind the demonstra
tions and arrested more than 50 men. The walkout was called by
government workers during a lull in the heated political dispute be
tween Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
The strike erupted as Dominican President Juan Bosch eased
his war threats against Haiti and pledged not to resort to force to
solve his dispute with that country unless it further abused Domini
can political rights. But he kept the country on a war footing.
The internal situation remained so critical in Haiti that the
United Stales ordered dependents of U.S. personnel there to leave
the country today by chartered air lift. Private American citizens
also were urged to leave. Undersecretary of State George W. Ball
said late yesterday that the Haitian government “seems to bo in a
kind of progressive disintegration.”
In New York the United Nations Security Council was sum
moned to meet this afternoon to consider Haiti’s complaints of Do
minican aggression. The Haiti position was said to have strong back
ing of the powerful U.N. African bloc. Diplomatic sources said the
United States hoped to block the meeting, since it opposed Haitian
President Francois Duvalier.
NEGROES OVERWHELM BIRMINGHAM COPS BIRMINGHAM,
Ala.- Negro remonstrators overwhelmed local police by sheer force
of numbers on two occasions yesterday and Gov. George C. Wallace
ordered 250 highway patrolmen to come to the aid of this strife-torn
city.
Fire hoses again were used to rout demonstrators when they
began hurling rocks at police and firemen, once from the steps of a
church. About 3,000 Negroes took part in the demonstrations. The
clash occurred after the Negroes had twice out-flanked authorities
and swept into the downtown section where they sang and chanted
anti-segregation protests.
Former Brooklyn Dodgers baseball star Jackie Robinson said
in New York that he will lead anti-segregation demonstrations in
Birmingham next week.
