# Society Asks Too Little Of Individual—Heschel
## 
### 
I lie problem of our society is in not demanding enough from
the individual,” Dr. Abraham J. Heschel told a packed audience
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium last night.
In the second of a series of three lectures entitled “Who Is
Man. - ' Dr. Heschel spoke on mans “Search of Meaning.” Todav.

►he said, self-interest of the indi
vidual has assumed the status of
dignity. The tragedy of our civili
zation is the liquidation of the in
ner man.
Our society lends to accept
sheer being as ultimate. “But,”
said Dr. Heschel, “the acceptance
of being as ultimate accepts a
problem for a solution.” The ques-
I tion of the source of being is still
[ unanswered.
DR. HESCHEL held that man
| can find meaning in the Biblical
insight that life without commit
ment is not worth living. “M an
cannot think of himself as hu
man,” ho said, “without feeling
a sense of indebtedness. The dig
nity of human existence is in reci
procity.” Meaning must refer to
something larger than sheer exis
tence.
Thus the only way to avoid des
pair is to be a need instead of an
end, said Dr. Heschel. Our very
existence is a need to give, to sat
isfy the debt we owe for our ex
istence. This is transcendent
meaning. “But,” Dr. Heschel
added, "transcendent meaning is
a meaning that is beyond our com
prehension.” It requires a sense
of awe and wonder to accept such
a meaning.
Dr. Heschel will conclude h i s
series of lectures today at 4:13
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
speaking on “Existence and Exal
tation.”
