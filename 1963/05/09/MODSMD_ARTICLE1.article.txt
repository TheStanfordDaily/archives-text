# Meaning of Existence Found In Spiritual Exultation—Heschel
## 
### LES BROWN 
“The meaning of existence is found in spiritual exaltation,”
said Dr. Abraham j. Heschel yesterday in his concluding speech
of the West Lecture Series.
Heschel cited as the great danger of this age for mankind the
retention of homo sapien instincts with the loss of essential hu-

manity. “We must,” he said,<
"save the inner man from extinc
tion.”
THE BIBLICAL paradox con
tained in the view of man as both
the creature created in God’s im
age and a creature who was cre
ated from dust and will return to
dust is resolvable. Dust, asserts
Heschel, is I lie stuff of man, but
what matter's in the end Is that
man’s image is derived from
God. What determines humanity
is, after all, the image of man,
not the stuff
Not only is our being as hu
mans always on trial, there is
also the problem of freedom.
Freedom is a thing of grandeur
and sacrifice. It is man’s ability
to surpass himself. And as such,
it must bo seen as an event, as
something unique, something re
moved from the ordinary, some
thing apart from process.
A sense of embarrassment,
stated Heschel, is a minimum re
quirement for retaining our hu
manity. Despair is not an alibi
for conscience. “Millions are
starving, while new hotels are
going up in Las Vegas.” We can’t
externalize our failures, he warn
ed. We cannot have a scape-God.
We must be ashamed for what
humanity has done with the
world, for what we have done
with the world. Religion is noth
ing more than what we do with
our sense of embarrassment.
IN SPEAKING of death. Hes
chel held that the real problem
is not death, but the sanctifica
tion of life. This is accomplished
through celebration. Now', man
through God’s concern for him
has been given right to consump
tion, and the celebration of man’s
moments of consumption is of
the essence in sanctifying life.
Celebration is then the lending of
spiritual forms to everyday acts.
In referring to our ago, Heschel
noted that the Golden Rule has
been so perverted that it now
reads, “Suspect thy neighbor as
thyself.” And this attitude and
others like it necessitate a sense
of embarrassment.
