BIRMINGHAM, Ala A shaky off-again, on-again “truce” in
Birmingham’s explosive racial battle apparently was salvaged last
night when integration leader Dr. Martin Luther king Jr. was freed
from jail.
The truce was announced early yesterday afternoon and was
applauded by President Kennedy. But within a few hours after the
Chief Executive spoke, King was convicted and jailed on month-old
charges of leading a segregation protest march. His arrest caused
confusion among other Negro leaders, some of whom said the turn
of events negated the earlier agreement with white leaders.
OAS MEETS -WASHINGTON The chairman of the Organization

Dominican Republic to refrain from any threat or use of force that
may aggravate the 11-day-old crisis. Asserting its priority in the
tense situation, the council unanimously agreed to enlarge and
broaden the powers of its five-man fact-finding mission to try to
keep the enighboring Caribbean Island republics from drifting into
war. The action was taken after a two-hour, closed-door session of
OAS diplomats.
