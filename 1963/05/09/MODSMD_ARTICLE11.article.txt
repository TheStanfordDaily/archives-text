Next Monday, the HR will hold
another open meeting to discuss
general opinions regarding the
principles of the organization, as
well as to consider possible re
vision of Article VI of the pro
posed constitution, concerning
Policy Board operations.
According to Kendall, any part
of the constitution may be revised
if enough members feel it neces
sary. It is hoped that each mem
ber will contribute at least his
general views in a written para
graph or two; specific arguments
for or against the proposed con
stitution are particularly wel
come.
In order that decisions on the
j constitution be reached before the
! end of the quarter, HR members
are asked to submit their written
suggestions to either Charles
Kendall, Latin America Desk, or
Lawrence de Bivort, Stanford
United Nations.
A copy of the petition is on the
HR bulletin board in the Loft at
Tresidder Union; copies of the
proposed constitution will be
available next Monday afternoon
at 3.
Members are requested to
check The Daily for further de
velopments and details, and to
call Kendal] at DA 6-0708 or de
Bivort at DA 3-5016 any evening,
regarding questions.
All meetings concerning the
functions of HR and the proposed
constitution are open to the pub
