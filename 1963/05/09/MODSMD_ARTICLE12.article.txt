# Collection at Baldwin Speech Curtailed by Student Police
## 
### JONNE STEINBAUM 
A collection for the Congress
on Racial Equality by the Break
ers eating club was curtailed yes
terday by the Stanford Student
Police outside Memorial Auditori
um a few minutes after James
Baldwin’s address. The student
police took collection cartons
from Breakers members, but un
solicited contributions continued
to accumulate.
The actions of the student po
lice were backed by the authori
ty of Fred Nelson, Student Fi
nancial Manager, who was apply
ing an ASSU By-Law stating that
“No public drive to solicit funds
from members of the Association,
for charitable or any other pur
poses, shall be held without ap
proval in advance by the Legisla
ture.”
NELSON also cited the Com
mittee on Public Exercises' man
ual of suggested policies which
states that “Contributions may
not be solicited at any public
meeting by anyone for any pur
pose, however worthy . .
In response to Nelson’s actions,
Breakers Club unanimously pass
ed a resolution last night stating
that their collection had been
broken up because of Nelson’s in
structions. The resolution con
tinued: “Representatives of the
Club questioned Mr. Nelson min
utes before Mr. Baldwin’s speech
as to his policy on this collection.
Nelson refused to discuss the
question, and Breakers in good
faith proceeded to collect funds.
Student police intervened after
about $l2O had been collected.
The smallness of Nelson’s atti
tude does no credit to him or to
the University. Those who were
prevented by his action from con
tributing should send contribu
tions directly to C.O.R.E. or
should support the Civil Liberties
Caucus meeting Thursday.”
Dave French, a spokesman for
Breakers, said that the club had
decided yesterday morning to
hold a collection in order that
Breakers and “the University
community could express them
selves on this question.” After
unsuccessful attempts to reach
Nelson and then being refused to
see him Breakers decided to hold
the collection believing it to be
“in the spirit” of the situation,
French said.
MARTY LEBOWITZ of the Po
litical Union’s Civil Liberties
Caucus which sponsored Bald
win’s speech jointly with Break
ers and The Committee on Public-
Exercises, saw Nelson yesterday
afternoon. Nelson told him then
that University policy prohibited
such solicitation.
Lebowitz, prior to his introduc
tion of Baldwin, announced that
Breakers would bo collecting
funds for C.O.R.E.
Nelson said this was in direct
contradiction to his statement to
Lebowitz. Lebowitz said last
night that he “saw no reason why
people shouldn’t be able to con
tribute if they wanted to. There
was no coercion at all.” He added
that an important distinction in
volved was that the collection
took place outside of the public
meeting.
Prof. Wilfred Stone who was
present with Breakers members
during the collection and student
police action said that he under -
stood collections had to be clear
ed but added “It’s too bad not to
let such impulses have their full
advance.”
French cited Baldwin’s com
ment made in reference to deseg
regation that it wasn’t a question
of legality but of what was right.

let such impulses have their full
advance.”
French cited Baldwin’s com
ment made in reference to deseg
regation that it wasn’t a question
of legality but of what was right.
A collection for the Congress
on Racial Equality by the Break
ers eating club was curtailed yes
terday by the Stanford Student
Police outside Memorial Auditori
um a few minutes after James
Baldwin’s address. The student
police took collection cartons
from Breakers members, but un
solicited contributions continued
to accumulate.
The actions of the student po
lice were backed by the authori
ty of Fred Nelson, Student Fi
nancial Manager, who was apply
ing an ASSU By-Law stating that
“No public drive to solicit funds
from members of the Association,
for charitable or any other pur
poses, shall be held without ap
proval in advance by the Legisla
ture.”
NELSON also cited the Com
mittee on Public Exercises' man
ual of suggested policies which
states that “Contributions may
not be solicited at any public
meeting by anyone for any pur
pose, however worthy . .
In response to Nelson’s actions,
Breakers Club unanimously pass
ed a resolution last night stating
that their collection had been
broken up because of Nelson’s in
structions. The resolution con
tinued: “Representatives of the
Club questioned Mr. Nelson min
utes before Mr. Baldwin’s speech
as to his policy on this collection.
Nelson refused to discuss the
question, and Breakers in good
faith proceeded to collect funds.
Student police intervened after
about $l2O had been collected.
The smallness of Nelson’s atti
tude does no credit to him or to
the University. Those who were
prevented by his action from con
tributing should send contribu
tions directly to C.O.R.E. or
should support the Civil Liberties
Caucus meeting Thursday.”
Dave French, a spokesman for
Breakers, said that the club had
decided yesterday morning to
hold a collection in order that
Breakers and “the University
community could express them
selves on this question.” After
unsuccessful attempts to reach
Nelson and then being refused to
see him Breakers decided to hold
the collection believing it to be
“in the spirit” of the situation,
French said.
MARTY LEBOWITZ of the Po
litical Union’s Civil Liberties
Caucus which sponsored Bald
win’s speech jointly with Break
ers and The Committee on Public-
Exercises, saw Nelson yesterday
afternoon. Nelson told him then
that University policy prohibited
such solicitation.
Lebowitz, prior to his introduc
tion of Baldwin, announced that
Breakers would bo collecting
funds for C.O.R.E.
Nelson said this was in direct
contradiction to his statement to
Lebowitz. Lebowitz said last
night that he “saw no reason why
people shouldn’t be able to con
tribute if they wanted to. There
was no coercion at all.” He added
that an important distinction in
volved was that the collection
took place outside of the public
meeting.
Prof. Wilfred Stone who was
present with Breakers members
during the collection and student
police action said that he under -
stood collections had to be clear
ed but added “It’s too bad not to
let such impulses have their full
advance.”
