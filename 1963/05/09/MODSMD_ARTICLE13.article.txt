# Baldwin Examines Nightmare' History Of Racial Problems
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD 
"When a white man despises
a black man, ho is despising
something in himself. I'm not the
‘nigger’ here, that word is not my
invention. And if I’m not the
‘nigger’ here, then who is?’’
Thus spoke James Baldwin,
Negro essayist and novelist, to
the overflow crowd at Memorial
Auditorium yesterday afternoon.
With 1800 people filling the audi
torium, over 250 sat outside in a
light drizzle to listen to the
speech over loud-speakers.
BALDWIN prefaced his re
marks by quoting James Joyce,
“History is a nightmare from
which I am trying to awaken.”
He then observed that the current
situation in Birmingham has pre
sented the nation, not just the
citizens of Alabama and the Deep
South, “the enormous question
of how to undo a nightmare
which has taken a hundred years
to create.”
The controversial author
blamed three factors of Ameri
can life for this “nightmare.” He
first derided “our curious politi
cal structure” which finds each
political party using Ihe Negro
vote “as a club to beat the other
party with.” He pointed out that
while a President might appoint
civil rights liberals in the North,
he dared only appoint conserva
tive. segregationist judges in the
South.
Another damaging factor was
the vast sums of money spent to
preserve segregation, which most
Americans, said Baldwin, still re
gard as the “American way of
life.” The black man is still
thought of as inferior and thus
gets inferior jobs. “In the North,”
he continued, “wo have ‘de facto
segregation’. That is, the Negroes
are segregated, but no one did
it.” And so there are ghettoes,
where “squalor is piled high in
stead of wide and is called a
housing development.”
The effect of these two factors,
the political and the economic, is
the demoralization of the Negro.
This demoralization leads to de
spair and hence to the advent of
groups like the Black Muslims.
"Forget the movement, and find
the cause,” counselled Baldwin.
The only solution that Baldwin
could see to the “nightmare” was
for each individual to examine
himself and (he “realities of so
ciety” in order to find values to
fill the “moral vacuum” in Amer
ica today. It is only when “men
become men, not just status sym
bols,” that a moral change will
be wrought in America, he said.
AS AN EXAMPLE of the cur
rent moral dilemma, Baldwin
pointed to the Meredith case.
Just after James Meredith had
been escorted into the University
of Mississippi, and just before
the serious riots broke out, Presi
dent Kennedy spoke on television
to the people of Mississippi and
the nation. He appealed to Mis
sissippi honor “as if he had never
heard of the Reconstruction.”
Kennedy’s speech had two bad
effects, Baldwin said; 1> It dis
affected all Negroes because they
are tired of hearing that desegre
gation is legal. “They want to
hear someone say that it is
right”; 21 It laid a trap for those
Southern whites who live in the
“moral vacuum” and wanted to
hear what they suspect might be
true namely, that desegregation
is right.
In a question-and-answer peri
od after the speech, Baldwin care
fully distinguished desegregation
! from integration. “Integration is
1 not what I’m interested in,” he
5 declared. “I don’t want my daugh
ter to go to a white school just
1 to meet your son. It is desegrega
tion I want—desegregation that
: brings down the walls of the pow
; er structure that oppresses us. I
■ do not want love, but a chance to
’ be free.”
i Baldwin concluded by warning
against apathy on the part of the
): government and the people in sit
- j nations like Birmingham. The
) { non-violent methods of Dr. Mar
■, tin Luther King will not succeed
. j unless King and his student fol
lowers are given help, he assert
-1 ed. And if non-violence fails, then
I i violence will be used- “Violence
•; (hat sprang from despair created
1 in your name.”

housing development.”
The effect of these two factors,
the political and the economic, is
the demoralization of the Negro.
This demoralization leads to de
spair and hence to the advent of
groups like the Black Muslims.
"Forget the movement, and find
the cause,” counselled Baldwin.
The only solution that Baldwin
could see to the “nightmare” was
for each individual to examine
himself and (he “realities of so
ciety” in order to find values to
fill the “moral vacuum” in Amer
ica today. It is only when “men
become men, not just status sym
bols,” that a moral change will
be wrought in America, he said.
AS AN EXAMPLE of the cur
rent moral dilemma, Baldwin
pointed to the Meredith case.
Just after James Meredith had
been escorted into the University
of Mississippi, and just before
the serious riots broke out, Presi
dent Kennedy spoke on television
to the people of Mississippi and
the nation. He appealed to Mis
sissippi honor “as if he had never
heard of the Reconstruction.”
Kennedy’s speech had two bad
effects, Baldwin said; 1> It dis
affected all Negroes because they
are tired of hearing that desegre
gation is legal. “They want to
hear someone say that it is
right”; 21 It laid a trap for those
Southern whites who live in the
“moral vacuum” and wanted to
hear what they suspect might be
true namely, that desegregation
is right.
In a question-and-answer peri
od after the speech, Baldwin care
fully distinguished desegregation
! from integration. “Integration is
1 not what I’m interested in,” he
5 declared. “I don’t want my daugh
ter to go to a white school just
1 to meet your son. It is desegrega
tion I want—desegregation that
: brings down the walls of the pow
; er structure that oppresses us. I
■ do not want love, but a chance to
’ be free.”
i Baldwin concluded by warning
against apathy on the part of the
): government and the people in sit
- j nations like Birmingham. The
) { non-violent methods of Dr. Mar

"When a white man despises
a black man, ho is despising
something in himself. I'm not the
‘nigger’ here, that word is not my
invention. And if I’m not the
‘nigger’ here, then who is?’’
Thus spoke James Baldwin,
Negro essayist and novelist, to
the overflow crowd at Memorial
Auditorium yesterday afternoon.
With 1800 people filling the audi
torium, over 250 sat outside in a
light drizzle to listen to the
speech over loud-speakers.
BALDWIN prefaced his re
marks by quoting James Joyce,
“History is a nightmare from
which I am trying to awaken.”
He then observed that the current
situation in Birmingham has pre
sented the nation, not just the
citizens of Alabama and the Deep
South, “the enormous question
of how to undo a nightmare
which has taken a hundred years
to create.”
The controversial author
blamed three factors of Ameri
can life for this “nightmare.” He
first derided “our curious politi
cal structure” which finds each
political party using Ihe Negro
vote “as a club to beat the other
party with.” He pointed out that
while a President might appoint
civil rights liberals in the North,
he dared only appoint conserva
tive. segregationist judges in the
South.
Another damaging factor was
the vast sums of money spent to
preserve segregation, which most
Americans, said Baldwin, still re
gard as the “American way of
life.” The black man is still
thought of as inferior and thus
gets inferior jobs. “In the North,”
he continued, “wo have ‘de facto
segregation’. That is, the Negroes
are segregated, but no one did
it.” And so there are ghettoes,
where “squalor is piled high in
stead of wide and is called a
housing development.”
The effect of these two factors,
the political and the economic, is
the demoralization of the Negro.
