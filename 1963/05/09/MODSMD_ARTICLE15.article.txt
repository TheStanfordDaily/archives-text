## Vote 'No' for Class Government 
### BEN STOLPA Class of ’66 
The opportunity to partake in a democratic process of de
ciding whether to retain or abolish their class government can
be presented to the class of ’66. The people who have demanded
their rights in voicing their opinions, even though they may have
agreed in principle, not method, with the former Ex-com’s de
cision, will have the privilege to do so. (“. . . we do not object
to the abolition itself, we do object to tho method by which the
decision was reached,” signed. Sue Linehan, Wynn Meagher. Jan
Orkney, Judy Sterling, and Sue Winchester, The Daily, April 24;
and “. . . the goal of abolishing class government may be war
ranted by the general lack of enthusiasm in class activities |but]
it should he done by a vole of all concerned rather than by the
unilateral action of the officers with the support of some of their
friends,” as said by Sue Henderson, The Daily, April 23.)
There are, however, those that, for whatever reasons they
may have—an honest interest and belief in class government and
its possibilities, or a chronic compulsion to “do” things and be
mere “glory hounds,” to quote Miss Henderson again desire
to keep fighting the uphill battle. That it is an uphill battle any
former member of the now dissolved Ex-com will be glad to
testify to. It is felt that it has been well demonstrated during
the past year by the lethargy of the class that concern in this
matter is lacking. Moreover, the dispersal in the sophomore year
ito separate living groups that will be the foci of future interest,
will present further detriment to the possibility of an actively
unified class. Even with modifications of the existing set-up
there is doubt that a large enough number of people would
favor it and warrant its continuing struggle against obso
lescence. Even the graduations arrangements in the senior year
could be handled by a special committee under the guidance of
an improved ASSU.
Since there has not been provided (through oversight?) a
hox on the ballot in which the student can voice his desire not to
have a class government (after all, the class members should
have an opportunity to voice their opinion "by a vote of all con
cerned”—even if it is negative!) a petition is being circulated
for the purpose of placing this issue to retain or abolish class
government- on the ballot. To those who, rightfully, ask to have
a voice in this matter that concerns them so directly, I would
suggest that they take the time to sign this petition. Or maybe
there is too much torpor to make even this effort?
The opportunity to abolish class government is present for
those who wisely realize its ineffectiveness and uselessness, and,
in case the class does decide that it needs a cohesive body, it now
has the opportunity to continue the pompous and meaningless
institution of class government.
