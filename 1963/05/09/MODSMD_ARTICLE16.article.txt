Editors, The Daily:
We are of Iwo minds about writing this letter. First we feel
the need to answer some of the at tanks which have been leveled
at Mike Walsh during the past week. Second we feel the need
of maintaining our own self-dignity by remaining above the low
level of negativism which has prevailed during the last week of
the campaign. With this in mind let us say that:
(It The charges attributed to Mr. Walsh in Friday’s Daily
(“Candidate Walsh Charges Malicious Campaigning”) were never
made by him. Rather they were direct quotes taken fTom Mike
Saks’ letter of the previous day.
(2) The statement made by Dennis Sweeney in Wednesday’s
Daily that “Armin’s Four Freedoms, according to Walsh, should
evoke indignant response from the more responsible members
of the Student Body” is false. Rather Mr. Walsh said that “To
assert that Armin’s Four Freedoms ‘will enable Stanford to at
last take its rightful place among the truly great universities of
the world’ should evoke indignant response from the more re
sponsible members of the Student Body who realize that Stan
ford’s excellence as an institution of higher learning is depend
ent on many more important factors than Mr. Rosencranz’s dec
laration of Student Independence.” Furthermore, in his letter,
Walsh was clearly attacking Mr. Rosencranz’s arguments, not
his principles.
It is our hope that this will clear up some existing miscon
ceptions.
