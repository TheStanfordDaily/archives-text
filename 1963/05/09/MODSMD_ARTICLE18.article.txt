Editors, The Daily:
I hate to knock an article, but T. Tuft’s “It’s Lacrosse . .
didn’t present an accurate picture of what promises to be a
strong Stanford sport.
Lacrosse may he a minor sport nationwide hut this will not
remain true for long. It is definitely a major sport at many mid
west and Eastern colleges. Schools which don't have spring foot
ball practice usually field a lot of football and basketball play
ers. Given good coaching and a depth of athletes, as here where
graduate students can play, lacrosse is a definite asset to an
athletic program.
The game has been called brutal and this for most, specta
tors enhances the thrill of watching a game. It is by no means
lethal and there are rules and penalties as well as head and arm
protectors. The controversy as to which is rougher, football or
lacrosse is in point because the sports are really on a par. The
body check in lacrosse simulates a football block. Football prac
tices and games involve much body to body smashing in order to
go places. Lacrosse has more finesse taut also involves possi
bilities of getting knocked about with the lacrosse stick.
Lacrosse could not be called boring. Like soccer or ice
hockey it operates on the simple principle of getting a ball into
a goal. The game moves quickly, quite like basketball in the way
plays are attempted. Carrying out the plays involves individual
player skill, team cooperation, and a few hundred backers yelling
encouragement.
Stanford is lucky to be starting this sport at the club level.
Most sports begin intramurally, go varsity, and then ex-collegi
ans etc. play in clubs. For 1 example Jimmy Brown of the Cleve
land Browns used to play for the Cleveland Lacrosse club. The
school has the opportunity to watch undergrads and grads com
pete at a high level in an excellent sport.

I went to the Joffre Debate with the interested mood of a
French student going to listen to debates devoted to the appreci
ation of French policy. It would not be right to say that I know
now just as much on the problem of French nuclear force as
before I went; as a matter of fact, I know much less because the
few clear ideas I had on the problem completely vanished in the
huge mess originated by the debaters.
The specific question was; “Does the French independent
nuclear force add a new threat to world peace?” The first to
speak was Miss Edith Brown, of Stanford. Just looking at her
expression during her speech gave you the feeling that she was
advertising washing machines on Channel 5. And listening to
what she said was very enlightening, too, since within 15 min
utes. she pointed out the influence of De Gaulle’s opposition to
Kennedy on the relations between Khrushchev and Mai-Tse-Tung
without forgetting the consequences of Adenauer’s position on
the future of England, explaining very clearly how all the
world’s affairs should be solved. The conclusion of this rapid
analysis was that De Gaulle was wrong.
As for the supporters of De Gaulle, most of them carried
their- proofs so nicely that you never knew before the conclusions
whether the argument was strongly in favor of De Gaulle or
strongly against him. One of them explained that the security
of Europe was no more guaranteed by the U.S.A. and that
France needs an atomic force: “Why does Russia not attack
France? Because France now has Mirage IV bombers able to
carry bombs to Russia.” And this is really nice of him when you
think that France now has 3 of these planes (there were 4 but
one crashed recently, reducing our tactical force by 25 per cent).
Attending this debate, I was willing to approve any convinc
ing arguments in favor or not in favor of the French policy,
since I feel that such a problem does not have a strict answer
by yes or no. That is probably why the speakers who tried to
say that the answer was “obviously yes" or “obviously no” failed
so sadly. Among the 6 speakers, Mr. Bischoff of Stanford was
by far the best one, explaining his position, and being the only
one not to consider that the goal of the debate was to speak as
fast as possible.*
To summarize, the Stanford team won, but this does not
mean that they were the best debaters: it just means that the
opposite team was still worse.

Editors, The Daily:
It has recently come forcibly to my attention that our so
called non-profit Stanford Bookstore is either in reality making
considerable profit—or it operating a most inefficient organiza
tion.
I wrote to Blackwell’s Bookstore in England a few weeks ago
(which, incidentally, is a profit-making organization), requesting
a catalogue (with prices included) of the Loeb Classical Library.
This is only one of various foreign publishing firms whose books
are dispensed by our bookstore. The price quoted by Blackwell’s
(shipping charges included) was $2,64 per volume. These books
sell at Stanford for about $3.30, with discount included.
The $2.64 includes 5 per cent postage; the base retail price
at Blackwell’s is $2.52. Now this $2.52 includes a certain percent
age for operating expenses and for profit let’s say 15 per cent—
making the wholesale price of each book about $2.15. Add the
5 per cent shipping charge necessary to get each volume from
the British publishers to the Stanford Bookstore—and we have
a cost to our store of approximately $2.26.
I ask—why must a “non-profit” organization charge nearly
40 per cent ($l.OO on each $2.26 book) for “operating expenses”?
I wonder if this 40 per cent operations charge is included in the
prices of some of those $lO-$l5 textbooks which so often appear
on required book lists. ~ i • '• |i ;■ ■■ ;
If Stanford’s Bookstore contimies its high-price policy, may I
suggest that those students interested in obtaining foreign texts
at reasonable prices contact Blackwell’s, Broadstreet, Oxford,
England? (I am not, by the way, affiliated in any way with that
organization.)

Mr. King’s rather transparent defense of football in yester
day’s Daily, prompted by the crippling injury to Lowell Wilson,
lauded, among other things, the “beauty” of bodily contact sport.
I submit there is nothing beautiful about “the slamming to
gether of two fifteen-hundred-pound lines”; that it is, instead,
unmitigated barbarism, sophisticated sadism incommensurate
with any reasonably civilized definition of athletic skill. Any
“game” where the means, if not the end, is the systematic
smashing of one’s fellow man inculcates Late Jurassic instincts
more worthy of Tyrannosaurus than supposedly cultivated hu
man beings. Our oestrual pleasure in Saturday afternoon spec
taculars echoes Roman gladiatorial contests, and is exceeded in
manality only by the maudlin sentimentality of cheerleaders,
pep bands, rallies and like trivia. Football, and for that matter,
boxing, hockey and other contact sports, produces a dangerously
aggressive attitude that cannot help but carry over into “every
day” life. And the businessman, politician, police chief, or gen
eral who thinks ho can lower his head and storm the world by
force may very well get his neck broken.

Editors, The Daily:
In your poll on the “contentment" of Stanford students with
student government, you asked the question “Do you think
ASSU organizations such as Ram’s Head, Political Union, and
the Institute of International Relations should receive support
front compulsory student fees.” I would like to inform you that
Ram's Head has never been the recipient of “compulsory student
fees.” We are, and have always been, completely a self-support
ing organization, paying maintenance costs for our use of Me
morial Auditorium. The benefits which we derive from our as
sociation with ASSU are the use of an ASSU office and the
permission to use Memorial Auditorium. From our profits we
have purchased a number of improvements for Mem And, and
in addition have endowed more than $20,000 in a scholarship
fund. I repeat, we resent very much the implication that we
receive any financial assistance from the fees paid by the stu
dents.

Editors, The Daily:
One can only wonder what The Daily had in mind when it
published Mr. Killingsworth’s comments about the student-audi
ences at the Sunday Flicks. An article like this can be taken
only as an endorsement of the asinine horseplay—often in very
poor taste and rarely funny—which has, until recently, made
the Flicks almost unbearable.
“These kids just aren’t like they used to be,” says the pro
jectionist. That’s correct; perhaps they’re growing up.
