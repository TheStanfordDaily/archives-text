### ROGER MENDELSON 
Sigma Chi’s 7-1 win over Beta
highlighted the past week’s play
in intramural softball. It was the
third win this year for the de
fending university champions but
only their second game; they had
one forfeit win.
Batting was their forte as they
accumulated 11 hits. Shortstop
Nels Christensen was the top hit
ter with a double and triple. Two
hits apiece went to three others,
Wayne Pavlic, Jack Gilbert, and
Marc McGinnes.
In the eating club league. El
Capitan and Breakers each won
its fourth game, setting up the
best-contested race in any of the
mural leagues. Two of the best
teams in the softball competition,
they meet today in a game w'hich
will virtually decide the league
championship.
BREAKERS beat El Campo,
6-1, as pitcher Rich Lonergan was
deprived of his second consecu
tive shutout when Breakers’ only
two errors of the game resulted
in an unearned run in the sixth.
Lonergan heat El Toro two weeks
ago, S O.
Lonergan was also the batting
star of the game along with Phil
LeVeen. Both of them tripled in
a run, while Lonergan had a sin
gle and walk and LeVeen added
two singles.
CAP barely squeaked by Los
Arcos, 6-5, scoring three runs in
the bottom of the sixth. Handi
capped by the absence of their
top third baseman, Dick Bail,
poor fielding at that position con
tributed heavily to a four-run in
ning for Arcos and a 2-5 lead
early in the game.
In the upset of the week. Serra
beat Law School, 3-2. Law left
numerous runners on base, in
cluding two in the seventh, as
timely hitting was lacking. Serra,
on the other hand, put three of
its seven hits together for a two
run fourth inning, and then won
the game in the fifth on Law
fielding errors; the winning run
scored when a hard throw-in
from the outfield was mishandled
by the pitcher with two outs and
the bases loaded. Law is now tied
with Fremont (3-1).
ATO remained ahead in its
league (3-0) although DU played
them to a 5-5, 12-inning tie. The

gamp will eventually be contin
uer) from this point to decide Ihc
winner.
FIJI and Deke, both 4-0, are
tied for a league lead, and Kappa
Sig won its third straight, heat
ing Phi Kap, 7-1. In the Wilbur
league, Arroyo (4-0) lead 1 ., and
in the grad student league, Neu
trinos (3-0 i is in first.

ma Chi I, Rinconada I, and Neu
