# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## Card Baseballers Can Still Top CIBA 
### Glenn Alford 
No ono knows who’s going 1o win the most tightly contested
race in CIBA history. Ask any of the four coaches whose teams are
in (he thick of the race who’s going to win and you'll very likely
get four different answers,
USC is in the driver’s seat with a 7-5 record compared to Stan
ford’s 6-5. Actually UCLA is tied with the Trojans for the lead at
8-6, but the Bruins are for all practical purposes out of contention.
UCLA’s two remaining games are with Stanford this weekend in
Los Angeles, and (he best pitching staff in the CIBA is ready to face
the Bruins.
DARRELL SUTHERLAND AND JIM LONBORG should heat
UCLA twice in the spacious Bruin ballpark.
The other team in contention is Santa Clara (7-6) hut the Bron
cos have no more than the merest chance to repeat as league champs.
Their three remaining games are with USC <2i and Stanford.
This leaves things squarely up to the Cards and Trojans who
assume the favorite’s role because they have beaten Stanford three
out of four games. In ease of a title tie between two teams, the
team (hat won the four-game series between the two clubs is
crowned as champ.
Stanford Coach Dutch Fohring figures Stanford will win the
championship, and bases this on Stanford’s tripping UCLA and Cal
twice and Santa Clara once, while Southern Cal loses to Santa Clara
and Cal once. Such a finish would leave Stanford 11-5 and Southern
Cal 9-7, UCLA tied with Santa Clara at 8-8 and Cal in (he rear at
313.
Stanford's Remarkable Pitchers
Stanford owes its present second place position to one of the
most remarkable pitching staffs ever to dazzle the CIBA. Perhaps
never in the league has a pitching staff recorded such incredible
statistics.
THE STANFORD TEAM EARNED RUN AVERAGE is 1.43.
Most pitchers are lucky if they have an earned run average twice
that figure. Stanford hasn’t got a pitcher over 2.0. The 1962 national
leader in E.R.A. in college baseball was St. John’s (NY) at 1.51.
Stanford is well on its way to do far better than that.
One measure of a team’s pitching effectvieness is its strikeout
walk ratio. In 257 innings. Stanford pitchers have struck out 253
and walked only 94. Moreover, Tribe hurlers have allowed only 171
hits in the entire 30 games of 1963, and only 62 runs, earned or
otherwise. Indians have recorded eight shutouts.

You know that Stanford’s 22-8 record is due mainly to the
pitchers’ efforts when you look at Stanford’s batting averages. They
drop quickly among the ten men who do most of the playing. Greg
Post leads at .344. with George Thacher trailing at .327. The dropoff
is rapid. Warren Newell hats a respectable .280, hut it goes to .255,
.250 (two players), .213, .200, .192, and .179.
In 11 CIBA games the Indians have managed only 32 runs, most
of which are unearned.
Attendance— 13!
As usual, Stanford students are staying away in droves from
baseball games played on Sunken Diamond. The only well-attended
game all year was the USC double-header, and the nadir of attend
ance was Tuesday’s St. Mary's game. A count of the house preceding
the game revealed 13 spectators watching the team that may become
the winningest in Stanford’s history.
A DISGUSTED STANFORD PLAYER summed up one day’s at
tendance as “four student cops studying and a public address an
nouncer telling the cops when to chase a foul ball.’’
The Indians have only two more home games. It might help
them a little if they could see someone in the stands besides student
policemen, the official scorer, mothers, wives, and frosh players
who finished their game early.
