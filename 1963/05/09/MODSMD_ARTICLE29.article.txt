# YWCA Sponsors North Tracy Camp

### JEAN KISVOLD 
(Editor's Note: Miss Kisvold
was among- 15 Stauford students
who s|MMit their spring vacation
work among the poor in North
Tracy, about (ill miles north of
here in the San Joaquin Valley.)

Fifteen students spent spring
vacation in the rain and mud of
a rural slum and concluded it
was a memorable experience.
Sponsored by the Stanford
YWCA and under the leadership
of Congregational minister, Dick
Roc, our work project was pre
pared for by community contacts,
Lisa Bowman and Maria Arel
i Inna.
During an active week we
painted houses, built fences, and
hauled mountains of trash. Inch
; gible for public garbage collec
tion, the inhabitants dump most
! garbage in a stagnant drainage
j ditch. Others litter their yards
with broken glass, rotting materi
al, rusty wire, etc.
We mingled with the children
at Saturday recreation, begun by
Lisa and Maria, attended the re
vivalist church, and staged a fi
nal party, at which we entertain
ed one another with songs and
dances a recitation of A. A. Mil
ne traded for a Mexican ballad
In addition, we tried to study
the conflicts and problems of
grower and laborer in one of the
world’s most abundant valleys,
where lack of cooperation, mis
trust. Inequity, and mechaniza
tion enhance endemic unemploy
ment, conflict between Interest
groups, desperation among work
ers, and an alienation of the far
mer from his land. We grilled
representatives of “agribusiness,”
ismall farming, government, un
i ions (making a bid for recogni
tion and a minimum wage), and
welfare groups.
Touring a corporation farm we
began to appreciate the farmer’s
need for large numbers of work
ers at peak seasons to harvest
the asparagus crop by “stoop la
bor”- and why he has thus im
ported Mexican nationals. Still,
we noted how the* forced accom
modation of botli bracero (im
ported Mexican worker) and do
mestic in an area of growing un
employment heightens the al
ready acute differences of grower
and laborer, both caught in a
I cost-price vise.
