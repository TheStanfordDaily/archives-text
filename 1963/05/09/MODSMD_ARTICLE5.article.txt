## 
### 
Henry Hill, Bay Area architect
i and visiting critic to Stanford’s
: Department of Architectui’e. will
| speak on “Coventry Cathedral:
| Ramifications of Architecture
I and Religious Expression” to
| night at 7:30 p.m. in room 320.
| The Stanford Chapter of the Stu
| dent AIA is sponsoring the talk.
Hill plans to discuss Basel
j Spence’s controversial new Cathe
dral in Coventry its design, arti
| facts, and impact by comparing
I it with some Gothic masterpieces
| and with Ronchamp by Le Cor
| busier. Hill feels that the religi
j ous artifacts have usurped Cov
i entry’s design goals, leaving a
j structure, which, as man’s first
attempt to design a cathedral in
| 300 years, is a failure.
Hill will also show some of his
own work, including the chapel
in Moline, lowa, which earned
him one of his American Institute
of Architects’ Honor Awards.
