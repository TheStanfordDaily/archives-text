brave Alabama and Mississippi |
Negroes fighting for elementary
rights? Urge he visit South im- |
mediately, speaking in public I
without ambiguity in support of
Negroes and calling upon local j
governments to cease police-dog
terrorism. Legal steps insuffici-1
ent. Press conference statements, |
even if forthcoming, not enough, i
Ho must take a stand, even if 1
supposedly a political disadvan
tage. He must intervene directly.
How can you, acknowledged liber
al spokesman, tolerate anything
less?‚Äù
