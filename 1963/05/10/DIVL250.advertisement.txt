Let’s see. It was last
weekend, and you
were dressing for that
very special date.
Suit? Presed and
ready. Shirt and tie?
Okay for the ball.
Shoes? Well, not so
okay, in spite of all
applied spit and
polish. Don’t let that
happen this weekend.
Better slip down to
R/A for a new pair of
Walkover dress kicks
—very good looking,
very comfortable in
black and/or brown.
July 19.00 the pr.
