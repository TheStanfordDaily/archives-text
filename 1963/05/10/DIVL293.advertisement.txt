Come to the
Stanford
bookstore
Monday,
May 13
at 11:00 a.m.
You may win
two weeks in Rio
all expenses paid!
Just come in and sign up. The
Schick Electric Shaver Shops want
to send you on an all-expenses
paid, two week vacation for two to
Rio de Janeiro via Braniff Airlines.
Why all the philanthropy? Well,
the man from the Schick Shaver
Shops will be on campus to give
your electric shaver (any model,
any make) a free tune-up. He’s
also giving a demonstration of the
new Schick electric shavers and
Petite Salon home hairdryer. And
he likes crowds! So he’s offering
you a once-in-a-lifetime summer
vacation just for dropping in. _
So come on in—and bring a date.
You may be on your way to Rio
sooner than you think!
