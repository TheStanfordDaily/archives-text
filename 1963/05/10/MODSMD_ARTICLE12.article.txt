# SU Protest Supports Negro Action
## 
### SHEILA RICKETTS 
“The real magic of Birmingham,” said Dr.
Charles Drekmeier, referring to a noon slogan,
“Birmingham; The Magic City,” which he saw in
that city, “is that for so many years, so many
people have endured so many injustices and so
many indignities.”
Drekmeier was one of four Stanford profes
sors who spoke at a protest meeting at 4:30 in
Tresidder yesterday afternoon. The meeting was
sponsored jointly by the Socilaist, Civil Liberties,
and Peace Caucuses, “to express support for the
Negro demonstrators in Birmingham,” in the
words of John Howard, the graduate student in
sociology who chaired the meeting.
THE MEETING was climaxed by the collection
of $728 to be split between (ho Student Non-Vio
lent Coordinating Committee and Dr. Martin Lu
ther King’s Southern Christian Leadership Con
ference and by the collection of 288 signatures on
a telegram to be sent to President John Kennedy,
urging him to action in the Alabama crisis, was
opened by a resume of events in Birmingham by
Howard.
“I have been so involved in following the
events in Birmingham,” ho said, “that I haven’t
been able to keep up with the other news. Per
haps someone can tell me, has President Kennedy
did. or been kidnapped, or what?’
“The new' Negro is the person who is fighting,”
said Dr. William McCord, who was the next speak
er. This is a change from the old Negro of the old
South “who has accepted with passivity and resig
nation the brutality the South, and sometimes the
North, has imposed on the Negro.”
THE NEGRO has undergone for the first time
a revolution in expectations, according to McCord.
“It is not that ho has new courage; he has new
hope. This new element of hope is the essential
thing.”
Dr. Richard Wasserstrom elaborated on some
legal steps that President Kennedy might take in
the situation. He began with the Federal Civil
Rights Act w'hich has been on the books since just
after the Civil War and which provides criminal
penalties for anyone who willfully deprives a
United States citizen of his rights or immunities.
HE ALSO MENTIONED another statute which

gives the President power to use armed forces to
suppress any unlawful combination or conspiracy
that hinders state or federal laws in such away
that people arc deprived of their rights.
But Wasserstrom stressed the fact that this is
a moral, not a legal question.
“I don’t think moderation is called for at all
here,” he said. “I don’t think compromise is an
issue. For a long time, rights to which the Negroes
have every right have been violated.”
SOUTHERNERS are being righteous, he con
cluded, because they used dogs instead of guns.
The fact is that they used dogs against human
beings.
“It is surprising that no one has been killed,”
said Drekmeier. “The water pressure being used
against these children is enough to take the bark
off a tree.
“They’re a little worried in Birmingham be
cause it costs 5400 more a day to keep the jails
going. One wonders what kind of care these child
ren are getting in the jails at that price.”
HE POINTED to a self-righteous editorial in
last Friday’s “New York Times which condemned
South Africa.
“Don’t let us be righteous about indignities suf
fered in Birmingham when any Negro student or
foreign student from Africa can tell you about in
dignities suffered here,”
Martin Lebowitz, chairman of the Civil Liber
ties Caucus, asked: “Monday morning how many
of us will be incensed about what is going on in
Birmingham? How many of you remember Green
wood, Mississippi?”
DR. IRVING HOWE challenged the idea that
the government can be an impersonal umpire
standing above the battle in the name of some ab
stract justice. This is simply, he said, to accept
the status quo and to acquiesce to the evil.
“If Pontius Pilate were alive today, he'd be
clucking over the condition of our Negro citizens
and urging them to be patient.” he said.
He urged students to act, reminding them that
a personal opinion telegram of less than 15 words
can be sent to the President for only 73 cents.
Students will be at Engineering Corner from
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. today to collect contributions and
signatures for the telegram to President Kennedy.

that people arc deprived of their rights.
But Wasserstrom stressed the fact that this is
a moral, not a legal question.
“I don’t think moderation is called for at all
here,” he said. “I don’t think compromise is an

have every right have been violated.”
SOUTHERNERS are being righteous, he con
cluded, because they used dogs instead of guns.
The fact is that they used dogs against human
beings.
“It is surprising that no one has been killed,”
said Drekmeier. “The water pressure being used
against these children is enough to take the bark

“They’re a little worried in Birmingham be

“Don’t let us be righteous about indignities suf

Martin Lebowitz, chairman of the Civil Liber

of us will be incensed about what is going on in
Birmingham? How many of you remember Green
wood, Mississippi?”
DR. IRVING HOWE challenged the idea that
the government can be an impersonal umpire
standing above the battle in the name of some ab
stract justice. This is simply, he said, to accept
the status quo and to acquiesce to the evil.
“If Pontius Pilate were alive today, he'd be
clucking over the condition of our Negro citizens
and urging them to be patient.” he said.
He urged students to act, reminding them that
a personal opinion telegram of less than 15 words
can be sent to the President for only 73 cents.
Students will be at Engineering Corner from
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. today to collect contributions and
signatures for the telegram to President Kennedy.
“The real magic of Birmingham,” said Dr.
Charles Drekmeier, referring to a noon slogan,
“Birmingham; The Magic City,” which he saw in
that city, “is that for so many years, so many
people have endured so many injustices and so
many indignities.”
Drekmeier was one of four Stanford profes
sors who spoke at a protest meeting at 4:30 in
Tresidder yesterday afternoon. The meeting was
sponsored jointly by the Socilaist, Civil Liberties,
and Peace Caucuses, “to express support for the
Negro demonstrators in Birmingham,” in the
words of John Howard, the graduate student in
sociology who chaired the meeting.
THE MEETING was climaxed by the collection
of $728 to be split between (ho Student Non-Vio
lent Coordinating Committee and Dr. Martin Lu
ther King’s Southern Christian Leadership Con
ference and by the collection of 288 signatures on
a telegram to be sent to President John Kennedy,
urging him to action in the Alabama crisis, was
opened by a resume of events in Birmingham by
Howard.
“I have been so involved in following the
events in Birmingham,” ho said, “that I haven’t
been able to keep up with the other news. Per
haps someone can tell me, has President Kennedy
did. or been kidnapped, or what?’
“The new' Negro is the person who is fighting,”
said Dr. William McCord, who was the next speak
er. This is a change from the old Negro of the old
South “who has accepted with passivity and resig
nation the brutality the South, and sometimes the
North, has imposed on the Negro.”
THE NEGRO has undergone for the first time
a revolution in expectations, according to McCord.
“It is not that ho has new courage; he has new
hope. This new element of hope is the essential
thing.”
Dr. Richard Wasserstrom elaborated on some
legal steps that President Kennedy might take in
the situation. He began with the Federal Civil
Rights Act w'hich has been on the books since just
after the Civil War and which provides criminal
penalties for anyone who willfully deprives a
United States citizen of his rights or immunities.
