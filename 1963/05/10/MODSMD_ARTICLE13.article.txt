Aden as ASSU vice-president marked the results of the ASSU

more, defeated his opponent, Mike Walsh, by a vote of 1414 to
933, with 30 write-in ballots. Miss Aden, a junior, defeated her

'opponent, Alice Ivey, by a vote
of 1238 to 758, with 20 write-in

Other officers elected included
Sydne Rogers, AVVS president;
Sandra Bergen, AVVS vice-presi
dent; Mary Ellen Nemeth. AVVS
recording secretary; and Wynn
Meagher, AWS corresponding
secretary.
SENIOR CLASS officers elect
ed were Kent Colberg, president;
and John Cone, vice-president.
Colberg defeated his opponent,
Gerry Wyant, by a vote of 271
to 205, with twelve write-ins.
Also elected were Susan Wil
liams, Women’s Recreation Asso
ciation President: Ann Johnson,
WRA vice-president; and Angela
Medbery, WRA secretary.
Wedin, giving his analysis of
the significance of the election
results, stated that “it is an indi
cation that people were concerned
on a campus-wide basis with in
creasing the student’s participa
tion in student affairs by show
ing support for the progressive
things that can be done next
year.” He further stressed that
he felt it was significant that he
was elected by the students as a
whole rather than through the
support of any particular type of
living group.
“(STUDENTS CAN now move
into new areas of policy decision
making by student-faculty com
mittees,” ho continued, “to in
crease student concern not only
in affair's of student government,
but also in other areas.” One of
his proposals to this end is a
mock political convention to be
held on campus next spring for
the purpose of increasing student
awareness of the political issues
dominating the 1961 elections.
In accordance with his belief
that “our job is not to run the
University smoothly, but to ques
tion and to probe,” Wedin has ad
vocated the continuation of the
student affairs committees cre
ated during the Rosencranz ad
ministration.
HE HAS PROPOSE!) an en
largement of their scope to in
clude probes into such areas as
curricular changes, particularly
concerning the language courses
offered to students returning
from foreign campuses. Also in
vestigated would be means for
making the graduate students a
more integral part of the student
body as a whole.
Wedin does not think, however,
“that we should make the mis
take of concentrating on things
outside of the university context
because the main area of our re
sponsibility lies within the uni
versity.”
He also wished to thank all of
his supporters, especially his
campaign manager, Sandy Mac
kenzie, for their help in the cam
paign.
Walsh, hearing the election re
sults, stated that he wished to
congratulate Wedin and his sup
porters for a winning campaign,
j and said, “having done my level
headed best, I accept defeat with
j a smile on my face and without
| breaking my stride.”
