# The 						CORE Solicitation
## 
### 
A collection for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)
by the Breakers Eating Club, after James Baldwin’s speech
Wednesday, was stopped by members of the student police
under orders from Fred Nelson, the Student Financial Man
ager.
Members of the eating club responded to Mr. Nelson’s
actions with a great deal of indignation, stating that it
“wasn’t a question of legality but one of right.”
There can be little doubt that the cause furthered by the
Breakers members and by CORE is a good one. Certainly,
as James Baldwin pointed out in his speech, there is a need
for help, and the time was opportune for a collection.
Mr. Nelson, however, was merely applying an ASSU By
law which stated that “no public drive to solicit funds from
members of the Association, for charitable or any other pur
poses, shall be held without approval in advance from Legis
lature.”
The nde should be blamed, not Mr. Nelson, who was
simply carrying out his job. If the rule is a cumbersome one
—as it is—the Legislature should act to change it, but to
blame Mr. Nelson for fulfilling his responsibility is ridiculous.
