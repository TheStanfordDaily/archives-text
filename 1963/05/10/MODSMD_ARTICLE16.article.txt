To The Board of Trustees:
We have read of your decision not to accept restricted gifts
from the “Winds of Freedom” Foundation and would like to
express our strong support of your stand. We are, also, con
cerned about the problem of avoiding partisan pressures and
we think it is important for us to let you know that you have the
gratitude and approval of many Stanford students for continu
ing to evaluate financial support in the broader terms of main
taining the University’s power of deciding how this and other
money shall be used.

Editors, The Daily:
I am more puzzled by The Daily’s interpretation of the
Trustees’ action in refusing to accept grants which were to be
“jointly administered by the Board of Trustees and the Board
of Directors of the Winds of Freedom Foundation” for words
to that effect] than I was by the Trustees’ decision. Taking their
statement at face value (and we have no reason for not doing
so) the Trustees had serious doubts about the legality of accept
ing funds for the University which would be put to uses pre
scribed thereafter by the Board and an independent body. Argua
bly, by allowing joint administration of funds which would be
come Stanford’s property at the moment of their acceptance
they might have been delegating duties of administration which
are legally non-delegable. The law is by no means clear on the
point, but such an interpretation is altogether reasonable.
However, it is a very different thing to say, as The Daily
did, that the University is refusing to accept funds because their
use is restricted. The moment that this University (or ony other
for that matter) refuses to accept funds solely because they
carry restrictions—whether imposed by an individual, a founda
tion, or the federal government- it may be out of business.
Restricted contributions (as opposed to jointly administered
ones) are fairly commonplace.
The Daily further suggested that acceptance of restricted
gifts would somehow curtail “academic freedom” (before which
every knee should bend and every head should bow). Of course,
no one would suggest that the University should accept funds
carrying as a condition that professor “A” should be sacked or
that professor “B” should be silenced. However, that is very
different from saying that the University should not accept an
endowed chair for one faculty member or be helped financially
in acquiring some other distinguished scholar (no one is sug
gesting that our University should take on mere propagandists)
because a donor or group of donors likes his teachings. Again
(as demonstrated by the fact that Yale has a Eugene Meyer
Professorship of Political Science because the late publisher of
the Washington Post appreciated a given scholar’s work) that
is not unusual.

tion, or the federal government- it may be out of business.
Restricted contributions (as opposed to jointly administered
ones) are fairly commonplace.
The Daily further suggested that acceptance of restricted
gifts would somehow curtail “academic freedom” (before which
every knee should bend and every head should bow). Of course,
no one would suggest that the University should accept funds
carrying as a condition that professor “A” should be sacked or
that professor “B” should be silenced. However, that is very
different from saying that the University should not accept an
endowed chair for one faculty member or be helped financially
in acquiring some other distinguished scholar (no one is sug
gesting that our University should take on mere propagandists)
because a donor or group of donors likes his teachings. Again
(as demonstrated by the fact that Yale has a Eugene Meyer
Professorship of Political Science because the late publisher of
the Washington Post appreciated a given scholar’s work) that
is not unusual.

To The Board of Trustees:
We have read of your decision not to accept restricted gifts
from the “Winds of Freedom” Foundation and would like to
express our strong support of your stand. We are, also, con
cerned about the problem of avoiding partisan pressures and
we think it is important for us to let you know that you have the
gratitude and approval of many Stanford students for continu
ing to evaluate financial support in the broader terms of main
taining the University’s power of deciding how this and other
money shall be used.

Editors, The Daily:
I am more puzzled by The Daily’s interpretation of the
Trustees’ action in refusing to accept grants which were to be
“jointly administered by the Board of Trustees and the Board
of Directors of the Winds of Freedom Foundation” for words
to that effect] than I was by the Trustees’ decision. Taking their
statement at face value (and we have no reason for not doing
so) the Trustees had serious doubts about the legality of accept
ing funds for the University which would be put to uses pre
scribed thereafter by the Board and an independent body. Argua
bly, by allowing joint administration of funds which would be
come Stanford’s property at the moment of their acceptance
they might have been delegating duties of administration which
are legally non-delegable. The law is by no means clear on the
point, but such an interpretation is altogether reasonable.
However, it is a very different thing to say, as The Daily
did, that the University is refusing to accept funds because their
use is restricted. The moment that this University (or ony other
for that matter) refuses to accept funds solely because they
carry restrictions—whether imposed by an individual, a founda
tion, or the federal government- it may be out of business.
