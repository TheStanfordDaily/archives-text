Editors, The Daily:
On May 7, 1963, the “Faculty-Staff Newsletter,” a publica
tion circulated generally to Stanford employees, contained an
item entitled “The Power Line Question.” This half page state
ment made reference to the controversy over a high tension
power line which P.G.&E. proposes to construct on high towers
in the foothills near the Skyline, and which would cross a por
tion of Palo Alto. In the municipal election to be held on May
14th the citizens of Palo Alto will vote upon the question of
whether to approve the zoning action of the City Council which
would permit P.G.&E. to put the project through Palo Alto’s
foothills. The “news item,” which was prepared by the Univer
sity Relations department and inserted in the Newsletter at
its instance, points out that the proposed line will serve the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. It concludes with the state
ment of a SLAC official that a “yes” vote “is clearly in Stan
ford’s interest.”
As members of the Stanford faculty, not all of whom are
actively opposed to the construction of the proposed power line,
the undersigned strenuously protest the manner in which the
University Administration has attempted to influence the vote
of Stanford employees in an election to be held in a neighboring
community. This action of the Administration, in our opinion,
is unconscionable and indefensible.
The issuance of the statement in the name of Stanford is
another example of the Administration’s taking a position or
action on a matter and labeling it as a Stanford position or ac
tion. As far as we are concerned, in regard to controversial
questions as to which there are substantial arguments on both
sides, the views of the faculty (and even those of the students?),
as well as those of the Administration, should determine the
Stanford position. What is in “Stanford’s interest” is not a mat
ter for decision by the Administration acting without regard to
the faculty view, or even by an official of the Linear Acceler
ator project. No attempt was made to ascertain faculty senti
ment on this power line question (or, indeed, on the very im
portant question of whether the Accelerator should be brought
to Stanford in the first place).
Even if it be conceded that the Administration view is the
Stanford view, a point we find difficult to concede even for the
purpose of argument, it is totally inconsistent with the char
acter of a University, no matter what “Stanford’s interest,” to
attempt to influence the outcome of a controversial question,
upon which a vote is about to be taken, without presenting both
sides of that question. The statement, in the Newsletter lists
some of the “critical factors” which purport to demonstrate
the soundness of an affirmative vote on the power line question.
No mention is made of the substantial arguments on the other
side— arguments which influenced more than 1300 Palo Alto resi
dents to sign the referendum petition which led to the placing of
the zoning proposition on the ballot. Wholly apart from the ques
tionable practice of the University’s attempting to influence the
outcome of a local election, this action of the Administration
presents the more serious ethical question of the failure of a
great (fairminded?) University to present both sides of a con
troversial question on which it has chosen to take a position.
When one of the undersigned raised this question with the Uni
versity Relations department and suggested the circulation of a
supplement to the Newsletter presenting the other side of the
question, he was told that the University could not be expected
to make and pay for an argument contrary to its own position.
Granting, again for the sake of argument only, that the
Administration has the right to take a position on this question
and to advocate its side only, one would at least expect that the
reasons for the position would be entirely clear and free from
inaccuracy, ambiguity and implied threats. And yet the state
ment in the Newsletter is not even immune from criticism on
these grounds. Among other things, it is stated that a “no”
vote on the zoning proposition would involve delay, and the cost
of delay to the Acceleration project “would soon approximate
$20,000 a day.” There is no elaboration of the basis for com
puting this cost, nor is there any indication of who would bear
it. Some persons might read this cryptic statement to mean
that the cost will be charged to funds that might otherwise have
been dedicated to such things as salary increases.
Since we were unable to convince University Relations to
publicize the other side of this power line question, we have
chosen The Daily as a vehicle to reach the Palo Alto voters who
read the “company” statement in the Newsletter. We urge them
to study the arguments in opposition to the zoning proposition
which have been made by the Committee for Green Foothills
in advertisements in the Palo Alto Times. We hope that this
letter will serve to put the issue in better perspective than that
in which the Administration has attempted to place it.

I think the dissatisfaction expressed concerning the Joffre
Debate in Mr. Stoleru’s letter could have been largely avoided
if he had been forewarned about the probable course of the
debate. It is fair to say that the Cal debate team is roughly
comparable to their hapless football and. tearqs, and if
Mr. Stoleru had approached the .'debate, as I did, as a contest
almost exclusively between the; opposing Stanford .speakers,
much of the confusion would have been avoided.
Although it is true that Miss Brown was sometimes given
to glib overstatements, it is also true that her affirmative as
sertions served as a sound basis for constructive arguments on
the proposition. Miss Brown asserted that the independent
French nuclear force (1) would add impetus to the prolifera
tion of nuclear weapons and therefore to the danger of acci
dental war; (2) would strengthen the position of the Chinese
in their bargaining for Russian nuclear weapons; and (3) would,
by creating a rival powor center, pull the Atlantic Alliance apart.
Mr. Hall replied by maintaining that Europe’s defense
needs differed significantly from ours, and that France had no
guarantee that we would invite the destruction of our country
to avenge the destruction of Paris or Bonn. After developing
this argument, he turned to a penetrating analysis of the im
plicit causal links in Miss Brown’s assertions.
Mr. Bischoff, the winner, continued the negative attack in
an original way. He argued that the French nuclear force, rather
than weakening the Alliance, would revive it. “Only a viable
partnership of co-operating powers,” Bischoff asserted, can be
effective. NATO at present is dominated by American and
NATO’s policies are dictated by American national interests to
the relative exclusion of other powers, and the creation of a
French nuclear force will make the Atlantic Alliance stronger.
When the debate was considered without the annoying and
confusing speeches of the Cal debaters, it was a very clear and
very intelligent discussion of the issues involved. It is regret
table that Mr. Stoleru permitted the incompetence of the Cal
debaters, Miss Brown’s enthusiastic—and hurried—speaking
style, and Mr. Hall’s dry Texas w r it to come between him and the
enjoyment of a fine debate.

As Executive Secretary of the Institute of International
Relations, I would like to make a few comments regarding the
supposed “dispute” concerning the HR Constitution.
1) The Constitution was first presented for discussion at
an Executive Board meeting, February 4, with dittoed outlines,
as well as a definitive structural chart, available for public
perusal.
2) The Bth and final draft of the Constitution, as now be
fore LASSU, was available for comments and criticisms as early
as April 18th, three full weeks ago. This, contrary to the in
formation in last Tuesday's Daily, was more than available for
public consumption, as there were 150 copies dittoed in the Loft.
This ought to have allowed plenty of time for discussion and
relevant criticism. The Executive Board meeting on April 22nd
was the ninth meeting for discussion of the Constitution.
I am not in any way categorically opposed to the revisions
being suggested by the group that has met in the last week;
however, I feel that they are delinquent in waiting this long to
bring up their comments, and in presenting facts that are not
accurate.
