# 31 Cards to Compete In Fresno Relays
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
I leads 31 of his varsity and fresh
man trackmen to Fresno tomor
) row for a West Coast Relays of
copious potential records. Jordan
j claims that this contingent is
| Stanford’s strongest entry ever
t in the Fresno meet. It includes
eight university record holders
i and several of the best college
! track and field men in the conn
i try this year.
As usual, the outstanding In
i dian performer (who is a little
! more outstanding this week than
[heretofore) is NCAA discus rec
ord holder Dave Weill. He set the
i collegiate mark last season at
[ in Oregon. Six weeks ago,
: he ostensibly improved it at
j Westwood to 194-6, but this toss
* was disqualified due to a slope
1 on UCLA’s field. But last week
! end, he threw 193-2 against Cal
on a legitimate field.
HARRY McCALLA, Stanford’s
j fastest two-miler ever (8:52.7)
j and the second fastest miler in
j the U.S. in 1963 (4:01.0) will run
j an 880-leg in the two-mile relay

i and anchor the distance medley
| relay team. This latter quartet,
McCalla, Boh Miltz, Bill Pratt,
| and Harlan Andrews, set a new
Drake Relays record two weeks
ago at 9:54.6.
I Other school varsity record
holders entered are Steve Cort
| right (triple jump and intermedi
ate hurdles), who will compete in
[both hurdle races and the triple
jump; Dan Moore (broad jump);
[and Phil White (pole vault). Lar
|ry Questad, whose 9.5 100-yard
dash is the second fastest in Stan
! ford history, will run in the 100,
j 220 and 440 relay.
THE LIMELIGHT will also be
| turned on some outstanding In-
I dian freshmen tomorrow. Dave
| Duebner, Stanford three-mile rec
ord holder (13:57.7), will run in
the 5000-meter race. George Por
ter, the best javelin thrower cur-
I rently in Stanford, with a mark
! of 210-9 will throw tomorrow; but
I he will be pushed by Bob Stoeck
j er ( 208-81, who is most renowned
' for his feats in the discus. He
j holds the school freshman rec
ord, at 166-11 Ms. Another excel
| lent frosh is jumper John Goode,
i His 47-6 la triple jump is a fresh
| man record and his 23-10'l> broad
jump is the second best by any
[ Indian this year.
IF STANFORD’S entry is un
usually strong, so is the entire
[ field at the West Coast Relays.
Five individuals have won gold
medals at the recent Pan Ameri
i can Games. They are Ralph Bos
i ton (broad jump), Blaine Lind-
I gren (high hurdles), Bob Hum
j phreys (discus), Jeff Fishback
(steeplechase), and Gene John
son (high jump).
In addition, C. K. Yang, Na
j tionalist China’s decathlon record
j holder, will compete for his
j American alma mater, UCLA. He
i has already topped 16 feet in the
polo vault this year, and will be
ishooting for John Fennel’s 16-6 :! 4
| world record.
FINALLY, Arizona State’s
j mile relay team will he close to
a world mark. The quartet of
.Mike Barrick, Henry Carr, Ron
j Freeman, and Ulis Williams, has
[already run times of 3:05.9.
[3:06.3, 3:07.2, and 3:04.5 in 1963.
The latter is a pending world
record.

HARRY McCALLA, Stanford’s

the 5000-meter race. George Por
