UCLA will counter with the
two mainstays of its staff, Tom
Bottoms and Larry Zeno.
Greg Post leads Stanford hit
ters with a .343 season’s mark,
followed by George Thacher’s
.324 average. Gary Smith is set
ting the RBI pace with 22, while
Bob Hollmann leads in home runs
with three.

This weekend's series with
UCLA ean only he deseribed at
crucial. Stanford’s baseball team,
fighting for its life to grasp the
CIBA league title, faces the
UCLA Bruins Friday and Satur
day at Los Angeles. The outcome
will be important, as will every
game played from here on in, in
deciding the winner of the league
title.
The CIBA race is so close at
this point that it resembles four
fat men trying to shove through
the same bus door at the same
time. In this case, the bus is
bound for the NCAA playoffs,
and the four contenders are USC,
which has the best shot with a
seven and five record; UCLA,
tied for top money with an eight
and six marks; Stanford, at six
and five and one half a game out;
and Santa Clara, which is also
one half a game out with its sev
en and six ledger. The only team
not in the act is lowly California,
which is eliminated at three wins
and nine defeats.
In their first two meetings of
the year, Stanford dazzled Bruin
hitters with their great pitching
punch of Darrell Sutherland and
Jim Lonborg. The Indians won
both games, posting 3-1 and 3-0

victories.
This weekend the Tribe will
again go with the best it has.
Lonborg, W'ho leads the team in
wins (seven for the season), in
nings pitched (90 2 a), strike outs
(94), and complete games (sev
en), will put his 1.39 earned run
average on the line in one game.
Sutherland, who has struck out
10.8 men per nine innings of work
this season, takes his fantastic
1.11 earned run average into the
other contest. Sutherland is four
and three on the season, but all
three of his losses were by one
run margins.
