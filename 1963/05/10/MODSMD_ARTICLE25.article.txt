# Golfers Seek to Upset San Jose
## 
### 
Today the Stanford golf team
has a chance to avenge their only
loss in their last 35 dual matches.
San Jose State nipped the Cards
by three strokes in their last en
counter on the Spartan course.
That match was decided on the
last green as three Indians each
gave up a single stroke to his op
ponent on the 18th. On their
home course, the Tribe will at
least even the odds, and perhaps
hold a slight advantage. Since the
disappointment at San Jose, Stan
ford has won two matches,
trouncing UCLA 21 L- to 5 1 - and
edging the Alumni 15 to 12.
The California Bears will fol
low up on Saturday afternoon
when they attempt, for the sec
ond time this year, to beat the
Tribe. Jim Rhelm led Stanford to
a 17-10 win three weeks ago.
