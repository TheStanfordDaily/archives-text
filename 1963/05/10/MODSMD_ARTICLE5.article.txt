### JANE SOKOLOW 
Lindsey Kalal, Manager of Inter-Club Council, explained to
LASSU last night the steps taken in scheduling Vaughan Meader’s
appearance this Sunday for a benefit performance to raise money
for “Meals for Millions.”
Kalal said that last Friday Agnes Nohniberg, Director of the

Committee of Public Exercises,-
told him that the ASSU must ap
prove the scheduling of the pro
gram. However, Fred Nelson, Stu
dent Financial Manager, said
that, on the contrary, the issue
was completely in the hands of
Priscilla Ferguson, Vice-Presi
dent of ASSU.
RESPONDING to Nelson’s
statement, Miss Ferguson said
that she would approve the pro
gram if there were no conflicts
with the administration officials.
Over the weekend the Music De
partment, the Public Exercises
Department, and others involved
were consulted and concurred
with the proposal to plan the
show for this Sunday.
On Monday Miss Ferguson was
prepared to sign the official
forms, late the next day, how
ever, the situation had changed.
Nelson reversed (lie statement he
had made Friday by stating that
according to LASSU By-Laws,
Miss Ferguson did not have the
jurisdiction to authorize the char
ity program. Unless LASSU ap
proved it. Nelson said, the pro
gram would have to be called off.
Tuesday night. Dean Winbigler
verified Nelson’s objection. The
ICC was compelled to hall the
publicity campaign and ticket
sale which had been started in
San Francisco and on campus,
according to Kalal.
AT THE LASSU meeting last
night, after Kalal explained the
issue, it was put to a vote and
approved. However, according to
Kalal “the ICC is faced with the
difficulty of selling 2500 tickets
in one day for a campus-wide ac
tivity. as a result of inconsisten
cies and limitations in the current
ASSU organization.”
The show will take place at the
Stanford Pavilion Sunday at 3:30,
under the auspices of the Inter-
Club Council. The proceeds will
go to the developing California-
Chile program, which was initiat
ed by Dr. Fulton of the Stanford
Research Institute.
The program will present a
variety of entertainment: Mea
der, the comedian whose album,
“The First Family,” has received
the largest number of sales of
any record in the U.S.; the Pun
jabi Folk Dance Troupe, the of
ficial dancers for the State of
Punjabi in India; and the “Folk
sters.” a folk-singing quartet
from Miami Basin, who are cur
rently appealing at the hungry i
with Mcader.
The four Folksters are Ken
Hodges (bass fiddlei, Fred Wil
liams and Gary Scott (guitar),
and Paul Champion (five-string
banjo). Mercury has just re
leased a new album for this group
entitled "New in Folk.”

was completely in the hands of
Priscilla Ferguson, Vice-Presi
dent of ASSU.
RESPONDING to Nelson’s
statement, Miss Ferguson said
that she would approve the pro
gram if there were no conflicts
with the administration officials.
Over the weekend the Music De
partment, the Public Exercises
Department, and others involved
were consulted and concurred
with the proposal to plan the
show for this Sunday.
On Monday Miss Ferguson was
prepared to sign the official
forms, late the next day, how
ever, the situation had changed.
Nelson reversed (lie statement he
had made Friday by stating that
according to LASSU By-Laws,
Miss Ferguson did not have the
jurisdiction to authorize the char
ity program. Unless LASSU ap
proved it. Nelson said, the pro
gram would have to be called off.
Tuesday night. Dean Winbigler
verified Nelson’s objection. The
ICC was compelled to hall the
publicity campaign and ticket
sale which had been started in
San Francisco and on campus,
according to Kalal.
AT THE LASSU meeting last
night, after Kalal explained the
issue, it was put to a vote and
approved. However, according to
Kalal “the ICC is faced with the
difficulty of selling 2500 tickets
in one day for a campus-wide ac
tivity. as a result of inconsisten
cies and limitations in the current
ASSU organization.”
The show will take place at the
Stanford Pavilion Sunday at 3:30,

jabi Folk Dance Troupe, the of
ficial dancers for the State of
Punjabi in India; and the “Folk

Kalal said that last Friday Agnes Nohniberg, Director of the

Committee of Public Exercises,-
