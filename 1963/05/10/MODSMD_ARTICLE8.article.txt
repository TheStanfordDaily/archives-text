# SAYR's Vote Against Kuchel
## 
### 
Senator Thomas Kuchel was
censured yesterday by the Stan
ford Area Young Republican Ex
ecutive Board for his Senate
speech attacking conservative ele
ments in both the Republican
and Democratic parties.
Kuchel implied that general
conservative thought in both par
ties was closely aligned with the
writings of such “irresponsible
persons as Gerald L. K. Smith.
He further referred to mail from
critical conservative constituents
as “right-wing slime.”
A resolution passed by the
SAYR called the Senator’s re
marks “irresponsible, shrill, and
trite.”
It further noted that Kuchel’s
speech was “unnecessary”; “be
neath the dignity expected of a
United States Senator”; and “will
but increase dissention within
the Republican party.”
The resolution was approved
by the SAYR Executive Board by
a vote of 10 to 3.
