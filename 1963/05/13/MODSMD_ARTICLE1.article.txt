# Two SU Professors Analyze 'Self-Imposed Exile' As Applied to Cuban Refugees
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Associate Editor 
Two Stanford professors have made the
200.000 Cuban refugees in itie United States
the subject of an intensive research project
on the phenomenon of “self-exposed exile."
Richard Brody, assistant professor of
political science, and Richard R. Fagen, as
sistant professor in political science and
communications, are in the process of ana
lyzing stacks of Spanish questionnaires filled
out during Spring vacation at the Miami
Refugee Center by Cuban citizens who have
fled from the Castro regime.
FAGEN COMMENTS that the study is
exploring “the social psychology of self-im
posed exile why the refugees left. What
has to be touched in their life space? How
did the regime have to ‘hurt’ these people to
make them take this big step of packing up
and leaving?”
The study that finally led the research
team to Miami grew out of Fagen’s interest
in rabid political change in general, and the
Cuban revolution in particular.
The self-administered questionnaire was
completed by 210 heads of households w'ho
represent a cross-section of the refugee com-

munity.
While analysis is just beginning to reach
a point from which one can generalize, Fa
gen was able to answer some questions on
the basis of indications their material has
given to date.
ONE QUESTION asked simply: “Please
tell us in detail why you finally decided to
leave. Was there some particular incident
which was central to your decision to leave?”
Of the response to this question, Fagen
states, "As a rule most people did not an
swer in large, generalized terms, but in
terms of little, specific things. They did not
say, ‘I left because I hated Communism,’ but
‘1 decided to leave when one day my children
came home from school spouting Marxism-
Leninism.’ They speak of a specific occur
ence at work, something that happened in
a union.
“Most people are not very ideological; they
become so only when it touches their individ
ual lives very directly."
Considering the nature of the refugees
current existence, Fagen noted “how unpo
litical, calm, ordinary most of them are.
Their concerns revolve around educating
their children, adjusting to the language and

customs of their new environment, getting
a living—in general, involvement in the im
mediate and present concerns of life.
“A VERY LARGE segment of the com
munity is not political in any regular sense.
They just want to be left alone to provide
for their families, and they were not politi
cally active in Cuba either. But the regime
is so all-pervasive it touches everyone in
every way.”

Other major attributed causes for finally
leaving were imprisonment or detainment in
some form, and the disillusionment caused
by the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Fagen feels that
most of the refugees are in a "post Bay of
Pigs depression.”
One-fifth of the “sample” refugees admit
ted even at this point that when Castro took
over in 1959, they thought he was “the sa
vior of Cuba.” Fagen adds that this probably
underestimates the number who had this
feeling as this is a ‘tremendously difficult
response to give under the circumstances.”

The researcher notes that there is a "con
tinuous theme of betrayal.” While these
people are now' anti-Castro, their response
as to their initial reactions to him indicate
that they were far from pro-Batista.

SEVENTY-FIVE PER CENT of the Cu
bans indicated that they thought at least 70
per cent of their countrymen would support
a movement to overthrow the Castro gov
ernment. Of this Fagen says, "I personally
can’t accept this; it flies in the face of every
thing we understand. Nations just aren’t
this highly politicized.”
The refugees have been coming since
Castro’s initial coup in January 1959 through
to the present. The peak time was from 1961
to October 1962. Until October 1962, the
“exiles” arrived mainly byway of commer
cial airlines. These refugees left “through
channels,” having permission to leave from
the Cuban government.
Since the 1962 crisis, one can leave only
secretively. Fagen guesses that those that
have left since that time account for only
2-3 per cent of the refugee community.

A DISPROPORTIONATE number of the
refugees come from the upper professional
classes, although the research data will in
dicate whether this changed over time.
The researchers have completed demo
graphic information on the whole refugee
class, not just those interviewed. In addition
to the cross-section the Stanford team inter

viewed two smaller groups. One group were
pilots, all of whom had at one time partici
pated in the regime and had been pro-Castro
activists. The second was the members of
the “MUR,” a group which Fagen describes
as “one of the more moderate politically
active exile groups.”
Fagen expects analysis to be completed
by the end of this summer, but writing it
up could add another year before it reaches
publication. He noted, “if there is as much
in the various aspects of this as we feel now
that there is, we will publish a monograph
rather than just an article.”
THE RESEARCH project is in no way
sponsored or supported by the United States
Government. Its only connection with a gov
ernment agency was the cooperation in
gathering demographic data they received
from the Cuban Refugee Center in Miami,
which is under the department of Health,
Education, and Welfare.

Brody and Fagen were assisted in their
spring interviewing session by Frank Maigu
ashca, PhD. candidate in political science.
The data is being analyzed directly from the
Spanish by Sally Macßean, Masters degree
candidate in Hispanic-American studies.

“exiles” arrived mainly byway of commer
cial airlines. These refugees left “through
channels,” having permission to leave from
the Cuban government.
Since the 1962 crisis, one can leave only
secretively. Fagen guesses that those that
have left since that time account for only
2-3 per cent of the refugee community.

A DISPROPORTIONATE number of the
refugees come from the upper professional
classes, although the research data will in
dicate whether this changed over time.
The researchers have completed demo
graphic information on the whole refugee
class, not just those interviewed. In addition
to the cross-section the Stanford team inter

viewed two smaller groups. One group were
pilots, all of whom had at one time partici
pated in the regime and had been pro-Castro
activists. The second was the members of
the “MUR,” a group which Fagen describes
as “one of the more moderate politically
active exile groups.”
Fagen expects analysis to be completed
by the end of this summer, but writing it
up could add another year before it reaches
publication. He noted, “if there is as much
in the various aspects of this as we feel now
that there is, we will publish a monograph
rather than just an article.”
THE RESEARCH project is in no way
sponsored or supported by the United States
Government. Its only connection with a gov
ernment agency was the cooperation in
gathering demographic data they received
from the Cuban Refugee Center in Miami,
which is under the department of Health,
Education, and Welfare.

Brody and Fagen were assisted in their
spring interviewing session by Frank Maigu
ashca, PhD. candidate in political science.
The data is being analyzed directly from the
Spanish by Sally Macßean, Masters degree
candidate in Hispanic-American studies.
Two Stanford professors have made the
200.000 Cuban refugees in itie United States
the subject of an intensive research project
on the phenomenon of “self-exposed exile."
Richard Brody, assistant professor of
political science, and Richard R. Fagen, as
sistant professor in political science and
communications, are in the process of ana
lyzing stacks of Spanish questionnaires filled
out during Spring vacation at the Miami
Refugee Center by Cuban citizens who have
fled from the Castro regime.
FAGEN COMMENTS that the study is
exploring “the social psychology of self-im
posed exile why the refugees left. What
has to be touched in their life space? How
did the regime have to ‘hurt’ these people to
make them take this big step of packing up
and leaving?”
The study that finally led the research
team to Miami grew out of Fagen’s interest
in rabid political change in general, and the
Cuban revolution in particular.
The self-administered questionnaire was
completed by 210 heads of households w'ho
represent a cross-section of the refugee com-

munity.
While analysis is just beginning to reach
a point from which one can generalize, Fa
gen was able to answer some questions on
the basis of indications their material has
given to date.
ONE QUESTION asked simply: “Please
tell us in detail why you finally decided to
leave. Was there some particular incident
which was central to your decision to leave?”
Of the response to this question, Fagen
states, "As a rule most people did not an
swer in large, generalized terms, but in
terms of little, specific things. They did not
say, ‘I left because I hated Communism,’ but
‘1 decided to leave when one day my children
came home from school spouting Marxism-
Leninism.’ They speak of a specific occur
ence at work, something that happened in
a union.
“Most people are not very ideological; they
become so only when it touches their individ
ual lives very directly."
Considering the nature of the refugees
current existence, Fagen noted “how unpo
litical, calm, ordinary most of them are.
Their concerns revolve around educating
their children, adjusting to the language and

customs of their new environment, getting
a living—in general, involvement in the im
mediate and present concerns of life.
“A VERY LARGE segment of the com
munity is not political in any regular sense.
They just want to be left alone to provide
for their families, and they were not politi
cally active in Cuba either. But the regime
is so all-pervasive it touches everyone in
every way.”

Other major attributed causes for finally
leaving were imprisonment or detainment in
some form, and the disillusionment caused
by the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Fagen feels that
most of the refugees are in a "post Bay of
Pigs depression.”
One-fifth of the “sample” refugees admit
ted even at this point that when Castro took
over in 1959, they thought he was “the sa
vior of Cuba.” Fagen adds that this probably
underestimates the number who had this
feeling as this is a ‘tremendously difficult
response to give under the circumstances.”

The researcher notes that there is a "con
tinuous theme of betrayal.” While these
people are now' anti-Castro, their response
as to their initial reactions to him indicate
that they were far from pro-Batista.

SEVENTY-FIVE PER CENT of the Cu
bans indicated that they thought at least 70
per cent of their countrymen would support
a movement to overthrow the Castro gov
ernment. Of this Fagen says, "I personally
can’t accept this; it flies in the face of every
thing we understand. Nations just aren’t
this highly politicized.”

customs of their new environment, getting
a living—in general, involvement in the im
mediate and present concerns of life.
“A VERY LARGE segment of the com
munity is not political in any regular sense.
They just want to be left alone to provide
for their families, and they were not politi
cally active in Cuba either. But the regime
is so all-pervasive it touches everyone in
every way.”

Other major attributed causes for finally
leaving were imprisonment or detainment in
some form, and the disillusionment caused
by the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Fagen feels that
most of the refugees are in a "post Bay of
Pigs depression.”
One-fifth of the “sample” refugees admit
ted even at this point that when Castro took
over in 1959, they thought he was “the sa
vior of Cuba.” Fagen adds that this probably
underestimates the number who had this
feeling as this is a ‘tremendously difficult
response to give under the circumstances.”

The researcher notes that there is a "con
tinuous theme of betrayal.” While these
people are now' anti-Castro, their response
as to their initial reactions to him indicate
that they were far from pro-Batista.

SEVENTY-FIVE PER CENT of the Cu
bans indicated that they thought at least 70
per cent of their countrymen would support
a movement to overthrow the Castro gov
ernment. Of this Fagen says, "I personally
can’t accept this; it flies in the face of every
thing we understand. Nations just aren’t
this highly politicized.”
The refugees have been coming since
Castro’s initial coup in January 1959 through
to the present. The peak time was from 1961
to October 1962. Until October 1962, the
“exiles” arrived mainly byway of commer
cial airlines. These refugees left “through
channels,” having permission to leave from
the Cuban government.
Since the 1962 crisis, one can leave only
secretively. Fagen guesses that those that
have left since that time account for only
2-3 per cent of the refugee community.

A DISPROPORTIONATE number of the
refugees come from the upper professional
classes, although the research data will in
dicate whether this changed over time.
The researchers have completed demo
graphic information on the whole refugee
class, not just those interviewed. In addition
to the cross-section the Stanford team inter

viewed two smaller groups. One group were
pilots, all of whom had at one time partici
pated in the regime and had been pro-Castro
activists. The second was the members of
the “MUR,” a group which Fagen describes
as “one of the more moderate politically
active exile groups.”
Fagen expects analysis to be completed
by the end of this summer, but writing it
up could add another year before it reaches
publication. He noted, “if there is as much
in the various aspects of this as we feel now
that there is, we will publish a monograph
rather than just an article.”
THE RESEARCH project is in no way
sponsored or supported by the United States
Government. Its only connection with a gov
ernment agency was the cooperation in
gathering demographic data they received
from the Cuban Refugee Center in Miami,
which is under the department of Health,
Education, and Welfare.

Brody and Fagen were assisted in their
spring interviewing session by Frank Maigu
ashca, PhD. candidate in political science.
The data is being analyzed directly from the
Spanish by Sally Macßean, Masters degree
candidate in Hispanic-American studies.
Two Stanford professors have made the
200.000 Cuban refugees in itie United States
the subject of an intensive research project
on the phenomenon of “self-exposed exile."
Richard Brody, assistant professor of
political science, and Richard R. Fagen, as
sistant professor in political science and
communications, are in the process of ana
lyzing stacks of Spanish questionnaires filled
out during Spring vacation at the Miami
Refugee Center by Cuban citizens who have
fled from the Castro regime.
FAGEN COMMENTS that the study is
exploring “the social psychology of self-im
posed exile why the refugees left. What
has to be touched in their life space? How
did the regime have to ‘hurt’ these people to
make them take this big step of packing up
and leaving?”
The study that finally led the research
team to Miami grew out of Fagen’s interest
in rabid political change in general, and the
Cuban revolution in particular.
The self-administered questionnaire was
completed by 210 heads of households w'ho
represent a cross-section of the refugee com-

munity.
While analysis is just beginning to reach
a point from which one can generalize, Fa
gen was able to answer some questions on
the basis of indications their material has
given to date.
ONE QUESTION asked simply: “Please
tell us in detail why you finally decided to
leave. Was there some particular incident
which was central to your decision to leave?”
Of the response to this question, Fagen
states, "As a rule most people did not an
swer in large, generalized terms, but in
terms of little, specific things. They did not
say, ‘I left because I hated Communism,’ but
‘1 decided to leave when one day my children
came home from school spouting Marxism-
Leninism.’ They speak of a specific occur
ence at work, something that happened in
a union.
“Most people are not very ideological; they
become so only when it touches their individ
ual lives very directly."
Considering the nature of the refugees
current existence, Fagen noted “how unpo
litical, calm, ordinary most of them are.
Their concerns revolve around educating
their children, adjusting to the language and

customs of their new environment, getting
a living—in general, involvement in the im
mediate and present concerns of life.
