# Student Interest in Racial Problems
## 
### 
The deplorable incidents in Birmingham, Alabama, during
tbe past week have evoked some welcome concern from the
Stanford student body. Their great interest has been demon
strated by speeches, rallies and substantial contributions in
support of Southern Negroes.
The customary apathy displayed by tbe student body has
been replaced, in large part, by the feeling that, as Annin
Rosencranz wrote in a letter to President Kennedy, “we are
no longer dealing with a Negro problem, but a white prob
lem.”
It is difficult to say whether this “feeling” will evoke real
action or not. Contributing to CORE may serve to ease a few
consciences, but it is not enough.
Racial discrimination is not confined to Birmingham. It
also exists right here in our own community. Palo Alto hous
ing discrimination, fraternity discrimination clauses, school
district gerrymandering and even Admissions Office favorit
ism are among the things about which students can and
should be concerned. They are all problems on which stu
dent action can have a direct effect.
It is unfortunate that it took a situation like the one in
Birmingham to arouse student concern. However, now that
the concern has finally come, students should also direct it to
problems in the immediate vicinity.
