# Rosencranz Letter to Kennedy

### 
Dear President Kennedy:
Events of the past week at Stanford University have shown
a heightened student concern over the Negro situation in Ameri
ca, and particularly over the recent incidents in Birmingham,
Alabama.
Two days ago an overflow crowd of 2050 people turned out
to hear author James Baldwin, who focused on the present situ
ation in Birmingham and deplored the federal government’s
quiescence.
Yesterday a rally was called to express support for the
Negro demonstrators in Birmingham. Both lounges of the Me
morial Union were filled to capacity. $728 was collected at this
meeting and will be sent to the Student Non-Violent Coordinat
ing Committee and the Southern Christian Leadership Con
ference.
Collection of funds is continuing today at a booth set up at
a main intersection on campus.
Presumably the concern of the Stanford student community
is typical of the reaction of students all over America. The
feeling seems to be that we are no longer dealing with a Negro
problem, but a “white” problem.
