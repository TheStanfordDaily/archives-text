## Tenor Sullivan: 'Pleasant, Skillful' 
### WALTER MOORE 
Tho current season of the ASSU Concert Series came to a
close Monday evening with the appearance of tenor Brian Sul
livan at Memorial Auditorium. Mr. Sullivan substituted on ex
tremely short notice for the indisposed Anna Moffo, offering a
pleasant and hetergeneous program.
Sullivan’s voice is not strikingly beautiful and suffers from
a lack of dynamic flexibility and coloristic shadings. He uses his
limited equipment skillfully, however, and taste and conviction
mark all his efforts. Among the musical distinctions of his
singing are sensitivity of phrasing and secure intonation, both
of which worked toward fine results in Strauss’ “Traum durch
die Daemmerung.” Elsewhere it was good to hear the Pagliacci
and Tosca arias sung without the usual bathos, and the less
well known pieces of Massenet and Lalo. The repealed use of
falsetto in the ballads and Viennese group, while never inoffen
sive to the ear, is simply not legitimate singing and its effective
ness palled quickly. Songs of Pursell, Schumann, Britten, Cop
land. Foster and arias from Carmen and Rigoletto completed the
program. Sullivan was most sympathetically partenered by
Ralph Linsley, whose work at the ill-mannered piano was char
acterized by graceful fluency and beautiful tone.
Recognition should be given at this time to Tom Pullum
and the Concert Series staff and Mr. William Cleveland, whose
combined responsibility it is to see that each program has been
effectively presented. They have again assembled a varied and
distinguished series for next year which should prove of interest
to all.
