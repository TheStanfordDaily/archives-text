Editors, The Daily:
In The Daily of May 9, William M. Baldwin charged that the
Stanford Bookstore was “either . . . making considerable profit
or is operating a most inefficient organization.” The basis of
Mr. Baldwin’s reasoning seems to be a differential in the price
of a certain foreign textbook, which can be purchased by mail
for $2.64 and which is sold here for $3.30, discount included. I
am not qualified to launch into a dissertation on the reasons
for this differential, but various factors would enter into the
picture. A large shipment of books would not qualify for the
relatively low mail charges, for such packages, to be mailed,
would have to be loss than 11 pounds. There are also other as
pects which I believe only a person Duly familiar with the book
business could understand or communicate. However, statistics
speak for themselves, and the latest, audit figures available in
dicate that during the period Sept. 1, 1961, to August 31, 1962,
the total sales of the Bookstore were $1,520,142. Cost of goods
sold was $1,063,371, or 69.95 per cent of the total; net discounts
to students and faculty amounted to $133,171, or 8.77 per cent;
operating expenses amounted to $301,569, or 19.84 per cent. The
resulting income from operation was $21,942, or 1.44 per cent;
another $3356 was attributed to miscellaneous income.
The above figures would seem to indicate without a shadow
of a doubt that the Bookstore has not been swimming in uncon
scionable profits. I would also say that an operation which holds
its expenses to less than 20 per cent of its sales is not a par
ticularly inefficient organization.
Above figures are from the “Report of the Students’ Or
ganizations Fund” for the fiscal year ending Aug. 21, 1962.

Although the problem of pitcketing has at least temporarily
been resolved, anyone with a slightly morbid sense of humor
may enjoy one aspect of its aftermath, for once again the Ad
ministration seems—with truly amazing agility—to have suc
ceeded in stabbing itself in its back. Although the find is
relatively minor, those interested in examining it should refer
to a recent (and very good) publication of the Stanford PACE
Program, “The Edge of Greatness.” Since it was printed in
April, 1963, it was undoubtedly written before the demonstra
tions of the Peace Caucus began. In one part of it present Stan
ford students are compared with those of previous generations.
And President Sterling comments, "they are deeply curious.
They want to explore all sides of a question, and when they have
convictions, they believe in taking action. If this means walking
a picket line, this they will do.” True, President Sterling does
not actually say he favors picketing as a method of expressing
one’s convictions, but to the uncritical observer he certainly
seems to imply it.
If this is his implication, in this particular situation his
position seems a little like that of the man who always seemed
to favor integration—until a Negro family moved into the
neighborhood. Then the man made clear that he was. of course,
in favor of integration, but not in “private, residential districts.”
Perhaps—in view of the flexibility which seems to charac
terize the administration’s policies on picketing, “partisan
stands,” etc.—the title of PACE’s film on Stanford should be
changed from “Trembing” to “Vacillating on the edge of great
ness.”

I just want to say what a fine thing I think it is that the
management of the Stanford Country Club and Vacationjand
Resort Motel has put up those nice,big yellow-amUbrown signs
all down the length of Palm Drive. Other vacation spots—na
tional parks, natural bridges, even reptile farms and Harold’s
Club—have always outdone Stanford in roadside advertising due
to the backward and old-fashioned mentality which has pre
vailed in the front office.
But now at last we have some modern, energentic, fast
moving men managing Stanford, men who do things that need
to be done, time-and-money-savers who see the value of modern
ization and roadside advertising. And if our signs aren’t quite
as high and impressive as the signs for Rickey’s or the Cabana
Club on the Camino, well after all, they’re just a beginning.
Stanford can’t expect to be the best place of its kind in a
mere year or two, but as soon as all the PACE money is in I’m
sure that Stanford will be just as all-glass and formica, just
as modern as electronic as the Cabana Club. And if we show
enough promise and progressive up-to-date spirit, perhaps Hilton
Hotels will subsidize us and make us part of their chain; ‘The
Stanford Hilton, with Branches in Eurapo and Asia, and a Cli
entele from the Four Corners of the World.’
But I’d better leave the invention of such slogans to those
far-sighted administrative minds who have already put Stan
ford’s signs on the Road To Progress.

Editors, The Daily:
At the end of his lecture here Wednesday, James Baldwin
posed a question many of us will not soon forget, .. if I'm
not the nigger here who is?’
Who, indeed? It is well known, of course, that the number
of Negro students at Stanford (and other similar universities)
is quite small. Why is this so? Is it because, as one is fre
quently told, there are (unfortunately) too few qualified Ne
groes? Or, as one hears just as often, is it because Negroes
don’t wish to come here? If either or both of these is true, then
it would seem that a bit of serious soul-searching is in order.
It would seem, in any case, to he a question of great interest
to those students who rose to their feet to applaud Mr. Baldwin
at such length Wednesday. It is a question, of course, which
would have to be asked rather loudly and in the right places.

Editors, The Daily;
Thank you for allowing Messrs. Friedenthal, Sher, and Was
serstrom to publish in your columns their longish letter on the
P.G. & E. lines, a subject of perhaps only routine interest to the
students. The fact is that the faculty have no means to exchange
opinions or to publicize them and The Daily is helpful. One
might imagine that the Faculty-Staff Newsletter would be such
a means, but it is a shameful little thing, a veritable ‘house
organ’; one might mistake its cheerful and puerile tone for
“Women’s Day.” It does not reflect a great university nor even
suggest association with one.
