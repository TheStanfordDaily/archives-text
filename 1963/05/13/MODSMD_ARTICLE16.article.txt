## TITLE HOPES DIMMED Tribe Nine Gains Split With UCLA on 13th Inning Rally 
### MARSHALL COOK 
A four-run outburst in the thir
teenth inning, coupled with the
iron-armed pit clung of Darrell
Sutherland, salvaged a split of
the week-end’s toil for Stanford's
varsity. The Indians outlasted
UCLA 7-3 in 13 innings Saturday
after falling apart Friday and
losing 6-0.
In Friday’s game the Tribe
couldn’t do anything right. They
managed only three harmless sin
gles against Bruin left-hander
Tom Pedersen. The sharp south
paw retired 16 out of Ihe last 17
Indians he faced to record the
shutout.
MEANWHILE Stanford hinder
Jim Lonhorg was being laced for
11 hits. However, the fault was
not his. The Indians made an un

believable nine errors, including
three by shortstop Joel Shulman
and two by third baseman Gary
Smith, to make the fold complete.
The Bruins scored more than
enough runs to secure the win for
Pedersen in the first round. After
UCLA had loaded the bases,
shortstop Ezell Singleton singled
home the first run. Then left
fielder Bob Cox and catcher
Chuck French made consecutive
errors. When the smoke cleared
UCLA had three runs.
The Bruins added a run in the
fourth and single tallies in the
seventh and eighth against Lon
borg to insure victory.
THE SECOND game started
out looking like a repeat per
formance on Saturday. This time
Larry Zeno seemed untouchable,
turning back the Indians through
the first five innings. UCLA
scored two runs off Sutherland
in the bottom of the fifth, and it
began to look like Stanford would
lose any hope of a CIBA title.
But the Tribe came alive, shov
ing across two in the sixth to dis
pose of Zeno. The Bruins tallied
again in the seventh, and the In
dians again to tie it at 3-3 in the
eighth. And there the score re
mained as Sutherland dueled
with three UCLA pitchers.

I Stanford finally broke loose in
i the thirteenth frame to call a halt
to the marathon. Gary Smith
j opened up the inning with a
! double against Bruin Tom Bot
jtoms. Catcher French then beat
out a bunt single. French broke
| for second on a steal attempt,
! and when the Bruin catcher Ger
j shon tried to nail him at second
1 Smith broke for the plate. The
| desperate toss back was too late,
and before the gates were closed
I the Indians had collected three
more runs for good measure.
I SUTHERLAND went all the
way for Stanford, allowing only
| nine hits through thirteen in-
I nings.
j While Stanford was stumbling
to a split, SC’s Trojans were
sweeping two from hapless, hope
less California. Thus the Trojans
take over first place in the CIBA
with a 9-5 mark. UCLA, which
! has finished all its games, trails
| with a 9-7 record. The Indians, at
j 7-6, have only a theoretical chance
at the title.

Larry Zeno seemed untouchable,

scored two runs off Sutherland
in the bottom of the fifth, and it
began to look like Stanford would
lose any hope of a CIBA title.
But the Tribe came alive, shov

pose of Zeno. The Bruins tallied
again in the seventh, and the In
dians again to tie it at 3-3 in the
eighth. And there the score re
mained as Sutherland dueled
with three UCLA pitchers.

I Stanford finally broke loose in
i the thirteenth frame to call a halt
to the marathon. Gary Smith
j opened up the inning with a
! double against Bruin Tom Bot
jtoms. Catcher French then beat
out a bunt single. French broke
| for second on a steal attempt,
! and when the Bruin catcher Ger

1 Smith broke for the plate. The

and before the gates were closed
I the Indians had collected three
more runs for good measure.
I SUTHERLAND went all the
way for Stanford, allowing only

I nings.
j While Stanford was stumbling
to a split, SC’s Trojans were
sweeping two from hapless, hope

A four-run outburst in the thir

varsity. The Indians outlasted
UCLA 7-3 in 13 innings Saturday
after falling apart Friday and

couldn’t do anything right. They

shutout.

The Stanford freshman
baseball team plays a good
San Francisco State team to
day at 3 p.m. on (lie Fresh
man Diamond, across from
Sunken Diamond.
A four-run outburst in the thir
teenth inning, coupled with the
iron-armed pit clung of Darrell
Sutherland, salvaged a split of
the week-end’s toil for Stanford's
varsity. The Indians outlasted
UCLA 7-3 in 13 innings Saturday
after falling apart Friday and
losing 6-0.
In Friday’s game the Tribe
couldn’t do anything right. They
managed only three harmless sin
gles against Bruin left-hander
Tom Pedersen. The sharp south
paw retired 16 out of Ihe last 17
Indians he faced to record the
shutout.
MEANWHILE Stanford hinder
Jim Lonhorg was being laced for
11 hits. However, the fault was
not his. The Indians made an un

believable nine errors, including
three by shortstop Joel Shulman
and two by third baseman Gary
Smith, to make the fold complete.
The Bruins scored more than
enough runs to secure the win for
Pedersen in the first round. After
UCLA had loaded the bases,
shortstop Ezell Singleton singled
home the first run. Then left
fielder Bob Cox and catcher
Chuck French made consecutive
errors. When the smoke cleared
UCLA had three runs.
The Bruins added a run in the
fourth and single tallies in the
seventh and eighth against Lon
borg to insure victory.
THE SECOND game started
out looking like a repeat per
formance on Saturday. This time
Larry Zeno seemed untouchable,
turning back the Indians through
the first five innings. UCLA
scored two runs off Sutherland
in the bottom of the fifth, and it
began to look like Stanford would
lose any hope of a CIBA title.
But the Tribe came alive, shov
ing across two in the sixth to dis
pose of Zeno. The Bruins tallied
again in the seventh, and the In
dians again to tie it at 3-3 in the
eighth. And there the score re
mained as Sutherland dueled
with three UCLA pitchers.

I Stanford finally broke loose in
i the thirteenth frame to call a halt
to the marathon. Gary Smith
j opened up the inning with a
! double against Bruin Tom Bot
jtoms. Catcher French then beat
out a bunt single. French broke
| for second on a steal attempt,
! and when the Bruin catcher Ger
j shon tried to nail him at second
1 Smith broke for the plate. The
| desperate toss back was too late,
and before the gates were closed
I the Indians had collected three
more runs for good measure.
