# USC Edges Trackmen in Fresno Relays
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
j Post-graduate athletes dominat
| ed most of the events at the West
Coast Relays in Fresno this week
end and were responsible for
most of the noteworthy' perform
ances; hut Stanford and USC
battled nearly equally in the col
legiate team competition, and (he
Trojans finally won by a hair,
56-53. It was SC's 30th consecu
tive win in this meet. It was also
SC’s second scant victory over
I Stanford this season; Troy won
j I he AAWU dual meet over the In-
I dians, 73-72, three week ago.
Although the college trackmen
were participating along with
such stars as Parry O'Brien,
Blaine Lindgren, Jay Silvester,
and Ralph Boston, their marks
were scored separately on a col
lege team competition basis;
j freshman performances did not
1 count. Relay events were scored
j 10-8-6-4-2-1 and individual events
| 5-4-3-2-1.
This scheme held for all events
j except the invitation 440-yard
dash in which Stanford's Rich
Chesarek was the top collegian,
behind four graduates, competing
{ for various athletic clubs. Ches
j arek finished in 47.9, and had he
been awarded five points for this
collegiate individual first, Stan
| ford would have won the meet.
| Instead the event was not scored.
STANFORD had a couple of
other chances to beat USC in the
overall scoring. In both the 880
and mile relays. Stanford finished
third, both times behind USC, in
second place. A second place fin
isher in either of these events
| would have given Stanford the
I points necessary to top SC.
( Actually, SC’s mile time, 3:11.5,
I was half a second faster than the
j best previous performance by
j Len Breschini, Ken Emanuels,
i Ken Fraser, and Rich Cheserak;
| this quartet ran 3:14.5 Saturday.
The 880 time run by Phil Lamo
j reaux, Eric Frische, Cheserak,
and Larry Questad, 1:25.4, was
their best this year.
Their 440 relay time of 41.0 was
also a season’s best and was good
for third place.
INCIDENTALLY, Arizona

State’s outstanding array of I
speedsters won all three of these |
sprint relays, the 440, 880, and !
mile. The best ASIT performance
was in the 880 race, where the |
1 :22.9 time of Tom Hester, Ron j
Freeman, Ulis Williams, and :
Henry Carr was a meet, record j
anti only 0:00.3 off the world rec
ord. Despite ASU’s 30 points
alone from these wins, it got few I
points in the individual events, j
and finished with 31, a distant i
third in the team scoring.
Along with its thirds in the 440, |
880, and mile relays, Stanford i
also finished third in the two- (
mile relay and fourth in the dis-!
tance medley race. The respective
times were 7:33.6 and 9:55.5, Thus
Stanford scored 28 points in relay j
events.
STANFORD’S only accredited
first place in the meet came in j
the discus, where Dave Weill, the
NCAA’s best, won with 183-2. Jay
Silvester, throwing for the Pasa
dena Olympians, had the over all
best mark, 194-11 L; this is 21 1 -
inches farther than Weill’s best,
Stanford received second place !
points in two field events. Dan j
Moore, finally coming back into
his top broad jumping form |
which won the AAWU champion-!
ship last year, leaped 24-B>2. Sid ;
Nicholas of Fresno State heat him >
by a half inch, however, to win I
first place.
Shot putter Steve Arch won the
other second. He threw 55-814. It
was a lengthy four feet, 214
inches behind the winning mark, i
59-11, by Occidental’s John Mc-
Grath. It was even farther be
hind Parry O’Brien’s 60-6’/i.
JACK (RAPPEE picked up
two fourth-place points in the
shot put with a toss of 55 feel '
even.
The only other scoring Stan-!
ford did in the field events came !
via Steve Cortright’s fifth place!
triple jump of 4714. The high
light of this event, however, was |
a wind-aided 54-514 jump by Ma- j
honey Samuels of the British I
West Indies.
Stanford picked up various and
sundry points in the races, but j
was always out of the top two j
places (except for Chesarek’s |
440). The best Indian perform
ance was Questad’s 100-yard
qualifying heat. He ran 9.4, tying j
the fastest time in Stanford his- j
tory; but a 4.8 m.p.h. wind will I
disqualify it as a record. Never-1

theless, Questad came back in
the finals to run 9.5 and finish
third. The top two men, John
Gilbert of the L.A. Striders and
Dave Morris of USC were also
clocked in 9.5. Eric Frische ran

fifth, 9.R.
IN THE Mlf.E, Paul Schlirke
sot a personal record of 4:09.7 tr
finish third. For the first time h
a month he appeared to he re
covered from his foot injury.
