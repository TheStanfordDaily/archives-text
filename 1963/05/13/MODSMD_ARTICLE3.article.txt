Socialism and the poems and
paintings of Kenneth Pachen will

Democratic Socialism” at 8 p.m.
Ho is the theoretical leader of
the left-wing of the Socialist Par
ly and is an editor of “New Poli
tics,” the newest important So
cialist quarterly. Past editor of
the “New International” and “La
bor Action,” Marxist publications,
his writing have included such
topics as "the theory of the
American war-economy” and “the

bureaucratic-collectivist analysis
of Russian society.”
KENNETH I* ATT HEN'S paint
ing will be discussed at 4:30 p.m.
try Richard Bowman. Stanford art
instructor and friend of the poet
painter. These highly-controversi
al paintirrgs have been described
by Lawrence Ferlinghetti as “in
a class with the best of Nolde and
Chagall. There is no doubt that
they are works of genius.”
Proceeding this talk, record
ings of Patchen, who is now bed
ridden with a critical spinal con
dition, will be played. Some of
the poems were recorded in Can
ada and others in San Francisco
with the Chamber Jazz Sextet, a
group of former Stanford stu
dents. Refreshments will be
served.
