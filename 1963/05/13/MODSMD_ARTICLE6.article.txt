# College Panic' Replaces Applicants' Spring Fever

### EMILY BARTHOLOMEW 
The annual College Panic is
I about to begin again. With
| .spr ing, the thoughts of young
j men and women turn- to love?
| No, as repor ted by Peter' Schras
| in the New York Times, they
| turn to College Board tests, fel
lowship applications, and letters
j beginning "I am happy to in-
I form you , .
I The College Panic came into
| being several years ago during
! some dull days between the
I launching of Sputnik and the dis
covery that Johnny Can't Read.
| Once invented, it became a tra
dition. Some of its articles of
faith are:
1. TESTS DISCRIMINATE
I against Creative Students. The
Deep Thinker will be puzzled by
i such a question as “The ‘Emper
| or’ is ( a) a concerto (b) a work
| of chamber music (c) a Swiss
I mountain yodel.” The Deep
j Thinker knows that the ‘Emper-
I or’ is both a concerto by Beetho
i ven and a Haydn quartet. The
I Superficial Student will simply
check the concerto because the
; Haydn quartet is less well known.
| However, a “really” Deep Think
! or also knows that tests are built
| for Superficial Students and so
i disregards the temptation to
prove that he’s also heard of
j Haydn.
2. Good colleges discriminate
I against public school graduates;

against athletes (scholars);
against Jews (Negroes, Episco
palians. Turks); against students
who are creative (well rounded,
Poor Test Takers, sons of alumni,
not sons of alumni).
3. There is no such thing as a
Good College west of the East
Coast,
THE COLLEGE PANIC is ac
cessible to any institution that
wishes to join. All that is neces
sary is to issue a report denying
the existence of any panic. At
Midwest Mugwump, for instance,
the president announces that
many colleges that give a good
education are not crowded. Ap
plications begin to rise, and Mid
west joins a competitive en
trance examination program. A
new admissions man is hired to
travel to high schools and dis
courage applications. The Panic
increases applications double
and double again. Midwest has
become a Prestige College, even
though the faculty still includes
the same old deadheads, the pres
ident is a stuffed shirt and the
curriculum is still dull. The pres
ident is quoted in national maga
zines saying that the College
Panic has been greatly exagger
ated. It is not necessary for every
student to attend an institution
like Mugwump to get a good edu
cation. There are already many
good colleges that are not crowd
ed. although no one can remem
ber their names.
