of Alabama. Neither the units nor
the bases were immediately iden
tified.
The While House said Kennedy
acted under U.S. law giving him
authority to deal with “civil dis
turbances” as provided in the
U.S. code, title 10, section 333.
Kennedy said he also was send
ing Assistant Ally. Gen. Burke
Marshall back to Birmingham
last night to try to bring about
peaceful conditions again.
MARSHALL, who acted to
bring white and Negro loaders to
gether on an agreement two days
ago, was one of the officials
called to hurried conferences yes
terday after news of the Birming
ham violence reached Washing
ton.
Kennedy interrupted his week
end at Camp David, Md„ to return
to the White House, while his
brother, Atty. Gen. Robert F.

Deputy Atty. Gen. Nicholas Katz
enbach at the Justice Depart

forces trained in riot control” and
to dispatch selected units to bases
in the vicinity of the riot-torn
city.

to take the “necessary prelimi
nary steps” for calling units of
tlie Alabama National Guard into
federal service if this becomes
necessary to maintain law and
order. .
—He sent Asst. Atty. Gen.
Burke Marshall back to Birming
hame last night to “consult with
local citizens’ in a new bid for

an agreement worked out by
white and Negro loaders last
week, with Marshall’s assistance,
was a “fair and just accord.”

would not permit that agreement
to be "sabotaged” by extremists
on either side.
“I call upon all citizens of Bir
mingham, Negro and white, to
live up to the standards of ie
sponsibility their leaders sot last
week,” Kennedy said. He said
