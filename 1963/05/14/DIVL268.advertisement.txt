"SHE WAS ONLY
THE DEAN OF MEN'S
DAUGHTER”
(But oh what a record she made)
The only trouble is, it’s been
banned. From the radio at least.
In fact, the whole darn Capitol
album, “Campus Confidential’’
by the Four Preps, has been
banned. “She Was Only the
Dean of Men’s Daughter” and
the other numbers, like “Prin
cess Poo-poo-ly Has Plenty
Papaya” are just a little too.,,
well, colorful for air play.
This album was recorded dur
ing a Four Preps Concert at
UCLA. Their performance was
wildly appreciated by the stu
dents, and we strongly suspect it
will be wildly appreciated by
everyone who hears it on this
new Capitol release. (With the
sole exception of radio station
owners who want to keep their
stations on the air.)
So slip into your nearest rec
ord store for “Campus Confi
dential'’ on Capitol. (In plain
brown wrapper, of course.)
(P S. Look for the Four Preps in
concert on your campus.)
