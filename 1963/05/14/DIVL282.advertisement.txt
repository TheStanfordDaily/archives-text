AMANDA AMBROSE.
Her piano bubbles an
intro. Her voice be
gins to belt a few
bars. And before you
know it, ROW! You’re
captivated. Every
thing sounds new.
Fresh. Exciting. First,
she seasons with a
gospel flavor. Then
the groove changes to
jazz. Now it’s pop
with a different tasty
touch. You’re over
whelmed. You've
never heard the likes
of “Too ra-100-ra loo
ra,” “A Foggy Day,”
and ‘‘Lavender Blue.”
