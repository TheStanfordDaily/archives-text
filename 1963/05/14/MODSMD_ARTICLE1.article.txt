“Marxism represents the first attempt to infuse socialist ideas
with u fundamental democratic character,” concluded Hal Draper
Diaper, political theorist of the Socialist Party, briefly sketched
the separate histories of socialistic and democratic ideas until
in his speech to the' Socialist Caucus last night.

inherent in the works of Plato,
Campanella, and More contained
no suggestion of democracy and,
rather, was characteristically

an.
According to Draper, the period
of the French Revolution marks
the beginning of both modern so
cialism and modern democracy.
Draper concentrated his discus
sion around three strains of early
socialism which emerged from
the wreckage of the revolution.
The first group of these socialists
were followers of Babeuf. Draper
emphasized that their methods
were authoritarian, involving a
dictatorship which would educate
the ‘‘popular masses.”
The second group of socialists
were followers of St. Simon. Dra
per stressed that St. Simon was
not, as text books have character
ized him, a utopian socialist.
Rather, he was concerned with
setting up a planned, industrializ
ed society, essentially bureaucrat
ic in nature. Democracy was ir
relevant to him.
The third movement were the
Utopians proper who, following
such men as Robert Owen, in
tended to set up socialist colonies.
Again, they were essentially un
concerned with democracy. Dra
per stressed that all three strains
of primitive socialism may be
“Socialism from above.”
Draper then traced the early
political development of Karl
Marx himself. He commented that
the significant fact about Marx
was that he became a socialist
by carrying the tenets of bour
geoise democratic ideas to their
logical, extreme conclusions. “The
problem for Marx,” he said, “was
the relationship between socialist
ideas, which were still new to
him, and the Democratic political
struggle: Marxism was born of
this fusion.”
