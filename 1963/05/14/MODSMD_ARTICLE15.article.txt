## The 						'Shady Deal' Revisited 
### RICHARD WEINIG Contributing Editor 
PROMISE: “We must end the harassment, which the gov
ernment has carried on, of liberty-loving anti-Castro forces in
Cuba and in other lands. While we cannot violate international
law, we must recognize that these exiles and rebels represent
the real voice of Cuba and should not be constantly handi
capped by our Immigration and Justice Department authorities,”
Candidate John F. Kennedy
October 15, 1960
Johnstown, Pennsylvania
PERFORMANCE: “We intend to take every step necessary
to insure that raids” on Castro’s Cuba “are not launched,
manned, or equipped from United States territory.”
Joint Statement
Depfs. of State and Justice
March 30, 1963

My, what a difference in the pontifications of Kennedy-On-
The Campaign Trail and the actions of Kennedy-In-The Rocking
Chair. One is hard pressed to discern standards by which this
breach of promise to the American people might be justified.
Why, after hearing the repeated pleas of the OAS to curb
extant and potential Cuban aggression, has Mr. Kennedy dis
patched the United States Coast Guard to hold the bearded dic
tator in power: to protect him from the very exiles which the
President, less than three years before, described as the “real
voice of Cuba”?
The answer is almost as perplexing as the riddle of how a
competently commanded PT boat could possibly have been
rammed broadside by a Japanese destroyer possessing less than
half the cruising speed of the smaller craft.
What reasons, then, has the President tendered for his ac
tions? (In re: Cuba, that is.) There seem to be two, each as
doubtful as the other.
(1) Is harassment of the exiles justified because harass
ment of Castro by these selfsame exiles would palpably violate
American neutrality laws? Hardly.
Such legislation merely prohibits civilian assault upon gov
ernments with which the United States holds normal and friend
ly relations. Thus, it is difficult to envision how this provision
would be applicable to a nation with which the United States
has severed diplomatic relations and about which she has estab
lished a partial blockade within the past seven months. There
fore, if the Justice Department is to prohibit exile action against
Castro on this basis, it must treat the law as a cobbler treats
shoe leather: rubbing it, pressing it, and stretching it with the
teeth, all to the end of making it fit Mr. Kennedy’s purposes.
(2) Well, then, the first explanation being faulty, can the
President’s actions be justified by the other reason which he has
put forward: that raids upon Cuba will do nothing to weaken
Castro and will but increase his popular following. Mr. Kennedy.
Be serious!
The argument seems oblivious to reality upon three counts:
(a) The Cuban people are in no wise enamoured of Castro
and according to the AP’s veteran Havana correspondent, Walter
Irohan, informed British sources feel that less than twenty per
cent support his regime at the present time.
(b) Under such conditions, the influence of any revolution
ary activity cannot be underestimated. Witness the results of a
revolution which Castro began with an initial force of less than
eighty men.
(c) Therefore, how Castro’s present power will be weakened by
terminating all aid to revolutionary groups within Cuba defies
explanation.
Thus, it appears as if the reasons advanced by Mr. Kennedy
for his actions bear only the most coincidental relationship to
the truth.
What, then, is the real reason for Mr. Kennedy’s actions?
Might the answer be found in a communique from Premier
Khrushchev to the White House on March 7? I quote: “By al
lowing the Cuban counterrevolutionaries its territory and ma
terial means for organizing piratical attacks against the Republic
of Cuba the United States is violating the agreement reached
between the governments of the USSR and the United States
(last fall) on the crisis in the area of the Caribbean.”
Need one speculate further?

President’s actions be justified by the other reason which he has
put forward: that raids upon Cuba will do nothing to weaken
Castro and will but increase his popular following. Mr. Kennedy.
Be serious!
The argument seems oblivious to reality upon three counts:
(a) The Cuban people are in no wise enamoured of Castro
and according to the AP’s veteran Havana correspondent, Walter
Irohan, informed British sources feel that less than twenty per
cent support his regime at the present time.
(b) Under such conditions, the influence of any revolution
ary activity cannot be underestimated. Witness the results of a
revolution which Castro began with an initial force of less than
eighty men.
(c) Therefore, how Castro’s present power will be weakened by
terminating all aid to revolutionary groups within Cuba defies
explanation.
Thus, it appears as if the reasons advanced by Mr. Kennedy
for his actions bear only the most coincidental relationship to
the truth.
What, then, is the real reason for Mr. Kennedy’s actions?
Might the answer be found in a communique from Premier
Khrushchev to the White House on March 7? I quote: “By al
lowing the Cuban counterrevolutionaries its territory and ma
terial means for organizing piratical attacks against the Republic
of Cuba the United States is violating the agreement reached
between the governments of the USSR and the United States
(last fall) on the crisis in the area of the Caribbean.”
Need one speculate further?
PROMISE: “We must end the harassment, which the gov
ernment has carried on, of liberty-loving anti-Castro forces in
Cuba and in other lands. While we cannot violate international
law, we must recognize that these exiles and rebels represent
the real voice of Cuba and should not be constantly handi
capped by our Immigration and Justice Department authorities,”
Candidate John F. Kennedy
October 15, 1960
Johnstown, Pennsylvania
PERFORMANCE: “We intend to take every step necessary
to insure that raids” on Castro’s Cuba “are not launched,
manned, or equipped from United States territory.”

My, what a difference in the pontifications of Kennedy-On-
The Campaign Trail and the actions of Kennedy-In-The Rocking
Chair. One is hard pressed to discern standards by which this
breach of promise to the American people might be justified.
Why, after hearing the repeated pleas of the OAS to curb
extant and potential Cuban aggression, has Mr. Kennedy dis
patched the United States Coast Guard to hold the bearded dic
tator in power: to protect him from the very exiles which the
President, less than three years before, described as the “real
voice of Cuba”?
The answer is almost as perplexing as the riddle of how a
competently commanded PT boat could possibly have been
rammed broadside by a Japanese destroyer possessing less than
half the cruising speed of the smaller craft.
What reasons, then, has the President tendered for his ac
tions? (In re: Cuba, that is.) There seem to be two, each as
doubtful as the other.
(1) Is harassment of the exiles justified because harass
ment of Castro by these selfsame exiles would palpably violate
American neutrality laws? Hardly.
Such legislation merely prohibits civilian assault upon gov
ernments with which the United States holds normal and friend
ly relations. Thus, it is difficult to envision how this provision
would be applicable to a nation with which the United States
has severed diplomatic relations and about which she has estab
lished a partial blockade within the past seven months. There
fore, if the Justice Department is to prohibit exile action against
Castro on this basis, it must treat the law as a cobbler treats
shoe leather: rubbing it, pressing it, and stretching it with the
teeth, all to the end of making it fit Mr. Kennedy’s purposes.
(2) Well, then, the first explanation being faulty, can the
President’s actions be justified by the other reason which he has
put forward: that raids upon Cuba will do nothing to weaken
Castro and will but increase his popular following. Mr. Kennedy.
