Editors, The Daily:
Wednesday, May 8, Bruce Naegeli, chairman of the Con
servative Caucus, charged that pacifism is an anachronism
today. Although I do not run with the bearded, barefoot peace
mongers, I am obliged to reply because of my own stand of
Christian-paciflsm.
Mr. Naegeli’s article reveals a misunderstanding of pacifism
and its basic nature. At the very heart of pacifism, religious or
secular, lies the moral decision that homicide is wrong, whether
it be a result of individual action or massive organization. De
spite the flurry of propaganda, a true pacifist can never be con
vinced that the whims of either his government or of any gov
ernment antagonistic to him can justify his committing this
basic wrong. Mr Naegeli makes the gross error of identifying
isolationism with pacifism. The Isolationists with their cries of
“No more foreign wars!” and “No more American boys
killed!” were concerned for no country but the United States and
were prompted merely by fear, not a moral belief. The pacifist
has always been an internationalist, equally concerned for the
fate of a Japanese boy invading China as for an American de
fending France. Furthermore, he never seeks to protect his life
with his stand as did the isolationists; on the contrary, he is
vyilling to forfeit life should the price of maintaining his convic
tions ever be so high.
Mr. Naegeli finds it alltoocasy to generalize about the conflict
between the Allies and the Axis of World War 11, and about the
current Western-Communist conflict. He should be reminded
that “rule by divine rignt” was hardly any less a philosophy or
doctrine of tyranny than have been Fascism and Communism.
Furthermore, Fascists and Communists have been hardly any
more expansion minded, “for its own sake,” than were Napoleon,
or Great Britain in the era of the “white man’s burden.”
It is not war that stops an ideology. Contrary to Mr. Nae
geli’s suggestion. Fascism will be destroyed when intelligent
people are no longer willing to accept it. World War II destroyed
the Fascist great powers, not Fascism. To destroy an ideology
one must meet it on the common ground of the intellect and
defeat it. Suppressing it can never be a permanent solution. Ap
parently Americans feel it is worthwhile to halt the spread of
Communism, hut most of them are too lazy to fight it in a
moral, permanently effective way. It is easier to kill a Commu
nist than it is to convince him that Capitalism and individualism
are preferable. One need resort to arms to stop a tyrannical ide
ology only when he no longer believes so strongly in the superi
ority of his own ideology as to think others will choose it over
tyranny. When he becomes convinced that his system can only
be maintained by force against external and internal stresses,
he admits that his ideology is no more attractive than others and
resorts to tyranny himself to maintain his stronghold.
There are of course many variations of pacifism, and the
pacifist never faces easy, cut and dried decisions. Yet pacifism,
by the moral nature of its basis, can never be outmoded any
more than morality. No self-respecting, dedicated pacifist can
ever accept homicide as a satisfactory solution to man’s prob
lems. Indeed, history teaches him that claiming war can right
wrongs, end wars, or destroy ideologies is fallicious, even ana
chronistic.

Since the “Birmingham Rally” was by declaration and in
tent not a symposium—we were called there to emote, morally
and financially—perhaps there is reason to consider the meet
ing and its subject in a different context. Apparently we Ameri
cans have to get together periodically to massage each other’s
conscience and rejuvenate our sensitivity to injustice. Certainly
the immediacy of the Birmingham crisis made the meeting
appropriate.
But it is somewhat tragic that we remain relatively unim
pressed and uninformed until the quantity of justice becomes
overwhelming. Conditions in Birmingham, particularly since the
Supreme Court Decision in 1954, have been amply documented.
Connor’s callous treatment of Negroes, the use of police dogs,
intimidation, violence, unsolved racial crimes, etc. have been an
integral life of that city for sometime—and so reported. Why
an expression of horror and indignation must await glaring
headlines is understandable but also disquieting.
It is obvious that Martin Luther King’s dramatic and ef
fective leadership has been invaluable to the cause of desegre
gation. Certainly the segregation pattern in Birmingham could
not have been visibly broken without some kind of mass demon
stration. but the ultimate responsibility for the improvement of
race relations devolves on those in the city who care—still a
pitifully small number of whites. Those few have been active in
the Alabama Council on Human Relations, a biracial organiza
tion. Because they have been active, they have been subjected
to intense economic and social pressure and to physical threats.
Their efforts have gone unpublicized (except by segregation
ists), and their resources have been extremely limited. But they
will be there long after the demonstrations have subsided, help
ing to pick up the pieces and working to create an enduring and
pervasive pattern of desegregation.

Under the sponsorship of the Foreign Students Association,
the foreign students from many lands have joined their U.S. col
leagues to form the Stanford University Cricket Club and have
entered a team to play in the League Cup Competition of the
California Cricket Association. I need not say how pleased the
league officials are at this entry of a very enthusiastic new team
consisting of 36 members and all fine gentlemen from lands as
far away as India, Hongkong, Ceylon, Australia, England and,
of course, from Canada and the United States.
Last Sunday, in a game against the Golden Gate Cricket
Club of Berkeley, a most extraordinary and distressing incident
occurred. The game was being played on the Intramural Field
at Stanford and shortly prior to its conclusion the groundsman
announced in very rude tones that everybody was to get off the
field because it was 5:30 p.m. or he was going to get the police
to throw everybody out. It appears on further inquiry that he
wanted to close the “gate” on the road leading to the Intramural
Field. This act of closing the gale consists of drawing a chain
across the road and locking a lock. It is most surprising that the
campus police could not be entrusted to do this simple chore after
the game is finished or alternate arrangements made to secure
the grounds as required by the University authorities. It is
rather absurd to require that the grounds be vacated by 5:30
p.m. when daylight lasts until 8 p.m. I should point out further
that no such restrictions are put on any of the other 6 teams in
the league who play on school grounds or public playing fields
such as the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.
It is to be hoped that Stanford University authorities will do
everything in their power to ensure that our guests from foreign
lands are free and welcome to play the games of their choice
without unnecessary and irritating restrictions. As an American.
I was ashamed to note the manner in which a petty official of
the University behaved in a high and mighty manner, indeed a
personification of “The Ugly American at Home.” hardly a good
impression of American hospitality which these students might
take back with them to their home lands.

Editors, The Daily:
Last Wednesday Mr. Naegeli of the Conservative Caucus
wrote that Pacifism is anachronistic and “irrelevant.” I don’t
think Mr. Naegeli knows what Pacifism is. At least he does not
know what freedom is—his article shows that. He writes that
pacifists “demand that we ignore the threat to freedom while
we try to avoid war.” But everybody knows—everybody except
the members of the Conservative Caucus—that the soldier is
the least free of all men, for to be a good soldier he must submit
his mind to those in authority over him. If Mr. Naegeli knew
what freedom is he would know that nothing, no one, literally
nothing and no one, can take freedom away, for freedom, after
all, is not freedom of action but freedom of thought, and the
only way we can lose that freedom is by giving it up.
I think Mr. Naegeli is afraid, and I think the thing he is
afraid of is death—not his ow’n death only, but the physical
death of mankind. To a certain extent Pacifism is afraid of the
same thing, and to the extent that it concerns itself with life
and death it is irrelevant, though not anachronistic. A free man
does not fear death, and he does not fear his nation's enemy—
these are the irrelevant things.
I can paraphrase too. I can paraphrase Seneca and say that
Mr. Naegeli, and those that think as Mr. Naegeli thinks, do not
care about freedom, but only how long mankind (with the
possible exception of the pacifists) lives, though it is within the
reach of every man to be free, and less and less within the power
of mankind to decide the length of its existence.

Last Wednesday Mr. Naegeli of the Conservative Caucus
wrote that Pacifism is anachronistic and “irrelevant.” I don’t
think Mr. Naegeli knows what Pacifism is. At least he does not
know what freedom is—his article shows that. He writes that
pacifists “demand that we ignore the threat to freedom while
we try to avoid war.” But everybody knows—everybody except
the members of the Conservative Caucus—that the soldier is
the least free of all men, for to be a good soldier he must submit
his mind to those in authority over him. If Mr. Naegeli knew
what freedom is he would know that nothing, no one, literally
nothing and no one, can take freedom away, for freedom, after
all, is not freedom of action but freedom of thought, and the
only way we can lose that freedom is by giving it up.
I think Mr. Naegeli is afraid, and I think the thing he is
afraid of is death—not his ow’n death only, but the physical
death of mankind. To a certain extent Pacifism is afraid of the
same thing, and to the extent that it concerns itself with life
and death it is irrelevant, though not anachronistic. A free man
does not fear death, and he does not fear his nation's enemy—
these are the irrelevant things.
I can paraphrase too. I can paraphrase Seneca and say that
Mr. Naegeli, and those that think as Mr. Naegeli thinks, do not
care about freedom, but only how long mankind (with the
possible exception of the pacifists) lives, though it is within the
reach of every man to be free, and less and less within the power
of mankind to decide the length of its existence.

Wednesday, May 8, Bruce Naegeli, chairman of the Con
servative Caucus, charged that pacifism is an anachronism
today. Although I do not run with the bearded, barefoot peace
mongers, I am obliged to reply because of my own stand of
Christian-paciflsm.
Mr. Naegeli’s article reveals a misunderstanding of pacifism
and its basic nature. At the very heart of pacifism, religious or
secular, lies the moral decision that homicide is wrong, whether
it be a result of individual action or massive organization. De
spite the flurry of propaganda, a true pacifist can never be con
vinced that the whims of either his government or of any gov
ernment antagonistic to him can justify his committing this
basic wrong. Mr Naegeli makes the gross error of identifying
isolationism with pacifism. The Isolationists with their cries of
“No more foreign wars!” and “No more American boys
killed!” were concerned for no country but the United States and
were prompted merely by fear, not a moral belief. The pacifist
has always been an internationalist, equally concerned for the
fate of a Japanese boy invading China as for an American de
fending France. Furthermore, he never seeks to protect his life
with his stand as did the isolationists; on the contrary, he is
vyilling to forfeit life should the price of maintaining his convic
tions ever be so high.
Mr. Naegeli finds it alltoocasy to generalize about the conflict
between the Allies and the Axis of World War 11, and about the
current Western-Communist conflict. He should be reminded
that “rule by divine rignt” was hardly any less a philosophy or
doctrine of tyranny than have been Fascism and Communism.
Furthermore, Fascists and Communists have been hardly any
more expansion minded, “for its own sake,” than were Napoleon,
or Great Britain in the era of the “white man’s burden.”
It is not war that stops an ideology. Contrary to Mr. Nae
geli’s suggestion. Fascism will be destroyed when intelligent
people are no longer willing to accept it. World War II destroyed
the Fascist great powers, not Fascism. To destroy an ideology
one must meet it on the common ground of the intellect and
defeat it. Suppressing it can never be a permanent solution. Ap
parently Americans feel it is worthwhile to halt the spread of
Communism, hut most of them are too lazy to fight it in a
moral, permanently effective way. It is easier to kill a Commu
nist than it is to convince him that Capitalism and individualism
are preferable. One need resort to arms to stop a tyrannical ide
ology only when he no longer believes so strongly in the superi
ority of his own ideology as to think others will choose it over
tyranny. When he becomes convinced that his system can only
be maintained by force against external and internal stresses,
he admits that his ideology is no more attractive than others and
resorts to tyranny himself to maintain his stronghold.
There are of course many variations of pacifism, and the
pacifist never faces easy, cut and dried decisions. Yet pacifism,
by the moral nature of its basis, can never be outmoded any
more than morality. No self-respecting, dedicated pacifist can
ever accept homicide as a satisfactory solution to man’s prob
lems. Indeed, history teaches him that claiming war can right
wrongs, end wars, or destroy ideologies is fallicious, even ana
chronistic.

Since the “Birmingham Rally” was by declaration and in
tent not a symposium—we were called there to emote, morally

ing and its subject in a different context. Apparently we Ameri
cans have to get together periodically to massage each other’s
conscience and rejuvenate our sensitivity to injustice. Certainly
the immediacy of the Birmingham crisis made the meeting
appropriate.
But it is somewhat tragic that we remain relatively unim
pressed and uninformed until the quantity of justice becomes
overwhelming. Conditions in Birmingham, particularly since the
Supreme Court Decision in 1954, have been amply documented.
Connor’s callous treatment of Negroes, the use of police dogs,
intimidation, violence, unsolved racial crimes, etc. have been an
integral life of that city for sometime—and so reported. Why
an expression of horror and indignation must await glaring
headlines is understandable but also disquieting.
It is obvious that Martin Luther King’s dramatic and ef
fective leadership has been invaluable to the cause of desegre
gation. Certainly the segregation pattern in Birmingham could
not have been visibly broken without some kind of mass demon
stration. but the ultimate responsibility for the improvement of
race relations devolves on those in the city who care—still a
pitifully small number of whites. Those few have been active in
the Alabama Council on Human Relations, a biracial organiza
tion. Because they have been active, they have been subjected
to intense economic and social pressure and to physical threats.
Their efforts have gone unpublicized (except by segregation

Under the sponsorship of the Foreign Students Association,
the foreign students from many lands have joined their U.S. col
leagues to form the Stanford University Cricket Club and have
entered a team to play in the League Cup Competition of the
California Cricket Association. I need not say how pleased the
league officials are at this entry of a very enthusiastic new team
consisting of 36 members and all fine gentlemen from lands as
far away as India, Hongkong, Ceylon, Australia, England and,
of course, from Canada and the United States.
Last Sunday, in a game against the Golden Gate Cricket
Club of Berkeley, a most extraordinary and distressing incident
occurred. The game was being played on the Intramural Field
at Stanford and shortly prior to its conclusion the groundsman
announced in very rude tones that everybody was to get off the
field because it was 5:30 p.m. or he was going to get the police
to throw everybody out. It appears on further inquiry that he
wanted to close the “gate” on the road leading to the Intramural
Field. This act of closing the gale consists of drawing a chain
across the road and locking a lock. It is most surprising that the
campus police could not be entrusted to do this simple chore after
the game is finished or alternate arrangements made to secure
the grounds as required by the University authorities. It is
rather absurd to require that the grounds be vacated by 5:30
p.m. when daylight lasts until 8 p.m. I should point out further

Under the sponsorship of the Foreign Students Association,
the foreign students from many lands have joined their U.S. col
leagues to form the Stanford University Cricket Club and have
entered a team to play in the League Cup Competition of the
California Cricket Association. I need not say how pleased the
league officials are at this entry of a very enthusiastic new team
consisting of 36 members and all fine gentlemen from lands as
far away as India, Hongkong, Ceylon, Australia, England and,
of course, from Canada and the United States.
Last Sunday, in a game against the Golden Gate Cricket
Club of Berkeley, a most extraordinary and distressing incident
occurred. The game was being played on the Intramural Field
at Stanford and shortly prior to its conclusion the groundsman
announced in very rude tones that everybody was to get off the
field because it was 5:30 p.m. or he was going to get the police
to throw everybody out. It appears on further inquiry that he
wanted to close the “gate” on the road leading to the Intramural
Field. This act of closing the gale consists of drawing a chain
across the road and locking a lock. It is most surprising that the
campus police could not be entrusted to do this simple chore after
the game is finished or alternate arrangements made to secure
the grounds as required by the University authorities. It is
rather absurd to require that the grounds be vacated by 5:30
p.m. when daylight lasts until 8 p.m. I should point out further
that no such restrictions are put on any of the other 6 teams in
the league who play on school grounds or public playing fields
such as the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.
It is to be hoped that Stanford University authorities will do
everything in their power to ensure that our guests from foreign
lands are free and welcome to play the games of their choice
without unnecessary and irritating restrictions. As an American.
I was ashamed to note the manner in which a petty official of
the University behaved in a high and mighty manner, indeed a
personification of “The Ugly American at Home.” hardly a good
impression of American hospitality which these students might
take back with them to their home lands.

Last Wednesday Mr. Naegeli of the Conservative Caucus
wrote that Pacifism is anachronistic and “irrelevant.” I don’t
think Mr. Naegeli knows what Pacifism is. At least he does not
know what freedom is—his article shows that. He writes that
pacifists “demand that we ignore the threat to freedom while
we try to avoid war.” But everybody knows—everybody except
the members of the Conservative Caucus—that the soldier is
the least free of all men, for to be a good soldier he must submit
his mind to those in authority over him. If Mr. Naegeli knew
what freedom is he would know that nothing, no one, literally
nothing and no one, can take freedom away, for freedom, after
all, is not freedom of action but freedom of thought, and the
only way we can lose that freedom is by giving it up.
I think Mr. Naegeli is afraid, and I think the thing he is
afraid of is death—not his ow’n death only, but the physical
death of mankind. To a certain extent Pacifism is afraid of the
same thing, and to the extent that it concerns itself with life
and death it is irrelevant, though not anachronistic. A free man
does not fear death, and he does not fear his nation's enemy—
these are the irrelevant things.
I can paraphrase too. I can paraphrase Seneca and say that
Mr. Naegeli, and those that think as Mr. Naegeli thinks, do not
care about freedom, but only how long mankind (with the
possible exception of the pacifists) lives, though it is within the
reach of every man to be free, and less and less within the power
of mankind to decide the length of its existence.

Editors, The Daily:
Wednesday, May 8, Bruce Naegeli, chairman of the Con
servative Caucus, charged that pacifism is an anachronism
today. Although I do not run with the bearded, barefoot peace
mongers, I am obliged to reply because of my own stand of
Christian-paciflsm.
Mr. Naegeli’s article reveals a misunderstanding of pacifism
and its basic nature. At the very heart of pacifism, religious or
secular, lies the moral decision that homicide is wrong, whether
it be a result of individual action or massive organization. De
spite the flurry of propaganda, a true pacifist can never be con
vinced that the whims of either his government or of any gov
ernment antagonistic to him can justify his committing this
basic wrong. Mr Naegeli makes the gross error of identifying
isolationism with pacifism. The Isolationists with their cries of
“No more foreign wars!” and “No more American boys
killed!” were concerned for no country but the United States and
were prompted merely by fear, not a moral belief. The pacifist
has always been an internationalist, equally concerned for the
fate of a Japanese boy invading China as for an American de
fending France. Furthermore, he never seeks to protect his life
with his stand as did the isolationists; on the contrary, he is
vyilling to forfeit life should the price of maintaining his convic
tions ever be so high.
Mr. Naegeli finds it alltoocasy to generalize about the conflict
between the Allies and the Axis of World War 11, and about the
current Western-Communist conflict. He should be reminded
that “rule by divine rignt” was hardly any less a philosophy or
doctrine of tyranny than have been Fascism and Communism.
Furthermore, Fascists and Communists have been hardly any
more expansion minded, “for its own sake,” than were Napoleon,
or Great Britain in the era of the “white man’s burden.”
It is not war that stops an ideology. Contrary to Mr. Nae
geli’s suggestion. Fascism will be destroyed when intelligent
people are no longer willing to accept it. World War II destroyed
the Fascist great powers, not Fascism. To destroy an ideology
one must meet it on the common ground of the intellect and
defeat it. Suppressing it can never be a permanent solution. Ap
parently Americans feel it is worthwhile to halt the spread of
Communism, hut most of them are too lazy to fight it in a
moral, permanently effective way. It is easier to kill a Commu
nist than it is to convince him that Capitalism and individualism
are preferable. One need resort to arms to stop a tyrannical ide
ology only when he no longer believes so strongly in the superi
ority of his own ideology as to think others will choose it over
tyranny. When he becomes convinced that his system can only
be maintained by force against external and internal stresses,
he admits that his ideology is no more attractive than others and
resorts to tyranny himself to maintain his stronghold.
There are of course many variations of pacifism, and the
pacifist never faces easy, cut and dried decisions. Yet pacifism,
by the moral nature of its basis, can never be outmoded any
more than morality. No self-respecting, dedicated pacifist can
ever accept homicide as a satisfactory solution to man’s prob
lems. Indeed, history teaches him that claiming war can right
wrongs, end wars, or destroy ideologies is fallicious, even ana
chronistic.

ernment antagonistic to him can justify his committing this
basic wrong. Mr Naegeli makes the gross error of identifying
isolationism with pacifism. The Isolationists with their cries of
“No more foreign wars!” and “No more American boys
killed!” were concerned for no country but the United States and
were prompted merely by fear, not a moral belief. The pacifist
has always been an internationalist, equally concerned for the
fate of a Japanese boy invading China as for an American de
fending France. Furthermore, he never seeks to protect his life
with his stand as did the isolationists; on the contrary, he is
vyilling to forfeit life should the price of maintaining his convic
tions ever be so high.
Mr. Naegeli finds it alltoocasy to generalize about the conflict
between the Allies and the Axis of World War 11, and about the
current Western-Communist conflict. He should be reminded
that “rule by divine rignt” was hardly any less a philosophy or
doctrine of tyranny than have been Fascism and Communism.
Furthermore, Fascists and Communists have been hardly any
more expansion minded, “for its own sake,” than were Napoleon,
or Great Britain in the era of the “white man’s burden.”
It is not war that stops an ideology. Contrary to Mr. Nae
geli’s suggestion. Fascism will be destroyed when intelligent
people are no longer willing to accept it. World War II destroyed
the Fascist great powers, not Fascism. To destroy an ideology
one must meet it on the common ground of the intellect and
defeat it. Suppressing it can never be a permanent solution. Ap
parently Americans feel it is worthwhile to halt the spread of
Communism, hut most of them are too lazy to fight it in a
moral, permanently effective way. It is easier to kill a Commu
nist than it is to convince him that Capitalism and individualism
are preferable. One need resort to arms to stop a tyrannical ide
ology only when he no longer believes so strongly in the superi
ority of his own ideology as to think others will choose it over
tyranny. When he becomes convinced that his system can only
be maintained by force against external and internal stresses,
he admits that his ideology is no more attractive than others and
resorts to tyranny himself to maintain his stronghold.
There are of course many variations of pacifism, and the
pacifist never faces easy, cut and dried decisions. Yet pacifism,
by the moral nature of its basis, can never be outmoded any
more than morality. No self-respecting, dedicated pacifist can
ever accept homicide as a satisfactory solution to man’s prob

wrongs, end wars, or destroy ideologies is fallicious, even ana

Under the sponsorship of the Foreign Students Association,
the foreign students from many lands have joined their U.S. col
leagues to form the Stanford University Cricket Club and have
entered a team to play in the League Cup Competition of the
California Cricket Association. I need not say how pleased the
league officials are at this entry of a very enthusiastic new team
consisting of 36 members and all fine gentlemen from lands as
far away as India, Hongkong, Ceylon, Australia, England and,
of course, from Canada and the United States.
Last Sunday, in a game against the Golden Gate Cricket
Club of Berkeley, a most extraordinary and distressing incident
occurred. The game was being played on the Intramural Field
at Stanford and shortly prior to its conclusion the groundsman
announced in very rude tones that everybody was to get off the
field because it was 5:30 p.m. or he was going to get the police
to throw everybody out. It appears on further inquiry that he
wanted to close the “gate” on the road leading to the Intramural
Field. This act of closing the gale consists of drawing a chain
across the road and locking a lock. It is most surprising that the
campus police could not be entrusted to do this simple chore after
the game is finished or alternate arrangements made to secure
the grounds as required by the University authorities. It is
rather absurd to require that the grounds be vacated by 5:30
p.m. when daylight lasts until 8 p.m. I should point out further
that no such restrictions are put on any of the other 6 teams in
the league who play on school grounds or public playing fields
such as the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.
It is to be hoped that Stanford University authorities will do
everything in their power to ensure that our guests from foreign
lands are free and welcome to play the games of their choice
without unnecessary and irritating restrictions. As an American.
I was ashamed to note the manner in which a petty official of
the University behaved in a high and mighty manner, indeed a
personification of “The Ugly American at Home.” hardly a good
impression of American hospitality which these students might
take back with them to their home lands.

Last Wednesday Mr. Naegeli of the Conservative Caucus
wrote that Pacifism is anachronistic and “irrelevant.” I don’t
think Mr. Naegeli knows what Pacifism is. At least he does not
know what freedom is—his article shows that. He writes that
pacifists “demand that we ignore the threat to freedom while
we try to avoid war.” But everybody knows—everybody except
the members of the Conservative Caucus—that the soldier is
the least free of all men, for to be a good soldier he must submit
his mind to those in authority over him. If Mr. Naegeli knew
what freedom is he would know that nothing, no one, literally
nothing and no one, can take freedom away, for freedom, after
all, is not freedom of action but freedom of thought, and the
only way we can lose that freedom is by giving it up.
I think Mr. Naegeli is afraid, and I think the thing he is
afraid of is death—not his ow’n death only, but the physical
death of mankind. To a certain extent Pacifism is afraid of the
same thing, and to the extent that it concerns itself with life
and death it is irrelevant, though not anachronistic. A free man
does not fear death, and he does not fear his nation's enemy—
these are the irrelevant things.
I can paraphrase too. I can paraphrase Seneca and say that
Mr. Naegeli, and those that think as Mr. Naegeli thinks, do not
care about freedom, but only how long mankind (with the
possible exception of the pacifists) lives, though it is within the
reach of every man to be free, and less and less within the power
of mankind to decide the length of its existence.

Wednesday, May 8, Bruce Naegeli, chairman of the Con

Christian-paciflsm.
Mr. Naegeli’s article reveals a misunderstanding of pacifism
and its basic nature. At the very heart of pacifism, religious or
secular, lies the moral decision that homicide is wrong, whether
it be a result of individual action or massive organization. De

without unnecessary and irritating restrictions. As an American.
I was ashamed to note the manner in which a petty official of
the University behaved in a high and mighty manner, indeed a
personification of “The Ugly American at Home.” hardly a good
impression of American hospitality which these students might
take back with them to their home lands.

Editors, The Daily:
Last Wednesday Mr. Naegeli of the Conservative Caucus
wrote that Pacifism is anachronistic and “irrelevant.” I don’t
think Mr. Naegeli knows what Pacifism is. At least he does not
know what freedom is—his article shows that. He writes that
pacifists “demand that we ignore the threat to freedom while
we try to avoid war.” But everybody knows—everybody except
the members of the Conservative Caucus—that the soldier is
the least free of all men, for to be a good soldier he must submit
his mind to those in authority over him. If Mr. Naegeli knew
what freedom is he would know that nothing, no one, literally
nothing and no one, can take freedom away, for freedom, after
all, is not freedom of action but freedom of thought, and the
only way we can lose that freedom is by giving it up.
I think Mr. Naegeli is afraid, and I think the thing he is
afraid of is death—not his ow’n death only, but the physical
death of mankind. To a certain extent Pacifism is afraid of the
same thing, and to the extent that it concerns itself with life
and death it is irrelevant, though not anachronistic. A free man
does not fear death, and he does not fear his nation's enemy—
these are the irrelevant things.
I can paraphrase too. I can paraphrase Seneca and say that
Mr. Naegeli, and those that think as Mr. Naegeli thinks, do not
care about freedom, but only how long mankind (with the
possible exception of the pacifists) lives, though it is within the
reach of every man to be free, and less and less within the power
of mankind to decide the length of its existence.
