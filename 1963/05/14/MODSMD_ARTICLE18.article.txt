# Cards Club San Jose, Cal; Win AAWU Match Title
## 
### DAVE NYBEBG 
The Stanford golf team cinched
the AAWU dual match champion
ship by overwhelming California
25-2 on the Stanford course last

Saturday.
The bigger thrill for the Indi
ans came on Friday, however, as
they shot their way past San Jose
State, the only team to beat the
Cards in dual match competition
in the past 38 matches. Stanford
scored 16*2 points to San Jose’s
10 1 a. In the featured individual
match of the afternoon, Peter
Choate had to come from 4
strokes behind on the back nine
to underscore the Spartan’s John
Lotz 73-75. The duo of Choate and
Rheim picked up six points to
their Spartan partners’ 3, while
Ireland and Cotton took TVs
points in their rounds.
CHOATE WAS low man in the
Cal meet with a fine 71. Ireland
with a 72 was close behind, and
Rheim and Ralph Marron with
74’s also out-shot the Bears’ low
man—Newsome, who had a 75.
There was never much question
in the match as only one Bear
picked up a whole point, and the
number one and two men earned
but half a point each.
The freshmen drew a ISli-lS'i
tie with the San Jose Frosh (who
are, by the way, one of the best
freshman teams in the stale), and
then came back with a IGVs-lOVs
win over California on Saturday.
This coming weekend, Stanford
will host the AAWU champion
ships in a two-day, 72-hole tour
nament, Choate is the defending
individual champ, and the Tro
jans of USC were last year’s win
ning team.
