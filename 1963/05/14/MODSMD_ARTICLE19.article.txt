# Broncos Threaten Card Title Hopes
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Jim Lonborg, Stanford’s most
likely All-CIBA prospect, will be
pitching this afternoon as Stan
ford tries to stay in mathematical
contention in the tightest CIBA
race in years.
Lonborg, who was victimized

by nine Stanford errors in his
most recent outing and was
backed by only thre hits, will be
aiming for his fifth league win
against two losses, and his third
straight win over the Broncos. He
has allowed them only six hits in
two complete games.

Stanford is now 7-6 in the CIBA,
with only three games to go. USC
is on top at 9-3. The Broncos are
still in mathematical contention
with the same record as Stanford
and two games to play against
USC.
Santa Clara will probably
counter Lonborg with sophomore
Nelson Briles, who was treated
rather roughly by (he Indians in
his only appearance against them
this yeai'. The Indians belted him
for seven hits in 3 2 , i innings.
Another possibility is Charlie
Marcenero, who has won once
and lost twice to Stanford. He re
lieved Briles to pick up the
Broncs’ only win against the
Tribe, and he lost two games to
Lonborg.
Others in the Santa Clara line
up are first baseman John Bocca
bclla, second team All-America
last year, who helped beat Stan
ford with a pair of homers earlier
in the season, shortstop Gary
Malvini, who hits well in friendly
Buck Shaw Stadium but does
poorly on the road, and third
baseman Tim Cullen, leading hit
ter in the league in 1962, but who
has performed wretchedly both at
bat and in the field in 1963.
Coach Dutch Fehring hopes his
other starting players do better
in the field than they did in Los
Angeles over the weekend. The
Cards made 16 errors in the two
games.
Either Chuck French or Jim
Seckler will open at catcher. The
infield will be Bob Hollmann, first
base; George Thacher, second
base; Joel Shulman, shortstop;
and Gary Smith, third base. The
outfield will consist of Bob Cox,
Greg Post, and Warren Newell.


THE SUNKEN DIAMOND, an unfamilar structure to most Stanford
students, judging from the season's attendance, will be the sight
of today's elfish between Stanford and Santa Clara. The park has
even seen crowds numbering more than 20 spectators on occasion
this year.
