# Frosh Lose to Roosevelt High
## 
### 
Last week the frosh baseball
j team played one game, but had
two rained out. On Saturday, the
team lost to Roosevelt High, pos
| sibly the strongest high school
j squad in the Bay Area. 10-6, after
j Friday’s scheduled double-header
jwith USF had been rained out.
t The frosh were neither alert
j nor lucky against Roosevelt.
Their pitchers had poor control
and were otherwise ineffective,
! walking 9, giving up 10 hits, hit
[ ting two of the opposing bats
men, and allowing five runs to
score in the ninth. The hitting
j and fielding also bordered on the
j lackadaisical.
j STAR CATCHKR Jimmy Hihbs’
bat was the lone encouragement
i of the day. He got a double and a
j triple, driving in three. Hihbs now
| leads the team with a .421 aver
age and 18 RBI’s for twelve
I games.

Coach Ray Young cited the
squad’s inability to come through
in the clutch, to make the big
play which stops an enemy rally
or perpetuates a big inning for
Stanford, and their continued
commission of mental errors as
opposed to fielding miseries, as
the causes of the frosh’s record of
late (12-5 after winning the first
five in a row).
The freshmen close their sea
son this week with an away
game against Santa Clara today
and a home weekend game with
Await High of Fremont.
