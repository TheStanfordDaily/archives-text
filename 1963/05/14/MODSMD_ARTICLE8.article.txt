# Adverse Effects of Drug Studied by Med School
## 
### Hy RON DE FELICE 
Dr. John P. Bunker of the Stan
ford University School of Medi
cine has been named to head a
nationwide investigation into the
possible dangerous effects of the
widely used anesthetic hdlothane.
Recent reports have caused
concern (hat halothane, marketed
under the name “Fluothane,”
may harm the liver and some
times cause death. The first of
such reports appeared a short
while ago in the “New England j
Journal of Medicine.” Dr. Bunk
er, professor and executive head (
of the Department of Anesthesia i
at Stanford, was co-author of one j
of the reports.
DOCTORS SUSPECT that ha
lothane has caused ten deaths.
Although this number is small
compared with the number of
patients who have had the drug
during surgery—an estimated six
million Americans Dr. Bunker
said that many deaths caused by
halothane may have gone unre
ported. On the other hand, the
present evidence is not suffici
ently clear to indicate whether
halothane caused the deaths re
ported or whether other factors
were to blame.
|
The purpose of the investiga-1
tion is to ascertain whether halo-1
thane was, in fact, responsible
( for these deaths. The Committee |
[ on Anesthesia of the National !
I Research Council, of which Dr. j
i Bunker is chairman, will direct j
the study.
j Data collected under carefully j
(controlled conditions will be as-i
jscmbled at Stanford. Computers)
'in the University’s Computation)

| Center will summarize and ana
-1 lyze the information.
“THE IMPORTANCE of this
kind of approach in studying the
effects of drugs,” Dr. Bunker
1 said, “has become increasingly
apparent to the medical profes
sion and the public with the enor
mous number of new drugs and
the appearance of unsuspected
side effects from the use of such
| agents as thalidomide, the oral
I contraceptives and the polls vac
cines.”
| Plans for the study call for 50,-
j 000 to 75,000 patients to be in
! volved during a two-year period.
I Half the patients will receive ha
jlothane; half, another commonly
; used drug. All will be examined
for possible liver damage. If sig
nificant differences in the death
rate due to liver damage show up
between the two groups, doctors
will pursue the investigation to
exclude the possibility that other
drugs or infectious diseases
1 might be responsible for the liver
damage.
Half of all patients receiving
general anesthesia now receive
halothane. Because of its quick
effectiveness and complete resist
lance to explosion, halothane has
j been a favorite anesthetic since
I its introduction in 1956.
Dr. Bunker said that the possi
bility of liver damage is not
j enough of a hazard to justify
I halting the use of the anesthetic
j until completion of the studies
But should a cause-and-effeet re
lationship become apparent be
j tween halothane and liver disease,
i physicians will probably cease
(giving halothane to patients with
j histories of liver trouble.
