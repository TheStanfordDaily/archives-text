HOW TO SEE EUROPE
FOR ONLY $3OO A DAY: NO. 2
Last week wo discussed England, the first stop on the tour of
Europe that every American college student is going to make
this summer. Today we will take up your next stop—France,
or the Pearl of the Pacific, as it is generally called.
To get from England to France, one greases one’s body and
swims (he English Channel. Similarly, to get from Franco to
Spain, one greases one’s body and slides down the Pyrenees.
And, of course, to get from France to Switzerland, one greases
one s body and wriggles through the Simplon Tunnel. Thus, as
you can see, the most important single item to take to Europe
is a valise full of grease.
No, 1 am wrong. The most important thing to take to Europe
is a valise full of Marlboro Cigarettes—or at least as many as
Jr
\t itifrocfuttJ ‘flicri&
the customs regulations will allow. And if by chance you should
run out of Marlboros in Europe, do not despair. That familiar
red and white Marlboro package is as omnipresent in Europe
a> it is in all fifty of the United States. And it is the same
superb cigarette you find at home—the same pure white filter,
the same zestful, mellow blend of tobaccos preceding the filter.
This gem of the tobacconist's art, this prodigy of cigarette
engineering, was achieved by Marlboro’s well-known research
team Fred Soft pack and Walter Fliptop—and 1, for one, am
grateful.
Hut I digress. Wo were speaking of France—or the Serpent of
the Nile, as it is popularly termed.
Let us first briefly sum up the history of France. The nation
was discovered in 1060 by Madame Guillotine. There followed
a series of costly wars with Schleswig-Holstein, the Cleveland
Indians, and Jean Jacques Rousseau. Stability finally came to
this troubled land with the coronation of Marshal Foch, who
married Lorraine Alsace and had three children: Flopsy, Mopsy,
and Charlemagne. This later became known as the Petit Trianon.
Marshal Foch—or the Hoy Orator of the Platte, as he was
affectionately called—was succeeded by Napoleon, who intro
duced shortness to France. Until Napoleon the French were
the tallest nation in Europe. After Napoleon most Frenchmen
were able to walk comfortably under card tables. This later
became known as the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
Napoleon, after his defeat by Credit Mobilier, was exiled to
Elba, where he made the famous statement, "Able was I ere I
saw Elba.” This sentence reads the same whether you spell it
forward or backward. Abu can also spell Marlboro backward
Oroblram. Do not, however, try to smoke Marlboro backward
because that undoes all the pleasure of the finest cigarette made.
After Napoleon’s death the French people fell into a great fit
of melancholy, known as the Louisiana Purchase. For over a
century everyone sat around moping and refusing his food.
This torpor was not lifted until Eiffel built his famous tower,
which made everybody giggle so hard that today France is the
gayest country in Europe.
Each night the colorful natives gather at sidewalk cafes and
shout "00-la-la!" as Maurice Chevalier promenades down (he
Champs Elysees swinging his malacca cane. Then, tired but
happy, everyone goes to the Louvre for bowls of onion soup.
The principal industry of France is cashing travellers checks.
Well sir, I guess that's all you need to know about France.
Next week wc will visit the Land of the Midnight Sun Spain.

the customs regulations will allow. And if by chance you should
run out of Marlboros in Europe, do not despair. That familiar
red and white Marlboro package is as omnipresent in Europe
a> it is in all fifty of the United States. And it is the same
superb cigarette you find at home—the same pure white filter,
the same zestful, mellow blend of tobaccos preceding the filter.

engineering, was achieved by Marlboro’s well-known research
team Fred Soft pack and Walter Fliptop—and 1, for one, am

Hut I digress. Wo were speaking of France—or the Serpent of
the Nile, as it is popularly termed.
Let us first briefly sum up the history of France. The nation
was discovered in 1060 by Madame Guillotine. There followed
a series of costly wars with Schleswig-Holstein, the Cleveland
Indians, and Jean Jacques Rousseau. Stability finally came to
this troubled land with the coronation of Marshal Foch, who
married Lorraine Alsace and had three children: Flopsy, Mopsy,
and Charlemagne. This later became known as the Petit Trianon.
Marshal Foch—or the Hoy Orator of the Platte, as he was
affectionately called—was succeeded by Napoleon, who intro
duced shortness to France. Until Napoleon the French were
the tallest nation in Europe. After Napoleon most Frenchmen
were able to walk comfortably under card tables. This later
became known as the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
Napoleon, after his defeat by Credit Mobilier, was exiled to
Elba, where he made the famous statement, "Able was I ere I
saw Elba.” This sentence reads the same whether you spell it
forward or backward. Abu can also spell Marlboro backward
Oroblram. Do not, however, try to smoke Marlboro backward
because that undoes all the pleasure of the finest cigarette made.
After Napoleon’s death the French people fell into a great fit
of melancholy, known as the Louisiana Purchase. For over a
century everyone sat around moping and refusing his food.
This torpor was not lifted until Eiffel built his famous tower,
which made everybody giggle so hard that today France is the
gayest country in Europe.
Each night the colorful natives gather at sidewalk cafes and
shout "00-la-la!" as Maurice Chevalier promenades down (he
Champs Elysees swinging his malacca cane. Then, tired but
happy, everyone goes to the Louvre for bowls of onion soup.
The principal industry of France is cashing travellers checks.
Well sir, I guess that's all you need to know about France.
