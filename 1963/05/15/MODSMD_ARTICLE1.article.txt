# Critic Kronenberger Recalls Most Exciting Opening Nights
## 
### FOSTER HIRSCH 
Louis Kronenberger, former drama critic for "Time" Magazine,
lias been in attendance at almost two thousand opening nights.
In a Tuesday Evening Series lecture last night, he reminisced
about his experiences on these occasions, defined the basic role of
the critic and discussed the state of the American theatre and

playwright of today. Kronenbcr
ger is visiting professor in Hu
manities and English this year at
Stanford.

Kronenberger mentioned that
there is often more entertainment
and drama before the curtain
goes up than after the play starts.
He described opening nights as a
“procession of strut! ings and
prancing,” a collection of inter
nationally famous people'.
On the other hand, opening
nights are not always glamorous
but are sometimes “silly, vulgar,
even unendurable.” Yet the audi
ences are “theatrically aware”
and, when deserved, offer “appre
ciative applause.”
TOO, “KEYED-UP actors” of
ten give their best performances.
On opening nights a star is born:
be it Julie Harris, Marlon Bran
do, or Mary Martin, or a play
wright proclaims himself, be it
Tennessee Williams, Arthur Mil
ler, or Thornton Wilder.
Kronenberger suggested that,
although individual performances
may sparkle on opening night
the best “ensemble playing” is
about three weeks after the open
ing. At this time, the company is
"at ease with the play” and the
performances have not become
"tiresome” or “mechanical.”
WHAT KRONENBERGER par
ticularly treasures about his 23
years experience as a drama crit
ic are those “magical moments”
which the theatre provides: “The
Uncle Tom’s Cabin Ballet” in
“The King and I,” the dining
room skirmish between Anne
Bancroft and Patty Duke in “The
Miracle Worker.” For perform
ances, Kronenberger singled
Laurence Olivier’s moment of
recognition in “Oedipus Rex” as
“unbeatable.” The most signifi
cant play during his career he
cited as O’Neill’s “Long Day’s
Journey into Night”: “perhaps
the one American play which we
can call ‘great.’ ”
Kronenberger said that the crit
ic has anobligation to come to a
conclusion. Most of the plays re
viewed will inevitably be a com
bination of good and bad. and
therefore the critic must tell his
readers whether or not the play,
“in spite of its faults, comes off.”
Kronenberger mentioned that a
critic is tempted to “dote on had
blays” because they offer an op
portunity to be witty. “However,”
he added, “it is more fun to re
view a play you like because the
review writes itself . . . and the
reader is with you because he
naturally wants to see a good
play.”
ALTHOUGH THE critic must
inevitably pan, Kronenberger
hopes that (he critic is for the
playwright a “tollgate and not a
terminus.” Nevertheless, Kronon
berger understands if those whom
he has panned bear grduges
against him.
“Kronenberger views with dis
appointment the compliance to
commercialism so prevalent in
contemporary theatre. There is
too much which is “needlessly
meretricious.” Similarly, “back
ers with very little taste supply
much of the money.” Another
problem is that back-stage Broad
way emphasizes the ‘commercial”
and “competitive,” and in addi
tion is “uncivilized. Behavior is
hard-fisted, petty, two-faced.”
