(Editors’ Note: The following
arc statements submitted to Tlie
Daily yesterday by candidates for
sophomore and junior class pres
ident and vice president.)
DIC K RAGSDALE
Junior Class President:
I feel that class government
performs a useful function,
though it is limited to the social
sphere. I would work for a great
er variety and number of social
events (particularly during the
winter quarter), and for better
communication and coordination
among the various groups which
sponsor social events to insure a
more balanced social calender.
JIM TORRE
Junior Class President:
Class government, separate
from LASSU, separate from the
ASSU President and Vice-Presi
dent, void of any ideas to re-or
ganize its framework to make its
potential come to bear, is ineffec
tive. To reorganize class govern
ment, even for freshmen who de
sire some meeting place, is neces
sary. Class government can be
improved and will be improved
next year.
LESLEY JANE OTT
Junior Class Vice President
Student government is only ef
fective when it has the enthusi
asm of the classes to support it.
1 found in the last two years that
each class needs a central com
mittee within the structure of
class government to reflect its
interests, and with student co
operation such a group has the
potential to organize both aca
demic and social activities.
TIM INGRAM
Sophomore Class President
I firmly believe that the con
tinuance of class government is
a challenging project which not
only can, but must be solved.
Over 650 of you signed a peti
tion which I circulated to put this
issue on the ballot. Now the de
cision is yours. I sincerely hope
that your answer will be an en
thusiastic one- -filled with inter
est, imagination, and initiative.
DON GRAY
Sophomore Class President and
Vice President
Grand promises at election
time; admissions of defeat when
these plans fail to materialize.
This has been the weakness of
the class government system:
promising more than one can pro
duce. I intend to produce four or
five class functions next year
no less, probably no more. 'Phis
year’s Sophomore government
had three dances and a hostel.
Next year’s could do the same.
Pragmatism over idealism in
class government: no more, no
j less. End of The Promise.
