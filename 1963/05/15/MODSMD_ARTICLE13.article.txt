## Birmingham and the Government 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Once again the federal government is being compelled to
intervene forcibly in (he struggle over the rights of Negroes.
As in Little Rock and in thc'University of Mississippi, and now
in Birmingham, the controlling fact which has led to the federal
intervention is the open defiance of the federal law by state
governments.
In Birmingham, a moderate and modest accommodation
was arrived at by Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall’s
successful mediation between the Negro leaders and the leading
members of the white community. But the accommodation was
denounced by the city officials who are still in office and re
ceived no support from the governor. These authorities are
morally responsible for the bombings which then led to the
rioting.
There is no hope that reason and sanity and good will can
prevail as long as the constituted authorities are opposed to
accommodation.
So the nation is defied by a state government attempting to
nullify the federal law. The United States government cannot
submit to nullification in Alabama. Even if the federal govern
ment were unprincipled enough to be willing to look the other
way, the mounting desperation of the Negro people, so brilliant
ly reported by Mr. Robert S. Bird in the New York Herald Trib
une, would make it impossible. The mentality of this generation
of Negroes is far removed from that of their ancestors, and
they are shedding very rapidly the docility of the slave mental
ity.
We must have no illusions that the Negro protest will sub
side even though the disorders in Birmingham are overcome.
There are very difficult issues ahead in Alabama. In the coming
months, there is almost certain to be a confrontation between
the state government of Alabama and the federal governments
over desegregation in the university. Probably before the open
ing of the university in June, the federal district court will hand
down an order to admit to the Huntsville branch of the univer
sity two Negro employees of the Marshall Space Center. One of
the Negroes is a mathematician and the other is an electronics
engineer. The Huntsville branch of the university was set up
in order to enable the employees of the space center to continue
their education.
That is not all. There will probably soon be a federal court
order to admit a Negro to the University of Tuscaloosa and also
a court order to desegregate the Birmingham public schools.
All this makes not only a big bag of problems, hut a dis
orderly one. In a state like Alabama, it is unreasonable to begin
the desegregation of the public schools and of the university at
the same time. The enforcement of the law of the Constitution
against segregation in public education requires a plan, a pro
gram and priorities. The hodge-podge in Alabama is due to the
fact that the enforcement of the law is not preceding according
to a national plan, but has been left almost entirely to litigation
initiated by the Negro organizations.
Governor Romney told us recently that “the big issue today
is whether excess concentration of federal power and sovereign
ty is going to destroy state, local and individual freedom and
responsibility.” That is indeed a w'orrisome issue. But Governor
Romney ought now to apply his theory to the facts in Alabama
and say what the federal government should do when the federal
law is openly defied by a state government.
He will be compelled to say, I think, that, as the ultimate
responsibility for law and order within the union is in the fed
eral government, it has a duty to use its moral influence and
its material power, which are very considerable, to promote
gradual and peaceable achievement of equal rights in public
places and in public life.
This is a solemn national commitment from which it is
impossible to turn away.

ment were unprincipled enough to be willing to look the other
way, the mounting desperation of the Negro people, so brilliant
ly reported by Mr. Robert S. Bird in the New York Herald Trib
une, would make it impossible. The mentality of this generation
of Negroes is far removed from that of their ancestors, and
they are shedding very rapidly the docility of the slave mental
ity.
We must have no illusions that the Negro protest will sub
side even though the disorders in Birmingham are overcome.
There are very difficult issues ahead in Alabama. In the coming
months, there is almost certain to be a confrontation between
the state government of Alabama and the federal governments
over desegregation in the university. Probably before the open
ing of the university in June, the federal district court will hand
down an order to admit to the Huntsville branch of the univer
sity two Negro employees of the Marshall Space Center. One of
the Negroes is a mathematician and the other is an electronics
engineer. The Huntsville branch of the university was set up
in order to enable the employees of the space center to continue
their education.
That is not all. There will probably soon be a federal court
order to admit a Negro to the University of Tuscaloosa and also
a court order to desegregate the Birmingham public schools.
All this makes not only a big bag of problems, hut a dis
orderly one. In a state like Alabama, it is unreasonable to begin
the desegregation of the public schools and of the university at
the same time. The enforcement of the law of the Constitution
against segregation in public education requires a plan, a pro
gram and priorities. The hodge-podge in Alabama is due to the
fact that the enforcement of the law is not preceding according
to a national plan, but has been left almost entirely to litigation
initiated by the Negro organizations.
Governor Romney told us recently that “the big issue today
is whether excess concentration of federal power and sovereign
ty is going to destroy state, local and individual freedom and
responsibility.” That is indeed a w'orrisome issue. But Governor
Romney ought now to apply his theory to the facts in Alabama
and say what the federal government should do when the federal
law is openly defied by a state government.
He will be compelled to say, I think, that, as the ultimate
responsibility for law and order within the union is in the fed
eral government, it has a duty to use its moral influence and
its material power, which are very considerable, to promote
gradual and peaceable achievement of equal rights in public
places and in public life.
This is a solemn national commitment from which it is
impossible to turn away.

Once again the federal government is being compelled to
intervene forcibly in (he struggle over the rights of Negroes.
As in Little Rock and in thc'University of Mississippi, and now
in Birmingham, the controlling fact which has led to the federal
intervention is the open defiance of the federal law by state
governments.
In Birmingham, a moderate and modest accommodation
was arrived at by Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall’s
successful mediation between the Negro leaders and the leading
members of the white community. But the accommodation was
denounced by the city officials who are still in office and re
ceived no support from the governor. These authorities are
morally responsible for the bombings which then led to the
rioting.
There is no hope that reason and sanity and good will can
prevail as long as the constituted authorities are opposed to
accommodation.
So the nation is defied by a state government attempting to
nullify the federal law. The United States government cannot
submit to nullification in Alabama. Even if the federal govern
ment were unprincipled enough to be willing to look the other
way, the mounting desperation of the Negro people, so brilliant
ly reported by Mr. Robert S. Bird in the New York Herald Trib
