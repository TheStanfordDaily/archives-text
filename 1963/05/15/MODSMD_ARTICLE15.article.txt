# PLAY REVIEW
## The
						Lady's Not for Burning' 
### LEE PROJECTOR 
I am now writing a play review, but it is not for everybody
to road. Furthermore, it il not even just for people who are hot
for drama, Culture, The Liberal Arts, and like that. Rather, it
is only for that slim tender group that is hot for drama, Culture,
The Liberal Arts, and like that and that does not scorn Christo
pher Fry. This cuts out countless streams of people who are
totally intolerant of his comic, cascading, stylized, brilliant,
un-twentieth century verse. His enemies call him a “second-rate
Elizabethan,” see . . . although if “The Lady’s not for Burn
ing” had been produced around IGO3 instead of around 19-19,
then today we’d probably be having Fry Festivals and conduct
ing tourists through Fry landmarks, like the Green Unicorn
tavern, Where He Socialized and Got Ideas, and His Wife’s Cot
tage, Where He Ate Breakfast, and so on.
Now that the ranks of readers are properly depleted. I will
WTite this review for the emotional remnant who welcome
Christopher Fry. “The Lady’s not for Burning” is currently
playing at the Playhouse Theatre, which is in the city at the
corner of Beach and Hyde, next to some water, which is either
the bay or the ocean, one supposes. There is a sign on the beach
that says “No Swimming Water Polluted” or something like
that and occasionally during the play cable cars make a noise
like chipmunks attacking a linotype machine—but essentially
it is a nice unurban place for putting on such a nice unurban
play as "The Lady’s not for Burning.” Christopher writes for
his appreciators with pristineness and wit and grace. In his
best spring and summer plays, language is as omniscient as God.
Language is the key to the heart, the heart is the key to love,
love is the key to language, language is the key to the heart.
If the audience doesn’t like it, it should get the hell out, and
retreat under bridges with ogres and trolls. “We have given you
a world as contradictory / As a female, as cabbalistic as the
male, / A conscienceless hermaphrodite who plays / Heaven off
against hell, hell off against heaven, / Revolving in the ballroom
of the skies / Glittering with conflict as with diamonds: / We
have wasted paradox and mystery on you / When all you ask
us for, is cause and effect!”
This production is a great success, firstly and foremostly
because it accentuates the glories of the script. Christopher is
happily married to the English tongue, and the director (whose
name is A. J. Esta) only occasionally grows jealous and at
tempts to break it up with overinventiveness. The best part of
the Playhouse’s efforts are devoted to the poetry, devoted to
playing it with verve, wit. and wonderful clarity. The director
has people flying or floating about, as the case may require,
at a pace that is liquid, in a style that is gemlike.
Libby Glenn, as Jennet Jourdemayne, the fifteenth century
lady who’s not for burning, is throaty and superb. She com
bines the fire of April with a certain quiescence that could
almost be called deep, if the play were deep, which it isn’t, of
course. Gail Chugg, as Thomas Mendip, Jennet’s virile, glib,
philosophical lover, is excellently charged and restless. A cer
tain tendency of his to somehow stereotype himself does not
emerge frequently enough to do damage. He runs the spring
gamut of emotions, from pure frivolity (“Shall we not / Suffer
as wittily as we can?”) to “a gay modulating anguish, rather
like music.” Among the other players, Rosanne Baskir, Susan
Hooper, Len Schropfer, and Robert Atkinson deserve special
mention and six beers apiece for the quality of their timing
and movement and for their apparent recognition of the very
special nature of the play they are in.
For this is where the production is to be faulted, when it is
to be faulted. Too many of the secondary atcors do not know
the name of the play in which they are appearing. Jerome Mar
kcl, as the Chaplain, thinks he is playing the title role in a play
called “My Funny Jewish Uncle.” He is hilarious; but he is
destructive of the play. Ron Anderson, as the young clerk Rich
ard, thinks he is starring in “Ah, Wilderness!” And Morgan
Upton, as drunken old man Skipps, thinks he is the Porter in
“Macbeth.” All this extracurricular nonsense is the director’s
fault, and he should be shot. Except for the fact that the main
stream of his directing and the luster of the principals still keeps
the play brilliant and pristine in the main. So maybe he should
only be wounded.
Happily, the set (by Bob Skeoch) is at once a work of art
that should be sent to some gallery for preservation in its en
tirety and an invaluable highlight of the essence of the play’s
mood. In color and space, it is probably the best design I have
seen in thirty-two years of reviewing for The Stanford Daily.
Not to mention Eunice Massie’s costumes, which integrate beau
tifully with the set and which characterize as well—a notable
achievement when cloth is so often cut and sewn for its own
sake, rather than the play’s—even, at times, in great universities.
If, then, you’ve read thus far—with sympathy, of sorts—
then I highly recommend this production, even if “I highly rec
ommend” sounds arrogant, which it does. Christopher Frey
may be regarded by many twentieth-century conductors as a
fourth-violinist or something, but he is quite likely to be dis
covered anew and glorified in tomorrow’s orchestra. If the world
does not evolve into one urban complex, filled with houses of
hate and edifices of envy, if beauty is kept apart from the
Gross National Product (“Beauty is not an Absolute. / Beauty
is a Condition.”), then there may bp space, for him., ■ ;J
Admittedly, he scarcely covers all of life; for tarpaulin
drama we go to others. In fact, for best effect you should drive
directly home from the theatre after his play. Don’t dilute it
with post-productoin dips into real life, like sweating on your
date or walking down sad, lonely, garish Market Street or any
thing like that. Driving straight home from the theatre does,
of course, presuppose that you have a car, which leads me
into my final admission: Fry, admittedly, is for the leisure
classes. He does not write of Life and Death. He writes of emo
tional Love, Wit, and other leisure activities. In his world, Life
is Love and even the mud is pink. This understood, let us appre
ciate him.
“The Lady’s not for Burning” continues at the Playhouse on
Fridays and Saturdays at 8:30.
