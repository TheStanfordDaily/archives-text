Kditors, The Daily:
Monday’s editorial concerning “Student Interest in Racial
Problems.” while commendable in its intentions is unfortunate
in its vapidity and dangerous in its inaccuracy.
Agreed, many Stanford students are concerned about racial
problems; Birmingham and Baldwin have lit some fires and
fanned others. The resulting heat is, as you say, “welcome,” hut
it must be used wisely, lest we burn the wrong things. I agree
that our concern must be transformed into action, but I fail to
grasp what you mean by “real” action; I’m not even sure that
I could recognize “unreal” action. What we need is responsible
and informed action; hopefully, the leadership for it will be
forthcoming shortly.
You do suggest, however, areas for action: eliminating dis
crimination in Palo Alto housing and Stanford fraternity mem
bership clauses, and the de facto segregation in our “immediate
vicinity” (East Palo Alto). But you go too far when you speak
of “Admissions Office favoritism.” The existence of racial dis
crimination in the first three areas is indisputable; the existence
of it in (he fourth is highly conjecturable. When you hint at
favoritism in Stanford’s admissions policies, you are propagat
ing a myth. You fail to present relevant facts and you cannot
present them, because, I believe, they are non-existent.
The presence (or absence) of Negro students here is a mat
ter that affects us most closely. I am convinced that our Ad
missions Office does not discriminate against Negroes, nor
against Jews, Catholics, or Protestants. If I am naive, then I
await enlightenment or “expose.” Why are there so few Negro
students here? Mr. Richard Comfort’s letter, on the same page
as your editorial, suggests an answer that is by far more
thoughtful and disturbing than yours; “. . . because Negroes
don’t wish to come here?” If we students wish to see more
Negroes at Stanford, then we must offer them the social atti
tudes and atmosphere in which they can live and work far
more comfortably than they now do. Changing our attitudes
perhaps this is what James Baldwin meant when he said that
each of us must answer for himself the question, “What can I
do?”
