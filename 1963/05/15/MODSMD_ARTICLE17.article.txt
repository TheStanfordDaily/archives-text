IN A TIGHT MILE relay at the Big Meet in Berkeley, second man Skip
Amos hands off to Ken Frazier, running third for Stanford. The Indians lost this event by five feet, but didn t lose too many others
as they steamrollered Cal while getting in some valuable practice
for the AAWU championships in Berkeley on May 25.
