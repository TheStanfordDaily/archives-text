## 
### 
By GLENN ALFORD
Two fielding miscues that were
scored as errors and two that
weren’t allowed three Santa Clara
runs that should never have
scored, and the Broncos boat
Stanford 3-0. Each team managed
to hit safely only three times.
The action came on Stanford’s
Sunken Diamond yesterday.
lI>I LON BORG was the losing
pitcher for the Tribe. He allowed
only three hits and two walks,
but his record dropped to 7-6 for
the season, and 4-3 in the CIBA.
Santa Clara scored its last run
in the ninth frame off reliever
Warren Newell.
Pete Magrini, a surprise start
er considering that he pitched
two tough innings against the
San Francisco Giants in Monday’s
exhibition game, allowed Stan
ford only two hits in eight-plus
innings. Reliever Nelson Briles,
the Giant-killer, gave up the
Tribe’s last safety.
SANTA CLARA got its two
runs in the sixth inning mainly
because of two bad throws.
Catcher Leo Ruth singled to open
the inning and Magrini bunted
him to second. Ken Flanagan
walked to put men on first and
second and Loren Harper went in
to run for Ruth.
John Giovanola singled to short
left field and Card left fielder
Boh Cox blooped a throw to the
plate that Harper barely heat for
(he only run the Broncos needed.
It appeared that Cox expected his
throw to be cut off and relayed
to the plate. It wasn’t and the
poor toss cost Stanford a run.
Catcher Jim Seckler’s bad
throw when Giovanola stole sec
ond allowed Flanagan to score
the second Bronco run.
The run off Newell in the ninth
was scored by Giovanola. He got
on when Joel Shulman hobbled
his grounder and threw badly to
first base. Newell threw the hall
into center field on a bunt to
send him to second base. A bunt

and a sacrifice fly plated Gio
vanola.
STANFORD threatened in the
bottom of the ninth. Shulman
opened with an infield single,
Stanford’s first hit since Cox’s
one out single l in the first inning.
When Cox walked, Bronco Coach
Paddy Cottrell brought Briles in
to pitch.
It almost was a mistake. Briles
ran up a 3-1 count on Greg Post
and then served up a fat pitch
that Post lined to short center
field. Giovanola made a remark
able running catch and lagged
second to double up Shulman.
Hollmann lined a single to left
field to put two on with two out,
but George Thacher hit a high
hopper to shortstop Gary Malvini
and the game was over.

Stanford’s first hit since Cox’s
one out single l in the first inning.
When Cox walked, Bronco Coach
Paddy Cottrell brought Briles in
to pitch.
It almost was a mistake. Briles
ran up a 3-1 count on Greg Post
and then served up a fat pitch
that Post lined to short center
field. Giovanola made a remark
able running catch and lagged
second to double up Shulman.
Hollmann lined a single to left
field to put two on with two out,
but George Thacher hit a high
hopper to shortstop Gary Malvini
and the game was over.

Two fielding miscues that were
scored as errors and two that
weren’t allowed three Santa Clara
runs that should never have
scored, and the Broncos boat
Stanford 3-0. Each team managed
to hit safely only three times.
The action came on Stanford’s
Sunken Diamond yesterday.
lI>I LON BORG was the losing
pitcher for the Tribe. He allowed
only three hits and two walks,
but his record dropped to 7-6 for
the season, and 4-3 in the CIBA.
Santa Clara scored its last run
in the ninth frame off reliever
Warren Newell.
Pete Magrini, a surprise start
er considering that he pitched
two tough innings against the
San Francisco Giants in Monday’s
exhibition game, allowed Stan
ford only two hits in eight-plus
innings. Reliever Nelson Briles,
the Giant-killer, gave up the
Tribe’s last safety.
SANTA CLARA got its two
runs in the sixth inning mainly
because of two bad throws.
Catcher Leo Ruth singled to open
the inning and Magrini bunted
him to second. Ken Flanagan
walked to put men on first and
second and Loren Harper went in
to run for Ruth.
John Giovanola singled to short
left field and Card left fielder
Boh Cox blooped a throw to the
plate that Harper barely heat for
(he only run the Broncos needed.
It appeared that Cox expected his
throw to be cut off and relayed
to the plate. It wasn’t and the
poor toss cost Stanford a run.
Catcher Jim Seckler’s bad
throw when Giovanola stole sec
ond allowed Flanagan to score
the second Bronco run.
The run off Newell in the ninth
was scored by Giovanola. He got
on when Joel Shulman hobbled
his grounder and threw badly to
first base. Newell threw the hall
into center field on a bunt to
send him to second base. A bunt

and a sacrifice fly plated Gio
vanola.
STANFORD threatened in the
bottom of the ninth. Shulman
opened with an infield single,
Stanford’s first hit since Cox’s
one out single l in the first inning.
