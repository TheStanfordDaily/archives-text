# Cricketeers Victorious

### ANDREW MA 
The sun looked on generously :
as Ihe Stanford Cricketers used
only 1 batsmen to smash the Fair
child C.C. by 8 wickets. Notching
their 3rd straight win, Stanford
has now become tin* team to heat
in the League.
A large crowd of gaily-dressed
spectators gathered in the sunny
afternoon as Stanford took the
field. Bowling with a stiff breeze
behind his back, Michael English
started things rolling by clean
howling Fairchild’s opening bat
with his third delivery, and very
quickly dismissed yet another j
when Andrew Ma dove full-length
to hold a hot glance at leg-slip.
Opening from the other end, Ma
look 2 other catches off his own
bowling for a total of 3 wickets;
and Fairchild was just about
ready to throw in the towel at
this point. But the batsmen ‘dug
in’, trying desperately to rally,
and for a while the score mount
ed steadily. A change of bowlers
broke up the stand as James Mey
nell and Sandy Birtwistle each
got their man. John Jackson ap
plied the finishing touches with
a magnificent spell, dismissing 3
men while giving up only 2 runs.
Needing 53 runs to win, Stan- j
ford’s opening bats; Birtwistle
and Captain Dhanjoo took their
time; but with only 4 runs on the
board, the former was trapped |
leg-before-wicket. Bad luck struck
English when a ball refused to [
bounce and rolled beneath his bat |
to the wicket. But Elmo Perera, I
Ihe stylish left-hander, came in to
join Dhanjoo and both settled
down to hammer the opponents
handsomely. It was delightful to
watch the captain’s hatting
rounding off to form, as he placed
his shots well and protected his
wicket with a solid defense. Per
era was simply superb, driving
powerfully and glancing expert
ly; with a classic hook to the
boundary, he took Stanford’s to
tal past the opposition. The un
broken stand yielded 49 runs, a
truly commendable effort.
The Cricketers will invade
Golden Gate Park next Sunday to
face the San Francisco C.C., one
of the stronger sides in the
League. The match starts at 12
noon.
