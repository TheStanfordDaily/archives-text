dent’s Science Advisory Commit

JOHN FROHN.MAYER, Chair
man of Stanford Today and To
morrow, said, “Unfortunately this
issue of fallout shelters on cam
pus has berm the subject of mis
understanding. Hopefully this j
panel, with questions from the
floor, will clear up the problem.”
Dean Winbigler, who called the
meeting, said this was done “in
recognition of the general inter
est in the topic generated in the
last few weeks.”
The Peace Caucus has submit
ted ten questions to the panel.
One of the questions directed at
Mr. Brandin is: “The Universi
ty’s decision reveals that the Ad
ministration does not think nu
clear was is an obsolete method
of settling international disputes,
and it also reveals that the Ad
ministration believes that real
protection against thermonuclear
war is possible. Is not war an ob
solete instrument of arbitration
and is not the only protection
against thermonuclear war uni
versal disarmament? If so. is not
the Administration guilty of
fraud and deceit in establishing
fallout shelters on the Stanford
campus?”
EACH SPEAKER will give a
short summary of the problem
and then questions will be taken
from the audience. Students wish
ing to submit questions in ad
vance may send them in writing
to the Dean of Students Office.
