# Undergrads to Resolve Issue of Class Offices
## 
### 
Sophomore and Junior class elections will ho held today and
tomorrow. All undergraduates will vote on the proposition: “Do
you favor the continuance of Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior
class government?” The voting will take place from 8:45 to 4 at
the Post Office, Engineering Corner, and the Library.

On April 25, the Legislature
passed a measure directing the
chairman of the election commit
tee to withhold the elections for
Sophomore and Junior class of
fices pending the resolution of a
proposal to abolish class govern
ment for the Freshman, Sopho
more, and Junior classes.
On May 9, after Tim Ingram,
candidate for Sophomore Class
President, had presented a 650-
signature petition to put class
government on the election ballot,
LASSU approved a referendum
enabling the student body to de
cide the issue of class govern
ment. If the student body votes
to abolish class government, the
election of the sophomore and
junior class officers will be void

and the votes will not be counted.
If it is voted to continue class
government, the votes for Sopho
more and Junior Class President
and Vice-President will be count
ed.
The candidates are: Dick Rags
dale and Jim Torre, junior class
president; Lesley Jane Ott, jun
ior class vice president; Doy Gray
and Tim Ingram, sophomore class
pi'esldent; and Don Gray, sopho
more class vice president.
