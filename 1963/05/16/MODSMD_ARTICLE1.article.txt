# Taft Attacks Kennedy Policies On Foreign, Domestic Issues
## 
### MARSHA ROOD 
“The safer course is for the United States to stand up to the
Russians, rather than backing down in fear of nuclear war,” U.S.
Congressman Robert A. Taft stated yesterday afternoon in Tre
sidder Lounge.
He said that, in issues of foreign policy, “the administration

fails to put number one emphasis
on any one problem.” He went on
to say that there was a feeling in
Latin America that we are not
taking a strong enough stand
against the communist threat in
Cuba.
TAFT SAID that the Commu
nists always choose the crisis
spots, and we merely react to
their initiative. He further stated
that we should continue the block
ade of ships to Cuba that started
at the beginning of the year and
accept the risks involved.
Asked if these “risks” involved
meant taking the chance of pre
cipitating nuclear war, he stated
that backing down to communist
threat at each incident would lead
to a world-wide conflagration.
“The risks are less because prog
ress will be made by showing the
world how we stand on crucial
issues such as Cuba.”
On the domestic scene, Taft
voiced disapproval of the policy
of deficit spending which the
President unveiled on April 20.
He said President Kennedy was
sincere in his belief that deficit
spending would keep the country
moving ahead, and only gave "lip
service” to a tax cut. A tax cut
and not deficit spending, accord
ing to Taft, would spur economic
growth.
WHEN ASKED what specific
areas in the budget could be cut,
he said that cuts could be made
“right across the board.” He
staled that, we should start at the
local level to satisfy people’s
needs, and slowly work up to the
federal government.
Taft’s political experience has
been primarily in the Ohio state
legislature where he was majori
ty leader of the House. In 1961
he was elected Congressman-at
large, from the predominately
Republican state of Ohio. His
talk was sposored by the Stan
ford Area Young Republicans in
cooperation with the Political
Union.
