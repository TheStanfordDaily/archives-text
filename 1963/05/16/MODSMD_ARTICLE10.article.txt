### PELL FENDER 
T lie Stanford Today and Tomorrow forum on fallout shelters
took place yesterday afternoon in Cubberley Auditorium in front
of a near-capacity crowd.
On the panel moderated by 11. Donald Winbigler, Dean of
Students, were Alf E. Brandin, vice president for buildings and

grounds. Lyle M. Nelson, Direc

Dr. Wolfgang Panofsky, Director
of the Stanford Linear Acceler
ator Center, and member of Pres
ident Kennedy’s Science Advisory
Committee.

policy was open to discussion.
More specifically, stated Nelson,
the Committee on University Pol
icy has discussed civil defense at
Stanford three times this year.
Brandin sketched the growth
of civil defense programs in the
United States, and said that Stan
ford, in 1961, came to the de
cision that “protection against
fallout was feasible and could be
achieved by intelligent communi
ty planning.” Government inspec
tors investigated university
grounds and decided that 18
“spaces” met the minimal fall
out protection requirement of
“100.”

WINBIGLEK announced the
“ground rules” of the panel, stat
ing that the panel would first an
swer the 18 pre-submitted ques
tions, and then answer any ques
tions from the floor.

Nelson spoke briefly, saying
that although “communications
. . . are far from perfect,” and,
“perhaps, downright nonexis
tent,” three Stanford Today and
Tomorrow forums have been held
this year, in which University

THE TRUSTEES were faced
with the decision as to whether
the spaces should be supplied,
and they decided, yes, feeling that
Stanford has a “moral obligation”
to protect its community mem
bers from disaster.

Although he did not speak for
mally, Panofsky answered the
first question as to the adequacy
and the moral repercussions of
Stanford’s fallout shelters. “I’m
not an advocate of the program.”
stated Panofsky. because of its
low effectiveness. There are 70
million such “spaces” in the coun
try, 50 million of which are un
stocked. If 100 million people
were involved in an attack, rough
ly 20-30 per cent would survive
with the help of the shelters. And
this figure, said Panofsky, is “op
timistic.”
When asked if the shelters
might give Americans a “false
sense of security,” Panofsky as
serted "the program is so essen
tially ineffective that it leads to
no false sense of security.”
WINBIGUER was asked if the
granting of Federal Defense
funds motivated the trustees’ de
cision to accept the fallout shel
ter program, to which ho an
swered, “I would be shocked if
this ever crossed the mind of any
of the trustees.”
When asked about the decision
of students who voted against
the fallout shelters at UC, Win
bigler stated that ho saw why no
such referendum could not take
place hero. On the other hand, ho
said, the Vice Chancellor at UC
had told him that the referendum
had been denied.

A student asked, “Did you feel
there would be opposition to the
establishment of fallout shel
ters?’’ Nelson replied that the
trustees did not feel there would
be such a reaction, and that if
they had, the issue would have
been considered more thoroughly.
IMMEDIATELY following, an
other student asked if the number
of fallout shelters is increased,
would they agree to submit the
issue to the community. Nelson
answered, “I’d say, speaking per
sonally. yes.’’ “We would, of
course, have to examine the pro
gram.” stated Brandin. Even un
der parental protest, continued
Brandin, “I doubt seriously
whether they (the trustees)
would change their policy.”
“What if Stanford were spend
ing its own money?” “I doubt
therc'd be any program at all,”
said Brandin. “Do you feel Har
vard, Princeton, and Yale were
irresponsible in refusing the fall
out shelter program?” asked a
student. Brandin answered, “No.”

WINBIGUER was asked if the
granting of Federal Defense

A student asked, “Did you feel
there would be opposition to the

trustees did not feel there would
be such a reaction, and that if
they had, the issue would have
been considered more thoroughly.
IMMEDIATELY following, an
other student asked if the number
of fallout shelters is increased,
would they agree to submit the
issue to the community. Nelson
answered, “I’d say, speaking per
sonally. yes.’’ “We would, of
course, have to examine the pro

der parental protest, continued
Brandin, “I doubt seriously
whether they (the trustees)
would change their policy.”
“What if Stanford were spend

therc'd be any program at all,”
said Brandin. “Do you feel Har

irresponsible in refusing the fall
