## Cooper Sets U.S. Orbit Record, NASA Hopes for All 22 Orbits 
### United Press International 
CAPE CANAVERAL. Fla.—Astronaut L. Gordon Cooper flashed
around the earth in America’s longest and smoothest space flight
last night, soaring through his 7th orbit and confidently heading for
a full 22-orbit splashdown late today. Hurtling through space with
“almost textbook perfection,” the 36-year-old Air Force major was
given a go-ahead while in the 7th orbit over the Indian Ocean to
shoot for 17, the next critical stage in his 34-hour, 575,000-mile mis
sion. The astronaut, who calmly catnapped between scientific experi
ments, seemed confident he would pass the next test and complete
the hoped-for 22 orbits. Space officials used nothing but superlatives
to describe his operations. Circling the earth at 17,546 miles an hour
in a well-nigh perfect pattern, Cooper soared into his Bth orbit exact
ly 10 hours, 24 minutes after his huge Atlas rocket roared off from
Cape Canaveral shortly after 9 a.m., EDT. Cooper became America’s
distance record spaceman when he started his seventh orbit, sur
passing the six-orbit flight of Walter M. Schirra last October.
Schirra was among the U.S. astronauts chatting with Cooper
throughout his flight.
