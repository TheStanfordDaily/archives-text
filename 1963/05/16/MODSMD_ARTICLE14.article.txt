# CAMPUS OPINION
## Vote in Class Government Elections! 
### JOHN BRYSON Sophomore Class President 
Last week a petition was circulated on campus which pro
posed that the question of the abolition of class government he
referred to the student body in an election. The ostensible pur
pose of the petition, as I understand it, was to get a more repre
sentative vote on the question of class government than the legis
lature would provide. LASSU agreed to the proposal; the elec
tion is being held now; and it is resulting in a less rather than
more representative vote. The reason for this is that relatively
few people know about the election—and even less are taking
the effort to vote. Consequently, a small group representing a
minority opinion can easily swing the election.
The four class presidents this year proposed the abolition
of the freshman, sophomore, and junior class governments in
favor of a social committee under the office of the ASSU vice
president. We have found this year, as have class presidents in
the past, that any attempt to carry class activities beyond the
realm of the social event involves overlapping into the activity
areas of other campus organizations. I haw yet to see any con
crete suggestions for class government activities, other than
social events, which would not encounter this difficulty. With
all four class governments, then, concentrating exclusively on
social events, most of which are for the entire campus, there is
much duplication of effort, waste of time and money. A central
ized social committee would resolve this difficulty.
But I am writing this article less to present my opinion than
to point out that if more individuals don’t take the effort to
express their feelings, either for or against class government,
no valid decision will be reached, and the class government issue
will flounder along for a few more years just as it has for the
last few years.
