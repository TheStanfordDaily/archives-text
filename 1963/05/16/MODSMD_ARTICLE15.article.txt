# PLAY REVIEW
## 'Riders:' Essentially Monotonous' 
### LEE PROJECTOR 
“Riders to the Sea’’ is John Millington Synge’s famous trag
edy of the small world in which an old Irishwoman loses a
husband, a husband’s father, and six sons to the sea. “In the big
world the old people do be leaving things after them for their
sons and children, but in this place it is the young men do be
leaving things behind for them that do be old.’’ All are drowned
for no particular cause; all become riders to the sea.
Within the play these things happen: (he death of (he fifth
son Michael is found out from the recovery of a bit of flannel
taken off the shirt of a body found floating to the far north.
The sixth son Bartley, who was riding the Galway, is carried in
on a board. “The gray pony knocked him into the sea, and he
was washed out where there is a great surf on (he white rocks.’’
Maurya, the old woman, prays a lament. The play ends.
These things are in the play: there is the rhythm of the end
of a (small) world. “It isn’t that I haven’t said prayers in the
dark night till you wouldn’t know what Fid be saying; but it’s
a great rest I’ll have now, and it’s time surely. It’s a great rest
I’ll have now, and great sleeping in the long nights. . . .” There
is the pathos of the absence of the Lord. “Didn’t the young
priest say the Almighty God wouldn’t leave her destitute with
no son living?” There is an amazing amount of white irony—
e.g., as Maurya tells of the fourth son being brought in the door
a time ago, on a board, wrapped in a sail —the very while she
speaks, the sixth son is brought in the door the time now. on a
board, wrapped in a sail. And finally, perhaps at last only, there
is the beauty of constant death. “Michael has a clean burial in
the far north, by the grace of Almighty God. Bartley will have
a fine coffin out of the white boards, and a deep grave surely.
What more can we want than that? No man at all can be living
for ever, and we must be satisfied.”
“Riders to the Sea” was presented at Stanford last Friday
night, as part of the Studio ’63 series. It was played in a set,
designed by David Pauker, which was keen as far as it went.
There were appropriately few pieces of hard furniture and then,
dominating, a fishnet strung across the entire back wall, com
bining physical unity and obvious symbolic value. But the de
signer failed to think through his assignment completely, for
what were missing were the host of religious items that should
have been unavoidable.
And, unfortunately, the production, directed by Bruce Sal
vatore, was essentially monotonous. The director seemed to
rely on special effects—the sound of wind, a mournful female
chorus to bolster the rather mundane walk-through onstage.
If I were really bright. I would analyze the cause of the monoto
ny. I would come up with concrete suggestions for Bruce to
stomp on. But I can’t. I can only speculate. Perhaps the director
should have encouraged a greater variety in levels of intensity
instead of having everybody play throughout on an It-is-pro
foundly-windy-as-you-can-hear-from-the-sound-ef foots type of
level. Perhaps he should have sharpened extremely the divisions
in mood, instead of treating the play as one thunderclap.
Whatever the cause, the players never touched the audi
ence (“the audience” here meaning me). We just sat up here
.and watched them down there, and it was interesting, interesting
enough to pay dividends for everybody’s time and effort, inter
esting for Drama 164 c purposes, but not what John Millington
Synge wanted to do to the people who come to see his play.
