Editors, The Dally:
Understandably the Administration feels a certain obliga
tion to provide for the physical security of its population. As
suming that, shelters can he viewed as a logical extension of
fire, police and earthquake protection, a campus fallout shelter
system is clearly consistent with such a policy. Indeed, many
have assured us in these pages that this extension is sound, and
that shelters are a kind of “insurance” quite analagous to
safety belts and life boats.
Others, however, have questioned whether the shelters
really insure our security at all. The “practical” category of their
arguments disputes the efficacy of the present shelter system—
a position supported by a representative of the Administration,
Robert Beyers, who stated before the Student Congress that
Stanford’s fallout shelters would not offer protection from a
nuclear weapon detonated over- San Francisco.
Another antagonistic category, the "moral, political and
psychological” arguments, attacks the very validity of the “in
surance” analogy. In essence, they point out that insurance fails
as a means of protection if the premium itself heightens the
probability of the catastrophe; for instance, when the premium
of a fire insurance policy imposes such an oppressive economic
burden on house owners, that slum conditions and their con
comitant fire hazards develop; in such cases insurance is a
greater hazard than was the original threat of fire.
When applied to a shelter program, this reasoning would
argue that shelters harden our targets, thereby upsetting the
balance of destructive capability, in turn resulting in compensa
tory military adjustments by our enemies. Thus, escalation of
the arms race continues, prolonging the cold war and increasing
the probability of an accidental or intentional hot war.
This is a simplified view 7 of the arguments. Nevertheless,
it emphasizes the critical issue: Is a member of the Stanford
community in greater danger in a society with shelters or in a
society without shelters? No one can weigh or even begin to
compute the probabilities involved in this question. So, it is not
surprising that many patriotic and defense-minded authorities
(including the U.S. Congress which cut 85 per cent off of the
budget of the last civil defense bill) have refused to commit
themselves wholeheartedly in support of a shelter program. Nor
is it surprising that some universities have refused shelter funds
altogether (Harvard included), while the administration of at
least another (University of California) is reconsidering the
issue. Furthermore, the public also seems to have serious reser
vations about the program; none of the 41 congressmen who
polled their constituents reported a plurality favoring shelters.
If, in its self-appointed role as guardian, the Administration
was acting in good faith by fulfilling its responsibility to Stan
ford’s population and (as has been indicated to me) its obliga
tion to the parents of the students, then it only remains to say
that it might be incumbent on such a quasi-custodial adminis
tration first to establish the views of those it is protecting, or,
if these people are not qualified to judge, the views of (hose for
whom it is acting as surrogate. If the Administration has not
done or will not do this much, then even an impartial observer
might question the basis for its action.

The election of Bud VVedin as ASSU President has made
evident certain facts of Stanford political life. Political suc
cess will continue to fall to those who will nurture in students
the flattering belief that they have a right to participate in the
formulation of University policy. The Administration has never
denied that many students have ideas which could be advan
tageously incorporated into University policy. It is by virtue
of having made astute perceptions and not by mere dint of
their having chosen to come here that these students should be
admitted to the policy-making environs. Students who are al
lowed to participate, individually or en masse, are taking ad
vantage of a privilege; they are not exercising a right. The ef
forts of student government must be directed toward demon
strating an ability to assume that privilege.
There is no known relation between eagerness and percep
tive abilities or judgment.

The conservative elements have often challenged the right
or reason of Stanford students who take public stands on off
campus issues. Their statement: “How can we pretend to lend
creative criticism to outside issues before our own house Is fully
in order?” This position is more unrealistic than that which it
attacks. The world would be in sorry shape if each of us were
required to perfect ourselves before criticizing others. The flaw's
outside ourselves are always more noticeable than the flaws
within us. It is by mutual criticism and subsequent improve
ment that society is perfected. Many Stanford students are more
qualified to voice their opinions on the Birmingham issue than
they are to decide what’s good for a university.
In the press of modern life one could justifiably see little
benefit in participating in endless debate upon matters over
which he has not the slightest control and with individuals
who are already adamant in their viewpoints.
Much of the political problem here is in the name given to
our organ of free thought. It is implicitly libelous to have a con
servative majority summarily lumped with the apparently un
shakeable leftism of the “representative” ASSU Legislature.
Will a private citizen outside the campus understand that the
Stanford Student Congress is a random group of interested,
civic-minded, unsponsored students and not the index of Stan
ford student thought?

Editors, The Daily:
My first impulse was to take the article by Bruce Naegeli
of the Conservative Caucus (The Daily, May 8) for what it
purported to be; a serious discussion of pacifism. This error,
of course, caused me some bewilderment. But then I caught on.
The article was in reality a brilliant exercise of pedagogical
irony, intended to demonstrate all those elementary logical
fallacies which Mr. Naegeli knows his readers must be reminded
of from time to time. I had been duped into knowledge. And
admiration: not only had he managed to convey vividly a body
of material that generations of freshman English teachers have
struggled with so monotonously and abortively, but he had
done so in one swift stroke.
Consider, for instance, the clever non sequitur that was
worked into his basic “argument";
Since all wars prior to World War II have been the re
sult of “a continual greedy grubbing for land,” the anti
war sentiment of pre-World War II pacifists was quite
valid—even admirable. But of late there have arisen in
the world several movements dedicated to “conquest and
expansion for its (sic) own sake.” One of these, Fascism,
has been eliminated “in spite of the pacifists’ efforts”
(neat thrust. Mr. Naegeli). The other, Communism, still
confronts us. Consequently, pacifism is outmoded.
We must all applaud the skill with which Mr. Naegeli has
hidden the following wisdom beneath the lines of his lesson:
if only the Communists would give up “expansion for its own
sake” and go grubbing after land—for its sake—then pacifism
would be resurrected. It’s all a matter of motives.
But enough about non sequiturs. Notice how effectively
Mr. Naegeli forgets that other little innovation that has arisen
in the world (you know, the one that looks like a mushroom).
To have mentioned that, of course, would have been poor peda
gogy. Notice too the nice effects that are gained by identifying
pacifists with “our pre-Pearl Harbor isolationists,” by bowing
to the “nobility” of pacifists while accusing them of foolishness
(beneath the lines) and even treason (not quite beneath the
lines), by avoiding any of the valid and useful criticisms that
might have been directed at the peace movement. . . .
But why go on? Mr. Naegeli’s moral is clear: if you would
commit yourself to print, first commit yourself to thought.

The election of Bud VVedin as ASSU President has made
evident certain facts of Stanford political life. Political suc
cess will continue to fall to those who will nurture in students
the flattering belief that they have a right to participate in the
formulation of University policy. The Administration has never
denied that many students have ideas which could be advan
tageously incorporated into University policy. It is by virtue
of having made astute perceptions and not by mere dint of
their having chosen to come here that these students should be
admitted to the policy-making environs. Students who are al
lowed to participate, individually or en masse, are taking ad
vantage of a privilege; they are not exercising a right. The ef
forts of student government must be directed toward demon
strating an ability to assume that privilege.
There is no known relation between eagerness and percep
tive abilities or judgment.

The conservative elements have often challenged the right
or reason of Stanford students who take public stands on off
campus issues. Their statement: “How can we pretend to lend
creative criticism to outside issues before our own house Is fully
in order?” This position is more unrealistic than that which it
attacks. The world would be in sorry shape if each of us were
required to perfect ourselves before criticizing others. The flaw's
outside ourselves are always more noticeable than the flaws
within us. It is by mutual criticism and subsequent improve
ment that society is perfected. Many Stanford students are more
qualified to voice their opinions on the Birmingham issue than
they are to decide what’s good for a university.
In the press of modern life one could justifiably see little
benefit in participating in endless debate upon matters over
which he has not the slightest control and with individuals
who are already adamant in their viewpoints.
Much of the political problem here is in the name given to
our organ of free thought. It is implicitly libelous to have a con
servative majority summarily lumped with the apparently un
shakeable leftism of the “representative” ASSU Legislature.
Will a private citizen outside the campus understand that the
Stanford Student Congress is a random group of interested,
civic-minded, unsponsored students and not the index of Stan
ford student thought?

My first impulse was to take the article by Bruce Naegeli
of the Conservative Caucus (The Daily, May 8) for what it
purported to be; a serious discussion of pacifism. This error,
of course, caused me some bewilderment. But then I caught on.
The article was in reality a brilliant exercise of pedagogical
irony, intended to demonstrate all those elementary logical
fallacies which Mr. Naegeli knows his readers must be reminded
of from time to time. I had been duped into knowledge. And
admiration: not only had he managed to convey vividly a body
of material that generations of freshman English teachers have
struggled with so monotonously and abortively, but he had
done so in one swift stroke.
Consider, for instance, the clever non sequitur that was
worked into his basic “argument";
Since all wars prior to World War II have been the re
sult of “a continual greedy grubbing for land,” the anti
war sentiment of pre-World War II pacifists was quite
valid—even admirable. But of late there have arisen in
the world several movements dedicated to “conquest and
expansion for its (sic) own sake.” One of these, Fascism,
has been eliminated “in spite of the pacifists’ efforts”
(neat thrust. Mr. Naegeli). The other, Communism, still
confronts us. Consequently, pacifism is outmoded.
We must all applaud the skill with which Mr. Naegeli has
hidden the following wisdom beneath the lines of his lesson:
if only the Communists would give up “expansion for its own
sake” and go grubbing after land—for its sake—then pacifism
would be resurrected. It’s all a matter of motives.
But enough about non sequiturs. Notice how effectively
Mr. Naegeli forgets that other little innovation that has arisen
in the world (you know, the one that looks like a mushroom).
To have mentioned that, of course, would have been poor peda
gogy. Notice too the nice effects that are gained by identifying
pacifists with “our pre-Pearl Harbor isolationists,” by bowing
to the “nobility” of pacifists while accusing them of foolishness
(beneath the lines) and even treason (not quite beneath the
lines), by avoiding any of the valid and useful criticisms that
might have been directed at the peace movement. . . .
But why go on? Mr. Naegeli’s moral is clear: if you would
commit yourself to print, first commit yourself to thought.

Understandably the Administration feels a certain obliga
tion to provide for the physical security of its population. As
suming that, shelters can he viewed as a logical extension of
fire, police and earthquake protection, a campus fallout shelter
system is clearly consistent with such a policy. Indeed, many
have assured us in these pages that this extension is sound, and
that shelters are a kind of “insurance” quite analagous to
safety belts and life boats.
Others, however, have questioned whether the shelters
really insure our security at all. The “practical” category of their
arguments disputes the efficacy of the present shelter system—
a position supported by a representative of the Administration,
Robert Beyers, who stated before the Student Congress that
Stanford’s fallout shelters would not offer protection from a
nuclear weapon detonated over- San Francisco.
Another antagonistic category, the "moral, political and
psychological” arguments, attacks the very validity of the “in
surance” analogy. In essence, they point out that insurance fails
as a means of protection if the premium itself heightens the
probability of the catastrophe; for instance, when the premium
of a fire insurance policy imposes such an oppressive economic
burden on house owners, that slum conditions and their con
comitant fire hazards develop; in such cases insurance is a
greater hazard than was the original threat of fire.
When applied to a shelter program, this reasoning would
argue that shelters harden our targets, thereby upsetting the
balance of destructive capability, in turn resulting in compensa
tory military adjustments by our enemies. Thus, escalation of
the arms race continues, prolonging the cold war and increasing
the probability of an accidental or intentional hot war.
This is a simplified view 7 of the arguments. Nevertheless,
it emphasizes the critical issue: Is a member of the Stanford
community in greater danger in a society with shelters or in a
society without shelters? No one can weigh or even begin to
compute the probabilities involved in this question. So, it is not
surprising that many patriotic and defense-minded authorities
(including the U.S. Congress which cut 85 per cent off of the
budget of the last civil defense bill) have refused to commit
themselves wholeheartedly in support of a shelter program. Nor
is it surprising that some universities have refused shelter funds
altogether (Harvard included), while the administration of at
least another (University of California) is reconsidering the
issue. Furthermore, the public also seems to have serious reser
vations about the program; none of the 41 congressmen who
polled their constituents reported a plurality favoring shelters.
If, in its self-appointed role as guardian, the Administration
was acting in good faith by fulfilling its responsibility to Stan
ford’s population and (as has been indicated to me) its obliga
tion to the parents of the students, then it only remains to say

My first impulse was to take the article by Bruce Naegeli
of the Conservative Caucus (The Daily, May 8) for what it
purported to be; a serious discussion of pacifism. This error,
of course, caused me some bewilderment. But then I caught on.
The article was in reality a brilliant exercise of pedagogical
irony, intended to demonstrate all those elementary logical
fallacies which Mr. Naegeli knows his readers must be reminded
of from time to time. I had been duped into knowledge. And
admiration: not only had he managed to convey vividly a body
of material that generations of freshman English teachers have
struggled with so monotonously and abortively, but he had
done so in one swift stroke.
Consider, for instance, the clever non sequitur that was
worked into his basic “argument";
Since all wars prior to World War II have been the re
sult of “a continual greedy grubbing for land,” the anti
war sentiment of pre-World War II pacifists was quite
valid—even admirable. But of late there have arisen in
the world several movements dedicated to “conquest and
expansion for its (sic) own sake.” One of these, Fascism,
has been eliminated “in spite of the pacifists’ efforts”
(neat thrust. Mr. Naegeli). The other, Communism, still
confronts us. Consequently, pacifism is outmoded.
We must all applaud the skill with which Mr. Naegeli has
hidden the following wisdom beneath the lines of his lesson:
if only the Communists would give up “expansion for its own
sake” and go grubbing after land—for its sake—then pacifism
would be resurrected. It’s all a matter of motives.
But enough about non sequiturs. Notice how effectively
Mr. Naegeli forgets that other little innovation that has arisen
in the world (you know, the one that looks like a mushroom).
To have mentioned that, of course, would have been poor peda
gogy. Notice too the nice effects that are gained by identifying
pacifists with “our pre-Pearl Harbor isolationists,” by bowing
to the “nobility” of pacifists while accusing them of foolishness
(beneath the lines) and even treason (not quite beneath the
lines), by avoiding any of the valid and useful criticisms that
might have been directed at the peace movement. . . .
But why go on? Mr. Naegeli’s moral is clear: if you would
commit yourself to print, first commit yourself to thought.

Understandably the Administration feels a certain obliga
tion to provide for the physical security of its population. As
suming that, shelters can he viewed as a logical extension of
fire, police and earthquake protection, a campus fallout shelter
system is clearly consistent with such a policy. Indeed, many
have assured us in these pages that this extension is sound, and
that shelters are a kind of “insurance” quite analagous to
safety belts and life boats.
Others, however, have questioned whether the shelters
really insure our security at all. The “practical” category of their
arguments disputes the efficacy of the present shelter system—
a position supported by a representative of the Administration,
Robert Beyers, who stated before the Student Congress that
Stanford’s fallout shelters would not offer protection from a
nuclear weapon detonated over- San Francisco.
Another antagonistic category, the "moral, political and
psychological” arguments, attacks the very validity of the “in
surance” analogy. In essence, they point out that insurance fails
as a means of protection if the premium itself heightens the
probability of the catastrophe; for instance, when the premium
of a fire insurance policy imposes such an oppressive economic
burden on house owners, that slum conditions and their con
comitant fire hazards develop; in such cases insurance is a
greater hazard than was the original threat of fire.
When applied to a shelter program, this reasoning would
argue that shelters harden our targets, thereby upsetting the
balance of destructive capability, in turn resulting in compensa
tory military adjustments by our enemies. Thus, escalation of
the arms race continues, prolonging the cold war and increasing
the probability of an accidental or intentional hot war.
This is a simplified view 7 of the arguments. Nevertheless,
it emphasizes the critical issue: Is a member of the Stanford
community in greater danger in a society with shelters or in a
society without shelters? No one can weigh or even begin to
compute the probabilities involved in this question. So, it is not
surprising that many patriotic and defense-minded authorities
(including the U.S. Congress which cut 85 per cent off of the
budget of the last civil defense bill) have refused to commit
themselves wholeheartedly in support of a shelter program. Nor
is it surprising that some universities have refused shelter funds
altogether (Harvard included), while the administration of at
least another (University of California) is reconsidering the
issue. Furthermore, the public also seems to have serious reser
vations about the program; none of the 41 congressmen who
polled their constituents reported a plurality favoring shelters.
If, in its self-appointed role as guardian, the Administration
was acting in good faith by fulfilling its responsibility to Stan
ford’s population and (as has been indicated to me) its obliga
tion to the parents of the students, then it only remains to say
that it might be incumbent on such a quasi-custodial adminis
tration first to establish the views of those it is protecting, or,
if these people are not qualified to judge, the views of (hose for
whom it is acting as surrogate. If the Administration has not
done or will not do this much, then even an impartial observer
might question the basis for its action.

The election of Bud VVedin as ASSU President has made
evident certain facts of Stanford political life. Political suc
cess will continue to fall to those who will nurture in students
the flattering belief that they have a right to participate in the
formulation of University policy. The Administration has never
denied that many students have ideas which could be advan
tageously incorporated into University policy. It is by virtue
of having made astute perceptions and not by mere dint of
their having chosen to come here that these students should be
admitted to the policy-making environs. Students who are al
lowed to participate, individually or en masse, are taking ad
vantage of a privilege; they are not exercising a right. The ef
forts of student government must be directed toward demon
strating an ability to assume that privilege.
There is no known relation between eagerness and percep
tive abilities or judgment.

The conservative elements have often challenged the right
or reason of Stanford students who take public stands on off
campus issues. Their statement: “How can we pretend to lend
creative criticism to outside issues before our own house Is fully
in order?” This position is more unrealistic than that which it
attacks. The world would be in sorry shape if each of us were
required to perfect ourselves before criticizing others. The flaw's
outside ourselves are always more noticeable than the flaws
within us. It is by mutual criticism and subsequent improve
ment that society is perfected. Many Stanford students are more
qualified to voice their opinions on the Birmingham issue than
they are to decide what’s good for a university.
In the press of modern life one could justifiably see little
benefit in participating in endless debate upon matters over
which he has not the slightest control and with individuals
who are already adamant in their viewpoints.
Much of the political problem here is in the name given to
our organ of free thought. It is implicitly libelous to have a con
servative majority summarily lumped with the apparently un
shakeable leftism of the “representative” ASSU Legislature.

lines), by avoiding any of the valid and useful criticisms that
might have been directed at the peace movement. . . .
But why go on? Mr. Naegeli’s moral is clear: if you would
commit yourself to print, first commit yourself to thought.

Understandably the Administration feels a certain obliga
tion to provide for the physical security of its population. As
suming that, shelters can he viewed as a logical extension of
fire, police and earthquake protection, a campus fallout shelter
system is clearly consistent with such a policy. Indeed, many
have assured us in these pages that this extension is sound, and
that shelters are a kind of “insurance” quite analagous to
safety belts and life boats.
Others, however, have questioned whether the shelters
really insure our security at all. The “practical” category of their
arguments disputes the efficacy of the present shelter system—
a position supported by a representative of the Administration,
Robert Beyers, who stated before the Student Congress that
Stanford’s fallout shelters would not offer protection from a
nuclear weapon detonated over- San Francisco.
Another antagonistic category, the "moral, political and
psychological” arguments, attacks the very validity of the “in
surance” analogy. In essence, they point out that insurance fails
as a means of protection if the premium itself heightens the
probability of the catastrophe; for instance, when the premium
of a fire insurance policy imposes such an oppressive economic
burden on house owners, that slum conditions and their con
comitant fire hazards develop; in such cases insurance is a
greater hazard than was the original threat of fire.
When applied to a shelter program, this reasoning would
argue that shelters harden our targets, thereby upsetting the
balance of destructive capability, in turn resulting in compensa
tory military adjustments by our enemies. Thus, escalation of
the arms race continues, prolonging the cold war and increasing
the probability of an accidental or intentional hot war.
This is a simplified view 7 of the arguments. Nevertheless,
it emphasizes the critical issue: Is a member of the Stanford
community in greater danger in a society with shelters or in a
society without shelters? No one can weigh or even begin to
compute the probabilities involved in this question. So, it is not
surprising that many patriotic and defense-minded authorities
(including the U.S. Congress which cut 85 per cent off of the
budget of the last civil defense bill) have refused to commit
themselves wholeheartedly in support of a shelter program. Nor
is it surprising that some universities have refused shelter funds
altogether (Harvard included), while the administration of at
least another (University of California) is reconsidering the
issue. Furthermore, the public also seems to have serious reser
vations about the program; none of the 41 congressmen who
polled their constituents reported a plurality favoring shelters.
If, in its self-appointed role as guardian, the Administration
was acting in good faith by fulfilling its responsibility to Stan
ford’s population and (as has been indicated to me) its obliga
tion to the parents of the students, then it only remains to say
that it might be incumbent on such a quasi-custodial adminis
tration first to establish the views of those it is protecting, or,
if these people are not qualified to judge, the views of (hose for
whom it is acting as surrogate. If the Administration has not
done or will not do this much, then even an impartial observer
might question the basis for its action.

The election of Bud VVedin as ASSU President has made
evident certain facts of Stanford political life. Political suc
cess will continue to fall to those who will nurture in students
the flattering belief that they have a right to participate in the
formulation of University policy. The Administration has never
denied that many students have ideas which could be advan
tageously incorporated into University policy. It is by virtue
of having made astute perceptions and not by mere dint of
their having chosen to come here that these students should be
admitted to the policy-making environs. Students who are al
lowed to participate, individually or en masse, are taking ad
vantage of a privilege; they are not exercising a right. The ef
forts of student government must be directed toward demon
strating an ability to assume that privilege.
There is no known relation between eagerness and percep
tive abilities or judgment.

The conservative elements have often challenged the right
or reason of Stanford students who take public stands on off
campus issues. Their statement: “How can we pretend to lend
creative criticism to outside issues before our own house Is fully
in order?” This position is more unrealistic than that which it
attacks. The world would be in sorry shape if each of us were
required to perfect ourselves before criticizing others. The flaw's
outside ourselves are always more noticeable than the flaws
within us. It is by mutual criticism and subsequent improve
ment that society is perfected. Many Stanford students are more
qualified to voice their opinions on the Birmingham issue than
they are to decide what’s good for a university.
In the press of modern life one could justifiably see little
benefit in participating in endless debate upon matters over
which he has not the slightest control and with individuals
who are already adamant in their viewpoints.
Much of the political problem here is in the name given to
our organ of free thought. It is implicitly libelous to have a con
servative majority summarily lumped with the apparently un
shakeable leftism of the “representative” ASSU Legislature.
Will a private citizen outside the campus understand that the
Stanford Student Congress is a random group of interested,
civic-minded, unsponsored students and not the index of Stan
ford student thought?

Editors, The Daily:
My first impulse was to take the article by Bruce Naegeli
of the Conservative Caucus (The Daily, May 8) for what it
purported to be; a serious discussion of pacifism. This error,
of course, caused me some bewilderment. But then I caught on.
The article was in reality a brilliant exercise of pedagogical
irony, intended to demonstrate all those elementary logical
fallacies which Mr. Naegeli knows his readers must be reminded
of from time to time. I had been duped into knowledge. And
admiration: not only had he managed to convey vividly a body
of material that generations of freshman English teachers have
struggled with so monotonously and abortively, but he had
done so in one swift stroke.
Consider, for instance, the clever non sequitur that was
worked into his basic “argument";
Since all wars prior to World War II have been the re
sult of “a continual greedy grubbing for land,” the anti
war sentiment of pre-World War II pacifists was quite
valid—even admirable. But of late there have arisen in
the world several movements dedicated to “conquest and
expansion for its (sic) own sake.” One of these, Fascism,
has been eliminated “in spite of the pacifists’ efforts”
(neat thrust. Mr. Naegeli). The other, Communism, still
confronts us. Consequently, pacifism is outmoded.
We must all applaud the skill with which Mr. Naegeli has
hidden the following wisdom beneath the lines of his lesson:
if only the Communists would give up “expansion for its own
sake” and go grubbing after land—for its sake—then pacifism
would be resurrected. It’s all a matter of motives.
But enough about non sequiturs. Notice how effectively
Mr. Naegeli forgets that other little innovation that has arisen
in the world (you know, the one that looks like a mushroom).
To have mentioned that, of course, would have been poor peda
gogy. Notice too the nice effects that are gained by identifying
pacifists with “our pre-Pearl Harbor isolationists,” by bowing
to the “nobility” of pacifists while accusing them of foolishness
(beneath the lines) and even treason (not quite beneath the
lines), by avoiding any of the valid and useful criticisms that
might have been directed at the peace movement. . . .
But why go on? Mr. Naegeli’s moral is clear: if you would
