National powers USC and
UCLA figure to battle for top
honors with USC favoied, on the
basis of dual matches. The Tro
jans beat UCLA both limes that
they have met this year, 6-3 and
9-0. Tlie Trojans, who may have
the best college team of all time,

meeting of the year.

conference meet (Washington
was the only AAWU school not
entered t Cal finished third, upset
ting the Indians, mainly due to
the play of Jim McManus, the
tournament runner-up. Should
McManus again excel, the Cards
could finish fourth,
Stanford’s top players will
probably be Yoshi Minegishi,
Ron Preissman, and John Issacs.
Minegishi, the Indians’ number
one singles player, has been hav
ing his troubles this year, but in
top form he can give any of the
league’s best plenty of trouble.
Other top players entered in
the tournament include USC
stars, Dennis Ralston and Rafael
Osuna, and UCLA’s Arthur Ashe
and Charles Pasarell. Osuna is
the top Mexican player, and the
other three will almost certainly
be members of this year’s Ameri
can Davis Cup team.
