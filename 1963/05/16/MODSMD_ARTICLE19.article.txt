## Stanford Lacrosse Team Beats South All-Stars by Record Score 
### 
By Onr Lacrosse Correspondent
The Southern California La
crosse All-Stars collapsed before
a savage Indian attack last Satur
day and relinquished the North-
South Trophy until next spring’s
bout. The Red triumphed 19-4, a
score which ranks as the second
most lopsided in California la
crosse history. Last year the Ma
rines downed the All-Stars 25-2.
FOUR MINUTES after the
start of the first quarter Howie
Taylor whipped the ball into the
Cal nets on an assist from behind
the goal by All-American, Grady
Watts who scored himself un
assisted, two minutes later. As
the clock passed the 7:30 mark,
Chip Greening recovered a loose
ball in Indian defense territory
and for the first of two brilliant
runs crashed through the entire
All-Star midfield and defense to
assist Tuck Peterson for the third
goal. During the last five min
utes. McPherson, Lloyd, and van
Amerongen each scored once to
give the Red a wide 6-0 margin
at the end of the first quarter.
The Red dominated the re
mainder of the game. Freshman
stars George Peters, Parker Lle
wellyn, Tony King and Bob Mur
phy accounted for six of the 11
halftime goals. Bruce Lloyd, ex-
Yale atfackman and All-Ameri
can, displayed champion form at
the crease and led the individual
scoring with four goals.
MIDFIELDERS Verne Schul
ler, Cary Kelly, and Tom Hecht
consistently came up with the
ball and fed waves of Indian re
serves who moved on the field to

get combat experience as the
score mounted.
With three minutes to go in the
last period, freshman Bob Mur
phy charged and pivoted 50 yards
from midfield to score Stanford’s
19th goal unassisted in the
game’s most outstanding display
of slickwork and dodging.
