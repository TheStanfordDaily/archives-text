an Panorama,” a series of films
and talks presented under the
auspices of “The Bridge” to pro
vide a valuable insight into mod
ern Italy.
SICILY is often called “the
world’s most beautiful slum” by
natives. Overpopulated, poor in
natural resources, it is a sharp
contrast to prosperous and pro
gressive Northern Italy. No at
tempts at land reform were be
gun until an illegal peasant occu
pation of large estate in 1949
prodded the central government
in to action.
Dolci first visited Sicily in 1952
to study the many Greek ruins on
the beautiful island. But he stay
ed to share the ugliness of Sicili
an poverty. He married a fisher
man’s illiterate widow, settled in
a waterless, heatless shack at
Trapetto and voluntarily became
one of the Sicilian poor. Deter
mined to make the Sicilians their
own reformers, his ambition was
to restore the sense of self-re
spect and the idea of the possi
bilities of the human being to
men who have lost or never had
them.

To Italian Government officials,
his methods have always been
embarrassingly direct. In 1955,
he went on a hunger strike to
force the Sicilian local govern
ment to do something about the
poor of Trapetto. Ten days later,
his efforts won a $50,000 appro
priation for an irrigation dam
project to provide work and
water for the unemployed.
ALTHOUGH he accepted the
Lenin Peace Prize in 1958, Dolci
professes no political creed or af
filiation, “Reality is very com
plex.” he stated in his acceptance
speech, “to understand it, we
have tried Christianity, liberal
ism. Ghandiism, socialism. There
is some truth in all solutions.”
The prize money was used to es
tablish Centro Studio, an unaffili
ated program staffed by Italian
and foreign social workers and
technicians.
