### CARRIE BRAND 
Stanford University, long con
sidered the western counterpart
of the eastern Ivy Leaguers, can
finally claim for its own one of
the most enjoyable of eastern tra
ditions. the informal college sing
ing group. The Mendicants, led
by Hank Adams, a graduate stu
dent, are the first recognized
group of this kind on the West
Coast.
Singing in the college manner
made famous by such groups as
the noted Whiffenpoof Singers,
the Mendicants specialize in mod
ern arrangements of old stan
dards, although their repertory
ranges from the lilting “I Talk
to the Trees” to the humorous,
off-color “Tear It Down.” They
have sung to enthusiastic audi
ences in women’s residences and
for the alumni, and are partici
pating as an entertainment group
in the Spring Sing. They will sing
at the International Festival at
Frost Amphitheatre on May 18,
and can be heard tomorrow at the
Union for TGIF.
IX ADDITION, they plan to
appear at various restaurants and
country clubs in the area, and are
cutting a record sometime next
year. They hope to establish a
fund to finance such group ac
tivities as singing fours and a
week-long “summer rehearsal

(session” on the beaches of South
ern California. The object, ac
cording to business manager
1 Dick Grant, is to make the infor-
I mal singing group a traditional
! part of western college life, be
| ing carried on from year to year
i by members of all four classes.
Grant pointed out that the pres
ent thirteen members joined to
gether through their common
love of singing, and enjoy the op
portunity to sing in a group of
talented singers. They hope to
make the group a selfperpetuat
ing tradition, with new members
filling in for graduating seniors,
j A membership of sixteen is pre
ferred. but, Grant continued,
i there will never be more than
j twenty. This is to keep the group
j both compact and informal.
Indepedent of any Stanford de
partment, the Mendicants elect
their own director, business man
ager. and spokesman, and do
their own arranging. They sing
without accompaniment, and
every member is, at some time or
other, the soloist. Leader Adams
attributes the ability of each
' member to solo both to the high
! quality of voices and to the past
j singing experience of most of
j the members.
The Mendicants, who need , new
I members in each of the four sing
ing parts, will be holding tryouts
in several weeks.

THE MENDICANTS, a recently organized men's singing group, plan to introduce informal group
singing to the Stanford campus. This type of singing, traditional in the Ivy League, was made famous
by such groups as Yale’s Whiffenpoof Singers. The Mendicants have performed frequently this year
in the women s dorms and at alumni functions. Plans for the coming year include a concert tour and
making a record.
Stanford University, long con
sidered the western counterpart
of the eastern Ivy Leaguers, can
finally claim for its own one of
the most enjoyable of eastern tra
ditions. the informal college sing
ing group. The Mendicants, led
by Hank Adams, a graduate stu
dent, are the first recognized
group of this kind on the West
Coast.
Singing in the college manner
made famous by such groups as
the noted Whiffenpoof Singers,
the Mendicants specialize in mod
ern arrangements of old stan
dards, although their repertory
ranges from the lilting “I Talk
to the Trees” to the humorous,
off-color “Tear It Down.” They
have sung to enthusiastic audi
ences in women’s residences and
for the alumni, and are partici
pating as an entertainment group
in the Spring Sing. They will sing
at the International Festival at
Frost Amphitheatre on May 18,
and can be heard tomorrow at the
Union for TGIF.
IX ADDITION, they plan to
appear at various restaurants and
country clubs in the area, and are
cutting a record sometime next
year. They hope to establish a
fund to finance such group ac
tivities as singing fours and a
week-long “summer rehearsal

(session” on the beaches of South
ern California. The object, ac
cording to business manager
1 Dick Grant, is to make the infor-
I mal singing group a traditional
! part of western college life, be
| ing carried on from year to year
i by members of all four classes.
Grant pointed out that the pres
ent thirteen members joined to
gether through their common
love of singing, and enjoy the op
portunity to sing in a group of
talented singers. They hope to
make the group a selfperpetuat
ing tradition, with new members
