Science fiction? No, merely a

name of a “game” programmed
for the PDP-1 computer brought

is being used to demonstrate the

Science fiction? No, merely a

west of Quad. "Space War” is the
name of a “game” programmed
for the PDP-1 computer brought
to Stanford last month. The game
is being used to demonstrate the
computer's rapid int enaction

an outer space background on a
kind of television screen. The
scene can include a sun with a
calculated, operating gravitation
al field, if the participants so de
sire. The object of the game is to
disintegrate the spaceship of
your opponent by (1) hitting it
directly with a photon bomb or

(2) forcing him into the sun in
the middle of the screen.
THE ROCKETS chase each
other around the screen, starting
with a limited amount of fuel and
limited firing timed charges.
Everything is operated by hand
switches on the face of the com
puter.
Very late in the evenings, if
there are no big projects sched
uled for the computer, one may
still chance upon a small group
of technicians huddled around
the PDP-1. For as one mathema
tician put it, “Withdrawal symp
toms of Space War addicts are
quite severe, I’m told.’’
The PDP-1, which saves sever

computers, will eventually be
hooked up on direct lines to ex

in programming the PDP-1 Sat
