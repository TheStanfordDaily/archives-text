Summer’s coming, get going!
If this isn’t a great time to got yourself
a new Chevrolet—well, we just don’t
know when is. Why, you’d almost have
to be anti-summer not to let one of
these four convertibles
get to you. Or any of
Chevrolet’s sedans,
wagons, sport coupes
and sport sedans, for
that matter.
And there are a lot
of other buy-now
reasons besides the
season. Like the care
free feeling you get on
a long vacation trip in a brand-new car.
And it’s a smart time to trade, what
with your Chevrolet dealer all stocked
up for a busy summer. Chances are, he
has just the model
and color you want
—be it Chevrolet,
Chevy 11, Corvair or
Corvette—ready to go
right now.
So maybe now
you’re all wound up?
Then spring in to
summer at your
Chevrolet dealer’s.
