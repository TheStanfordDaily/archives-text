# Class Governments Rejected By Undergraduates: 491-411
## 
### ANN TODD 
Class government has all but officially ended its career at Stanfoi’d University after being
rejected by undergraduate voters, 491-411, yesterday and Wednesday. The defeat of the referendum
does not mark the actual end of class government; the vote will go to LASSU next Thursday in
the form of a suggestion, and LASSU will officially decide the issue in a roll-call vote.
Until LASSU abolishes class government, the newly elected junior and sophomoi’e officers of
ficially have positions. These officers, including Junior Class President Dick Ragsdale (winning 110-
93 over Jim Torre), Junior Class Vice President Leslie Jane Ott (winning uncontested by a vote of
137), Sophomore Class President Tim Ingram (defeating Don Gray 291-89), and Vice President Don
Gray (winning uncontested by a 289 vote), will be submited to LASSU for approval. Then, depend
ing on the final LASSU vote on class government, they either will or will not have official standing.
Senior class government will i-emain in any event.
Reactions to the referendum vote wei'e varied among the newly elected officers. Ingram, w'ho
was primarily responsible for the refei’endum being put on the ballot, expressed regret; "However,”
he said, “I’m not too surprised; I’m just sorx-y that the interest expressed by those for class govern
ment will be wasted.” Continuing, he said, “If that many approved it (411), I believe that that shows

fit’s worthwhile and has a pur
pose.”
As to the main effect this abo
lition will have on the students,
Ingram said, “It’s dangerous to
have fewer people who have pow
er behind them to speak out on is
sues concerning students. Now our
only real voice is the ASSU Presi
dent. It’s too bad we sacrificed
four officers with diversified in
terests who could speak in the
capacity of representative class
officers.”
Ragsdale feels differently about
the vote. "I don’t think anything
is really lost so long as the func
tions of class government will be
continued under some other or
ganization. A new structure will
surely take its place which will
be more effective.”
Miss Ott stated. “I’m disap
pointed because I don’t think any
alternative is prepared now
which will be adequate. I hope
that the class will have enough
interest to work out a group to
fill the void because wo need
one.”
Senior government is not being
affected by this abolition because
activities of the senior class ne
cessitate this organization afford
ed by the class government struc
ture.
