# South Pacific Production Does Ram’s Head Proud
## 
### FOSTER HIRSCH 
“South Pacific” is a simple-minded affair about some brash
American military stationed on a tropical island during World War
11. Oscar Hammerstein II and Joshua Logan’s book holds forth on
Prejudice, Different Backgrounds, and Heroism. We are encouraged
to take their schmatz seriously, and this is an impertinence. The
whole is nevertheless an endearing vehicle, in its own blundering
way, principally because of the music supplied by Richard Rodgers
and the well-meaning, if mindless, lyrics by Mr. Hammerstein. In
deed, the show is perhaps unique in having every song a winner.
Ram’s Head is certainly not to be held accountable for the book
and music, but they are responsible for the production and they do
themselves proud by it. Everyone will be grateful to Ruta Lee for
her ingratiating Nellie. Miss Lee is alert, refreshingly professional,
and altogether delightful. She vividly suggests a wide-eyed, limited
small-town American. In addition, she lines out her songs charm
ingly-
Richard Frock also does well with Emile, although, in his more
dramatic moments, ho tends to bo stiff and theatrical. Mr. Frock
offers adequate compensation for this by admirably sustaining his
accent and by his fine singing voice. His quite moving “This Nearly
Was Mine” almost stopped the show Wednesday evening.
Among the supporting cast, Myles Winbigler’s Luther Billis is
the most solidly realized characterization. He is enthusiastic and
doubtless well-intentioned, though at times he appears a bit forced.
Also, his character comes dangerously close to losing its humor and
being simply repulsive. Fortunately, the humor always triumphs.
BLOODY MARY ideally calls for a heavy-set person. Carmen
Rios is anything but this; she has nevertheless worked out an en
tirely acceptable interpretation. She has developed a suitably idiotic
laugh and delivers with unfalteringly gusto the “stingy bastard”
line which she is urged to say on numerous occasions.
The role of Lt. Joseph Cable presents a real problem. Admittedly,
a male ingenue is an impossible part to do well, and we must there
fore sympathize with David Quattrone as he struggles to invest his
character with some life. He brings to his hole an appropriate in
genuousness, but he seems ill at ease, and simply does not know
what to do with his hands. Donna D’Fini is an attractive Liat, but
she does little to make the love scene more palatable. In all fairness,
the fault here is not so much the actors’ as it is the improbable
script.
Also struggling with thankless roles are Robert Sinclair as Capl.
George Brackett and Walter Wiebenson as Commander William
Harbison. They play their stock roles with conscientious monotony,
and the scenes in (heir office (particularly those discussing military
strategy) are invariably low-points in the play.
IN LESSER ROLES, Sylvia and Fred Rios’are appropriately
precious as Emile’s children, and Ken DeNault has a few moments
as Stewpot.
The technical aspects of the show are. without exception, first
rate. Hoddy Guittard’s direction sees to it that the show is briskly
paced and well-integrated. Jody Lauer’s choreography, while not
jokingly imaginative, is highly serviceable. The production numbers
are all done with zest; indeed, the show’s high-point is the “There’s
Nothing Like a Dame” routine. Bill Eddelman’s settings manage to
suggest a tropical atmosphere, as do his costumes. The lighting by
Cary Clasz is at times quite effective; she works especially well
with her greens. The shift crew deserves special commendation;
the show requires an inordinate number of set changes and these
arc executed with rapidity. There are no awkward pauses between
changes as there well might have been with a less efficient group.
“South Pacific” continues tonight and Saturday in Memorial
Auditorium.
