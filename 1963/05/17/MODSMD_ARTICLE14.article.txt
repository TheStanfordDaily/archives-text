# Shelter Discussion: A Step Forward
## 
### 
The Stanford Today and Tomorrow panel discussion bn
the fallout shelter program Wednesday afternoon was a sig
nificant turning point in the history of student-Administration
relations at Stanford.
To a near-capacity audience in Cubberlcy Auditorium,
members of the faculty and Administration answered ques
tions openly and frankly about university policy. The event
was not a complete success: some answers were evasive and
some questions were so badly formulated they did not merit
answers. On the whole, however, a good representation of
community concern and a good explanation of the reasons be
hind University policy were expressed.
The implications of such a discussion are important. The
Administration has publicly recognized that it is proper to
inform the Stanford community publicly of their reasons for
taking controversial policy stands, and to allow members
of the Administration to be questioned about these stands.
The Administration, it seems, has begun to realize that con
cern like that shown by the students during the fallout shel
ter controversy is based on a desire by the students to be
informed of decisions which affect them, not a desire to chal
lenge University authority.
At the same time, the fact that a large number of students
attended the discussion demonstrates an interest and concern
which goes beyond the apathy that has become so familiar
in the student body. Such concern should continue to be re
warded and encouraged by increasing University awareness
and consideration of student opinion.
The panel discussion in Cubberley Wednesday was a di
vergence from the fear and mistrust that has so badly scarred
and distorted student-Administration relations during the
past few years. It foreshadows a time when the whole stu
dent body will share the degree of concern shown by those
who have been involved in this controversy; a time when
disagreement will result not in demonstrations and hard
line decrees but in rational and mature discussions; when
honest questions will be understood not as challenges to
University authority but as a means to increase student
understanding.
