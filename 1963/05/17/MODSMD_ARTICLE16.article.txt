Dining the question and answer period at the Stanford
Today and Tomorrow forum on fallout shelters, the question of
who was consulted on the decision of establishing fallout shel
ters at Stanford was persistently put to the panel. The questions
were put off with vague and general answers. The question
referred to the following statement in the faculty newsletter
and in a statement by Mr. Lyle Nelson in The Daily. “The de
cision to participate in the federally financed fallout shelter
program was made by the University trustees following con
sultation by the administration with faculty members and others
expert in this field.” I, and others in the audience, woidd simply
like to know who the “others” are. The question was put to cast
some illumination on the amount and quality of thought that
resulted in the policy.
Can we draw a parallel between the number of students who
knew of the shelter program before seeing the black and yellow
signs and the number of “others” and faculty members con
sulted? The decision makers would nip uncomplimentary sus
picions in the bud if they would answer the question by listing
the persons consulted. It should be easy, for as Mr. Nelson said,
“They’re in the faculty directory.” Could Mr. Nelson and Mr.
Brandin be a bit more specific? I’m sure that the persons con
sulted won’t mind their names being published in The Daily.
If you are now asking, “What difference does it make if
we know who was consulted?” let me say that the question
doesn’t mean anything to those who passively accept and quickly
conform to the small, private, higher authority. Authority is a
necessary ingredient of an ordered society, but it should have a
broad basis for its decisions and the support of its subjects.
The decision makers did not bother troubling many students, but
it would be interesting and informative to see whom they did
bother with.

A few weeks ago the University decided that a student vigil
before President Sterling’s house constitutes “harassment” and
must not be tolerated. May I suggest that Dean Winbigler add
to his list of student actions which constitute “harassment"
riotous water fights such as that which took place on all sides
of my house the night of May 14. The vulgarity and noisy stu
pidity of this display forced me to disband an evening seminar
I was holding at my home. And in addition to thus interfering
with the educational function of this school, the manly men of
Stanford did an effective job of scaring the wits out of my three
year-old daughter.
I’m sure President Sterling, who could not bear the presence
of a single, silent student on his front lawn, will be able to
sympathize with my ire. Indeed, I should have thought, since this
was not the first riot Wilbur Hall has experienced (there was a
nasty one in the Fall of last year) that such behavior would
already have received Dean Winbigler’s attention and that pro
cedures comparable in severity to those for dealing with vigils
would have been devised.
Yet as far as I am aware, the police collected no student
body cards from the rioters, under threat of summary dismissal
from Stanford. The one policeman 1 coidd find on the scene
only smiled benignly and said, “Well, the University doesn’t
frown on water fights. . . .”

Tresidder Union sugar comes in little packets adorned wdlh
arty bird pictures. Doubtless, many of your readers have won
dered, as they poured sugar into their coffee from a “canvas
back” package, or into their tea from, say, a “ring-necked
pheasant,” . . . “What does this mean?” Now, I wouldn’t want
these lovely sugarbags removed from the Union, nor would I
wish their avian theme be changed, but I do think that Stanford
students deserve to know what omens they bode. It has been
shown for instance, that “wood-duck” on Friday is terribly bad
luck, while a “bobwhite” on Tuesday may raise a term paper as
much as a whole grade. A “mallard" on Monday morning is
calamitous: but a “ring-necked pheasant” in the afternoon may
nullify its effect. On the whole, “California quail” is good luck,
while “canvasbacks” are bad. But by far the worst omen is a
“baldpate” on Thursday. After such a sign, one should hide.

That a group including Stanford students—(he Stanford
Area Young Republicans—could have voted to censure Senator
Thomas Kuchel for his recent speech is to me incredible.
I wonder if they read beyond the headlines. If they had, it is
hard to understand how they could fail to be impressed by its
straightforward appeal to reason and common sense—that is. of
course, unless they also fear such things as an imminent take
over by the U.N., spearheaded by troops of cannibals, under the
demonic leadership of Earl Warren.
Perhaps the Young Republicans are too young to remember
the late Senator Joseph McCarthy’s performance—“l have here
the names of 202 Communists” —which the ensuing weeks and
months consistently failed to produce. Despite the valiant efforts
of those fourth-rate gumshoes, Cohn and Schein, not a single
name was substantiated—and yet people were appallingly ready
to accept the unfounded accusation as “truth,” as they seem
now prepared to swallow similarly preposterous accusations
put forth by such authorities as Billy Joe Hargis, Gerald L. K.
Smith, Robert Welch, Dr. Schwartz, etc.—(all of whom, inci
dentally, seem to thrive financially by their efforts. I
That isolated, tradition-ridden, semi-illiterate .folk on the
verge of economic extinction mjight embrace such apparent
“answers” is understandable. That Stanford—or any University
students—should do so is frightening.
For the issue here is not whether one is Republican, or Con
servative, or American, or International—but simply the credi
bility of the testimony, which in the case of those that Senator
Kuchel calls to account is so patently crazy.

We would like to draw your attention to the very recent
systematic destruction of all the swallow nests on Quad.
This leads us to ask the following question: Why?
For centuries these gentle migrating creatures, in all the
civilized nations of the world, have been considered omens of
good luck and happiness, and treated as such.
These nests cause no damage to the buildings and we feel
that the charm of Quad is as dependent upon the presence of (he
birds as that of the flowers.
To make the swallows homeless just in the middle of the
season seems to be an exorbitant price to pay for the sake of
cleanliness.

The civilized Christians in Birmingham move in an atmos
phere of antagonism and fear which comes in large part from
their ignorance and socially acceptable hostilities. Legal values
have become a facade used to tolerate oppressive and cruel
measures directed against a strange neighbor .The denial of the
moral value of man’s life and dignity promotes the practice of
discrimination and uncivilized maltreatment of human beings.
Wo may think that we have the luxury of abhorring the
situation in Birmingham as if we were the spectators and not
the participants and sponsors. Do we not promote and share
the same malevolent attitudes toward other strange peoples?
The power of Police Chief Connor rests on bayonets and dogs,
and children are injured; the power of nations rests on far more
destructive weapons, and children will be murdered. For both
Mr. Connor and Mr. Kennedy cannot see beyond their respective
idolatrous religions of white supremacy and nationalism; all
other ethical values are completely irrelevant, hence, the continu
ation of man abusing man.

Dining the question and answer period at the Stanford
Today and Tomorrow forum on fallout shelters, the question of
who was consulted on the decision of establishing fallout shel
ters at Stanford was persistently put to the panel. The questions
were put off with vague and general answers. The question
referred to the following statement in the faculty newsletter
and in a statement by Mr. Lyle Nelson in The Daily. “The de
cision to participate in the federally financed fallout shelter
program was made by the University trustees following con
sultation by the administration with faculty members and others
expert in this field.” I, and others in the audience, woidd simply
like to know who the “others” are. The question was put to cast
some illumination on the amount and quality of thought that
resulted in the policy.
Can we draw a parallel between the number of students who
knew of the shelter program before seeing the black and yellow
signs and the number of “others” and faculty members con
sulted? The decision makers would nip uncomplimentary sus
picions in the bud if they would answer the question by listing
the persons consulted. It should be easy, for as Mr. Nelson said,
“They’re in the faculty directory.” Could Mr. Nelson and Mr.
Brandin be a bit more specific? I’m sure that the persons con
sulted won’t mind their names being published in The Daily.
If you are now asking, “What difference does it make if
we know who was consulted?” let me say that the question
doesn’t mean anything to those who passively accept and quickly
conform to the small, private, higher authority. Authority is a
necessary ingredient of an ordered society, but it should have a
broad basis for its decisions and the support of its subjects.
The decision makers did not bother troubling many students, but
it would be interesting and informative to see whom they did
bother with.

A few weeks ago the University decided that a student vigil
before President Sterling’s house constitutes “harassment” and
must not be tolerated. May I suggest that Dean Winbigler add
to his list of student actions which constitute “harassment"
riotous water fights such as that which took place on all sides
of my house the night of May 14. The vulgarity and noisy stu
pidity of this display forced me to disband an evening seminar
I was holding at my home. And in addition to thus interfering
with the educational function of this school, the manly men of
Stanford did an effective job of scaring the wits out of my three
year-old daughter.
I’m sure President Sterling, who could not bear the presence
of a single, silent student on his front lawn, will be able to
sympathize with my ire. Indeed, I should have thought, since this
was not the first riot Wilbur Hall has experienced (there was a
nasty one in the Fall of last year) that such behavior would
already have received Dean Winbigler’s attention and that pro
cedures comparable in severity to those for dealing with vigils
would have been devised.
Yet as far as I am aware, the police collected no student
body cards from the rioters, under threat of summary dismissal
from Stanford. The one policeman 1 coidd find on the scene
only smiled benignly and said, “Well, the University doesn’t
frown on water fights. . . .”

Tresidder Union sugar comes in little packets adorned wdlh
arty bird pictures. Doubtless, many of your readers have won
dered, as they poured sugar into their coffee from a “canvas
back” package, or into their tea from, say, a “ring-necked
pheasant,” . . . “What does this mean?” Now, I wouldn’t want
these lovely sugarbags removed from the Union, nor would I
wish their avian theme be changed, but I do think that Stanford
students deserve to know what omens they bode. It has been
shown for instance, that “wood-duck” on Friday is terribly bad
luck, while a “bobwhite” on Tuesday may raise a term paper as
much as a whole grade. A “mallard" on Monday morning is
calamitous: but a “ring-necked pheasant” in the afternoon may
nullify its effect. On the whole, “California quail” is good luck,
while “canvasbacks” are bad. But by far the worst omen is a
“baldpate” on Thursday. After such a sign, one should hide.

That a group including Stanford students—(he Stanford

Thomas Kuchel for his recent speech is to me incredible.
I wonder if they read beyond the headlines. If they had, it is
hard to understand how they could fail to be impressed by its
straightforward appeal to reason and common sense—that is. of
course, unless they also fear such things as an imminent take
over by the U.N., spearheaded by troops of cannibals, under the
demonic leadership of Earl Warren.
Perhaps the Young Republicans are too young to remember
the late Senator Joseph McCarthy’s performance—“l have here
the names of 202 Communists” —which the ensuing weeks and
months consistently failed to produce. Despite the valiant efforts
of those fourth-rate gumshoes, Cohn and Schein, not a single
name was substantiated—and yet people were appallingly ready
to accept the unfounded accusation as “truth,” as they seem
now prepared to swallow similarly preposterous accusations
put forth by such authorities as Billy Joe Hargis, Gerald L. K.
Smith, Robert Welch, Dr. Schwartz, etc.—(all of whom, inci

That isolated, tradition-ridden, semi-illiterate .folk on the
verge of economic extinction mjight embrace such apparent
“answers” is understandable. That Stanford—or any University
students—should do so is frightening.
For the issue here is not whether one is Republican, or Con

Kuchel calls to account is so patently crazy.

We would like to draw your attention to the very recent
systematic destruction of all the swallow nests on Quad.
This leads us to ask the following question: Why?
For centuries these gentle migrating creatures, in all the
civilized nations of the world, have been considered omens of
good luck and happiness, and treated as such.
These nests cause no damage to the buildings and we feel
that the charm of Quad is as dependent upon the presence of (he

To make the swallows homeless just in the middle of the

Dining the question and answer period at the Stanford
Today and Tomorrow forum on fallout shelters, the question of
who was consulted on the decision of establishing fallout shel
ters at Stanford was persistently put to the panel. The questions
were put off with vague and general answers. The question
referred to the following statement in the faculty newsletter
and in a statement by Mr. Lyle Nelson in The Daily. “The de
cision to participate in the federally financed fallout shelter
program was made by the University trustees following con
sultation by the administration with faculty members and others
expert in this field.” I, and others in the audience, woidd simply
like to know who the “others” are. The question was put to cast
some illumination on the amount and quality of thought that
resulted in the policy.
Can we draw a parallel between the number of students who
knew of the shelter program before seeing the black and yellow
signs and the number of “others” and faculty members con
sulted? The decision makers would nip uncomplimentary sus
picions in the bud if they would answer the question by listing
the persons consulted. It should be easy, for as Mr. Nelson said,
“They’re in the faculty directory.” Could Mr. Nelson and Mr.
Brandin be a bit more specific? I’m sure that the persons con
sulted won’t mind their names being published in The Daily.
If you are now asking, “What difference does it make if
we know who was consulted?” let me say that the question
doesn’t mean anything to those who passively accept and quickly
conform to the small, private, higher authority. Authority is a
necessary ingredient of an ordered society, but it should have a
broad basis for its decisions and the support of its subjects.
The decision makers did not bother troubling many students, but
it would be interesting and informative to see whom they did
bother with.

A few weeks ago the University decided that a student vigil
before President Sterling’s house constitutes “harassment” and
must not be tolerated. May I suggest that Dean Winbigler add
to his list of student actions which constitute “harassment"
riotous water fights such as that which took place on all sides
of my house the night of May 14. The vulgarity and noisy stu
pidity of this display forced me to disband an evening seminar
I was holding at my home. And in addition to thus interfering
with the educational function of this school, the manly men of
Stanford did an effective job of scaring the wits out of my three
year-old daughter.
I’m sure President Sterling, who could not bear the presence
of a single, silent student on his front lawn, will be able to
sympathize with my ire. Indeed, I should have thought, since this
was not the first riot Wilbur Hall has experienced (there was a
nasty one in the Fall of last year) that such behavior would
already have received Dean Winbigler’s attention and that pro
cedures comparable in severity to those for dealing with vigils
would have been devised.
Yet as far as I am aware, the police collected no student
body cards from the rioters, under threat of summary dismissal
from Stanford. The one policeman 1 coidd find on the scene
only smiled benignly and said, “Well, the University doesn’t
frown on water fights. . . .”

Tresidder Union sugar comes in little packets adorned wdlh
arty bird pictures. Doubtless, many of your readers have won
dered, as they poured sugar into their coffee from a “canvas
back” package, or into their tea from, say, a “ring-necked
pheasant,” . . . “What does this mean?” Now, I wouldn’t want
these lovely sugarbags removed from the Union, nor would I
wish their avian theme be changed, but I do think that Stanford
students deserve to know what omens they bode. It has been
shown for instance, that “wood-duck” on Friday is terribly bad
luck, while a “bobwhite” on Tuesday may raise a term paper as
much as a whole grade. A “mallard" on Monday morning is
calamitous: but a “ring-necked pheasant” in the afternoon may
nullify its effect. On the whole, “California quail” is good luck,
while “canvasbacks” are bad. But by far the worst omen is a
“baldpate” on Thursday. After such a sign, one should hide.

That a group including Stanford students—(he Stanford

Thomas Kuchel for his recent speech is to me incredible.
I wonder if they read beyond the headlines. If they had, it is
hard to understand how they could fail to be impressed by its
straightforward appeal to reason and common sense—that is. of
course, unless they also fear such things as an imminent take
over by the U.N., spearheaded by troops of cannibals, under the
demonic leadership of Earl Warren.
Perhaps the Young Republicans are too young to remember
the late Senator Joseph McCarthy’s performance—“l have here
the names of 202 Communists” —which the ensuing weeks and
months consistently failed to produce. Despite the valiant efforts
of those fourth-rate gumshoes, Cohn and Schein, not a single
name was substantiated—and yet people were appallingly ready
to accept the unfounded accusation as “truth,” as they seem
now prepared to swallow similarly preposterous accusations
put forth by such authorities as Billy Joe Hargis, Gerald L. K.
Smith, Robert Welch, Dr. Schwartz, etc.—(all of whom, inci

That isolated, tradition-ridden, semi-illiterate .folk on the
verge of economic extinction mjight embrace such apparent
“answers” is understandable. That Stanford—or any University
students—should do so is frightening.
For the issue here is not whether one is Republican, or Con

Kuchel calls to account is so patently crazy.

We would like to draw your attention to the very recent
systematic destruction of all the swallow nests on Quad.
This leads us to ask the following question: Why?
For centuries these gentle migrating creatures, in all the
civilized nations of the world, have been considered omens of
good luck and happiness, and treated as such.
These nests cause no damage to the buildings and we feel
that the charm of Quad is as dependent upon the presence of (he

To make the swallows homeless just in the middle of the

Dining the question and answer period at the Stanford
Today and Tomorrow forum on fallout shelters, the question of
who was consulted on the decision of establishing fallout shel
ters at Stanford was persistently put to the panel. The questions
were put off with vague and general answers. The question
referred to the following statement in the faculty newsletter
and in a statement by Mr. Lyle Nelson in The Daily. “The de
cision to participate in the federally financed fallout shelter
program was made by the University trustees following con
sultation by the administration with faculty members and others
expert in this field.” I, and others in the audience, woidd simply
like to know who the “others” are. The question was put to cast
some illumination on the amount and quality of thought that
resulted in the policy.
Can we draw a parallel between the number of students who
knew of the shelter program before seeing the black and yellow
signs and the number of “others” and faculty members con
sulted? The decision makers would nip uncomplimentary sus
picions in the bud if they would answer the question by listing
the persons consulted. It should be easy, for as Mr. Nelson said,
“They’re in the faculty directory.” Could Mr. Nelson and Mr.
Brandin be a bit more specific? I’m sure that the persons con
sulted won’t mind their names being published in The Daily.
If you are now asking, “What difference does it make if
we know who was consulted?” let me say that the question
doesn’t mean anything to those who passively accept and quickly
conform to the small, private, higher authority. Authority is a
necessary ingredient of an ordered society, but it should have a
broad basis for its decisions and the support of its subjects.
The decision makers did not bother troubling many students, but
it would be interesting and informative to see whom they did
bother with.

A few weeks ago the University decided that a student vigil
before President Sterling’s house constitutes “harassment” and
must not be tolerated. May I suggest that Dean Winbigler add
to his list of student actions which constitute “harassment"
riotous water fights such as that which took place on all sides
of my house the night of May 14. The vulgarity and noisy stu
pidity of this display forced me to disband an evening seminar
I was holding at my home. And in addition to thus interfering
with the educational function of this school, the manly men of
Stanford did an effective job of scaring the wits out of my three
year-old daughter.
I’m sure President Sterling, who could not bear the presence
of a single, silent student on his front lawn, will be able to
sympathize with my ire. Indeed, I should have thought, since this
was not the first riot Wilbur Hall has experienced (there was a
nasty one in the Fall of last year) that such behavior would
already have received Dean Winbigler’s attention and that pro
cedures comparable in severity to those for dealing with vigils
would have been devised.
Yet as far as I am aware, the police collected no student
body cards from the rioters, under threat of summary dismissal
from Stanford. The one policeman 1 coidd find on the scene
only smiled benignly and said, “Well, the University doesn’t
frown on water fights. . . .”

Tresidder Union sugar comes in little packets adorned wdlh
arty bird pictures. Doubtless, many of your readers have won
dered, as they poured sugar into their coffee from a “canvas
back” package, or into their tea from, say, a “ring-necked
pheasant,” . . . “What does this mean?” Now, I wouldn’t want
these lovely sugarbags removed from the Union, nor would I
wish their avian theme be changed, but I do think that Stanford
students deserve to know what omens they bode. It has been
shown for instance, that “wood-duck” on Friday is terribly bad
luck, while a “bobwhite” on Tuesday may raise a term paper as
much as a whole grade. A “mallard" on Monday morning is
calamitous: but a “ring-necked pheasant” in the afternoon may
nullify its effect. On the whole, “California quail” is good luck,
while “canvasbacks” are bad. But by far the worst omen is a
“baldpate” on Thursday. After such a sign, one should hide.

That a group including Stanford students—(he Stanford
Area Young Republicans—could have voted to censure Senator
Thomas Kuchel for his recent speech is to me incredible.
I wonder if they read beyond the headlines. If they had, it is
hard to understand how they could fail to be impressed by its
straightforward appeal to reason and common sense—that is. of
course, unless they also fear such things as an imminent take
over by the U.N., spearheaded by troops of cannibals, under the
demonic leadership of Earl Warren.
Perhaps the Young Republicans are too young to remember
the late Senator Joseph McCarthy’s performance—“l have here
the names of 202 Communists” —which the ensuing weeks and
months consistently failed to produce. Despite the valiant efforts
of those fourth-rate gumshoes, Cohn and Schein, not a single
name was substantiated—and yet people were appallingly ready
to accept the unfounded accusation as “truth,” as they seem
now prepared to swallow similarly preposterous accusations
put forth by such authorities as Billy Joe Hargis, Gerald L. K.
Smith, Robert Welch, Dr. Schwartz, etc.—(all of whom, inci
dentally, seem to thrive financially by their efforts. I
That isolated, tradition-ridden, semi-illiterate .folk on the
verge of economic extinction mjight embrace such apparent
“answers” is understandable. That Stanford—or any University
students—should do so is frightening.
For the issue here is not whether one is Republican, or Con
servative, or American, or International—but simply the credi
bility of the testimony, which in the case of those that Senator
Kuchel calls to account is so patently crazy.

We would like to draw your attention to the very recent
systematic destruction of all the swallow nests on Quad.
This leads us to ask the following question: Why?
For centuries these gentle migrating creatures, in all the
civilized nations of the world, have been considered omens of
good luck and happiness, and treated as such.
These nests cause no damage to the buildings and we feel
that the charm of Quad is as dependent upon the presence of (he
birds as that of the flowers.
To make the swallows homeless just in the middle of the
season seems to be an exorbitant price to pay for the sake of
cleanliness.

The civilized Christians in Birmingham move in an atmos
phere of antagonism and fear which comes in large part from
their ignorance and socially acceptable hostilities. Legal values
have become a facade used to tolerate oppressive and cruel
measures directed against a strange neighbor .The denial of the
moral value of man’s life and dignity promotes the practice of
discrimination and uncivilized maltreatment of human beings.
Wo may think that we have the luxury of abhorring the
situation in Birmingham as if we were the spectators and not
the participants and sponsors. Do we not promote and share
the same malevolent attitudes toward other strange peoples?
The power of Police Chief Connor rests on bayonets and dogs,
and children are injured; the power of nations rests on far more
destructive weapons, and children will be murdered. For both
Mr. Connor and Mr. Kennedy cannot see beyond their respective
idolatrous religions of white supremacy and nationalism; all
other ethical values are completely irrelevant, hence, the continu
ation of man abusing man.
