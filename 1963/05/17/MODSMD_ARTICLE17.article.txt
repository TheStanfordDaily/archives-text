(Editors’ note: this is the first
of a two part series.)

After the football season is over
the football coach and his assist
ants begin the hectic task of re
recruiting freshmen football
players.

From replies to mass correspon
dence to high schools, primarily
in California, from contact with
individual high schools, and from
alumni scouts and newspaper
clippings approximately 5,000
names reach the coaches. The
transcripts of these prospects are
reviewed and 4,000 are dropped
from consideration. College Board
scores, further scrutiny of tran
scripts and a realistic evaluation
of athletic prowess reduces the
list to 150.
A period of intense competition
then begins in which the prime
prospects, noted for their athletic
and academic ability, are courted
by football-minded schools. The
competition is real says freshman
football coach William Walsh and.
"We know exactly which schools
are interested in them.” Stan
ford’s stiffest competition, he
says, are from the service aca
demics, the ivy league schools.
UC and UCLA.
In competing for a student the

coaches cannot offer bonuses and
special privileges which are not
allowed by NCAA rules. And they
have no authority to pressure the
Administration into admitting a
student: he can only be admitted
on the basis of his academic
merit.

ACCORDING to Coach Walsh,
Stanford uses accepted recruiting
procedures: 1) a boy can be en
couraged to apply; 2) a boy can
be offered scholarship aid once
he has applied and, 3) once a boy
has been admitted ho can bo
brought to the campus and shown
what the school, as a whole, has
to offer.
The coaches cannot keep a boy
advised on his admission status
but, according to Walsh, they can
"counsel and advise” him when
to take the College Boards and
when to meet other application
deadlines. Two visits are allowed
to a high school prospect and, if
the case "warrants personal con
tact,” the coaches will travel to
talk with the boys and their par
ents. And a continuous stream
of letters Is used to interest par
ents, as well as their sons, in
Stanford.
Athletic scholarships come from
several sources which were des
cribed in an interview with
Charles Taylor, Assistant Direc
tor of Athletics.
The Stanford Buck Club, a
group of 2,890 alumni and friends
interested in athletics, uses yearly
donations ($135,000 this yeari to
provide about 90 full tuition
scholarships, of which about 50
are designated for football. Fi
nancial need and athletic ability
are the two criteria which deter
mine the recipients but the finan
cial need factor is weighed less
than in the awarding of academic
scholarships.
ELEVEN TUITION scholar
ships, ten of which are given for
football are endowed in honor of
David Starr Jordan; they are
awarded to an athlete with com
mendable personal qualities. And
academic scholarships are offered
to those athletes whose record, in
dependent of their athletic status,
would make them eligible for aid;
about 25 per cent of those eligible
for athletic scholarships are also
eligible for academic scholarships.
In addition to direct aid pros
pective football players are of
fered other inducements. They
are given a chance to hash for

their board and to work in the
Department of Athletic’s Corpora
tion Yard at $2.25 an hour. Buck
Club members, the prospective
athlete can be told, might be able
to find summer jobs and work
during Christmas vacation. And
tutors in academic subjects will
be supplied by the Department of
Athletics if an athlete requests
help in his studies.
When a boy has been accepted
and is trying to make his final
decision the Department of Ath
letics arranges to bring him to
the campus for a weekend visit.
High school seniors from the Bay
Area are often given tickets to
athletic events and are encour
aged to spend time on the cam
pus. For the weekend visits up
perclass football players are paid
to act as big-brother escorts for
the prospects.
THE VISITORS are farmed out
to fraternities and got a glimpse of
this side of Stanford social life.
They are taken to lectures in
fields which interest them and
conferences are arranged with
advisors in their chosen area of
study. And they have hull ses
sions with coaches. Larry Curf
man, a freshman from Kansas
who has an athletic grant for
football, recalls that in his week
end visit last year, "They stressed
that playing football at Stanford
goes with an academic life.”
The visitation program for foot
ball players is complemented by
three days each year on which
their parents are invited to four
the campus. Coach Walsh stresses
that the over-all picture presented
to the parents and their sons
“does not distort the educational
image of the University” but tries
to show "the place of athletics
within that education.”
The Department of Athletics fi
nances its 'rush' program for foot
ball players with appropriations
from its departmental budget.
The Department makes up f or
its expenditures, however, by re
turning monies to the University
from gate receipts, the sale of TV
rights, the proceeds of a summer
coaching camp and the profit
from the operation of the golf
course.

From replies to mass correspon
dence to high schools, primarily
in California, from contact with
individual high schools, and from
alumni scouts and newspaper
clippings approximately 5,000
names reach the coaches. The
transcripts of these prospects are
reviewed and 4,000 are dropped
from consideration. College Board
scores, further scrutiny of tran
scripts and a realistic evaluation
of athletic prowess reduces the
list to 150.
A period of intense competition
then begins in which the prime
prospects, noted for their athletic
and academic ability, are courted
by football-minded schools. The
competition is real says freshman
football coach William Walsh and.
"We know exactly which schools
are interested in them.” Stan
ford’s stiffest competition, he
says, are from the service aca
demics, the ivy league schools.
UC and UCLA.
In competing for a student the

coaches cannot offer bonuses and
special privileges which are not
allowed by NCAA rules. And they
have no authority to pressure the
Administration into admitting a
student: he can only be admitted
on the basis of his academic
merit.

ACCORDING to Coach Walsh,
Stanford uses accepted recruiting
procedures: 1) a boy can be en
couraged to apply; 2) a boy can
be offered scholarship aid once
he has applied and, 3) once a boy
has been admitted ho can bo
brought to the campus and shown
what the school, as a whole, has
to offer.
The coaches cannot keep a boy
advised on his admission status
but, according to Walsh, they can
"counsel and advise” him when
to take the College Boards and
when to meet other application
deadlines. Two visits are allowed
to a high school prospect and, if
the case "warrants personal con
tact,” the coaches will travel to
talk with the boys and their par
ents. And a continuous stream
of letters Is used to interest par
ents, as well as their sons, in
Stanford.
Athletic scholarships come from
several sources which were des
cribed in an interview with
Charles Taylor, Assistant Direc
tor of Athletics.
The Stanford Buck Club, a
group of 2,890 alumni and friends
interested in athletics, uses yearly
donations ($135,000 this yeari to
provide about 90 full tuition
scholarships, of which about 50
are designated for football. Fi
nancial need and athletic ability
are the two criteria which deter
mine the recipients but the finan
cial need factor is weighed less
than in the awarding of academic
scholarships.
ELEVEN TUITION scholar
ships, ten of which are given for
football are endowed in honor of
David Starr Jordan; they are
awarded to an athlete with com
mendable personal qualities. And
academic scholarships are offered
to those athletes whose record, in
dependent of their athletic status,
would make them eligible for aid;
about 25 per cent of those eligible
for athletic scholarships are also
eligible for academic scholarships.
In addition to direct aid pros
pective football players are of
fered other inducements. They
are given a chance to hash for

their board and to work in the
Department of Athletic’s Corpora
tion Yard at $2.25 an hour. Buck
Club members, the prospective
athlete can be told, might be able
to find summer jobs and work
during Christmas vacation. And
tutors in academic subjects will
be supplied by the Department of
Athletics if an athlete requests
help in his studies.
When a boy has been accepted
and is trying to make his final
decision the Department of Ath
letics arranges to bring him to
the campus for a weekend visit.
High school seniors from the Bay
Area are often given tickets to
athletic events and are encour
aged to spend time on the cam
pus. For the weekend visits up
perclass football players are paid
to act as big-brother escorts for
the prospects.
THE VISITORS are farmed out
to fraternities and got a glimpse of
this side of Stanford social life.
They are taken to lectures in
fields which interest them and
conferences are arranged with
advisors in their chosen area of
study. And they have hull ses
sions with coaches. Larry Curf
man, a freshman from Kansas
who has an athletic grant for
football, recalls that in his week
end visit last year, "They stressed
that playing football at Stanford
goes with an academic life.”
The visitation program for foot
ball players is complemented by
three days each year on which
their parents are invited to four
the campus. Coach Walsh stresses
that the over-all picture presented
to the parents and their sons
“does not distort the educational
image of the University” but tries
to show "the place of athletics
within that education.”
The Department of Athletics fi
nances its 'rush' program for foot
ball players with appropriations
from its departmental budget.
The Department makes up f or
its expenditures, however, by re
turning monies to the University
from gate receipts, the sale of TV
rights, the proceeds of a summer
coaching camp and the profit
from the operation of the golf
course.

reviewed and 4,000 are dropped
from consideration. College Board
scores, further scrutiny of tran
scripts and a realistic evaluation
of athletic prowess reduces the
list to 150.
A period of intense competition
then begins in which the prime
prospects, noted for their athletic
and academic ability, are courted
by football-minded schools. The
competition is real says freshman
football coach William Walsh and.
"We know exactly which schools
are interested in them.” Stan
ford’s stiffest competition, he
says, are from the service aca
demics, the ivy league schools.
UC and UCLA.
In competing for a student the

coaches cannot offer bonuses and
special privileges which are not
allowed by NCAA rules. And they
have no authority to pressure the
Administration into admitting a
student: he can only be admitted
on the basis of his academic
merit.

ACCORDING to Coach Walsh,
Stanford uses accepted recruiting
procedures: 1) a boy can be en
couraged to apply; 2) a boy can
be offered scholarship aid once
he has applied and, 3) once a boy
has been admitted ho can bo
brought to the campus and shown
what the school, as a whole, has
to offer.
The coaches cannot keep a boy
advised on his admission status
but, according to Walsh, they can
"counsel and advise” him when
to take the College Boards and
when to meet other application
deadlines. Two visits are allowed
to a high school prospect and, if
the case "warrants personal con
tact,” the coaches will travel to
talk with the boys and their par
ents. And a continuous stream
of letters Is used to interest par
ents, as well as their sons, in
Stanford.
Athletic scholarships come from
several sources which were des
cribed in an interview with
Charles Taylor, Assistant Direc
tor of Athletics.
The Stanford Buck Club, a
group of 2,890 alumni and friends
interested in athletics, uses yearly
donations ($135,000 this yeari to
provide about 90 full tuition
scholarships, of which about 50
are designated for football. Fi
nancial need and athletic ability
are the two criteria which deter
mine the recipients but the finan
cial need factor is weighed less
than in the awarding of academic
scholarships.
ELEVEN TUITION scholar
ships, ten of which are given for
football are endowed in honor of
David Starr Jordan; they are
awarded to an athlete with com
mendable personal qualities. And
academic scholarships are offered
to those athletes whose record, in
dependent of their athletic status,
would make them eligible for aid;
about 25 per cent of those eligible
for athletic scholarships are also
eligible for academic scholarships.
In addition to direct aid pros
pective football players are of
fered other inducements. They
are given a chance to hash for

their board and to work in the
Department of Athletic’s Corpora
tion Yard at $2.25 an hour. Buck
Club members, the prospective
athlete can be told, might be able
to find summer jobs and work
during Christmas vacation. And
tutors in academic subjects will
be supplied by the Department of
Athletics if an athlete requests
help in his studies.
When a boy has been accepted
and is trying to make his final
decision the Department of Ath
letics arranges to bring him to
the campus for a weekend visit.
High school seniors from the Bay
Area are often given tickets to
athletic events and are encour
aged to spend time on the cam
pus. For the weekend visits up
perclass football players are paid
to act as big-brother escorts for
the prospects.
THE VISITORS are farmed out
to fraternities and got a glimpse of
this side of Stanford social life.
They are taken to lectures in
fields which interest them and
conferences are arranged with
advisors in their chosen area of
study. And they have hull ses
sions with coaches. Larry Curf
man, a freshman from Kansas
who has an athletic grant for
football, recalls that in his week
end visit last year, "They stressed
that playing football at Stanford
goes with an academic life.”
The visitation program for foot
ball players is complemented by
three days each year on which
their parents are invited to four
the campus. Coach Walsh stresses
that the over-all picture presented
to the parents and their sons
“does not distort the educational
image of the University” but tries
to show "the place of athletics
within that education.”
The Department of Athletics fi
nances its 'rush' program for foot
ball players with appropriations
from its departmental budget.
The Department makes up f or
its expenditures, however, by re
turning monies to the University
from gate receipts, the sale of TV
rights, the proceeds of a summer
coaching camp and the profit
from the operation of the golf
course.
(Editors’ note: this is the first
of a two part series.)

After the football season is over
the football coach and his assist
ants begin the hectic task of re
recruiting freshmen football
players.

From replies to mass correspon
dence to high schools, primarily
in California, from contact with
individual high schools, and from
alumni scouts and newspaper
clippings approximately 5,000
names reach the coaches. The
transcripts of these prospects are
reviewed and 4,000 are dropped
from consideration. College Board
scores, further scrutiny of tran
scripts and a realistic evaluation
of athletic prowess reduces the
