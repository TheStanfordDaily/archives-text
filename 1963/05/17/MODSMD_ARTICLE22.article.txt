# Drama by O'Neill Presented Tonight
## 
### 
“Studio ’63,” the experimental
drama affiliate of the Department
of Speech and Drama, will pre
sent Eugene O’Neill’s one-act play
“lie” tonight at 7:30 p.m, in the
Studio Theatre in the lid Union.
“He” deals with the harsh en
vironment and consequent pas
sions of the members of the whal
ing industry in New Bedford at
the turn of the century. As an in
dictment of the monomania of a
whaling captain, “He” dramati
cally focuses on the effect such a
passion has on his wife, who is
ultimately broken on the cross of
his singleness of purpose: to get
more “He.”
Playing the whaling captain is
Shapleigh Howell, who recently
played the leading role in the
Commcdia production of Can-Can,
and who will play Crestes in the
forthcoming production of Iphi
genia in Taurls with the Stanford
Opera Theatre. Peggy Donovan
plays the captain's wife. Miss
Donovan has served as a producer
and director with the San Fran
cisco Opera Guild. “He” will be di
rected by Randy Hoey.
There will be no admission
charged.
