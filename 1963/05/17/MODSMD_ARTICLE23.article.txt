### WILLIAM B. QUANDT I.I.R. Political Analyst 
(Editors’ note:
This is the last of a series of
four ariticles put out by the
Foreign Policy Institute con
cering the U.S. foreign policy
and the Sino-Soviet ideolog
ical split. The Foreign Policy
Institute conference will he
held May 20-32.)

NEXT WEEK Stanford stu
dents will have an excellent op
portunity to inform themselves
of what may truly be a turning
point in history the present
Communist schism. The speakers
sponsored by the Foreign Policy
Institute will include a journalist
with wide experience in the Soviet
Union, a statesman of unusual
perceptivenes, and three of the
foremost scholars of Sino-Soviet
relations. Doubtlessly, we will
hear much from them of the im
plications of the current conflicts
between Moscow and Peking, and
thus it would be well for us to
examine some of the assumptions
underlying United States foreign
policy, for if these assumptions
are found to be inadequate, we
may well fail to seize upon th e
opportunities which lie ahead.
Since the Second World War the
United States has been obliged to
accept the role of leader of I he
Western world, a role for which
she was not especially well pre
pared. Faced with a devastated
Europe, American leaders were
wise enough to respond intelli
gently to the challenge of rebuild
ing the Old World through the
Marshall Plan. But peace did not
immediately follow, and Ameri
cans soon found themselves in
a war over Korea, a war which
few understood and fewer desired.

WITH THK C HANGE of gov
ernment in 1953, a new, rather
sterile era began, an era marked
by such modern wonders as brink
manship, Big Two, Three, F o u r
and Five Summit Conferences,
and frightening short-sightedness
in our foreign policies. More and
more we discovered the realities
of cold war politics, and found
that we were being drawn into a
nasty game, where the payoff was
uncertain, and the risks were
high. Consequently we relied
upon our power to block moves
from the other side, but were
rarely so adventuresome as to in
itiate policies before being chal
lenged. Coupled to these attitudes
was a view of the Communist
world as a monolithic, Moscow
dominated bloc, concerned w i th
little else than fomenting foreign
revolution. While this image did
in part describe the Communist
bloc at certain periods in its his-

Tory, it is clearly no longer appli
cable.

We now realize that there is
little, if any, coordination between
the Soviet and Chinese leaders.
In fact, their alliance as a politi
cal force seems to be dead. Pres
sures toward revisionism in the
more affluent Communist coun
tries have provoked a funda
mentalist reaction from parties
for whom Marxism-Leninism still
describes their “reality.” Today
we see an increasing polarization
within the Communist camp, with
Moscow mending its forces in
Eastern Europe, wooing Yugo
slovia back into the bloc, and
strengthening the Council for
Mutual Economic Aid.

CHINESE LEADERS, on the
other hand, have recently visited
Indonesia and North Vietnam,
asserting more firmly their hege
mony over the Asian parties. In
some countries, such as Japan,
the Left is split in its allegiances
to the competing leaders in Mos
cow and Peking. Throughout the
underdeveloped world Chinese
missions are propagating their
"model" of revolution, attempting
to establish a bond with the poor
countries who may find Mao's
dogma more inspiring than the
“bourgeois” platitudes of Khrush
chov.
In view of these world-wide
changes, the United States must
act. It may do so unwisely, thus
further alienating the impover
ished peoples of the world, or it
may courageously undertake a
program of long range assistance,
helping to ring these countries to
a level of self-sustaining growth.
We should not, of course, insist
upon gratitude from those wo
help. Rather we should require
that our aid be used efficiently,
and where possible we should en
courage enlightened, though pos
sible authoritarian, leadership.
The task is an enormous one, and
will meet opposition at home and
abroad. But if there is still a
spark left of the idealism which
has guided Western man for cen
turies, perhaps we will accept this
challenge.

WITH KEGAHD TO the Com
munist world specifically, we
should encourage tendencies to
ward moderation and pluralism
such as those developing in Po
land and Hungary. We should not
get terribly upset by Tito's flirta
tions with Moscow, for even if
Yugoslovia does reenter the bloc
she can only contribute to (he
further erosion of Moscow’s hege
mony over Eastern Europe.
In Asia, we must attempt to
bolster India's staggering efforts
toward development, so that
others will seem alternative to

China’s brutal means of indus
trialization. Japan should also ho
encouraged to do more in Asia,
for she offers an example of an
overpopulated country with poor
resources managing to indus
trialize quickly and efficiently.
Lastly, of course, some policy
must eventually be taken toward
China. Recognition, at some ap
propriate time, might be a first
step.
IN SUM, WE SEEM to be at the
threshold of a new era in world
politics, undecided as to how to
meet the great challenge before
us. That the coming years will be
difficult ones need hardly be
stressed, especially when we fail
so conspicuously, as in Birming
ham, to settle our own serious
problems. But the developments
of the last few years within the
Communist world sem to indicate
that there is room left for imagi
native, almost visionary, policies
in this country. If able leaders
can be found, we may yet avoid
the decline of the West.
