# West Coast Championships Feature Top Crews in U.S.
## 
### PETE KING 
Tomorrow morning Stanford
hosts the biggest crew race of the j
year on the Coast, and possibly |
the nation, as over 250 oarsmen j
from 12 universities match
strokes in the Western Intercol
legiate Rowing Championships in
the Redwood City Yacht Harbor.
Races start at 8 a.m. and con
tinue every 10 minutes until noon. [
The course can be reached by tak
ing the Harbor Boulevard turnoff
from the Bayshore Freeway and
following the signs to the finish
line.
TUI 1 ; VARSITY races are at 9:00
and 9:10, the ,IV races at 8:00 and

8:10, and the freshman race at
9:50. The varsity consolation
race is at 11:50, followed by the
final race.
Highlight of the day will un
doubtedly come at noon, when the
crews of Washington and Cali
fornia will meet. Both these
eights are the best on the coast,
and in their only previous meet
ing this year rowed 2% miles to
a dead heat tie the first in the
60-odd years of U.S. rowing. Of
course, both the Huskies and the
Bears must place high in their
preliminary races in order to meet
in the finale, but this is a fore
gone conclusion.
Just about their only real com
petition will come from a power
ful University of British Columbia

crew that is fresh from a gold
medal victory in the Pan Ameri
can Games. All Big Six schools,
with the exception of landlocked
Washington Stale, have good
crews entered, and Long Beach
State, which has beaten both
Stanford and UCLA, is likewise
a contender.
STANFORD HAS a good chance
to make it into the final race. The
Indians have drawn the easier of
the two preliminary races, against
Washington, Long Beach State,
Oregon State, and Orange Coast
State. The first and second boats
in each race automatically gain
the final sprint race, with the
fifth position going to the third
place boat with the best time.
The Tribe has beaten OSU
twice and should have no trouble
with Orange Coast State. But
Stanford will have to hustle to
beat LBS, who heat them down
south by a length.
FAVORED in the freshman
race is Stanford. The Papooses
have one of the best frosh crews
on the coast, and therefore in the
country as well. They are un
beaten this year, having defeated
Cal, UCLA, Long Beach State,
and Oregon State, who are their
main competitors in the six-boat
race. The only strong crew miss
ing is Washington, who along

with Stanford has beaten Ca], the
third powerful frosh boat on the
coast.
The Stanford JVâ€™s, boasting
only one win this year, are under
dogs in their heat with the same
boats that the varsity faces.
