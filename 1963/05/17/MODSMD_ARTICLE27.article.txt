# Washington, Lead AAWU for All-Sports Cup
## 
### 
The competition for the AAWU
All-Sports Cup is drawing to a
close, with Washington and USC
currently the top contenders for
it. After this weekend’s league
championships in tennis, crew
and golf are settled, the only
sport left in doubt will be track.
The Big Six Ti ack Championships
are scheduled for May 25 at Cal.
The final standings are based
only on the nine AAWU league
sports, of which five are already
completed. On the basis of 10-8-
6-4-2-1 scoring of these sports,
football, basketbal, gymnastics,
swimming, and wrestling, the
standings are the following:

Washington 37
USC 33
Stanford 24
UCLA 22
Washington State ... 22
California 15
Stanford’s expectations for a
victory are not very great, due to
its rather mediocre prospects in
crew and tennis. The best it can
hope for in these two sports is
third place points.
However, Indians tracksters
and golfers both stand excellent
chances of wining their respective
league tournaments: in both cases
their top competition will come
from USC. Nevertheless, even if
they win track and golf, USC’will
compile at minimum an additional
25 points (seconds in golf, track,
tennis, and a sixth in crew). This
would still be enough to beat
Stanford, 57-56.
