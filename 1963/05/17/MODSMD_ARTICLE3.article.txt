# DISCRIMINATION DISCOURAGED
## Minimal Bias on Scholarships 
### IRENE H. STRELITZ Associate Editor 
“Any scholarship funds received
by the University after February,
1957, are free of restrictions as to
creed, and any restrictions as to
race or nationality are stated only
in terms of the donor’s prefer
ence.”
The above statement of Univer
sity policy may be found in the
1963 Information Bulletin of the
University in the section dealing
with "Eligibility” of students for
financial aid.
THE PHRASING of the state
ment carries with it several ques
tions: Are funds restricted as to
creed, accepted before 1957, still
in operation with their original
restrictive clauses? What per
centage of Stanford scholarship
funds are restricted? Does the
University still accept restrictions
as to race and nationality? What
floes “donor’s preference” mean?
General Secretary of the Uni
versity David Jacobsen states that
“approximately 5 per cent of en
dowment funds operate under re
strictive clauses” due to their ac
ceptance before the 1957 date. He
adds that this percentage of en
dowment funds amounts to only
approximately—one quarter of
one per cent of student aid ex
penditures.
The bulk of these restricted
funds are found in three scholar
ships: the Nevada Moore. Irene
Dernham. and Amelia Wilson
funds.
The Nevada Moore fund is a be
quest of over $69,000 received in
1952 from the estate of Nevada
Moore. Scholarships from th e
fund are to be given “to girls of
Caucasian ancestry.”
THE DERNHAM scholarship
was a $25,000 estate bequest, and
is limited to “Jewish students
registered in medicine.” The funds
were accepted by the University
in 1947.

The Wilson funds amount to
$225,800, and are also a bequest
from an estate. According to the
Information Bulletin, “All of the
scholarships are intended for
needy students of good moral
character who profess a belief in
God.”
These three grants total ap
proximately $0,288,000 or about 5
per cent of total endowment for
scholarships.

The 1957 action of the Board of
Trustees was motivated by an;
offer to Jacobson of a scholar- j
ship for white Anglo-Saxon Prot
estants. Jacobson referred th e
offer to the Board.

THK BOARD based its decision
on a statement in the founding
grant. The ammedment of Octo
ber 3, 1902 to the grant states,
“No profession of religious faith :
or belief shall be exacted of any
one for any purpose.”
The decision of the Board states,
“A proper interpretation of the
provisions of the founding grant
render scholarship gifts bearing
restrictions as to race or nation
ality acceptable only if stated in
terms of preference, and pre
cludes the acceptance of scholar
ship gifts bearing direct or indi
rect restriction as to creed.”
Jacobson states that the Uni
versity "suggests removal of re
strictions. Grants stated in the
broadest terms make for ease of
administration and assures t h c
donor the money will be used.”
The University attempts to have
the following clause inserted in
every will or document referring
to Stanford gifts: "If at any time
in the future the use of this fund
. . . for purpose stated is no longer
appropriate, then the Board of
Trustees may use this fund . . .
for such purpose as in its opinion
will best further the objects and
welfare of Stanford University.”
JACOBSON NOTED that one
fund had a restriction for “Cauca
sians” that was removed by t h e
donor. He wont on to say, “In the
40’s, there was no question. Stan
ford had only Caucasion’s; the
times anti temper have changed,
and the question is in sharper fo
cus.
“When the clutch came, and
money was offered, we didn’t
I waver. The University bends over
| backwards to do what the donor
: wants. But we stand on principle:
Don’t let the donor bend you if it
j is against the host principles of
the University.”
Jacobson noted that at a con
j ference of seven major univer
sities in 1957, “only one other of
'the seven universities had a spe
| cific policy on the issue of restric
tion as to creed, race, or nation
; ality.”
Director of Financial Aids .Rob
ert Huff stated in reference to the
discriminatory clauses: “We think
of discrimination against minori
ties, but many people want to
| give to help minority. They are
I used to protect minorities.”
HITT 1 ’ ADDED that acceptance
of funds is technically made
through the Board of Trustees,
and that after review many of
them are “toned down, rewritten.”
In reply to a question, Huff
noted that to his knowledge a uni
versity’s participation in the Na
tional Defense Student Loan pro
gram does not requir e any kind
of elimination of restricted funds.
According to Jacobson, "Those
who want restrictions make
’grants-in-aid’ rather than scholar
ships so that they don't have to
meet academic competition.”

centage of Stanford scholarship
funds are restricted? Does the
University still accept restrictions
as to race and nationality? What
floes “donor’s preference” mean?
General Secretary of the Uni
versity David Jacobsen states that
“approximately 5 per cent of en
dowment funds operate under re
strictive clauses” due to their ac
ceptance before the 1957 date. He
adds that this percentage of en
dowment funds amounts to only
approximately—one quarter of
one per cent of student aid ex
penditures.
The bulk of these restricted
funds are found in three scholar
ships: the Nevada Moore. Irene
Dernham. and Amelia Wilson
funds.
The Nevada Moore fund is a be
quest of over $69,000 received in
1952 from the estate of Nevada
Moore. Scholarships from th e
fund are to be given “to girls of
Caucasian ancestry.”
THE DERNHAM scholarship
was a $25,000 estate bequest, and
is limited to “Jewish students
registered in medicine.” The funds
were accepted by the University
in 1947.

The Wilson funds amount to
$225,800, and are also a bequest
from an estate. According to the
Information Bulletin, “All of the
scholarships are intended for
needy students of good moral
character who profess a belief in
God.”
These three grants total ap
proximately $0,288,000 or about 5
per cent of total endowment for
scholarships.

The 1957 action of the Board of
Trustees was motivated by an;
offer to Jacobson of a scholar- j
ship for white Anglo-Saxon Prot
estants. Jacobson referred th e
offer to the Board.

THK BOARD based its decision
on a statement in the founding
grant. The ammedment of Octo
ber 3, 1902 to the grant states,
“No profession of religious faith :
or belief shall be exacted of any
one for any purpose.”
The decision of the Board states,
“A proper interpretation of the
provisions of the founding grant
render scholarship gifts bearing
restrictions as to race or nation
ality acceptable only if stated in
terms of preference, and pre
cludes the acceptance of scholar
ship gifts bearing direct or indi
rect restriction as to creed.”
Jacobson states that the Uni
versity "suggests removal of re
strictions. Grants stated in the
broadest terms make for ease of
administration and assures t h c
donor the money will be used.”
The University attempts to have
the following clause inserted in
every will or document referring
to Stanford gifts: "If at any time
in the future the use of this fund
. . . for purpose stated is no longer
appropriate, then the Board of
Trustees may use this fund . . .
for such purpose as in its opinion
will best further the objects and
welfare of Stanford University.”
JACOBSON NOTED that one
fund had a restriction for “Cauca
sians” that was removed by t h e
donor. He wont on to say, “In the
40’s, there was no question. Stan
ford had only Caucasion’s; the
times anti temper have changed,
and the question is in sharper fo
cus.
“When the clutch came, and
money was offered, we didn’t
I waver. The University bends over
| backwards to do what the donor
: wants. But we stand on principle:
Don’t let the donor bend you if it
j is against the host principles of
the University.”
Jacobson noted that at a con
j ference of seven major univer
sities in 1957, “only one other of
'the seven universities had a spe
| cific policy on the issue of restric
tion as to creed, race, or nation
; ality.”
Director of Financial Aids .Rob
ert Huff stated in reference to the
discriminatory clauses: “We think
of discrimination against minori
ties, but many people want to
| give to help minority. They are
I used to protect minorities.”
HITT 1 ’ ADDED that acceptance
of funds is technically made
through the Board of Trustees,
and that after review many of
them are “toned down, rewritten.”
In reply to a question, Huff
noted that to his knowledge a uni
versity’s participation in the Na
tional Defense Student Loan pro
gram does not requir e any kind
of elimination of restricted funds.
According to Jacobson, "Those
who want restrictions make
’grants-in-aid’ rather than scholar
ships so that they don't have to
meet academic competition.”
“Any scholarship funds received
by the University after February,
1957, are free of restrictions as to
creed, and any restrictions as to
race or nationality are stated only
in terms of the donor’s prefer
ence.”
The above statement of Univer
sity policy may be found in the
1963 Information Bulletin of the
University in the section dealing
with "Eligibility” of students for
financial aid.
THE PHRASING of the state
ment carries with it several ques

creed, accepted before 1957, still

quest of over $69,000 received in
1952 from the estate of Nevada
Moore. Scholarships from th e
fund are to be given “to girls of
Caucasian ancestry.”
THE DERNHAM scholarship
was a $25,000 estate bequest, and
is limited to “Jewish students
registered in medicine.” The funds
were accepted by the University
in 1947.

The Wilson funds amount to
$225,800, and are also a bequest
from an estate. According to the
Information Bulletin, “All of the
scholarships are intended for
needy students of good moral
character who profess a belief in
God.”
These three grants total ap
proximately $0,288,000 or about 5
per cent of total endowment for
scholarships.

The 1957 action of the Board of
Trustees was motivated by an;
offer to Jacobson of a scholar- j
ship for white Anglo-Saxon Prot
estants. Jacobson referred th e
offer to the Board.

THK BOARD based its decision
on a statement in the founding
grant. The ammedment of Octo
ber 3, 1902 to the grant states,
“No profession of religious faith :
or belief shall be exacted of any
one for any purpose.”
The decision of the Board states,
“A proper interpretation of the
provisions of the founding grant
render scholarship gifts bearing
restrictions as to race or nation
ality acceptable only if stated in
terms of preference, and pre
cludes the acceptance of scholar
ship gifts bearing direct or indi
rect restriction as to creed.”
Jacobson states that the Uni
versity "suggests removal of re
strictions. Grants stated in the
broadest terms make for ease of
administration and assures t h c
donor the money will be used.”
The University attempts to have
the following clause inserted in
every will or document referring
to Stanford gifts: "If at any time
in the future the use of this fund
. . . for purpose stated is no longer
appropriate, then the Board of
Trustees may use this fund . . .
for such purpose as in its opinion
will best further the objects and
welfare of Stanford University.”
JACOBSON NOTED that one
fund had a restriction for “Cauca
sians” that was removed by t h e
donor. He wont on to say, “In the
40’s, there was no question. Stan
ford had only Caucasion’s; the
times anti temper have changed,
and the question is in sharper fo
cus.
“When the clutch came, and
money was offered, we didn’t
I waver. The University bends over
| backwards to do what the donor
: wants. But we stand on principle:
Don’t let the donor bend you if it
j is against the host principles of
the University.”
Jacobson noted that at a con
j ference of seven major univer
sities in 1957, “only one other of
'the seven universities had a spe
| cific policy on the issue of restric
tion as to creed, race, or nation
; ality.”
Director of Financial Aids .Rob
ert Huff stated in reference to the
discriminatory clauses: “We think
of discrimination against minori
ties, but many people want to
| give to help minority. They are
I used to protect minorities.”
HITT 1 ’ ADDED that acceptance
of funds is technically made
through the Board of Trustees,
and that after review many of
them are “toned down, rewritten.”
In reply to a question, Huff
noted that to his knowledge a uni
versity’s participation in the Na
tional Defense Student Loan pro
gram does not requir e any kind
of elimination of restricted funds.
According to Jacobson, "Those
who want restrictions make
’grants-in-aid’ rather than scholar
ships so that they don't have to
meet academic competition.”
“Any scholarship funds received
by the University after February,
1957, are free of restrictions as to
creed, and any restrictions as to
race or nationality are stated only
in terms of the donor’s prefer
ence.”
The above statement of Univer
sity policy may be found in the
1963 Information Bulletin of the
University in the section dealing
with "Eligibility” of students for
financial aid.
THE PHRASING of the state
ment carries with it several ques
tions: Are funds restricted as to
creed, accepted before 1957, still
in operation with their original
restrictive clauses? What per
centage of Stanford scholarship
funds are restricted? Does the
University still accept restrictions
as to race and nationality? What
floes “donor’s preference” mean?
General Secretary of the Uni
versity David Jacobsen states that
“approximately 5 per cent of en
dowment funds operate under re
strictive clauses” due to their ac
ceptance before the 1957 date. He
adds that this percentage of en
dowment funds amounts to only
approximately—one quarter of
one per cent of student aid ex
penditures.
The bulk of these restricted
funds are found in three scholar
ships: the Nevada Moore. Irene
Dernham. and Amelia Wilson
funds.
