# Indians Try for Best Season Ever in Stanford Baseball
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford has been eliminated
from the CIBA title chase, but the
Indians have a chance to become
the most successful baseball team
in (he school’s history since Stan
ford began playing a major base
ball schedule.
The Indians fare California
twice this weekend, journeying to
Berkeley to meet the Bears today
at 3 p.m., and hosting Cal on
Sunken Diamond at 2 p.m. tomor
row.
STANFORD’S season record is
now 23-10. A pair of wins over a
Bear team that has given every
one trouble despite a losing CIBA
record (3-11) would surpass the
24-10 mark set by the 1956 team,
Dutch Fehrlng’s first at Stanford.
The Indians of Everett Dean in
1953 won 29 games but they also
lost 15 and tied two.
As usual, Jim Lonborg and Dar
rell Sutherland will pitch against
the Bears. Stanford’s two tall
righthanders have pitched every
inning of every game the Indians
have played against Cal in the
past two years.
Lonborg has won all three he
pitched, and Sutherland, backed
by wretched fielding and even
worse hitting, has lost all three.
SUTHERLAND SUFFERED a
slight ankle sprain against UCLA
last weekend and will pitch Sat
urday, so he can have an extra
day of rest. That will leave Lon
borg to throw this afternoon with
only two days rest. Dave Dowling,
who the Cards have beaten both
times he pitched against them,
will probably oppose Lonborg this
afternoon.
Larry Colton or Mike Jauregui
will be the Cal pitcher Saturday.
Colton holds a decision over Suth
erland earlier this year.
The top Cal batters are Craig
Morton, Mike Epstein and Dave
Myers. The three combined to
wreck Sutherland in his last ap
pearance against the Bears.
Cal has added many grey hairs
to Coach George Wolfman’s head.
The Bears have lost seven one-run
CIBA decisions, and they could
have won several of them if they
had shown more base-running re
straint. In addition, Wolfman,
who is regarded as one of the best
coaches in college baseball, seems
to be in a bit of a slump himself.
FOR INSTANCE he called for
a squeze bunt with the bases
loaded and no one out against
USC earlier this year that back
fired to the extent that Cal didn’t

score and lost the game by one
run.
Stanford, a team that has also
been plagued by inconsistencies
while at the plate and on the
basepaths, may be able to capital
ize on these Cal inadequacies and
heat the Bears.
