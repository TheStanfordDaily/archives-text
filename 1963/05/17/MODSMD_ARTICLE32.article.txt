## 
### DAVID NYBERG 
The AAWU golf tournament
| began this morning at 7:30 on the
Stanford course. The pre-match
i favorite in the 36-man field is
; Stanford senior Peter Choate,
who is eying his third conference
championship. Choate won his
first title in 1960 (along with the
| NCAA long-driving contest),
I skipped a year of competition and
| came back in 1962 for his second
; trophy.
j Stanford also won the team
! championship in 1960, when the
! tournament was held here. Last
! year, however, Southern Califor
| nja was both host and champion
of the tournament. The Trojans,
j with last year’s runner-up Ron
Rhoads, and third-place finisher
Dave Stockton, are considered
j one of the top collegiate teams in
| the country. The Indians by no
j means are to be counted out,
| though, as they are undefeated in
I conference dual matches for two
years.
! Washington, 1961 champions,
| are anxious to finish above
Southern California (his week
end, as the results of the golf
competition will have great and
immediate bearing on the out
come of the race for the All-
Sports Trophy. Currently, Wash
ington has a four-point lead over
their southern rivals, but the Tro
jans will earn points in track
and tennis to push them ahead of

the Huskies, who are expected to
finish high in crew.
Individuals to watch during the
36-hole event are Washington’s
Bruce Richards, Stockton and
Rhoads of USC, and UCLA's Cliff
Davis. These four fine fairway
men are expected to furnish
Choate’s stiffest competition.
Stanford golfers in today's
matches are: Choate against
Rhoads and Richards at 7:30 and

112:30; Jim Rheim against Howard
i Leffel (WSU), and Stockton at
17:46 and 12:46; Bob Ireland
| against Larry Edwards (Cal),
j and Jim Collar! (UCLA) at 8:10
and 1:10; Dave Cotton against
Jim Ewing (USC) and Jack
I Craig (W) at 8:18 and 1:18; Bill
I Sechrest against Garry Ponce
