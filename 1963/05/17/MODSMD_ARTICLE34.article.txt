# Sprinter Questad, 440 Relay Team fOr School Records

### ROGER MENDELSON 
Stanford’s track team divides
its activity this weekend between
two big, West Coast relay meets,
the Coliseum Relays and the
Northern California Invitational.
Coach Payton Jordan is taking
only ten men with him to Los
Angeles tonight, since he is sav
ing the balance of his varsity and
freshman tracksters for fresh
performances tomorrow at Ber
keley.
The contingent heading for the
Southland though comparatively
small, includes three of Stan
ford’s greatest athlets of all time
plus an outstanding 440 relay
team. The quartet of Len Bres
chini, Phil Lamoreaux, Eric j
Frische, and Larry Questad ran
41.0 last week in the Fresno Re

lays to record the best time by |
an AAWU team this year and j
the second fastest time (by
0:00.1 1 in Stanford history. These
four will also run (ho 880 relay,
in which their best time so far is
1:25.4.
QUFSTAD, who is now poten
tially Stanford’s greatest sprint
er ever, will not run the 100-yard
dash tonight but he will enter it
tomorrow. He has already tied
the school record, 9.4, which was
set in 1939 by Clyde Jeffrey. The
momentum from the steady prog
ress he has made this season
makes him a good bet to break
that record, if not this year, then
in his next two years of Stanford
track.
Also in the Coliseum Meet
group are Dave Weill, who wins
the collegiate discus competition
every week as regularly as the
Yankees win the American
League pennant, and Harry Mc-
Calla, Stanford’s greatest dis
tance runner ever. McCalla will
run only the steeplechase tonight,
but will probably comeback to
morrow in the mile and/or (Wo
rn ile.
STANFORD'S final entry in
L.A. is a two-mile relay team of
Harlan Andrews, Robin Ruble,
Bill Pratt, and Bob Mill/. Ruble
is replacing McCalla to rest the
latter for the steeplechase and
the races in Berkeley.
In the NorCal Meet, Jordan is
holding out two of Stanford’s
other outstanding performers,
Steve Cortright and Dan Moore.
There is a chance that Moore will
compete tonight as a last-minute
entry in the broad jump, but not
tomorrow as Jordan wants to
make sure he is well rested for
the Big Six Meet next week.
The same holds true for Cort
right, who will not compote at all
this weekend. Having run two
hurdle races and six triple jump
attempts in each of the last eight
weekends, Jordan wants to give
Cortright the benefit of a week
end off.
A 34-man contingent will enter
the Berkeley meet, however, with
a couple of unusual entries. Jor
dan’s plan is to break the monot
ony of running the same event
week after week. To carry this
out, he has entered Ken Emanu
els, a 440-yarder, in the 100-yard
dash, and Paul Schlicke, a long
| distance man, in the 880; Schlicke
; will also run the mile, but not the
; two-mile.

this weekend. Having run two
hurdle races and six triple jump
attempts in each of the last eight
weekends, Jordan wants to give
Cortright the benefit of a week
end off.
A 34-man contingent will enter
the Berkeley meet, however, with
a couple of unusual entries. Jor
dan’s plan is to break the monot
ony of running the same event
week after week. To carry this
out, he has entered Ken Emanu
els, a 440-yarder, in the 100-yard
dash, and Paul Schlicke, a long
| distance man, in the 880; Schlicke
; will also run the mile, but not the
; two-mile.
Stanford’s track team divides
its activity this weekend between
two big, West Coast relay meets,
the Coliseum Relays and the
Northern California Invitational.
Coach Payton Jordan is taking
only ten men with him to Los
Angeles tonight, since he is sav
ing the balance of his varsity and
freshman tracksters for fresh
performances tomorrow at Ber
keley.
The contingent heading for the
Southland though comparatively
small, includes three of Stan
ford’s greatest athlets of all time
plus an outstanding 440 relay
team. The quartet of Len Bres
chini, Phil Lamoreaux, Eric j
Frische, and Larry Questad ran
41.0 last week in the Fresno Re

lays to record the best time by |
an AAWU team this year and j
the second fastest time (by
0:00.1 1 in Stanford history. These
four will also run (ho 880 relay,
in which their best time so far is
1:25.4.
QUFSTAD, who is now poten
tially Stanford’s greatest sprint
er ever, will not run the 100-yard
dash tonight but he will enter it
tomorrow. He has already tied
the school record, 9.4, which was
set in 1939 by Clyde Jeffrey. The
momentum from the steady prog
ress he has made this season
makes him a good bet to break
that record, if not this year, then
in his next two years of Stanford
track.
Also in the Coliseum Meet
group are Dave Weill, who wins
the collegiate discus competition
every week as regularly as the
Yankees win the American
League pennant, and Harry Mc-
Calla, Stanford’s greatest dis
tance runner ever. McCalla will
run only the steeplechase tonight,
but will probably comeback to
morrow in the mile and/or (Wo
rn ile.
STANFORD'S final entry in
L.A. is a two-mile relay team of
Harlan Andrews, Robin Ruble,
Bill Pratt, and Bob Mill/. Ruble
is replacing McCalla to rest the
latter for the steeplechase and
the races in Berkeley.
In the NorCal Meet, Jordan is
holding out two of Stanford’s
other outstanding performers,
Steve Cortright and Dan Moore.
There is a chance that Moore will
compete tonight as a last-minute
entry in the broad jump, but not
tomorrow as Jordan wants to
make sure he is well rested for
the Big Six Meet next week.
The same holds true for Cort
right, who will not compote at all
this weekend. Having run two
hurdle races and six triple jump
attempts in each of the last eight
weekends, Jordan wants to give
Cortright the benefit of a week
end off.
