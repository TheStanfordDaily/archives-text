The Pan American Games, the
annual contests which establish
the athletic supremacy of North,
Central, and South America, were
held this year in Sao Paolo, Bra
zil. Stanford sent four representa
tives to the games this year,
water polo star Marty Hull, water
polo coach Jim Gaughran, oars
man Ed Ferry and crew coach
con Findlay.
Hull paced the U.S. team to a
second place finish in the water
polo competition. He was high
scorer for the U.S. and standout
on defense as well. Ferry and
Findlay won a first place and a
gold medal in the paired oarsman
with coxen event,
HULL, is the the national cham
pion in the 200 yard breaststroke
and is also one of the top five but
terfly swimmers in the country.
He is certainly the most versatile
swimmer in Stanford history and
probably the finest water polo
player in the country. In Brazil
Hull played right forward and led
the U.S. team with an average of
slightly less than two goals a
game during the eight contests.
Hullâ€™s finest game was probably
the final contest, against the
champion Brazilian team. Brazil
had a six foot five inch 233 lb.
forward who up to that time had
been the scourge of the tourna

mont. Hull guarded him for the
entire game and held him score
less, while playing excellent offen
sive polo himself and scoring a
key goal. The game ended in a
3-3 tie, hut previous loses to
Brazil and Argentina cost the
U.S. any chance for first place.
COAC H GAIGHKAN who ac
companied the team in a coach
ing capacity designated Midi "as
definitely one of the top three
U.S. players. His chances for the
1964 Olympic team are excellent,"
Ferry, senior stroke of the Stan
ford first boat, and Findlay, Stan
ford crew coach since 1938, won
the gold medal by finishing first
in a field of four, beating Argen
tina, Brazil and Chile.
FKKRV and Findlay won t hi'
national championship in their
particular event last summer and
with it the right to represent the
United States in the games.
