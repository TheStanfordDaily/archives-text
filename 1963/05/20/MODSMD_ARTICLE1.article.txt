# Philosophy Department Combats Superficiality' With Tutorial Program
## 
### MARILYN P. FRYE 
(Editors’ Note: The tutorial program of
instruction for upperclass philosophy majors
is the only one of its kind at Stanford. This
is tlie first part of a two-part series.)

One of the most noticeable academic
weaknesses of Stanford has been the failure
of the academic programs to satisfy both
the need for development of broad academic
interests and the need for serious and pro
longed attention to smaller areas of particu
lar importance in the student’s major field.
The program of tutorial instruction in the
Philosophy Department is part of the answer

to the problem of the possible superficiality
of four years of multiple course work.
The tutorial program is organized as a
two-year series for juniors and seniors in
the department. The Junior Tutorial, which
is open to all juniors, consists of a nine-unit
continuous course meeting weekly in tutori
al groups of three students and a tutor who
is a junior faculty member. The course is
designed to give the students an opportunity
to study closely the main work of two major
philosophers; the student can choose to
study Aristotle and Kant or Plato and Hume.
The entire year is devoted to intensive read
ing of the texts, discussion aimed at both
understanding and interpretation, and fre
quent writing of papers around which the

discussion centers. The emphasis in most
tutorial groups is on the interpretation of
the primary sources, with sparing use of
commentaries and other supplimentary ma
terial. The Junior Tutorials are designed to
give the best possible situation for close and
systematic textual analysis. At the end of
the year, a challenging comprehensive exam
ination is given which, in combination with
oral and written performance in the tutori
al sessions, is the basis of a recommenda
tion for admittance to the Senior Tutorial.
IN THE SENIOR YEAR, those who have
qualified may choose to take five units each
quarter of individual tutorial work with a
senior faculty member. The student may
work on any topic in philosophy upon which

he and a tutor can agree, and will usually
tually, the student is often unsure of his
exact topic, and he chooses a tutor whose
general interests coincide with his own, and
then settles upon a topic during the first
quarter, in cooperation with the tutor. The
Senior Tutorials are much more flexible than
the Junior, and therefore give the interested
senior a chance to organize his own schedule
of study and writing, and to depend on him
self more than the average student does.
In the third quarter, the student works al
most entirely on his own. In the form which
the Senior Tutorial now takes, after some
evolution from the original plan, the senior
honors essay is written as the final project
of the tutorial.

choose a tutor who shares his interests. Ac

ONE DIFFICULTY in carrying out the
Senior Tutorial program is that of the great
demand it places upon the time of the senior
faculty members. But one of the important
aspects of the program is that it is designed
primarily for the serious students who are
motivated by their own interest in exten
sive and original research on some particu
lar problem, and such students generally
produce work which is worthy of the time
and attention of the faculty members.

The second part of this exposition, which
will appear tomorrow, will deal with the
purposes and achievements of the Philoso
phy Tutorial, and the academic importance
of such a program.
