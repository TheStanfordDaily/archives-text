# PEACE CORPS LETTER
## Peace Corps in Colombia 
### DENNIS CUTSHAW 
Peace Corps Volunteer in Colombia

I am forwarding this report to you with the hope that those
at Stanford who are thinking about joining the Peace Corps,
or merely curious about what actually goes on in the field, will
gain a better understanding of it.
I am a member of a 31-member sports delegation of the
Peace Corps assigned to instruct in sports and physical education
in the Universities and vocational schools of Colombia, South
America.
After an 8-week training course at Texas Western College and
a 3-week schedule of what is called “outward bound" training
at Camp Crozier in Puerto Rico, which included a 3-day root
eating survival trek, a compulsory 50-yd. underwater endurance
swim, and a visit by Harry Bclafonte, a Peace Corps advisor,
we arrived in Bogota for a final 2 weeks of orientation.
At the conclusion of the two-weeks orientation, we were
turned loose, more or less, each with a one-way plane ticket to
his particular university. My site turned out to bo Cartagena, a
walled city built by the Spanish conquistadores around 300 years
ago on the Caribbean coast. The majority of the people are negro
and mestizo, with the upper classes being white.
I am working out of the University of Cartagena, a three
story broken-down building in the center of the ancient walled
in city. The second day after my arrival, I was met by the stu
dent sports-co-ordinator, who immediately lined up a conference
with the rector. The students in Colombia have a surprising
amount of power. For example, the sports co-ordinator is in
charge of all school sports funds, and must be consulted by the
Rector for money. Another interesting fact is that students
strike a particular professor or faculty if they do not like the
way he is teaching. Since universities are the starting points
for many revolutions in South America, nervous administrat
tors usually give in to student demands.
Concerning sports, the school has no physical education pro
gram in the school itself. All sports activities must be done off
hours by interested students. The closest facilities are a basket
ball court, and a weight-lifting room about a mile away. I took
a look at the basketball court the first week I was there, and
was surprised at the state of disrepair it was in. The court was
littered with the remains of a livestock show which was held
there last year. With the help of one of the players and some
workers we were able to get it cleaned off. Unfortunately
there is only one shower but this doesn’t seem to faze the players
as there is a kind of aversion to taking showers anyhow. They
have very little discipline and organization in basketball, but
much natural ability. The Spanish tradition of independence
and isolation, as epitomized by the solitary bullfighter pitted
against the bull, doesn’t easily lend itself to teamwork. As a re
sult, you don't get a basketball team, but five men playing their
own game. Time and again, against a zone defense, Colombians
will give in to a seemingly uncontrollable urge to drive through
the center of the zone.
The next project was track. For three weeks I was unable
to locate the track. But finally found a huge, unfinished stadium
three miles out of town with fairly good facilities. A coach from
the Liceo de Bolivar who was the national champion in the 100
meters and the javelin in 1958 helps me with this. Since the
stadium was so far from town, we started using the old city
track which was built many years ago and is now completely run
down, covered with weeds, bricks, etc. For the past three weeks
I have held track workouts there and tried to get school and
city officials to throw in some money to re-build it. It wouldn’t
take much money to do it as “obreros” or workers get around
10 pesos a day which is about one dollar American.
Speaking of money, as Peace Corps Volunteers, we get
around 1.000 pesos a month to live on, which is about 100 dollars
American. This goes a long way down here considering that
beer goes for 9 cents a bottle, movies for 15 cents, and a place to
stay for 20-30 bucks a month.
We are certainly not getting rich, nor are we, so far, revo
lutionizing sports in Colombia. But, we are slowly giving them
an idea of American sports methods and the American way of
life, which, to me anyhow, was not truly appreciated until I had
left the country for awhile. The job is interesting, stimulating
and at times frustrating, but most important it is worthwhile.’
In parts of the country, such as the south, it is even dangerous,
as this area is the stronghold of “Violencia," a type of Mau-maii
activity in which banditos practice such arts as the “necktie
cut, in which the throat is layed open by machete and the
tongue pulled down to the navel.
In conclusion. I would say that the Peace Corps experience
can be a good one or a bad one, depending on what you make of
it. Certainly, it is an experience which will not be‘forgotten

three miles out of town with fairly good facilities. A coach from
the Liceo de Bolivar who was the national champion in the 100
meters and the javelin in 1958 helps me with this. Since the
stadium was so far from town, we started using the old city
track which was built many years ago and is now completely run
down, covered with weeds, bricks, etc. For the past three weeks
I have held track workouts there and tried to get school and
city officials to throw in some money to re-build it. It wouldn’t
take much money to do it as “obreros” or workers get around
10 pesos a day which is about one dollar American.
Speaking of money, as Peace Corps Volunteers, we get
around 1.000 pesos a month to live on, which is about 100 dollars
American. This goes a long way down here considering that
beer goes for 9 cents a bottle, movies for 15 cents, and a place to
stay for 20-30 bucks a month.
We are certainly not getting rich, nor are we, so far, revo
lutionizing sports in Colombia. But, we are slowly giving them
an idea of American sports methods and the American way of
life, which, to me anyhow, was not truly appreciated until I had
left the country for awhile. The job is interesting, stimulating
and at times frustrating, but most important it is worthwhile.’
In parts of the country, such as the south, it is even dangerous,
as this area is the stronghold of “Violencia," a type of Mau-maii
activity in which banditos practice such arts as the “necktie
cut, in which the throat is layed open by machete and the
tongue pulled down to the navel.
In conclusion. I would say that the Peace Corps experience
can be a good one or a bad one, depending on what you make of
it. Certainly, it is an experience which will not be‘forgotten

or merely curious about what actually goes on in the field, will
gain a better understanding of it.
I am a member of a 31-member sports delegation of the
Peace Corps assigned to instruct in sports and physical education
in the Universities and vocational schools of Colombia, South
America.
After an 8-week training course at Texas Western College and
a 3-week schedule of what is called “outward bound" training
at Camp Crozier in Puerto Rico, which included a 3-day root
eating survival trek, a compulsory 50-yd. underwater endurance
swim, and a visit by Harry Bclafonte, a Peace Corps advisor,
we arrived in Bogota for a final 2 weeks of orientation.
At the conclusion of the two-weeks orientation, we were
turned loose, more or less, each with a one-way plane ticket to
his particular university. My site turned out to bo Cartagena, a
walled city built by the Spanish conquistadores around 300 years
ago on the Caribbean coast. The majority of the people are negro
and mestizo, with the upper classes being white.
I am working out of the University of Cartagena, a three
story broken-down building in the center of the ancient walled
in city. The second day after my arrival, I was met by the stu
dent sports-co-ordinator, who immediately lined up a conference
with the rector. The students in Colombia have a surprising
amount of power. For example, the sports co-ordinator is in
charge of all school sports funds, and must be consulted by the
Rector for money. Another interesting fact is that students
strike a particular professor or faculty if they do not like the
way he is teaching. Since universities are the starting points
for many revolutions in South America, nervous administrat
tors usually give in to student demands.
Concerning sports, the school has no physical education pro
gram in the school itself. All sports activities must be done off
hours by interested students. The closest facilities are a basket
ball court, and a weight-lifting room about a mile away. I took
a look at the basketball court the first week I was there, and
was surprised at the state of disrepair it was in. The court was
littered with the remains of a livestock show which was held
there last year. With the help of one of the players and some
workers we were able to get it cleaned off. Unfortunately
there is only one shower but this doesn’t seem to faze the players
as there is a kind of aversion to taking showers anyhow. They
have very little discipline and organization in basketball, but
much natural ability. The Spanish tradition of independence
and isolation, as epitomized by the solitary bullfighter pitted
against the bull, doesn’t easily lend itself to teamwork. As a re
sult, you don't get a basketball team, but five men playing their
own game. Time and again, against a zone defense, Colombians
will give in to a seemingly uncontrollable urge to drive through
the center of the zone.

I am working out of the University of Cartagena, a three
story broken-down building in the center of the ancient walled
in city. The second day after my arrival, I was met by the stu
dent sports-co-ordinator, who immediately lined up a conference
with the rector. The students in Colombia have a surprising
amount of power. For example, the sports co-ordinator is in
charge of all school sports funds, and must be consulted by the
Rector for money. Another interesting fact is that students
strike a particular professor or faculty if they do not like the
way he is teaching. Since universities are the starting points
for many revolutions in South America, nervous administrat
tors usually give in to student demands.
Concerning sports, the school has no physical education pro
gram in the school itself. All sports activities must be done off
hours by interested students. The closest facilities are a basket
ball court, and a weight-lifting room about a mile away. I took
a look at the basketball court the first week I was there, and
was surprised at the state of disrepair it was in. The court was
littered with the remains of a livestock show which was held
there last year. With the help of one of the players and some
workers we were able to get it cleaned off. Unfortunately
there is only one shower but this doesn’t seem to faze the players
as there is a kind of aversion to taking showers anyhow. They
have very little discipline and organization in basketball, but
much natural ability. The Spanish tradition of independence
and isolation, as epitomized by the solitary bullfighter pitted
against the bull, doesn’t easily lend itself to teamwork. As a re
sult, you don't get a basketball team, but five men playing their
own game. Time and again, against a zone defense, Colombians
will give in to a seemingly uncontrollable urge to drive through
the center of the zone.
The next project was track. For three weeks I was unable
to locate the track. But finally found a huge, unfinished stadium
three miles out of town with fairly good facilities. A coach from
the Liceo de Bolivar who was the national champion in the 100
meters and the javelin in 1958 helps me with this. Since the
stadium was so far from town, we started using the old city
track which was built many years ago and is now completely run
down, covered with weeds, bricks, etc. For the past three weeks
I have held track workouts there and tried to get school and
city officials to throw in some money to re-build it. It wouldn’t
take much money to do it as “obreros” or workers get around
10 pesos a day which is about one dollar American.
Speaking of money, as Peace Corps Volunteers, we get
around 1.000 pesos a month to live on, which is about 100 dollars
American. This goes a long way down here considering that
beer goes for 9 cents a bottle, movies for 15 cents, and a place to
stay for 20-30 bucks a month.
We are certainly not getting rich, nor are we, so far, revo
lutionizing sports in Colombia. But, we are slowly giving them
an idea of American sports methods and the American way of
life, which, to me anyhow, was not truly appreciated until I had
left the country for awhile. The job is interesting, stimulating
and at times frustrating, but most important it is worthwhile.’
In parts of the country, such as the south, it is even dangerous,
as this area is the stronghold of “Violencia," a type of Mau-maii
activity in which banditos practice such arts as the “necktie
cut, in which the throat is layed open by machete and the
tongue pulled down to the navel.
In conclusion. I would say that the Peace Corps experience
can be a good one or a bad one, depending on what you make of
it. Certainly, it is an experience which will not be‘forgotten
Peace Corps Volunteer in Colombia

I am forwarding this report to you with the hope that those
at Stanford who are thinking about joining the Peace Corps,
or merely curious about what actually goes on in the field, will
gain a better understanding of it.
I am a member of a 31-member sports delegation of the
Peace Corps assigned to instruct in sports and physical education
in the Universities and vocational schools of Colombia, South
America.
After an 8-week training course at Texas Western College and
a 3-week schedule of what is called “outward bound" training
at Camp Crozier in Puerto Rico, which included a 3-day root
eating survival trek, a compulsory 50-yd. underwater endurance
swim, and a visit by Harry Bclafonte, a Peace Corps advisor,
we arrived in Bogota for a final 2 weeks of orientation.
At the conclusion of the two-weeks orientation, we were
turned loose, more or less, each with a one-way plane ticket to
his particular university. My site turned out to bo Cartagena, a
walled city built by the Spanish conquistadores around 300 years
ago on the Caribbean coast. The majority of the people are negro
and mestizo, with the upper classes being white.
