## Drekmeier's Book: 'Work of Art' 
### IAN DENGLER 
“Kingship and Community in Early India," Charles Drek
meier, Stanford llniv. Press, $7.1(0.

A book, in the classic canon, ought to have a ‘beginning,’ a
‘middle’ and an ‘end’; each part being an integral yet independ
ent division of the work as a whole. Most books the under
graduate encounters, however, experience a subtle abridge
ment of this formula. Instead of a ‘beginning’ there is an ‘in
troductory summary.’ Instead of an ‘end,’ there is a ‘concluding
summary,’ while the ‘middle’ is eliminated entirely as a mis
leading restatement of material better covered elsewhere.
Not so with Professor Drekmeier’s book “Kingship and
Community in Early India,” which has more than ably suc
ceeded in replacing such unitary monotony with diversity. No
administrative charts here. No graphs. No sampling devices on
levels of significance. No tables of any kind at all. Only ideas.
A veritable protean farrago of ideas.
Professor Drekmeier’s book is an attempt to apply the
findings of the social sciences in examining the interrelation
ship of these events, in order to achieve some understanding of
social organization, styles of thought, power, authority and its
legitimating myths and symbols, and the relationship of the
individual to the community. As such it should be of special
interest to the student of cultural and intellectual history and
to most anyone else in the social sciences, for it provides an
excellent fulcrum from which to examine the disparity, from
common origin, in the evolution of Indian and ‘Western’ cul
tural traditions.
If the ‘theme’ of the book can be reduced to a single sen
tence, it is that the various patterns of Indian social organiza
tion are the result of three roughly coeval responses to the
decay of the older Aryan value system. These responses, sym
bolized in the figures of the Buddha, Kautalya, and Krishna,
sought to provide new agencies of social interaction and inte
gration by overcoming the sense of differentiation between the
needs of the individual and the purposes of the collectivity.
The response of the Buddha was largely psychological—a
technique for coping with the demands of the instinctual life
when instinctive responses to the environment could no longer
provide an adequate basis for social activity. Buddhism might
have provided a new, largely ‘western’ approach to the political,
but its thesis that the transformation of society could only come
about through the religious transformation of the individual
led instead to a divorce from the political and from social reform.
The response of Kautalya, minister of state during the
Mauryan dynasty, was organizational—a method of coping with
the increasingly abstract political life of the individual through
bureaucratic rationalization of certain areas of conflict. Empha
sizing the achievement of collective goals through adaptation,
this response also resembled certain western modes of thought
and political organization. But its impact was limited to a few
areas of society, and was never wholly free of the ethical re
quirements of Indian tradition. With the decline of the empires,
it gave way to the third response to the breakdown of older
tribal values and forms of authority, that of caste.
Instead of the psychological and spiritual solution of the
Buddha, or the ‘political’ solution of Kautalya, caste sought to
achieve social integration through a system of social duty, rigid
ly defined and hierarchically arranged. Symbolized in the figuie
of Krishna, the ‘divine charioteer’ of the Bhagavad Gita, caste
related the individual to a clearly defined functional collectivity
by making the performance of this duty, as disinterested action,
the only way to personal salvation. Such a solution, however,
militates against any form of social and political experimenta
tion. Social institutions exist as a remedy for man’s sin, and only
by the acceptance of this condition can the individual hope to
improve his station. Social amelioration, like Buddhism, must
await the spiritual transformation of society.
This book is description and speculation. It is the projec
tion of the findings of modern anthropology and sociology
onto the conditions of a social system known only through brief
archeological renderings and orally transmitted records. It is
the examination of a Weltanschauung of a heterogeneous cul
ture known only in retrospect. It is the story of the birth of
tragedy and the loss of the heroic ideal, of styles of thought
and legitimating myths and symbols. It is Marx, Freud, Weber
and Dilthey and Drekmeier most of all. Indeed, it is not a text
but a work of art.
