## Memories of Japan 
### YOSHIKI SUGA ASSU Scholar from Japan 
(Editors’ note: This is the first in a two-part series.)

It was right after I started going to kindergarten when the
American attack of main land Japan became threatening day by
day. In the early 1945 Iwo-jima and Okinawa were surrendered
to the U.S. With some sort of excitement and confidence 1
grew up able to attend kindergarten and stay out of home,
I strided every morning to the kindergarten with an. anti
air raid hood. Since every day my home town, Takamatsu city,
was threatened to air raids, it became my routine to go there
and come back home about 10 or 11 o’clock in the morning. I
dashed through the strongly beating alert siren back to home. I
had a tiny anti-air cap on. My mother used to watch me run back
out of a window on the second floor.
Everybody believed then that the U.S. was choking Japan, there
fore Japan must fight against the U.S. to find out her way of
life. Special High Police was organized and was watchful wheth
er or not a person existed who said ill of the Japanese Navy and
Army and its administration. Everybody had to cooperate to
execute war. My father had a gold-rimmed watch that he had
held very important. One day an official came to my house and
asked that everything of precious metal to be raised up for the
Emperor’s and the nation’s sake. My father got a sheet of paper
in return, saying the Japanese government would pay such and
such to the bearer, which could not buy so much.
In Takamatsu city we had a city tram-car which was run
ning right through the middle of the roads. Since the trans
portation of iron ores from the South was checked and on the
battle fields they had been consuming lots of iron in the form
of gunbullets and tanks and so on, the stock of iron became
shorter and shorter. They took off the track of the electric car
for the transformation into bullets and battleships and they
were sent to the front fields in the South.
In the early August 2. 1945, actually a while after mid
night, swarms of the U.S. 829 heavy bombers appeared over
my hometown and burned down everything. I was terrified.
Mother says I did not speak a word but only nodded to
my mother’s words. Leaving me outside, my dad went into the
burning house and took out the most necessary things to a road.
He put them in front of me. While my dad went into the house,
some stranger came to me and carried away the very things that
my dad had just brought. The scene was in turmoil and quite
dark except flares gave a flickering light. I was so terrified that
I could not utter a word, but only watched him. Then without
getting any substantial things except a few blankets, we ran
and ran out of the burning town into the country.
Our country life started, living in a barn from my father’s
friend. Soon after the long-lasted war ended. My mother sold
her kimonos, but we could not buy much because of high in
flation and money did not last long. We lived on the mercy of
the gnod farmer.
The above was a still vivid memory at the end of the w r ar.
When the war ended, we did not have anything to eat or wear.
Since then almost eighteen years have passed. Nowadays, Japan
stands rather favorably printing a miracle in the human record
ed economic history. Japan ranks fourth among all nations in
total industrial production, only the U.S., the Soviet Union, and
West Germany are ahead of her. Japan has achieved an annual
average growth rate of 9 per cent for national income. In spite
of this fact the Japanese do not believe in their big power. They
are afraid of the growing "flood of American imports.” Japan
has always imported more from the U.S. than she exported to
the U.S. At the present time Japan is planning to liberalize more
than 95 per cent of the whole trading items, which will tend to
make Japan a better market of the U.S.

execute war. My father had a gold-rimmed watch that he had
held very important. One day an official came to my house and
asked that everything of precious metal to be raised up for the
Emperor’s and the nation’s sake. My father got a sheet of paper
in return, saying the Japanese government would pay such and
such to the bearer, which could not buy so much.
In Takamatsu city we had a city tram-car which was run
ning right through the middle of the roads. Since the trans
portation of iron ores from the South was checked and on the
battle fields they had been consuming lots of iron in the form
of gunbullets and tanks and so on, the stock of iron became
shorter and shorter. They took off the track of the electric car
for the transformation into bullets and battleships and they
were sent to the front fields in the South.
In the early August 2. 1945, actually a while after mid
night, swarms of the U.S. 829 heavy bombers appeared over
my hometown and burned down everything. I was terrified.
Mother says I did not speak a word but only nodded to
my mother’s words. Leaving me outside, my dad went into the
burning house and took out the most necessary things to a road.
He put them in front of me. While my dad went into the house,
some stranger came to me and carried away the very things that
my dad had just brought. The scene was in turmoil and quite
dark except flares gave a flickering light. I was so terrified that
I could not utter a word, but only watched him. Then without
getting any substantial things except a few blankets, we ran
and ran out of the burning town into the country.
Our country life started, living in a barn from my father’s
friend. Soon after the long-lasted war ended. My mother sold
her kimonos, but we could not buy much because of high in
flation and money did not last long. We lived on the mercy of
the gnod farmer.
The above was a still vivid memory at the end of the w r ar.
When the war ended, we did not have anything to eat or wear.
Since then almost eighteen years have passed. Nowadays, Japan
stands rather favorably printing a miracle in the human record
ed economic history. Japan ranks fourth among all nations in
total industrial production, only the U.S., the Soviet Union, and
West Germany are ahead of her. Japan has achieved an annual
average growth rate of 9 per cent for national income. In spite
of this fact the Japanese do not believe in their big power. They
are afraid of the growing "flood of American imports.” Japan
has always imported more from the U.S. than she exported to
the U.S. At the present time Japan is planning to liberalize more
than 95 per cent of the whole trading items, which will tend to
make Japan a better market of the U.S.

It was right after I started going to kindergarten when the
American attack of main land Japan became threatening day by
day. In the early 1945 Iwo-jima and Okinawa were surrendered
to the U.S. With some sort of excitement and confidence 1
grew up able to attend kindergarten and stay out of home,
I strided every morning to the kindergarten with an. anti
air raid hood. Since every day my home town, Takamatsu city,
was threatened to air raids, it became my routine to go there
and come back home about 10 or 11 o’clock in the morning. I
dashed through the strongly beating alert siren back to home. I
had a tiny anti-air cap on. My mother used to watch me run back
out of a window on the second floor.
Everybody believed then that the U.S. was choking Japan, there
fore Japan must fight against the U.S. to find out her way of
life. Special High Police was organized and was watchful wheth
er or not a person existed who said ill of the Japanese Navy and
Army and its administration. Everybody had to cooperate to
execute war. My father had a gold-rimmed watch that he had
held very important. One day an official came to my house and
