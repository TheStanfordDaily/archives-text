his usual good fastball, and he
allowed five runs in the first two
innings. Catcher Jerry King did
most of the damage with a pair
of two-run singles.
Stanford tried to come back,
hut was stifled by Cal lefty Dave

Dowling, who won his first CIBA
gamp. The Cards snored once in
the fourth on Hollmann’s single,
an infield error, and Gary Smith’s
sacrifice fly.
TWO MORE crossed the plate

field error, Thacher’s infield sin
gle, and Warren Newell’s ground

son’s record, the best at Stanford
since the 1956 team’s 24-10.

ter field and the game was over.
THE LESS SAID about the Fri
day game, the better. Starting
pitcher Darrell Sutherland had to
pitch most of the game without
his usual good fastball, and he
allowed five runs in the first two
innings. Catcher Jerry King did
most of the damage with a pair
of two-run singles.
Stanford tried to come back,
hut was stifled by Cal lefty Dave

Dowling, who won his first CIBA
gamp. The Cards snored once in
the fourth on Hollmann’s single,
an infield error, and Gary Smith’s
sacrifice fly.
TWO MORE crossed the plate
in the eighth inning on a double
by Cox. a walk to Post, an in
field error, Thacher’s infield sin
gle, and Warren Newell’s ground
out.
In splitting the series, Stanford
lost a chance to end the season
with Stanford’s best-ever baseball
record. The Indians finished with
an 8-8 CIBA mark and a 24-11 sea
son’s record, the best at Stanford
since the 1956 team’s 24-10.
