# Porter Sets SU Frosh Record
## 
### 
The competition in the Coli
seum Relays Friday night was
too much for the Stanford Indi
ans. And the competition in the
Northern California Relays Sat
urday was not attractive enough
for most of them to enter.
Actually, Coach Payton Jordan
decided to hold out from the Nor-
Cal meet most of the men he is
counting on to win points in the
AAWU track and field champion
ships next week at Berkeley. A
weekend off after eight consecu
tive weeks of competition pro
vides a welcome period of rest
for most of the Indians, especial
ly for those recovering from mi
nor Injuries, such as Paul
Schlicke
NEVERTHELESS, some of Jor
dan’s top men did compete, al
though two of them were in un
usual events. Quartermiler Ken
Emanuels ran the 100- and 220-
yard dashes, while two-miler
Weym Kirkland ran the mile.
The meet's most noteworthy
occurance, however, from Stan
ford’s point of view was the jave
lin toss by freshman George
Porter of 220-9*4. It broke Bud
Held's Stanford freshman record
by nearly eight feet (212-10). Por
ter’s previous best was 210-9.
Another Stanford freshman,
Dave Deubner, ran an excellent
three-mile to win in 14:15.3.
IN LOS ANGELES, most of the
greatest performers in American
track and field gathered Friday
night in the Coliseum, for one
of the best meets of the season.
Stanford's best joined in but in
most cases was substantially out
classed. The exceptions, who
placed, were Dave Weill, Harry
McCalla, and the two-mile relay
team of Harlan Andrews, Robin
Ruble, Bill Pratt, and Bob Miltz.
Weill threw the discus 184-4,
good for fourth place. McCalla
ran a 3000-meter steeplechase of
8:59.6 for a third place. And the
two-mile quartet finished third in
7:27.8.
However, the winning marks in
most events were well beyond the
potentials and even the hopes of
most of Stanford’s bests. Boh
Hayes, formerly of Florida A&M.
ran a great sprint double of 9.3
and 20.8. In the mile. Peter Snell
of New Zealand, the world's rec
ord holder, ran 4:00.3 to barely
nip Dyrol Burleson, formerly of
Oregon, who was clocked in the
same time.
