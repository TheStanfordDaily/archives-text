The question, “Who's Afraid of
I Baroque Music?" will b(> answer
ed today by Dr. George Houle at
4:30 in Tresidder in the Monday
' Coffee Hour Lecture, sponsored

! sidder.
Houle, a Stanford graduate will
I attempt to widen the general lis
j tener’s concept of the term “Ba
j roque music.” He will focus his
discussion on musical details and
| style. Houle secs a relationship
between Baroque and modern
composers in that both groups
have rebelled against a long rou
tine of static composition in or
der to develop new forms in
which to express the tensions of
their respective ages. The free
dom and expressiveness of Ba
roque music led to the develop
ment of an opera in which the
words were fitted to the music,
rather than the music fitted to
the words.
