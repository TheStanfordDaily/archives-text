Soviet border guards held up an Army convoy for three hours and
45 minutes with demands that the soldiers leave their vehicles to bo
counted at Soviet checkpoints, a U.S. Army spokesman announced.
Sunday’s convoy was cleared by the Soviets when American officers
went to the Russian checkpoints at each end of the 110-mile highway
through East Germany and insisted on the right to pass. Focusing
additional attention on the Berlin area, the Soviet Union made public
yesterday a charge that the friendship treaty between West Ger
many and France is a militarist pact that “reeks of gunpowder.”
Tass news agency released the text of a Soviet note delivered to the
French Embassy on Friday. Tass said it rejected a French note of
March 30 which explained the French-German pact as a peaceful
one. “France is already playing the part of a sort of barrier, behind
the cover of which the militarist forces of West Germany can devote
themselves wholly to the preparation of now military ventures,” the
note said.
