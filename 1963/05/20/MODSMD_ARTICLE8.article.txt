# Is Big Spring Football 'Rush' For Frosh Players Justified?

### NORM REITZ 
(Editors’ Note: This is the see

What is life like for the 60
freshmen that come to Stanford
with the intention of participating
in football? And how do they
react and adjust to their new
situation?

DWIGHT CLARK, Dean of
Freshmen Men, says that the fresh
man athlete experiences a “lime
bind.” He spends time practicing
and playing, ho might work in the
Corp Yard and he very likely
hashes for his board. And he is
physically tired when he tries to
study.

A psychological setback is faced,
Clark says, because there is a dif
ference between the status of the
football player in high school and
at Stanford. The star quarter
back is no longer the only celeb
rity on campus. And most of the
high school heroes do not do as
well against the tough competi
tion they face in college.
“The team is regarded as the
primary affiliation,” Clark stales,
and “this robs them of some of
the most useful freshman experi
ences.” They identify less with
their house in Wilbur and with
their class.
COACH WALSH offers another
viewpoint on the demands that
are placed on the freshman foot
ball player. He says that the ob
ligation to football gives a fresh-

man an added incentive to excel
in all areas, along the lines of the
maxim—‘When much is demanded
much will ho given.’ And Welsh
notes that freshman football prac
tice does not start until the fresh
man has had several weeks to ad
just to other aspects of college
life.
Though I lie freshman football
player faces a more difficult per
iod of adjustment than the normal
student he usually survives and
gains composure and self-confi
dence. The four year record of
football players, kept by the Ad
missions Office, shows that foot
ball and studies can bo combined:
1) their GPA's arc on par with the
all men’s average, 2) a greater
percentage of football players
than regular students graduate
and 3) over 50 per cent go to
graduate school; they are even
given 'plus points’ in graduate
school admissions because they
are considered to be highly or
ganized and highly motivated.
The attitude towards the coach
is an important factor in deter
mining the morale of the team
which in turn is important to the
adjustment of the individual
freshman. From all reports the
attitude towards th e current
coaching staff is one of respect
and friendship.
The freshman football program,
and athletics in general, is justi
fied, in the words of Coach Walsh,
because, “We feel it is important
for the University to be repre
sented in all areas—one of which
is athletics.”

percentage of football players

and 3) over 50 per cent go to
graduate school; they are even
given 'plus points’ in graduate
school admissions because they
are considered to be highly or

The attitude towards the coach
is an important factor in deter
mining the morale of the team
which in turn is important to the
adjustment of the individual
freshman. From all reports the
attitude towards th e current
coaching staff is one of respect
and friendship.
The freshman football program,

because, “We feel it is important
for the University to be repre

is athletics.”

What is life like for the 60
freshmen that come to Stanford
with the intention of participating
in football? And how do they
react and adjust to their new
situation?

DWIGHT CLARK, Dean of
Freshmen Men, says that the fresh
man athlete experiences a “lime
bind.” He spends time practicing
and playing, ho might work in the
Corp Yard and he very likely
hashes for his board. And he is
physically tired when he tries to
study.

A psychological setback is faced,
Clark says, because there is a dif
ference between the status of the
football player in high school and
at Stanford. The star quarter
back is no longer the only celeb
rity on campus. And most of the
high school heroes do not do as
well against the tough competi
tion they face in college.
“The team is regarded as the
primary affiliation,” Clark stales,
and “this robs them of some of
the most useful freshman experi
ences.” They identify less with
their house in Wilbur and with
their class.
COACH WALSH offers another
viewpoint on the demands that
are placed on the freshman foot
ball player. He says that the ob
ligation to football gives a fresh-

man an added incentive to excel
in all areas, along the lines of the
maxim—‘When much is demanded
much will ho given.’ And Welsh
notes that freshman football prac
tice does not start until the fresh
man has had several weeks to ad
just to other aspects of college
life.
Though I lie freshman football
player faces a more difficult per
iod of adjustment than the normal
student he usually survives and
gains composure and self-confi
dence. The four year record of
football players, kept by the Ad
missions Office, shows that foot
ball and studies can bo combined:
1) their GPA's arc on par with the
all men’s average, 2) a greater
percentage of football players
than regular students graduate
and 3) over 50 per cent go to
