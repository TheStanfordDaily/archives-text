### ROBERT NAYLOR 
William Randolph Hearst Jr. and Chester Bowles will speak
today, opening a three-day Foreign Policy Institute program on
“The Sino-Soviet Conflict—lts Impact on U.S. Foreign Policy.”
II earst, who has interviewed Russia’s four major leaders, will talk
about “The Russian Attitude toward the Sino-Soviet Conflict,” at

4:15 p.m. in Cubberley Auditori
um. Bowlos, newly-named am
bassador to India, will speak on
“The Sino-Soviet Impact on the

Hearst, Editor-in-Chief of the
Hearst Publications, was the or
ganizer of the Hearst Task Forces
reporting on international rela
tions and led the first Task Force
to the Soviet Union in 1955 where
the group succeeded in interview
ing for the first time top Commu
nist leaders behind the Iron Cur
tain, including Khrushchev, Bul
ganin. and Molotov.
FOR THE SERIFS of articles
resulting from that visit, Hearst
received the Pulitzer Prize for

Journalism in 1956 and was
awarded the Overseas Press Club
Award in 1958. He has made six
subsequent trips to the Soviet
Union with the Hearst Task
Force since 1955, meeting Pre
mier Khrushchev more times
than any other American civilian.
Hearst believes that the fact
that Russia and China are at dif
ferent stages in development and
have a "marked difference in na
tional temperament” could bo a
"wedge that splits the two powers
apart.”
Bowles entered government in
1936 as Director of the Office of
Price Administration after a suc
cessful career as an advertising
executive. He went on to become
head of the Office of Economic
Stabilization under Truman, Am
bassador to India under Truman,
Governor of Connecticut, and
Congressman from Connecticut.
BOWLES WORKED actively
for Kennedy’s nomination and
election and was appointed Under
Secretary of State in 1961. Cur
rently President Kennedy’s Spe
cial Representative for African,
Asian, and Latin American Af
fairs, he was recently appointed
Ambassador to India.
Bowles said yesterday he thinks
Red China is trying to “press the
Soviet Union into giving them
very massive economic help.”
Bowles drew an overflow crowd
when ho spoke at Stanford two
years ago; for that reason, Stan
ford students and faculty will be
admitted exclusively until 8 at
which time the doors will open
to (he general public. Admission
to Bowles’ speech is 50 cents;
seminar registrants are entitled
