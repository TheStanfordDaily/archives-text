# Philosophy Tutorial Program Removes Barriers for Exceptional Students
## 
### MARILYN P. FRYE (Second of a Two-Part Series 
In philosophy, and in other areas of the
humanities, the quantity of multiple course
work which is demanded by the quarter sys
tem may often result in an education which
is too dispersed to be thorough and to allow
the student to have really mastered any part
of his main field.
Also, such ordinary course work does not
usually encourage the students and faculty
to work closely together (a standard com
plaint at Stanford). The Tutorial Program in
Philosophy was conceived partly in the in
terest of removing these barriers to educa-

tion.
IN RECOGNITION of the interest some
students have in devoting a largo block of
time to the study of one or two philosophers
or of one particular philosophical problem,
the Philosophy Department offers the junior
and senior tutorials as an opportunity for
the students to discuss and study at length
matters of philosophical interest with staff
members.
Since the tutorials consist primarily of
guided independent study, they offer to the
student an atmosphere of small group dis
cussion or directed faculty attention which
is essential to careful textual interpretation

or sound original research.
The student receives both the guidance
and the encouragement which can help him
educate himself to become an independent
scholar—an end which is virtually ignored
if his training consists only of class work
and participation in relatively large semi
nars.
THE FUTURE of the tutorial program
looks even more promising in terms of com
bining both depth and breadth of undergrad
uate education. The department is consider
ing the possibility of lapping the resources
of other departments, such as English, His
tory, and Classics, by enlisting the help of

faculty members who might give lectures
for junior and senior informal seminars.
The purpose of such informal gatherings
would bo partly to facilitate exchange of
ideas among the seniors who are working
independently and partly to help the stu
dents see their subjects in a broader perspec
tive of classical and modern scholarship.
THE CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS of the
program is amply demonstrated by the quan
tity of very fine work which participating
students have produced. By demanding a
great deal of the intelligence and discipline
of the students, the tutorial work challenges
them to draw upon a far larger part of their

talent and creativity than the average Stan
ford student may even recognize in him
self.
Since participation is entirely voluntary',
the wishes of the student who judges that
such work is not conducive to his own best
educational interest are also honored.
The philosophy tutorial program is still
a flexible one whose organization is con
stantly being adapted to the needs and pref
erence of both the students and the faculty,
but even as it stands it may serve as an ex
ample which might be emulated, with appro
priate alterations, by other parts of the
School of Humanities.

IN RECOGNITION of the interest some
students have in devoting a largo block of
time to the study of one or two philosophers
or of one particular philosophical problem,
the Philosophy Department offers the junior
and senior tutorials as an opportunity for
the students to discuss and study at length
matters of philosophical interest with staff
members.
Since the tutorials consist primarily of
guided independent study, they offer to the
student an atmosphere of small group dis
cussion or directed faculty attention which
is essential to careful textual interpretation

or sound original research.
The student receives both the guidance
and the encouragement which can help him
educate himself to become an independent
scholar—an end which is virtually ignored
if his training consists only of class work
and participation in relatively large semi
nars.
THE FUTURE of the tutorial program
looks even more promising in terms of com
bining both depth and breadth of undergrad
uate education. The department is consider
ing the possibility of lapping the resources
of other departments, such as English, His
tory, and Classics, by enlisting the help of

faculty members who might give lectures
for junior and senior informal seminars.
The purpose of such informal gatherings
would bo partly to facilitate exchange of
ideas among the seniors who are working
independently and partly to help the stu
dents see their subjects in a broader perspec
tive of classical and modern scholarship.
THE CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS of the
program is amply demonstrated by the quan
tity of very fine work which participating
students have produced. By demanding a
great deal of the intelligence and discipline
of the students, the tutorial work challenges
them to draw upon a far larger part of their

talent and creativity than the average Stan
ford student may even recognize in him
self.
Since participation is entirely voluntary',
the wishes of the student who judges that
such work is not conducive to his own best
educational interest are also honored.
The philosophy tutorial program is still
a flexible one whose organization is con
stantly being adapted to the needs and pref
erence of both the students and the faculty,
but even as it stands it may serve as an ex
ample which might be emulated, with appro
priate alterations, by other parts of the
School of Humanities.
In philosophy, and in other areas of the
humanities, the quantity of multiple course
work which is demanded by the quarter sys
tem may often result in an education which
is too dispersed to be thorough and to allow
the student to have really mastered any part
of his main field.
Also, such ordinary course work does not
usually encourage the students and faculty
to work closely together (a standard com
plaint at Stanford). The Tutorial Program in
Philosophy was conceived partly in the in
terest of removing these barriers to educa-

tion.
