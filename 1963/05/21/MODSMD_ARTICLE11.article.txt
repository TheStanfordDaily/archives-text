# Bowles Declares Russia Cannot Dominate World
## 
### KATHY FARGO 
Russia, strong as she is, cannot do what she set out to do—
dominate the world.
That’s what Chester Bowles, newly appointed ambassador to
India, told the Foreign Policy Institute last night.

Before a small audience at M(
that contrasted sharply with the
packed house that greeted him
two years ago—Bowles declared:
“The question is whether our
society is relevant to the world of
tomorrow. Can we become a part
of this world? Can we participate
actively in the revolution of hu
man dignity and opportunity that
is taking place in the newly form
ing nations?”
“THE U.S. has become frus
trated,” Bowles continued, “be
cause the world won't stand still
and because it doesn’t always
seem to behave the way we think
it should.”
Since 1945 the world has wit
nessed some of its greatest
changes, he said, and each change
seems to be feeding the next one.
“The world situation is much
more complex than simply a
struggle between the U.S. and
the U.S.S.R.”
Bowles pointed out that Russia
has grown tremendously in the
past few years to become “a pow
erful, sophisticated nation,” but
she faces many problems within
her society. She faces the impos
sible task of educating her people
and still controlling their think
ing.
“THERE IS the difficulty of
increasing the standard of living
and at the same time carrying
out their heavy' military, indus
trial and foreign policy pro
grams.” Bowles said. “Maintain
ing their ideology only by con
structing walls and using aid as a
force of persuasion is another
problem.”
And not the least of their trou
bles is China, he added. Bowles
sees China’s economic problem as
the key to its ideological split
with the U.S.S.R.
Bowles said that Mao Tse Tung
might he thinking of re-establish
ing relations with Russia in or
der to get aid. Bowles thinks it
is improbable, though, that the
U.S.S.R. would build up China
through aid to have it later rise
up against her.
CHINA’S OTHER alternative,
he said, is to expand into South
east Asia, and she can only ac
quire this area through war.
“Because they are boxed in like
this with problems,” Bowles
stated, “China will be much more
dangerous and just as hard to
live with in the next few years.”
“But what about us?” Bowles
challenged. “Is our ideology go
ing to be relevant to tomorrow’s
world? We’ve one far, but we’ve
only gone half way. How fully
committed are we to the world
around us?”
Ho also said: “Our relevance to
the future depends on throe
things. It first depends on how
well we understand people. We
must bo able to understand people
in poorer parts of the world and
people whose ideas may seem rad
ical to us. Every great leader in
this country has frightened his
contemporaries.
“Second, it depends on our abil
ity to sharpen our tools of for
eign affairs and policy, to build
nations that will stand on their
own feet but will not necessarily
agree with us.
“Our relevance depends also on
how good our society is here at
home—on the strength of our
economy and on our role as a
democracy.”

more complex than simply a
struggle between the U.S. and
the U.S.S.R.”
Bowles pointed out that Russia
has grown tremendously in the
past few years to become “a pow
erful, sophisticated nation,” but
she faces many problems within
her society. She faces the impos
sible task of educating her people
and still controlling their think
ing.
“THERE IS the difficulty of
increasing the standard of living
and at the same time carrying
out their heavy' military, indus
trial and foreign policy pro
grams.” Bowles said. “Maintain
ing their ideology only by con
structing walls and using aid as a
force of persuasion is another
problem.”
And not the least of their trou
bles is China, he added. Bowles
sees China’s economic problem as
the key to its ideological split
with the U.S.S.R.
Bowles said that Mao Tse Tung
might he thinking of re-establish
ing relations with Russia in or
der to get aid. Bowles thinks it
is improbable, though, that the
U.S.S.R. would build up China
through aid to have it later rise
up against her.
CHINA’S OTHER alternative,
he said, is to expand into South
east Asia, and she can only ac
quire this area through war.
“Because they are boxed in like
this with problems,” Bowles
stated, “China will be much more
dangerous and just as hard to
live with in the next few years.”
“But what about us?” Bowles
challenged. “Is our ideology go
ing to be relevant to tomorrow’s
world? We’ve one far, but we’ve
only gone half way. How fully
committed are we to the world
around us?”
Ho also said: “Our relevance to
the future depends on throe
things. It first depends on how
well we understand people. We
must bo able to understand people
in poorer parts of the world and
people whose ideas may seem rad
ical to us. Every great leader in
this country has frightened his
contemporaries.
“Second, it depends on our abil
ity to sharpen our tools of for
eign affairs and policy, to build
nations that will stand on their
own feet but will not necessarily
agree with us.
“Our relevance depends also on
how good our society is here at
home—on the strength of our
economy and on our role as a
democracy.”

emoriul Auditorium—an audience
Russia, strong as she is, cannot do what she set out to do—
dominate the world.
That’s what Chester Bowles, newly appointed ambassador to
India, told the Foreign Policy Institute last night.

Before a small audience at M(
that contrasted sharply with the
packed house that greeted him
two years ago—Bowles declared:
“The question is whether our
society is relevant to the world of
tomorrow. Can we become a part
of this world? Can we participate
actively in the revolution of hu
man dignity and opportunity that
is taking place in the newly form
ing nations?”
“THE U.S. has become frus
trated,” Bowles continued, “be
cause the world won't stand still
and because it doesn’t always
seem to behave the way we think
it should.”
Since 1945 the world has wit
nessed some of its greatest
changes, he said, and each change
seems to be feeding the next one.
“The world situation is much
more complex than simply a
struggle between the U.S. and
the U.S.S.R.”
