# Red Chief Moving To Right, Claims William R. Hearst
## 
### PELL FENDER 
Soviet Premier Khrushchev has
grown more conservative since
1957, William Randolph Hearst Jr.
head of Hearst Newspapers, told
an audience in Cubberley Audi
torium yesterday. His speech
opened the Foreign Policy Insti
tute’s program on ‘‘The Sino-
Soviet Conflict Its Impact on
U.S. Foreign Policy.”
Hearst related his observations
of the Soviet Union, which he
visited in 1955 and 1957 with two
other newsmen.
In 1955, he stated, there were
signs of a Sino-Soviet strain.
Shots were being fired over Que
moy and Matsu, and Molotov sug-

gested that an American evacua
tion of these islands would bo pos
sible. According to Hearst, this
indicated two things: the Rus
sians had some control and lever
age of Chinese policy, and Que
moy and Matsu looked “very
small as real estate” from both
Moscow’s and Washington’s point
of view.
DURING HIS 1957 visit, Hearst
attended the celebration of the
October Revolution in Moscow.
At the same time Mao Tse Tung
was attracting “his own court in
a corner of the hall,” Hearst said.
“I don’t believe Mao ever hailed
Khrushchev as the leader of his
Communism,” he added.
Hearst pointed out that today,
while the Russians are assuming
basically conciliatory attitudes in
international relations, China is
trying to “tell the Soviet Union
about Communism.”
Peiping Marxist philosophy has
support in hungry young coun
tries, Hearst said, for it states
that co-existence is impossible
without reverting to force, and
that war could moan the extinc
tion of imperialism.
SINCE Khrushchev has tailored
Marxism to the realities of a nu
clear age, war is out for Khru
shchev, I’m convinced.”
China has called itself the
“true” Communist country. Yet
China may not be able to get
along without Russian economic
aid, Hearst continued. If this is
true, then the west will be con
fronted once more with a united
Communist front.
“I guess that Khrushchev will
do all right in controlling the
Chinese,” staled Hearst, “but the
U.S. government should not in
trude in what is essentially a
family affair.”
For his articles on his visits to
Russia. Hearst received the Pu
litzer Prize (1956) and the Over
seas Press Club Award (1958).

Soviet Premier Khrushchev has
grown more conservative since
1957, William Randolph Hearst Jr.
head of Hearst Newspapers, told
an audience in Cubberley Audi
torium yesterday. His speech
opened the Foreign Policy Insti
tute’s program on ‘‘The Sino-
Soviet Conflict Its Impact on
U.S. Foreign Policy.”
Hearst related his observations
of the Soviet Union, which he
visited in 1955 and 1957 with two
other newsmen.
In 1955, he stated, there were
signs of a Sino-Soviet strain.
Shots were being fired over Que
moy and Matsu, and Molotov sug-

gested that an American evacua
tion of these islands would bo pos
sible. According to Hearst, this
indicated two things: the Rus
sians had some control and lever
age of Chinese policy, and Que
moy and Matsu looked “very
small as real estate” from both
Moscow’s and Washington’s point
of view.
DURING HIS 1957 visit, Hearst
attended the celebration of the
October Revolution in Moscow.
At the same time Mao Tse Tung
was attracting “his own court in
a corner of the hall,” Hearst said.
“I don’t believe Mao ever hailed
Khrushchev as the leader of his
Communism,” he added.
Hearst pointed out that today,
while the Russians are assuming
basically conciliatory attitudes in
international relations, China is
trying to “tell the Soviet Union
about Communism.”
Peiping Marxist philosophy has
support in hungry young coun
tries, Hearst said, for it states
that co-existence is impossible
without reverting to force, and
that war could moan the extinc
tion of imperialism.
