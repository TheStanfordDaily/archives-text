# Football Rush'
## 
### 
At the end of each football season, an intensive and ex
pensive recruitment program is held by the Department of
Athletics to encourage promising high school football stars
to come to Stanford. Stanford uses only “accepted (By NCAA
rules)” practices to encourage the boys to come to Stanford:
offering scholarship aid upon application and campus tours
“to show what the school has to offer” once they have been
accepted.
It is doubtful that these prospective football players gain
a full picture of the University when so much emphasis is
placed on athletic activities rather than on academic work. It
would be easy for them to form the impression that, although
academic work is part of life at Stanford, it is subordinate to
athletics.
Once the freshman gets to Stanford, he will spend so much
time in practice and other connected activities that he is
likely to lose out on many house, class, academic and extra
curricular activities that are on important part of his educa
tion. Although the athletic development of students must not
be neglected in plans for a well-rounded education, it should
not be allowed to overshadow the activities which are essen
tial to a complete education.
It is a questionable whether or not such large expenditures
of energy and finances are justified. The fact that the expense
to the University and the Athletic Department is returned
partly by gate receipts, etc., does not justify this expense. The
money could be used in other ways both inside and outside
the Athletic Department.
Although high school students who excelled specifically in
academic pursuits are encouraged to come to the University,
there is not the same type of pressure put upon them as is put
upon good athletes. An exceptional science student is not in
vited out for the weekend to see the Linear Accelerator and
the head of the physics department does not travel across the
country to persuade him to come to Stanford. Surely, the good
science student fulfills the aims of an educationel institution
better than the good athlete and as much effort should be ex
pended to encourage him to attend the University.
The University should reconsider its football “rushing”
program and try to determine if it fulfills the goals of a
university dedicated to giving a fidl education.
