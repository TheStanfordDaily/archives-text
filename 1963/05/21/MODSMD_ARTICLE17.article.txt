## Japan's Economy Growing 
### YOSHIKI SUGA ASSU Scholar from Japan 
(Editors’ note: This is the second of a two-part series.)

What made Japan able to achieve the miracle? The gov
ernment did not have a sufficiently positive plan like the five or
ten year Soviet Economic Plan. The present Liberal Democratic
Party in power is willing to advocate the correctness and proper
ness of their policies, but the truth may be that the Japanese
economy itself has its own upward swings.
The first important factor is the change of the people’s
attitude toward life. Before the war their efforts were directed
merely toward the contribution to the Japanese Empire. They
worked hard, but directed toward nationalistic, totalitarian ends.
They find now much more pleasure in working for themselves
and relaxing themselves than they did before in working for
the nation.
That is why Japan has created the mass consumer market
in her own country. Before the war they could not sell in a domes
tic market, reaching soon its “bottleneck of the people’s buying
capacity. It is reported that only the United States has more con
sumer goods per family than they have. Every four out of five
families are supplied with TV sets.
Probably it is the Japanese and the Germans who felt the
most the vainness of war and (he meaninglessness of fighitng;
concentrating whole national energy in to war.
Secondly, high investment rate can be pointed out. Year
after year the Japanese have put more than a quarter of their
national income into investment. Japanese hanks are unique in
the point that they loan out more than 93 per cent of the deposit.
When economists find this figure they are all surprised and
ask how they do not go bankrupt. A student who ever studied
economics knows how a bank creates money and it depends on
the loan-out rate.
Thirdly, education is pointed out. Throughout Japan they can
not find any illiterate people and every third or fourth young
man of twenty is now in college. Only the U.S. and Israel have
a larger proportion of their young people in higher education
than Japan.
But Japan has still problems to solve. The first one is the
“life time employment’’ problem, which is quite unique to
Japan. Once a person is employed at the age, say, 20, he usually
never changes his job throughout his life. His salary is
decided by the length of time he has been at the company,
not by his ability. They cannot get higher position if there are
older people in a company. Their salary goes up as they get old
though they start a very simple job, which is sometimes irrele
vant to what they learned at college. So the efficiency of labor is
terribly bad. That is the main reason why in Japan labor costs
very high except in highly advanced industries; almost two or
three times as high on almost any manufactured item as they
do in the U.S. and Europe.
Politically, the Liberal Democratic Party at every election
wins and looks stable, but not satisfactory to the whole nation.
The Socialist Party is divided into two groups, one believing in
democratic process and the other in drastic change to attain
their goal, and can never gain more than one-third of the seats.
The Communist Party is not now a strong party, with only 2 in
both houses and less than 3 per cent of the total votes in the last
three year election.
