Editors, The Daily:
For years college students concerned with the problems of
racial equality have suffered frustration because they have
found no constructive way by which equably could be promoted.
Many students' efforts to date have been platitudinous and im
potent. despite their good intentions. Yet the answer has always
been present; until recently we have failed to see it or take
action on it. That answer is large-scale education for racial mi
norities, and it is now being applied by diligent students through
out the country.
Last year a number of eastern college students banded to
gether to formulate plans for educational projects to be admin
istered in depressed areas like Harlem. The Northern Student
Movement, as this new organization was called, first adminis
tered educational projects in the summer of 1962, involving two
hundred fifty college students in programs in North Phila
delphia and Harlem. As pilot projects, these initial efforts were
successful: they were also, however, extremely limited.
Since September, 1962, educational work with racial minori
ties has been greatly increased. The NSM’s summer projects
in Philadelphia and Harlem have been extended through this
academic year with fulltime student direction. Large tutorial
programs administered by volunteer students have also been
developed in Hartford and Boston. In addition, another twenty
five eastern campus groups have initiated educational programs
in their local communities. Thus, since September, some eighteen
hundred college students have become involved in educational
programs servicing three thousand secondary school students.
Their budget for the 1962-63 was $118,980, financed by founda
tion support.
The problems of racial minorities in Southern California,
and especially in Los Angeles, need not be detailed. What needs
to be emphasized is that we can help alleviate thpse problems by
promoting the education, and thus the opportunity, of'thofee op
pressed by reason of race, colop, and economic environment
To this end we have formed the embryonic structure of a
"Southwestern Student Movement.”
This summer the Human Relations Council of Pomona Col
lege, in conjunction with other college students living or working
in Los Angeles, will administer a tutorial program in the Mid-
City school district. Mr. Isaac H. McClelland, principal of Jordan
High School, has been working with the project for the past
year. He has acquired funds for its administration, classroom
facilities for afternoons and evenings, and the service of a full
time teacher. College students involved in the program will
tutor remedial as well as advanced students on a volunteer basis,
and we hope that students from Stanford will join with us in this
pilot project.
Stanford students, who will live or work in the Los Angeles
area and would like to devote part of their time to tutoring, are
urged to apply either by filling out applications which may be
obtained in the ASSU Office, or by writing directly to the Hu
man Relations Council indicating major, year in college, experi
ence, and hours open for tutoring. Experience in tutoring is not
necessary. Applications should be sent to Michael P. Wood,
Executive Director, Human Relations Council, Pomona College,
Claremont, California. Students submitting applications will
immediately bo sent further details concerning training pro
grams to be held at the beginning of the summer.
The purposes of our pilot project for this summer are
threefold. First we hope to contribute substantially to the edu
cation of racial minorities. Second, by implicating many students
from colleges and universities in Southern California we hope to
encourage students to begin educational projects in depressed
areas near their own colleges. Third, we hope to establish the
basis for a central coordinating council for all educational proj
ects administered by campus groups in local communities during
the academic year, as well as for future summer projects in
Southern California. Once we have accomplished this third goal,
we should be able to attract, sizable foundation support.

It is unfortunate that Dr. Osborne has entirely misinter
preted the Stanford Area Young Republicans’ censure of Sena
tor Thomas H. Kuchel.
What we object to is not the Senator’s condemnation of
Gerald L. K. Smith and like individuals, who should rightfully
be denounced by every American, be he conservative or liberal,
but his equation of Smith with the entire conservative movement
by a cleverly concocted implication. (See Congressional Record,
pp. 7215-21.)
No true representative of the Republican Party can ever
blast those of responsible conservative inclination, either openly
or subtly, and expect the Party to remain united. Perhaps Sena
tor Kuchel, fearing for his job, wants to divide the Republican
Party and, thereby, conquer it.

programs administered by volunteer students have also been
developed in Hartford and Boston. In addition, another twenty
five eastern campus groups have initiated educational programs
in their local communities. Thus, since September, some eighteen
hundred college students have become involved in educational
programs servicing three thousand secondary school students.
Their budget for the 1962-63 was $118,980, financed by founda
tion support.
The problems of racial minorities in Southern California,
and especially in Los Angeles, need not be detailed. What needs
to be emphasized is that we can help alleviate thpse problems by
promoting the education, and thus the opportunity, of'thofee op
pressed by reason of race, colop, and economic environment
To this end we have formed the embryonic structure of a
"Southwestern Student Movement.”
This summer the Human Relations Council of Pomona Col
lege, in conjunction with other college students living or working
in Los Angeles, will administer a tutorial program in the Mid-
City school district. Mr. Isaac H. McClelland, principal of Jordan
High School, has been working with the project for the past
year. He has acquired funds for its administration, classroom
facilities for afternoons and evenings, and the service of a full
time teacher. College students involved in the program will
tutor remedial as well as advanced students on a volunteer basis,
and we hope that students from Stanford will join with us in this
pilot project.
Stanford students, who will live or work in the Los Angeles
area and would like to devote part of their time to tutoring, are
urged to apply either by filling out applications which may be
obtained in the ASSU Office, or by writing directly to the Hu
man Relations Council indicating major, year in college, experi
ence, and hours open for tutoring. Experience in tutoring is not
necessary. Applications should be sent to Michael P. Wood,
Executive Director, Human Relations Council, Pomona College,
Claremont, California. Students submitting applications will
immediately bo sent further details concerning training pro
grams to be held at the beginning of the summer.
The purposes of our pilot project for this summer are
threefold. First we hope to contribute substantially to the edu
cation of racial minorities. Second, by implicating many students
from colleges and universities in Southern California we hope to
encourage students to begin educational projects in depressed
areas near their own colleges. Third, we hope to establish the
basis for a central coordinating council for all educational proj
ects administered by campus groups in local communities during
the academic year, as well as for future summer projects in
Southern California. Once we have accomplished this third goal,
we should be able to attract, sizable foundation support.

It is unfortunate that Dr. Osborne has entirely misinter
preted the Stanford Area Young Republicans’ censure of Sena
tor Thomas H. Kuchel.
What we object to is not the Senator’s condemnation of
Gerald L. K. Smith and like individuals, who should rightfully
be denounced by every American, be he conservative or liberal,
but his equation of Smith with the entire conservative movement
by a cleverly concocted implication. (See Congressional Record,
pp. 7215-21.)
No true representative of the Republican Party can ever
blast those of responsible conservative inclination, either openly
or subtly, and expect the Party to remain united. Perhaps Sena
tor Kuchel, fearing for his job, wants to divide the Republican
Party and, thereby, conquer it.

For years college students concerned with the problems of
racial equality have suffered frustration because they have
found no constructive way by which equably could be promoted.
Many students' efforts to date have been platitudinous and im
potent. despite their good intentions. Yet the answer has always
been present; until recently we have failed to see it or take
action on it. That answer is large-scale education for racial mi
norities, and it is now being applied by diligent students through
out the country.
Last year a number of eastern college students banded to
gether to formulate plans for educational projects to be admin
istered in depressed areas like Harlem. The Northern Student
Movement, as this new organization was called, first adminis
tered educational projects in the summer of 1962, involving two
hundred fifty college students in programs in North Phila
delphia and Harlem. As pilot projects, these initial efforts were
successful: they were also, however, extremely limited.
Since September, 1962, educational work with racial minori
ties has been greatly increased. The NSM’s summer projects
in Philadelphia and Harlem have been extended through this
academic year with fulltime student direction. Large tutorial
