### MARTHA MASKALL 
The Biology 20 series at Stanford will he replaced next year
by a new core curriculum designed primarily for majors in bi-

ology.
I3r. Victor Twitty, head of the biology department, announced
today that the new sequence, Biology JO to 15, will be initiated in

♦ 1963-64 with Biology 10, 11, and
i 12 replacing Biology 20, 21, and
122. During the transition year,
I Biology 23. 24, and 25 will bo of
j fered to those who have already
begun the 20 series.
In 1964-65, Biology 13, 14, and
15 will be given for the first lime,
and Biology 23. 24. and 25 will be
revised or replaced. Biology 23
will be offered as a course in ver
tebrate biology.
THE BIOLOGY 1, 2, 3 series
will still be offered in its present
form for general studies students.
The new curriculum is the re
sult of a two-year study by a
committee of seven biology pro
fessors. Members of the commit
tee are Dr. Clifford Grobstein,
chairman, and Drs, Donald Ab
bott, Richard Holm, Donald Ken
nedy, Robert Page, and David
Regnery.
The 10 series, which will have
as a prerequisite general college
chemistry, will consist of six one
quarter courses, each of which
will be five units. The sequence
will normally be taken in the pre
scribed sequence and initiated in
the sophomore year.
ACCORDING TO Grobstein,
the curriculum is designed to
“present facts and concepts
which are the common currency
of biological understanding, and
the accepted foundation for all
biological understanding, and the
accepted foundation for all bio
logical specialties.” The entire
series will be required of biology
I majors, and it will be recom
j mended for pre-medical students
who are not biology majors.
The new sequence will begin
with Biology 10, a concentrated
j introduction to the series which
1 is intended to provide an overall
I view and a foundation for later
j work. Biology 10 will involve lec
t turns, reading, demonstrations
and discussions, but no individual
laboratory work.
Biology 11 and 12 will deal with
the biology of organisms, the for
mer of plants, and latter of ani
mals. Emphasis will be on the
common properties of organisms
is functioning systems adapting
to other organisms and the physi
cal environment.
Biology 13 to 15 will examine
i the living world at successively
' higher levels of analysis.
