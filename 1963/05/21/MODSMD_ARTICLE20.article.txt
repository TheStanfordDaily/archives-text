# Frosh in 1st Loss; Varsity Places 6th
## 
### 
The Washington Huskies
proved that they're the best col
legiate crew on the coast last
Saturday by out-sprinting Cali
fornia, and Stanford’s freshmen
were beaten by Cal in the frosh
race in the Western Intercollegi
ate Rowing Championships at
Redwood City.
Stanford's varsity crew was
edged out of a spot in the final
race, but won the consolation
race handily over San Diego
State. The Indians finished sixth
overall, and fourth in the AAWU
behind Washington, Cal, UCLA.
THE FRESHMEN had previ
ously beaten every crew in the
race with the exception of fifth
place Orange Coast State, whom
they hadn’t raced. But Cal gained
revenge for their earlier quarter
length loss by whipping Stanford
by one full length. In fact, the

Ifrosh were only inches ahead of
Long Beach Stale, which finished
third. It was the first loss of the
| season for the Tribe freshmen,
they having compiled a 7-0 record

previously.
The Huskies, who had lied Cal
in a 2%-mile race in Seattle the
previous week, gradually built
up a margin of a few feet, then
won the 2000-meter race by half
a length.
SEATTLE had a great day. The
Hucky JV’s won by a 2’i--length
margin and the Lake Washing
ton Rowing Club of Seattle won
the senior fours, senior singles,
and double sculls races.
The University of British Co
lumbia, recent gold medal win
ners at the Pan American Games,

ran into rough seas. The choppy
water slowed them down enough
for Long Beach State and UCLA
to slip past (hem for third and
fourth places.
