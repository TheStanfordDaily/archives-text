# Whites Win; Ralston Worried
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Stanford’s varsity football
squad broke into two rival groups
Saturday, the Whites downing
the Reds in a practice scrimmage
by a 25-7 margin, but after the
tuneup head-coach John Ralston
was still not pleased with the
team’s progress.
Although the team’s attitude is

excellent according to Ralston the
players still lack what he calls
“team discipline,” the ability to
execute the fundamentals. Ral
ston is especially peeved by the
mistakes made on defense.

RALSTON IS impressed with
the play of quarterback Clark
Weaver, who was described as
“having the knack of being able
to move a team.” Weaver did just
that Saturday, playing for the
victorious White squad. The first
time the White gained possession
of the ball Weaver moved the
team 70 yards to a score.

Wilh Weaver shining at quar
terback, Ralston is free to em
ploy Steve Thurlow, who was the
starting quarterback for the var

sity last season, at a halfback po
sition. Thurlow has been running
well from this slot in practice and
performed adequately in Satur
day’s play.
Also impressive in Saturday’s
civil war were veteran center
Marv Harris and a pair of sopho
mores. tackle Bill Ogle and full
back Pete Mlddlekauff. Fullback
Frank Bunch made the longest
run of the day, racing 60 yards.
End Chuck McCormick played
well all game. Sophomore quar
terback Mike Connelly was a
work horse in piloting the Reds
throughout the afternoon.
Two more practice sessions and
an alumni game next Saturday
will conclude spring practice.
