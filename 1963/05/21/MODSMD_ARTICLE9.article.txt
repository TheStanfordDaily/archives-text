### 
United Press International
\VASHINGTON—In a series of milestone decisions the Supreme
Court yesterday struck down the convictions of 38 sit-in demon
strators in five southern cities, including Birmingham and Durham,
N.C., where new racial crises have arisen. The court held that the
demonstrators were arrested in 1960 and 1961 to enforce local
segregation laws and policies which weie unconstitutional. In addi
tion to the Birmingham and Durham cases, the judgment nullified
convictions in Greenville, S.C., Savannah, Ga„ and New Orleans.
Yesterday’s rulings did not say whether an individual store owner
has (he right to maintain segregated facilities because of his per
sonal wishes. The court held that because local segregation laws
were on the books, store owners had no choice but to require sep
arate white and Negro facilities.

NEGRO STUDENTS EXPELLED— BIRMINGHAM, Ala.—More
than 1,000 Negro students who played hooky to participate in civil
rights denomstrations here were expelled or suspended yesterday,
posing a new threat to the uneasy racial truce between whites and
Negroes. City school authorities sent the names of 1.098 children—
many of whom were arrested during the massive protests the week
of May 6—to neighborhood schools with instructions they should not
report for classes today. Authorities in Durham. N.C., worked until
4 a.m. (EDT) yesterday, booking more than TOO Negroes and 13
whites arrested Sunday during racial demonstrations against segre
gated schools and public accommodations such as theaters and res
taurants. Gov. Terry Sanford said the solution to current racial
problems was “good sense, and there’s plenty of that in North Caro
lina.” The uneasy truce almost came apart Sunday, May 12, when
bombs were hurled into a Negro motel and the home of integration
leader Rev. A. D. King. Bloody street fighting between white officers
and Negroes followed. One of the staff members of Dr. Martin
Luther King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference said if the
disciplinary action was taken against the students a “response”
could be expected by the intogrationists. He did not elaborate.

U.S. MAKES FINAL TARIFF PROPOSAL -GENEVA The United
Stales handed a “take-it-or-leave-it” proposal to the European Com
mon Market countries yesterday, it was reported here. The move
came as a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) con
ference called to cut tariffs tottered on the brink of failure. After
consulting President Kennedy by telephone, chief U.S. delegate
Christian A. Herter made what apparently was his final offer to the
six-nation European community. Herter maintained the U.S. view
that tariffs on goods passing between the 50 GATT nations must be
cut across the board. He rejected a Common Market proposal to
cut IHo tariffs on a sliding scale.

\VASHINGTON—In a series of milestone decisions the Supreme
Court yesterday struck down the convictions of 38 sit-in demon
strators in five southern cities, including Birmingham and Durham,
N.C., where new racial crises have arisen. The court held that the
demonstrators were arrested in 1960 and 1961 to enforce local
segregation laws and policies which weie unconstitutional. In addi
tion to the Birmingham and Durham cases, the judgment nullified
convictions in Greenville, S.C., Savannah, Ga„ and New Orleans.
Yesterday’s rulings did not say whether an individual store owner
has (he right to maintain segregated facilities because of his per
sonal wishes. The court held that because local segregation laws
were on the books, store owners had no choice but to require sep
arate white and Negro facilities.

NEGRO STUDENTS EXPELLED— BIRMINGHAM, Ala.—More
than 1,000 Negro students who played hooky to participate in civil
rights denomstrations here were expelled or suspended yesterday,
posing a new threat to the uneasy racial truce between whites and
Negroes. City school authorities sent the names of 1.098 children—
many of whom were arrested during the massive protests the week
of May 6—to neighborhood schools with instructions they should not
report for classes today. Authorities in Durham. N.C., worked until
4 a.m. (EDT) yesterday, booking more than TOO Negroes and 13
whites arrested Sunday during racial demonstrations against segre
gated schools and public accommodations such as theaters and res
taurants. Gov. Terry Sanford said the solution to current racial
problems was “good sense, and there’s plenty of that in North Caro
lina.” The uneasy truce almost came apart Sunday, May 12, when
bombs were hurled into a Negro motel and the home of integration
leader Rev. A. D. King. Bloody street fighting between white officers
and Negroes followed. One of the staff members of Dr. Martin
Luther King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference said if the
disciplinary action was taken against the students a “response”
could be expected by the intogrationists. He did not elaborate.
