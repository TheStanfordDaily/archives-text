MRA AND MR. K
Kommunist”, the Moscow organ which gives the Party Line inside the Soviet Union,
•ecently said this of Moral Re-Armament:
C 4 Tk JTORAL RE-ARMAMENT is certainly the most prominent association which aims to save Western
%/I civilization from Communism. It has staff headquarters in Europe, Asia and America. These
X j J. people hold assemblies in Latin America and even organize Pan-African conferences. . . . The
leaders of Moral Re-Armament claim it is superior to capitalism and Communism.... At a time when the
morals of the bourgeois world are bankrupt, the prophets of Moral Re-Armament say that the world requires
an ideology to satisfy the longing for absolute standards, an ideology able to move the hearts of the privileged
as well as the under-privileged.... They train officers, philosophers, film directors and move with 200, 300,
or 400 people in strength with up-to-date technical equipment, radio transmitters, libraries.... Not long ago
they issued a call to Communists through full pages in the press. In this the Communists are challenged to
take part in ‘the greatest revolution of all time/ These people say the problem is neither Communism nor
capitalism, but the necessity to change human nature to the roots. They puff themselves up with pride and
even suggest to Marxists they should change and take up an ideology that is for everybody. This is really
the most bold stroke that has come from these propagandists of reconciliation and forgiveness.”
As Mr. Khrushchev and his followers try to explain attitudes of Moral Re-Armament,
it is important to state what Moral Re-Armament is for and what it is against.
FOR AGAINST
INTELLIGENT NATIONAL SECURITY. Sexual deviants in high places who protect potential spies.
A FREE PRESS.
COMMUNISTS, FASCISTS, OTHER “ISTS”, or anybody will
ing to pay the price of changing themselves in a revolutionary bid
to change society.
Those who bully newspapermen for obeying their conscience. And
newspapermen who abuse their liberty by distorting or suppressing
news of Moral Re-Armament.
Communism, Fascism, or any small perilous “ism” which abolishes
God and sets race against race, class against class, color against
color, man against man, in an atomic age.
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA to be a pattern of unity
and purpose for the world.
Debunkers of patriotism, who decry the past, debase the present
and destroy the future; a United States which criticizes other coun
tries but is itself deeply divided.
A SOCIETY where no man is handicapped by color, race, back
ground or upbringing, all have the chance of full, satisfying life.
PEACE.
A REVOLUTION OF CIIANGE-sodal, economic, national,
universal, founded on personal change,
FULL AND PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT in industry that
meets the needs of humanity rather than brimming the pockets
of a few while the bellies of many stay void.
COD’S STANDARD OF HONESTY that means no skeletons So
any closet and a fair day’s work for a fair day’s wage.
Leaders of society and government who betray their trust, and use
influence and power to force decadence upon us—bigots who try
to persecute those unwilling to compromise or to cover up.
Pacifism, which seems to make war certain. Leaders who cry
“peace” but create conditions that lead to war. Philosophers and
fools who cry “peace” but train man to live like a beast, and so
doom him to live like a beast, treat others like beasts, and march
the path to slaughterhouse or zoo.
Reaction, which strives to change everybody else except itself.
Steely selfishness of right, acid bitterness of left which create class
war, lock-outs, unofficial strikes and lead inevitably to national
bankruptcy and war.
Human “honesty” which publishes other people’s shortcomings
while covering up its own, tells men to get as much as they can in
return for as little as possible.
GOD’S STANDARD OF ABSOLUTE PURITY. Homosexuality, lesbianism, pornography, adultery, lies which say
sin is no longer sin when enough people come to like it. Preoccupa
tion with dirt which robs a nation of sweat and skill and helps to
lose its markets.
MARRIAGES THAT LAST because they are a promise, for bet
ter, for worse, held sacred by partners and people.
GREAT ART in theater, films, television.
GOD’S STANDARD OF UNSELFISHNESS which means the
pursuit of a goal all humanity can accept and share—the remaking
of the world based on government by men governed by God.
GOD’S STANDARD OF LOVE that cures evil as well as for
giving it.
TRUTH.
GOD, CHRIST AS PERSONAL FRIEND AND SAVIOUR, a
Church aflame with the Holy Spirit.
Divorce by consent whether legalized or wangled.
Producers and critics who uplift grime as genius and bar those who
stand for decency, faith and honor.
Human selfishness that elevates “number one” into the national
idol, says all who refuse to worslup it are squares.
Human “love” that tells men evil is all right, cannot he cured and
so says there is nothing to forgive and that man can manage by
himself.
Lies invented by knaves, endorsed by the experts and swallowed
by fools, which separate a nation from moral and spiritual rebirth.
Those in and out of churches who use theology, science, personal
compromise and position to rob the nations of true faith.
