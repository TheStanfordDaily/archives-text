HOW TO SEE EUROPE
FOR ONLY $3OO A DAY: NO. 3
When all of you go to Europe during your summer vacation,
you will certainly want to visit Spain, where the tall corn grows,
The first thing you will notice upon entering Spain is the
absence of sibilants. In Spain “s'’ is pronounced “th” and
thereby hangs a tale. Until the reign of Philip IV—or (!uy
Fawkes, as he was sometimes called—Spaniards said “s” just
like everybody else. Philip IV, however, lisped, and Spaniards,
having an ingrained sense of propriety and not wishing to em
barrass their monarch, decided that everybody should lisp. This
did indeed put Philip IV very much at his case, but in the end
it turned out lo be a very bad thing for Spain. 11 wrecked the
sassafras industry—Spain's principal source of revenue—and
reduced the nation to a second-class power.

As a result, Spaniards were all forced to turn to bull fighting
in order to keep body and soul together. Today, wherever you
go in Spain—in Madrid, in Barcelona, in Toledo, in Cleveland
—you will see bulls being fought. For many years the bulls
have sought to arbitrate this long-standing dispute, but the
Spaniards, a proud people who use nothing but Castile soap,
have rejected all overtures.
It is therefore necessary for me to explain bull fighting to
anyone who is going to Spain. It is also necessary for me to
say a few words about Marlboro Cigarettes because they pay
me for writing this column, and they arc inclined to pout if 1
ignore their product. In truth, it is no chore for me to sing the
praises of Marlboro Cigarettes, for 1 am one who fairly swoons
with delight when I come upon a cigarette which gives you the
full, rich taste of good tobaccos plus the pure white Selectrate
filter, and Marlboro is the only smoke I have found that fulfills
both requirements. Oh, what a piece of work is Marlboro! The
flavor reaches you without stint or diminution. You, even as I,
will find these statements to be happily true when once you
light a Marlboro. Marl boros come to you in soft pack or Flip-
Top box, and are made only by the makers of Marlboro.
But 1 digress. Let us return to bull fighting. Bulls arc by
nature bellicose creatures who will keep fighting till the cows
come home. Then they like to put on pipe and slippers and
listen to the "Farm and Home Hour.” However, the Spaniards
w ill not allow the bulls any surcease. They keep attacking the
bull and making veronicas—a corn meal pancake filled with
ground meat. Bulls, being vegetarians, reject the veronicas
and then, believe you me, the fur starts to fly!
To be perfectly honest, many Spaniards have grown weary
of this incessant struggle and have left their homeland. Co
lumbus, for example, took off in three little ships—the I’atti,
the Maxene, and the Laverne and discovered Ohio. Magellan
later discovered Columbus. Balboa also sailed to the Xew
World, but he was silent on a peak in Darien, so it is difficult
to know what he discovered.
Well sir, 1 guess that’s all you need to know about Spain.
So now, as the setting sun casts its rosy fingers over El < Jreco,
let us take our reluctant leave of Spain —or Perfidious Albion,
as it is jocularly called. Aloha, Spain or Perfidious Albion, aloha!

As a result, Spaniards were all forced to turn to bull fighting
in order to keep body and soul together. Today, wherever you
go in Spain—in Madrid, in Barcelona, in Toledo, in Cleveland
—you will see bulls being fought. For many years the bulls
have sought to arbitrate this long-standing dispute, but the
Spaniards, a proud people who use nothing but Castile soap,
have rejected all overtures.
It is therefore necessary for me to explain bull fighting to
anyone who is going to Spain. It is also necessary for me to
say a few words about Marlboro Cigarettes because they pay
me for writing this column, and they arc inclined to pout if 1
ignore their product. In truth, it is no chore for me to sing the
praises of Marlboro Cigarettes, for 1 am one who fairly swoons
with delight when I come upon a cigarette which gives you the
full, rich taste of good tobaccos plus the pure white Selectrate
filter, and Marlboro is the only smoke I have found that fulfills
both requirements. Oh, what a piece of work is Marlboro! The
flavor reaches you without stint or diminution. You, even as I,
will find these statements to be happily true when once you
light a Marlboro. Marl boros come to you in soft pack or Flip-
Top box, and are made only by the makers of Marlboro.
But 1 digress. Let us return to bull fighting. Bulls arc by
nature bellicose creatures who will keep fighting till the cows
come home. Then they like to put on pipe and slippers and
listen to the "Farm and Home Hour.” However, the Spaniards
w ill not allow the bulls any surcease. They keep attacking the
bull and making veronicas—a corn meal pancake filled with
ground meat. Bulls, being vegetarians, reject the veronicas
and then, believe you me, the fur starts to fly!
To be perfectly honest, many Spaniards have grown weary
of this incessant struggle and have left their homeland. Co
lumbus, for example, took off in three little ships—the I’atti,
the Maxene, and the Laverne and discovered Ohio. Magellan
later discovered Columbus. Balboa also sailed to the Xew
World, but he was silent on a peak in Darien, so it is difficult
to know what he discovered.
Well sir, 1 guess that’s all you need to know about Spain.
So now, as the setting sun casts its rosy fingers over El < Jreco,
let us take our reluctant leave of Spain —or Perfidious Albion,
as it is jocularly called. Aloha, Spain or Perfidious Albion, aloha!
