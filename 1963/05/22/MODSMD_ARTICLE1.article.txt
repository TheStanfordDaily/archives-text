# World Communist Leadership Goal of Chinese Says Whiting
## 
### WENDY DORTORT 
“The Chinese goal is supremacy and leadership of world
communism,” stated Allen S. Whiting yesterday afternoon in a
speech at Cuhherley Auditorium entitled “The Chinese Chal
lenge in the Sino-Soviet Conflict.”
Whiting’s was the third in a series of four speeches presented

by the HR in the Sixth Annual
Foreign Policy Institute. Whiting
is new director of the Office of
Research and Analysis for the
Far East, Department of State.
The Chinese possess a deep
emotional conviction that theirs
is the only true path to commu
nism, said Whiting, and thus
there is no hope for an about-face
in their attitude toward any issue
or nation, although they may co
operate momentarily to further
their own cause.
MAO-TSE TUNG IS eulogized
as Stalin was in the Soviet Union,
but the Chinese do not use Sta
linist methods of control. Their
regime is not based on terror but
on intimidation and persuasion
exerted by tho Party.
The roots of the Sino-Soviet
conflict are found in the events
of 1926. Lenin’s advice to Sun
Yet-sen to set up a united front
with the nationalists resulted in
temporary success of Chaing Kai
shek and led to the first feeling
that (he Soviet Union might not
know the best course for China
to pursue.
After the Second World War,
| Mao Tse-tung came out into the
open against Soviet advice to hold
back. Ho made communism an
Asiatic as well as European phe
nomenon and developed many
theories of his own.
! THE CHINESE Communists
came to power in 1949, feeling
they had won the battle by them
selves, if not "in spite of" Russia,
at least independently of Stalin.
Stalin himself said that the Chi
nese had ignored his advice and
won.

Tension between Moscow and
Peking has continued to build. In
1960, China accused the Soviets
of not understanding the world
situation, of not knowing what to
do even if they did, and of not
acting if risk to Russian national
interests W'as involved. They
claimed betrayal by Moscow and
openly attacked Khrushchev, call
ing him “inwardly timid.”
A meeting has been scheduled
in Moscow in the near future to
attempt a reconciliation, involv
ing compromises on both sides.
Whiting stated that although the
breach seems irreparable and
monolithic unity appears to be a
shattered myth, although China
may be innocent of the world and
thus make mistakes, the United
States can nevertheless be as
sured of having a very critical
and trying time in Asia.
