# Philip Hauser Says Reapportionment Would Cause Great Changes in U.S.

### MARSHA ROOD 
“Should the United States get reapportionment in both its
state and federal governments, a social, economic and political
revolution would occur which would have wide ranging domestic
and foreign implication,” Prof. Philip H. Hauser, head of the Uni
versity of Chicago’s sociology department, told a Tuesday Eve-

ning Series audience in Memorial 4
Auditorium last night.
This “revolution,’’ he said,
would be caused by the dramatic
change to a very liberal govern
ment, from the essentially con
servative one wo have now.
As part of the “liberal revolu
tion,” a good part of the farm
population, would be taken off re
lief.
“IF WE REDUCED the farm
population by 25 per cent we
would only get 5 per cent less
produce,” he stated.
Also, wo would have federal
aid to education, medicare, fed
eral aid to mass transportation in
urban areas, and more health,
welfare, and recreational activi
ties. Our foreign policy would be
more sympathetic to the United
Nations and toward foreign aid.
“At no time during the twen
tieth century has the United
States enjoyed representative gov
ernment in accordance with the
Constitutional requirements of
the Nation and the States,” Hau
ser said.
URBAN POPULATIONS are
denied their proper representa
tion, and therefore rural popula
tions tend to control the govern
ment to the disadvantage to ur
ban populations.
The non-representative char
acter of the State legislatures has
| made urban population much
| more dependent upon the Federal
government, and therefore more
| liberal, expecting more projects
j initiated by the Federal govern
-1 ment.
“Nothing has been more un-
I American than the unfair repre
' sentation in the State legislatures.

The cities are literally forced to
go to the Federal government for
help,’’ he said.
A STUDY by Nan Marke, a
graduate student at the Univer
sity of Chicago, reveals that rural
populations and rural representa
tives in State legislatures as well
as in Congress lend to be more
conservative than urban popula
tions and their represenatives.
The denser the populations, th e
more liberal the vote of their rep
resentatives.
