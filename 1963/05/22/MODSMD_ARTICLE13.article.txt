## The 						Eager American' 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Among the Atlantic allies who are meeting in Ottawa this
week, we seem to be in the position of wanting something much
more than they want it. We want as many of them as possible
to agree to have something to do with nuclear weapons.
For a beginning, we are pressing for an inter-allied nuclear
force to which the British will lend their bombers and we will
lend three Polaris submarines. Beyond this modest proposal,
there is the project of a “multilateral force” in which the Ger
mans, who cannot participate in the inter allied force, would pay
40 per cent of the costs of the multilateral force and have a more
or less corresponding equity.
The striking fact about the whole discussion is that we are
active and eager while the Europeans are reluctant and skepti
cal. General do Gaulle will have nothing to do with the whole
business. The Germans are more interested in pleasing Washing
ton than in the project itself. The Italians say yes, because it
would be inconvenient to say no. The British are waiting to see
what they will be asked to pay.
Our eagerness springs from a belief that, if we do not in
duce Europe to organize a sterilized nuclear force, General de-
Gaulle and some Germans, who are supposed to be waiting in
the wings, will develop unsterilized and uncontrollable nuclear
forces of their own. So we are trying to persuade Europe to do at
once something which would prevent Europe from doing some
thing else in the future. As a result, we find ourselves the advo
cates of expensive nuclear projects which will add nothing seri
ous to the total nuclear forces of the Western Alliance.
There is no such hurry, no such urgency, as we are display
ing. Neither France nor Britain can have a serious independent
nuclear force for many years to come, and Germany is bound by
solemn treaties, which cannot be broken with impunity, not to
make nuclear weapons.
Our eagerness should be considered in the light of Europe’s
reluctance. Is it true, as we are assuming, that the countries of
Western Europe are losing interest in the NATO military estab
lishment because they do not have the only weapons which count
in the world today? If this were true, then there might be a re
vival of interest in the NATO establishment if the inter-allied
and multilateral nuclear projects were carried out.
But the evidence, as I read it, goes to show that Europe has
never taken the NATO establishment as seriously and as literally
as we have. The Europeans have always wanted to have Ameri
can troops stationed in Germany as a pledge that the U.S. stra
tegic air force would become engaged if Europe were attacked.
The Europeans have never thought it mattered greatly
whether they had many troops or few troops in the NATO es
tablishment. From the very beginning in 1949, the NATO estab
lishment has been for Europeans the device for making the At
lantic Alliance work promptly—a device to bring the United
States into the war when the first shot was fired.
Thus, General de Gaulle has kept most of his army, his air
force and his navy outside of the NATO organization. He can
have done that only because he does not think that the NATO
establishment is, as Americans have been taught to believe, a
substantial part of the real defense of Europe.
And whatever the general may say about his doubts as to
whether the United States would become engaged if Europe
were attacked, his actions prove that he has no real doubt. His
actions say that he knows (which is the fact) that the United
States is, willy-nilly, engaged in Europe. If the general doubted
that he had to become engaged, he would not dare to make the
alienation of America from Europe the cardinal objective of his
foreign policy.
One of the worst results of this alienation is that Paris and
Washington do not know how to talk with one another at the
very moment when beneath the surface of events there are such
profound movements in human afafirs. It is a great pity that
the prophetic vision of General de Gaulle and the practical effi
ciency of President Kennedy are separated from each other.
For the world as it was when the NATO establishment was
organized more than 10 years ago is a very different world than
the world is today—what with the Sino-Soviet conflict, the move
ment among the Soviet satellites in Europe, their developing
relations with the Vatican, the Soviet reconciliation with Tito,
the quiet on the Berlin front and, in the Western World, the de
parture of the postwar leaders.
This does not mean that the NATO establishment is obsolete
and should be abolished. Not at all. But it does mean that, if we
are going to develop a real foreign policy, not merely improvised
gadgets, we shall have to begin by realizing how much the world
has changed since General Eisenhower was appointed supreme
commander of the NATO establishment.

more than they want it. We want as many of them as possible
to agree to have something to do with nuclear weapons.
For a beginning, we are pressing for an inter-allied nuclear
force to which the British will lend their bombers and we will
lend three Polaris submarines. Beyond this modest proposal,
there is the project of a “multilateral force” in which the Ger
mans, who cannot participate in the inter allied force, would pay
40 per cent of the costs of the multilateral force and have a more
or less corresponding equity.
The striking fact about the whole discussion is that we are
active and eager while the Europeans are reluctant and skepti
cal. General do Gaulle will have nothing to do with the whole
business. The Germans are more interested in pleasing Washing
ton than in the project itself. The Italians say yes, because it
would be inconvenient to say no. The British are waiting to see
what they will be asked to pay.
Our eagerness springs from a belief that, if we do not in
duce Europe to organize a sterilized nuclear force, General de-
Gaulle and some Germans, who are supposed to be waiting in
the wings, will develop unsterilized and uncontrollable nuclear
forces of their own. So we are trying to persuade Europe to do at
once something which would prevent Europe from doing some
thing else in the future. As a result, we find ourselves the advo
cates of expensive nuclear projects which will add nothing seri
ous to the total nuclear forces of the Western Alliance.
There is no such hurry, no such urgency, as we are display
ing. Neither France nor Britain can have a serious independent
nuclear force for many years to come, and Germany is bound by
solemn treaties, which cannot be broken with impunity, not to
make nuclear weapons.
Our eagerness should be considered in the light of Europe’s
reluctance. Is it true, as we are assuming, that the countries of
Western Europe are losing interest in the NATO military estab
lishment because they do not have the only weapons which count
in the world today? If this were true, then there might be a re
vival of interest in the NATO establishment if the inter-allied
and multilateral nuclear projects were carried out.
But the evidence, as I read it, goes to show that Europe has
never taken the NATO establishment as seriously and as literally
as we have. The Europeans have always wanted to have Ameri
can troops stationed in Germany as a pledge that the U.S. stra
tegic air force would become engaged if Europe were attacked.
The Europeans have never thought it mattered greatly
whether they had many troops or few troops in the NATO es
tablishment. From the very beginning in 1949, the NATO estab
lishment has been for Europeans the device for making the At
lantic Alliance work promptly—a device to bring the United
States into the war when the first shot was fired.
Thus, General de Gaulle has kept most of his army, his air
force and his navy outside of the NATO organization. He can
have done that only because he does not think that the NATO
establishment is, as Americans have been taught to believe, a
substantial part of the real defense of Europe.
And whatever the general may say about his doubts as to
whether the United States would become engaged if Europe
were attacked, his actions prove that he has no real doubt. His
actions say that he knows (which is the fact) that the United
States is, willy-nilly, engaged in Europe. If the general doubted
that he had to become engaged, he would not dare to make the
alienation of America from Europe the cardinal objective of his
foreign policy.
One of the worst results of this alienation is that Paris and
Washington do not know how to talk with one another at the
very moment when beneath the surface of events there are such
profound movements in human afafirs. It is a great pity that
the prophetic vision of General de Gaulle and the practical effi
ciency of President Kennedy are separated from each other.
For the world as it was when the NATO establishment was
organized more than 10 years ago is a very different world than
the world is today—what with the Sino-Soviet conflict, the move
ment among the Soviet satellites in Europe, their developing
relations with the Vatican, the Soviet reconciliation with Tito,
the quiet on the Berlin front and, in the Western World, the de
parture of the postwar leaders.
This does not mean that the NATO establishment is obsolete
and should be abolished. Not at all. But it does mean that, if we
are going to develop a real foreign policy, not merely improvised
gadgets, we shall have to begin by realizing how much the world
has changed since General Eisenhower was appointed supreme
commander of the NATO establishment.
