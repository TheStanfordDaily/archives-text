## 'Electra': Better Film than Play 
### ANTONY P. D. LORRAINE 
Sacrilegious as it may sound, I feel that Euripides’ “Electra”
comes out better on film than it does on the stage. Euripides pre
sents a problem play which is primarily a study in characters;
their dimensions may be explored with greater subtlety by the
mobile camera than by the fixed distance stage.
Michael Cacoyannis’ "Electra” (recently at the Paris) is as
totally filmic and as modern as a Greek play may be rendered
and still keep its original spirit—which it docs both in theme and
poetry; the later, by substituting the visual image—the rugged
beauty of the landscape, the quiet stylization of movement, for
the written image. Where Zarpas’ ancient “Electra” (Sophocles’),
with its action in the theatre of Epidauros made little use of the
film medium, Dassin’s twentieth century “Phaedra” made pain
fully much use of it; Cacoyannis’ film falls happily between the
two. The costumes, the setting, and of course the Hamlet-like
irresolution of Euripides’ characters give the film a timeless
quality. It has none of the single-mindedness, the heroic hair
tearing, the fearsome goods which so date but make so tragic
Sophocles’ tale. In each character: Electra’s respectful and
dignified peasant husband, the proud Clytemnestra, the irreso
lute children, we recognize the arbitrary forces of fate which
have brought about the unfortunate dilemmas.
From the masterfully wordless flash-back to Agamemnon’s
death which takes the place of the play's long, slow prologue,
to the exclusion of the final Deus ex Machina we are thankful
for most changes made in the film. But I do take exception to
the extensive cutting of dialogue which, even to a dub-reading
audience, destroys the rhythm and music of the whole and to
the unnecessary strengthening of Orestes Euripides’ Orestes,
who has been given hospitality as a stranger, sinks an axe into
Aegisthus’ back. But the film fades on the two squaring away
with carving knives across a banquet table. In the best Aris
totelian manner, it keeps blood off location, but we can’t help
wondering in the interim how this young, rather cowardly,
Orestes manages to kill the virile king.
The point of Euripides’ Orestes and Electra is that they are
ordinary humans, understandably hesitant and unwilling to
kill. Aegisthus is a relatively small problem—largely one of
tactics. But Clytemnestra is Mother. Counting on her sympathy,
they announce that Electra has had a child: sure enough, Cly
temnestra rolls up in all her glory. So far, so good, but some
thing more than tactics ip required hereafter, and sure enough
Orestes at the last moment beats a retreat and Electra twice
hesitates with dangerously cold feet. Eventually, Electra has
to guide Orestes’ murdering hand. Even so, we are not sure that
Orestes has not killed to save face and Electra, out of jealousy
of her mother’s power and splendour.
Irene Pappas is large-boned and unattractive, but her Elec
tra is beautiful. She carries her head high as she is driven from
her parents’ palace and as she fetches water from the well to
her husband’s hovel; with pride and fortitude she takes hold of
Orestes (and the whole play) as Clytemnestra has taken hold of
Tegisthus. This is a woman’s play and its climax is the final
scene between mother and daughter. Thankfully Euripides gives
Clytemnestra a much more persuasive defense than Sophocles
ever did and for a moment we have pity for this ambitious
woman with whom justice has at last caught up. But the action
must go its duty-bound and inevitable way until the final sug
gested exile of brother and sister; at which parting the whole
cycle seems to be slipping into a lower gear and we wonder has
the final justice been achieved. All this Cacoyannis transposes
faithfully from Euripides, using his chorus of village women
and symbolically suggestive shots of the environment and char
acters.
Lassaly’s camera work is superb; unfortunately a twirling
shot of the sky as Electra falls in Agamemon’s grave and a flash
ing montage of the horrified chorus at Clytemnestra’s murder
remind us that we are behind the camera at the Theatre Ex
presso and not invisible spectators on the plains of Mycenae.
This play may have been written for the stage, but I recom
mend the film for (hose interested in Euripides or Greece. It
will give more of the playwright’s spirit than any commentator
and do more justice to his characters (and therefore the play)
than any stage production.
