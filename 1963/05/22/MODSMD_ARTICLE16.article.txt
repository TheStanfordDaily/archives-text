Dr. Sterling:
As second generation alumni of Stanford, my wife and I
are shocked at the action of the officials of Stanford University
in their decision to give “Old” No. 1 to the San Francisco Mari
time Museum at this time. I have seen pictures of two other
antique engines and accessory cars that were given to the Mari
time Museum. They too were stored in the Santa Fe yards in
Richmond, the same yard in which Central Pacific No. 1 is to be
temporarily stored. These engines and cars have been vandalized
beyond repair. What hasn’t been vandalized has rotted to obliv
ion. These engines were in the same beautiful condition as No.
1 is now.
Wo feel No. 1 deserves a bettor fate than that just described.
If you or any other officials doubt our concern I suggest you
take time to contact the museum officials and then go see the
"antique junk” that was stored in the Richmond Santa Fe yards.
Surely Stanford, with their vast personnel resources, could
find a building in which to house the engine. I personally know
of one railroad historical society which will store- No. 1 proper
ly until a building can be built to- house if.

What is happening to the Fundamental Standard? In a
meeting with the A.W.S. Board concerning the new overnight
policy, Dean Winbigler was quoted as saying that even if the
University does not have a legal responsibility for its students,
it does have a “moral and educational responsibility.” Now I
have alw’ays understood the Fundamental Standard to mean
that it is the students who have the moral responsibility and not
the administration.
Applying this to the recent furor over the new overnight
policy, we can’t help but see what is happening. In our dorm,
two women from social regulations committee explained that
by making the regulations more specific the students would
know how to better affirm their personal responsibility. Also, in
being more specific, the new rulings should facilitate optimum
conditions for making rational choices. Supposedly people (in
this case, Stanford women) will be able to make decisions freed
from social pressures that go against the dictates of their own
consciences.
This is an attempt at whitewashing the realities of the situ
ation. Dean Winbigler says he hopes new specifications will
help establish a “minimum level of morality” among students.
This demonstrates a movement away from the spirit of the
Fundamental Standard. The spirit of the Standard, as I see it,
is the sense of personal responsibility it engenders in each per
son to use good judgment in decision-making. The change in the
Women’s Overnight Policy is a standardization of morals rather
than a “clarification.” Hence, the individual, his sense of per
sonal integrity, and responsibility is being lost in a complex set
of regulations. Witness the kinds of questions which come up
during discussions of social regulations: “Does that mean that
my roommate and I can’t go to the City for the day and stay
overnight without an authorized chaperone?” Instead of exam
ining each situation individually and being guided by respect
for others and oneself, the student is more and more asking,
What is the ruling?”
This is not necessarily the fault of the administration.
Their position is based upon the facts of irresponsibility seen in
cases before Men’s and Women’s Councils. If this standardization
is not our fault, it is our problem that the real meaning of the
Fundamental Standard is not grasped while the responsibility
for judgment and decision-making is ours.

The “students” who viciously attempted to sabotage the re
portedly brilliant lecture of Professor Theodore Roszak Monday
morning in Memorial Auditorium are beneath contempt. They
are unworthy of admission to the most mediocre institution of
higher education.
I trust they have not found a home at Stanford.

sonal integrity, and responsibility is being lost in a complex set
of regulations. Witness the kinds of questions which come up
during discussions of social regulations: “Does that mean that
my roommate and I can’t go to the City for the day and stay
overnight without an authorized chaperone?” Instead of exam
ining each situation individually and being guided by respect
for others and oneself, the student is more and more asking,
What is the ruling?”
This is not necessarily the fault of the administration.
Their position is based upon the facts of irresponsibility seen in
cases before Men’s and Women’s Councils. If this standardization
is not our fault, it is our problem that the real meaning of the
Fundamental Standard is not grasped while the responsibility
for judgment and decision-making is ours.

The “students” who viciously attempted to sabotage the re
portedly brilliant lecture of Professor Theodore Roszak Monday
morning in Memorial Auditorium are beneath contempt. They
are unworthy of admission to the most mediocre institution of
higher education.
I trust they have not found a home at Stanford.

As second generation alumni of Stanford, my wife and I
are shocked at the action of the officials of Stanford University
in their decision to give “Old” No. 1 to the San Francisco Mari
time Museum at this time. I have seen pictures of two other
antique engines and accessory cars that were given to the Mari
time Museum. They too were stored in the Santa Fe yards in
Richmond, the same yard in which Central Pacific No. 1 is to be
temporarily stored. These engines and cars have been vandalized
beyond repair. What hasn’t been vandalized has rotted to obliv
ion. These engines were in the same beautiful condition as No.
1 is now.
Wo feel No. 1 deserves a bettor fate than that just described.
If you or any other officials doubt our concern I suggest you
take time to contact the museum officials and then go see the
"antique junk” that was stored in the Richmond Santa Fe yards.
Surely Stanford, with their vast personnel resources, could
find a building in which to house the engine. I personally know
of one railroad historical society which will store- No. 1 proper
ly until a building can be built to- house if.

What is happening to the Fundamental Standard? In a
meeting with the A.W.S. Board concerning the new overnight
policy, Dean Winbigler was quoted as saying that even if the
University does not have a legal responsibility for its students,
it does have a “moral and educational responsibility.” Now I
have alw’ays understood the Fundamental Standard to mean
that it is the students who have the moral responsibility and not
the administration.
Applying this to the recent furor over the new overnight
policy, we can’t help but see what is happening. In our dorm,
two women from social regulations committee explained that
by making the regulations more specific the students would
know how to better affirm their personal responsibility. Also, in
being more specific, the new rulings should facilitate optimum
conditions for making rational choices. Supposedly people (in
this case, Stanford women) will be able to make decisions freed
from social pressures that go against the dictates of their own
consciences.
This is an attempt at whitewashing the realities of the situ
ation. Dean Winbigler says he hopes new specifications will
help establish a “minimum level of morality” among students.
This demonstrates a movement away from the spirit of the
Fundamental Standard. The spirit of the Standard, as I see it,
is the sense of personal responsibility it engenders in each per
son to use good judgment in decision-making. The change in the
Women’s Overnight Policy is a standardization of morals rather
than a “clarification.” Hence, the individual, his sense of per
sonal integrity, and responsibility is being lost in a complex set
of regulations. Witness the kinds of questions which come up
during discussions of social regulations: “Does that mean that
my roommate and I can’t go to the City for the day and stay
