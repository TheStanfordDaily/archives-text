# Notre Dame Debates Student Freedom Issue

| How much freedom should stu
dents have? How democratic
should a school be in permitting
students to protest the institu
tion’s policies? The issue of stu
jdent freedom, frequently debated
on college campuses, was raised
[at The University of Notre Dame
after a dispute between school of
| ficials and the editors of the uni
| versify’s weekly news magazine,
[the Scholastic. Officials, after de
leting “objectionable material”
from an issue, cancelled publica
tion of the following issue when
the editors protested.
About a month after this dis
pute. the Rev. Theodore M. Hes
■ burgh, C.S.C., president of Notre
i Dame, wrote a letter to the stu
dent body which appeared in the
April 29 issue of The National Ob
| server.
In his letter, Father Hesburgh
stated his view that the primary
; role of students is to learn, not to
| teach.
"sn hunts WHO think other
wise should go out, found their
own universities, and then take
lessons from their students. This,
in fact, is the sad anatomy of
most South American universi
ties. It is also the reason that
they do not amount to much, as
universities."
Father Hesburgh says that he
can’t accept the solution to “lay
on with a heavy hand so the
troops won’t become restless.” He
believes (hat "discontent is not
all bad. Any person who really
I knows himself and senses what

God expects of him will be con
tinually dissatisfied with his own
personal performance.”
Although he stales that “no
good university is ever entirely
peaceful,” he does not consider
faculty and students “equal part
ners in the educative process,
since students by definition are at
a university to study under the
direction of the faculty, and to
learn,”
NOR HOMS UK “consider stu
dent leaders to be makers of
broad university policy or wield
ers of pressure, except in their
own domain. Manifestos of rights
are always easier to produce and
more popular than proddings to

| difficult responsibilities in areas
where only students can assume
| real leadership.”
j Father Hesburgh concludes that
| it is the universities’ goal to in
terest the students in the educa
| live process.
I “There is po real cause for dls
| content here.” he says, “that
| could not be dissipated by more
| intelligent, more understanding,
| more dedicated people on every
| level. If a few stalwarts among
j the students make this move, the
positive deed will outshine the
negative word, and the winter of
I our discontent may be forgotten
jin the flowering of a new spring
! time of hope ”

Publications Building this summer and it is hoped
that the building will be ready for occupancy by
next February. The Daily, The Quad, Sequoia
literary magazine, and Chaparral will all have
individual quarters in the new building, but they
will share photographic facilities and a conference room. The new building is being financed
by a gift from Thomas M. Storke, publisher of the
