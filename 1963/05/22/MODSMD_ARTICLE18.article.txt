(I e n t Walla c e Sterling's
speech for Southern Califor
nia Corporation executives
last night in I,os Angeles.)

For tin* person who belongs lo
tin* generation which now counts
its birthdays in the oil’s or be
yond. today’s university has
changed greatly from the alma
mater of his undergraduate days.
Me tends to he nostaligic about
the good old days, he tends oven
to romanticize about them and in
doing so think of them as they
never quite were. He lends to for
get (hat. even in his day, the uni
versity, in Clark Kerr’s phrase,
looked "far into the past and far
into the future” and w'as "often
at odds with the present.” This
forgetfulness makes it more dif
ficult for him to appreciate that
these characteristics of yester
day’s university are more inten
sively characteristic of today’s,
rite university criticizes the soci
ety it serves. It has always done
so. When you and 1 were younger
vve probably rejoiced in many of
those criticisms and contributed
to several of them, even though
we did not grow beards and wear
sandals: we vented out individu
ality by swallowing goldfish and
perching on telephone poles.
It has been said that the test of
an idea is to get itself accepted in
the free competition of the mar
ket place. A university know's
this. Being engaged in the free
enterprise of ideas, it is not really
disconcerted by those ideas which
appear to be aberrations from the
generally .accepted norm. It has
the confidence, horn of experi
ence, that only the ideas which
are rooted in demonstrable knowl
edge will survive and be produc
tive. It is always the hope of the
great university that this confi
dence will he shared by the soci
ety it serves, and in being shared
will constitute an important ele
ment in motivation for university
support.

A grant of $175,000 to Stanford
from the Lockheed Leadership
Fund was announced last night at
a Stanford dinner for Los Angeles
corporation executives at the Cali
fornia Club in Los Angeles.
The grant, made in memory of
Robert E. Gross, chief executive
of Lockheed Aircraft Corporation
for 29 years, is for endowed
scholarships and fellowships in
the School of Engineering an d
the Graduate School of Cusines--
This gift is in addition to Lock
heed's continuing support of the
University, totaling more* than
$lBO,OOO during Stanford's five
year PACE Program, according
to Stanford President Wallace
Sterling.
Lockheed’s total support of
Stanford for the PACE period
will earn for the University’s un
restricted use an additional $llB.

000 under tri ms of the Ford Foun
dation'' live-year inventive grant.
I’he Foundation is providing one
dollar for eaeh three dollars t lie
Fniversity raises from private
sources.
Daniel ,J. Haughton. president
01 Lockheed Aircraft Corporation
said: "The needs of a growing in
dustrial West are putting more
and more responsibility on our
universities for the development
of trained leadership, particularly
in engineering and business. Stan
ford, for example, leads the nation
in graduating Ph.D’s in electrical
engineering, yet even this effort
must be stepped up.”
Robert F. Gross, with a group
of associates, purchased the assets
of an earlier bankrupt airplane
company in 1932 and served as
chief executive of Lockheed until
his death in September 1961. In
that period, Lockheed grew to in
ternational prominence in the air
craft and missile field.
