## 
### MARTHA MASKALL 
One of I he few remaining au
thentic historical links in Cali
fornia’s growth story from Gold
Rush to Population Boom, the
Central Pacific Engine No. 1. or
1 the “Governor Stanford.” soon
will he moved from Stanford Uni-
I versity Museum to begin the first
stage of its journey to San Fran
cisco, where it will (ell its story
i to an estimated two million view-
I ers a year.
The engine, the first locomotive
in California, arrived via Cape
Horn just 100 years ago. It will
| be loaned by the University to
the San Francisco Maritime Mu
seum Association and featured in
the new Railroad Museum, a sec
tion of the S.F. Maritime State
; Historical Monument. The first
stage' move is planned for late
I this month or early June.
The Railroad Museum, now un-
I der construction at the fool of
I Hyde Street, is expected to open
in about IS months and will form
another chapter in the over-all
i tale of commercial transportation
I in the early West, from wind
j jammer to diamond-stack loco-
I motive.
Till; GOVERNOR STANFORD
arrived in California on the ship
“Herald of the Morning” on Au
j gust 19. 1863.
In 1916, “The Stanford Alum
| nus” reported: “The ‘Governor
j Stanford’ has been placed in the
museum. To accomplish this a
i hole big enough for the passage
of the locomotive had to be cut
| through the brick and cement
j wall of the building. The old cn-
I gine . . . which has been shel-
I tered by a wooden shack built j
[above it in the rear of the mu- |
scum, was then .jacked up and I
I run into its permanent position.” |
THROUGH THE years it has

boon reconditioned by railroad
buffs and viewed by many thou
sands.
The “Governor Stanford” will
go out as it came in through the

museum back wall. The tender
will ho separated from the engine.
A crane will lift both to a special
flatbed truck. They will be taken
to the Richmond Santa Fe yards
for temporary storage. When the
Railroad Museum in San Francis
co is completed, No. 1 will be
loaded on a barge and taken to
the Santa Fe docks in San Fran
cisco, unloaded and. for the first
time in many years, it will roll
| along track to its new location.
