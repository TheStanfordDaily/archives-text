## OUR MAN ON THE FARM The 						AAWU Track Meet A Preview 
### Glenn Alford 
Tho AAWU track and field championships will be held in Ber
keley on Saturday and Stanford will be fighting to displace peren
nial favorite USC as the number one track team in the conference.
STANFORD HAD THK MISFORTUNE to lose a dual meet to
the Trojans by one point. The Tribe also lost to SC in the University
division of the Fresno Relays, 56-53. Stanford disputed the final
point-rating, since Rich Chesarek wasn’t awarded any points for
finishing first among the university runners in the open 440.
Stanford also claimed that Larry Questad tied second place
finisher Have Morris of SC in the 100 instead of finishing third, and
that Eric Frische was ahead of SC’s Dick Cortese in that same race.
Any way the AAWU meet is doped out, USC figures to win, but
there are ways Stanford might sneak into first place. A dope sheet

based primarily on 19G3 times
and on who beat whom in t his
year’s dual meets, shows SC fa
vored over the Tribe 84-75, with
C. K. Yang University (alias
UCLA) a distant third with 38.
In the AAWU meet, points arc
awarded 5-4-3-2-1 for the first five
finishers in all events, including
relays.
INDIANS ARE favored in the
440 relay, mile. 100-yd. dash, shot
put, discus and broad jump.
Stanford beat USC in the 440
relay in the rain at Foothill Col
lege’s all-weather track in the
dual meet, and should repeat.
Stanford has lowered its best
time to 41.0. This is 0.1 better
than SC’s tops. In the mile Harry
McCalla will be running for a
win, not a record. He will have
to double in the two-mile as Stan
ford has to fight for every possi
ble point.

It's Questad in the Sprints

Larry Questad will win at least one sprint and possibly two. He
ran a 9.4 100-yd. dash heat at Fresno, Hieing the Stanford record)
and has sped to a 20.1 relay leg over 220 yards. Len Dodson of
UCLA, SC’s Cortese and Morris and Washington’s Jerry Plowman
all arc threats, as well as Stanford’s Frische.
Stanford will do well in the weight events. Steve Arch and Jack
Chappie, while not having the best shot put marks in the AAWU,
have steam rollered all opposition in AAWU dual and triangular
meets and are likely 1-2 finishers in their specialty.
Of course Dave Weill will take the discus, perhaps bettering his
NCAA mark in the process. His record was set on the Cal field. Dan
Moore is the favorite in the broad jump, provided he can jump up to
his form of the past few weeks, where he has neared 25 feet, though
other jumpers have neared or passed that distance.
STANFORD’S KEY MEN in the meet are Steve Cortright and
Paul Schlicke.
Schlicke was an outstanding performer for Coach Payton Jordan
in the two-mile until he broke a small bone in his foot. His 4:09
mile at Fresno suggests he has overcome this setback. However it
still remains to be seen if he can run the longer distance in anything
approaching his 9:01 early-season time. If Schlicke can upset USC’s
Julio Marin in the two-mile, Stanford’s chances would be much
better.
Cortright has been Stanford’s top point-winner all year. He is
known as a giant-killer in the high hurdles, where he has beaten
All-American Mel Renfro. On the basis of times, Cortright figures
no better than fourth. If he can improve on that, Stanford would be
in better shape.
lie figures for second behind Cal's Todd Gaskill in the triple
jump. Gaskill defeated Cortright in the Stanford-Cal dual meet and
posted the top collegiate distance in the nation in the process.
Should Cortright win it would mean another needed point for Stan
ford.
Final places where Stanford could break through are in the
pole vault and high jump. If Phil White can regain his early season
form and win a fourth or fifth place in one of the most star-studded
pole vault fields of all time, and if Clayton Raaka. Jay Marik or
John Fontius could take a point or two in the high jump, Stanford’s
chances to win the 1963 AAWU meet would be enhanced consider
ably.

nial favorite USC as the number one track team in the conference.
STANFORD HAD THK MISFORTUNE to lose a dual meet to
the Trojans by one point. The Tribe also lost to SC in the University
division of the Fresno Relays, 56-53. Stanford disputed the final
point-rating, since Rich Chesarek wasn’t awarded any points for
finishing first among the university runners in the open 440.
Stanford also claimed that Larry Questad tied second place
finisher Have Morris of SC in the 100 instead of finishing third, and
that Eric Frische was ahead of SC’s Dick Cortese in that same race.
Any way the AAWU meet is doped out, USC figures to win, but
there are ways Stanford might sneak into first place. A dope sheet

based primarily on 19G3 times
and on who beat whom in t his
year’s dual meets, shows SC fa
vored over the Tribe 84-75, with
C. K. Yang University (alias
UCLA) a distant third with 38.
In the AAWU meet, points arc
awarded 5-4-3-2-1 for the first five
finishers in all events, including
relays.
INDIANS ARE favored in the
440 relay, mile. 100-yd. dash, shot
put, discus and broad jump.
Stanford beat USC in the 440
relay in the rain at Foothill Col
lege’s all-weather track in the
dual meet, and should repeat.
Stanford has lowered its best
time to 41.0. This is 0.1 better
than SC’s tops. In the mile Harry
McCalla will be running for a
win, not a record. He will have
to double in the two-mile as Stan
ford has to fight for every possi
ble point.

It's Questad in the Sprints

Larry Questad will win at least one sprint and possibly two. He
ran a 9.4 100-yd. dash heat at Fresno, Hieing the Stanford record)
and has sped to a 20.1 relay leg over 220 yards. Len Dodson of
UCLA, SC’s Cortese and Morris and Washington’s Jerry Plowman
all arc threats, as well as Stanford’s Frische.
Stanford will do well in the weight events. Steve Arch and Jack
Chappie, while not having the best shot put marks in the AAWU,
have steam rollered all opposition in AAWU dual and triangular
meets and are likely 1-2 finishers in their specialty.
Of course Dave Weill will take the discus, perhaps bettering his
NCAA mark in the process. His record was set on the Cal field. Dan
Moore is the favorite in the broad jump, provided he can jump up to
his form of the past few weeks, where he has neared 25 feet, though
other jumpers have neared or passed that distance.
STANFORD’S KEY MEN in the meet are Steve Cortright and
Paul Schlicke.
Schlicke was an outstanding performer for Coach Payton Jordan
in the two-mile until he broke a small bone in his foot. His 4:09
mile at Fresno suggests he has overcome this setback. However it
still remains to be seen if he can run the longer distance in anything
approaching his 9:01 early-season time. If Schlicke can upset USC’s
Julio Marin in the two-mile, Stanford’s chances would be much
better.
Cortright has been Stanford’s top point-winner all year. He is
known as a giant-killer in the high hurdles, where he has beaten
All-American Mel Renfro. On the basis of times, Cortright figures
no better than fourth. If he can improve on that, Stanford would be
in better shape.
lie figures for second behind Cal's Todd Gaskill in the triple
jump. Gaskill defeated Cortright in the Stanford-Cal dual meet and
posted the top collegiate distance in the nation in the process.
Should Cortright win it would mean another needed point for Stan
ford.
Final places where Stanford could break through are in the
pole vault and high jump. If Phil White can regain his early season
form and win a fourth or fifth place in one of the most star-studded
pole vault fields of all time, and if Clayton Raaka. Jay Marik or
John Fontius could take a point or two in the high jump, Stanford’s
chances to win the 1963 AAWU meet would be enhanced consider
ably.

In the AAWU meet, points arc

Stanford has lowered its best
time to 41.0. This is 0.1 better
than SC’s tops. In the mile Harry
McCalla will be running for a
win, not a record. He will have
to double in the two-mile as Stan
ford has to fight for every possi

It's Questad in the Sprints

Larry Questad will win at least one sprint and possibly two. He
ran a 9.4 100-yd. dash heat at Fresno, Hieing the Stanford record)
and has sped to a 20.1 relay leg over 220 yards. Len Dodson of
UCLA, SC’s Cortese and Morris and Washington’s Jerry Plowman
all arc threats, as well as Stanford’s Frische.
Stanford will do well in the weight events. Steve Arch and Jack
Chappie, while not having the best shot put marks in the AAWU,
have steam rollered all opposition in AAWU dual and triangular
meets and are likely 1-2 finishers in their specialty.
Of course Dave Weill will take the discus, perhaps bettering his
NCAA mark in the process. His record was set on the Cal field. Dan
Moore is the favorite in the broad jump, provided he can jump up to
his form of the past few weeks, where he has neared 25 feet, though
other jumpers have neared or passed that distance.
STANFORD’S KEY MEN in the meet are Steve Cortright and
Paul Schlicke.
Schlicke was an outstanding performer for Coach Payton Jordan
in the two-mile until he broke a small bone in his foot. His 4:09
mile at Fresno suggests he has overcome this setback. However it
still remains to be seen if he can run the longer distance in anything
approaching his 9:01 early-season time. If Schlicke can upset USC’s
Julio Marin in the two-mile, Stanford’s chances would be much
better.
Cortright has been Stanford’s top point-winner all year. He is
known as a giant-killer in the high hurdles, where he has beaten
All-American Mel Renfro. On the basis of times, Cortright figures
no better than fourth. If he can improve on that, Stanford would be
in better shape.

Should Cortright win it would mean another needed point for Stan

Final places where Stanford could break through are in the
pole vault and high jump. If Phil White can regain his early season
form and win a fourth or fifth place in one of the most star-studded
pole vault fields of all time, and if Clayton Raaka. Jay Marik or
John Fontius could take a point or two in the high jump, Stanford’s
chances to win the 1963 AAWU meet would be enhanced consider
ably.

division of the Fresno Relays, 56-53. Stanford disputed the final
point-rating, since Rich Chesarek wasn’t awarded any points for
finishing first among the university runners in the open 440.
Stanford also claimed that Larry Questad tied second place
finisher Have Morris of SC in the 100 instead of finishing third, and
that Eric Frische was ahead of SC’s Dick Cortese in that same race.
Any way the AAWU meet is doped out, USC figures to win, but
there are ways Stanford might sneak into first place. A dope sheet

based primarily on 19G3 times
and on who beat whom in t his
year’s dual meets, shows SC fa
vored over the Tribe 84-75, with
C. K. Yang University (alias
UCLA) a distant third with 38.
In the AAWU meet, points arc
awarded 5-4-3-2-1 for the first five
finishers in all events, including
relays.
INDIANS ARE favored in the
440 relay, mile. 100-yd. dash, shot
put, discus and broad jump.
Stanford beat USC in the 440
relay in the rain at Foothill Col
lege’s all-weather track in the
dual meet, and should repeat.
Stanford has lowered its best
time to 41.0. This is 0.1 better
than SC’s tops. In the mile Harry
McCalla will be running for a
win, not a record. He will have
to double in the two-mile as Stan
ford has to fight for every possi
ble point.

It's Questad in the Sprints

Larry Questad will win at least one sprint and possibly two. He
ran a 9.4 100-yd. dash heat at Fresno, Hieing the Stanford record)
and has sped to a 20.1 relay leg over 220 yards. Len Dodson of
UCLA, SC’s Cortese and Morris and Washington’s Jerry Plowman
all arc threats, as well as Stanford’s Frische.
Stanford will do well in the weight events. Steve Arch and Jack
Chappie, while not having the best shot put marks in the AAWU,
have steam rollered all opposition in AAWU dual and triangular
meets and are likely 1-2 finishers in their specialty.
Of course Dave Weill will take the discus, perhaps bettering his
NCAA mark in the process. His record was set on the Cal field. Dan
Moore is the favorite in the broad jump, provided he can jump up to
his form of the past few weeks, where he has neared 25 feet, though
other jumpers have neared or passed that distance.
STANFORD’S KEY MEN in the meet are Steve Cortright and
Paul Schlicke.
Schlicke was an outstanding performer for Coach Payton Jordan
in the two-mile until he broke a small bone in his foot. His 4:09
mile at Fresno suggests he has overcome this setback. However it
still remains to be seen if he can run the longer distance in anything
approaching his 9:01 early-season time. If Schlicke can upset USC’s
Julio Marin in the two-mile, Stanford’s chances would be much
better.
Cortright has been Stanford’s top point-winner all year. He is
known as a giant-killer in the high hurdles, where he has beaten
All-American Mel Renfro. On the basis of times, Cortright figures
no better than fourth. If he can improve on that, Stanford would be
in better shape.
lie figures for second behind Cal's Todd Gaskill in the triple
jump. Gaskill defeated Cortright in the Stanford-Cal dual meet and
posted the top collegiate distance in the nation in the process.
Should Cortright win it would mean another needed point for Stan
ford.
Final places where Stanford could break through are in the
pole vault and high jump. If Phil White can regain his early season
form and win a fourth or fifth place in one of the most star-studded
pole vault fields of all time, and if Clayton Raaka. Jay Marik or
John Fontius could take a point or two in the high jump, Stanford’s
chances to win the 1963 AAWU meet would be enhanced consider
ably.
