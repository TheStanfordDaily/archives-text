## Cal-Stanford Rivalry: Bears Take Gas 
### PETE KING 
“That dirty Gokion Bear ... is losing all his hair . . So go
lhe lyrics in a well-known Stanford fight song sung only at games |
with the Berkeley Branch of UC. Ws in most derogatory cheers and
yells, everyone gets a kick out of ribbing the other side, but nobody
really believes that Cal is that had. The way things have been going
lately, however, it really makes you wonder.
The Cal-Stanford rivalry is just as colorful and exciting as it I
always was, but recently it has lost some of its luster. This isn't due!
to any policy switch by the two athletic departments. The plain fact
is tha* Cal consistently loses.

Lousy in Fool ball

This has been evident to even the casual follower of Stanford
sports, but the extent to which the Indians have dominated the Bears

in the past two years is really
frightening.
The sport in which (he Golden
Bears have become most tarnish
ed is, of course, football. The com
bination of poor recruiting and
equally poor schedule planning
have enabled Cal to lose 83 of its
last II foot hall games. Not many
colleges, especially those over
8(1,000 enrollment, can make that
statement.
Stanford has capitalized on the!
Bears’ weaknesses, having piled ]
up a cumulative 50-20 point mar
gin in the past two Big Games. |
Only once in the five seasons pre
ceding these games had the win
ning margin been more than a
touchdown.
This year the prospects are
brighter for’ Cal. The what-me
worry? attitude that has in the

past placed such powerhouses as
Texas, lowa, Missouri, Penn Stale, anti Kansas on a single season’s
schedule has been dissipated. This year they’ve decided to pick on
lowa State, Utah, and San Jose State to boost their season record.
Cal Athletic Director Pete Newell, who compiled a 119-44 record as
a Cal basketball coach, must he getting rather frustrated. Another
30-13 Big Game loss and Newell may decide to become football coach.

Poor in Other Sports

Losing Big Game is pretty bad, but even more inexcusable have
been Cal’s performances in other sports. The list of Bear athletic
flops is a long one.
Stanford has won five of its last six basketball games with Cal,
with the Bears’ only win coming by one point. After their national
championship team of 1959, the Bears have done miserably, finishing
dead last in the AAWU two years running with a 6-18 cumulative
record.
In track the Indians have taken 24 of 32 first places in the last
two meets, winning both of them by 2-1 point margins.
Ungby, swimming, and golf all show the Big Ked out in front,
also. The Tribe lias won the last four rugby games against Cal, has
decisively won two swimming matches, and lias overwhelmed the
Cal golfers 23-4 and 25-2 in I lie past two seasons.
True, it hasn’t all been dismal for the Golden Bears. In such
big-time sports as gymnastics, wrestling, and boxing they have
topped Stanford regularly. Their crew is one of the best on the
coast. You get the impression 'most of the good Cal athletes,
tired of losing in other sports, decide to try crew in desperation.

Turning Point in Tennis

Last year Stanford lost two tennis matches to Cal, but this year’s
results may indicate a turning of the tide. The Indian netters won
both matches and next year will have the assistance of a sophomore.
Jim Beste, who has beaten Cal’s best man.
In baseball the two schools have managed a 4-4 split for two
seasons. This year Cal finished last in the CIBA.
After all (his, you might get the impression that it’s been Cal’s
ineptitude, rather than Stanford’s class, which has been mainly re
sponsible for the lopsided results. Actually, it’s hard to tell, for
Stanford’s athletics star has been burning brighter lately, while that
of Cal is emitting only occasional flickers.
At present it looks like Stanford will continue to be dominant,
at least in the coming year, while Cal will continue to take large
quantities of gas.
Newell should have stayed in basketball.
