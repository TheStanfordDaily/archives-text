# KA Enters Softball Playoffs After Upset over Sigma Chi
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
After eight weeks of play, the
intramural softball competition
has narrowed down to T6 teams,
which will meet in the first round
of the university championships
playoffs today. The second round
is scheduled for Saturday morn
ing.

In one of the most noteworthy
games of the season, Kappa Al
pha beat Sigma Chi on Monday,
4-3. Sigma Chi has won the cham
pionship two years in a row and
was undefeated in the 22 games
previous to the KA loss.
808 EETTEAU, the KA pitch
er, also has an impressive two
year intramural record of unde
feated hurling. His precise, con
trol pitching combined with KA’s
outstanding defensive strength is
primarily responsible for the
team’s high standing. Kappa Al
pha has held two opponents to
one run and has averaged nearly
a double play a game from an in
field composed of John Beman
(3b), Dick Johnson (ss), Bill Bone
(2bl, and Bob Friese (lb).
Last night the Delts (4-1)

gained admission to the playoffs
by beating DU 6-5 in the last in
ning. John Skeen’s bloop single
scored the two seventh-inning
runs after Chuck Wilson’s double
had set up the rally. DU had over
come an early Delt 4-0 lead and
had gone ahead 4-5 with two runs
in the top of the seventh.
