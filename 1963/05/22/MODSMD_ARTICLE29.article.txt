# Center for Radar Astronomy Established by Stanford, SRI
## 
### 
A Center for Radar Astronomy
has been established at Stanford
to carry out combined research
by radio engineers of the Stan
ford Research Institute I SRI)
and the University.
The 150-foot "big dish” radio
radar telescope located on tlie hill
behind 11k* main campus will he
used in the program. The fully
■ 'corn ole dish is one of the na
‘‘>n’s three largest and is all
SRI-built.
Coupled with the dish is a pow
erful University-operated radio
transmitter. Its million-watt in
put produces a 400,000-watt radar
probe with which the dish can ex
plore the sun, moon, planets, and
plasmas of the solar system.
TWO MOKi; STKERABLK 60-
foot antennae, numerous antenna
arrays ranging up to 2,000 feet in
length, and a number of medium
power and smaller transmitters
are among the new center’s other
radio astonomy equipment.
Support for tin 1 program comes
mainly from the Air Force Cam

bridge Research Laboratories and
the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, with addi
tional aid from the National
Science Foundation and 1 lie Office
of Naval Research.
INVESTIGATIONS are planned
in “bistatic radar astronomy," a
new technique that bridges the
gap between scientists who use
ground-based instruments and
those who use space probes to ex
plore the solar system. "Bistatie”
radar unlike ordinary or "mono
static” radar puts transmitter
and receiver at different locations.
Heading the project will bo

University’s Radioscience Labora
