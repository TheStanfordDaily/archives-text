# 'Quad' Out Today, To Be Distributed Through Saturday
## 
### 
The seventieth volume of th e
“Quad,” Stanford's yearbook,
comes out today and will be dis
tributed at the Quad Shack today,
Thursday, and Friday from 8-5
and from 8-12 on Saturday.
This year the Quad is dedicated
to Miss Imogen Aten who has
worked in the ASSU office for 35
years and is retiring at the end of
his year.
This year’s theme is “Growth,"
and the introductory color section
comments on the three facets of
growth at Stanford the growth
of the campus itself, the growth
of ideas at the University, and
the growth of the individual stu
dent.
Editor Kay Hell,strom stated,
“In order to give vitality to a
theme so exuberant as ‘Growth,’
we have used a bold layout, bold
type styles, and bold art with
a tree theme sybolizing growth."
An abstract of the Palo Alto
tree, used in the University seal,
recurs throughout the book after
its initial appearance on the cover.
This year’s Quad has more color
than over before, larger pictures
in the living groups, and 48 more
pages than the ’62 Quad.
Everyone picking up his Quad
is urged to have his receipt ready.
A limited number of extra books
will be sold at Engineering Cor
ner for $B.OO,
