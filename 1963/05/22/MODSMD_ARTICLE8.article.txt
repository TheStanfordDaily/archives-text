# Major Changes Initiated in Frosh Adviser Plan
## 
### MIRIAM BETENSKY 
Better relations between students and ad
visers and thoughtful long-term planning are
some hoped for benefits from two major
changes in the advising system this year.
The changes, which took effect Fall Quar
ter, were 1) freshman advisers were as
! signed by residence halls and 2) study cards
of students other than freshman and under
graduate transfers need to be signed only
once a year.
In the past freshman general studies ad
j visers were assigned simply by listing
I names, and those freshmen declaring a ma
| jor were given an adviser in that field. Now
all freshmen, regardless of whether they
have declared a major, are aided by an ad
viser (s) assigned to their specific corridor
or floor of their freshman residence. In addi
tion, one engineering adviser is assigned to
! each hall in Wilbur.
PREVIOUSLY STUDENTS were re
I quired to obtain their adviser’s signature on
i each quarter's study card. It is no longer
I obligatory for students other than freshmen
j to see their adviser more than once a year
I (in the spring for fall pre-registration), al
| though it is hoped that students will see
j their adviser more frequently.
Reasons for the changes are:
• To develop a better relationship be
i tween freshmen and their advisers.
• To develop students’ sense of personal
responsibility for their own educational de
cisions here, and for seeking advice as
I needed.
• To encourage consultation by students
j with their advisers at times other than regis
i (ration day and (he pre-registration period.

• To promote long-term academic plan
ning.
• To reduce the amount of time spent in
needless “clerical work.”
REQUESTS FROM SPONSORS and those
in charge of freshman residences were also
involved in bringing about the change.
Evaluation of the present advising sys
tem has been undertaken by the Student-
Faculty Committee on Advising, which has
been in existence for several years. The com
mittee is headed by Registrar Harvey Hall
and is composed of professors representing
major academic areas and students (mainly
sponsors).
The committee feels there has been im
provement in the advising system over pre
vious years, Hall reported. Only in the case
of Stern Hall did the new frosh advising
system fail. This failure was duo to the fact
that the 100 freshman men are scattered
among Stern’s eight houses, and it has been
difficult to coordinate their activities.
BRINGING TOGETHER advisees from
two houses proved cumbersome, and the Gen
eral Studies Office ended up by assigning
general studies advisers to Stern as a whole,
therefore leaving the situation essentially as
it was last year. Next year it is hoped to
get the names of the students earlier and
assign them to advisers.
In the other three frosh dorms, the sys
tem has worked quite well and has drawn
considerable favorable opinion. Many of the
advisers have been interviewed by the com
mittee and the majority of them feel the new
system is working well. Some advisers are
“ecstatic” and then others feel the program
is a flop, said Hall.
The system has worked particularly well,
Hall explained, in cases where either the ad

viscr is experienced or there is a well-struc
tured house that invites the adviser over for
meals, social events, etc.
PROBLEMS NATURALLY arise concern
ing what the adviser and the student expect
from the advising situation, said Hall. For
example, an adviser may wish a dinner in
vitation from his advisees and be hesitant
about just dropping in, while the students
may also be hesitant about offering an invi
tation. Of course both student and teacher
have crowded schedules.
No rigid rules arc placed on how the ad
viser should meet and help his students and
different advisers work in different ways.
Some prefer to have the advisees come to
their office, while others like to talk over
problems dt dinner or in informal sessions
at the dorffi.
COMMITTEE MEMBER Prof. Paul
Farnsworth of the Psychology Department
feels that the new system is an improvement
over the old associate plan. Formerly, the
freshman houses or corridors “adopted” a
faculty member, who then came to dinner,
etc. as frequently as he and the students de
sired. There are still faculty associates in
the frosh dorms, but relatively few.
The faculty associate program is now
active in many upperclass dorms. In the
case of the freshmen, it was felt that the
associate program would have more sub
stance if those were were also advisers.
Pre-registration for Fall Quarter will bo
held May 22-24 and time schedules will be
available in the Registrar’s Office a day or
so early. If a student pre-registers for the
fall, he must have his study list signed by
his adviser. If he does not pre-regster and
attends school next fall, ho will then have
to obtain his adviser’s signature.

COMMITTEE MEMBER Prof. Paul
Farnsworth of the Psychology Department
feels that the new system is an improvement
over the old associate plan. Formerly, the
freshman houses or corridors “adopted” a
faculty member, who then came to dinner,
etc. as frequently as he and the students de
sired. There are still faculty associates in
the frosh dorms, but relatively few.
The faculty associate program is now
active in many upperclass dorms. In the
case of the freshmen, it was felt that the
associate program would have more sub
stance if those were were also advisers.
Pre-registration for Fall Quarter will bo
held May 22-24 and time schedules will be
available in the Registrar’s Office a day or
so early. If a student pre-registers for the
fall, he must have his study list signed by
his adviser. If he does not pre-regster and
attends school next fall, ho will then have
to obtain his adviser’s signature.
Better relations between students and ad
visers and thoughtful long-term planning are
some hoped for benefits from two major
changes in the advising system this year.
The changes, which took effect Fall Quar
ter, were 1) freshman advisers were as
! signed by residence halls and 2) study cards
of students other than freshman and under
graduate transfers need to be signed only
once a year.
In the past freshman general studies ad
j visers were assigned simply by listing
I names, and those freshmen declaring a ma
| jor were given an adviser in that field. Now
all freshmen, regardless of whether they
have declared a major, are aided by an ad
viser (s) assigned to their specific corridor
or floor of their freshman residence. In addi
tion, one engineering adviser is assigned to
! each hall in Wilbur.
PREVIOUSLY STUDENTS were re
I quired to obtain their adviser’s signature on
i each quarter's study card. It is no longer
I obligatory for students other than freshmen
j to see their adviser more than once a year
I (in the spring for fall pre-registration), al
| though it is hoped that students will see
j their adviser more frequently.
Reasons for the changes are:
• To develop a better relationship be
i tween freshmen and their advisers.
• To develop students’ sense of personal
responsibility for their own educational de
cisions here, and for seeking advice as
I needed.
• To encourage consultation by students
j with their advisers at times other than regis
i (ration day and (he pre-registration period.

• To promote long-term academic plan
ning.
• To reduce the amount of time spent in
needless “clerical work.”
REQUESTS FROM SPONSORS and those
in charge of freshman residences were also
involved in bringing about the change.
Evaluation of the present advising sys
tem has been undertaken by the Student-
Faculty Committee on Advising, which has
been in existence for several years. The com
mittee is headed by Registrar Harvey Hall
and is composed of professors representing
major academic areas and students (mainly
sponsors).
The committee feels there has been im
provement in the advising system over pre
vious years, Hall reported. Only in the case
of Stern Hall did the new frosh advising
system fail. This failure was duo to the fact
that the 100 freshman men are scattered
among Stern’s eight houses, and it has been
difficult to coordinate their activities.
BRINGING TOGETHER advisees from
two houses proved cumbersome, and the Gen
eral Studies Office ended up by assigning
general studies advisers to Stern as a whole,
therefore leaving the situation essentially as
it was last year. Next year it is hoped to
get the names of the students earlier and
assign them to advisers.
In the other three frosh dorms, the sys
tem has worked quite well and has drawn
considerable favorable opinion. Many of the
advisers have been interviewed by the com
mittee and the majority of them feel the new
system is working well. Some advisers are
“ecstatic” and then others feel the program
is a flop, said Hall.
The system has worked particularly well,
Hall explained, in cases where either the ad

viscr is experienced or there is a well-struc
tured house that invites the adviser over for
meals, social events, etc.
PROBLEMS NATURALLY arise concern
ing what the adviser and the student expect
from the advising situation, said Hall. For
example, an adviser may wish a dinner in
vitation from his advisees and be hesitant
about just dropping in, while the students
may also be hesitant about offering an invi
tation. Of course both student and teacher
have crowded schedules.

BRINGING TOGETHER advisees from
two houses proved cumbersome, and the Gen
eral Studies Office ended up by assigning
general studies advisers to Stern as a whole,
therefore leaving the situation essentially as
it was last year. Next year it is hoped to
get the names of the students earlier and
assign them to advisers.
In the other three frosh dorms, the sys
tem has worked quite well and has drawn
considerable favorable opinion. Many of the
advisers have been interviewed by the com
mittee and the majority of them feel the new
system is working well. Some advisers are
“ecstatic” and then others feel the program
is a flop, said Hall.
The system has worked particularly well,
Hall explained, in cases where either the ad

viscr is experienced or there is a well-struc
tured house that invites the adviser over for
meals, social events, etc.
PROBLEMS NATURALLY arise concern
ing what the adviser and the student expect
from the advising situation, said Hall. For
example, an adviser may wish a dinner in
vitation from his advisees and be hesitant
about just dropping in, while the students
may also be hesitant about offering an invi
tation. Of course both student and teacher
have crowded schedules.
No rigid rules arc placed on how the ad
viser should meet and help his students and
different advisers work in different ways.
Some prefer to have the advisees come to
their office, while others like to talk over
problems dt dinner or in informal sessions
at the dorffi.
COMMITTEE MEMBER Prof. Paul
Farnsworth of the Psychology Department
feels that the new system is an improvement
over the old associate plan. Formerly, the
freshman houses or corridors “adopted” a
faculty member, who then came to dinner,
etc. as frequently as he and the students de
sired. There are still faculty associates in
the frosh dorms, but relatively few.
The faculty associate program is now
active in many upperclass dorms. In the
case of the freshmen, it was felt that the
associate program would have more sub
stance if those were were also advisers.
Pre-registration for Fall Quarter will bo
held May 22-24 and time schedules will be
available in the Registrar’s Office a day or
so early. If a student pre-registers for the
fall, he must have his study list signed by
his adviser. If he does not pre-regster and
attends school next fall, ho will then have
to obtain his adviser’s signature.
