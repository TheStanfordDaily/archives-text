# Class of '64 Suggests Change in Grade Curve
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
The Executive Committee of the Class of 1964, acting to ex
press student concern over the Stanford grading system, has sub
mitted a report to the University Administration.
The report, the culmination of a study begun in 1962 under
the direction of Richard Hillman, president of the class during

that year, presents an evaluation*
of the present system of award
ing grades and honors and sug
gests means for liberalizing this
system.
THE INTRODUCTION to the
report states, “We realize that
our position is one of student
opinion and to this end, we hereby
submit suggestions for further
study and discussion by policy
making bodies of this university.”
The committee noted, “grade
pressure is an acute academic
problem.” The report went on to
stress the contradiction between
the inate intellectual ability of the
Stanford student body, as mea
sured by the CEEB test, and ac
tual academic performance as
measured by grades.
THE REPORT emphasized that
although tests demonstrate that
the intelligence of students ad
mitted to Stanford has increased
sharply throughout the years, the
old Stanford curve has remained
in effect.
The committee noted that Har
vard, Yale, and Amherst have
acted to liberalize their grading
systems without adversely effect
ing their academic prestige. The
committee suggested Stanford
consider modifying its standards
so that the student’s GPA would
represent a more realistic evalua
tion of academic achievement.
THE REPORT recommended
that serious consideration be giv
en to an ABC grade distribution
with A. 33%; B, 33%; C, 33%;
and D and F at the discretion of
the instructor. In addition, the
committee suggested that within
the framework of the present
curve, a point system could be
employed to give real meaning to
plus and minus grades.
In regards to the distribution of
honors, the committee proposed
that a percentage system be sub
stituted for the present policy of
awarding honors on the “abso
lute” basis of having achieved a
3.0 GPA. This would resolve the
present contradiction between
grades and honors, and thus, the
program of presenting honors
could achieve its ostensible func
tion of stimulating student
achievement.
