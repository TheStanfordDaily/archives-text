# Faculty Discusses Importance of Research and Teaching at Stanford

### MARY KAY BECKER, ROBERT W. NAYLOR JONNET STEINBAUM 
(Editors' Note: This is the first of a series
of articles dealing- with undergraduate edu
cation at Stanford. Quoted statements are
personal opinions and are not necessarily
official statements of policy.)
Is the “publish or perish” idea so strong
at Stanford that good teaching is being dis
placed by researching ability? Are under
graduates being denied the high-quality edu
cation which they are presumably paying
for? Or must the functions of teaching and
researching be effectively combined in an
institution which wishes to retain all the
aspects of a great university?
The problems suggested by those ques
tions are obviously complex and we cannot
hope to reach final answers for them. Clari
fication and illumination of the problems,
however, have been offered by various mem
bers of the faculty and administration who
can observe them through their jobs.
SPECIFICALLY, the respective empha
sis placed on researching or teaching ability
is involved in the hiring and promotion of
teachers. While there is a general feeling
that a man’s research is the primary criteri

on in most of Stanford’s departments, there
was also some opinion that this was not
necessarily detrimental to the quality of the
teaching. Moreover, promoting a teacher on
the basis of his publication record is often
due to the fact that “no one has yet devised
an effective method to measure good teach
ing.” Efforts which are made to evaluate
courses in some departments are consid
ered unreliable and unsubstantial when com
pared to the concrete yardstick offered by
the record of production.
According to Dr. Philip H. Rhinelander
of the philosophy department, former dean
of the School of Humanities and Sciences,
“teaching versus research is a problem of
balance. Everyone agrees that good teaching
is desirable and necessary; the problem is
implementation.” The tendency in some de
partments, as Rhinelander sees it, is to put
the emphasis in the wrong direction, toward
a man’s prestige in his field, which is sel
dom achieved by teaching.
Also, as Prof. John D. Black, director of
the Counseling and Testing center noted,
“In the graduate schools, where students are
primarily interested in a teacher’s special
knowledge of his subject, the actual teaching

ability of the professor is less important to
the effect of the course than with under
graduates.” He added that "a faculty mem
ber’s future is bound up in his discipline,
his field of knowledge. His main identifica
tion is there, not with his students.”
WHEN DEPARTMENTS want to be
strong and regarded as good nationally, this
rating will depend on their productivity, be
cause, as Prof. R. Nevitt Sanford, Director
of the Human Problems Study Institute ex
plains, “No one outside the university will
know that a man Is a great teacher. When
a university like Stanford wishes to be rec
ognized as great, it will want to add to its
luster by hiring men who publish.” In addi
tion, as noted by Prof. A. H. Hastorf, Execu
tive Head of Psychology, "the existence of
prestigeful researchers attracts better under
graduate teaching.” It is also necessary, said
Rhinelander, to develop the people you al
ready have. Recent adcfttion of widely-recog
nized scholars to the undergraduate faculty
has unquestionably put new spirit into un
dergraduate courses, observed Robert J.
Wert, vice-provost.
For many of those who recommend pro
motion, the emphasis given to research

springs directly out of one’s underlying con
cept of the functions of a university. Ray
mond Giraud, Acting Executive Head of
French-Italian, asked, “Is it a place where
people make up the ignorance left over from
high school, or a genuine institution of
higher learning? If the latter, professors
should have a scholarly repute and be able
to speak with authority about their fields.”
A key distinction made is that between a
university and a college; related to this is
what many see as a necessary correlation
between research and teaching ability in
professors. Dr. Walter E. Meyerhof, Acting
Head of Physics, said, “a college just trans
mits knowledge from its source to the stu
dent, via the teacher. A university does this
too, but must also create knowledge and
teach its students how to create. This is best
learned by contact with a researcher, some
one actively concerned with the advance
ment of knowledge. A teacher can’t be con
tent merely to have transmitted informa
tion.”
SANFORD M. DORNBUSH, Executive
Head of Sociology, said, “in general, the good
teacher (without research capabilities) be
longs in the liberal arts colleges; in these

there is closer relation of faculty to students,
but a lower intellectual content.”

It is accepted by most that the university
does have many functions: the training of
teachers as well as undergraduates, the con
servation of knowledge in museums, li
braries, etc., as well as the advancement of
knowledge through research. But can the
university expect both teaching and research,
probably the primary functions, to be sup
plied by all the teachers? Answers to this
are complicated by the existence of different
kinds of teaching and research; sometimes
both will go together in the same man, some
times not. Many feel generally that, as Dorn
bush put it, ‘‘the dichotomy between research
and teaching is nonsense.” According to the
Executive Head of Economics, Kenneth J.
Arrow, ‘‘research is a very important prog
nosticator of teaching ability; there is a
positive relationship between them.
Dr. W. H. Cowley, Jacks professor of High
er Education, feels that, on the other hand,
a basic division among types of teachers
must be recognized in promotion and hiring.
This division, its effect, and dangers of too
much emphasis on research will bo discussed
in tomorrow’s article.
