# 'You Too Can Squeak Through Finals Week'
## 
### IEENE H. STRELITZ Associate Editor 
A new sound has been added to
the forceful banging of the radi
j ators in the Reserve Book Room;
; the squeaking of yellow marking
pens across text book pages and
class notes.
Yellow-marking pens represent
one of the Farm’s fastest growing
fads. According to the manager
of the Stanford bookstore supply
section, James Wilson, the pens
are selling at the rate of close to
four dozen a day.
THE PENS HAVE a standard
felt tip and bright yellow ink.
They differ from the normal
marking pen as their ink has a
water base rather than an oil
base, meaning it does not go
through to the other side of a
page.
Manager Wilson was first in
troduced to the pens at a confer

ence last spring in New York. He
ordered them immediately, and
put them on sale in July. Through
to December of this year, hardly
one of them had sold. Wilson
said, “I thought to myself, ‘Oh
boy—l bought a dud.’” Once this
novelty on the study skills mar
ket was discovered, however, its
popularity became overwhelming.
Over 3,000 have boon sold in the
past three months.
Theories have been flying fast
and furiously around campus as
to advantages and disadvantages
of the pons as a study aid. One
student noted, “When I go back
to reread material. I find the yel
low marking pen is much better
than the ink-pen underlining I
have always used before. With
the ink-pen, my eyes caught the
scrawled lines under the words;
with the thick yellow line actual
ly going through the print, I now

catch the words themselves right
away.”
ANOTHER STUDENT com
ments, “After studying for mid
terms with the yellow pens, I find
I remember material in a much
more specific fashion than ever
before. The bold line through the
words stood out on the page. The
phrases, as they looked on the
page, stayed in my mind so that
I could almost quote some of
them.”
Carl Thoresen, Counselor at the
Counseling and Testing Center
and professor of the “Effective
Study” class there, proposes some
theoretical questions in reference
to the new study device.
Speaking of students who find
the pens bringing new and highly
effective results, he notes, “They
could have a ‘catalyst’ or ‘novel
ty’ effect. Perception, attitude,
and intensity changes, as the stu

dent has made a psychological
commitment in buying the pen.
He doesn’t have a psychological
investment in his former method
of ink-pen underlining. Underlin
ing is the accepted and popular
method of study, and this seems
to look like an improvement for
the student.”
Thoresen adds, however, that
underlining—or a variation of it
—is a questionable process for
study. “There is a very inconsis
tant body of knowledge on calling
a phrase to the attention of the
reader. “Learning to Learn,” the
text used in our “effective study”
class, states that underlining
tends to be a passive process, that
it tends to postpone learning
rather than bo part of a learning
process. Underlining does not
force you to learn when you come
across the material; it gives a
false “sense of security.”
“WE RECOMMEND that the
student attempt to answer ques
tions while reading, questions he
has formulated after skimming
the material to find out its gen
eral nature, and then write down
the answer.
"The pen is no different in the
ory than circling a phrase or par
agraph, lines in the margin, or
lines under the words.”
Thoresen’s second question in
volves a theory of speed reading.
“It is recommended that students
focus not on the letters while
reading, but on the spaces be
tween the lines, permitting him
to take in a wider grouping of
letters. The yellow pen destroys
this.
“However, I must add that
these are just experimental opin
ions, and there is no denying the
popularity of the pens.”
Supply manager Wilson has
recommended the pens to San
Jose State and Berkeley book
stores. “If they don’t have them”
he says, “they’re missing the
