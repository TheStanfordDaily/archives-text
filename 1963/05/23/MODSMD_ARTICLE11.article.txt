A. Zagoria last evening, in the fina
Communist strategy has incoi
to spread Communist prestige, mat
and exploiting divisions in the Wes
have not met Khrushchev’s goals;

i 1949, Communism has had nearly
ing the present strategies of Khru
n is not likely, stated Dr. Donald
al Foreign Policy Institute address,
irporated the use of aid and trade
imputation of the balance of terror,
■stern allies, he said. The strategies
; many countries seem resistant to
♦Communist terror and pressure.
THE COMMUNIST economic
gains are still impressive, but are
not as dramatic as a few years
ago, Zagoria contended. Prob
lems are evident from the Chi
nese food shortage and similar
problems in Russia. Points fa
voring Western power are the
growing Europe economic and po
litical unity, and the maintenance
of United States nuclear advan
tage.

The Chinese Communists feel
that Khrushchev is losing ground
in the struggle for Communist
world power, and are upset be
cause they identify the world rev
olution with the national goals of
the unification and strengthening
of China.
Looking at the Sino-American
relationship from the viewpoint
of Communist China, Zagoria
said that Taiwan is seen as an
alternative Chinese regime sup
ported by the United States, and
claiming intentions to reconquer
China. The United States blocks
China’s entrance into the United
Nations.
IN CONTRAST, the United
States-Russia conflict is less di
rect, complete and confining: we
recognize the USSR; we don’t in
tervene into her internal revolu
tions; we present less of a mili
tary throat than wo do to China.
Zagoria added that the West
must realize that the Sino-Soviet
conflict has produced a split Com
munist front to the world, and we
must promote the diversity. We
must present a strong military
force against the spread of Com
munism, and encourage the
growth of nationalism.
Zagoria is currently engaged in
a project on Asian Communism
at the Institute of Communist Af
fairs, Columbia University, and
has written a definitive book,
“The Sino-Soviet Conflict, 1956-
61.”
