# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'Soviet People Confined to Home 
### DAVID BARNUM 
(Editors’ note; Mr. Barmim was a student at Stanford-in-
France, Group V. The tour through the U.S.S.K. was conducted
under the auspices of the Scandinavian Travel Service. This is
the first of a two-part series.)
An European city gives a first impression, cither on its own
merits or, as is the case with Vyborg, U.S.S.E., which contains
no castles or cathedrals, for what it represents. Located on the
main rail connection between Helsinki and Leningrad, the bor
der town of Vyborg is symbolic; symbolic of the kind of system
under which the Russian people unwittingly chose to live over
forty years ago. Only minutes from the West, it is unlikely
that many of its inhabitants will ever have the opportunity to
leave it and go there, even temporarily.
To the American tourist, used to obtaining visas for almost
anywhere in no time, a government is incomprehensible which
cannot afford to permit its citizens to travel and glimpse an
alien way of life. One is duly struck by the realization, which
no amount of reading can adequately render, that the Soviet
people are as effectively confined to their homeland as is pos
sible in this day and age. During the course of our brief student
tour of Russia a partial explanation of the closed nature of
Soviet society revealed itself.
First of all, the Soviet standard of living is appreciably and
obviously lower than that of almost any Western country. The
contrast is more noticeable coming out than going in. We take
our affluence pretty much for granted, but as one emerges from
the Soviet Union the reappearance of glass skyscrapers, colorful
advertising, and automobiles is truly striking.
With no Chrysler Corporation to throw up a new office
building once a year. Moscow’s downtown facade is thoroughly
drab. In fact, the only new structures in Moscow and Leningrad
are the hastily assembled suburban apartment blocks. But even
these, consistently tan or grey in color, and unimaginatively
designed, seem years old as soon as they are finished.
Shopping center window displays are equally unattractive,
and large-scale advertising is almost non-existent. Taxi cabs and
trucks account for an overwhelming percentage of Russia’s
motor vehicles. Moscow has thus far escaped the aggravating
congestion for which Paris is so Infamous, but the price is an
eerie absence of the lively, noisy, human circulation, however
sluggish, with which the twentieth century is forcing every
other metropolis to reckon.
In consequence of the lack of “consumer prosperity” in
Russia, an outrageous black market has sprung up. The Ameri
can tourist, be he student or businessman, is fair and glaring
game for the hordes of teen-age “entrepreneurs” who roam Mos
cow. One cannot walk the long block of Red Square without
being accosted by two or three of those semi-professional inter
mediaries on any given evening. Men’s socks, obtainable in
Stockholm for thirty cents a pair, “retail” for thirteen dollars
in the shadowy side streets of the city.
Curiously enough the Moscow police refrain from inter
fering in this flourishing but theoretically illegal trade, which
takes place under their very noses. Not infrequently a uniformed
officer can be seen peering into the darkness at two bargaining
figures, one of whom may be you, only to turn on his heels and
fade back into the night, thereby expressing his tacit approval
of the ensuing transaction.
That the American tourist should be the prime target of the
black marketeer is not surprising. He stands out both in dress
and banner. Consequently, the Internist guide whose job it is to
escort him about Leningrad or Moscow is apt to be highly wary,
and it is up to the individual tourist to prove that he is not
typical.
For example, the guide assigned to our student group, after
she had gotten to know us, related the following story. She was
showing the sights to an American group about a year before.
Since Russia does not manufacture chewing gum domestically,
practically every Soviet child carries with him a supply of little
metal pins, commemorating space flights and such things, which
he will trade for bubble gum. This harmless miniature black
market is far more extensive than the one in clothing and cur
rency.
Approached for gum as they piled out of the bus to photo
graph some monument or other, this particular tourist group
was prompted to throw its pieces of gum in the mud, and then
snap pictures of the children picking them up. Not long there
after our guide came upon one of the pictures in an American
magazine, with a caption to the effect that Soviet children are
so hungry they grovel in the mud for food. Henceforth, we felt
we could hardly blame our guide for taking a dim view of
American tourists in general.

With no Chrysler Corporation to throw up a new office
building once a year. Moscow’s downtown facade is thoroughly
drab. In fact, the only new structures in Moscow and Leningrad
are the hastily assembled suburban apartment blocks. But even
these, consistently tan or grey in color, and unimaginatively
designed, seem years old as soon as they are finished.
Shopping center window displays are equally unattractive,
and large-scale advertising is almost non-existent. Taxi cabs and
trucks account for an overwhelming percentage of Russia’s
motor vehicles. Moscow has thus far escaped the aggravating
congestion for which Paris is so Infamous, but the price is an
eerie absence of the lively, noisy, human circulation, however
sluggish, with which the twentieth century is forcing every
other metropolis to reckon.
In consequence of the lack of “consumer prosperity” in
Russia, an outrageous black market has sprung up. The Ameri
can tourist, be he student or businessman, is fair and glaring
game for the hordes of teen-age “entrepreneurs” who roam Mos
cow. One cannot walk the long block of Red Square without
being accosted by two or three of those semi-professional inter
mediaries on any given evening. Men’s socks, obtainable in
Stockholm for thirty cents a pair, “retail” for thirteen dollars
in the shadowy side streets of the city.
Curiously enough the Moscow police refrain from inter
fering in this flourishing but theoretically illegal trade, which
takes place under their very noses. Not infrequently a uniformed
officer can be seen peering into the darkness at two bargaining
figures, one of whom may be you, only to turn on his heels and
fade back into the night, thereby expressing his tacit approval
of the ensuing transaction.
That the American tourist should be the prime target of the
black marketeer is not surprising. He stands out both in dress
and banner. Consequently, the Internist guide whose job it is to
escort him about Leningrad or Moscow is apt to be highly wary,
and it is up to the individual tourist to prove that he is not
typical.
For example, the guide assigned to our student group, after
she had gotten to know us, related the following story. She was
showing the sights to an American group about a year before.
Since Russia does not manufacture chewing gum domestically,
practically every Soviet child carries with him a supply of little
metal pins, commemorating space flights and such things, which
he will trade for bubble gum. This harmless miniature black
market is far more extensive than the one in clothing and cur
rency.
Approached for gum as they piled out of the bus to photo
graph some monument or other, this particular tourist group
was prompted to throw its pieces of gum in the mud, and then
snap pictures of the children picking them up. Not long there
after our guide came upon one of the pictures in an American
magazine, with a caption to the effect that Soviet children are
so hungry they grovel in the mud for food. Henceforth, we felt
we could hardly blame our guide for taking a dim view of
American tourists in general.

France, Group V. The tour through the U.S.S.K. was conducted

An European city gives a first impression, cither on its own
merits or, as is the case with Vyborg, U.S.S.E., which contains
no castles or cathedrals, for what it represents. Located on the
main rail connection between Helsinki and Leningrad, the bor
der town of Vyborg is symbolic; symbolic of the kind of system
under which the Russian people unwittingly chose to live over
forty years ago. Only minutes from the West, it is unlikely
that many of its inhabitants will ever have the opportunity to
leave it and go there, even temporarily.
To the American tourist, used to obtaining visas for almost
anywhere in no time, a government is incomprehensible which
cannot afford to permit its citizens to travel and glimpse an
alien way of life. One is duly struck by the realization, which
no amount of reading can adequately render, that the Soviet
people are as effectively confined to their homeland as is pos
sible in this day and age. During the course of our brief student
tour of Russia a partial explanation of the closed nature of
Soviet society revealed itself.
First of all, the Soviet standard of living is appreciably and
obviously lower than that of almost any Western country. The
contrast is more noticeable coming out than going in. We take
our affluence pretty much for granted, but as one emerges from
the Soviet Union the reappearance of glass skyscrapers, colorful
advertising, and automobiles is truly striking.
