## 'Freud' Too Much for One Movie 
### WILLIAM MOORE 
It’s a good thing Sigmund Freud’s not; alive today.
Because if he were, he would undoubtedly be convinced that
the motion picture—and not sex—is the real culprit in life. And
all he’d have to do would be to look at a movie like, say, John
Huston’s “Freud.”
Through its two-anda-half hour run the film teeters back
and forth on something that’s strangely surrogate.
First, there’s the plot—which is just plain silly. The prob
lem is that script writers Charles Kaufman and Wolfgang Rein
hardt have taken on too big an assignment. They have attempted
to give a picture of the man, his environment, and the develop
ment of his theories.
But in the process they have fallen into that old Hollywood
rut—of bruising the facts of history for the sake of drama.
The result is a movie that shows a remarkably single
minded Freud. In every scene the young psychoanalyst is shown
relentlessly tracking down The Truth, like a bloodhound with
nose to the trail. If the real Freud, however, spent half as much
time in fitful research as his filmland counterpart, he probably
would have lost his scent for the stuff long ago. (After all. did
Freud do nothing but research for ten years?)
In addition, (here’s something unnatural about the way the
doctor, in the movie, develops his theories. As he stands on the
threshold of each new discovery, his expression becomes intent;
then his eyes light up—and, presto, he has a new theory.
Then there’s the cast, which would be the pride of any mis
casting department.
In the movie the psychiatrist is called “Siggie” by his friends
and family. But disconcerting as the name might be, it has a
certain simpleton ring about it that aptly sums up Montgomery
Clift's portrayal of the role of Freud.
As he stumbles along to each new discovery, Clift’s eyes
become so big with psychoanalytical fervor that the viewer
spends almost as much time concentrating on them as on the
story line.
His mother (Rosalie Crutchley) looks not a day older than
he. His number one patient (Susannah York) looks like she'd
be much more at home on a cheese cake calendar than on a
couch. And his collaborator (Larry Parks), with his soothing
voice, acts more like a TV announcer than a doctor.
The film, however, is not without its good points. Its black
and white cinematography lends itself well to the eerie world
of the subconscious that Freud penetrated. And there are several
superb dream sequences aided by trick photography.
But these points aside, the producers of “Freud” would have
done well to have dwelt more on the character of Freud than on
his long, complex line of achievements. After all, there’s only
so much one can do in one motion picture.
