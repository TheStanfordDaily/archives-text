Editors, The Daily:
While there is a popular myth which holds that a person
trained to a high degree of specialization in a science must nec
essarily have neglected his training in the liberal arts, it has
been my personal experience that this is n,ot the case (the for
midable scholarly attainments of an Oppenheimer or an Ein
stein may be quoted as evidence here). In an informal survey
of a random selection of graduate students in the physics de
partment, it was found that the percentage of liberal arts
courses taken as undergraduates varied from 30 to 45 per cent,
with an average well over 35 per cent. It was also found that of
those who attended universities, all look advanced work in some
field of the humanities (ranging from literature to latin, with
philosophy the most popular), and all took at least one foreign
language.
The reason for this result is quite simple. In most schools,
the science faculties are under the college of Liberal Arts and
Sciences, and consequently science students must take all gen
eral education requirements demanded of the Arts student. In
addition, he must pursue his studies both in his particular field
and in mathematics. This means that if he wishes to pursue an
interest in a non-technical field, he must be prepared to take a
higher class load than is normally taken. The above survey
seems to indicate that many science students are willing to do
just that.
I think that it is significant that the complaints about the
two cultures do not come, in the main, from scientists. Early in
his career the science student learns that, outside of his class
mates, no one has either the interest or the ability to carry on a
serious discussion with him about his field of specialization.
Consequently, he is forced to become conversant in some fields
of more general interest. The scientist, because of his constant
immersion in a non-scientific society, learns to take an interest
in non-scientific academic pursuits. He does not feel that any
particular area of learning is closed to him. He has access, in
short, to both cultures.
The fact that the barrier between the Iwo cultures exists in
essentially only one direction, cutting students of the humanities
off from scientific learning, can be attributed to the problem of
language. In America, the language of the humanities is English,
and everyone entering a university is assumed to bo adept in its
use. The language of the sciences, however, is mathematics. To
try to comprehend the advances in the physical sciences since
1h 17th century without understanding the calculys is like trying
to learn English Literature withbut being able tet read. Since
virtually no one enters a university with a knowledge of calcu
lus, the science student has the immense advantage of being able
to speak the language of the humanities while ho is learning the
language of the sciences, while the reverse is not true for the
Arts student.
In conclusion, I would like to suggest that if people are
really interested in improving general education, they quit carp
ing about some non-existent inadequacies in scientific education
and begin worrying about teaching calculus and a bit of science
to students of the humanities. There is no reason, after all, why
these students should be cut off from this field of knowledge,
which is perhaps the single most distinguishing feature of West
ern civilization.

Is morality based on the imposition of a set of command
ments from that great and Holy God the “Norm?” When will
the University cease its misguided and ineffectual attempts to
impose an ambiguous and highly questionable standard of con
duct upon people who are theoretically here to learn to make
their own decisions?
The silly little rules governing our emancipated Stanford
women are a monument to hypocrisy and inconsistency. “Equal
ity for all. unless you are female and under twenty-three.” Are
women human beings who are capable of running their own
lives, or merely pin-brained domestic animals who (for their
own protection) must be herded together and sheltered under
the Stanford Incubator System? (Though anyone who feels the
need for the warmth and security of a “woman’s” dormitory
certainly should not be prevented from staying in one.)
Conformity to the Incubator System and abstention from
whatever it frantically trys to “protect against” is, at best, a
pseudo morality. I suggest that all American universities aban
don the petty legislative props meant to “establish a minimum
morality.” This would help establish an atmosphere of greater
freedom, the only atmosphere in which a true morality (as
opposed to the traditional conformity through fear of punish
ment) is possible.

Editors, The Daily:
How much of your editorial of Tuesday, May 21, was found
ed upon emotional preconception, and how much was founded
upon intelligent research into Stanford’s admission practices,
athletics financing, and the lives of Stanford athletes? How
many questions did you put to the Director of Admissions, the
Director of Athletics, and to a random and objective sample of
athletes? How much do you know about the rules of the NCAA,
for that matter?
When you stand for free inquiry and free speech (and may
you always have the spirit to do so), you might also stand for
another great tenet of a liberal democracy—get the facts before
you judge a case. In plain terms, you don’t know what you’re
talking about. You might even be basically right, but you’re
guessing. You might also be a country mile wrong.
