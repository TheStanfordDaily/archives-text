# Tribe Has Enthusiasm, But Lacks Finesse in Spring Drills
## 
### 
The 1963 edition of the Stan
ford Indians ran through their
last practice session of spring
practice yesterday, preparatory

to the alumni game on Saturday,
which marks the end of spring
drills.
However, head football coach
John Ralston has not been too
pleased with the performance of
the team this spring, although he
believes that with additional work
the squad will improve.
“The only good part of the
spring practice was the enthusi
asm. You have to block and
tackle to win and we can’t do that
yet,” he said.
Commenting on what was prob
ably the biggest surprise of the
spring, the shifting of quarter
backs Steve Thurlow and Dick
Ragsdale to halfbacks, the coach
said, “Both are very good run
ners, but they can’t even block
yet.”
While it is not certain that both
players will be at halfback when
next season opens, t hey will prob
ably see plenty of action at half
back in the alumni game, leaving
the quarterbacking to Clark
Weaver and frosh Mike Connelly.
At yesterday’s practice, both
Thurlow and Ragsdale were run
ning for the Red squad (first
string). Thurlow looked especial
ly good, running over would-be
tacklers and reeling off several
long runs.
But while Ralston has not been
too pleased by the quality of play,
he did say, “If spring practice
was about 20 days longer we
might get some work in, and with
hard work we could cure most of
the problems.”
