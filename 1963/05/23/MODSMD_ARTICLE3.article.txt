# Area Architect to Talk, Show Resident Designs
## 
### 
Warren Callister will present a j
slide-illustrated talk on his Bay 1
Area architecture this evening at |
7:30 in room 320. The Student i
A.I.A. presents this open meeting ;
for architecture and non-architec
ture students.
Callister’s best-known work is j
in the field of residences. “Due to
the difficulty in finding, let alone j
viewing most private residences, j
it is a rare opportunity to look at
the designer’s personal color,
slides,” says Rob Cormack, stu
dent A.I.A. representative.
Callister stands alone among I
the Bay Area’s lop architects in
his refusal to seek licensing by
the State Architectural Board. He
fools architecture is artistic ex
pression and if poets and artists
don’t need licenses then why ar
chitects?
