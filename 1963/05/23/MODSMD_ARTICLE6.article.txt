# Final Decision on Class Government Will Head LASSU Agenda Tonight
## 
### 
Final vote on class government j
heads the LASSU agenda tonight.
LASSU will also vote on Political
Union and HR by-laws, and on
quorum and membership disci
pline proposals.
Class government was rejected
by undergraduate voters last
Thursday, but LASSU will offici
ally decide the issue in a roll call
vote tonight.
If approved, the class govern
ment proposal, presented by the
freshman, sophomore, and junior
class presidents, will set up social
committees under LASSU to re
place the existing elected offices.
Only the senior class government
will remain as it now stands.
The Political Union by-laws
proposal provides for an execu-;
tive committee to cordinate po-1
litical activities on campus. It
would bo composed of the presi
dent of the Political Union, three
vice-presidents, the business man
ager, and the heads of groups
registered under the Political
Union. A minimum of fifteen stu
dents may form a group which
would be like an existing caucus
but no longer called a caucus.
The executive council would re
main the only voting body, but
would include greater representa
tion.
The HR by-laws will incorpor
ate a new executive board of nine
members. The policy board, com
posed of heads of the various
desks, will be given the power to
reverse executive board decisions
by a two-thirds vote.

The new quorum proposal will
allow members to send substi
tutes to make up a quorum. Mem
bers who miss three meetings or
do not send an authorized substi
tute will be dropped from the
LASSU roll for one year. The
constituency must then vote to
replace the member. The object
is to combat apathetic member
ship.
