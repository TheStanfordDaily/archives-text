United Press International
BIRMINGHAM. Ala. A federal judge refused yesterday to
interfere with city school officials’ decision to suspend or expel
1,081 Negro students who cut classes to take part in recent racial
demonstrations. The ruling, which put further strain on an already
shaky truce in this steel city, came moments after President Ken
nedy told a news conference ho would have “no choice” other than
to order federal troops and marshals to enforce desegregation of
the University of Alabama, should state authorities defy a court
order. The ruling concerning the 1,081 Birmingham pupils was
handed down by Judge Clarence Allgood. He said “this court cannot
conceive of a federal court saying to the board of education ... it
should lake no action under the circumstances.” Mrs. Constance
Baker Motely of New York, one of the attorneys for the Negro
students, said, “The decision is to be appealed immediately to the
U.S. sth Circuit Court.” Judge Allgood said he was “shocked to see
hundreds of school children ranging in age from six to 16 running
loose and wild and without direction over the streets of Birmingham”
during recent demonstrations.

POPE SUFFERS RELAPSE -VATICAN CITY Pope John XXIII,
apparently suffering a relapse from a persistent internal disorder,
was forced Monday to cancel abruptly a general audience with
25,000 persons and begin a period of absolute rest. Two Italian
doctors were placed on day and night duty inside the Vatican.
Italian papers in bold headlines said his condition was ‘‘visibly de
teriorating” and hinted again he had cancer. Vatican sources have
refused to confirm or deny the persistent reports even as the Pope’s
health fluctuated widely but seemed generally to be declining
generally.
