(Editors’ note: This Ls the second of u
series of articles dealing with undergraduate
education at Stanford. Quoted statements

official statements of |K>licy.)
In yesterday’s article the attitude that
research and teaching ability are positively
correlated in the ideal type of university
professor was discussed. There is another
school of thought recognizing a basic di
vision among types of teachers which should
bo considered in promotion and hiring. Dr,
W. H. Cowley, Jacks professor of Higher
Education, divides them into three groups:
1) Those who teach and organize knowl
edge for understanding only are “logocen
tric”; 2) Those who teach practical knowl
edge to be applied are "practocentric”; and
3) Those whose teaching is centered in the
people they teach are “democentric.” The
first two types are mostly to be found in
graduate courses, according to Cowley, while
the third supplies "liberal education.” The
third type organizes his teaching from the
ideas of the other two, and this research he

must do is just as extensive as theirs in its
own way. Since raises in salary are being
determined by productivity, the democen
trist, whose dedication to teaching takes too
much to allow research too, is being ignored.
ALTHOUGH some outstanding exceptions
manage to combine effectively all three kinds
of teaching. Cowley said that in general,
teachers will fall into one of these three
categories. He believes that universities “are
being operated on the assumption that all
their men are at least double-edged in this
respect,” to the detriment of undergraduates
who may benefit more from democentric
teachers than from logocentric ones.
Dr. J. D. Black, Director of the Counsel
ing and Testing Service, agrees with Cow
ley’s distinction for (he most part, and
thinks that “perhaps there should be some
endowed chairs for full professors interested
primarily in undergraduate teaching, not
research—or some schools within the uni
versity should admit only carefully selected
students who are definitely continuing in
that field, keeping undergraduate courses
separate.
Besides the possibility that undergradu

ates receive a poorer education when taught
by researchers rather than by “democen
trists,” some men see other dangers in giving
too much emphasis to productivity in pro
motion and hiring.
DR. W. H. STONE, director of the Fresh
man English Program, believes that the
“publish or perish” idea is still operating at
Stanford with a fair degree of severity: “It
starts a young man off in his profession
under great pressure and anxiety to estab
lish himself by publishing so that he can be
promoted to associate professor and have
tenure.

According to Dr. R. Nevitt Sanford, Di
rector of the Human Problems Study Insti
tute, “the pressure to publish may lead a
man to write something which is easily
published. The situation would be to produce
only one or two articles per year, to be done
thoroughly on a topic he is really interest**!
in. He added, however, that “as it stands,
the publication record is still the best yawl
stick for judging men.”
In fact, the danger for teachers may lie
in not too much research, but in too little,
suggested Dr. Kenneth J. Arrow, Acting

Executive Head of Economics. The ability
of “a teacher who does little or no research
while teaching is likely to decline as he falls
behind in his field.”
According to Dr. Philip Rhinelander of
the philosophy department, the whole ques
tion of how much emphasis is given to un
dergraduate teaching is a matter of atmos
phere. “From the president’s office on down,
there must be an attitude that good teaching
must be rewarded. This does not exist at
Stanford.” This is reflected, he feels, in the
budgeting: the School of Humanities and
Sciences, for instance, does about two-thirds
of the undergraduate teaching but does not
receive this share of the budget, according
to Rhinelander.
Black pointed out that with the present
great interest in graduate training, the grad
uate students should be able to bear more
of their full share of expenses.
DR. ROBERT J. WERT, vice-provost, ob
served that the president, faculty and trus
tees are on the whole very aware of the
necessity to keep a proper balance between
teaching and research activities. At present
a proposal for creating a special office, dean

of an undergraduate division, is under con
sideration; a selected committee of dedicated
professors working under this dean would
focus attention on problems of undergradu
ates. There is a constant money problem,
The quality of teachers depends not only
on the criteria used to hire and promote
them, as several noted, but also on what is
done to improve their teaching once they
begin. There is not much consideration now
as to conditions favorable to good teaching,
according to Sanford. ‘‘University people
feel that teaching can’t be studied; there is
great distrust of ‘educational methods.”
Much discussion has gone on, and will
continue, about such problems as lack of a
conclusive test for good teaching, the rela
tive importance of research in making a man
a good teacher: the extent to which a real
university should be concerned with under
graduates. These and others are being faced
not only by Stanford but by universities
throughout the country.
Monday’s article will deal with the
teaching assistant at Stanford; the method
of selection, the effectiveness, suggested im
provements in the system, etc;.

In yesterday’s article the attitude that
research and teaching ability are positively
correlated in the ideal type of university
professor was discussed. There is another
school of thought recognizing a basic di
vision among types of teachers which should
bo considered in promotion and hiring. Dr,
W. H. Cowley, Jacks professor of Higher
Education, divides them into three groups:
1) Those who teach and organize knowl
edge for understanding only are “logocen
tric”; 2) Those who teach practical knowl
edge to be applied are "practocentric”; and
3) Those whose teaching is centered in the
people they teach are “democentric.” The
first two types are mostly to be found in
graduate courses, according to Cowley, while
the third supplies "liberal education.” The
third type organizes his teaching from the
ideas of the other two, and this research he

must do is just as extensive as theirs in its
own way. Since raises in salary are being
determined by productivity, the democen
trist, whose dedication to teaching takes too
much to allow research too, is being ignored.
ALTHOUGH some outstanding exceptions
manage to combine effectively all three kinds
of teaching. Cowley said that in general,
teachers will fall into one of these three
categories. He believes that universities “are
being operated on the assumption that all
their men are at least double-edged in this
respect,” to the detriment of undergraduates
who may benefit more from democentric
teachers than from logocentric ones.
Dr. J. D. Black, Director of the Counsel
ing and Testing Service, agrees with Cow
ley’s distinction for (he most part, and
thinks that “perhaps there should be some
endowed chairs for full professors interested
primarily in undergraduate teaching, not
research—or some schools within the uni
versity should admit only carefully selected
students who are definitely continuing in
that field, keeping undergraduate courses
separate.
Besides the possibility that undergradu

ates receive a poorer education when taught
by researchers rather than by “democen
trists,” some men see other dangers in giving
too much emphasis to productivity in pro
motion and hiring.
DR. W. H. STONE, director of the Fresh
man English Program, believes that the
“publish or perish” idea is still operating at
Stanford with a fair degree of severity: “It
starts a young man off in his profession
under great pressure and anxiety to estab
lish himself by publishing so that he can be
promoted to associate professor and have
tenure.

According to Dr. R. Nevitt Sanford, Di
rector of the Human Problems Study Insti
tute, “the pressure to publish may lead a
man to write something which is easily
published. The situation would be to produce
only one or two articles per year, to be done
thoroughly on a topic he is really interest**!
in. He added, however, that “as it stands,
the publication record is still the best yawl
stick for judging men.”
In fact, the danger for teachers may lie
in not too much research, but in too little,
suggested Dr. Kenneth J. Arrow, Acting

Executive Head of Economics. The ability
of “a teacher who does little or no research
while teaching is likely to decline as he falls
behind in his field.”
According to Dr. Philip Rhinelander of
the philosophy department, the whole ques
tion of how much emphasis is given to un
dergraduate teaching is a matter of atmos
phere. “From the president’s office on down,
there must be an attitude that good teaching
must be rewarded. This does not exist at
Stanford.” This is reflected, he feels, in the
budgeting: the School of Humanities and
Sciences, for instance, does about two-thirds
of the undergraduate teaching but does not
receive this share of the budget, according
to Rhinelander.
Black pointed out that with the present
great interest in graduate training, the grad
uate students should be able to bear more
of their full share of expenses.
DR. ROBERT J. WERT, vice-provost, ob
served that the president, faculty and trus
tees are on the whole very aware of the
necessity to keep a proper balance between
teaching and research activities. At present
a proposal for creating a special office, dean

of an undergraduate division, is under con
sideration; a selected committee of dedicated
professors working under this dean would
focus attention on problems of undergradu
ates. There is a constant money problem,
The quality of teachers depends not only
on the criteria used to hire and promote
them, as several noted, but also on what is
done to improve their teaching once they
begin. There is not much consideration now
as to conditions favorable to good teaching,
according to Sanford. ‘‘University people
feel that teaching can’t be studied; there is
great distrust of ‘educational methods.”
Much discussion has gone on, and will
continue, about such problems as lack of a
conclusive test for good teaching, the rela
tive importance of research in making a man
a good teacher: the extent to which a real
university should be concerned with under
graduates. These and others are being faced
not only by Stanford but by universities
throughout the country.

bo considered in promotion and hiring. Dr,
W. H. Cowley, Jacks professor of Higher
Education, divides them into three groups:
1) Those who teach and organize knowl
edge for understanding only are “logocen
tric”; 2) Those who teach practical knowl
edge to be applied are "practocentric”; and
3) Those whose teaching is centered in the
people they teach are “democentric.” The
first two types are mostly to be found in
graduate courses, according to Cowley, while
the third supplies "liberal education.” The
third type organizes his teaching from the
ideas of the other two, and this research he

must do is just as extensive as theirs in its
own way. Since raises in salary are being
determined by productivity, the democen
trist, whose dedication to teaching takes too
much to allow research too, is being ignored.
ALTHOUGH some outstanding exceptions
manage to combine effectively all three kinds
of teaching. Cowley said that in general,
teachers will fall into one of these three
categories. He believes that universities “are
being operated on the assumption that all
their men are at least double-edged in this
respect,” to the detriment of undergraduates
who may benefit more from democentric
teachers than from logocentric ones.
Dr. J. D. Black, Director of the Counsel
ing and Testing Service, agrees with Cow
ley’s distinction for (he most part, and
thinks that “perhaps there should be some
endowed chairs for full professors interested
primarily in undergraduate teaching, not
research—or some schools within the uni
versity should admit only carefully selected
students who are definitely continuing in
that field, keeping undergraduate courses
separate.
Besides the possibility that undergradu

ates receive a poorer education when taught
by researchers rather than by “democen
trists,” some men see other dangers in giving
too much emphasis to productivity in pro
motion and hiring.
DR. W. H. STONE, director of the Fresh
man English Program, believes that the
“publish or perish” idea is still operating at
Stanford with a fair degree of severity: “It
starts a young man off in his profession
under great pressure and anxiety to estab
lish himself by publishing so that he can be
promoted to associate professor and have
tenure.

According to Dr. R. Nevitt Sanford, Di
rector of the Human Problems Study Insti
tute, “the pressure to publish may lead a
man to write something which is easily
published. The situation would be to produce
only one or two articles per year, to be done
thoroughly on a topic he is really interest**!
in. He added, however, that “as it stands,
the publication record is still the best yawl
stick for judging men.”
In fact, the danger for teachers may lie
in not too much research, but in too little,
suggested Dr. Kenneth J. Arrow, Acting

Executive Head of Economics. The ability
of “a teacher who does little or no research
while teaching is likely to decline as he falls
behind in his field.”
According to Dr. Philip Rhinelander of
the philosophy department, the whole ques
tion of how much emphasis is given to un
dergraduate teaching is a matter of atmos
phere. “From the president’s office on down,
there must be an attitude that good teaching
must be rewarded. This does not exist at
Stanford.” This is reflected, he feels, in the
budgeting: the School of Humanities and
Sciences, for instance, does about two-thirds
of the undergraduate teaching but does not
receive this share of the budget, according
to Rhinelander.
Black pointed out that with the present
great interest in graduate training, the grad
uate students should be able to bear more
of their full share of expenses.
DR. ROBERT J. WERT, vice-provost, ob
served that the president, faculty and trus
tees are on the whole very aware of the
necessity to keep a proper balance between
teaching and research activities. At present
a proposal for creating a special office, dean

of an undergraduate division, is under con
sideration; a selected committee of dedicated
professors working under this dean would
focus attention on problems of undergradu
ates. There is a constant money problem,
The quality of teachers depends not only
on the criteria used to hire and promote
them, as several noted, but also on what is
done to improve their teaching once they
begin. There is not much consideration now
as to conditions favorable to good teaching,
according to Sanford. ‘‘University people
feel that teaching can’t be studied; there is
great distrust of ‘educational methods.”
Much discussion has gone on, and will
continue, about such problems as lack of a
conclusive test for good teaching, the rela
tive importance of research in making a man
a good teacher: the extent to which a real
university should be concerned with under
graduates. These and others are being faced
not only by Stanford but by universities
throughout the country.

In yesterday’s article the attitude that
research and teaching ability are positively
correlated in the ideal type of university
professor was discussed. There is another
school of thought recognizing a basic di
vision among types of teachers which should
bo considered in promotion and hiring. Dr,
W. H. Cowley, Jacks professor of Higher
