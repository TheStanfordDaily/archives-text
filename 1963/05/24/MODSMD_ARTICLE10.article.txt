# Behavioral Sciences Helpful for Historians

### SHEILA RICKETTS 
“You can't describe a social category in
the contemporary period without trying to
find out what such behavioral sciences as
sociology and economics can do for you,’’
said Dr. Gordon Wright, Stanford historian,
explaining the influence of the behavioral
sciences on his recently completed hook on
the French peasantry, “Rural Revolution in
France.”
Wright is one of the five historians among
the 50 fellows working at the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences
in the 1962-1063 academic year.
In addition to Wright, this year's histori
ans are Dr. Robert Divine, University of Tex
as; Dr. John A. Garraty, Columbia Universi
ty: and Dr. Frank E. Manuel, Brandeis Uni
versity: Dr. Moyer Schapiro, Columbia Uni
versity, is working this year in art history.
Wright’s book on the French peasantry,
to appear this fall, studies its emergence in
the last 30 years “from a kind of amorphous,
passive, negative kind of society to a new
level of self consciousness and self-assertive
ness.” He states that a new elite has ap
peared among the peasants and that this
elite is "one of the most vigorous and pro
gressive groups in France.”
WRIGHT HAS ALSO begun a book on
World War II which will be part of the
“Rise of Modern Europe” series. He hopes
to study the impact of an experience such as

the war on the social behavior and interac
tion of the people involved.
Divine, having recently completed a book
on American neutrality legislation in the
1930’5, “The Illusion of Neutrality,” has now
turned his attention to a study of the
“change in American public opinion toward
foreign affairs during World War 11, the
change away from the isolationism of the
’3o’s lo the sentiment for American partici
pation in the world organization.”
DIVINE KEELS that this change in pub
lic sentiment reflects “the American desire
for a total solution to world problems.”
“When neutrality legislation proved to
be an illusion,” he said, “there was a ten
dency to go to the other extreme. The popu
lar reasoning was that if we had joined the
League, there never would have been a
World War 11. The obvious thing to do after
World War II was, therefore, to do what we
should have done after World War I.”
The Gold War has been educational, ac
cording to Divine, but the same search for
a total solution permeates the American
scene today. The groups on the far right
want to “win a victory” in the Cold War
without ever precisely defining that victory
while the “ban-the-bomb” groups feel that
the elimination of the bomb, an achievement
which is “crucial, but not in itself the an
swer,” will solve all of our needs.
Garraty is doing a book which will be
part of the “New American Nation Series.”

It will deal with United States history be
tween 1877 and 1890.
Manuel has just finished a book, “Isaac
Newton; Historian,” which appeared May
19. The work is a synthesis of Newton’s
manuscripts which deal with all aspects of
ancient history and church doctrine. Manuel
attempts to “present the intellectual climate
in which this key figure in modern science
grew up.”
Since the completion of this book, has
has been working on a series of lectures
entitled "Shapes of Philosophical History.”
They will deal with the major motifs in the
philosophy of history since Augustine.
Schapiro, the art historian, is completing
a book called “Impressionism” which will
appear sometime in the next year. The book
is only partly a history. In it, he compares
impressionism with Chinese, Roman and 17th
century art, seeing many similarities as
well as differences and speculating about
the possible reasons for these similarities.
HE ATTEMPTS to explain why impres
sionism developed at this time in France in
stead of elsewhere and then why the taste
for it changed and people began to regard
it as inferior art.
EAC H OF THE HISTORIANS is follow
ing his own field of interest, as do all of the
fellows at the center, and yet it is possible
that each will broaden his understanding
through contact with the behavioral sciences,
according to Cutler.
