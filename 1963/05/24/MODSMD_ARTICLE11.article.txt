# Class Government Ended; Ruling Stands As By-Law
## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
Legislature Speaker Brad Efron ruled that the initiative abol
ishing class government, which was passed by the student body
on May 16, stands as By-law. An appeal to his ruling was defeat
ed. The present funds of the freshman, sophomore, and junior
classes will be put in trust and will be available during the

senior year of each class.
Legislature, noting that the
Doan’s Office last week reversed
themselves on small group over
night policy, “urged the Admin
istration to seriously re-examine
the assumptions and attitudes

(concerning the Fundamental
Standard) underlying (thechange
in policy).”
Julie Peck, chairman of the
AWS Social Regulations Commit
tee, explained the situation:
1) At the beginning of Spring
Quarter the AWS Social Regula
tions Committee issued overnight
regulations “allowing Stanford
students to take advantage of
cultural and recreational activi
ties which are located in areas
adjacent to the campus. The AWS
policy enabled 3, 4, or 5 couples to
attend with an adult chaperone
events such as ski-weekends, con
certs, special art exhibits and
festivals which make it impossi
ble for them to return to the cam
pus by 2:30 a.m.
2) Last week, Miss Peck and a
number of others, including rep
resentatives from the Dean’s Of
fice, decided to remove “recrea
tional activities” from the pur
view of the AWS Policy. They
did this because the “recreational
activities” section seemed to be
in conflict with ASSU overnight
regulations which require adult
chaperones on small group over
nights. Their action was precipi
tated by an incident on a camp
ing trip overnight.
In other business, Legislature
approved a Speech Association
Budget of $6884, an HR budget
of $5400, the Master Budget of
$72,210, $1671 for a nine-man del
egation to the NSA convention
this summer, $450 for cards for
the AXE Commission, and $l2O
for faculty tickets to a semi for
mal ASSU Banquet to bo held
next Thursday.
