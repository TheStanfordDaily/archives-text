## 'U.S.-Soviet Contrasts Extreme'

(Editors’ note; .Mr. Barnnm was a student at Stanford-in-
France, Group V. The tour through the U.S.S.R. was conducted
under tIn* auspices of the Scandinavian Travel Service*. This is
flic- second of a two-part series.)

Along side Russia’s lack of consumer prosperity is a second
conspicuous void: news. American newspapers may be unduly
optimistic about our prospects in Vietnam, and much of what
emanates from the White House may be “managed,” but in Rus
sia news as we define the term does not exist. Soviet dailies con
fine themselves to scholarly interpretations of Marxism-Lenin
ism, exhortations for more conscientious and vigorous travail
on the part of the people, and feature stories about outstandingly
productive factories or individuals. Current events are rarely
treated, except insofar as they are blatantly damaging to the
West’s image, or conveniently adaptable to that end.
As a result, the Soviet milieu is terribly dry and sloganized,
which may come as a shock to the tourist expecting to encounter
colorful, robust, tzarlst Russia. The atmosphere seems particu
larly stifling to the Westerner, accustomed as he is to a fairly
adequate supply of straight news and various editorial points of
view.
Even pictorial art is deployed in the service of this strenu
ous program of internal propaganda. It is an essential part of
the Soviet citizen’s one-sided diet. While browsing in a Lenin
grad art shop, we discovered the sort of painting with which the
Russian is obliged to decorate his home. Instead of the pastoral
or harbor scene which one is likely to find adorning the Ameri
can living room, the Leningrader is forced to choose, for lack
of any alternative, between a picture of Lenin, either portrait
or heroic pose, and one of a youthful Soviet couple busily hut
happily riveting girders on a skyscraper.
All this is in contrast not only with the West, per se, but
with at least one other so-called Communist bloc country, Yugo
slavia. There, Western papers and books circulate freely (one
Yugoslavian doctor we visited had just picked up a copy of
“Animal Farm,” of all things, at his local bookstore). Agricul
ture is almost entirely individual (as opposed to more thorough
ly communized Bulgaria, where one sees teams of white-scarved
women in the fields along the road.). Moreover, the doctor told
us, there is no reason for Yugoslavians to want Western clo
thing; in the last five years Yugoslavia has begun to produce
sufficient and high quality consumer goods domestically.
Zagreb and Belgrade, unlike Leningrad and Moscow, are
modern and bustling. But above all, Yugoslavians are friendly
and open, and not so dead sure as Russians, or Americans for
that matter, that their system is perfect.
Seeing Russia first-hand, even cursorily, goes a long way
towards explaining the closed nature of Soviet society. Russia
is strong and capable; the economists tell us that and the cos
monauts prove it. But this reality docs not negate the fact that
Russian prowess can easily pass unappreciated on the basis of
the “appearance” of Russia, her people as they circulate in the
streets, her buildings as they stand in evident tiredness.
The Soviet Union may well be liberalizing, but the contrasts
in prosperity and freedom of movement and expression between
Russia and the West are still too great. Herein may lie a reason
ably adequate explanation of the seemingly excessive constric
tive policies of the Soviet government in respect to its citizens.
For it would be foolish and dangerous, indeed catastrophic for
the government, with a goal in mind from which it refuses to
be deterred, to permit its citizens at this time even a minute
taste of the consumer prosperity and freedom of which they
have been so long deprived.
