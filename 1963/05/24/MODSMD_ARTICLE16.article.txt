## Incident at Civ Lecture 
### LINDA HESS Contributing Editor 
Last week a Stanford professor, in a prudish display of ill
humor, had the indelicacy to write a letter to The Daily protest
ing water-bomb riots at Wilbur, which forced him to disband a
seminar meeting at his home and, incidentally, succeeded in
“scaring the wdts out of my three-year-old daughter.’’
He contrasted official altitudes toward such riots (reflected
in a bystanding policeman’s benign, “Well, the University doesn’t
frown on water fights”) with the drastic and immediate action
taken by the University against the peace vigillers, who, for
standing quietly in a public street, were deprived by police of
their student body cards and threatened with expulsion.
Now the men of Wilbur were understandably incensed by
this professorial frumpery over' what was, after all, no more
than good, traditional, collegiate fun. And between Friday, when
the letter appeared, and Monday, when the professor was sched
uled to deliver the weekly Western Civ lecture—the word got
around that all true-hearted freshman men would be out to
“get Roszak.”
They accordingly executed a bold vendetta. The loudspeaker
system was sabotaged, and at various intervals during the lec
ture the long, loud bleats of alarm clocks resounded throughout
the hall.
The professor continued his lecture. It was even reported
that the lecture was an outstanding one. But neither the stu
dents’ attention nor the lecturer’s morale was worth very much
by the time the hour was over.
Too bad I don’t have the dry wit of a K W Smith. If I did, I
could just say something dryly witty, like:
Oh look at the Winds of Freedom.
See them blow.
Blow blow blow
See the vigillers in the rain.
Aren’t the vigillers nasty to disturb the peace?
Nasty, nasty vigillers.
Let us call up the Student Police
the Riot Squad
the National Guard.
Winds of Freedom were not made to disturb the peace.
Not “my” peace anyway.
Why are the vigillers so nasty?
Why don’t they do something more wholesome
more collegiate
like staging riots,
breaking up classes,
and frightening small children?
Why don’t they devote their energy to the scattering of semi
nars,
the art of RF,
the punishment of prudish profs?
What fun it is to be a college boy.
But, unlike K W, I tend to get earnest. That probably comes
from reading too many Daily editorials. I tend to sympathize
with that other professor who wrote another letter to the Daily
on Wednesday, in which he designated the perpetrators of the
Civ lecture sabotage as “beneath contempt” and "unworthy of
admission to the most mediocre institution of higher education.”
If the scene in Mem Aud on Monday produced little more
than a mild Ho Hum on the part of unconcerned students, it
should provoke some serious thought on the part of anyone
who values the time and money he is investing in Stanford,
which, as everyone knows, is a Great University.
True, unruly ruckuses now and then are part of the college
routine, and the policeman probably knew what he was doing
when he left this one to wear itself out.
But that a professor’s reasonable complaint, voiced through
normal channels of campus communication, should inspire an
immediate movement for reprisal, is fairly startling. And that
the reprisal should take the form of a malicious personal attack,
an attempt to ridicule a professor in public, while at the same
time disrupting academic procedures, is deplorable.
It drives home James Baldwin’s bitter conviction that, de
spite our pious and enthusiastic support of Birmingham Ne
groes. we are all hypocrites. Birmingham is comfortably remote
from Stanford, haven of the bright and the broad-minded.
That this great university should complacently foster such
plainly anti-intellectual and anti-humanitarian attitudes makes
me worry more than a little about the investment of all my time
and money.

the art of RF,
the punishment of prudish profs?
What fun it is to be a college boy.
But, unlike K W, I tend to get earnest. That probably comes
from reading too many Daily editorials. I tend to sympathize
with that other professor who wrote another letter to the Daily
on Wednesday, in which he designated the perpetrators of the
Civ lecture sabotage as “beneath contempt” and "unworthy of
admission to the most mediocre institution of higher education.”
If the scene in Mem Aud on Monday produced little more
than a mild Ho Hum on the part of unconcerned students, it
should provoke some serious thought on the part of anyone
who values the time and money he is investing in Stanford,
which, as everyone knows, is a Great University.
True, unruly ruckuses now and then are part of the college
routine, and the policeman probably knew what he was doing
when he left this one to wear itself out.
But that a professor’s reasonable complaint, voiced through
normal channels of campus communication, should inspire an
immediate movement for reprisal, is fairly startling. And that
the reprisal should take the form of a malicious personal attack,
an attempt to ridicule a professor in public, while at the same
time disrupting academic procedures, is deplorable.
It drives home James Baldwin’s bitter conviction that, de
spite our pious and enthusiastic support of Birmingham Ne
groes. we are all hypocrites. Birmingham is comfortably remote
from Stanford, haven of the bright and the broad-minded.
That this great university should complacently foster such
plainly anti-intellectual and anti-humanitarian attitudes makes
me worry more than a little about the investment of all my time
and money.
Last week a Stanford professor, in a prudish display of ill
humor, had the indelicacy to write a letter to The Daily protest
ing water-bomb riots at Wilbur, which forced him to disband a
seminar meeting at his home and, incidentally, succeeded in
“scaring the wdts out of my three-year-old daughter.’’
He contrasted official altitudes toward such riots (reflected
in a bystanding policeman’s benign, “Well, the University doesn’t
frown on water fights”) with the drastic and immediate action
taken by the University against the peace vigillers, who, for
standing quietly in a public street, were deprived by police of
their student body cards and threatened with expulsion.
Now the men of Wilbur were understandably incensed by
this professorial frumpery over' what was, after all, no more
than good, traditional, collegiate fun. And between Friday, when
the letter appeared, and Monday, when the professor was sched
uled to deliver the weekly Western Civ lecture—the word got
around that all true-hearted freshman men would be out to
“get Roszak.”
They accordingly executed a bold vendetta. The loudspeaker
system was sabotaged, and at various intervals during the lec
ture the long, loud bleats of alarm clocks resounded throughout
the hall.
The professor continued his lecture. It was even reported
that the lecture was an outstanding one. But neither the stu
dents’ attention nor the lecturer’s morale was worth very much
by the time the hour was over.
Too bad I don’t have the dry wit of a K W Smith. If I did, I
could just say something dryly witty, like:
Oh look at the Winds of Freedom.
See them blow.
Blow blow blow
See the vigillers in the rain.
Aren’t the vigillers nasty to disturb the peace?
Nasty, nasty vigillers.
Let us call up the Student Police
the Riot Squad
the National Guard.
Winds of Freedom were not made to disturb the peace.
Not “my” peace anyway.
Why are the vigillers so nasty?
Why don’t they do something more wholesome
more collegiate
like staging riots,
breaking up classes,
and frightening small children?
Why don’t they devote their energy to the scattering of semi
nars,
the art of RF,
the punishment of prudish profs?
What fun it is to be a college boy.
