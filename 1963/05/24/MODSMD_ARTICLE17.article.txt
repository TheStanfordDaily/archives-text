Editors, The Daily:
It was embarrasing to be a member of the audience at the
recent Civ Lecture by Dr. Roszak. Some of the cream of Stan
ford’s crop showed their ingenuity by periodically setting off
alarm clocks in order to disrupt, or, perhaps, bring to an end
Dr. Roszak’s lecture on Monday. Much to the disgust of those
who were there to learn, a certain group found it necessary to
fight a private war with Dr. Roszak, using childish maneuvers
designed to revenge themselves. It is shocking to think that stu
dents would take the time to plan a personal sabotage at thei
expense of others wishing to take advantage of Dr. Roszak’s
scholarship. It is only sensible to'think that if sdme'students
have a personal disagreement with Dr. Roszak, they should find
a more mature, less vulgar and noisy way to express them
selves. Fortunately, Dr. Roszak’s eloquent, succinct and pro
found lecture overpowered the annoying behavior of a few mem
bers and failed to disinterest an enthusiastic audience. The over
whelming applause proved that the disturbance was minimal in
the face of such impressive words. Indeed, this segment ful
filled Dr. Roszak’s powerful reading of T. S. Elliot, for “those
are the hollow men.”

Editors, The Daily:
Once again a decision has been made surreptitiously by "the
powers that be.” According to the Wednesday Daily, the “Gov
ernor Stanford,” first engine of the Central Pacific Railroad, is
being “loaned,” hence moved, from the Stanford Museum to
San Francisco, As a railroader at, heart, I am saddened by this
news, for if the engine escapes the hoodlums during its storage
in Richmond ( note Mr. Deither’s letter on Wednesday! it may
not escape the curators in San Francisco who, in true Walt Dis
ney fashion, will probably paint it red, white, and blue and re
name it the “Governor Brown.” Why the engine is going remains
a mystery to me; at least no reasons were mentioned in The
Daily. Perhaps the art dilettanti need room to exhibit (heaven
forbid) their canvases on which are abstractly slopped various
unintelligible blobs.
But it seems to me this locomotive has a historical signifi
cance and importance, and it is regrettable that the Museum has
seen fit to remove it. The “Governor” today is a symbol less of
the noble Leland, than of the indispensable role the railroads had
in the expansion and development of the country during the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. That was an era before
a traveler had to chose between inhaling fumes from a diesel
or gasoline engine or losing his dinner at 30,000 feet, an era
when Presidents journeyed by rail in luxurious private cars.
Mountainous narrow-gauge railroads linked the booming West
ern mining camps with the outside world, and freight trains
hauled gold and silver by the ton from the Rockies and the
Sierras, and the steam engine was an American institution. It
was the time of the Robber Barons, the financial magnates, when
Hill, Harriman, and Vanderbilt fought to establish railroad em
pires. Those were the days for Barry Goldwater!
Be that as it may, I wish the “Governor Stanford” well in
its new location. And I hope that when the Museum decides to
“loan” away its famous golden spike (which, if I am not mis
taken, Stanford, after a couple of ill-aimed blows with a sledge,
managed to drive at Promontory, Utah, in May of 1869, thus
completing the transcontinental railroad)—l hope that when
the spike must go, the Museum will think of me first.

Dear Stanford,
Please don’t take the train away.
Sincerely,
Joel Anderson (age V/t)
