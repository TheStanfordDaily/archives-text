# TROJANS FAVORED BY 10 POINTS
## Trackmen Seek Upset Over USC in Big Six Meet at Cal 
### PETE KING 
Stanford’s trackmen journey to
Berkeley tomorrow for the
AAWU championship meet, and,

as usual, it figures to be a elose
meet with the Indians balling
their nemesis this season, the
USC Trojans. Field events start
at 12:45, with track events at 1:30
at Cal’s Edwards Field.
USC has won the meet 21 of
the last 22 times it has been held,
and is favored tomorrow. Only
Stanford has any chance of beat
ing the Trojans, with UCLA, Cali
fornia, Washington, and Wash
ington State too weak to be
threats.

TROY HAS kept Stanford from
having what should be an over
whelmingly successful track year.
They nipped the Tribe in a dual
meet, 73-72, and just barely beat
Stanford at the Fresno Relays,
56-53. Had the Indians won these,
they would have broken a 26-yoar
and a 30-year Trojan domination,
respectively.
Tomorrow’s meet is being billed
as the best collegiate conference
meet of the year. Looking at best
performances, one would have to
agree. The meet includes two re
cent world record pole vaulters,
(he collegiate discus record hold
er, and the athletes with the best
season collegiate marks in the
javelin, high and intermediate
hurdles, triple jump, high jump,
and two-mile.

Tho elope sheet shows USC win
ning the meet by 10 points, but
in such a star-studded field, up
sets are bound to happen, and
the Indians just might get
enough support from Washing
ton, UCLA, and Cal to hold USC’s
point total down while piling up
a winning margin on superior
depth.
AT LEAST that’s the way Stan
ford coach Payton Jordan views
the meet. “We’re in the best
shape, physically and mentally,
that we’ve been in all year,” said
Jordan confidently this week. As
an indicator he pointed out the
fact that numerous Indian har
riers have been enjoying their
best practice of the year this
week.
Sophomore sprinter Larry Que
stad, who recently tied the 24-
year-old Stanford 100-yard dash
record of 9.4, has run the fastest
50-yard practice sprints of his
life this week, and is favored in
the dashes. Eric Frische, Phil
Lamoreaux, and Len Breschini
and the other mainstays of the
sprint crew. Their competition is
formidable, however, with four
other men having equalled or het
terod 9.5.
The distance races should fea
ture some fine Stanford-USC
duels. Julio Marin, the great Tro
jan two-miler, win face Stan
ford’s Paul Schlicke and Wcym
Kirkland in the three-mile and

| Harry McCalla in the mile. Since
I McCalla has a 31 a-second edge in
best mile rimes, Jordan has in
structed McCalla .just to run to
| win, hoping that Marin will tire
enough to allow Schlicke and
| Kirkland to beat him in the long
er distance. If needed, McCalla
jean run the three-mile to give
I Stanford depth points.
THE XBO LOOKS to be a grudge
race between Bob Miltz and Bill
j Pratt of Stanford, and SC’s Ke
i vin Hogan. Hogan has a much
I better time this year, 1:48.0, but
j both Indian runners have beaten
I him in a dual meet.
In the high hurdles, Card Steve
j Cortright will be trying to place
! higher than fifth. Two USC and
j two UCLA hurdlers have done
j better than Cortright’s 14.3, and
: beat him earlier in the year. How
j ever, in the 440-yd. intermediates,
I Cortright could finish second.
I Trojan Rex Cawley is out of
| reach, but teammate Brian Polk
inghorne has lost to Cortright in
j the intermediates previously.
Cortright’s third event, the triple
| jump, will be close. Three men
j have better distances, but Cort-
I right usually does his best near
| the season’s end, and could win it.
Big Dave Weill is a cinch win
ner in the discus for Stanford,
while shot putters Jack Chappie
and Steve Arch have an excellent
chance for a 1-2 finish. Poul vault
er Phil White, who has been very
erratic this season, does his best
when facing USC’s Mel Hein and
Mike Flanagan. He won’t have a
j chance against 16-footers Brian
i Sternberg and C. K. Yang, but
(could notch a third place.
[ YANG, who has consistently
j won three or four events in dual
, meets this year, will have his
problems tomorrow. He has a
chance for first in only the pole
vault and high hurdles. His duel
with Washington’s Sternberg
could'set another world record,
hut it’s been reported that Yang
has a backpain that will limit his
performance.
Stanford hopes for an upset
were hurt last week when the
AAWU coaches decided not to
run the 440-yd. relay. Stanford
has the best time and would be
favored if the event were held.
The scoring of the meet (5-4-3-2-1)
makes it difficult for a team to
win the meet on come-through
performances alone, and the drop
ping of the relay was a blow to
Indian hopes.
Stanford will be depending
heavily on Cal. Washington, and
UCLA to pile up points at USC’s
expense. If Washington's Jerry
Plowman can beat USC’s Dick
Cortese in the 100, or if Cal and
UCLA high jumpers can beat one
or both USC men, or if Yang can
win the high hurdles, the Indians
would have an excellent chance
for an upset.
Right after the meet, some of
(he Stanford athletes will head
for the Modesto relays, held to
morrow night. The school records
in the 440 relay, the 880 relay,
and the sprint medley could all
fall.

meet, 73-72, and just barely beat
Stanford at the Fresno Relays,
56-53. Had the Indians won these,
they would have broken a 26-yoar
and a 30-year Trojan domination,
respectively.
Tomorrow’s meet is being billed
as the best collegiate conference
meet of the year. Looking at best
performances, one would have to
agree. The meet includes two re
cent world record pole vaulters,
(he collegiate discus record hold
er, and the athletes with the best
season collegiate marks in the
javelin, high and intermediate
hurdles, triple jump, high jump,
and two-mile.

Tho elope sheet shows USC win
ning the meet by 10 points, but
in such a star-studded field, up
sets are bound to happen, and
the Indians just might get
enough support from Washing
ton, UCLA, and Cal to hold USC’s
point total down while piling up
a winning margin on superior
depth.
AT LEAST that’s the way Stan
ford coach Payton Jordan views
the meet. “We’re in the best
shape, physically and mentally,
that we’ve been in all year,” said
Jordan confidently this week. As
an indicator he pointed out the
fact that numerous Indian har
riers have been enjoying their
best practice of the year this
week.
Sophomore sprinter Larry Que
stad, who recently tied the 24-
year-old Stanford 100-yard dash
record of 9.4, has run the fastest
50-yard practice sprints of his
life this week, and is favored in
the dashes. Eric Frische, Phil
Lamoreaux, and Len Breschini
and the other mainstays of the
sprint crew. Their competition is
formidable, however, with four
other men having equalled or het
terod 9.5.
The distance races should fea
ture some fine Stanford-USC
duels. Julio Marin, the great Tro
jan two-miler, win face Stan
ford’s Paul Schlicke and Wcym
Kirkland in the three-mile and

| Harry McCalla in the mile. Since
I McCalla has a 31 a-second edge in
best mile rimes, Jordan has in
structed McCalla .just to run to
| win, hoping that Marin will tire
enough to allow Schlicke and
| Kirkland to beat him in the long
er distance. If needed, McCalla
jean run the three-mile to give
I Stanford depth points.
THE XBO LOOKS to be a grudge
race between Bob Miltz and Bill
j Pratt of Stanford, and SC’s Ke
i vin Hogan. Hogan has a much
I better time this year, 1:48.0, but
j both Indian runners have beaten
I him in a dual meet.
In the high hurdles, Card Steve
j Cortright will be trying to place
! higher than fifth. Two USC and
j two UCLA hurdlers have done
j better than Cortright’s 14.3, and
: beat him earlier in the year. How
j ever, in the 440-yd. intermediates,
I Cortright could finish second.
I Trojan Rex Cawley is out of
| reach, but teammate Brian Polk
inghorne has lost to Cortright in
j the intermediates previously.
Cortright’s third event, the triple
| jump, will be close. Three men
j have better distances, but Cort-
I right usually does his best near
| the season’s end, and could win it.
Big Dave Weill is a cinch win
ner in the discus for Stanford,
while shot putters Jack Chappie
and Steve Arch have an excellent
chance for a 1-2 finish. Poul vault
er Phil White, who has been very
erratic this season, does his best
when facing USC’s Mel Hein and
Mike Flanagan. He won’t have a
j chance against 16-footers Brian
i Sternberg and C. K. Yang, but
(could notch a third place.
[ YANG, who has consistently
j won three or four events in dual
, meets this year, will have his
problems tomorrow. He has a
chance for first in only the pole
vault and high hurdles. His duel
with Washington’s Sternberg
could'set another world record,
hut it’s been reported that Yang
has a backpain that will limit his
performance.
Stanford hopes for an upset
were hurt last week when the
AAWU coaches decided not to
run the 440-yd. relay. Stanford
has the best time and would be
favored if the event were held.
The scoring of the meet (5-4-3-2-1)
makes it difficult for a team to
win the meet on come-through
performances alone, and the drop
ping of the relay was a blow to
Indian hopes.
Stanford will be depending
heavily on Cal. Washington, and
UCLA to pile up points at USC’s
expense. If Washington's Jerry
Plowman can beat USC’s Dick
Cortese in the 100, or if Cal and
UCLA high jumpers can beat one
or both USC men, or if Yang can
win the high hurdles, the Indians
would have an excellent chance
for an upset.

in the 440 relay, the 880 relay,
and the sprint medley could all

USC has won the meet 21 of

enough support from Washing
ton, UCLA, and Cal to hold USC’s
point total down while piling up
a winning margin on superior
depth.
AT LEAST that’s the way Stan
ford coach Payton Jordan views
the meet. “We’re in the best
shape, physically and mentally,
that we’ve been in all year,” said
Jordan confidently this week. As
an indicator he pointed out the
fact that numerous Indian har
riers have been enjoying their
best practice of the year this
week.
Sophomore sprinter Larry Que
stad, who recently tied the 24-
year-old Stanford 100-yard dash
record of 9.4, has run the fastest
50-yard practice sprints of his
life this week, and is favored in
the dashes. Eric Frische, Phil
Lamoreaux, and Len Breschini
and the other mainstays of the
sprint crew. Their competition is
formidable, however, with four
other men having equalled or het
terod 9.5.
The distance races should fea
ture some fine Stanford-USC
duels. Julio Marin, the great Tro
jan two-miler, win face Stan
ford’s Paul Schlicke and Wcym
Kirkland in the three-mile and

| Harry McCalla in the mile. Since
I McCalla has a 31 a-second edge in
best mile rimes, Jordan has in
structed McCalla .just to run to
| win, hoping that Marin will tire
enough to allow Schlicke and
| Kirkland to beat him in the long
er distance. If needed, McCalla
jean run the three-mile to give
I Stanford depth points.
THE XBO LOOKS to be a grudge
race between Bob Miltz and Bill
j Pratt of Stanford, and SC’s Ke
i vin Hogan. Hogan has a much
I better time this year, 1:48.0, but
j both Indian runners have beaten
I him in a dual meet.
In the high hurdles, Card Steve
j Cortright will be trying to place
! higher than fifth. Two USC and
j two UCLA hurdlers have done
j better than Cortright’s 14.3, and
: beat him earlier in the year. How
j ever, in the 440-yd. intermediates,
I Cortright could finish second.
I Trojan Rex Cawley is out of
| reach, but teammate Brian Polk
inghorne has lost to Cortright in
j the intermediates previously.
Cortright’s third event, the triple
| jump, will be close. Three men
j have better distances, but Cort-
I right usually does his best near
| the season’s end, and could win it.
Big Dave Weill is a cinch win
ner in the discus for Stanford,
while shot putters Jack Chappie
and Steve Arch have an excellent
chance for a 1-2 finish. Poul vault
er Phil White, who has been very
erratic this season, does his best
when facing USC’s Mel Hein and
Mike Flanagan. He won’t have a
j chance against 16-footers Brian
i Sternberg and C. K. Yang, but
(could notch a third place.
[ YANG, who has consistently
j won three or four events in dual
, meets this year, will have his
problems tomorrow. He has a
chance for first in only the pole
vault and high hurdles. His duel
with Washington’s Sternberg
could'set another world record,
hut it’s been reported that Yang
has a backpain that will limit his
performance.
Stanford hopes for an upset
were hurt last week when the
AAWU coaches decided not to
run the 440-yd. relay. Stanford
has the best time and would be
favored if the event were held.
The scoring of the meet (5-4-3-2-1)
makes it difficult for a team to
win the meet on come-through
performances alone, and the drop
ping of the relay was a blow to
Indian hopes.
Stanford will be depending
heavily on Cal. Washington, and
UCLA to pile up points at USC’s
expense. If Washington's Jerry
Plowman can beat USC’s Dick
Cortese in the 100, or if Cal and
UCLA high jumpers can beat one
or both USC men, or if Yang can
win the high hurdles, the Indians
would have an excellent chance
for an upset.
Right after the meet, some of
(he Stanford athletes will head
for the Modesto relays, held to
morrow night. The school records
in the 440 relay, the 880 relay,
and the sprint medley could all
fall.
Stanford’s trackmen journey to
Berkeley tomorrow for the
AAWU championship meet, and,

as usual, it figures to be a elose
meet with the Indians balling
their nemesis this season, the
USC Trojans. Field events start
at 12:45, with track events at 1:30
at Cal’s Edwards Field.
USC has won the meet 21 of
the last 22 times it has been held,
and is favored tomorrow. Only
Stanford has any chance of beat
ing the Trojans, with UCLA, Cali
fornia, Washington, and Wash
ington State too weak to be
threats.

TROY HAS kept Stanford from
having what should be an over
whelmingly successful track year.
They nipped the Tribe in a dual
meet, 73-72, and just barely beat
Stanford at the Fresno Relays,
56-53. Had the Indians won these,
they would have broken a 26-yoar
and a 30-year Trojan domination,
respectively.
Tomorrow’s meet is being billed
as the best collegiate conference
meet of the year. Looking at best
performances, one would have to
agree. The meet includes two re
cent world record pole vaulters,
(he collegiate discus record hold
er, and the athletes with the best
season collegiate marks in the
javelin, high and intermediate
hurdles, triple jump, high jump,
and two-mile.

Tho elope sheet shows USC win
ning the meet by 10 points, but
in such a star-studded field, up
sets are bound to happen, and
the Indians just might get
enough support from Washing
ton, UCLA, and Cal to hold USC’s
point total down while piling up
