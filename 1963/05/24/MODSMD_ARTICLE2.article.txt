# Proposal Discouraged for World Student Conference
## 
### MAUREEN STRAIN Associate Editor 
A projected World Student Conference of a “maximum of
3000 participants seems to have temporarily run aground this
week, with discouraging statements from both the United States
National Student Association and the University People-to-People.
The Conference, inspired in part by the Communist World

Youth Festival held at Helsinki
last year, has been organized pri
marily by members of Stanford’s
Institute of International Rela
tions, to be held at various Bay
Area university and college cam
puses in the summer of 1964.
The NSA was to be in charge
of the all-important selection of
delegates.

cations, agriculture, education,
etc.
The major doubts expressed by
Shaul concerned the difficulties
in handling such a large number
of students, the feasibility of fol
low-up organization, and the
question of excluding political
overtones from the Conference.
Bill Dawson, National Director
of University People-to-People,
concurring in Mr. Shard’s doubts,
said in part, that both he and
Shaul “recognized the distinct
differences between their respec
tive organizations, but both feel
on this particular issue that a
mutual statement is necessary be
cause of the transcending influ
ence that the proposed World
Student Conference would have
in the areas” of both their pro
grams.
THE CONFERENCE, which
has a proposed budget of $860,000
to be administered by a Board of
Trustees who “own the project,
theoretically,” according to
Thompson, will have only those
enrolled students as officers.
So far, the organizers of the
project, mostly Stanford stu
dents. have contacted a number
of prominent Bay Area business
and professional leaders, many
of whom have agreed to bo listed j
as “actively in support of” the
project, Thompson said.
“From the very first wo have
consulted all the major student
organizations in this country," he
said, “and have received excellent
advice that has considerably in
fluenced our approach to the
goal. Wo intend to continue con
sulting those organizations, and
have reasons to anticipate the
same thoughtful advice wo are
used to in the past.”
IN EXPLAINING tho large
size and technical nature of the
proposed Conference, Thompson
said, “A major attempt of some
scope in this area of international
student cooperation is ’long over
due’ according to one diplomat.
“There have been many excel
lent programs with the same ulti
mate goals as ours but they
have been of insufficient scope
to meet the challenge success
fully.
“Any new program such as
ours inevitably encounters iner
tia and antagonism if only be
cause it is new and because it
came as a fresh approach. Most
attempts at international student
cooperation have been political in
objective and format; the aca
demic and the professional nature
of our conference eliminates the
possibilities inherent in a politi
cal conference.”
I IN HIS STATEMENT for the
I NSA, Shaul said “The com
mendable enthusiasm in the Bay
' Area might possibly be better
channelled into a smaller meeting
! of approximately 500 foreign stu
dents all of whom have finished a
year’s study in this country.”

IN A STATEMENT to The
Daily in which he voiced several
objections to the projected for
mat of the Conference, W. Den
nis Shaul, President of the Na
tional Student Association, said
that, although impressed with
the “enthusiasm and willingness
to discuss objections to the proj
eci ' of its representatives, “none
theless, we cannot endorse the
project at this time.”
W. Scott Thompson, president
of the Conference which has been
incorporated as a non-prof it or
ganization to be financed by do
nations, has been meeting in the
Hast this week with representa
t.ves of the NSA, University
F eople-10-People and the State
Department in an attempt to ob
tain their backing for the proj
ect.
HE STATED last night that the
“go, of the World Student Con
fers ce is to make use of that
lowest common denominator of
international understanding
professional aspirations that
transcend political and cultural
differences to provide a practi
cal asis for cooperation among
leaders of the international stu
dent community.”
In its criticism of the proposal,
the NSA said, “We believe that
conferences further international
understanding only if there is as
surance that participants will
have opportunity for constructive
exchange of views and that they
will have the chance ot derive
longterm benefits.
“This implies either a detailed
follow-up program or an attempt
to utilize the delegates later in
specified tasks. To date no as
surance can bo given that the
World Student Conference can
provide this. Further .. . the
brevity of time before the event
occurs, and the organizers’ de
sire to bring large numbers of
students from abroad cast doubts
on any group’s ability nt make in
telligent selection (of delegates).”
THE CONFERENCE has been
planned in three stages, including
arrangements for delegates to
live in homes of professional peo
ple in the Bay Area, a series of
“seminars, discussions, and tours
. . . arranged to implement the
professional topics considered.”
and a final group of addresses
and seminars “on the more gen
eral issues of community devel
opment, and on the formalizing
of student professional organiza
tions in the several areas” of
medicine, engineering, communi-
