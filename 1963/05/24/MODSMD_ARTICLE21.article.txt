# Ralston Makes First Showing Against Alumni
## 
### 
Coach John Ralston’s first var
sity football squad gets its
chance to impress local fans for
the first time tomorrow in the
annual Varsity-Alumni game.
Kickoff time in Stanford Stadi
um is 3 p.m. The four previous
games have been split, 2-2.
The Varsity-Alumni game cli
maxes the four weeks of spring
practice in which Ralston has em
phasized the fundamental tactics
of football, as he promised in his
initial press conference last win
ter. In case the players can’t put
across to the audience what Ral
ston has been stressing, the head
coach, himself, and his staff of
assistants will try their hands at
it during a special halftime clinic.
Ralston hopes to acquaint the
fans with various aspects of the
game during this clinic.
RALSTON’S squad includes
seven returning first-stringers
from 1962 and 23 lettermen,
enough to form near ly three com
plete units. However, a couple of
changes from the 1962 lineup will
place quarterbacks Steve Thur
low and Dick Ragsdale at run
ning halfback positions. These
switches leave Clark Weaver,
hero of the Big Game, the num
ber one field general.
Although the alumni team is
mostly composed of players from
the previous two years who are
still attending school, the squad
also boasts three All-Americans,
end Sam Motley (1953), tackle
Paul Wiggin (1955-56), and line
backer Ed Cummings (1962).
Other outstanding alumni who
will compete are end Ben Robin
son. tackle Eric Protiva, guards
Norm Manoogian and Russ
Steele, and halfbacks Jeri MacMil
lin and Gordy Young.
The alumni will use a pro-style
T-formation and will be coached
by Wiggin, Manoogian, and Dick
Horn,


PAUL WIGGIN, twice an All-American for Stanford, will lead
the Indian alumni squad tomorrow against the varsity in two
capacities, defensive lineman
and co-coach. Wiggin was voted
All-American in 1955 and 1956,
and since then he has played defensive end for the Cleveland
Browns.
