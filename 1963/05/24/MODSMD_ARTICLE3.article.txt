# Peace Caucus Vigilers Protest ROTC Review
## 
### 
Members of the Peace Caucus
vigiled yesterday at the ROTC
review to protest “the fact that
ROTC exists on the University
campus.” said Steve Weissbluth.
The functions of a university
are not to train for war or to
wage war,” he added.
When Bob Harrington inter
viewed him yesterday on KZSU
and asked him to comment on the
tenets of the Peace Caucus,
Weissbluth said that there is no
specific “line or credo to which
the organization is committed.
Our aim is to work toward re
solving national and community
conflicts."
It is not accurate to term the
group a pacifist movement,
Weissbluth explained, because “a
great divergence of views arc
represented.”
