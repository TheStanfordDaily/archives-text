## 
### ANN TODD 
The Stanford Student Congress
unanimously approved a resolu
tion proposed by the Civil Liber
ties Caucus of the Political Union
last night which commends those
afempting organized Negro voter
registration in the South and de
plores all who contribute to dis
crimination either through vio
lence or acquiescence.
The Congress adopted the reso
lution after hearing a speech by
Charles McLaurin, a member of
the Student Non-violent Coordi
nating Committee (SNCC), active
in Negro voter registration in
Mississippi’s Le Flore and Sun
flower counties. Stated McLaurin,
“It’s important to work in many
counties at once because the more
counties you work in, the more
pressure there is, the more vi
olence there is, the more publi
city there is.”
E L A B O BATING, McLaurin
said that Mississippi registrars
are decidedly prejudiced against
Negroes trying to register.
Through mandatory literacy tests
these registrars stop Negroes
from achieving voting status.
"Our hope,” continued McLaurin,
"is to gain action from President
Kennedy who has the power to
appoint federal registrars if it
is proved that Mississippi regis
trars are discriminating against

Negroes.”
When asked what constituted
such proof. McLaurin said it was
known that many illiterate
“whites” were alkwed to vote.
"We have the proof; now we need
to bring it to President Kennedy’s
attention. That’s why publicity is
important.”
McLaurin is touring the Bay
Area with the SNCC to promote
this publicity and also to raise
funds, and especially food and
clothing, for Negro families that
have lost their homes and jobs
because of attempts to register
as voters.
ALSO IN connection with its
work toward Negro voter regis
tration, (he SNCC has set up edu
cational classes to teach illiterate
Negroes to read and write, and to
give literate students a knowl
edge of American history and
mathematics. Harvard and Yale
students have volunteered to help
this summer, and 150 Negro and
white students from both North
and South are working.
Marty Lebowitz, Civil Liberties
Caucus head, stated, “All inter
■sted in working to educate mi
nority groups in the Los Angelos
area this summer may contact
me. Also, the Caucus will spon
sor a clothing drive before the
quarter’s end to help needy Mis
-1 issippi families.”

The Congress adopted the reso
lution after hearing a speech by
Charles McLaurin, a member of
the Student Non-violent Coordi
nating Committee (SNCC), active
in Negro voter registration in
Mississippi’s Le Flore and Sun
flower counties. Stated McLaurin,
“It’s important to work in many
counties at once because the more
counties you work in, the more
pressure there is, the more vi
olence there is, the more publi
city there is.”
E L A B O BATING, McLaurin
said that Mississippi registrars
are decidedly prejudiced against
Negroes trying to register.
Through mandatory literacy tests
these registrars stop Negroes
from achieving voting status.
"Our hope,” continued McLaurin,
"is to gain action from President
Kennedy who has the power to
appoint federal registrars if it
is proved that Mississippi regis
trars are discriminating against

Negroes.”
When asked what constituted
such proof. McLaurin said it was
known that many illiterate
“whites” were alkwed to vote.
"We have the proof; now we need
to bring it to President Kennedy’s
attention. That’s why publicity is
important.”
McLaurin is touring the Bay
Area with the SNCC to promote
this publicity and also to raise
funds, and especially food and
clothing, for Negro families that
have lost their homes and jobs
because of attempts to register
as voters.
ALSO IN connection with its
work toward Negro voter regis
tration, (he SNCC has set up edu
cational classes to teach illiterate
Negroes to read and write, and to
give literate students a knowl
edge of American history and
mathematics. Harvard and Yale
students have volunteered to help
this summer, and 150 Negro and
white students from both North
and South are working.
Marty Lebowitz, Civil Liberties
Caucus head, stated, “All inter
■sted in working to educate mi
nority groups in the Los Angelos
area this summer may contact
me. Also, the Caucus will spon
sor a clothing drive before the
quarter’s end to help needy Mis
-1 issippi families.”
