Dig your toes in the cool, wet sand
off your shoes and go joyfully down to meet
the sea. You don’t want anything, ever, to spoil
that lovely beach... neither do we.
So today, with advanced drilling techniques,
we seek oil beneath beaches without marring
their beauty with equipment and derricks.
Instead, the oil is brought up by ‘‘slant drill
ing” from a well located far away, often out in
the sea. On the beach, you don’t even know it’s
happening.
So dig your toes in the cool, wet sand. Enjoy
your lovely seaside playgrounds. We cherish
their beauty, as you do.
Planning ahead to serve you better
