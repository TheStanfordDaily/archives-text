(Editors’ Note: This is the third in a

ate education at Stanford. Quoted statements

The problems of the teaching assistant
essentially centers around the same prob
lem as that of the higher echelons of teach
ers; it is the problem of divided loyalties
between the teacher’s independent work and
his instructional responsibilities. Through
his Job the T.A. has the advantage of finan
cial aid and an apprenticeship in his chosen
field and the disadvantage of having time
subtracted from his own studies. After se
lection and supervision by his department,
tiie quality of the teaching assistant depends
on his interpretation of that divided loyalty.
With the exception of the biology depart
ment which requires one year of teaching
assistance from its graduate students, teach

ing assistantships arc on a selective basis at
Stanford.

In some departments competition for the
positions is keen enough that the department
is confident they are getting the best possi
ble students for the positions. Such is the
case In the School of Earth Sciences, accord
ing to Dean Charles Park, where T.A. selec
tion is regarded as a financial award.
IN THE departments which are more
fully supported by fellowships for graduate
students, competition is less important in
determining the quality of teaching assis
tants. Dr. Walter Meyerhof, acting executive
head of the physics department, said that
although the department selected only about
20 per cent of the applicants to teach in the
20 and 50 series, the majority of the gradu
ate students had National Science Founda
tion grants and therefore did not need the
T.A.-ships to live.
Department supervision of T.A.'s seems
to be at a minimum in the biology depart
ment where, according to Dr. George Har

mon, assistant to the executive head of the
biology department, “No concerted effort is
made to measure teaching ability.
SUPERVISION is close in both the English
and physics departments. Stone reported
that all new teachers are visited once each
quarter, reports are submitted and, if prob
lems arise, they do not continue in their
T.A. positions.
In physics, Meyerhof said, all T.A.’s are
supervised by special faculty members who
visit their sections and labs. This, he said,
was part of the University’s responsibility
to train new teachers. He added that students
must accept the fact that they will have in
experienced teachers some time in their ca
reers.
Dr. Sanford Dornbush, executive head of
the sociology department, said that there
was increasing pressure for supervision of
T.A.’s.
Dr. Philip Rhinelander, Professor of Phi
losophy and former dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, said that for the

most part T.A.’s were turned loose on their
courses without any guidance on the best
way to teach them. He also said that an en
thusiastic T.A. is sometimes more effective
than a senior teacher, and, therefore, should
be encouraged with better training, a lighter
load, and better salary. Especially in fresh
man courses where the ideal instructor is
a “teacher-scholar,” Rhinelander felt good
T.A.ships often involve the grammar courses
where criticism of course material might be
manifested in criticisms of the T.A.

Dr. Bernard Siegel, executive head of
the anthropology department, reported that
although it was difficult to formulate a fixed
method of evaluating T.A. quality, his de
partment did visit classes, hear student criti
cism. and ask T.A.’s to make reports.
Despite the fact that teaching assistants
often are inexperienced teachers, most de
partments approve of the system. Dornbush
said that there was the choice between large
classes of about 1000 students and small
classes with T.A.’s. He added, “there are not

60 distinguished English professors in the
United States,” and without T.A.’s, “who
would teach freshman English?”
Siegel viewed the function of the T.A.
as picking out major ideas and seeing how
well students are getting them. He added
that there must be some people for students
to consult.

According to Dr. William Cowley, Jacks
Professor of Higher Education, “The teach
ing assistant is a device by which you are
cheated. T.A.’s are not only teaching but
also working for their degrees. If one is
really going to be a dedicated democentric
teacher, one whose teaching is centered in
the people he teaches, he must sacrifice his
degree.” Cowley added that the basic result
of teaching assistants was that undergradu
ates are being given cheap instruction so
that undergraduate departments are making
profits, whether or not this is the function
of the T.A. program.
Tuesday’s article will deal with the role
of student criticism of teaching at Stanford.
