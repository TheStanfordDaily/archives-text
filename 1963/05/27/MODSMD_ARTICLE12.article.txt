## Long Day's Journey Exquisite' 
### FOSTER HIRSCH 
Eugene O’Neill’s “Long Day’s Journey into Night” is an
exquisite river of sorrow. It recounts with force and depth the
disintegration of four lives.
Each of the members of the Tyrone family has a serious
shortcoming which has entrapped him. James Tyrone is a once
dashing actor who is mercilessly tightfisted. He drinks too much,
bickers incessantly with his sons, and, through miserliness, is
largely responsible for his wife’s dope addiction. He has failed to
provide a home for his family, and he watches in horror as he
sees the lives about him crumble.
His wife Mary loses more and more her grip on reality as
she retreats back to her girlhood days in a convent. Her utter
loneliness, her sons’ failures, her husband’s miserliness, and her
loss of beauty constitute an unendurable reality. Only by taking
dope and enveloping herself in a world of illusion can she sur
vive.
Jamie, their elder son, is addicted to liquor and dissolute
women; he has failed to realize his potential as an actor. Ed
mund. the younger son, has a touch of the poet, but his passivity
and ill-health prevent him from refining his ability.
Through mutual alienation all four characters crawl into
their own cubicles of tormented loneliness. Each day will begin
with a resurgence of hope only to descend wound by wound to
inevitable defeat and desolation: an endless self-imposed im
prisonment and inability to transcend weakness.
As a play, O’Neill’s work may well be the supreme tragedy
of the century. As a film, it is unquestionably a distinguished
contribution to American cinema. Director Sidney Lumet and his
colleogues wisely saw fit to leave O’Neill’s play untampered, and
the film therefore is largely a photographed play. Except for the
opening scene on the porch and lawn of the Tyrone home and
one scene in the garage, the action is confined to the living room.
This approach is of course largely uncinematic; the motion
picture camera nevertheless allows some mobility of movement
and offers some telling close-ups. The camera, however, is singu
larly unobtrusive. The sparseness of the technique highlights
and at the same time allows us to concentrate solely on the act
ing, and it is on the calibre of the performances that such a
sedentary work must rise or fall. Fortunately, the result here is
a collection of admirably dedicated performances.
Ralph Richardson is Tyrone. In his more flamboyant mo
ments he is properly stentorian and theatrical. At more subdued
times, he plays with a quiet power. Mr. Richardson invests his
stunning monologues with unmistakable sincerity.
Jason Robards, Jr., who has previously been unacceptable
in films, gives an altogether satisfactory performance as Jamie.
He manages at once to suggest the empty failure and stifled
humanity of his character’s tortured spirit. In particular, he
handles his extended drunk scene with unfaltering assurance.
Dean Stockwell undoubtedly has the most demanding role
in that it is the least clearly conceived. Mr. Stockwell, although
he is intermittently mature and believable, seems out of his
depth in such a complex assignment. Surprisingly, he is not com
pletely at ease and works against rather than with his illustrous
cohorts.- However, he has some monologues during which his
awkwardness is replaced by inspiration.
Katharine Hepburn is Mary and she dominates the film.
Miss Hepburn is an enormously skilled actress; her interpreta
tion of the malicious aunt in “Suddenly, Last Summer” is a
hallmark in contemporary cinema. She manages here, however,
to outdo herself. Her virtuoso performance is like going to see a
musician who has immaculately perfected his art. Miss Hepburn’s
every gesture, her phrasing, her subtle inflections, her voice
quality, her vocal variety suggests not so much a performance
as an invaluable course in the principles of acting. On the other
hand, this is not so much acting as it is being; for, during the
course of the film, she actually becomes the pathetic dope addict
Mary Tyrone. There are moments in which she is almost unbear
ably moving as she struggles through a day of loneliness and
the stabbing remembrances of lost dreams. Her fellow actors,
conscientious as they are, simply cannot compete with her. It
is her scenes which radiate the greatness the rest of the film
strives for but does not quite capture.
Sidney Lumet’s direction is reverential; he obviously under
stands and appreciates O’Neill’s play. He is also at least partially
responsible for his actors’ contributions.

it not be forgotten that Jeanne Barr is extraordinarily
touching in her few moments as the dimwitted Irish maid; and
that Andre Previn has provided an appropriately austere and
unhappy piano background.

The film is now at the Paris Theatre and you are en
couraged to make all possible haste in seeing it.

dope and enveloping herself in a world of illusion can she sur
vive.
Jamie, their elder son, is addicted to liquor and dissolute
women; he has failed to realize his potential as an actor. Ed
mund. the younger son, has a touch of the poet, but his passivity
and ill-health prevent him from refining his ability.
Through mutual alienation all four characters crawl into
their own cubicles of tormented loneliness. Each day will begin
with a resurgence of hope only to descend wound by wound to
inevitable defeat and desolation: an endless self-imposed im
prisonment and inability to transcend weakness.
As a play, O’Neill’s work may well be the supreme tragedy
of the century. As a film, it is unquestionably a distinguished
contribution to American cinema. Director Sidney Lumet and his
colleogues wisely saw fit to leave O’Neill’s play untampered, and
the film therefore is largely a photographed play. Except for the
opening scene on the porch and lawn of the Tyrone home and
one scene in the garage, the action is confined to the living room.
This approach is of course largely uncinematic; the motion
picture camera nevertheless allows some mobility of movement
and offers some telling close-ups. The camera, however, is singu
larly unobtrusive. The sparseness of the technique highlights
and at the same time allows us to concentrate solely on the act
ing, and it is on the calibre of the performances that such a
sedentary work must rise or fall. Fortunately, the result here is
a collection of admirably dedicated performances.
Ralph Richardson is Tyrone. In his more flamboyant mo
ments he is properly stentorian and theatrical. At more subdued
times, he plays with a quiet power. Mr. Richardson invests his
stunning monologues with unmistakable sincerity.
Jason Robards, Jr., who has previously been unacceptable
in films, gives an altogether satisfactory performance as Jamie.
He manages at once to suggest the empty failure and stifled
humanity of his character’s tortured spirit. In particular, he
handles his extended drunk scene with unfaltering assurance.
Dean Stockwell undoubtedly has the most demanding role
in that it is the least clearly conceived. Mr. Stockwell, although
he is intermittently mature and believable, seems out of his
depth in such a complex assignment. Surprisingly, he is not com
pletely at ease and works against rather than with his illustrous
cohorts.- However, he has some monologues during which his
awkwardness is replaced by inspiration.
Katharine Hepburn is Mary and she dominates the film.
Miss Hepburn is an enormously skilled actress; her interpreta
tion of the malicious aunt in “Suddenly, Last Summer” is a
hallmark in contemporary cinema. She manages here, however,
to outdo herself. Her virtuoso performance is like going to see a
musician who has immaculately perfected his art. Miss Hepburn’s
every gesture, her phrasing, her subtle inflections, her voice
quality, her vocal variety suggests not so much a performance
as an invaluable course in the principles of acting. On the other
hand, this is not so much acting as it is being; for, during the
course of the film, she actually becomes the pathetic dope addict
Mary Tyrone. There are moments in which she is almost unbear
ably moving as she struggles through a day of loneliness and
the stabbing remembrances of lost dreams. Her fellow actors,
conscientious as they are, simply cannot compete with her. It
is her scenes which radiate the greatness the rest of the film
strives for but does not quite capture.
Sidney Lumet’s direction is reverential; he obviously under
stands and appreciates O’Neill’s play. He is also at least partially
responsible for his actors’ contributions.

it not be forgotten that Jeanne Barr is extraordinarily
touching in her few moments as the dimwitted Irish maid; and
that Andre Previn has provided an appropriately austere and
unhappy piano background.

The film is now at the Paris Theatre and you are en
couraged to make all possible haste in seeing it.
Eugene O’Neill’s “Long Day’s Journey into Night” is an
exquisite river of sorrow. It recounts with force and depth the
disintegration of four lives.
Each of the members of the Tyrone family has a serious
shortcoming which has entrapped him. James Tyrone is a once
dashing actor who is mercilessly tightfisted. He drinks too much,
bickers incessantly with his sons, and, through miserliness, is
largely responsible for his wife’s dope addiction. He has failed to
provide a home for his family, and he watches in horror as he
sees the lives about him crumble.
His wife Mary loses more and more her grip on reality as
she retreats back to her girlhood days in a convent. Her utter
loneliness, her sons’ failures, her husband’s miserliness, and her
loss of beauty constitute an unendurable reality. Only by taking
dope and enveloping herself in a world of illusion can she sur
vive.
