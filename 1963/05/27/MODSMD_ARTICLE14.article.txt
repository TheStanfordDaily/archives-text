Editors, The Daily:
I would like to clarify two incorrect statements which ap
peared in Friday’s article on last week’s LASSU meeting.
1) The AWS Mixed Group Overnight Policy is the “small
group overnight policy” which went into effect at the beginning
of this quarter. It enabled 3, 4, or 5 couples to attend cultural
and recreational events . . . without an adult chaperone. The
facts that a) the purpose for these overnights was conceived to
be different from that of most overnights under the jurisdiction
of ASSU and that b) consequently, the necessity of having an
adult chaperone was waived in favor of having a “student
chaperone” differentiate the AWS and ASSU policies.
2) The changes recently effected in the AWS Policy were
in no way precipitated by or related to “an incident on a camping
trip overnight.” Where this mistaken correlation came from is
beyond my comprehension; the students responsible for LASSU’s
Resolution on the Fundamental Standard apparently made no
attempt to ascertain from appropriate sources the actual rea
sons for policy changes.

The impetus for re-evaluating the AWS Policy was a num
ber of questions from women students regarding the interpre
tation of “recreational activities” under this policy (specifically;
is a week-end at the beach a suitable purpose for an AWS mixed
overnight; etc.). In order to achieve a consistent interpretation
of the policy it was necessary to call a meeting of the student
and Administrative representatives who had originally worked
out the policy. Present at this meeting were Deans Allen, Fitz
water, Avery, Larimer, and Winbigler; Professor Eric Hutch
inson. Miss Judy Starbuck, LeWayne Dorhian, and myself. The
opinions of this group were 1) that the phrase “recreational ac
tivities” was so ambiguous as to be impractical in the efficient
operation of this policy; and 2) that “recreational activities” in
conjunction with the overnight privilege were already provided
for under the ASSU Overnight Policy. Consequently, overnights
requested for “recreational” purposes (including camping trips)
were removed from the AWS Policy.
My reaction to the LASSU Resolution, its Preamble, and the
manner in which it was presented to the Legislature is that all
demonstrate an ignorance of the full implications of the Funda
mental Standard, the responsibilities of the University, and the
relationship between the Fundamental Standard, “personal free
dom,” and the Women’s Social Regulations. What was not noted
in The Daily was that there was no thorough discussion of these
issues in relation to the Resolution. The people who drew up the
Resolution, and, consequently, the Legislature as a whole, were
not adequately informed (or aware) to vote thoughtfully on this
matter.

The CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) technique of non
violence has come of age as a method of combatting racial in
justice in the United States. It can justifiably be called the CORE
technique because CORE was a pioneer of this method.
CORE has been effectively fighting bias here in California
on the Gandhi nonviolence principle, in hotels, department
stores (Montgomery Ward in Oakland, California, is now being
picketed by the Berkeley-Oakland Chapters of CORE), public
and private employment agencies and other places of public ac
commodation.
The Congress of Racial Equality is a national organization
with affiliated local chapters working to erase the color line
through direct, nonviolent action. The local groups form the base
of the CORE movement and carry on action against specific in
stances of racial discrimination in their own communities.
The Los Angeles Chapter of CORE is planning to hold a
“Freedom Summer.’’ This will involve around-the-clock "sit-in”
demonstrations at housing tracts engaging in discriminatory
practices. They will need large numbers of people for this pro
gram. Perhaps you can interest students in participating and
can induce other Civil Rights Organizations on campus, that
they. Los Angeles CORE, needs VOLUNTEERS. They will house
and feed, at no cost, any volunteers.
Our largest project now is focusing attention towards the
proposed State Fair Housing Law (Rumford Bill- -AB1240). The
bill is now in Executive Session (Senate) and is expected to be
voted out Wednesday, May 29th. We hope that it will pass this
committee with no further amendments and be sent to the Sen
ate Floor for an immediate vote. Our main method of operation
will be contacting members of the State Senate and urging them
to vote for a STRONG HOUSING BILL. I urge the students of
Stanford to join us in this project.
Students interested in CORE’S “Freedom Summer,” or in
joining a CORE chapter at Stanford in the Fall, please contact
Ed Vickery, DA 6-1887, Box 8022, Stanford.

I think it would bo a great shame if the importance of this
year were to go unmentioned. The winds of freedom are blow
ing significantly stronger in May, 1963, than they were in Sep
tember, 1962, and I should hope, for Stanford's sake, that they
will blow ever-stronger in the future. Students have begun to
join iiands with the faculty and administration on university
committees to discuss policy. After much fuss, student organi
zations have been afforded the “right” to express their views
on the important issues of the day. And still more fuss, the ad
ministration first agreed to explain, and,then to openly discuss,
its position on fallout shelters. Now that this hew fkith has been
placed in us, and a new regard shown for ouj - responsibility ip
be attentive to what is going on in the world, I hope that our ac
tions will merit this new trust, and I'm confident that they will.
The extra-legal prohibitions on liquor and the Victorian
regulation of the social lives of Stanford “men” and (especially)
“women” still sacrifice the benefit of the majority from fear of
the abuse of the few. They also make one question the depth of
the university’s faith in the students it has carefully selected
to come to Stanford, and the sincerity with which it believes
in the Fundamental Standard. Those who should be spending
more time concentrating on the growth of all students seem to
me to lose perspective, to become preoccupied with events which
might embarrass the university, even if those events are the
result of the free expression the university claims to sponsor.
But important strides forward have been made this year,
for which all concerned should be congratulated. My own grati
tude goes out to Armin Rosencranz. His devotion to the prin
ciples of a truly great university have catalyzed constructive
action. One way or another, I’m sure that all will agree: this
has been a year that will not be soon forgotten.

Last week Professor Ruotolo, Faculty Resident, Junipero
House, Wilbur Hall, had his car vandalized. Windows were
broken and seats slashed. It was the first night of pledge parties,
and crowds of drunken students were coming home from frater
nities.
Thursday night a car belonging to a guest of the Ruotolos
was vandalized. Something like a crowbar or baseball bat was
used to break windows and smash window frames.
If the honor code means anything at all—and I think it is
being severely tested in this instance—those who know anything
about these incidents or who engaged in them will come for
ward and tell what they know. Stanford exists on a basis of self
discipline and self-government. But I am less and less sure that
the student body (or large parts of it, particularly the fraternity
group) really respects or knows much about self-discipline and
self-government. As one who has had his bicycle “borrowed”
twice in two months and has witnessed a distressing number of
plagiarism cases, I think the time is ripe for a real house-clean
ing on this campus. Among other things, I think punishment
for misdemeanors ought to be increased.
Those vandals, if caught, ought to be expelled from Stan
ford, with no hope of any reprieve. Proved cases of plagiarism,
done with intent, ought to be also punished with expulsion. What
does the student body intend to do?
