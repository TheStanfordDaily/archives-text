# ALUMS RELY ON PASSING
## Varsity Grinds Out 26-13 Win 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Coach John Ralston’s debut at
Stanford was a successful one as
the Indians won the fifth annual
Varsity-Alumni football game
Saturday. 26-13.
Using an offense similar to the
1962 style of ex-coach Jack Cur
tice, Stanford stayed on the
ground about eighty per cent of
the time and methodically ground
out four touchdowns, two of
which were set up by halfback
Dick Ragsdale’s shifty punt re
turning. (Former quarterbacks
Ragsdale and Steve Thurlow
played first-unit halfback exclu

sively throughout the game.) The
scarcity of varsity passing til
were attempted* was due to the
short, 20-day duration of spring
practice, which prevented Ral
ston from installing a fully de
veloped aerial game.
IN SHARP CONTRAST, the
Alumni had little else to depend
on besides the passing style of
football instilled in them by Cur

tice, in his more passing-minded
years prior to 1962, and Chuck
Taylor. Quarterbacked by Rod
Sears and Chuck Butler, who
never threw so accurately (18/36)
in their undergraduate days, the
Alumni passed once every two
plays on the average and gained
nearly 100 per cent of their yard
age through the air.

This unbalanced offense was
as much the result of the Var
sity’s outstanding defensive line,
however, as it was the result of
the Alumni’s preference for pass
ing. The Indians’ rushing defense
allowed only four yards net, and
twice stopped potential scoring
drives deep in their territory by
throwing an Alumni ball carrier
or passer for a loss.

EVEN WHEN the Alums were
successful at passing, they had
to depend heavily on trickery, ex
ploiting the relative inexperience
of the varsity players, many of
w'hom have played only freshman
football. On one drive, end Ben
Robinson gained 32 yards on two
identical passes, on which he de
layed two counts, caught a short
loss over center, and found plen
ty of running room in the area
vacated by the varsity lineback
ers, who had pursued the deeper,
eligible receivers. The Alumni’s
second touchdown came on a 38-

yard pass from fullback Skip
Face to end Irv Nickolai; Face
had received a pitchout ostensi
bly for a run but threw instead
to a wide-open receiver.
The first varsity touchdown
came early in the second quarter
after Ragsdale had returned a
punt 38 yards to the Alumni 26.
Freshman fullback Pete Middle
kauff, who averaged 5.6 yards per

carry before having three teeth
knocked out, accounted for over
half of the necessary yardage
with two bullish runs to climax
the drive.

LATER IN the period, Rags
dale returned a punt 39 yards to
the Alumni 23. The second unit,
directed by freshman Mike Con
nelly, look over from there and
scored five plays later for 12-0.

On the first series of the sec
ond half, Clark Weaver, the num
ber one quarterback, led the team
from its own 30 to its 45, from
where he completed a 12-yard
pass. Then with the Alumni de
fense spread all over the field on
another pass play, Weaver ran
away from two rushers and
sprinted 33 yards for a TD. bare
ly making it into the end zone
after being hit on the two. A mo
ment later, he scored Stanford’s
only conversion of the day, on a
rollout keeper.
The Varsity’s most impressive
drive, 72 yards in 12 plays, came
late in the fourth quarter. The
second unit did most of the work
with Connelly scoring the TD.
ONE OF the highlights of the
afternoon was the halftime pro
gram by Ralston in which he pre
sented the fundamentals of his
ofense and defense with the first
unit demonstrating them.
