The Trojans and Stanford m
taking eight and Stanford taking*
five of the IB first places. Cal was
third with 28L points, followed
by Washington State (27), UCLA
(24’a), and Washington (23).
A TOTAL OF four meet rec- \
ords wore broken, two of thorn by ;
SC’s amazing Julio Marin. The
little 3-7 distance runner upset
Stanford’s Harry McCalla in the
mile with a 4:03 time, and then
completed an excellent double
with a 13:31.4 clocking in the
three-mile.
McCalla held the early lead in \
the mile, but Marin trotted past {
him at the start of the final lap |
and out-sprinted him in the back
stretch; McCalla finished in
4:05.8. In the longer race, Marin
paced himself to a fast 9:13 for
the first two miles. Stanford's
Weym Kirkland couldn’t keep up
and finished 18 seconds behind, j
Paul Schlicke. who hadn’t raced [
much lately because of an injured i
foot, fell all the way back to fifth j
place in 14:44.3.
STANFORD'S hopes for an up
set reached a peak midway ■
through the meet. Card Bob Miltz |
sprinted the final 200 yards of!
the half-mile to edge WSU’s Jan j
Bentzon and USC’s Kevin Hogan
in 1.30.4, the best Stanford 880
time this year. After the race it
was .announced that Hogan was
disqualified for cutting in too
soon. This decision handed the
Tribe three clutch points.
The Cards then built a 45-41
meet lead over SC when Larry
Questad and Eric Frlsche outran
one of the nation’s finest collec
tions of sprinters in the 220 for a
1-2 Stanford finish in 21.3 sec

ords wore broken, two of thorn by ;
SC’s amazing Julio Marin. The
little 3-7 distance runner upset
Stanford’s Harry McCalla in the
mile with a 4:03 time, and then
completed an excellent double
with a 13:31.4 clocking in the
three-mile.
McCalla held the early lead in \
the mile, but Marin trotted past {
him at the start of the final lap |
and out-sprinted him in the back
stretch; McCalla finished in
4:05.8. In the longer race, Marin
paced himself to a fast 9:13 for
the first two miles. Stanford's
Weym Kirkland couldn’t keep up
and finished 18 seconds behind, j
Paul Schlicke. who hadn’t raced [
much lately because of an injured i
foot, fell all the way back to fifth j
place in 14:44.3.
STANFORD'S hopes for an up

sprinted the final 200 yards of!
the half-mile to edge WSU’s Jan j
Bentzon and USC’s Kevin Hogan
in 1.30.4, the best Stanford 880
time this year. After the race it
was .announced that Hogan was

Tribe three clutch points.
The Cards then built a 45-41
