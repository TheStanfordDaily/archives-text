# Director Mitchell Talks on 'Hostage'
## 
### FOSTER HIRSCH 
“Brendan Behan’s 'Hostage' is
a shocking play, isn’t it? Don’t
you think some people might ob
ject?’’

“I’ve done nothing in the play ]
that’s immoral; only ignorant or
false people will be ‘shocked,’ ” ;
said Victor Mitchell, director of j
the up-coming Stanford Players
production of “The Hostage.”
“You don’t deny that there is !
much vulgarity in the play, do;
you?”
“It may bo vulgar, but it's not ,
a dirty play. Surely there is much
in it that doesn’t happen in Mr.
and Mrs. Smythe’s drawing room, j
but it’s funny and human, and j
therefore not smutty.”
“What is Behan trying to say? j
He doesn't really concern him- j
self with a plot, does he?”
“True, this is not a plot play; j
it is rather a skit. But there are
some very definite themes. Behan !
is saying that war kills innocent j
people. A soldier, the hostage, is
killed in a brothel for no reason,
by hands which have no connec
tion with him; it’s a useless
death. The brothel itself has noth
ing whatever to do with the war.”
“What exactly does it repre
sent?”
“THE BROTHEL is a nest
which protects those who are i
persecuted by society. Forces
from outside gradually invade j
and destroy the nest. That’s why!
the brothel becomes a battle
ground. The prostitutes and the I
homosexuals originally come in
as Individuals, but as fear and
dehumanizing institutions intrude
into the nest, they begin behav
ing in groups, and that’s why the
hostage is killed.”
“Is Behan’s personal rebellious
ness reflected in his characters?”
“Yes, in so far as they are noisy
and raucous. His people are
j straight from the music hall.
| They are lively and more or less
j realistic. They are placed in a sit
-1 nation farce, filled with jokes
I and jests.”
“Behan himself has quite a
background, doesn’t he?”
“YES, HE’S from the Dublin
| slums, but his family was not im
poverished as many have claimed.
He has spent much time.in Brit
ish jails for IRA atrocities
I against the British. He doesn’t
| really hate the British, though.
I He is simply against their institu
j tions which rob people of their
I humanity.
j “Is your company enjoying the
j play?”
“Most certainly. They are free
and not at all bound by conven
tion. We're striving for a sense
of spontaneity and immediacy, an
atmosphere of impromptu and
the unexpected. Perhaps there
will be a few’ surprises for the
audience.”
“The Hostage’ by (he Irish play
wright Brendan Behan will be di
rected at Stanford by Mitchell, a
graduate student in Speech and
Drama from Canada. Perform
ances will be Wednesday, Thurs
| day. Friday, and Saturday at 8
p.m. in the Little Theatre.
