# Rhodes Scholar to Speak Today on Communism
## 
### MICHAEL SAKS 
As the start of a five-year Ford Foundation grant to study
communism received hy Stanford, Rhodes Scholar David Heim
will speak on “A Theory of the Communist System” today at 4:15
p.m. in Tresidder, rooms 267 and 268. The public is invited.
Heim is a research assistant for the Stanford Studies of the

Communist System directed by
Professor Jan F. Triska of the
Political Science department, and
is graduating with distinction
this June.
The Stanford study is the first
of its kind anywhere to study the
communist system as a whole;
its origins and development, func
tioning and stratification, self
maintaining and conflict-solving
abilities, and its varied makeup.
According to Professor Triska,
“The particular studies concerned
with the communist system are
either historical or compartmen
talized or both. There is no co
herent social theory on either
side of the Wall.”

-
HE POINTED OUT that we
don’t even have a name for the
communist anomaly. It is not a
“Soviet Bloc” because it is neither
“Soviet” nor “Bloc.” Empire, die
, tutorship, camp, and community
do not fit cither. “The definition
. pr oblem suggests a basic lack of
. understanding of this loose asso
r ciatlon of states,” he said.
Triska noted that the twelve
stale units of the communist sys-
I tom account for 38 per cent of the
, world’s population, cover almost
. 25 per cent of the globe, and pro
. duce about one-third of the
world’s industrial output.
In addition to these twelve

state units within the communist
“core,” there are also 78 commu
nist parties and the “associate”
states of Finland, Afghanistan,
j Indonesia, Yugoslavia, and Cuba.
These constitute the non-ruling
communist parties and the states
i
j “within tlie influence” of the core.
ALTHOUGH the USSR and
| China are in absolute terms the
| most prestigious and influential
j members of the system, Triska
| explained that in relative terms
| they are not the wealthiest, most
j developed, most internationalized,
j most politically, socially, or cul
j turally integrated.
The Stanford study has as its
| goals first a conceptual theory of
the communist system to provide
j a set of tools for a systematic,
rigorous, empirical investigation.
Individual member systems will
also be compared.
The Stanford Studies of the
Communist System under Triska
is working closely with the Stan
ford Studies in International
) Conflict and Integration, directed
j by Professor Robert C. North of
j the Political Science department,
j as well as with many related Uni
' versity departments.

ALTHOUGH the USSR and

j developed, most internationalized,
j most politically, socially, or cul
j turally integrated.
The Stanford study has as its
| goals first a conceptual theory of
the communist system to provide
j a set of tools for a systematic,
rigorous, empirical investigation.
Individual member systems will
also be compared.
The Stanford Studies of the
Communist System under Triska
is working closely with the Stan

' versity departments.
As the start of a five-year Ford Foundation grant to study
communism received hy Stanford, Rhodes Scholar David Heim
will speak on “A Theory of the Communist System” today at 4:15
p.m. in Tresidder, rooms 267 and 268. The public is invited.
Heim is a research assistant for the Stanford Studies of the

Communist System directed by
Professor Jan F. Triska of the
Political Science department, and
is graduating with distinction
this June.
The Stanford study is the first
of its kind anywhere to study the
communist system as a whole;
its origins and development, func
tioning and stratification, self
maintaining and conflict-solving
abilities, and its varied makeup.
According to Professor Triska,
“The particular studies concerned
with the communist system are
either historical or compartmen
talized or both. There is no co
herent social theory on either
side of the Wall.”

HE POINTED OUT that we
don’t even have a name for the
communist anomaly. It is not a
“Soviet Bloc” because it is neither
“Soviet” nor “Bloc.” Empire, die
, tutorship, camp, and community
do not fit cither. “The definition
. pr oblem suggests a basic lack of
. understanding of this loose asso
r ciatlon of states,” he said.
Triska noted that the twelve
stale units of the communist sys-
I tom account for 38 per cent of the
, world’s population, cover almost
. 25 per cent of the globe, and pro
. duce about one-third of the
world’s industrial output.
In addition to these twelve

state units within the communist
“core,” there are also 78 commu
nist parties and the “associate”
states of Finland, Afghanistan,
j Indonesia, Yugoslavia, and Cuba.
These constitute the non-ruling
communist parties and the states
i
j “within tlie influence” of the core.
