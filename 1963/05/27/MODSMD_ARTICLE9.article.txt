# Authorities May Cancel Stanford Charter Flight
## 
### DANIEL SCHWARTZ Editor 
Aii independently arranged charter flight scheduled from
San Francisco to London on June 17 may never leave the ground,
stranding more than 100 Stanford students and faculty without
an immediate means of getting to Europe this summer.
According to a spokesman for the Investigation Bureau of the

Civil Aeronautics Board, (CAB)>
in Washington, D.C., a great num
ber of questions have been raised
concerning the legality and possi
>ility of the flight which is sched
ded on a carrier of Aerovias Sud
Americana (ASA), a company
with offices in Los Angelos.
Some questions have also been
raised about the involvement of
a local travel agency, World
Travel Center in Palo Alto, in
his flight and those involving at
'.east five other West Coast all
eges.
(This is not the regular Univer
sity-sponsored charter flight to
the Overseas Campuses for the
summer. >
THE ( AB SPOKESMAN ex
plained that a charter must be
submitted and aproved, and that
the airlines must get special au
hority to fly passenger carriers
over international waters. Neither
he charter nor the authority has
been approved, according to the
. spokesman.
To use special charter rates for
overseas flights, a group must
submit a charter in its name and
signed by a legal representative
j of that group to the airlines. Ac
cording to George L. Patterson,
of the ASA Los Angeles office,
such a charter has been submit
ted and accepted in the name of
“the faculty and students of Stan
ford.” The charter was signed by
the campus “organizer” of the
flight, Steven Wordell.
Dwight B. Adams, Business
Manager of the University, ex
plained that the charter cannot
be granted in the name of the Uni
versity or the Associated Stu
dents unless an “official officer
so declares.” He added that the
charter has not been authorized
“nor will it be authorized.”
TO OBTAIN special authority
to fly passenger carriers over
seas, ASA, regularly a cargo car
rier, must have filed for permis
sion from the CAB at least thirty
days before the flight. The proper
petition was finally filed last
week, the CAB allowing a special
late filing. According to the CAB
spokesman, the airlines “may or
may not get” the permission they
need.
If the petition to the CAB is
not accepted, ASA can attempt
to obtain permission from Pan
American Airlines to use their
“Polar Route” from San Francis
co to London regularly reserved
for the Pan American planes. The
CAB spokesman said that he
I would “doubt if ASA can get per
] mission from Pan American” to
| use the route.
| The CAB spokesman added that
i even if they get the permission,
they may not get the charter.
“Complaints have been received
about the charter,” he said.
One of these complaints con
cerns the involvement of World
Travel Center. The spokesman ex
plained that a travel agent can
act as a “go-between for the car
rier and the group,” but that he
“cannot participate in collecting
money or organizing the group.”

He also said that the agent must
not make more than a five per
cent commission for handling the
charter.
THE CAB SPOKESMAN said
that the organizers of the group
“seem to be dealing” with the
travel agency. On advertisements
which have appeared in The
Daily, two of the three phone
numbers listed are the numbers
of the World Travel Center. Al
so, according to the CAB spokes
man, World Travel seems to be
making a fifteen per cent com
mission on the flight.
Wesley Strouse, manager of
the Better Business Bureau of
Santa Clara Valley, with offices
in San Jose, said that, if the
flight does not go, “it may pose
considerable problems for the
students and faculty involved.”
“We have a file on (Jerry) Da
vis (owner of World Travel)
thicker than all the ones on other
travel agencies in the area com
bined,” he explained. Davis lost
permission to carry the tickets of
the regular airlines that are mem
bers of the International Air
Transport Association (lATA),
when one of the airlines discover
ed that he wasn’t sending on to
the customers refunds that the
airlines sent to him for distribu
tion, Strouse said.
Although both Patterson of
ASA and Davis have said that all
the money is in “trust funds” in
Los Angeles and San Jose, it
“means nothing,” according to
Strouse. A Bureau representative
checked, he said, and it only takes
one signature to get the money
out—Patterson’s or Davis’.
STROUSE FELT that they
might also be “mixing flights”—
allowing people who are not
members of the organization
chartering the flight to go on the
flight, which is against CAB regu
lations.
Strouse said that he had sent
a Stanford girl in to see Davis
and tell him that she had no con
nection with San Jose State Col
lege, but would like to be on the
San Jose Charter flight, which
Davis also seems to be organiz
ing. Ho told her that she could go
on the plane even though she was
not a member of the San Jose
student body. When asked if there
wasn’t some regulations against
that sort of thing, Davis had told
her that it was ail right, that he
was “mixing flights.”
Strouse explained that the
CAB could ground a whole plane
if just one passenger who should
not be there was found on a char
ter flight. An Air Fi’ance flight
was cancelled just last week out
of Los Angeles, he explained, for
having unaffiliated people on
board. “The whole flight of 137
people was bumped,” he said.
CAB representatives can check
the people at the gate, and stop
the plane right there, if neces
sary, he added.
