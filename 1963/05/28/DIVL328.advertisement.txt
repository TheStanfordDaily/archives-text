TILL WE MEET AGAIN
With today’s installment I complete my ninth year of writing
columns in your college newspaper for the makers of Marlboro
Cigarettes. In view of the occasion, I hope I may he forgiven
if 1 got a little misty.
These nine years have passed like nine minutes. In fact,
1 would not believe that so much time has gone by except that
I have my wife nearby as a handy reference. When I started
columning for Marlboros, she was a slip of a girl—supple as a
reed and fair as the sunrise. Today she is gnarled, lumpy, and
given to biting the postman. Still, I count myself lucky. Most
of my friends who were married at the same time have wives
who chase cars all day. I myself have never had this trouble
and I attribute my good fortune to the fact that I have never
struck my wife with my hand. I have always used a folded
r-y
m

irs d wsud
newspaper even throughout the prolonged newspaper strike
in New York. During this period I had the airmail edition of
the Manchester (luardian flown in daily from England. I must
confess, however, that if was not entirely satisfactory. The air
mail edition of the (luardian is printed on paper so light and
flimsy that it makes little or no impression when one slaps one s
wife. Mine, in fact, thought it was some kind of game, and tore
several pairs of my trousers.
I!ut 1 digress. 1 was saying what a pleasure it has been to
write this column for the last nine years for the makers of
Marlboro Cigarettes—a fine group of men, as anyone who has
sampled their wares would suspect. They are as mellow as the
aged tobaccos they blend. They are as pure as the white cellulose
filter they have devised. They are loyal, true, companionable,
and constant, and I have never for an instant wavered in my
belief that some day they will pay me for these last nine years.
but working for the makers of Marlboro has not been the
greatest of my pleasures over the hist nine years. The chief
satisfaction has been writing for you - the college population
of America. It is a rare and lucky columnist who can find an
audience so full of intelligence and verve. I would like very
much to show my appreciation by asking you all over to my
house for tea and oatmeal cookies, but there is no telling how
many of you my wife would bite.
For many of you this is the last year of college. This is espe
cially true for seniors. To those I extend my heartfelt wishes
that you w ill find the world outside a happy valley. To juniors
1 extend my heartfelt wishes that you will become seniors. To
sophomores 1 extend my heartfelt wishes that you will become
juniors. To freshmen I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will
become sophomores. To those of you going on into graduate
school I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will marry money.
To all of you let me say one thing: during the year I have
been frivolous and funny during the past year—possibly less
often than I have imagined—but the time has now come for
some serious talk. Whatever your status, whatever your plans,
1 hope that success will attend your ventures.
Stay happy. Stay loose. ewes Maxsimiman

become sophomores. To those of you going on into graduate
school I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will marry money.
To all of you let me say one thing: during the year I have
been frivolous and funny during the past year—possibly less
often than I have imagined—but the time has now come for
some serious talk. Whatever your status, whatever your plans,
1 hope that success will attend your ventures.

With today’s installment I complete my ninth year of writing
columns in your college newspaper for the makers of Marlboro
Cigarettes. In view of the occasion, I hope I may he forgiven
if 1 got a little misty.
These nine years have passed like nine minutes. In fact,
1 would not believe that so much time has gone by except that
I have my wife nearby as a handy reference. When I started
columning for Marlboros, she was a slip of a girl—supple as a
reed and fair as the sunrise. Today she is gnarled, lumpy, and
given to biting the postman. Still, I count myself lucky. Most
of my friends who were married at the same time have wives
who chase cars all day. I myself have never had this trouble
and I attribute my good fortune to the fact that I have never
struck my wife with my hand. I have always used a folded
r-y

irs d wsud
newspaper even throughout the prolonged newspaper strike
in New York. During this period I had the airmail edition of
the Manchester (luardian flown in daily from England. I must
confess, however, that if was not entirely satisfactory. The air
mail edition of the (luardian is printed on paper so light and
flimsy that it makes little or no impression when one slaps one s
wife. Mine, in fact, thought it was some kind of game, and tore
several pairs of my trousers.
I!ut 1 digress. 1 was saying what a pleasure it has been to
write this column for the last nine years for the makers of
Marlboro Cigarettes—a fine group of men, as anyone who has
sampled their wares would suspect. They are as mellow as the
aged tobaccos they blend. They are as pure as the white cellulose
filter they have devised. They are loyal, true, companionable,
and constant, and I have never for an instant wavered in my
belief that some day they will pay me for these last nine years.
but working for the makers of Marlboro has not been the
greatest of my pleasures over the hist nine years. The chief
satisfaction has been writing for you - the college population
of America. It is a rare and lucky columnist who can find an
audience so full of intelligence and verve. I would like very
much to show my appreciation by asking you all over to my
house for tea and oatmeal cookies, but there is no telling how
many of you my wife would bite.
For many of you this is the last year of college. This is espe
cially true for seniors. To those I extend my heartfelt wishes
that you w ill find the world outside a happy valley. To juniors
1 extend my heartfelt wishes that you will become seniors. To
sophomores 1 extend my heartfelt wishes that you will become
juniors. To freshmen I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will
become sophomores. To those of you going on into graduate
school I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will marry money.
