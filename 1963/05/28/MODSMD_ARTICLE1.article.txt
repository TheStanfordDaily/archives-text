# Faculty Evaluates Student Assessment of Undergraduate Education

### MARY KAY BECKER, ROBERT Wy NAYLOR JONNET STEINBAUM 
(Editors’ Note: This is the fourth of a
series of articles dealing with undergraduate
education at Stanford. Quoted statements
are personal opinions and are not necessarily
official statements of policy.)
In recent years Stanford students have
been pressing for a solution to the problem
of low quality undergraduate instruction.
The absence of reliable criteria for good
teaching is the main reason given for an
admitted overemphasis of research and pub
lication as opposed to teaching quality. As
a solution to this problem, students have
favored student evaluation and criticism of
instructors and courses.
As envisioned, accurate teacher evalua
tion would (1) take away the need for turn
ing to research as an indication of a teach
er's competence, (2) place the emphasis on
teaching quality, (3) make possible a record
of any change in the teaching competence of
a professor over a period of several years,
and (4 > make professors aware of their mis
takes, thus preventing entire careers of bad
teaching.
But is student evaluation accurate or re
liable? How much weight should it be given?
And if it is reliable, what part can it play in

improving the quality of education at Stan
ford ?
STUDENT EVALUATION is conceded
some value hy nearly everyone, usually with
qualification. But there are many doubts
about the ultimate reliability of student
criticism programs in general.
In the first place, different students have
different opinions about what constitutes a
good teacher. According to Dr. Philip H.
Rhinelander of the Philosophy Department,
“there is no such thing as the ideal teacher
for all students. EVERY faculty member is
good for one student at least. Therefore with
student criticism the sample must be large,”
FURTHERMORE, as Professor R. Nevitt
Sanford, director of the Human Problems
Study Institute, contends, the student who
loves order and organization will react nega
tively to a teacher who wanders off the main
material, even though such a teacher could
be very beneficial. In like fashion, a disor
derly student who loves to deal with ideas,
will dislike a course taught logically and in
perfect older, but in not a particularly in
spiring manner,
This theme, that students may not actu
ally be capable of accurate evaluation and
do not know what a good education they arc
getting, is supported by several professors.

It was pointed out, for example, that a
student’s opinion of his course may change
with time. A confusing course may prove
really valuable later on. Dr. Kenneth Arrow,
executive head of the Department of Eco
nomics, says that teachers can be immensely
popular and make very good impressions in
the classroom without conveying the infor
mation that is supposed to be taught. Stu
dents are really in no position to tell if they
are getting the full course.
Similarly, poorly rated teachers may bo
giving very complete presentations. Arrow
concludes: “There seems to be no real way
of knowing about teaching ability except
through informal means” such as conversa
tion with the professor, volunteered student
comments, or the opinion of the professor
teaching the follow-up course as to the pre
paredness of the students.
DR. W. H. STONE, director of the Fresh
man English Program, raises the question
of the changing teacher. “An undergraduate
naturally thinks of a professor as a finished
product, but he is in transition just as much
as the freshman. He is really aware of his
own inadequacies. He may change from a
good undergraduate teacher to a lousy one
from one year to the next and with different
classes. Undergraduates must realize that

they do not know everything and that teach
ers are undergoing changes and personal
problems just as they are.”
Ralph Smith, professor of electrical en
gineering contends that the student may not
know the full story behind a teacher’s unpre
paredness and absenteeism. This happens
frequently because the man is a leader in
his field and is called away often. “Yet we
feel we must give the students an opportuni
ty to take a course from these really emi
nent people,” he said.
Ultimately the value of criticism, every
one agrees, depends on the responsibility
and intelligence of the students. George Har
mon. assistant to the executive head of the
Biology Department, states that “comments
and criticism are usually destructive from
poorer students, rather than constructive.”
Raymond Giraud, acting head of the French-
Italian Department, adds that “the validity
and helpfulness of student criticism depends
on the intellectual stature of the students.
Most students, at least lower classmen, in
American universities have not reached a
high enough level of maturity to be proper
judges of their teachers.”
BERNARD J. SIEGEL, executive head of
the Department of Anthropology, says that
student attitude is often Important in deter

mining the quality of a course. “With too
much concentration on the dynamics of the
teachers there is too little ‘giving’ on the
part of the students." According to Dr. Rob
ert J. Wert, viceprovost, “most professors
respond to good students with everything
they have."
Student criticism can also have harmful
effects on the morale of the faculty. Dr. W.
H. Cowley, Jacks professor of higher educa
tion, points to the University of Washington
where an all-inclusive system of teacher
evaluation ruined faculty morale.
Giraud states: “Criticism open to every
one, as the “Scratch Sheet” is, some
teachers and can also affect a sensitive and
insecure professor who will begin to strive
for popularity when he knows that his future
may be dependent on the reactions of his
students. A teacher should be free of the
thought of judgment by students, which can
be based on irrelevant factors; publication,
which can be judged in a more accurate way
by his colleagues is more secure and likely
to obtain the better man.”
Tomorrow’s article will deal further with
problems of student criticism and the prop
er place of department polls and the “Scratch
Sheet” in improving undergraduate instruc
tion at Stanford.
