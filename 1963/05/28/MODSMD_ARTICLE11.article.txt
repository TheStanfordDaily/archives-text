## The 						Kentucky Coal Miners 
### GEORGE GUY 
(Editors’ note: Contributions are now being accepted for
the Kentucky coal miners at a stand on Engineering Corner.)

Since September. 1962, 25,000 coal miners have been out on
a wildcat strike in seven counties of Kentucky, Tennessee and
West Virginia (the counties involved are Harlan, Perry, Leslie,
Knott, Pike, Letcher and Floyd).
The developments which led to the present hardship of (he
miners and their families stem from a complex of events. Among
these was the undoubtedly just principle followed by John L.
Lewis of the United Mine Workers of America: mine workers
would not oppose mechanization and introduction of efficiency
measures in the production of coal if they could reasonably
expect that the benefits of higher productivity would be shared
between the mining firms and the workers. In substance the
agreements reached were a fairly high wage rate for the re
duced number of workers required and a welfare fund paid by
mining firms to support the hospitals and other benefits for the
workers. The welfare and retirement funds payments are in the
form of a royalty of 40 cents per ton of coal produced.
Most of the large mining firms are unionized, and thus
their production costs are irreducible on two items: daily wage
rate of $24.25, and the royalty payment. This cost situation, how
ever, tends to favor nonunionized firms which not only do not
have to pay union rates but also are exempt from paying the
royalty to the welfare fund. In the last few years a large num
ber of small and medium sized firms in the southern Appala
chian coal area have been operating outside of the minimum
standards set by the industry. Some operators are paying wages
of $25.00 per week.
In a declining industry such as coal, the combination of de
creased demand and non-union coal has brought about a heavy
drain on the U.M.W.’s welfare fund, forcing the union in 1961
to reduce pensions of retired miners from $lOO to $7O per month.
Subsequently, other benefits have been curtailed, including the
revocation of medical care for workers unemployed for pro
longed periods. On October 12, 1962, the U.M.W. announced it
would offer for sale four of its six Kentucky hospitals to the
local communities and implied that if there were no takers, the
hospitals would be closed.
This touched off a wave of protests. Caravans of pickets
roamed the hills, shutting down mines which either were not
unionized or had signed union contracts but failed to honor
wage and welfare provisions (80 per cent of the Kentucky op
erators paid nothing in 1962). The show of force was answered
by force when mine operators imported laborers under armed
guard and continued operations.
So far, large scale violence has been avoided. But the situa
tion is tense, unemployed workers and workers on strike are
slowly being starved out. It is unnecessary to give details of the
situation of the miners’ families: children without shoes, babies
without milk, and so on and on. 25,000 workers are involved.
That number multiplied by the average size per family indicates
the large number of people affected by this situation.
The miners vow to keep the mines shut down by force un
less operators comply with minimum wage .and welfare provi
sions. Meanwhile, until a solution is reached, large scale priva
tion prevails in the southern Appalachian region. And help obvi
ously can be put to good use. Students from these campuses
have started to send in contributions: Queens, City Harvard
Antioch, Wisconsin, California. Cornell, Brandeis. Swarthmore’
Indiana, and Michigan.
