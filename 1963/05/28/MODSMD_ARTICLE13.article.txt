Mr. Trefil’s letter on the relation of humanities and sciences
demonstrates keen insight. However, I feel that his analysis is
too narrow and oversimplified.
Mr. Trefil quotes “an informal survey ... of graduate
students in the physics department” to prove that science stu
dents have had in general a large percentage of liberal arts
courses. He glosses over the fact that physics students, of all
the sciences, tend to be the best informed on subjects outside
their own field. Thus graduate physics students at Stanford
cannot be considered typical of science students in general.
The key concepts of science are rapidly and readily dis
seminated, as are the key concepts of the humanities. Most
educated persons understand the general ideas of atoms, evolu
tion and an expanding universe. The same persons would prob
ably have an outline knowledge of the history of Western civili
zation and the main schools of metaphysics, and would prob
ably have read some literary masterpieces (in translation, if
not originally written in English, i However, advanced knowledge
in either sciences or humanities, especially in the sense of re
search, is extremely difficult to achieve for 1 the non-specialist. A
subject such as “Baudelaire’s Definition of Man” interposes
several “language" problems for the non-specialist. To approach
Baudelaire, one must read French well, must know the history of
French literatuie and France in the nineteenth century, and
must understand techniques of philosophical analysis of a liter
ary text.
In a study of freshman general education science courses I
found that the main problem in interesting students in science

erally designed for the “major,” and do not fit the interests
or the needs of the non-specialist. Mathematics is generally
very poorly taught in our high schools, adding to the problem.
Mr. Trefil states that science is perhaps the most distin
guishing feature of Western civilization. As a student of history
he should know that no judgments can be made until the last act
is played out. Science can be seen as only one symptom of a
fundamental humanistic tendency of Western society to prefer
action over contemplation, a tendency which is humanistic in

Editors, The Daily:
Congratulations to the 1963 QUAD editors for producing a
really quintessential Annual& Here indeed is The Spirit of Stan
ford captured! Observe the first thirty-six pages: note the im
mense size of the type devoted to phrases like “THE GROWTH
OF A UNIVERSITY.” “STANFORD’S GROWTH,” “THE SUC
CESS OF DEVELOPMENT,” and “DYNAMIC CAMPUS EX
PANSION.” Imagine the immense pleasure of our parents and
we (as potentially prosperous alumnae) will derive in later years
from such inspirational prose as; “Stanford’s growth has been
made possible largely through resources from private sources;”
“The success of development efforts, particularly over the last
decade, and the need of Stanford for a massive infusion of fi
nancial support, are the background of the PACE program;”
“Stanford’s physical plant must grow to keep abreast of growth
in academic programs . . My one disappointment was failing
to find a tear-out sheet addressed to Stanford reading: “Please
find enclosed $ ”
However, on page sixteen, the tribute to Stanford’s intel
lectual life begins. But I am puzzled by the juxtaposition of
the phrase “growth of ideas” and a picture of Memorial Church;
suspicious when I read that “we want to develop the mind” and
see color photos of pastoral scenes (local make-out spots) and
another of Mem Chu; surprised to see the word “THOUGHT”
and a picture of a fraternity beer-party; dismayed by the juxta
position of the words “a student’s growth” and shots of a foot
ball game, the Frosh bonfire, and Greek Week; and very nearly
nauseated to see “UNDERGRADUATE LIFE” neatly summed
up in a view of The Famous Stanford Expandingg “S.”
On the last of these introductory pages, President Sterling
says we need “INDEPENDENT MINDS.” I supposed that was
tossed in to pacify the Peace Caucus Vigilers.
When, oh when, are Wally’s white-collar money grubbers
and the PACE program’s intellectual eunuchs going to learn
that there are some areas of Stanford life and a few of its publi
cations that common decency alone should prevent them from
using for their own expedient purposes?

Editors, The Daily:
"Why isn’t the library open longer on the weekends?” This
question has been asked by some students in one particular
house in Stern Hall and in one Freshman English class. This is a
small segment of the Stanford community but it is possibly an
indication of wider spread frustration and discouragement be
cause of the library’s short weekend hours. I put the question
to the Stanford community, and especially the decision makers,
because it is a problem that I think is important to our academic
excellence and "Great University” image. If a change is unwar
ranted or impossible, at least an explanation of the hours would
help us in understanding and tolerating the situation. The ques
tion is not put belligerently or aggressively because I am aware
of possible reasons for the hours such as budget problems, as
sumed lack of demand for longer hours, and possibly other
reasons that an explanation could make known. However, as
far as I know, the actual demand for longer hours on weekends
is an open question. On the narrow basis on which I am forced
to judge, I contend there is a demand, and if feasible, the library
should be open longer. A trial period of several weekends would
indicate to the decision makers if there ifc, or*‘is hot, a demand
for longer hours. I hope this will be considered a significant
request for an explanation of library hours and a trial period to
ascertain if longer hours are warranted.

Editors, The Dally:
I would like to point out a correction to the article appear
ing in the May 22 issue of The Daily, concerning the academic
report submitted by the Class of 1964 to the University. In that
article The Daily said that: "The report went on to stress the
contradiction between the innate intellectual ability of the Stan
ford student body, as measured by the CEEB test, and actual
academic performance as measured by grades.” Nowhere in
that report did we say or imply that the Stanford student body
was innately intelligent. What we did say was that the average
intelligence of the entering Stanford freshmen, as measured by
the CEEB test, was rising; whereas the actual academic per
formance as measured by grades was remaining constant. For
this reason, as well as many other voiced in this report, we felt
that a liberalization of the Stanford grading system was neces
sary.
1 waited until now to submit this letter in order to see how
many students and faculty members submitted letters objecting
to this obviously incorrect statement. In one week there have
been no letters submitted. Why is this so? Is it because the
Stanford student feels that he is innately intelligent, or is it
just that he lacks the interest and concern necessary to see so
flagrant an error corrected? I should hope not the former, and
I wish not the latter.
Richard Hillman
President, Class of 1964

Dr, Wilfred H. Stone:
I doubt that anyone would disagree with you for condemn
ing those students who vandalized Professor Ruotolo’s car last
week. There are quite a few, however, who would—and should
take issue with you in regard to your blanket condemnation
at the same time of the entire fraternity system. Do you have
any proof that fraternity men committed these acts? The van
dalism of which you spoke, I assure you, was not an 1.F.C.-
sponsored function; as far as I know, neither was it listed on
any house’s quarterly social calendar.
If these "students” were fraternity pledges, the responsi
bility rests, in any case, with the individuals who perpetrated
the acts— not with their fraternities, in which, as a matter of
fact, they have not yet taken up residence.
Would you blame Stern Hall, for example, if some of its
members became inebriated and committed the same type of
offense—or Toyon—or Crothers? I suggest, if I may generalize,
that it is dangerous, and quite erroneous, to consider some 800
or more men under one banner—and chastize them all for the
irresponsible actions of a few idiots. It seems somewhat incon
sistent, finally, for a man of high intellectual capacity and ad
vanced educational status to manifest such evident bias.

any proof that fraternity men committed these acts? The van
dalism of which you spoke, I assure you, was not an 1.F.C.-

any house’s quarterly social calendar.
If these "students” were fraternity pledges, the responsi
bility rests, in any case, with the individuals who perpetrated
the acts— not with their fraternities, in which, as a matter of

Would you blame Stern Hall, for example, if some of its
members became inebriated and committed the same type of
offense—or Toyon—or Crothers? I suggest, if I may generalize,
that it is dangerous, and quite erroneous, to consider some 800

Mr. Trefil’s letter on the relation of humanities and sciences
demonstrates keen insight. However, I feel that his analysis is
too narrow and oversimplified.
Mr. Trefil quotes “an informal survey ... of graduate
students in the physics department” to prove that science stu
dents have had in general a large percentage of liberal arts
courses. He glosses over the fact that physics students, of all
the sciences, tend to be the best informed on subjects outside
their own field. Thus graduate physics students at Stanford
cannot be considered typical of science students in general.
The key concepts of science are rapidly and readily dis
seminated, as are the key concepts of the humanities. Most
educated persons understand the general ideas of atoms, evolu
tion and an expanding universe. The same persons would prob
ably have an outline knowledge of the history of Western civili
zation and the main schools of metaphysics, and would prob
ably have read some literary masterpieces (in translation, if

Baudelaire, one must read French well, must know the history of

Congratulations to the 1963 QUAD editors for producing a

the phrase “growth of ideas” and a picture of Memorial Church;
suspicious when I read that “we want to develop the mind” and

"Why isn’t the library open longer on the weekends?” This
question has been asked by some students in one particular
house in Stern Hall and in one Freshman English class. This is a
small segment of the Stanford community but it is possibly an
indication of wider spread frustration and discouragement be
cause of the library’s short weekend hours. I put the question
to the Stanford community, and especially the decision makers,
because it is a problem that I think is important to our academic
excellence and "Great University” image. If a change is unwar
ranted or impossible, at least an explanation of the hours would
help us in understanding and tolerating the situation. The ques
tion is not put belligerently or aggressively because I am aware
of possible reasons for the hours such as budget problems, as
sumed lack of demand for longer hours, and possibly other
reasons that an explanation could make known. However, as
far as I know, the actual demand for longer hours on weekends
is an open question. On the narrow basis on which I am forced
to judge, I contend there is a demand, and if feasible, the library
should be open longer. A trial period of several weekends would
indicate to the decision makers if there ifc, or*‘is hot, a demand
for longer hours. I hope this will be considered a significant
request for an explanation of library hours and a trial period to
ascertain if longer hours are warranted.

Editors, The Dally:
I would like to point out a correction to the article appear
ing in the May 22 issue of The Daily, concerning the academic
report submitted by the Class of 1964 to the University. In that
article The Daily said that: "The report went on to stress the
contradiction between the innate intellectual ability of the Stan
ford student body, as measured by the CEEB test, and actual
academic performance as measured by grades.” Nowhere in
that report did we say or imply that the Stanford student body
was innately intelligent. What we did say was that the average
intelligence of the entering Stanford freshmen, as measured by
the CEEB test, was rising; whereas the actual academic per
formance as measured by grades was remaining constant. For
this reason, as well as many other voiced in this report, we felt
that a liberalization of the Stanford grading system was neces
sary.
1 waited until now to submit this letter in order to see how
many students and faculty members submitted letters objecting
to this obviously incorrect statement. In one week there have
been no letters submitted. Why is this so? Is it because the
Stanford student feels that he is innately intelligent, or is it
just that he lacks the interest and concern necessary to see so
flagrant an error corrected? I should hope not the former, and
I wish not the latter.

I doubt that anyone would disagree with you for condemn
ing those students who vandalized Professor Ruotolo’s car last
week. There are quite a few, however, who would—and should
take issue with you in regard to your blanket condemnation
at the same time of the entire fraternity system. Do you have
any proof that fraternity men committed these acts? The van
dalism of which you spoke, I assure you, was not an 1.F.C.-
sponsored function; as far as I know, neither was it listed on
any house’s quarterly social calendar.
If these "students” were fraternity pledges, the responsi
bility rests, in any case, with the individuals who perpetrated
the acts— not with their fraternities, in which, as a matter of
fact, they have not yet taken up residence.
Would you blame Stern Hall, for example, if some of its
members became inebriated and committed the same type of
offense—or Toyon—or Crothers? I suggest, if I may generalize,
that it is dangerous, and quite erroneous, to consider some 800
or more men under one banner—and chastize them all for the
irresponsible actions of a few idiots. It seems somewhat incon
sistent, finally, for a man of high intellectual capacity and ad
vanced educational status to manifest such evident bias.

Mr. Trefil’s letter on the relation of humanities and sciences
demonstrates keen insight. However, I feel that his analysis is
too narrow and oversimplified.
Mr. Trefil quotes “an informal survey ... of graduate
students in the physics department” to prove that science stu
dents have had in general a large percentage of liberal arts
courses. He glosses over the fact that physics students, of all
the sciences, tend to be the best informed on subjects outside
their own field. Thus graduate physics students at Stanford
cannot be considered typical of science students in general.
The key concepts of science are rapidly and readily dis
seminated, as are the key concepts of the humanities. Most
educated persons understand the general ideas of atoms, evolu
tion and an expanding universe. The same persons would prob
ably have an outline knowledge of the history of Western civili
zation and the main schools of metaphysics, and would prob
ably have read some literary masterpieces (in translation, if
not originally written in English, i However, advanced knowledge
in either sciences or humanities, especially in the sense of re
search, is extremely difficult to achieve for 1 the non-specialist. A
subject such as “Baudelaire’s Definition of Man” interposes
several “language" problems for the non-specialist. To approach
Baudelaire, one must read French well, must know the history of
French literatuie and France in the nineteenth century, and
must understand techniques of philosophical analysis of a liter
ary text.
In a study of freshman general education science courses I

very poorly taught in our high schools, adding to the problem.
Mr. Trefil states that science is perhaps the most distin
guishing feature of Western civilization. As a student of history
he should know that no judgments can be made until the last act

"Why isn’t the library open longer on the weekends?” This
question has been asked by some students in one particular
house in Stern Hall and in one Freshman English class. This is a
small segment of the Stanford community but it is possibly an
indication of wider spread frustration and discouragement be
cause of the library’s short weekend hours. I put the question
to the Stanford community, and especially the decision makers,
because it is a problem that I think is important to our academic
excellence and "Great University” image. If a change is unwar
ranted or impossible, at least an explanation of the hours would
help us in understanding and tolerating the situation. The ques
tion is not put belligerently or aggressively because I am aware
of possible reasons for the hours such as budget problems, as
sumed lack of demand for longer hours, and possibly other
reasons that an explanation could make known. However, as
far as I know, the actual demand for longer hours on weekends
is an open question. On the narrow basis on which I am forced
to judge, I contend there is a demand, and if feasible, the library
should be open longer. A trial period of several weekends would
indicate to the decision makers if there ifc, or*‘is hot, a demand
for longer hours. I hope this will be considered a significant
request for an explanation of library hours and a trial period to
ascertain if longer hours are warranted.

is an open question. On the narrow basis on which I am forced
to judge, I contend there is a demand, and if feasible, the library
should be open longer. A trial period of several weekends would
indicate to the decision makers if there ifc, or*‘is hot, a demand
for longer hours. I hope this will be considered a significant

Editors, The Dally:
I would like to point out a correction to the article appear
ing in the May 22 issue of The Daily, concerning the academic
report submitted by the Class of 1964 to the University. In that
article The Daily said that: "The report went on to stress the
contradiction between the innate intellectual ability of the Stan
ford student body, as measured by the CEEB test, and actual
academic performance as measured by grades.” Nowhere in
that report did we say or imply that the Stanford student body
was innately intelligent. What we did say was that the average
intelligence of the entering Stanford freshmen, as measured by
the CEEB test, was rising; whereas the actual academic per
formance as measured by grades was remaining constant. For
this reason, as well as many other voiced in this report, we felt
that a liberalization of the Stanford grading system was neces
sary.
1 waited until now to submit this letter in order to see how
many students and faculty members submitted letters objecting
to this obviously incorrect statement. In one week there have
been no letters submitted. Why is this so? Is it because the
Stanford student feels that he is innately intelligent, or is it
just that he lacks the interest and concern necessary to see so
flagrant an error corrected? I should hope not the former, and
I wish not the latter.

I doubt that anyone would disagree with you for condemn
ing those students who vandalized Professor Ruotolo’s car last
week. There are quite a few, however, who would—and should
take issue with you in regard to your blanket condemnation
at the same time of the entire fraternity system. Do you have
any proof that fraternity men committed these acts? The van
dalism of which you spoke, I assure you, was not an 1.F.C.-
sponsored function; as far as I know, neither was it listed on
any house’s quarterly social calendar.
If these "students” were fraternity pledges, the responsi
bility rests, in any case, with the individuals who perpetrated
the acts— not with their fraternities, in which, as a matter of
fact, they have not yet taken up residence.
Would you blame Stern Hall, for example, if some of its
members became inebriated and committed the same type of
offense—or Toyon—or Crothers? I suggest, if I may generalize,
that it is dangerous, and quite erroneous, to consider some 800
or more men under one banner—and chastize them all for the
irresponsible actions of a few idiots. It seems somewhat incon
sistent, finally, for a man of high intellectual capacity and ad
vanced educational status to manifest such evident bias.

Mr. Trefil’s letter on the relation of humanities and sciences
demonstrates keen insight. However, I feel that his analysis is
too narrow and oversimplified.
Mr. Trefil quotes “an informal survey ... of graduate
students in the physics department” to prove that science stu
dents have had in general a large percentage of liberal arts
courses. He glosses over the fact that physics students, of all
the sciences, tend to be the best informed on subjects outside
their own field. Thus graduate physics students at Stanford
cannot be considered typical of science students in general.
The key concepts of science are rapidly and readily dis
seminated, as are the key concepts of the humanities. Most
educated persons understand the general ideas of atoms, evolu
tion and an expanding universe. The same persons would prob
ably have an outline knowledge of the history of Western civili
zation and the main schools of metaphysics, and would prob
ably have read some literary masterpieces (in translation, if
not originally written in English, i However, advanced knowledge
in either sciences or humanities, especially in the sense of re
search, is extremely difficult to achieve for 1 the non-specialist. A
subject such as “Baudelaire’s Definition of Man” interposes
several “language" problems for the non-specialist. To approach
Baudelaire, one must read French well, must know the history of
French literatuie and France in the nineteenth century, and
must understand techniques of philosophical analysis of a liter
ary text.
In a study of freshman general education science courses I
found that the main problem in interesting students in science
in the unwillingness of top faculty members to loach these low
level. non-specialist courses. Freshman science courses are gen
erally designed for the “major,” and do not fit the interests
or the needs of the non-specialist. Mathematics is generally
very poorly taught in our high schools, adding to the problem.
Mr. Trefil states that science is perhaps the most distin
guishing feature of Western civilization. As a student of history
he should know that no judgments can be made until the last act
is played out. Science can be seen as only one symptom of a
fundamental humanistic tendency of Western society to prefer
action over contemplation, a tendency which is humanistic in
origin, and which can be understood only in the light of human
istic research.

Congratulations to the 1963 QUAD editors for producing a
really quintessential Annual& Here indeed is The Spirit of Stan
ford captured! Observe the first thirty-six pages: note the im
mense size of the type devoted to phrases like “THE GROWTH
OF A UNIVERSITY.” “STANFORD’S GROWTH,” “THE SUC
CESS OF DEVELOPMENT,” and “DYNAMIC CAMPUS EX
PANSION.” Imagine the immense pleasure of our parents and
we (as potentially prosperous alumnae) will derive in later years
from such inspirational prose as; “Stanford’s growth has been
made possible largely through resources from private sources;”
“The success of development efforts, particularly over the last
decade, and the need of Stanford for a massive infusion of fi
nancial support, are the background of the PACE program;”
“Stanford’s physical plant must grow to keep abreast of growth
in academic programs . . My one disappointment was failing
to find a tear-out sheet addressed to Stanford reading: “Please
find enclosed $ ”
However, on page sixteen, the tribute to Stanford’s intel
lectual life begins. But I am puzzled by the juxtaposition of
the phrase “growth of ideas” and a picture of Memorial Church;
suspicious when I read that “we want to develop the mind” and
see color photos of pastoral scenes (local make-out spots) and
another of Mem Chu; surprised to see the word “THOUGHT”
and a picture of a fraternity beer-party; dismayed by the juxta
position of the words “a student’s growth” and shots of a foot
ball game, the Frosh bonfire, and Greek Week; and very nearly
nauseated to see “UNDERGRADUATE LIFE” neatly summed
up in a view of The Famous Stanford Expandingg “S.”
On the last of these introductory pages, President Sterling
says we need “INDEPENDENT MINDS.” I supposed that was
tossed in to pacify the Peace Caucus Vigilers.
When, oh when, are Wally’s white-collar money grubbers
and the PACE program’s intellectual eunuchs going to learn
that there are some areas of Stanford life and a few of its publi
cations that common decency alone should prevent them from
using for their own expedient purposes?

"Why isn’t the library open longer on the weekends?” This
question has been asked by some students in one particular
house in Stern Hall and in one Freshman English class. This is a
small segment of the Stanford community but it is possibly an
indication of wider spread frustration and discouragement be
cause of the library’s short weekend hours. I put the question
to the Stanford community, and especially the decision makers,
because it is a problem that I think is important to our academic
excellence and "Great University” image. If a change is unwar
ranted or impossible, at least an explanation of the hours would
help us in understanding and tolerating the situation. The ques
tion is not put belligerently or aggressively because I am aware
of possible reasons for the hours such as budget problems, as
sumed lack of demand for longer hours, and possibly other
reasons that an explanation could make known. However, as
far as I know, the actual demand for longer hours on weekends
is an open question. On the narrow basis on which I am forced
to judge, I contend there is a demand, and if feasible, the library
should be open longer. A trial period of several weekends would
