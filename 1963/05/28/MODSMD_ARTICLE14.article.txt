# 'Governor Stanford Embarks on Pilgrimage
## 
### 
The Central Pacific Engine No.
1, or “Governor Stanford” will
today begin its trip on a carefully
planned route to the Richmond-
Sante Fe railroad yards. In spite
of the shower of adamant and
sentimental opposition to the
transfer, “Governor Stanford” will
be moved to the cribbing this

morning as the first step in its
journey.
Tomorrow morning, the engine
w'ill be moved to the flat trailer
on which it will travel a circuitous
but well-defined route to Oakland.
The trip will start about 12:30
p.m.
The “Governor Stanford” will

leave its lasting place in the mu
seum via the hole in the back
wall, Dotnita Drive, Museum Way
and Campus Drive.
After Wednesday’s trip via
Mountain View, the engine will
rest overnight at San Leandro.
At 9 a.m. on Thursday, the last
leg of the trip will commence. The i
“Governor” will leave San Lean
dro on Highway 17 and proceed
to Oakland.
The engine will reside at the
Richmond-Sante Fe yards until
the San Francisco Maritime Mu
seum Association opens its new
Railroad Museum.
“Governor Stanford” has en
joyed a 47-year retirement in the
Stanford Museum.
