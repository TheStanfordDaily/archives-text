# Hostels Supplement Orientation Of Overseas Campus Students
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
“The social gatherings were flat
ish you know, eternal cups of
red punch and cookies, those stale
cookies.” Thus Dr. Irene Blumen
thal, Assistant Director of the
Overseas Campuses, described one
of the problems which prompted
the establishment this year of a
series of hostels to supplement
the Overseas Campuses orienta
tion program.
The hostel program, as it now
functions, comprises one all-day
session for each departing group
held at the Oakland YMCA Camp
near Pescadero. The hostels,
planned by the Overseas Cam
puses Board in cooperation with
the Overseas Campuses Office, in
clude informal recreational activi
ties coordinated with lectures by
Stanford professors and small
group discussions with overseas
campus alumni.
FOK A LONG TIME the Over
seas Campuses Office had recog
nized a certain lack in its orienta
tion program. The regular Mon
day night meetings scheduled for
each new group, although thor
oughly necessary from an admini
strative point of view, placed
great demands on students’ time;
and, Dr. Blumenthal found, ef
forts to present speakers or addi
tional cultural information were
greeted with “increased fidget
ing,”
The hostel program supplied
the need for orientation in depth.
Dr. Blumenthal feels that the hos
tels have allowed a great deal of
substantive material to be con
centrated in one session; hence,
fewer weekly meetings are needed
and greater student interest is
stimulated. In addition, the in
formal atmosphere of the hostels
has permitted more extensive
inter-group contact.
GONK IS the uneasiness of the
“cookie and red punch parties."
Students emphasized that they
felt much more at home with then
group after their hostel. One stu

dent commented, “It was com
pletely relaxing. Everyone was
willing to talk.” Another noted,
"Everyone was friendly . . . just
something like singing French
songs brought the group m u c h
closer together.”
The consensus revealed in the
evaluation forms submitted after
each hostel was expressed by one
student who commented, “Hostels
are a great idea!” Students went
on to stress that they felt the
hostels provided valuable, an d
previously lacking, contact with
the returnees. One member of
Stanford-in-France Group VII
noted, “They told us what we
wanted to know about clothes,
about places to go, everything.”
“TIIKKK WAS NOT one adverse
comment on the Germany group’s
evaluations,” recalled Sherri Da
vis, a member of the Overseas
Campuses Board. "This is heart
warming, as is all praise," she
continued, “but we're aware there
are a lot of improvements that
can be made.”
Hostels are one of the chief con
cerns of the nine-member Over
seas Campuses Board which was
formed Fall Quarter of (his year
to coordinate an intensified orien
tation program. Two members of
the board, Dorothy Brown and
Sue Bettelheim, drew up the blue
print for the first organized hos
tel, but the idea of the hostel as
a part of orientation goes back to
the fall of 1961 when the depart
ing Germany group set up an im
promptu hostel on their own initi
ative. The hostel program itself
was not instituted until Winter
Quarter of this year. It was estab
lished partially as a result of the
efforts of the Overseas Campuses
Board and a series of recommen
dations contained in a report sub
milled by Stanford-in-France
Group IV.
THE FIKST Stanford-in-Ger
many hostel, held (his April, re
tained much of the initial spon
taneity. The hostel was not com
pulsory, yet 58 of the 66 group
members attended.
Encouraged by this success, the
Board planned and presented hos
tels for both Stanford-in-France
VII and Stanford-in-Italy VII. A
general format was developed
and will be followed, with minor
changes, in the planning of next
year's hostels.
The hostels begin at 8 a.m. with
buses providing transportation to
the hostel sight. The morning’s
activities include a short talk by
Dr. Robert Walker, Director of
the Overseas Campuses, an in
formal coffee hour, and a speech
by a professor who has partici
pated in the program or who has
some connection with the culture
of the country involved.
AFTER LUNCH, the schedule
calls for another speech by a
Stanford professor on some facet
of life in the country, followed
by a social hour, general informa
tion seminars with student re
turnees, dinner, and an informal
program of entertainment usually
involving group singing.
Dr. Blumenthal commented.
“The hostel gives the students a
chance to know each other, to dis
cuss their problems, and this
leads to much better social inter
action once they arrive overseas.
. . . The hostels provide a program
in which the students can really
immerse themselves.”
