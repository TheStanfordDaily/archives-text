# Stanford's Upset Win Over MSU Rated Top Sports Thrill By Staff
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Mighty Michigan State, ranked
in the top five in the nation in all
pre-season polls, invaded Palo
Alto for their first game of the
season (his year, figuring to push
by the Indians before encounter
ing rougher competition. They
left wishing they had never seen
Stanford Stadium. Behind inspir -
ed defense and the passing of
Steve Thurlow, the Tribe upset
the Spartans 16-13. This must
rank as the top sports thrill of
the year’ at Stanford.
Michigan State was the heavy
favorite going into the game. The
Spartans boasted a line which re
sembled seven suited refugees
from a bullfight, averaging 232
pounds per man from tackle to
tackle. They had beaten Stanford
31-3 the year before, rolling to
three touchdowns and a field goal
in the fourth quarter. They had
two returning All-Americans in
fullback and captain George
Saimes and center Dave Behr
man. Now departed Stanford
coach Jack Curtice could counter
only with a team which had bare
ly edged Tidane the week before.
His only pre-game plan was to
“Fight like hell.” They did.

Cummings, who assisted in or
made an amazing 26 tackles in
the game, Stanford’s defense
turned in a tremendous effort.

Safety men Tim Hansel, Gary
Craig, and Gary Sargent bottled
up the Spartan passing attack
while Cummings was bringing
Michigan State ball carriers to
earth.
On offense, Thurlow’s passing
was instrumental in the upset.
Trailing 7-0 in the second quarter,
Thurlow uncorked a 37-yard pass
to Bob Howard to the MSU one
yard line to set up Stanford’s
first score.
In the second quarter Thur
low’s 42-yard screen pass to J. D.
Lodato set up Stan Lindskog’s
24-yard field goal. Then in the
final quarter a toss to Frank Pat
itucci and two bullets to Howard
put the Tribe in position for a 33-
yard game-clinching run by John
Paye.
MICHIGAN STATE made a des
peration drive, scoring on a fluke
pass play after the quarterback

had fumbled, but Stanford made
Ihe 1613 final score stand up.
Stanford athletes offered other
great thrills to those sturdy
enough to view them (in some
cases very few people did). The
Tribe basketball team scored
wins over Oregon State and
UCLA in the Pavilion, to the de
light of 3,000 faithful frenzied
fans.
The baseball team came
through with a doubleheader
sweep over the Bruins, behind
their great pitching combination
of Darrell Sutherland and Jim
Lonborg. In track, Stanford came
within a whisper of defeating
top-ranked USC, falling 73-72 be
fore a sparse crowd discouraged
by the weather but encouraged
by Stanford’s great effort.
And, of course, the Big Game
must be included in this list of
sports thrills. The Indians won it
for the second straight year,
swamping the poor Bears by a
30-13 advantage.

light of 3,000 faithful frenzied
fans.
The baseball team came
through with a doubleheader
sweep over the Bruins, behind
their great pitching combination
of Darrell Sutherland and Jim
Lonborg. In track, Stanford came
within a whisper of defeating
top-ranked USC, falling 73-72 be
fore a sparse crowd discouraged
by the weather but encouraged
by Stanford’s great effort.
And, of course, the Big Game
must be included in this list of
sports thrills. The Indians won it
for the second straight year,
swamping the poor Bears by a
30-13 advantage.


STANFORD QUARTERBACK Steve Thurlow's passing was a major
factor in the Tribe's upset over Michigan State, the sports thrill of
the year.
Mighty Michigan State, ranked
in the top five in the nation in all
pre-season polls, invaded Palo
Alto for their first game of the
season (his year, figuring to push
by the Indians before encounter
ing rougher competition. They
left wishing they had never seen
Stanford Stadium. Behind inspir -
ed defense and the passing of
Steve Thurlow, the Tribe upset
the Spartans 16-13. This must
rank as the top sports thrill of
the year’ at Stanford.
Michigan State was the heavy
favorite going into the game. The
Spartans boasted a line which re
sembled seven suited refugees
from a bullfight, averaging 232
pounds per man from tackle to
tackle. They had beaten Stanford
31-3 the year before, rolling to
three touchdowns and a field goal
in the fourth quarter. They had
two returning All-Americans in
fullback and captain George
Saimes and center Dave Behr
man. Now departed Stanford
coach Jack Curtice could counter
only with a team which had bare
ly edged Tidane the week before.
His only pre-game plan was to
“Fight like hell.” They did.
LED BY LINEBACKER Ed
Cummings, who assisted in or
made an amazing 26 tackles in
the game, Stanford’s defense
turned in a tremendous effort.

Safety men Tim Hansel, Gary
Craig, and Gary Sargent bottled
up the Spartan passing attack
while Cummings was bringing
Michigan State ball carriers to
earth.
On offense, Thurlow’s passing
was instrumental in the upset.
Trailing 7-0 in the second quarter,
Thurlow uncorked a 37-yard pass
to Bob Howard to the MSU one
yard line to set up Stanford’s
first score.
In the second quarter Thur
low’s 42-yard screen pass to J. D.
Lodato set up Stan Lindskog’s
24-yard field goal. Then in the
final quarter a toss to Frank Pat
itucci and two bullets to Howard
put the Tribe in position for a 33-
yard game-clinching run by John
Paye.
MICHIGAN STATE made a des
peration drive, scoring on a fluke
pass play after the quarterback

had fumbled, but Stanford made
Ihe 1613 final score stand up.
Stanford athletes offered other
great thrills to those sturdy
enough to view them (in some
cases very few people did). The
Tribe basketball team scored
wins over Oregon State and
UCLA in the Pavilion, to the de
light of 3,000 faithful frenzied
fans.
