# Format of RA Reports Altered To Allow Flexibility and Brevity
## 
### PATRICIA LONG 
(editors' nolo: This is the first j
of a two-part solios.)
The format of both the men’s
and women's resident assistant
(RAI and freshman sponsor re
ports has been undergoing change
this year. These reports, made on
all students living in university
residences, were described by
Dean of Women Lucile Allen as a
way “to give the next person
working with the student an idea
of him.”
Before this year, men's faculty
residents or RA's could choose
between eight different forms for
their yearly reports. Now these
have been synthesized into one
form, which asks for brief com
ments on the student’s academic
competence, emotional maturity,
relationships with other people,
non-academic competence, and
for an over all evaluation. Wilbur
faculty residents fill out fresh
man forms in consultation with
the sponsors.
THE FORM ITSELF is unim
portant, commented Acting Dean
of Men David S. Larimer. Some
prefer just to write a narrative;
one RA asks the individuals to
write a brief self-analysis and
then comments on it. This auto
ziographical approach seems sat
isfactory, said Dwight Clark,
Dean of Freshman Men. If the
RA doesn’t know the individual,
he does not have to fill out a
form, ho added.
Unlike the men, the women’s
freshmen reports differ from the
upperclass ones. A new form for
freshmen sponsors has just been
completed, and will be used be
ginning next year. Essay ques

j tions cover the interests of the
I girl, her participation in activities
! and relationships with others, and
I any other areas (academic, finan
cial, etc.) particularly significant
in the individual’s case, said As
sistant Dean of Women Elizabeth |
| Avery. What to Include is “pretty i
i much open to the sponsor,” she
said.
1 The old freshman report con- \
j tained more specific essay ques- j
tions, including ones on appear- j
| ance, religion, and goals, as well
j as the above general areas.
THE REVISION of the upper
class women’s RA reports, w’hich
are presently not essay, will not
be completed until next year. The
old form contained a check list of
22 adjectives, including “friendly,
aloof, self-reliant.” Following this
list were five sections- academic, |
jgoals, group relations, emotions, j
j and appearance—each with one i
j of four boxes to be marked; these
i boxes ranged, in the case of
j group relations, from “does not
j participate” to “widely liked and
admired.” "Sometimes a person
just doesn't fit into one box,”
criticized an RA.
Criticism have been gathered
' from RA’s and dorm directors
| and a rough draft of the new:
j form has been made. “We’re try- j
j ing to give guidelines, but not:
(structure to the extent that it is'
1 ioo confining.” said Doan Avery.

1 The old freshman report con- \
j tained more specific essay ques- j
tions, including ones on appear- j
| ance, religion, and goals, as well
j as the above general areas.
THE REVISION of the upper
class women’s RA reports, w’hich
are presently not essay, will not
be completed until next year. The
old form contained a check list of
22 adjectives, including “friendly,
aloof, self-reliant.” Following this
list were five sections- academic, |
jgoals, group relations, emotions, j
j and appearance—each with one i
j of four boxes to be marked; these
i boxes ranged, in the case of
j group relations, from “does not
j participate” to “widely liked and
admired.” "Sometimes a person
just doesn't fit into one box,”
criticized an RA.
Criticism have been gathered
' from RA’s and dorm directors
| and a rough draft of the new:
j form has been made. “We’re try- j
j ing to give guidelines, but not:
(structure to the extent that it is'
1 ioo confining.” said Doan Avery.
(editors' nolo: This is the first j
of a two-part solios.)
The format of both the men’s
and women's resident assistant
(RAI and freshman sponsor re
ports has been undergoing change
this year. These reports, made on
all students living in university
residences, were described by
Dean of Women Lucile Allen as a
way “to give the next person
working with the student an idea
of him.”
Before this year, men's faculty
residents or RA's could choose
between eight different forms for
their yearly reports. Now these
have been synthesized into one
form, which asks for brief com
ments on the student’s academic
competence, emotional maturity,
relationships with other people,
non-academic competence, and
for an over all evaluation. Wilbur
faculty residents fill out fresh
man forms in consultation with
the sponsors.
THE FORM ITSELF is unim
portant, commented Acting Dean
of Men David S. Larimer. Some
prefer just to write a narrative;
one RA asks the individuals to
write a brief self-analysis and
then comments on it. This auto
ziographical approach seems sat
isfactory, said Dwight Clark,
Dean of Freshman Men. If the
RA doesn’t know the individual,
he does not have to fill out a
form, ho added.
Unlike the men, the women’s
freshmen reports differ from the
upperclass ones. A new form for
freshmen sponsors has just been
completed, and will be used be
ginning next year. Essay ques

j tions cover the interests of the
I girl, her participation in activities
! and relationships with others, and
I any other areas (academic, finan
cial, etc.) particularly significant
in the individual’s case, said As
sistant Dean of Women Elizabeth |
