# Cricketers Wallop Golden Gate By Nine
## 
### DHANJOO GHISTA 
The sun-loving Stanford crick
eters were trapped at the Golden
Gate Park on a windy and cheer
less afternoon and fielding slug
gishly allowed the hometeam to
score IfO runs off them. Then
they roared back into action com
pletely shattering the aspirations
of the hometeam to win by a con
vincing nine wicket margin and a
111-110 score.
It was a pitch made to order
for the pace bowlers. Andrew
Ma’s outswinger darted from the
leg like an adder and Tryfan
Rogers scooped up the ball in the
skips. At the other end Sandy Bir
twistle got the ball up steeply
from a perfect length and flat
tened the stumps twice in an
over. The batsmen striking the
wrong notes much too often were
responsible for San Francisco be
ing 36 for six wickets.
BUT THEN AN AIR of hypno
sis settled like a cloud over the
Indians. The San Francisco tail
enders started playing some fan
ciful shots and when to their de
light they seemed to get away
with it they thrived on this. At
4 p.m. the Stanfordites heaved a
sigh of relief as they went in for

tea after dismissing their oppo
nents for an alarming 110. An
drew Ma, Sandy Birtwistle, and
John Jackson shared the bowling
honors with five, three, and two
wickets respectively.
From then onwards it was San
Francisco’s turn to go leather
hunting. Opening the batting with
Clifford Severn, Tryfan Rogers
bravely weathered the storm to put
on 38 for the first wicket. It was
hereabouts that the Stanfordites
began their bid for victory. Sev
ern now hit the ball a fearsome
crack. Elmo Perara, more effort
less and gently persuasive, found
gaps in the covers. The San Fran
cisco bowlers pegged away but
Severn and Perara, now mon
archs of all they surveyed, but,
drove, and flicked Stanford home
to a brilliant victory, remaining
unbeaten with 55 and 31 to their
credit.
AS A RESULT of this win Stan
ford and Marin lead the league
with four and zero records, fol
lowed by San Mateo with one and
one, San Francisco and Del Mon
te, one and two, and Golden Gate
and Fairchild at zero and three.
Stanford plays Marin on June 16
after finals, a match worth going
a long way to watch.
