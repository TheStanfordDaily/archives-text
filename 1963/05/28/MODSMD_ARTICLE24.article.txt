# Jordan Named Stanford's Top Coach of the Year
## 
### PETE KING 
Stanford is fortunate to have
in its employ some of the finest
coaches around to guide its
teams. Nowhere is this more true
than in track, and this year The
Daily sportswriters have voted
Stanford track coach Payton Jor
dan as Coach of the Year.

Ip his seven-year reign over
Farm track, Jordan has been re
sponsible for building one of the
most outstanding track eras of
any college in the country, and
this year his team ranks with the
three best in Stanford’s history.
HIS TRACKMEN compiled a
7-3 dual meet record, with their
only losses coming by seven,
three, and one point, respectively.
In addition they won the Stan
ford and tile Drake Relays, while
nearly beating USC in the Fresno
Relays.
All in all, three school varsity
records were set (in the discus,
steeplechase, and four-mile relay)
and three freshman records (dis
cus, javelin, and pole vault). Of
the five varsity records set last
year, three came in the final
meets, and the men who set them
are still here, so still more entries
may be erased in the record book.
In the short space he has been
at Stanford, Jordan’s athletes
have set 18 varsity and 10 fresh
man records, not counting those
which have been rebroken many
times.
HE HAS attained nation- and
even world-wide renown as a
track and field coach. Last sum
mer the Russia-U.S. track meet
was held at Stanford and the
Russians had nothing hut praise
for the way Jordan ran the meet
and for the warm-hearted, enthu

siastio manner in which Jordan,
the officials, and the spectators
treated them.
As recognition for this, Jordan
was appointed this year to be
head coach for this summer’s
U.S.-Russian track meet in Rus
sia.
A large part of Jordan's suc
cess is his emphasis on building
team spirit and enthusiasm,

which he believes is the differ
ence between a good and a great
track team. He tries to make his
runners, jumpers, and weighlmen
bridge the mental and emotional
gap between their own event and
the team’s overall performance.
Thus a track meet becomes not
30 or 40 athletes competing indi
vidually in 17 events, but a uni
fied team with a collective spirit.
This team attitude, says Jordan,
can inspire individuals to greater

efforts in their own events.
AN EXAMPLE of this came
early in the year in the Stanford
Relays. The Tribe needed a first
in the mile relay to beat San Jose
State. Jordan gathered all his
trackmen in the middle of the
field and, after a rousing pep talk,
sent them to various points along
the track to spur the Indian run
ners on. Stanford won the race
(and the meet) in 3:12. the team’s
fastest time of the year.
The Daily’s selection of Jordan
was not easy, however, since
there were other outstanding
coach-of-the-year candidates. Ho
wie Dallmar’s basket bailers won
the AAVVU title for the first
time in 21 years, in the process
being ranked fourth nationally
and clobbering the western divi
sion NCAA champ, Oregon State,
by a 96-69 score.
ANOTHER successful coach
was Pete Kmetovic. His rugby
team compiled a 13-1 record, win
ning its last 10 in a row. This was
the best record on the coast.
Baseball coach Dutch Fehring
saw his squad compile a 24-11 rec
ord, the best since his first year,
19.36.
Rut Jordan led his trackmen to
a season nearly as successful as
those enjoyed by the 1928 and
1940 teams, which won the NCAA
title and set four world records.
Although no world records were
set this year, discus thrower Dave
Weill raised his collegiate record
to 193-2 and the team was the
only one to stand up to mighty
USC. Jordan is optimistic about
the NCAA meet, to be held June
13-15 at Albuquerque, New Mexi
co. Should Stanford win that
meet, the team would have to go
down as Stanford’s greatest ever.
