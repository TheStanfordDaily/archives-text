# NCAA Sets Track Qualifying Times
## 
### 
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (UPIi
Relaxed qualifying standards
and expansion to a three-night
program promises to make the
42nd annual NCAA track and
field championships June 13-15
one of the best in recent years.
The more liberal qualification
rules will provide for a larger
field and permit entry of some
slow-developing or injury-ham
pered athlets who normally
might have had to forego the
meet because of sub normal sea
son marks.
AND, BY stretching the com
petition from two to three nights
at the host University of New
Mexico’s Stadium, the NCAA

hoped to ease the physical strain
of forcing athletes to compete in
both trial and semi-finals in the
same night.
George McFadden, athletic in
formation director at the host
school, said more than 100 NCAA
member' schools have requested
800 official entry blanks to re
turn before the May 31 deadline.
Entrants must have run,
jumped or thrown well enough
during the season to meet various
standards set by the NCAA
games committee. The only event
open to all comers is the six-mile
run, but that race requires a doc
tor’s certificate of physical fit
ness.
MeFADDEN, who has been
keeping up with the top perform
ers in college track this season,
said that more than 300 athletes
already have qualified to meet the
NCAA standards.

He received the first entry
blank last week from the Univer
sity of Houston, which has a fine
five-man team composed of
sprinter Boyd Timmons and dis
tance men Laurie Elliott, Allen

Irwin, Geoff Walker and A1 Law
rence.
Several Stanford trackmen
have times better than the NCAA
standard, including distance-man
Harry McCalla who could qualify
for the 880, mile, three mile, and
steeplechase.
OTHERS WHO have qualified
in more than one event include
Larry Questad in both sprints,
Paul Schlike in the mile and two
mile, and Steve Cortright in both
hurdles and the triple jump.
The qualifying times in each
event and Stanford athletes who
have matched these times:
too yard dash, tt.fi, (Qnestd), 220 yard
dash (curve), 21.6 (Questad); 440 yard
dash, 47.6; 680 yard run, 1:52 (Milt/, Mc-
Calla, Pratt).
Mile, 4:12 (Andrews, Schlieke, McCalla,
Ruble); Three-mile, 14:20, and two-mile,
0:15 (Kirkland, MeCalla, Schlieke); Steeple
chase. 9:26 (McCalla).
120 yard high hurdles, 14.4 (Cortright);
440 sard intermediate hurdles, 53.2 (Cort
right').
Pole vault, 14-6 (White); High jump
-6-6; Broad jump, 24 (Moore); Triple jump.
47-0 (Cortright, Downey),
Shot put, 56-0 (Arch); Discus, 165

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (UPIi
Relaxed qualifying standards
and expansion to a three-night
program promises to make the
42nd annual NCAA track and
field championships June 13-15
one of the best in recent years.
The more liberal qualification
rules will provide for a larger
field and permit entry of some
slow-developing or injury-ham
pered athlets who normally
might have had to forego the
meet because of sub normal sea
son marks.
AND, BY stretching the com
petition from two to three nights
at the host University of New
Mexico’s Stadium, the NCAA

hoped to ease the physical strain
of forcing athletes to compete in
both trial and semi-finals in the
same night.
George McFadden, athletic in
formation director at the host
school, said more than 100 NCAA
member' schools have requested
800 official entry blanks to re
turn before the May 31 deadline.
Entrants must have run,
jumped or thrown well enough
during the season to meet various
standards set by the NCAA
games committee. The only event
open to all comers is the six-mile
run, but that race requires a doc
tor’s certificate of physical fit
ness.
MeFADDEN, who has been
keeping up with the top perform
ers in college track this season,
said that more than 300 athletes
already have qualified to meet the
NCAA standards.

He received the first entry
blank last week from the Univer
sity of Houston, which has a fine
five-man team composed of
sprinter Boyd Timmons and dis
tance men Laurie Elliott, Allen

Irwin, Geoff Walker and A1 Law
rence.
Several Stanford trackmen
have times better than the NCAA
standard, including distance-man
Harry McCalla who could qualify
for the 880, mile, three mile, and
steeplechase.
OTHERS WHO have qualified
in more than one event include
Larry Questad in both sprints,
Paul Schlike in the mile and two
mile, and Steve Cortright in both
hurdles and the triple jump.
The qualifying times in each
event and Stanford athletes who
have matched these times:
too yard dash, tt.fi, (Qnestd), 220 yard
dash (curve), 21.6 (Questad); 440 yard
dash, 47.6; 680 yard run, 1:52 (Milt/, Mc-
Calla, Pratt).
