# Tennis Star Jim Beste Named Year's Top Freshman Athlete
## 
### JUSTIN BECK 
Usually the top frosh athlete
is chosen from one of the major
sports. However, while stars were
not lacking in football, basket
ball, and baseball this year, the
Daily staff has selected a tennis
player, Jim Beste, as the top
frosh athlete of 1962-63.

Beste was chosen not only for
his outstanding freshman record,
but also because potentially he
could be the best tennis player in
Stanford’s history. Right now
tennis coach Bob Renker calls
him, “the best freshman player
I’ve coached since John Douglas.”

LED BV BESTE’S 12-0 record
in dual matches, the frosh squad
compiled a 12-1 record, losing
only to Foothill when Beste and
number two man Tom Maxeiner
were unable to play.
Before coming to Stanford,
Beste had already achieved some
reputation in tennis, winning the
Louisiana High School title two
straight years and being ranked

as the number two junior player
in the country. He also played
on the U.S. Junior Davis Cup
squad.
THIS SUMMER Beste will play
the circuit, running up against
the top amateurs in the country,
picking up the experience he
needs to become a top player.
However, while gaining this ex
perience he gets a high national
ranking, it’s possible he could
move up into the top men’s rank
ings. Coach Renker said, “He’ll
start off unranked and possibly
playing the best players, but with
a little bit of luck he could finish
the year highly ranked.”
Renker feels that Beste was the
top freshman tennis player in
California and very possibly the
best freshman in the nation. It
is unlikely that any of Beste’s
opponents this year would dis
pute that.
Next year Beste is expected to
move into the number one sin
gles spot on the varsity, replac
ing graduating Yoshi Minegishi,
unless another player improves
a surprising amount during the
summer. Not even Douglas was
able to play number one singles
as a sophomore.
EVEN NOW RENKER feels
that Beste would have a good

chance to beat any player in the
country with the possible excep
tion of USC’s Dennis Ralston.
‘‘All he needs is experience,” said
Renker.
Beste’s strong points in his'
game according to the coach are I
his volley and his quickness on j
the court. ‘‘He moves very well
for a player of his size,” said
Renker. “He is also very easy to
coach, listens to advice, and is
bound to improve. All he needs
now is to get a little tougher, and
not make a few errors that young
players tend to make.”
THREE OTHER freshmen fin
ished light behind Beste. Regard
ed as contenders for the award
were football’s Ray Handley,
basketball’s Bob Bedell, and base
ball’s Jimmy Hibbs.
Hibbs finished second to Beste
in the voting for frosh athlete,
and like Beste has the potential
to become one of the greatest
stars in Stanford history.
A POWER HITTING catcher,
he led the frosh squad in batting
with .413, triples with three,
homers with three, and RBl’s
with 18. His average was the high
est of any frosh player in the last
three years.
He was All-CIF his last two
years in high school and starred
for a Dodger-sponsored team last
summer, hitting over .400 for
most of the season.
Frosh coach Ray Young re
gards him as one of the finest
prospects in (he last few years,
placing him in the same class
with former Stanford stars, Jack
Shepard and Ralph Holding.
Hibbs is also regarded as a
prospect by several major league
clubs, although none have made

definite offers to him.
Handley, a halfback from Reno
High, w'as spectacular last fall,
leading the team in rushing, total
offense, and pass receiving. He
w r as also second in punt and kick
off returns, third in tackles, and
had one of the team’s four inter
ceptions. He averaged six yards
a carry rushing.
Bedell, a 6-7 all-CIF star from
Los Angeles, provided much of
the frosh hoopsters scoring
punch during the year. The lanky
forward led the team in that re
spect, averaging 14.5 points a
game. He also topped the team in
rebounds with 167, and w'as third
in assists. He is regarded as a
very fine varsity prospect for
next year’s squad.

JIM BESTE
Frosh athlete of the year
Usually the top frosh athlete
is chosen from one of the major
sports. However, while stars were
not lacking in football, basket
ball, and baseball this year, the
Daily staff has selected a tennis
player, Jim Beste, as the top
frosh athlete of 1962-63.

Beste was chosen not only for
his outstanding freshman record,
but also because potentially he
could be the best tennis player in
Stanford’s history. Right now
tennis coach Bob Renker calls
him, “the best freshman player
I’ve coached since John Douglas.”

LED BV BESTE’S 12-0 record
in dual matches, the frosh squad
compiled a 12-1 record, losing
only to Foothill when Beste and
number two man Tom Maxeiner
were unable to play.
Before coming to Stanford,
Beste had already achieved some
reputation in tennis, winning the
Louisiana High School title two
straight years and being ranked

as the number two junior player
in the country. He also played
on the U.S. Junior Davis Cup
squad.
THIS SUMMER Beste will play
the circuit, running up against
the top amateurs in the country,
picking up the experience he
needs to become a top player.
However, while gaining this ex
perience he gets a high national
ranking, it’s possible he could
move up into the top men’s rank
ings. Coach Renker said, “He’ll
start off unranked and possibly
playing the best players, but with
a little bit of luck he could finish
the year highly ranked.”
Renker feels that Beste was the
top freshman tennis player in
California and very possibly the
best freshman in the nation. It
is unlikely that any of Beste’s
opponents this year would dis
pute that.
Next year Beste is expected to
move into the number one sin
gles spot on the varsity, replac
ing graduating Yoshi Minegishi,
unless another player improves
a surprising amount during the
summer. Not even Douglas was
able to play number one singles
as a sophomore.
EVEN NOW RENKER feels
that Beste would have a good

chance to beat any player in the
country with the possible excep
tion of USC’s Dennis Ralston.
‘‘All he needs is experience,” said
Renker.
Beste’s strong points in his'
game according to the coach are I
his volley and his quickness on j
the court. ‘‘He moves very well
for a player of his size,” said
Renker. “He is also very easy to
coach, listens to advice, and is
bound to improve. All he needs
now is to get a little tougher, and
not make a few errors that young
players tend to make.”
THREE OTHER freshmen fin
ished light behind Beste. Regard
ed as contenders for the award
were football’s Ray Handley,
basketball’s Bob Bedell, and base
ball’s Jimmy Hibbs.
Hibbs finished second to Beste
in the voting for frosh athlete,
and like Beste has the potential
to become one of the greatest
stars in Stanford history.
A POWER HITTING catcher,
he led the frosh squad in batting
with .413, triples with three,
homers with three, and RBl’s
with 18. His average was the high
est of any frosh player in the last
three years.
He was All-CIF his last two
years in high school and starred
for a Dodger-sponsored team last
summer, hitting over .400 for
most of the season.
Frosh coach Ray Young re
gards him as one of the finest
prospects in (he last few years,
placing him in the same class
with former Stanford stars, Jack
Shepard and Ralph Holding.
Hibbs is also regarded as a
prospect by several major league
clubs, although none have made

definite offers to him.

stars in Stanford history.
A POWER HITTING catcher,
he led the frosh squad in batting
with .413, triples with three,
homers with three, and RBl’s
with 18. His average was the high
est of any frosh player in the last
three years.
He was All-CIF his last two
years in high school and starred
for a Dodger-sponsored team last
summer, hitting over .400 for
most of the season.
Frosh coach Ray Young re
gards him as one of the finest
prospects in (he last few years,
placing him in the same class
with former Stanford stars, Jack
Shepard and Ralph Holding.
Hibbs is also regarded as a
prospect by several major league
clubs, although none have made

definite offers to him.
Handley, a halfback from Reno
High, w'as spectacular last fall,
leading the team in rushing, total
offense, and pass receiving. He
w r as also second in punt and kick
off returns, third in tackles, and
had one of the team’s four inter
ceptions. He averaged six yards
a carry rushing.
Bedell, a 6-7 all-CIF star from
Los Angeles, provided much of
the frosh hoopsters scoring
punch during the year. The lanky
forward led the team in that re
spect, averaging 14.5 points a
game. He also topped the team in
rebounds with 167, and w'as third
in assists. He is regarded as a
very fine varsity prospect for
next year’s squad.
