j yesterday afternoon, 5-0.
| The Dekes' winning run came
when Martin Deggeller drove in
Hunt Baseom from second base
with a single, despite a near-per
fect throw from Breakers’ left
fielder, Roger Cox, which hit the
runner in the back five feet from
the plate.
ON THK previous play, Cox
had saved a run by fielding a
single in short left field and wise
ly running the ball back into the
infield, where he trapped Cappy
Hurst, who had doubled, off third.
The Dekes scored on the first
play of the game when Hurst
tripled to right center and scored
when the ball was mishandled at
third. Thereafter, Breakers held
them with the combination of
Rich Lonergan’s high-arch pitch
ing and a couple of excellent
plays by shortstop Phil LeVeen.

BUKAKI KS tied it, 11, in the
sixth with two walks and two of
the meagre total of three hits
Deke pitcher Bill Young allowed.
The latter of the two hits, by
Dave Dierdorff with the bases
loaded, scored the run
In the afternoon game. Alpha
Biz rallied for three unearned
runs in (he fifth which virtually
clinched a previously scoreless
game. A walk, two infield errors,
two sacrifice flies, and a hit plus
two imprudent throws from the
outfield accounted for those runs.
They scored twice more in the
sixth on four hits, including
shortstop Clarence Teng’s third
single of the game.
The Businessmen’s sharp in
field defense, which turned in one
ground ball double play, and shal
low-playing outfield prevented
Neutrinos from even coming close
to scoring until the seventh, when
two Physicists got on base.
