## Negroes Walk Out on Mayor; Justice Dictates to Memphis 
### 
United Press International
Thirteen Negro representatives walked out of a racial grievance
session with Jackson, Miss., officials yesterday after Mayor Allen
Thompson spoke against an integration campaign. “In view of your
rather strong statement.” a Negro spokesman told the mayor, “we
believe this meeting is a waste of time.” The 13 walked out of the
City Commission meeting room, ignoring Thompson’s pleas that
they remain for further discussions. Only four Negroes were left in
the meeting, which Thompson called for a discussion of racial mat
ters. Civil rights leaders had said results of the meeting would
largely determine whether a threatened series of massive anti
segregation demonstrations would he opened in this rigidly segre
gated city. Meanwhile the Supreme Court in a unanimous decision
directed the city of Memphis to “promptly” desegregate its parks,
libraries and museums. The high court also served notice that
southern communities arc moving loo slowly toward integrating
their schools.

POPE SERIOUSLY ILL-VATICAN CITY- Pope John XXIII lay
gravely ill last night with a disease that steadily sapped his
strength. A team of three doctors was in constant attendance on the
81-year-old pontiff but fears increased for the Pope’s life. The Milan
newspaper “Corriede Della Sera” said the Pope told a man who visited
him recently that: “I know very well what is the matter with me
and I also know’ that I have only three or four weeks of life.” There
were increasing reports the pontiff was suffering from cancer and the
same paper quoted Dr. Piero Mazzoni, one of the throe attending
physicians, as saying, “We are in the hands of God rather than
science.”

barriers around the enclave on Friday and the West Berlin city
government protested the act to the Americans. U.S. officials pledged
Saturday they would keep the route open.
