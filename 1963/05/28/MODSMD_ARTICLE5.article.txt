### MICHAEL SAKS 
The Stanford Men’s Glee Club
will present a program of in
formal music today at Tresidder
at 4:30 p.m. in the main lounge.
This free concert is the last musi
cal program of the year at Tresid
der and is sponsored by the Cul
tural Arts Division.
Included in the Glee Club pro
gram are Sea Chanteys, Russian
Folksongs, Drinking Songs. Chor
uses from “The Mikado,” and se
lections from “West Side Story.”
Leon Lack, next year’s G I e e
Club president, stated, “Next year,
we plan to build the group into
an important, widely-known Glee
Club based upon singing enjoy
able music." He said that the
Men’s Glee Club is not at all a

now organization, but has been
little known and rarely heard in
the last few years, “We have just
recently begun to develop again
into a strong and active singing
group,” he added.
LACK N'OTKI) that this year’s
club is composed mainly of fresh
men who have talent and enjoy
singing. He sees them as the nu
clei of next year’s club.
“We were fortunate this year in
obtaining the support of the Ad
ministration in finding a perman
ent director for the Club, Mr.
Robert MacKinnon, music director
of the Comedia theater in Menlo
Park,” Lack said. A recruiting
program beginning with the Jolly-
Up and Axe Day during Pre-Reg
week will aim at increasing the
size of the club to 60 members
coming from all Stanford living

groups and off campus.
“I think I can speak for t he
other members of the Glee Club,”
Lack said, “when I say that we
don’t think of it as just another
class. There is a certain loyalty
that has built up among the mem
bers for the club.”
SINGING in the Charles Krug
winery for Napa alumni is on e
example Lack gave of a spirit
boosting trip. “What really brings
a group together are those bus
trips home. Next year, with a
larger an d more experienced
group, we hope to lake more ex
tensive tours, perhaps to Los An
geles or even back East,” ho said.
Lack concluded, “There is no
reason why Stanford cannot have
a Glee Club of at least compar
able quality to those of the Ivy
League schools.”

men who have talent and enjoy
singing. He sees them as the nu
clei of next year’s club.
“We were fortunate this year in
obtaining the support of the Ad
ministration in finding a perman
ent director for the Club, Mr.
Robert MacKinnon, music director
of the Comedia theater in Menlo
Park,” Lack said. A recruiting
program beginning with the Jolly-
Up and Axe Day during Pre-Reg
week will aim at increasing the
size of the club to 60 members
coming from all Stanford living

groups and off campus.
“I think I can speak for t he
other members of the Glee Club,”
Lack said, “when I say that we
don’t think of it as just another
class. There is a certain loyalty
that has built up among the mem
bers for the club.”
SINGING in the Charles Krug
winery for Napa alumni is on e
example Lack gave of a spirit
boosting trip. “What really brings
a group together are those bus
trips home. Next year, with a
larger an d more experienced
group, we hope to lake more ex
tensive tours, perhaps to Los An
geles or even back East,” ho said.
Lack concluded, “There is no
reason why Stanford cannot have
a Glee Club of at least compar
able quality to those of the Ivy
League schools.”
