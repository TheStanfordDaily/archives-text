# Take-off Still Up in the Air

### 
In a phone interview with
KZSU last night, Jerry Davis,
owner of World Travel Center in
Palo Alto, refused to give the
names of three Stanford profes
sors who, he says, will sign the
charter agreement for a Euro
pean charter flight for “the fac
ulty and students of Stanford”
leaving for London on June 17.
According to a spokesman for
the Civil Aeronautics Board,
(CABt, the charter flight must be
submitted and approved. How
ever, Cassius Kirk Jr.. Vice-Pres
ident of Business Affairs for the
University, said that "it is up to
the airline to see if (he charter is
valid; not the CAB.”
Davis contends that a letter of
authorization from the Universi
ty is not necessary because the
flight is in the name of “the fac
ulty and students of Stanford
University,” not the University
or the ASSU.
He said that the charter flight
requires a passenger list certified
by the Registrar as to the stand
ing of each passenger. If the Uni
versity will not sign the list, each
student must go to the registrar
to obtain his certification.
