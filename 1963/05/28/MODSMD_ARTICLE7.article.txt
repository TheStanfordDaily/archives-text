# Revised Psych Honors Emphasizes Research
## 
### 
An organizational meeting for
sophomores interested in apply
ing for the revised psychology
honors program will be held on
Thursday at 4:15 p.m., in room
EB 37.
The revised honors program en
tails study under a faculty-direct
ed research project for juniors.
Seniors will pursue their own
project under faculty guidance.
Seniors will now write a formal
thesis in place of the senior paper.
The new program is organiz
ed so that the seminars will be
led by one faculty member all
year, instead of three, as before.
Also, seniors will no longer have
to take comprehensive examina
tions at the end of the year.
Application blanks for the hon
ors program are now available in
the psychology department.
