# Sequoia's Essays and Short Stories Viewed As 'Cogent and Exhilirating'
## 
### KATHLEEN DOWNING Managing; Editor 
The banner above the Sequoia
sales booth should read "Cogent
and Exhilerating.” The essays,
short stories and poems in this
j spring’s issue snare their subject
I matters on steel bars and shake
| the points under one’s nose.
Debate about the responsibili
ties of group expression to the
term "Stanford" has not been
closed this year. If Jan Schrei
bor’s articulation of the basis of
conflict which fosters this debate
is correct, a field of sympathetic
compromise might be profitably
cleared for the renewal of the de
bate. Students have argued, as
Schreiber suggests, that a univer
sity’s educational prowness is di
rectly related to its degree of free
student expression.
Juxtaposed with these percep
tive critical essays are three short
| stories. Kathleen Becktold’s “The
j Divine Image" generates the pain
ful, erosive tears of a man from

a simple circumstance, George
loses a game of cards. From this
defeat arises the penetrating
question, “Why?”
PATRICIA WAN’S “And All
The Pear Trees” and Barry Roth’s
“The Fishing” present the per
plexing confrontation of man with
death and desolation. Roth sug
gests that the encounter can be
mastered; Ed does return to his
shack on the coast and sweeps
out the debris of transients. Miss
Wan does not posit a stoic atti
tude; Merriweather can only prat
tle wistfully about his childhood.
THE THREE POEMS of James
McMichael are free of metaphori
cal innuendo which drags poems
from the clarity of a poetic vision
to confusion and nonsense. “For
My Father” best illustrates this
poetic virtue.
The prints which spark th e
pages of this Sequoia were exe
cuted by Stanford art students
under the direction of George
Miyasaki. These lithographs, col
lagraphs and etchings complete
an excellent issue of Stanford’s
literary magazine.
