p INDIANS,
Before you start pack
ing, best inspect your
shirt supply. And
should it be a bit on
the low side, may we
recommend our new
Arrow “Dectolene”
dress shirt. No, we
don’t expect you to
dig the name, but
take our word for it,
this is perhaps the
finest drip-dry num
ber ever fashioned
. . . perfect for the
traveling man. Better
grab up a handful
while the selection is
complete. Short
sleeves, in white,
blue, tan, green.
7.95 ea.
ROOS/ATKINS
