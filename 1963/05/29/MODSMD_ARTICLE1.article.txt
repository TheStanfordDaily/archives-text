(Editors’ Note: This Is the fifth In a
series of articles dealing with undergraduate
Education at Stanford. Quoted statements

Though there are many doubts about the
reliability and advisability of student evalu
ation of undergraduate teaching, most pro
fessors agree that such constructive criti
cism, given in a responsible manner, is of
some value.
Dr. W. H. Cowley, Jacks Professor of
Higher Education, labels as “indefensible”
the idea that students are not qualified to
judge good teaching. Dr. John Black, director
of the Counseling and Testing Center, be
lieves that “student criticism is more valid
than it is usually given credit for being. The
faculty says that students arc not qualified
to judge a course. But you don’t have to be
a specialist to know if you are getting any
thing from a course or not. And in a school
like Stanford, the students do not tend to
give belter ratings to the popular, easy in
structor.”
Professor Ralph Smith of the School of
Electrical Engineering points out that when
there is a disagreement between students
and a faculty member, the faculty member
must follow his own opinion. “But,” ho con

tinues, “you must pay attention to student
evaluation if you have any confidence in
your teaching. If you have any confidence in
your students, then their opinions must be
considered.”
Like Smith, most faculty members quali
fy their support of student evaluation. Says
Dr. W. H. Stone, director of the Freshman
English Program, “It’s great up to a
point.”
Professor A. H, Hast or f, executive head
of the Psychology Department, asks:
“Should we poll students to decide on fac
ulty raises?” The weight given to student
criticism must fall, he says, between that
extreme and “paying no attention to them
whatever.” “Student criticism,” adds Dr.
Philip H. Rhinelander of the Department of
Philosophy, “should never be the single de
termining factor. This would be like judging
a doctor on a popularity poll given among
his patients.”
There are three schools of though about
how student criticism should be obtained:
(1) by a formal polling program under de
partment supervision: (2) by informal
means within the department; and (3) by
direct student action and publication, i.e.,
the “Scratch Sheet.”
Several departments have student polling
programs in operation. The Department of
Mineral Sciences instituted such a program
at the request of the faculty; criticism

sheets are examined by the dean of the de
partment and Jater made available to the
faculty members. The School of Engineering
uses a voluntary system administered to the
students by persons selected by Tau Beta
Pi, a national honorary engineering frater
nity. The History Department has been using
polls to find out about the quality of and
possible improvements in its freshman
series in the history of Western civilization.
The Department of Sociology also asks stu
dents for teacher and course evaluation.
“It is a fair index, one of many.” states Pro
fessor Sanford M. Dornbush, executive head
of the department.
Black believes that the instructor should
have to pass out a sheet at the end of the
year for an evaluation of his course, with
tlie stipulation that he alone will get to see
it. Many professors in nearly every depart
ment voluntarily ask the students for an
evaluation.
Emphasizing that any student evalualion
should be gathered purely on an informal
basis, Dr. Bernard J. Siegel, executive head
of the Anthropology Department, maintains
that teacher evaluation should be the respon
sibility of the department. Along these lines,
Hastorf says that “a better judge of good
teaching (than the “Scratch Sheet”) would
be how much the students are stimulated.”
Dr. Mailer Meyerhof, acting executive head
of the Physics Department, objects to pro

grams administered by departments on the
grounds that they might be biased. “It is
better done independently, even if inaccu
rately,” ho said. Dr. Raymond Giraud, acting
executive head of the French-Italian Depart
ment, while admitting that a department
instituted questionnaire would have “less
harmful repercussions" than something like
the “Scratch Sheet,” emphasized the use of
indirect means of telling whether a profes
sor is being well-received or not. Such
methods include talking to students indi
vidually, talking to the instructor to see
whether he is prepared, and seeing whether
students in a follow-up course are adequately
prepared. Hastorf points out that an instruc
tor ought to be in communication with his
class. “If there is not enough informal feed
back, then the class should be polled,” he
said.
Professor R. Nevitt Sanford, director of
the Human Problems Study Institute sug
gests. "Student criticism might also be ef
fected by little groups of students, sincerely
interested in having things better for next
year’s class, going to talk to the professors
about it. Teachers would think more highly
of groups doing this than individuals.”
The “Scratch Sheet” received mixed com
ments, many extremely favorable and others
critical. Hastorf summed up the main criti
cism: “It was based on very bad sampling,
unbelievably bad, and unreliable.” Siegel

found that “some of tho statements arc ab
solutely specious and should not have been
published.” On the other hand L. L. Wise,
acting dean of the School of Engineering,
said that the School, enrolling over 20 per
cent of undergraduate men, was “disap
pointed” at not having been included.
Cowley emphasized the importance of
having quantitative and qualitative ques
tions in a student poll, not just qualitative
“essay” answers as in the “Scratch Sheet.”
He favors making the “Scratch Sheet” a part
of The Daily as is done at Harvard with the
Harvard Crimson, to give it continuity. Un
like Black, who believes that “a public print
ing is more likely to cause a defensive atti
tude and prevent constructive action,” Cow
ley believes that criticisms must be pub
lished: otherwise the action may take years
and the problem never heard of again.
Most professors agree that student criti
cism has its place and that tho “Scratch
Sheet” is of at least some value. Rhinelander
carries it a step further: “The university
should encourage student evaluation in a
responsible manner; the more encourage
ment, the more responsible will be the opin
ions expressed. It is terribly important to
have effective general student evaluation
continuously.”
Friday’s article, the last of the series,
will deal with the problem of grades and
grading at Stanford.
