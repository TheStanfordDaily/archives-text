## The 						Kennedy Round 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Simple as it sounds, in practice the idea of forming an At
lantic partnership in a low-tariff trading area is in fact huge
and complicated. The preliminary talks for what is called the
Kennedy x - ound of tariff negotiations began some time back
with American inquiries about the agricultural products. The
results were not promising, and it has developed that the Eu
ropean market will first have to agree on its own unsettled
agricultui’al problems befoi’e it can begin to think about ours.
Now Governor Herter has been at Geneva talking about the
pi'inciples by which tariff negotiations should be governed in
accoxdance with the powers granted the President under the
United States Txade Expansion Act.
Although it was always evident that the road to the At
lantic trading partnership was steep and rough, the prelimi
naries have disclosed something which is, I think for almost all
of us, surprising and new. We had been assuming that Europe
wanted so muclx to sell industrial exports in the United States
that it would pay for the privilege by opening its own market
to American farm products and industrial goods. This may prove
to have been a great miscalculation.
Thus, it has been plain for some time that the French farm
bloc has greater influence on French policy than the French.
German and Italian industrialists of the Common Market.
Fxench farmers, who are beginning to develop agricultuxal sur
pluses, will not allow the Common Market to be opened freely
to the cheaper food of American and other overseas farmers.
Yet, the United States Congi’ess is not likely to accept agi’ec
ment in which the American farmer is discriminated against.
In the Geneva preliminaries about negotiating low tariffs,
we were taught that what we first offered the Euxopeans in the
way of access to our market did not seem to them worth what
they would have to concede byway of American access to the
European market. This European attitude is shared by all mem
bers of the Common Market, and it is not-—like the exclusion of
Great Bxatain-—due to a pei'sonal decision by General de Gaulle.
We have reason to think that even if our first offer had been
moi’e attractive, General de Gaulle might on political grounds
have sought ways to aboxt the negotiations. But the trouble
which Governor Herter encountered in Geneva was not due to
Gcnei’al de Gaulle, but to the gi’eat disparity between the Euro
pean and the American tariff systems.
If I have understood the problem at issue between the Eu
ropeans and oui’selves, it is roughly speaking as follows:
The average level of our tariff and of the Common Market
extei’nal tariff is about the same. But the averages conceal very
different rate structures. In the Common Market tariff, 90 per
cent of all the tariff rates are between 10 per cent and 30 per
cent. In the American system, only 63 per cent of the rates are
in this range. We have more low rates than Eui’ope, and we
have more high rates. Thus, 20 per cent of our rates are under
10 per cent; only 9 per cent of the European rates are in this
low bracket. On the other hand, 18 per cent of our rates are
over 30 per cent, but only 1 per cent of the European rates are
in this high bracket.
The Europeans are attacking these high American tariffs,
these peaks jutting up out of the mass of rates. They have de-*
manded that before there is a general linear cut, for which we
are asking, there should be an “excretment.” which is a Fi’ench
word for lopping off the peaks.
They point, for example, to the very high tariff on coal tar
dyes. This ingenious tariff schedule imposes a duty of 36 per
cent to 40 per cent. And it imposes this high rate not on the
F. 0.8. price in the country of ox-igin, but on the selling price of
similar products of American origin. This device roughly doubles
the effective tariff rate.
It is evident that the Eui’opeans have a grievance and that
there is something in their claim that to cut such an exorbitant
tariff by 50 per cent would still leave it an exorbitant rate. Had
we not acknowledged that there is jurtice in the European argu
ment, the negotiations would have failed at the very beginning.
The actual negotiations, as distinguished from the prelimi
nary talks about procedure and principle, will, presumably,
begin next May. But substantial agreement is still far off in
order to agree on a partnership in the vast Atlantic world, there
will be needed in order to overcome the objective difficulties not
only unusual flexibility and ingenuity on the part of the gov
ernments and the legislatures, but an overriding will to bring
the Atlantic partnership into existence. The best one can say is
for the time being all are agreed that there is no alternative but
to go on ti'ying.

cent to 40 per cent. And it imposes this high rate not on the
F. 0.8. price in the country of ox-igin, but on the selling price of
similar products of American origin. This device roughly doubles
the effective tariff rate.
It is evident that the Eui’opeans have a grievance and that
there is something in their claim that to cut such an exorbitant
tariff by 50 per cent would still leave it an exorbitant rate. Had
we not acknowledged that there is jurtice in the European argu
ment, the negotiations would have failed at the very beginning.
The actual negotiations, as distinguished from the prelimi
nary talks about procedure and principle, will, presumably,
begin next May. But substantial agreement is still far off in
order to agree on a partnership in the vast Atlantic world, there
will be needed in order to overcome the objective difficulties not
only unusual flexibility and ingenuity on the part of the gov
ernments and the legislatures, but an overriding will to bring
the Atlantic partnership into existence. The best one can say is
for the time being all are agreed that there is no alternative but
to go on ti'ying.

Simple as it sounds, in practice the idea of forming an At
lantic partnership in a low-tariff trading area is in fact huge
and complicated. The preliminary talks for what is called the
Kennedy x - ound of tariff negotiations began some time back
with American inquiries about the agricultural products. The
results were not promising, and it has developed that the Eu
ropean market will first have to agree on its own unsettled
agricultui’al problems befoi’e it can begin to think about ours.
Now Governor Herter has been at Geneva talking about the
pi'inciples by which tariff negotiations should be governed in
accoxdance with the powers granted the President under the
United States Txade Expansion Act.
Although it was always evident that the road to the At
lantic trading partnership was steep and rough, the prelimi
naries have disclosed something which is, I think for almost all
of us, surprising and new. We had been assuming that Europe
wanted so muclx to sell industrial exports in the United States
that it would pay for the privilege by opening its own market
to American farm products and industrial goods. This may prove
to have been a great miscalculation.
Thus, it has been plain for some time that the French farm
bloc has greater influence on French policy than the French.
German and Italian industrialists of the Common Market.
Fxench farmers, who are beginning to develop agricultuxal sur
pluses, will not allow the Common Market to be opened freely
to the cheaper food of American and other overseas farmers.
Yet, the United States Congi’ess is not likely to accept agi’ec
ment in which the American farmer is discriminated against.
In the Geneva preliminaries about negotiating low tariffs,
we were taught that what we first offered the Euxopeans in the
way of access to our market did not seem to them worth what
they would have to concede byway of American access to the
European market. This European attitude is shared by all mem
bers of the Common Market, and it is not-—like the exclusion of
Great Bxatain-—due to a pei'sonal decision by General de Gaulle.
We have reason to think that even if our first offer had been
moi’e attractive, General de Gaulle might on political grounds
have sought ways to aboxt the negotiations. But the trouble
which Governor Herter encountered in Geneva was not due to
Gcnei’al de Gaulle, but to the gi’eat disparity between the Euro
pean and the American tariff systems.
If I have understood the problem at issue between the Eu
ropeans and oui’selves, it is roughly speaking as follows:
The average level of our tariff and of the Common Market
extei’nal tariff is about the same. But the averages conceal very
different rate structures. In the Common Market tariff, 90 per
cent of all the tariff rates are between 10 per cent and 30 per
cent. In the American system, only 63 per cent of the rates are
in this range. We have more low rates than Eui’ope, and we
have more high rates. Thus, 20 per cent of our rates are under
10 per cent; only 9 per cent of the European rates are in this
low bracket. On the other hand, 18 per cent of our rates are
over 30 per cent, but only 1 per cent of the European rates are
in this high bracket.
The Europeans are attacking these high American tariffs,
these peaks jutting up out of the mass of rates. They have de-*
manded that before there is a general linear cut, for which we
are asking, there should be an “excretment.” which is a Fi’ench
word for lopping off the peaks.
They point, for example, to the very high tariff on coal tar
dyes. This ingenious tariff schedule imposes a duty of 36 per

The average level of our tariff and of the Common Market
extei’nal tariff is about the same. But the averages conceal very
different rate structures. In the Common Market tariff, 90 per
cent of all the tariff rates are between 10 per cent and 30 per
cent. In the American system, only 63 per cent of the rates are
in this range. We have more low rates than Eui’ope, and we
have more high rates. Thus, 20 per cent of our rates are under
10 per cent; only 9 per cent of the European rates are in this
low bracket. On the other hand, 18 per cent of our rates are
over 30 per cent, but only 1 per cent of the European rates are
in this high bracket.
The Europeans are attacking these high American tariffs,
these peaks jutting up out of the mass of rates. They have de-*
manded that before there is a general linear cut, for which we
are asking, there should be an “excretment.” which is a Fi’ench
word for lopping off the peaks.
They point, for example, to the very high tariff on coal tar
dyes. This ingenious tariff schedule imposes a duty of 36 per
cent to 40 per cent. And it imposes this high rate not on the
F. 0.8. price in the country of ox-igin, but on the selling price of
similar products of American origin. This device roughly doubles
the effective tariff rate.
It is evident that the Eui’opeans have a grievance and that
there is something in their claim that to cut such an exorbitant
tariff by 50 per cent would still leave it an exorbitant rate. Had
we not acknowledged that there is jurtice in the European argu
ment, the negotiations would have failed at the very beginning.
The actual negotiations, as distinguished from the prelimi
nary talks about procedure and principle, will, presumably,
begin next May. But substantial agreement is still far off in
order to agree on a partnership in the vast Atlantic world, there
will be needed in order to overcome the objective difficulties not
only unusual flexibility and ingenuity on the part of the gov
ernments and the legislatures, but an overriding will to bring
the Atlantic partnership into existence. The best one can say is
for the time being all are agreed that there is no alternative but
to go on ti'ying.
