Editors, Tin* Daily:
During the school year ’62-’63, (lie pages of The Daily have
been the jousting arena for some of the most interesting, amus
ing, ridiculous and even important questions that Stanford men
and women have faced and desired to speak out on. Many prob
lems exist in our midst it is true, and a public expression of them
is justified in every respect, but I cannot help wondering why a
few of our letters to the editor do not express a positive con
gratulations and encouragement for a job truly well done. Some
thing is lacking when only criticism is used to bring about a
worthwhile situation, for a positive comment is often in order to
maintain what is already functioning well.
Today two campus organizations were seriously maligned
by what 1 consider an unthinking reader. These two groups were
the 1963 Quad editors and a group of “white collar money grub
bers and the PACE programs intellectual eunuchs.” The PACE
program has fallen under a great deal of satirical panning and
sarcasm. Study its methods have at times seemed a little too
high-powered and over-exuberant and problems indeed exist, but
a condemnation of these men as “intellectual eunuchs” is not
only absurd, but truly disheartening. It sounds as if Mr. Reaves
would like us to return to the “good old days” when every class
room was as well lit and furnished as the history corner is today.
It is surely appalling that these “white collar money grubbers”
would like to bring our Chemistry Department out of the days
of Merlin the Magician and the dark ages to the twentieth cen
tury. This is surely an expression of their extreme stupidity. I
suppose he shuddered when he saw the picture of the newly
planned undergraduate library or publications building, attended
a concert in Dinkelspiel, had a snack and conversation at Tre
sidder, bought his books at the new bookstore, or had a class in
a comfortable and well-lighted room. If THE SUCCESS OF DE
VELOPMENT and DYNAMIC EXPANSION mean a transition
from the “temporary” shacks behind Cubberley and from the
labs where the greatest hope is that they will not fall in, then
I think a Plan of Action for attaining it and a tribute to its
success is warranted and highly commendable. I owe my pres
ence at this university to these “money-grubbers,” and some
how I cannot help but thank them for their concern and help
and encourage them to do the dirty work of grubbing on.
Mr. Reaves’ criticism of the Quad itself is equally unjusti
fied. If he is mystified at the caption “growth of ideas” for
Memorial Church, I suggest he consult a few history texts and
discover that a search for God and some form of spiritual Truth
have inspired the “growth of ideas” for a greater part of the
world's history. I am surprised at the aesthetic vacuum that
must exist when he is suspicious of photography so closely akin
to true art that it equates a pastoral scene, the setting sun and
the inspiration offered by the physical earth with a desire to
receive inspiration from it and “develop the mind,” If he believes
that a student’s growth here is not closely linked with the
broadening of his social as w'ell as intellectual being then I
cannot help but wonder if he even helped with the frosh bonfire,
attended a football game or paid a visit to the Memorial Church.
I am surprised that he did not see the inspired comments of the
university’s professors in the literary as an administration at
tempt to coerce us into thinking or considering them wise. Upon
contacting the Quad office, I was assured that “INDEPEND
ENT MINDS” was definitely not an afterthought to pacify the
Peace Caucus, since that particular section had gone to press
weeks before the vigil was even imagined. I was also informed
that the editorial policy and theme of "Growth” was entirely the
work of the editor and staff and was in no way affected by ad
ministrative suggestions. Mr. Reaves’ comments lack thought
and basis in fact. The Quad is not perfect, but it is an immense
undertaking that has been carried off surprisingly well. It is a
tribute to Miss Hellstrom and her staff and based on a notion
that I hope never dies at Stanford—Growth.

Editors, The Daily:
We of the crew who are about to take leave of the Good Ship
Stanford cannot but wonder at where its future travels will take
it. We have seen it come a long way.
This former sailing vessel, originally a pleasure yacht, was
converted into a passenger ship, carrying young minds across
vast expanses of learning. These voyages were perilous, but the
ship had a record of few people, being lost overboard, and few
others even having to get their feet wet. I guess this is why
Stanford was known as a dry ship. And it was such a gay little
craft, as it ran whore The Winds of Freedom blew.
So much did The Stanford’s record improve, that it soon
became known in western waters as were certain other ships on
the eastern coast. Thus it was that our sterling Captain and his
officers decided to raise the money needed to outfit the tired old
hull with a full PACE engine. So began "Old Sandstonesides”
conversion to a racing yacht. And we who had rightfully been
passengers began to think of ourselves as being crew members,
lor some reason. Now The Stanford could run where it would,
surpassing all previous eastern successes. An advantage, of
course, whas that now we could make fair headway, even when
we chose to go against The Winds.
When next I see our ol’ Captain, tired as he is from his
money-raising efforts, as he sits at his favorite vantage point
—in the Stern of the ship, where he can watch the mighty wake
—I will repiind him of one thing. The Ship’s great wake is caused
by the ship’s motion; but the purpose of this moving should not
be to create a wake, but to get somewhei’e.
Then again, perhaps I won’t mention it.
To the crew I will say this. You will have to work harder
than we did keeping the coal burning, because in our day there
was no coal, and there was no place to burn it anyway. But you
get paid only for doing the job, so thex’e is no use putting in
moi'e coal than the machine can u&e.' You' are great, but being
told so should not act as an inhibition nor as an incentive. Since
you signed on voluntarily, and are staying on of your own free
will, don’t, give up the ship; but don’t rock the boat.

Editors, The Daily:
Next fall when we return to the familiar and informal grind,
few of us will be aware of the 150 foreign students who will be
new not only to the university but to the very form of life we
lead. These foreign students will experience that self-conscious
embarrassment which accompanies unfamiliarity and the search
for the proper way of doing things and of making a friend. A
friend to whom they can turn when they are perplexed or appre
hensive. Such a friend is a necessary adjunct to their entry into
our society and his understanding of it.
Unfortunately, the foreigner is handicapped by a natural
tendency to be slow and cautious in making human contacts. To
complicate things we are a fast people; fast-talking, fast-judging,
and fast-choosing friends.
For this reason the Foreign Student Pre-Reg Committee has
decided to request the help of students who will be living off
campus next fall. If you could accommodate one foreign student
from a world area that interests you, you would provide not only
a place for him to live, but also someone for him to turn to, at
no cost to yourself except in time and patience. And quite pos
sibly you would learn something worthwhile.
If you are willing to help, please sign your name and address
on the list in the UR Loft. You need not know your next year’s
residence, nor is this a commitment. The choice and the responsi
bility remain yours.

Editors, The Daily:
All of us are, or should be, well aware that Stanford is, or
at least makes claim to being, a great university. Like most
great institutions, however, it has some minor faults and flaws.
Somewhere in the administrative shuffle, a number of small—
hence, often incorrectly, presumed to be unimportant, although
in reality the services they perform may be vital to the operation
of the University—departments tend to be lost, neglected, or
overlooked, not only by the students but also, as it would seem,
by the administrators of the Budget.
Such a one is the Mimeograph Service, now relegated to a
shabby office in the studio buildings, next to the old Quad office.
I his department is suffering from a serious lack of office furni
ture, such as chairs, to such a degree that it appears not to have
enough chairs even for all its personnel, since it could not lend
out a chair to be used by a student to sit in and study for a
little while.
Since it will be some time, no doubt, before any Administra
tion measure to remedy the insufficiency could take effect. I
should like to suggest that any students or other people having
some used chairs they do not need, bring them to the Mimeo
graph Service. I shall personally contribute two chairs.

was no coal, and there was no place to burn it anyway. But you
get paid only for doing the job, so thex’e is no use putting in
moi'e coal than the machine can u&e.' You' are great, but being

you signed on voluntarily, and are staying on of your own free

Next fall when we return to the familiar and informal grind,
few of us will be aware of the 150 foreign students who will be
new not only to the university but to the very form of life we
lead. These foreign students will experience that self-conscious
embarrassment which accompanies unfamiliarity and the search
for the proper way of doing things and of making a friend. A
friend to whom they can turn when they are perplexed or appre
hensive. Such a friend is a necessary adjunct to their entry into
our society and his understanding of it.
Unfortunately, the foreigner is handicapped by a natural
tendency to be slow and cautious in making human contacts. To
complicate things we are a fast people; fast-talking, fast-judging,
and fast-choosing friends.
For this reason the Foreign Student Pre-Reg Committee has
decided to request the help of students who will be living off
campus next fall. If you could accommodate one foreign student
from a world area that interests you, you would provide not only
a place for him to live, but also someone for him to turn to, at
no cost to yourself except in time and patience. And quite pos
sibly you would learn something worthwhile.
If you are willing to help, please sign your name and address
on the list in the UR Loft. You need not know your next year’s
residence, nor is this a commitment. The choice and the responsi
bility remain yours.

All of us are, or should be, well aware that Stanford is, or
at least makes claim to being, a great university. Like most
great institutions, however, it has some minor faults and flaws.
Somewhere in the administrative shuffle, a number of small—
hence, often incorrectly, presumed to be unimportant, although
in reality the services they perform may be vital to the operation
of the University—departments tend to be lost, neglected, or
overlooked, not only by the students but also, as it would seem,
by the administrators of the Budget.
Such a one is the Mimeograph Service, now relegated to a
shabby office in the studio buildings, next to the old Quad office.
I his department is suffering from a serious lack of office furni
ture, such as chairs, to such a degree that it appears not to have
enough chairs even for all its personnel, since it could not lend
out a chair to be used by a student to sit in and study for a
little while.
Since it will be some time, no doubt, before any Administra
tion measure to remedy the insufficiency could take effect. I
should like to suggest that any students or other people having
some used chairs they do not need, bring them to the Mimeo
graph Service. I shall personally contribute two chairs.
Randall G. Millen
Editors, Tin* Daily:
During the school year ’62-’63, (lie pages of The Daily have
been the jousting arena for some of the most interesting, amus
ing, ridiculous and even important questions that Stanford men
and women have faced and desired to speak out on. Many prob
lems exist in our midst it is true, and a public expression of them
is justified in every respect, but I cannot help wondering why a
few of our letters to the editor do not express a positive con
gratulations and encouragement for a job truly well done. Some
thing is lacking when only criticism is used to bring about a
worthwhile situation, for a positive comment is often in order to
maintain what is already functioning well.
Today two campus organizations were seriously maligned
by what 1 consider an unthinking reader. These two groups were
the 1963 Quad editors and a group of “white collar money grub
bers and the PACE programs intellectual eunuchs.” The PACE
program has fallen under a great deal of satirical panning and
sarcasm. Study its methods have at times seemed a little too
high-powered and over-exuberant and problems indeed exist, but
a condemnation of these men as “intellectual eunuchs” is not
only absurd, but truly disheartening. It sounds as if Mr. Reaves
would like us to return to the “good old days” when every class
room was as well lit and furnished as the history corner is today.
It is surely appalling that these “white collar money grubbers”
would like to bring our Chemistry Department out of the days
of Merlin the Magician and the dark ages to the twentieth cen
tury. This is surely an expression of their extreme stupidity. I
suppose he shuddered when he saw the picture of the newly
planned undergraduate library or publications building, attended
a concert in Dinkelspiel, had a snack and conversation at Tre
sidder, bought his books at the new bookstore, or had a class in
a comfortable and well-lighted room. If THE SUCCESS OF DE
VELOPMENT and DYNAMIC EXPANSION mean a transition
from the “temporary” shacks behind Cubberley and from the
labs where the greatest hope is that they will not fall in, then
I think a Plan of Action for attaining it and a tribute to its
success is warranted and highly commendable. I owe my pres
ence at this university to these “money-grubbers,” and some
how I cannot help but thank them for their concern and help
and encourage them to do the dirty work of grubbing on.
Mr. Reaves’ criticism of the Quad itself is equally unjusti
fied. If he is mystified at the caption “growth of ideas” for
Memorial Church, I suggest he consult a few history texts and
discover that a search for God and some form of spiritual Truth
have inspired the “growth of ideas” for a greater part of the
world's history. I am surprised at the aesthetic vacuum that
must exist when he is suspicious of photography so closely akin
to true art that it equates a pastoral scene, the setting sun and
the inspiration offered by the physical earth with a desire to
receive inspiration from it and “develop the mind,” If he believes
that a student’s growth here is not closely linked with the
broadening of his social as w'ell as intellectual being then I
cannot help but wonder if he even helped with the frosh bonfire,
attended a football game or paid a visit to the Memorial Church.
I am surprised that he did not see the inspired comments of the
university’s professors in the literary as an administration at
tempt to coerce us into thinking or considering them wise. Upon
contacting the Quad office, I was assured that “INDEPEND
ENT MINDS” was definitely not an afterthought to pacify the
Peace Caucus, since that particular section had gone to press
weeks before the vigil was even imagined. I was also informed
that the editorial policy and theme of "Growth” was entirely the
work of the editor and staff and was in no way affected by ad
ministrative suggestions. Mr. Reaves’ comments lack thought
and basis in fact. The Quad is not perfect, but it is an immense
undertaking that has been carried off surprisingly well. It is a
tribute to Miss Hellstrom and her staff and based on a notion
that I hope never dies at Stanford—Growth.

Editors, The Daily:
We of the crew who are about to take leave of the Good Ship
Stanford cannot but wonder at where its future travels will take
it. We have seen it come a long way.
This former sailing vessel, originally a pleasure yacht, was
converted into a passenger ship, carrying young minds across
vast expanses of learning. These voyages were perilous, but the
ship had a record of few people, being lost overboard, and few
others even having to get their feet wet. I guess this is why
Stanford was known as a dry ship. And it was such a gay little
craft, as it ran whore The Winds of Freedom blew.
So much did The Stanford’s record improve, that it soon
became known in western waters as were certain other ships on
the eastern coast. Thus it was that our sterling Captain and his
officers decided to raise the money needed to outfit the tired old
hull with a full PACE engine. So began "Old Sandstonesides”
conversion to a racing yacht. And we who had rightfully been
passengers began to think of ourselves as being crew members,
lor some reason. Now The Stanford could run where it would,
surpassing all previous eastern successes. An advantage, of
course, whas that now we could make fair headway, even when
we chose to go against The Winds.
When next I see our ol’ Captain, tired as he is from his
money-raising efforts, as he sits at his favorite vantage point
—in the Stern of the ship, where he can watch the mighty wake
—I will repiind him of one thing. The Ship’s great wake is caused
by the ship’s motion; but the purpose of this moving should not
be to create a wake, but to get somewhei’e.
Then again, perhaps I won’t mention it.
To the crew I will say this. You will have to work harder
than we did keeping the coal burning, because in our day there
was no coal, and there was no place to burn it anyway. But you
get paid only for doing the job, so thex’e is no use putting in
moi'e coal than the machine can u&e.' You' are great, but being
told so should not act as an inhibition nor as an incentive. Since
you signed on voluntarily, and are staying on of your own free
will, don’t, give up the ship; but don’t rock the boat.

Mr. Reaves’ criticism of the Quad itself is equally unjusti
fied. If he is mystified at the caption “growth of ideas” for
Memorial Church, I suggest he consult a few history texts and
discover that a search for God and some form of spiritual Truth
have inspired the “growth of ideas” for a greater part of the
world's history. I am surprised at the aesthetic vacuum that
must exist when he is suspicious of photography so closely akin
to true art that it equates a pastoral scene, the setting sun and
the inspiration offered by the physical earth with a desire to
receive inspiration from it and “develop the mind,” If he believes
that a student’s growth here is not closely linked with the
broadening of his social as w'ell as intellectual being then I
cannot help but wonder if he even helped with the frosh bonfire,
attended a football game or paid a visit to the Memorial Church.
I am surprised that he did not see the inspired comments of the
university’s professors in the literary as an administration at
tempt to coerce us into thinking or considering them wise. Upon
contacting the Quad office, I was assured that “INDEPEND
ENT MINDS” was definitely not an afterthought to pacify the
Peace Caucus, since that particular section had gone to press
weeks before the vigil was even imagined. I was also informed
that the editorial policy and theme of "Growth” was entirely the
work of the editor and staff and was in no way affected by ad
ministrative suggestions. Mr. Reaves’ comments lack thought
and basis in fact. The Quad is not perfect, but it is an immense
undertaking that has been carried off surprisingly well. It is a
tribute to Miss Hellstrom and her staff and based on a notion
that I hope never dies at Stanford—Growth.

Editors, The Daily:
We of the crew who are about to take leave of the Good Ship
Stanford cannot but wonder at where its future travels will take
it. We have seen it come a long way.
This former sailing vessel, originally a pleasure yacht, was
converted into a passenger ship, carrying young minds across
vast expanses of learning. These voyages were perilous, but the
ship had a record of few people, being lost overboard, and few
others even having to get their feet wet. I guess this is why
Stanford was known as a dry ship. And it was such a gay little
craft, as it ran whore The Winds of Freedom blew.
So much did The Stanford’s record improve, that it soon
became known in western waters as were certain other ships on
the eastern coast. Thus it was that our sterling Captain and his
officers decided to raise the money needed to outfit the tired old
hull with a full PACE engine. So began "Old Sandstonesides”
conversion to a racing yacht. And we who had rightfully been
passengers began to think of ourselves as being crew members,
lor some reason. Now The Stanford could run where it would,
surpassing all previous eastern successes. An advantage, of
course, whas that now we could make fair headway, even when
we chose to go against The Winds.
When next I see our ol’ Captain, tired as he is from his
money-raising efforts, as he sits at his favorite vantage point
—in the Stern of the ship, where he can watch the mighty wake
—I will repiind him of one thing. The Ship’s great wake is caused
by the ship’s motion; but the purpose of this moving should not
be to create a wake, but to get somewhei’e.
Then again, perhaps I won’t mention it.
To the crew I will say this. You will have to work harder
than we did keeping the coal burning, because in our day there
was no coal, and there was no place to burn it anyway. But you
get paid only for doing the job, so thex’e is no use putting in
moi'e coal than the machine can u&e.' You' are great, but being
told so should not act as an inhibition nor as an incentive. Since
you signed on voluntarily, and are staying on of your own free
will, don’t, give up the ship; but don’t rock the boat.

Next fall when we return to the familiar and informal grind,
few of us will be aware of the 150 foreign students who will be
new not only to the university but to the very form of life we
lead. These foreign students will experience that self-conscious
embarrassment which accompanies unfamiliarity and the search
for the proper way of doing things and of making a friend. A
friend to whom they can turn when they are perplexed or appre
hensive. Such a friend is a necessary adjunct to their entry into
our society and his understanding of it.
Unfortunately, the foreigner is handicapped by a natural
tendency to be slow and cautious in making human contacts. To
complicate things we are a fast people; fast-talking, fast-judging,
and fast-choosing friends.
For this reason the Foreign Student Pre-Reg Committee has
decided to request the help of students who will be living off
campus next fall. If you could accommodate one foreign student
from a world area that interests you, you would provide not only
a place for him to live, but also someone for him to turn to, at
no cost to yourself except in time and patience. And quite pos
sibly you would learn something worthwhile.
If you are willing to help, please sign your name and address
on the list in the UR Loft. You need not know your next year’s
residence, nor is this a commitment. The choice and the responsi
bility remain yours.

Editors, The Daily:
All of us are, or should be, well aware that Stanford is, or
at least makes claim to being, a great university. Like most
great institutions, however, it has some minor faults and flaws.
Somewhere in the administrative shuffle, a number of small—
hence, often incorrectly, presumed to be unimportant, although
in reality the services they perform may be vital to the operation
of the University—departments tend to be lost, neglected, or
overlooked, not only by the students but also, as it would seem,
by the administrators of the Budget.
Such a one is the Mimeograph Service, now relegated to a
shabby office in the studio buildings, next to the old Quad office.
I his department is suffering from a serious lack of office furni
ture, such as chairs, to such a degree that it appears not to have
enough chairs even for all its personnel, since it could not lend
out a chair to be used by a student to sit in and study for a
little while.
Since it will be some time, no doubt, before any Administra
tion measure to remedy the insufficiency could take effect. I
should like to suggest that any students or other people having
some used chairs they do not need, bring them to the Mimeo
graph Service. I shall personally contribute two chairs.
Randall G. Millen
Editors, Tin* Daily:
During the school year ’62-’63, (lie pages of The Daily have
been the jousting arena for some of the most interesting, amus
ing, ridiculous and even important questions that Stanford men
and women have faced and desired to speak out on. Many prob
lems exist in our midst it is true, and a public expression of them
is justified in every respect, but I cannot help wondering why a
few of our letters to the editor do not express a positive con
gratulations and encouragement for a job truly well done. Some
thing is lacking when only criticism is used to bring about a
worthwhile situation, for a positive comment is often in order to
maintain what is already functioning well.
Today two campus organizations were seriously maligned
by what 1 consider an unthinking reader. These two groups were
the 1963 Quad editors and a group of “white collar money grub
bers and the PACE programs intellectual eunuchs.” The PACE
program has fallen under a great deal of satirical panning and
sarcasm. Study its methods have at times seemed a little too
high-powered and over-exuberant and problems indeed exist, but
a condemnation of these men as “intellectual eunuchs” is not
only absurd, but truly disheartening. It sounds as if Mr. Reaves
would like us to return to the “good old days” when every class
room was as well lit and furnished as the history corner is today.
It is surely appalling that these “white collar money grubbers”
would like to bring our Chemistry Department out of the days
of Merlin the Magician and the dark ages to the twentieth cen
tury. This is surely an expression of their extreme stupidity. I
suppose he shuddered when he saw the picture of the newly
planned undergraduate library or publications building, attended
a concert in Dinkelspiel, had a snack and conversation at Tre
sidder, bought his books at the new bookstore, or had a class in
a comfortable and well-lighted room. If THE SUCCESS OF DE
VELOPMENT and DYNAMIC EXPANSION mean a transition
from the “temporary” shacks behind Cubberley and from the
labs where the greatest hope is that they will not fall in, then
I think a Plan of Action for attaining it and a tribute to its
success is warranted and highly commendable. I owe my pres
ence at this university to these “money-grubbers,” and some
how I cannot help but thank them for their concern and help
and encourage them to do the dirty work of grubbing on.
Mr. Reaves’ criticism of the Quad itself is equally unjusti
fied. If he is mystified at the caption “growth of ideas” for
Memorial Church, I suggest he consult a few history texts and
discover that a search for God and some form of spiritual Truth
have inspired the “growth of ideas” for a greater part of the
world's history. I am surprised at the aesthetic vacuum that
must exist when he is suspicious of photography so closely akin
to true art that it equates a pastoral scene, the setting sun and
the inspiration offered by the physical earth with a desire to
receive inspiration from it and “develop the mind,” If he believes
that a student’s growth here is not closely linked with the
broadening of his social as w'ell as intellectual being then I
cannot help but wonder if he even helped with the frosh bonfire,
attended a football game or paid a visit to the Memorial Church.
I am surprised that he did not see the inspired comments of the

Somewhere in the administrative shuffle, a number of small—
hence, often incorrectly, presumed to be unimportant, although
in reality the services they perform may be vital to the operation
of the University—departments tend to be lost, neglected, or
overlooked, not only by the students but also, as it would seem,
by the administrators of the Budget.
Such a one is the Mimeograph Service, now relegated to a
shabby office in the studio buildings, next to the old Quad office.
I his department is suffering from a serious lack of office furni
ture, such as chairs, to such a degree that it appears not to have
enough chairs even for all its personnel, since it could not lend
out a chair to be used by a student to sit in and study for a
little while.
Since it will be some time, no doubt, before any Administra
tion measure to remedy the insufficiency could take effect. I
should like to suggest that any students or other people having
some used chairs they do not need, bring them to the Mimeo
graph Service. I shall personally contribute two chairs.

Editors, Tin* Daily:
During the school year ’62-’63, (lie pages of The Daily have
been the jousting arena for some of the most interesting, amus
ing, ridiculous and even important questions that Stanford men
and women have faced and desired to speak out on. Many prob
lems exist in our midst it is true, and a public expression of them
is justified in every respect, but I cannot help wondering why a
few of our letters to the editor do not express a positive con
gratulations and encouragement for a job truly well done. Some
thing is lacking when only criticism is used to bring about a
worthwhile situation, for a positive comment is often in order to
maintain what is already functioning well.
Today two campus organizations were seriously maligned
by what 1 consider an unthinking reader. These two groups were
the 1963 Quad editors and a group of “white collar money grub
bers and the PACE programs intellectual eunuchs.” The PACE
program has fallen under a great deal of satirical panning and
sarcasm. Study its methods have at times seemed a little too
high-powered and over-exuberant and problems indeed exist, but
a condemnation of these men as “intellectual eunuchs” is not
only absurd, but truly disheartening. It sounds as if Mr. Reaves
would like us to return to the “good old days” when every class
room was as well lit and furnished as the history corner is today.
It is surely appalling that these “white collar money grubbers”
would like to bring our Chemistry Department out of the days
of Merlin the Magician and the dark ages to the twentieth cen
tury. This is surely an expression of their extreme stupidity. I
suppose he shuddered when he saw the picture of the newly
planned undergraduate library or publications building, attended
a concert in Dinkelspiel, had a snack and conversation at Tre
sidder, bought his books at the new bookstore, or had a class in
a comfortable and well-lighted room. If THE SUCCESS OF DE
VELOPMENT and DYNAMIC EXPANSION mean a transition
from the “temporary” shacks behind Cubberley and from the
labs where the greatest hope is that they will not fall in, then
I think a Plan of Action for attaining it and a tribute to its
success is warranted and highly commendable. I owe my pres
ence at this university to these “money-grubbers,” and some
how I cannot help but thank them for their concern and help
and encourage them to do the dirty work of grubbing on.
Mr. Reaves’ criticism of the Quad itself is equally unjusti
fied. If he is mystified at the caption “growth of ideas” for
Memorial Church, I suggest he consult a few history texts and
discover that a search for God and some form of spiritual Truth
have inspired the “growth of ideas” for a greater part of the
world's history. I am surprised at the aesthetic vacuum that
must exist when he is suspicious of photography so closely akin
to true art that it equates a pastoral scene, the setting sun and
the inspiration offered by the physical earth with a desire to
receive inspiration from it and “develop the mind,” If he believes
that a student’s growth here is not closely linked with the
broadening of his social as w'ell as intellectual being then I
cannot help but wonder if he even helped with the frosh bonfire,
attended a football game or paid a visit to the Memorial Church.
I am surprised that he did not see the inspired comments of the
university’s professors in the literary as an administration at
tempt to coerce us into thinking or considering them wise. Upon
contacting the Quad office, I was assured that “INDEPEND
ENT MINDS” was definitely not an afterthought to pacify the
Peace Caucus, since that particular section had gone to press
weeks before the vigil was even imagined. I was also informed
that the editorial policy and theme of "Growth” was entirely the
work of the editor and staff and was in no way affected by ad
ministrative suggestions. Mr. Reaves’ comments lack thought
and basis in fact. The Quad is not perfect, but it is an immense
undertaking that has been carried off surprisingly well. It is a
tribute to Miss Hellstrom and her staff and based on a notion
that I hope never dies at Stanford—Growth.

Editors, The Daily:
We of the crew who are about to take leave of the Good Ship
Stanford cannot but wonder at where its future travels will take
it. We have seen it come a long way.
This former sailing vessel, originally a pleasure yacht, was
converted into a passenger ship, carrying young minds across
vast expanses of learning. These voyages were perilous, but the
ship had a record of few people, being lost overboard, and few
others even having to get their feet wet. I guess this is why
Stanford was known as a dry ship. And it was such a gay little
craft, as it ran whore The Winds of Freedom blew.
So much did The Stanford’s record improve, that it soon
became known in western waters as were certain other ships on
the eastern coast. Thus it was that our sterling Captain and his
officers decided to raise the money needed to outfit the tired old
hull with a full PACE engine. So began "Old Sandstonesides”
conversion to a racing yacht. And we who had rightfully been
passengers began to think of ourselves as being crew members,
lor some reason. Now The Stanford could run where it would,
surpassing all previous eastern successes. An advantage, of
course, whas that now we could make fair headway, even when
we chose to go against The Winds.
When next I see our ol’ Captain, tired as he is from his
money-raising efforts, as he sits at his favorite vantage point
—in the Stern of the ship, where he can watch the mighty wake
—I will repiind him of one thing. The Ship’s great wake is caused
by the ship’s motion; but the purpose of this moving should not
be to create a wake, but to get somewhei’e.
Then again, perhaps I won’t mention it.
To the crew I will say this. You will have to work harder
than we did keeping the coal burning, because in our day there
was no coal, and there was no place to burn it anyway. But you
get paid only for doing the job, so thex’e is no use putting in
moi'e coal than the machine can u&e.' You' are great, but being
told so should not act as an inhibition nor as an incentive. Since
you signed on voluntarily, and are staying on of your own free
will, don’t, give up the ship; but don’t rock the boat.

Editors, The Daily:
Next fall when we return to the familiar and informal grind,
few of us will be aware of the 150 foreign students who will be
new not only to the university but to the very form of life we
lead. These foreign students will experience that self-conscious
embarrassment which accompanies unfamiliarity and the search
for the proper way of doing things and of making a friend. A
friend to whom they can turn when they are perplexed or appre
hensive. Such a friend is a necessary adjunct to their entry into
our society and his understanding of it.
Unfortunately, the foreigner is handicapped by a natural
tendency to be slow and cautious in making human contacts. To
complicate things we are a fast people; fast-talking, fast-judging,
and fast-choosing friends.
For this reason the Foreign Student Pre-Reg Committee has
decided to request the help of students who will be living off
campus next fall. If you could accommodate one foreign student
from a world area that interests you, you would provide not only
a place for him to live, but also someone for him to turn to, at
no cost to yourself except in time and patience. And quite pos
sibly you would learn something worthwhile.
If you are willing to help, please sign your name and address
on the list in the UR Loft. You need not know your next year’s
residence, nor is this a commitment. The choice and the responsi
bility remain yours.
