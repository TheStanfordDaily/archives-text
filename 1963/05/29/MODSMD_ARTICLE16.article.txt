### ROGER MENDELSON 
The Dokes won the intramural
softball championship final last
night, 7-6, hut when the game
ended, Alpha Biz had the lying
run a mere five feet from home
plate.
On the last play of the game,
Alpha Biz’s Bob Wynn singled
sharply to center fielder Fred
Paidson on one bounce; he cut
loose a throw that was fielded by
catcher Jeff Gaylord five feet up
the third base line, at which point
Alpha Biz’s pitcher, Mike Hack
man, trying to score from second,
arrived simultaneously with the
ball; when the two players col
lided and Gaylord hung on to the
ball. Hackman was out.
THIS GAME contrasted sharp
ly with the tight, low-scoring
play of the playoff contests im
mediately preceding it. With
Deke pitcher Bill Young compara
tively wild and therefore forced
to come in with easy pitches
more often than usual and Hack
man serving up fat pitches all
night, there were 22 hits, four
walks, and eight errors, and the
score was tied three times.

What Hackman lacked on the
mound, he compensated for at the
plate, however. Twice his clutch
hitting tied the game, 2-2 on a
bases-loaded single in the fourth,
and 5-5 on a triple placed just in
side the right field foul line in the
fifth.
The winning runs scored un
spectacularly in the bottom of
the sixth on a miserable throw-in
from Alpha Biz center fielder
Bob Leland after a fly ball. Mar
tin Deggeller and Paulson, who
had singled for Deke, tagged up
on the fly with one out; when the
ball came in fifteen feet wide of
third, Deggeller continued home,
crashed into the catcher as he re
ceived the relay, and thus knock
ed the ball away; Paulson then
scored easily.
LELAND doubled for Alpha Biz
after one was out in the seventh,
moved to third on the error that
put Hackman, with the tying run,
on base, and scored Alpha Biz’s
sixth run on a fly; on that play,
the ball came all the way into
the plate, allowing Hackman to
go to second, from whence he was
thrown out a moment later.
