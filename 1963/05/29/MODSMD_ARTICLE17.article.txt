### OUR CRICKET CORRESPONDENT 
Cricket took another major step
towards an Intercollegiate level
when Stanford travelled to Cal
Tech in Pasadena Sunday. With
impressive wins over Cal, Cal at
Davis, and UCLA already. Stan
ford now swept the collegiate
series with yet another victory,
a 133-run margin, the biggest so
far. However, the outcome of the
match was never more Important
than the fact that i( was played
at all; for now, as far as the fu
ture of cricket was concerned, the
final link with .the Southland has
been established. 1

All along. Stanford played ex
ceptionally , colorful cricket, scor
ing quickly and steadily to pro
vide the huge crowd one of the
brightest games of the season.
Technically, only 3 Stanford bats
men were dismissed, the others
simply retired; but at 181, cap
tain Andrew Ma decided to end
the slaughter and declared his
side all out, giving the opposition
close to 3 hours to exceed that
total. Rut somehow, it just wasn’t
Cal Tech’s day.
FACING THE formidable task
of scoring 182 runs, Cal Tech de
cided it was Impossible and chose
instead to play defensively, hop

ing 1o force a draw when lime is
up. But Roger Levy, opening the
bowling for Stanford, hit a length
immediately, and had the bats
men pinned down.. Then Winston
Severn and Andrew Ma closed in,
and on throe occasions one or the
other literally picked the hall off
the bat to register a dismissal
when the batsmen played defens
ively.
Levy thrived on the batsmen’s
timidity and wickets fell one after
another. In sheer desperation.
Cal Tech hit out, but Stanford’s
superior defense never let up for
a moment; and when the Severn
brothers each made a spectacular
catch near the fence. Cal Tech
were all out lor only 4k, giving
Stanford a fantastic 133 runs vic
tory. Roger Levy was almost un
playable throughout and finished
with 6 wickets for only 16 runs, a
truly great performance.
