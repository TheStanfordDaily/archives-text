# Mural Track and Swimming Held
## Starless Sigma Chi Wins Mural Track 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Sigma Chi won its first and
very likely its only championship
in an intramural sport this spring
by taking the track title last Fri
day. University champs in 1961
and runners-up last year, Sigma
Chi perennially accumulates over
half its intramural points in
spring quarter. Hut so far this
spring, it has been eliminated
from softball, tennis, horseshoes,
and swimming, and stands little
chance to beat favored Theta Chi
in volleyball.
The track win, oddly enough,
was accomplished without a sin
gle first place by a Sigma Chi
competitor. Their 32 points, how
ever, resulted primarily from
four seconds and two thirds, and
comfortably topped Theta Chi’s
second-place total of 27. Kappa
Sig and Burbank tied for third
with 16 and AKL was fourth with
15.
BILL TLUSCH got eight points
for Sigma Chi with seconds in
the mile and 880, in which he
nearly overtook Theta Chi’s Den
nis Johnson with a great finish.
Frank Olrich was barely nosed
out in the 440 by AKL’s Pete Dill
(54.2-54.3) for another second;
Dave Osborne ran second in 120
low hurdles; and Bob Sommers
broad jumped 20-1 for their final
second place. Sandy Pofahl and
Chris Jessen took thirds in the
100 and shot put respectively.
Johnson led Theta Chi with
firsts in the 880 (2:05.2) and mile
(4:37.1), while Don Whitehill won
(he 100 (10.9) and finished second
in the 220 ( 24.5).
Kappa Sig’s big man was Mike
Walton, who tied a mural record
in winning the 70 high hurdles
(9.0) also won the 120 lows
(14.0) and took fifth in the broad
jump. Chuck Buehlor’s 49-7 Vs
shot put was also good for a first.
BURBANK got firsts from
Werner Boettcher in the broad
jump (20-312) and Dan Silva in
(he high jump (6-0), while AKL
depended on wins in the 880 re
lay, 440, and pole vault (12-9, by
Pyle), a new record.

The other first, not mentioned
above, was by Muir’s Simeon
Baldwin in the 220 (24.21.


CHUCK BUEHLER is best known for his feats on the football field,
but he is a good shot putter also. Last week, he won the intramural

(4:37.1), while Don Whitehill won
(he 100 (10.9) and finished second
in the 220 ( 24.5).
Kappa Sig’s big man was Mike
Walton, who tied a mural record
in winning the 70 high hurdles
(9.0) also won the 120 lows
(14.0) and took fifth in the broad
jump. Chuck Buehlor’s 49-7 Vs
shot put was also good for a first.
BURBANK got firsts from
Werner Boettcher in the broad
jump (20-312) and Dan Silva in
(he high jump (6-0), while AKL
depended on wins in the 880 re
lay, 440, and pole vault (12-9, by
Pyle), a new record.

The other first, not mentioned
above, was by Muir’s Simeon
Baldwin in the 220 (24.21.


CHUCK BUEHLER is best known for his feats on the football field,
but he is a good shot putter also. Last week, he won the intramural
16-pound shot put with a distance of 49-7½.
Sigma Chi won its first and
very likely its only championship
in an intramural sport this spring
by taking the track title last Fri
day. University champs in 1961
and runners-up last year, Sigma
Chi perennially accumulates over
half its intramural points in
spring quarter. Hut so far this
spring, it has been eliminated
from softball, tennis, horseshoes,
and swimming, and stands little
chance to beat favored Theta Chi
in volleyball.
The track win, oddly enough,
was accomplished without a sin
gle first place by a Sigma Chi
competitor. Their 32 points, how
ever, resulted primarily from
four seconds and two thirds, and
comfortably topped Theta Chi’s
second-place total of 27. Kappa
Sig and Burbank tied for third
with 16 and AKL was fourth with
15.
BILL TLUSCH got eight points
for Sigma Chi with seconds in
the mile and 880, in which he
nearly overtook Theta Chi’s Den
nis Johnson with a great finish.
Frank Olrich was barely nosed
out in the 440 by AKL’s Pete Dill
(54.2-54.3) for another second;
Dave Osborne ran second in 120
low hurdles; and Bob Sommers
broad jumped 20-1 for their final
second place. Sandy Pofahl and
Chris Jessen took thirds in the
100 and shot put respectively.
Johnson led Theta Chi with
firsts in the 880 (2:05.2) and mile
(4:37.1), while Don Whitehill won
