# Reports Useful for Counseling, Recommendations; Confidential

1 lu* finished reports are used several ways. Counseling is the
“overwhelming use” of the men’s reports, said Dean Larimer.
Dean Clark added tnat “the only real justification (of having
deans) is just to be on hand when a guy wants to come in and
talk. The reports are helpful because they are a judgment of

someone that knows the person.-
The women’s deans, on the
other hand, “don’t do depth coun
seling,” said Dean Avery, “al
though we refer and help when
we can—in a ‘first-aid’ capacity.”
Their reports are to aid the dorm
director and deans in knowing the
student, and to help in writing
recommendations. “If we don’t
personally know a girl, we say
so,” she continued. Instead of
completing a specific form sent
by a graduate school or potential
employer, the deans return a gen
eral view of the student made
from her records. No recommend
ations are writen after five years.
“WE DON’T WANT to’mold
anybody,” said Doan Allen.
“Sometimes if we know negative
things we just don’t say them.
The girl has probably outgrown
them,” she added; all you can
give is “the direction a person is
moving.”
All these reports are confiden
tial, the deans emphasized. An in
vestigator from, for example
the FBI, cannot look at them.
Dean Larimer said; instead the
deans will summarize informa
tion for him.
ONLY THE THREE women’s
deans read the women’s reports,
Doan Allen said. Since the men's
RA's are in a position to counsel,
they may read the reports, said
Dean Clark.
THE MEN’S REPORTS- kept
in the “credentials file”—are mi
crofilmed upon graduation, Dean
Larimer stated. The women’s—
not part of that file—are sum
marized, microfilmed, and the or
iginal records destroyed. “We
take constructive elements,” said
Dean Allen. Only in extreme cases
are negative items included, and
then they are put in “code,” added
Dean Avery.
One objection to the writing of
these reports is that they are too
subjective. An RA, though, coun
tered that “this is all right be
cause the people that use them

know their weaknesses and can
evaluate them.”
THE REPORTS are necessary
because “activity forms don’t tell
how effect he, how responsible” a
girl was, commented Dean Avery.
She added that these reports “are
not a secret, yet are not all im
portant.”
