# Davis Asks That Parts Of Article Be 'Retracted'
## 
### JANE SOKOLOW 
Jerry Davis, owner of World Travel Center in Palo Alto, read
a copy of a statement which he had sent to The Daily in a KZSU
interview yesterday. Davis objected to four main points regard
ing the coverage of the Aerovias Sud Americana (ASA) Charter
flights in The Daily on May 27 and asked for a “retraction” of

parts of the article. "
The four points are as follows:
• that he had been actively
participating in organizing the
flight:
• that he was withholding
funds that the airlines sent him
to distribute;
• that he was making a 15 per
cent commission, rather than the
legal 5 per cent;
• that The Daily implied the
charter flight was “mixed” and
that the passengers would all
be “bumped.”
Denying his active participa
tion, Davis explained why two
of the three phone numbers list
ed in the advertisements for the
flight were those of the World
Travel Center. Davis explained
that Steve Wordell, organizer of
★ ★ ★

the group taking the overseas
flight was in and out of the
Travel Center, and therefore, it
would be difficult for people to
reach him at home.
AS A RESULT, for convenience,
he was given a phone in the back
office, and when he was not
there, the Center took calls for
him, Davis said.
Furthermore, Davis said, com
menting on another issue, he was
not involved in advertising for
the group. Davis explained that
Wordell had asked him for a
charter and that as a member of
a Travel Agency, he had respond
ed to Wordell’s request.
Davis said he had set the char
ter up for Wordell and had help
ed show him how to advertise;
however, he added, “Wordell is
an advertising student.” The
steps followed a proper legal pro
cedure, Davis said, for each stu
dent signed an agreement with
Wordell. “They are bonafide,” he
said, their addresses and what
they do have been taken down.
DAVIS said that “there would
be no refund thirty days prior
to departure unless someone else
took the place of the person who
dropped out.” However, if the
flight was canceled, the whole
thing would be refunded, but, he
added, in such a case there are
other carriers which will trans
port the passengers. Commenting
further on the possibilities of re
funding, Davis said that the
money was in a trust fund under
the name of ASA Airlines at the
Bank of America in Los Angelos.
To withdraw from that trust
fund, two signatures are neces
sary, he said.
Davis answered the charge that
he had taken a 15 per cent com
mission by explaining that neces
sary costs, such as additional in
surance, advertising, personnel
help, transfers to London and to
Paris, were all included in the
price but that what was not
spent, was refunded.
THE FOURTH point objected
to was the statement which indi
cated that all the passengers on
an Air France flight had been
“bumped” when the flight was
canceled. Davis said, “It is not
true that the flight was ‘bump
ed.’ ” It went on schedule as con
tracted. If people were not bona
fide, the people, not the flight,
would have been canceled, he
said. The Daily’s statement “is
libelous to our program,” because
“it infers our pasengers will be
bumped, too.”
A news special on the question
of the charter flights will bo
broadcast tonight from 7-8 p.m.
on KZSU. 880 kc.
