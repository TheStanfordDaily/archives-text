The institution of grading has both tech
nical and Intangible purposes which seem to
root it inextricably in Stanford as well as in
other universities. There is, however, over
whelming opposition to the system from
students and educators, and, unlike many
other problems, there are concrete solutions
available.
The technical purposes of grading arc
primarily involved with transition; grades
provide objective means for undergraduate,
graduate, and transfer admissions as well as
providing the freshmen with a measurement
of their response to college work.
The intangible purpose for grading, as
Dr. Bernard Siegel, executive head of the
anthropology department, terms it, is to
provide “sit-down power’’ to do work. It in
troduces competition as a stimulus for learn
ing and gives Ihe student aregular reminder
of his work habits,
OF THE 17 EDUCATORS interviewed for

this series only two expressed support for
the grading system as it exists at Stanford.
Dr. George Harmon, assistant to the execu
tive head of the Biology Department, said
that the abolition of grades would reduce
student-faculty contact because students
would feel less pressure to attend classes.
Dr. Lauress Wise, Associate Dean of Engi
neering, defended grades because, he said,
"Everyone is going to have to be judged
competitively in this world."
Opposition to the grading system is based
primarily on the pressures which it places
on the student and teacher and the tendency
to distract both from the values of studying
the material. These pressures and distrac
tions are multiplied by the quarter system
at Stanford.
According to Dr. Philip Rhinelander, pro
fessor of philosophy, there is too much em
phasis on individual course grades. "The
great weakness of the American aducational
system is to identify learning with a course,’’
he said.
Dr. Wilfred Stone, professor of English,
maintains that grades divide learning into
episodes. “Education should be felt as cumu
lative rather than episodic; it should not be
something that causes so much pressure
periodically during the year that you look

forward to Christmas and spring vacations
as periods of relief after periods of great
struggle, anxiety, and exertion. Education
should be something w’hich is not tension
filled. but an enjoyable experience,” he said.
DR. NEVITT SANFORD, Director of the
Human Problems Study Institute, said that
if the University is confident that it has
selected good students, "it should maximize
their freedom after they get here.”
Others expressed concern over the petty
distinctions made between plus and minus
grades. If a student feels he will not get an
A he tends to lose Interest and slip by with
a B minus.

The grading curve evokes mixed feelings
among educators. According to Rhinelander,
the curve is "a nonsensical notion” especially
among students who have been selected for
their high caliber. Dr. Raymond Giraud,
acting head of the Department of French
and Italian, said he felt the curve was used
flexibly.
The flexibility of the curve does, however,
produce discrepancies among courses and
departments. Wise said that steeper grading
in the School of Engineering produces a
median grade for upper das engineering
courses that “is substantially below that of
the University.”

DB. SANFORD DORNBUBH, executive
head of the Sociology Department, also said
that freshman grades tended to be lower
than other classes” which reinforced the
freshmen’s concern over grades.
To counteract the technical problems in
volved in reforming the grading system,
Sanford suggested a comprehensive exami
nation given to all candidates for several
school from any school. This would eliminate
discrepancies among undergraduate grading
in different schools and would relieve the
dependence on the stereotyped worth of a
particular undergraduate school. Dornbush
proposed a moratorium on grades for fresh
men of at least one quarter while Stone
noted a similar moratorium already in effect
which allowed the freshmen to write their
first four themes without grades.
To eliminate the distracting pressure of
grades most of the educators proposed a
system similar to that of the European uni
versities. Stone suggested cumulative finals
at the end of the year with quarterly tests
as indicators and reviews without grades.
Rhinelander advocated comprehensive ex
aminations in the senior year with a syllabus
of general topics to be covered on the exam
to serve as a guide for the student in plan
nings his courses. Although Rhinelander ac

knowledged that this would entail a revision
of the majors program, he felt that the free
dom it would give the student to cover the
material either in course work or independ
ent reading was of prime importance.
Dr. Albert Hastorf, professor of psycholo
gy. suggested that a revision of grades to
honors, pass, and fail would at least relieve
the pettiness of grading.
Siegel emphasized the role of the tutorial
system in lessening grading pressures and at
the same time increasing student-teacher
contact.

Dr. John Black, director of the Counseling
and Testing Center, said, “The University
is still based on the assumption that you
have to threaten students with flunking out
to get work out of them. This is not true
here."

Black added that, as with grading, univer
sities should be more experimental with their
undergraduate programs. The well-selected
student body of the present is different from
the one for which older systems were found
ed. He added, “Compared with the radical
changes that are going on in secondary edu
cation, nothing is happening in higher edu
cation. The result is that we are getting
better-trained students from high school who
find nothing new here.’’

as indicators and reviews without grades.
Rhinelander advocated comprehensive ex
aminations in the senior year with a syllabus
of general topics to be covered on the exam
to serve as a guide for the student in plan
nings his courses. Although Rhinelander ac

knowledged that this would entail a revision
of the majors program, he felt that the free
dom it would give the student to cover the
material either in course work or independ
ent reading was of prime importance.
Dr. Albert Hastorf, professor of psycholo
gy. suggested that a revision of grades to
honors, pass, and fail would at least relieve
the pettiness of grading.
Siegel emphasized the role of the tutorial
system in lessening grading pressures and at
the same time increasing student-teacher
contact.

Dr. John Black, director of the Counseling
and Testing Center, said, “The University
is still based on the assumption that you
have to threaten students with flunking out
to get work out of them. This is not true
here."

Black added that, as with grading, univer
sities should be more experimental with their
undergraduate programs. The well-selected
student body of the present is different from
the one for which older systems were found
ed. He added, “Compared with the radical
changes that are going on in secondary edu
cation, nothing is happening in higher edu
cation. The result is that we are getting
better-trained students from high school who
find nothing new here.’’

The institution of grading has both tech
nical and Intangible purposes which seem to
root it inextricably in Stanford as well as in
other universities. There is, however, over
whelming opposition to the system from
students and educators, and, unlike many
other problems, there are concrete solutions
available.
The technical purposes of grading arc
primarily involved with transition; grades
provide objective means for undergraduate,
graduate, and transfer admissions as well as
providing the freshmen with a measurement
of their response to college work.
The intangible purpose for grading, as
Dr. Bernard Siegel, executive head of the
anthropology department, terms it, is to
provide “sit-down power’’ to do work. It in
troduces competition as a stimulus for learn
ing and gives Ihe student aregular reminder
of his work habits,
OF THE 17 EDUCATORS interviewed for

this series only two expressed support for
the grading system as it exists at Stanford.
Dr. George Harmon, assistant to the execu
tive head of the Biology Department, said
that the abolition of grades would reduce
student-faculty contact because students
would feel less pressure to attend classes.
Dr. Lauress Wise, Associate Dean of Engi
neering, defended grades because, he said,
"Everyone is going to have to be judged
competitively in this world."
Opposition to the grading system is based
primarily on the pressures which it places
on the student and teacher and the tendency
to distract both from the values of studying
the material. These pressures and distrac
tions are multiplied by the quarter system
at Stanford.
According to Dr. Philip Rhinelander, pro
fessor of philosophy, there is too much em
phasis on individual course grades. "The
great weakness of the American aducational
system is to identify learning with a course,’’
he said.
Dr. Wilfred Stone, professor of English,
maintains that grades divide learning into
episodes. “Education should be felt as cumu
lative rather than episodic; it should not be
something that causes so much pressure
periodically during the year that you look

forward to Christmas and spring vacations
as periods of relief after periods of great
struggle, anxiety, and exertion. Education
should be something w’hich is not tension
filled. but an enjoyable experience,” he said.
DR. NEVITT SANFORD, Director of the
Human Problems Study Institute, said that
if the University is confident that it has
selected good students, "it should maximize
their freedom after they get here.”
Others expressed concern over the petty
distinctions made between plus and minus
grades. If a student feels he will not get an
A he tends to lose Interest and slip by with
a B minus.

The grading curve evokes mixed feelings
among educators. According to Rhinelander,
the curve is "a nonsensical notion” especially
among students who have been selected for
their high caliber. Dr. Raymond Giraud,
acting head of the Department of French
and Italian, said he felt the curve was used
flexibly.
The flexibility of the curve does, however,
produce discrepancies among courses and
departments. Wise said that steeper grading
in the School of Engineering produces a
median grade for upper das engineering
courses that “is substantially below that of
the University.”

DB. SANFORD DORNBUBH, executive
head of the Sociology Department, also said
that freshman grades tended to be lower
than other classes” which reinforced the
freshmen’s concern over grades.
To counteract the technical problems in
volved in reforming the grading system,
Sanford suggested a comprehensive exami
nation given to all candidates for several
school from any school. This would eliminate
discrepancies among undergraduate grading
in different schools and would relieve the
dependence on the stereotyped worth of a
particular undergraduate school. Dornbush
proposed a moratorium on grades for fresh
men of at least one quarter while Stone
noted a similar moratorium already in effect
which allowed the freshmen to write their
first four themes without grades.
To eliminate the distracting pressure of
grades most of the educators proposed a
system similar to that of the European uni
versities. Stone suggested cumulative finals
at the end of the year with quarterly tests

the curve is "a nonsensical notion” especially
among students who have been selected for
their high caliber. Dr. Raymond Giraud,
acting head of the Department of French
and Italian, said he felt the curve was used
flexibly.
The flexibility of the curve does, however,
produce discrepancies among courses and
departments. Wise said that steeper grading
in the School of Engineering produces a
median grade for upper das engineering
courses that “is substantially below that of
the University.”

DB. SANFORD DORNBUBH, executive
head of the Sociology Department, also said
that freshman grades tended to be lower
than other classes” which reinforced the
freshmen’s concern over grades.
To counteract the technical problems in
volved in reforming the grading system,
Sanford suggested a comprehensive exami
nation given to all candidates for several
school from any school. This would eliminate
discrepancies among undergraduate grading
in different schools and would relieve the
dependence on the stereotyped worth of a
particular undergraduate school. Dornbush
proposed a moratorium on grades for fresh
men of at least one quarter while Stone
noted a similar moratorium already in effect
which allowed the freshmen to write their
first four themes without grades.
To eliminate the distracting pressure of
grades most of the educators proposed a
system similar to that of the European uni
versities. Stone suggested cumulative finals
at the end of the year with quarterly tests
as indicators and reviews without grades.
Rhinelander advocated comprehensive ex
aminations in the senior year with a syllabus
of general topics to be covered on the exam
to serve as a guide for the student in plan
nings his courses. Although Rhinelander ac

knowledged that this would entail a revision
of the majors program, he felt that the free
dom it would give the student to cover the
material either in course work or independ
ent reading was of prime importance.
Dr. Albert Hastorf, professor of psycholo
gy. suggested that a revision of grades to
honors, pass, and fail would at least relieve
the pettiness of grading.
Siegel emphasized the role of the tutorial
system in lessening grading pressures and at
the same time increasing student-teacher
contact.

Dr. John Black, director of the Counseling
and Testing Center, said, “The University
is still based on the assumption that you
have to threaten students with flunking out
to get work out of them. This is not true
here."

Black added that, as with grading, univer
sities should be more experimental with their
undergraduate programs. The well-selected
student body of the present is different from
the one for which older systems were found
ed. He added, “Compared with the radical
changes that are going on in secondary edu
cation, nothing is happening in higher edu
cation. The result is that we are getting
better-trained students from high school who
find nothing new here.’’

The institution of grading has both tech
nical and Intangible purposes which seem to
root it inextricably in Stanford as well as in
other universities. There is, however, over
whelming opposition to the system from
students and educators, and, unlike many
other problems, there are concrete solutions
available.
The technical purposes of grading arc
primarily involved with transition; grades
provide objective means for undergraduate,
graduate, and transfer admissions as well as
providing the freshmen with a measurement
of their response to college work.
The intangible purpose for grading, as
Dr. Bernard Siegel, executive head of the
anthropology department, terms it, is to
provide “sit-down power’’ to do work. It in
troduces competition as a stimulus for learn
ing and gives Ihe student aregular reminder
of his work habits,
OF THE 17 EDUCATORS interviewed for

this series only two expressed support for
the grading system as it exists at Stanford.
Dr. George Harmon, assistant to the execu
tive head of the Biology Department, said
that the abolition of grades would reduce
student-faculty contact because students
would feel less pressure to attend classes.
Dr. Lauress Wise, Associate Dean of Engi
neering, defended grades because, he said,
"Everyone is going to have to be judged
competitively in this world."
Opposition to the grading system is based
primarily on the pressures which it places
on the student and teacher and the tendency
to distract both from the values of studying
the material. These pressures and distrac
tions are multiplied by the quarter system
at Stanford.
According to Dr. Philip Rhinelander, pro
fessor of philosophy, there is too much em
phasis on individual course grades. "The
great weakness of the American aducational
system is to identify learning with a course,’’
he said.
Dr. Wilfred Stone, professor of English,
maintains that grades divide learning into
episodes. “Education should be felt as cumu
lative rather than episodic; it should not be
something that causes so much pressure
periodically during the year that you look

forward to Christmas and spring vacations
as periods of relief after periods of great
struggle, anxiety, and exertion. Education
should be something w’hich is not tension
filled. but an enjoyable experience,” he said.
DR. NEVITT SANFORD, Director of the
Human Problems Study Institute, said that
if the University is confident that it has
selected good students, "it should maximize
their freedom after they get here.”
Others expressed concern over the petty
distinctions made between plus and minus
grades. If a student feels he will not get an
A he tends to lose Interest and slip by with
a B minus.
