The past school year has been an extremely productive
and significant one for Stanford. Physical surroundings, gen
eral policy, and attitudes toward and within the University
have undergone fantastic changes.

New buildings are springing up in every corner of the
campus, symbolized by Tresidcler Memorial Union on one
hand, dedicated to enriching the social and cultural interests
of students, and Varian Physics Laboratory on the other,
dedicated to an increasing understanding of the ways of sci
ence. The new fraternity clusters—significant not only as
buildings but as symbols of the new role of fraternities in
University life—have appeared. Plans for the sorely needed
Undergraduate Library are finally progressing, and the new
Student Publications Building is scheduled for completion in
February,
As the outside world begins to notice the emergence of
Stanford as a “great” University, the members of the Uni
versity community are becoming increasingly aware of the
world around them, and are beginning to recognize their roles
and responsibilities within that world.
The most important advance made this year has been in
the increased mutual respect and understanding between the
Administration and the students. Attitudes have changed on
both sides. Students have been given a greater role in Univer
sity matters, being included on University committees and
policy boards. A sincere effort has been made by the Admin
istration to ascertain the feelings of students, which is recip
rocated on the students' parts by increasing feelings of re
sponsibility for their own actions and respect for the decisions
of the Administration.
Students and Administration have both begun to under
stand that they are working for a common goal—the improve
ment of an already fine University—and that time, energy, and
continued efforts toward cooperation are necessary for this
goal to succeed.
