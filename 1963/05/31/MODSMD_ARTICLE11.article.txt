Editors, The Dally:
Concern for expression of opinion and for participation in
decisions which directly affect the Stanford community seems
both strong and valid. Many students and faculty, while dis
agreeing with the ends of the Peace Caucus vigilers, neverthe
less supported the vigil as a legitimate means of expressing
their interests and effectively bringing pressure upon the ad
ministration for public discussion. Stanford finally discarded its
apathy and recognized the real responsibility of a community.
But this responsibility can not and should not end at Stan
ford. Sit-in demonstrations, protest marches against segregation,
and pickets of housing developments which practice racial dis
crimination are an obvious analogy to the vigils which were
conducted here. Regardless of whether one agrees with the end
of eliminating discrimination, these means should be supported
as legitimate ones in bringing pressure upon private groups and
government for social change. The arrests of non-violent demon
strators, for whatever legal pretext, should be condemned as
vociferously as the right to vigil was supported. Only then can it
be shown that we have learned from our experience of the last
few months.

Editors, The Daily;
Isn’t it time respectable members of the faculty and admin
istration joined with the student body in protesting the irrespon
sible behavior of Professors Rozsak, Ruotolo, and Stone? In
every school in which I have taught these types of un-hip teach
ers have made themselves intolerable, lousing things up with
their irrational determination to make students think. Why
must they get so personal and buck the immutable traditions of
academic life, bringing their children and automobiles into con
flict with healthy young American manhood’s virility and in
tegrity (and young American womanhood’s, too; let’s not forget
school is here to make everybody mature)? The history of
American education amply demonstrates that such characters
always come to a bad end. Come on, fellows; wise up! Stop pick
ing on innocent fraternity boys! Concentrate on your research!
Publish those articles undergraduates never read! Let the stu
dents alone! Fill your lectures with articulate platitudes readily
convertible into recognizable questions on final exams and ap
proved of in scratch sheets! What are you trying to do, make a
real university?
