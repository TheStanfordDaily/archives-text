Dear Mr. James A. Dull:
(Editors’ note: The following is a letter from Provost Ter
man in answer to the report on the Stanford grading system
submitted by the Class of 1964.)
Through Dr. Wert I have seen a copy of the report on the
Stanford grading system by the Executive Committee of the
Class of 1964. I have of course also seen the account that ap
peared in the Stanford Daily for May 22.
1 was interested in the work that your committee has done,
because the grading pattern has been a matter of concern to
this office. Since I became Provost in 195!> we have twice made
surveys of grade distribution in the entire university.
It is widely assumed that the “curve” is rigidly followed at
Stanford, but except for certain freshmen and other elementary
courses taken by large numbers of students, this is far from the
case. Our most recent survey covers the years 1960-61, and an
IBM tabulation showed that when one pools all grades given
throughout the university the GPA was 2.71 for courses with
lower division numbers, and 2.98 for courses with upper division
numbers. This is in contrast with a grade point average of about
2.40 to 2.45 (depending upon the number of failures and +
grades) that would result if one followed the curve.
It is particularly illuminating to tabulate the distribution
of A, B, and C grades actually given:
Lower Division Upper Division
A 23% 34%
B 45 41
C 32 25
Total 100% 100%
You will note that the actual distribution of grades in upper
division courses is somewhat more generous than that recom
mended by your group. In lower division courses, even when
one includes the freshman and other large elementary courses
where the grading is by the curve, the number of B and A grades
taken together is slightly higher than the student recommenda
tion, but the proportion of A grades is less than you have pro
posed with the number of B grades correspondingly larger.
On the basis of the above information it would appear that
the grading pattern that now actually exists at Stanford is not
unduly harsh on the students. Certainly, on the average it gives
the student a more impressive record than would be achieved
by distributing upper division grades more equally between A,
B, and C.

Loose statements are often made implying that other schools
have made drastic changes in their grade distribution because of
better students, and that Stanford is out of step. Some years ago
1 was concerned about this possibility, and in 1959 wrote letters
to Cornell, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale inquiring as to their
situation. Dean Brown of Princeton in response stated that
"Our studies indicate no significant shift in the proportion of
high and low grades in recent years, even though we know that
the students are more highly qualified and are doing better
work.” Similar statements were received from Harvard and
Cornell, while Yale gave data on their current grade distribution
but did not answer as to how this compared with earlier periods.
Since it is clear that you are earnestly attempting to give
constructive thought to matters of concern to students, I am
sure that you will find the above information helpful to your
understanding of this matter. Also I am sure that you will be
glad to know that the administrative officers of the university
give continuing attention to such matters as grade distribution.
Sincerely,
F. E. Terman

Editors, The Daily:
I was surprised that you chose to print the uninformed,
unreasonable polemics of Professor Will Stone in yesterday’s
paper. I, and many other students, resent his proceeding to
slander Stanford students and to single out one segment of that
group on the flimsiest of evidence, revealing little more than a
prejudiced mind.
There are several aspects of the several problems which he
presents in his statement which I believe warrant consideration:
1. He overlooks the fact that his beloved Stern houses also
hold parties from which “crowds of drunken students return,”
and the members of those houses have been known to exhibit
a singular lack of self-discipline and self-government. I make
this statement on the basis of personal experience.
2. Stanford fraternities are entirely self-governed and man
aged, responsible to no dormitory authorities, and are on the
whole careful to maintain discipline among their own members
through their own systems of enforcement.
3. The vandalism described happened near Wilbur, Stern
and Toyon. If it W'as perpetrated by fraternity pledges, Profes
sor Stone will have to provide more tangible evidence in order
to secure a hearing which will prompt student action.
4. Theft and similar vandalism has occurred on the prem
ises of fraternity houses, with considerable loss to fraternity
men. There is no evidence to support the contention that this
was committed by members of the Stanford community.
If Professor Stone honestly believes that the extreme de
struction which he describes is attributable to Stanford students,
or, as he implies, to Stanford fraternity men, let him keep silent
until some evidence to that effect has been gained through police
investigation, and then cry out for student action. Such specu
lation as he indulges in will not command the respect and ad
miration of students, and a witchhunt against fraternities will
not inspire faith in the Honor Cpde or Fundamental Standard-
Action Will follow evidence, not invbctive, Phffessfor? " 1 " ’ 1

Gullibility is probably the bain of all freshmen, and I am
quite likely exposing nothing to worldly upperclassmen. But
strangely enough, I still feel compelled to write this rather
Tate protest. The Campus Bike Shop has the unique advantage
of being situated on campus. This makes it the most easily
accessible establishment where most students can buy bikes
and have them repaired. If ethics do not compel the owner of the
shop to a policy of honesty, then one would hope that such a
privilege extended by Stanford University would. And yet, this
Monday afternoon I found that not so.
In fall quarter, I soon tired of being late to class and deter
mined to purchase a bicycle. Owing to the early rush, the Cam
pus Bike Shop had but two used bikes left (The Paly stores were
sold out). For a bike with one hand brake, poor repainting, and
imperceptible gears I had to pay $35 plus $3.75 for a basket plus
tax. But I was assured that I would get "half-price back at the
end of the year” because of the college demand. Last Monday,
the same man offered me $lO resale. When I mentioned that the
bike was in practically the same condition as when I bought it
and that he would make quite a profit on it in the fall, he said,
“That’s business.” Then I offered to repaint the bike myself if
he would give me the half-price promised last September. The
gentleman replied that that was only for bike in a certain con
dition. He continued, "The stores in town will only give ten dol
lars, why should I give more?” I reiterate; my bike has deteri
orated only in paint and a kickstand, both of which I offered to
remedy.
Such a situation is personally reprehensible. My bike may
actually be worth only $lO now, but in that case, it certainly was
not worth $4O eight months ago. "Business” may be interpreted
many disparate ways, but on the Stanford University campus,
it would seem to require the translation “honesty.” A monopoly
does not have to extract exorbitant profits. That gentleman has
been extended a privilege. It is regrettable that he does not have
the integrity to live up to it.

Editors, The Daily:
Although I am in basic agreement with Prof. Wilfred
Stone’s letter concerning the vandalism of Prof. Ruotolo’s car,
I object to his implication that this vandalism was due to fra
ternity parties. I would also question the accuracy of the state
ment "... and crowds of drunken students were coming home
from fraternities.”
Prof. Stone's fanatical contempt for fraternities has been
exhibited repeatedly through the years. While 1 do not attempt
to justify or endorse some of the behavior on the row, I do not
feel that fraternities should be implicated in this Wilbur prob
lem.
