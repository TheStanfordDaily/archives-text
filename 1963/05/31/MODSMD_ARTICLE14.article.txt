# Rosencranz's Concluding Address
## 
### ARMIN’ ROSENCRANZ 
ASSU President
(Editors’ note: Rosencranz’s
speech, of which flic following is
a complete text, was presented
last night at the ASSU “Farewell"
banquet)
At the opening service in Me
morial Church last fall, I read
the lesson from the book of Ec
clesiastes; “To everything there
is a season and a time to every
purpose under the heaven:
a time to be born and a time
to die;
a time to plant and a time to
pluck up that which is planted;
a time to kill and a time to heal;
a time to break down and a time
to build up;
a time to weep and a lime to
laugh;
a time to mourn and a time to
dance;
a time to cast away stones and
a time to gather stones together;
a time to embrace and a time
to refrain from embracing;
a lime to get and a time to lose;
a time to keep and a time to
cast away;
a time to rend and a time to
sew;
a time to keep silence and a
time to speak,”
Those words seem singularly
relevant today. Last year at this
time was the time to laugh, and
laugh we did. We spoofed stu
dent government and its proposi
ties. When the now year began
we became earnest and the laugh
ter subsided. Now, at the close
of the year, few things seem
laughable and that worries me.
It is fortunate that the year is at
an end because if indeed we
should lose our capacity to laugh
at ourselves, we will have ap
proached the point of diminishing
returns.
LOOKING BACK over the year
it is hard not to feel some satis
faction in what has boon accom
plished. We called for the free
dom to participate in University
decision-making and we have seen
the beginning of such participa
tion, with students represented
on ten University committees. We
called for the freedom to govern
our own non-academic lives and
we have seen these views given
respectful attention on the part of
those who heretofore had rarely
thought of the University in any
role other than In loco parentis.
We called for complete freedom
of expression both for those with
in the University community and
those who are invited here to use
the University as a forum. The
recent redefinition of University
policy toward partisan political
and sectarian religious activity
has removed most of the re
straints on student expression;
and no proposed speaker or pro
posed program has been denied
a platform. The latter, of course,
is attributable more to a watch
ful faculty than a zealous student
body.
Finally we called for the free
dom to emerge from the apathy
and lethargy that has bound this
campus and has kept us from as
suming our rightful place in the
American and world student com
munities. Here too we can feel
that progress has been made in
recent months.
We have questioned and some
times attacked the notion of im
posing as many restraints as the
traffic will bear, rather than
maintaining only the few rules
necessary for an ordered society.

We have urged that all informa
tion regarding university policies
and decisions be made available
unless secrecy is vital. We have
been told that, “You can’t run a
university by debate,” and vve
have answered that that is the
only way a great university can
be run.
WE APPEAR to have accom
plished our goals largely because
we have not set those goals very
high. These are the things we
have not done: We have not, ex
cept through the Scratch Sheet,
made any vigorous attempt to in
fluence the curriculum and teach
ing standards.
We have not persistently chal
lenged the prevailing "don’t rock
the boat" tone of the University.
We let ourselves coexist peace
fully with attitudes of intolerance
of disagreement, instead of crying
out our indignation at them.
While asserting the dignity and
integrity of our positions, we have
not made a great effort really to
understand the attitudes of some
members of the administration
with whom we have come in con
flict. Rarely have we tried to put
ourselves in the President’s shoes
and see the situation as ho might
see it. Until recently, I had
greatly underappreciated the
tolerance of a tradition-bound ad
ministration and undergraduate
body which, with a minimum of
protest, allowed an outsider, a
graduate student, to plunge into
the center of student life, gather
around him many of the ablest
students, and influence the course
of student affairs for a year.
Although our stands might well
have been undermined by these
considerations, we can surely not
claim that we have approached
our endeavors with either com
passion or humility. That, I be
lieve, is unfortunate.
MANY OF YOU have heard me
say, on numerous occasions, that
any criticisms which we have
leveled against the University
have l*een predicated on the as
sumption that Stanford is one of
tlie finest universities in the na
tion. If this were not so, we
would have found ourselves cry
ing in the wilderness and heard
by no one. Precisely because we
believe in Stanford's greatness,
we have faith that tomorrow It
can be even greater.
Recently President Sterling told
student leaders that ho was not
encouraged by the direction of
student government this year
it has diverted student attention
from areas traditional to student
government. If the President is
referring to traditions such as
Freshmen Convocation, or Spring
Sing, or Baccalauratc Sunday, or
even the Axe—these are fine,
beautiful traditions; I would re
gret their passing as much as the
President. These things too are
Stanford, just as is the spirit of
inquiry that we have sometimes
found so elusive.
BUT IF the President means
the traditional lack of concern on
the part of student government
for the world about us, —lack of
concern with suffering and depri
vation and issues of social .justice
that are the hurning issues of our
time—then I say, with Ecclesi
astes, that there is a time to plant
and a time to pluck up that which
is planted; a time to keep and a
time to cast away: I would say it
is high time to divert attention
from those areas.

There is a time to keep silence

and a time to speak: This year
was the time to speak. But it is
only the beginning: The dialogue
between students and adminis
tration, and between students and
the larger community, must con
tinue and must increase even
when it is unpopular to speak;
even when our speaking is labeled
“immature and irresponsible”;
even when the questions we raise
in what we feel to be the best
interests of the University and
the student body are construed
by some as condemnation of the
University.
I hope you all are as gratified
as I am that here at Stanford we
have, for the most part, an en
vironment alive enough intellectu
ally for the questions to be raised.
We must be careful, however,
to have before us what the Law
calls an “actual case of contro
versy.” It would infinitely weaken
our position if we were to go out
looking for issues with which to
challenge intransigent University
officials, much less to raise such
issues for the sake of harrass
ment.
ONE THING lias become clear
this year: If there has been any
sort of revolution it Is a Revolu
tion of the Moderates. We as
sumed always that we were deal
ing with reasonable men, even if
at times some of us wondensl
whether that assumption was re
ciprocated. We asked for. and to
some extent succeeded in attain
ing only those rights and privi
leges which any great institution
of learning would accord its stu
dents conununity. Perhaps that
is why our efforts have been sup
ported by the large majority of
the student body; perhaps that is
why both candidates in the recent
ASSU election endorsed this year’s
“activism.”
It is heartening to see that ours
is the majority view. But we
should not be smug about it, nor
should we be appalled at the ac
tivities of the vocal minorities—
the so-called extremists those
on the fringe. Many of the people
who made this country great
started out on the fringe and we
are all well aware that some of
the “radicals” of today will bo the
moderates of tomorrow.
THIS YEAR we were not always
certain that the majority was on
our side, but this did not cause us
to slacken our efforts. If one ac
cepts a role of leadership, it is his
duty to lead and hope that others
will follow, rather than do only
what is popular.
This student generation will
someday be running all the gov
ernments of the world. We have, a
unique advantage over our prede
cessors because it Is abundantly
clear to us, as it may not have
been to them, that men are cap
able of monumental inhumanity
toward one another. We saw this
during the Second World War;
we see it In those nations living
under Communism and other
totalitarian systems; we see It in
colonial Africa; and most poig
nent of all, we see it here in our
own country.
Wo also sec the dignity of ac
tion and of non-violent resistance
to this tyranny and inhumanity.
It is becoming increasingly ap
parent that every individual can
contribute to the relief of the in
justice and oppression that sur
rounds him. It is becoming in
creasingly apparent also that
every individual is judged by his
actions and by his commitment.
The issues of social justice must
bo met, and the sensitive and
aware student must do what he
can to meet them. There is so
much to do and so little time in
which to do it. We must be car
ried along on the crest of our en
thusiasm and our zeal during
these few years that we have be
fore complacency sets in.
IF WE PURSUE this commit
ment we may be able to transcend
our own inhumanity. There will
be no time to go out to the lulls
and act with animalistic abandon.
Tlie struggle against ignorance,
intolerance; the struggle for the
dignity of all men will take all
our lime.
Some of this work must wait
until we complete our education.
Some of it can be done right here
and now through letters, mone
tary and moral support of such
organizations as the Congress on
Racial Equality, and sometimes
oven through vigils and pickets.
Permit me to modify somewhat
the text of Ecclesiastes: there is
a time to speak and a time to act.
For this student generation, here
at Stanford and elsewhere in
America an d throughout the
world, the time has surely come
not only to speak but to act.
“What profit,” Ecclesiastes asks,
“hath he that worketh in that
wherein he laboureth?” Often this
year, in various forms, I have
asked myself that question. It is
the profit of learning about hu
man nature and human relation
ships as much as about govern
ment; it is the profit of the friend
ship and fellowship that has come
to us who have joined together in
a common effort; it is the profit
of coming to know and respect
those many members of the fac
ulty with whom we have worked
so closely this year, and also
those administrators in whom we
have placed our trust and who
have returned this trust; and fin
ally, it is the profit that comes
from doing w'hat little any one of
us can toward making our society
—the University and the world
beyond it—better than it other
wise might be.
