# Lengthy Rush Expensive; Allows More Time for Decision
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
The new rush system has allowed freshmen to make a wiser
living-group decision hut is more time consuming and expensive
to the fraternities and clubs.
These are the unanimous opinions of representatives of the
administration, freshman men, fraternities and clubs. Beyond this

initial agreement, there is dispute
as to the values of having an ex
tended rush.
The new rush policy was for
mulated last fall and represents
the first time the four groups
concerned all had a say and the
first time one uniform policy has
been in use.
APPOINTED by Dean of Men
David Larimer and ASSU Presi
dent Armin Rosencranz, the com
mittee consisted of Ed Eschbach
and Mike Hammer of the Inter-
Fraternity Council; Frank Wal
lace, president of the Inter-Club
Council; Pat Shue, representing
Stern; and John Steinbruner,
head Wilbur sponsor.
The formation of the new 7 pol
icy committee w 7 as the result of
dissatisfaction with the old pol
icy. Three times last year the
IFC voted down new policies, but
it had expressed the opinion that
it did want a new policy.
Reactions to the results of the
new policy vary.
Dwight Clark, Doan of Fresh
man Men, feels the extended
rush “gave freshman men more
opportunity to make a wise choice
in a less pressured atmosphere.”
He thinks choices this year were
made in a more reasonable, ra
tional way.
IFC PRESIDENT Don Haider
expressed the opinion that the
policy allowed a greater amount
of rationality both in choice of
system and choice of individual
unit within that system.
He feels, however, that the fra
ternities are opposed to the sev

.4
enlh week rush and states that
most pledge classes were nearly
completed after two weeks. Hai
der feels “many adjustments will
have to bo made before the pol
icy Is compatible to the fraterni
ties.”
Fraternity rush reactions, sum
marized in the results of a ques
tionnaire given by IFC rush
chairman Marco Magnano, were
that there was added cost and
time, and consequent threat to
grades. The opinion was express
i ed that; there was difficulty in
: sustaining rush. The question
, naire also showed there was an
unfamiliarity with the new 7 rules
and consequently full advantage
on off-campus contact was not
- taken.
ICC PRESIDENT Frank Wal
lace sees the new policy as the
first step to a “more mature, less
rectic” rush system. The new pol
: icy, he fcls, gives the overall
structure neded to coordinate
■ rush.
I “Too much time is now being
1 given to it. It’s not that impor
: tant.” He objects to the seven
’ w 7 eek extension and the lack of
1 j off-campus contact, and feels the
- present system is “selective too
soon.” He looks for a shortening
• of rush in the future.
■ “Definitely better” is Head Wil-
I bur Sponsor John Steinbruner’s
’ j opinion of the policy. He thinks
1 |it permits “more discerning eval
uation” and allow's continuation
■ j of relationships between men in
■ i Wilbur Hall.
