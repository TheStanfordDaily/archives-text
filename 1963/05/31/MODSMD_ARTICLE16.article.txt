## 
### 
(Editors’ note: The following is the statement by the Civil Aero- ]
amities Board in Washington referring to the petition by Aerovias!
sud Americana hi the CAB requesting permission to fly transatlan
tic passenger flights. The following is a transcribed copy taken from
a tape which was recorded on the telephone Wednesday afternoon,
May 39. Farts of the statement as it appears here may not be
exactly correct because of errors which may have occurred in tran
scription.
The first paragraph of the statement states llial a Certified
Carrier of Cargo, such as ASA, must file for a special order in order
to conduct transatlantic flights.
The following begins with the second paragraph of the state
ment from CAB. Footnotes by the CAB on the Board's action have
been noted with asterisks.)
On May 22, 19G3, ASA filed with the Board an application for
such a special order authorizing them to perform unlimited pro-rata,
mixed, and single entity charter transatlantic passenger charters
between June 8 and September 30, 1963. ASA simultaneously filed
a motion requesting . . , file this application less than 45 days prior
to the first proposed flight, alleging that its failure to file in the
time provided by Section 295.5 of the Economic Regulations ‘‘was
inadvertent and attributable to misunderstanding between the carrier
and its counsel”: and that no interested party would be prejudiced
by the filing of the motion.
In support of this application for special order, ASA alleges,
among other things, that it has entered into contracts for not less
than 20 round trip transatlantic passenger charters, the first of which
is scheduled on Juno 8, 1963; that it has the necessary aircraft,
capital, trust accounts arrangements, screening provisions for eli
gibility, and arrangements for representation abroad; that it has
appropriate tariff on file with the Board; that it has had prior ex
perience in the performance of charters; and that its future depends
in part on successful commercial operation. The Board, upon con
sideration of this application and motion, !!! and all pertinent circum-

* While explanation given for filing the application loss than 45
days prior to the first proposed flight might well bo construed
as an inadequate one, the Board has decided to grant the motion
for him to tile. By letter of February 19, 1963, the Board . . .
reminded Aerovias of the status of its authority with respect
to transatlantic passenger charters in the forthcoming season.
By letter of April 4, 1963, the President of ASA acknowledged
this letter and noted also the recent issuance of the amendments
of Part 207 which indicated how such authority could be sought.
Thus it is clear the Aerovias was fully aware of the necessities
for filing for such authority and had the knowledge fully in
advance of the 45-day period.

stances, has decided to dismiss the application. Section 295.5 (a)
provides that: “applications may be filed only by carriers which are
applicants in good standing for transatlantic charters overseas.”
In transatlantic charter investigation docket 11908, instituted by
Board Order E-16023 November 14; 1960. “Although ASA was an
applicant in this investigation, its application therein was dismissed
by Order E-18349, adopted May 9, 1962. Thus it is not eligible to
apply for the authority in question nor does its application in any
way offer an explanation as to why it might be construed as eligible
despite its failure to abide-by the requirements contained in 295.5
tat.” The applicatoin will therefore be dismissed.*

* Although the matter of ASA's compliance with other require
ments of part 295 is not reached, certain problems in this re
gard should be noted. ASA has no past experience in the trans
atlantic civil passenger market. Moreover, its financial reports
filed with the Board indicate that its ability to meet the test of
financial fitness for this particular type of program might bo
questioned.

Accordingly, it is ordered: that the application of ASA in
Docket 14514 be and is hereby dismissed.
By order of the Civil Aeronautics Board:
