# 'Revolution' of Moderates Hailed at ASSU Dinner
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Associate Editor 
At a “farewell banquet yesterday evening were gathered the
student leaders, faculty and members of the Administration who
have effected and viewed a “revolution” this year in the emphasis
ol student government at Stanford University.
And the words of keynote speakers Annin Rosencranz, out

going ASSU president. Bud We
din, incoming ASSU president,
and assistant professor of politi
cal science Charles Drekmeier
represented the new voicing of a
vibrant educational philosophy.
THE ROSENCRANZ farewell
address provided an evaluation, a
summary, and a vision of student
government. Beginning with a ci
tation from Ecclesiastes (“ . . . a
time to keep silent and a time to
speak . . . ”) he stated, “Precise
ly because we believe in Stan
ford’s greatness, we have faith

that tomorrow it can be even
greater.”
The President's address was a
somewhat Socratic dialogue with
the University. At one point he
stated, “Wo have been told. ‘You
can't run a University by debate,’
and we have answered that that
is the only way a groat University
can bo run.”
Drekmeier began his address
by quoting Eve’s words to Adam
as they left the Garden: “‘My
dear, we live in an age of trans
ition.’ Stanford is in this age of
transition, always has been and
probably always will be, since it
is not likely that trustees, alum
ni, students, faculty, and admin
istration are always going to be
satisfied with the same things.”

THE POLITICAL theorist went
on to say, “One does not have to
be particularly discerning to de
tect the several ghosts that lurk
in the arcades of inner Quad
rangle. There is the ghost of
Stanford past, the ghost of a
time when learning was an attri
bute that certain people were ex
pected to have.
“Then there is the ghost of
Stanford today and probably to
morrow. Learning is justified in
different ways primarily by

practical achievement. The “new”
student has to create himself. Ac
tions are no longer the simple
manifestations of what we are;
they constitute our very identity.”
Drekmeier analyzed. “Most col
leges are simply preparing young
people to earn a living. But I
think wo at Stanford wish to pro
duce thinkers, and by this we
mean something other than mere
collectors of ideas. It is impor
tant to understand that problems
that are studied are themselves
created by man’s attempts to
achieve certain things. Our world
makes sense in so far as it sug
gests to us possibilities of action.

“UNFORTUNATELY many
scholars today seek to relieve
themselves of responsibility by
arguing that they have no control
over the world which they have
actually in their own studies cre
ated. They refuse to attach a
meaning to the past a meaning
which can give us a sense of di
rection and a sense of limit.”
The professor concluded by not
ing, “The University is a collec
tion of mutual responsibilities—
and our major difficulty would
seem to be that wo do not really
demand enough from one an
other.”
Wed in opened his remarks by
recalling. “When President Ster
ling addressed the Freshman
Class in 1961, he said that the
great prerogative of a private
university was not the freedom of
speech or of expression, but rath
er the freedom to experiment. It
was in this context (hat those of
us present entered Stanford Uni
versity.”

THE INCOMING president saw
“two levels of interpretation” in
Sterling’s statement: the freedom
of the university “to be responsi
ble only to itself,” and “the stu
dent right to freedom of experi
| mentation.” Wedin felt that the
latter “acquires a definition of
‘freedom within a defined frame
work.’ But when student action
land concern arise in areas that
I He outside the delegated frame
work. its true nature is revealed
i in an interesting and obvious ir
rationality: the delegated frame
work does not reflect the particu
| lar concerns and interests of the
student community; instead, the
student community must adjust
i these concerns and interest to the
(existing framework ... it is
j these very areas outside the tra
ditional sphere of student action
i in which students can make the
(most meaningful contribution to
! Stanford.”
He closed in stating, “It is in
this tradition that wo should con
j stantly question and probe, eval
j uatc and change. We should hold
nothing right until proven; noth
! ing wrong until tested.”
Rosencranz concluded the eve
ning with a special thanks to his
fellow officers, faculty friends,
student affairs committee. Presi
dent Sterling and the Board of
Trustees, GRIP, LASSU . and
“particularly Miss Aten, ASSU of
fice manager, who is retiring af
ter 36 years of faithful and de
voted service to the Associated
Students."

The President's address was a
somewhat Socratic dialogue with
the University. At one point he
stated, “Wo have been told. ‘You
can't run a University by debate,’
and we have answered that that
is the only way a groat University
can bo run.”
Drekmeier began his address
by quoting Eve’s words to Adam
as they left the Garden: “‘My
dear, we live in an age of trans
ition.’ Stanford is in this age of
transition, always has been and
probably always will be, since it
is not likely that trustees, alum
ni, students, faculty, and admin
istration are always going to be
satisfied with the same things.”

THE POLITICAL theorist went
on to say, “One does not have to
be particularly discerning to de
tect the several ghosts that lurk
in the arcades of inner Quad
rangle. There is the ghost of
Stanford past, the ghost of a
time when learning was an attri
bute that certain people were ex
pected to have.
“Then there is the ghost of
Stanford today and probably to
morrow. Learning is justified in
different ways primarily by

practical achievement. The “new”
student has to create himself. Ac
tions are no longer the simple
manifestations of what we are;
they constitute our very identity.”
Drekmeier analyzed. “Most col
leges are simply preparing young
people to earn a living. But I
think wo at Stanford wish to pro
duce thinkers, and by this we
mean something other than mere
collectors of ideas. It is impor
tant to understand that problems
that are studied are themselves
created by man’s attempts to
achieve certain things. Our world
makes sense in so far as it sug
gests to us possibilities of action.

“UNFORTUNATELY many
scholars today seek to relieve
themselves of responsibility by
arguing that they have no control
over the world which they have
actually in their own studies cre
ated. They refuse to attach a
meaning to the past a meaning
which can give us a sense of di
rection and a sense of limit.”
The professor concluded by not
ing, “The University is a collec
tion of mutual responsibilities—
and our major difficulty would
seem to be that wo do not really
demand enough from one an
other.”
Wed in opened his remarks by
recalling. “When President Ster
ling addressed the Freshman
Class in 1961, he said that the
great prerogative of a private
university was not the freedom of
speech or of expression, but rath
er the freedom to experiment. It
was in this context (hat those of
us present entered Stanford Uni
versity.”

THE INCOMING president saw
“two levels of interpretation” in
Sterling’s statement: the freedom
of the university “to be responsi
ble only to itself,” and “the stu
dent right to freedom of experi
| mentation.” Wedin felt that the
latter “acquires a definition of
‘freedom within a defined frame
work.’ But when student action
land concern arise in areas that
I He outside the delegated frame
work. its true nature is revealed
i in an interesting and obvious ir
rationality: the delegated frame
work does not reflect the particu
| lar concerns and interests of the
student community; instead, the
student community must adjust
i these concerns and interest to the
(existing framework ... it is
j these very areas outside the tra
ditional sphere of student action
i in which students can make the
(most meaningful contribution to
! Stanford.”
He closed in stating, “It is in
this tradition that wo should con
j stantly question and probe, eval
j uatc and change. We should hold
nothing right until proven; noth
! ing wrong until tested.”
Rosencranz concluded the eve
ning with a special thanks to his
fellow officers, faculty friends,
student affairs committee. Presi
dent Sterling and the Board of
Trustees, GRIP, LASSU . and
“particularly Miss Aten, ASSU of
fice manager, who is retiring af
ter 36 years of faithful and de
voted service to the Associated
Students."

Stanford past, the ghost of a
time when learning was an attri
bute that certain people were ex
pected to have.
“Then there is the ghost of
Stanford today and probably to
morrow. Learning is justified in
different ways primarily by

practical achievement. The “new”
student has to create himself. Ac
tions are no longer the simple
manifestations of what we are;
they constitute our very identity.”
Drekmeier analyzed. “Most col
leges are simply preparing young
people to earn a living. But I
think wo at Stanford wish to pro
duce thinkers, and by this we
mean something other than mere
collectors of ideas. It is impor
tant to understand that problems
that are studied are themselves
created by man’s attempts to
achieve certain things. Our world
makes sense in so far as it sug
gests to us possibilities of action.

“UNFORTUNATELY many
scholars today seek to relieve
themselves of responsibility by
arguing that they have no control
over the world which they have
actually in their own studies cre
ated. They refuse to attach a
meaning to the past a meaning
which can give us a sense of di
rection and a sense of limit.”
The professor concluded by not
ing, “The University is a collec
tion of mutual responsibilities—
and our major difficulty would
seem to be that wo do not really
demand enough from one an
other.”
Wed in opened his remarks by
recalling. “When President Ster
ling addressed the Freshman
Class in 1961, he said that the
great prerogative of a private
university was not the freedom of
speech or of expression, but rath
er the freedom to experiment. It
was in this context (hat those of
us present entered Stanford Uni
versity.”

THE INCOMING president saw
“two levels of interpretation” in
Sterling’s statement: the freedom
of the university “to be responsi
ble only to itself,” and “the stu
dent right to freedom of experi
| mentation.” Wedin felt that the
latter “acquires a definition of
‘freedom within a defined frame
work.’ But when student action
land concern arise in areas that
I He outside the delegated frame
work. its true nature is revealed
i in an interesting and obvious ir
rationality: the delegated frame
work does not reflect the particu
| lar concerns and interests of the
student community; instead, the
student community must adjust
i these concerns and interest to the
(existing framework ... it is
j these very areas outside the tra
ditional sphere of student action
i in which students can make the
(most meaningful contribution to
! Stanford.”
He closed in stating, “It is in
this tradition that wo should con
j stantly question and probe, eval
j uatc and change. We should hold
nothing right until proven; noth
! ing wrong until tested.”
Rosencranz concluded the eve
ning with a special thanks to his
fellow officers, faculty friends,
student affairs committee. Presi
dent Sterling and the Board of
Trustees, GRIP, LASSU . and
“particularly Miss Aten, ASSU of
fice manager, who is retiring af
ter 36 years of faithful and de
voted service to the Associated
Students."

BUD WEDIN, incoming ASSU president poses with outgoing ASSU
president, Armin Rosencranz before the start of the ASSU "farewell" banquet last night.
At a “farewell banquet yesterday evening were gathered the
student leaders, faculty and members of the Administration who
have effected and viewed a “revolution” this year in the emphasis
ol student government at Stanford University.
And the words of keynote speakers Annin Rosencranz, out

going ASSU president. Bud We
din, incoming ASSU president,
and assistant professor of politi
cal science Charles Drekmeier
represented the new voicing of a
vibrant educational philosophy.
THE ROSENCRANZ farewell
address provided an evaluation, a
summary, and a vision of student
government. Beginning with a ci
tation from Ecclesiastes (“ . . . a
time to keep silent and a time to
speak . . . ”) he stated, “Precise
ly because we believe in Stan
ford’s greatness, we have faith

that tomorrow it can be even
greater.”
The President's address was a
somewhat Socratic dialogue with
the University. At one point he
stated, “Wo have been told. ‘You
can't run a University by debate,’
and we have answered that that
is the only way a groat University
can bo run.”
Drekmeier began his address
by quoting Eve’s words to Adam
as they left the Garden: “‘My
dear, we live in an age of trans
ition.’ Stanford is in this age of
transition, always has been and
probably always will be, since it
is not likely that trustees, alum
ni, students, faculty, and admin
istration are always going to be
satisfied with the same things.”

THE POLITICAL theorist went
on to say, “One does not have to
be particularly discerning to de
tect the several ghosts that lurk
in the arcades of inner Quad
rangle. There is the ghost of
Stanford past, the ghost of a
time when learning was an attri
bute that certain people were ex
pected to have.
“Then there is the ghost of
Stanford today and probably to
morrow. Learning is justified in
different ways primarily by

practical achievement. The “new”
student has to create himself. Ac
tions are no longer the simple
manifestations of what we are;
they constitute our very identity.”
