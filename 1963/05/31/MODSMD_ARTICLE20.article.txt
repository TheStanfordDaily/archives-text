# Student Interest in Africa Grows; More Courses, IIR Meet Demand
## 
### HELEN BENJAMIN 
The dearth of undergraduate courses relating directly to Afri
can Studies is being met increasingly by the student body with
protestations representative of the phenomenal increase in stu
dent interest and commitment to the field.
UK’s Africa Desk has been active here for several years, spon-

soring a $20,000 book drive (sub
sequently transferred to the Asia
Foundation), providing opportu
nities for academic exchange
with African colleges and univer
sities, and educational programs
often in conjunction with the I-
Club on the Stanford campus.

Studies last December.
Any broadening of the African
spectrum, as opposed to deepen
ing, said Dr. Robert J. Wert, vice
provost, would not only be an ex
pensive undertaking but of ques
tionable value considering the na
tion’s limited African resources.

The HR also maintains an Af
filiation with Makercre College
in Uganda permitting the ex
change of at least one set of stu
dents each year. Other rising
guages of student interest in Af
rican affairs have been the pro
porionately high number of Peace
Corps volunteers from Stanford
and direct participation this year
in Operation Crossroads Africa.
“STUDENT INTEREST has a
real influence on the strengthen
ing of African Studies at Stan
ford,” affirms Dr. William O.
Jones, Food Research African
specialist and chairman of the
five-month-old Stanford African
Studies Committee.

“This interest certainly can’t
be designated the cause of the
proposed intensification in Afri
can studies, hut it is allowing us
to increase faculty with under
graduate teaching commitments
with confidence that they will be
more than well received,” he
said.
Dr. Jones himself witnessed

twice the number of students sign
up for his seminar course in
Tropical African Economies this
quarter than he had expected.

Both the Food Research Insti
tute and Hoover Institution have
been involved with African
Studies for a number of years,
but on the graduate, rather than
undergraduate, level.
THEY HAVE also pioneered re
spectively in agricultural and
historical African research help
ing to form the nuclei of detailed
reports and monographs neces
sary to support any serious schol
arship and which are so sorely
lacking at all American universi
ties in the field of African
studies.

Beginning 1o build in 1956 on
its limited but impressive Afri
can colonial holdings, Hoover In
stitution, intensifying its pro
gram of acquisitions in the last
three years, can now boast ap
proximately 10.000 boks, 400
hound volumes of government
documents, and 10,000 unbound
items in its African collection.
IN EVALUATING African
studies at Stanford, then, due
credit must be given to both re
search and graduate training and
to the pillar of their support, the
Hoover African collection; but
teaching on the undergraduate
and graduate levels leaves much
to be desired. This is not alto
gether the University’s fault.
Both the History and Political
Science departments have been
searching for suitable Africanists
to fill appointments in their re
spective departments for next
year, neither successfully thus
far.
The Anthropology department,
however, will be greatly strength
ened by the addition of African
and linguist specialist, Joseph H.
Greenberg. He will be teaching
on the undergraduate as well as
graduate level.

Any broadening of the African
spectrum, as opposed to deepen

provost, would not only be an ex
pensive undertaking but of ques

The HR also maintains an Af
filiation with Makercre College
in Uganda permitting the ex
change of at least one set of stu

guages of student interest in Af
rican affairs have been the pro

Corps volunteers from Stanford
and direct participation this year
in Operation Crossroads Africa.
“STUDENT INTEREST has a
real influence on the strengthen
ing of African Studies at Stan
ford,” affirms Dr. William O.
Jones, Food Research African
specialist and chairman of the
five-month-old Stanford African
Studies Committee.

“This interest certainly can’t
be designated the cause of the
proposed intensification in Afri
can studies, hut it is allowing us
to increase faculty with under
graduate teaching commitments
with confidence that they will be
more than well received,” he
said.
Dr. Jones himself witnessed

twice the number of students sign
up for his seminar course in
Tropical African Economies this
quarter than he had expected.
