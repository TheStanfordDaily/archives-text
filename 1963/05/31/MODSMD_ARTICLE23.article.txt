# Dose Picked as Athlete of Year
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Tom Dose broke the Stanford
season basketball scoring record
despite being guarded by two and
three men every game. This feat
earned Dose the nod by the Daily
sports staff as the Stanford Ath
lete of the Year.

In selecting Dose, it was hard
for the Daily to overlook other
fine athletes who excelled in their
sports. Such as Ed Cummings in
football and Dave Weill and
Steve Cortright in track gave the

6-8 center with the soft touch a
close run for Ihe money, but
Dose’s efforts, sometimes almost
single-handed, to win the AAWU
basketball crown for the Tribe in
the end could not be overlooked.
Dose shattered Ron Tomsic’s 10
year old scoring, mark in the In
dians’ last game of the year.
Along the way he scored 35 points
in a 73-69 overtime triumph over
UCLA. He notched 28 points in
the second half to carry Stanford
from behind to victory.
Among his other fine games
w r as a 23-point effort against the
Bruins as Stanford won 86-78.
Dose also scored 21 and 19 points
in Stanford’s two victories over
California.
Dose also led the Big Six in
rebounding.
The Daily named the athletes

came within one vote of also be
ing the outstanding hack of the
game.
Cummings nearly single-hand

season basketball scoring record
despite being guarded by two and
three men every game. This feat
earned Dose the nod by the Daily
sports staff as the Stanford Ath
lete of the Year.

In selecting Dose, it was hard
for the Daily to overlook other
fine athletes who excelled in their
sports. Such as Ed Cummings in
football and Dave Weill and
Steve Cortright in track gave the

6-8 center with the soft touch a
close run for Ihe money, but
Dose’s efforts, sometimes almost
single-handed, to win the AAWU
basketball crown for the Tribe in
the end could not be overlooked.
Dose shattered Ron Tomsic’s 10
year old scoring, mark in the In
dians’ last game of the year.
Along the way he scored 35 points
in a 73-69 overtime triumph over
UCLA. He notched 28 points in
the second half to carry Stanford
from behind to victory.
Among his other fine games
w r as a 23-point effort against the
Bruins as Stanford won 86-78.
Dose also scored 21 and 19 points
in Stanford’s two victories over
California.
Dose also led the Big Six in
rebounding.

three men every game. This feat
earned Dose the nod by the Daily
sports staff as the Stanford Ath
lete of the Year.

In selecting Dose, it was hard
for the Daily to overlook other
fine athletes who excelled in their
sports. Such as Ed Cummings in
football and Dave Weill and
Steve Cortright in track gave the

6-8 center with the soft touch a
close run for Ihe money, but
Dose’s efforts, sometimes almost
single-handed, to win the AAWU
basketball crown for the Tribe in
the end could not be overlooked.
Dose shattered Ron Tomsic’s 10
year old scoring, mark in the In
dians’ last game of the year.
Along the way he scored 35 points
in a 73-69 overtime triumph over
UCLA. He notched 28 points in
the second half to carry Stanford
from behind to victory.
Among his other fine games
w r as a 23-point effort against the
Bruins as Stanford won 86-78.
Dose also scored 21 and 19 points
in Stanford’s two victories over
California.
Dose also led the Big Six in
rebounding.
The Daily named the athletes
of the year in the other Stanford
sports.
Cummings in Football
In football it was Ed Cum
mings, the defensive demon who
was signed as a linebacker by the
New York Giants even though ho
weighed 30 pounds less than the i
average pro linebacker.
Cummings was outstanding in
every game he played, and was
named either the best back or
lineman in the game in nearly
every Stanford contest.
His crushing defensive play
reached its height in the Stanford
16-13 upset over Michigan State.
He participated in 26 tackles, was
named lineman of the game, and
came within one vote of also be
ing the outstanding hack of the
game.
Cummings nearly single-hand
edly withstood the wild rush of
the USC thundering herd for a
quarter and a half, but he had to
leave the game with a concussion
and the Trojans proceeded to
power 39 points and an easy vic
tory.
Weill, the top trackman, wo n
his event in every track meet
Stanford entered this year.
Weill Undefeated

220 yard relay. He won both

went above that mark when he
was belted solidly for the only
time of the year in Stanford’s
final game. His top performance
was a 3-0 shutout of UCLA.
The star of Stanford’s NCISC
champion soccer club was A1
Nnoli. Nnoli played excellent soc
cer in every Stanford game but
he was unable to score, though
setting up many goals for others.

in the NCAA playoffs, scoring
twice and assisting the third Stan
ford; goal, and becoming a prime
Aik American, candidate. t
Gordon Waddell, a graduate
student from Scotland, was the
outstanding Stanford rugger, and
perhaps was the top man in the

year. His broken-field runs and
expert passing led to many Card
scores.

was ineligible to compete for the

feated on the frosh team.

ford Crew Coach Conn Findlay, |
and has been on the varsity first I
boat for three years.
Roger Rhodes led the gymnas

meet victory, a convincing thrash
ing of San Francisco State. The
versatile Rhodes scored 21 points
as the small Stanford team
thrashed a Gator group that was
superior in manpower.

and had the outstanding record
on the squad. He was 7-1 on the
