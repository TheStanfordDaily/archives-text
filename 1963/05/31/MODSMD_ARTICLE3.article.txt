# Stanford Girls to Continue Community Project in Mexico
## 
### PAT REINHART 
Ten Stanford girls will be working in the small Mexican town
of Zinapecuaro this summer, continuing a community develop
ment project begun last year. In 1962, a group of 25 boys and 9
girls spent two months in Zinapecuaro as part of a rapidly-growing
student movement aimed at furthering understanding and friend-

ship between Mexicans and+
North Americans through social
action.

The boys constructed a recre
ation area. The girls, assisted by
middle-class Mexican girls, took
a detailed census of the poorest
areas of the town, to determine
the basic physical, spiritual, and
intellectual needs of the people,
and set up a traveling first-aid
station for on-the-spot lessons in
treatment of such problems as
bare feet cut on übiquitous ob
sidian.

j THIS YEAR, the girls will in-
I itiate remedies for the most
I pressing problems. Plans include:
j1) setting up part-time grammar
schools to teach the Three R’s,
!2 1 teaching basic hygiene to par
lonts and children, 3) helping to
1 staff the new hospital on a tern
jporary basis, 4) giving English
i lessons, and 5) organizing a trav
eling dispensary for the outlying
districts.
These projects are being un
dertaken at the invitation of the
townspeople, and will be carried
out under their supervision, to
I make the project a truly cooper
ative effort.
MEXICAN GIRLS will work
with the Americans and be train
ed to continue the programs on
their own. The U.S. girls will
j again live with Zinapecuaro fam
ilies, since this arrangement pro
vides the maximum opportunity
for personal contact.
This group is the latest in a
three-year series of internation
al student projects, which began
in 1961 when Yale students, led
by the Carota family of Califor
nia, constructed a school in Ac
tipan, a Mexico City slum.
THE TRULY reciprocal nature
I <>f the movement became appar
| ent the following winter, when
some .10 Mexican students came
to build a church in Fowler, Cal
ifornia: through participation in
this project, last year's Stanford
group became interested in going
to Zinapecuaro.
