# Crossroads Africa Program Called Summer Peace Corps
## 
### HELEN BENJAMIN 
By normal standards Crossroads Africa is still a youngster in
the field of cross-cultural cooperation and learning—six years old
this summer, and perhaps seven hundred alumni to its credit.
The project pioneered in giving both American and African youth
the opportunity to live and work together, to establish common
grounds for friendship and a ba
sis for mutual evaluation. Its im
pact has been far out of propor
tion to the number of people in
volved, both in Africa and the
United States.
Most of the American partici
pants are college students with a
variety of religious and ethnic
backgrounds. While in Africa the
students spend the majority of
their time on one work project
which is assigned to each group
by its host government. Perhaps
the most socially useful projects
have been the building of schools,
community centers, post offices,
and health centers. These types
of projects have also been the
most numerous, but because of
the discretion of the host country
involved, projects may either
turn out to be of questionable
merit (such as the building of
tennis courts) or only indirectly
beneficial (such as reforestation,
the building of game preserves or
area landscaping).
THK ACTUAL merit of the
project involved, not only in kind
but in qualify and quantity,
could bo of more importance if
Crossroads were, as some dubbed
it, a summer Peace Corps. Peace
Corps members, though, make a
more significant social contribu
tion to the countries they work
in, at least in terms of training,
time, and numbers.
Marty Lebowilz, chairman of
HR’s Teacher Placement and
Volunteer Work Service Commit
tee, negotiated the arrangement
with Dr. Robinson when he visit
ed Stanford last October. Over
fifty students applied. Participat
ing on Crossroads this summer
will be: Sandy Mackenzie, Guin
ea; Melissa Foster, Guinea; Su
san Goodwillie, Ivory Coast; Les
ley Linebargcr, Sierra Leone;
Jerry Berg, Kenya; Helen Ben
jamin, Northern Rhodesia; Leo
Shershow, Nyasaland; and Gil
Poole, Tanganyika.
