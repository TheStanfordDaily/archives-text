# Original Presentation of 'The Hostage'
## 
### HERBERT KENNEDY 
Remember that old Laurel and Hardy movie
in which that famous team set about destroying
a man’s house, because he had offended them?
Remember Laurel inside the house tossing dishes,
lamps, chairs and pictures out through the broken
windows, and Hardy outside on the lawn, armed
with a garden spade, magnificently swinging at
all the flying objects? Direct hits were made on
some and wild misses on others, and all the swings
and all the targets were funny.
This recollection kept popping into my head
Tuesday night at Brendan Behan’s “The Hostage”
now being performed at the Little Theatre as the
closing offering of the Stanford Players season.
Behan is magnificently wild in hitting out at every
target imaginable, and amid all the chaos some
times his aim is devastating and at other times
wildly wrong. In all cases it is funny.
How many of the misses can be attributed to
Ibis free-wheeling production need never bo fully
assessed. This presentation has wild spontaneity,
tremendous vitality, daring originality and total
unpredictability.

NOTHING IS sacred here. Behan’s very strong
opinions about war, the unnecessary killing of
innocents, and problems of social pressures on
renegades and outcasts aie to he found scattered
throughout the action. There is a brief plot, in
volving the holding of a young British soldier as
a hostage in a Dublin brothel in retaliation for the
pending execution of a young I.R.A. soldier by

the British.
But the performance is what matters most,
and in this production the director and his cast
give the play a “reading” that will no doubt long
stand in Stanfordland as a high mark of impu
dence, daring, boldness, vulgarity and sheer en
tertainment.
This production is fortunate in tho presence of
L. T. Jordan who plays Pat, the caretaker of the
wildest lodging house that over hit the boards;
his relaxation and relish with the Irish wit, in
the midst of chaos, commands maximum atten
tion. Close behind him, with real sense amid all
the nonsense, Is Karyl McMinn Victs as Meg,
Pat’s so-called wife.

THE TITLE ROLE is played by Richard Stack,
whose entrance, at the end of the first act, can
only be described as elccti'ifying. His attack on
his songs is particularly arresting, and his atti
tude, including the often difficult-to-catch Cockney
dialect, is entirely right.
Holmes Easley has provided a setting that,
works beautifully. Georgia Ryther’s witty ideas in
the costumes help immeasurably, and Cary Clasz’s
bold lighting contrasts are often thrilling. Mari
anne Crowder’s choreography is immensely help
ful in giving the production added life.
Altogether, it is a riotous show. Victor Mitchell,
in his Master of Arts thesis production, has staged
a play that demands imagination and inventive
ness, which he has provided in abundance.
Tickets are on sale at Trcsidder for the remain
ing shows tonight and tomorrow night.

some and wild misses on others, and all the swings
and all the targets were funny.
This recollection kept popping into my head
Tuesday night at Brendan Behan’s “The Hostage”
now being performed at the Little Theatre as the
closing offering of the Stanford Players season.
Behan is magnificently wild in hitting out at every
target imaginable, and amid all the chaos some
times his aim is devastating and at other times
wildly wrong. In all cases it is funny.
How many of the misses can be attributed to
Ibis free-wheeling production need never bo fully
assessed. This presentation has wild spontaneity,
tremendous vitality, daring originality and total
unpredictability.

NOTHING IS sacred here. Behan’s very strong
opinions about war, the unnecessary killing of
innocents, and problems of social pressures on
renegades and outcasts aie to he found scattered
throughout the action. There is a brief plot, in
volving the holding of a young British soldier as
a hostage in a Dublin brothel in retaliation for the
pending execution of a young I.R.A. soldier by

the British.
But the performance is what matters most,
and in this production the director and his cast
give the play a “reading” that will no doubt long
stand in Stanfordland as a high mark of impu
dence, daring, boldness, vulgarity and sheer en
tertainment.
This production is fortunate in tho presence of
L. T. Jordan who plays Pat, the caretaker of the
wildest lodging house that over hit the boards;
his relaxation and relish with the Irish wit, in
the midst of chaos, commands maximum atten
tion. Close behind him, with real sense amid all
the nonsense, Is Karyl McMinn Victs as Meg,
Pat’s so-called wife.

THE TITLE ROLE is played by Richard Stack,
whose entrance, at the end of the first act, can
only be described as elccti'ifying. His attack on
his songs is particularly arresting, and his atti
tude, including the often difficult-to-catch Cockney
dialect, is entirely right.
Holmes Easley has provided a setting that,
works beautifully. Georgia Ryther’s witty ideas in
the costumes help immeasurably, and Cary Clasz’s
bold lighting contrasts are often thrilling. Mari
anne Crowder’s choreography is immensely help
ful in giving the production added life.
Altogether, it is a riotous show. Victor Mitchell,
in his Master of Arts thesis production, has staged
a play that demands imagination and inventive
ness, which he has provided in abundance.
Tickets are on sale at Trcsidder for the remain
ing shows tonight and tomorrow night.
Remember that old Laurel and Hardy movie
in which that famous team set about destroying
a man’s house, because he had offended them?
Remember Laurel inside the house tossing dishes,
lamps, chairs and pictures out through the broken
windows, and Hardy outside on the lawn, armed
with a garden spade, magnificently swinging at
all the flying objects? Direct hits were made on
some and wild misses on others, and all the swings
and all the targets were funny.
