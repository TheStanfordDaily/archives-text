# CAB Dismisses ASA Charter Flight Request
## 
### DANIEL SCHWARTZ Editor 
The Civil Aeronautics Board has dismissed the application by
the Aerovias sud Americana Airlines requesting permission to fly
passenger charter flights across the Atlantic.
A CAB spokesman, who had informed The Daily Wednesday
of tlic Board’s decision, said that the application had applied to

■all twenty of the ASA’s proposed
charter flights which were to
leave for Europe beginning on
June 8.

Jerry Davis, owner of the
World Travel Center in Palo Alto,
in a KZSU interview Wednesday
night, said that he had an alterna
tive to the ASA planes for the
Stanford charter flight. Davis
said that the alternative carrier
would conform to the CAB regu
lations. Although he would not
say what airline, specifically, he
had in mind, he noted that it was
of “great prominence.” Davis
said that he was also checking
with several smaller airlines.
THE ACTION by the Board
noted that ASA had “alleged”
that it had . . . “the necessary
aircraft, capital, trust accounts
arrangements, screening provi

sions for eligibility, and arrange
ments for representation abroad;
that it has appropriate tariff on
file with the Board; that it has
had prior experience in the per
formance of charters: and that
its future depends in part on suc
cessful commercial operation.”
The action said, however, in a
footnote to the text of the order,
that “certain problems should be
noted. ASA has no past experi
ence in the transatlantic civil
passenger market. Moreover, its
financial reports filed with the
Board indicate that its ability to
meet the test of financial fitness
for this particular type of pro
gram might be questioned.”
IN DISMISSING the ASA ap
plication, the Board’s action noted
that “applications may bo filed
only by carriers which are appli
cants in good standing for trans
atlantic charters overseas.”
The order stated that in a trans
atlantic charter investigation of
November 14, 1960, “although
ASA was an applicant in this in
vestigation, its application there
in was dismissed. . . . Thus it is
not eligible to apply for the au
thority in question nor does its
application in any way offer an
explanation as to why it might
be construed as eligible ...”
When contacted Wednesday
afternoon by The Daily and by
radio station KZSU, Victor Car
michael, president of ASA said
that, as of that time, he had not
been advised that the application
had been turned down.

There will be a special
program on KZSU, 880 kc.,
this evening at 8 p.m. which
will contain any further de
velopments on the charter
flight question.

World Travel Center in Palo Alto,
in a KZSU interview Wednesday
night, said that he had an alterna
tive to the ASA planes for the
Stanford charter flight. Davis
said that the alternative carrier
would conform to the CAB regu
lations. Although he would not
say what airline, specifically, he
had in mind, he noted that it was
of “great prominence.” Davis
said that he was also checking
with several smaller airlines.
THE ACTION by the Board
noted that ASA had “alleged”
that it had . . . “the necessary
aircraft, capital, trust accounts
arrangements, screening provi

sions for eligibility, and arrange
ments for representation abroad;
that it has appropriate tariff on
file with the Board; that it has
had prior experience in the per
formance of charters: and that
its future depends in part on suc
cessful commercial operation.”
The action said, however, in a
footnote to the text of the order,
that “certain problems should be
noted. ASA has no past experi
ence in the transatlantic civil
passenger market. Moreover, its
financial reports filed with the
Board indicate that its ability to
meet the test of financial fitness
for this particular type of pro
gram might be questioned.”
IN DISMISSING the ASA ap
plication, the Board’s action noted
that “applications may bo filed
only by carriers which are appli
cants in good standing for trans
atlantic charters overseas.”
The order stated that in a trans
atlantic charter investigation of
November 14, 1960, “although
ASA was an applicant in this in
vestigation, its application there
in was dismissed. . . . Thus it is
not eligible to apply for the au
thority in question nor does its
application in any way offer an
explanation as to why it might
be construed as eligible ...”
When contacted Wednesday
afternoon by The Daily and by
radio station KZSU, Victor Car
michael, president of ASA said
that, as of that time, he had not
been advised that the application
had been turned down.

There will be a special
program on KZSU, 880 kc.,
this evening at 8 p.m. which
will contain any further de
velopments on the charter
flight question.

A CAB spokesman, who had informed The Daily Wednesday
of tlic Board’s decision, said that the application had applied to

■all twenty of the ASA’s proposed
