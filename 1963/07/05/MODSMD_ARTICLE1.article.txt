# Minority Groups Seek Full Equal Status Now
## 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN 
“Status—full, equal, and now!”
this is the goal of the two most
prominent minority groups in
North America today, the Amer
ican Negroes and the french
Canadians, as described by Pro
lessor Everett C. Hughes, Profes
sor of Sociology at Brandeis Uni
versity and President of the
American Sociological Society, in
the first of the summer Tuesday
Evening Series lectures on J uly 2.

The leaders of both these
groups are young, urban people,
anxious, impatient with the meth
ods of past leaders, unwilling to
wait any longer. And it is this
unwillingness to wait which makes
them radical. “Radicalism never
consists in wanting something,’’
Professor Hugnes said, “only
when you want it.”
"The Negroes are struggling to
disappear, to become invisible as
Negroes and fully visible as per
sons,’’ Professor Hughes staled.
“The struggle of the French
Canadians is that of the classic
minority, to become distinctly
visible as a group.”
in the traditional sense, a mi
nority is a group of people with a
collective past, language, and
land, subjected to foreign rule.
The French Canadians call them
selves “the last of the old classical
minorities,” subjected to the for
eign rule of the English Canadi
ans.
The American Negro, Professor
Hughes noted, is a distinctly
American creation. Negroes came
to America as strangers to each
other; their only point in common
is their collective experience in
America. A minority in the sense
of the Negro is a group of people
who believe they suffer from a
status handicap because of some
feature, physical, social, or gen
etic, they possess.
The new characteristic of the
Negro today is his refusal to ac
cept any more promises in place
of action.
