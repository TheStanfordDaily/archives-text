# Selected Students Eat, Breathe, Live Exotic' Languages at Asian House
## 
### MARY LYNN HENES 
Twenty-live students of Chinese
and Japanese form the hardwork
ing living group called Asian
House.
This center of intensive study
in the “exotic” or neglected lan
guages provides an opportunity
ror graduates and undergraduates
to help one another gain a com
mand of the Asian language.
Operating only in tne summer,
Asian House supplements five
nours of class per day with lan
guage tables at meal time and an
atmosphere conducive to study.
W. Aliwyn Rickelt, Assistant Pro
fessor of Chinese Studies at tne
University of Pennsylvania, and
his wile serve as resident as
sistants for the group. Rickett
conducts the language tables at
meals along with Miss Wong, a
teaching assistant from Taiwan.
i'lie oacKgrounds of Asian
ilouse members are diverse.
Brian Davidson, one of three
students from the University of
British Columbia taking advan
tage of the program, will take
his degree in international Rela
tions, having completed eight
years of French, three years of
Russian and at least three years
of Japanese. He must still look
forward to two years at the Uni
versity of Keio in Japan in addi
tion to 2-4 years of government
work at home before being posted

abroad in the Diplomatic Service.

Not all of the students are in
terested in Chinese and Japanese
for use in the political or social
sciences, however. There has
been a growing interest in Asian
linguistics and culture, particular
ly literature. Many American uni
versities are beginning to expand
their comparative literature
courses.

Partially because of the 1 cold
war, which has put the East in
the limelight, new jobs are avail
able in these fields and they now
provide adequate means to earn
a living rather than a “volunteer
teaching’’ program. Several stu
dents in Asian House are on
NDEA scholarships, set up to
further encourage study in these
neglected areas.
Paul McCarthy, a University of
Minnesota sophomore, is enrolled
in Japanese here, and eventually
planning to teach comparative
literature.

John McCobb, a Stanford law
student needs Chinese to aid his
teaching mathematics in Hong
Kong while on a Princeton-in-Asia
fellowship. An adult member of
the group who also wants the
language to make his work abroad
easier is Father Lester Westling,
chaplain at a missionary school in
Manila.
Asian House is one of the few
programs of its kind in this coun
try. •
