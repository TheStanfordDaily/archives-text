# Sternheim's 'Snob' Treats Society Pressure, Bourgeois
## 
### KENT W. SMITH 
For Stanford’s Contemporary
Theater Workshop, the summer
spotlight is on the Experimental.
“The Snob” by German satirist
Carl Sternheim leads off this ad
venture into the modern.

It is the press of Society upon
the individual and the hollow tri
umph of the materialist middle
class that concerns Sternheim
most. His “Snob” clinically mea
sures the darwinistic march of
capitalist Christian Maske to the
bourgeois throne of power and
success.

the dramatic conflict centers on
a man turned robot scraping the
humanity from himself like so
much rust. On the play’s opening,
Christian is banishing nis parents
and his mistress from his pot
melat life by paying them oft in
Deutschmarks lor their past
"services’’—their love, their care,
their sacrifices.
Unless we be molded and
stamped unknowingly, we cannot
today ignore Sternheim’s warning
to the individual against the ma
chine monster Society.
THE FBOUUAAI NOTES adver
tise Sternheim as a "modern Mu-
Here.’’ In Moliere, however, the
human spirit always manages to
escape, sneak out in the end. In
Sternneim, the human spirit is
relentlessly squeezed to give up
the ghost.
Sternheim is always a challenge.
To see his work done is to antici
pate excitement. He leaves holes
and jagged edges in his pieces—
and a world of suggestion.
DIRECTOR STAN VVEESE
takes the steel skeleton and ful
fills it, brings it to life. Out of his
company, he constructs a full
boom, asembly-line society.
Weese guides from above with
a firm control and achieves a com
pelling movement forward. He
keeps his players revolving on the
stage, never static, never boring.
Only rarely do they steam at the
mouth with lines.

Weese’s innovations work well;
a stereotyped Sternheim would
flounder. Old Maske’s clambering
upon the guilded table—a symbol
of son Christian’s conquest over
the blue-bloods—is daringly done.
An absorbing display of lighting
virtuosity in the first act tempts
one to applaud the director still
further. The credits, in truth, are

due a playful, but faulty, light
switch.
“THE SNOB” is satirical com
edy. Weese has chosen to parade
the comedy and to keep the satire
back in the wings. As a result, his
interpretation wounds little but
delights a great deal.
The play's comic spirit breaths
thi’ough bill Louis, as Christian’s
petty bureaucratic papa. A sort
of German Alfred Doolittle, Mr.
Louis captures the audience into
his quaint and crackery little
world and holds it there laughing.
‘Trying to mate a mouse with a
giraffe,'’ he bellows at his son’s
mariage designs. The masterful
Mr. Louis turns in the evening’s
oest performance.
The sickly sweet smile and the
syrupy love of Lisa Lauterer’s
mother Maske operate in perfect
complement. Her hideous orange
travelling outfit—as all of Jan
Pratts costume work reveals
the essence of the character.
AS COUNT FALEN, the upper
crusty momument to Junker Ger
many and Prussionism, Geoffrey
Laraner maintains to the hilt the
utter inaccessibility” of his class,
by refusing to unoend, he realizes
most faitniuily the decadent fig
ure Steinheim intended.
Lynn boalsman, as cnnstian’s
trophy trie Countess Marianne, is
at ner best in abandon and impish
ness, the free spirit contrasted to
her over-stuffeu father. Her maiu
Margaret Lamont is good
when a proper servant, not so
good when a sniveling ingenue.
i-.ance Hannon makes an admir
atily wooden valet.
Jane Loen as Sybil does a fine
hardened out discarded mistress.
Her sarcasm bites.
The focus of Sternheim’s cari
cature of tne German bourgeoise
centers on Christian. By ruthless
will, he has grappled to the top:
rert of his low origins and his hu
man feelings: an iron snob, but
ins triumph rings metallic; So
ciety has cast him a stainless’steel
heart.
HERMAN FOFFE masterfully
creates this robot conqueror a few
moments into the second act. Back
cocked, commanding figure, he
dominates. But thereafter the
character collapses.
At his worst when whining, ac
tor Poppe ought be more a manly
Maske and less a creampuff Chris
tian. His playpen must have been
a drawing room by Sheridan or
Wilde. If Christian had held
strong, the production would be
sure victory.
The Deutsch-Victorian universe
of the Maskes becomes tangible
within the set-creations of Holmes
Easley. His furnishings follow
Christian’s career remarkably
well from grotesque leather
chairs to rococo grand suites. His
mobile bare frame affords a cut
away view into each scene that is
intriguing.
THE EVENING OF STEBN
UEIM, then, was a delight and a
success. Current theater is rare
here, and exciting. Anyone can see
the Old Vic do Shakespeare on TV.
btage-spirits more daring and less
house-broken will trek the twelve
steps to the Outer Circle.
With "The Snob” for starter,
one can look forward with inter
est to a splendid season of Brecht,
Mortimer, Pinter and Becket.
The theme of “the Individual
versus the Collectivity” will ap
pear anew in the series, but un
der widely different treatment.
"The Snob” will be presented
again at 8:40 tonight and July 6,
ff. 12 and 13.
