# Hofstadter Speech Deplores Committee Action Physics'
## 
### 
“Physics by committee action”
was strongly deplored by Profes
sor Robert Hofstadter, Nobel
prize - winning physicist, in a
speech at a press luncheon of the
International Conference on Nu
cleon Structure on Monday, June
24.
THE PRESIDENTIAL commit
tee of scientists who recently
recommended an $8 billion U.S.
nuclear physics program that
would include building giant new
atom smashers was the target of
Hofstadter’s criticism.
“They made recommendations
affecting the lives of a great num
ber of scientists,” Hofstadter
stated. “That’s a new thing in
science.
THE PROBLEM is to get some
kind of balance so you can keep
good physicists working on the
things they’re interested in,” he
said. He contended that the pro
gram recommended to President

Kennedy would put too many
scientists to work on one certain
phase of research.
