# Bolivar House: Inside Lines to Latin America
## 
### ELAINE LUTHY 
Bolivar House, home of the Ins
titute of Hispanic-American and
Luso-Brazilian Studies, is one
place on campus where politics
is never a dirty word and foreign
languages are always used as
well as studied.
The Institute, under the direc
tion of Ronald Hilton, carries on
a thorough and uninterrupted
study of Latin America, Spain,
and Portugal. Focus of the whole
program is politics, the predomi
nant interest of the Spanish
speaking countries today. The
approach is inter-departmental
with fields such as preventative
medicine, business, chemistry, and
law represented on the “Cooperat
ing Faculty” of the Institute.
EACH DAY hundreds of news
paper clippings and periodicals
arrive from Latin America at
Bolivar House. Here they are
translated, evaluated, and com
piled for the use of the official
Institute organ, “The Hispanic

American Report.” Published
monthly, “The Report” contains
current information on each Latin
American country.
This publication was recently
in the news as a result of the
Cuban crisis. The Cuban arms
build-up and threat had been
noted in “The Report” months
before the American public was
aware of it.
How does “The Report” man
age to get this kind of informa
tion? According to editor-director
Hilton, regular newspapers de
pend on “stringers” or part-time
correspondents to supply news
from Latin America. These cor
respondents are paid by the gov
ernments of their countries many
times what their part-time U.S.
employers pay them. As a result
the news that reaches the U.S.
has often been edited to show the
Latin country to advantage.
“THE REPORT” on the other
hand has its own correspondents
and receives whole articles and
publications. Because all research
ers at the Institute can read either
Spanish, Portuguese, or both flu
ently, they then have access to
all available information on Latin
America.
Though the Institute issues
“The Report” and other publica
tions it is much more than a pub
lishing house. It offers work to
ward the A.8., M.A., and Ph.D.
degrees and demands the equiva
lent of three years of college-level
Spanish for the A.B.
This requirement is in line with
Hilton’s desire that the Institute
provide a language-and-area pro
gram. “The study of a foreign
area without a mastery of the
language of that area is compara
ble to trying to study engineering
without mathematics,” says Hil
ton.
As part of its emphasis on per
sonal contact, the Institute has
on its staff Sir Harold Wilson
who spends alternate quarters
first visiting Latin America, then
lecturing at Stanford on the de
velopments he has observed there.
Special summer programs for
teachers and occasional confer
ences on Latin America are also
part of the Institute’s agenda.
Courses offered during the cur
rent summer session range from
study of the Alliance for Progress
to work in Luso-Brazilian linguis
tics.
The ultimate goal of the His
panic American Institute is the
reunion of language with political
and social culture.

arrive from Latin America at
Bolivar House. Here they are
translated, evaluated, and com
piled for the use of the official
Institute organ, “The Hispanic

American Report.” Published
monthly, “The Report” contains
current information on each Latin
American country.
This publication was recently
in the news as a result of the
Cuban crisis. The Cuban arms
build-up and threat had been
noted in “The Report” months
before the American public was
aware of it.
How does “The Report” man
age to get this kind of informa
tion? According to editor-director
Hilton, regular newspapers de
pend on “stringers” or part-time
correspondents to supply news
from Latin America. These cor
respondents are paid by the gov
ernments of their countries many
times what their part-time U.S.
employers pay them. As a result
the news that reaches the U.S.
has often been edited to show the
Latin country to advantage.
“THE REPORT” on the other
hand has its own correspondents
and receives whole articles and
publications. Because all research
ers at the Institute can read either
Spanish, Portuguese, or both flu
ently, they then have access to
all available information on Latin
America.
Though the Institute issues
“The Report” and other publica
tions it is much more than a pub
lishing house. It offers work to
ward the A.8., M.A., and Ph.D.
degrees and demands the equiva
lent of three years of college-level
Spanish for the A.B.
This requirement is in line with
Hilton’s desire that the Institute
provide a language-and-area pro
gram. “The study of a foreign
area without a mastery of the
language of that area is compara
ble to trying to study engineering
without mathematics,” says Hil
ton.
As part of its emphasis on per
sonal contact, the Institute has
on its staff Sir Harold Wilson
who spends alternate quarters
first visiting Latin America, then
lecturing at Stanford on the de
velopments he has observed there.
Special summer programs for
teachers and occasional confer
ences on Latin America are also
part of the Institute’s agenda.
Courses offered during the cur
rent summer session range from
study of the Alliance for Progress
to work in Luso-Brazilian linguis
tics.
The ultimate goal of the His
panic American Institute is the
reunion of language with political
and social culture.
Bolivar House, home of the Ins
titute of Hispanic-American and
Luso-Brazilian Studies, is one
place on campus where politics
is never a dirty word and foreign
languages are always used as
well as studied.
The Institute, under the direc
tion of Ronald Hilton, carries on
a thorough and uninterrupted
study of Latin America, Spain,
and Portugal. Focus of the whole
program is politics, the predomi
nant interest of the Spanish
speaking countries today. The
approach is inter-departmental
with fields such as preventative
medicine, business, chemistry, and
law represented on the “Cooperat
ing Faculty” of the Institute.
EACH DAY hundreds of news
paper clippings and periodicals
arrive from Latin America at
Bolivar House. Here they are
translated, evaluated, and com
piled for the use of the official
