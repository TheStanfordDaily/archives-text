If you have been planning a trip
to San Francisco for culture or
entertainment, this weekend is an
exciting time to take it.
MILK AND HONEY— Milk
and Honey,” a romantic musical
comedy opens today at the Geary
with original Broadway cast mem
bers Robert Weede and Molly
Picon. Weede plays an American
businessman who leaves his wife
in Paris to visit his daughter in
Israel, then falls in love with a
young widow played by Terry
Saunders.
The humorous group of eight
husband-hunting American wid
ows is headed by Miss Picon, a
sixty-year-old, five-foot-two bundle
of dramatic energy.
BICUAItU O—For those whose
taste runs to serious drama, the
Interplayers’ production of “Rich
ard II” opens on Beach Street to
morrow night. Walter Mahoney
stars as Richard, under the direc
tion of Leon Forbes. Special stu
dent rates are available.
MONDO CANE—“Mondo Cane,”
one of the season’s most contro
versial films, is playing at the
Metro and on the Peninsula at
the Saratoga.
Unposed and unacted sequences,
each centering on a single idea,
are taken from every part of the
world and dramatically juxta

posed. One shows the death by
heat and starvation on Bikini Is
land of a giant sea turtle whose
sense of direction has been de
stroyed by radiation; another Is
a telephoto view of the world’s
last cavemen. The effect Is an
always moving, often chilling
questioning of western values.
