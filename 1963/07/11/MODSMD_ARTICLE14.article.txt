The school enrollment surges ot
the 1950's in America will slow
down substantially during the rest
of the 'Sixties,, a Stanford expert
predicts.
As a result, “the outlook for ade
quate financing of education is
bright, unless; the national econo
my takes a nose dive or turns slug
gish,” says Roger A. Freeman,
senior staff .member at the Hoover
Institution.
Between T954 and 1962, total en
rollment in the nation’s schools
and colleges rose 35 per cent, he
notes. Between now and 1970, the
increase will average only half as
much—l7 per cent— according to
projections developed by the U.S.
Census Bureau and Office of Edu
cation.
Colleges and professional
schools will remain the fastest
growing component of the educa
tional system.
"For some time,” says Free man,
“the states have had to coi icen
trate their funds on the rapidlj r ex
panding elementary and second
ary schools. In the future, t hey
will be able to channel alar ger
share of their resources into high
er education.”
