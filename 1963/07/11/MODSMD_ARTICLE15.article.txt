# Test Ban Tries Hurt America
## 
### 
Continued futile American ef
forts to negotiate a nuclear test
ban with Russia have undermined
United States leadership of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion, contends Dr. Stefan T. Pos
sony, a member of Stanford’s
Hoover Institution.
Dr. Possony, writing in Orbis
Magazine, quarterly publication of
the Foreign Policy Institute at the
University of Pennsylvania, states
that many Europeans feel that the
“price that must eventually be
paid by the United States for So
viet goodwill and a non-aggression
promise is the abolition of NATO.”
“The trouble with United States
policy is not that it is ill-inten
tioned, but rather that it lacks de
termination and constancy. In its
incessant quest for new approach
es and flexibility, it appears to be
erratic and unpredictable.”
The cost of preparing a full
spectrum of defenses against nu
clear attack has become prohibi
tive for any single country, Pos
sony notes, but “the U.S. need not
race the U.S.S.R. by itself. If it
works closely with the Europeans,
NATO will be able to boast a pool
of more than three-quarters of the
world’s intellectual and technical
resources.”
Among the cooperative steps
which the U.S. could take with
Europe are: 1) partial repeal of
U.S. nuclear legislation to permit
more assistance to our allies; and
2) establishment of multi-national
legislative committees looking to
ward possible development of a
common, NATO-wide military
budget.
"The Western strategic objec
tive should be to make certain
with each passing year that the
Soviets will find the option of an
attack on Western Europe less
and less thinkable,” Possony con
cludes.
