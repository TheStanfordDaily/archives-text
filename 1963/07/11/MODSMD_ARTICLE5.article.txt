# ’Endgame’ Depicts World’s End
## 
### 
“Endgame” by Samuel Beckett,
the second of the summer produc
tions by the Stanford Contempo
rary Theatre Workshop, will open
tomorrow night at 8:40 p.m. in the
Little Theatre.
The play will also be presented
Saturday night and again July
18, 19, 20, 25, 26. and 27.
"The Snob” by Carl Sternheim
will be presented tonight, tomor
row, and Saturday night in the
Outer Circle arena theatre to com
plete a three week end run.
BECKETT’S “ENDGAME,” a
play representative of the mod
ern “Theatre of the Absurd,” has
beeen called an end-of-the-world
play in which the world expires
not with an explosion, but “with
a sputter.” It focuses on disin
tegration, death, and debilitation.
Men are shown paralyzed in their
ability to act, slowly moving to
ward death, surrounded by noth
ingness. The master cannot stand
or see, the servant cannot sit.
Parents with no legs live in ash
cans.
The question of escape and
hope in this ultimately desperate
situation is one which Beckett
leaves unanswered. Perhaps, hope
exists; perhaps, it does not.
PAUL WINFIELD, who has
done professional theatre work in
Los Angeles and Hollywood, will
portray Hamm, the master.
Steven Gilborn, last seen as Mac
beth in the Stanford Players’ pro
duction, will play Clov, the ser
vant. Sandra Hunter will play
Nell, the mother, and Larry Bow
en will be Nagg, the father.
The production is directed by
Gordon M. Wickstrom, a graduate
student and director from the
Colorado Shakespeare Festival.
Wendell Cole is designing the set
tings, and Lars Kampmann is the
costume designer. Lighting is
handled by Charles Williams.
Tickets are $2 general admis

BECKETT’S “ENDGAME,” a
play representative of the mod
ern “Theatre of the Absurd,” has
beeen called an end-of-the-world
play in which the world expires
not with an explosion, but “with
a sputter.” It focuses on disin
tegration, death, and debilitation.
Men are shown paralyzed in their
ability to act, slowly moving to
ward death, surrounded by noth
ingness. The master cannot stand
or see, the servant cannot sit.
Parents with no legs live in ash
cans.
The question of escape and
hope in this ultimately desperate
situation is one which Beckett
leaves unanswered. Perhaps, hope
exists; perhaps, it does not.
PAUL WINFIELD, who has
done professional theatre work in
Los Angeles and Hollywood, will
portray Hamm, the master.
Steven Gilborn, last seen as Mac
beth in the Stanford Players’ pro
duction, will play Clov, the ser
vant. Sandra Hunter will play
Nell, the mother, and Larry Bow
en will be Nagg, the father.
The production is directed by
Gordon M. Wickstrom, a graduate
student and director from the
Colorado Shakespeare Festival.
Wendell Cole is designing the set
tings, and Lars Kampmann is the
costume designer. Lighting is
handled by Charles Williams.
Tickets are $2 general admis
sion $1.75 for students. Tickets
