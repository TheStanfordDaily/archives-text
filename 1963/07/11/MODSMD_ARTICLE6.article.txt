# Europe Third World Force; Moving toward Federation
## 
### MIRIAM BETENSKY 
“Europe is a third force cul
turally, economically and to a
large extent politically and is
moving toward a new form of
federation,” stated Raymond F.
Lyons at this week's Tuesday
Evening series lecture.
Lyons is Director of Scientific
Affairs for the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Devel
opment (OECD) in Paris
Since WW II Europe has achiev
ed a new and dynamic existance,
Lyons pointed out, and is a new
source of power among free na
tions, but there are major prob
lems to be solved.
LYONS POINTED out four
characteristics of the new situa
tions: 1) economic recovery; (2)
the great increase in the role of
government; (3) the widening of
social structures; (4) the move
toward federation.
Since 1954 Europe’s rate of
growth has been twice that of
the U.S. In the last eleven years
Europe and the U.S. have re
versed positions completely with
respect to gold reserves and the
U.S. is faced with a balance of
payments pi’oblem.
MOVEMENTS TOWARD both
decolonization and federation are
striking in Europe.
The federation of greatest note
lately is the Common Market.
Lyons attaches importance to the
recent applications to the Mar
ket by Britain, Denmark, Norway
and Ireland. Lyons feels that it
is “eminently desirable” that Eng
land be part of the Common Mar
ket, but he sees the problem as
extremely intricate.

LYONS CONCLUDED that the
“European peoples have a tre
mendous longing lor peace and
continued prosperity.” Continued
federation is the picture in the
future, feels Lyons, and coopera
tion with the United States and
a new Atlantic partnership are
needed.
