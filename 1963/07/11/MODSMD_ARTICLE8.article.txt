# Local CORE Chapter Forms (or Rights Action
## 
### KENT SMITH 
To further the fight for civil
rights, a chapter of the militant
Congress of Racial Equality was
established June 26 for the Palo
Alto-Stanford area.
John Howard was elected Chair
man and Ed Vickery, Vice-Chair
man, at the June organizational
meeting. Becky Gross and Penny
Vickery were selected as Record
ing Secretary and Corresponding
Secretary respectively for the
group.
During its first meetings on
July 3 and 10, the CORE unit
discussed racial discrimination
problems and techniques for com
bating them. Assignments were
made to programs in equal-oppor
tunity employment, fair housing
practices, and police-community
relations.
CORE, founded in Chicago in
1942, is a nation-wide organization
for civil rights headed by James
Farmer. Its purpose, according
to its Constitution, is “to abolish

discrimination based on skin
color, race, religion or national
origin by direct, non-violent ac
tion.”
The Palo Alto-Stanford Chapter
undertook its first action project
last Saturday. In a joint opera
tion with the San Francisco unit,
20 members of the local CORE
group picketed a major rental
agency practicing discrimination
against minority groups.
The agency, Select Rentals of
3315 24th Street in the Potrero
District had, in previous negotia
tions, refused to comply with
CORE demands to eliminate sep
arate listings based on racial
qualifications. The Unrah Civil
Rights Act (Civil Code 51 and
52) of California provides that
such discriminatory service is
illegal.
Because court procedings are
time-consuming and costly, CORE
decided to undertake immediate
direct action. A 12-man picket
line, with 20-minute reserve shifts,
was set up in front of the office;
literature explaining the action
was distributed continuously.
After several hours of picket
ing, Select Rentals requested
further negotiations. The agency
then agreed to accept all of
CORE’S demands; to eliminate
separate listings; to accept all
clients equally; and to advertize
its non-discriminatory services for
a five-month period in three lead
ing area newspapers.
For information about the Palo
Alto Chapter or CORE in gen
eral, call 3261887 or 326-9892.
Public meetings will be held in
Tresidder Union Wednesday eve
nings during the summer.

CORE, founded in Chicago in
1942, is a nation-wide organization
for civil rights headed by James
Farmer. Its purpose, according
to its Constitution, is “to abolish

discrimination based on skin
color, race, religion or national
origin by direct, non-violent ac
tion.”
The Palo Alto-Stanford Chapter
undertook its first action project
last Saturday. In a joint opera
tion with the San Francisco unit,
20 members of the local CORE
group picketed a major rental
agency practicing discrimination
against minority groups.
The agency, Select Rentals of
3315 24th Street in the Potrero
District had, in previous negotia
tions, refused to comply with
CORE demands to eliminate sep
arate listings based on racial
qualifications. The Unrah Civil
Rights Act (Civil Code 51 and
52) of California provides that
such discriminatory service is
illegal.
Because court procedings are
time-consuming and costly, CORE
decided to undertake immediate
direct action. A 12-man picket
line, with 20-minute reserve shifts,
was set up in front of the office;
literature explaining the action
was distributed continuously.
After several hours of picket
ing, Select Rentals requested
further negotiations. The agency
then agreed to accept all of
CORE’S demands; to eliminate
separate listings; to accept all
clients equally; and to advertize
its non-discriminatory services for
a five-month period in three lead
ing area newspapers.

Alto Chapter or CORE in gen

Public meetings will be held in
Tresidder Union Wednesday eve
nings during the summer.
