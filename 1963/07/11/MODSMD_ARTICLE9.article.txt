## Sanders Sees Urban Bay Strip 
### 
The Bay Area is destined to be
come part of an enormous urban
strip extending from Mendocino
County to San Diego, predicted
Harry Sanders, director of plan
ning at Stanford, in the first lec
ture in the summer series on the
Environmental Arts.
Shortly after the year 2000, this
area will have 12-15 million per
sons, and the booming population,
Sanders said, will require many
new facilities:
“BEFORE THE end of this cen
tury, we’ll have to build the equiv
alent of another entire United
States and then some.” California
alone needs 24 new classrooms
each day, Sanders said.
Sanders warned that in plan
ning cities for increased popula
tion “we have to remember the
human factor—that people live
there and have a right to open
space and beauty.”
He delt specifically with plans
for Stanford. The campus will
have a peripheral parkway on the
outskirts in order to leave the
main buildings and living centers
untouched by through traffic.
HE SAID the “quiet heart of the
academic campus” will be main
tained.
The next lecture in this series
open to the public will be next
Wednesday in Geology Lecture
room (320) at 4:15 p.m. Speaking
on “Landscape Design” will be
Lawrence Halprin, President of
Lawrence Halprin and Associates
of San Francisco.
