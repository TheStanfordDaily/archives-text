Stanford’s Workshop in Choral
Music directed by Professor
Harold Schmidt will begin Mon
day, July 22. and continue
through August 16.
Composer Randall Thompson,
Harvard professor of music and
choral composition, will be a visit
ing faculty member for the work
shop. Termed “America’s leading
chorale composer’’ by Professor
Schmidt, Thompson is composing
a chamber choral work with or
chestra to be performed by those
attending the workshop. He will
also give a public lecture and
lead a workshop on "Choral Mu
sic in the American College and
University” during his ten day
stay.
THE NEW WORK, commis
sioned by the Stanford Music De
partment, will be premiered at
Stanford at a public concert of
Thompson’s music during the sec
ond week of August.
In 1958, while Professor Schmidt
was leading the summer chorus
program at Harvard, he commis
sioned another composition by
Thompson. This, “Glory to God
in the Highest,” has since sold
17,000 copies.
The music workshop is design
ed for directors of school, college,
church, and community choral or
ganizations. Work will be cen
tered on advanced practical train
ing in the conducting and analysis
of choral music, with special em
phasis on the contemporary rep
ertoire.
