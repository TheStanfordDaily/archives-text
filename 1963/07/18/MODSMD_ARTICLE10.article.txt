# Excessive Concern with Science Poses Threat to Social Scientist
## 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN Editor 
“Excessive concern with such
devices as theoretical models,
games theory, and war simula
tion, can produce a new scholas
ticism in which science or ‘scien
tism’ immaculately conceived
through mathematics will be
worshiped rather than put to
work on the problems of man
kind,” University of California
political science Professor Peter
Odegard told an audience which
filled Memorial Auditorium for
the joint opening of the Cubberly
Conference and the weekly Tues
day Evening Series.
The neutrality of the hard
nosed social scientist often blinds
him to the greatest problems of
society, the speaker charged.
PROF. ODEGARD character
ized today’s age of science as both
an age of specialization and of
analysis. Analysis, he noted,
means to disintegrate. This pro
g re s s i v e disintegration poses

three problems for the social
scientist today:
1. The gap between appearance
and reality, between the theoreti
cal model and the individual per
sonality.
2. The need for order apd mean
ing among the meaningless pieces
of information.
3. The need for communication

between and within the sciences.
Prof. Odegard suggested one an
swer to the avalanche of scien
tific literature when he advised
an end to ‘publish or perish’ pres
sure on professors in “leading
universities not too far from
where we are.”
“A CENTRAL PARADOX of
modern life is that the very spe
ialization and analysis that have
been pulling man and his world
apart have at the same time made
him more interdependent. That
each man is his brother’s keeper
is a condition of human life,” he
noted.
Because social science is by
definition concerned with men
and society, it is obligated to dis
cover and secure the basic needs
of man. Thus, “there is nothing
sentimental or sloppy about so
cial scientists who are commited
to the rational analysis and eradi
cation of poverty . . . and war, he
said.
“Unless we are willing to put
forth the efforts to lead man into
a more humane society,” Prof.
Odegard concluded, “we shall
surely die.”
