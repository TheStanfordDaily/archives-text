The Stanford Museum, on Lo
mita Drive, carries out a three
pronged artistic function for the
nearly one thousand people who
visit it each week.
Like most museums it is first
of all a depository for painting,
sculpture, and artifacts represent
ing every cultural period. But it
also acts as historian for Stan
ford University and the surround
ing area, and in addition sponsors
occasional programs of artistic
interest.

The best of the donations ob
tained by the Committee for Art
are displayed in a collection rep
resentative of the Oriental,
Egyptian, Classical, Medieval, and
Renaissance cultures.
IN ITS ROLE as historian the
Museum maintains a Stanford
Family Room, containing colorful
momentoes of the University’s
founders. Its display includes a
miniature working model of the
Governor Stanford locomotive
and the original “golden spike”
driven by Governor Stanford to
commemorate the completion of
the transcontinental railway.
Typical of the artistic programs
which the Museum sponsors is
the illustrated lecture which will
be given by Shoji Hamada on
Wednesday, July 24. Hamada is
a Japanese folk potter who in
1955 was designated by his gov
ernment “Intangible Cultural
Treasure” for his forty years of
outstanding work. He will not
only lecture, but will also demon
strate by constructing a pottery
bowl.
In conjunction with the Mu
seum, Stanford operates an Art
Gallery next to the Main Library.
The Gallery’s standing collection
of eighteenth century Venetian
furniture and painting will be
supplemented beginning July 23
by the Fitzhugh Collection of
nearly eighty engravings and
lithographs of such artists as
Degas, Matisse, and Rembrandt.
The Museum is open daily from
1-5 p.m. The Art Gallery is open
from 10-5 Tuesday through Sat
urday, from 1-5 on Sunday, and
is closed Monday.
