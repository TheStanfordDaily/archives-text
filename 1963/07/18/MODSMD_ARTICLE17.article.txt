# Beckett and Endgame: Reviewing the Absurd
## 
### KENT SMITH 
What—MAN? If Beckett says
it, then you cannot hear the
words. But why with no begin
ning should the game have an
end?
“Imagine if a rational being
came back to earth, wouldn’t he
be liable to get ideas into his head
if he observed us long enough,”
the puppeteer makes his tight
stringed Hamm speak. Ideas—
two or more, but not less than
many. Camus rethought in theo
retical suicide. But, didn’t he
know, there was no exit?
Hamm again, in truth: “No one
that ever lived ever thought as
crooked as we.”
No, We're not beginning to
mean something. No. meaning of
meaning is synthetically sense
less. Look closely, with insight.
Which is inside, not looking out
there. See? Nothing. And the
one moment of zero-zero-zero
ought not be more moments less
other moments.
We have decided: We must
wear out the Words. Then wo will
clean out Matter. The choking,
clambering matter smoothering
us. The chairs and coffee cups
and mushrooms filling up every
block of space. Clean away what

matters like busboys. We have
decided.
IF LIFE IS ABSURD— PIays
are Preposterous- Reviews are
Ridiculous.
I saw it differently. Let me see
it that way as my own—alone.
The clear—opaque vision. The
common experience is uncommon
ly good for many reasons and
other people too.
So you see—that you don’t see.
Cleverly now: Break the mirror
—Conventional criticisms bounce
off “Endgame” like shafts of
nutty putty. The Theater of the
Absurd demands a Criticism of
the Absurd.
Out of the enigmatic materials
of the Absurd, the Stanford Play
ers have created a superb produc
tion—a rugged cluster of peaked
experience. If the evening fails,
one must surely blame Beckett.
DIRECTOR GORNON WICK
STROM constructs a chilling
crypt out of his props—both in
animate and breathing. With
great force and discipline, he
squeezes every ounce of death
out of the play.
Particularly refreshing is his
treatment of time. He slows the
pace and places in gaps, followed
closely by outbursts of babble.
Spasms end in long silences. In
a play that is going nowhere,
minutes and moments are mean
ingless. Wickstrom has cleanly
obliterated time.
The director draws forceful
performances out of his several
players. There are no weaknesses.
Only four strong characters in
search of an undertaker. And
Spartans to take the punishment
of Beckett.
From his glazed and punch-card
prologue to his final waiting exit,
Steven Gilborn as Clov is the spec
tre of the shuffling dead. He casts
to perfection the leadish zombie
with soldered speech. “If I don’t
kill that rat,” he mutters madly,
“he’ll die.”
Always a clamped down Clov,
Gilbom breaks only once into
a fierce outcry that yells out his
anguish and suffering. He re
mains the omnipresent figure of
embalmed frustration.
IN HIS INTERPRETATION of
Hamm—the blind master—Pa u 1
Winfield is a ruler-demon. His ver
tuosity almost resurrects the
deadened invalid that Beckett in
tended. His blood-red robe and
face cloth fine costuming by
Lars Kampmann—reveal the gro
tesqueness of the character.
With shrillous voice and chalk
ened cheeks, Sandra Hunter trans
forms into a charmingly hideous
Nell. A macabre harpie gesturing
with bony wings, not arms, she
bleaches out any humanness: “She
has no pulse.”
Larry Bowen’s pitiful, howling
Nagg—Hamm’s father now in his
eighth childhood —is achingly
good. Beating on the garbage cans
which bottle them, this brace of
oldish buzzards merit the epitaph:
Accursed progentiors.
The sleepwalkings and horror
sequences of the play are fittingly
encased in the tomb-like setting by
Wendell Cole. The cold gray and
the clutter of coffins tacked to
the walls project the atmosphere
of a family mausoleum, Charles
Williams’ stark lighting is relent
lessly painful.
THE ADVENTURE INTO
BECKETT, then, breaks up one’s
conventions and one’s expecta
tions. And certainly the play at
points is insanely funny. “End
game” amuses—but first it con
fuses.
Are the gyrations and blather
ings on the stage Life? Has the
fourth wall become a mirror? In
terpretations contradict; no one
of them is correct. Beckett be
lieves we have died of darkness.
Everyone should experience this
black plague of the Absurd once.
