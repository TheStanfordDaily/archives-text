# New Colleges Urgently Needed To Meet Increasing Population
## 
### 
One thousand new colleges will
have to be built in the next fif
teen years to take care of the
nation’s drastically increasing col
lege student population, educa
tional planning expert Dr. Harold
B. Gores declared in a speech
Monday.
One million U.S. college stu
dents are now “unplanned for,”

and this difference between the
number of students that are
scheduled to enroll and the facili
ties planned will be even higher
in the next two years Gores
added.
BURSTING enrollments of tra
tional college age students will
be compounded by vast numbers
of unemployed adults ,who must
be re-educated and re trained.
“The public debate on how to
teach will die out in the lower
schools and flare up in college,”
he predicted, explaining that
Johnny’s parents won’t be happy
when they find out he has to get
his facts on his own, and not
from a teacher.
College teachers will be con
cerned “with values,” he said. The
profession will rise above “its
present low state" of dispensing
information at a speed dictated
by the group.
AMONG THE major problems
of college expansion and new con
struction will be the high cost of
land. Dr. Gores predicted future
campuses will be built “in layers”
as the land runs out.
Dr. Gores was speaking at a
conference on college planning
which concludes tomorrow and
has been attended by about 70
participants from 50 U.S., Cana
dian, and British institutions.
