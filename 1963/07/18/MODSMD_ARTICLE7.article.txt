### 
Albert J. (Mickey) Lima, North
ern California chairman of the
Communist Party, will speak to
morrow on the Berkeley campus
of the University of California.
Lima will be the first Commu

1951. The Board of Regents lifted
the twelve year ban against Com
munist speakers on June 21.
“Problems in the United States
and the Communist Answer” will
be the topic of Lima’s speech. It
is sponsored by SLATE, the
Young Socialist Alliance, and the
W.E.B. Dußois Club, all off-cam
pus student political groups.
In keeping with requirements
set by University officials, the
meeting will be chaired by a ten
ure member of the faculty and the
speaker will be subject to ques
tions from the audience.
A third requirement, “that the
speaker be appropriately balanced
In debate with a person with con
trary opinion,” was waived for
this speech.
