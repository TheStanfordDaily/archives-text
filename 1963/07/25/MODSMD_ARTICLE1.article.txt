# English Teachers Must Research Too: Howard
## 
### Miriam Betensky 
When one asks if professors
are necessary one is asking if
research in the humanities is
something to bother about or is
one opinion as good as another.
“Should the physicist, engineer,
manufacturer be held responsible
lor fact and should the historian,
politician, English scholar, the
person dealing with humans be
allowed to ride on his opinions
no matter what they might be?
Is this the way we should face
the problems of living?”
This is what Leon Howard, pro
fessor of English at UCLA ex
plained he meant by his Tuesday
Evening Lecture topic: “Are Eng
lish Professors Necessary?”
BY UTILIZING “Moby Dick,”
Howard gave examples of five
types of literary research, and
then left his audience to answer
his title question for themselves.
Howard began his talk by point
ing out the professors two ob
vious occupations, teaching and
research.
The first type of research is
that in archieves for original
manuscripts and printed material.
For example, study of the log of
a ship Melville sailed on proved
that he could not have written
certain parts of “Moby Dick”
from personal experience. The
second type of research is related
to the first and is new work in
archives to see how a book was
written.
In Melville’s case letters of
some friends show that a philo
sophical literary discussion at a
picnic Melville attended influ
enced his book.
Source hunting is sometimes
held in contempt Howard admit
ted. Yet this study helps us to
understand the composition of
“Moby Dick.”
THE FOURTH TYPE OF re
search is another type of source
hunting, but for the investigation
of literary influences rather than
factual ones. In Melville’s case,
Howard pointed out, he was

strongly influenced by Hawthorne
and Carlyle.
The final type of research is
to find out what lies beneath the
obvious dramatic situation of a
novel, what are the broader
points.
Concluding, Howard said the
question is whether we should
leave the pursuit of factual truth
to the scientists and leave the
human and subjects leading with
humans to those who think opin
ion is as good as knowledge.
