# Outbursts Criticizing France Mask Atlantic Alliance Crisis
## 
### 
Freewheeling emotional out
bursts against France have mask
ed a genuine crisis in the Atlantic
Alliance, Director Karl Brandt
of Stanford’s Food Research Ins
titute noted in a speech to the
Commonwealth Club last Friday.
Unless the U.S. treats the ma
jor nations of Europe as equal
powers and gives priority to their
current problems, there is real
danger that the same “tragic
drift” in foreign affairs which
developed in 1933 will again en
gulf this country, Brandt said.
By the year’s end, he said, the
U.S. could become preoccupied
with its precarious international
balance of payments, a possible
contraction in business, and the
next Presidential election.

If this happens, “we may have
a good chance of losing the de
cisive Kennedy round in trade
negotiations under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) which begins in Janu
ary in Geneva,” he warned.
“This could well lead to a politi
cal situation in Europe which
would tear the French-led Com
mon Market to pieces in her tug
of-war with the British-led Euro
pean Free Trade Association—
particularly if we favor Germans
against the French on behalf of
the British.”
America, he said, has "vastly
underrated” the strength of the
French economy, which now has
the strongest currency of all the
Common Market countries.
Despite the seriousness of the
current crisis, Brandt said the
long-run prospects for European
economic and political integration
remain “moderately optimistic.”
