# Communist China Rate of Growth Difficult to Maintain During Decade
## 
### 
Communist China’s industry
grew five-fold in the decade of
the ’so’s, but haste, technological
backwardness, and an almost un
reasoned demand for sheer
growth have characterized the
country’s energy resource devel
opment and make it extremely
unlikely that this rate of eco
nomic expansion will be sustained
during this decade.
These are the principal con
clusions of a major new study

by Yuan-li Wu, published this
week under the title “The Eco
nomic Development and Use of
Energy Resources in Communist
China.’’
WU IS A professor of inter
national business at the Univer
sity of San Francisco and a re
search associate at the Hoover
Institution.
In the book, Wu states that
China’s coal and electrical pro
duction grew at an annual rate
of more than twenty-five per
cent between 1949 and 1960, and
this growth powered the indus
trial gains.
Communist planners have been
“overwhelmed by short-term con
siderations at the expense of long
range objectives” and have “more
frequently improvised than plan
ned,” Professor Wu says. “Those
shortcomings are fundamentally
a reflection of the Chinese Com
munist political system and its
ideology.”
THUS “COAL production has
been increased with great waste
fulness of natural deposits and
of manpower badly needed else
where,” he reports.
Wu cites evidence showing that
there still is a serious lag in
mechanization and use of power
driven machinery in Communist
China. “Industrialization is still
at a rudimentary stage," he says.
But on a long-term basis, Pro
fessor Wu believes, there is no
question that Communist China
has the energy resources neces
sary to support a highly indus
trialized economy.
