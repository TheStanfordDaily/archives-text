# Fall Opening Due For White Plaza
## 
### 
Construction begun last week
in the area between the bookstore
and the new and old unions will
not be completed until the start
of the regular school year late
this September, according to Dan
Rolfs of the Planning Office.
The area will then be known as
White Memorial Plaza. The
money for the project, $200,000,
was donated by Mr. and Mrs.
Raymond White of Kansas City
in memory of their two sons,
John and William, former Stan
ford students.
EVEN THOUGH the paving
will be completed by fall, the
planting will not be finished until
November and the sculpture for
the fountain will not be installed
until the first of the year.
The Plaza, being constructed
under the direction of landscape
architect Thomas Church, will
contain extensive landscaping,
outdoor seating, and a central
fountain with ornamental sculp
ture.
The statue is to be a free-form
abstraction. San Francisco sculp
tor Aristides Demetrios was
chosen to design it after a search
of many months in both Europe
and America. He is making the
statue of copper sheet, to which
will be welded bronze textured
metal in a multi-faceted surface
pattern.


CONSTRUCTION OF THE White Memorial Plaza between the Book-store-Post Office area and the Old Union is a source of obstruction
and diversion this summer. Work is scheduled to be completed for
Fall Quarter.
