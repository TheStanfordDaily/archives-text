# Tyler Rakes Social Sciences, Recommends National Centers
## 
### 
Current social studies programs
in American schools are the
“least effective educationally’’ of
any of the basic study areas,
charged Dr. Ralph Tyler in a
speech given last Thursday to
conclude the three-day Cubberley
Conference on Education.
Dr. Tyler, director of the Cen
ter for Advanced Study in the Be
havioral Sciences at Stanford,
called for the establishment of
several national centers which
would produce “a unified and

common sense approach to the
social studies.”
He proposed that the national
study centers should bring to
gether “the cooperative efforts of
university scholars, teachers, and
school administrators to develop
plans for new social studies cur
ricula, try them out, revise them
on the basis of trial and provide
training of the new curriculum.”
The chief reason for the current
inadequacy of the social studies,
Dr. Tyler said, is that “the Ameri
can public and school people are
both confused about (the social
studies’) educational purposes.
“For example,” he said- “his
tory is often confused with the
communication of myths or in
doctrination of students in the
prejudices of their communities.”
“The social studies have been
poorly planned,” he added, “with
out clarity of purpose, the em
phasis to be given, the kind of
materials to be used, and the
sequence to follow.”
“Young people growing up to
day need the understanding, the
appreciation of the values and
skills which history, geography,
economics, anthropology, psy
chology, and sociology can help
provide. We are ready for it and
now is the time to do it.”
