# Summer Opera to Open July 30
## 
### 
“King Theodore in V en 1 c e,”
Paislello’s 18th century opera,
will be sung by two entirely dif
ferent casts next Tuesday and
Wednesday, July 30 and 31 at
8:30 p.m. in Dinkeispiel Audi
torium.

For the work, a presentation of
the Stanford Summer Opera
Workshop, one cast will sing the
first act and another the second

segment of the light-hearted
opera.

THE PLOT concerns the real
life activities of Theodore von
Neuhoff, an ingratiating but pen
niless baron, who in 1736 talked
the Corsicans into electing him
king and leader of an intermittent
war against the Republic of
Genoa.
In an age of charlatans such as
Cagliostro and Casanova, the
baron set some kind of a mark
for unpaid debts and effrontery
in getting himself crowned a le
gitimate, hereditary king.
After handing out titles of no
bility and assembling a splendid
court, King Theodore fled to Eng
land in an attempt to replenish
the Corsican treasury, was caught
and died in a debtor’s prison.
Goldovsky will also lecture on
“King Theodore in Venice” at
4:15 p.m. today in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
On Friday night Goldovsky will
display the talents of the 29 young
Opera Workshop singers who will
participate in “King Theodore”
next week. They will present a
free scene recital consisting of
eight scenes from six famous
operas.
Goldovsky also will offer a free
lecture, “The Language of Music,”
at 4:15 p.m. August 1 in Dinkel
spiel.
PRODUCER and director of the
production is Boris Goldovsky,
leader of the New England Opera
Company and Tanglewood impre
sario, and currently a member of
the University’s Music Depart
ment faculty.
The only exception to the cast
switch between acts is Marvin
Klebe in the title role. Klebe has
sung featured roles with the West
Bay Opera and the San Francisco
Spring Opera. He toured with the
Boris Goldovsky Opera Theater
during the past year.
In Act I, the soprano role of
Lisetta is played by Gwen Little.
She has been a soloist with the
Canadian Opera Company for the
past two years. Her counterpart
in Act II is Sylvia Davis, who has
sung with the San Leandro and
Monterey County sympohnies.
