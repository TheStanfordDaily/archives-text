# Desperation Balanced in Two Plays
## 
### KENT SMITH 
For the Contemporary Theater
Workshop, the Stanford Players
take up again the relationship of
man to man to society in their
new twin-bill program. The ques
tioning of modern man and the
on-crush of society seems to have
infected thought around the
world.
A pair of controversial English
dramatists give us the two treat
ments of existence: the self- anni
hilating comic and the dark, pain
ing tragic. The balance between
the two short plays is well struck.
In “The Dock-Brief”, the first of
the two, John Mortimer explores
the alliance between a doomed de
fendant and his appointed lawyer.
By the time the final verdict is
rendered, both the imposing fig
ure of a British barrister and the
traditional system of law and
justice have been assuredly im
peached.
Director Judith Burgess moves
her two fugitives from injustice
and incompetence well about
Homes Easley’s spare, functional
cell-set. Although it sputters on
occasion, the drama proceeds with
interest and the spirited day
dream scenes come off splendidly.
White-wigged and powdered
down, William Harvey as Morgan
hall tries hard to summon up a
terrorsome advocate. Harvey
reaches the profound failure of
the character only in the final
moments, while reminiscing how
he could have saved his case—
and disgrace.
The murderer Fowle (who
killed his wife for her fun-poking
good humor) becomes a gentle,
understandable figure under
Allan Legge’s interpretation. The
dumpy budgie-lover, well fed
upon his own birdseed, emerges
as the play’s watered-down Na
poleon. Robert Farro is the prop
erly innoculous goalkeep.
The Mortimer piece, despite its
limits in length, is very, very
funny. To the players and the
playwrite go the credits for an
engaging caricature of the Eng
lish bar.
In constrast to the first comedy,
the companion play is a striking
tragedy. Compared to the lengthy
classical works, however, Harold
Pinter’s “The Room” is swift and
deadly, like a modern assassina
tion.
DIRECTOR BURGESS sets
herself to exploiting in depth the
shadowy characters of the lower
class underground of London. By
her efforts, she successfully real
izes the dark truth of Pinter.
Homes Easley’s full-dress,
grimy kitchen—complete to the
smell of frying bacon—ranks as
the most ingenious set of the
summer season. Within the lim
its of the Theater-in-the-Cube,
Easley is a craftsman with imagi
nation.
From the first moments of

cooking eggs and snuffling her
nose to the last desperate screams,
Rosalind Greene as Rose Hudd,
the housewife, is masterfully
touching. Her short step, her own
little world, her desperate insis
tence that “this room is all right
with me,’’ all meld into a marvel
ous creation of the little person
in darkness and pity.
Against Rose’s flood of words,
Michael Morris as Bert Hudd
speaks through his silences. No
where in the play are the com
munication barriers and the con
crete isolation of the individual
more in evidence.
Richard Stack renders the land
lord Mr. Kidd into a self-closeted
old man locked into his own con
cerns. His cheery “Arrivederci”
gives a spot of charm to the weak
and recadent character.
E. Frederick Churchill and Pa
tricia Bower develop Mr. and Mrs.
Sands into a pair of scored and
troubled upper-class Britishers.
Miss Bower exhibits the proper
place and bearing of her role quite
well; Mr. Churchill at times plays
too much the juvenile.
Paul Winfield brings a quiet
insistence and hidden power to
the blind messenger Riley. His
calm and controlled performance
sets up perfectly the on-coming
terror.
The costumes of Jeanette Pratt
fit well to the various characters,
especially to Bert Hudd. Cary
Clasy’s lighting work focusses the
attention upon the action and his
fade-outs set fine time moods.
THE LAUGHTER of Mortimer
and the desperation of Pinter,
then, provide a balance of well
wrought entertainment. The con
tinued quality of the plays and
the productions represent a rare
achievement for the summer pro
grams.
Although the chill comes on
toward the end, the evening once
a week in the open-air Outer
Circle Theater is a delight. “The
Dock-Brief” and “The Room”
play at 8:40 tonight and again
tomorrow and Saturday and Au
gust 1, 2, and 3.
