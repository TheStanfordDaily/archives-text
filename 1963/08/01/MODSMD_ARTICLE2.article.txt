# CORE Pickets Sequoia District; Challenges de facto Segregation
## 
### 
The Palo Alto-Stanford Chapter
of the Congress of Racial Equality
(CORE) has picketed the Sequoia
Union School District Office in
Redwood City since July 30 to pro
test de facto segregation in the
district’s high schools.
The picketing action, conducted
jointly by CORE and the South
San Mateo County NAACP, was
planned “to dramatize the prob
lem” to the general public. More
than 40 members of the local chap
ter took part in the protest.
CORE and NAACP leaders
promised to continue picketing
every day from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
through today. The groups then
plan a large turn-out tonight to
support their cause at the district’s
Board of Trustees Meeting.
Picket leaders charged that the
Board, in decisions last March, had
“adopted attendance areas which
fail to utilize existing capacity at
Ravenswood, and more signifi
cantly, continue de facto segrega
tion at Ravenswood.”
At a recent organizational meet
ing, CORE Chairman John Howard
appointed chairmen to the chap
ter’s five major committees: Jerry
Jackson, Direct Action Committee;
A1 Gross, Housing; Phil Cohen,
Employment: Kent Smith, Public
Relations: and Joyce Houston,
Fund Raising.
Founded to combat racial dis
crimination, the local CORE unit

has approximately 100 members,
mostly mid-peninsula residents
and students.
CORE will cosponsor a folk
music concert by Pete Seeger and
the Freedom Singers at 7 p.m. on
August 17 at Searsville Lake Park
in Woodside. The $2.50 tickets may
be obtained by mail from Joyce
Houston (YO 7-8867) at 1398 Dale
Avenue, Mountain View.
The Palo Alto-Stanford Chapter
will hold its first public meeting at
7:30 on Wednesday, August 7 at
1115 Berkeley in East Palo Alto.
