# Campus to Have Latin American House
## 
### 
A group of United States and
foreign students with common in
terests in Latin America are go
ing to live together beginning this
fall in a wing of Stern Hall which
has been designated “Latin
America House.”
The purpose of the plan, accord
ing to Fred Goff, one of the
founders, is “to extend education
into the residence hall, to make
one’s living experience a real op
portunity to learn.”
THE IDEA for the program
came from Goff, a Stanford soph
omore from Colombia: Stuart
Rawlings, a sophomore now trav
eling in Peru; and Holt Ruffin,

a freshman who has lived most
of his life in Brazil.
The three planners have a host
of ideas for developing the house
with special programs, house con
ferences and guests-in-residenct.
THE GROUP is planning to
have language tables, to show
Latin American films, to furnish
the lounges with Latin American
books, and periodicals, and to set
up a short-wave radio to keep in
touch with Latin American
“hams.”
Also planned for the future is
the establishment of a Latin
American counterpart to the
Crossroads Africa project.
