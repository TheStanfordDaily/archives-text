# Melon Feed, Picnic, Dance, Hockey Highlight Weekend
## 
### 
A combined all-campus water
melon feed, picnic, and dance will
be held on Saturday beginning at
4 p.m. in the playing field of the
woman’s gym.

These activities will be proceed
ed by a hockey match between
Cal and Stanford beginning at 2
p.m. The watermelon feed and
“spontaneous” games will begin
at 4 p.m. Volleyball, a non-violent
co-ed football game, and swim
ming are also planned for the
afternoon. Children will not be
allowed in the pool during the
time of the picnic.
The picnic is scheduled for 6
p.m. All holders of seven day meal
tickets at Lagunita Court and
Wilbur Hall will have a free pic
nic dinner instead of eating at
their dormitories. But they must
arrive before 6:30 in order to be
served. According to food service
regulations, the sale of dinner
tickets for off-campus people was
closed yesterday. Those people
planning to stay for the picnic
should bring their own dinners.
The dinner menu includes spa
ghetti, green salad and french
dressing, tea rolls, butter, milk,
and an ice cream cup.
At 7:30 p.m. the group will
move across the street to the
Lagunita dining hall for the
dance, which is free of charge
and open to the entire campus.
THE SATURDAY program is
sponsored by summer LASSU. It
is the culminating activity of the
legislature and the highlight of
summer recreation programs.
John Congdon is in charge of the
watermelon feed, and Dave Welsh
and Jean Eberhardt head the
dance committee.
Traditionally LASSU has held
two watermelon feeds, but be
cause of high student response,
LASSU decided to hold the triple

program. The dance replaces the
usual summer dance held off
campus.
“THE PICNIC and dance,
which replace the usual run-of
the-mill summer functions, will
provide a most interesting, en
joyable way to spend the final
eight hours of an excellent Sat
urday afternoon. And we are ex
pecting good weather,” John
Congdon states. “We’re spending
lots of money to buy lots of
watermelon for lots of people.
Come by and have lots of fun.”
Congdon also invited those in
terested to come and watch him
“worry through another water
melon feed.” His invitation in
cluded an opportunity to help pick
up watermelon rinds immediately
following the feed.
