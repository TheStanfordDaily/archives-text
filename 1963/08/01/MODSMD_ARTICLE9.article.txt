# Elder Talks on Environment, Architecture Styles
## 
### Fred Wanick 
“Does environment shape man,
primarily, or does man shape his
environment? And what role does
architecture play in an environ
ment that primarily shapes or is
shaped by man?”
These were the questions posed
by Harry Elder, Dean of the
School of Architecture in Van
couver (University of British Co
lumbia) in two lectures on Art
and Architecture in his July visit
to the campus.
Elder’s answer? That man, in
deed, does shape his environment.
The organism uses “energy” to
“organize” his environment, de
fined as a series of “unorganized”
conditions outside an organism.
The “organized” environment is
in the condition of the “steady
state.”
The inspiration—the fount, the
very impulse —for the mainte
nance of life and the sustenance
of the steady state in the human
organism relies on the expression

of art.
“ART ALLOWS the organism
the freedom to express itself with
out obligation,” Elder stated.
If architecture cannot rally oc
casional moments of personal
justification for living, then it
may be a thoroughly misunder
stood, if not lost, art form.
In his first speech on the analy
sis of architectural styles of vari
ous cultures, Elder theorized that
any given style experiences its
conception, birth, growth, flower
ing, maturing, decay, and death.
He hypothesized that just as
one architectural style grows to
its height—its flowering—the con
ception of the subsequent style
occurs. And as the old style
whithers and dies, the new style
is born, and grows to its flower
ing stage.
The current modern trend flow
ered in the 1930’5, and is now
refining itself in the elegance of
maturity. The birth pangs of a
new style were felt in the early
20th century—with the concept
of e = me 2.
THE ARCHITECTURAL style
of a culture often relates to that
culture’s interpretation of the uni
verse, Elder noted. From Einstein
there has developed a current
notion that the universe is ex
panding and infinite, but bounded.
The current modern style reflects

an understanding of an infinite
and unbounded universe. It is end
less, in a sense, in that it is pos
sible to add and add unit ele
ments, or modules.
The Greek, Gothic, and Modern
are featured by a modular concept
—you can add or take away the
unit elements. Roman and Ren
aissance are complete, or organic,
and one cannot add or take away
parts of buildings in these styles.
FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT was
the last glorious ember of the
Renaissance concept — as his
buildings were usually organic
and complete, not modular. In
this sense, then, Wright was not
“modern” at all. That Wright is
the “father of modem architec
ture” is more a convenient cliche
of the “sellers” of architecture,
than it is a truism, in this con
text.
The Bauhaus School founded by
Walter Gropius, and Mies van der
Rohe is more typical of the mod
ern style featuring the module.
“The nature of architectural
styles is that they seem to last
for several generations. Thus, the
‘new’ style — though growing —
will not flower for some time, and
by then ‘modern’ architecture will
be in its death throes.”
