# "DER HOFMEISTER"OPENS TONIGHT
## 
### 
The English language premiere of "Der Hofmeisfer"
("The Tutor") by Bertolt Brecht will be performed to
night in Memorial Auditorium at 8:40 p.m. before an
audience which will include drama critics from across
the nation.
The play, to be given tomorrow and Saturday nights
as well as tonight, is the final production of the sum
mer for the Stanford Contemporary Theater Workshop.
The Brecht work is being directed by Carl Weber,
directing assistant to Brecht in the Berliner Ensemble
until 1956 and then director until 1961. "Der Hofmei
ster" deals with the position of an intellectual in a
hostile, anti-Intel lectual society. In the play, the
tutor or schoolmaster is forced to destroy his own crea
tive power.
J.M. Svendsen, a teacher at the Berkeley campus of
Cal, will play Lauffer, the tutor. Eugene Miller, di
rector of the Workshop production of "The Room", is
Parson Lauffer. Gordon M. Wlckstrom, who directed
this summer's " Endgame," plays Privy Councillor von
Berg.
Among the critics who have accepted invitations to
attend are Henry Hughes of "The Saturday Review,"
Leota Diesel, editor of "Theater Arts: magazine, John
Simon of "The Hudson Review," and Brendan Gill of
"The New Yorker."
Tickets, available at the Tresidder Box Office, are
priced $2.50, $2.00, and $1.50 with student reduc
tions of 25 cents on each type ticket.
