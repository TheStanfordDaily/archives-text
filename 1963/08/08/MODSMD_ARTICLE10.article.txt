# FAREWELL

### 
We said Inflation and lack of funds couldn't
silence the voice of the press, but they have
forced the Weekly to appear in abbreviated
mimeograph form. The staff wishes to thank the
University News Service, particularly Gertrudr
Naylor, Bob Lamar, and Pat Black, for their
cooperation and assistance which made possible
the publication of this paper.
