# Tribe To Open '63 Season Against San Jose Tomorrow
## 
### JUSTIN BECK 
Coach John Ralston's Indians get their first test of the 19(33 sea
son tomorrow against San Jose State. Kickoff for the game is 1:30
p.m. in Stanford Stadium. The game against San Jose is Ralston's
first as head of the Indians.
While the personnel is much the same as last year when the

►Indians finished with a 5-5 record,
Ralston has made several
•hanges, the biggest being the
switching of last year's first
string quarterback Steve Thur
low to halfback. Also switched
was reserve quarterback and de
fensive back Dick Ragsdale ti
no other halfback spot.
Up to now the change ha.
ooktd very good with both Rags
dale and Thurlow running quite
well from their new positions and
Clark Weaver, the hold-over quai
erback and star of last year':
Big Game, passing better thai
last year.
For tomorrow's game the only
unsettled backfield position is
fulback where either Ken Baba
jian, the number two rusher on
last year's squad, or sophomore
Glenn Myers will start.
LAST YEAR'S regular left half,
J. D. Lodato, and sophomore Ray
Handley. a standout from last
year's frosh squad, provide con
siderable backfield reserve. Lo
dato was the team's leading
rusher last year with 357 yards.
Like Stanford, San Jose has
much of its team returning. And
the Spartans have great backfield
strength. Bob Titchenal's teams
at SJS have always had good
speed and this year's is no excep
tion.
PKOBABLY TIIE FASTEST in
the group is Walt Roberts, a 167
pounder who has run the 100 in
9.7. Robert's has one 92 yard run
to his credit and was the second
leading rusher for the Spartans
last year. At flanker is another
speedster, Dave Roberts, their
leading receiver last year. An
other returning letterman is
starting quarterback Rand Car
eer, who completed almost 60 per
cent of his passes last year. Char
ley Harraway, a 220 lb. sopho-

more fullback will probably also
do a lot of running.
Stanford's line probably holds
an edge in tomorrow's game.
Marv Harris, an All-Coast guard
last year, has been switched to
center lo replace graduated C. B.
Simons. The 217 pound Harris is
regarded as one of Ihe lop line
men ever to play at Stanford and
could he one of the best centers
in the country this year.
The rest of the Tribe line is big
and experienced. One candidate
for Ail-Coast honors is end Frank
Patitucci. Patitucci was the
squad's leading pass receiver last


WALT ROBERTS
Spartan Speedster
