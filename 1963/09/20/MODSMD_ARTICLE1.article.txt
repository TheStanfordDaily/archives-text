# Tribe To Open '63 Season Against San Jose Tomorrow
## 
### JUSTIN BECK 
Coach John Ralston's Indians get their first test of the 19(33 sea
son tomorrow against San Jose State. Kickoff for the game is 1:30
p.m. in Stanford Stadium. The game against San Jose is Ralston's
first as head of the Indians.
While the personnel is much the same as last year when the

►Indians finished with a 5-5 record,
Ralston has made several
•hanges, the biggest being the
switching of last year's first
string quarterback Steve Thur
low to halfback. Also switched
was reserve quarterback and de
fensive back Dick Ragsdale ti
no other halfback spot.
Up to now the change ha.
ooktd very good with both Rags
dale and Thurlow running quite
well from their new positions and
Clark Weaver, the hold-over quai
erback and star of last year':
Big Game, passing better thai
last year.
For tomorrow's game the only
unsettled backfield position is
fulback where either Ken Baba
jian, the number two rusher on
last year's squad, or sophomore
Glenn Myers will start.
LAST YEAR'S regular left half,
J. D. Lodato, and sophomore Ray
Handley. a standout from last
year's frosh squad, provide con
siderable backfield reserve. Lo
dato was the team's leading
rusher last year with 357 yards.
Like Stanford, San Jose has
much of its team returning. And
the Spartans have great backfield
strength. Bob Titchenal's teams
at SJS have always had good
speed and this year's is no excep
tion.
PKOBABLY TIIE FASTEST in
the group is Walt Roberts, a 167
pounder who has run the 100 in
9.7. Robert's has one 92 yard run
to his credit and was the second
leading rusher for the Spartans
last year. At flanker is another
speedster, Dave Roberts, their
leading receiver last year. An
other returning letterman is
starting quarterback Rand Car
eer, who completed almost 60 per
cent of his passes last year. Char
ley Harraway, a 220 lb. sopho-

more fullback will probably also
do a lot of running.
Stanford's line probably holds
an edge in tomorrow's game.
Marv Harris, an All-Coast guard
last year, has been switched to
center lo replace graduated C. B.
Simons. The 217 pound Harris is
regarded as one of Ihe lop line
men ever to play at Stanford and
could he one of the best centers
in the country this year.
The rest of the Tribe line is big
and experienced. One candidate
for Ail-Coast honors is end Frank
Patitucci. Patitucci was the
squad's leading pass receiver last

Spartan Speedster
year, and so far this fall has
looked even better.
Chuck McCormick will start
tomorrow at the other end, al
though junior Boh Howard will
also see some? action. Howard has
been troubled all fall with a foot
injury and has not yet recovered.
Last year, however, he was sec
ond in receptions.
THK BIGGEST loss in the in
terior line was Frank Atkinson, a
regular tackle last year. Most of
the rest of the line is returning.
The probable starters for tomor
row's game will be Al Hildebrand
or Chuck Hartwig at left tackle,
Jack Chappie at left guard. John
Wilbur or Frank Dubofsky at
right guard, and Bob Nichols at
right tackle. All except Wilbur
lettered last year.
The Spartan line lacks the size
and the quality of Stanford, al
though several regulars are re
turning, mainly Walter First
brook a 21.") pound tackle and
guard Larry Hansen, a starting
tackle last year.
Stanford's offense this year will
probably feature more running
than iii the past few seasons, but
Ra ; on is committed to neither i
ground or airial attack. The
formation will be much the same
as l;ist year. On defense the ends
will be linebackers, the guards
ends; and the center middle
guard. The fullback will be a line
backer.
One of lialston's toughest prob
lems will he coping with the Spar
tan speed. While the Indians may
be somewhat faster than last
year, San Jose still holds a big
margin in that department. If
anything can heal Stanford to
morrow il wil be the speed of run

ners like Roberts and Johnson.
Stanford is an early IT point
favorite tomorrow, but it isn't
going to be that easy. And Coach
Ralston, for one, isn't taking any
chances.

last year's squad, or sophomore
Glenn Myers will start.
LAST YEAR'S regular left half,
J. D. Lodato, and sophomore Ray
Handley. a standout from last
year's frosh squad, provide con
siderable backfield reserve. Lo
dato was the team's leading
rusher last year with 357 yards.
Like Stanford, San Jose has
much of its team returning. And
the Spartans have great backfield
strength. Bob Titchenal's teams
at SJS have always had good
speed and this year's is no excep
tion.
PKOBABLY TIIE FASTEST in
the group is Walt Roberts, a 167
pounder who has run the 100 in
9.7. Robert's has one 92 yard run
to his credit and was the second
leading rusher for the Spartans
last year. At flanker is another
speedster, Dave Roberts, their
leading receiver last year. An
other returning letterman is
starting quarterback Rand Car
eer, who completed almost 60 per
cent of his passes last year. Char
ley Harraway, a 220 lb. sopho-

more fullback will probably also
do a lot of running.
Stanford's line probably holds
an edge in tomorrow's game.
Marv Harris, an All-Coast guard
last year, has been switched to
center lo replace graduated C. B.
Simons. The 217 pound Harris is
regarded as one of Ihe lop line
men ever to play at Stanford and
could he one of the best centers
in the country this year.
The rest of the Tribe line is big
and experienced. One candidate
for Ail-Coast honors is end Frank
Patitucci. Patitucci was the
squad's leading pass receiver last

year, and so far this fall has
looked even better.
Chuck McCormick will start
tomorrow at the other end, al
though junior Boh Howard will
also see some? action. Howard has
been troubled all fall with a foot
injury and has not yet recovered.
Last year, however, he was sec
ond in receptions.
THK BIGGEST loss in the in
terior line was Frank Atkinson, a
regular tackle last year. Most of
the rest of the line is returning.
The probable starters for tomor
row's game will be Al Hildebrand
or Chuck Hartwig at left tackle,
Jack Chappie at left guard. John
Wilbur or Frank Dubofsky at
right guard, and Bob Nichols at
right tackle. All except Wilbur
lettered last year.
The Spartan line lacks the size
and the quality of Stanford, al
though several regulars are re
turning, mainly Walter First
brook a 21.") pound tackle and
guard Larry Hansen, a starting
tackle last year.
Stanford's offense this year will
probably feature more running
than iii the past few seasons, but
Ra ; on is committed to neither i
ground or airial attack. The
formation will be much the same
as l;ist year. On defense the ends
will be linebackers, the guards
ends; and the center middle
guard. The fullback will be a line
backer.
One of lialston's toughest prob
lems will he coping with the Spar
tan speed. While the Indians may
be somewhat faster than last
year, San Jose still holds a big
margin in that department. If
anything can heal Stanford to
morrow il wil be the speed of run

ners like Roberts and Johnson.
Stanford is an early IT point
favorite tomorrow, but it isn't
going to be that easy. And Coach
Ralston, for one, isn't taking any
chances.

ley Harraway, a 220 lb. sopho-

more fullback will probably also
do a lot of running.
Stanford's line probably holds
an edge in tomorrow's game.
Marv Harris, an All-Coast guard
last year, has been switched to
center lo replace graduated C. B.
Simons. The 217 pound Harris is
regarded as one of Ihe lop line
men ever to play at Stanford and
could he one of the best centers
in the country this year.
The rest of the Tribe line is big
and experienced. One candidate
for Ail-Coast honors is end Frank
Patitucci. Patitucci was the
squad's leading pass receiver last

year, and so far this fall has
looked even better.
Chuck McCormick will start
tomorrow at the other end, al
though junior Boh Howard will
also see some? action. Howard has
been troubled all fall with a foot
injury and has not yet recovered.
Last year, however, he was sec
ond in receptions.
THK BIGGEST loss in the in
terior line was Frank Atkinson, a
regular tackle last year. Most of
the rest of the line is returning.
The probable starters for tomor
row's game will be Al Hildebrand
or Chuck Hartwig at left tackle,
Jack Chappie at left guard. John
Wilbur or Frank Dubofsky at
right guard, and Bob Nichols at
right tackle. All except Wilbur
lettered last year.
The Spartan line lacks the size
and the quality of Stanford, al
though several regulars are re
turning, mainly Walter First
brook a 21.") pound tackle and
guard Larry Hansen, a starting
tackle last year.
Stanford's offense this year will
probably feature more running
than iii the past few seasons, but
Ra ; on is committed to neither i
ground or airial attack. The
formation will be much the same
as l;ist year. On defense the ends
will be linebackers, the guards
ends; and the center middle
guard. The fullback will be a line
backer.
One of lialston's toughest prob
lems will he coping with the Spar
tan speed. While the Indians may
be somewhat faster than last
year, San Jose still holds a big
margin in that department. If
anything can heal Stanford to
morrow il wil be the speed of run

ners like Roberts and Johnson.
Stanford is an early IT point
favorite tomorrow, but it isn't
going to be that easy. And Coach
Ralston, for one, isn't taking any
chances.
The lineups:

Coach John Ralston's Indians get their first test of the 19(33 sea
son tomorrow against San Jose State. Kickoff for the game is 1:30
p.m. in Stanford Stadium. The game against San Jose is Ralston's
first as head of the Indians.
While the personnel is much the same as last year when the

►Indians finished with a 5-5 record,
Ralston has made several
•hanges, the biggest being the
switching of last year's first
string quarterback Steve Thur
low to halfback. Also switched
was reserve quarterback and de
fensive back Dick Ragsdale ti
no other halfback spot.
Up to now the change ha.
ooktd very good with both Rags
dale and Thurlow running quite
well from their new positions and
Clark Weaver, the hold-over quai
erback and star of last year':
Big Game, passing better thai
last year.
For tomorrow's game the only
unsettled backfield position is
fulback where either Ken Baba
jian, the number two rusher on
last year's squad, or sophomore
Glenn Myers will start.
LAST YEAR'S regular left half,
J. D. Lodato, and sophomore Ray
Handley. a standout from last
year's frosh squad, provide con
siderable backfield reserve. Lo
dato was the team's leading
rusher last year with 357 yards.
Like Stanford, San Jose has
much of its team returning. And
the Spartans have great backfield
strength. Bob Titchenal's teams
at SJS have always had good
speed and this year's is no excep
tion.
PKOBABLY TIIE FASTEST in
the group is Walt Roberts, a 167
pounder who has run the 100 in
9.7. Robert's has one 92 yard run
to his credit and was the second
leading rusher for the Spartans
last year. At flanker is another
speedster, Dave Roberts, their
leading receiver last year. An
other returning letterman is
starting quarterback Rand Car
eer, who completed almost 60 per
cent of his passes last year. Char
