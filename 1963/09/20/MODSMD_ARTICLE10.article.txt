# We Do Not Want A 'Happy University'
## 
### 
The class of 1967 could easily pass four isolated years
luxuriating in the climate and the wealth of Stanford Univer
sity.
The Stanford freshman has intellectual and material re
sources which form a combination that can be matched by a
mere handful of groups on earth. In the face of adversity
students from Mississippi to South Viet Nam band together
to bring about a community free to nurture intellectual fer
ment. In the face of privilege one could rationalize a life of
quietly underlining text books, taking notes, and computing
grade-point—challenging nothing, isolated from the respon
sibilities inherent in a community of scholars.
A high-ranking Stanford administrator noted to a faculty
member last year, "I want to run a happy university." "Happy"
would seem the last in an infinite list of adjectives to be ap
plied to the ideal academic community. The other adjectives
all pertain to the clash of idea against idea and the hewing
of a climate that will permit this clash.
In the past two years, student demands for creative change
have become numerous and intelligent. In 1962 a referendum
was passed re-joining Stanford to the United States National
Student Association—our most forceful link with the domestic
and world student community. That same year a referendum
passed demanding a revision of Stanford's antiquated liquor
policy. The referendum's request was rejected as was a third
cause celcbrc of that year: co-educational housing.
In 1963, under the leadership of ASSU president Armin
Rosencranz, students gained representation on several Uni
versity committees and gained formal recognition of their
right to speak out on controversial issues and organize as
political bodies.
As we approach 1964 we are a university without freedom
of religion on the campus. Rather than entertain all religious
groups within the campus structure, we bar all. We are a
university from which a professor can be dismissed without
being given the reason why from the person responsible for his
dismissal. We are a university whose student judicial struc
ture is operated by students only in a limited number of cases.
We are a university which harbors fraternities with discrim
inatory clauses. We still have the same liquor policy, univer
sity committees without student representation do not even
have co-educational dining facilities.
Current ASSU president Bud Wedin is the same type of
leader of action who brought past advances. The Stanford
faculty has never refused to join with the students to bring
about constructive change.
It is from these advances it is hoped the class of 1967 will
not isolate itself, accepting a sincere welcome to a community
of scholars and resting content with a "happy university."
