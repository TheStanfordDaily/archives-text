## GOP Asks Balanced Budget As Price for Tax Cut Support 
### 
WASHINGTON — The House Republican Policy Committee lined
up almost solidly yesterday behind a drive to kill the $11 billion tax
cutting bill unless it includes specific new curbs against deficit fed
eral spending.
The administration backed bill on which House debate opens next
Tuesday would reduce taxes $7 billion on 1963 incomes, with an addi
tional $4 billion in tax relief scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 1965.
Adoption of the Republican amendment would automatically can
cel the second tax cut, unless Kennedy retrenched on his spending
during the current year and held to $98 billion the fiscal 1965 spend
ing budget to be presented in January.
More British Scandal—London —The British government an
nounced yesterday it will publish in full the potentially explosive
Denning report on the nation's sex and security scandal next week
as a White Paper.
The decision to tell all came after two cabinet meetings and a
face-to-face confrontation between Prime Minister Harold Macmillan
and Labor Party leader Harold Wilson.
Soviet Aid to India-London—Diplomatic sources reported the
Soviet Union has quietly doubled her aid offers to India, apparently
to bolster Indian strength against Comunist China. The report coin
cided with a Pravda article flatly blaming Red China for the Sino-
Indian border fighting.
Goldwater Affainst Test Ban—Washington—Sen. Barry Gold
water, R.-Ariz., said yesterday he will vote against ratifivation of
the nuclear test ban treaty even if it means "political suicide."
Asserting that the treaty was "detrimental to the strength of my
country," the GOP presidential possibility said, "It is not my future
that concerns me. It is my country—and what my conscience tells
me is how best I may serve it."
