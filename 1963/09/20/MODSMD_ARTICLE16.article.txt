# Frosh Find 'Altered' Campus
## 
### 
Vacation was over Wednesday (at least theoretically) for the
new freshmen who entered the campus armed with maps, and Stan
ford handbooks against a busy schedule of meetings, speeches, and
orientation during pre-reg week. This year frosh will find the cam
pus somewhat different from that seen by preceding classes.

They will find their way to the*
bookstore and post office (esen
tial during pre-reg week) ob
structed by construction work on
White Memorial Plaza. However,
unrecognizable it may as a plaza
now, the area will eventually
contain extensive landscaping,
outdoor seating and a central
fountain with an ornamental
sculpture. The plaza is a gift to
PACE by Mi-, and Mrs. Raymond
R. White of Kansas City in mem
ory of their two sons.
IX ADDITION, there is Math
corner (formerly physics corner)
on the northwest section of t he
Quad. Face-lifting in this area is
not yet completed, but will eventu
ally result in more and improved
classrooms.
Freshmen will also soon become
familiar with Roble (ROH-blee),
Branner, Wilbur and Stern Halls,
in all of which groups of them
will be housed. Roble, housing
about two-thirds of the freshman
girls, differs from Branner, the
other freshman women s dorm,
primarily in its lack of a strategic
location.
Branner is comfortably situated
in the midst of the men's housing
complex of Toyon, Wilbur, and
Stern, and was itself once a men's
dorm. Roble is next to the pres
ently un-lakeliko Lake Lag; frosh
from Wilbur and Stern usually
find its scenery worth the walk.
WILBUR IS the largest dorm
on campus, with 720 men in eight
houses; it will be the scene of the
inevitable Jollyup. Stern Hall is
unique in being the only dorm
with both freshmen and upper
classmen; freshmen there are un
der the guidance of Resident As
histants rather than sponsors, as
in the other three dorms.
Other buildings of importance
on campus will also gradually be
come familiar. In the process
freshmen will become acquainted
with the associated jargon of ab
breviations: Civ Libe (all too fa
miliar). Mem Aud, Hoo Tow, Flo
Mo, Dink, and even Fun Stan.
LATER ON, as they become
more deeply involved in campus
life, freshmen will become aware
of a campus atmosphere w hi c h
will be somewhat different than
last year's. In student govern
ment, for instance, there is a new
constitution which was approved
by the trustees last March. It pro
vides for a larger student legisla
ture (LASSU) in an effort to give
all living groups fair representa
tion.
Class government (except for
seniors) was formally abolished
last spring. Last year's freshman
class executive committee began
the move by dissolving their own
organizat ion.
Despite some argument con
cerning the validity of their action
(the rest of the class was not con
sulted*, the issue was referred to
the ballot of the undergraduate
classes, who rejected their govern
ments in a fairly close vote.
A N O T II E R CONTROVERSY
began last spring when the Peace
Caucus, held a continuous vigil on
the Quad ;ind in front of President
Sterling's home protesting the
failure of the University to clarify
the reasons behind the fallout sys
tem installed on campus.
Students participating were at
first threatened with suspension
if they did not cease the vigil in
"private residential areas."
The vigil ended as the adminis
tration's attitude softened; peti
tions were circulated asking for'

open discussion of the shelters.
This was evenlually provided in
the form of a Stanford Today
and-Tomorrow panel of adminis
tration officials.
IN THE WORDS of a Daily edi
torial, this discussion was "a sig
nificant turning point in the his
tory of student-Administration re
lations at Stanford . . . the Ad
ministration has publicly recog
nized that it is proper to inform
the Stanford community publicly
of their reasons for taking con
troversial policy stands, and to al
low members of the Administra
tion to be questioned about these
stands." (May 17, 1963.)
Also in the new constitution are
provisions for greater student op
portunity to form groups and
speak out on public issues. The
need for such provisions was felt
last year during a student and
administration incident concern
ing KPFA, a radio station being
investigated by the HUAC on
charges of communist activity.
ASSU PRESIDENT Armin Ros
encranz, speaking for the ASSU,
wrote a public letter denouncing
the investigation. The adminis
tration then denounced his action
and stated that the ASSU could
not take public stands on partisan
issues since their stand might in
volve an improper use of the uni
versity's name.
Under Ihe new constitution and
the accompanying statement by
the trustees of policy concerning
collective expression, the ASSU
still may not express partisan
viewpoints, but smaller groups

who wish to speak out find forma
tion easier, and partisan groups
such as the Young Democrats or
Republicians cui be allowed to
use university facilities for meet
ings and programs.
TAKING IMMEDIATE advan
tage of the trustees' statement, a
group of students formed the Stu
dent Congress, intended as a ve
hicle for collective student expres
sion on any topic.
These are some of the events
which will shape the form fresh
men will see student affairs and
activities take this year. That last

| year was an active one can be
shown by quoting from another
Daily editorial, this one a year
ago:
. . even today the Young Re
publicans and the Young Demo
crats are noi allowed to function
on campus ... At Harvard these
prohibitions would be considered
absurd and even irresponsible.
Perhaps in ten years these pro
hibitions will be considered in the
same light at Stanford. Perhaps
not, if students are unwilling to
pres the University." Sept. 21,
1962.)

SEVERAL MEMBERS of the Freshman Class of 1967, either lost or just plain curious, study a scale

not, if students are unwilling to

FRESHMEN AT WILBUR after the picnic yesterday enjoying a game
of push ball. Or is it crab ball: Jacks, maybe, Anyway everyone
seems to be having a ball, or is it vice versa?


SEVERAL MEMBERS of the Freshman Class of 1967, either lost or just plain curious, study a scale
model of the Stanford campus presently on display upstairs in Tresidder Memorial Union. In addi
tion to already existing structures, the model shows future buildings to be constructed under the
PACE program.
Vacation was over Wednesday (at least theoretically) for the
new freshmen who entered the campus armed with maps, and Stan
ford handbooks against a busy schedule of meetings, speeches, and
orientation during pre-reg week. This year frosh will find the cam
pus somewhat different from that seen by preceding classes.

They will find their way to the*
bookstore and post office (esen
tial during pre-reg week) ob
structed by construction work on
White Memorial Plaza. However,
unrecognizable it may as a plaza
now, the area will eventually
contain extensive landscaping,
outdoor seating and a central
fountain with an ornamental
sculpture. The plaza is a gift to
PACE by Mi-, and Mrs. Raymond
R. White of Kansas City in mem
ory of their two sons.
IX ADDITION, there is Math
corner (formerly physics corner)
on the northwest section of t he
Quad. Face-lifting in this area is
not yet completed, but will eventu
ally result in more and improved
classrooms.
Freshmen will also soon become
familiar with Roble (ROH-blee),
Branner, Wilbur and Stern Halls,
in all of which groups of them
will be housed. Roble, housing
about two-thirds of the freshman
girls, differs from Branner, the
other freshman women s dorm,
primarily in its lack of a strategic
location.
Branner is comfortably situated
in the midst of the men's housing
complex of Toyon, Wilbur, and
Stern, and was itself once a men's
dorm. Roble is next to the pres
ently un-lakeliko Lake Lag; frosh
from Wilbur and Stern usually
find its scenery worth the walk.
WILBUR IS the largest dorm
on campus, with 720 men in eight
houses; it will be the scene of the
inevitable Jollyup. Stern Hall is
unique in being the only dorm
with both freshmen and upper
classmen; freshmen there are un
der the guidance of Resident As
histants rather than sponsors, as
in the other three dorms.
Other buildings of importance
on campus will also gradually be
come familiar. In the process
freshmen will become acquainted
with the associated jargon of ab
breviations: Civ Libe (all too fa
miliar). Mem Aud, Hoo Tow, Flo
Mo, Dink, and even Fun Stan.
LATER ON, as they become
more deeply involved in campus
life, freshmen will become aware
of a campus atmosphere w hi c h
will be somewhat different than
last year's. In student govern
ment, for instance, there is a new
constitution which was approved
by the trustees last March. It pro
vides for a larger student legisla
ture (LASSU) in an effort to give
all living groups fair representa
tion.
Class government (except for
seniors) was formally abolished
last spring. Last year's freshman
class executive committee began
the move by dissolving their own
organizat ion.
Despite some argument con
cerning the validity of their action
(the rest of the class was not con
sulted*, the issue was referred to
the ballot of the undergraduate
classes, who rejected their govern
ments in a fairly close vote.
A N O T II E R CONTROVERSY
began last spring when the Peace
Caucus, held a continuous vigil on
the Quad ;ind in front of President
Sterling's home protesting the
failure of the University to clarify
the reasons behind the fallout sys
tem installed on campus.
Students participating were at
first threatened with suspension
if they did not cease the vigil in
"private residential areas."
The vigil ended as the adminis
tration's attitude softened; peti
tions were circulated asking for'

open discussion of the shelters.
This was evenlually provided in
the form of a Stanford Today
and-Tomorrow panel of adminis
tration officials.
IN THE WORDS of a Daily edi
torial, this discussion was "a sig
nificant turning point in the his
tory of student-Administration re
lations at Stanford . . . the Ad
ministration has publicly recog
nized that it is proper to inform
the Stanford community publicly
of their reasons for taking con
troversial policy stands, and to al
low members of the Administra
tion to be questioned about these
stands." (May 17, 1963.)
Also in the new constitution are
provisions for greater student op
portunity to form groups and
speak out on public issues. The
need for such provisions was felt
last year during a student and
administration incident concern
ing KPFA, a radio station being
investigated by the HUAC on
charges of communist activity.
ASSU PRESIDENT Armin Ros
encranz, speaking for the ASSU,
wrote a public letter denouncing
the investigation. The adminis
tration then denounced his action
and stated that the ASSU could
not take public stands on partisan
issues since their stand might in
volve an improper use of the uni
versity's name.
Under Ihe new constitution and
the accompanying statement by
the trustees of policy concerning
collective expression, the ASSU
still may not express partisan
viewpoints, but smaller groups

who wish to speak out find forma
tion easier, and partisan groups
such as the Young Democrats or
Republicians cui be allowed to
use university facilities for meet
ings and programs.
TAKING IMMEDIATE advan
tage of the trustees' statement, a
group of students formed the Stu
dent Congress, intended as a ve
hicle for collective student expres
sion on any topic.
These are some of the events
which will shape the form fresh
men will see student affairs and
activities take this year. That last

| year was an active one can be
shown by quoting from another
Daily editorial, this one a year
ago:
. . even today the Young Re
publicans and the Young Demo
crats are noi allowed to function
on campus ... At Harvard these
prohibitions would be considered
absurd and even irresponsible.
Perhaps in ten years these pro
hibitions will be considered in the

not, if students are unwilling to

FRESHMEN AT WILBUR after the picnic yesterday enjoying a game
of push ball. Or is it crab ball: Jacks, maybe, Anyway everyone
seems to be having a ball, or is it vice versa?


SEVERAL MEMBERS of the Freshman Class of 1967, either lost or just plain curious, study a scale
model of the Stanford campus presently on display upstairs in Tresidder Memorial Union. In addi
tion to already existing structures, the model shows future buildings to be constructed under the
PACE program.
Vacation was over Wednesday (at least theoretically) for the
new freshmen who entered the campus armed with maps, and Stan
ford handbooks against a busy schedule of meetings, speeches, and
orientation during pre-reg week. This year frosh will find the cam
pus somewhat different from that seen by preceding classes.

They will find their way to the*
bookstore and post office (esen
tial during pre-reg week) ob
structed by construction work on
White Memorial Plaza. However,
unrecognizable it may as a plaza
now, the area will eventually
contain extensive landscaping,
outdoor seating and a central
fountain with an ornamental
sculpture. The plaza is a gift to
PACE by Mi-, and Mrs. Raymond
R. White of Kansas City in mem
ory of their two sons.
IX ADDITION, there is Math
corner (formerly physics corner)
on the northwest section of t he
Quad. Face-lifting in this area is
not yet completed, but will eventu
ally result in more and improved
classrooms.
Freshmen will also soon become
familiar with Roble (ROH-blee),
Branner, Wilbur and Stern Halls,
in all of which groups of them
will be housed. Roble, housing
about two-thirds of the freshman
girls, differs from Branner, the
other freshman women s dorm,
primarily in its lack of a strategic
location.
Branner is comfortably situated
in the midst of the men's housing
complex of Toyon, Wilbur, and
Stern, and was itself once a men's
dorm. Roble is next to the pres
ently un-lakeliko Lake Lag; frosh
from Wilbur and Stern usually
find its scenery worth the walk.
WILBUR IS the largest dorm
on campus, with 720 men in eight
houses; it will be the scene of the
inevitable Jollyup. Stern Hall is
unique in being the only dorm
with both freshmen and upper
classmen; freshmen there are un
der the guidance of Resident As
histants rather than sponsors, as
in the other three dorms.
Other buildings of importance
on campus will also gradually be
come familiar. In the process
freshmen will become acquainted
with the associated jargon of ab
breviations: Civ Libe (all too fa
miliar). Mem Aud, Hoo Tow, Flo
Mo, Dink, and even Fun Stan.
LATER ON, as they become
more deeply involved in campus
life, freshmen will become aware
of a campus atmosphere w hi c h
will be somewhat different than
last year's. In student govern
ment, for instance, there is a new
constitution which was approved
by the trustees last March. It pro
vides for a larger student legisla
ture (LASSU) in an effort to give
all living groups fair representa
tion.
Class government (except for
seniors) was formally abolished
last spring. Last year's freshman
class executive committee began
the move by dissolving their own
organizat ion.
Despite some argument con
cerning the validity of their action
(the rest of the class was not con
sulted*, the issue was referred to
the ballot of the undergraduate
classes, who rejected their govern
ments in a fairly close vote.
A N O T II E R CONTROVERSY
began last spring when the Peace
Caucus, held a continuous vigil on
the Quad ;ind in front of President
Sterling's home protesting the
failure of the University to clarify
the reasons behind the fallout sys
tem installed on campus.
Students participating were at
first threatened with suspension
if they did not cease the vigil in
"private residential areas."
The vigil ended as the adminis
tration's attitude softened; peti
tions were circulated asking for'

open discussion of the shelters.
This was evenlually provided in
the form of a Stanford Today
and-Tomorrow panel of adminis
tration officials.
IN THE WORDS of a Daily edi
torial, this discussion was "a sig
nificant turning point in the his
tory of student-Administration re
lations at Stanford . . . the Ad
ministration has publicly recog
nized that it is proper to inform
the Stanford community publicly
of their reasons for taking con
troversial policy stands, and to al
low members of the Administra
tion to be questioned about these
stands." (May 17, 1963.)
Also in the new constitution are
provisions for greater student op
portunity to form groups and
speak out on public issues. The
need for such provisions was felt
last year during a student and
administration incident concern
ing KPFA, a radio station being
investigated by the HUAC on
charges of communist activity.
ASSU PRESIDENT Armin Ros
encranz, speaking for the ASSU,
wrote a public letter denouncing
the investigation. The adminis
tration then denounced his action
and stated that the ASSU could
not take public stands on partisan
issues since their stand might in
volve an improper use of the uni
versity's name.
Under Ihe new constitution and
the accompanying statement by
the trustees of policy concerning
collective expression, the ASSU
still may not express partisan
viewpoints, but smaller groups

who wish to speak out find forma
tion easier, and partisan groups
such as the Young Democrats or
Republicians cui be allowed to
use university facilities for meet
ings and programs.
TAKING IMMEDIATE advan

group of students formed the Stu

and stated that the ASSU could
not take public stands on partisan
issues since their stand might in
volve an improper use of the uni
versity's name.
Under Ihe new constitution and
the accompanying statement by
the trustees of policy concerning
collective expression, the ASSU
still may not express partisan
viewpoints, but smaller groups

who wish to speak out find forma
tion easier, and partisan groups
such as the Young Democrats or
Republicians cui be allowed to
use university facilities for meet
ings and programs.
TAKING IMMEDIATE advan
tage of the trustees' statement, a
group of students formed the Stu
dent Congress, intended as a ve
hicle for collective student expres
sion on any topic.
These are some of the events
which will shape the form fresh
men will see student affairs and
activities take this year. That last

| year was an active one can be
shown by quoting from another
Daily editorial, this one a year
ago:
. . even today the Young Re
publicans and the Young Demo
crats are noi allowed to function
on campus ... At Harvard these
prohibitions would be considered
absurd and even irresponsible.
Perhaps in ten years these pro
hibitions will be considered in the
same light at Stanford. Perhaps
not, if students are unwilling to
pres the University." Sept. 21,
1962.)


FRESHMEN AT WILBUR after the picnic yesterday enjoying a game
of push ball. Or is it crab ball: Jacks, maybe, Anyway everyone
seems to be having a ball, or is it vice versa?


SEVERAL MEMBERS of the Freshman Class of 1967, either lost or just plain curious, study a scale
model of the Stanford campus presently on display upstairs in Tresidder Memorial Union. In addi
tion to already existing structures, the model shows future buildings to be constructed under the
PACE program.
Vacation was over Wednesday (at least theoretically) for the
new freshmen who entered the campus armed with maps, and Stan
ford handbooks against a busy schedule of meetings, speeches, and
orientation during pre-reg week. This year frosh will find the cam
pus somewhat different from that seen by preceding classes.

They will find their way to the*
bookstore and post office (esen
tial during pre-reg week) ob
structed by construction work on
White Memorial Plaza. However,
unrecognizable it may as a plaza
now, the area will eventually
contain extensive landscaping,
outdoor seating and a central
fountain with an ornamental
sculpture. The plaza is a gift to
PACE by Mi-, and Mrs. Raymond
R. White of Kansas City in mem
ory of their two sons.
IX ADDITION, there is Math
corner (formerly physics corner)
on the northwest section of t he
Quad. Face-lifting in this area is
not yet completed, but will eventu
ally result in more and improved
classrooms.
Freshmen will also soon become
familiar with Roble (ROH-blee),
Branner, Wilbur and Stern Halls,
in all of which groups of them
will be housed. Roble, housing
about two-thirds of the freshman
girls, differs from Branner, the
other freshman women s dorm,
primarily in its lack of a strategic
location.
Branner is comfortably situated
in the midst of the men's housing
complex of Toyon, Wilbur, and
Stern, and was itself once a men's
dorm. Roble is next to the pres
ently un-lakeliko Lake Lag; frosh
from Wilbur and Stern usually
find its scenery worth the walk.
WILBUR IS the largest dorm
on campus, with 720 men in eight
houses; it will be the scene of the
inevitable Jollyup. Stern Hall is
unique in being the only dorm
with both freshmen and upper
classmen; freshmen there are un
der the guidance of Resident As
histants rather than sponsors, as
in the other three dorms.
Other buildings of importance
on campus will also gradually be
come familiar. In the process
freshmen will become acquainted
with the associated jargon of ab
breviations: Civ Libe (all too fa
miliar). Mem Aud, Hoo Tow, Flo
Mo, Dink, and even Fun Stan.
LATER ON, as they become
more deeply involved in campus
life, freshmen will become aware
of a campus atmosphere w hi c h
will be somewhat different than
last year's. In student govern
ment, for instance, there is a new
constitution which was approved
by the trustees last March. It pro
vides for a larger student legisla
ture (LASSU) in an effort to give
all living groups fair representa
tion.
Class government (except for
seniors) was formally abolished
last spring. Last year's freshman
class executive committee began
the move by dissolving their own
organizat ion.
Despite some argument con
cerning the validity of their action
(the rest of the class was not con
sulted*, the issue was referred to
the ballot of the undergraduate
classes, who rejected their govern
ments in a fairly close vote.
A N O T II E R CONTROVERSY
began last spring when the Peace
Caucus, held a continuous vigil on
the Quad ;ind in front of President
Sterling's home protesting the
failure of the University to clarify
the reasons behind the fallout sys
tem installed on campus.
Students participating were at
first threatened with suspension
if they did not cease the vigil in
"private residential areas."
The vigil ended as the adminis
tration's attitude softened; peti
tions were circulated asking for'

open discussion of the shelters.
This was evenlually provided in
the form of a Stanford Today
and-Tomorrow panel of adminis
tration officials.
IN THE WORDS of a Daily edi
torial, this discussion was "a sig
nificant turning point in the his
tory of student-Administration re
lations at Stanford . . . the Ad
ministration has publicly recog
nized that it is proper to inform
the Stanford community publicly
of their reasons for taking con
troversial policy stands, and to al
low members of the Administra
tion to be questioned about these
stands." (May 17, 1963.)
Also in the new constitution are
provisions for greater student op
portunity to form groups and
speak out on public issues. The
need for such provisions was felt
last year during a student and
administration incident concern
ing KPFA, a radio station being
investigated by the HUAC on
charges of communist activity.
ASSU PRESIDENT Armin Ros
encranz, speaking for the ASSU,
wrote a public letter denouncing
the investigation. The adminis
tration then denounced his action
and stated that the ASSU could
not take public stands on partisan
issues since their stand might in
volve an improper use of the uni
