# Frosh Hear Professors in Series of Lectures
## 
### 
Professors representing nine of the University's major depart
ments spoke last evening before small groups of freshmen first in
a series of lectures and then in informal discussions held in the
lounges of freshmen dorms.
This "Thursday Evening Series" was a part of Ihe Pro-Reg Com-

mission's program to orient the
freshmen to the Stanford Com
munity.
A four-fold purpose was behind
tho lectures and discussions.
First, students were introduced
to the professors on an informal,
personal, and humanistic basis.
The seminars following the lec
tures enabled students to ask
questions freely of the professors.
SECONDLY, THE SESSIONS
were practical in that they al
lowed freshmen the opportunity
to discuss their ideas from lec
tures. books that had been recom
mended as summer reading, and
residual knowledge with the nine
men. Thirdly, they aimed to
make the freshman aware of the
value of faculty-student relation-

ADDRESSING a freshmen group
last night on "Individuality,
Philosophy, and Education" as
part of the Thursday Evening
Series, Dr. John Mothershead,
philosophy, began by quoting a
familiar slogan: "Stanford is
dedicated to the production of
the 'uncommon' man." He de
fined an "uncommon" man by
saying: a) he is himself; and b)
he lives in the real world.
"College years are exciting
because they are part of the
process by which a man becomes
an individual, something many
never achieve." By thinking
philosophically, one questions
beliefs so that they will have a
reason and not merely a cause.
"The more we think the more do
we control what we do and be
come ourselves."
He added that "The special
concern of philosophy is with be
liefs that are fundamental,
which influence other beliefs. To
learn philosophy is to come to
a set of beliefs which put one on
the road to self-direction, for
philosophy asks not only 'what
is true?' but 'what is Truth?' "

ships. And finally, the evening
| offered to new students a qualita
tive preview of academic life at
Stanford.
Students chose the lecture they
wished to attend on the basis of
its interest; it was not necessar
ily that in the field in which they
intended to major.
THE INFORMAL discussions
in the lounges of Branner, Roble,
Stern, and Wilbur Halls were
led by sponsors. Freshmen had
been asked to prepare by reading
material relevant to the lecture
topic.
Robert H. McKin spoke on
"Engineering and Human Values"
in Cubberley Auditorium. He be
lieves that engineering should
treat man as a whole being, and
consequently that engineering
should include his intellectual and
emotional needs in its domain.
Representing the Department
of Sociology was Sanford M.
Dornbusch speaking on "Popula
tion Problems." He was a mem
ber of the first group to study
at the Stanford Center for Ad
vanced Behavioral Sciences.
"THE VISUAL ARTS: Mirror
of Man and His Culture" was
the topic of Douglas A. Russell,
speaking for the Department ol'
Art. Russell's main interest lies
in the history of art.
Gordon A. Craig of the History
Department lectured on "The Old
Diplomacy and Its Relevance To
day." Craig is both scholar and
teacher and specialized in th e
field of German history.
Craig said diplomacy has never
been as essential as it is today.
He explained: "Since the twen
tieth century has lost the secrets
of controlling war once it gets
started . . . today Western diplo
mats must enforce their interests
without the use of wars."
The history professor added
that diplomacy is not impossible
when there is a clash of ideologi
cal absolutes- as between Com
munism and Democracy. An d
for proof he cited the 1935 Aus
trian agreement and the recent
test ban negotiations.
The subject of John L. Mothers
head's lecture was "Individuality,
Philosophy and Education."
Mothershead is a professor in the
Department of Philosophy.
Lorie Tarshis from the Eco
nomics Department lectured on
the topic, "Economic Problems in
1984." Tarshis studied economics
under Lord Keynes at Cambridge.
Tarshis pointed out that the
shrinkage of available land is one
of the biggest bottlenecks man
faces today. "We've been able to
avoid this so far through such
means as technology," he ex
plained. "But whether this happy
situation continues as population
goes up is a serious question."
CHARLES DREKMEIER, rep
resenting the Political Science
Department in the Thursday Eve
ning Series, spoke on the topic,
"Power and Purpose."
In the Little Theater, Donald
Kennedy from the Department of
Biology lectured on "Cell. Organ
ism and Population." His re
search interests deal with the
physiology of nerves and nervous
systems.
Wilfred Stone of Ihe English
Department gave a lecture en
titled "Passage lo India: A Mod
ern Myth."

CHARLES A. DREKMEIER, Assistant Professor of Political Science, j
addressing several hundred freshmen assembled in the Physics |
Tank yesterday evening for his Pre-Reg "Thursday Evening Series" j
lecture, presented a political scientist's broad view of man in his!
society. Opening his lecture, which he entitled "Power and Pur- |
pose," Drekmeier said he intended to present "some thoughts |
about how man sees his world and himself in it, about the role !
of education, about history, responsibility, and the nature of the
political."
Drekmeier defined what he feels is the first significant differ
ence between man and the lower animals: "An animal can't see
his environment as something apart. . . . But man is capable of
transforming his environment into objects." He concluded, "By
turning his environment into an object, man can enter into power
over nature and society."

PROFESSOR DONALD KENNEDY, representing the Department of
Biology in last night's Thursday Evening Series, spoke of the topic,
"Cell, Organism and Population" in the Little Theater. In his lec
ture, Kennedy combined bits of the history of biology with how
Stanford's department arrived at the new program and curric
ulum it will inaugurate this quarter.
Two discoveries are responsible for the advancements in
biological study," Kennedy said. The first was development of
the cellular theory, and biologists are now able to take the cell
apart chemically and structurally. "The second historical develop
ment," he said, "took place on a different level. Biology has not
only a history, but a future as well. Current interest in the field
lies in the predictable ways that can be studied as biological
experience."

PROFESSOR DONALD KENNEDY, representing the Department of
Biology in last night's Thursday Evening Series, spoke of the topic,
"Cell, Organism and Population" in the Little Theater. In his lec
ture, Kennedy combined bits of the history of biology with how
Stanford's department arrived at the new program and curric
ulum it will inaugurate this quarter.
Two discoveries are responsible for the advancements in
biological study," Kennedy said. The first was development of
the cellular theory, and biologists are now able to take the cell
apart chemically and structurally. "The second historical develop
ment," he said, "took place on a different level. Biology has not
only a history, but a future as well. Current interest in the field
lies in the predictable ways that can be studied as biological
experience."



Professors representing nine of the University's major depart
ments spoke last evening before small groups of freshmen first in
a series of lectures and then in informal discussions held in the
lounges of freshmen dorms.
This "Thursday Evening Series" was a part of Ihe Pro-Reg Com-

mission's program to orient the
freshmen to the Stanford Com
munity.
A four-fold purpose was behind
tho lectures and discussions.
First, students were introduced
to the professors on an informal,
personal, and humanistic basis.
The seminars following the lec

questions freely of the professors.

ADDRESSING a freshmen group
last night on "Individuality,
Philosophy, and Education" as
part of the Thursday Evening
Series, Dr. John Mothershead,
philosophy, began by quoting a
familiar slogan: "Stanford is
dedicated to the production of
the 'uncommon' man." He de
fined an "uncommon" man by
saying: a) he is himself; and b)
he lives in the real world.
"College years are exciting
because they are part of the
process by which a man becomes
an individual, something many
never achieve." By thinking
philosophically, one questions
beliefs so that they will have a
reason and not merely a cause.
"The more we think the more do
we control what we do and be
come ourselves."
He added that "The special
concern of philosophy is with be
liefs that are fundamental,
which influence other beliefs. To
learn philosophy is to come to
a set of beliefs which put one on
the road to self-direction, for
philosophy asks not only 'what
is true?' but 'what is Truth?' "

ships. And finally, the evening
| offered to new students a qualita
tive preview of academic life at
Stanford.
Students chose the lecture they
wished to attend on the basis of
its interest; it was not necessar
ily that in the field in which they
intended to major.
THE INFORMAL discussions
in the lounges of Branner, Roble,
Stern, and Wilbur Halls were
led by sponsors. Freshmen had
been asked to prepare by reading
material relevant to the lecture
topic.
Robert H. McKin spoke on
"Engineering and Human Values"
in Cubberley Auditorium. He be
lieves that engineering should
treat man as a whole being, and
consequently that engineering
should include his intellectual and
emotional needs in its domain.
Representing the Department
of Sociology was Sanford M.
Dornbusch speaking on "Popula
tion Problems." He was a mem
ber of the first group to study
at the Stanford Center for Ad
vanced Behavioral Sciences.
"THE VISUAL ARTS: Mirror
of Man and His Culture" was
the topic of Douglas A. Russell,
speaking for the Department ol'
Art. Russell's main interest lies
in the history of art.
Gordon A. Craig of the History
Department lectured on "The Old
Diplomacy and Its Relevance To
day." Craig is both scholar and
teacher and specialized in th e
field of German history.
Craig said diplomacy has never
been as essential as it is today.
He explained: "Since the twen
tieth century has lost the secrets
of controlling war once it gets
started . . . today Western diplo
mats must enforce their interests
without the use of wars."
The history professor added
that diplomacy is not impossible
when there is a clash of ideologi
cal absolutes- as between Com
munism and Democracy. An d
for proof he cited the 1935 Aus
trian agreement and the recent
test ban negotiations.
The subject of John L. Mothers
head's lecture was "Individuality,
Philosophy and Education."
Mothershead is a professor in the
Department of Philosophy.
Lorie Tarshis from the Eco
nomics Department lectured on
the topic, "Economic Problems in
1984." Tarshis studied economics
under Lord Keynes at Cambridge.
Tarshis pointed out that the
shrinkage of available land is one
of the biggest bottlenecks man
faces today. "We've been able to
avoid this so far through such
means as technology," he ex
plained. "But whether this happy
situation continues as population
goes up is a serious question."
CHARLES DREKMEIER, rep
resenting the Political Science
Department in the Thursday Eve
ning Series, spoke on the topic,
"Power and Purpose."
In the Little Theater, Donald
Kennedy from the Department of
Biology lectured on "Cell. Organ
ism and Population." His re
search interests deal with the
physiology of nerves and nervous
systems.
Wilfred Stone of Ihe English
Department gave a lecture en
titled "Passage lo India: A Mod
ern Myth."

CHARLES A. DREKMEIER, Assistant Professor of Political Science, j
addressing several hundred freshmen assembled in the Physics |
Tank yesterday evening for his Pre-Reg "Thursday Evening Series" j
lecture, presented a political scientist's broad view of man in his!
society. Opening his lecture, which he entitled "Power and Pur- |
pose," Drekmeier said he intended to present "some thoughts |
about how man sees his world and himself in it, about the role !
of education, about history, responsibility, and the nature of the
political."
Drekmeier defined what he feels is the first significant differ
ence between man and the lower animals: "An animal can't see
his environment as something apart. . . . But man is capable of
transforming his environment into objects." He concluded, "By
turning his environment into an object, man can enter into power
over nature and society."

Tank yesterday evening for his Pre-Reg "Thursday Evening Series" j
lecture, presented a political scientist's broad view of man in his!
society. Opening his lecture, which he entitled "Power and Pur- |
pose," Drekmeier said he intended to present "some thoughts |
about how man sees his world and himself in it, about the role !
of education, about history, responsibility, and the nature of the
political."
Drekmeier defined what he feels is the first significant differ
ence between man and the lower animals: "An animal can't see
his environment as something apart. . . . But man is capable of
transforming his environment into objects." He concluded, "By
turning his environment into an object, man can enter into power
over nature and society."

PROFESSOR DONALD KENNEDY, representing the Department of
Biology in last night's Thursday Evening Series, spoke of the topic,
"Cell, Organism and Population" in the Little Theater. In his lec
ture, Kennedy combined bits of the history of biology with how
Stanford's department arrived at the new program and curric
ulum it will inaugurate this quarter.
Two discoveries are responsible for the advancements in
biological study," Kennedy said. The first was development of
the cellular theory, and biologists are now able to take the cell
apart chemically and structurally. "The second historical develop
ment," he said, "took place on a different level. Biology has not
only a history, but a future as well. Current interest in the field
lies in the predictable ways that can be studied as biological
experience."



Professors representing nine of the University's major depart
ments spoke last evening before small groups of freshmen first in
a series of lectures and then in informal discussions held in the
lounges of freshmen dorms.
This "Thursday Evening Series" was a part of Ihe Pro-Reg Com-

mission's program to orient the
freshmen to the Stanford Com
munity.
A four-fold purpose was behind
tho lectures and discussions.
First, students were introduced
to the professors on an informal,
personal, and humanistic basis.
The seminars following the lec
tures enabled students to ask
questions freely of the professors.

were practical in that they al
lowed freshmen the opportunity

ADDRESSING a freshmen group
last night on "Individuality,
Philosophy, and Education" as
part of the Thursday Evening
Series, Dr. John Mothershead,
philosophy, began by quoting a
familiar slogan: "Stanford is
dedicated to the production of
the 'uncommon' man." He de
fined an "uncommon" man by
saying: a) he is himself; and b)
he lives in the real world.
"College years are exciting
because they are part of the
process by which a man becomes
an individual, something many
never achieve." By thinking
philosophically, one questions
beliefs so that they will have a
reason and not merely a cause.
"The more we think the more do
we control what we do and be
come ourselves."
He added that "The special
concern of philosophy is with be
liefs that are fundamental,
which influence other beliefs. To
learn philosophy is to come to
a set of beliefs which put one on
the road to self-direction, for
philosophy asks not only 'what
is true?' but 'what is Truth?' "

ships. And finally, the evening
| offered to new students a qualita

Stanford.
Students chose the lecture they
wished to attend on the basis of
its interest; it was not necessar
ily that in the field in which they
intended to major.
THE INFORMAL discussions
in the lounges of Branner, Roble,
Stern, and Wilbur Halls were
led by sponsors. Freshmen had
been asked to prepare by reading
material relevant to the lecture
topic.
Robert H. McKin spoke on
"Engineering and Human Values"
in Cubberley Auditorium. He be
lieves that engineering should
treat man as a whole being, and
consequently that engineering
should include his intellectual and
emotional needs in its domain.
Representing the Department
of Sociology was Sanford M.
Dornbusch speaking on "Popula
tion Problems." He was a mem
ber of the first group to study
at the Stanford Center for Ad
vanced Behavioral Sciences.
"THE VISUAL ARTS: Mirror
of Man and His Culture" was
the topic of Douglas A. Russell,
speaking for the Department ol'
Art. Russell's main interest lies
in the history of art.
Gordon A. Craig of the History
Department lectured on "The Old
Diplomacy and Its Relevance To
day." Craig is both scholar and
teacher and specialized in th e
field of German history.
Craig said diplomacy has never
been as essential as it is today.
He explained: "Since the twen
tieth century has lost the secrets
of controlling war once it gets
started . . . today Western diplo
mats must enforce their interests
without the use of wars."
The history professor added
that diplomacy is not impossible
when there is a clash of ideologi
cal absolutes- as between Com
munism and Democracy. An d
for proof he cited the 1935 Aus
trian agreement and the recent
test ban negotiations.
The subject of John L. Mothers
head's lecture was "Individuality,
Philosophy and Education."
Mothershead is a professor in the
Department of Philosophy.
Lorie Tarshis from the Eco
nomics Department lectured on
the topic, "Economic Problems in
1984." Tarshis studied economics
under Lord Keynes at Cambridge.
Tarshis pointed out that the
shrinkage of available land is one
of the biggest bottlenecks man
faces today. "We've been able to
avoid this so far through such
means as technology," he ex
plained. "But whether this happy
situation continues as population
goes up is a serious question."
CHARLES DREKMEIER, rep
resenting the Political Science
Department in the Thursday Eve
ning Series, spoke on the topic,
"Power and Purpose."
In the Little Theater, Donald
Kennedy from the Department of
Biology lectured on "Cell. Organ
ism and Population." His re
search interests deal with the
physiology of nerves and nervous
systems.
Wilfred Stone of Ihe English
Department gave a lecture en
titled "Passage lo India: A Mod

avoid this so far through such
means as technology," he ex
plained. "But whether this happy
situation continues as population
goes up is a serious question."
CHARLES DREKMEIER, rep
resenting the Political Science
Department in the Thursday Eve
ning Series, spoke on the topic,
"Power and Purpose."
In the Little Theater, Donald
Kennedy from the Department of
Biology lectured on "Cell. Organ
ism and Population." His re
search interests deal with the
physiology of nerves and nervous
systems.
Wilfred Stone of Ihe English
Department gave a lecture en
titled "Passage lo India: A Mod
ern Myth."

CHARLES A. DREKMEIER, Assistant Professor of Political Science, j
addressing several hundred freshmen assembled in the Physics |
Tank yesterday evening for his Pre-Reg "Thursday Evening Series" j
lecture, presented a political scientist's broad view of man in his!
society. Opening his lecture, which he entitled "Power and Pur- |
pose," Drekmeier said he intended to present "some thoughts |
about how man sees his world and himself in it, about the role !
of education, about history, responsibility, and the nature of the
political."
Drekmeier defined what he feels is the first significant differ
ence between man and the lower animals: "An animal can't see
his environment as something apart. . . . But man is capable of
transforming his environment into objects." He concluded, "By
turning his environment into an object, man can enter into power
over nature and society."

PROFESSOR DONALD KENNEDY, representing the Department of
Biology in last night's Thursday Evening Series, spoke of the topic,
"Cell, Organism and Population" in the Little Theater. In his lec
ture, Kennedy combined bits of the history of biology with how
Stanford's department arrived at the new program and curric
ulum it will inaugurate this quarter.
Two discoveries are responsible for the advancements in
biological study," Kennedy said. The first was development of
the cellular theory, and biologists are now able to take the cell
apart chemically and structurally. "The second historical develop
ment," he said, "took place on a different level. Biology has not
only a history, but a future as well. Current interest in the field
lies in the predictable ways that can be studied as biological
experience."



Professors representing nine of the University's major depart
ments spoke last evening before small groups of freshmen first in
a series of lectures and then in informal discussions held in the
lounges of freshmen dorms.
This "Thursday Evening Series" was a part of Ihe Pro-Reg Com-

mission's program to orient the
freshmen to the Stanford Com
munity.
A four-fold purpose was behind
tho lectures and discussions.
First, students were introduced
to the professors on an informal,
personal, and humanistic basis.
The seminars following the lec
tures enabled students to ask
questions freely of the professors.
SECONDLY, THE SESSIONS
were practical in that they al
lowed freshmen the opportunity
to discuss their ideas from lec
tures. books that had been recom
mended as summer reading, and
residual knowledge with the nine
men. Thirdly, they aimed to
make the freshman aware of the
value of faculty-student relation-

ADDRESSING a freshmen group
last night on "Individuality,
Philosophy, and Education" as
part of the Thursday Evening
Series, Dr. John Mothershead,
philosophy, began by quoting a
familiar slogan: "Stanford is
dedicated to the production of
the 'uncommon' man." He de
fined an "uncommon" man by
saying: a) he is himself; and b)
he lives in the real world.
"College years are exciting
because they are part of the
process by which a man becomes
an individual, something many
never achieve." By thinking
philosophically, one questions
beliefs so that they will have a
reason and not merely a cause.
"The more we think the more do
we control what we do and be
come ourselves."
He added that "The special
concern of philosophy is with be
liefs that are fundamental,
which influence other beliefs. To
learn philosophy is to come to
a set of beliefs which put one on
the road to self-direction, for
philosophy asks not only 'what
is true?' but 'what is Truth?' "

ships. And finally, the evening
| offered to new students a qualita
tive preview of academic life at
Stanford.
Students chose the lecture they
wished to attend on the basis of
its interest; it was not necessar
ily that in the field in which they
intended to major.
THE INFORMAL discussions
in the lounges of Branner, Roble,
Stern, and Wilbur Halls were
led by sponsors. Freshmen had
been asked to prepare by reading
material relevant to the lecture
topic.
Robert H. McKin spoke on
"Engineering and Human Values"
in Cubberley Auditorium. He be
lieves that engineering should
treat man as a whole being, and
consequently that engineering
should include his intellectual and
emotional needs in its domain.
Representing the Department
of Sociology was Sanford M.
Dornbusch speaking on "Popula
tion Problems." He was a mem
ber of the first group to study
at the Stanford Center for Ad
vanced Behavioral Sciences.
"THE VISUAL ARTS: Mirror
of Man and His Culture" was
the topic of Douglas A. Russell,
speaking for the Department ol'
Art. Russell's main interest lies
in the history of art.
Gordon A. Craig of the History
Department lectured on "The Old
Diplomacy and Its Relevance To
day." Craig is both scholar and
teacher and specialized in th e
field of German history.
Craig said diplomacy has never
been as essential as it is today.
He explained: "Since the twen
tieth century has lost the secrets
of controlling war once it gets
started . . . today Western diplo
mats must enforce their interests
without the use of wars."
The history professor added
that diplomacy is not impossible
when there is a clash of ideologi
cal absolutes- as between Com
munism and Democracy. An d
for proof he cited the 1935 Aus
trian agreement and the recent
test ban negotiations.
The subject of John L. Mothers
head's lecture was "Individuality,
Philosophy and Education."
Mothershead is a professor in the
Department of Philosophy.
Lorie Tarshis from the Eco
nomics Department lectured on
the topic, "Economic Problems in
1984." Tarshis studied economics
under Lord Keynes at Cambridge.
Tarshis pointed out that the
shrinkage of available land is one
of the biggest bottlenecks man
faces today. "We've been able to
avoid this so far through such
means as technology," he ex
plained. "But whether this happy
situation continues as population
goes up is a serious question."
