# Stanford Daily Supplement On the Overseas Campuses
## Stanford Abroad: Sot for Everyone 
### 
Si\ months at a Stanford overseas campus is not a good tiling
for everyone. For some it can he misery, boredom, frustration. I'or
others it is the most rewarding period in their educational lite. One
would hope that only the latter would apply and attend. If six
months of "fishbowT" living—Bo students eating, sleeping, attending
classes in one building—'would drive a particular student to livnzy,
Stanford overseas is not for him. If a student feels spending a week
end writing a paper is unjustifiable when Paris is mere hours away,
Stanford overseas is not for him. If a student feels that required
attendance at classes in Europe is intolerable, that travel regulations
are a violation of human right, that Stanford abroad is a six month
vacation reward for maintaining a 3.0 freshman year, Stanford over
seas is not for him.
The program is designed as an academic experience, and is very
effective in that context. For the student "on vacation" the pro
grams demands can lead to only boredom and frustration. The
overseas campuses office has never stated that the program is a
necessity for every student. Selection is an honor; the program of
language study, family contacts, group field trips, three-day week
ends is designed for the student approaching Europe academically.
Inexpensive independent student travel is available to any stu
dent who wants it, as is study at a foreign university. The Stanford
overseas program is unique in that it permits European study with |
no break in the home campus degree program, and permits students '
in all fields and with limited language background to participate. |
The worthwhileness of the program to a student upon his agreement
with the academic objectives of the university program, even though
the degree of latitude and freedom within this framework is great, j
This supplement is offered to entering freshmen, who will make
up the bulk of the next six groups, to portray the European program
as it exists in day to day life overseas and thereby give them a greater
basis upon which to decide if the program pertains to them.


"STANFORD HAUS," the main building at the Stanford-in-Germany center, stands on Landgut Burg,
a former duchess's residence. The site in Beutelsbach was chosen for its proximity to Stultgart, a cul
tural center, and for its relative isolation. Stanford-in-Germany is the oldest of Stanford's overseas
sludy centers, having been dedicated in June, 1958.
