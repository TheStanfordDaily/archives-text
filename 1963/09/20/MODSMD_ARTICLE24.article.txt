# Critics of Stanford Abroad:
## Centers Described as isolated, Arbitrary, Pointless' 
### 
In the several years since the
conception and execution of the
Overseas Campus prog r a m s,
critics have examined it from
many angles and some have
found it wanting.
Homer Boushey, a student at
Stanford-in-France Group IV,
wrote The Daily after his return
from Europe. Printed in the let
ters to the Editor column in the
October 15, edition, his let
tor said, in part. "My policy for
revising Stanford's overseas cam
pus program would be to abolish
them."
"You can learn a good deal
more about another country by
spending the twelve hundred dol
lars travelling, attending a for
eign university or living with a
European family," Boushey said.
Time, did not go as far as Bou
shey, in its examination nor its
condemnation. Regarding the
academic side of the program,
Time said, . . the brains he

hind their (the student's) tanned
and healthy faces" find the class
work at Overseas Campuses "in
ane and untaxing."
Boushey and others have found
also that tho courses offered
abroad have little 1 1o do with the
"European experience." He ques
tions the value of teaching Ab
normal Psychology or Child
Psychology overseas.
During the seventh and eighth
of February, 1!)(>3, The Daily ran
a two part series examining the
role of the overseas campuses.
Written by Temp Peck, the arti
cles tried to show that the criti
cism of the campuses was divided
into two parts: problems of ad
ministration and problems of
goals and aims.
"The administrative 'bugs' are
being worked out of the program
at a fairly constant rate," Peck
wrote. "But after five years of
operation, the actual goals of the
study centers remains nebulous."
"The University brochure nevei
states straightforwardlv that the

program is designed to offer in
tensive instruction in the local
language, culture, or literature.
Indeed, it should not state such
i goals, for the Stanford program
is certainly not intensive in these
respects," Peck wrote.
"The practicality of the pro
gram is at once its biggest asset
and its greatest liability. Many
students in Engineering and the
Natural Sciences simply haven't
the time in their schedule to in
elude one or two years of lan
' guage training. A pro-mod major
would find it nearly impossible
to study abroad for a year and
' take non-General Studies courses.
The Stanford program offers him
about the only practical chance
j to study abroad. . . Peek
! wrote.
Homer Boushey's letter to the
! Editor stirred some controversy
on campus. Several letters reply
ing to the "charges" made some
attempt at clairifying the goals
! of the overseas campuses.
Mike Hallor, also in Group TV

at Stanford-in-France, wrote, "I
do not think it was tho Univer
sity's goal in sotting up the over
seas program to mako 'European
Scholars' out of Stanford stu
dents. I think its idea, rather,
was to provide for the student
iho opportunity to become ac
quainted with a foreign culture
1» at a cost approximately the
same as that of a Stanford edu
cation (in Palo Alto', and 2) with
a full transfer of Stanford aca
demic credit."
George Hamrdla. a student at
Stanford in Germany Group 11,
wrote in reply to Boushgy, . .
the 'defects' he (Boushey) out
lines are scarcely 'inherent' in the
system. The extent to which
these 'defects' affect a particular
student is determined largely by
his own . . . attitude toward Stan
ford abroad."
"Mr. Boushoy's quest f<': total
cultural immersion served up in
a silver platter in a six months
period is, at best, naive," Hamrdla
«iid


STANFORD-IN-ITALY'S Villa San Paolo is situated in the terraced hills of Florence below Fiesole. Even
though the Villa has been modernized since it was built during the late 17th century, it retains much
of the elegance of the earlier periods. The high ceilings are decorated with gilt chandeliers and fres
coes by Ingres, the French neoclassicist, and his students.
