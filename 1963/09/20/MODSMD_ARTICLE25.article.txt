# Pioneering Effort Installs Stanford Overseas
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Stanford-in-France V 
In June of this year sixty Stan
ford students arrived in Stuttgart
to begin the eleventh session of
Stanford-in-Germany. With the
seventh group about to embark
to the French and Italian cam

puses, it would appear that Stan
ford has firmly entrenched itself
on the continent. But the esta
blishment of Stanford abroad was
not accomplished without compli
cation.
The history of Stanford's over
seas program quite properly be
gins several years before the first
center was opened at Stuttgart
in June of 1958. The idea of a
Stanford campus abroad was initi
aled by Friedrich W. Strothmann,
professor of German and execu
tive head of Modern European
Languages. lie presented his pro
posal to the General Studies Com
mittee headed by Professor Rob
ert Walker and, in turn, to Presi
dent Sterling. Frederic O. Glover.
Executive Assistant to the Presi
dent. recalls that it took at least
two years from this point of initi
ation until the proposal was
ready for formal discussions.
THE FIRST QUESTION, of
course, was whether the plan was
physically feasible. Was there a
suitable sight available? Stroth
mann went to Germany and
jcoured the country for a possible
location. "It was a tremendous
job looking for a facility for hous
ing sixty students plus faculty in
a war torn country," Glover com
mented. "It was a stroke of luck
when Strothmann found a place."
Before the proposal could be
developed there were complex
legal problems, many dealing
with German laws of ownership,
which had to be negotiated. A
committee composed of Stroth
mann, Dean of Students H. Don
ald Winbigler, and Dwight B.
Adams, Business Manager, and
sent to Germany. Their report
was favorable, and the planning
proceded.
After lengthy discussions, a
thoroughly detailed plan was pre
sented before the Board of Trus
tees for approval. Executive As
sistant Glover said lie didn't re
member lhat the trustees had a
great deal of reservations, but
there were some serious ques
tions. The problem of finances
was the key to official hesita
tions, according to Glover. Was

an overseas operation financially
feasible?
AS IT TURNED OUT, Stanford
abroad was, indeed, financially
feasible. But other, less crucial,
reservations remained to be dealt
with. Some trustees questioned
whether the sanitary situation at
the overseas sight was adequate.
The local w a t e r supply was
checked. Glover recalls, "A Uni
versity Doctor even stopped by to
see il medical facilities for the
students were available. The Ger
mans were amazed."
Officials wondered about the
availability and adequacy of hous
ing for the Stanford faculty. The
problems of selecting nationals to
staff the center had to be dealt
with, along with the more com
plex problem of developing a
method of selecting Stanford fac
ulty members for the overseas
sessions. But any reservations
were ultimately resolved, the plan
put into action, and Stanford
Overseas initiated in Germany in
19."58.
Immediately after the estab
lishment of the Stuttgart campus,
University planners began look
ing for a suitable sight in France.
The timing was off on this par
ticular venture. During this per
iod, France's government was ex
tremely unstable and the franc
fluctuating.
HOUSING WAS virtually im
possible to obtain. Glover remem
bers that "the American Embassy
strongly discouraged us at that
time." Nevertheless, an initial
survey team was sent to France
to scout around for a possible
location. Several areas presented
themselves as possibilities—Caen

| and Nice were two —but for one
reason or another each was
eventually discarded.
After a virtually fruitless
search in France, Glover and Rob
ert A. Walker, present Director
of the Overseas Campuses Pro
gram, journeyed to Italy to look
for a possible sight there. A loca
tion outside of Milan was seri
ously considered and then finally
discarded as being too near a
large industrial center. In Flor
ence not one but three possible
centers were located. Glover re
members being impressed by the
beauty of one elaborate sight, a
building designed by Michelan
gelo and filled with valuable an
tiques. But in the end it was de
cided that the building was too
small and the antiques too valu
able to house eighty Stanford stu
dents.
After consideration Stanford-in-
Italy's present sight at Villa San
Paolo was decided upon and prep
arations begun for the opening of
the new center.
IN THE MEANTIME, situa
tions had changed markedly in
France. The government was
stable and more than willing to
cooperate with Stanford in its
venture. The campus sight in
Tours was secured, and the Stan
ford-in-Franee and Stanford-in-
Italy campuses were opened to
gether in October of 1960.
Stanford's program overseas is
by no means completed. Reliable
sources indicate that serious con
sideration has been given to the
possibility of expansion of the
program into a hispanic country.
! However, no immediate action is
I pending.

was the key to official hesita

an overseas operation financially
feasible?
AS IT TURNED OUT, Stanford
abroad was, indeed, financially
feasible. But other, less crucial,
reservations remained to be dealt
with. Some trustees questioned
whether the sanitary situation at
the overseas sight was adequate.
The local w a t e r supply was
checked. Glover recalls, "A Uni

Officials wondered about the
availability and adequacy of hous
ing for the Stanford faculty. The
problems of selecting nationals to
staff the center had to be dealt
with, along with the more com

method of selecting Stanford fac

sessions. But any reservations
were ultimately resolved, the plan
put into action, and Stanford

Immediately after the estab

The timing was off on this par

fluctuating.
HOUSING WAS virtually im

strongly discouraged us at that
time." Nevertheless, an initial
survey team was sent to France
to scout around for a possible
location. Several areas presented
themselves as possibilities—Caen

reason or another each was
eventually discarded.
After a virtually fruitless
search in France, Glover and Rob
ert A. Walker, present Director
of the Overseas Campuses Pro
gram, journeyed to Italy to look
for a possible sight there. A loca
tion outside of Milan was seri
ously considered and then finally
discarded as being too near a

the new center.
IN THE MEANTIME, situa

In June of this year sixty Stan

Officials wondered about the
availability and adequacy of hous
ing for the Stanford faculty. The
problems of selecting nationals to
staff the center had to be dealt
with, along with the more com
plex problem of developing a
method of selecting Stanford fac
ulty members for the overseas
sessions. But any reservations
were ultimately resolved, the plan
put into action, and Stanford
Overseas initiated in Germany in

Immediately after the estab

University planners began look

The timing was off on this par
ticular venture. During this per

fluctuating.
HOUSING WAS virtually im
possible to obtain. Glover remem
bers that "the American Embassy
strongly discouraged us at that
time." Nevertheless, an initial
survey team was sent to France
to scout around for a possible
location. Several areas presented
themselves as possibilities—Caen

| and Nice were two —but for one
reason or another each was
eventually discarded.
After a virtually fruitless
search in France, Glover and Rob
ert A. Walker, present Director
of the Overseas Campuses Pro
gram, journeyed to Italy to look
for a possible sight there. A loca
tion outside of Milan was seri
ously considered and then finally
discarded as being too near a
large industrial center. In Flor
ence not one but three possible
centers were located. Glover re
members being impressed by the
beauty of one elaborate sight, a
building designed by Michelan
gelo and filled with valuable an
tiques. But in the end it was de
cided that the building was too
small and the antiques too valu
able to house eighty Stanford stu
dents.
After consideration Stanford-in-
Italy's present sight at Villa San
Paolo was decided upon and prep
arations begun for the opening of
the new center.
IN THE MEANTIME, situa
tions had changed markedly in
France. The government was
stable and more than willing to
cooperate with Stanford in its
venture. The campus sight in
Tours was secured, and the Stan
ford-in-Franee and Stanford-in-
Italy campuses were opened to
gether in October of 1960.
Stanford's program overseas is
by no means completed. Reliable
sources indicate that serious con
sideration has been given to the
possibility of expansion of the
program into a hispanic country.

I pending.
In June of this year sixty Stan
ford students arrived in Stuttgart
to begin the eleventh session of
Stanford-in-Germany. With the
seventh group about to embark
to the French and Italian cam

puses, it would appear that Stan
ford has firmly entrenched itself
on the continent. But the esta
blishment of Stanford abroad was
not accomplished without compli
cation.
The history of Stanford's over
seas program quite properly be
gins several years before the first
center was opened at Stuttgart
in June of 1958. The idea of a
Stanford campus abroad was initi
aled by Friedrich W. Strothmann,
professor of German and execu
tive head of Modern European
Languages. lie presented his pro
posal to the General Studies Com
mittee headed by Professor Rob
ert Walker and, in turn, to Presi
dent Sterling. Frederic O. Glover.
Executive Assistant to the Presi
dent. recalls that it took at least
two years from this point of initi
ation until the proposal was
ready for formal discussions.
THE FIRST QUESTION, of
course, was whether the plan was
physically feasible. Was there a
suitable sight available? Stroth
mann went to Germany and
jcoured the country for a possible
location. "It was a tremendous
job looking for a facility for hous
ing sixty students plus faculty in
a war torn country," Glover com
mented. "It was a stroke of luck
when Strothmann found a place."
Before the proposal could be
developed there were complex
legal problems, many dealing
with German laws of ownership,
which had to be negotiated. A
committee composed of Stroth
mann, Dean of Students H. Don
ald Winbigler, and Dwight B.
Adams, Business Manager, and
sent to Germany. Their report
was favorable, and the planning
proceded.
After lengthy discussions, a
thoroughly detailed plan was pre
sented before the Board of Trus
tees for approval. Executive As
sistant Glover said lie didn't re
member lhat the trustees had a
great deal of reservations, but
there were some serious ques
tions. The problem of finances
was the key to official hesita
tions, according to Glover. Was

an overseas operation financially
feasible?
AS IT TURNED OUT, Stanford
abroad was, indeed, financially
feasible. But other, less crucial,
reservations remained to be dealt
with. Some trustees questioned
whether the sanitary situation at
the overseas sight was adequate.
The local w a t e r supply was
checked. Glover recalls, "A Uni
versity Doctor even stopped by to
see il medical facilities for the
students were available. The Ger
mans were amazed."
