# Studying Easier Overseas? Moser Evaluates Classes
## 
### 
Do students do less, and poorer quality, classroom work at Stan
ford Overseas campuses than on Quad? Does a lack of facilities
for research result in professors teaching a "diluted course" at the
European centers?
Answers to the perennial questions of the level of classroom

work at overseas campuses was*
attempted by Professor Thomas
Moser who spent six month in
residence at Stanford-in-France.
Till] ASSOCIATE PROFES
SOR of English eommented upon
the Stnford students in Tours: "I
thought they were better. There
was a fantastic amount of 'tour
ism' going on—l was shocked at
how much they got done! I gave
many more A's and B's than I
am used to; there was no one
who showed he had not done a
significant portion of the work."
In all, Moser felt that "as a
strictly Stanford experience, it
reminded me of a good Stanford
class. There was no less work
or learning overseas than with
two quarters of 30 to 32 units

on Quad."
The literary critic added, "I
do not think the unit load should
bo too heavy over there. I try
not to worry if the students have
free time or get anywhere on
weekends, but I do not think the
students should have too many
class hours while in Europe —•
they should have time to read,
walk, sit."
MOSER STATED that the main
difference between his course
overseas, "Introduction to the
Novel," and its counterpart on
Quad was "there were not as
many papers as there would be in
the normal course. I would norm
ally have two to three, but I only
had one required and one op
tional (which about half of the
students turned in). This is
mainly due to the lack of a grader
over there, which is perhaps a
problem that can be solved."
Turning to the professor's side
of the classroom, Moser said, "I
heard tales from the first re
turnees from Stuttgart that 'this
will be the most exciting teach
ing in your life, and the most
demanding.' "
AS FAR AS his own difficul
ties in adapting a course for pre
sentation in France, Moser said,
"It was all game for me to get
up on the French novel. I felt a
great lack of a context in myself
for these, but was glad for the
definite demand that I explore
them and teach them. I brought
enough books in paperback to
serve me in lectures. The over
seas campuses directors gave me
a carte-blanche and bought what
ever books I asked to have there."
Moser felt that certain courses
should be given the emphasis at
the European study centers; he
recommended that courses taught
by American professors be re
duced one unit in order to raise
the unit value of the French
civilization course. "Certain sub
jects, like fine arts and music
have a more obvious relevance,"
no led Moser.
Professor Moser and his wife
were more familiar than the aver
age professor with the overseas
campuses academic program as,
in addition to him teaching a
arge lecture course and a semi
nar each quarter overseas, both
Mosers attended the 6 units per
quarter of French classes offered
at the center and kept up with
the work in them. The Mosers
acquired a shining reputation
imong their Stanford overseas
students as the most fluent and
most prepared students in their
class.

ally have two to three, but I only
had one required and one op

students turned in). This is
mainly due to the lack of a grader
over there, which is perhaps a

of the classroom, Moser said, "I

turnees from Stuttgart that 'this

AS FAR AS his own difficul
ties in adapting a course for pre
sentation in France, Moser said,
"It was all game for me to get
up on the French novel. I felt a
great lack of a context in myself
for these, but was glad for the
definite demand that I explore
them and teach them. I brought
enough books in paperback to
serve me in lectures. The over
seas campuses directors gave me
a carte-blanche and bought what
ever books I asked to have there."
Moser felt that certain courses
should be given the emphasis at
the European study centers; he
recommended that courses taught
by American professors be re
duced one unit in order to raise
the unit value of the French
civilization course. "Certain sub
jects, like fine arts and music
have a more obvious relevance,"
no led Moser.

In all, Moser felt that "as a
