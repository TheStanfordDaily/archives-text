# On Campus with Max Shulman
## ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH, DEAR FRIENDS 
### Author of "Rally Round the Flag, Boys!" and, "Barefoot Boy With Cheek 
Today I begin my tenth year of writing this column in your
campus newspaper. Ten years is a long time; it is, in fact, what
some scholarly people like to call a decade—from the Latin
word deccum, meaning the floor of a ship. It is, to my mind,
remarkable that the Romans had such a word as deccum when
you consider that ships did not exist until 1020 when John
Alden invented the Mayflower. Alden, a prodigiously ingenious
man, also invented the ear lobe and Pocahontas.
Ships were a very popular mode of travel—especially over
water—until 1912 when the Swede, Ivar Krueger, invented the
iceberg. Krueger also invented the match, which is a good
thing, because without the match, how would you light your
Marlboro Cigarettes? I cannot overstress the importance of
lighting your Marlboro Cigarettes, for Marlboro Cigarettes,
unlighted, provide, at best, only limited smoking pleasure.

I mention Marlboros because this column is an advertise
ment, brought to you through the school year by the makers
of Marlboros. Marlboros come in soft pack or Flip-Top box.
The makers of Marlboros come in dark suits with thin lapels
—except on weekends when they come in yoke-neck jerseys
and white duck trousers. White ducks come in flocks. They are
primarily fresh water dwellers, although they have been suc
cessfully raised in salt water too. Another salt water denizen
I'm sure you will find enjoyable is plankton—a mess of tiny
organisms like diatoms and algae and like that which float
sluggishly near the surface of the sea. It is ironic that these
creatures, microscopic in size, should supply the principal
source of food for the earth's largest animal, the whale. Whales,
I must say, are not at all pleased with this arrangement, be
cause it takes the average whale, eating steadily, 48 hours to
gather a day's meal. This leaves them almost no time for
water sports or reading Melville. It is a lucky thing for all of
us that whales are unaware they are mammals, not fish, and
could, if they tried, live just as well on land as in water. I
mean, you add ten or twelve million whales to our Sunday
traffic and you would have congestion that makes the mind
boggle.
But I digress. Today, I was saying, I begin my tenth year of
writing this column for Marlboro Cigarettes in your campus
newspaper. I will, in each column, say a few kind words about
Marlboros—just as you will, once you try that fine tobacco
flavor, that pristine white filter, that supple soft pack, that
infrangible Hip-Top box. These references to Marlboro will be
brief and unobtrusive, for I do not believe in the hard sell.
What I favor is the soft sell—you might even call it the limp
or spongy sell. I hasten to state that the makers of Marlboro
in ten full years have not once complained about my desultory
sales approach. Neither have they paid me.
But that is of small consequence. Aside from fleeting mentions
of Marlboro, this column has another, and more urgent, mission :
to cast the hot white light of free inquiry upon the vexing
questions that trouble college America—questions like "Should
the Student Council have the power to levy tariffs? and "Are
roommates sanitary?" and "Should housemothers be com
oelled to retire upon reaching the age of 20?"
Perhaps, reasoning together, we can find the answers. Fer
haps not. But if wc fail, let it never be said that it was for
want of trying.
I thank you. © i B o 3 m„ Bhuim«
