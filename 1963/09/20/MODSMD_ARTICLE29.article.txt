# Vacation Travel Varies

The three week between-quar
ters vacation is a highly regarded
institution at each of Stanford's
Overseas Campuses.
Unlike most vacations, how
ever, this three week period is not
approached as a time for ex
tended rest and recuperation. In
deed, the vacation is not consid
ered a vacation per se at all. but
rather an integrated part of a
student's European academic ex
perience. Thus the question of
how to spend the time comes
down to a philosophical debate:
concentrated study of one coun
try or area, such as staying with
a family, or seeing as much of
Europe as possible.
THIRTY-TWO MEMBERS of a
recent overseas group were inter
viewed prior to their Christmas
vacation as to how they intended
-o spend the three week period.
The diversity of their answers
suggests that vacations, like
everything else in a student's
.stay in Europe, are intensely in
dividual experiences.
One student interviewed made
a typical statement as to her

reasons for spending all three
weeks in France, nine days of
that with a family in Paris: "I
aine to France in order to learn
the language and to know the
people. I want to spend all my
time doing it, because I think
that that is more important than
to travel in all of Europe."
Other students spend their
time with families in other coun
tries. A good number are former
American Field Service Exchange
students and use this opportunity
10 revisit their foreign family of
high school days. Some students
combine both travel and time
with families, many once again
with exchange-student friends.
A STUDENT outlined her ex
tensive travel plans: "My room
mate and 1 are going to see the
British Isles. I'm dragging her to
he wilds of Ireland to see where
my Irish temper comes from."
One student, who prefered to
spend all his time traveling, made
a philosophical statement for
"the other side": "I am going to
London, Zurich, Vienna, Venice,
Florence, and the French Riviera.

Because I am not staying over
the third quarter and most likely
won't be returning to Europe for
many years, I plan to see as much
as possible of what I have been
told are the key centers of inter
est."
MANY STUDENTS are wary
of travelling the prescribed tour
ist routes in the prescribed man
ner. As a result, hitch-hiking has
garnered a large number of de
votees. One group of four travel
lers said they planned to spend
their vacation hitching around
the Peloponnesus. "We will spend
Christmas wherever we find a
welcome," their spokesman com
mented.
One student frankly admit led
that his itinerary meant that he
would "see all but not well." It
is a desire to see "well" that re
strains many students from set
ting distance records during the
thit?e week interum. But exten
sive, as well as intensive travel
does have its staunch advocates.
