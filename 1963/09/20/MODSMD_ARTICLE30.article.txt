# Walker: Regulation Needed
## 
### 
"We have found that most students ait* ladies and gentlemen, j
but we need regulations for those who aren't." Thus Robert A. j
Walker, director of the Overseas Campuses Program, summarized
the disciplinary philosophy on which the Overseas Campuses are j
run.
Walker went on to say, "By and large, I think that the students j
overseas have demonstrated great responsibility in their conduct." j
He estimated that there have been only about 10 serious cases out
of approximately 1,500 students sent over thus far.
The Overseas Campuses director described existing soeial regula
tions as minimal, given the overseas situation, and he emphasized
that regulations are a direct reflection of general university policy.
He added, "We find that our regulations are much less strict than
those of other schools in similar situations. For example, I believe
that Syracuse University permits no travel on weekends at all."
TIIE PHYSICAL PLANTS of the overseas campuses themselves
- what one student termed "fish bowl living"â€”create a rather spe
cial disciplinary climate. Walker noted, "Breaches of good taste or
of conduct which would create relatively little problem at home may
well affect the morale of the whole group and thus the success of
the session if nothing is done about them.
"Of course, overseas, any case creates great excitement because
of the tight living situation. Everyone knows everyone else. Every
one has an opinion. Things that would go virtually unnoticed on
quad are exaggerated way out of proportion over there."
ON 10 SPECIAL SITUATION which has no parallel on the home
campus developed in a recent overseas group. Several students ex
pressed a desire to leave the program at the end of the first quarter.
The university told these students that strong disciplinary action
would result and possible dismissal. Only one student actually did
leave, and action was taken against him. In addition, of course, the
student lost the money he had prepaid for tuition and room and
board.
Walker explained the Overseas Campuses Office's position in such
a situation: "Because of University costs, we insist that students
remain the full term. . . . Part of the problem is, of course, that
we can't replace students overseas. We'd merely be paying the stu
dent's way to Europe, and, finally, the situation would be uncon
trollable."
It has been observed that the apparent power of the student judi
cial body is curtailed on the overseas campuses in favor of adminis
trative authority. Walker, however, denied any great discrepancy.
"Technically, the same situation exists on quad," he explained.
THE STUDENT JUDICIAL Council is essentially a recommenda
tory body. The dean's office has final authority. Both the overseas
and the home campus situations are virtually the same in this
respect."
Walker concluded by stressing again that the problems of dis
cipline have been few. "The problems we've had are with a small
minority who think they're going over to Europe on some kind of a
binge. Only laix-r they find out that we re quite serious about enforc
ing our regulations."
