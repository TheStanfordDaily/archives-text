ON SKIT. 21, 1957 President
Wallace Sterling announced final
plans for the Stanford Study Cen
ter in Germanyâ€” first of its kind
operated by an American Univer
sity.
The centor, located outside the
village of Beutelsbach, 12 miles
from Stuttgart, would occupy a
thirty-acre estate named Land
gut Burg. It would accommo
date a group of sixty-three stu
dents- 22 men and 30 women, he
said.
After the first session from
June 30 to December 1958, groups
would rotate every second quar
ter thereafter.
Under study for nearly a year,
plans were facilitated by a $15,-
000 grant from the Fund for the
Advancement of Education. Part
of the funds were used to send
a four man survey team to Beu
telsbaeh and the rest was devoted
to such special costs as installa
tion of a small library, Dr. Ster
ling reported.
Members of the Stanford sur
vey team explained their selec
tion of the site for the center:
"The distance from Stuttgart is
12 miles. This provides us with
both the isolation desirable for
a residential university branch
and proximity to a great cultural
center.
"Stuttgart, a city of 620,000 in
habitants, is the capital of the
State of Raden-Wuerttcmberg. It
is centrally located in southern
Germany with easy rail connec
tions to Vienna. Rome, Paris,
Switzerland, and the rest of west
ern Europe. The state supports
a year-around opera, a theater,
and a concert series and the city
also supports a theater.
"There is a technical university
with 7,000 students in Stuttgart
and nearby is the famous Univer
sity of Tubingen. The presidents
of both assured us the fullest co
operation in scheduling visiting
lectures and making available
their facilities."
Beutelsbach, with population

3,000, is itself rich in historic
relics and traditions.
Founded in 1902 the town be
came a royal city by the marriage
of a local aristocrat's daughter to
the Duke of Wuerttemberg and
thus boasts Landgut Burg, the
lormer duchess's residence.
Traces of formal gardens and a
pavilion still remain behind
"Stanford Haus."
Many houses in the center of
Beutelsbach date back to the
sixteenth century. Underground
tunnels lead from the Middle
Ages church to Landgut Burg to
a once-existing neighboring vil
lages. The Beutelsbach children
use these World War II pillboxes
as "forts."
OX JUNE 24, 1958 Stanford-in-
Germany was dedicated.
President Wallace Sterling flew
to Stuttgart in time for the open
ing ceremonies which were also
attended by German government
and education leaders.
News releases covering the
event defined Stanford-in-Ger
many as an extension of the Gen
eral Studies program, designed
to make available the educational
advantages of living, studying
and traveling abroad, without in
terrupting or extending the usual
four-year undergraduate educa
tion course.
ON MAY 13, 1959 President
Sterling and Professor F. W.
Strothmann received high decora
tions from the Pi-esident of the
Federal Republic of Germany for
"promoting international under
standing and good will," in par
ticular the establishment of a
Stanford campus in Germany.
Consul General of Germany
presented the decoration at the
consulate office in San Francisco.
Dr. Sterling received the Com
mander's Cross of the Order of
Merit of the Federal Republic of
Germany. Professor Strothmann
received the Officer's Cross of the
same order.
Professor Strothmann origi
nated the idea of a campus
abroad and located the site. He
was director and member of the
faculty with the first group of
students.
"It is felt that the two gentle
men have not only promoted
German-American understanding
but have also made an extremely
valuable contribution to Euro
pean-American relations as a
whole," the Consul General said.
(President Sterling received simi
' lar honors upon the opening of
i Stanford branches in Italy and
France, 1960.)
