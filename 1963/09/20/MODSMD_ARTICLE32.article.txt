"One of the most exciting 1 ex
periences of my stay was the visit
to the Sistine Chapel during the
field trip to Rome. The chapel is
one of those places whose full
beauty and impact cannot he cap
tured by photographs or repro
ductions. Its frescoes served as
my introduction to Michelangelo,
and the experience of seeing and
studying his work transformed
my attitude toward all art and
replaced interest with excite
ment."
