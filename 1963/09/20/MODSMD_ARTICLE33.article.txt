# Spindler Notes Growth Of Thought, Viewpoint

### 
First impressions of a country often change to carefully con
sidered views as students increase in experience and deepen their
acquaintance with the country's cities, language and people.
Professor George Spindler, Education and Anthropology, noticed
growth and development of student thought during his residence at
Stanford-in-Germany. In an address to Stanford's Community Com
mittee for International Students on "Learning to Understand
Others," Professor Spindler explained his observation:
"After the students had been in Germany for one week, I asked
them to write down their first impressions of the German people.
The question put to them was: 'What are your impressions of Ger
many and the Germans?' Here is what nearly 70 per cent answered:
'The Germans are friendly. They are extraordinarily hospitable.
They are very helpful. They are much more sincere than Americans
in their contacts with people. They all seem to be very intelligent.
They are a very clean people. They are characterized by a typical
kind of European relaxation. All the children seem to have good
manners.'
"THERE WAS LITTLE awareness of the fact that they had seen
only a few Germans and that the Germans they had seen came of
a local and restricted area. They had no concept of their special
status as students and what this did to their relationships with other
people.
"At the end of three months I took another sample—same ques
tion, same students. This time they said: 'The Germans are intel
lectually unstimulating. They are materialistic, in fact they're more
materialistic than Americans. They are indifferent to political prob
lems. They lack spontaneity. They are apathetic about everything
that does not concern them directly. They are too obedient to au
thority and they have a very poor attitude toward World War 11.
"At the end of six months I took another sample—same question,
same students. In the meantime, they had stayed many weekends
with German families. They had traveled widely in Germany and
the rest of Europe. They had taken a number of field trips. They
had had some courses on German affairs. They were now relatively
experienced and their experience was somewhat more accelerated
than the experience that a foreign student would get here because
there was a self-conscious and purposeful effort to gear them into
German and European culture in general.
"IN THEIR THIRD impressions this is what they said: 'You
can't make any generalizations about the Germans. There are dif
ferences between rural and urban groups. There are differences
between age groups. There are definite regional differences in Ger
many that are not characteristic of America. Therefore, one can
make statements about particular groups of persons, but one can
make very few, if any, sweeping generalizations about Germans as
a whole.
"They stressed the diversities of Germany as a culture and as a
population. The objectivity of their statements was clear. One could
not accuse them of being particularly negative or particularly posi
tive. They tried to take a number of factors into account and then
salt the whole thing down with a very solid dash of objectivity and
diversity . . ."

"THERE WAS LITTLE awareness of the fact that they had seen
only a few Germans and that the Germans they had seen came of
a local and restricted area. They had no concept of their special
status as students and what this did to their relationships with other
people.
"At the end of three months I took another sample—same ques
tion, same students. This time they said: 'The Germans are intel
lectually unstimulating. They are materialistic, in fact they're more
materialistic than Americans. They are indifferent to political prob
lems. They lack spontaneity. They are apathetic about everything
that does not concern them directly. They are too obedient to au
thority and they have a very poor attitude toward World War 11.
"At the end of six months I took another sample—same question,
same students. In the meantime, they had stayed many weekends
with German families. They had traveled widely in Germany and
the rest of Europe. They had taken a number of field trips. They
had had some courses on German affairs. They were now relatively
experienced and their experience was somewhat more accelerated
than the experience that a foreign student would get here because
there was a self-conscious and purposeful effort to gear them into
German and European culture in general.
"IN THEIR THIRD impressions this is what they said: 'You
can't make any generalizations about the Germans. There are dif
ferences between rural and urban groups. There are differences
between age groups. There are definite regional differences in Ger
many that are not characteristic of America. Therefore, one can
make statements about particular groups of persons, but one can
make very few, if any, sweeping generalizations about Germans as
a whole.
"They stressed the diversities of Germany as a culture and as a
population. The objectivity of their statements was clear. One could
not accuse them of being particularly negative or particularly posi
tive. They tried to take a number of factors into account and then
salt the whole thing down with a very solid dash of objectivity and
diversity . . ."
First impressions of a country often change to carefully con
sidered views as students increase in experience and deepen their
acquaintance with the country's cities, language and people.
Professor George Spindler, Education and Anthropology, noticed
growth and development of student thought during his residence at
Stanford-in-Germany. In an address to Stanford's Community Com
mittee for International Students on "Learning to Understand
Others," Professor Spindler explained his observation:
"After the students had been in Germany for one week, I asked
them to write down their first impressions of the German people.
The question put to them was: 'What are your impressions of Ger
many and the Germans?' Here is what nearly 70 per cent answered:
'The Germans are friendly. They are extraordinarily hospitable.
They are very helpful. They are much more sincere than Americans
in their contacts with people. They all seem to be very intelligent.
They are a very clean people. They are characterized by a typical
kind of European relaxation. All the children seem to have good
manners.'
