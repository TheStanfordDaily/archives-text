# East German Refugee Flight Subject of Student Research

### GARY MESSINGER Germany Group X 
One of the greatest human migrations of all time—the flight of
12 million individuals from East to West Germany—gave seven
Stanford-in-Germany students inspiration for a special study project
last spring.

of Stanford's History Department
reading, interviewing and re
searching the impact of this popu
lation "explosion" on the nearbj
town of Beutelsbach.
A small peasant community
for centuries, this southwest Ger
man town has experienced man}
of the same problems as fast
growing California cities—th c
physical and social integration ol
migrants from distant states, the
rise of a "commuter" class, the
growth of local industry, and the
expansion of governmental serv
ices.
FROM THE MIDDLE AGES
through World War 11, Beutels
bach was a small, conservative,
almost totally Protestant, region
ally oriented community.
The post-war population boom
brought these trends to an end.
Doubled in size to 3,000, the com
munity now includes citizens
from practically every country
east of Germany. It serves both
as a suburb of Stuttgart and as
an independent village.
Village funds have built a new
elementary school (Volkschule).
One out of four children enrolled
comes from a former refugee
family. Their eagerness for edu
cation and their questioning spirit
challenge old answers and habits.
STANFORD STUDENTS found
all of the villagers conscious of
profound changes in their com
munity. "I was born here. . . .
It's so different now."
To be sure, Beutelsbach, like
all of West Germany, has today
almost fully recovered from the
migratory upheavals of World
War 11. Most refugees are settled
comfortably in their new homes.
And, with the building of the Ber
lin Wall in j961, a once virtual
torrent of newcomers has all but
abated.
Each year, fewer and fewer
refugees enter Beutelsbach, and
the problems of integration,
though still pressing, begin to
play themselves out. In the mean
time, however, they are forcing
a tiny German village into the
mainstream of the 20th century.
And this, for Beutelsbach, is prob
ably the most important political
effect of its entire experience
with West Germany's population
explosion. For, as one Western
observer has commented, "after
all, what is done to human be
ings is the grass roots of politics."
