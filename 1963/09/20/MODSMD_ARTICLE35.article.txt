# Berlin Sights Remain Vivid Impressions
## 
### 
Few places in Europe leave
their impressions on visitors'
memories as strongly as Berlin.
"Die Mauer" (The Wall), usu
ally the most striking sight in
the city, stimulates varying re
actions.
One student stared silently at
the wall, then turned to a friend.
"It's a cement paradox," he said.
"I can touch it, take pictures, talk
to the guards, see people leading
their daily lives just twenty feet
from it, and I'm sure I could
climb it if I wished. What makes
it so formidable?" Then he
stained again at the rusty barbed
wire and sharp slivers of glass
crowning the Wall.
Learning what the Wall means
in human terms can be a vivid
experience. One student met a
German girl who had grown up
in East Berlin. How long had she
lived in the West? "Two months,"
she said. "I escaped through the
Wall just a while ago, and then
sweated for a month while my
parents got through." She would
say no more about it."I can't,"
she axplained. "The route is still
in use."
THINKING THIS OVER later,
the student said, "it's not that I
suddenly felt I had been naive
all my life. It's just that life be
fore that moment had never
stared me in the face quite so in
tensely."
Stanford student memories of
Berlin, however, have not been
confined to the Wall. Some
groups rccall Berlin's May Day
parades, at which Mayor Will
Brandt usually speaks to over a
million people in West Berlin
while, on the other side of the
city, troops, mobilized youth
groups, and banner-carrying Com
munist activities tramp past a
reviewing stand.
For each Stanford group, th e
city has been a place of impres
sive experiences, from humorous
ones to the profoundly serious.
Many students feel Berlin is one
city in Europe which is a "little
bit of everything which makes
the twentieth century what it is."

city has been a place of impres
sive experiences, from humorous
ones to the profoundly serious.
Many students feel Berlin is one
city in Europe which is a "little
bit of everything which makes
the twentieth century what it is."
Few places in Europe leave
their impressions on visitors'
memories as strongly as Berlin.
"Die Mauer" (The Wall), usu
ally the most striking sight in
the city, stimulates varying re
actions.
One student stared silently at
the wall, then turned to a friend.
"It's a cement paradox," he said.
"I can touch it, take pictures, talk
to the guards, see people leading
their daily lives just twenty feet
from it, and I'm sure I could
climb it if I wished. What makes
it so formidable?" Then he
stained again at the rusty barbed
wire and sharp slivers of glass
crowning the Wall.
Learning what the Wall means
in human terms can be a vivid
experience. One student met a
German girl who had grown up
in East Berlin. How long had she
lived in the West? "Two months,"
she said. "I escaped through the
Wall just a while ago, and then
sweated for a month while my
parents got through." She would
say no more about it."I can't,"
she axplained. "The route is still
in use."
THINKING THIS OVER later,
the student said, "it's not that I
suddenly felt I had been naive
all my life. It's just that life be
fore that moment had never
stared me in the face quite so in
tensely."
Stanford student memories of
Berlin, however, have not been
confined to the Wall. Some
groups rccall Berlin's May Day
parades, at which Mayor Will
Brandt usually speaks to over a
million people in West Berlin
while, on the other side of the
city, troops, mobilized youth
groups, and banner-carrying Com
munist activities tramp past a
reviewing stand.
For each Stanford group, th e
city has been a place of impres
sive experiences, from humorous
ones to the profoundly serious.
Many students feel Berlin is one
city in Europe which is a "little
bit of everything which makes
the twentieth century what it is."
