# Italy's Villa San Paolo Has Illustrious History
## 
### 
In contrast to the modern build
ing housing Stanford students in
France, those who attend Stan
ford-in-Italy find that in addition
to the delights of studying in Flor
ence, they have the enjoyment of
living in elegant Villa San Paolo,
with its frescoes, gilt chandeliers,
marble floors and high ceilings.

The Villa, situated in the ter
raced Tuscan hills, was leased by
:e University from the Catholic
teaching order of the Barnabiti
vhich operates an adjacent boys'
-chool. It was run by them as v
lotel, and the hotel staff was re
■dried for Stanford-in-Italy.
Members of Group I describe
he Villa's illustrious history i:
their publication, "But Not a;
Tourists." They write:
Where the Villa stands at pre
ent. in 1400 a little tabernae'e
dedicated to the Madonna del la
Querce was erected. Over a cen
tury later, it was transformed int<-
a chapel which is said to have
been painted and decorated b;,
Michelangelo.
DURING THE SIEGE of Flor
ence in 1529. the oratory was com
pletely destroyed, but in 1552
Bishop Ludovico Serristori di Bit
tetto under the auspices of Pope
Julius 111 and Cosimo II di' Me
dici had it fully restored. Later
the oratory was turned into a villa
and rebuilt.
In 1774 Grand Duke Peter Leo
pold I acquired the Albmayr prop
erty, composed of two villas, one
on the right and one on the left
of the street.
A subterranean passage con
nected the two villas, and was
clearly in evidence even towards
the end of the 19th century, long
after the Grand Duke had left
Tuscany. It is likely that the tun
nel served amorous adventures, or
was designed as an escape route.
The locality boasts notable
memories. It is said that Dante
used to pass long hours in medi
tation on the property of a nearby
monastery.
NOT FAR IS VILLA Palmieri,
described by Boccaccio in the
Decameron as the place where
the characters of his work went
on the second day of their ac
quaintance. Subsequently the
Villa served as residence to Queen
Victoria during her stays in Flor
ence.
The oldest part of the Villa San
i Paolo is composed of large rooms
j and a bar on the ground floor
i with offices and teachers' apart
ments upstairs. The walls and
ceilings downstairs and the ceil
ings above the marble staircase
! near the entrance were covered
j with frescoes by the students of
! Ingres, the French neoclassicist
in the first half of the nineteenth
i century. The master himself
painted some of the faces on the
j ceiling.
Later, the walls were white
washed, but then the Barnabiti
iFalhers took over the Villa in
: 1920, Padre Rienzi, who super
j vises the staff and manages the
hotel, had the frescoes on the
walls of the main room down
i stairs uncovered.

NOT FAR IS VILLA Palmieri,
described by Boccaccio in the
Decameron as the place where
the characters of his work went

The oldest part of the Villa San

in the first half of the nineteenth

painted some of the faces on the

Later, the walls were white
washed, but then the Barnabiti

The Villa, situated in the ter
