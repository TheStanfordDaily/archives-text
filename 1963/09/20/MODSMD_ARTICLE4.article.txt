### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
Vice Provost Robert J. Wert
shared the podium with Wilfred
H. Stone, Associate Professor of
English, as the two addressed
freshmen yesterday morning on
the academic aspects of their new
life at Stanford.
WERT, who spoke first, re
minded the frosh, "We live in an
exciting and vexing time." He
emphasized that studies are more
serious for freshmen today be
cause of the great pressures of
the world around them.
In describing Stanford's ideal
• Icstiny, Wert quoted philosopher
William James who once com
mented, "The world is only be
ginning to see that its wealth
consists ... of the number of
superior men it harbors." Wert
added, "This is very true. . . . The
fundamental and pressing prob
lem of the world is the conquest
by ideas."
Wert told the freshmen that,
"Stanford's goal is producing
superior students, developing to
the fullest the potential in each
individual." He listed some of the
innovations that are moving Stan
ford toward the achievement of
this goal: smaller classes, an in
creasingly distinguished faculty,
a revised General Studies Pr o
gram, the initiation of honors pro
grams and tutorial work, the
Overseas Campuses, and the fac
ulty Associate Program.
WERT NOTED that the essen
tial strength of the university's
consists in 1 lie interaction of the

faculty, the student body, a n d
their common environment. "All
must be of superior quality," he
said.
Wert went on to explain the
PACE Program and its relevance
to the academic life of (he fresh
man. He stressed that the success
of the fund-raising campaign di
rectly affects the educational life
of the Stanford student'. Wert
emphasized that the tuition
charge only pays for half of the
cost of educating a student.
Moreover, the attraction of a cap
able faculty leads to raises in
salaries, while the number of stu
dents stays roughly the same
over the years.
"Stanford's aim is always to
have enough financial and work
opportunities to allow any quali
fied student to attend." he said.
Wert concluded by describing
the surge of building activity that
has recently occurred on the Stan
ford campus. He noted that re
cent construction is only the be
ginning of the most extensive
building program since Stanford's
founding.
WILFRED H. STONE gave
freshmen "an explicit and fac
tual rundown of the nature of
the freshman English program."
Stone suggested facetiously
that the Freshman English Pro
gram is "a bit like a camel—you
know what a camel is, a horse
designed by a committee." Al
though admitting that the pro
gram was, indeed, designed by a
committee, Stone amended his

commentary saying, "We've made
notable efforts this year to make
it flexible enough to fit more
of your various needs."
In the course of describing the
regular and special English pro
grams Stone noted that the re
medial English section has been
discontinued. He commented.
" 'Bonehcad' English has been
eliminated because the boneheads
have been eliminated. . . . You
are all gifted children."
Stone described the regular
Freshman English Program as "a
course in reading, writing, and
thinking." Admitting that one
cannot really "teach" a course in
thinking, he emphasized that all
three processes are inter-related
and indispensible to one another.
"The ability to think clearly and
read critically is indispensible to
writing well."
Stone listed the components of
the regular course: choosing a
subject, approaching a subject,
handling the language, defining
the subject, and arguing the sub
ject. He advised the freshmen to
"conceive of all work as leading
up to and involving definition,
definition with clarity and sim
plicity."
By way of an explanation and
a warning, Stone told the fresh
man that acceptable writing at
Stanford is considered to be on
the level of "publishablc prose"
—that which would be acceptable
to a professional journal of rela
tively high standards. However,
Stone advised the freshmen not
to worry about grades, at least
not at first. He explained that
grades on the first four English
papers are not revealed so as to
avoid what he termed "grade
trauma."
Stone stressed that Ihe Fresh
man English Program works on
a philosophy of realistically
lenient grading whi c h takes
steady improvement into consid
eration. He added, "Grades are
by-products, like happiness, which
you do not go out and seek with
success—at least not in Fresh
man English."
