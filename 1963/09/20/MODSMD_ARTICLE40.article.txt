# Music Abundant In Florentine Life
## 
### 
In Florence opportunities to
listen to and create both Ameri
can and Italian music are abun
dant, and these opportunities in
no way suffer from lack of fa
cilities.
The Villa has a piano and stu
dents, as at the other campuses,
bring with them guitars, small
instruments and, of course, their
voices.
THOSE WHO DO PLAY or
sing, individually or in groups,
are reminded that they have a gift
which opens doors of European
society, especially for student
groups. The Italians anticipate
hearing and learning American
songs, and are anxious to recipro
cate with their own.
FLORENCE itself offers the
Italian music that cannot be ig
nored. The crowning touch of
Florentine musical life comes
with the "Maggio Musicale" each
May. Opera, symphony, and cham
ber music are in abundance and
unsurpassed excellence.
Italy's main efforts always lay
with the opera. Nevertheless, the
proximity of fine symphonies, led
by world-renowned conductors,
encourages the students at Stan
ford-in-Italy to attend.
Every Sunday afternoon, from
October through April, the Palaz
zo Vecchio provides the setting
for a fine concert series. It is held
in the magnificant "Salome dei
Cinquencento," where the listener
is surrounded by huge tapestries
and statues.
ON SATURDAY afternoons the
"Amici della Musica" presents
concerts at the "Teatro Comu
nale" or at "La Pergola" theater.
During the winter season, these
same theaters host opera. Excel
lent opera can also be heard in
Rome, Naples, and Bologna. A
visit to "La Scala" and "La Pic
cola Scala"—a less grandiose but
a fine opera house—in Milan is
well worth one's while.
"In somma," one side of the
Stanford student's experience in
Europe should be a musical one,
regardless of previous interest in
music. The opportunities to create
or absorb are numerous and va
ried.

THOSE WHO DO PLAY or
sing, individually or in groups,
are reminded that they have a gift
which opens doors of European
society, especially for student
groups. The Italians anticipate
hearing and learning American
songs, and are anxious to recipro
cate with their own.
FLORENCE itself offers the
Italian music that cannot be ig
nored. The crowning touch of
Florentine musical life comes
with the "Maggio Musicale" each
May. Opera, symphony, and cham
ber music are in abundance and
unsurpassed excellence.
Italy's main efforts always lay
with the opera. Nevertheless, the
proximity of fine symphonies, led
by world-renowned conductors,
encourages the students at Stan
ford-in-Italy to attend.
Every Sunday afternoon, from
October through April, the Palaz
zo Vecchio provides the setting
for a fine concert series. It is held
in the magnificant "Salome dei
Cinquencento," where the listener
is surrounded by huge tapestries
and statues.
ON SATURDAY afternoons the
"Amici della Musica" presents
concerts at the "Teatro Comu
nale" or at "La Pergola" theater.
During the winter season, these
same theaters host opera. Excel
lent opera can also be heard in
Rome, Naples, and Bologna. A
visit to "La Scala" and "La Pic
cola Scala"—a less grandiose but
a fine opera house—in Milan is
well worth one's while.
"In somma," one side of the
Stanford student's experience in
Europe should be a musical one,
regardless of previous interest in
music. The opportunities to create
or absorb are numerous and va
ried.
