# New Art Course Designed for Italy

To achieve both an emotional
I and objective understanding of
I art was the purpose of an un
usual program of drawing origi
nated by Associate Professor of
Art Matt Kahn for undergradu
ates attending Stanford's over
seas campus at Florence, Italy,
i Kahn gave two reasons for the
! program. First he said, "drawing
from works of art is an excellent
! way to study them, as one be
• comes much more acutely aware
of the subtleties of a work of art
: through drawing than by more
! casual looking. Also, in the study
| of art the student should feel
! some empathy with the creative
| process and some sense of the
I emotion and intellectual expendi-
I ture that goes into a work of art.
: No amount of traditional study
' can make a student understand
how committed an artist is to his
work as well as getting similarly
committed.''
STUDY IN FLORENCE ha s
special value because students
■ are living in a great art center
and have the unique opportunity
I to explore beyond the restraints
I of the textbook, to see, study and
! appreciate the works of art about
i which they have read at school,
I arul to discover works not previ
ously known to them, even
J through books.
j Because of their lack of previ
ous training in art, drawing was
not required of the students first
I quarter, but was rather urged
and encouraged. However, Kahn
was pleased to find that practi
| cally all the students chose to
I draw and considered the experi
| ence very rewarding.
Fall quarter each student chose
a period or personality in art
from Greek to Baroque and spe
j cialized on this subject. In-I
structed to "become experts in
your field," the students not only
did academic research in books,
but did personal research, visit
ing works of art again and again,
drawing them, learning to know
them visually, academically, and !
| emotionally.
KAHN NOTES that many stu
dents explored "quite beyond the
limitations of their own project
and in ways that will leave them
! culturally oriented. "I did not ex
| pert so many to do this," of those
who got involved, many became
dedicated. So many students are
much more aware- and their own
subjective experience is the key
| to this."
The winter quarter art course,
i entitled "The New Renaissance in
j Italian Visual Arts," also included
a study of modern movements in
art all over the world. Again stu
dents chose a special subject on
i which they wrote a report.
Kahn hoped students would
j come away from the experience
"thoroughly familiar with Italian
j art, but, more important, capable
j of mature and sensitive response
to art anywhere."

"Stanford in France — perhaps
ht k most meaningful experience
is not represented by living 1 with
liis group in France, but living
.vithin this group —the more cas
ual atmosphere of social relation
ships which promotes a greater
understanding — the opportunity
to know professors as people,
rather than as facts-dispensed —
the awareness and knowledge of
others as individuals —the gradual
realization of learning more about
ourselves through eontaet with
others."

j cialized on this subject. In-I

did academic research in books,

ing works of art again and again,
drawing them, learning to know
them visually, academically, and !

KAHN NOTES that many stu
dents explored "quite beyond the
limitations of their own project
and in ways that will leave them
! culturally oriented. "I did not ex

who got involved, many became
dedicated. So many students are
much more aware- and their own
subjective experience is the key

The winter quarter art course,

a study of modern movements in

to art anywhere."
