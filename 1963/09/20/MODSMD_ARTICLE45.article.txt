# French Profs Employ Variety, Flexibility in SIF Instruction
## 
### 
Stanford-in-France opened three years ago with ten French pro
fessors on its staff. Al! ten have remained, and there is no sign of
their ever leaving. Director Paul LeMoal explains that lie deliber
ately tried to select those who would like their job. LeMoal attrib
utes their satisfaction to three main reasons: the Stanford courses
are a change from their own jobs; they have an importance in inter
national relations; they are challenging to teach.
All ton are 'agrege' teachers which is the highest title given to
an instructor in France. It takes longer to receive the aggregation
than the doctorate degree in the United States and is more highly
regarded.
LeMoal's policy allows the professors to conduct their classes as
they choose so they can be 'free to adapt methods to their own per
sonality and the personalities of the students.' Thus, the courses
are primarily taught as they are to French students and employ a
variety of techniques.
Material, however, is necessarily geared to the level of French
ability of the students. There are five French groups, group one
being the lowest and group five the highest. The groups are flexible
so that it is possible to move to a higher or lower group if the ad
ministration and teacher feel there is justification.
To supplement the French courses, Madame LeMoal and Assist
ant Director Jean Marty, who is a phonetics specialist, organized a
phonetics laboratory last year. The administration feels the lab has
made a 'ti-emendous improvement' in the speaking ability of the stu
dents Students repeat after a recorded model voice and listen back
to their reproductions. The instructor controls a master tape and can
interrupt to make corrections. The aim of this lab is to facilitate
French comprehension in the shortest possible time.

field trips have included Rome, Sicily, Barcelona, Madrid, Toledo,

utes their satisfaction to three main reasons: the Stanford courses
are a change from their own jobs; they have an importance in inter
national relations; they are challenging to teach.
All ton are 'agrege' teachers which is the highest title given to
an instructor in France. It takes longer to receive the aggregation
than the doctorate degree in the United States and is more highly
regarded.
LeMoal's policy allows the professors to conduct their classes as
they choose so they can be 'free to adapt methods to their own per
sonality and the personalities of the students.' Thus, the courses
are primarily taught as they are to French students and employ a
variety of techniques.
Material, however, is necessarily geared to the level of French
ability of the students. There are five French groups, group one
being the lowest and group five the highest. The groups are flexible
so that it is possible to move to a higher or lower group if the ad
ministration and teacher feel there is justification.
To supplement the French courses, Madame LeMoal and Assist
ant Director Jean Marty, who is a phonetics specialist, organized a
phonetics laboratory last year. The administration feels the lab has
made a 'ti-emendous improvement' in the speaking ability of the stu
dents Students repeat after a recorded model voice and listen back
to their reproductions. The instructor controls a master tape and can
interrupt to make corrections. The aim of this lab is to facilitate
French comprehension in the shortest possible time.


STANFORD STUDENTS on a field trip to Madrid surround a tradi

Madrid singing old Spanish folk songs. The students' enthusiastic
reception encouraged the Tuna to invite them to a national com
petition of Tunas during their free days at the end of the trip. Campus
field trips have included Rome, Sicily, Barcelona, Madrid, Toledo,
Bonn, Berlin, Bruges, and Brussels.


STANFORD-IN-FRANCE students march resolutely down a rain

town's magnificent tenth century chateau, originally constructed
as a fortress. It is a formidable, massive gray building from the
outside t>nly, for the fifteenth century interior reveals rich furnish
ings and decorations. Students toured the building with the aid
of an automatic guide, a recorded explaination which revealed
the history of each room.
