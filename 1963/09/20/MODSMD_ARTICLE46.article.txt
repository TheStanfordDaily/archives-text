Field trips form a vital and en
joyable part of a student's stay
overseas. Each campus has insti
tuted two major organized field
trips during the six month period.
Typical of such excursions was
a recent Stanford-in-France's
group trip to Rome. At a cost of
$32 per student, all transporta
tion, meals, lodging, tours, and
admission into museums and
monuments were taken care of.
TWO SIGHT SEEING BUSSES,
equipped with sound systems
with two young ecclesiastics at
the microphone, chauffeured the
Stanford students through five
.ours. The young priests/guides'
love of the eternal city and knowl
edge of its history carried
hrough to the students as they
visited the Vatican, Renaissance
and Baroque Rome, the Forum
ind the Palatine, and the catac
ombs.
In addition to the tours, the
group was given an audience
with the late Pope John XXIII

amid the shouts and cheers of the j
crowds gathered in the reception
room of St. Peters.
AFTER HAVING BEEN intro
duced to true Italian spaghetti
and white wine at their lodging,
Casa Palotti, the students left
their rooms that overlooked the
gentle Tiber River and began j
their first tour.
