# 'Tour of Tours' Sparks French History Interest
## 
### 
Stanford's center in Tours,;
France, is itself of rather recent
construction, but it is situated in
an area of long traditions and rich
history. This proximity often pro
vides a useful tie-in with students'
current academic experiences at
the center.
Typical of students' discoveries
and explorations of Tours, was
an informal tour of the town tak
en by members of Stanford-In-
France Group V and their Stan
ford history professor, Dr. Gavin
A. Langmuir.
The TOUR WAS conducted by
Monsieur Yves Paillet, a local
lawyer and amateur historian
who, with his wife, has been one
of Stanford-in-France's staunchest
friends throughout the campus's
four-year life.
THE DAY WAS a history pro
fessor's delight as the students

: went through the square where
j Urbain preached for the Crusade,
i where Saint Louis came to pray
for his country. As each of the
eighty Stanford students at the
French center was then engaged
in writing term papers on Saint
Louis, their own knowledge com
bined with the enthusiastic and
flowing French of Monsieur Pail
let made the experience one of
living history.
The tour was typical of groups
in Tours in several ways: The
break between classroom lectures,
and week-end travel is sometimes
imperceptible. Professors and
students discovering "histoire
vivante," together in the narrow
streets of the medieval section of
town is a sensation one cannot
obtain as a middle-aged tourist
it is a sensation perhaps peculiar
to Stanford overseas.
