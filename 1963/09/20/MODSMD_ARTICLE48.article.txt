# It's about the plumbing...

(Excerpt from a Letter Homo)
My roommate and I were just

| holding our nightly conversation
I on life, men, truth, and men. She
| was loaning, but ever so lightly,
| on the sink, which was attached
in a seemingly normal fashion to
ihe wall of our cubicle. Suddenly,
wiih a terrific crash, she and
the sink fell to the floor. Obvi
ously there was only one thing
1o do we laughed hysterically
for five minutes.
Unfortunately, I can't say as
I this was the first time we had
j no'iced the pumbing in our room
iw is not in A-l condition. The
i shower had a tendency to over
| flow after 3L> minutes.
TISE NEXT MORNING the con
j eierge kept shaking her head as
I 1 gestured, grimaced, and stam
! merer). I think my problem was
compounded by the fact I didn't
I know the word for "sink."
