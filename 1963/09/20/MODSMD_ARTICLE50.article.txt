# Assets of Tours Include Directors Marty, Le Moal

One of the greatest problems i
' with the Stanford-in-France pro
gram is the student's expectation !
I that all Frenchmen will be like
the S t a n 112 or d Directors Jean ;
Marty and Paul LcMoal. The two j
men run an efficient and top-j
flight academic program with a
neverending banter that students
have suggested writing down and
publishing.
A perpetually-smiling pipe
| smoking Frenchman, a scholar
j whose work has taken him from j
i the Sorbonne to Yale, and a man
who laments the lack of close
student-faculty relation s in
French Universities is Paul Le
| Moal, director of Stanford Uni-
I versity's campus in Tours, France.
I also serves as an English profes
' sor at the University of Poitiers. !
THE DIRECTOR'S double role
j affords a unique opportunity for
comparison. "American students
i have less complexes so far as fae
j ulty members are concerned than j
j French students," notes LeMoal |
| "It is very difficult to make !
j French students speak in class." j
LeMoal's ideal of student-fac-;
ulty relations reveals his basic
humanity that makes him much
of the driving force of the Uni
i versity's program in France.
"There is not now in France the
immense gap between faculty and
students" that previously existed
but LeMoal feels lhat his 'Tela
i tions with the American students
! at Stanford are much closer than
i with the French students in Poit
i iers. We are trying to reverse
| the current fin France]; close
j student-faculty relations are still
j almost exceptional, but it is
changing.
"SO FAR AS Stanford in
France is meant to be no break
in the students' studies, I am glad j
! there is American faculty here—;
j also because I find them to be
interesting people. But. what ;
could be an objection is the stu-1
dents thereby speak English half |
the day."
LeMoal is insistent, however,
i that there should not be a higher |
French requirement for residence
at the French campus. "At the
beginning I was suspicious," he
j notes. When he discovered Stan
ford's plan to send over a cross
section of the University, he
thought "difficulties would he
greater than they are. Rut I dis
covered that after five or six
weeks, people knew enough I
French to carry on a conversation j
and understand a lecture in i
French."
JEAN MARTY, scholar, accom
plished jazz pianist, and charm- 1
! ing human being, is beginning his :
third year as assistant director of
Stanford-in-France with the cur-J
rent Group VII, leaving Monday.
After working with two groups:
of Stanford students, Monsieur
Marty makes several comparisons
j between them and his students at
the nearby University of Poitiers.
"That which I like least about
American students is their ina
daptability," notes Marty, "an
inadaptability to ways of life, in
| tellectual and academic tradi
tions, etc. What do I like most?
j Everything else: their spontane
ity, their kindness, their opti
mism. everything. Everything,
that is, except for the fact that
we can't change them—not even
i a little."
MARTY NOTICES two main
| differences between coming be

lore a class of Stanford students
and a class of French University
students: "The American audi
ence seems more apt to react to
what you say. Also, the girls are
knitting; they shouldn't."

"Stanford in France is located
near one of the g-reat intellectual
centers of the world —tlie Sor
bnnne in Paris. The opportunities
provided by sui li proximity are
limited only by the student's own
initiative."
