## Dazed Frosh Roam Quad; 1282 Arrive for Pre-Reg 
### 
Freshman pre-reglstration week brought: about an increase of
.282 in Stanford's population Wednesday as a class "probably as
aried as we have seen" poured into the campus.
According to Douglas A. Walker, Associate Director uf Admis
ions, the freshmen come from a wide range of socio-economic and

educational backgrounds and
nany fields of achievement;
'more students have been ad
.nitted who have shown unusual
.nventiveness, particularly in
cience or the creative arts," he
;aid.
FORTY-FIVE PERCENT of
them have already indicated a
choice of major field. At least 50
ire Merit Scholars.
Statistics released by the Ad
nissions Office show the ratio
still holding up w i th 848 men
and 434 women, who were se
lected from a field of roughly
6,500 applicants. Roble and Bran
nor respectively are the new
homes for 248 and 169 dollies;
Wilbur houses 720 men and Stern
about 125.
Housing for the new frosh was
presented with one difficulty
when more girls than expected
decided to actually come after
being accepted.
TEX ARE staying in Huston
House; several others, who live
within commuting distance, have
been requested to live at home.
Whether this will be a temporary
or permanent solution cannot yet
be determined, according to the
Housing Department.
About half of the class comes
from California, as expected; 16
foreign countries are represented,
as is every state except Delaware,
Kentucky, Georgia, North Caro
lina. Maine and Mississippi.
THE SECOND-BEST repre
sented state is Illinois, for the
second year in a row; Walker
credits this primarily to a very
active alumni group there. Wash
ington, Oregon, and Colorado are
respectively third, fourth, and
fifth. At least 20'/r of the frosh
are from states east of the Mis
sissippi.
Other than freshmen, new stu
dents include 278 transfer stu
dents, 237 men and 41 women.
According to Walker, the concen
tration of Californians among the
transfers is much less than with
the frosh.
In addition, there are now alto
gether over 550 foreign students,
he added, in the graduate and
undergraduate divisions. This
ranks Stanford among the first
ten U.S. colleges with numbers
of foreign students.
FROSH IMPRESSIONS of
Stanford were understandably
rather vague Wednesday as they
rushed around in the confusion
of unpacking and finding their
way around. Of those inter
viewed by The Daily many were
impressed by the friendliness and
organization of the sponsors and
Ihe pre-reg committees. Com
ments on the campus ranged
from "huge" and "beautiful" to
"just about as expected." One
student from Colorado was struck
by the number of trees.
On her way to investigate Tre
sidder, one new co-ed typified the
situation of many freshmen;
"It's great, but I'm lost."

within commuting distance, have
been requested to live at home.

About half of the class comes
from California, as expected; 16
foreign countries are represented,
as is every state except Delaware,
Kentucky, Georgia, North Caro
lina. Maine and Mississippi.
THE SECOND-BEST repre
sented state is Illinois, for the
second year in a row; Walker
credits this primarily to a very
active alumni group there. Wash
ington, Oregon, and Colorado are
respectively third, fourth, and
fifth. At least 20'/r of the frosh
are from states east of the Mis
sissippi.
Other than freshmen, new stu
dents include 278 transfer stu
dents, 237 men and 41 women.
According to Walker, the concen
tration of Californians among the
transfers is much less than with
the frosh.
In addition, there are now alto
gether over 550 foreign students,
he added, in the graduate and
undergraduate divisions. This
ranks Stanford among the first
ten U.S. colleges with numbers
of foreign students.
FROSH IMPRESSIONS of
Stanford were understandably
rather vague Wednesday as they
rushed around in the confusion
of unpacking and finding their
way around. Of those inter
viewed by The Daily many were
impressed by the friendliness and
organization of the sponsors and
Ihe pre-reg committees. Com
ments on the campus ranged
from "huge" and "beautiful" to
"just about as expected." One
student from Colorado was struck
by the number of trees.
On her way to investigate Tre
sidder, one new co-ed typified the
situation of many freshmen;
"It's great, but I'm lost."
Freshman pre-reglstration week brought: about an increase of
.282 in Stanford's population Wednesday as a class "probably as
aried as we have seen" poured into the campus.
According to Douglas A. Walker, Associate Director uf Admis
ions, the freshmen come from a wide range of socio-economic and

educational backgrounds and
nany fields of achievement;
'more students have been ad
.nitted who have shown unusual
.nventiveness, particularly in
cience or the creative arts," he
;aid.
FORTY-FIVE PERCENT of

Statistics released by the Ad
