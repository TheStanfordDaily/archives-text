Stanford President Wallace
Sterling welcomed the 1,282 mem
bers of the freshman class of 1967
during the annual convocation
ceremony held Wednesday after
noon in Memorial Church.
In his convocation address,
Sterling exhorted the assembled
frosh to "count your blessings."
He reminded them, "This coun
try, whatever its imperfections
of policy and performance at
home and abroad, has provided
you with a goodly heritage. . . .
Your life is set in the context
and tradition of individual liberty,
and as a university student you
share now in an age-old univer
sity tradition of freedom to
learn . .
STERLING ASKED the assem
ble d students to reflect
on the meaning of "freedom" and
"learning." Pointing out that
both ideas are abstractions, he
added: "Freedom and learning
exist only when they find embodi
ment in an individual, when digni
fied by good use or debased Dy
abuse."
THE INFORMAL and formal
aspects of learning, he told the
freshmen, must be kept in bal
ance. He cited the old adage:
"All work and no play makes
Jack a dull boy" and addedâ€”
"But it also may be observed that
all play and no work makes Jack
even duller."
Sterling told the audience,
"Don't jump to the conclusion
that the student body is apa
thetic; remember that others may
have an intense interest in mat
ters which light no fires in your
breast."
"Knowledge begets humility."
Sterling concluded. "The learned
man has an appreciation of the
vastness of knowledge and a
knowledge and a sense of how
much there is to know that he
doesn't know. As knowledge be
gets humility, so does it begot
understanding, and understand
ing begets tolerance."
During the course of the con
vocation ceremony, Sterling hon
ored nineteen Stanford sopho
mores, twelve men and seven
women, for academic excellence
during their freshman year for
a cumulative grade point average
of 3.80. Two of them, Steven W.
Panics and Mary Louise Jones,
were given life memberships in
the Stanford Alumni Association
for "their service to the univer
sity, their academic excellence,
and their promise of leadership."
