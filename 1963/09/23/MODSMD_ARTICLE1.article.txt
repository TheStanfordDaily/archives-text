# Ragsdale Scores 4 TD's In Indian Rout of San Jose
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Sports Editor 
Dick Ragsdalc, last year's third string quarterback, became Stan
ford's biggest star Saturday as the revamped Indians swamped San
.lose State. 29-13, in the season's opener.
Ragsdale, switched to halfback last spring by new football coach
John Ralston, scored all four Stanford touchdowns, the longest a

51 yard run.
IF THE INDIANS, favored by
17 points, won by only 16, it was
because Ralston kept the first
string in for less lhan half the
game, and the reserve Green and
Blue squads were less adept at
penetrating the Spartan defenses.
But if the second and third
units couldn't score, the first
team had no difficulty. The first
time the Indian's got their hands
on the ball, they marched 72
yards for a touchdown, quarter
back Clark Weaver passing nine
yards to Ragsdale for the score.
Each time the first unit got
the ball they scored, twice on
Weaver's passes to Ragsdale,
twice on Ragsdale's runs. The
174 pound halfback's four touch
downs are a Stanford scoring
record.
S!LIT HAGSDALE wasn't the
whole Stanford attack Saturday.
Steve Thurlow, another former
quarterback, gained 69 yards in
eight uies. Weaver, in addition
to tossing two TD passes, gained
28 yards from the quarterback
spot. The team, as a whole,
gained ?39 yards, 31.5 on the
ground.
In spite of San Jose's superior
speed, it was the Indians who
monopolized the long runs. Wea
ver had the longest pass of the
afternoon, a 35 yarder to Rags
dale for a third quarter touch
down Ragsdale's third ot tne day.
Thurlow combined with Rags
dale for one of the most exciting
plays of the afternoon, early in
the final quarter. Following an
Interception by Chuck McCor
mick on the Stanford 32, Ken
Babajian ran to the 37 and Wea
ver pitched to Ragsdale for nine.
THURLOW WENT 24 yards
and when he found his way
blocked by San Jose tacklers,
lateraled to Ragsdale, who went
the rest of the way for the score.
It was the longest play of the
day. 55 yards.
Tf anything could dull the lus
ter of the Stanford attack against
tho Spartans, it would be the per
formance of the reserves. Only
once could the second team get a
drive going, midway in the third
quarter.
J. I). LODATO set the drive up
with a 31 yard punt return, and
he and sophomore Ray Handley
kept tho ball moving downfield.
The Tribe pushed down to the
San Jose eight yard line where a
penalty moved them back to the
13.
Handley almost got caught be
hind the line on the next play but
twisted 11 yards to the two be
fore being tackled. But tho San
Jose line stopped Handley on the
one on fourth down.
The Indians weakest point Sat
urday seemed to be their defense,
although SJS could only score
twice. Rand Carter, San Jose's j
veteran quarterback, had a fine j
day in a losing effort.
CARTER OPENED the season
with 17 completions to a number
of Spartan receivers. However,
he couldn't connect on any long
tosses, and the Indians were con
tent to let him have the short
sideline passes.
Carter was at his best at the
end of Ihe half when the Spar
tans took the ball on the Stan
ford 45 with less than two min
utes remaining. A series of short j
passes and a seven yard run by
fullback Charley Harraway
brought the ball down to the 12
yard line where Carter passed to
Bob Bonds for the score. Carter
scored the other San Jose touch
down, in the fourth quarter, on
a one yard run.
The best offensive fireworks I
were reserved for the Indians,

I and Ragsdale in p a r t i c u 1a r,
i and most of the at tack was on
the ground, in contrast to previ
ous years.
Weaver threw only two passes,
both for touchdowns, and the
| other Tribe quarterbacks of the
j afternoon, Mike Connelly, Dick
i Berg, and Don Cook, had only
I eight attempts, completing four.
The only major casuality of the
game was sopnomore fullback
Glenn Myers, who suffered a dis
located shoulder and will be out
for some time.

Each time the first unit got
the ball they scored, twice on
Weaver's passes to Ragsdale,
twice on Ragsdale's runs. The
174 pound halfback's four touch
downs are a Stanford scoring
record.
S!LIT HAGSDALE wasn't the
whole Stanford attack Saturday.
Steve Thurlow, another former
quarterback, gained 69 yards in
eight uies. Weaver, in addition
to tossing two TD passes, gained
28 yards from the quarterback
spot. The team, as a whole,
gained ?39 yards, 31.5 on the
ground.
In spite of San Jose's superior
speed, it was the Indians who
monopolized the long runs. Wea
ver had the longest pass of the
afternoon, a 35 yarder to Rags
dale for a third quarter touch
down Ragsdale's third ot tne day.
Thurlow combined with Rags
dale for one of the most exciting
plays of the afternoon, early in
the final quarter. Following an
Interception by Chuck McCor
mick on the Stanford 32, Ken
Babajian ran to the 37 and Wea
ver pitched to Ragsdale for nine.
THURLOW WENT 24 yards
and when he found his way
blocked by San Jose tacklers,
lateraled to Ragsdale, who went
the rest of the way for the score.
It was the longest play of the
day. 55 yards.
Tf anything could dull the lus
ter of the Stanford attack against
tho Spartans, it would be the per
formance of the reserves. Only
once could the second team get a
drive going, midway in the third
quarter.
J. I). LODATO set the drive up
with a 31 yard punt return, and
he and sophomore Ray Handley
kept tho ball moving downfield.
The Tribe pushed down to the
San Jose eight yard line where a
penalty moved them back to the
13.
Handley almost got caught be
hind the line on the next play but
twisted 11 yards to the two be
fore being tackled. But tho San
Jose line stopped Handley on the
one on fourth down.
The Indians weakest point Sat
urday seemed to be their defense,
although SJS could only score
twice. Rand Carter, San Jose's j
veteran quarterback, had a fine j
day in a losing effort.
CARTER OPENED the season
with 17 completions to a number
of Spartan receivers. However,
he couldn't connect on any long
tosses, and the Indians were con
tent to let him have the short
sideline passes.
Carter was at his best at the
end of Ihe half when the Spar
tans took the ball on the Stan
ford 45 with less than two min
utes remaining. A series of short j
passes and a seven yard run by
fullback Charley Harraway
brought the ball down to the 12
yard line where Carter passed to
Bob Bonds for the score. Carter
scored the other San Jose touch
down, in the fourth quarter, on
a one yard run.
The best offensive fireworks I
were reserved for the Indians,

I and Ragsdale in p a r t i c u 1a r,
i and most of the at tack was on
the ground, in contrast to previ
ous years.
Weaver threw only two passes,
both for touchdowns, and the
| other Tribe quarterbacks of the
j afternoon, Mike Connelly, Dick
i Berg, and Don Cook, had only
I eight attempts, completing four.
The only major casuality of the
game was sopnomore fullback
Glenn Myers, who suffered a dis
located shoulder and will be out
for some time.

Ragsdale, switched to halfback last spring by new football coach

dale for one of the most exciting
plays of the afternoon, early in
the final quarter. Following an
Interception by Chuck McCor
mick on the Stanford 32, Ken
Babajian ran to the 37 and Wea
ver pitched to Ragsdale for nine.
THURLOW WENT 24 yards
and when he found his way
blocked by San Jose tacklers,
lateraled to Ragsdale, who went
the rest of the way for the score.
It was the longest play of the
day. 55 yards.
Tf anything could dull the lus
ter of the Stanford attack against
tho Spartans, it would be the per
formance of the reserves. Only
once could the second team get a
drive going, midway in the third
quarter.
J. I). LODATO set the drive up
with a 31 yard punt return, and
he and sophomore Ray Handley
kept tho ball moving downfield.
The Tribe pushed down to the
San Jose eight yard line where a
penalty moved them back to the
13.
Handley almost got caught be
hind the line on the next play but
twisted 11 yards to the two be
fore being tackled. But tho San
Jose line stopped Handley on the
one on fourth down.
The Indians weakest point Sat
urday seemed to be their defense,
although SJS could only score
twice. Rand Carter, San Jose's j
veteran quarterback, had a fine j
day in a losing effort.
CARTER OPENED the season
with 17 completions to a number
of Spartan receivers. However,
he couldn't connect on any long
tosses, and the Indians were con
tent to let him have the short
sideline passes.
Carter was at his best at the
end of Ihe half when the Spar
tans took the ball on the Stan
ford 45 with less than two min
utes remaining. A series of short j
passes and a seven yard run by
fullback Charley Harraway
brought the ball down to the 12
yard line where Carter passed to
Bob Bonds for the score. Carter
scored the other San Jose touch
down, in the fourth quarter, on
a one yard run.
The best offensive fireworks I
were reserved for the Indians,

I and Ragsdale in p a r t i c u 1a r,
i and most of the at tack was on
the ground, in contrast to previ
ous years.
Weaver threw only two passes,
both for touchdowns, and the
| other Tribe quarterbacks of the
j afternoon, Mike Connelly, Dick
i Berg, and Don Cook, had only
I eight attempts, completing four.
The only major casuality of the
game was sopnomore fullback
Glenn Myers, who suffered a dis
located shoulder and will be out
for some time.

Dick Ragsdalc, last year's third string quarterback, became Stan
ford's biggest star Saturday as the revamped Indians swamped San
.lose State. 29-13, in the season's opener.
Ragsdale, switched to halfback last spring by new football coach
John Ralston, scored all four Stanford touchdowns, the longest a

51 yard run.
IF THE INDIANS, favored by
17 points, won by only 16, it was
because Ralston kept the first
string in for less lhan half the
game, and the reserve Green and
Blue squads were less adept at
penetrating the Spartan defenses.
But if the second and third
units couldn't score, the first
team had no difficulty. The first
time the Indian's got their hands
on the ball, they marched 72
yards for a touchdown, quarter
back Clark Weaver passing nine
yards to Ragsdale for the score.
Each time the first unit got
the ball they scored, twice on
Weaver's passes to Ragsdale,
twice on Ragsdale's runs. The
174 pound halfback's four touch
downs are a Stanford scoring
record.
S!LIT HAGSDALE wasn't the
whole Stanford attack Saturday.
Steve Thurlow, another former
quarterback, gained 69 yards in
eight uies. Weaver, in addition
to tossing two TD passes, gained
28 yards from the quarterback
spot. The team, as a whole,
gained ?39 yards, 31.5 on the
ground.
In spite of San Jose's superior
speed, it was the Indians who
monopolized the long runs. Wea
