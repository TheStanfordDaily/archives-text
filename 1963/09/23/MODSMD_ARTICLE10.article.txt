# NSA Wields Effective International Power
## 
### 
Perhaps sadly, the strongest influence of the United States
National Student Association is in the realm of international
student affairs. Every plenary session of the annual National
Student Congress begins with addresses of representatives of
National unions of students, sonic of whom describe fighting in
the streets against armed police to defend the student's right of
free inquiry. Every declaration of solidarity with national stu
dent unions passed by the NSA delegates has an effect that is
seldom equalled by declarations dealing with domestic mat
ters. The participant, be he Congress delegate or student of a
member school, develops a humble attitude when he becomes
aware of his effect upon some of the more brutal acts against
the student community and the result his awareness or ignor
ance can have upon them.
At the Congress this August, NSA voted to continue aid to
students from the Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozam
bique, from the Republic of South Africa and its mandate
Southwest Africa, and from Southern Rhodesia, fleeing their
homelands in an attempt to gain an education away from the
policies of colonial or racist governments.
Solidarity was expressed with the Vietnamese students who
have seen in the past few months the rector of the University
of Hue dismissed, 47 faculty members resign, alleged arrests
of protesting faculty members, and the closing of the University
of Saigon with 1,000 to 2,000 of its students arrested and placed
in concentration camps. NSA protested the violations of Uni
versity autonomy in Nicaragua, Paraguay, Haiti, Cuba, and
Iran.
T1 le National Student Association, and Stanford in its sup
port of the Association, should be commended for acting upon
these numerous issues of the international student community.
