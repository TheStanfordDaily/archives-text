# Letters to the Editor

### 
Editor, The Daily:
As a freshman, I eagerly was
looking forward to the first copy
of the Daily. Upon reading your
editorial, I was very perplexed
(and, in fact, shocked) to read the
opening lines of the sixth para
graph in which you stated: . .
we are a university without free
dom of religion on the campus.
Rather than entertain all religi
ous groups within the campus
structure, we bar all."
I would like to know why the
Stanford Bulletin on page 11
states that "Memorial Church has
no denominational ties whatever.
It is open to everyone . . . Ample
opportunity is given for religious
expression and growth." Why do
freshmen read in the Stanford
Handbook on page 53 under "Re
ligion at Stanford" that "As you
come to Stanford we invite you
to find in the varied religious ac
tivity of the University an oppor
tunity for worship, service, and
fellowship with your stu

dent friends. Religious ideas and
questions are freely studied and
discussed at Stanford." It seems
that these statements that fresh
men receive contrast to the first
sentence of yours which I quoted
above. Could you please enlighten
me as to your side of this matter
as opposed to the authors of offi
cial booklets?
Your second sentence also puz
zles me. "We bar all" religious
groups you say. Aren't the serv
ices held on Sunday of the Chris
tian religious group? Where, ON
CAMPUS, are the Moslem, Budd
hist, and Jewish services held?
Is the school policy to bar all but
allow one "established" church?
Is the Memorial Church truly
non-denominational as compared
to a really non-sectarian house of
worship as that in the U.N. build
ing?
Perhaps some more knowledge
able upperclassmen could answer
some of this freshman's questions
on these matters.

CAMPUS, are the Moslem, Budd
hist, and Jewish services held?
Is the school policy to bar all but
allow one "established" church?
Is the Memorial Church truly
non-denominational as compared
to a really non-sectarian house of
worship as that in the U.N. build
ing?
Perhaps some more knowledge
able upperclassmen could answer
some of this freshman's questions
on these matters.
