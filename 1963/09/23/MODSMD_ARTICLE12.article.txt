# USNSA President Decries Communist, Rightist Criticism

(Excerpts from the opening
Congress address of W. Dennis
Shaul, President of the United
States National Student Associa
tion a! the University of Indiana,
August 18, 1963.)
The program for the year has
been more than satisfactory. It
stands in marked contrast to the
groups who criticize us. In the
same month in which demonstra
tions and police brutality errupted
in Birmingham, and the nation
tried to face a more honest fu
ture and live down a hypocritical
past, the New Guard ran an arti
cle which stated that civil rights
and segregation were nothing to
worry about; other countries had
their difficulties too.
I submit to you that this is the
attitude that permeates the ex
treme right in the youth commu
nity of this country. The attitude
is one of "do nothing." The only
positive goal that the students on
the extreme right have is the
destruction of this Association.
AT THE SAME time, the far
loft this year made a more dra
matic and less disguised attempt
to destroy the Association. There
is no question in my mind that
in October when many of you re
ceived a publication called Com
munist Viewpoint, a publication
addressed to the NSA coordina
tor, that this was indeed an at
tempt to link us inextricably with
the Communist Party. This was
done because the Communist
Party has a vested interest in see
ing us destroyed. For we not only
are a threat to them internation
ally, but we also effectively mo
bilize students toward the con
struction of a better society, a
democratic society. This makes
us the natural and eternal enemy
of the Communist Party.
We have no doubt that the
people on the far left and on the
far right have every right in the
world to be present here; they
have every right to present their
case. But, let there also be no
doubt by anyone here nor bv any
one representing these groups,
that this Association has its own
integrity and will not give it up
without a fight.
THE LESSONS to be drawn

from these criticisms are fairly
obvious. The first is that so long
as we continue to do things we
are going to be criticized. The
second is that so long as there
are people in the country on the
right or left who are so close
minded as to mistake a concern
for civil liberties with a lack of
concern for national security or
to mistake a concern about com
munism with a lack of concern
about peace, our own objectivity
and commitment to full discus
sion will be a source of extreme
annoyance.
THIS ASSOCIATION is an at
tempt to give us a voice in mat
ters which concern this genera
tion; it provides a forum for stu
dents of differing political views,
a forum even for the apolitical.
It is important to recognize that
everyone here regardles of his
committment to a political
ideology is free to speak out and
is free to be a part of the decision
making process. This in itself,
does much to justify cur exist
ence, for political participation is
the keystone of our society.
But there is a further, deeper
reason why we exist: there must
be within democracy a constant
concern about individualism. This
concern will never be manifested
or articulated by those who make
individualism a disguise for sel
fishness, who use it to promote
private interests or by those who
attempt to make the word a
rallying cry of those who wish to
stand fast against progress.
For me it was dramatized two
summers agoâ€”while I was in
Europe and had opportunity to go
to a battlefield where thousands
of American soldiers were buried.
When I stood on the hill on that
very fresh summer morning, a
day filled with the promise of life,
and looked over these thousands
of graves, I felt no sympathy for
the people who had died, no con
cern about what it was that put
them in their grave. Rather I
was appalled by the stark recog
nition that when thousands of
crosses are etched against the
green, when so many have died,
it becomes difficult to given even
death a meaning.
