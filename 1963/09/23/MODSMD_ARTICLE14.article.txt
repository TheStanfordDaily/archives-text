# Student Suppression Inflames Vietnamese Political Crisis
## 
### 
llYA—This month and last
South Vietnamese universities
and schools became the focal
point of anti-Government opposi
tion when the country's tradition
ally politically passive professors
and students joined ranks with
embattled Buddhist monks in the
deepening crisis that has shocked
and saddened Southeast Asia and
the entire world.
The essence of the dispute
stems from the charge of South
Vietnamese Buddhists, who con
stitute about 70 per cent of the
population, that the Government
headed by the Roman Catholic
Ngo family discriminates against
them. The mandarin Ngo Gov
e r n m en t, which whenever
prodded out of its aloofness has
resorted to repression, character
istically denied the allegations,
then answered them with gratui
tous violence.
LAST MONTH, in the second
largest city of South Vietnam,
Hue—where the crisis originally
erupted on May 8 when the Gov
ernment troops fired into a peace
ful Buddhist demonstration—the
rector of the university was dis
charged. No reason was given for
the removal of the head of the
Government-run University of
Hue, the Rev. Cao Van Luan, a
Roman Catholic priest, but it was
widely believed that the action
had been taken because Hue uni
versity students participated in
the Buddhist, protests against the
Ngo regime.
Protesting Father Cao Van
Luan's dismissal, 47 University of
Hue faculty members resigned
on August 17. The resignation,
which included the deans of every
faculty, were submitted in an
open let ter. The first five signers
were Buddhists. Several Roman
Catholic professors reportedly
had asked to be among the first
but they were induced to wait to
show Buddhist support for the
Catholic rector. The Minister of
Education, Nguyen Quang Trihn,
immediately asked reconsidera
tion of the resignations. The pro
fessors involved apparently an
swered that they would remain
only if the Ngo Government took
quick action to settle all aspects
of the Buddhist question. Hu6s
university was built in 1957 and
is considered the most progres
sive of the country's institutions
of higher education. The faculty,
it is said, is younger and more
pragmatic than elsewhere, and
more interested in the pressing

problems facing South Vietnam.
Hue has almost 3,000 students.
On August 22 the scene shifted
to the capital when Dr. Pham
Bieu Tam, dean of the faculty of
medicine at Saigon University,
one of the most widely respected
of the university professors in
South Vietnam, was arrested —
he had refused to sign a Ngo re
gime loyalty oath. Other profes
sors in Saigon were also said to
have been arrested for the same
reason.
TWO DAYS LATER—on Sat
urday, August 24—amid growing
student unrest, the military gov
ernor announced that Saigon Uni
versity would be closed until fur
ther notice. But before the order
came, 1,000 students held a rally
for Minister Vu at the Saigon
University Law School. After
students leaders delivered bitter
anti-Government speeches, Mr.
Vu urged students to "struggle
for your rights with unity and
determination." Other student
demonstrations followed that day
and into the morning hours of the
next.
On the morning of Sunday,
August 25, there were reports
that another major demonstra
tion would take place at the Law
School. But the students never
had a chance to gather.
According to some estimates
around 3,000 Vietnamese students
were arrested that Sunday and
carted off in army trucks. Most
were placed in a military training
center just outside Saigon where,
according to informed sources,
those eligible for military service
and considered "militant" would
be drafted while others who were
receptive to the "explanation of
the Government viewpoint"
would be released. The same
night an unidentified student
leader smuggled identical notes
to the new U.S. Ambassador
Ifenry Cabot I odge and key
South Vietnamese army generals
saying "we new hand the fight
against (President Ngo Dihn)
Diem over to you."
On Monday, September 9, more
han 100 secret policemen sup
ported by armed troops arrested
about 1,000 students at a boys'
secondary school. Students at the
chool reportedly hurled desks at
the police who responded by beat
ing some of the students and
throwing others head first into
trucks. The New York Times
(September 10, 1963) claims that
28 truck-loads were carried off.

tion when the country's tradition
ally politically passive professors
and students joined ranks with
embattled Buddhist monks in the
deepening crisis that has shocked
and saddened Southeast Asia and
the entire world.
The essence of the dispute
stems from the charge of South
Vietnamese Buddhists, who con
stitute about 70 per cent of the
population, that the Government
headed by the Roman Catholic
Ngo family discriminates against
them. The mandarin Ngo Gov
e r n m en t, which whenever
prodded out of its aloofness has
resorted to repression, character
istically denied the allegations,
then answered them with gratui
tous violence.
LAST MONTH, in the second
largest city of South Vietnam,
Hue—where the crisis originally
erupted on May 8 when the Gov
ernment troops fired into a peace
ful Buddhist demonstration—the
rector of the university was dis
charged. No reason was given for
the removal of the head of the
Government-run University of
Hue, the Rev. Cao Van Luan, a
Roman Catholic priest, but it was
widely believed that the action
had been taken because Hue uni
versity students participated in
the Buddhist, protests against the
Ngo regime.
Protesting Father Cao Van
Luan's dismissal, 47 University of
Hue faculty members resigned
on August 17. The resignation,
which included the deans of every
faculty, were submitted in an
open let ter. The first five signers
were Buddhists. Several Roman
Catholic professors reportedly
had asked to be among the first
but they were induced to wait to
show Buddhist support for the
Catholic rector. The Minister of
Education, Nguyen Quang Trihn,
immediately asked reconsidera
tion of the resignations. The pro
fessors involved apparently an
swered that they would remain
only if the Ngo Government took
quick action to settle all aspects
of the Buddhist question. Hu6s
university was built in 1957 and
is considered the most progres
sive of the country's institutions
of higher education. The faculty,
it is said, is younger and more
pragmatic than elsewhere, and
more interested in the pressing

problems facing South Vietnam.
Hue has almost 3,000 students.
On August 22 the scene shifted
to the capital when Dr. Pham
Bieu Tam, dean of the faculty of
medicine at Saigon University,
one of the most widely respected
of the university professors in
South Vietnam, was arrested —
he had refused to sign a Ngo re
gime loyalty oath. Other profes
sors in Saigon were also said to
have been arrested for the same
reason.
TWO DAYS LATER—on Sat
urday, August 24—amid growing
student unrest, the military gov
ernor announced that Saigon Uni
versity would be closed until fur
ther notice. But before the order
came, 1,000 students held a rally
for Minister Vu at the Saigon
University Law School. After
students leaders delivered bitter
anti-Government speeches, Mr.
Vu urged students to "struggle
for your rights with unity and
determination." Other student
demonstrations followed that day
and into the morning hours of the
next.
On the morning of Sunday,
August 25, there were reports
that another major demonstra
tion would take place at the Law
School. But the students never
had a chance to gather.
According to some estimates
around 3,000 Vietnamese students
were arrested that Sunday and
carted off in army trucks. Most
were placed in a military training
center just outside Saigon where,
according to informed sources,
those eligible for military service
and considered "militant" would
be drafted while others who were
receptive to the "explanation of
the Government viewpoint"
would be released. The same
night an unidentified student
leader smuggled identical notes
to the new U.S. Ambassador
Ifenry Cabot I odge and key
South Vietnamese army generals
saying "we new hand the fight
against (President Ngo Dihn)
Diem over to you."
On Monday, September 9, more
han 100 secret policemen sup
ported by armed troops arrested
about 1,000 students at a boys'
secondary school. Students at the
chool reportedly hurled desks at
the police who responded by beat
ing some of the students and
throwing others head first into
trucks. The New York Times
(September 10, 1963) claims that
28 truck-loads were carried off.

and saddened Southeast Asia and
the entire world.
The essence of the dispute
stems from the charge of South
Vietnamese Buddhists, who con
stitute about 70 per cent of the
population, that the Government
headed by the Roman Catholic
Ngo family discriminates against
them. The mandarin Ngo Gov
e r n m en t, which whenever
prodded out of its aloofness has
resorted to repression, character
istically denied the allegations,
then answered them with gratui
tous violence.
LAST MONTH, in the second
largest city of South Vietnam,
Hue—where the crisis originally
erupted on May 8 when the Gov
ernment troops fired into a peace
ful Buddhist demonstration—the
rector of the university was dis
charged. No reason was given for
the removal of the head of the
Government-run University of
Hue, the Rev. Cao Van Luan, a
Roman Catholic priest, but it was
widely believed that the action
had been taken because Hue uni
versity students participated in
the Buddhist, protests against the
Ngo regime.
Protesting Father Cao Van
Luan's dismissal, 47 University of
Hue faculty members resigned
on August 17. The resignation,
which included the deans of every
faculty, were submitted in an
open let ter. The first five signers
were Buddhists. Several Roman
Catholic professors reportedly
had asked to be among the first
but they were induced to wait to
show Buddhist support for the
Catholic rector. The Minister of
Education, Nguyen Quang Trihn,
immediately asked reconsidera
tion of the resignations. The pro
fessors involved apparently an
swered that they would remain
only if the Ngo Government took
quick action to settle all aspects
of the Buddhist question. Hu6s
university was built in 1957 and
is considered the most progres
sive of the country's institutions
of higher education. The faculty,
it is said, is younger and more
pragmatic than elsewhere, and
more interested in the pressing

problems facing South Vietnam.
Hue has almost 3,000 students.
On August 22 the scene shifted
to the capital when Dr. Pham
Bieu Tam, dean of the faculty of
medicine at Saigon University,
one of the most widely respected
of the university professors in
South Vietnam, was arrested —
he had refused to sign a Ngo re
gime loyalty oath. Other profes
sors in Saigon were also said to
have been arrested for the same
reason.
TWO DAYS LATER—on Sat
urday, August 24—amid growing
student unrest, the military gov
ernor announced that Saigon Uni
versity would be closed until fur
ther notice. But before the order
came, 1,000 students held a rally
for Minister Vu at the Saigon
University Law School. After
students leaders delivered bitter
anti-Government speeches, Mr.
Vu urged students to "struggle
for your rights with unity and
determination." Other student
demonstrations followed that day
and into the morning hours of the
next.
On the morning of Sunday,
August 25, there were reports
that another major demonstra
tion would take place at the Law
School. But the students never
had a chance to gather.
According to some estimates
around 3,000 Vietnamese students
were arrested that Sunday and
carted off in army trucks. Most
were placed in a military training
center just outside Saigon where,
according to informed sources,
those eligible for military service
and considered "militant" would
be drafted while others who were
receptive to the "explanation of
the Government viewpoint"
would be released. The same
night an unidentified student
leader smuggled identical notes
to the new U.S. Ambassador
Ifenry Cabot I odge and key
South Vietnamese army generals
saying "we new hand the fight
against (President Ngo Dihn)
Diem over to you."
On Monday, September 9, more
han 100 secret policemen sup
ported by armed troops arrested
about 1,000 students at a boys'
secondary school. Students at the
chool reportedly hurled desks at
the police who responded by beat
ing some of the students and
throwing others head first into
trucks. The New York Times
(September 10, 1963) claims that
28 truck-loads were carried off.
