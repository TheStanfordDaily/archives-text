# Jordan Predicts Veteran Harriers Will Be Stronger
## 
### TOM ELIAS 
Stanford's head cross-country
and track coach, Payton Jordan,
expects his harriers to be consid
ably improved over the team
which last season came closer
than anyone else to beating na
tional champion San Jose State.
Jordan expects senior Harry
McCalla, who placed seventh in
the nationals last year at East
Lansing, Mich, with a sparkling
19:55.4, once again to pace the
Cards.
McCALLA SHOULD be closely
followed by junior Weymouth
Kirkland, defending West Coast
titlist and record holder. Kirk
land raced to a 20:06.0 mark in
winning that crown.
Behind the stellar duo is Dave
Duebner, holder of the Stanford
three-mile record at 13:57.7, set
on a slow track at the University
of California last season. Ducb
ner's best clocking over the 4.2
mile cross-country course has
been 20:32.0.
Rounding out the top five will
be closely matched Paul Schlicke,
whose best time has been 20:13.2.
and Bill Pratt, whose previous
best is 20:16.0.
THE TRIBE will participate in
at least three major meets dur
ing the month of November, be
ginning with the Northern Cali
fornia Invitational on Nov. 15,
and rapidly moving on to the
West Coast and NCAA champion
ships.
In dual meet competition, Jor
! dan looks for his stiffest com
| petition to come from Dean Mil
ler's defending national champion
San Jose State Spartans and the
Trojans of USC.
The coach feels that Southern
Cal, with Julio Marin returning,
and with the addition of some out
standing junior college transfers,
could well be "the surprise of
the AAWU."
Following the Trojans, Jordan
feels that UCLA, Stanford and
Cal will be class of the Big Six.
The harriers open their new
season on October 13, travelling
to the state capital to participate
in the Sacramento State Invita
tional.
