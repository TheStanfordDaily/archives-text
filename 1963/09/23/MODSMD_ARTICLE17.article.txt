# Ralston Not Happy Despite Opening Victory
## 
### 
New head coach John Ralston
was in a strangely reflective
mood Saturday afternoon, despite
an overwhelming victory over a
moderately tough foe in his first
Stanford game.
Analyzing the 29-13 win over
San Jose State in the locker room,
Ralston's first words were, "We
were disappointed in a lot of re
spects with the game, particu
larly the defense." However, he
was quick to point out that the
offense performed well.
"WE'RK GOING to study those
game films a lot," said Ralston. |
"This game was a testing ground
for a lot of players, and we want
to see what they look like." Ral
ston played 45 men, including 16
backs. "Our main problem now
is in building depth," he said.
He mentioned San Jose's pro
tection for the passer, their draw
play, and their ability to spring
backs and ends loose for passes
as the sore spots plagued th e
Stanford defense.
Looking forward lo next week,

Ralston commented, "San Jose
runs a similar offense to Oregon.
This game was good prepara
tion."
ASKED WHY he didn't pass
more, quarterback Clark Weaver
replied. "We didn't need to. They
couldn't stop our Rods (first
unit)."

Tackle A 1 Hildcbrand added,
"Most of our pass rush comes
from our tackles, and they were
double-teaming the tackles."
The dressing room was quiet,
with nobody yelling happily. It
was as though everyone expected
to win, in contrast to recent sea
sons.
