A gallant Coach Bob Titchenal
stood before the locker room of
his defeated San Jose State
eleven, refusing to take any
credit away from the Stanford
squad which had just dropped
his Spartans, 29-13.
"It was their depth and experi
ence in the line that particularly
hurt us. Stanford was also much
faster than we expected them to
be. Their pass defense was good
enough to contain our long game,
which was what it had to do.
"This was the best Stanford
team I've seen since coming to
San Jose, so I don't feel like we
were humiliated."
Carter, interviewed separately
from his coach, agreed that the
1963 Indians are a much tougher
and better balanced unit than in
1962.
Titchenal singled out Stanford
quarterback Clark Weaver and
halfback Dick Ragsdale as the
top Card ball carriers, and Chuck
Hartwig as the outstanding line
man.
