# PACE Reaches $90 Million Mark
## 
### 
More than $90 million has been
raised toward tho $100 million
goal of Stanford's PACE pro
gram to date. According to T. S.
Petersen, national co-cnairman of
tho program, an all-out effort is
now under way to finish intensive
campaigning by December 31,
lour months ahead of schedule.
TIII2 ALUMNI volunteer corps,
ncaring peak strength of 6,000
workers, is striving to complete
personal calls on 75,000 Stanford
alumni and parents in all parts of
the country and overseas. Peter
sen warned that in so huge a task
"the last lap is never easy."
Launched as a three-year ef
fort: in April, 1961, the PACE pro
gram-Plan of Action for a Chal
lenging Era—received its incen
tive in a grant of $25 million
from the Ford Foundation. The
Ford grant, believed to be the
largest unrestricted grant ever
offered to a university, was ex
tended on the condition that Stan
lord match the award on or be
fore August 31, 1965, with $75
million raised from other private
sources.
President Wallace Sterling

I called the PACE program the
I University's "boldest venture" at
1 that time. The amount sought
j was unprecedented in West Coast
academic history, and many ex
pressed doubts about the out
come.
"THEY ARE d übious no
longer," Sterling said recently.
He said the new funds "are being
committed to a University's prop
er business, which is the service
of mankind."
As stated in the PACE hand
book for committe members, gen-
I era! goals to be accomplished by
the program's funds are as fol
lows:
• To strengthen undergraduate
education while holding enroll
ment nearly constant;
• To expand graduate educa
tion selectively to meet the grow
ing need for highly trained lead
ers in research, business, and the
professions;
• To provide needed buildings
and facilities to meet the ex
panded needs of students and
faculty.
FUNDS FOR the program are
raised by volunteers in the big
gest cooperative alumni effort
Stanford has ever seen. Accord
ing to PACE co-chairman Thomas
B. Pike, "this fact alone is of in
calculable value to the University
and its future. And the excellent
campaign progress indicated new
understanding among alumni and
the public of the financial dilem
ma faced by independent colleges
and universities not directly sup
ported by state and federal
taxes."
Effects of the new resources
are readily evident. Building and
renovation are under way all over
the campus . Expenditures 112 or
instruction have increased nearly
seventy per cent in three years,
and the professorial ranks of the
faculty have been enlarged in
three years from 615 to 788.
SALARIES ARE now competi
tive with those at other univer
sities in the "top ten" lists. Of
fifteen endowed chairs sought,
eight have been contributed, in
cluding one visiting professor
ship.
Scholarships and student a i d
totaled about $3 million in 1960;
last year, after tuition increases,
the total thus expended was $5.9
million.
BUT IN THE building program,
receipts from designated gifts
are lagging considerably behind

tho goal. The 1960 priority pro
gram comprised twenty-seven ma
jor construction and renovation
projects, many of them part of a
backlog of needs accumulated
during the war and postwar
years.
Two principal projects for
which financing is still sought are
the Undergraduate Library and
tho new quarters for the Gradu
ate School of Business, each at an
estimated cost of more than $5
million. The Business School now
has about half of its financing
assured.

book for committe members, gen-
I era! goals to be accomplished by
the program's funds are as fol
lows:
• To strengthen undergraduate
education while holding enroll
ment nearly constant;
• To expand graduate educa
tion selectively to meet the grow
ing need for highly trained lead
ers in research, business, and the
professions;
• To provide needed buildings
and facilities to meet the ex
panded needs of students and
faculty.
FUNDS FOR the program are
raised by volunteers in the big
gest cooperative alumni effort
Stanford has ever seen. Accord
ing to PACE co-chairman Thomas
B. Pike, "this fact alone is of in
calculable value to the University
and its future. And the excellent
campaign progress indicated new
understanding among alumni and
the public of the financial dilem
ma faced by independent colleges
and universities not directly sup
ported by state and federal
taxes."
Effects of the new resources
are readily evident. Building and
renovation are under way all over
the campus . Expenditures 112 or
instruction have increased nearly
seventy per cent in three years,
and the professorial ranks of the
faculty have been enlarged in
three years from 615 to 788.
SALARIES ARE now competi
tive with those at other univer
sities in the "top ten" lists. Of
fifteen endowed chairs sought,
eight have been contributed, in
cluding one visiting professor
ship.
Scholarships and student a i d
totaled about $3 million in 1960;
last year, after tuition increases,
the total thus expended was $5.9
million.
BUT IN THE building program,
receipts from designated gifts
are lagging considerably behind

tho goal. The 1960 priority pro
gram comprised twenty-seven ma
jor construction and renovation
projects, many of them part of a
backlog of needs accumulated
during the war and postwar
years.
Two principal projects for
which financing is still sought are
the Undergraduate Library and
tho new quarters for the Gradu
ate School of Business, each at an
estimated cost of more than $5
million. The Business School now
has about half of its financing
assured.

More than $90 million has been
raised toward tho $100 million
goal of Stanford's PACE pro
gram to date. According to T. S.
Petersen, national co-cnairman of
tho program, an all-out effort is
now under way to finish intensive
campaigning by December 31,
lour months ahead of schedule.
TIII2 ALUMNI volunteer corps,
ncaring peak strength of 6,000
workers, is striving to complete
personal calls on 75,000 Stanford
alumni and parents in all parts of
the country and overseas. Peter

"the last lap is never easy."
Launched as a three-year ef
fort: in April, 1961, the PACE pro
gram-Plan of Action for a Chal

from the Ford Foundation. The
Ford grant, believed to be the
largest unrestricted grant ever
offered to a university, was ex
tended on the condition that Stan
lord match the award on or be
fore August 31, 1965, with $75
million raised from other private
sources.

I called the PACE program the
I University's "boldest venture" at
1 that time. The amount sought
j was unprecedented in West Coast
academic history, and many ex
pressed doubts about the out
come.
"THEY ARE d übious no
longer," Sterling said recently.
He said the new funds "are being
committed to a University's prop
er business, which is the service
of mankind."
As stated in the PACE hand
book for committe members, gen-
I era! goals to be accomplished by
the program's funds are as fol
lows:
• To strengthen undergraduate
education while holding enroll
ment nearly constant;
• To expand graduate educa
tion selectively to meet the grow
ing need for highly trained lead
ers in research, business, and the
professions;
• To provide needed buildings
and facilities to meet the ex
panded needs of students and
faculty.
FUNDS FOR the program are
raised by volunteers in the big
gest cooperative alumni effort
Stanford has ever seen. Accord
ing to PACE co-chairman Thomas
B. Pike, "this fact alone is of in
calculable value to the University
and its future. And the excellent
campaign progress indicated new
understanding among alumni and
the public of the financial dilem
ma faced by independent colleges
and universities not directly sup
ported by state and federal
taxes."
Effects of the new resources
are readily evident. Building and
renovation are under way all over
the campus . Expenditures 112 or
instruction have increased nearly
seventy per cent in three years,
and the professorial ranks of the
faculty have been enlarged in
three years from 615 to 788.
SALARIES ARE now competi
tive with those at other univer
sities in the "top ten" lists. Of
fifteen endowed chairs sought,
eight have been contributed, in
cluding one visiting professor
ship.
Scholarships and student a i d
totaled about $3 million in 1960;
last year, after tuition increases,
the total thus expended was $5.9
million.
BUT IN THE building program,
receipts from designated gifts
are lagging considerably behind

tho goal. The 1960 priority pro
gram comprised twenty-seven ma
jor construction and renovation
projects, many of them part of a
backlog of needs accumulated
during the war and postwar
years.

which financing is still sought are
the Undergraduate Library and
tho new quarters for the Gradu
ate School of Business, each at an
