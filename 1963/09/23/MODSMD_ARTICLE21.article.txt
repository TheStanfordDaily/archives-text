# PACE Allocates $3 Million to Student Programs, Activities
## 
### 
Special student programs are
not neglected by the PACE pro
gram, which seeks $3 million—
$2 million in endowment and $1
million in direct expenditure —
for organizations, such as the In
stitute for International Rela
tions; programs such as that con
cerned with Faculty Associates
and those planned by the Tresid
der cultural arts division; intra
mural athletics; debate teams;
and other student activities.
An example of this type of fi
nancing is provided by a memo
rial gift of over $1 million, re
ceived from Mr. and Mrs. Lowell
Berry of Stockton and Oakland
last June for the purpose of
strengthening student religious
programs at Memorial Church.
THIS GIFT will establish the
the Jayne Berry Fund in memory
of the Berry's daughter. Mr.
Berry expresed the hope that the
continuing yield from the fund
"will further assist Stanford stu
dents to reach a deeper under
standing and appreciation of re

ligion as a motivating force in
their daily lives and as an under
girding strength of our nation."
Expressing his "p rofoun d
thanks" to the donors, President
Wallace Sterling said that both
he and the University share with
Mr. Berry "the ideal of providing
students the opportunity to en
hance the meaning of religion in
their lives and of adding this em
phasis to education at Stanford."
Sterling added, "Work on a pro
gram to implement this hand
some gift will begin immedi
ately."
ANOTHER student activity
aided by the PACE program is
the international student pro
gram, which, according to Dr.
Werner Warmbrunn, foreign stu
dent adviser, "will be given great
impetus" by the new interna
tional student center. Renova
tion of the old Zeta Psi house was
completed last summer. The pro
ject became an assured success
when a substantial gift was made
last spring by Mr. and Mrs. S. D.
Bechtel, Sr., and the Bechtel
Foundation.
