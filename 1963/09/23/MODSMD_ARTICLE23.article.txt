## 
### 
Financing for the PACE program's projected $5 million build
ing complcx for the Graduate School of Business received a boost
last summer with a gift from the family of the late William P. Roth,
San Francisco and Honolulu shipping executive. The funds will
finance the William P. Rolh Center for Advanced Management Edu

cation in the complcx.
Mrs. William P. Roth and her
son and daughters joined in the
memorial gift for Roth. Chair
man of the board of Matson Navi
gation Company, he died last
February at the age of 81. "The
University is profoundly grate
ful for this generous gift and
proud to have the Roth name
thus associated with Stanford,"
said President Wallace Sterling.
THE ROTH ADVANCE Man
agement Center will house such
activities as the Executive De
velopment Program for corporate
executives, Ihe Stanford-Sloan
Program of joint study by busi
ness executives and Ph.D. candi
dates, the International Center
1 for Advancement of Management
Education (ICAME) for ousiness
teachers from newly developing
nations, and special summer pro
grams for management leaders
in many fields.
Final plans for the new Busi
i ness School are expected to be
! complete by March; construction
I will require about two years. The
I site selected is near the north
west corner of the Quad, adja
i cent to Memorial Hall and almost
j opposite Hoover Tower.
KE( ONSTRUCTION WORK
on Math Corner, another PACE
project, is expected to be com

storv structure. This PACE pro
ject was financed by a $1 mil

February. Math Corner will be-
I come a modern headquarters for
j the fast-developing Math Depart
ment, which now operates in five
scattered locations. Dean Albert
H. Bowker of the Graduate Divi
sion said it will promote research
! by an expanding faculty of first
rank mathematicians exploring
unconventional areas of the sub
