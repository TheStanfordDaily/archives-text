# PACE Gift Allows Publications Move
## 
### 
After decades in the decrepit
Shack and temporary buildings,
the Daily and Stanford's three
other student publications will
next fall move into a new publi
cations building.
The new building, to fill the
area occupied by the Shack and
nearby open land, is a PACP] gift
of Santa Barbara, editor-publisher
Thomas M. Storke, an 1898 Stan
ford graduate.
Common facilities in the new
building will include photographic
areas, a conference room, and
reception and business areas.
Each of the four publications —
the Daily, the Quad, Sequoia, and
Chaparral—will have individual
quarters as well.
