## Local Group Pickets Memorial Church 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
Carrying signs which read,
i "Thou Shalt Not Kill," and "A
'Yes' to Christianity Demands a
'No' to Organization for War,"
i five representatives of Student
Action for Peace, a Palo Alto
group, picketed Stanford's Me
morial Church during services
yesterday morning.
The group, headed by Ira Sand
perl, Bay Area pacifist, and Holly
Chenery, the daughter of a Stan-
I ford professor and a member of
| the freshman class this year, con
rluctcd Ihe protest as the last in
| a series of "vigils" at local
j churches.
THK PICKETING was con
ducted in an orderly fashion and
completed without incident. Earl
ier the University had permitted
picketing outside the church, pro
viding it did not interfere with
normal entry and exit of those
! attending worship services. No
j individuals were allowed to enter
the church with placards or to
distribute literature within its
walls.
In a statement as to the pur
poses of the vigils, Sandperl said,
"The Judeo-Christian view of the
universe, with its message of the

Fatherhood of God and the
Brotherhood of man, is dying be
cause it is not being lived." Sand
perl continued, "If religion is not
to be empty and sentimental, it
must pertain to every aspect of
life, and life in the twentieth
century is as much political as
it is private."
Sandperl exhorted church mem
bers to act: "By one's actions or
inactions, one determines not only
one's private life but the very
society in which one lives. For
each of us is the society. In short,
charity that begins at home must
not etui there. Nonviolence, the
dynamic, principled, political ac
tion of love, must be taught, un
derstood, and practiced."
Stressing the Judeo-Christian
committment to nonviolence,
Sandperl commented, "The un
equivocal, unqualified sixth Com

mandment, Thou shalt not kill,'
can never be reconciled with mili
tary training, which is an avowed,
thorough-going instruction in the
ways of killing. To 'Love your
enemies,' one cannot participate
in the manufacturing of geno
cidal weapons nor finance them
with tax money."
SANDPERL C O N TINU E D.
"Specifically, the imperatives of
a moral and religious life, a life
committed to non-violence, de
mand the courage to say 'no' to
military training, 'no' to so-called
defense work, and 'no' to the
some sixty percent of our income
taxes which finances the complex
machinery of mass murder. At
j the same time, one must say
! 'ves' in the most practical and
political terms to the great Judeo-
Christian values of the sanctity
i of life and the dignity of man."
i Sandperl concluded. "Today,
political attitudes and policies
1 are the clearest indication of the
' faith or lack of faith in the values
; which Western man professes;
! therefore, lest his faith be
mocked, its insights and wisdom
| and practicality must be demon
strated in international policies
as well as in his family relations.
He must once and for all free his
religious life from the tribal die-
I tales of the nation-state."

"Specifically, the imperatives of
a moral and religious life, a life
committed to non-violence, de
mand the courage to say 'no' to
military training, 'no' to so-called
defense work, and 'no' to the
some sixty percent of our income
taxes which finances the complex
machinery of mass murder. At
j the same time, one must say
! 'ves' in the most practical and
political terms to the great Judeo-
Christian values of the sanctity
i of life and the dignity of man."
i Sandperl concluded. "Today,
political attitudes and policies
1 are the clearest indication of the
' faith or lack of faith in the values
; which Western man professes;
! therefore, lest his faith be
mocked, its insights and wisdom
| and practicality must be demon
strated in international policies
as well as in his family relations.

Carrying signs which read,
i "Thou Shalt Not Kill," and "A
'Yes' to Christianity Demands a
'No' to Organization for War,"
i five representatives of Student
Action for Peace, a Palo Alto
group, picketed Stanford's Me
morial Church during services
yesterday morning.
The group, headed by Ira Sand
perl, Bay Area pacifist, and Holly
Chenery, the daughter of a Stan-
I ford professor and a member of
| the freshman class this year, con
rluctcd Ihe protest as the last in
| a series of "vigils" at local
j churches.
THK PICKETING was con
ducted in an orderly fashion and
completed without incident. Earl
ier the University had permitted
picketing outside the church, pro
viding it did not interfere with
normal entry and exit of those
! attending worship services. No
j individuals were allowed to enter
the church with placards or to
distribute literature within its
walls.
In a statement as to the pur
poses of the vigils, Sandperl said,
"The Judeo-Christian view of the
universe, with its message of the

Fatherhood of God and the
Brotherhood of man, is dying be
cause it is not being lived." Sand
perl continued, "If religion is not
to be empty and sentimental, it
must pertain to every aspect of
life, and life in the twentieth
century is as much political as
it is private."
Sandperl exhorted church mem
bers to act: "By one's actions or
inactions, one determines not only
one's private life but the very
society in which one lives. For
each of us is the society. In short,
charity that begins at home must
not etui there. Nonviolence, the
dynamic, principled, political ac
tion of love, must be taught, un
derstood, and practiced."
Stressing the Judeo-Christian
committment to nonviolence,
Sandperl commented, "The un
equivocal, unqualified sixth Com

mandment, Thou shalt not kill,'
can never be reconciled with mili
tary training, which is an avowed,
thorough-going instruction in the
ways of killing. To 'Love your
enemies,' one cannot participate
in the manufacturing of geno
cidal weapons nor finance them
