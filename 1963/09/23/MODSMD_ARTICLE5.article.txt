# Prince Enrolls Here; Establishes Precedents

Prince William of Gloucester,
sixth in succession to the British
throne, enrolls at Stanford today.
By taking an economics course
at Stanford, the prince establishes
two precedents the first British

royal prince to attend a coedu
cational school, the first to study
at an American institution..
Prince William Henry Andrew
Frederick arrived at the San
Francisco airport at 11:30 a.m.

yesterday. He checked int; o
Crothers Hall, a graduate men's
dormitory.
After registering there, he had
lunch with University admissions
officials. He then toured the cam
pus briefly and attended the
convocation at Memorial Audito
rium.
He also attended a private re
ception for graduate students at
ihe home of President Sterling.
He will discuss his academic pro
gram with his faculty adviser
this morning, then enroll with
other students at the Pavilion.
AS THE MOST democratic and
politely rebellious member of the
royal family, Prince William in
formed his family, "1 don't want
to be hemmed in by red tape . . .
I want to make my own way in
life."
His father, the Duke of Glou
cester, uncle of Queen Elizabeth,
had his son's future all planned
-—Sandhurst Military College, the
army and eventually the life of
a country squire at their seat,
Branwell Manor in Northampton
shire.
But his mother, Ihe former
Lady Alice Scott, daughter of the
Duke of Buccleuch, supported her
son's bid for independence. And
Prince William was allowed to
take an engineering degree at
Cambridge.
While at Cambridge, the prince
discouraged all reference to his
rank. Soon he was just another
student, "Bill," buying cheap
lunches in pubs, cycling to lec
tures, travelling second class to
ski resorts with classmates in the
winter vacation.
THIS SUMMER, "Bill" and
seven friends from Cambridge
drove through Europe, the Mid
dle East and Africa, camping out.
They were nearly shot in Istan
bul when they inadvertently vio
lated the curfew.
During the trip, Bill was in
charge of transport he services
his own car in Britain—and in
charge of photographing wild
life. The pictures, with text by
some of the others, will become
a book and a film.
"This seemed to be the best
way of seeing Africa," he said.
"It's a bit of an adventure and
informal. That's what 1 like about
it."
London predicts Stanford will
like his royal highness; "most
people do."
