# Student Body President Wedin Speaks on Tasks of Students
## 
### 
The following are extracts from
from a speech made by Student
Body President Bud Wedin to the
freshman class.
The most difficult task facing
the student in this or any univer
sity is that of learning to think,
for clearly the process of think
ing is one of the most difficult
to develop, and even more diffi
cult to maintain. This entire ac
tivity is based upon the ability
of the mind to examine in minute
detail every general idea it holds
and ever y assumption from which
these come.
You will not have the time nor
opportunity to do this if you as
sume that the essence of educa
tion lies in the accumulation of
a certain body of knowledge or
in the attainment of a profession
al degree, for if you pattern your
college career on sucn an assump
tion what opportunities for think
ing do present themselves will be
lost in tho race to amass 180
credits.
. . . the idea of a university
cannot tolerate the student who
accepts w i th o u t questioning;
when these processes cease being
a part of education, then a uni
versity becomes a training cen
ter, not a place of learning.
THE END of a university
should be to teach you 1o educate
yourself. The presentation of
course material, the training for
a profession or degree, the expo
sure to the'works of great au
thors is not enough. Something
further and more lasting must be
given to the student, something
which can best be called an atti
tude toward learning and life.
It is the really great university
which produces the sensitive stu
dent, one who is aware and criti
cal of his society, one who has
challenged the notions inherent
in him from early life, one who
is free to decide about and con
tinue his education long after
leaving the university. I believe
this is the type of student Stan
ford should educate and that this
should lie its philosophy of edu-

I cation.
I ... Your interests may change
| from those of self advancement
II o t hose of concern and empathy
| for the situation of mankind
i throughout the world. But you
j can not successfully engage in
such types of action if you are
not sensitive to and concerned
I about the major problems and
i concerns of our times.
i You will be given opportunity
i to .join social and political activist
groups, ff you see fil to commit
|yourself to such action then join
them; if not, examine why. You
i should feel called upon to express
your opinions in the Stanford
Daily, the student Legislature, or
I the Stanford Student Congress.
This is the type of action I urge
you to assume, for within a uni
| versify ideas die if they are not
expressed, and your ideas are no
j exception.
THE SERVICE of students in
| policy decisions, curriculum eval
! nation, housing studies, and other
vital areas which directly affect
them is, indeed, meaningful and
worthwhile. To suggest that the
student does not have the right or
! ability to do so is to assume either
[a lack of maturity or intelligence
1 in their thinking or to suggest
j that he has no business evaluating
Ins education.
| These concepts of action I have
spoken of imply that there are
| vehicles for expressing ideas, for
enacting plans, and for achieving
goals whether educational or
otherwise. And, indeed, there are
such vehicles. But you will never
j discover them if you do not ask
i and inquire.
1 Everything I have said is pre
dicated on your ability to rebel,
j on your ability to alienate your
self from concepts and traditions
J (hat you have held environmen
■ tal, on your ability to separate
yourself from the familiar con
ventions and pleasantries of our
! society, on your ability to project
j your identity into an idea, and
:on your ability to stand alone
I against those who stand together.

which produces the sensitive stu
dent, one who is aware and criti
cal of his society, one who has
challenged the notions inherent
in him from early life, one who
is free to decide about and con
tinue his education long after
leaving the university. I believe
this is the type of student Stan
ford should educate and that this
should lie its philosophy of edu-

I cation.
I ... Your interests may change
| from those of self advancement
II o t hose of concern and empathy
| for the situation of mankind
i throughout the world. But you
j can not successfully engage in
such types of action if you are
not sensitive to and concerned
I about the major problems and
i concerns of our times.
i You will be given opportunity
i to .join social and political activist
groups, ff you see fil to commit
|yourself to such action then join
them; if not, examine why. You
i should feel called upon to express
your opinions in the Stanford
Daily, the student Legislature, or
I the Stanford Student Congress.
This is the type of action I urge
you to assume, for within a uni
| versify ideas die if they are not
expressed, and your ideas are no
j exception.
THE SERVICE of students in
| policy decisions, curriculum eval
! nation, housing studies, and other
vital areas which directly affect
them is, indeed, meaningful and
worthwhile. To suggest that the
student does not have the right or
! ability to do so is to assume either
[a lack of maturity or intelligence
1 in their thinking or to suggest
j that he has no business evaluating
Ins education.
| These concepts of action I have
spoken of imply that there are
| vehicles for expressing ideas, for
enacting plans, and for achieving
goals whether educational or
otherwise. And, indeed, there are
such vehicles. But you will never
j discover them if you do not ask
i and inquire.
1 Everything I have said is pre
dicated on your ability to rebel,
j on your ability to alienate your
self from concepts and traditions
J (hat you have held environmen
■ tal, on your ability to separate
yourself from the familiar con
ventions and pleasantries of our
! society, on your ability to project
j your identity into an idea, and
:on your ability to stand alone
I against those who stand together.
