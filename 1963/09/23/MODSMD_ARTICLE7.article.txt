"To assist to implement policies
of the University in a working
relationship with the student
body," is the characterization of
now ly appointed Dean of Men
Robert Gordon of his role.
Gordon expresses a strong in
terest in the fraternity system.
"As long as the University en
dorses a fraternity system, which
it does at Stanford. I do every
thing I can to work on positive
constructive development," he

WHEN QUESTIONED in re

and student action regarding it,
the Dean Noted, "Whatever my
personal feeling about social
liquor .... it does not affect my

only between campuses but inter
campuses, affects my position.
"1 will work with the under
graduates. with student leadership
so that thev can have the nnpoi

tunity for free expression in
working this out together," he
commented.
Gordon exhibited reservations
on the question of co-educational
housing. "Co-educational housing
does work where there are small
units i such as at Stanford Over

college. There are factors which
mitigate against co-educational
housing on a large campus. It is
even possible for it to work at a
large state University and not at
a private University."

people involved in a particular

edicts."
