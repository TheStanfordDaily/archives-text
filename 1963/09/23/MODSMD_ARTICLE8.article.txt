# National Student Congress Takes 'Strong Rights Stand'
## 
### THOMAS NEEL NSA Coordinator 
The delegates to the 16th Na- j
tional Student Association Con
gress, meeting from August 16-29 !
at Indiana University in Bloom- j
ington, Indiana, took a strong
stand on civil rights and educa
tion.
Bills and resolutions establish
ing policies and programs on be
half of the 1,600,000 member asso
ciation focussed in three areas:
civil rights, education, and inter
national political and student af
fairs.
JAMES MEREDITH, 1963
alumni of the University of Mis
sissippi, was perhaps the best
known speaker, although he was
criticized for the moderation of
his statements.
Student Non-Violent Coordinat
ing Committee Field Secretary
Robert Moses championed the
stronger words and action of his
group with a statement on the
connection between civil rights
and civil liberties.
With such comments as, "The
function of the white American
population is not so much to pre
pare the Negro for entrance into
the larger society to clean him
up. straight-jacket and necktie
him. make him presentable for
the supper table- but to prepare
society for the change it must
make to include Negroes," Moses
aroused strong sympathy for the
Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee movement. It proved
insufficient to gain financial as
sistance, but resulted in. a strong
endorsement of SNCC voter regis
tration activities.
AFTER ENDORSING the pro
test march on Washington, in the
face of the prediction of oppo
nents who feared a "walk now,
think later" attitude and possible
violence, the delegates discussed
the case of three SNCC field sec
retaries facing a possible death
penalty in Americus, Georgia.
The charge against them, "in
citing to insurrection," resulted
from their leadership in a com
pletely non-violent demonstration.
In response to the issue came a
NSA declaration urging "imme
diate action by the Justice Depart
ment," statements to go to Gov
enor Sanders of Georgia and
United States Assistant Attorney
General Burke Marshall, and a
visit by the NSA National Affairs
Vice-President to Washington to
follow up the action on the case.
Generally the debates on the
education issues entailed many
I amendments that left the sub
stance of the bills reasonably in
tact. "Fair Practices in Higher
Education" slated that "No mem
; her of society should be denied
j educational opportunity due to un
; fair discriminatory practices on
the basis of race, color, religion,
creed, national origin, or political
belief."
From this specific, principles
were drawn, among them: a state
ment that photographs should not
be required of applicants, a re
quest for a clear statement of ad
mission procedures from every
institution of higher education,
and a declaration that although
freedom of choice is a valid prin
ciple for social organizations to
employ in selecting members, the
i choice should be predicated on
I "criteria which do not discrim
inate on the basis of race, color,
national origin, religion, or eco
nomic conditions."
IN THE AREA of student
rights, academic freedom, the
! open forum question, and proce
dural and substantive due process
1 were raised for debate. Five spe
, [ cific cases of violation of aca
[ j demic freedom were discussed.
For example, last year at the
University of Washington, the
I j president, on behalf of the Board
of Regents, sustained a ruling
; that Communists would not be
-; allowed to speak on campus, and
| required that speakers be ap
-1 proved by " presidential commit
tee before receiving permission to
speak on campus. In response the
i congress passed a declaration
stating that, "Limitations upon
I student opportunities to hear all
; viewpoints are inconsistent with
[the educational obligations of the
• community, of the state, and of
; j public or private universities."
« ! Lastly, in the sphere of student
• legal rights, was the dual ques
tion of procedural and substantive
due process. In recent years some
- colleges and university adminis
i trat ions have suspended students
without permitting the accused to
• defend themselves in a, process
-1 like that in the civil courts, and
■ in a few cases without giving
I specific reasons for dismissal.
' , The rcsu 11 in j; decision by the

NSA body advocated tlie estab
lishment of a judicial council,
and urged that no student should
endure double jeopardy for an act
subject to civil or criminal court
authority.
CONCERNING substantive due
process, a case was made against
hazy regulations that imply a
student may be dismissed for "be
havior unbecoming to a student
of the particular university."
Since this policy can only be sub
jectively applied by the adminis
tration, it can lead to fluctuating
interpretations of what is and
what is not an offense.
As a result, the congress
adopted the principle that "due
process is fulfilled only when the
substance of the law does not in
fringe upon the following fund
amental rights: 11 freedom to
participate in political, religious,
and social action groups on or off
campus; 2> freedom to express
political, religious, and social
ideas, either written or spoken;
31 freedom to engage in respon
sible criticism; and 4) freedom to
pursue knowledge through free
and open inquiry within the
academic community.

International Afairs.)
