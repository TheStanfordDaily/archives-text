# Student Congress Clarifies NSA International Position
## 
### RICK STEARNS NSA Regional Chairman 
At its Sixteenth Congress this summer, NSA's international com
mitment rested on two suppositions: first, the student's role in affect
ing economic and social change; and second, the inability of the stu
dent to assume this role in a society which denies the university
the l ight to free intellectual pursuit. For these reasons NSA opposed:
a t colonialism "in any form" which manifests itself "in the denial

of the inherent l ight of a students
to study his own national heri-1
tage,"
b) imperialism "which negates !
the possibility of developing free,
responsible and democratic gov
ernment."
c) dictatorship which distorts'
the principles of academic free-j
dom and university autonomy. |
d) totalitarianism "Communist)
or Fascist" which denies rights
to the individual.
e> discrimination "both in the!
United States and abroad" which â– 
denies a student access to free I
and equal education, and
112) economic deprivation, the)
hardships of which make study;
impossible.
The Sixteenth Congress was un
precedented in its unified sup
port of these basic policy convic
tions.
Twenty-three National Unions
of Students had official observers |
at the Congress. The most force- j
ful foreign representative was
Jonty Driver, President of the
National Union of South African
Students. NUSAS, which he de
scribed as "virtually ihe last bi
racial organization functioning in
South Africa" leads opposition to
the arpatheid policies of the Veor
ward dictatorship. "We are not
optimistic about the future of
NUSAS," he continued, "only the
white skins of the majority of
our members and international
student recognition keep us from
jail." (although Driver himself
has been jailed several times for
his views).
NSA continued its adamant

opposition to arpatheid for its in
fringements upon the rights of
both white and Negro students.
While strengthening its condem
nation of South Africa for its
colonial activities in Southwest
Africa. NSA will continue its fi
nancial support of NUSAS.
In the resolution "Africa Un
der Portuguese Domination"
NSA condemned the Portuguese
government for pursuing the An
gola war and the United States
for supplying arms for Portu
guese use. Delegates agreed that
the United States should, if neces
sary. surrender its bases in the
Azores, rather than continue sup
port of the denial of Angolese
self determination. For its part
NSA established an African Free
dom Fund which will provide
scholarships to refugee students
from Angola and Southern Africa.
A BLANKET RESOLUTION on
Middle Eastern Affairs included
the following: confirmation of
NSA's recognition of the National
Union of Iraqui Students as op
posed to the international Union
of Students recognized General
Union of Iraqui Students, a Com
munist front supported by the
Kassem government and current
ly composed of a handful of Ira
qui students studying in Commu
nist countries: a condemnation of
the autocratic government of the
Shah of Iran for his denial of free
elections in Iran and for his wan
ton destruction of the University
of Tehran.
It also included a demand that
the United States discontinue
military aid to the Shah's gov
ernment: sympathy for the Arab
movement and its hope for even
tual Arab unity; admiration for
the newly-formed Syrian NUS
and its attempts to better the so
cial and academic lot of the Sy
rian student; and finally, interest
in a series of Israeli student run
seminars on the problems of em
erging nations.
NSA will continue its material
and technical assistance to Mid
dle Eastern student unions.
A special resolution, prompted
by deteriorating conditions in
Vietnam, protested the Diem's
government's brutal suppression
of student demonstrations and
the religious suppression which
led to these demonstrations. This
was perhaps th most hotly de
bated resolution of the Congress.
IN LATIN AMERICA, NSA
voted to continue its initially suc
cessful literacy campaign begun
in Bolivia and Chile. NSA also
encouraged the Puerto Rican gov
ernment to allow Puerto Rican
university students to organize
freely. Presently Puerto Rico is
represented internationally by
FUPI. a group of one hundred or
so communists who in no way
can be construed to legitimately
represent Puerto Rican student
opinion.
Overall, NSA remained com
mitted to its position that inter
national student cooperation can
never be achieved through th e
framework of the Soviet run In
ternational Union of Students,
and will never be achieved until
students resolve their differences
by imposed ideological structures.
