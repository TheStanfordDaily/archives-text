# New Religion Policy Called Into Question
## 
### 
It is quite possible that in the very near future the Committee
on Student Affairs and Services will he called into meeting to re
solve a question of interpretation of the Stanford policy on religious
activity.
A policy developed last year permitted religious groups to hold
closed meetings on campus and in university-owned buildings.
However, an attempt by the leader of the Stanford Ilillel Founda
tion to hold meetings of Ilillel classes on campus has called the
policy into question. The debate upon these classes seems to center
about two points: are they to be considered "academic teaching"
and thereby in violation of University curriculum policy, and can
these classes be considered closed meetings as presumably non-
Uillel members would attend.
Open religious meetings on campus are under the sponsorship
of the student-run Committee on Religious Affairs, representing 20-
odd religious groups, which decides whether or not a religious
speaker can come to campus. Ken Stevens, chairman of the Com
mittee, summed up last year's policy change as, "Campus ministers
were not previously allowed on campus; now they can see their
students freely."
The policy to permit religious groups on campus was only a first
step toward complete religious freedom, though an excellent one.
But before proceeding to the next step, that of freedom to worship
on campus for all denominations, we must assure that our first step
is a firm one.
The Stanford student body is urged to make known its wishes
regarding religion on campus, and the Committee on Student Affairs
and Services, or any other body which might entertain this question,
is urged to act quickly and firmly to bring the effect of last year's
policy to its full promise in offering a policy statement in reference
to the Ilillel request.
