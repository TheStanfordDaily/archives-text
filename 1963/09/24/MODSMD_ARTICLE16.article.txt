## Changes in Viet-Nam Policy Inadvisable for U.S. at Present 
### 
After a number of false starts
and altogether too much talking,
the administration seems to have
come to the conclusion that in
Viet-Nam the only practical pol
icy is to wait and see. It is a
sound conclusion. No dramatic
solution is possible.
There is no way to make over
Diem's government in Saigon or
to produce a new government
which will be so beloved by the
people that they will fight and
die for it. There is at the same
time no way in which Washing
ton could disentangle itself in
South Viet-Nam and continue to
subsidize and support Diem's
government, exercising such in
fluence as we can.
And so, while I have always
thought it was a mistake to be
come engaged in Southeast Asia,
while it is evident that we have
made many mistakes in dealing
with Diem, we must, I believe,
stay with him and his family for
the indefinite future. The United
States cannot renounce unilater
ally our commitment. We must
hold on and wait—wait, I should
imagine, until there is a funda
mental change in the power poli
tics of Southern Asia.
If I may venture to say more
specifically what it is that we
must wait for, it would bo the
opening up of the rift, which al

ready exists, between North Viet-
Nam and Red China, between
Mao Tse Tung and Ho Chi Minh.
In other words, just as the secur
ity and peace of the Balkan pen
insula in Europe became possible
after Tito's break with Stalin, so
the pacification of the Indo-Chi
nese peninsula depends on some
similar development in North
Viet-Nam. For if ever North Viet-
Nam becomes, like Yugoslavia,
no longer the satellite and agent
of a great Communist power,
there will be opened up possibili
ties of a negotiated settlement in
Southeast Asia.
QUITE EVIDENTLY, there has
been no such break between Mao
Tse Tung and Ho Chi Minh. But
such a break is possible. There is
an historic fear in Viet-Nam of
Chinese occupation based on the
experience of many centuries.
Such ancient national feeling can
at times prove to be more potent
than the rather recent ideologi
cal bonds. It is an importnat inter
est of the whole non-Chinese
world, not only ourselves, but
also the Russions, the French, the
British and the Indians, to do
what we can—but to do it very
discreetly—to induce a change of
front in North Viet-Nam.
Of all forms of prophecy, the
most foolish that a newspaper
man can indulge in is to guess
when something is going to hap
pen. As regards the Sino-Soviet.
break, the pace of events in Asia
has been much faster than any of
us, even though we have long ex
pected the break, had dared to
hope. In these matters it is pos«

sible to be too timid.
It may bo that the trigger which
would relase Titoist nationalism
in North Viet-Nam would be a
large-scale Chinese aggression
against India. For this would
precipitate a military adventure
which would leave Peking with
little surplus energy and power
to hold Viet-Nam in line.
It may well be, indeed it is
probable, that China, though it is
preparing to invade India as Mr.
Joseph Alsop has reported so
circumstantially, may pause. For
it must be known that the United
States, and possibly the Soviet
Union, too, would intervene. But

as long as Red China is mobilized
and paised for a large attack on
India, the other border states, in
cluding North Viet-Nam, have a
certain freedom of maneuver.
We must not expect too much
too soon, and in the meantime wo
had better go on holding not only
President Diem's hand, but also
that of Madame Nhu. While this
may not be a very satisfying or
attractive thing to be doing, we
must leave it to the historians to
decide how we got there and
whether ihe trip was necessary.

After a number of false starts
and altogether too much talking,
the administration seems to have
come to the conclusion that in
Viet-Nam the only practical pol
icy is to wait and see. It is a
sound conclusion. No dramatic
solution is possible.
There is no way to make over
Diem's government in Saigon or
to produce a new government
which will be so beloved by the
people that they will fight and
die for it. There is at the same
time no way in which Washing
ton could disentangle itself in
South Viet-Nam and continue to
subsidize and support Diem's
government, exercising such in
fluence as we can.
And so, while I have always
thought it was a mistake to be
come engaged in Southeast Asia,
while it is evident that we have
made many mistakes in dealing
with Diem, we must, I believe,
stay with him and his family for
the indefinite future. The United
States cannot renounce unilater
ally our commitment. We must
hold on and wait—wait, I should
imagine, until there is a funda
mental change in the power poli
tics of Southern Asia.
If I may venture to say more
specifically what it is that we
must wait for, it would bo the
opening up of the rift, which al

ready exists, between North Viet-
Nam and Red China, between
Mao Tse Tung and Ho Chi Minh.
In other words, just as the secur
ity and peace of the Balkan pen
insula in Europe became possible
after Tito's break with Stalin, so
the pacification of the Indo-Chi
nese peninsula depends on some
similar development in North
Viet-Nam. For if ever North Viet-
Nam becomes, like Yugoslavia,
no longer the satellite and agent
of a great Communist power,
there will be opened up possibili
ties of a negotiated settlement in
Southeast Asia.
QUITE EVIDENTLY, there has
been no such break between Mao
Tse Tung and Ho Chi Minh. But
such a break is possible. There is
an historic fear in Viet-Nam of
Chinese occupation based on the
experience of many centuries.
Such ancient national feeling can
at times prove to be more potent
than the rather recent ideologi
cal bonds. It is an importnat inter
est of the whole non-Chinese
world, not only ourselves, but
also the Russions, the French, the
British and the Indians, to do
what we can—but to do it very

After a number of false starts
and altogether too much talking,
the administration seems to have
come to the conclusion that in
Viet-Nam the only practical pol
icy is to wait and see. It is a
sound conclusion. No dramatic
solution is possible.
There is no way to make over
Diem's government in Saigon or
to produce a new government
which will be so beloved by the
people that they will fight and
die for it. There is at the same
time no way in which Washing
ton could disentangle itself in
South Viet-Nam and continue to
subsidize and support Diem's
government, exercising such in
fluence as we can.
And so, while I have always
thought it was a mistake to be
come engaged in Southeast Asia,
while it is evident that we have
made many mistakes in dealing
with Diem, we must, I believe,
stay with him and his family for
the indefinite future. The United
States cannot renounce unilater
ally our commitment. We must
hold on and wait—wait, I should
imagine, until there is a funda
mental change in the power poli
tics of Southern Asia.
If I may venture to say more
specifically what it is that we
must wait for, it would bo the
opening up of the rift, which al

ready exists, between North Viet-
Nam and Red China, between
Mao Tse Tung and Ho Chi Minh.
In other words, just as the secur
ity and peace of the Balkan pen
insula in Europe became possible
after Tito's break with Stalin, so
the pacification of the Indo-Chi
nese peninsula depends on some
similar development in North
Viet-Nam. For if ever North Viet-
Nam becomes, like Yugoslavia,
no longer the satellite and agent
of a great Communist power,
there will be opened up possibili
ties of a negotiated settlement in
Southeast Asia.
QUITE EVIDENTLY, there has
been no such break between Mao
Tse Tung and Ho Chi Minh. But
such a break is possible. There is
an historic fear in Viet-Nam of
Chinese occupation based on the
experience of many centuries.
Such ancient national feeling can
at times prove to be more potent
than the rather recent ideologi
cal bonds. It is an importnat inter
est of the whole non-Chinese
world, not only ourselves, but
