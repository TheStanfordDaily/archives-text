Editor, The Daily:
(Editor's note: Mr. Seifert is
currently a Wilbur Sponsor.)
Friday night last, over one hun
ched freshmen jammed the Soto
House Jounge to hear Ira Sand
perl's message of non-violence.
The bearded speaker entertained
questions with his usual warmth
and interested while members of
the Class of '67 struggled with
his simple chain of ideas.
A freshman girl, who had
brought to Stanford the accumu
lated knowledge of some eighteen
years, was moved to assert that
Sandperl's tolera n c e for the
Democrats was questionable
since everyone knows that the
Democrats are supported by the
Communists. Her comment was
met with mild laughter yet
courteously received by the
speaker. I could hope only that
she would be moved to speak
again that other misconceptions
might be disproved, for a house
cannot he built until the land has
been cleared. At the same time,

I thought of tho man whoso
daughter had just spoken. With
out his knowing it, morning
would bring him a new day, a
very new day indeed.
But the confrontation with
Sandperl won't he the last as long
as students are willing to commit
an idea for intellectual consump
tion, as long as they are willing
to digest the thoughts of others.
Still time will be short and much
will have to be done. Even with
the guarantee that this class
would bo within his reach for the
next four years, Ira Sandperl car
ried a tone of urgency in hi s
voice. The freshman class has a
long road to travel and very little
time to travel it. To borrow two
words from the "March on Wash
ington." action and committment
must be made in the "here" and
"now." One cannot wait for the
University to embrace him, in
stead he must embrace the Uni
versity, for it is a part of a world
for which we are all responsible.
