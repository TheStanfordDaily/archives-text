# U of Alabama Editor Barred From Covering Race Issue

### 
UNIVERSITY. Ala (CPS)
Tho 1962-63 "student editor of the
year" has been silenced by the
University of Alabama.
Mel Meyer, whose editorials in
the Alabama Crimson and White
gained him national attention
and drew repeated threats on his
life has been told by university
officials that he may not "write
upon or comment upon" any
racial matters.
Failure to comply with the uni
versity's demands, Meyer said,
will result in. "severe disciplinary
action" and possible expulsion.
THE ALABAMA administra
tion required Meyer and all other
students to sign statements agree
ing not to write or comment on
any racial matters for publica
tion, Meyer said. The administra
tion would not permit Meyer to
keep a copy of the statement he
signed. When he appealed the
policy he was told there could be
no change.
Meyer said he felt the new pol
icy was aimed, at least in part,
at him. He said the policy will
prevent him from acting as south
ern correspondent for the Colle
giate Press Service.
According to a spokesman for
the university the new policy only
applies to student correspondents
on the campus. Edward Brown,
director of the news bureau, said
that the school "prefers profes
sionals" to do the racial news
writing and said that a claim that
the policy would prohibit all com
ment by students was "silly."
The student correspondent ban.
Brown said, was the result of
long experience with student re
porters and that there would be
"no exception" to the rule.
ASKED IF the campus news
paper, the Crimson and White,
would be allowed to carry news
stories and comment on racial
maters, Brown said. "They cer
tainly will. They always have."
He said that the paper had al
ways done "pretty much what
it wanted."
Brown said the policy was set
by the president of the university
who acted as the representative
of the school's board.
The ruling was first effected
last June and is being continued

"until the trouble is over." Brown
said he didn't know when to ex
pect an end to the trouble, but
guessed it would bo "years."
Last February, the United
States Student Press Association
(USSPA) named writer Meyer
the "student editor of the year"
after he wrote edilorials calling
for obedience to federal law in
Alabama. The editorials appeared
during and after the crisis at the
University of Mississippi.
MEYER'S LIFE was threatened,
crosses were burned on the lawn
of his fraternity house, and the
university administration hired
two fulltime body guards for him.
"The thing that really bothers
me," Meyer said, "is that this ban
isn't just against writing about
events at the university—it is a
ban on all writing about all racial
matters."
Such a ban is an infringement
on the right of freedom of expres
sion, Meyer said, and invites cen
sure of the university.
Meyer said he signed the state
ment "under duress" and plans to
continue his appeals against it.
At the same time, he said, he will
task the newly formed Commit
tee on Freedom and Responsibil
ity of the Student Press to look
into the matter.
DEAN GOTTEHRER, General
Secretary of the USSPA and Di
rector of the Collegiate Press
Service said, "This ban indicates
that the University of Alabama
administration is not as respect
ful of the rights of its students
as we had earlier been led to be
lieve. Meyer was going to pro
vide the nation's student press
with full coverage of the events
in Birmingham and elsewhere
around the South. Now under
the terms of the pledge, a copy
of which still has not been given
to Meyer, he cannot do this."
The case goes beyond Meyer
and the press, Gottehrer contin
ued, but questions the rights of
all of the students at Alabama
to speak freely about the situa
tion there.
The Committee on Freedom and
Responsibility of the Student
Press i§ presently,being consulted
and will probably'investigate the
situation, according to Gottehrer.
