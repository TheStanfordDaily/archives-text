# Titchenal Raps Substitution Rule
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO lUPI) â€”Bob
Titchenal of San T .<se State said
Monday that college football's
new substitution rule works a
hardship on coaches who want to
get an injured man out of th e
game.
"The new rule can beat you
because now you have to call a
time out if you want to get one
of your injured players off t he
field, and only four time outs per
half are allowed this season," the
San Jose coach declared at the
weekly meeting of the Northern
California Football Writers Asso
ciation.
Titchenal indicated he favored
a return to the old "wild card"
rule in which players could be
shuttled in and out of the lineup
between downs. Under the new
code, teams only can substitute
freely on second and third down
if the clock is stopped.
