# Religion Policy Interpreted
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
The Stanford Hillel Foundation
and its director Dr. Harry May
have put Stanford's recent policy
on religious organizations to in
terpretive question.
Three weeks ago, in the absence
from campus of Chaplain Minto
and Assistant Chaplain Terrell,
May contacted the room sched
uling service to request a class
room. The classroom was to be
used for Hillel classes in Jewish
History, Modern Hebrew, and
recorder, three nights a week, 7
to 8:45. May stated that he un
derstood he was permitted to do
this in light of Ihe Stanford pol
icy on voluntary organizations, of
April, 1963.
MAY was told that he would
have to wait approximately one
week until a room was located
that was not to be scheduled as
an evening study room. He was
eventually told he could use room
41j, he stated.
The Hillel director said that two
days later, he was contacted by
the director of room scheduling
and told that he could not have
the room. "I gathered that they
turned me down as they thought
that I was reserving rooms for
myself as Dr. May. not as Hillel."
May contacted Chaplain Minto,
who said that he would give him
clarification. Clarification was
given at a meeting of chaplains
last week, at whkh May stated
that the Chaplain noted that as
the ruling was interpreted to him
by Executive Assistant to the
President Frederick Glover, th e
classrooms could be used bv re
ligious groups for discussion pur
poses but not for instruction.
MAY noted that the privately
owned Women's Clubhouse would
still be available to him. as it was
before the ruling was passed.
The Board of Trustees state
ment of policy (excerpts are re
printed on page two, this issue)
noted in part, "A registered vol
untary Stanford religious organi
zation may use University facili
ties for meetings, which are open
to more than members of the or
ganization and to specifically in
vited guests, only under the spon
sorship of the |student-run| Com
mittee on Religious Affairs.
"A voluntary Stanford organi
zation. which is registered with
the University and is a member
of the Student's Organizations
Fund, may use University facili
ties subject to scheduling, for
meetings which are limited to
members of the group and to spe
cifically invited guests, subject
to the policy of the University
which prohibits sectarian reli
gious worship services on cam
pus."
