# Building to Provide Math Center
## 
### 
The Alfred 13.I 3 . Sloan Mathematics Center has
been selected by the Board of Trustees as the offi
cial name for the new mathematics headquarters
now under reconstruction al the northwest corner
of ihe Quad, replacing Physics corner.
Sloan is Chairman of the Board of the Alfred
P. Sloan Foundation, which was the major donor
of funds for the $2,350,000 center. "Never before
has there been a more urgent need for creative
scientists than exists today," he said. ''At no time
has mathematics been more important."
In the past three years, the number of Stan
ford undergraduates majoring in math has nearly
doubled. Graduate level work and research are
expanding at an even faster rale. Course enroll
ments iti the subject totaled 3,000 per academic
quarter in 1902. among Stanford's 9,500 students.
Prof. David Gilbarg. executive head of the
Mathematics Department, emphasizes that all the
traditional fields continue to be covered ade
quately. But he adds that such special areas of
research as hydro-dynamics, relativity, mathemati
cal biology, management sciences, and others illus
trate the extent to which the interests of the Math
Department faculty interact with oher disciplines
at Stanford.
Another example of this trend is Stanford's
Institute of Mathematical Studies in the Social
Sciences. This will be housed in an addition to
Polya Hall, the University's newly completed Com
putation Center near the Hansen laboratories.
The Institute earlier this month received a grant
of $1,050,000 from the Carnegie Corporation of
New York.
In completing the Sloan Center, the original

sandstone walls have been retained to preserve
the familiar aspect: of the Quad's northwest cor
ner-. The site is one of the most important in the
history of science at Stanford.
It was here that Russell Varian made the first
Klystron tube in 1937, and Felix Bloeh discovered
nuclear induction in 1945, for which lie was later
awarded a Nobel Prize. William W. Hansen built
Stanford's first linear accelerator here in 1947.
and Paul Kirkpatrick devised the first X-ray re
flection microscope in 1948.
Interior demolition is now complete and the
steel framing for the new roof almost finished.
Work will be pushed on the sheathing and tradi
tional red tiles of the roof to provide cover before
the winter rains. Present plans call for its com
pletion in late summer of 1964.
The library and reading room will be on th
The library and reading room will be on the
top floor with a small terrace roof adjoining. A
large lecture room and other classrooms will be
on the lower floor. This will be sunk a little
deeper into the ground than the present basement
to provide maximum vertical space, but light walls
will be lowered also, to give a view into landscaped
greenery. Included in the design are quiet quar
ters for both group and individual research.
The Sloan Foundation contributed more than
$1 million toward the renovation. Gifts from other
private donors, plus a $250,000 grant from the Na
tional Science Foundation, are helping to defray
the cost. In addition, as part of the PACE pro
gram, the Sloan grant brings in approximately
$250,000 in matching funds from the Ford Foun
dation in unrestricted funds.


CONSTRUCTION ON THE soon-to-be-completed Sloan Methematical Center, formerly known as
1 Physics Corner, is proceeding regularly. The massive reconstruction job, which includes the sub-
I stitution of steel for wooden roof beams, a new roof, and an entirely refurbished interior, is
'expected to provide greatly improved facilities for students and professors alike.
