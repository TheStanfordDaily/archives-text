# Senate OK's Nuclear Pact
## 
### 
Associated Press
Yesterday, the Senate ratified
the history-making limited nu
clear test ban treaty after more
than two weeks of committee
hearings and an equal time of
Senate debate. The resolution
went through on a 80-19 roll call,
14 more than the 66 votes needed
with 99 senators recorded. For
ratification were 55 Democrats
and 25 Republicans. Opposed
were 11 Democrats and 8 Re
publicans. The treaty was signed
at Moscow Aug. 5 by the United
States, Soviet Russia and Great
Britain.
Opponents, who fought vainly
to the last, contended it jeopar
dizes th e national security,
freezes a Soviet advantage in
high-yield weapons and permits
the Russians to continue develop
ment underground in the small
weapons field where this country
now leads.
President Kennedy hailing the
Senators' action event before the
ballot, expresed 'delight at this
single but substantial step in the
direction of peace." Kennedy told
a group of Democratic congres
sional leaders that if a tax cut
and civil rights legislation can
be added to the treaty ratification
this will be a historic Congress.
He gave assurances that th e
United States will meet the mili
tary's four points by continuing
an aggressive program of under
ground testing, maintaining a
healthy laboratory weapons devel
opment program, keeping up a
readiness to resume atmospheric
testing if the Russians cheat, and
expanding and improving its fa
cilities for detecting such cheat
ing as well as checking on Sino-
Soviet atomic progress.
The Senators refused, by a 61-
33 vote, to attach to the pact an
"understanding" that it does not
inhibit the United States from
using nuclear weapons to defend
itself or its allies. Another pro
posal, by Senator Barry Gold
water, R-Ariz., to make ratifica
tions subject to the reservation
that the Soviets first remove their
weapons and troops from Cuba
was rejected 75-17.
The treaty came under scath
ing attack from Sens. Richard B.
Russell. D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Commit
tee, John Stennis, D-Miss., who
heads its preparedness subcom
mittee, Strom Thurmond, D-S.C.,
and others. Russell voiced fears
it. might be the first step toward
complete disarmament without
the safeguard of inspection. He
and the others said they were
concerned that Soviet morator
ium-breaking atmospheric tests
in 1961 and 1962 put them at an
advantage in high yield weapons,
in antiballistic weapons system
knowledge and in ways to harden
missile implaeements.
In the end, an overwhelming
majority of the Senate went along
with the endorsement of the mili
tary Joint Chiefs of Staff who
said that with four specified safe
guards. the military "risks and
advantages" were acceptable.
Kennedy in a letter read to the
Senate by Sen. Everett M. Dirk
sen, R-IIL, the Republican leader
gave the Senate "unqualified and
unequivocal assurances U.S. se
curity would be protected under
the treaty.

Opponents, who fought vainly
to the last, contended it jeopar
dizes th e national security,
freezes a Soviet advantage in
high-yield weapons and permits
the Russians to continue develop
ment underground in the small
weapons field where this country
now leads.
President Kennedy hailing the
Senators' action event before the
ballot, expresed 'delight at this
single but substantial step in the
direction of peace." Kennedy told
a group of Democratic congres
sional leaders that if a tax cut
and civil rights legislation can
be added to the treaty ratification
this will be a historic Congress.
He gave assurances that th e
United States will meet the mili
tary's four points by continuing
an aggressive program of under
ground testing, maintaining a
healthy laboratory weapons devel
opment program, keeping up a
readiness to resume atmospheric
testing if the Russians cheat, and
expanding and improving its fa
cilities for detecting such cheat
ing as well as checking on Sino-
Soviet atomic progress.
The Senators refused, by a 61-
33 vote, to attach to the pact an
"understanding" that it does not
inhibit the United States from
using nuclear weapons to defend
itself or its allies. Another pro
posal, by Senator Barry Gold
water, R-Ariz., to make ratifica
tions subject to the reservation
that the Soviets first remove their
weapons and troops from Cuba
was rejected 75-17.
The treaty came under scath

ium-breaking atmospheric tests
in 1961 and 1962 put them at an
advantage in high yield weapons,
in antiballistic weapons system
knowledge and in ways to harden
missile implaeements.
