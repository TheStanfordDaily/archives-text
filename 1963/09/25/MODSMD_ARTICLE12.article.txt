# Record 10,400 Due to Enroll By Week-End
## Registration Increases By 465 Men, Women 
### JANE SOKOLOW 
By the end of the week, a total
of 10,400 are expected to have
enrolled for Autumn Quarter, ac
cording to Registrar Harvey Hall.
At the end of the official two-day
period of registration, 7,787 men
and 2,319 women had registered.
These figures mean an increase
of 444 men and 21 womenâ€”that
is, a total increase of 405 over the
corresponding registration last
year, which is not a surprise,
said Hall.
PLANNING for Autumn Regis
stration began last July 5, the
day the Registrar's Office was
given a complete list of the new
freshmen from the Admission's
Office. The Registrar's Office
proceeded to code materials for
new and old students.
Hall emphasized that Muriel
Bengson, who was in charge of
the General Studies Program,
was "the most active single part
in geting ready." Since Miss
Bengson just graduated the year
before last, she has had much
experience with students.
"Her job was primarily to help
the advisors help the freshmen,"
said Hall. She was responsible
for mailing declarations of ma
jors to the freshman; for collect
ing and then giving to each ad
visor, information on freshmen
adivsees; and in conjunction with
Hall, for assigning advisors to
each freshman.
FOR THE FINAL STAGE,
the actual two days of registra
tion, it was necessary to hire a
host of personnel. Among them
were 17 taking in materials, 8
adjusting fees, 20 working with
class lists, about 3 from the West
ern Civ staff and about 3 from
the English staff working at the
Civ and English change stations.
In addition, there were cash
iers, those working for the Health
Service, and those from the Reg
istrar's Office in charge of the
inflow and outflow at Mem Aud.
Also, part of the police staff
was present. One officer was
stationed in front of Mem Aud;
some of the staff, as well as some
clerical assistants, were control
ling parking privileges; and some
of the staff were responsible for
the security of the cashiers.
IN THE OVER-ALL plans for
registration day, the persistent,
problems have been long lines
and the shortage of personnel.
However, explained Assistant
| Registrar Holten, the Registrar's
! Office is primarily concerned
with eliminating these problems
so that Winter and Spring Quar
ter registration which must be
completed in one day, will run
smoothly.
