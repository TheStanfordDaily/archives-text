# YD Policies Reflect Poorly Upon Students
## 
### 
The policies adopted for the year by the California Young
Democrats at their convention this summer do not reflect in
a complimentary fashion upon the organization. The policies
could be the result of any number of factors: lack of thought
on the part of the delegates, lack of knowledge of the work
ings of a two-party system, dogmatism, or desire to assert
publicized independence from their parent organization.
Their criticism of the Kennedy administration showed little
knowledge of the forces exerted upon a presidential adminis
tration. The wording of their demand for Red Chinese admis
sion to the United Nations showed little reflection of current
UN concerns, whatever merit their proposal may hold as an
abstract.
In times when students are not only coming to think of
themselves in terms of the political mainstream, but are ex
periencing efficacy within it, it is more than regrettable that
the "youth and students" branch of the Democratic party has
alienated itself from the pragmatic workings of government,
and has crawled back to the little-liberal-magazine-world of
dogmatism.
If the student community is to shed its disenfranchised
status, which it can do even without the power of the ballot
box, both the Young Democrats and the Young Republicans
must cease being the minority extreme of their parties.
