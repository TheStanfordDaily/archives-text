# YD's Attack Kennedy, UN
## 
### 
SAN DIEGO, California (CPS)â€”After a two day convention, the
California Young Democrats went on record in favor of American
withdrawal from South Vietnam, admission of Red China to the
United Nations, and more federal intervention in civil rights action
in the South.
The Young Democrats, however, refused to investigate sending
a delegattion to Cuba next summer "to determine the truth about

Cuba." Cany of the resolutions
adopted at the Convention were
critical of the Kennedy adminis
tration.
California Governor Edmund G.
Brown refused to speak out
against the Young Democrats
despite pressure from the GOP.
"Young Democrats don't speak
for me and I disagree on a great
many of their resolutions," Brown
said in defending their right to
speak. Brown said the YD's rep
resent a rather extreme point of
view and are part of a small mi
nority.
Republican pressure came from
California Republican Chairman
Caspar Weinberger who accused
the YD's of favoring "danger
ously irresponsible policies."
Joseph Martin Jr., Republican
national committeeman, called on
the governor to repudiate the
views of the group which Brown
refused to do.
