# Indiana Young Socialists Indicted
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
The arrest and eventual indict
ment of three University of In
diana students, leaders of the
campus chapter of the Young So
cialist Alliance (YSA), proved to
be a major concern for the Na
tional Student Association Con
gress which met, incidentally on
the University campus at Bloom
ington, Indiana, this past sum
mer.
On July 18 of this year, Mon
roe County Prosecutor Thomas
A. Hoadley (Bloomington, In
diana) succeeded in getting an
indictment against the three In
diana students, Tom Morgan,
Ralph Levitt, and Jim Bingham,
under a 1951 Indiana Communism
Act.
ACCORDING TO the "Nation
al Committee to Aid the Bloom
ington Students," the indictment
of July 18 *an earlier indictment
had been quashed because of
"faulty wording") charged that
on two occasions during 1963 the
three students". . . . did ... as
semble for the purpose of advo
cating and teaching the doctrine
that the government of the
United States and of the State of
Indiana should be overthrown by
force, violence, and any unlawful
means . .
Hoadley had been quoted pre
viously as saying, "My basic in
terest is not particularly to put
these students in jail, but to re
move it |the YSA| from the cam
pus facilities. It would have been
cleared up months ago if the
University had simply decided to
remove it."
NSA stated its position on this
issue in a Policy Statement on
Specific Violations of Academic
Freedom, which was eventually
adopted by the Congress. NSA
prefaced its statement with th e
following clarification of pr i n
ciple: "Unhampered expression
and discussion of all points of
view is fundamental to the con
cept of a free university in a free
society. The student has a special
interest in violations of fredoms
of expression and discussion and
has an obligation to cite and to
criticize specific instances of such
infringements."
AMONG OTHERS, NSA cited
the YSA case at the University
of Indiana as such an infringe
ment of freedom of expression.
The NSA declaration concluded.
"USNSA believes that if the ac
tion taken against the I.U. stu
dents and the pressures put upon
the University administration are
in fact based upon judgments of

the student's political views,
rather than because of any crimi
nal action, then these moves are
in violation of the principles of
academic freedom which specify
the rights of all students to repre
sent their own political views, no
matter how controversial,
through student groups and as
part of the process of free in
quiry." "USNSA strongly com
mends the Indiana University Ad
ministration for its continued de
fense of the rights of the univer
sity community and the individ
ual students in spite of great pub
lic pressure to the contrary."
ACCORDING TO a release
from the National Committee to
Aid the Bloomington Students,
the defendants in the YSA case
assert that they do not advocate
the violent overthrow of the
United States and Indiana gov
ernments and consequently, are
not guilty under the 1951 Commu
nism Act. According to the re
lease, the seditious meeting cited
in the Grand Jury indictment was
in fact a speech made by Leroy
Mcßae, a 22-year-old Negro and
a national officer of the YSA, in
support of "the Negroes' right of
self-defense in their struggle for
equality."
The National Committee release
noted. "Although over 125 per
sons, including faculty and towns
people, attended this meeting, the
Prosecutor sought the indictment
of only three . . . all officers of
the Bloomington YSA and stu
dents at Indiana University."
The National Committee re
lease concluded with a statement
on the unconstitutionality of the
Indiana Communism Act. Th e

Committee cited the rulings in
two similar cases, Pennsylvania
vs. Nelson (1956) and Yates vs.
United States (1957) in support
of the students' stand that the
act is, indeed, unconstitutional.
ONK OF THE strongest criti
cisms, not only of Prosecutor
Hoadley, but of the University of
Indiana Administration as. well,
came from Norman R. Hanson,
former Chairman of the Depart
ment of History and Logic of
Science at Indiana University and
present professor of philosophy
at Yale University.
In an article entitled, "Hoosier
Witch Hunt," reprinted from The
Nation and distributed by the Na
tional Committee to Aid the
Bloomington Students, Hanson
indicted Hoadley both for push
ing for the original indictment
and for allowing the case to be
"tried" in the local newspapers.
Hanson commented, "Rights
and wrongs of Hoadley vs. the
YSA are not really at issue here.
I am troubled by Hoadley—a man
of the law—seeking to "try" three
students via his own lurid news
paper accounts before the indict
ment was leveled."
THE BULK OF Hanson's arti
cle, however, was an intensive
criticism of the attitude of th e
Indiana University administra
tion and faculty during the YSA
affair. Hanson concluded, "I am
dismayed at the apathetic inac
tion of I.U.'s administration. . . .
Will academics never learn that
their rights to learn and study
and write are not the automatic
dispensation of a grateful popu
lace, but must be fought for, un
compromisingly, at every turn?"

Nation and distributed by the Na
tional Committee to Aid the
Bloomington Students, Hanson
indicted Hoadley both for push
ing for the original indictment
and for allowing the case to be
"tried" in the local newspapers.
Hanson commented, "Rights
and wrongs of Hoadley vs. the
YSA are not really at issue here.
I am troubled by Hoadley—a man
of the law—seeking to "try" three
students via his own lurid news
paper accounts before the indict
ment was leveled."
THE BULK OF Hanson's arti
cle, however, was an intensive
criticism of the attitude of th e
Indiana University administra
tion and faculty during the YSA
affair. Hanson concluded, "I am
dismayed at the apathetic inac
tion of I.U.'s administration. . . .
Will academics never learn that
their rights to learn and study
and write are not the automatic
dispensation of a grateful popu
lace, but must be fought for, un
compromisingly, at every turn?"
The arrest and eventual indict
ment of three University of In
diana students, leaders of the
campus chapter of the Young So
cialist Alliance (YSA), proved to
be a major concern for the Na
tional Student Association Con
gress which met, incidentally on
the University campus at Bloom
ington, Indiana, this past sum
mer.
On July 18 of this year, Mon
roe County Prosecutor Thomas
A. Hoadley (Bloomington, In
diana) succeeded in getting an
indictment against the three In
diana students, Tom Morgan,
Ralph Levitt, and Jim Bingham,
under a 1951 Indiana Communism
Act.
ACCORDING TO the "Nation
al Committee to Aid the Bloom
ington Students," the indictment
of July 18 *an earlier indictment
had been quashed because of
"faulty wording") charged that
on two occasions during 1963 the
three students". . . . did ... as
semble for the purpose of advo
cating and teaching the doctrine
that the government of the
United States and of the State of
Indiana should be overthrown by
force, violence, and any unlawful
means . .
Hoadley had been quoted pre
viously as saying, "My basic in
terest is not particularly to put
these students in jail, but to re
move it |the YSA| from the cam
pus facilities. It would have been
cleared up months ago if the
University had simply decided to
remove it."
NSA stated its position on this
issue in a Policy Statement on
Specific Violations of Academic
Freedom, which was eventually
adopted by the Congress. NSA
prefaced its statement with th e
following clarification of pr i n
ciple: "Unhampered expression
and discussion of all points of
view is fundamental to the con
cept of a free university in a free
society. The student has a special
interest in violations of fredoms
of expression and discussion and
has an obligation to cite and to
criticize specific instances of such
infringements."
AMONG OTHERS, NSA cited
the YSA case at the University
of Indiana as such an infringe
ment of freedom of expression.
The NSA declaration concluded.
"USNSA believes that if the ac
tion taken against the I.U. stu
dents and the pressures put upon
the University administration are
in fact based upon judgments of

the student's political views,
rather than because of any crimi
nal action, then these moves are
in violation of the principles of
academic freedom which specify
the rights of all students to repre
sent their own political views, no
matter how controversial,
through student groups and as
part of the process of free in
quiry." "USNSA strongly com
mends the Indiana University Ad
ministration for its continued de
fense of the rights of the univer
sity community and the individ
ual students in spite of great pub
lic pressure to the contrary."
ACCORDING TO a release
from the National Committee to
Aid the Bloomington Students,
the defendants in the YSA case
assert that they do not advocate
the violent overthrow of the
United States and Indiana gov
ernments and consequently, are
not guilty under the 1951 Commu
nism Act. According to the re
lease, the seditious meeting cited
in the Grand Jury indictment was
in fact a speech made by Leroy
Mcßae, a 22-year-old Negro and
a national officer of the YSA, in
support of "the Negroes' right of
self-defense in their struggle for
equality."
The National Committee release
noted. "Although over 125 per
sons, including faculty and towns
people, attended this meeting, the
Prosecutor sought the indictment
of only three . . . all officers of
the Bloomington YSA and stu
dents at Indiana University."
The National Committee re
lease concluded with a statement
on the unconstitutionality of the
Indiana Communism Act. Th e

Committee cited the rulings in
two similar cases, Pennsylvania
vs. Nelson (1956) and Yates vs.
United States (1957) in support
of the students' stand that the
act is, indeed, unconstitutional.
ONK OF THE strongest criti
cisms, not only of Prosecutor
Hoadley, but of the University of
Indiana Administration as. well,
came from Norman R. Hanson,
former Chairman of the Depart
ment of History and Logic of
Science at Indiana University and

noted. "Although over 125 per
sons, including faculty and towns
people, attended this meeting, the
Prosecutor sought the indictment
of only three . . . all officers of
the Bloomington YSA and stu
dents at Indiana University."
The National Committee re
lease concluded with a statement
on the unconstitutionality of the
Indiana Communism Act. Th e

Committee cited the rulings in
two similar cases, Pennsylvania
vs. Nelson (1956) and Yates vs.
United States (1957) in support
of the students' stand that the
act is, indeed, unconstitutional.
ONK OF THE strongest criti
cisms, not only of Prosecutor
Hoadley, but of the University of
Indiana Administration as. well,
came from Norman R. Hanson,
former Chairman of the Depart
ment of History and Logic of
Science at Indiana University and
present professor of philosophy
at Yale University.
In an article entitled, "Hoosier
Witch Hunt," reprinted from The
Nation and distributed by the Na
tional Committee to Aid the
Bloomington Students, Hanson
indicted Hoadley both for push
ing for the original indictment
and for allowing the case to be
"tried" in the local newspapers.
Hanson commented, "Rights
and wrongs of Hoadley vs. the
YSA are not really at issue here.
I am troubled by Hoadley—a man
of the law—seeking to "try" three
students via his own lurid news
paper accounts before the indict
ment was leveled."
THE BULK OF Hanson's arti
cle, however, was an intensive
criticism of the attitude of th e
Indiana University administra
tion and faculty during the YSA
affair. Hanson concluded, "I am
dismayed at the apathetic inac
tion of I.U.'s administration. . . .
Will academics never learn that
their rights to learn and study
and write are not the automatic
dispensation of a grateful popu
lace, but must be fought for, un
compromisingly, at every turn?"
The arrest and eventual indict
ment of three University of In
diana students, leaders of the
campus chapter of the Young So
cialist Alliance (YSA), proved to
be a major concern for the Na
tional Student Association Con
gress which met, incidentally on
the University campus at Bloom
ington, Indiana, this past sum
mer.
On July 18 of this year, Mon
roe County Prosecutor Thomas
A. Hoadley (Bloomington, In
diana) succeeded in getting an
indictment against the three In
diana students, Tom Morgan,
Ralph Levitt, and Jim Bingham,
under a 1951 Indiana Communism
Act.
ACCORDING TO the "Nation
al Committee to Aid the Bloom
ington Students," the indictment
of July 18 *an earlier indictment
had been quashed because of
"faulty wording") charged that
on two occasions during 1963 the
three students". . . . did ... as
semble for the purpose of advo
cating and teaching the doctrine
that the government of the
United States and of the State of
Indiana should be overthrown by
force, violence, and any unlawful
means . .
Hoadley had been quoted pre
viously as saying, "My basic in
terest is not particularly to put
these students in jail, but to re
move it |the YSA| from the cam
pus facilities. It would have been
cleared up months ago if the
University had simply decided to
remove it."
NSA stated its position on this
issue in a Policy Statement on
Specific Violations of Academic
Freedom, which was eventually
adopted by the Congress. NSA
prefaced its statement with th e
following clarification of pr i n
ciple: "Unhampered expression
and discussion of all points of
view is fundamental to the con
cept of a free university in a free
society. The student has a special
interest in violations of fredoms
of expression and discussion and
has an obligation to cite and to
criticize specific instances of such
infringements."
AMONG OTHERS, NSA cited
the YSA case at the University
of Indiana as such an infringe
ment of freedom of expression.
The NSA declaration concluded.
"USNSA believes that if the ac
tion taken against the I.U. stu
dents and the pressures put upon
the University administration are
in fact based upon judgments of

the student's political views,
rather than because of any crimi
nal action, then these moves are
in violation of the principles of
academic freedom which specify
the rights of all students to repre
sent their own political views, no
matter how controversial,
through student groups and as
part of the process of free in
quiry." "USNSA strongly com
mends the Indiana University Ad
ministration for its continued de
fense of the rights of the univer
sity community and the individ
ual students in spite of great pub
lic pressure to the contrary."
ACCORDING TO a release
from the National Committee to
Aid the Bloomington Students,
the defendants in the YSA case
assert that they do not advocate
the violent overthrow of the
United States and Indiana gov
ernments and consequently, are
not guilty under the 1951 Commu
nism Act. According to the re
lease, the seditious meeting cited
in the Grand Jury indictment was
in fact a speech made by Leroy
Mcßae, a 22-year-old Negro and
a national officer of the YSA, in
support of "the Negroes' right of
self-defense in their struggle for
equality."
