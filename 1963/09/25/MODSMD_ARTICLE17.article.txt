## Student Chief Disappears 
### 
RABAT, Morocco (CPS)
Three men walked into the office
of the National Union of Students
of Morocco late in the afternoon
on August 28, and asked to see
the president, Hamid Barrada,
claiming to be friends of his.
When Barrada appeared, the
men identified themselves as
policemen and forced Barada to
follow them. This was the last
seen or heard from Barrada.
HAVING BEEN arrested on
August 17, following a press con
ference given at the conclusion
of the Bth annual Congress of the
Moroccan National Union of Stu
dents, Barrada was released four
days later after some question
ing.
This time the arrest came 24
hours after a press conference
given by Barada and representa
tives of the Algerian and Tuni
sian National Unions of Students
Confederation.
A statement read on behalf of
the Confederation during the con
ference, condemned recent repres
sion against the opposition party,
the National Union of Popular
Forces, and the illegal imprison
ment and torture of hundreds of
persons. The group further
viewed the present monarchic
regime as "the last remaining
obstacle to the unification of the
Maghreb."
CONFUTING statements
have been made to Barrada's
whereabouts. The Moroccan
Ministry of Information con
firmed his arrest on the 28th. A
few days later, the Crown At
torney and the Ministry of Jus
tice said that a mandate had been
issued for his arrest, but that he
had not yet been caught.
Informed observers point out
that on the basis of recent experi
ence, Barrada is probably in the
hands of the Special Brigade be
ing submited to interrogation and
torture.
