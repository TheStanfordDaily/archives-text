LAFAYETTE, Louisiana (CPS)
â€”The delegates to the annual
convention of the National New
man Club Federation passed two
civil rights resolutions.
One resolution, entitled "Civil
Rights Legislation," stated, "We,
the members of the National
Newman Club Federation wish
to express our support to the
Congress in its attempts to enact
just civil rights legislation."
The second resolution called for
action against discrimination by
the Newman Federation through
cooperation with groups striving
to establish a sense of equality
for all people, through the crea
tion of an example on the part
of Newman leaders, through the
dissemination of knowledge con
cern in g discrimination and
through positive action by th e
local clubs according to the
wishes of the local ordinary.
Archbishop Paul J. Hallinan of
Atlanta, in a speech at the NNCF
convention said that the Index of
Forbidden Books has "little rela
tion to the student mind today."
The Index today, according to
Archbishop Hallinan, "docs not
touch the university library on an
intellectual plane. In fact, it does
not touch anything at all on that
level."
