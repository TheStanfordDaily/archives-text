# Letters to the Editor

### 
Editor, The Daily:
Ii was a pleasure to read the
front page article in yesterday's j
Daily on the Young Republicans.
In view of our somewhat
"strained" relationship in the
past, I would hope that the new
Daily Staff and the new YH ad
ministration can now look for
ward to a period of mutual co
operation if not complete political
agreement.
Lest some have raised eye-

brows over a prospective speaker
list including Barry Goldwater
but "headed" by National Review
Editor William Buckley, let me
hasten 1o add that Buckley heads
our list chronologically only. Wc
certainly do not wish to detract
from our other speakers w hi c h
include men the caliber of Sena
tor Dominick, Governor Hatfield,
and William Knowland.
KI) GREEN,
President, SAYR
