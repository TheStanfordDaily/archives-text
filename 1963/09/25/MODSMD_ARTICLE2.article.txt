# Cigarette Ad Loss Dents Daily, KZSU Finances
## 
### 
Max Sc-hulman's "Marlboro column" remains as a lonely reminder
of the lucrative cigarette advertising which, only last year, crowded
the pages of The Stanford Daily.
A recent decision by the majority of member companies of the
National Tobacco Institute has eliminated the bulk of cigarette ad
j vertising from college publications across the nation.
The Daily alone stands lo lose approximately $500 each month as
ja result of the manufacturers' decision. Other college papers have
been reduced to the point of near bankruptcy because of their adver
tising losses. Stanford's radio station. KZSU, may be forced to drop
â€¢ its wire service for lack of funds.
THE TOBACCO MANUFACTURERS' move, which has made
such an extensive dent in the revenues of college publications, is gen
erally interpreted as an eleventh-hour bid to forestall wholesale eriti
j eism of the industry's promotional techniques.
Commenting as to the philosophy behind the industry's change
of advertising policy, Tobacco Institute President George V. Allen
said. "The industry's position has always been that smoking is an
adult custom. To avoid any confusion or misconception in the public
mind as to this position, a number of member companies of the
I Tobacco Institute, I understand, have each decided to discontinue
college advertising and promotional activities."
Until the recent, decision, promotional activities by cigarette
manufacturers on U.S. college campuses were quite extensive. In the
I past, some forty per cent of all national advertising in college news
papers was placed by cigarette makers.
In addition, many companies have sponsored a variety of contests
: on campuses t<> encourage the use of their brands. Some companies
have had extensive portions of their sales force working full-time
on college promotion.
A RECENT ARTICLE in The Nation criticized the cigarette
manufacturers for a certain amount of hypocrisy in their decision.
The article commented, "American Tobacco made a virtue of neces
! sity."
The article continued, "Actually the growth of cigarette consump
tion was largely premised on the companies' getting their hooks into
the kids early, through campus publications, give-aways, ingenious
1 promotions, student solicitors, and almost every method short of
forcing the students to smoke."
The Nation criticism noted, "Furthermore, the industry has begun
to stop this early poisoning of the population for only one reason: it
i had to. The American Cancer Society and the Public Health Service
| have been harassing it, the Canadian and British medical societies
are on record, and it was only a question of time before the A.M.A.
, would crack down."
THE CIGARETTE .MAKERS' decision to eliminate college adver
tising is undoubtedly, the initial by-product of recent and numerous
, appeals to the industry by various medical groups.
Several weeks ago Roswell Park Memorial Institute, New York
State's cancer research-treatment center in Buffalo, New York, called
upon cigarette manufacturers to take voluntary measures to mimi
mize the health hazards of cigarette smoking.
In a letter to seven major tobacco companies Dr. Morton L. Levin,
Chairman of the Institute's Cigarette Cancer Committee, suggested
that cigarette packages bear a prominent statement saying, "Warn
ing, Excessive Use is Dangerous to Health."
In the context of such appeals, elimination of college cigarette
advertising appears as merely a first step in an all-out campaign
, against the consumption of cigarettes.
