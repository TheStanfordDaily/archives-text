# Algerian Students Reject Official Government Ties
## 
### 
lIYA--Representatives of the
General Union of Moslem Stu
dents of Algeria (UGEMA) held
their fifth congress August 12-22
in the capital city of Algiers. The
180 delegates, representing more
than 4,500 Algerian students, in
cluding those studying abroad,
engaged in freewheeling discus
sions of, among other things, the
Algerian 'road to socialism.' The
meetings were described by ob
servers as "turbulent," indicating
an impatience with official ortho
doxy. While the mapority of stu
dents strongly support the Ben
Bella Government, they voted
overwhelmingly to preserve the
autonomy of their national or
ganization in the face of Govern
ment pressure to conform. As the
resolution expressed it, only in
dependence from direct political
control would allow the union "to
play fully its role in the Algerian
nation."
The opening session was pre
sided over by the Minister of
National Education, Abderrah
mane Benhamida. During the
series of addresses by Govern
ment officials, one spokesman
urged the students not to "limit
themselves to purely student
union tasks, but to play a politi
cal role in the country, affirm
their African heritage, and take
the initiative in organizing Afri
can students in a group outside
of the existing international stu
dent organizations"—an apparent
reference to both the ISC/Cosec
and the lUS. However, perhaps
fearing that its call for 'independ
ence' might be misunderstood,
the ruling party, the National
Liberation Front, issued a warn

ing on August 16 that Ihe student
union "must follow a policy con
forming to that of the Front."
The warning was not heeded. The
Algerian students went ahead to
assert the principle of university
and student autonomy.
Before the fifth congress ended,
the students adopted a resolution
to delete the qualification 'Mos
lem' from the name of their or
ganization, changing it to the
National Union of Algerian Stu
dents (UNEA). Last year three
European student delegates had
been excluded from a union meet
ing because they were not of the
Islamic faith. This incident gave
rise to the discussion which re
suited this year in the abolition
of any such religious distinction.
Students of all faiths may now
become members or delegates of
the renamed UNEA.
In a post-congress development,
the attitude of UNEA was re
vealed to be unequivocally favor
able to the leadership of Premier
Ahmed Ben Bella. The Septem
ber 8 referendum on the new Al
gerian Constitution, giving the
Premier sweeping new powers,
was endorsed by the UNEA
executive committee. The UNEA
statement spoke of "the positive
and progressive character of the
text and the guarantees ... of
fundamental rights and freedoms
of its citizens." On September 8,
despite bitter opposition from the
poverty-ridden Kabylia region
and criticism from some of th e
former FLN leaders — among
them ex-Foreign Minister Bal
kacim Krim, now in exile—th e
new Constitution was approved
by a reported 98 per cent of those
who voted.

series of addresses by Govern
ment officials, one spokesman
urged the students not to "limit
themselves to purely student
union tasks, but to play a politi
cal role in the country, affirm
their African heritage, and take
the initiative in organizing Afri
can students in a group outside
of the existing international stu
dent organizations"—an apparent
reference to both the ISC/Cosec
and the lUS. However, perhaps
fearing that its call for 'independ
ence' might be misunderstood,
the ruling party, the National
Liberation Front, issued a warn

ing on August 16 that Ihe student
union "must follow a policy con
forming to that of the Front."
The warning was not heeded. The
Algerian students went ahead to
assert the principle of university
and student autonomy.
Before the fifth congress ended,
the students adopted a resolution
to delete the qualification 'Mos
lem' from the name of their or
ganization, changing it to the
National Union of Algerian Stu
dents (UNEA). Last year three
European student delegates had
been excluded from a union meet
ing because they were not of the
Islamic faith. This incident gave
rise to the discussion which re
suited this year in the abolition
of any such religious distinction.
Students of all faiths may now
become members or delegates of
the renamed UNEA.
In a post-congress development,
the attitude of UNEA was re
vealed to be unequivocally favor
able to the leadership of Premier
Ahmed Ben Bella. The Septem
ber 8 referendum on the new Al
gerian Constitution, giving the
Premier sweeping new powers,
was endorsed by the UNEA
executive committee. The UNEA
statement spoke of "the positive
and progressive character of the
text and the guarantees ... of
fundamental rights and freedoms
of its citizens." On September 8,
despite bitter opposition from the
poverty-ridden Kabylia region
and criticism from some of th e
former FLN leaders — among
them ex-Foreign Minister Bal
kacim Krim, now in exile—th e
new Constitution was approved
by a reported 98 per cent of those
who voted.
lIYA--Representatives of the
General Union of Moslem Stu
dents of Algeria (UGEMA) held
their fifth congress August 12-22
in the capital city of Algiers. The
180 delegates, representing more
than 4,500 Algerian students, in
cluding those studying abroad,
engaged in freewheeling discus
sions of, among other things, the
Algerian 'road to socialism.' The
meetings were described by ob
servers as "turbulent," indicating
an impatience with official ortho
doxy. While the mapority of stu
dents strongly support the Ben
Bella Government, they voted
overwhelmingly to preserve the
autonomy of their national or
ganization in the face of Govern
ment pressure to conform. As the
resolution expressed it, only in
dependence from direct political
control would allow the union "to
play fully its role in the Algerian
nation."
The opening session was pre
sided over by the Minister of
National Education, Abderrah
mane Benhamida. During the
