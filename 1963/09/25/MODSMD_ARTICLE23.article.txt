| Among the many freshmen
shuffling through registration
this week are some outstanding
athletes.
Two high school All-Americans
I will be among the excellent pros
' pects greeted by swimming and
i water polo Coach Jim Gaughran.
Jim Laney. from Phoenix, Ari
zona, garnered the honor for his
I competition in the free style, but
! terfly, and individual medley

! sen specializes in the middle dis
i tance free .style event and water
j polo.
SOME HIGHLY regarded bas
ketball prospects were also ex
pected to enroll this week. Fresh
man coach Turner is enthusiastic
about the prospects of such play
ers as Tom Nisbett, an All-Confer
ence guard from New Trier High
School in Winnetka, 111., and
| Andy Perko, a ti'4" All-Conl'er
cnce forward from Denver.
Coach "Dutch" Fehring expects
some very good baseball material j
to try out for the squad this year. J
Steve Hovley, a pitcher, was his
league's most valuable player,
compiling a remarkable win-loss
record over three years of 23-3.
Stanford's pitching staff should
make extensive use of Daro Qui- j
ring, from Escondido High in Po-1
way, who sported the best pitch- J
ing record in the San Diego semi
| pro league last year.
PAYTON JORDAN, track
' coach, said he was "very pleased
with the freshman prospects."
i He added that the quality and
quantity of talent on the squad j
could "give us one our best bal- j
pneed teams in recent years."
He specifically named Bud
Walsh, from Coos Bay, Ore.;
Bruce YVilhelm. a'Califorhia state
shot-put champion; Terry Fred
erickson, who was the state of
Minnesota 440 Champion last

i Dick Barkley, two local area
