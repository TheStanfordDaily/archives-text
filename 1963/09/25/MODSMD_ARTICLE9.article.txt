## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
A statement by Father John
Duryea, head of Stanford's New
man Club, indicates that he, too,
is unclear about the effect of the
University's new policy on sec
tarian groups.
"I have not made up my mind
yet if I will ask to use classrooms,"
Father Duryea stated. "Dr. May,
of the Stanford Hillel Foundation,
has brought up a test case. I will
not try to act under the new policy
as I understood it until I see what
is said to him." he added.
THE PRIEST SAID, "I plan to
hold meetings and lectures in Tre
sidder; and we do not expect re
sistance on this even after the
backtracking. After- the policy an
nouncement last year we held
some meetings there.
"I do plan to hold classes, but I
can't wait for a test case. I should
rather adapt to what is in exis
tence; I am not really a fighter-."
The priest noted. "I was very
delighted with the change in policy
as I feel the policy should be just
that. I have been waiting for
things to improve; they have im
proved, but only slowly," he
added.
"THERE ARE LIMITATIONS
in what I can do on campus as the

church is here. The church brings
us together, and we can't worship
on campus."
Expanding upon limited worship
on campus, Father Duryea said,
"My image of what Memorial
Church should be is like a military
base chapel, with facilities for ail
to hold services."
The "lest case" Father Duryea
referred to is the request by I-lillel
Director Harry May for permis
sion to use Stanford classrooms
three nights a week for Hillel
classes. May has been told, he
slated to the Daily, that the class
rooms were denied him for this
purpose as his classes would in
volve "instruction" as opposed to
"discussion."

some meetings there.
"I do plan to hold classes, but I
can't wait for a test case. I should
rather adapt to what is in exis
tence; I am not really a fighter-."
The priest noted. "I was very
delighted with the change in policy
as I feel the policy should be just
that. I have been waiting for
things to improve; they have im
proved, but only slowly," he
added.
"THERE ARE LIMITATIONS
in what I can do on campus as the

church is here. The church brings
us together, and we can't worship
on campus."
Expanding upon limited worship
on campus, Father Duryea said,
"My image of what Memorial
Church should be is like a military
base chapel, with facilities for ail
to hold services."
The "lest case" Father Duryea
referred to is the request by I-lillel
Director Harry May for permis
sion to use Stanford classrooms
three nights a week for Hillel
classes. May has been told, he
slated to the Daily, that the class
rooms were denied him for this
purpose as his classes would in
volve "instruction" as opposed to
"discussion."
