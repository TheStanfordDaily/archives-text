# Completion Nearly at Hand For White Memorial Plaza
## 
### 
Mosai patterned paving of
White Memorial Plaza, described
as the future "hub of the Uni
versity community" by project
planner Dan Rolfe, will be in
stalled within two weeks. Accord
ing to Rolfe the work is proceed
ing "on schedule" although ho
alluded to "all sorts of problems"
which have made it difficult to
meet this schedule. A major dif
ficulty, he said, was the location
of existing utility lines whose po
sitions were not recorded.
However, Rolfe continued, the
project was never hoped to be
completed by the end of summer;
highest expectations were that
the paving be installed by the
time quarter began. Rolfe
praised the contractor for his ef
forts to avoid inconvenience for
students passing through the
area, stating that at all times
during the paving of the area,
provisions will be made to allow

convenient student passage from
one building to another.
Plantings in tlie 200,000 square
foot area at the end of fraternity
row between the Post Office and
Tresidder Union are to be in ;>lace
by the middle of November.
Landscape architect Tho m a s
Church is in charge of this phase
of the project.
Construction of the plaza was
begun during the first week of
July. It is the result of a gift
made to the University by Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond White of
Kansas City in honor of their two
sons, John Barber White II and
William Nicholas White. Stanford
graduates who died soon after
leaving the university.
One central feature of the
plaza is to be a fountain located
between the Post Office and the
old student union.
A sculpture currently being
executed by San Francisco artist
Aristedes Demetrios is to orna
ment the fountain. Demetrios is
constructing the modern work of
bronze textured metal in a multi
faceted â€¢ surface pattern. It will
rise -6 feet above the 35-foot wide
pool of the fountain.
Planner Rolfs predicts that the
entire project, including fountain
and sculpture, will be completed
by the end of Autumn quarter.
Large paved areas of the plaza
will be suitable for student gath
erings. Sections of lawn will also
become features of the park-like
memorial.
