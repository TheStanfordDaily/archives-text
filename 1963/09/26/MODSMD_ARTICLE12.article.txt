# Church Photos At Art Gallery
## 
### 
"Twelve Churches," an archi
tectural study in photographs, is
the current exhibit at the Stan
ford Art Gallery. Arranged by
the California Redwood Associa
tion and circulated by the Smith
sonian Institution Traveling Serv
ice. the exhibit is composed of
different shuts of twelve archi
tecturally outstanding American
churches.
In all of them the predominant
building material is redwood; the
effect, however, is different in
all of the buildings shown.
The range includes such widely
varying churches as the simple
and oblong Danforth Chapel in
Fort Collins, Colorado, whose
windows are covered with a grid
work of mullions and stained
glass, to the many-angled Hope
Lutheran Church in Colma, Cali
fornia. with its warmly textured
wood walls. Another example is
the Temple Emmanuel in West
wood. New Jersey, which has a
large, arched hall enabling the
building to be multi-purpose.
ACCORDING TO the posted
statement of the Redwood Asso
ciation, . . . "the twelve churches
displayed make no attempt to de
fine a new ecclesiastical archi
tecture. but the strongly suggest
a new vigor and inventiveness
on the part of church architects.
There is no formal plan, no for
mal symbolism, that dominates.
Instead, the ministry, and the
architect in his turn, have been
allowed to seek an individual ex
pression of reverence. An d
through the use of natural ma
terials rich in warmth and tex
ture. through recreation and edu
cation facilities that enable a
church to become a part of its
community, the congregation is
invited to enter and participate."

lowing one. which will run from

"Twelve Churches," an archi
tectural study in photographs, is
the current exhibit at the Stan
ford Art Gallery. Arranged by
the California Redwood Associa
tion and circulated by the Smith
sonian Institution Traveling Serv
ice. the exhibit is composed of
different shuts of twelve archi
tecturally outstanding American
churches.
In all of them the predominant
building material is redwood; the
effect, however, is different in
all of the buildings shown.
The range includes such widely
varying churches as the simple
and oblong Danforth Chapel in
Fort Collins, Colorado, whose
windows are covered with a grid
work of mullions and stained
glass, to the many-angled Hope
Lutheran Church in Colma, Cali
fornia. with its warmly textured
wood walls. Another example is
the Temple Emmanuel in West
wood. New Jersey, which has a
large, arched hall enabling the
building to be multi-purpose.
ACCORDING TO the posted
statement of the Redwood Asso
ciation, . . . "the twelve churches
displayed make no attempt to de
fine a new ecclesiastical archi
tecture. but the strongly suggest
a new vigor and inventiveness
on the part of church architects.
There is no formal plan, no for
mal symbolism, that dominates.
Instead, the ministry, and the
architect in his turn, have been
allowed to seek an individual ex
pression of reverence. An d
through the use of natural ma
terials rich in warmth and tex
ture. through recreation and edu
cation facilities that enable a
church to become a part of its
community, the congregation is
invited to enter and participate."
The special exhibits at the art
gallery are changed about every
three weeks; "Twelve Churches"
will run until Oct. 13. The fol
lowing one. which will run from
Oct. 15 until Nov. 3. is "Arts of
Southern California." a sculp
tural exhibit organized by the
Long Beach Museum of Art. All
special exhibits are arranged for
by the Stanford Museum.
