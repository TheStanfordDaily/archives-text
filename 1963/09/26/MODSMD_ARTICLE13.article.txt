# Communist Students React Poorly to Treaty
## 
### 
The reaction of lite Communist-backed International Union
of Students to the nuclear test ban treaty is a strong example
of a portion of the world student community lagging behind
its elders.
The lUS briefly hailed the treaty, then went on to state
that "U.S. and British imperialists" were "forced" to sign the
Treaty. The great portion of their statement is a re-itera
tion of the dogmatic issues that philosophically have divided
East and West and made the destruction of the human race
a possibility.
The presumed "realist" might charge that the tone of the
I US statement differs little if at all from the feelings of Soviet
Premier Khrushchev as he worked with the Treaty. However,
the semantic content of political dialogue is often as important
as its philosophical content. That the Soviet chief did not
speak ol "American and British imperialists" being "forced"
to sign the treaty eliminated many possible barriers to a peace
ful co-existance.
Since the beginning of collective flunking by man, the
"Common Sense" and "Communist Manifesto" vocabulary has
inflamed t,he passions of the world. And the vocabulary of
the United Nations Charter and the Test Ban Treaty has
soothed them. Each vocabulary has its time, and the Treaty
was a time for soothing.
The emergence of the Treaty, and its ratification by the
United States Senate are major steps of progress in our time.
On the basis of the reaction of the I US, one can only be thank
ful that these students do not rule their portion of the world.
