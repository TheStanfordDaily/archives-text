reach an agreement on general,
complete and controlled disarma

of tension in many parts of the
world.
The lUS Secretariat, while wel
coming the Moscow agreement,
calls on the students of the world
and their organizations to in
crease their vigilance and to in
tensify their struggle for the
realization of a test ban treaty
which would lead to the complete

among states with different social
systems, for national liberation
and against colonialism and im
perialism.

(The following is the state
ment. of the Secretariat of the
[Communist-backed | Interna
tional Union of Students (lUS)
on the Moscow Test Bnn Treaty
as published in the August,
1963, issue of the organization's
magazine News Service.)
The Secretariat of the Interna
tional Union of Students wel
comes the conclusion of a treaty
by the governments of the USSR,
USA and the United Kingdom
banning atmospheric, outerspace
and underwater nuclear tests
which has already been supported
by a number of governments and
hopes that other governments
will follow suit.
Basing itself on the resolutions
of the 7th lUS Congress, the Sec
retariat considers this treaty a
step towards the relaxation of in
ternational tension and the safe
guarding of world peace — the
cherished hope of humanity as a
whole. At the same time the lUS
Secretariat hopes that this treaty
will lead to the conclusion of a
test ban treaty which must re
sult in the complete cessation of
all nuclear stockpiles and the
achievement of general, complete
and controlled disarmament.
The lUS Secretariate points out

that the signing of this treaty was
forced upon the United States and
British governments by the
mounting struggle of all the
forces of peace all over the world.
However, only a partial victory
has been achieved by the people.
The U.S. and British imperialists
have refused to reach an agree
ment. on the prohibition of under
ground tests. They still refuse to
reach an agreement on general,
complete and controlled disarma
ment and still continue their pol
icy of intervention and creation
of tension in many parts of the
world.
The lUS Secretariat, while wel
coming the Moscow agreement,
calls on the students of the world
and their organizations to in
crease their vigilance and to in
tensify their struggle for the
realization of a test ban treaty
which would lead to the complete
cessation of all nuclear tests, for
general and complete disarma
ment, for peaceful co-existence
