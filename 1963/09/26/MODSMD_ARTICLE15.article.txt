# Cat Sororities Weaken
## 
### PEGGY KRAUSE (The Daily Californian) 
Four hundred and forty-seven
girls pledged sororities at the
University this year as opposed to
503 last year, a ten per cent de
cline.
Sue Herney, Panhellenic presi
dent. stressed that the decline in
pledges is "nothing tragic." The
decline is part of a nationwide
trend, according to Mrs. Ardath
Swobe, Panhellenic secretary.
THE REASONS for the decline
are unknown, according to Miss
Ilerney. During the annual eval
uation meeting for rush chair
men the question will be dis
cussed.
Tighter academic requirements
at the University bring in stu
dents with "possibly more intel
lectual interests," Mrs. Swobe
said. In addition, concern for
housing, in case a rushee does

not pledge, keeps some girls from
rushing, she added.
Mrs. Swobe also said that more
discussion on the fraternity-soror
ity system in recent years may
have caused some girls not to
rush.
THE PERCENTAGE of rush
ees who pledge has remained the
same, Miss Herney added.
Freshman girls who decided
not to rush gave various reasons.
"It doesn't appeal to me, and it
is too much demand on my time,"
one girl said. Another claimed
that it was more of a challenge
living in a dorm.
Several girls gave this reason:
A sorority is not needed and
one can have as much social life
outside a sorority.
Some freshman girls said that
with more dormitory housing,
there is less need to pledge a
sorority to obtain a place to live.
