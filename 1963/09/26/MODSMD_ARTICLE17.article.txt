The freshmen introduction to
"Flicks" justifies considerable
pessimism about the quality of
future Sunday entertainment and
the taste and judgment of th e
ASSU. The audience reaction to
a dramatic and emotion-loaded
motion picture, and the selection
of this movie for Stanford view
ing were in extremely poor taste,
especially at a time when Stan
ford should bo striving to demon
strate moral discrimination and
artistic values to new members
of its student body.
The detail of the rape scene in I

| Virgin Spring was sordid, and the
j audience's ignorance of the seri
-1 ousness and baseness of rape do
! stroyed the image of Stanford as
an institution of mature intellect
uals.
If the movie were shown for
artistic purposes and received as
such the rape scene might be
justified, but if the movie were
shown for entertainment, it is ob
vious that Stanford is not ready
for mature treatment of delicate
subjects, and that these subjects
should be expurgated from stu
' dent body entertainment at Stan
j ford.
