(Editor's Note: The following
is a reprint from The Daily
Californian of Monday, Septem
ber 16, 1963. It was the first
of a series of articles covering
political groups at the Univer
sity of California. The varied
and sometimes rabid nature of
these groups would seem to
make them of interest to Stan
ford as a neighboring school.)
THE RIGHT:
The two campus student groups
on the right will concentrate on
getting good speakers, building
up a political library and organiz
ing precinct workers.
Young Republicans:
The Young Republicans are the
youth branch of the Republican
party. The YR's work during
elections doing precinct work and
sponsoring speakers.
"We are the work force of the
party," YR member Glen Gabel
said "During the primaries we
do not sponsor candidates but
give students the opportunity to
work for the man of their choice.
Then for the big elections we all
work educating the voters and
getting out the vote."
This semester the YR's will
concentrate on a good speakers
program and starting discussion
forums in living groups.
The University Society of In
dividualists is the conservative
group on campus. The USI be
lieves in, "limited government,
free enterprise and individual
liberty," Gabel said.
This summer the USI gathered
a 900-volume library of books and
pamphlets on conservative poli
tics, general politics and eco
nomics. The library will soon be
open to students for reference.
The USI will also continue its
publication, "Man and State."
The group is aiming at publica
tion of the political journal every
two or three weeks.
THE LEFT:
The campus political scene on
the left this semester will be
dominated by intensive work in
the civil rights area, a push for
United States removal of troops
from South Viet Nam and in
creased speaker and education
programs by the liberal groups.
Slate:
Unlike the other political
groups, Slate has no specific phil
osophy but is a general liberal
action - education organization.
Slate also concerns itself with
campus politics and runs candi
dates for student offices.
Slate was organized five years
ago by students who saw a need
for more meaningful student gov
ernment and for a group for stu
dents wanting to work for liberal
politics but not willing to join a
group with definite philosophy.
Last year Slate picketed for a
peace research institute, pub
lished an issue of its journal,
"The Cal Reporter," on educa
tional reform, and worked against
the now-removed Communist
speaker ban.
Slate chairman Robin Room
said the group will work on a
counter-orientations program for
freshmen, housing testing when
the state non-discrimination hous
ing bill goes into effect this week,

and is considering several refer
enda for the freshman elections.
YSA
The Young Socialist Alliance is
a "revolutionary socialist youth
group working toward the estab
lishment of full political, social
and economic democracy," ac
cording to member John Belisle.
"The YSA's goal is a socially
owned and planned economy
domocratically managed by th e
working class and full self-deter
mination for the Negro people,"
Belisle said.
YSA is aiming toward a "radi
cal transformation of the entire
economic, political, and social or
der," he added giving as a rough
example the Cuban revolution.
Plans for this semester include
working to aid the YSA members
in Bloomington, Indiana, indicted
for "conspiracy to advocate vio
lent overthrow of the United
States government," and defend
ing the students recently returned
from Cuba and will emphasize
"defending the Cuban and Chi
nese revolutions against Ameri
can imperialism."
Dubois club:
The Dußois Club, started in the
fall of last year, is an "independ
ent Marxist socialist youth group
working for scientific socialism,"
according to a member.
It is both an education and an
action group. Last semester the
Dußois Club held classes, spon
sored speakers, and gave forums.
Unlike YSA, the Dußois Club
believes in the gradual takeover
of socialism by strenghening all
people's governments.
The Dußois Club makes a point
of sponsoring Communist: speak
ers and always has one or two
pieces of Communist party litera
ture on its tables, the member
said.
"This is for two reasons," he
said. "First, we believe in aca
demic freedom. Second, the Com
munist party has had a bad
forum in the United States and
we feel all sides should be heard
fairly."
The Dußois Club's work this
semester will be for "Negro liber
ation," removal of United States
troops from Viet Nam and aca
demic freedom.
YPSL:
The Young People's Socialist
League is the youth branch of the
Socialist party in the United
States. It: believes 1 in democratic
socialism and is "dedicated to
building a 7 society at the service
of human needs," according to
their pamphlet.
YPSL was largely inactive last
year, but is planning to work
strongly in the civil rights area
this year.
YD:
The University Young Demo
crats are the Democratic Party's
youth group. According to YD
president Bob Nakamura, th e
group's membership is generally
liberal.
Last year YD members worked
for the Berkeley Fair Housing
Ordinance and the club worked
in the state gubernatorial elec
tions. This year's plans will ac
cent civil rights and include pro
tests against United States troops
in Viet Nam.
