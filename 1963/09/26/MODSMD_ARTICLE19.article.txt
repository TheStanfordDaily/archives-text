## 
### 
Despite last week's impressive
Stanford win over San Jose State,
New York bookmakers have in
stalled Oregon as a one-point
favorite to gain their first victory
of the season Saturday at Stan
ford Stadium.
The Ducks, largely because of
All-American halfback Mel Ren
fro, had also been favored over
Penn State at Portland last week,
but Rip Engle's Nittany Lions

the fourth period to upset the
Webfeet.
RENFRO, called "a truly great
football player" by his coach Len
Casanova, scored the only Oregon
touchdown Saturday on a one
yard plunge. The great halfback
has had some of his finest hours
in action against Stanford.
As a sophomore, he touched

the ball just fivo limes at Stan
ford Stadium, and three scores
resulted.
But Renfro is not the only
threat on the Webfeet eleven. De
pendable right hall' Larry Hill
last year gained a tolal of f>34
yards from scrimmage, averag
ing ( : .4 yards per carry.
JUNIOR QUARTERBACK Bob
Berry prevents the defense from
keying on the runners too much,
having completed 62 of 115 passes
in 1902.
Oregon is having some trouble
in the line, however, where mam
moth Steve Barnett, now playing
tackle for the Chicago Bears, has
not been effectively replaced.
Five other starters in the line are
also gone from last year's team.
Last year saw Casanova's crew
win out 28 to 14 at Portland as
Berry and Renfro teamed to kill
the Cards.
Renfro's scores came on slants
of one and eight yards and on a
42 yard pass from Berry, while
Berry himself scored the first
Oregon touchdown from the one.
