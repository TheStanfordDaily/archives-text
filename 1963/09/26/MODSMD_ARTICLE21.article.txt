# Frosh Eleven Working Hard
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
Potentially one of Ihe best and
fastest Stanford frosh elevens in
recent years will begin its season
against the Santa Clara J.V.'s on
Oct. 12. New coach Bill Walsh,
former Cal end coach, opened
sessions on Monday and has al
ready had light contact work.
The young tribe will have run
ning speed and power to offset
its passing. Quarterbacks Rich
Bianchina, Dean Bowman, Dave
Lefis, and John Propstra threw
well opening day and are pres
ently the contenders for the first
string berth. A highly sought
after high school All-American.
Dave Lewis is the top prospect
of the four.
Halfback speedsters Bob Oar

and Bob Blunt distinguished
themselves in the tough sprint
workouts. Mike Hibler shone at
the fullback slot.
In the line, most positions boast
fine individual talentâ€”Al Wil
burn and Don DeSomery at end,
Jim Mills at tackle, and Dave Net
to at guard. A question that fur
ther practices will have to answer
is whether there is sufficient
depth.
In the next few weeks, Walsh
will be switching players to new

positions to best use available
talent and to patch up weak spots.
Once the season gets under way,
he said he will play as much of
the team as possible without
hurting the team's chances of
winning.
