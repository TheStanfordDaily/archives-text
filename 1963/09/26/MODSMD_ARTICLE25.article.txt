THE DEAN YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUK OWN
Colleges :ire c<implicated :md bewildering places, filled with
complicated and bewildering people. Today let us examine
one of the most complicated and bewildering yet (etching ami
lovable—of all campus figures. I refer, of course, to the dean
of students.
Policeman and confessor, shepherd ami seer, warden and
oracle, proconsul and pal — the dean of students is all of these.
How. then, can we understand him? Well sir, perhaps the bc.-t
way is to take an average day in the life of an average dean.
Here, for example, is what happened last I'hursday to Dean
Killjoy X. Damper of the Duluth College of Belles Lcttres
and I'emmican.
At <> a.m. he woke, dressed, lit a Marlboro, and went up <>n
the roof of his house to remove the statue of the founder
which had been placed there during the night by high
spirited undergraduates.

At 7 a.m. he lit. a Marlboro and walked briskly to the cam
pus. ( I'he Dean had not been driving his car since it had been
placed on the roof of the girls dormitory by high-spirited
undergraduates.)
At 7:1") a.m. he arrived on campus, lit a Marlboro and
climbed the bell tower to remove hi- secretary who had been
placed there during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.
\t 8 a.m. he reached his office, lit a Marlboro, and met with
K. I'luribus Kwbank, editor of the student newspaper. Young
Kwbank had been writing a series of editorials urging the
I'nited States to annex Canada. When the editorials had
evoked no rcsjwmse, he had taken matters into his own hands.
Accompanied by his society editor and two proofreaders, he
had gone over the bonier and conquered Manitoba. With great
patience and several Marllx>ro Cigarettes, the Dean persuaded
young Kwbank to give Manitoba back. Young Kwbank, how
ever. insisted on keeping Winnipeg.
At 0 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with lloberl
I'enn Sigat'oos, president of the local Sigma Chi chapter, who
came to report that the Deke house had been put on tup of
the Sigma Chi house during the night by high-spirited under
graduates.
At 10 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and went to umpire
an intramural softhall game on the roof of the law school
where the campus baseball diamond had been placed during
the night by high-spirited undergraduates.
At I- noon the Dean had a luncheon meeting with the
prexy, the bursar, and the registrar, at the bottom of the cam
pus swimming jv>ol where the faculty dining room had been
placed during the night bv high-spirited undergraduates,
Marlboros were passed after luncheon, but not lighted, owing
to dampness.
At - p.m., back in his office, the Dean ii* a Marlboro and
received the Canadian Minister of War who said utiles- young
Kwbank gave back Winnipeg, the ('anadian army would march
against the 1 S. immediately. Young Kwbank wa summoned
and agreed to give hack Winnipeg if he could have Moose .law.
The Canadian Minister of War at first refused, but filially con
sented after young Kwbank placed him on the roof of the
metallurgy building.
At p.in. the Dean lit a Marlboro and me! with a delega
tion from the student council who came to present him with
a set of matched luggage in honor of his fifty v< ar- service a
dean of students. The Dean promptly packed the luggage illl
all hi- clothing and fled to I'tica, New York, where lie is now
in the aluminum siding game. , m 3 Max ai>wrn»n

complicated and bewildering people. Today let us examine
one of the most complicated and bewildering yet (etching ami
lovable—of all campus figures. I refer, of course, to the dean
of students.
Policeman and confessor, shepherd ami seer, warden and
oracle, proconsul and pal — the dean of students is all of these.
How. then, can we understand him? Well sir, perhaps the bc.-t
way is to take an average day in the life of an average dean.
Here, for example, is what happened last I'hursday to Dean
Killjoy X. Damper of the Duluth College of Belles Lcttres
and I'emmican.
At <> a.m. he woke, dressed, lit a Marlboro, and went up <>n
the roof of his house to remove the statue of the founder
which had been placed there during the night by high
spirited undergraduates.

At 7 a.m. he lit. a Marlboro and walked briskly to the cam
pus. ( I'he Dean had not been driving his car since it had been
placed on the roof of the girls dormitory by high-spirited
undergraduates.)
At 7:1") a.m. he arrived on campus, lit a Marlboro and
climbed the bell tower to remove hi- secretary who had been
placed there during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.
\t 8 a.m. he reached his office, lit a Marlboro, and met with
K. I'luribus Kwbank, editor of the student newspaper. Young
Kwbank had been writing a series of editorials urging the
I'nited States to annex Canada. When the editorials had
evoked no rcsjwmse, he had taken matters into his own hands.
Accompanied by his society editor and two proofreaders, he
had gone over the bonier and conquered Manitoba. With great
patience and several Marllx>ro Cigarettes, the Dean persuaded
young Kwbank to give Manitoba back. Young Kwbank, how
ever. insisted on keeping Winnipeg.
At 0 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with lloberl
I'enn Sigat'oos, president of the local Sigma Chi chapter, who
came to report that the Deke house had been put on tup of
the Sigma Chi house during the night by high-spirited under
graduates.
At 10 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and went to umpire
an intramural softhall game on the roof of the law school
where the campus baseball diamond had been placed during
the night by high-spirited undergraduates.
At I- noon the Dean had a luncheon meeting with the
prexy, the bursar, and the registrar, at the bottom of the cam
pus swimming jv>ol where the faculty dining room had been
placed during the night bv high-spirited undergraduates,
Marlboros were passed after luncheon, but not lighted, owing
to dampness.
At - p.m., back in his office, the Dean ii* a Marlboro and
received the Canadian Minister of War who said utiles- young
Kwbank gave back Winnipeg, the ('anadian army would march
against the 1 S. immediately. Young Kwbank wa summoned
and agreed to give hack Winnipeg if he could have Moose .law.
The Canadian Minister of War at first refused, but filially con
sented after young Kwbank placed him on the roof of the
metallurgy building.
At p.in. the Dean lit a Marlboro and me! with a delega
tion from the student council who came to present him with
a set of matched luggage in honor of his fifty v< ar- service a

THE DEAN YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUK OWN
Colleges :ire c<implicated :md bewildering places, filled with
complicated and bewildering people. Today let us examine
one of the most complicated and bewildering yet (etching ami
lovable—of all campus figures. I refer, of course, to the dean
of students.
Policeman and confessor, shepherd ami seer, warden and
oracle, proconsul and pal — the dean of students is all of these.
How. then, can we understand him? Well sir, perhaps the bc.-t
way is to take an average day in the life of an average dean.
Here, for example, is what happened last I'hursday to Dean
Killjoy X. Damper of the Duluth College of Belles Lcttres
and I'emmican.
At <> a.m. he woke, dressed, lit a Marlboro, and went up <>n
the roof of his house to remove the statue of the founder
which had been placed there during the night by high
spirited undergraduates.

At 7 a.m. he lit. a Marlboro and walked briskly to the cam
pus. ( I'he Dean had not been driving his car since it had been
placed on the roof of the girls dormitory by high-spirited
undergraduates.)
At 7:1") a.m. he arrived on campus, lit a Marlboro and
climbed the bell tower to remove hi- secretary who had been
placed there during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.
\t 8 a.m. he reached his office, lit a Marlboro, and met with
K. I'luribus Kwbank, editor of the student newspaper. Young
Kwbank had been writing a series of editorials urging the
I'nited States to annex Canada. When the editorials had
evoked no rcsjwmse, he had taken matters into his own hands.
Accompanied by his society editor and two proofreaders, he
had gone over the bonier and conquered Manitoba. With great
patience and several Marllx>ro Cigarettes, the Dean persuaded
young Kwbank to give Manitoba back. Young Kwbank, how
ever. insisted on keeping Winnipeg.
At 0 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with lloberl
I'enn Sigat'oos, president of the local Sigma Chi chapter, who
came to report that the Deke house had been put on tup of
the Sigma Chi house during the night by high-spirited under
graduates.
At 10 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and went to umpire
an intramural softhall game on the roof of the law school
where the campus baseball diamond had been placed during
the night by high-spirited undergraduates.
At I- noon the Dean had a luncheon meeting with the
prexy, the bursar, and the registrar, at the bottom of the cam
pus swimming jv>ol where the faculty dining room had been
placed during the night bv high-spirited undergraduates,
Marlboros were passed after luncheon, but not lighted, owing
to dampness.
At - p.m., back in his office, the Dean ii* a Marlboro and
received the Canadian Minister of War who said utiles- young
Kwbank gave back Winnipeg, the ('anadian army would march
against the 1 S. immediately. Young Kwbank wa summoned
and agreed to give hack Winnipeg if he could have Moose .law.
The Canadian Minister of War at first refused, but filially con
sented after young Kwbank placed him on the roof of the
metallurgy building.
At p.in. the Dean lit a Marlboro and me! with a delega
tion from the student council who came to present him with
a set of matched luggage in honor of his fifty v< ar- service a
dean of students. The Dean promptly packed the luggage illl
all hi- clothing and fled to I'tica, New York, where lie is now
in the aluminum siding game. , m 3 Max ai>wrn»n
