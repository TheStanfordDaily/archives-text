PREPARATIONS are under way for the laying of the mosaic decorated pavement of White Memorial
Plaza, the future center of university activity. A fountain ornamented by a brass statue is to be a
notable feature of this plaza. Construction of the Plaza, now well advanced, is expected to be finished
by the end of Autumn Quarter.
