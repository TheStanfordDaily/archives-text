OXFORD, Miss. The University of Mississippi Tuesday ex
pelled its only Negro student, Cleve McDowell, for carrying a con
cealed weapon to class. The move reinstated total school segrega
tion in the state.
"Ole Miss" officials acted upon the recommendation of a five
member sludent judicial council headed by the son-in-law of Sen.
James O. Eastland.
McDowell was suspended from classes Monday after Sheriff Joe
Ford jailed him on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon, a small
22-caliber pistol. Ford arrested McDowcll as he emerged from a
class.
McDowell, 21. was released from jail under $250 bond an hour
before Tuesday's hearing and appeared before the council, which
is headed by Champ Terney, Eastland's son-in-law.
Chancellor J. D. Williams announced through the university news
service "the expulsion of Cleve McDowell for carrying a concealed
weapon on the campus and in a class room."
Williams said, "the same procedures were followed in this case
that arc followed in all non-academic disciplinary cases at Ole Miss."
McDowell, who was in his dormitory, whan the decision was an
nounced. was not immediately available for comment.
Ala 132 Alabama Negroes Riot â€”State troopers and
local police broke up two anti-segregration demonstrations Tuesday
and jailed 132 Negroes, most of them students. The demonstrations
here got underway just a few hours after President Kennedy's two
racial troubles hooters arrived in Birmingham in an attempt to find
a solution to that city's racial problems.
The main Selma demonstration formed at the First Baptist
Church following a rally that began Tuesday morning and lasted
into the afternoon. The march continued for about a block before
police stepped in. One officer shouted over a bull horn: "Get back,
or we'll put you back!" The demonstrators knelt on the sidewalk,
and then peacefully filed aboard two buses which police had waiting
to transport them to jail.
WASHINGTON- House Passes $11 Killion Tax Cut The House
Wednesday passed the biggest tax cut bill in history- an $11 bil
lion measure that eventually would mean an average saving of 18.8
per cent for America's 50 million individual taxpayers. The vote was
271 to 155. Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon promptly hailed the
House action with a special bow to Rep. Wilbur Mills, D-Ark.. chief
architect of the bill and leader of the administration forces that
pushed it through the House. In Billings, Mont., on his tour of
Western conservation sites, the President obviously was pleased on
learning of the House vote, which he termed "overwhelming." He
hailed the action as a step toward saving the nation from limping
from recession to recession.
The bill was approved by the sizable 116-vote margin after the
House, on the showdown issue, smashed 226 to 199 a GOP attempt
to make the tax cut contingent on a budget commitment by Presi
dent Kennedy to curb federal spending. The action gave the Presi
dent a major legislative victory, by far the biggest of this session
of Congress.
