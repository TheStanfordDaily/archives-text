### BILL SMITH Contributing Editor 
Distribution of The Campus Voice, a Hay Area student protest
magazine, has been suspended by the University administration
pending action by the Student-Faculty Employment Committee
The Campus Voice, published at San Jose State College and dis
tributed at Cal, San Francisco State, Stanford and SJS, is sold for

15 cents under the auspices of H
the Anarchist Caucus of the Poli
tical Union.
Kim Maxwell, writer for The
Voice, said, "It was assumed that
like all other organizations on
campus we would be able to dis
tribute literature."
"We got here at 9:45 on Reg
Day," Maxwell said, "and at 10:00
the police chief came around and i
said that because we were stu
dents and members of the An
archist Caucus we could stay \
there and pass out literature."
AT 11:00 a variety of adminis-;
tration officials interrogated us;
and finally requested the depar-,
ture of the group." Maxwell said. 1
"We were told that this type of
activity had to bo cleared through
various publications media,
namely Student-Faculty Publica
tions Board."
"Tuesday morning the staff in I
SJS decided against directly con
fronting the administration and
therefore didn't try to distribute
Tuesday," Maxwell said.
"A registered letter will be
sent to President Sterling re
questing the right to distribute
The Voice as it would take 1 oo
long through ehanels to obtain
this permission," he said.
"Next week we will attempt to
distribute the next issue of Cam
pus Voice, regardless of Sterling,"
Maxwell said.
MAXWKLL is a graduate of
Stanford, Class of 1963, and is I
now a graduate student at San ;
Jose State. While at Stanford, he
was business manager of the An
archist Caucus.
When contacted by The Daily,
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler, said, "Committee (Student-
Faculty Employment) policy has
been to allow groups to distribute j
on campus but has expected for- j
mal application by the group in ;
Spring for Autumn distribution. |
No application was received from ;
this group last Spring."
"The date of the next Commit
tee meeting is not known at this
time," Winbigler said. But Bar
bara Cochran, Director of Stu
dent Employment, when con
tacted by Kim Maxwell, said that
the Committee would not bo;

meeting before the end of Oeto
ber.
When asked for a temporary
permit to distribute pending ac
tion by the Committee, Winbig
ler said, "Only the Committee lias
that authority and I couldn't take
action since it would prejudice
committee action."
