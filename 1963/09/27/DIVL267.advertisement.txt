Just about the time you figure your Wordmaster should
be running out of ink, unscrew the cap. The new see-^
thru refill says in no uncertain terms that you've got
enough ink left to go on writing for quite a while. You
shouldn't be surprised. For even though Wordmaster
is slim and streamlined, it has a much larger ink capac
ity than ordinary dollar pens. And that makes it just
about the most inexpensive dollar pen around.
By the way... you can get a handsome matching
pencil to go along with your Wordmaster. And that's
only a dollar, too.
