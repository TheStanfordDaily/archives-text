## Sino-Soviet Accusations Fly; Moscow Sounds for Support 
### 
United Press- International
LONDON Diplomatic reports said yesterday Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev appears to have began a campaign for "excommunicat
ing" Communist China from world communism--ideologically, polit
ically and economically.
The mooting of top Communist leaders in Moscow in November
is believed to be the first concrete move towards this aim. But the
Kremlin has begun taking high level soundings among the world
Communist parties to determine their stand. Moscow and Peking
seem hesitant to make their break formal, but according lo the
diplomatic reports each side appears to be seiting the stage for
ultimate rupture and its consequences.
There were two developments along that line today: In Peking,
the government, in the third of a series of official articles on the
dispute, said Khrushchev is following Yugoslav President Tito in the
"slide down the path of revisionism." To list Khrushchev as a fol
lower was an added insult. In Moscow, the Literary Gazette said
the Chinese Communists are evicting longtime residents from the
Sino-Soviet border area and resettling Chinese from central and
eastern regions in their place.
KKNXEDV WARNS INDONESIA
NEW YORK The Kennedy administration, under mounting con
gressional pressure lo end aid to Indonesia, yesterday warned that
country to mend its international manners or risk a cut-off of Amer
ican economic assistance. Secretary of State Dean Rusk, during a
30-minute talk with Foreign Minister Subandrio, was understood to
have emphasized that it was "in the interest of Indonesia itself, as
well as the peace of the area," to end anti-foreign violence around
Jakarta and threats against newly created Malaysia.
The secretary made it clear, according to U.S. authorities, that
continuation of Indonesia's war-like attitude toward Malaysia or
any recurrence of last week's anti-British rioting, burning and loot
ing would most certainly mean an end to U.S. help.
Subandrio was unable to offer any specific assurances beyond
saying that he was certain his government agreed with the U.S.
view that there must be a "peaceful settlement" of the explosive
situation in the area. Subandrio pleaded ignorance of what is actually
going on in his country, pointing out that he had been absent for
some time.
BERLIN GUARANTEE SOUGHT
NEW YORK The United States and Britain agreed yesterday
that any non-aggression pact with the Soviet bloc should include
specific guarantee of the allied position in Red encircled West Berlin.
Secretary of State Dean Rusk and British Foreign Secretary Lord
Home came to this conclusion, diplomatic informants said, during a
lengthy discussion of a broad range of international issues. Topics
included those they expect to discuss at their Saturday meeting with
Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko.
