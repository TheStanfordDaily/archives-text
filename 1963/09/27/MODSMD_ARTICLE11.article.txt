# When Prose Flowed Like Bootleg Rum
## Old Stanford Grad Recalls Lively Era of Newspaperdom 
### BILL MOORE Staff Editor 
ll' a veteran journalist named
Bruce Bliver hact his way, Ameri
can newspapers would be in for
a facelifting.
"What they need is more per
sonality," Bliven explained in a
recent interview at his retirement
home on the Stanford campus.
"They're just not as lively a n d
amusing as they were earlier in
this century, especially in the
Iwent ies."
And he ought to know. As
chief editorial writer and then
managing editor of the now de
funct New York Globe, Bliven
was a part of that colorful era
of Gotham newspaperdom when
prose from the typewriters of the
Hoy wood Brouns, the Alexander
Woolleotts, and the Stanley Walk
ers flowed almost as rapidly as
the bootleg rum.
Bliven still remembers a visit
he made one afternoon to the
home of the famed columnist of
the old New York World.
"Wc had been talking for a
long time in my living room
when Hey wood suddenly looked
at his watch. 'Hey,' he said, '1
better write tomorrow's column.'
lli' vv«• nt lo the next room, and 1

heard nothing but a steady roar
from the typewriter for about
ten minutes. Then ho came out
with a column, and it was a beau
tifully written one.
11 was a man like that who
gave journalism personality."
And it was also a man like
Bliven, whose work in the field
spans five decades. But his
gentle, soft-spoken manner belies
the rugged, lively career he has
led and it is only his white mane
of hair that affords any hint of
I he rigors of his occupation.
Bliven entered journalism while
still a student at Stanford (Class
of '11 i. working part-time as the
"youngest, greenest" cub reporter
on the San Francisco Bulletin.
Fremont Older, the hard-driving
crusader against eoruption in the
city, was publisher at the time.
"I was in the office," recalls
Bliven, "during those dramatic
days when a group of thugs kid
napped him evidently because
he exposed too much for their
health and hid him aboard the
southbound train to Los Angeles.
The gangsters were caught, and
Older was freed, of course. But
it certainly was exciting."
After Stanford. Bliven went to
the University of Southern Cali
fornia to teach for a short time,
then on to New York and the

i Big Time.
: His first .job there was wit h ■
Printer's Ink, an advertising
trade journal, and one of his as- i
1 signments called for an interview ;
with the publisher of the New
York Globe.
"The day after my interview
appeared, the publisher called me
I up and offered me a job as chief
i editorial writer of the paper."
His new boss even allowed him
i to pick any men he wanted to j
work under him. As a result, the
old Globe newsroom almost be
! came an Eastern annex of Stan-
I ford.
'Everyone I selected," Bliven
, slyly admits, "came from the uni-!
; versity. But what I'm proud of [
: is thai all these men under me
I became prominent."
Among them: Maxwell (What
Price Glory?) Anderson, play
wright; Robert Duffus. assistant
editor of the New York Times;
Frank Taylor, free-lance maga
l zinc writer (with more than 300
articles to his credit in the Sat
urday Evening Post alone).
A few months later Bliven was
promoted to managing editor, a
position he held from 1019 to
1923.
Shortly after assuming the job.
he received word that Americans
l were being subjected to outrage

ously cruel treatment in a U.S.
military prison outside Paris.
Bliven wrote a series of scathing
articles on the subject but
showed them to the secretary of
war in Washington before print
ing them.
"I told him how terrible th e
conditions were in this prison;
and I told him if he'd give me his
word he'd clean it up, I wouldn't
print the series. He said, 'Nothing
doing. I won't make any bargain
with any journalist.' "
The articles were run creating
a whale of an uproar in Con
gress. And the head of the prison
was called back and sentenced to
20 years.
In 1923 the Globe folded. Its
Stanford newsmen went en masse
over to the New York Herald.
Except for Bliven, that is, who
became managing editor of the
New Republic, a liberal opinion
journal.
But Bliven refused to spend all
his time in the magazine's New
York office. On one story in 1928
he went to Cuba to interview the
underground revolutionaries who
were opposing a dictatorial re
gime. Not long after he arrived
back in New York, Bliven learned
that his chief informant during
the trip had been slain by the
dictator's secret police

Bliven became editor of the New
Republic in 1930. And the job
wasn't easy.
"We were attacked bitterly by
Communists as well as tho fight.
The communists, who hated the
liberals more than anyone, d i d
everything I hey could to wreck
the magazine."
In the late forties, points out
Bliven, the Communists were
continually attempting to infil
trate the New Republic's offices.
"They would get one member
in without our recognizing him
and then he'd suggest another.
They worked for practically
nothing - and at long hours and
in overtime without demanding
extra pay. But they never influ
enced our editorial policy, al
though occasionally they would
sneak something into the back
part of the magazine that we
could see later was obviously
communist line."
After suffering a heart attack,
Bliven left the New Republic in
1953. Since 193.1 he has lived with
his wife at Kingscote Gardens
mi ihe Stanford campus.
"This university has really
changed from the way il was in
my day,"he says, a trace of sad
nes in his voice.
"I guess that's the way it is
with journalism, loo."
