# Stanford Group Stranded On Davis-Chartered Flight
## 
### JANET ROSS Associate Editor 
A charter flight returning from London with a group of 72
Stanford students and faculty was one of four charter flights ar
| ranged by the World 1 ravel Center of Palo Alto stranded in Now
York this summer. Owner of the World Travel Center, Jery Davis,
I had threatened to sue The Daily for libel last spring when the paper

questioned the charter flights.
The returning charter passen
gers were told they would each
have to pay $59 in extra fare to
continue from New York to Oak
land where their flight origi
nated.
Davis claimed extra costs were
necessary because of a series of
mixups in his 9 charter flights
to Europe this summer. Davis'
office, World Travel Center, was
located at 555 Ramona Street in
Palo Alto until it closed in July
after the charter flight troubles
began.
TIIF DAILY became interested
in the World Travel Center last
April when Dick Falk, operations
manager heard a rumor that Da
vis was mixing charter flights of
different schools. Knowing Stan
ford students were registering
for Davis' flights, then adver
tised in The Daily, and fearing
the "mixed" flights would be
stranded, the business office de
cided to check the rumor.
With The Daily business man
ager Ed Shaw, Falk questioned
Davis and Steve Wordell, s t u
dent organizer of the group. Da
vis said his charter flights were
legally scheduled with Aerovias
Sud American <ASA», a company
with offices in Los Angeles.
Upon contacting CAB, however,
the Board denied receiving an ap
lication from Davis for charter
flights with ASA.
A SPOKESMAN for the In
vestigation Bureau of the CAB
explained to The Daily that a
charter must be submitted and
approved, and an airline mu s t
gel special authority to fly pas
senger carriers over international
waters. Neither the charter nor
the authority had been approved,
according to the spokesman.
The proper petition was finally
filed by Davis and ASA in th e
middle of May, the CAB allow
ing a special late filing.
Publishing an extra edition to
cover the story, The Daily an
nounced that the CAB had dis
missed the application by ASA
as financially questionable.
Before the first story had ap
peared in The Daily, a travel
agent in Berkeley called the Edi
tor and suggested he contact the
Santa Clara County Better Busi
ness Bureau office in San Jose.
Wesley St rouse, manager of
the Bureau, told The Daily he had
been working on similar charter
flight cases and had a thick file
on Davis and his World Travel
Center.
The day after the story ap
peared Davis served legal notice
to The Daily that two statements
of the first article were held to
be libelous.
Till] DAILY RETRACTED the
two statements, one implying Da
vis was withholding funds and
the other implying that passen
gers on his charter flights would
be "bumped."
Davis attracted more publicity
July 1 when his flight stranded
in New York made front page
news in California and the edi
torial page of the New York
Times.
Davis blamed his troubles on a
"breach of contract" by Intercon
tinental U.S. Inc., a Luxembourg
chartered airline, who cancelled
its contract to carry the last of
his 9 groups to Europe. The
other 8 groups flew successfully
with Intercontinental, Davis said.
Intercontinental charged that
the 9th group, Uniled Profes
sional and Education Association
of San Jose, had been formed less
than 6 months earlier and, there
for, under CAB rules did not
qualify for reduced fares.
INTERCCONTINENTAL denied
"breach of contract" saying Da
vis aranged the 9th flight and
sent the group to New York with
out a contract with Intercon
tinental.
The San Jose group left Oak
land June 30 bound for London
and was delayed in New York for
3 days and in Paris on the return
trip because of "charter foul
up."
The money for this flight was
impounded by the New York At
torney General. Davis said he
paid Intercontinental $22:5,400 in
fares for the tours. The airlines
returned $24,300 when it refused
the last tour.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S I
office used more than half the
money to help the stranded tour
ists.
State Deputy Attorney General
Albert N. Harris claimed Davis
knew in advance that European
bound Bay Area tourists would
get stranded in New York City.
He said both Davis and his at
torney Daniel Haley of Sunny
vale were informed 5 days before
the tourists left for New York
that Intercontinental had can
celled its flight.
Haley admitted that Intercon
tinental warned World Travel
Center' they would not fly the Bth
group but said ho sent the pas
sengers to New York to force the
airline's hand.
Haley told the San Francisco
Chronicle that the travelers
"won't have to pay an additional
dime." Those returning, he said,
received vouchers for plane
tickets. According to the Asso
ciated Press, those who decided
to continue after the charter ar
rangements collapsed, paid the
difference between regular rates
and reduced charter rates.
LESS THAN 2 hours after the
San Jose group was stranded, a
group of Hawaii bound vaca
tioners was stranded in Oakland.
The vacationers returned to their
homes after United States Over
seas Airlines refused to honor
their charter arrangement.
Although passengers said
tickets had been purchased
through Suntastic Tours and Aki

Travel Service in San Francisco,
the receipts were from World
Travel Center. Davis is a partner
in Suntastic.
"Foulups" continued when three
Davis chartered planes returning
from Europe the last week in
August were stranded in New
York with a $59 additional cost.
Haley said Davis was broke and
had lost "considerable money" on
his 9 summer flights.
•THIS CHARTER flight mess
has ruined me." Davis told the
I'alo Alto Times. "I'm not going
to reopen in Palo Alto unless I
can get financial backing. I've
spent very single solitary penny
I have trying to get those char
ters overseas and back again."
Deputy Attorney General Har
ris said he was puzzled by Davis'
lack of funds.
According to Harris, Davis'
agency received more than $100,-
000 for the charter flights and
only $225,400 was given to Inter
continental for fares. "We have
never had a satisfactory explana
tion of where this money went.
It certainly would seem enough
to cover all obligations," said
Harris.
DAVIS HAS SAID that he
loaned part of the money to
fnWids in Los Angeles.
When the Stanford charter
flight met the same fate of addi
tional costs, the travelers decided
to make their own arrangements
to get home by regular airlines
or bus rather than pay the extra
$59.
New York Attorney General's
office gave each passenger who
was stranded in New York a
check for $13. The money was
part of the $24,300 that the at
torney genei'al had earlier im
pounded to help the stranded pas
sengers in New York and Paris
when the 9th flight ran aground.
FEDERAL, STATE and county
authorities began looking into
the activities of the World Tra
vel Center after the first plane
was delayed in New York. In San
Francisco, Attorney General
Stanley Mosk ordered a full scale
probe. He said he would wo r k
closely with the New York At
torney General, the FBI and CAB.
Santa Clara County District At
torney said two investigators
were checking Davis' dealings
with students in other states and
his firms' connections with char
ter airlines flying out of New
York City.
Mosk added he intends to dis
cuss tho possibility of criminal
prosecution of Davis and hopes
to draft legislation to require
travel agencies to be licensed and

bonded by the state. He said he
will present the legislation when
the State Legislature convenes in
1964.
Strouse told The Daily yester
day that he is unaware ol Da
vis' present whereabouts. Tli e
Better Business Bureau repre
sentative said that he is some
what disappointed in his contacts
with the local district attorney's
office. "They do nol seem to be
contemplating any action and do
not seem to feel criminal intent
was involved which would war
ant action on their part."
Davis' Travel business "has had
it," according to Strouse. Before
this summer's trouble began,
scheduled charter airlines refused
to do business with him and he
was limited to handling steam
ship tours and non-scheduled air
lines. "Now I would be surprised
if anyone would do business with
him," he said.

their charter arrangement.
Although passengers said
tickets had been purchased
through Suntastic Tours and Aki

Travel Service in San Francisco,
the receipts were from World
Travel Center. Davis is a partner
in Suntastic.
"Foulups" continued when three
Davis chartered planes returning
from Europe the last week in
August were stranded in New
York with a $59 additional cost.
Haley said Davis was broke and
had lost "considerable money" on
his 9 summer flights.
•THIS CHARTER flight mess
has ruined me." Davis told the
I'alo Alto Times. "I'm not going
to reopen in Palo Alto unless I
can get financial backing. I've
spent very single solitary penny
I have trying to get those char
ters overseas and back again."
Deputy Attorney General Har
ris said he was puzzled by Davis'
lack of funds.
According to Harris, Davis'
agency received more than $100,-
000 for the charter flights and
only $225,400 was given to Inter
continental for fares. "We have
never had a satisfactory explana
tion of where this money went.
It certainly would seem enough
to cover all obligations," said
Harris.
DAVIS HAS SAID that he
loaned part of the money to
fnWids in Los Angeles.
When the Stanford charter
flight met the same fate of addi
tional costs, the travelers decided
to make their own arrangements
to get home by regular airlines
or bus rather than pay the extra
$59.
New York Attorney General's
office gave each passenger who
was stranded in New York a
check for $13. The money was
part of the $24,300 that the at
torney genei'al had earlier im
pounded to help the stranded pas
sengers in New York and Paris
when the 9th flight ran aground.
FEDERAL, STATE and county
authorities began looking into
the activities of the World Tra
vel Center after the first plane
was delayed in New York. In San
Francisco, Attorney General
Stanley Mosk ordered a full scale
probe. He said he would wo r k
closely with the New York At
torney General, the FBI and CAB.
Santa Clara County District At
torney said two investigators
were checking Davis' dealings
with students in other states and
his firms' connections with char
ter airlines flying out of New
York City.
Mosk added he intends to dis
cuss tho possibility of criminal
prosecution of Davis and hopes
to draft legislation to require
travel agencies to be licensed and

bonded by the state. He said he
will present the legislation when
the State Legislature convenes in
1964.
Strouse told The Daily yester
day that he is unaware ol Da
vis' present whereabouts. Tli e
Better Business Bureau repre
sentative said that he is some
what disappointed in his contacts
with the local district attorney's
office. "They do nol seem to be
contemplating any action and do
not seem to feel criminal intent
was involved which would war
ant action on their part."
Davis' Travel business "has had
it," according to Strouse. Before
this summer's trouble began,
scheduled charter airlines refused
to do business with him and he
was limited to handling steam
ship tours and non-scheduled air
lines. "Now I would be surprised
if anyone would do business with
him," he said.
A charter flight returning from London with a group of 72
Stanford students and faculty was one of four charter flights ar
| ranged by the World 1 ravel Center of Palo Alto stranded in Now
York this summer. Owner of the World Travel Center, Jery Davis,
I had threatened to sue The Daily for libel last spring when the paper

questioned the charter flights.
The returning charter passen
gers were told they would each
have to pay $59 in extra fare to
continue from New York to Oak
land where their flight origi
nated.
Davis claimed extra costs were
necessary because of a series of
mixups in his 9 charter flights
to Europe this summer. Davis'
office, World Travel Center, was
located at 555 Ramona Street in
Palo Alto until it closed in July
after the charter flight troubles
began.
TIIF DAILY became interested
in the World Travel Center last
April when Dick Falk, operations
manager heard a rumor that Da
vis was mixing charter flights of
different schools. Knowing Stan
ford students were registering
for Davis' flights, then adver
tised in The Daily, and fearing
the "mixed" flights would be
stranded, the business office de
cided to check the rumor.
With The Daily business man
ager Ed Shaw, Falk questioned
Davis and Steve Wordell, s t u
dent organizer of the group. Da
vis said his charter flights were
legally scheduled with Aerovias
Sud American <ASA», a company
with offices in Los Angeles.
Upon contacting CAB, however,
the Board denied receiving an ap
lication from Davis for charter
flights with ASA.
A SPOKESMAN for the In
vestigation Bureau of the CAB
explained to The Daily that a
charter must be submitted and
approved, and an airline mu s t
gel special authority to fly pas
senger carriers over international
waters. Neither the charter nor
the authority had been approved,
according to the spokesman.
The proper petition was finally
filed by Davis and ASA in th e
middle of May, the CAB allow
ing a special late filing.
Publishing an extra edition to
cover the story, The Daily an
nounced that the CAB had dis
missed the application by ASA
as financially questionable.
Before the first story had ap
peared in The Daily, a travel
agent in Berkeley called the Edi
tor and suggested he contact the
Santa Clara County Better Busi
ness Bureau office in San Jose.
Wesley St rouse, manager of
the Bureau, told The Daily he had
been working on similar charter
flight cases and had a thick file
on Davis and his World Travel
Center.
The day after the story ap
peared Davis served legal notice
to The Daily that two statements
of the first article were held to
be libelous.
Till] DAILY RETRACTED the
two statements, one implying Da
vis was withholding funds and
the other implying that passen
gers on his charter flights would
be "bumped."
Davis attracted more publicity
July 1 when his flight stranded
in New York made front page
news in California and the edi
torial page of the New York
Times.
Davis blamed his troubles on a
"breach of contract" by Intercon
tinental U.S. Inc., a Luxembourg
chartered airline, who cancelled
its contract to carry the last of
his 9 groups to Europe. The
other 8 groups flew successfully
with Intercontinental, Davis said.
Intercontinental charged that
the 9th group, Uniled Profes
sional and Education Association
of San Jose, had been formed less
than 6 months earlier and, there
for, under CAB rules did not
qualify for reduced fares.
INTERCCONTINENTAL denied
"breach of contract" saying Da
vis aranged the 9th flight and
sent the group to New York with
out a contract with Intercon
tinental.
The San Jose group left Oak
land June 30 bound for London
and was delayed in New York for
3 days and in Paris on the return
trip because of "charter foul
up."
The money for this flight was
impounded by the New York At
torney General. Davis said he
paid Intercontinental $22:5,400 in
fares for the tours. The airlines
returned $24,300 when it refused
the last tour.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S I
office used more than half the
money to help the stranded tour
ists.
State Deputy Attorney General
Albert N. Harris claimed Davis
knew in advance that European
bound Bay Area tourists would
get stranded in New York City.
He said both Davis and his at
torney Daniel Haley of Sunny
vale were informed 5 days before
the tourists left for New York
that Intercontinental had can
celled its flight.
Haley admitted that Intercon
tinental warned World Travel
Center' they would not fly the Bth
group but said ho sent the pas
sengers to New York to force the
airline's hand.
Haley told the San Francisco
Chronicle that the travelers
"won't have to pay an additional
dime." Those returning, he said,
received vouchers for plane
tickets. According to the Asso
ciated Press, those who decided
to continue after the charter ar
rangements collapsed, paid the
difference between regular rates
and reduced charter rates.
LESS THAN 2 hours after the
San Jose group was stranded, a
group of Hawaii bound vaca
tioners was stranded in Oakland.
The vacationers returned to their
homes after United States Over
seas Airlines refused to honor
their charter arrangement.
Although passengers said
tickets had been purchased
through Suntastic Tours and Aki

as financially questionable.
Before the first story had ap
peared in The Daily, a travel
agent in Berkeley called the Edi
tor and suggested he contact the
Santa Clara County Better Busi
ness Bureau office in San Jose.
Wesley St rouse, manager of
the Bureau, told The Daily he had
been working on similar charter
flight cases and had a thick file
on Davis and his World Travel
Center.
The day after the story ap
peared Davis served legal notice
to The Daily that two statements
of the first article were held to
be libelous.
Till] DAILY RETRACTED the
two statements, one implying Da
vis was withholding funds and
the other implying that passen
gers on his charter flights would
be "bumped."
Davis attracted more publicity
July 1 when his flight stranded
in New York made front page
news in California and the edi
torial page of the New York
Times.
Davis blamed his troubles on a
"breach of contract" by Intercon
tinental U.S. Inc., a Luxembourg
chartered airline, who cancelled
its contract to carry the last of
his 9 groups to Europe. The
other 8 groups flew successfully
with Intercontinental, Davis said.
Intercontinental charged that
the 9th group, Uniled Profes
sional and Education Association
of San Jose, had been formed less
than 6 months earlier and, there
for, under CAB rules did not
qualify for reduced fares.
INTERCCONTINENTAL denied
"breach of contract" saying Da
vis aranged the 9th flight and
sent the group to New York with
out a contract with Intercon
tinental.
The San Jose group left Oak
land June 30 bound for London
and was delayed in New York for
3 days and in Paris on the return
trip because of "charter foul
up."
The money for this flight was
impounded by the New York At
torney General. Davis said he
paid Intercontinental $22:5,400 in
fares for the tours. The airlines
returned $24,300 when it refused
the last tour.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S I
office used more than half the
money to help the stranded tour
ists.
State Deputy Attorney General
Albert N. Harris claimed Davis
knew in advance that European
bound Bay Area tourists would
get stranded in New York City.
He said both Davis and his at
torney Daniel Haley of Sunny
vale were informed 5 days before
the tourists left for New York
that Intercontinental had can
celled its flight.
Haley admitted that Intercon
tinental warned World Travel
Center' they would not fly the Bth
group but said ho sent the pas
sengers to New York to force the
airline's hand.
Haley told the San Francisco
Chronicle that the travelers
"won't have to pay an additional
dime." Those returning, he said,
received vouchers for plane
tickets. According to the Asso
ciated Press, those who decided
to continue after the charter ar
rangements collapsed, paid the
difference between regular rates
and reduced charter rates.
LESS THAN 2 hours after the
San Jose group was stranded, a
group of Hawaii bound vaca
tioners was stranded in Oakland.
The vacationers returned to their
homes after United States Over
seas Airlines refused to honor
their charter arrangement.
Although passengers said
tickets had been purchased
through Suntastic Tours and Aki

Travel Service in San Francisco,
the receipts were from World
Travel Center. Davis is a partner
in Suntastic.
"Foulups" continued when three
Davis chartered planes returning
from Europe the last week in
August were stranded in New
York with a $59 additional cost.
Haley said Davis was broke and
had lost "considerable money" on
his 9 summer flights.
•THIS CHARTER flight mess
has ruined me." Davis told the
I'alo Alto Times. "I'm not going
to reopen in Palo Alto unless I
can get financial backing. I've
spent very single solitary penny
I have trying to get those char
ters overseas and back again."
Deputy Attorney General Har
ris said he was puzzled by Davis'
lack of funds.
According to Harris, Davis'
agency received more than $100,-
000 for the charter flights and
only $225,400 was given to Inter
continental for fares. "We have
never had a satisfactory explana
tion of where this money went.
It certainly would seem enough
to cover all obligations," said
Harris.
DAVIS HAS SAID that he
loaned part of the money to
fnWids in Los Angeles.
When the Stanford charter
flight met the same fate of addi
tional costs, the travelers decided
to make their own arrangements
to get home by regular airlines
or bus rather than pay the extra
$59.
New York Attorney General's
office gave each passenger who
was stranded in New York a
check for $13. The money was
part of the $24,300 that the at
torney genei'al had earlier im
pounded to help the stranded pas
sengers in New York and Paris
when the 9th flight ran aground.
FEDERAL, STATE and county
authorities began looking into
the activities of the World Tra
vel Center after the first plane
was delayed in New York. In San
Francisco, Attorney General
Stanley Mosk ordered a full scale
probe. He said he would wo r k
closely with the New York At
torney General, the FBI and CAB.
Santa Clara County District At
torney said two investigators
were checking Davis' dealings
with students in other states and
his firms' connections with char
ter airlines flying out of New
York City.
Mosk added he intends to dis
cuss tho possibility of criminal
prosecution of Davis and hopes
to draft legislation to require
travel agencies to be licensed and

bonded by the state. He said he
will present the legislation when
the State Legislature convenes in
1964.
Strouse told The Daily yester
day that he is unaware ol Da
vis' present whereabouts. Tli e
Better Business Bureau repre
sentative said that he is some
what disappointed in his contacts
with the local district attorney's
office. "They do nol seem to be
contemplating any action and do
not seem to feel criminal intent
was involved which would war
ant action on their part."
Davis' Travel business "has had
it," according to Strouse. Before
this summer's trouble began,
scheduled charter airlines refused
to do business with him and he
was limited to handling steam
ship tours and non-scheduled air
lines. "Now I would be surprised
if anyone would do business with
him," he said.
A charter flight returning from London with a group of 72
Stanford students and faculty was one of four charter flights ar
| ranged by the World 1 ravel Center of Palo Alto stranded in Now
York this summer. Owner of the World Travel Center, Jery Davis,
I had threatened to sue The Daily for libel last spring when the paper

questioned the charter flights.
The returning charter passen
gers were told they would each
have to pay $59 in extra fare to
continue from New York to Oak
land where their flight origi
nated.
Davis claimed extra costs were
necessary because of a series of
mixups in his 9 charter flights
to Europe this summer. Davis'
office, World Travel Center, was
located at 555 Ramona Street in
Palo Alto until it closed in July
after the charter flight troubles
began.
TIIF DAILY became interested
in the World Travel Center last
April when Dick Falk, operations
manager heard a rumor that Da
vis was mixing charter flights of
different schools. Knowing Stan
ford students were registering
for Davis' flights, then adver
tised in The Daily, and fearing
the "mixed" flights would be
stranded, the business office de
cided to check the rumor.
With The Daily business man
ager Ed Shaw, Falk questioned
Davis and Steve Wordell, s t u
dent organizer of the group. Da
vis said his charter flights were
legally scheduled with Aerovias
Sud American <ASA», a company
with offices in Los Angeles.
Upon contacting CAB, however,
the Board denied receiving an ap
lication from Davis for charter
flights with ASA.
A SPOKESMAN for the In
vestigation Bureau of the CAB
explained to The Daily that a
charter must be submitted and
approved, and an airline mu s t
gel special authority to fly pas
senger carriers over international
waters. Neither the charter nor
the authority had been approved,
according to the spokesman.
The proper petition was finally
filed by Davis and ASA in th e
middle of May, the CAB allow
ing a special late filing.
Publishing an extra edition to
cover the story, The Daily an
nounced that the CAB had dis
missed the application by ASA
as financially questionable.

torney said two investigators
were checking Davis' dealings
with students in other states and
his firms' connections with char
ter airlines flying out of New
York City.
Mosk added he intends to dis
cuss tho possibility of criminal
prosecution of Davis and hopes
to draft legislation to require
travel agencies to be licensed and

bonded by the state. He said he
will present the legislation when
the State Legislature convenes in
1964.
Strouse told The Daily yester
day that he is unaware ol Da

Better Business Bureau repre
sentative said that he is some
what disappointed in his contacts
with the local district attorney's
office. "They do nol seem to be
contemplating any action and do
not seem to feel criminal intent
was involved which would war
ant action on their part."
Davis' Travel business "has had
it," according to Strouse. Before
this summer's trouble began,
scheduled charter airlines refused
to do business with him and he
was limited to handling steam
ship tours and non-scheduled air
lines. "Now I would be surprised
if anyone would do business with
him," he said.
A charter flight returning from London with a group of 72
Stanford students and faculty was one of four charter flights ar
| ranged by the World 1 ravel Center of Palo Alto stranded in Now
York this summer. Owner of the World Travel Center, Jery Davis,
I had threatened to sue The Daily for libel last spring when the paper

questioned the charter flights.
The returning charter passen
gers were told they would each
have to pay $59 in extra fare to
continue from New York to Oak
land where their flight origi
nated.
Davis claimed extra costs were
necessary because of a series of
mixups in his 9 charter flights
to Europe this summer. Davis'
office, World Travel Center, was
located at 555 Ramona Street in
Palo Alto until it closed in July
after the charter flight troubles
began.
TIIF DAILY became interested
in the World Travel Center last
April when Dick Falk, operations
manager heard a rumor that Da
vis was mixing charter flights of
different schools. Knowing Stan
ford students were registering
for Davis' flights, then adver
tised in The Daily, and fearing
the "mixed" flights would be
stranded, the business office de
cided to check the rumor.
With The Daily business man
ager Ed Shaw, Falk questioned
Davis and Steve Wordell, s t u
dent organizer of the group. Da
vis said his charter flights were
legally scheduled with Aerovias
Sud American <ASA», a company
with offices in Los Angeles.
Upon contacting CAB, however,
the Board denied receiving an ap
lication from Davis for charter
flights with ASA.
A SPOKESMAN for the In
vestigation Bureau of the CAB
explained to The Daily that a
charter must be submitted and
approved, and an airline mu s t
gel special authority to fly pas
senger carriers over international
waters. Neither the charter nor
the authority had been approved,
according to the spokesman.
The proper petition was finally
filed by Davis and ASA in th e
middle of May, the CAB allow
ing a special late filing.
Publishing an extra edition to
cover the story, The Daily an
nounced that the CAB had dis
missed the application by ASA
as financially questionable.
Before the first story had ap
peared in The Daily, a travel
agent in Berkeley called the Edi
tor and suggested he contact the
Santa Clara County Better Busi
ness Bureau office in San Jose.
Wesley St rouse, manager of
the Bureau, told The Daily he had
been working on similar charter
flight cases and had a thick file
on Davis and his World Travel
Center.
The day after the story ap
peared Davis served legal notice
to The Daily that two statements
of the first article were held to
be libelous.
Till] DAILY RETRACTED the
two statements, one implying Da
vis was withholding funds and
the other implying that passen
gers on his charter flights would
be "bumped."
Davis attracted more publicity
July 1 when his flight stranded
in New York made front page
news in California and the edi
torial page of the New York
Times.
Davis blamed his troubles on a
"breach of contract" by Intercon
tinental U.S. Inc., a Luxembourg
chartered airline, who cancelled
its contract to carry the last of
his 9 groups to Europe. The
other 8 groups flew successfully
with Intercontinental, Davis said.
Intercontinental charged that
the 9th group, Uniled Profes
sional and Education Association
of San Jose, had been formed less
than 6 months earlier and, there
for, under CAB rules did not
qualify for reduced fares.
INTERCCONTINENTAL denied
"breach of contract" saying Da
vis aranged the 9th flight and
sent the group to New York with
out a contract with Intercon
tinental.
The San Jose group left Oak
land June 30 bound for London
and was delayed in New York for
3 days and in Paris on the return
trip because of "charter foul
up."
The money for this flight was
impounded by the New York At
torney General. Davis said he
paid Intercontinental $22:5,400 in
fares for the tours. The airlines
returned $24,300 when it refused
the last tour.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S I
office used more than half the
money to help the stranded tour
ists.
State Deputy Attorney General
Albert N. Harris claimed Davis
knew in advance that European
bound Bay Area tourists would
get stranded in New York City.
He said both Davis and his at
torney Daniel Haley of Sunny
vale were informed 5 days before
the tourists left for New York
that Intercontinental had can
celled its flight.
Haley admitted that Intercon
tinental warned World Travel
Center' they would not fly the Bth
group but said ho sent the pas
sengers to New York to force the
airline's hand.
Haley told the San Francisco
Chronicle that the travelers
"won't have to pay an additional
dime." Those returning, he said,
received vouchers for plane
tickets. According to the Asso
ciated Press, those who decided
to continue after the charter ar
rangements collapsed, paid the
difference between regular rates
and reduced charter rates.
LESS THAN 2 hours after the
San Jose group was stranded, a
group of Hawaii bound vaca
tioners was stranded in Oakland.
The vacationers returned to their
homes after United States Over
seas Airlines refused to honor
their charter arrangement.
Although passengers said
tickets had been purchased
through Suntastic Tours and Aki

Travel Service in San Francisco,
the receipts were from World
Travel Center. Davis is a partner
in Suntastic.
"Foulups" continued when three
Davis chartered planes returning
from Europe the last week in
August were stranded in New
York with a $59 additional cost.
Haley said Davis was broke and
had lost "considerable money" on
his 9 summer flights.
•THIS CHARTER flight mess
has ruined me." Davis told the
I'alo Alto Times. "I'm not going
to reopen in Palo Alto unless I
can get financial backing. I've
spent very single solitary penny
I have trying to get those char
ters overseas and back again."
Deputy Attorney General Har
ris said he was puzzled by Davis'
lack of funds.
According to Harris, Davis'
agency received more than $100,-
000 for the charter flights and
only $225,400 was given to Inter
continental for fares. "We have
never had a satisfactory explana
tion of where this money went.
It certainly would seem enough
to cover all obligations," said
Harris.
DAVIS HAS SAID that he
loaned part of the money to
fnWids in Los Angeles.
When the Stanford charter
flight met the same fate of addi
tional costs, the travelers decided
to make their own arrangements
to get home by regular airlines
or bus rather than pay the extra
$59.
New York Attorney General's
office gave each passenger who
was stranded in New York a
check for $13. The money was
part of the $24,300 that the at
torney genei'al had earlier im
pounded to help the stranded pas
sengers in New York and Paris
when the 9th flight ran aground.
FEDERAL, STATE and county
authorities began looking into
the activities of the World Tra
vel Center after the first plane
was delayed in New York. In San
Francisco, Attorney General
Stanley Mosk ordered a full scale
probe. He said he would wo r k
closely with the New York At
torney General, the FBI and CAB.
Santa Clara County District At
torney said two investigators
were checking Davis' dealings
with students in other states and
his firms' connections with char
ter airlines flying out of New
York City.
Mosk added he intends to dis
cuss tho possibility of criminal

travel agencies to be licensed and

bonded by the state. He said he
will present the legislation when
the State Legislature convenes in
1964.

money to help the stranded tour
ists.
State Deputy Attorney General
Albert N. Harris claimed Davis
knew in advance that European
bound Bay Area tourists would
get stranded in New York City.
He said both Davis and his at
torney Daniel Haley of Sunny
vale were informed 5 days before
the tourists left for New York
that Intercontinental had can
celled its flight.
Haley admitted that Intercon
tinental warned World Travel
Center' they would not fly the Bth
group but said ho sent the pas
sengers to New York to force the
airline's hand.
Haley told the San Francisco
Chronicle that the travelers
"won't have to pay an additional
dime." Those returning, he said,
received vouchers for plane
tickets. According to the Asso
ciated Press, those who decided
to continue after the charter ar
rangements collapsed, paid the
difference between regular rates
and reduced charter rates.
LESS THAN 2 hours after the
San Jose group was stranded, a
group of Hawaii bound vaca
tioners was stranded in Oakland.
The vacationers returned to their
homes after United States Over
seas Airlines refused to honor
their charter arrangement.
Although passengers said
tickets had been purchased
through Suntastic Tours and Aki

Travel Service in San Francisco,
the receipts were from World
Travel Center. Davis is a partner
in Suntastic.
"Foulups" continued when three
Davis chartered planes returning
from Europe the last week in
August were stranded in New
York with a $59 additional cost.
Haley said Davis was broke and
had lost "considerable money" on
his 9 summer flights.
•THIS CHARTER flight mess
has ruined me." Davis told the
I'alo Alto Times. "I'm not going
to reopen in Palo Alto unless I
can get financial backing. I've
spent very single solitary penny
I have trying to get those char
ters overseas and back again."
Deputy Attorney General Har
ris said he was puzzled by Davis'
lack of funds.
According to Harris, Davis'
agency received more than $100,-
000 for the charter flights and
only $225,400 was given to Inter
continental for fares. "We have
never had a satisfactory explana
tion of where this money went.
It certainly would seem enough
to cover all obligations," said
Harris.
DAVIS HAS SAID that he
loaned part of the money to
fnWids in Los Angeles.
When the Stanford charter
flight met the same fate of addi
tional costs, the travelers decided
to make their own arrangements
to get home by regular airlines
or bus rather than pay the extra
$59.
New York Attorney General's
office gave each passenger who
was stranded in New York a
check for $13. The money was
part of the $24,300 that the at
torney genei'al had earlier im
pounded to help the stranded pas
sengers in New York and Paris
when the 9th flight ran aground.
FEDERAL, STATE and county
authorities began looking into
the activities of the World Tra
vel Center after the first plane
was delayed in New York. In San
Francisco, Attorney General
Stanley Mosk ordered a full scale
probe. He said he would wo r k
closely with the New York At
torney General, the FBI and CAB.
Santa Clara County District At
torney said two investigators
were checking Davis' dealings
with students in other states and
his firms' connections with char
ter airlines flying out of New
York City.
Mosk added he intends to dis
cuss tho possibility of criminal
prosecution of Davis and hopes
to draft legislation to require
travel agencies to be licensed and

bonded by the state. He said he
will present the legislation when
the State Legislature convenes in
1964.
Strouse told The Daily yester
day that he is unaware ol Da
vis' present whereabouts. Tli e
Better Business Bureau repre
sentative said that he is some
what disappointed in his contacts
with the local district attorney's
office. "They do nol seem to be
contemplating any action and do
not seem to feel criminal intent
was involved which would war
ant action on their part."
Davis' Travel business "has had
it," according to Strouse. Before
this summer's trouble began,
scheduled charter airlines refused
to do business with him and he
was limited to handling steam
ship tours and non-scheduled air
lines. "Now I would be surprised
if anyone would do business with
him," he said.
A charter flight returning from London with a group of 72
Stanford students and faculty was one of four charter flights ar
| ranged by the World 1 ravel Center of Palo Alto stranded in Now
York this summer. Owner of the World Travel Center, Jery Davis,
I had threatened to sue The Daily for libel last spring when the paper

questioned the charter flights.
The returning charter passen
gers were told they would each
have to pay $59 in extra fare to
continue from New York to Oak
land where their flight origi
nated.
Davis claimed extra costs were
necessary because of a series of
mixups in his 9 charter flights
to Europe this summer. Davis'
office, World Travel Center, was
located at 555 Ramona Street in
Palo Alto until it closed in July
after the charter flight troubles
began.
TIIF DAILY became interested
in the World Travel Center last
April when Dick Falk, operations
manager heard a rumor that Da
vis was mixing charter flights of
different schools. Knowing Stan
ford students were registering
for Davis' flights, then adver
tised in The Daily, and fearing
the "mixed" flights would be
stranded, the business office de
cided to check the rumor.
With The Daily business man
ager Ed Shaw, Falk questioned
Davis and Steve Wordell, s t u
dent organizer of the group. Da
vis said his charter flights were
legally scheduled with Aerovias
Sud American <ASA», a company
with offices in Los Angeles.
Upon contacting CAB, however,
the Board denied receiving an ap
lication from Davis for charter
flights with ASA.
A SPOKESMAN for the In
vestigation Bureau of the CAB
explained to The Daily that a
charter must be submitted and
approved, and an airline mu s t
gel special authority to fly pas
senger carriers over international
waters. Neither the charter nor
the authority had been approved,
according to the spokesman.
The proper petition was finally
filed by Davis and ASA in th e
middle of May, the CAB allow
ing a special late filing.
Publishing an extra edition to
cover the story, The Daily an
nounced that the CAB had dis
missed the application by ASA
as financially questionable.
Before the first story had ap
peared in The Daily, a travel
agent in Berkeley called the Edi
tor and suggested he contact the
Santa Clara County Better Busi
ness Bureau office in San Jose.
Wesley St rouse, manager of
the Bureau, told The Daily he had
been working on similar charter
flight cases and had a thick file
on Davis and his World Travel
Center.
The day after the story ap
peared Davis served legal notice
to The Daily that two statements
of the first article were held to
be libelous.
Till] DAILY RETRACTED the
two statements, one implying Da
vis was withholding funds and
the other implying that passen
gers on his charter flights would
be "bumped."
Davis attracted more publicity
July 1 when his flight stranded
in New York made front page
news in California and the edi
torial page of the New York
Times.
Davis blamed his troubles on a
"breach of contract" by Intercon
tinental U.S. Inc., a Luxembourg
chartered airline, who cancelled
its contract to carry the last of
his 9 groups to Europe. The
other 8 groups flew successfully
with Intercontinental, Davis said.
Intercontinental charged that
the 9th group, Uniled Profes
sional and Education Association
of San Jose, had been formed less
than 6 months earlier and, there
for, under CAB rules did not
qualify for reduced fares.
INTERCCONTINENTAL denied
"breach of contract" saying Da
vis aranged the 9th flight and
sent the group to New York with
out a contract with Intercon
tinental.
The San Jose group left Oak
land June 30 bound for London
and was delayed in New York for
3 days and in Paris on the return
trip because of "charter foul
up."
The money for this flight was
impounded by the New York At
torney General. Davis said he
paid Intercontinental $22:5,400 in
fares for the tours. The airlines
returned $24,300 when it refused
the last tour.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S I
office used more than half the
money to help the stranded tour
