# Stanford Group Stranded On Davis-Chartered Flight
## 
### JANET ROSS Associate Editor 
A charter flight returning from London with a group of 72
Stanford students and faculty was one of four charter flights ar
| ranged by the World 1 ravel Center of Palo Alto stranded in Now
York this summer. Owner of the World Travel Center, Jery Davis,
I had threatened to sue The Daily for libel last spring when the paper

questioned the charter flights.
The returning charter passen
gers were told they would each
have to pay $59 in extra fare to
continue from New York to Oak
land where their flight origi
nated.
Davis claimed extra costs were
necessary because of a series of
mixups in his 9 charter flights
to Europe this summer. Davis'
office, World Travel Center, was
located at 555 Ramona Street in
Palo Alto until it closed in July
after the charter flight troubles
began.
TIIF DAILY became interested
in the World Travel Center last
April when Dick Falk, operations
manager heard a rumor that Da
vis was mixing charter flights of
different schools. Knowing Stan
ford students were registering
for Davis' flights, then adver
tised in The Daily, and fearing
the "mixed" flights would be
stranded, the business office de
cided to check the rumor.
With The Daily business man
ager Ed Shaw, Falk questioned
Davis and Steve Wordell, s t u
dent organizer of the group. Da
vis said his charter flights were
legally scheduled with Aerovias
Sud American <ASA», a company
with offices in Los Angeles.
Upon contacting CAB, however,
the Board denied receiving an ap
lication from Davis for charter
flights with ASA.
A SPOKESMAN for the In
vestigation Bureau of the CAB
explained to The Daily that a
charter must be submitted and
approved, and an airline mu s t
gel special authority to fly pas
senger carriers over international
waters. Neither the charter nor
the authority had been approved,
according to the spokesman.
The proper petition was finally
filed by Davis and ASA in th e
middle of May, the CAB allow
ing a special late filing.
Publishing an extra edition to
cover the story, The Daily an
nounced that the CAB had dis
missed the application by ASA
as financially questionable.
Before the first story had ap
peared in The Daily, a travel
agent in Berkeley called the Edi
tor and suggested he contact the
Santa Clara County Better Busi
ness Bureau office in San Jose.
Wesley St rouse, manager of
the Bureau, told The Daily he had
been working on similar charter
flight cases and had a thick file
on Davis and his World Travel
Center.
The day after the story ap
peared Davis served legal notice
to The Daily that two statements
of the first article were held to
be libelous.
Till] DAILY RETRACTED the
two statements, one implying Da
vis was withholding funds and
the other implying that passen
gers on his charter flights would
be "bumped."
Davis attracted more publicity
July 1 when his flight stranded
in New York made front page
news in California and the edi
torial page of the New York
Times.
Davis blamed his troubles on a
"breach of contract" by Intercon
tinental U.S. Inc., a Luxembourg
