# Letters to the Editor

### 
Editor, the Daily:
Monday morning I and several
other members of the staff of
The Campus Voice, a bi-weekly
publication dedicated to defend
ing the freedom of the individual
in his right to express himself,
attempted to sell this magazine
on the campus. We were stopped.
We were slopped because we had
ignored a certain amount of red
tape which the university re
quires and were told thai we
would have to wait until the end
of October for a decision as to
whether or not our publication
is to be allowed on campus. Be
fore the date of (his decision we
will publish two more issues
which will have little chance of
reaching the large majority of
the students at Stanford.
It will not perhaps surprise
very many people that the ad
ministration exercises a partial
control on the flow of ideas, but
vhen one can say "yes" or "no"
to any publication, control is
what he is exercising. Purposely
or not, and there is no reason
to suspect maliciouness on their
part, the administration protects
the Stanford student from the
world every time it exercises this

control.
I am not concerned with th e
legality of this form of censor
ship. I couldn't care less about
laws and regulations. Nor am I
concerned with the relatively free
flow of ideas on other campuses,
nor with the morality of this
control. And 1 am not making
a specific plea for The Campus
Voice. What 1 am interested in
is the freedom of thought and
action, which depends on the
free flow of ideas. Ignorant of
alternatives, we do not really
have freedom of choice.
Tilings are pretty good in this
country, on this campus. We are
quite possibly more free here
than in any other part of the
world or at any other period of
time. I would not question the
man who said that. I am not
qualified, and besides, I do not
think it is particularly important.
The question that is important is
this: Could we be more free?
Could ideas flow more freely in
this country, on this campus?
Do we want that? I do. If you
agree, make yourself known.
Write a letter to the dean or The
Daily.

would have to wait until the end
of October for a decision as to
whether or not our publication
is to be allowed on campus. Be
fore the date of (his decision we
will publish two more issues
which will have little chance of
reaching the large majority of
the students at Stanford.
It will not perhaps surprise
very many people that the ad
ministration exercises a partial
control on the flow of ideas, but
vhen one can say "yes" or "no"
to any publication, control is
what he is exercising. Purposely
or not, and there is no reason
to suspect maliciouness on their
part, the administration protects
the Stanford student from the
world every time it exercises this

control.
I am not concerned with th e
legality of this form of censor
ship. I couldn't care less about
laws and regulations. Nor am I
concerned with the relatively free
flow of ideas on other campuses,
nor with the morality of this
control. And 1 am not making
a specific plea for The Campus
Voice. What 1 am interested in
is the freedom of thought and
action, which depends on the
free flow of ideas. Ignorant of
alternatives, we do not really
have freedom of choice.
Tilings are pretty good in this
country, on this campus. We are
quite possibly more free here
than in any other part of the
world or at any other period of
time. I would not question the
man who said that. I am not
qualified, and besides, I do not
think it is particularly important.
The question that is important is
this: Could we be more free?
Could ideas flow more freely in
this country, on this campus?
Do we want that? I do. If you
agree, make yourself known.
Write a letter to the dean or The
Daily.

Monday morning I and several
other members of the staff of
The Campus Voice, a bi-weekly
publication dedicated to defend
ing the freedom of the individual
in his right to express himself,
attempted to sell this magazine
on the campus. We were stopped.
We were slopped because we had
ignored a certain amount of red
tape which the university re
quires and were told thai we
would have to wait until the end
of October for a decision as to
whether or not our publication
is to be allowed on campus. Be
fore the date of (his decision we
