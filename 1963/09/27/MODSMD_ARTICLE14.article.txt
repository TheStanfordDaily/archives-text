## Culture in Bay Area Vital Part of Education 
### VIVI BOZMAN Fine Arts Editor 
Stanford University exists not in a vacuum but rather within a
geographic land range commonly called "The Bay Area." This vague
title symbolizes an area ol vast cultural opportunity ranging from
San Francisco opera to ouldoor art exhibits—all available to Stan
ford students.
"Eight conceptions of the Stage of the Future" is the subject of
the architectural exhibit which opened yesterday at the San Fran
cisco Museum of Art. The project, originally inspired by playwright
Arthur Miller, who criticized Broadway theatres as presenting en
cumbrances to the type of play he wished to write, explores the
possibilities of modern theatres designed to create a "unity of space
between viewers and performers," according to one of the designers,
Pietro Belluschi.
Commenting on the purpose of the exhibit, Peter Larkin, who
composed the display, noted, ". . . Lumber is never a substitute for
ideals."
ANOTHER SAN FRANCISCO experiment in theatre marks not
a projection of the future but a return to a classic theatre form,
commedia dell'arte. The San Francisco Mime Troupe is a nomadic
group—"lf the people won't come to the theatre, we'll bring the
theatre to them," states director R. G. Davis. The actors, costumed
in 16th century dress, offer semi-improvised popular comedies. Their
characters are stereotypes; their purpose is mimicry of the manners
and morals of our society.
Poet Kenneth Rexroth has called the troupe an example of the
very alive cultural conscience of San Francisco. The group is now
performing at the Mime Studio-Theatre at 3450 20th Street (Capp
off Mission).
A Saturday afternoon walking tour of the city should include
not only the traditional North Beach and Chinatown but also the
wealth of small, private art gallerys, which are open to the public
and offer an opportunity to see the work of new, young artists.
The great variety of themes and artists includes lithographs in
Biblical themes by Marc Chagall at the Maxwell Gallery, 551 Sutter
Street; original lithographs of contemporary European artists and
sculpture in wood and stone by Roy Overstreet at the Lacke Gal
lery, 2557 California Street; "The Human Scene," a collection of
paintings, and ceramics by Avrum Rubinstein at the San Francisco
Public Library, main branch.
"Gold of the Andres, Treasure of Peru" is the title of the exhibit
now at the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in Golden Gate Park
Over 500 Peruvian gold objects dating from 200 B.C. to the 16th
century are featured.
A NEW EXPERIENCE for most students whose involvement has
been confined to the museum is the opening of a show at an art
gallery, where dilettantes, collectors, artists, and "friends of the
arts" gather. The Batman Gallery, 2222 Fillmore Strret, will hold
a reception for artist Bill Risdon on Tuesday, October 1, at 8 p.m.
Risdon's work includes not only oil paintings and sculpture, but
also works done in the unique media of musique concrete and elec
tronic machine painting. Currently director of visual research at
Electronic Creative Production, Risdon includes an academic touch
in his work.
On Sunday the San Francisco Opera will present "La Sonnam
bula" at 2 p.m. at the War Memorial Opera House.
For those unable to leave the campus, KPFA, a non-profit,
listener-sponsored FM radio station, offers some consolation: "The
Four Seasons," by Antonio Vivialdi, tonight at 8 p.m., performed by
Kard Munchinger and the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra; at 10:30
"Joseph Krips Conducts Mozart." Academic freedom from the stand
point of the conservative professor and the limitations he faces will
be discussed on KPFA at 8:45 tonight by Dr. Russell Kirk, author
and visiting professor of politics this summer at Los Angeles State
College.
All these activities—not simply classes on quad, but culture on
the Bay—comprise The University.

sculpture in wood and stone by Roy Overstreet at the Lacke Gal
lery, 2557 California Street; "The Human Scene," a collection of
paintings, and ceramics by Avrum Rubinstein at the San Francisco
Public Library, main branch.
"Gold of the Andres, Treasure of Peru" is the title of the exhibit
now at the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in Golden Gate Park
Over 500 Peruvian gold objects dating from 200 B.C. to the 16th
century are featured.
A NEW EXPERIENCE for most students whose involvement has
been confined to the museum is the opening of a show at an art
gallery, where dilettantes, collectors, artists, and "friends of the
arts" gather. The Batman Gallery, 2222 Fillmore Strret, will hold
a reception for artist Bill Risdon on Tuesday, October 1, at 8 p.m.
Risdon's work includes not only oil paintings and sculpture, but
also works done in the unique media of musique concrete and elec
tronic machine painting. Currently director of visual research at
Electronic Creative Production, Risdon includes an academic touch
in his work.
On Sunday the San Francisco Opera will present "La Sonnam
bula" at 2 p.m. at the War Memorial Opera House.
For those unable to leave the campus, KPFA, a non-profit,
listener-sponsored FM radio station, offers some consolation: "The
Four Seasons," by Antonio Vivialdi, tonight at 8 p.m., performed by
Kard Munchinger and the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra; at 10:30
"Joseph Krips Conducts Mozart." Academic freedom from the stand
point of the conservative professor and the limitations he faces will
be discussed on KPFA at 8:45 tonight by Dr. Russell Kirk, author
and visiting professor of politics this summer at Los Angeles State
College.
All these activities—not simply classes on quad, but culture on
the Bay—comprise The University.
Stanford University exists not in a vacuum but rather within a
geographic land range commonly called "The Bay Area." This vague
title symbolizes an area ol vast cultural opportunity ranging from
San Francisco opera to ouldoor art exhibits—all available to Stan
ford students.
"Eight conceptions of the Stage of the Future" is the subject of
the architectural exhibit which opened yesterday at the San Fran
cisco Museum of Art. The project, originally inspired by playwright
Arthur Miller, who criticized Broadway theatres as presenting en
cumbrances to the type of play he wished to write, explores the
possibilities of modern theatres designed to create a "unity of space
between viewers and performers," according to one of the designers,
Pietro Belluschi.
Commenting on the purpose of the exhibit, Peter Larkin, who
composed the display, noted, ". . . Lumber is never a substitute for
ideals."
ANOTHER SAN FRANCISCO experiment in theatre marks not
a projection of the future but a return to a classic theatre form,
commedia dell'arte. The San Francisco Mime Troupe is a nomadic
group—"lf the people won't come to the theatre, we'll bring the
theatre to them," states director R. G. Davis. The actors, costumed
in 16th century dress, offer semi-improvised popular comedies. Their
characters are stereotypes; their purpose is mimicry of the manners
and morals of our society.
Poet Kenneth Rexroth has called the troupe an example of the
very alive cultural conscience of San Francisco. The group is now
performing at the Mime Studio-Theatre at 3450 20th Street (Capp
off Mission).
A Saturday afternoon walking tour of the city should include
not only the traditional North Beach and Chinatown but also the
wealth of small, private art gallerys, which are open to the public
and offer an opportunity to see the work of new, young artists.
The great variety of themes and artists includes lithographs in
Biblical themes by Marc Chagall at the Maxwell Gallery, 551 Sutter
Street; original lithographs of contemporary European artists and
sculpture in wood and stone by Roy Overstreet at the Lacke Gal
lery, 2557 California Street; "The Human Scene," a collection of
