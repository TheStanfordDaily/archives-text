## Goldwater Succumbing to Party Process, 'Moderation' 
### 
The peculiar genius of American politics, which is to draw candi
dates away from extreme positions, is now working on Senator
Goldwater. Like every other man who has over taken himself
seriously as a Presidential candidate, the senator is now engaged in
remodeling his ideas, in moving away from the far right and toward
the more moderate center.
A striking example of this retreat from the extreme is his view
of the graduated income tax. He still believes, as he said in 1960,
that "the graduated income tax is a confiscatory tax" and that we
should "abolish the graduated features of our tax laws" (the bigger
the income the higher the rate of taxation), "and the sooner we get
at the job, the better."
But now in 1963 he is telling the editors of U.S. News & World
Report that "I won't go that far, but I'm opposed to the theory.
I'd like to see some other suggestions made in the whole field."
Like every other politician who has to handle a hot potato, Senator
Goldwater as a candidate would like to have the tax code restudied
by an assembly of "knowledgeable" people.
Between abolishing the graduated income tax and studying it,
there is all the difference between a radical and an extremly cau
tious moderate. The effects of this suction toward the center are
breaking out all over the original extremist Goldwater views. Thus
he has declared himself opposed to all federal programs in the field
of social welfare, education, public power, agriculture, public hous
ing and urban renewal. But now it appears the welfare state is to
be repealed, but only very slowly.
This fudging process is characteristic of serious candidates for
election. I say serious candidates. For the fringe candidates—So
cialists, Prohibitionists, Vegetarians—are able to keep their views
sharp and unfudged, because they are not really running for office,
but are talking to influence opinion. But Senator Goldwater, who
is now in big league politics, is well along on the road where he will
sound less and less like Goldwater and more and more like Eisen
hower. -If he is to be nominated and is to stand any chance of elec
tion, he must make himself acceptable to the preponderant mass of
the voters. They are not on the right and they are not on the left,
but around the center, a little but not much to the right of it and
a little but not much to the left of it.
What makes this suction toward the moderate center so impres
sive is that Senator Goldwater is opposed to it. He thinks it is
wrong in principle, and he thinks it is bad politics for the Republi
can Party. Yet, in spite of himself, he is being drawn into modera
tion. Thus he is not going to ask for the repeal of the graduated
income tax. He is not going to ask for the repeal of Social Secur
ity. He is not going to oust Castro by sending American troops to
invade Cuba.
And before long we shall see that while he believes in leaving
the racial question to the separate states, somehow he is not going
to be in favor of leaving it to Governor Wallace-
He is doomed to suffer this evolution as the nominating conven
tion draws nearer. It is wrong, but it is going to happen. He says
it is the duty of the Republican Party to cease to be "Little Sir
Echo" to the Democrats. The party should offer the country a clear
choice between right and wrong, good and evil, socialism and in
dividualism. Moreover, it is bad politics. The party must differenti
ate itself distinctly and sharply from the Democrats for there is, he
fondly believes, a great majority in the country which is now divided
between the two parties. This great majority will vote Republican
if the choice is clear and absolute.
Yet, we know that when the election comes, the choice will not be
clear- and absolute. Even if Senator Goldwater is nominated, the
Eisenhower Republicans will tie him to a platform which rejects
the extreme positions ol the earlier Goldwater. Why? Because
Senator Goldwater is wrong about the fundamental facts. The great
majority of Americans are not on the extremes, but in the center,
and that is why every serious candidate must adapt himself to the
moderation of the center.
This peculiar condition is the basis of the genius of the American
political system. It forces the people into a consensus even though
they are divided. I would say that this is the inner mechanism which
has enabled the American nation to do what has not been done else
where at any time—to preserve personal liberty under Democratic
govrnment on a continental scale. There was one terrible exception
when the system broke down into a civil war over the issue of
slavery. But except for that failure, of which we are still suffering
the consequences, the system has worked exceedingly well.
Why is it that the making of a consensus when the voters are
divided is of paramount importance to Ihe operation of a free and
democratic government? Because the inner secret of orderly gov
ernment is that the minority can and will accept peaceably and with
good will the verdict of the majority. By American standards, any
one who refuses to do that, who advocates disobedience, nullifica
tion, secession, is an extremist and belongs to the far right or the
far left.
Senator Goldwater, who is not a fanatic of the extreme, but an
ambitious politician is now in the process of reshaping himself for
the political realities of this country. It is interesting to watch him
and comforting to think that the system is working so well.

should "abolish the graduated features of our tax laws" (the bigger
the income the higher the rate of taxation), "and the sooner we get
at the job, the better."
But now in 1963 he is telling the editors of U.S. News & World
Report that "I won't go that far, but I'm opposed to the theory.
I'd like to see some other suggestions made in the whole field."
Like every other politician who has to handle a hot potato, Senator
Goldwater as a candidate would like to have the tax code restudied
by an assembly of "knowledgeable" people.
Between abolishing the graduated income tax and studying it,
there is all the difference between a radical and an extremly cau
tious moderate. The effects of this suction toward the center are
breaking out all over the original extremist Goldwater views. Thus
he has declared himself opposed to all federal programs in the field
of social welfare, education, public power, agriculture, public hous
ing and urban renewal. But now it appears the welfare state is to
be repealed, but only very slowly.
This fudging process is characteristic of serious candidates for
election. I say serious candidates. For the fringe candidates—So
cialists, Prohibitionists, Vegetarians—are able to keep their views
sharp and unfudged, because they are not really running for office,
but are talking to influence opinion. But Senator Goldwater, who
is now in big league politics, is well along on the road where he will
sound less and less like Goldwater and more and more like Eisen
hower. -If he is to be nominated and is to stand any chance of elec
tion, he must make himself acceptable to the preponderant mass of
the voters. They are not on the right and they are not on the left,
but around the center, a little but not much to the right of it and
a little but not much to the left of it.
What makes this suction toward the moderate center so impres
sive is that Senator Goldwater is opposed to it. He thinks it is
wrong in principle, and he thinks it is bad politics for the Republi
can Party. Yet, in spite of himself, he is being drawn into modera
tion. Thus he is not going to ask for the repeal of the graduated
income tax. He is not going to ask for the repeal of Social Secur
ity. He is not going to oust Castro by sending American troops to
invade Cuba.
And before long we shall see that while he believes in leaving
the racial question to the separate states, somehow he is not going
to be in favor of leaving it to Governor Wallace-
He is doomed to suffer this evolution as the nominating conven
tion draws nearer. It is wrong, but it is going to happen. He says
it is the duty of the Republican Party to cease to be "Little Sir
Echo" to the Democrats. The party should offer the country a clear
choice between right and wrong, good and evil, socialism and in
dividualism. Moreover, it is bad politics. The party must differenti
ate itself distinctly and sharply from the Democrats for there is, he
fondly believes, a great majority in the country which is now divided
between the two parties. This great majority will vote Republican
if the choice is clear and absolute.
Yet, we know that when the election comes, the choice will not be
clear- and absolute. Even if Senator Goldwater is nominated, the
Eisenhower Republicans will tie him to a platform which rejects
the extreme positions ol the earlier Goldwater. Why? Because
Senator Goldwater is wrong about the fundamental facts. The great
majority of Americans are not on the extremes, but in the center,
and that is why every serious candidate must adapt himself to the
moderation of the center.
This peculiar condition is the basis of the genius of the American
political system. It forces the people into a consensus even though
they are divided. I would say that this is the inner mechanism which
has enabled the American nation to do what has not been done else
where at any time—to preserve personal liberty under Democratic
govrnment on a continental scale. There was one terrible exception
when the system broke down into a civil war over the issue of
slavery. But except for that failure, of which we are still suffering
the consequences, the system has worked exceedingly well.
Why is it that the making of a consensus when the voters are
divided is of paramount importance to Ihe operation of a free and
democratic government? Because the inner secret of orderly gov
ernment is that the minority can and will accept peaceably and with
good will the verdict of the majority. By American standards, any
one who refuses to do that, who advocates disobedience, nullifica
tion, secession, is an extremist and belongs to the far right or the
far left.
Senator Goldwater, who is not a fanatic of the extreme, but an
ambitious politician is now in the process of reshaping himself for
the political realities of this country. It is interesting to watch him
and comforting to think that the system is working so well.

The peculiar genius of American politics, which is to draw candi

Goldwater. Like every other man who has over taken himself
seriously as a Presidential candidate, the senator is now engaged in
remodeling his ideas, in moving away from the far right and toward
the more moderate center.

Goldwater as a candidate would like to have the tax code restudied
by an assembly of "knowledgeable" people.
Between abolishing the graduated income tax and studying it,
there is all the difference between a radical and an extremly cau
tious moderate. The effects of this suction toward the center are
breaking out all over the original extremist Goldwater views. Thus
he has declared himself opposed to all federal programs in the field
of social welfare, education, public power, agriculture, public hous
ing and urban renewal. But now it appears the welfare state is to
be repealed, but only very slowly.
This fudging process is characteristic of serious candidates for
election. I say serious candidates. For the fringe candidates—So
cialists, Prohibitionists, Vegetarians—are able to keep their views
sharp and unfudged, because they are not really running for office,
but are talking to influence opinion. But Senator Goldwater, who
is now in big league politics, is well along on the road where he will
sound less and less like Goldwater and more and more like Eisen
hower. -If he is to be nominated and is to stand any chance of elec
tion, he must make himself acceptable to the preponderant mass of
the voters. They are not on the right and they are not on the left,
but around the center, a little but not much to the right of it and
a little but not much to the left of it.
What makes this suction toward the moderate center so impres
sive is that Senator Goldwater is opposed to it. He thinks it is
wrong in principle, and he thinks it is bad politics for the Republi
can Party. Yet, in spite of himself, he is being drawn into modera
tion. Thus he is not going to ask for the repeal of the graduated
income tax. He is not going to ask for the repeal of Social Secur
ity. He is not going to oust Castro by sending American troops to
invade Cuba.
And before long we shall see that while he believes in leaving
the racial question to the separate states, somehow he is not going
to be in favor of leaving it to Governor Wallace-
He is doomed to suffer this evolution as the nominating conven
tion draws nearer. It is wrong, but it is going to happen. He says
it is the duty of the Republican Party to cease to be "Little Sir
Echo" to the Democrats. The party should offer the country a clear
choice between right and wrong, good and evil, socialism and in
dividualism. Moreover, it is bad politics. The party must differenti
ate itself distinctly and sharply from the Democrats for there is, he
fondly believes, a great majority in the country which is now divided
between the two parties. This great majority will vote Republican
if the choice is clear and absolute.
Yet, we know that when the election comes, the choice will not be
clear- and absolute. Even if Senator Goldwater is nominated, the
Eisenhower Republicans will tie him to a platform which rejects
the extreme positions ol the earlier Goldwater. Why? Because
Senator Goldwater is wrong about the fundamental facts. The great
majority of Americans are not on the extremes, but in the center,
and that is why every serious candidate must adapt himself to the
moderation of the center.
This peculiar condition is the basis of the genius of the American
political system. It forces the people into a consensus even though
they are divided. I would say that this is the inner mechanism which
has enabled the American nation to do what has not been done else
where at any time—to preserve personal liberty under Democratic
govrnment on a continental scale. There was one terrible exception
when the system broke down into a civil war over the issue of
slavery. But except for that failure, of which we are still suffering
the consequences, the system has worked exceedingly well.
Why is it that the making of a consensus when the voters are
divided is of paramount importance to Ihe operation of a free and
democratic government? Because the inner secret of orderly gov
ernment is that the minority can and will accept peaceably and with
good will the verdict of the majority. By American standards, any
one who refuses to do that, who advocates disobedience, nullifica
tion, secession, is an extremist and belongs to the far right or the
far left.
Senator Goldwater, who is not a fanatic of the extreme, but an
ambitious politician is now in the process of reshaping himself for
the political realities of this country. It is interesting to watch him
and comforting to think that the system is working so well.

The peculiar genius of American politics, which is to draw candi
dates away from extreme positions, is now working on Senator
Goldwater. Like every other man who has over taken himself
seriously as a Presidential candidate, the senator is now engaged in
remodeling his ideas, in moving away from the far right and toward
the more moderate center.
A striking example of this retreat from the extreme is his view
of the graduated income tax. He still believes, as he said in 1960,
that "the graduated income tax is a confiscatory tax" and that we
should "abolish the graduated features of our tax laws" (the bigger
the income the higher the rate of taxation), "and the sooner we get
at the job, the better."
But now in 1963 he is telling the editors of U.S. News & World
Report that "I won't go that far, but I'm opposed to the theory.
I'd like to see some other suggestions made in the whole field."
