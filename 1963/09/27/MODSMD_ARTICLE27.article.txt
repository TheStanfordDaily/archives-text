Coach John Ralston expects to
make only fine change in the
starting lineup that romped past
San Jose State last week for Sat-

KCBS will broadcast tomor
row's game with Oregon I 'gin
ning - at 1 The game will he
preceded by a pre-game Pig
skin Powwow show beginning
at 1:0. r Â» and will he followed by
the Fifth Quarter, a scoreboard
show.

urday's revealing contest with
Oregon, set to begin at 1:30 p.m.
in Stanford Stadium.
Dan Conaway, fourth string
fullback before last week's game,
will start on the Red unit this
week. Ralston indicated that the
shakeup at fullback was caused
by the injury to Glenn Myers,
who will bo sidelined for one or
two more weeks.
Til 10 COACH asserted, how
ever, that Ken Babajian will see
plenty of action on offense with
Tony DeLellis getting in plenty
of time on defense.
The remainder of the starting
lineup will include Frank Pati
tucci and Chuck McCormick at

ends, A 1 Hildebrand and Bob
Nichols at tackles. Jack Chappie
and John Wilbur at guards, and
Ail-American candidate Marv
Harris at center.
Starting in the backfield will
be Clark Weaver, whose only two
passes last week went for touch
downs. at quarterback; Dick
Ragsdale and Steve Thurlow, 1-2
in the AAWU rushing statistics,
at the halfbacks, and Conaway at
fullback.
One surprising strong point
Saturday was the kicking of jun
ior Braden Beck who was success-

ful on all throe extra points he
attempted.
Preparing for the Oregon game,
Ralston has concentrated more
on stopping the Duck's great
halfback, Mel Renfro, then on
anyone else. But Renfro is not
the only threat in Oregon's "Fire
house Four" backfield.
Three of the backfield, Ren
fro, Larry Hill, and quarterback
Bob Berry, started last season as
the Webfoots blasted their way
to a 6-3-1 mark which included
wins over Rice, Air Force and
Stanford. Lu Bain, this year's
starting fullback, understudied
Renfro at halfback last year.
RALSTON calls the Duck four
some "as fine a backfield as there

is in the country. They all can i
fly," he says, "even the fullback,
Bain, runs a 9.8 hundred."
Stanford will be out to break
a six game losing streak with the
Ducks. They have not beaten
Oregon at Stanford Stadium
since 195.">.
Oregon comes into the game
a one-point favorite. This should
not worry the Indians too much
since last week at Portland, t he
Ducks were favored by 7 points
over Penn State but lost 17 to 7.
Stanford beat San Jose State
last week, 29-13, as Ragsdale set
a new scoring record with four
touchdowns. He was named the
AAWU back of the week for his
performance.
