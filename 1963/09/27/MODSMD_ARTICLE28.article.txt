# Powerful Water Poloists Host Alumni Tomorrow
## 
### JOHN CALMORE 
Stanford water polo fans will
get their first view of the team,
tomorrow at 11 p.m. when the
Indians play their annual Alumni
game. The Indians this year could
be one of the best ever at Stan
ford and almost certainly will be
one of the top teams in the coun
try.
Coach Jim Gaughran said of
this year's team, "We have a very
good chance to move up to the
top, although we play the na
tion's number one and number
two teams of 19(32."
Last year Stanford was rated
third in the nation, following Long
Beach State and USC. The In
dians play both these teams at
Stanford this year.
The Tribe splashers have 11
lettermen back, three of them
All-AAWU selections. In addition,
two top junior college transfers,
Bill Ready and Art Snyder, have
been added to the team.
Marty Hull, one of the three
All-AAWU returnees, was top

scorer in the Pan-American
Games last year. The other two
are goalio George Stransky and
Pete Pettigrew, twice an All-
AAWU center-back.
At present the starting lineup
has Stansky at goalie. Hull, Ron
Kovas, and Bill Lorton as for
wards, and Don Buehler, Ready,
and Pettigrew as backs. Brian
Beck will also be used consider
ably in reserve.
While the Alumni lineup has
not yet been set, several Stanford
greats will see action tomorrow.
Among those who will play are
George Harrison, a former swim
ming star and a starter for the
San Francisco Olympic Club the
last two years; Alike Conn, a
starter on last year's varsity; Ash
ley Jones, now coaching at Ala
meda; and Irwin Johnson captain
of the 1955 water polo team.
The Indians face San Jose
State on October 5, in their next
home game. All home games are
held at, Encina Pool. , , â– , / .
