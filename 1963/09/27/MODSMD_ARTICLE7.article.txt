# Diebenkorn Exhibits Paintings at de Young
## 
### 
Richard Diebenkorn, "Artist in
Residence" at Stanford this year,
recently hailed as "perhaps the
foremost western artist to come
to maturity in the last ten years,"
is currently exhibiting a selection
of his most recent canvases at the
M. H. de Young Memorial Mu
seum in San Francisco through
October 7.
DIIOIiENKOKN, a member of
the faculty of the San Francisco
Art Institute, will be at work in
his studio in Stanford's Old
Union during the 1963-64 acad
emic year. "This living art expe
rience will be exciting," com
mented Professor Daniel M. Men
delowitz of the Art Department.
Mendelowitz explained, "Stu
dents will be able to observe stu
dio practice; the development of a
work of art; have an opportunity
to question and discuss all phases
of the artist's work and their own;
and to experience art within their
own culture."
A STANFORD GRADUATE in
1949, Diebenkorn is known inter
nationally not only for his own
distinctive qualities, hut also for
his contribution to the creation of
a new west coast style of neo
realism based upon the human
figure in landscape known as "fig
urative painting."
After some vears of commit

| ment to "abstract expressionism,"
j Diebenkorn in the middle 1930 s,
along with two other Bay Area
I painters, Elmer Bischoef and the
I late David Park, turned from non
| objective painting. Their new
i paintings, though still deeply in
| volved with form, vivid color con
trasts and the "painterly qual
ities" that is, the rough brush
work and the thick overlaid paint
| surfaces, characteristic of expres
j sionism â€” gave evidence of a
j more naturalistic approach.
THE MAGAZINE HORIZON
j in an article devoted to the work
of these three artists entitled
"Figures to the Fore" states that
I they are using recognizable fig
' ures in the pictures as a kind of
! catalyst to make the colors and
; shapes coalesce into firm relation
| ships.
Relative to his concern with the
i human figure, Diebenkorn him
i self in 1937 was quoted as say
j ing, "It is the opposition and in
| ter-relationship of environment
with its particular attitude and
the figure with the distinct and
| concentrated psychology which
; concerns me at present. I find that
this 'person' I deal with creates
a surrounding which in turn mod-
I ifies, changes, sometimes engulfs
him."
