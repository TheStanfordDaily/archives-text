# Official Statement
## Wedin Defends Open Forum Against 'Campus Voice' Ban 
### 
The following' is ASSU President Bud YVedin's official state
ment 011 the "Campus Voice" controversy:
There are several factors that should be considered in the recent
suspension of "The Campus Voice" from distribution on the campus. !
It can clearly he argued in personal terms that the tone and content j
of parts of the magazine reflect a certain degree of literary irespon-!
sibility. Ii can also be clearly demonstrated that the distributors
of the magazine had not received official permission to sell their
publication, and, in fact, this was the rationale behind its withdrawal'
by university administrators.
But even supposing the magazine itself were not worthy of read- |
ing, a personal evaluation on its "responsibility of merit" is by itself !
not a justification for suspension. If "The Campus Voice" were an !
official ASSU or University publication, it would have a direct ;
obligation and responsibility to the university. Since, however, it is I
published independently in San Jose, the question of whether it can i
be distributed does not depend on whether such attempts are made
within a university community or without.
Rather, the determining factor should be no more than its ac- !
ceptability under the laws. It would seem, furthermore, that moit? i
liberty should be allowed for optimum expression of ideas within a
university than without, since this is part of a university's very
essence.
THE QUESTION IS not one of defending the literary merits of
the magazine, but rather one of defending the right of any group j
or student to publish or sell a magazine on the Stanford campus. :
ASSU's responsibility is to defend this right, certainly not to en
dorse the magazine itself.
In this regard I would hope that the university would encourage
maximum ease and opportunity for distribution, publication, and I
sales of any literary publication on the Stanford campus, realizing
that such an open forum policy is essential for maintaining a vibrant
intellectual atmosphere at Stanford.
THE "CAMPUS VOICE" is a San Jose publication which was
distributed for three hours on registration day. Monday, Sept. 23.
Dean of Students Donald H. Winbigler commented: "Committee
(Student Faculty Employment) policy has been to allow students
to distribute on campus but has expected formal application by any '
group in Spring for Autumn distribution. No application was re-1
ceived from this group last spring."

essence.
THE QUESTION IS not one of defending the literary merits of
the magazine, but rather one of defending the right of any group j
or student to publish or sell a magazine on the Stanford campus. :
ASSU's responsibility is to defend this right, certainly not to en
dorse the magazine itself.
In this regard I would hope that the university would encourage
maximum ease and opportunity for distribution, publication, and I
sales of any literary publication on the Stanford campus, realizing
that such an open forum policy is essential for maintaining a vibrant
intellectual atmosphere at Stanford.
THE "CAMPUS VOICE" is a San Jose publication which was
distributed for three hours on registration day. Monday, Sept. 23.
Dean of Students Donald H. Winbigler commented: "Committee
(Student Faculty Employment) policy has been to allow students
to distribute on campus but has expected formal application by any '
group in Spring for Autumn distribution. No application was re-1
ceived from this group last spring."
The following' is ASSU President Bud YVedin's official state
ment 011 the "Campus Voice" controversy:
There are several factors that should be considered in the recent
suspension of "The Campus Voice" from distribution on the campus. !
It can clearly he argued in personal terms that the tone and content j
of parts of the magazine reflect a certain degree of literary irespon-!
sibility. Ii can also be clearly demonstrated that the distributors
of the magazine had not received official permission to sell their
publication, and, in fact, this was the rationale behind its withdrawal'
by university administrators.
But even supposing the magazine itself were not worthy of read- |
ing, a personal evaluation on its "responsibility of merit" is by itself !
not a justification for suspension. If "The Campus Voice" were an !
official ASSU or University publication, it would have a direct ;
obligation and responsibility to the university. Since, however, it is I
published independently in San Jose, the question of whether it can i
be distributed does not depend on whether such attempts are made
within a university community or without.
Rather, the determining factor should be no more than its ac- !
ceptability under the laws. It would seem, furthermore, that moit? i
liberty should be allowed for optimum expression of ideas within a
university than without, since this is part of a university's very
essence.
