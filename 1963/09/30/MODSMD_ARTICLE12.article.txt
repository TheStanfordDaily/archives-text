# 'Campus Voice' Battle Wastes Valuable Time
## 
### 
The current controversy surrounding the barring of distribu
tion oI "The Campus Voice" is somewhat akin to the Pro
fumo scandal in England: with so many problems of import
waiting to be solved, leaders have worked themselves into a
position of fighting a ludicrous battle.
"The Campus Voice," though featuring an occasional
article of substance, is of low literary value and mainly a
product of the desire of a group of students showing they
"dare" to rebel.
That any publication should be allowed to circulate on a
university campus, barring violation of laws of libel or ob
scenity as determined by a court, should be unquestioned.
And this distribution must not be the product of forms, peti
tions, and permits.
The magazine is in no way a Stanford publication. It is
published at San Jose State, and its contents would not be
interpreted by anyone to represent an official stand of Stan
ford students, faculty, 01* stafl. This fact precludes us, as a
university, from analyzing content and permitting or not
permitting distribution on that basis. Undoubtedly there
are several magazine publications on sale at the Stanford
Bookstore that would be viewed as questionable for distri
bution were they an official publication of a Stanford group.
It would be senseless to say they should be reviewed, or
must apply for permission to be distributed. The case of "The
Campus Voice" is similar.
"The Campus Voice" is not worth the time it has received
It has a petition for distribution now pending before a Uni
versity committee. Any literature that Stanford students deem
to be of interest should be available to them, without involv
ing the efforts of valuable people to approve or disapprove
of its distribution.
