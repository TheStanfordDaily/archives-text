# Objectionable Pages Torn From Dickinson Yearbook

RUTHERFORD, N.J. (CPS) â€”
An award-winning essay critical
of Fairleigh Dickinson Univer
sity and its students, "Something
Is Wrong," was cut out of 250 to
300 copies of the 1963 yearbook,
"Castlelight," during the summer
as the result of an order from
Dean of Admissions Mrs. Sylvia
Sammartino, according to the di
rector of the university's book
stores.
"It took my staff a whole day
to do that destructive work," said
Mrs. Charlotte Essler, bookstore
director. She had been ordered
to censor all yearbooks in the
bookstore, but had only a limited
supply at the time.
MKS SAMMARTINO, wife of
University President Dr. Peter
Sammartino, admits ordering re
moval of what she repeatedly
called "the indictment" from 200
copies which the university
bought for promotional use, but
denies knowledge of the oiher
censored copies.
The Teaneck campus received
three boxes of cut yearbooks
through the office of John Wong,
student activities director.
Wong, under whose realm the
yearbook falls, declined to com
ment.
"Don't I have a right to do
what I please to my own copies?
There wasn't a line of truth in
the whole thing," said the dean
of admissions, referring to the
article by Lawrence Bagnioli, a
1963 FDU graduate from the
Rutherford campus. "He didn't
have the educational background
to write this."
This year Bagnioli is leaching
Freshman English at the Ruther
ford campus on a fellowship
from the university.
PROFESSOR B. MAGNUS,
chairman of the Student Life and
Welfare Committee of the Ruth
erford chapter of the American
Association of University Profes
sors, brought the matter before
th Executive Board and member
ship of the AAUP today.
Dr. Sammartino told The Bul
letin, the student newspaper at
FDU, "The article in question
was a reprint from the student
newspaper; therefore there was
no censorship.

"The ommission of the article
applied only to a small number
of books bought and paid for
specifically for high school dis
tribution, and could have given
a distorted picture of our insti
tution. Through some mixup,
some of there books were dis
tributed to students.
"There are still uncut books
available and, as a matter of fact,
when the error was discovered,
only uncut books were given to
students and cut books were with
drawn from any use.
"HEREAFTER," Dr. Sammar
tino concluded, "the university
will no longer, purchase any
books for promhtional purposes,
and this question can no longer
arise."
The essay, objected to by Mrs.
Sammattino, which was printed
as a prize winner in a contest
sponsored by last year's Ruther
ford Bulletin, contained state
ments such as : "Rapid growth,
large size, and tight admission
standards mean nothing if a uni
versity lacks a stimulating intel j
lectual atmosphere ... if such
an atmosphere exists on campus
it is well hidden . . ."
The article further continued,
"Most students are wasting their
electives on 'snap courses' . . .
Many of the required courses are
merely a rehash of material that
should have been covei-ed in high
school . . . Some of the ills are
definitely the fault of the ad
ministration. In matters both
large and small there seems to
be an abysmal lack of knowledge
of what is important and neces
saiy for the creation of an intel
lectual atmosphere."
Clair W. Black, dean of the
Rutherford campus, stated that
"This (the censorship) was done
without my knowledge. I was
not consulted in the matter in
any. I would not have ordered
it done. While I would not con
cur in everything in the essay
and may have considered it some
what irresponsible, I would not
have found it so objectionable
that I would ask that the pages
be deleted.
"This book is a student publi
cation and should not. as such,
be censored," said Black.
