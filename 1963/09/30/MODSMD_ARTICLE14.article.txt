# West Berlin University Acts Against Student Refugee Aid
## 
### 
(Student Mirror) ThP Rector of
the Free University in Berlin,
Professor Heinitz, recommended
that one of the students who had
given assistance to inhabitants of
East Berlin and East Germany in
their efforts to flee should move
out of the student village of the
Free University. This decision,
which was also approved by the
student representative council of
the FU, was taken jointly by the
Rector and the Founders' Com
mittee of the student village.
The West Berlin morning news
paper. "Berliner Morgenpost,"
was the first to take up this mat
ter and it thus made a public
discussion of this affair inevi
table. As the "Berliner Morgen
post" wrote on August 181 h, Hei
nitz had stated that the activities
of student refugee helpers w ere
jeopardizing the safety of FU
and its students. The helpers had
proceeded without due care in
their "actions"; this had led to
West German students on visits
to East Berlin being interrogated
by the Eastern State Security
Service.

Professor Heinitz was re
proached for having disowned the
spirit of the foundation of the
Free University. (The Free Uni
versity was brought into being
in the year 1918, as a reaction to
the oppression of academic
freedom at the East Berlin Uni
versity.) A number of the foun
ders of the FU came together on
August 20th for talks in which
the political statements by Mag
nificence Heinitz were unami
mously criticized.
The same day, the Governing
Mayor of Berlin received the Rec
tor for a frank discussion which
led to the following statement:
1. Any activities bringing assist
ance for our oppressed fellow
citizens in the Eastern part of
our city are honourable and
worthy of our respect. 2. It is
a part of the rights and duties
of the Rector to look after the
security of the students. 3. These
two points make a public discus
sion of all details inadmissible.
4. There exist no differences of
opinion between the Senate of
Berlin and the Rector of the FU
on the unchanged moral and poli
tical basis of the Free University.

a part of the rights and duties
of the Rector to look after the
security of the students. 3. These
two points make a public discus
sion of all details inadmissible.
4. There exist no differences of
opinion between the Senate of
Berlin and the Rector of the FU
on the unchanged moral and poli
tical basis of the Free University.
(Student Mirror) ThP Rector of
the Free University in Berlin,
Professor Heinitz, recommended
that one of the students who had
given assistance to inhabitants of
East Berlin and East Germany in
their efforts to flee should move
out of the student village of the
Free University. This decision,
which was also approved by the
student representative council of
the FU, was taken jointly by the
Rector and the Founders' Com
mittee of the student village.
The West Berlin morning news
paper. "Berliner Morgenpost,"
was the first to take up this mat
ter and it thus made a public
discussion of this affair inevi
table. As the "Berliner Morgen
post" wrote on August 181 h, Hei
nitz had stated that the activities
of student refugee helpers w ere
jeopardizing the safety of FU
and its students. The helpers had
proceeded without due care in
their "actions"; this had led to
West German students on visits
to East Berlin being interrogated
by the Eastern State Security
Service.

Professor Heinitz was re
proached for having disowned the
spirit of the foundation of the
Free University. (The Free Uni
versity was brought into being
in the year 1918, as a reaction to
the oppression of academic
freedom at the East Berlin Uni
versity.) A number of the foun
ders of the FU came together on
August 20th for talks in which
the political statements by Mag
nificence Heinitz were unami
mously criticized.
The same day, the Governing
Mayor of Berlin received the Rec
tor for a frank discussion which
led to the following statement:
1. Any activities bringing assist
ance for our oppressed fellow
citizens in the Eastern part of
our city are honourable and
worthy of our respect. 2. It is
a part of the rights and duties
of the Rector to look after the
security of the students. 3. These
two points make a public discus
sion of all details inadmissible.
