### 
AMERICUS, Georgia (CPS)â€”
A hearing for three workers from
the Student Non Violent Coordi
nating Committee (SNCC) who
are being held without bail on
charges of attempting to incite
insurrection is expected within
five days.
Albany attorney C. B. King
filed a motion seeking the release
of Ralph Allen of Melrose, Mas
sachusetts, Donald Harris of New
York City, and John Perdew of
Denver, Colorado. The three have
been held since August 8 without
bail.
Perdew's case was brought to
the attention of Attorney General
Robert Kennedy by Congressmen
Allott, Dominick and Rogers, all
of Colorado. They have asked the
Justice Department to investi
gate the charges against Perdew.
SNCC has charged that the con
ditions in Americus' jails are
"incredible." The Committee re
cently produced photographs of
jail conditions in the Leesburg
stockade where "as many as 36
young girls were qept in a single
room with no beds, no mattresses,
no sheets, no pillows, and no
blankets."
