of wheat to the Soviet Union.
White House aides were ready to brief the President on the mat

of western conservation sites.
The State Department already is reviewing its export policy in
anticipation of a formal Soviet offer to buy U.S. wheat.
ACCORDING TO congressional sources, the Russians are under
stood to be waiting for a definite favorable sign from Washington
before they make a concrete offer.

in buying three million tons of U.S. wheat for about $250 million.

vately. Mnday, members of the senate foreign relations and agri
culture committees will meet behind closed doors to hear Agricul
ture Secretary Orville L. Freman, Commerce Secretary Luther H.

RIGHT TO TRAVEL DEMONSTRATION San Francisco A
small group of demonstrators Sunday conducted a motorcade down
Market Street to protest government travel policies.
The 18-ear parade began at Civic Center, went down the city's
main street and ended at Victoria Square Park, where 20-year-old
Sue Griffin was crowned "Miss Right To Travel Of 1963."
The demonstration was sponsored by the Committee to Uphold
the Right to Travel, an organization which has supported a group
of students who recently defied the State Department by visiting
Cuba.
Signs plastered on the sides of the cars read: "Let Us See For
Ourselves," "Don't Fence Mo In." and "Lenny Bruce Supports Free
Travel."
A spokesman for the committee said the demonstration would be
followed in the near future by speeches around the Bay Area given
bv the students who went to Cuba.
