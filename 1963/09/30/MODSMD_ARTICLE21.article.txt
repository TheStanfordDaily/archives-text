# Ralston Blames Pre-Game Preparation For Webfoots' Rout of Cardinals
##

By PKTE EAKLANI)
The tomahawks were in the
wrong hands Saturday as Ore
gon's versatile, speedy offense
and capable defense handed
Coach John Ralston his first de
feat. since becoming an Indian.
"A real bad afternoon, for
which I must hold myself per
sonally responsible," Ralston sad
ly announced at a press confer
ence after the game.
"BOTH THE team's physical
and mental preparations, he said,
were far less than adequate." He
reasoned that only a deficiency
in mental preparation could
cause Clark Weaver, a very com
petent quarterback, to fumble
five times and to throw the ball
away twice more.
Weaver was not the only player
making mistakes. Others in the
backfield lost the handle on the
football. Six fumbles were lost,
most of them deep in Stanford
territory.
Ralston pointed out that, sta
tistically, a team has at least 13
first and ten opportunities dur
ing a game. When a team throws
away eight of these on fumbles
and interceptions, it has no
chance of winning. Even after
discounting fumbles, he admitted
Stanford was outclassed.
Ralston cited Oregon as a team
which thrives on opponent's mis
takes by converting them into
points.
THE STANFORD HEAD coach
indicated that Oregon did some
things he had not expected. De
fensive preparations for the game
had centered around Oregon's
running attack. A special de
fense for Renfro had been in
stalled. but, in the words of Ral
ston. "We didn't stop Bob Berry."
Oregon's flat passing in the
first quarter caught Stanford off
guard. The team overemphasized
coverage and gave quarterback
Berry too much freedom.
The bootleg keeper around end
by Berry was a frequent Duck
gainer against a Stanford defense
protecting the middle of the line.
OREGON'S LEN Casanova was
singled out by Ralston as one of
the country's ablest football
coaches. "His teams are always
finely coached, well-drilled, and
colorful."
Ralston was questioned about
putting in Ihe first string after
the third unit had marched from
the Indian nine yard line into
Oregon territory.

A score was much needed at;
this point and Ralston thought
a fresh team might do better.
The third string was overjoyed
that it had come so far and, as
an aspect of teamwork, was will
ing to let a fresh team take over.
STANFORD AGAIN used the
services of approximately 45 play
ers. Ralston regards depth as a
Cardinal strength and definitely
is thinking in terms of three pla
toons.
Injury-wise, Stanford left the
field in good shape. J. D. Lodato,
who suffered a slight concussion,
and Frank Pattitucci, who in
jured his back, need only a few
days of rest. Fulback Dan Con
away may miss the UCLA en
counter pending X-ray examina
tion of an injured leg.
Bouncing back after Saturday's
stunning loss will be relatively
easy predicted Ralston because of
the "basic pride and dedication
of the players and because of
their good attitude after the
game."

Coach John Ralston his first de
feat. since becoming an Indian.
"A real bad afternoon, for
which I must hold myself per
sonally responsible," Ralston sad
ly announced at a press confer
ence after the game.
"BOTH THE team's physical
and mental preparations, he said,
were far less than adequate." He
reasoned that only a deficiency
in mental preparation could
cause Clark Weaver, a very com
petent quarterback, to fumble
five times and to throw the ball
away twice more.
Weaver was not the only player
making mistakes. Others in the
backfield lost the handle on the
football. Six fumbles were lost,
most of them deep in Stanford
territory.
Ralston pointed out that, sta
tistically, a team has at least 13
first and ten opportunities dur
ing a game. When a team throws
away eight of these on fumbles
and interceptions, it has no
chance of winning. Even after
discounting fumbles, he admitted
Stanford was outclassed.
Ralston cited Oregon as a team
which thrives on opponent's mis
takes by converting them into
points.
THE STANFORD HEAD coach
indicated that Oregon did some
things he had not expected. De
fensive preparations for the game
had centered around Oregon's
running attack. A special de
fense for Renfro had been in
stalled. but, in the words of Ral
ston. "We didn't stop Bob Berry."
Oregon's flat passing in the
first quarter caught Stanford off
guard. The team overemphasized
coverage and gave quarterback
Berry too much freedom.
The bootleg keeper around end
by Berry was a frequent Duck
gainer against a Stanford defense
protecting the middle of the line.
OREGON'S LEN Casanova was
singled out by Ralston as one of
the country's ablest football
coaches. "His teams are always
finely coached, well-drilled, and
colorful."
Ralston was questioned about
putting in Ihe first string after
the third unit had marched from
the Indian nine yard line into
Oregon territory.

A score was much needed at;
this point and Ralston thought
a fresh team might do better.
The third string was overjoyed
that it had come so far and, as
an aspect of teamwork, was will
ing to let a fresh team take over.
STANFORD AGAIN used the
services of approximately 45 play
ers. Ralston regards depth as a
Cardinal strength and definitely
is thinking in terms of three pla
toons.
Injury-wise, Stanford left the
field in good shape. J. D. Lodato,
who suffered a slight concussion,
and Frank Pattitucci, who in
jured his back, need only a few
days of rest. Fulback Dan Con
away may miss the UCLA en
counter pending X-ray examina
tion of an injured leg.
Bouncing back after Saturday's
stunning loss will be relatively
easy predicted Ralston because of
the "basic pride and dedication
of the players and because of
their good attitude after the
game."
