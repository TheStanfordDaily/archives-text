# Oregon Romps Over Tribe As Berry Triggers Attack
## 
### TOM ELIAS 
Stanford succeeded Saturday afternoon in containing Oregon's
mighty Mel Renfro, bin could neither hold on to the football or stop
the passing arm of junior quarterback Bob Berry. The result was
a stunning 3(5 to 7 loss, worst defeat for Stanford in the 32 game
series with the Ducks.
The win was also the seventh in a row over the Tribe for Len

j Casanova's crew, and their scv-
I enth straight at Stanford Sta
; dium.
ALL THOUGH the game, the
: ball was too elusive for Indian
! backs to hang on to. The Tribe
began fumbling early in the first
1 period, when after they had
I pushed Oregon back from the six
! to the 17 yard lineand taken over
I the ball, a Clark Weaver to Dan
! Conaway lateral went astray and
was fallen on by Duck Milt Kan
ahe.
One play later, Oregon was out
' in front 6 to 0 on a Berry to Paul
] Burleson aerial from 17 yards
i out. Buck Corey converted and
| the Webfoots were out in front
j by seven with 7:31 remaining in
! the period.
I After Stanford had taken the
I ensuing kickoff and been penal
ized back to their own 13 for clip-
I ping, Weaver fumbled the first -
j down pass from center. Don Cau
| sey picked it out of the air for
I Oregon at the line of scrimmage.
STANFORD'S DEFENSE held
j this time, and the Webfeet had to
; try a field goal. Corey was off
the mark this time and the Cards
took over on their twenty.
Two plays later, on third down,
j Weaver fumbled again. Again
| the Ducks recovered, but this
time Berry took them in, as Ren
i fro caught an 8 yard pass to cap
the 30 yard drive. Corey's kick
! was good this time, and with 4:52
| remaining in the first period.

Oregon was out in front 14 to
0.
The Tribe took the next kick
off and mounted its only sus
tained drive of the afternoon.
Ray Hand ley took the kick and
returned' to the Indian 29. From
there Stanford moved 71 yards in
14 plays for their only score of
the afternoon.
KEY PLAYS in the drive were
a 21 yard third down pass to
Bob Howard at the Stanford 48,
and Ray Handley's run three
plays later from ihc Oregon 34
to iheir 18 just as the quarter
ended.
On the fifth play of the second
period, Weaver hit Dick Rags
dale in the flat for a three yard
score. Braden Bcck converted
successfully, and the score was
14 to 7 with Stanford still very
much in the game.
Now the Webfeet really as
serted themselves, taking the
kickoff at their 22 and moving
from there in 40 plays for the
score. Key play on the drive was
a Berry to Burleson bomb which
moved the ball 40 yards from the
Oregon 47 to the Stanford 7.
TWO PLAYS later Berry
rammed it over from the one.
Corey's kick was good and Ore
gon led 21 to 7. That's the way
it stood at the half, as the two
teams exchanged punts for the
rest of the quarter.
Stanford began the second half
just as they had the first, with a
fumble. This time Steve Thurlow
fumbled on the first play from
scrimmage after the kickoff, with
