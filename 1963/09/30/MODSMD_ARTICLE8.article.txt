# House Specializes in Latin America
## 
### MICHAEL ROSTER 
International understanding
and classroom learning as an in
tegrated part of the student resi
dent program is being tested this
year in an experimental program
at Holladay House, Stern Hall.
The program, conceived by
Fred Goff, Stu liawlings, and
Holt Ruffin, centers on the cus
toms and problems of Latin
American countries. All three
have either lived in or traveled
through Latin America. Unlike a
recent project in which Holla
flay House served as an interna
tional house, the specialization in
one continent should provide a
more intensive study.
Basic planning for the Latin
America House began last yea r
when the three undergraduate
students requested resident fa
cilities for a significant number
of students interested in La 1 in
American affairs. With the as
sistance of the faculty and ad
ministration, the facilities of Hol
laday House were made available.
The program is presently com
posed of 12 students, seven being
students from Latin America

presently studying at Stanford.
ACCORDING TO GOFF, the
majority of the residents speak
Spanish or Portuguese; many
have been to Latin America.
At the heart of the program is
an effort to surround students
with the customs, traditions, and
language of Latin America while
at the university. This, it is ex
pected, will produce an atmos
phere more conducive to the
studying of the vitally important
problems of Latin America. Al
ready in operation or planned are
a lounge with a Latin American
theme, language tables, a series
of lectures and films, shortwave
contact with Latin America, and
a library specializing in the area.
Other projects are also up for
consideration. One is to publish
a newsletter for distribution to
high school language students to
familiarize them with the south
ern continent. Another is to de
velop a program similar to Cross
roads Africa.
IN ORDER TO promote the
speaking of Spanish or Portu
guese, the house may set aside
three nights weekly during which
only these languages will be

I spoken. It is also hoped that a
woman associate program can hp
j established so that all Stanford
students may actively participate.
A major house project will ho
this spring in conjunction wit h
Project Amigos when students
will assist in reconstruction in
, Tijuana. Similar programs will
be set later.
The organization of the project
is st.il being planned. For the
most part it will follow the lines
;of regular house government.
| However, "impromptu coups,"
j Goff warns, are always a pos-
I sibility.
TilK KHYNOTti of the house
j is expressed in a quote by Henry
L. Stimson printed in the house
bulletin: "No private program
j and no public policy, in any sec
; tion of our national life, can now
: escapc from the compelling fact
| that if it is not framed with ref
erence to the rest of the world it
is framed with futility." With
' this theme in mind, Latin Amer
; ica House plans to promote,
| through participation, an interest
in a part of the world tremen
dously important in today's nf
-1 fairs.

through Latin America. Unlike a
recent project in which Holla
flay House served as an interna
tional house, the specialization in
one continent should provide a
more intensive study.
Basic planning for the Latin
America House began last yea r
when the three undergraduate
students requested resident fa
cilities for a significant number
of students interested in La 1 in
American affairs. With the as
sistance of the faculty and ad
ministration, the facilities of Hol
laday House were made available.
The program is presently com
posed of 12 students, seven being
students from Latin America

presently studying at Stanford.
ACCORDING TO GOFF, the
majority of the residents speak
Spanish or Portuguese; many
have been to Latin America.
At the heart of the program is
an effort to surround students
with the customs, traditions, and
language of Latin America while
at the university. This, it is ex
pected, will produce an atmos
phere more conducive to the
studying of the vitally important
problems of Latin America. Al
ready in operation or planned are
a lounge with a Latin American
theme, language tables, a series
of lectures and films, shortwave
contact with Latin America, and
a library specializing in the area.
Other projects are also up for
consideration. One is to publish
a newsletter for distribution to
high school language students to
familiarize them with the south
ern continent. Another is to de
velop a program similar to Cross
roads Africa.
IN ORDER TO promote the
speaking of Spanish or Portu
guese, the house may set aside
three nights weekly during which
only these languages will be

I spoken. It is also hoped that a
woman associate program can hp
j established so that all Stanford
students may actively participate.
A major house project will ho
this spring in conjunction wit h
Project Amigos when students
will assist in reconstruction in
, Tijuana. Similar programs will
be set later.
The organization of the project
is st.il being planned. For the
most part it will follow the lines
;of regular house government.
| However, "impromptu coups,"
j Goff warns, are always a pos-
I sibility.

International understanding

The program, conceived by
