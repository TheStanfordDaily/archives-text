# Policy Mix-up
## Delay Causes Band's Absence 
### MAKY KAY BECKER 
Delay in preparation of the band, due to misunderstandings in
volved in the termination of Julius Shuchat's status of band direc
tor as of last spring, was the reason for the absence of the band at
the Oregon football game Saturday, according to members of the
band.
Saturday was the first time since the revival of football at Stan-

ford in 1916 that The Farm has-*
not been represented musically at
a home football game.
Until very recently the band
was nominally under the control
of the music department. During
that time, however, most of tlie
I subsidization for the band's ac
tivities — uniforms, travel fare,
etc. — was provided by the ath
letic department. Dissatisfaction
among the band with this situa
tion was intensified when it
was learned that Shuchat, band
director for IT years would not
be returning as band director this
year, although he remains direc
tor of the Palo Alto high school
band system. The band members
felt this to be due to pressure;
I from the music department. Pro-1
I testing this, the members decided j
J that the band would not appear i
Saturday.
A statement issued by their I
j officers yesterday stated that;
| their absence was the result of j
; "some considerable alterations in i
I the band administration effected
I last spring," adding that "in the
, transition between regimes there
: were several misunderstandings. l
These caused delays 'in, preiiara- j
| tions for the fall football season,
; which normally require several;
weeks during the ;summer. Mem
bers of Kappa Kappa Psi (the
band fraternity), who are re
, sponsible for much of the opera
! tion of the band, felt that it was
not possible under these condi
i tions to field a band that was up
to Stanford's high standards."
A change in administration ef
fected last week places the band
now under the control of th e
Athletic Department. Officers of
the band have stated that it will
appear in the stands for the
UCLA game next week, and that
shows will start with the Notre
Dame on October 26.
The lack of preparation by the ,
band was shown at the first:
| meeting, when only 21 people |
I were present; according to Mike 1
j McCardle, president of K a p p a |
! Kappa Psi, usually there are
I close to eighty at the first meet-1
; ing. Those present were mostly]
j freshmen, he added. He said that,
nothing was done to organize,
[the band during the summer.
"We are all behind the new band ;
this year, however" McCardle
said, "and the new organization :
is now operating smoothly.
Further activities this year for
| the red atid-gray clad band will!
; include the ninth annual High
School Band Day, a trip to Los
j Angeles for the Stanford-USC i
; contest, and many Big Game ac
tivities. There are also many!
! pro-game rallies, planned a n d j
I otherwise. "The band has actively :

supported the activities of the
ASSU," said Jim Smith, student
director, "and we will continue to
do so."
Members are now being re
cruited for the marching band.
Band personel paid visits to many
experienced frosh yesterday, and
other band veterans are being
contacted as soon as they are
found. Between 100 and 120 men
will be needed in the marching
unit, and women are needed for
several clerical positions.
Anyone who is interested—ex
perienced or not—is urged to
come to the Band House, located
behind the BAC in a grove of
trees, on Tuesday and Thurs
day at 7:15 for rehearsals.
