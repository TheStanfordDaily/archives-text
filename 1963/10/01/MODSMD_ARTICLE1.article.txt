# Fraternity Living Praised, But Speakers Urge Reform

### STEVE LEOPOLD 
Fraternity houses are preferred over other living groups for
housing and entertaining visiting speakers of the Tuesday Evening
Series, declared Mrs. Agnes Nohrnberg. director of public events,
and one of four speakers at the first meeting of the Inter-Fraternity
Council because "fraternities have more homogeneity and a more
homelike atmosphere."
Another benefit, added Mrs. Nohrnberg in her talk before all the

fraternity presidents and theiM
IPC representatives, was that a i
fraternity can guarantee a crowd j
of 25 or so, whereas Wilbur and j
Stern are sometimes unable to I
attend a reception for a visiting
speaker.
OTHEH SPEAKERS dwelt on
the subject of good house leader- j
ship and joint fraternity projects i
for the year. Charles Taylor, di- I
rector of athletics, urged the fra- |
ternities to show more pride in
their members who participate in
campus activities. He noted that
95-98</< of the varsity athletes
were fraternity men. and that in :
recent years there has been a j
downtrend in house pride over j
the sacrifice and accomplish- |
ments these students have made, j
"Let's assist these fellows," he
urged, "and show more house
pride for our brothers who work '
hard in all fields of activity
politics, athletics, band, and
others."
Another major speaker was
Lewis Picetti, who spent the last
three years as alumni adviser at <
Phi Gamma Delta. Aside from
urging the fraternities to inte- !
grate their sophomore pledges |
more quickly into fraternity life
and to educate them into the
meaning and purpose of the fra- :
ternity, Picetti proposed an inter- ;
fraternity project for IPC to initi- |
ate this year.
Citing the "enormous gap be- I
tween students and faculty here i
at Stanford," he suggested that |
the fraternities atempt to per- I
suade 25-50 professors to donate \
some of their time to lecturing, I
talking, and counselling with
various fraternities during the
school year.
THE FINAL speaker, Robert j
Gordon, Dean of Men. also urged !
more contact between professors I

and the fraternities. He proposed
that each fraternity try to work
out a plan, incoordination w i th
the IFC, the Administration, and
the national officers, that would
deal with the problem of "Where
Do We Go from Here."
He stated that fraternities were
here to stay at Stanford and that
instead of being defensive about
fraternities and what they don't
do for their members, fraternity
men should go to the offense and
let the students know what they
are doing.

Council because "fraternities have more homogeneity and a more
homelike atmosphere."
Another benefit, added Mrs. Nohrnberg in her talk before all the

fraternity presidents and theiM
IPC representatives, was that a i
fraternity can guarantee a crowd j
of 25 or so, whereas Wilbur and j
Stern are sometimes unable to I
attend a reception for a visiting
speaker.
OTHEH SPEAKERS dwelt on
the subject of good house leader- j
ship and joint fraternity projects i
for the year. Charles Taylor, di- I
rector of athletics, urged the fra- |
ternities to show more pride in
their members who participate in
campus activities. He noted that
95-98</< of the varsity athletes
were fraternity men. and that in :
recent years there has been a j
downtrend in house pride over j
the sacrifice and accomplish- |
ments these students have made, j
"Let's assist these fellows," he
urged, "and show more house
pride for our brothers who work '
hard in all fields of activity
politics, athletics, band, and
others."
Another major speaker was
Lewis Picetti, who spent the last
three years as alumni adviser at <
Phi Gamma Delta. Aside from
urging the fraternities to inte- !
grate their sophomore pledges |
more quickly into fraternity life
and to educate them into the
meaning and purpose of the fra- :
ternity, Picetti proposed an inter- ;
fraternity project for IPC to initi- |
ate this year.
Citing the "enormous gap be- I
tween students and faculty here i
at Stanford," he suggested that |
the fraternities atempt to per- I
suade 25-50 professors to donate \
some of their time to lecturing, I
talking, and counselling with
various fraternities during the
school year.
THE FINAL speaker, Robert j
Gordon, Dean of Men. also urged !
more contact between professors I

and the fraternities. He proposed
that each fraternity try to work
out a plan, incoordination w i th
the IFC, the Administration, and
the national officers, that would
deal with the problem of "Where
Do We Go from Here."
He stated that fraternities were
here to stay at Stanford and that
instead of being defensive about
fraternities and what they don't
do for their members, fraternity
men should go to the offense and
let the students know what they
are doing.
Fraternity houses are preferred over other living groups for
housing and entertaining visiting speakers of the Tuesday Evening
Series, declared Mrs. Agnes Nohrnberg. director of public events,
and one of four speakers at the first meeting of the Inter-Fraternity
Council because "fraternities have more homogeneity and a more
homelike atmosphere."
