University of California Presi
dent Clark Kerr has affirmed the
University policy requiring that
all fraternities and sororities sign
non-discrimination pledges by
September 1. 1964, according to
the UCLA Daily Bruin.
The President of UC's Berkeley
campus told five UC student
newspaper editors at a special
conference Wednesday lhat the
University was "very disturbed
by the sororities' failure to com
ply" with the policy. He noted
that a few fraternities and most

iof the sororities had not yet
signed.
Kerr added that many of the
houses believe that "the day will
never come," but, he declared,
this is a false belief; "the dead
| line positively will not be ex-
I tended."
i "We will declare them as non
| recognized and they will not be
I approved housing."
Kerr pointed out that it will
be a serious crisis for the Univer
sity if the sororities do not com
ply-
