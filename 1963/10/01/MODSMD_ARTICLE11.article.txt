The "Student Abroad" phase of the national
People-to-People program, in which Stanford stu
dents participated last summer, will continue this
year, according to Shannon Cyne, director of the
Stanford program. About forty student ambas
sadors will be selected by the end of this quarter
lo go abroad next summer.
The program was generally successful regard
ing its major goals, Clyne said. These include
facilitiating communication between Americans
and Europeans on the student level, thus offering
a broader perspective on European life, and "to
offset European impressions of Americans as only
tourists." The vehicle for this communication is
contact with families in a series of stays at four
or five European homes.
AS KXAMI'I.KS OF the favorable inception
given to People-to-People abroad, Clyne noted that
two socialist Belgian newspapers, traditionally
anti-American since the Belgian Congo incident,
were very favorable to the program. In one it was
said, "these arc Americans the way we want to
see them."
Good will toward the program in Sweden was
such that one of the student ambassadors staying
in Stockholm was allowed to visit a large under
ground iron ore mine, which only government
officials had previously been allowed to see.
Many families have requested that People-to-
People send them more students next year. Clyne
added.
CRITICISMS of the program have been mainly
organizational. Clyne emphasi/.ed, however, that
Stanford has been participating only one year.
The organization is constantly being worked on,
and the presence this year of students who have

o
already been abroad for People-to-People will be
a great help.
Several students criticized the lack of foresight
and planning in the European office. Some found
that their guaranteed home-stays had not been ar
ranged and that they consequently had to stay in
hostels or make other arrangements. According
to Clyne. tho overseas office will nevertheless not
be closed down as had been suggested; "Much
groundwork was laid by it which will be valuable
next year."
THE LACK of selectivencss, another element
criticized, will also be worked on. "The language
requirements will be technically the same two
years of college language study but will be ad
hered to more closely." Clyne said. In addition,
Stanford's orientation period during winter and
spring quarters will emphasize language practice,
possibly by working with foreign students, in or
der to provide the student ambassadors with a
political vocabulary and acquaint them with' pro
tocol and customs.
Last year. 320 American students went abroad
under the People-to-People program. Stanford's
delegation, numbering 50. was the largest.
The concept of People-to-People was formulated
about four years ayo under the Eisenhower ad
ministration. At present, however, it has no gov
ernment attachments and is privately supported
by the Hallmark Coiporation. The Student Abroad
program, in which Stanford participates, is onlj
one phase of the entire operation. National direc
tor of the student programs is William Dawson:
his administrative assistant is Steve Corker, a
Stanford graduate ol last year. Clyne, director o f
Stanford's program, is assisted by two student
advisors, Lc√üoy Fletcher and Sheila Ryan.
