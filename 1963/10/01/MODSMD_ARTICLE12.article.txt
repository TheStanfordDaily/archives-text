## 
### 
UNIVERSITY, Ala. (CPS)
The oath signed by all students
at the University of Alabama be
fore they could register for the
1963-61 school year was obtained
recently from the administration.

It reads:
"As a student at the University
of Alabama during the 1963-64
Regular Session, I recognize the
necessity for the continuation of
stringent regulations governing
student conduct during this per
iod of potential crises, and I here
by agree to abide by all such
regulations as the University of
Alabama authorities may deem
necessary for the maintenance of
the institution's academic integ
rity and to insure maximum per
sonal safety and security of all
concerned.
"IN KKKPING with the finest
traditions of the University and
with the full knowledge and un
derstanding of the necessity for
this action. 1 pledge to refrain
from any conduct which would in
any fashion contribute to dis
order. I shall at all times conduct
myself in such manner as to
avoid all activities which would
be in conflict with the high stand
ards expected of University stu
dents.
"1 certify lhat I do not now
have in my possession firearms
or other types of weapons, and
further certify that I shall avoid
having such in my possession for
the duration of these special se
curity measures.
"I WILL refrain from gratui
tous service with the news media
in matters expressly touching on
race relations and the reporting
of or photography of Negro stu
dents or Negro applicants at the
University. I understand, how
ever, that this in no way pro
hibits me from serving in the
capacity of reporter or photog
rapher in fields other than those
mentioned above.
"Furthermore, I understand
that a breach of this pledge on
my part which is found to be in
violation of the high standards
set for University students may
subject me to severe disciplinary
measures."
Among the signers of the oath
was Mel Meyer, "student editor
ol the year" last year, who signed
under protest. Signing of the
oath was a condition for readmis
sion to the University for the
year. Meyer has interpreted the
oath to mean that he is unable
to write about any racial matters
in the State of Alabama for the
Collegiate Press Service.
