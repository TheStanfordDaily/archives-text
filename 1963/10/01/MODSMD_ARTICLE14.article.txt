# Cuba Ban Should Be Judged, Not Who Went
## 
### 
The fury of the United States government against the
American students who went to Cuba this summer is out of
line with the image the Kennedy administration has been
establishing in recent months.
What is at issue is not the character of political beliefs of
the students involved. Only a minor portion of the indictment
against them involves the question of whether or not they
are members of the Communist Party. Their major violation
is ignoring the State Department travel ban.
It is somewhat shocking that the United States must bar
its own citizens from traveling anywhere they care to go.
As a nation we must have faith that our system of government
and manner of living is such that we may feel free to have
American citizens touring throughout the world. Nor is it
likely that any vast security danger is presented by the pres
ence of American citizens in countries our government holds
to be in diplomatic question.
Liberal criticism of the students that went has been such
that the character of the group has been called into question.
It is to be regretted that this fact tends to blot out much of the
question of the travel ban itself.
Whatever the official ruling of the House Committee on Un-
American Activities, or of courts of law, the impressions and
statements of these students should be heard. They have
made a trip of great interest. It is hoped that the student
community will ask to hear their version ol the trip, and only
after that take account of the nature of the group as one
would do with any statement of opinion.
