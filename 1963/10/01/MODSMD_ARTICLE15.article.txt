Background on the Students
Who Went to Cuba.
On January 16, 1961, following
the break in diplomatic relations
between Cuba and the United
States, the Department of State
declared that "citizens desiring
to go to Cuba must . . . obtain
passports specifically endorsed
.. . for such travel.
The regulations were made pur
suant to the security provisions
of the Immigration and National
ity Act of 1952, regulating travel
of citizens during war and na
tional emergency, and empower
ing the President to improse re
strictions and prohibitions. The
State Department gave as its rea
son for the action our govern
ment's inability to extend normal
protective services to Americans
visiting Cuba.
THE DEPARTMENT "contem
plated" that only "persons whose
travel may be regarded as being
in the best interests of the United
States, such as newsmen or busi
nessmen with previously estab
lished interests," would be au
thorized to visit Cuba. No provi
sions were made for interested
students or ordinary tourists.
On June 30 of this summer, in
defiance of the State Depart
ment's travel ban, some 59 U.S.
students arrived in Havana, hav
ing come via Paris and Prague.
Their visit was to be partially
subsidized by the Federation of
University Students in Havana.
Midway during their stay, the
State Department tentatively in
validated the students' passports.
When 50 of the students re
turned to New York two months
later, some of their passports
were confiscated, others marked
"Not Valid."
IN EARLY AUGUST, the Presi
dent had expressed at a press con
ference his opinion that some of
the students were Communist
Party members, rather than
merely students.
Those students who are found
to be Party members will be
liable to prosecution for "illegally
applying for passports, forbidden
Party members," and for filing
false affidavits denying member
ship.
The rest are officially consid
ered to have "violated U.S. travel
regulations by going to Cuba
without State Department per
mission," and are liable to fines
of up to $5,000 and/or 5 years im
prisonment.
The students are presently in
volved in a fight to establish the
right of U.S. citizens to travel
freely anywhere in the world.
The Bay Area students are work
ing through San Francisco's Com
mittee to Uphold the Right to
Travel (CURT).
SOME OF THE students have
already appeared before the
House Un-American Activities
Committee whose chairman, Ed
win E. Willis of Louisiana, be
lieves that "Despite the presently
existing ban on travel to Cuba,
despite the proclamation of na-

tional emergency summoning all
citizens of the United States to
be loyal to the principles upon
which our nation is founded, a
substantial number of U.S. citi
zens continue to conduct a liaison
with Cuba on behalf of promoting
the Communist Cuban regime."
Many feel that the students'
behavior during the House Com
mittee hearings earlier this
month was highly detrimental to
their cause.
I. F. Stone, editor of a liberal
Washington newsletter, declined
at the last minute to speak at a
rally on behalf of the returning
students in New York in mid-
September. "Their views," he
said, "seem to me a mixture of
naivete, Negro nationalist distor
tions (understandable in the light
of the Negro's anguish, but still
distortions), and out-of-this-world
leftism."
On the other hand, San Fran
cisco State student Elena Flem
ming, and presumably many
others like her, made the trip in
an effort to separate myth from
reality with respect to the situa
tion in Cuba. "We are not afraid
of the consequences of visiting
Cuba." she said. "We feel there
are misconceptions on both sides,
which cannot possibly be cleared
up unless free travel is allowed."
ACCORDING TO Miss Flem
ming. although Castro has denied
that any discrimination exists in
government and education, she
noted that Negroes are still not
completely accepted in hotels,
nightclubs, and on beaches.
Elena's older sister Bonnie,
familiar with pre-Castro Cuba
through her studies of Latin
America in college, found evi
dence of considerable progress
and improvement in schools, hos
pitals, and working conditions.
Both girls expressed great con
fidence that they "will win this
fight for the right to free travel."

speak later this week in Stern
Hall. Consult the Daily for

Background on the Students
Who Went to Cuba.
On January 16, 1961, following
the break in diplomatic relations
between Cuba and the United
States, the Department of State
declared that "citizens desiring
to go to Cuba must . . . obtain
passports specifically endorsed
.. . for such travel.
The regulations were made pur
suant to the security provisions
of the Immigration and National
ity Act of 1952, regulating travel
of citizens during war and na
tional emergency, and empower
ing the President to improse re
strictions and prohibitions. The
State Department gave as its rea
son for the action our govern
ment's inability to extend normal
protective services to Americans
visiting Cuba.
THE DEPARTMENT "contem
plated" that only "persons whose
travel may be regarded as being
in the best interests of the United
States, such as newsmen or busi
nessmen with previously estab
lished interests," would be au
thorized to visit Cuba. No provi
sions were made for interested
students or ordinary tourists.
On June 30 of this summer, in
defiance of the State Depart
ment's travel ban, some 59 U.S.
students arrived in Havana, hav
ing come via Paris and Prague.
Their visit was to be partially
subsidized by the Federation of
University Students in Havana.
Midway during their stay, the
State Department tentatively in
validated the students' passports.
When 50 of the students re
turned to New York two months
later, some of their passports
were confiscated, others marked
"Not Valid."
IN EARLY AUGUST, the Presi
dent had expressed at a press con
ference his opinion that some of
the students were Communist
Party members, rather than
merely students.
Those students who are found
to be Party members will be
liable to prosecution for "illegally
applying for passports, forbidden
Party members," and for filing
false affidavits denying member
ship.
The rest are officially consid
ered to have "violated U.S. travel
regulations by going to Cuba
without State Department per
mission," and are liable to fines
of up to $5,000 and/or 5 years im
prisonment.
The students are presently in
volved in a fight to establish the
right of U.S. citizens to travel
freely anywhere in the world.
The Bay Area students are work
ing through San Francisco's Com
mittee to Uphold the Right to
Travel (CURT).
SOME OF THE students have
already appeared before the
House Un-American Activities
Committee whose chairman, Ed
win E. Willis of Louisiana, be
lieves that "Despite the presently
existing ban on travel to Cuba,
despite the proclamation of na-

tional emergency summoning all
citizens of the United States to
be loyal to the principles upon
which our nation is founded, a
substantial number of U.S. citi
zens continue to conduct a liaison
with Cuba on behalf of promoting
the Communist Cuban regime."
Many feel that the students'
behavior during the House Com
mittee hearings earlier this
month was highly detrimental to
their cause.
I. F. Stone, editor of a liberal
Washington newsletter, declined
at the last minute to speak at a
rally on behalf of the returning
students in New York in mid-
September. "Their views," he
said, "seem to me a mixture of
naivete, Negro nationalist distor
tions (understandable in the light
of the Negro's anguish, but still
distortions), and out-of-this-world
leftism."
On the other hand, San Fran
cisco State student Elena Flem
ming, and presumably many
others like her, made the trip in
an effort to separate myth from
reality with respect to the situa
tion in Cuba. "We are not afraid
of the consequences of visiting
Cuba." she said. "We feel there
are misconceptions on both sides,
which cannot possibly be cleared
up unless free travel is allowed."
ACCORDING TO Miss Flem
ming. although Castro has denied
that any discrimination exists in
government and education, she
noted that Negroes are still not
completely accepted in hotels,
nightclubs, and on beaches.

Background on the Students
Who Went to Cuba.
On January 16, 1961, following
the break in diplomatic relations
between Cuba and the United
States, the Department of State
declared that "citizens desiring
to go to Cuba must . . . obtain
passports specifically endorsed
.. . for such travel.
The regulations were made pur
suant to the security provisions
of the Immigration and National
ity Act of 1952, regulating travel
of citizens during war and na
tional emergency, and empower
ing the President to improse re
strictions and prohibitions. The
State Department gave as its rea
son for the action our govern
ment's inability to extend normal
protective services to Americans
visiting Cuba.
THE DEPARTMENT "contem
plated" that only "persons whose
travel may be regarded as being
in the best interests of the United
States, such as newsmen or busi
nessmen with previously estab
lished interests," would be au
thorized to visit Cuba. No provi
sions were made for interested
students or ordinary tourists.
On June 30 of this summer, in
defiance of the State Depart
ment's travel ban, some 59 U.S.
students arrived in Havana, hav
ing come via Paris and Prague.
Their visit was to be partially
subsidized by the Federation of
University Students in Havana.
Midway during their stay, the
State Department tentatively in
validated the students' passports.
When 50 of the students re
turned to New York two months
later, some of their passports
were confiscated, others marked
"Not Valid."
IN EARLY AUGUST, the Presi
dent had expressed at a press con
ference his opinion that some of
the students were Communist
Party members, rather than
merely students.
Those students who are found
to be Party members will be
liable to prosecution for "illegally
applying for passports, forbidden
Party members," and for filing
false affidavits denying member
ship.
The rest are officially consid
ered to have "violated U.S. travel
regulations by going to Cuba
without State Department per
mission," and are liable to fines
of up to $5,000 and/or 5 years im
prisonment.
The students are presently in
volved in a fight to establish the
right of U.S. citizens to travel
freely anywhere in the world.
The Bay Area students are work
ing through San Francisco's Com
mittee to Uphold the Right to
Travel (CURT).
SOME OF THE students have
already appeared before the
House Un-American Activities
Committee whose chairman, Ed
win E. Willis of Louisiana, be
lieves that "Despite the presently
existing ban on travel to Cuba,
despite the proclamation of na-

tional emergency summoning all
citizens of the United States to
be loyal to the principles upon
which our nation is founded, a
substantial number of U.S. citi
zens continue to conduct a liaison
with Cuba on behalf of promoting
the Communist Cuban regime."
Many feel that the students'
behavior during the House Com
mittee hearings earlier this
month was highly detrimental to
their cause.
I. F. Stone, editor of a liberal
Washington newsletter, declined
at the last minute to speak at a
rally on behalf of the returning
students in New York in mid-
September. "Their views," he
said, "seem to me a mixture of
naivete, Negro nationalist distor
tions (understandable in the light
of the Negro's anguish, but still
distortions), and out-of-this-world
leftism."
On the other hand, San Fran
cisco State student Elena Flem
ming, and presumably many
others like her, made the trip in
an effort to separate myth from
reality with respect to the situa
tion in Cuba. "We are not afraid
of the consequences of visiting
Cuba." she said. "We feel there
are misconceptions on both sides,
which cannot possibly be cleared
