Editor, The Daily:
The Dean and Assistant Dean
of Women claim the Women's
Social Regulations do not dis
courage sexual behavior. Other
key figures in the Dean's Offiee
claim that the Regulations do
and ought to discourage sex.
Are the Social Regulations de
signed to inhibit sex? Despite
its divisiveness and dishonesty,
the Administration says, as best
it can, that they are so designed.
Last year's booklet on Social
Regulations begins: "The Fun
damental Standard guides all
phases of our life here at Stan
ford . . . Students arc expected
to show . . . morality and per
sonal honor." (emphasis mine.)
By not mentioning sex by name,
the Administration maintains
complete arbitrariness in inter
preting the Standard without
antagonizing students. In a let
ter in the Spring issue of Stan
ford Today, President Sterling
writes:
"Some young men and women
in colleges and universities to
day take the view that the uni
versity has no responsibility for
or jurisdiction over anything ex
cept their academic perform
ance; that the university has no
right to manifest its interest in
their personal, private conduct,
even by disciplinary action;
that the university which im
poses such discipline is invading
and impugning the rights of the
individual. This is a view which
I cannot accept and which, I
believe, this University cannot
and should not accept, because
it is a view which points to so
cial anarchy and which invites
a university to betray its pub
lic trust and its educational
tradition." Anyone still awake
should realize that the Admin
istration claims the right and
intent to regulate the sexual
behavior of students.
But do the Social Regulations
discourage sex? The Dean of
Women claims that they do not
—that they have no moral func
tion. To paraphrase her argu
ment: a girl will do at eight in
the morning what she'll do at
two at night; hence locking her
up at night does not restrict her
sexual activities. Now this is
neither logically nor empirically
true, so don't rush out to change
your eight o'clock classes. Boys
who date girls know that the
eight o'clock argument is patent
nonsense if for no other reason
that that Americans have dates
and make love at night. The
argument reduces to th e trivial
statement that there is little
need to discourage sex during
the day, when you can't keep
track of your girls anyway. The
Dean is failing to enforce only

what she can't enforce, and her
failure is hardly a symptom of
liberalism.
The mythical basis of the
eight o'clock argument is that if
there is any opportunity to per
form an act, a person is tree to
perform that act. It is a rule
of government that one way to
discourage an activity is to in
vestigate and regulate it. If the
Dean of Women made a rule
that intercourse was allowed if
a couple registered two weeks
in advance and used a certain
room, she would be discourag
ing intercourse more effectively
than if she forbid it outright.
This is the operating principle
of the present Social Regula
tions.
The Dean and Assistant Dean
of Women claim that Social
Regulations are designed to in
sure that girls get their sleep.
Lest they be accused of enforc
ing the Double Standard, the
Deans claim that girls need
their sleep more than boys do.
I guess that Social Regulations
should be called Sleeping Regu
lations, and that sleepy looking
people should be punished. But
why are married coeds, who
need their sleep worse than
ever, exempt from Social Regu
lations?
The Administration does not
recognize your right to a "per
sonal, private life," by which I
mean relatively clandestine ac
tivity involving a limited num
ber of participants and deter
mined by the tastes, habits, and
beliefs of the participants. It
is activity in which the individ
ual character and autonomous
control are not lost. In short, it
is personal and private. The Ad
ministration has claimed the
right to control any student ac
tivity—particularly, to discour
age the sexual behavior of Stan
ford women. At the very least,
enforcement of the Social Regu
lations violates the rights of
association, anonymity, and free
movement.

I can only hope that the Sen
ior Colloquium, having thus far
decayed, will follow a normal
life cycle and die out completely.
Last year's crop of Colloquia
showed signs of rottenness, but
this fall's harvest is even more
disappointing. It is paltry and
unpalatable, but swallow it we
must, every senior to a man.
The Senior Colloquium, no long
er fattened and made tempting
by the life blood of faculty sup
port, has withered into some
thing outdated and useless. Why
not kill it quickly now?

track of your girls anyway. The
Dean is failing to enforce only

what she can't enforce, and her
failure is hardly a symptom of
liberalism.
The mythical basis of the
eight o'clock argument is that if
there is any opportunity to per
form an act, a person is tree to
perform that act. It is a rule
of government that one way to
discourage an activity is to in
vestigate and regulate it. If the
Dean of Women made a rule
that intercourse was allowed if
a couple registered two weeks
in advance and used a certain
room, she would be discourag
ing intercourse more effectively
than if she forbid it outright.
This is the operating principle
of the present Social Regula

The Dean and Assistant Dean
of Women claim that Social
Regulations are designed to in
sure that girls get their sleep.
Lest they be accused of enforc
ing the Double Standard, the
Deans claim that girls need
their sleep more than boys do.
I guess that Social Regulations
should be called Sleeping Regu
lations, and that sleepy looking
people should be punished. But
why are married coeds, who
need their sleep worse than
ever, exempt from Social Regu
lations?
The Administration does not
recognize your right to a "per
sonal, private life," by which I
mean relatively clandestine ac
tivity involving a limited num
ber of participants and deter
mined by the tastes, habits, and
beliefs of the participants. It
is activity in which the individ
ual character and autonomous
control are not lost. In short, it
is personal and private. The Ad
ministration has claimed the
right to control any student ac
tivity—particularly, to discour
age the sexual behavior of Stan
ford women. At the very least,
enforcement of the Social Regu
lations violates the rights of
association, anonymity, and free
movement.

The Dean and Assistant Dean
of Women claim the Women's
Social Regulations do not dis
courage sexual behavior. Other
key figures in the Dean's Offiee
claim that the Regulations do
and ought to discourage sex.
Are the Social Regulations de
signed to inhibit sex? Despite
its divisiveness and dishonesty,
the Administration says, as best
it can, that they are so designed.
Last year's booklet on Social
Regulations begins: "The Fun
damental Standard guides all
phases of our life here at Stan
ford . . . Students arc expected
to show . . . morality and per
sonal honor." (emphasis mine.)
By not mentioning sex by name,
the Administration maintains
complete arbitrariness in inter
preting the Standard without
antagonizing students. In a let
ter in the Spring issue of Stan
ford Today, President Sterling
writes:
"Some young men and women
in colleges and universities to
day take the view that the uni
versity has no responsibility for
or jurisdiction over anything ex
cept their academic perform
ance; that the university has no
right to manifest its interest in
their personal, private conduct,
even by disciplinary action;
that the university which im
poses such discipline is invading
and impugning the rights of the
individual. This is a view which
I cannot accept and which, I
believe, this University cannot
and should not accept, because
it is a view which points to so
cial anarchy and which invites
a university to betray its pub
lic trust and its educational
tradition." Anyone still awake
should realize that the Admin
istration claims the right and
intent to regulate the sexual
behavior of students.
But do the Social Regulations
discourage sex? The Dean of
Women claims that they do not
—that they have no moral func
tion. To paraphrase her argu
ment: a girl will do at eight in
the morning what she'll do at
two at night; hence locking her
up at night does not restrict her
sexual activities. Now this is
neither logically nor empirically
true, so don't rush out to change
your eight o'clock classes. Boys
who date girls know that the
eight o'clock argument is patent
nonsense if for no other reason
that that Americans have dates
and make love at night. The
argument reduces to th e trivial
statement that there is little
need to discourage sex during
the day, when you can't keep
track of your girls anyway. The
Dean is failing to enforce only

The Dean and Assistant Dean
of Women claim the Women's
Social Regulations do not dis
courage sexual behavior. Other
key figures in the Dean's Offiee
claim that the Regulations do
and ought to discourage sex.
Are the Social Regulations de
signed to inhibit sex? Despite
its divisiveness and dishonesty,
the Administration says, as best
it can, that they are so designed.
Last year's booklet on Social
Regulations begins: "The Fun
damental Standard guides all
phases of our life here at Stan
ford . . . Students arc expected
to show . . . morality and per
sonal honor." (emphasis mine.)
By not mentioning sex by name,
the Administration maintains
complete arbitrariness in inter
preting the Standard without
antagonizing students. In a let
ter in the Spring issue of Stan
ford Today, President Sterling
writes:
"Some young men and women
in colleges and universities to
day take the view that the uni
versity has no responsibility for
or jurisdiction over anything ex
cept their academic perform
ance; that the university has no
right to manifest its interest in
their personal, private conduct,
even by disciplinary action;
that the university which im
poses such discipline is invading
and impugning the rights of the
individual. This is a view which
I cannot accept and which, I
believe, this University cannot
and should not accept, because
it is a view which points to so
cial anarchy and which invites
a university to betray its pub
lic trust and its educational
tradition." Anyone still awake
should realize that the Admin
istration claims the right and
intent to regulate the sexual
behavior of students.
But do the Social Regulations
discourage sex? The Dean of
Women claims that they do not
—that they have no moral func
tion. To paraphrase her argu
ment: a girl will do at eight in
the morning what she'll do at
two at night; hence locking her
up at night does not restrict her
sexual activities. Now this is
neither logically nor empirically
true, so don't rush out to change
your eight o'clock classes. Boys
who date girls know that the
eight o'clock argument is patent
nonsense if for no other reason
that that Americans have dates
and make love at night. The
argument reduces to th e trivial
statement that there is little
need to discourage sex during
the day, when you can't keep
track of your girls anyway. The
Dean is failing to enforce only

what she can't enforce, and her
failure is hardly a symptom of
liberalism.
The mythical basis of the
eight o'clock argument is that if
there is any opportunity to per
form an act, a person is tree to
perform that act. It is a rule
of government that one way to
discourage an activity is to in
vestigate and regulate it. If the
Dean of Women made a rule
that intercourse was allowed if
a couple registered two weeks
in advance and used a certain
room, she would be discourag
ing intercourse more effectively
than if she forbid it outright.
This is the operating principle
of the present Social Regula
tions.
The Dean and Assistant Dean
of Women claim that Social
Regulations are designed to in
sure that girls get their sleep.
Lest they be accused of enforc
ing the Double Standard, the
Deans claim that girls need
their sleep more than boys do.
I guess that Social Regulations
should be called Sleeping Regu
lations, and that sleepy looking
people should be punished. But
why are married coeds, who
need their sleep worse than
ever, exempt from Social Regu
lations?
The Administration does not
recognize your right to a "per
sonal, private life," by which I
mean relatively clandestine ac
tivity involving a limited num
ber of participants and deter
mined by the tastes, habits, and
beliefs of the participants. It
is activity in which the individ
ual character and autonomous
control are not lost. In short, it
is personal and private. The Ad
ministration has claimed the
right to control any student ac
tivity—particularly, to discour
age the sexual behavior of Stan
ford women. At the very least,
enforcement of the Social Regu
lations violates the rights of
association, anonymity, and free
movement.
