WORDS: THEIR CAUSE AND CURE
Today let us take up the subject of etymology (or entomology,
as it is sometimes called) which is the study of word origins
(or insects, as they are sometimes called).
Where are word origins (insects) to Ix 1 found? Well sir, some
times words are proper names which have passed into the
language. Take, for instance, the words used in electricity:
ampere was named after its discoverer, the Frenchman Andre
Mi trie Ampere (1775-1836); similarly, ohm was named after
the German G.S. Ohm (1781-1854), watt after the Scot James
Watt (1730-1819), and bulb after the American Fred C. Bulb
(1843-1912).
There is, incidentally, quite a poignant little story about
Mr. Bulb. Until Bulb s invention, all illumination was pro
vided by gas, which was named after its inventor Milton T. Gas

who, strange to toll, had been Bulb's roommate at Cal Tech!
In fact, strange to toll, the third man sharing the room with
Bulb and Gas was also one whose name burns bright in the
annals of illumination—Walter Candle!
The three roommates were inseparable companions in col
lege. After graduation all throe did research in the problems
of artificial light, which at this time did not exist. All America
used to go to bod with the chickens, and many fine citizens were,
alas, severely injured falling oIT the roost.
Well sir, the three comrades—Bulb, Gas, and Candle
promised to be friends forever when they left school, but
success, alas, spoiled all that. First Candle invented the can
dle, got rich, and forgot his old friends. Then Gas invented gas
got rich, bankrupted Candle, and forgot his old friends. Then
Bulb invented the bulb, got rich, bankrupted Gas, and forgot
his old friends.
Candle and Gas, bitter and impoverished at the ages respec
tively of 75 and 71, went to sea as respectively the world's
oldest and second oldest cabin boy. Bulb, rich and grand, also
went to sea, but he went in style—as a first-class passenger on
luxury liners.
Well sir, strange to tell, all three wero aboard the ill-fated
Lusitania when she was sunk in the North Atlantic. And
strange to toll, when they were swimming for their lives after
the shipwreck, all three clambered aboard the same dinghy!
Well sir, chastened and made wiser by their brush with peril,
they fell into each other's arms and wept and exchanged for
giveness and became fast friends all over again.
For three years they drifted in the dinghy, shaking hands
and singing the Cal Tech rouser all the while. Then, at long
last, they spied a passing liner and were taken aboard.
They remained fast friends for the rest of their days, which,
I regret to report, wero not many, because the liner which picked
them 11 ji was the Titanic.
What a pity that Marlboros were not invented during the
lifetimes of Bulb, (las, and Candle. Had there been Marlboros,
these three friends never would have grown apart because they
would have realized how much, despite their differences, they
still had in common. 1 mean to say that Marlboros can be lit by
candle, by gits, and by electricity, and no mattor how you
light, them, you always get a lot to like—a filter, a flavor, a
pack or box that makes anyone—including Bulb, Gas, and Can
dle—settle back and forswear pettiness and smile the sweet
smile of friendship on all who pass!

Bulb invented the bulb, got rich, bankrupted Gas, and forgot
his old friends.
Candle and Gas, bitter and impoverished at the ages respec
tively of 75 and 71, went to sea as respectively the world's
oldest and second oldest cabin boy. Bulb, rich and grand, also
went to sea, but he went in style—as a first-class passenger on
luxury liners.
Well sir, strange to tell, all three wero aboard the ill-fated
Lusitania when she was sunk in the North Atlantic. And
strange to toll, when they were swimming for their lives after
the shipwreck, all three clambered aboard the same dinghy!
Well sir, chastened and made wiser by their brush with peril,
they fell into each other's arms and wept and exchanged for
giveness and became fast friends all over again.
For three years they drifted in the dinghy, shaking hands
and singing the Cal Tech rouser all the while. Then, at long
last, they spied a passing liner and were taken aboard.
They remained fast friends for the rest of their days, which,
I regret to report, wero not many, because the liner which picked
them 11 ji was the Titanic.
What a pity that Marlboros were not invented during the
lifetimes of Bulb, (las, and Candle. Had there been Marlboros,
these three friends never would have grown apart because they
would have realized how much, despite their differences, they
still had in common. 1 mean to say that Marlboros can be lit by
candle, by gits, and by electricity, and no mattor how you
light, them, you always get a lot to like—a filter, a flavor, a
pack or box that makes anyone—including Bulb, Gas, and Can
dle—settle back and forswear pettiness and smile the sweet
smile of friendship on all who pass!

WORDS: THEIR CAUSE AND CURE
Today let us take up the subject of etymology (or entomology,
as it is sometimes called) which is the study of word origins
(or insects, as they are sometimes called).
Where are word origins (insects) to Ix 1 found? Well sir, some
times words are proper names which have passed into the
language. Take, for instance, the words used in electricity:
ampere was named after its discoverer, the Frenchman Andre
Mi trie Ampere (1775-1836); similarly, ohm was named after
the German G.S. Ohm (1781-1854), watt after the Scot James
Watt (1730-1819), and bulb after the American Fred C. Bulb
(1843-1912).
There is, incidentally, quite a poignant little story about
Mr. Bulb. Until Bulb s invention, all illumination was pro
vided by gas, which was named after its inventor Milton T. Gas

who, strange to toll, had been Bulb's roommate at Cal Tech!
In fact, strange to toll, the third man sharing the room with
Bulb and Gas was also one whose name burns bright in the
annals of illumination—Walter Candle!
The three roommates were inseparable companions in col
lege. After graduation all throe did research in the problems
of artificial light, which at this time did not exist. All America
used to go to bod with the chickens, and many fine citizens were,
alas, severely injured falling oIT the roost.
Well sir, the three comrades—Bulb, Gas, and Candle
promised to be friends forever when they left school, but
success, alas, spoiled all that. First Candle invented the can
dle, got rich, and forgot his old friends. Then Gas invented gas
got rich, bankrupted Candle, and forgot his old friends. Then
Bulb invented the bulb, got rich, bankrupted Gas, and forgot
his old friends.
Candle and Gas, bitter and impoverished at the ages respec
