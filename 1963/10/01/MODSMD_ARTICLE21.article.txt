In the preliminary games, the
Stanford l'rosh convincingly beat
Menlo Park 3-0, with two goals by
Burnett and one by Ely, while the
Balboa reserves outlasted a short
handed junior varsity squad in a
1-0 hard-fought thriller.
COACH rRIDDLK was enthusi
astic about the performance of all
three Stanford teams. He said
that the "freshman did very well,
as did the junior varsity, consid
ering that they lost several good
boys for the game. And, of
course, I was very impressed with

the way our varsity squad han
dled themselves out there."
Asked to single out some of the
outstanding players of tin 1 game,
he replied "we wore using three
or four different mon in almost
every position, and all of the boys
looked good. Al Nnoli looked par
ticularly good on the inside, and
I thought that goalie Kent Muel
ler, although he wasn't tested too
much today, shows much im
provement from last year. I feel
we have very good prospects for
our game with Air Force next
week, and for the season."
NEXT SATURDAY, the fresh
men will play Pacific at 9:00 at
the soccer field, to bo followed by
the junior varsity's tilt with the
San Francisco Rangers at 10:00.
At 11:00 the varsity will entertain
the Air Force Academy in a game
expected to provide a good test
for the undefeated Indians.
