# Developing New Dating Process
## 
### 
Geophysicists at Stanford and
the University of Osaka in Japan
are jointly working together in a
three year study of archeomag
netical phenomena with the hope
of developing a new tool for ac
curately dating archeological
finds.
By employing magnetometers
and other delicate instruments
the researchers can measure the
direction of magnetism in clay
vessels, bricks and fire pits.
The project is being carried out
; by Professors Norman Watkins
of Stanford and Naoto Kawai of
Osaka.
Archeomagnetism is concerned
with magnetism in clay artifacts;
above 6.i0 degrees the substance
becomes magnetically plastic,
thus becoming polarized with the
earth's magnetic poles.
If one knows the material's
position, he can tell the position
of the magnetic poles at the time
of cooling.
The earth's magnetic poles have
wandered over long periods of
time; the geophysicists could de
termine the age of any ceramic
object if they had an accurate
record of the wandering magnetic
poles. They hope to construct
such a record. This method of
date finding would probably be
the most accurate method yet de
veloped.
