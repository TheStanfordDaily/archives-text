"TWELVE CHURCHES" is the name of this architectural study in
photographsâ€”now being exhibited at the Stanford Art Gallery.
Arranged by the California Redwood Assn. and circulated by the
Smithsonian Institution Traveling Service, the exhibit is composed
of different shots of 12 architecturally outstanding American
churches. In all of the churches the predominant building material
is redwood. The exhibit will run until Oct. 13.
