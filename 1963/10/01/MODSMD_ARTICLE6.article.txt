# Sorbonne Prof Lectures on Medieval Poet
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
'"Every novelist writing today—
in France, in England, in Europe,
here—owes something to him."
Thus Sarbonno professor Jean
Frappier, speaker in French to
over one hundred Stanford stu
dents and faculty yesterdi.y after
noon, estimated the literary
achievement of twelfth century
writer of courtly romances, Chre
tien de Troyes.
Frappier, whose lecture
"L'Oeuvre et L'Originalite de
Chretien de Troyes" was spon
sored by the French and Italian
Department in conjunction with
the Department of English, called
Chretien "one of the great writers
of French literature a truly clas
sic author."
The French professor of medie
val literature, presently making a
lecture tour through the United
States, began his lecture by sum
marizing the literary value of
Chretien's work. Frappier quoted
nineteeth century French novelist
Josephy Mery on Chretien: "II a
ecrit en beau frangais ..." (He
wrote good French. > Frappier
added, "That phrase says every
thing—and in so few words."
Emphasizing the surprisingly
'modern' spirit of Chretien's work,
Frappier illuminated the histor
ical importance of Chretien's pion
eering efforts in the literature of
courtly romance. Frappier bal
anced biographical facts with a
critical appraisal in depth, at the
same time explaining the context
of Medieval Christian Humanism
within which Chretien worked.
Frappier will give a second lec
ture. entitled "Le Don Contrai
gnant," tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in
room 61H.
