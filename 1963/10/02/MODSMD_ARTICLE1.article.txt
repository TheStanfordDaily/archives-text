# Laslett Discusses Changes For Oxford and Cambridge

### RON DeFELICE 
Oxford and Cambridge are facing the most dramatic change in
their 600 years of existence, staled Trinity College Don Peter Las
let I las) night in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
"The particular, inescapable dilemma of universities in the
1 ( J6o\s is the problem of education adequately tin 1 one-third <v' the
population who can now afford a university education, claimed
Laslett. ♦ —

TO RESOLVE this dilemma
Laslett called for the creation of
a "University of England" to
which Oxford and Cambridge
would contribute. Under Laslett's
plan, Oxford and Cambridge
would cease to educate un d e r
graduatc and become instead the
centers of graduate study for the
whole country.
"Only by doing this can Oxford
and Cambridge go on being what
they have been; that is, im
mensely successful institutions of
learning," charged Laslett. He
cited three important reasons
that English university education
must be revamped.
"The students at Oxford and
Cambridge enjoy a higher social
standing than the students at any
comparable institution in the
world," Laslet pointed out. The
literary and cultural level in their
homes can lie found only among
the tiniest minority.
BUT TODAY universities are
challenged with the need to edu
cate up to one-third of the popu
lation to the level of the Oxford
and Cambridge student bodies."
Laslett predicted that 40 to 50
new universities will be estab
lished in England during the next
ten years. This enormous expan
sion requires that Oxford and
Cambridge attempt to redefine
their roles.
Secondly. Laslett claimed that
Oxord and Cambridge are
"two overfamous. overconcen
trated universities that over
shadow all the rest in England."
The enormous succes, the social
superiority, and the identification
of Oxford and Cambridge with
the government have made other
universities apologetic. England
has never given graduates of
other universities the expectation
of reaching the level of the gradu
ates of Oxford and Cambridge,
even though they may be equally
talented. "Social attitudes like
these led me to believe that we
must stop the process of 'elitist'
education," stated Laslett.
FINALLY, Laslett charged that
"elitist" education has caused the
neglect of vast research facilities
in England. Such facilities con
centrated in Oxford. Cambridge
and London are given over to the
high education of a very few.
Whereas these institutions should
be the largest centers of re
search, they ha v e remained
bound to the tradition of educat
ing an elite of civil servants, poli
ticians. and lawyers.
THE ( HANGING of Oxford
and Cambridge to centers of
graduate study only is especi
ally dramatic in England, where
the high purpose of a university
has always been the teaching of
undergraduates. Under Laslett's
plan, the two famous instiutions
would really become centers for
the preparation of instructors in
the nation's many new univer
sities.
