"The purpose of the fellow
ships," explained Dr. Tyler, "is

! an opportunity to work together I
; on common problems as well as j
i individual study papers.
"Our success to date is not to i
i be measured in terms of com

and articles, although the hun-;

j pleted fellowships at the center
have added substantially to their
, lists of scholarly publications," :
I stated Dr. Tyler.
