Dennis Sweeney, Speaker of
i the Congress, who worked this
| summer for the Student Non
; Violent Coordinating Committee
j and the Congres on Racial Equal
ity (CORE) in Jackson, Miss.,
will also speak at the meeting.
Gary Schoolnik, head of the
Political Union's Civil Liberties
Caucus, today asked that "those
who concern themselves with this
issue, the struggle for human
freedom, come and hear what two
veterans in the fight have to
say."
TIIK STANFORD Student Con
gres was formed Spring Quarter,
1963, after the Board of Trustees
liberalized University policy to
the extent that any open, volun
tary student organization, regis
tered with the Political Union,
would be allowed to debate and
take stands on any issues which
are of student concern.
"Shortly after this policy was
| announced, a group of students
meet to form an organization
which would be loose in struc
ture, voluntary, open in member
ship. and hopefully representa
tive of concerned students' opin
ions on campus, national, and in
ternational issues," says Sweeney.
"THE ORGANIZATION of the
Student Congress this year has
been modified significantly," says
Sweeney. "It was our experience
last spring that single interest
groups often dominated Congress
meetings by attending with hosts
of their members when the sub
ject of the debate coincided with
the interest of their group.
"While the Student Congress
certainly welcomes, indeed eager
ly solicits, the support and attend
ance of these groups, it hopes
that the attendance of all groups
will be achieved so that honest
and vibrant debate can take place.
An attempt will be made this
year, then, to employ a party or
caucus system in the Congress.
"We emphasize, however, that
j besides these traditional group-
I ings, we welcome and encourage
j the participation of any student
| groups, e.g. Peace Caucus, Civil
j Liberties Caucus, etc., as well as
comment from interested faculty
1 and members of the administra-
I tion."
A COLLECTION will be taken
;at tonight's meeting to help fi
; nance the projected general elee
i tion "Vote For Freedom." This
| will be a mock election in which
! Mississippi Negroes who are pre
vented from registering to vote
in the real elections will be able
to demonstrate graphically bo th
their desire and ability to vote.
Memberships lists for the vari
! ous factions. Democratic, Repub
lican, and an Independent Roster
j wil be circulated, along with
; those of any other approved
I groups who wish to participate.
