# Hilgard Stresses Personal Teaching
## 
### 
"The complexities of modern
knowledge are such that the stu
dent should not be asked to store
in his head all the facts he needs
to think about problems," writes
Prof. Ernest R. Hilgard on prob
lem-solving and creativity in the
autumn issue of "Stanford To
day," the University Quarterly.
The former head of the Psy
chology Department believes that
the effective teacher is one who
is able to help the student to dis
cover the facts he needs and to
search them out for himself.
HILGARD BELIEVES that a
good teacher should also "make
the student alert of problems and
help him learn general aspects
of problem solving thai go be
yond specific content." He should
help the student develop confi
dence in his creative capacities
and encourage group thinking
"the communication and inter
change of ideas (is) part of what
needs to be learned, even when
education is conceived purely in
tellectually . . ."
Teaching machines relieve the
teacher of much that is routine
so that he might devote more
time to more paramount aspects
of teaching. "Then," he writes,
"the art of the teacher will re
main where it belongs, in the
teacher as a person."
DR. HILGARD marks his 30th
year on the Stanford faculty and
had relinquished administrative
duties in 1955 to pursue teaching,
writing and research.
