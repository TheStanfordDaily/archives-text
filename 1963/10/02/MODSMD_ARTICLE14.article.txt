THIS MODERN FURNITURE fills the living room of the newly opened Bechtel Lounge for International
Students which occupies the former Zeta Psi House. Some 800 foreign students meet at the center for
cultural exchange and discussion of their impressions of the United States. Funds for the Center were
provided by a gift to the PACE program.
