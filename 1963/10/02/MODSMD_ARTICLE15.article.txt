# Student Congress Gives Rare Opportunity Here
## 
### 
The opening of this year's Stanford Student Congress
tonight must be hailed as a major stop in Stanford student
activity. The Congress was quickly born last year after the
Board of Trustee's liberalization of Stanford policy to permit
representative student groups to speak out on all issues, be
they of campus, national, or international interest. That the
Congress was formed so quickly, and demonstrated continu
ing activity indicates that the Trustee policy was a response
to a true demand.
One would hope that in the near future the student legis
lature, being the duly elected representatives of the student
body, will gain permission to speak out on "off-campus issues.'
In the interim, the Stanford Student Congress can at least
bring the dialogue into the campus structure. At some point
perhaps Stanford will entertain LASSU and the student con
gress as parallel structures in the area of student opinion:
the student congress to hear the views of political groups
committed only to their individual constituencies, and LASSU
through thoughtful study and consideration acting in their
representative capacity to issue statements on behalf of the
entire student community.
The success of the Congress depends upon the varied cam
pus political groups turning to it as a communications vehi
cle. Its meaningful existence depends upon its representa
tiveness.
Speaker of the Congress Dennis Sweeney is one of Stan
ford's most able student leaders, well-equipped personally to
effectively channel floor debate and well-equipped through
personal experience to be a knowledgeable leader of a group
that makes the world their province.
The programs outlined for the Congress present all sides
of the political spectrum, and seem consistent with the quality
that should be apparent at tonight's presentation by former
Stanford Dean Allard Lowenstein on "Mississippi, A Foreign
Country in Our Midst/'
An active and thoughtful student congress shall be a wel
come and depth-giving part of the Stanford Community.
