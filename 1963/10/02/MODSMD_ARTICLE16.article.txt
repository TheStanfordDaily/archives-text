# 'Cleopatra' Evaluated: Literate, Lavish--and Liz
## 
### FOSTER HIRSCH Drama Editor 
With the assistance of thunder
ing stereophonic sound, opulent
DeLuxe color, and a gargantuan
screen, a mellifluous-toned nar
rator addreses himself to some
elegantly formal phrases con
cerning the Battle of Pharsalia.
Thus begins the most anticipated
entertainment event of our times.
From a technical standpoint,
"Cleopatra" is a four-hour visual
feast. From the opening scene
depicting the aftermath of the
Battle of Pharsalia to the con
clusion in Cleopatra's tomb, the
audience is inundated with a con
stant stream of magnificently
upholstered make-believe.
IT IS, THEREFORE, a tribute
to Writer-Director Joseph Man
kiewicz that the dramatic ele
ments of the film are never over
shadowed by the spectacle. His
script, with the exception of a
few unfortunate lines, is quite
literate. Mankiewicz's approach
is contemporary; he looks at an
ancient society from a decidedly
modern viewpoint. Although his

historical research has obviously
been varied and comprehensive,
in the final analysis the film may
be more reflective of our own
age than of Cleopatra's. This,
however, does not materially di
minish the merit of Mankiewicz's
total accomplishment.
Rex Harrison's Caesar is mas
terful. He is at once urbane,
witty, enlightened, ingratiating,
yet firm, sparked with ambition,
and riddled with uncertainty.
Richard Burton's Antony is an
equally complex figure. He is
encased within the memory of
his divine mentor, to whose repu
tation he is simply unequal.
Realizing his deficiencies, he is at
the same time powerless to over
come them. He searches for self
respect through his love for Cleo
patra. He becomes utterly de
pendent on her, and it is her
domination which leads to his de
feat.
AS SUPERB as both Harrison
and Burton are, however, the film
belongs, and rightly so, to the
world's most famous woman.
At first, she is an ambitious
young woman who has no less a
goal than to rule the world in
what she calls "a grand design."
To achieve this, she must entice
the mighty Caesar. Under the
mask of an alluring femininity
and a sly ingenuousness, she uses
all her craft and cunning to make
Caesar share her ambition.
After Caesar's assassination
and the collapse of her dream,
she turns to Antony as a s u In
stitute. Inevitably, she falls
hopelessly in love with Antony;
as love becomes her only mas
ter, her vision of an empire fades.
