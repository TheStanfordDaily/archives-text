# University Speaker Freedom Demanded of Wallace, Barnett
## 
### 
NEW YORK â€”Governors Ross Barnett of Mississippi and George
Wallace of Alabama were challenged today to open the doors of
universities in their respective states to advocates of civil rights
and integration.
In similar telegrams to the two southern governors, NAACP
Executive Secretary Roy Wilkins pointed out that the NAACP "has
voiced no opposition" to the appearance of Governor Barnett at
Princeton University and Governor Wallace at Brown University.
The full text of the NAACP leader's telegram to Governor Bar
nett follows:
"Nation Association for the Advancement of Colored People
notes that you are to address students at Princeton University
October 1. We agree thoroughly with Princeton authorities and the
student organization which is inviting you that it is the function of
a true university in its search for truth to explore all sides of a
public question through the expressions of leading opposing advo
cates. Therefore our association has voiced no opposition to your
appearance and will not do so.
WE DO OBJECT however to the fact that under your adminis
tration the member institutions of your Mississippi university sys
tem have not been permitted to invite speakers who advocate the
abolition of racial segregation. The univesity students in Mississippi
are thus prevented from hearing anything except one side of this
important American question.
To this degree they are being denied the mental stimulation and
growth that students of Princeton and other universities receive in
resolving a point of view from the free and healthy clash of ideas.
We believe the restriction imposed upon Mississippi students does
them a disservice and in turn injures our whole democratic society.
WE CALL UPON you to use the influence of your office to the
end that the opportunity to hear and participate in the free debate of
this pressing racial issue will not hereafter be denied the students
who attend the universities in your state."
Except for the substitution of Alabama for Mississippi and
Brown for Princeton, the telegram to Governor Wallace is identical
with the above.
