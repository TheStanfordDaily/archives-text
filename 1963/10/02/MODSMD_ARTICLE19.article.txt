Editor, The Daily:
It seems that everytime we pick
up a newspaper these days we
read about a group of young
people who have gotten into some
sort of trouble. It isn't often
that we hear the other side of
the story.
Last Saturday we saw an excel
lent example of the good that
often is accomplished without
any fanfare. Early that morning,
a group of 25 Freshmen students
from Stanford came to the Stan
ford Convalescent Home as vol
unteers. Under the direction of
Sophomore Ken Jameson, they
devoted several hours of their
own time to 5 making life a little
more pleasant for the many chil
dren who are our patients.
The girls were from Roble 18.

They cleaned our life-size doll
house from top to bottom, raked
leaves and washed furniture.
The boys were from Rinconada.
They pulled weeds, hauled rub
bish. moved furniture, and helped
clean out a storeroom. It was a
warm day, but they all worked
hard and, before leaving for the
Oregon game, took an extra half
hour to visit with Ihe children at
the Home.
We thought that by writing
this letter to you we might be
bettej* abje to publicly express
our appreciation and thanks to
the men of Rinconada and the
women of Roble 18, who gave up
their free time to help someone
else.
