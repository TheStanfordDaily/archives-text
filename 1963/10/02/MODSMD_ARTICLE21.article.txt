# Tribe vs Bruins in Big Six Opener
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
No.\< Saturday Coach John Ral
ston's fiw will take on UCLA's
Bruins. The question is: will Dr.
Jeckyl or Mr. Hyde appear in the
form of Stanford's team? Will Ihe
smooth, self-assured squad that
rolled over San .lose State give
the Bruins a battle, or will the in
ept, fumbling group that, con-

tributed to an Oregon feast with
seven fumbles and two pass in
terceptions hand the game to
Billy Barnes' team?
Ralston insists that Stanford
will he ready for the Bruins. The
first-year coach took the rap for
the Tribe's pathetic showing last
week, stating that he had failed
to prepare the team for the game.
Ralston blamed himself for the
team's overtense mental attitude,
and also said that, he had failed
to prepare sufficiently for Ore
gon's passing attack.
But Ralston has made it clear
that he does not anticipate a re
turn showing of the comedy of
errors against UCLA, predicting
instead that Stanford will bounce
back and play a line game.
Stanford will have a lot going
for them in trying to live up to
their coach's optimism. The most
encouraging aspect of the In
dian's offense has been the play
of junior halfback Dick Ragsdale.
AFTER PARTICIPATING in

only two offensive plays all last ;
year as a third string quarter- j
back, Ragsdale was moved to a
starting halfback spot in spring !
practice.
Ragsdale has responded byi
scoring all five of Stanford's
touchdowns thus far, a practice
which is liable to get him arrested
under the Sherman Anti-Trust
Act if another Indian doesn't
score soon.
Another encouraging note is Hie
performance of junior quarter
back Dick Berg. Berg took over
for starter Clark Weaver last
Saturday after it became clear
that the latter was way off his
usually fine game. He moved the
team well, and his lack of speed
is offset by a fine pasing arm.
ALSO IMPRESSIVE Saturday I
was second unit tackle Chuck
Hartwig, who has been moved to
first string ahead of A 1 Hilde
brand for the Bruin game.
However, the Tribe still faces
many problems. The most glar
ing issue, outside of a general
lack of speed, is now tho fullback
position. Sophomore Glenn
Myers, who was alternating as a
starter with Ken Babajian, was
injured in the opener with San
Jose.
So Ralston promoted senior
Dan Conaway to Myers' spot.
Conaway was promptly felled

| with a leg injury against Oregon.
This leaves Stanford with Baba
jian, defensive specialist Tony
! DeLellis, and former fifth string
er Frank Bunch at fullback.
STANFORD WILL be fighting
another lino passer, UCLA's Lar
ry Zeno, who passed for 124 yards
last week against Penn State.
Stanford's defensive secondary
has not been able to stop ilie
pasing of San Jose's Rand Carter
or Oregon's Bob Berry. Satur
day's game may well hinge on
whether or not they can si if fie
Zeno.
The Tribe will have its h a n d s
full Saturday in trying to come
back against UCLA. Ralston,
who calls his boys fine athletes
with "pride and determination,"
thinks they can do it. It should
1 be interesting to watch.

Stanford will have a lot going
for them in trying to live up to
their coach's optimism. The most
encouraging aspect of the In
dian's offense has been the play
of junior halfback Dick Ragsdale.
AFTER PARTICIPATING in

only two offensive plays all last ;
year as a third string quarter- j
back, Ragsdale was moved to a
starting halfback spot in spring !
practice.
Ragsdale has responded byi
scoring all five of Stanford's
touchdowns thus far, a practice
which is liable to get him arrested
under the Sherman Anti-Trust
Act if another Indian doesn't
score soon.
Another encouraging note is Hie
performance of junior quarter
back Dick Berg. Berg took over
for starter Clark Weaver last
Saturday after it became clear
that the latter was way off his
usually fine game. He moved the
team well, and his lack of speed
is offset by a fine pasing arm.
ALSO IMPRESSIVE Saturday I
was second unit tackle Chuck
Hartwig, who has been moved to
first string ahead of A 1 Hilde
brand for the Bruin game.
However, the Tribe still faces
many problems. The most glar
ing issue, outside of a general
lack of speed, is now tho fullback
position. Sophomore Glenn
Myers, who was alternating as a
starter with Ken Babajian, was
injured in the opener with San
Jose.
So Ralston promoted senior
Dan Conaway to Myers' spot.
Conaway was promptly felled

| with a leg injury against Oregon.
This leaves Stanford with Baba
jian, defensive specialist Tony
! DeLellis, and former fifth string
er Frank Bunch at fullback.
STANFORD WILL be fighting
another lino passer, UCLA's Lar
ry Zeno, who passed for 124 yards
last week against Penn State.
Stanford's defensive secondary
has not been able to stop ilie
pasing of San Jose's Rand Carter
or Oregon's Bob Berry. Satur
day's game may well hinge on
whether or not they can si if fie
Zeno.
The Tribe will have its h a n d s
full Saturday in trying to come
back against UCLA. Ralston,
who calls his boys fine athletes
with "pride and determination,"
thinks they can do it. It should
1 be interesting to watch.
