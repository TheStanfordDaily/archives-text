"In America there is a thick
layer of social behavior which is
almost ritual in boys meeting
girls . . . girls here smile only
when they know they're being
watched . . . Stanford is fairly
well taught, but students interject
more than necessary . . . Besser

The above are excerpts from a
record of ordinary conversation at
the Bcchtel International Student
Center. There Stanford students
from foreign countries have a
common meeting place and dis
cuss. in the words o ft he director,
Dr. Werner Warmbrunn, "any
thing with a little meat in it."
The new International House,
remodeled from the old Zeta Psi
house, has been made possible by
a substantial gift to the PACK
program from Mr. and Mis. S. D.
Bcchtel and the Bcchtel Founda
tion. The center provides a meet
ing and advising place for some
800 foreign students and scholars
from 71 countries. It also helps
some 1100 foreign visitors to the
Stanford campus.
THKKK ARK MANY activities
for the foreign students and any
one who is interested. Cricket

matches, an Indian Gulli Danda, a
j beach trip, and dancing classes
are just a few of the current ac
tivities the center provides. Be
dsides these there are numerous
lectures and movies, often in var
i ious foreign tongues.
The majority of the students
who spend their time at the cen
; ter are male graduate students,
i since most of Stanford's foreign
students are male graduate stu
dents. Oft en girls at the center
will wear clothing from their own
country, enhancing the interna
tional atmosphere of house.
Thomas Claggett, Program
Counselor at the center, describes
the center as a "catalyst to help
students realize their desires."
Mr. and Mrs. William Warren are
Host Couple and, in Mrs. Warren's
words, see that "no one who
wants to be included is left out.
bul no one who wants to be left
out is included."
TilK LIVING KOOM at the In
ternational Center often contains
students, both foreign and Amer
ican, engaged in interesting con
i versations on everything from
girls to De Gaulle. As one visitor
remarked, this living room is a
; "very good place at learn about
j the world."
