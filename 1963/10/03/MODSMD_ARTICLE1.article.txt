# Lowenstein Describes Negro Oppression in South
## 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
"Mississippi is a place where Amerca is
at its worst and also where anyone who is
an American can see himself at his worst."
said Allard K. Lowenstein, associate profes
sor at the University of North Carolina, who
spoke last night before the Stanford Student
Congress on his experience as legal advisor
to the civil rights movement in Mississippi
last year.
No one needs to be reminded of the socio
economic situation there, he said, giving as
examples the statistics that the Negro in
come is 35 per cent that of the whites and
that the illiteracy rate in some areas is as
high as 4 out of 5 adult Negroes. "One should

feel an involvement in Mississippi not be
cause of the harm it does to American pres
tige, or a guilty conscience because injustice
exists somewhere, but because it is one of
the most flagrant and egregious parts of
America."
CIVIL RIGHTS workers from other states
play a minor part, Lowenstein said, because
they leave; even to cross the border into
Louisiana is to enter a state where progress
is coming. "The sense that resistance will
be successful dominates the white commu
nity; those who don't share this opinion are
beaten into submission," he said.
Most of the civil rights work in Mississippi
is aimed at allowing Negroes to vote, since

it is not now safe for them even to register,
he explained. The law requires that regis
tration be preceded by the publication of the
person's name for two weeks, and any Negro
who attempts this may be struck at through
his job, his home, or his children.
"Voter registration is dependent upon risk
of lives, and other forms of protest are
equally foreclosed," he said; "among these
is the right to picket." Teenagers who have
been arrested several times are prevented
by an antiquated law from demanding trial,
and are left in jail until they are 18.
Demonstrations are held in spite of this.
Lowenstein told a group of young Negro
marchers; held back from marching on Cap

itol Street in Jackson by police with rifles,
they yelled, "Shoot us. Shoot us." Older
Negroes finally succeeded in turning them
around.
"What did we did that made them hate us
so?" This was the question of an elderly
Negro woman whom Lowenstein spoke to.
"I am not sure that the conscience of the
Mississippi public is appealable to" he said.
THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS. One news
paper, for example, recently published a
story about a sheriff's shooting a Negro
from behind. Lowenstein added, however,
that the publisher is now being sued for libel
Civil rights leaders are now working on
two projects, Lowenstein said. One is the

mock vote; the other is the idea of a mass
assistance campaign from outside Missisippi
next summer.
"One must produce fear in the Mississip
pians—they are living in an unreal world,
supported by newspapers, thinking they have
beaten the Negro, and that national news
magazines, Kennedy, and the Pope are sin
ister forces at work," he said.
Lowenstein concluded by saying that Mis
sissippi is "not a foreign country in our midst
—it's the foreign part of us all in our midst.
In the words of Frank Graham, arbitrator for
the U.N., tlie civil rights work in Mississippi
can bring 'freedom to work for a more per
fect freedom.' "

from behind. Lowenstein added, however,
that the publisher is now being sued for libel
Civil rights leaders are now working on
two projects, Lowenstein said. One is the

mock vote; the other is the idea of a mass
assistance campaign from outside Missisippi
next summer.
"One must produce fear in the Mississip
pians—they are living in an unreal world,
supported by newspapers, thinking they have
beaten the Negro, and that national news
magazines, Kennedy, and the Pope are sin
ister forces at work," he said.
Lowenstein concluded by saying that Mis
sissippi is "not a foreign country in our midst
—it's the foreign part of us all in our midst.
In the words of Frank Graham, arbitrator for
the U.N., tlie civil rights work in Mississippi
can bring 'freedom to work for a more per
fect freedom.' "
"Mississippi is a place where Amerca is
at its worst and also where anyone who is
an American can see himself at his worst."
said Allard K. Lowenstein, associate profes
sor at the University of North Carolina, who
spoke last night before the Stanford Student
Congress on his experience as legal advisor
to the civil rights movement in Mississippi
last year.
No one needs to be reminded of the socio
economic situation there, he said, giving as
examples the statistics that the Negro in
come is 35 per cent that of the whites and
that the illiteracy rate in some areas is as
high as 4 out of 5 adult Negroes. "One should

feel an involvement in Mississippi not be
cause of the harm it does to American pres
tige, or a guilty conscience because injustice
exists somewhere, but because it is one of
the most flagrant and egregious parts of
America."
CIVIL RIGHTS workers from other states
play a minor part, Lowenstein said, because
they leave; even to cross the border into
Louisiana is to enter a state where progress
is coming. "The sense that resistance will
be successful dominates the white commu
nity; those who don't share this opinion are
beaten into submission," he said.
Most of the civil rights work in Mississippi
is aimed at allowing Negroes to vote, since

it is not now safe for them even to register,
he explained. The law requires that regis
tration be preceded by the publication of the
person's name for two weeks, and any Negro
who attempts this may be struck at through
his job, his home, or his children.
"Voter registration is dependent upon risk
of lives, and other forms of protest are
equally foreclosed," he said; "among these
is the right to picket." Teenagers who have
been arrested several times are prevented
by an antiquated law from demanding trial,
and are left in jail until they are 18.
Demonstrations are held in spite of this.
Lowenstein told a group of young Negro
marchers; held back from marching on Cap

itol Street in Jackson by police with rifles,
they yelled, "Shoot us. Shoot us." Older
Negroes finally succeeded in turning them
around.
"What did we did that made them hate us
so?" This was the question of an elderly
Negro woman whom Lowenstein spoke to.
"I am not sure that the conscience of the
Mississippi public is appealable to" he said.
THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS. One news
paper, for example, recently published a
story about a sheriff's shooting a Negro
from behind. Lowenstein added, however,
