newstands. It may also, by ap
proved petition, promote sales
through direct limited distribution
of free copies, notices on bulletin
boards, and advertising in Stan
ford campus publications.
Voting members were Barry
Carter, chairman; Marge Hard
ing, Secretary; John Forsberg,
Director of Residences; Robert
Huff, Director of Financial Aids;

The petition was submitted by

! tion which was distributed for
three hours on registration day.
At this time Dean of Students
Donald H. Winbigler commented:
"Committee (Student Faculty
Employment * policy has been to
allow students to distribute on
campus but has expected formal
application by any group in spring
j and autumn distribution. No ap
, plication was received from this
j group last spring."
