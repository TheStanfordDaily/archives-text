# Sterling Rejects Hillel's Request for Formal Religious Training on Campus
## 
### 
President Wallace Sterling, act
ing on the advice of the faculty
executive committee, has denied
ail off-campus organization's re
quest to teach religious courses
in Stanford's facilities.
The request came from Dr.
Harry S. May, director of the Hi 1-

I lei Foundation, who requested
I class space for night courses in
"The History and Ritual of Jew
ish Holidays," "A Beginners Class
of Modern Conversational He
brew," and "A Beginners Class
of the Recorder (Haleel)."
The Executive Committee of

the Academic Council recom
mended denial of the request in a
7-0 vote Tuesday.
The statement reads:
It has always been, and must
necessarily be, the policy of the
University to insist that formal
instruction on the campus be giv
en only by persons holding Uni
versity appointments. This ap
plies to all fields. The opening of
University facilities to meetings
of religious groups does not over
turn this general policy.
Under the policy adopted last
year, meetings of voluntary stu
dent organizations, including re
ligious groups, or discussion or
for occasional lectures may be
held on University promises, but
formal courses cannot be given
on campus except by persons
holding academic appointments
in the University.
Prof. Benjamin M. Page of the
Geology Department is chairman
of th e executive committee.
Members are: Harold M. Bacon,
mathematics; Sanford M. Dorn
bush, sociology; Paul F. Farns
worth, psychology; Clifford Grob
stein, biology; Henry S. Kaplan,
radiology; William M. Kays, me
chanical engineering; Philip H.
Rhinelander, philosophy; and
John W. Dodds, humanities, who
also serves as chairman of th e
committee for religious studies
at Stanford.
