# Student Committee Method Challenged
## 
### 
Tuesday evening President Sterling's Committee on Stu
dent AfFairs and Services held its first meeting of the quarter.
It met without student representatives. The committee met
without any student representation as ASSU President Bud
Wedin, and President Sterling and Dean Winbigler have
not as yet agreed upon a method of selection of these stu
dents, Last year this committee had five student members;
this year membership has been cut to three.
One can only question the reasons behind the reduction
of student membership in this committee, as well as in the
Committee on Public Exercises which had seven students last
year and will have three this year.
The students knew nothing of this reduction until very
recently; it was not the result of full committee action last
spring. Faculty members of both the Student Affairs Com
mittee and the Committee on Public Exercises have lauded
the contribution of the students to the work of the commit
tees. One can only request a statement of why there will
now be fewer students, and hope that one is received from
those that made the decision.
Methods of selecting those students who will be on the
committees is already an entangled issue. Last year the ASSU
president submitted a slate of students from which President
Sterling selected the members of the committee. This year
President Sterling has indicated doubt of the representative
ness of a slate offered solely by ASSU President Bud Wedin.
The President has suggested that he select the committee
members from Wedin's slate along with recommendations
from other sources, including direct applications to Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler,
LASSU will meet this evening and will be discussing a
method of selection of students for Presidential Committees.
It is hoped that the large and highly representative legisla
ture will be accepted as the proper body to evolve a fair
method of student committee member selection.
