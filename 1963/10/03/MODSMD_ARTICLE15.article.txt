# Hillel Verdict Has Both Good and Bad Points
## 
### 
The decision of the Executive Committee of the Academic
Council in reference to the Stanford Hillel Foundation has
both its good points and its bad.
The good point is a strong one, and it is that it was the
Academic Council that made the final decision. The Aca
demic Council consists of the entire faculty of the Univer
sity; its Executive Committee is a body representative of its
members. This type of decision belongs much more with the
faculty than it would with an appointed committee. If this
indicates a trend in decision-making, it is a good one.
The elements of bad are apparent, too, but perhaps can
not be attributed to those w ho made the decision in this case.
The distinction between discussion and instruction has
still not been sufficiently elaborated upon. Even beyond this
question, is the fact that last April's liberalization of policy
did not mean what it was thought to mean by many. Stanford
has still refused to thrust itself into a position of complete
freedom of intellectual activity on the campus. And in terms
of the religious issue specifically, we are still many steps
from removing any sectarian religious character from the
campus by entertaining all religious faiths within the campus
structure.
