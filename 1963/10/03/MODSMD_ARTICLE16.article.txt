# Sibley Explores Theory Of Non-Violent Action
## 
### MARC WEISSBLUTH 
"The Quiet Battle," by Miil
ford (J. Sibley, Professor of
Political Science, University of
Minnesota. Anchor paperback.
Mulford Q. Sibley, a Professor
of Political Science at the Univer
sity of Minnesota, has edited an
anthology of writings on non-vio
lent resistance. After examining
the roots of the theory and prac
tice of non-violence from Hao-tzu
to Thoreau, he then presents a
collection of thirteen historical
examples which illustrate the
mechanism and the dynamic pow
er of non-violent political activity.
The intent of the book is to
show that there is an alternative
to the use of violence or the
threat of violence to implement
social and political change. Sibley
affirmatively answers the ques
tion—"can injustice be effectively
opposed within communities and
between communities without
adopting the unjust means of the
oppressor or the invader."
THE WEAPONS used by the
non-violent resistors include the
economic boycott, the strike, or
ganized non-cooperating, civil dis
obedience, the sit-in with its
many variations, the fast, and
the Gandhian innovation of re
demptive suffering.
The applicability of non-violent

resistance appears to be univer
sal as Sibley moves from Vor
kuta, a Soviet forced-labor camp,
to Norway, Hungary, India, col
onial Pennsylvania, South Africa,
and to our own southern states.
IN NEARLY all of the ex
amples, the economic and psy
chological consequences of non
violent resistance are examined,
as well as the ethical basis of the
distinction between violent and
non-violent methods.
Concerning our present politi
cal situation, Sibley states that
"the war-making, sovereign na
tion-state of modern times could
have no place within a non-violent
society." For him, non-violence
is a creative and forceful ap
proach to life.
Sibley's active interest in non
academic affairs left a strong im
pression on the Stanford C om
munity during the years 1957-
1958 when he taught Political
Science.
THE FACT that our ends are
so accustomed "to respond to ag
gressive conduct by counter
aggression and to violence by
counter violence." This is true not
only when we resort to such
overt violence as war and the
threat of war but also when we
employ tactics of deception, mis
representation, and evasion in
political discussion.

lent resistance. After examining
the roots of the theory and prac
tice of non-violence from Hao-tzu
to Thoreau, he then presents a
collection of thirteen historical
examples which illustrate the
mechanism and the dynamic pow
er of non-violent political activity.
The intent of the book is to
show that there is an alternative
to the use of violence or the
threat of violence to implement
social and political change. Sibley
affirmatively answers the ques
tion—"can injustice be effectively
opposed within communities and
between communities without
adopting the unjust means of the
oppressor or the invader."
THE WEAPONS used by the
non-violent resistors include the
economic boycott, the strike, or
ganized non-cooperating, civil dis
obedience, the sit-in with its
many variations, the fast, and
the Gandhian innovation of re
demptive suffering.
The applicability of non-violent

resistance appears to be univer
sal as Sibley moves from Vor
kuta, a Soviet forced-labor camp,
to Norway, Hungary, India, col
onial Pennsylvania, South Africa,
and to our own southern states.
IN NEARLY all of the ex
amples, the economic and psy
chological consequences of non
violent resistance are examined,
as well as the ethical basis of the
distinction between violent and
non-violent methods.
Concerning our present politi
cal situation, Sibley states that
"the war-making, sovereign na
tion-state of modern times could
have no place within a non-violent
society." For him, non-violence
is a creative and forceful ap
proach to life.
Sibley's active interest in non
academic affairs left a strong im
pression on the Stanford C om
munity during the years 1957-
1958 when he taught Political
Science.
THE FACT that our ends are
so accustomed "to respond to ag
gressive conduct by counter
aggression and to violence by
counter violence." This is true not
only when we resort to such
overt violence as war and the
threat of war but also when we
employ tactics of deception, mis
representation, and evasion in
political discussion.
