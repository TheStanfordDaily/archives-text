Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned, CM' Eddie
and Big Jim, being of sound mind
and healthy bod(y)--or perhaps
we should say, having been of
analytic mind and workable
bod(y)—have found cause to ex
press cautious revulsion at the
consumption of that black swill
served in TMIJ in the guise of
"coffee." The word is undoubt
edly euphemistic in the extreme,

1 for the likes of that vitriolic fluid
are more suited to grace the
bowels of a bull than the intes
tinal tract of Man. Let each one J
of us aid in ihe exorcism of this
i excrement from our beloved j
| Union, that these hallowed halls
iof aeademia may once again re
trieve their former stature as
"The Coffeehouse of the West."
