# Let Us Prey
## 'Vermin Ermine' Announces Campus Group 'IGNORE' 
### R.J. DeFELICE 
A note of introduction: Wilmer
K. Flemm is a typical Stanford
freshman — bright, clean-cut, in
spired, inquisitive, and above all
else, extraordinarily happy, even
for this, the happiest of all pos
sible universities. But today his
usual exuberance has been damp
ened by an extremely perplexing
dilemma. Confused, he seeks Ihe
counsel of one Ermine Hicken
looper (Vermin Ermine), an in
dustrious graduate student of
nine years, who, like Wilmer,
hails from Jackson Hole, Wyom
ing.
Vermin Ermine: Well, hello
there, Wilmer. Why is your usual
exuberance so dampened today?
Wilmer: I went to Axe Day last
week to get in on an activity, and
it's been bothering me ever since.
I just couldn't make a decision.
Vermin Ermine: Well, I know
a little something about this
school, having been here 13 years.
Things haven't changed much
since I was a freshman. Tell me,
what did you do at Jackson Hole
High?
Wilmer: Oh, Student Body
President, yearbook editor, head
cheerleader, valedictorian, news
paper editor, all-State end, debate
team captain, President of th e
Latin Club, President of the Poly
gon Club, delegate to Boy's State,
president of my church group,
and a few others I can't remem
ber.

Vermin Ermine: Well, that >
doesn't give us much to work
with. Didn't anything appeal to !
you at Axe Day?
Wilmer: I wavered between
Rally Com and the Upper Vol
ga desk of lIR, but I was wary
of their arguments for joining.
They said it would be apathetic
not to join, but I know there is
no such lliing as apathy at Stan
ford — President Sterling himself j
said so at Freshman Convocation |
—people are just interested in j
other things. And the President
also said to watch out for these
active people. They make the
place too serious and unhappy.
Vermin Ermine: How true!
Dangers do abound with these j
radicals. Maybe you'd better stay
away from them.
Wilmer: But I don't want to be
left out. I was always in on
things at Jackson Hole High. I
even used to have lunch with the
A.ss't. Vice-Principal every other
Tuesday.
Vermin Ermine: Well, there's
only one in-group sanctioned by
the Administration. It's called
IGNORE—lnside Group Not Op
erating Real Effectively. It's a
real privilege to be a member,
and the good part is you don't I
have any rights to worry about
defending when you're in. It's
non-sectarian, and nobody wor
ries about off-campus issues. Of
course, it strictly adheres to the
liquor regulation.
Wilmer: Oh, I don't drink. It's
the one for me. I'm off to join
right away and be happy again.
Thanks a million, Ermine.

ing.
Vermin Ermine: Well, hello
there, Wilmer. Why is your usual
exuberance so dampened today?
Wilmer: I went to Axe Day last
week to get in on an activity, and
it's been bothering me ever since.
I just couldn't make a decision.
Vermin Ermine: Well, I know
a little something about this
school, having been here 13 years.
Things haven't changed much
since I was a freshman. Tell me,
what did you do at Jackson Hole
High?
Wilmer: Oh, Student Body
President, yearbook editor, head
cheerleader, valedictorian, news
paper editor, all-State end, debate
team captain, President of th e
Latin Club, President of the Poly
gon Club, delegate to Boy's State,
president of my church group,
and a few others I can't remem
ber.

Vermin Ermine: Well, that >
doesn't give us much to work
with. Didn't anything appeal to !
you at Axe Day?
Wilmer: I wavered between
Rally Com and the Upper Vol
ga desk of lIR, but I was wary
of their arguments for joining.
They said it would be apathetic
not to join, but I know there is
no such lliing as apathy at Stan
ford — President Sterling himself j
said so at Freshman Convocation |
—people are just interested in j
other things. And the President
also said to watch out for these
active people. They make the
place too serious and unhappy.
Vermin Ermine: How true!
Dangers do abound with these j
radicals. Maybe you'd better stay
away from them.
Wilmer: But I don't want to be
left out. I was always in on
things at Jackson Hole High. I
even used to have lunch with the
A.ss't. Vice-Principal every other
Tuesday.
Vermin Ermine: Well, there's
only one in-group sanctioned by
the Administration. It's called
IGNORE—lnside Group Not Op
erating Real Effectively. It's a
real privilege to be a member,
and the good part is you don't I
have any rights to worry about
defending when you're in. It's
non-sectarian, and nobody wor
ries about off-campus issues. Of
course, it strictly adheres to the
liquor regulation.
Wilmer: Oh, I don't drink. It's
the one for me. I'm off to join
right away and be happy again.
Thanks a million, Ermine.
A note of introduction: Wilmer
K. Flemm is a typical Stanford
freshman — bright, clean-cut, in
spired, inquisitive, and above all
else, extraordinarily happy, even
for this, the happiest of all pos
sible universities. But today his
usual exuberance has been damp
ened by an extremely perplexing
dilemma. Confused, he seeks Ihe
counsel of one Ermine Hicken
looper (Vermin Ermine), an in
dustrious graduate student of
nine years, who, like Wilmer,
hails from Jackson Hole, Wyom
ing.
