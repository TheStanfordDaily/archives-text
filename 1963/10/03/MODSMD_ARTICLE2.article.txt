# Student Congress Collects Over $400 for 'Mock Vote'
## 
### DANIEL SCHWARTZ 
More than $100 was collected for a "Mock Vote fur Freedom"
at the first meeting of the Stanford Student Congress held in Cub
berley last night before a capacity crowd.
The "Mock Vote" was described by speakers Dennis Sweeney,
a Wilbur Sponsor and speaker of the Congress, and Allard Lowen-

stein, a legal advisor to the civil
rights movement in Mississippi,
as an attempt to demonstrate the
willingness of the Negroes in the
South to vote.
Both speakers, retelling per
sonal experiences in the South
this summer, told of the efforts
made by civil rights groups to
register greater numbers of Ne
gro voters in the South.
THEY DESCRIBED a project
in which the Negroes who had
not been able to register in Mis
sissippi and would not have a
chance to vote in the state elec
tions, could participate in a
"mock election" in which they
could demonstrate their ability
and desire to vote. The money
collected would be used to help
finance this project.
THE PROGRAM last night was
introduced by Tom Neel, the Na
tional Student Association Co
ordinator for Stanford. Neel ex
plained that the Student Congress
had been formed Spring quarter,
1963, after the Board of Trustees
liberalized University policy so
that any open, voluntary student
organization, properly registered,
would be allowed to debate and
take stands on issues of student
concern.
Sign-up lists for the Civil Lib
erties Caucus of Political Union,
and for the Liberal. Conservative
and Independent rosters of the
Student Congress were passed
through the audience last night.
The people who signed the lists
were not committed to any posi
tion in debate but merely pro
vided a mailing list for the cau
cus and rosters.


ALLARD K. LOWENSTEIN, prominent legal advisor to the 1962 Mis
sissippi civil rights movement, takes time out for a joke before
addressing the Stanford Student Congress last night. But Lowen
stein s theme—the plight of the Negro—was serious. And so was
the capacity audience who heard his speech at Cubberley Audi
torium.

collected would be used to help
finance this project.
THE PROGRAM last night was
introduced by Tom Neel, the Na
tional Student Association Co
ordinator for Stanford. Neel ex
plained that the Student Congress
had been formed Spring quarter,
1963, after the Board of Trustees
liberalized University policy so
that any open, voluntary student
organization, properly registered,
would be allowed to debate and
take stands on issues of student
concern.
Sign-up lists for the Civil Lib
erties Caucus of Political Union,
and for the Liberal. Conservative
and Independent rosters of the
Student Congress were passed
through the audience last night.
The people who signed the lists
were not committed to any posi
tion in debate but merely pro
vided a mailing list for the cau
cus and rosters.


ALLARD K. LOWENSTEIN, prominent legal advisor to the 1962 Mis
sissippi civil rights movement, takes time out for a joke before
addressing the Stanford Student Congress last night. But Lowen
stein s theme—the plight of the Negro—was serious. And so was
the capacity audience who heard his speech at Cubberley Audi
torium.
More than $100 was collected for a "Mock Vote fur Freedom"
at the first meeting of the Stanford Student Congress held in Cub
berley last night before a capacity crowd.
The "Mock Vote" was described by speakers Dennis Sweeney,
a Wilbur Sponsor and speaker of the Congress, and Allard Lowen-

stein, a legal advisor to the civil
rights movement in Mississippi,
as an attempt to demonstrate the
willingness of the Negroes in the
South to vote.
Both speakers, retelling per
sonal experiences in the South
this summer, told of the efforts
made by civil rights groups to
register greater numbers of Ne
gro voters in the South.
THEY DESCRIBED a project
in which the Negroes who had
not been able to register in Mis
sissippi and would not have a
chance to vote in the state elec
tions, could participate in a
"mock election" in which they
could demonstrate their ability
and desire to vote. The money
collected would be used to help
finance this project.
