# Senate Allots $1.75 Billion Aid to Education Package
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS) — The
Senate Education Committee, in
a "miracle move" last Wednes
day, reported out a $1.75 billion
aid to education package.
The four-bill package was ap
proved with such speed and ease
that its chief pilot, Sen. Wayne
Morse, D-Ore., was stunned.
"It's almost a miracle," said
Morse, chairman of the Senate
Education Subcommittee. One
section of the package — the $1.5
billion "bricks and mortar" col
lege aid bill — was approved by
the parent education subcommit
tee before Morse's unit had time
to recommend it.
TO BE REPORTED to the Sen
ate, where bipartisan support is
expected, this week are these
lour bills:
• —The biggest single item, a
$1.5 billion program to aid U.S.
colleges and universities in fa
cilities construction: it would
authorize loans up to $120 mil
lion and grants totaling $180 mil
lion each year. Over the next
five years, the program would
authorize $900 million in grants
and $600 million in loans for four
year colleges, and $250 million in
grants to community colleges.
While both public and private
colleges would be eligible for the
program, the education commit
tee did inject limitations. Grant
funds would be limited to physi
cal and natural science buildings,
libraries and engineering build
ings.
Some Senators, with an eye to
a possible church-state separation
debate, were hesitant about grant
ing funds to universities with re
ligious affiliations. The limita
tions were expected to prevent
any objections.
THE HOUSE-PASSED version
of the same bill contains just
about the same limitations. How
ever, grants and loans in the
House bill were smaller—totaling
only $1.19 billion. If the Senate
version is passed, as expected, a
House-Senate conference commit
tee will reconcile the difference.
It was noted, however, that
both aid bills did not provide for
teacher's salaries.

—An expanded vocational edu
cation bill, dubbed by some as
the "junior omnibus education
package." Broadened, as re
quested by President Kennedy, it
contains three major items.
—A four-year program of fed
eral matching grants to the states
to expand vocational education.
Included are new authorizations
totaling $702 million in excess
of the current vocational pro
gram now costing about $55 mil
lion a year.
—A THREE-YEAR extension
of the National Defense Educa
tion Act (NDEA), now running
about $260 million a year. Th e
committee hiked the amount of
funds available for student loans
$195 million over present levels
for four years.
—A three*year extension of an
estimated $300 million a year in
impacted areas aid—federal as
sistance for school districts with
enrollment: swollen by children
of federal workers.
In expanding the vocational
education section, the committee
went along with the President's
civil rights recommendation to
provide commercial and indus
trial arts courses benefitting Ne
gro children. Currently, the pro
gram is limited largely to home
economic courses.
—The third bill in the big pack
age increases federal matching
grants for public libraries from
$7.5 million to $37.5 million, and
expands it to make urban as well
as rural areas eligible.
—THE FOURTH and final bill
would liberalize the student loan
forgiveness law. Proposed by
Sen. Winston Prouty, R-Vt., the
bill would permit students who
go on to teach in private as well
as public schools to write off up
to 50 per cent of any loan funds
given them while getting their
degrees.
Such a proposal was also off
ered when the President origi
nally submitted his now-parceled
omnibus education package.
While Ihe House has passed
most of the vocational education
bill, it has yet to act on the
NDEA extension and student
loan increases.
