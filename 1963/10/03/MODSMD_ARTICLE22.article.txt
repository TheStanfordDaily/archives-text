NEW YORK (UPI) — Dandy
Sandy Koufax downed the mighty
and favored New York Yankees
with .record book pitching a n d
John Roseboro blasted a three
run homer Wednesday for a tense
5 to 2 victory which gave the
Los Angeles Dodgers the opening
game of the World Series.
The slender southpaw with Ihe
blazing fast ball struck out the
first five hitters to face him,
fanned a record total of 15 hit
ters and allowed but six hits be
fore a roaring crowd of 69,000
whose cheers shook massive
Yankee Stadium.
AND THE supposedly anemic
bats of the battling Dodgers ham
mered out nine hits—including
that payoff blow by Roseboro —
to send Whitey Ford down to de
feat. Ford gave up eight hits and
five runs in five innings to suf
fer a record sixth series loss.
There were a hatful of heroes
for the underdog Dodgers as they
jumped into the lead by captur
ing the classic's opening contest.
BUT THE BIG MAN was Kou
fax even though Tom Tresh
walloped a home run with one on
in the eighth inning to spoil his
shutout.
Because Dandy Sandy, as he
fired a final third strike past
pinch-hitter Harry Bright wit h
two out in the ninth, with a tolal
of 15 strikeouts erased the 14-
strikeout record established by
Carl Erskine of Brooklyn just 10
years ago to the day.
And when he set down the first
five hitters in a row as the game
got under way—including Mickey
Mantle and Roger Maris — he
matched a mark established by
Mort Cooper of the Cardinals a
long 20 years ago.
LABELED A weak-hitting ball
club, the Dodgers" looked mighty
muscular to Ford when they stag
gered him with four hits for four
big runs in the second inning.
Frank Howard lit the fuse
when, with one out, he smashed
a cannonshot some 460 feet over
Mantle's head which struck the
centerfield wall, appropriately
painted black. The six-foot, seven
inch outfielder was held to a

double by Mantle's swift retrieve.
Then Bill Skowron, traded
away last November by the Yank
ees, slashed a single to center
which sent Howard lumbering
home with the icebreaking run.
SKOWRON MOVED on to sec
ond when Dick Tracewski .fol
lowed with a single 1o center and
Roseboro, who had hit only nine
home runs all season hit a Ford
pitch into the low right field
seats, giving the Dodgers a 4-0
lead. The Dodgers ran their lead
to 5-0 in the third with three
more hits for another run.
The Yankees got their runs
when Tom Tresh drove a home
run into the left, field stands in
the eighth inning to score Tony
Kubek ahead of him, cutting the
Dodger lead to 5-2 and costing
Koufax a shutout on the heels of
a season in which Sandy posted
11 for an all-time record for
southpaws.
"THERE WAS only one word
for this game—Koufax," said
Yankee Manager Ralph Houk.
"He was great."
Houk reiterated that he would
go in Thursday's second game
with left hander A! Downing,
who had a 13-5 record this sea
son after being called up from
the minors.
The Dodger's Walt Alston will
try to make it two in a row by
pitching Johnny Podres, a 14-
game winner who was the hero
of the Dodgers' first world cham
pionship in 1955.

NEW YORK (UPI) — Dandy

and favored New York Yankees
with .record book pitching a n d
John Roseboro blasted a three
run homer Wednesday for a tense
5 to 2 victory which gave the
Los Angeles Dodgers the opening
game of the World Series.
The slender southpaw with Ihe
blazing fast ball struck out the
first five hitters to face him,
fanned a record total of 15 hit
ters and allowed but six hits be
fore a roaring crowd of 69,000
whose cheers shook massive
Yankee Stadium.
AND THE supposedly anemic
bats of the battling Dodgers ham
mered out nine hits—including
that payoff blow by Roseboro —
to send Whitey Ford down to de
feat. Ford gave up eight hits and
five runs in five innings to suf
fer a record sixth series loss.
There were a hatful of heroes
for the underdog Dodgers as they
jumped into the lead by captur
ing the classic's opening contest.
BUT THE BIG MAN was Kou
fax even though Tom Tresh
walloped a home run with one on
in the eighth inning to spoil his
shutout.
Because Dandy Sandy, as he
fired a final third strike past
pinch-hitter Harry Bright wit h
two out in the ninth, with a tolal
of 15 strikeouts erased the 14-
strikeout record established by
Carl Erskine of Brooklyn just 10
years ago to the day.
And when he set down the first
five hitters in a row as the game
got under way—including Mickey
Mantle and Roger Maris — he
matched a mark established by
Mort Cooper of the Cardinals a
long 20 years ago.
LABELED A weak-hitting ball
club, the Dodgers" looked mighty
muscular to Ford when they stag
gered him with four hits for four
big runs in the second inning.
Frank Howard lit the fuse
when, with one out, he smashed
a cannonshot some 460 feet over
Mantle's head which struck the
centerfield wall, appropriately
painted black. The six-foot, seven
inch outfielder was held to a

double by Mantle's swift retrieve.
Then Bill Skowron, traded
away last November by the Yank
ees, slashed a single to center
which sent Howard lumbering
home with the icebreaking run.
SKOWRON MOVED on to sec
ond when Dick Tracewski .fol
