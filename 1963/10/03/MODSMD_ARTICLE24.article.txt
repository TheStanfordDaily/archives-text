Academy cad its in the main at
traction at 11 a.m. In the other
games, the freshmen take on

mine the true potential of the
high scoring Indians, but Coach
Priddle is optimistic about th e
prospects of his charges. He
stated that "if all our players
show the ability they are capable
of, it should be a good game."
EXPECTED TO provide scor

last week's game, A 1 Nnoli a n d
Klaus Bergman. Nnoli, a stand
out for the team last year in its
successful West Coast Champion
