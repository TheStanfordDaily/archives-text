The rest of the agenda will

I place in the context of a general
reappraisal of the entire Pre-Reg
Program," Wedin said.
. . . Approval of Cardinals Board.

a study, preparatory to a fuller
discussion next week."
. . . Approval of the release of
; monies for an lIR project.
.. . Several minor by-law
changes will also be considered.
"The major business," Wedin

submitted to President Sterling
for approval as members of the
President's Committees."
