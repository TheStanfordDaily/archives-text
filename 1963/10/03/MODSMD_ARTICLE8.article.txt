Virginia.
The quartet of freedom singers
come also for the purpose of con
veying through the medium of
song the spirit and strength of
the Civil Rights movement, a
spirit which the youth, intensity,
and involvement of the singers
themselves echo.
TIIKIK s()N(;s were not
created in the silent study of the
composer, but rather, in the
midst of a battle, nonviolent in

character, but a battle nonethe
less. From southern prisons and
southern sidewalks come songs
like "Woke Up This Mornin'
With My Mind On Freedom,"
composed in a cell in Albany,
Georgia; "I Know We'll Meet
Again." written in Parchman
Penitentiary during the Freedom
Rides; and "We'll Never Turn
Back," written after the murder
of a Mississippi Negro farmer
who registered to vote.
The Freedom Singers group
itself was formed in Albany last
December; since then the quartet
has travelled some 35,000 miles
giving concerts to raise money
and to explain the work of SNCC.

"Salute to Southern Freedom"
concert at Carnegie Hall in June.
Robert Shelton of the New York
Times, wrote, "The unaccom
panied voices, the rhythmic drive,
and the sense of conviction put
the Freedom Singers in the top
level of American folk groups."
ALL FOUR members of the
