FROM BLANKETS TO BACHELORS
—THE ROUTE OF OUR PLAID
SPORT JACKETS
FROM THE
FlKl UNIVERSITY SHOP
Facetious— but faci! Authorities from Saks Fifth
Avenue go io England and Scotland io choose and
create our plaids from the world's finest assort
ments of "blankets"—a technical term that refers
to experimenting for an exact blend of color. All
this takes months of planning and preparation.
The plaids are then meticulously tailored into our
own University Shop three button jacket. Most of
these woolens are exclusively ours, many are
classics, all are what bachelors of science, art or
whatever prefer. These jackets, from 55 00 to 75.00,
in the University Shop.
