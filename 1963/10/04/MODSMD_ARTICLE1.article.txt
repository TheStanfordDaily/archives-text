tempt to further the academic
impact of the Overseas Campuses
program on the home campus.
Letters have been received this
week by all alumni of the Over
seas Campuses informing them of
the formation of the organization
and their automatic membership
in ii. The association is working
in co-operation with the Overseas
Campuses Office, and is receiving

formation grew out of discussions
among members of Stanford-in-
France Group V upon their return
to campus last spring.
PROFESSOR ROBERT WALK
I;R, director of the Overseas Cam
puses Program, commented to
The Daily, "1 am delighted to see
this interest of the students that
are returning from the overseas
campuses, continuing use of the
language and maintaining theii
interest in the countries involved.
The meetings which the over
seas alumni are planning and will
bo sponsoring should be a valu
able addition to the intellectual
life of the campus."
The Association will sponsor
films, lectures, and programs in
French, German, and Italian.
They are co-operating with the
University foreign visitors' bu
reau to provide luncheons, din
ners, and campus tours for for
eign visitors in their native lan
guage. Lists are being composed
of all overseas alumni on campus
from which students will be asked
to participate in these discussions
and tours, hopefully giving all
alumni several opportunities a
year for home-campus contact
with the language and culture
with which they lived for six
months.
AT THEIR FIRST co-ordinat
ing board meeting this Monday
afternoon, the group will consider

I these programs, as well as the
possibilities of establishing hostels
with language professors and for
j eign nationals in their language,

organizations for each of the
three undergraduate campuses to
plan activities dealing with the
country of interest to them. The
co-ordinating board will have a
representative of each group of
each campus which still has un
; dot-graduates on campus.
