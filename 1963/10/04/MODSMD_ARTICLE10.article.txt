This quarter, a new effort to
link more closely together San
Francisco and Stanford Univer
| stiy will be undertaken. The Sat
urday night cultural bus program.
! a plan to provide inexpensive and
convenient transportation to cul
tural events in San Francisco,
! could develop into one of the most
I enriching programs at this uni
versity, said Rich Van Horn, co
ordinator of the program.
The cost of a round-trip ticket
will be $1.25; the tickets will be
available at the Tresidder Ticket

Office a week prior to the given
event and can be purchased at
the time of boarding the bus. The
tradition of Dutch treat is to be
encouraged in this program, said
Van Horn.
A TENTATIVE SCHEDULE
has been arranged as follows:
Oct. 2, Gilbert & Sullivan. "Prin
j cess Aida," Harding Theater,
I Contemporary Dancers; Oct. 19,

Pinter, Marine's Memorial The
| ater.
The Tresidder Ticket Office has
I agreed to sell tickets or ticket re
servations for any event to which
the bus is scheduled to take tlie
1 students. In the future, it is hoped
i that planning will be far enough
j in advance to include such activ
i ities as the opera and the Bolshoi
Ballet.
SINCE THE I'KCXiRAM hopes
to create an atmosphere of re
laxed spontaneity, it will not be
| made mandatory for the students
i to have purchased the ticket for
1 the performance before boarding
! the bus. The program is to be ini
i tinted with the attitude that the
'students are sufficiently respon
i sible to, take the fullest advan
tage of the worthwhile opportu
nities which the city has to offer.
Confidence in the students by the
program will lead to confidence
in the program by the students,"
said Van Horn.
The buses will board students
at announced times in front of
Wilbur Hall, .Roble Hall and the
Bowman Alumni Mouse.
