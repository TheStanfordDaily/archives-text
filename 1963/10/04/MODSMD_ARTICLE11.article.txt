# Letters to the Editor

### 
Editor, The Dally:
Firstly, may 1 express my dis
appointment that the Tuesday
evening lecture meeting was
closed immediately after Peter
Laslett had finished speaking,
and that there was no opportun
ity for questions. It is usually
claimed that universities are in
a special position to fulfill th e
critical examination and evalua
tion of new ideas, yet debate and
discussion on Mr. Laslett's pro
posal was precluded. This was
all the more tragic since Mr. Las
lett simply presented his idea (to
make Oxford and Cambridge Uni
versities graduate institutions)
and the background to it, without
really answering the question
"Can Oxford and Cambridge
meet Britain's Challenge for Ad
vanced Study?"
Secondly, may T voice objection
to this scheme, described by Ron
De Felice in yesterday's Daily.
The stratification which exists be
tween Oxford and Cambridge,
other British Universities (some
25 of them) and, for that matter,
Colleges of Advanced Technology
and teacher training colleges is
gradually being eroded. For ex
ample, despite government re
strictions on university budgets,
many universities are obtaining
world-wide reputations in speci
fic fields as a result of successful
research, often independently fi
nanced. Equally, increasing
standards are being formed by all
universities, partly because the
increase of relevant population
age-groups and the increased de
mand for higher education for
the members of that age-group
are outstripping the provision of
new university places. Thus,
slowly, the stratification is being
eroded and happily by a leveling
up rather than a level-down pro
cess.
Hopefully, the Robbins Com

mittce on Higher Education, due
to report shortly, will have pro
posals to accelerate this process;
changes may also be felt should
there be a change in government
shortly.
Now, were Oxford and Cam
bridge to become centers of
graduate study for the whole
country, they would be inade
quate to meet the demand for
graduate education at its present
level. They would simply cream
off the best graduates from all
over the country (apparently
only in humanities, for Mr. Las
let t made no reference to science,
and research labs are particularly
difficult to transport around the
country). Thus the existing stra
tification would be reinforced at
a higher level. No longer would
the talk be of first—and (de
creasingly) second-class Univer
sities, but of first and second
class graduate schools.
To one observer, what was pre
sented by Tuesday evening's
speaker as "radical" seems some
what reactionary.

As a librarian interested in the
use of library furniture and
equipment, I was interested to
note that in the picture of the
Bechtel Lounge, which ran in the
October 2 issue of The Daily, the
student had his foot comfortably
resting on a new coffee table.

Firstly, may 1 express my dis
appointment that the Tuesday
evening lecture meeting was
closed immediately after Peter
Laslett had finished speaking,
and that there was no opportun
ity for questions. It is usually
claimed that universities are in
a special position to fulfill th e
critical examination and evalua
tion of new ideas, yet debate and
discussion on Mr. Laslett's pro
posal was precluded. This was
all the more tragic since Mr. Las
lett simply presented his idea (to
make Oxford and Cambridge Uni
versities graduate institutions)
and the background to it, without
really answering the question
"Can Oxford and Cambridge
meet Britain's Challenge for Ad
vanced Study?"
Secondly, may T voice objection
to this scheme, described by Ron
De Felice in yesterday's Daily.
The stratification which exists be
tween Oxford and Cambridge,
other British Universities (some
25 of them) and, for that matter,
Colleges of Advanced Technology
and teacher training colleges is
gradually being eroded. For ex
ample, despite government re
strictions on university budgets,
many universities are obtaining
world-wide reputations in speci
fic fields as a result of successful
research, often independently fi
nanced. Equally, increasing
standards are being formed by all
universities, partly because the
increase of relevant population
age-groups and the increased de
mand for higher education for
the members of that age-group
are outstripping the provision of
new university places. Thus,
slowly, the stratification is being
eroded and happily by a leveling
up rather than a level-down pro
cess.
Hopefully, the Robbins Com

mittce on Higher Education, due
to report shortly, will have pro
posals to accelerate this process;
changes may also be felt should
there be a change in government
shortly.
Now, were Oxford and Cam
bridge to become centers of
graduate study for the whole
country, they would be inade
quate to meet the demand for
graduate education at its present
level. They would simply cream
off the best graduates from all
over the country (apparently
only in humanities, for Mr. Las
let t made no reference to science,
and research labs are particularly
difficult to transport around the
country). Thus the existing stra
tification would be reinforced at
a higher level. No longer would
the talk be of first—and (de
creasingly) second-class Univer
sities, but of first and second
class graduate schools.
To one observer, what was pre
sented by Tuesday evening's
speaker as "radical" seems some
what reactionary.
