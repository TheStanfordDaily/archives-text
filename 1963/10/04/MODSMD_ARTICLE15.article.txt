## Civil Rights or Tax Cut, But Not Both 
### 
This is one of those moments when there is reason to wonder
whether the congressional system as it now operates is not a grave
danger to the Republic. There are two great measures before Con
gress, and in all probability Senator Goldwater was right when he
said the other day that "the President has to make up his mind
whether he wants the civil rights bill or a tax cut, because he cannot
get them both."
This situation is a reflection on the Congress. For the truth is
that the two measures are not competitive, but complementary. If
the tax bill can do what its advocates believe it can do, that is to
say stimulate business and reduce unemployment, it will reduce
some of the pressures which are making it so difficult for the leaders
of the Negro people to continue to be moderate, non-violent, patient
and reasonable.
The civil rights bill promises the Negroes the chance to vote,
better schooling and an end to humiliation in public accommodations.
But the tax bill promises the Negroes jobs. They need them. The
rate of unemployment among Negroes is a little more than twice
as great as among the whites.
The Negroes, thereafter, have an acute interest in a measure
that promises to overcome the sluggishness of the economy. Today,
for example, the Negro rate of unemployment is over 11 r /c, when the
economy was booming, Negro unemployment was less than s'/<.
Anyone who is serious about dealing with the Negroes' griev
ances must, therefore, be distressed to find that he has to choose
between the tax bill and the civil rights bill. A competent Congress,
which was equal to the realities of our time, would see that the
two measures are closely related and would act on them accordingly.
But there is something more in all this than the lack of serious
and realistic understanding of what is at stake. This Congress has
gone further than any other within memory to replace debate and
decision by delay and stultification. The President first announced
his plan to seek a reduction of taxes in order to stimulate the econ
omy on Aug. 13. 1962. That was over a year ago. A tax bill passed
the House last week, but the Senate has not even begun to hold
hearings.
The reason for this delay is that there is a considerable body
of strong opinion in Congress and in the country which is opposed
to any tax cut until spending is cut down Though I happen to think
that it is impossible to balance the budget when the economy is
running so much below capacity, and that an attempt to deflate
now would produce a recession, the views of the opposition to a tax
cut are honorable and deserving of respect. The issue, which is real,
should be debated for as long as it takes to debate it thoroughly.
But there should be a roll call and a decision at the end of the debate.
I do not see how a modern government can be conducted suc
cessful if on a major issue, such as fiscal policy, the Executive is
refused for more than a year a debate and a decision. If Congress
agrees with Senator Byrd, it ought to debate and then defeat the
tax bill. What is becoming alarming and intolerable is a Congress
which will smother and stultify rather than debate and decide.
This is a furtive and degenerate form of the filibuster. In my
view, the open filibuster —that is to say. protracted debate—can
normally be justified and accepted as a way pf mitigating the absqlu
tism of numerical majorities. If I Were a senator, I \frould ; be very
loathe to vote for cloture. But I would vote for it now, because the
times are not normal and a critical emergency exists.
The national security requires, I believe, the passage in the near
future of a civil rights bill which constitutes a declaration by the
federal government that all the remaining badges of slavery and
servitude are outlawed.
