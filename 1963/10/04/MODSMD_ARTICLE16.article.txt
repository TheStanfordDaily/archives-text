NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (CPS)
â€”What happens whon a college
student is arrested trying to
register Negroes for the vote in
Georgia? In the case of Don
Harris, field Secretary for th e
Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee (SNCC) arrested Aug
ust 8 in Americus, Geo., his en
tire alma mater, Rutgers Univer
sity in New Jersey, pitched in to
help him.
Students, working through cam
pus organizations or a coordinat
ing committee, prepared petitions,
sent letters, planned demonstra
tions, and talked to state and fed
eral officials. Money for Harris'
defense was contributed by the
Student Council, the Inter-Fra
ternity Council, Harris' fratern
ity, and hundreds of individual
students.

But lawyers for the National
Association for the Advancement
of Colored People (NAACP) said
a lot more has to be done before
Harris, a New York resident, and
two other SNCC field secretaries,
Ralph Allen of Massachusetts,
and John Perdew of Colorado, are
freed.
The three have been held with
out bail since August 8 on
charges of attempting to incite
insurrection. The charge carries
a maximum penally of death in
Georgia.
The charges arise out of a mass
voter education meeting in the
Friendship Baptist Church the
night of August 8. About 250 Ne
groes, mostly teenagers, learned
about registration procedures
from the SNCC field secretaries,
then filed out of the church.
