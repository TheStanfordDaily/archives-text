# Hayakawa Blames Racial Strife on TV
## 
### JOHN THAYER 
Television is the immediate
cause of the unrest in the South
today, declared Dr. S. I. Haya
kawa, Professor of English at ,
San Francisco State College, in I
the opening lecture of that col
lege's new series. "Faculty Fo
cus."
Taking as his title "Communi
cation: Interracial and Interna-!
tional," Hayakawa presented uni
que insights into the causes, im
mediate and ultimate, of racial
unrest in the United States. Be
cause it bypasses literacy and
provides entertainment at home,
thus avoiding the humility of seg
regated movie houses, television
is extremely popular among Ne
groes. Further, since from a pro
duction point of view, television
is too expensive to be supported
by a minority group, it is ad
dressed to the whole community,
Negro as well as white.
FINALLY, television exists to
sell its products to its viewers.
Therefore, it. preaches each per
son's right to be "a member of
the national community of Amer
icans," to consume as he pleases.
In reality, however, the Southern
Negro discovers that he is denied
this right. So he demonstrates in
protest. This is especially true of
the young Negro, with whom the

leaders of the integration move
ment "are breathlessly trying to
keep up."
There is a widespread feeling
among whites, Hayakawa con
tinued, that Ihe Negro must learn
the self-respect he demands by
ameliorating the undesirable con
ditions in which he lives. This, he
contended, fails to take into ac
count the barriers which the Ne
gro encounters in trying "to
make a life for himself in o u r
culture." He has no cultural tra
dition available to him, a tradi
tion which would (1) provide him
with goals which he could live
up to. and (2) give him a firm
foundation upon which to build
his life. Hayakawa said it is re
markable that the Negro has pro
gressed as far as he has in view
of this great cultural deficiency.
Further, the responsibility for
the Negro's lack of a cultural
tradition must be assumed by the
North; for it failed to carry to
completion its program of Re
construction after the Civil War.
It abolished only slavery, and
not the "entire caste system
which was devised to take its
place." It thus denied the Negro
the help he needed to raise him
self out of the slave culture in
which he had been living.
EVER SINCE, the whites have
effectively ignored the problem
of the Negro, possibly because
they felt that the end of the Civil
War was the end of the problem.
Now they are learning, to their
horror, that the problem was hot
solved by the surrender of the
Conferate armies at Appomattox.
Indeed, it has been increasing
rather than diminishing in the
intervening years. The situation
is such now that it cannot be
shrugged off. Something must be
done.
Hayakawa suggested that effec
tive communication between the
white and the Negro must begin
now if racial relations are to im
prove. The mass media, especi
ally television, are already doing

| their part in helping whites and
i Negroes develop "the same kind
i of value systems," and thus in
; creasing racial tolerance. It re
mains, then, to exploit this re
i source more fully.
On the international level, con
; eluded Hayakawa, our efforts to
rectify the "injustices of the
past" will increase our stature
as a free nation and give re
newed hope to those millions in
our globe who are not free.

On the international level, con

as a free nation and give re

Television is the immediate
cause of the unrest in the South
today, declared Dr. S. I. Haya
kawa, Professor of English at ,
San Francisco State College, in I
the opening lecture of that col
lege's new series. "Faculty Fo
cus."
Taking as his title "Communi
cation: Interracial and Interna-!
tional," Hayakawa presented uni
que insights into the causes, im
mediate and ultimate, of racial
unrest in the United States. Be
cause it bypasses literacy and
provides entertainment at home,
thus avoiding the humility of seg
regated movie houses, television
is extremely popular among Ne
groes. Further, since from a pro
duction point of view, television
is too expensive to be supported
by a minority group, it is ad
dressed to the whole community,
Negro as well as white.
FINALLY, television exists to
sell its products to its viewers.
Therefore, it. preaches each per
son's right to be "a member of
the national community of Amer
icans," to consume as he pleases.
In reality, however, the Southern
Negro discovers that he is denied
this right. So he demonstrates in
protest. This is especially true of
the young Negro, with whom the

leaders of the integration move
ment "are breathlessly trying to
keep up."
There is a widespread feeling
among whites, Hayakawa con
tinued, that Ihe Negro must learn
the self-respect he demands by
ameliorating the undesirable con
ditions in which he lives. This, he
contended, fails to take into ac
count the barriers which the Ne
gro encounters in trying "to
make a life for himself in o u r
culture." He has no cultural tra
dition available to him, a tradi
tion which would (1) provide him
with goals which he could live
up to. and (2) give him a firm
foundation upon which to build
his life. Hayakawa said it is re
markable that the Negro has pro
gressed as far as he has in view
of this great cultural deficiency.
Further, the responsibility for
the Negro's lack of a cultural
tradition must be assumed by the
North; for it failed to carry to
completion its program of Re
construction after the Civil War.
It abolished only slavery, and
not the "entire caste system
which was devised to take its
place." It thus denied the Negro
the help he needed to raise him
self out of the slave culture in
which he had been living.
EVER SINCE, the whites have
effectively ignored the problem
of the Negro, possibly because
they felt that the end of the Civil
War was the end of the problem.
Now they are learning, to their
horror, that the problem was hot
solved by the surrender of the
Conferate armies at Appomattox.
Indeed, it has been increasing
rather than diminishing in the
intervening years. The situation
is such now that it cannot be
shrugged off. Something must be
done.
Hayakawa suggested that effec
tive communication between the
white and the Negro must begin
