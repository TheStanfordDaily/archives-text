Twenty-one thousand jobs are
registered at the Stanford Place
ment Services. Thousands of
would-be employers: manufactur
ing firms, Federal agencies,
schools and universities, service
organizations—all are eager for
Stanford graduates.
Nor do you need to be a hand%
some, dedicated student of phy
sics to be eligible for the major
ity of these positions. Many firms
will take, say, an undirected an

thro major and put him through |
a training program lasting any-1
where from six weeks to two
years. For their investment they
will get a junior executive with
both broad educational back
ground and first-hand knowledge
of their way of doing things.
THE PLACEMENT SERVICES
offers a wide range of aids to
Stanford students and alumni. An
undergraduate stymied on th e
choice of a major will find sym
pathetic ears and objective eyes,
people willing to discuss relative
merits without the natural bias
of an academic advisor. (The
Counseling and Testing Center
can give still more concrete ad
vice in this vein.)
A graduating senior—or Mas
ters or Doctoral candidate — can
sel up a permanent file of refer
ences, pictures, and job data.
This material is sent by the
Placement Services to prospective
employers at the student's re
quest — saving him much trouble
and his reference-writers a great
deal of pestering.
The firm, if kept up to date,
can serve the graduate all his
life. Ten, fifteen, twenty years
later, when he is seeking a better
job, the people of the placement
services are as willing as ever to
discuss possibilities and contact
employers. Groups trying to fill
important positions such as busi
ness managers and university
presidents contact the office here.
The services write to alumni
whose files indicate they might
be interested in these jobs.
MORE AND MORE JOBS are
opening for women. "Don't be
discouraged by the listings in The
Daily," warns Mrs. Evans, "there

are many places that don't inter
view on campus." In fact, only
about 700 of the thousands of em
ployers send representatives;
most contacts are made by mail.
In line with the orientation of
the services to find the most
suitable job for the individual
rather than merely a desk and a
paycheck Mrs. Evans welcomes
gills at any point in their college
years.
Hints to girls considering ca
reers: "Of course, in the glamor
fields advertising, publishing
pay is low. "I hate to tell any
one to take shorthand, but really,
even a six-week speed writing
course helps to put a foot in the
door. It's a good idea to take
the Civil Service exams. If you
pass, you start at GS-7. that's
$160 a month. The average is
$350.
THE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS
are each managed by people with
broad personal contacts in their
areas. Dr. Boyce, overall director,
takes particular care of students
interested in professional admin
istration. Mr. Lowe places men
in business, Mr. Williams handles
scientists and engineers, and Mrs.
Evans works with women in all
fields, and with teachers. M r s.
Cochran, with two telephones
constantly ringing, is in charge
of part time and temporary .jobs.
Most of the jobs listed at Stan
ford are naturally in California.
However, the office has direct
contact with many employers
across the nation — and beyond.
In addition it maintains recipro
cal arrangements with all the ma
jor colleges and universities in
the United States and Canada,
so that students wishing to estab

lish good contacts for work far
from here can take advantage of
local knowledge of opportunities.
THE SERVICES also list a
limited number of overseas posi
tions. However, these jobs are
likely to be highly specialized and
experience is often required.
Undergraduate counseling, part
lime work, summer jobs, life
time careers, the Placement Serv
ices are well equipped and eager
to help with all. Any student is
welcome to consult with them,
and registration early in the sen
ior year is encouraged.

so that students wishing to estab

lish good contacts for work far
from here can take advantage of
local knowledge of opportunities.
THE SERVICES also list a
limited number of overseas posi
tions. However, these jobs are
likely to be highly specialized and
experience is often required.
Undergraduate counseling, part
lime work, summer jobs, life
time careers, the Placement Serv
ices are well equipped and eager
to help with all. Any student is
welcome to consult with them,
and registration early in the sen
ior year is encouraged.

Officers for Phi Alpha Delta,
the campus law fraternity, are
Bob Huskinson, president; Bob
Hall, vice president; Paul Ulrieh,
treasurer; Dennis Cowan, clerk;
and Rudy Steury, marshal.
Twenty-one thousand jobs are
registered at the Stanford Place
ment Services. Thousands of
would-be employers: manufactur
ing firms, Federal agencies,
schools and universities, service
organizations—all are eager for
Stanford graduates.
Nor do you need to be a hand%
some, dedicated student of phy
sics to be eligible for the major
ity of these positions. Many firms
will take, say, an undirected an

thro major and put him through |
a training program lasting any-1
where from six weeks to two
years. For their investment they
will get a junior executive with
both broad educational back
ground and first-hand knowledge
of their way of doing things.
THE PLACEMENT SERVICES
offers a wide range of aids to
Stanford students and alumni. An
undergraduate stymied on th e
choice of a major will find sym
pathetic ears and objective eyes,
people willing to discuss relative
merits without the natural bias
of an academic advisor. (The
Counseling and Testing Center
can give still more concrete ad
vice in this vein.)
A graduating senior—or Mas
ters or Doctoral candidate — can
sel up a permanent file of refer
ences, pictures, and job data.
This material is sent by the
Placement Services to prospective
employers at the student's re
quest — saving him much trouble
and his reference-writers a great
deal of pestering.
The firm, if kept up to date,
can serve the graduate all his
life. Ten, fifteen, twenty years
later, when he is seeking a better
job, the people of the placement
services are as willing as ever to
discuss possibilities and contact
employers. Groups trying to fill
important positions such as busi
ness managers and university
presidents contact the office here.
The services write to alumni
whose files indicate they might
be interested in these jobs.
MORE AND MORE JOBS are
opening for women. "Don't be
discouraged by the listings in The
Daily," warns Mrs. Evans, "there

are many places that don't inter
view on campus." In fact, only
about 700 of the thousands of em
ployers send representatives;
most contacts are made by mail.
In line with the orientation of
the services to find the most
suitable job for the individual
rather than merely a desk and a
paycheck Mrs. Evans welcomes
gills at any point in their college
years.
Hints to girls considering ca
reers: "Of course, in the glamor
fields advertising, publishing
pay is low. "I hate to tell any
one to take shorthand, but really,
even a six-week speed writing
course helps to put a foot in the
door. It's a good idea to take
the Civil Service exams. If you
pass, you start at GS-7. that's
$160 a month. The average is
$350.
THE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS
are each managed by people with
broad personal contacts in their
areas. Dr. Boyce, overall director,
takes particular care of students
interested in professional admin
istration. Mr. Lowe places men
in business, Mr. Williams handles
scientists and engineers, and Mrs.
Evans works with women in all
fields, and with teachers. M r s.
Cochran, with two telephones
constantly ringing, is in charge
of part time and temporary .jobs.
Most of the jobs listed at Stan
ford are naturally in California.
However, the office has direct
contact with many employers
across the nation — and beyond.
In addition it maintains recipro
cal arrangements with all the ma
jor colleges and universities in
the United States and Canada,
so that students wishing to estab

lish good contacts for work far
from here can take advantage of
local knowledge of opportunities.
