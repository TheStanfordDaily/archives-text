# Panofsky Finds No 'Researchâ€™ Gap

### BILL EPMIER 
"The gap between U.S. and So
viet research has stayed constant
at five years in our favor." This
was the conclusion of Prof. W.
K. H. Panofsky, Director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, after his recent trip to Rus
sia to review the high energy re
search installations there. He gave
his speech yesterday before a
large crowd at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.
RUSSIA IS NO NEWCOMER
to the field of high energy re
search. They built their first cy
clotron in 1935. Since then they
have made impressive, and often
over-estimated, advances in the
field. At the moment they are
building the world's largest accel
erator.
Panofsky found several serious
weaknesses in the Soviet pro
gram. Chief among them is their
mania for secrecy. Russian scien
tists do not have the chance to
supervise the construction of the
machines they or der. In fact, they
are not even allowed to know
where they are constructed.
ANOTHER HINDRANCE is the
separation of Soviet research
from the universities. Also, there
is a lack of incentive among the
workers. Though a hard worker
gets considerable fame, his salary
does no rise.
On the personal side, the U.S.
scientists are dying to meet for
eigners. The Americans were so
pestered by questions that they
set up a list on which the Rus
sians could write down their ques
tions. Often they expresed bitter
ness at their isolation.
Panofsky said his group, which
included seven from Stanford,
had the unprecented opportunity
to see anything they wanted to.
Such freedom is not even allowed
to top Soviet scientists. Panofsky
hopes his visit is a "pilot" in free
exchange of science between our
country and Russia.
