# Tribe to Face Bruins in Big Six Opener
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
A hopefully rejuvenated Stan
ford squad in search of a victim
in general and an AAWII victim
in particular tomorrow goes
against the UCLA Bruins, a
young steam definitely on the up
swing although up to this date
winless. The game will pit a team
who lost its momentum a n d is
| trying to regain it against a team
who has momentum.
Coach John Ralston expects a
very close game saying that it
would he a mistake to call either
team a favorite.
All week long, Ralston and aides
have been bailing out the sloppy
play that leaked into Stanford's
offensive and defensive machin
ery last Saturday. Ralston said
that performances in the practice
sessions this week have provided
strong indications that a definite
bouncing back will come about.
The Bruins come to Stanford
young and inexperienced not be
cause of key injuries to upper
classmen nor because of a lack
of upperclass lettermen but be
cause of fine individual soph
omore talent. A senior fullback
expected to provide the nucleus of
a fine running attack and Capt.

Walt Dahe, a tackle, have both
been beaten out by sophomores.
Another sophomore, Bob Rich
ardson, also will start in the Bruin
backfield.
Stanford will enter the game
in good physical shape. Only Carl
Schrader and John James, both
middle of the line reserves, will
be unable to see action. All full
backs are back in the lineup. Soph
Glenn Myers, a first game stand
out until injured, will wear a
special hinged harness to protect
his shoulder. Ralston is counting
on Tony DeLellis, normally a de
fensive specialist, for extensive
offensive work in the fullback
slot. Dan Conaway, Dick Rags
dale, and end Frank Patitucci,
each have sat out several prac
tices this week because of injuries
but are scheduled for all-out duty
tomorrow.
UCLA, reports Ralston, has a
balanced offense of running and
passing with a slight emphasis
on its aerial attack. Look for
Bruin quarterback Larry Zeno to
zero in on Mel Profit, a fast, sure
handed end who stands 6-5 and
tips the scales at 208 lbs. Leading
Uclan receiver, Profit was voted
AAWU lineman of the week and
has gathered in 4 passes for 66
yards and a touchdown.
Making comparisons with a
year-old encounter is oftentimes
dangerous and misleading, but
the similar circumstances are in
triguing. Last year, Larry Zeno,
only a sophomore, earned himself
a shot at the starting quarter
back spot in the Stanford game
by playing a major role in ihe 9-7
upset of Ohio Stale the week be

fore. This year, delegated to sec
ond string duties in UCLA's first
two games, he broke into the lime
light again a week before meet
ing Stanford by leading a second
half surge against Penn State
with his passing and running.
Against Stanford last year, Zeno
threw five misguided aerials that
alert Cards intercepted and a lat
eral that Patitucci hauled in and 1
turned into a touchdown. This
year, who knows? Maybe his- I
tory will repeat itself.

Coach John Ralston expects a
very close game saying that it
would he a mistake to call either
team a favorite.
All week long, Ralston and aides
have been bailing out the sloppy
play that leaked into Stanford's
offensive and defensive machin
ery last Saturday. Ralston said
that performances in the practice
sessions this week have provided
strong indications that a definite
bouncing back will come about.
The Bruins come to Stanford
young and inexperienced not be
cause of key injuries to upper
classmen nor because of a lack
of upperclass lettermen but be
cause of fine individual soph
omore talent. A senior fullback
expected to provide the nucleus of
a fine running attack and Capt.

Walt Dahe, a tackle, have both
been beaten out by sophomores.
Another sophomore, Bob Rich
ardson, also will start in the Bruin
backfield.
Stanford will enter the game
in good physical shape. Only Carl
Schrader and John James, both
middle of the line reserves, will
be unable to see action. All full
backs are back in the lineup. Soph
Glenn Myers, a first game stand
out until injured, will wear a
special hinged harness to protect
his shoulder. Ralston is counting
on Tony DeLellis, normally a de
fensive specialist, for extensive
offensive work in the fullback
slot. Dan Conaway, Dick Rags
dale, and end Frank Patitucci,
each have sat out several prac
tices this week because of injuries
but are scheduled for all-out duty
tomorrow.
UCLA, reports Ralston, has a
balanced offense of running and
passing with a slight emphasis
on its aerial attack. Look for
Bruin quarterback Larry Zeno to
zero in on Mel Profit, a fast, sure
handed end who stands 6-5 and
tips the scales at 208 lbs. Leading
Uclan receiver, Profit was voted
AAWU lineman of the week and
has gathered in 4 passes for 66
yards and a touchdown.
Making comparisons with a
year-old encounter is oftentimes
dangerous and misleading, but
the similar circumstances are in
triguing. Last year, Larry Zeno,
only a sophomore, earned himself
a shot at the starting quarter
back spot in the Stanford game
by playing a major role in ihe 9-7
upset of Ohio Stale the week be

fore. This year, delegated to sec
ond string duties in UCLA's first
two games, he broke into the lime
light again a week before meet
ing Stanford by leading a second
half surge against Penn State
with his passing and running.
Against Stanford last year, Zeno
threw five misguided aerials that
alert Cards intercepted and a lat
eral that Patitucci hauled in and 1
turned into a touchdown. This
year, who knows? Maybe his- I
tory will repeat itself.
A hopefully rejuvenated Stan
ford squad in search of a victim
in general and an AAWII victim
in particular tomorrow goes
against the UCLA Bruins, a
young steam definitely on the up
swing although up to this date
winless. The game will pit a team
who lost its momentum a n d is
| trying to regain it against a team
who has momentum.
