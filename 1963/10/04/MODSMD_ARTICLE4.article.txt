# Banned Students: Cuba Improves
## 
### DAVID BARNUM 
Equal measures of applause
and hissing greeted the presenta
tion last evening of four of the
American students who traveled
to Cuba this summer in defiance
of the State Department's ban on
travel to that country.
Fred Goff successfully handled
the unruly capacity crowd which
had come to tSern's Holladay
House to hear first-hand the im
pressions which the students had
gotten of the present situation in
Cuba.
According lo Anatole Anton.
Stanford graduate student, there
were four issues of particular in
terest to the visiting students. A
real democracy does exist in
Cuba today, he said, though it is
democracy defined in socialist
terms. The Cuban government
assumes the Revolution to have
been a legitimate and necessary
undertaking, and the people who
"benefited" by it are expected to
express their approval.
Economic chaos exists in the
country, he said further, in con
sequence of the extensive but in
experienced bureaucracy which
has been established to cope with
economic affairs.
When asked by the visiting stu
dents how it felt about the cur
rent disunity which prevails in
the socialist camp, the govern
ment of Cuba was reluctant to
voice any opinion. The people,
however, were almost preoccupied
with discussing the implications
of the rift among themselves.'
On the question of the accom
plishments of the Revolution, the
students expressed their unanim
ous opinion that "most people
seem to be much better off." The
standard of living of the upper
and middle classes has dropped,
because very few consumer goods
are available in Cuba, even for
those with sufficient incomes.
Anton attributed the scarcity of
consumer goods to the blockade
which this country has thrown
up around Cuba, and to Cuba's
present emphasis on heavy indus
try.
Speaking of the students' open
defiance of the State Depart
ment's travel ban, Anton said the
overriding consideration was not
the political affiliations of the stu
dents, many of whom were of ex
treme liberal orientation, while
others were simply interested in
ascertaining the real conditions in
Cuba, but rather the Constitu
tional right of American citizens
to travel anywhere.
When asked by a listener
whether he was a member of the
Communist Party, one of the
speakers replied, "It's none of
your business. I have my beliefs,
and I shall maintain them whether
vou like it or not."

however, were almost preoccupied
with discussing the implications
of the rift among themselves.'
On the question of the accom
plishments of the Revolution, the
students expressed their unanim
ous opinion that "most people
seem to be much better off." The
standard of living of the upper
and middle classes has dropped,
because very few consumer goods
are available in Cuba, even for
those with sufficient incomes.
Anton attributed the scarcity of
consumer goods to the blockade
which this country has thrown
up around Cuba, and to Cuba's
present emphasis on heavy indus
try.
Speaking of the students' open
defiance of the State Depart
ment's travel ban, Anton said the
overriding consideration was not
the political affiliations of the stu
dents, many of whom were of ex
treme liberal orientation, while
others were simply interested in
ascertaining the real conditions in
Cuba, but rather the Constitu
tional right of American citizens
to travel anywhere.
When asked by a listener
whether he was a member of the
Communist Party, one of the
speakers replied, "It's none of
your business. I have my beliefs,
and I shall maintain them whether
vou like it or not."
Equal measures of applause
and hissing greeted the presenta
tion last evening of four of the
American students who traveled
to Cuba this summer in defiance
of the State Department's ban on
travel to that country.
Fred Goff successfully handled
the unruly capacity crowd which
had come to tSern's Holladay
House to hear first-hand the im
pressions which the students had
gotten of the present situation in
Cuba.
According lo Anatole Anton.
Stanford graduate student, there
were four issues of particular in
terest to the visiting students. A
real democracy does exist in
Cuba today, he said, though it is
democracy defined in socialist
terms. The Cuban government
assumes the Revolution to have
been a legitimate and necessary
undertaking, and the people who
"benefited" by it are expected to
express their approval.
Economic chaos exists in the
country, he said further, in con
sequence of the extensive but in
experienced bureaucracy which
has been established to cope with
economic affairs.
When asked by the visiting stu
dents how it felt about the cur
rent disunity which prevails in
the socialist camp, the govern
ment of Cuba was reluctant to
voice any opinion. The people,
however, were almost preoccupied
with discussing the implications
of the rift among themselves.'
