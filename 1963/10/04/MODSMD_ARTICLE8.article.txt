# LASSU Protests Sterling's Change In Selecting Students for Committees
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
Yesterday evening LASSU
adopted, with one dissenting vote,
a resolution objecting in principle
to President Wallace Sterling's
announced decision to change the
method by which students are se
lected to serve on University com
mittees.
The LASSU resolution further
proposed a method of selection,
deemed equitable and consistent
with ASSU's function as a repre
sentative organization, by which
President Sterling would choose
student committee members sole
ly from among those on a slate
submitted by a designated ASSU
committee.
THE LEGISLATURE mandated ;
ASSU President Bud Wedin to j
investigate the reduction of stu-1
dent representation on the Stu
dent Affairs and Services Com- |
mittee and the committee on Pub-1
lie Exercises. The mandate was
approved following a unanimous
vote to table a motion and on j
amendment regarding the reduc
tion of student representation,!
one condemning the move and the
other amending the condemna
tion and calling for an inquiry
into the reduction.
The Principle of the adopted
resolution on selection of student
committee members stated "The
Legislature of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University |
firmly believes in the usefulness !
of student participation on cer
tain University committees; that:
those students who are chosen to
serve should be representative
of the best capabilities and inter- j
est of the student body; that the j
aim of such participation should j
be to broaden the perspective of i
committee deliberation through
expression of student viewpoints
and opinion; that the expression
of student opinion should be a
serious and sincere effort to co- i
operate with faculty and adminis
tration; that the presentation of i
a student viewpoint can only j
claim validity if these students,
are chosen in some democratic
maner by those whose viewpoint i
they are to represent; and that'
any other method of selection is
inconsistent with the aims of stu
dent participation on these com
mittees."
The LASSU resolution further
declared. "In striving to insure
a consistently high level of qual
ity of student service on Univer
sity committees, the LASSU
urges adoption of the following i
policy:
1. The Legislature shall desig
nate a committee of three to in
terview all students interested in

serving on University commit-1
tees on which students are invited
to sit. The committee shall con
sist of the President of this Asso
ciation and two members of this
Legislature.
2. It shall be the business of
this committee to determine on
the basis of interest and capabil
ity those students most qualified
to be presented to the President
for his selection.
3. This committee shall draw
up a list for each University com
mittee consisting of not fewer
than two nominees for each open
ing on that committee which,
pending the approval of this
Legislature, shall be submitted
to the President of the Univer
sity."
In the course of debate, Wedin
noted that of the five University
committees on which students
are invited to sit the Student Af
fairs and Services Committee, i
the Committee on Public Exer
cises, the Committee on Public
Health, the PACE Committee,
and the Athletics Committee
student representation has been
reduced on the two committees
most vital to student interests,
namely the Student Affairs and
Services Committe and the Com
mittee on Public Exercises.
WEDIN REVEALED that dur
ing the past summer, student
representation on the Student
Affairs and Services Committee
was cut from last year's number
of five to thre, and that student
membership on the Committee
on Public Exercises has been re
duced from seven to three, both
with no reduction in the number
of faculty members.
The three student members of
the Committe on Public Exer
cises are to have full voting
rights, in contrast to last year
when seven student members did
not, officially, enjoy voting privi
leges. Wedin reported, however,
that the students did. in fact,
vote in all meetings with the ex
ception of the final meeting. At
this time they were informed, ac
cording to Wedin, that they were
not officially allowed to vote.
Wedin related the reasons Ster
ling gave him for the reduction
of student committee members.
According to Wedin, the Presi
dent said that the committees
themselves had recommended
the changes.
WEDIN NOTED, "However,
since the last committee meetings
were held last spring with stu
dents on them, I would assume
that this was not a complete com
mittee decision, especially con
sidering a statement from the

President's Committee of Stu
dent Affairs and Services com
mending the students on the
committee. I would assume this
decision was made on a higher
level."
In addition to the passage of
the resolution, LASSU business
included a by-laws change mak
ing the selection of the pre-regis
tration committee the product
of Wilbur, Branner, and Roble
sponsors in addition to the
former selector of ASSU and the
incumbent pre-reg chairmen.
