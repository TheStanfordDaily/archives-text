# Text of Wedin’s Inaugural Address
## 
### 
One essential component in the
make-up of a University is a free
and open atmosphere that encour
ages and channels all types of
critical action and critical think
ing. To presume that a Univer
sity would not lose some essential
thing if this atmosphere were not
continually nurtured is, of course,
unrealistic. To further presume
that an open exchange of view
points and perspectives is not a
vital part of this atmosphere
would also he unrealistic.
It is, I believe, one obligation
of all persons who are in posi
tions of responsibility at this or
any university to make every
effort both to express the view
points they may represent and to
insure that the opportunity for
others to do the same is most
sacredly preserved.
THE ASSURANCE that one
group will receive more than tok
en response from another is at
times more difficult to guaran
tee; yet the efforts to hear and
be heard should never cease—
for once they do. these positions
of responsibility will become posi
tions of acceptability and, hence,
their very underlying priciples
will have been abdicated. And
the abdication of this responsibil
ity could conceivably endanger
the open forum that a university
must be.
I am not prefacing the initial
proceedings of this body with any
implications that such an open
and free atmosphere does not
exist. I am more concerned with
indicating the course that stu
dents must pursue if we are to
maximize our responsibility in
maintaining that essential com
ponent of which I spoke earlier.
1 would presume that the ten
dency now might be for this body
to neglect the responsibilities of
which I have spoken. II is large
the obvious inclination would
be to minimize the importance
of the individual contribution. It
is new and, as such, has not in
herited a tradition that might
have established its role as a
critical student organization. Yet.
although this may be the ten
dency, it is not the logic. For, pre
cisely because we are a repre
sentative body and because we
arc not hampered by precedent
and past tradition we can justify
our existance as a viable, criti
cal organization. An organization
that will serve as a tool for im
plementing the critical though
and that must come from the stu
dent community.
IN THIS CONNECTION there
are a few points to which I would
like to speak. First, there is the
scope of such thought and action
as defined in terms of the Legis
lature. In other words which con
eerns are of relevance to us, and
which are not. Although I find
difficulty in placing limits on
what this duly elected, repre
sentative student organization
should or should not deem a rele
vant topic for discussion, the
facts say differently. By the
Trustees Policy decision of last
year we have been restricted to
deliberating on issues termed
"student affairs on the Stanford
campus."
Yet, I would suggest and urge
that the limitation of our deliber
ations to "student affairs on the
Stanford Campus" need not at all
compromise our effectiveness in
j critically and relevantly dealing
| with these affairs. I would fur
ther indicate that many concerns
| wil come before us which will
' elicit different interpretations
about our right to deal with them.
I believe it is best to maximum
the scope of our interpretation,
rather than risk the consequences
| of accepting too defined an inter
pretation. Until such time that
we may officially deal with the
"extra-campus" affairs that we
are so concerned about, this, I
hope, will be our philosophy.
I would further fear that one
might rationalize away the in
herent right of this body to con
cern itself with all possible issues
and questions by interpreting the
role of the Stanford Student Con
gress as a supplement to th is
Legislature. Granted that its
creation was a function of the
Trustees redefination of the ex
tent of the Legislature's pur
view, this by no means justifies
such a supplemental interpreta
tion. There is, in fact, nothing
inherent in the nature of either
organization that would limit
both from discussing issues of an
identical nature, namely any con
cerns that are relevant to student
interests at Stanford. It must be
realized that each justifies its
own existence, the one as the
official, representative voice of
the student community, the other
as a forum for debate and dis
cussion open to any interested
members of the Stanford com
munity.
HISTORICALLY speaking, the
precedent has been established
that a legislative body does, in
deed, take thought and action in
matters of direct concern to its
members. In this context we
should do the same and make
every effort possible too include
within our purview a flexibility
that will allow for consideration
of the maximum rather than the
minimum interpretation of what
student concerns should also be
our property.
In assessing what tone we must
adopt in fulfilling our role as an
integral component in the crea
tion of an open and free atmos
phere and in operating most ef
fectively to voice the student
viewpoint I am reminded of my
first days at Stanford.
When President Sterling ad
dressed our Freshman Class in
1961, he said that the great pe

rogative of a private university
was not the freedom of speech
or expression, but rather the
freedom to experiment. It was in
this context that those of us pres
ent entered Stanford University.
FOR ME, THE PHRASE, "free
dom to experiment" had two
levels of interpretation. At the
first and most obvious level it
means a freedom for the Univer
sity to set its own policies and
attitudes, to carry on freely any
type of activity or research, to
control its own curriculum and
educational machine. (In essence
it is the freedom of the Univer
sity to be responsible only to
itself.) At this level the freedom
is exercised by those who design
the policies and the structure of
the University, or what might be
termed the "officialdom" of th e
University.
But there is another interpreta
tion of the freedom to evperi
ment, one whose perogative is
not as often recognized but which
is just as vital to a university.
This is the student right to free-

dom of experimentation. Too
often the term is counched in
padded cliches and acquires a
meaningles definition of "free
dom within a defined framework
of activity and responsibility," or
"responsible freedom." But when
ever student action and concern
arise in areas that lie outside the
delegated framework, its true na
ture is revealed in an interesting
and obvious irrationality: this
delegated framework and does
not reflect the particular con
cerns and interests of the student
community; instead, the student
community must adjust these
concerns and interests to the
existing framework.
Not only does this fail to stim
ulate great dialogues of student
concern but it also imposes a
needless loss on the University;
for it is in these very areas out
side the traditional sphere of stu
dent action where students can
make the most meaningful con
tributions to Stanford. Involve
ment of students in curriculum
study and change, student-faculty
committees, formation of certain
policies, and teacher and course
evaluation are examples of such
worth of such student action is to
areas. To question the right and
question the value and respon
-5 sizility of student opinion. As evi
i denced by past gains, by the type
of people involved in student gov
ernment, and by the respect that
we have gained, the latter ques-
I tion is unrealistic.
TWO FURTHER conclusions
can be drawn from such a phil
osophy of student action: First,

it is based on the committment
that students have relevant,
worthwhile ideas that can con
tribute in Stanford's growth to
ward becoming a great univer
sity, and here I want to under
line the distinction between be
coming and being. Secondly, such
student involvement will neces
sarily result in a better atone
ment of policy and structure to
the real nature of the University.
And it is this second point, based
upon the first that is necessary
for Stanford or any other insti
tution to be a great university.
It is in this tradition that we
should, as students, constantly
question and probe, evaluate and
change. We should hold nothing
right until proven; nothing
wrong until tried. We should
look at ourselves, at the Univer
sity and at the world in an effort
to define our goals, to evaluate
our education, and to seek a
course of action during these
freest years of our lives. It is
in this spirit that I propose stu
dent government operate this
year, that it initiate and stimu
late interest in these areas a n (I
that it work toward achieving
definite results itself. If it does
not do this. then student govern
ment is not exercising its right
ful freedom to experiment and,
furthermore, is abrogating its
responsibility to both the student
body and the University. And in
this process it is. indeed true that
the threat of mistake or even
failure that it is not nearly so
ominous as the danger of not act
ing at all.
