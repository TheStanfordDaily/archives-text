# Text of Wedin’s Inaugural Address
## 
### 
One essential component in the
make-up of a University is a free
and open atmosphere that encour
ages and channels all types of
critical action and critical think
ing. To presume that a Univer
sity would not lose some essential
thing if this atmosphere were not
continually nurtured is, of course,
unrealistic. To further presume
that an open exchange of view
points and perspectives is not a
vital part of this atmosphere
would also he unrealistic.
It is, I believe, one obligation
of all persons who are in posi
tions of responsibility at this or
any university to make every
effort both to express the view
points they may represent and to
insure that the opportunity for
others to do the same is most
sacredly preserved.
THE ASSURANCE that one
group will receive more than tok
en response from another is at
times more difficult to guaran
tee; yet the efforts to hear and
be heard should never cease—
for once they do. these positions
of responsibility will become posi
tions of acceptability and, hence,
their very underlying priciples
will have been abdicated. And
the abdication of this responsibil
ity could conceivably endanger
the open forum that a university
must be.
I am not prefacing the initial
proceedings of this body with any
implications that such an open
and free atmosphere does not
exist. I am more concerned with
indicating the course that stu
dents must pursue if we are to
maximize our responsibility in
maintaining that essential com
ponent of which I spoke earlier.
1 would presume that the ten
dency now might be for this body
to neglect the responsibilities of
which I have spoken. II is large
the obvious inclination would
be to minimize the importance
of the individual contribution. It
is new and, as such, has not in
herited a tradition that might
have established its role as a
critical student organization. Yet.
although this may be the ten
dency, it is not the logic. For, pre
cisely because we are a repre
sentative body and because we
arc not hampered by precedent
and past tradition we can justify
our existance as a viable, criti
cal organization. An organization
that will serve as a tool for im
plementing the critical though
and that must come from the stu
dent community.
IN THIS CONNECTION there
are a few points to which I would
like to speak. First, there is the
scope of such thought and action
as defined in terms of the Legis
lature. In other words which con
