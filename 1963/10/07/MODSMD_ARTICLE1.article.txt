# UCLA Downs the Indians On Late Pass Interception
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
Living and dying by the intercepted pass, a powerful but not con
sistent Stanford football team tell before a good but not superior
UCLA squad. The leader in total offense for the afternoon. Stanford
won its share of battles, but lost the war, 10-9.
Both scores resulted indirectly from intercepted passes. In the

second quarter. Craig RitcheyH
nabbed a partially blocked Larry
Zeno sideline pass on the Bruin
22. Two plays later a Thurlow to j
Howard running pass carried |
Stanford into the lead.
UCLA ACCOUNTED for its
only TD in a similar manner
early in the fourth quarter. Stan
ford's Dick Berg threw a sideline
pass short allowing Bob Richard- j
son to pick it off and return it 39 !
yards to the Cardinal 5. From
this point UCLA put across the
equalized in two plays. Zeno then
booted the margin of victory.
The game was a mistake-in
fested contest that produced few
sustained drives. Because of the
way that penalties successfully
halted Card drives, especially in
the first half, it can be said that
the penalty is mightier than the|
sword.
STANFORD soon had the ball. !
but an offside penalty stopped i
tho Cards before they were on the !
move. The next time the Tribe
had the ball it moved from its j
own 20 to the Bruin 37. On t he ,
next play, however, a holding |
penalty forced Stanford back into ;
its ovyn territory with a third and ,
sixteen situation instead of a i
first and ten at the UCLA 35.
Almost halfway into the second i
quarter, a delaying penalty
moved the ball back from UCLA's }
three yard line where Braden [
Beck missed his first of three un- j
successful placements.
Definitely not a second half:
team t his year, Stanford has only |
scored 14 points in this half, none I
in the last two games. This scor- j
ing weakness became more glar- {
ing when Stanford lost its first i
string quarterback, a co-captain j
and fine team leader, late in the
third quarter due to a knee in- j
jury. After this, the strands of j
the Stanford offense were still
there, but a Weaver by the name j
of Clark was missing.
STANFORD FUMBLED almost
as much as it did last game, send- j
ing six bouncing footballs on thej
