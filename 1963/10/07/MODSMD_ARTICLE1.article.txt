# UCLA Downs the Indians On Late Pass Interception
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
Living and dying by the intercepted pass, a powerful but not con
sistent Stanford football team tell before a good but not superior
UCLA squad. The leader in total offense for the afternoon. Stanford
won its share of battles, but lost the war, 10-9.
Both scores resulted indirectly from intercepted passes. In the

second quarter. Craig RitcheyH
nabbed a partially blocked Larry
Zeno sideline pass on the Bruin
22. Two plays later a Thurlow to j
Howard running pass carried |
Stanford into the lead.
UCLA ACCOUNTED for its
only TD in a similar manner
early in the fourth quarter. Stan
ford's Dick Berg threw a sideline
pass short allowing Bob Richard- j
son to pick it off and return it 39 !
yards to the Cardinal 5. From
this point UCLA put across the
equalized in two plays. Zeno then
booted the margin of victory.
The game was a mistake-in
fested contest that produced few
sustained drives. Because of the
way that penalties successfully
halted Card drives, especially in
the first half, it can be said that
the penalty is mightier than the|
sword.
STANFORD soon had the ball. !
but an offside penalty stopped i
tho Cards before they were on the !
move. The next time the Tribe
had the ball it moved from its j
own 20 to the Bruin 37. On t he ,
next play, however, a holding |
penalty forced Stanford back into ;
its ovyn territory with a third and ,
sixteen situation instead of a i
first and ten at the UCLA 35.
Almost halfway into the second i
quarter, a delaying penalty
moved the ball back from UCLA's }
three yard line where Braden [
Beck missed his first of three un- j
successful placements.
Definitely not a second half:
team t his year, Stanford has only |
scored 14 points in this half, none I
in the last two games. This scor- j
ing weakness became more glar- {
ing when Stanford lost its first i
string quarterback, a co-captain j
and fine team leader, late in the
third quarter due to a knee in- j
jury. After this, the strands of j
the Stanford offense were still
there, but a Weaver by the name j
of Clark was missing.
STANFORD FUMBLED almost
as much as it did last game, send- j
ing six bouncing footballs on thej
turf. Luckily for the Indian
cause, only one ended up in
enemy hands as compared with
six of seven last game.
Against a highly regarded de
fensive line. Stanford runners got
fine offensive blocking and did
a commendable job. Four run
ners bettered 4 yards a carry

Glenn Myers, D a n Conaway,
Steve Thurlow, and Clark Weav
er. Fullback Myers led with a 5.9
average.
Barring fumbles or penalties,
Stanford has the potential to
steadily move the ball on the
ground against any team.
WITH BUT a minute remain
ing in the haLf, Ritchey made his
interception and the Stanford
rooters were again alert. On sec
ond down, Howard lunged in the
right corner of the end /one and
came up with Thurlow's aerial
for the touchdown.
A blocked punt attempt in the
third quarter gave Stanford the
ball on the Bruin 28. Playing the
game of you help me, I'll help
you, Stanford fumbled away the
opportunity.
Dick Berg, replacing the in

jured Weaver, led a drive to the
25 where Beck was short with a
field goal. UCLA's White fielded
the ball on ihe goal line and while
maneuvering in the end zone
was brought down by Ray Hand
ley for a safety.
Only two minutes later, Bob
Richardson had intercepted a
Berg pass. From the Stanford
five, halfback John White skirted
left end for the score.
Mike Connelly led the final In
dian attempt at victory. The team
moved well, but the clock forced
Beck, on the last play of the
game, to try a field goal from
the UCLA 45.
TWO STANFORD defensive
standouts. Craig Ritchey and
Frank Patitucci respectively re
ceived recognition by the press as
Back and Lineman of the Game.
