# Keys Believes Russia Wants Disarmament

### NORMAN GREEN BERG 
"I am absolutely convinced
j that the Russians desperately
| want disarmament." Donald Keys,
: Program Director of the National
j Committee for a Sane Nuclear
| Policy, spoke confidently last Fri
day at Tresidder Union, for he
felt that war and the fear of war
are about to cease.
KEYS FEELS that the Rus
sians and the United States are
now "in phase" in their wishes.
The hard-line groups in epch na
tion have been overswayed. and
the pressure of world opinion is
coming to bear heavily upon the
powers.
Keys credits the peril in Cuba
with the change, for the real
threat of nuclear war finally and
dramatically presented itself.
And what might have been in
tended for the summit conference
folowing the U-2 affair has now
occurred. The treaty, the Moscow-
Washington hot-line, and Russia's
willingness to endanger her posi
tion with allies are all significant
preliminary steps.
BUT STILL OBSTACLES re
main. The USSR remains aloof
to inspection within her borders.
And yet, Keys said, *'I neve r
thought the Russians would ac
cept the eventual necessity of a
U.N. police force. Furthermore,
in the United States, "The Senate
has been over-sold on the diffi
culty of inspection."
Difficulties exist, but increased
sensitivity is now possible, and
the cost of digging caverns so
large as to muffle nuclear explo- j
sions (a condition that Edward !
Teller fears) become prohibitive, j
I The question of the dissemina- i
| lion of nuclear capability has fur- 1
ther motivated the current on-1
tente, and there is evidence that i
the pressure of world opinion is
exercising an effect on bo th
France and China, said Keys, add-!
ing, "I hope there will be in- j
| creased pressure to bring China i
I into the disarmament talks."
A JOINT VENTURE to the
| moon, a possible exchange of in
spection teams, a joint reduction
| of the production of nuclear ma
terials, and the creation of nu-j
I clear free zones highlight th e I
i road to peace in the future. Keys
predicted, for the cost of the
I arms race is becoming unbear
-1 able and its course is too sinister, j
