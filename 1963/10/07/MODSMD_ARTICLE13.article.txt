# Campus Voice to Challenge University Sales Ruling
## 
### 
The "Campus Voice" in a letter to President Wallace Sterling
announced their intent to distribute on campus this morning, in do
fiance of the University ruling of last week.
Simultaneous with the denial of the Campus Voice petition for
campus distribution was approval for sale of the magazine in the

union store by the Tresidder
Union Board.
FREDERICK GLOVER, Execu
tive Assistant to President Ster
ling, declined to state to The
Daily what steps the University
will take, if any. He noted, "No
doubt if University regulations
are broken the University will
take appropriate action, if we
think it necessary."
Glover went on to say, "We
would not allow the Chronicle or
the Examiner to do what this
group wants to do. It has not
been banned. We control solicita
tion here just as we would with
vacuum cleaner salesmen: we
prevent our students from being
harried. They are able to do all
kinds of things to be distributed
legally, such as using Union
newsstand."
The "Voice' forwarded to The
Daily a copy of their letter to the
President. The letter, reprinted
below, was signed by co-editor
Richard Rubacher.
THIS LETTER is to inform you
that five members of The Cam
pus Voice staff and student-volun
teers from San Francisco State,
the University of California at
Berkeley, San Jose State an d
Stanford University, are entering
the public community of Stan
ford University on Monday, Octo
ber 7th. Our purpose is to dis
tribute issue 14 of the Bay Area
student-faculty publication, The
Campus Voice. We are scheduled
to sell the magazine at Stanford
for two days before we proceed
to our next distribution point —
Berkeley.
As you already know, The Cam
pus Voice is a bi-weekly maga
zine. This means we will be dis
tributing copies at Stanford for
two days every other week.
We respectfully present you
with three alternatives. One—the
university security guards can
shoot down the members of The
Voice when we appear at S t a n
ford. This action will effectively
slience us for a rather long per
iod.
TWO — the Stanford Adminis
tration can sue The Campus
Voice for "trespassing on private
property." In this case we will
happily go to .jail and await trial.
Our attorney in San Jose is con
fident that we will win the case
as he will claim that freedom of
the press under the First Amend
ment has priority over "trespass
ing on private property." I will
briefly explain o u r position so
there will be doubt in your mind
as to our feelings on this matter.
By its very nature, freedom of
the press also entails freedom of
dissemination. I ask you, what
good is having all this freedom to
publish The Campus Voice if we
do not have its necessary col
lorary — the freedom to dissemi
nate?
The third alternative is for you
to uphold the idea of the univer
sity and not harrass. disturb, in
terfere with, or bother us in any
way when we come to distribute
copies next Monday and Tuesday.
This approach is,without a doubt,
the most honorable one for you
and for Stanford University it
self.
I, Ernie Berry, the other staff
members, and the student-volun
teers await your reply. If we do
not hear from you before Mon
day, October 7th. we will assume
that the third alternative will be
your approach.
