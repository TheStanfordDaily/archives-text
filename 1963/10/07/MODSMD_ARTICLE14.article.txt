# What is This 'Religion' Issue?
## 
### 
The so-called "tost case" of religion at Stanford lias made
the full round. It has become muddled and confused, and
the dialogue about it has had little to do with religion.
The leader of a Stanford religous group applied for class
room facilities to teach a language class, a music class, and
a class in Jewish history, lie applied under the Board of
Trustees ruling of last year opening University facilities to
sectarian groups. lie was refused on the basis of another
University policy which denies instruction privileges on cam
pus to anyone other than a Stanford faculty member. It is
here that one finds the onset of confusion. The University
has yet to provide a workable definition of the difference
between discussion and instruction.
Last Friday evening it was discovered that the courses in
question would be barred from the Women's Clubhouse as
well. The Women's Clubhouse is not a University building.
It is independently owned, was constructed through contri
butions by the women of the university, and is governed by
its own executive board. However, the statement of the
Executive Committee of the Academic Council referred to
instruction "on the campus," as opposed to instruction in Uni
versity facilities. The President's office informed the chairman
of the executive board of the Women's Clubhouse that the
clubhouse is a part of the campus, and must come under the
President's ruling. The "test case' then concludes not only
with distinctions between discussion and instruction, but be
tween the campus and the University, as well.
Throughout this case, the Daily has been speaking editori
ally of bringing complete religious freedom to the campus,
an issue perhaps technically separate from decisions surround
ing the "test case." Before the Ilillel request ever became
news, the Daily stated editorially that along with other "prob
lems,"' Stanford is a University without freedom of religion.
This stand was a reflection of a definition of freedom of
religion in the absolute, which includes freedom of worship.
The Daily stand is, and has been, that there are only two
ways to remove any sectarian religious character from the
University: entertain all religious groups within the campus
structure, or bar all. The latter alternative, that followed by
the Supreme Court in reference to elementary and secondary
schools, is in any case debatable at the level of a private uni
versity. The latter alternative would also involve brick-bv
brick removal of Memorial Church, a ludicrous proposal
for reasons of architectural symmetry at the very least.
Given the presence of Memorial Church, the Daily has
expressed the belief that the University can only develop a
non-sectarian character by permitting all religious faiths on
the campus on an equal plane, all being permitted to offer
the same type of religious instruction and worship service that
Memorial Church offers for one large group of students.
The time has come to begin a calm discussion of religion
at Stanford: what is its role now and what should it be. The
Daily is beginning research into the history of religion at
Stanford, and will attempt to bring in-depth reporting of the
question to its readers. Other University groups are approach
ing the same question at this level. Perhaps we are now ready
for a judicious discussion of religion in a way appropriate to
an academic community. Perhaps religion itself will actually
become the topic of discussion.
