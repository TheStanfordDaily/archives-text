# NSA Was and Is the Product Of International Conflict
## 
### JAMES HAAS Vice-President, IIR 
Students within the past two
decades have become an impor
tant factor in international af
fairs. Being a distinct and in
many cases a powerful elite in un
derdeveloped countries they have
great influence and have even
precipitated changes in the gov
ernments of their countries.
Around this new force, two inter
national student organizations
have developed: the International
Union of Students supported by
the Eastern bloc countries and
the International Student Confer
ence supported by the NSA and
other Western countries.
The course of international stu
dent affairs have had a determin
ing influence on the growth and
orientation of the NSA. The
early history of the Association
is primarily centered on interna
tional affairs. By viewing the
NSA through the perspective of
its international involvement and
especially its early history, one
can get a good insight into the
reasons for its existence, the
limitations that it has always
confronted, and the role that it
does play.
DURING THE WAR a number
of informal meetings were held
in England by exiled students in
volved in resistence work a n d
representatives from the allied
countries to discuss their hopes
for the world afterwards.
The English meetings led to
the call for a constitution assem
bly to form an international stu
dent organization dedicated to
the preservation of democracy,
world peace and practical student
cooperation on such matters as
travel and exchange. The first
meeting of the lUS was held in
Prague in the summer of 1946
and the students who went were
in general sincere, idealistic, and
unsuspecting of any ulterior mo
tives on the part of any of the
participants.
AT THE MEETINGS the East
ern countries forced majorities
on issues by demanding for or
against fascism votes. The hand
of the Russian authorities was
felt heavily on the event. By this
time the American Catholic stu
dents were maintaining that th e
meeting was a communist plot.

and fighting in the plenaries to
safe guard the rights of the min
orities. By the end, the Ameri
cans and Europeans were con
cerned but they decided to con
tinue to participate for the time
being.
Most of the returning Ameri
cans believed certain clarifica
tions were in order before they
could join the lUS and all agreed
that a national organization
would have to be formed to rep
resent American students inter
nationally. By the following sum
mer enough work had been ac
complished to call a meeting at
Madison, Wisconson to form the
United States National Student
Association. After much heated
debate the delegates agreed to
join the lUS only after certain
changes were made. In the mean
time several European unions de
cided not to join the lUS because
of its partisan polical direction.
In 1947 and 1948 the relations
between the NSA and the lUS be
came more and more strained.
They were finally broken because
of the Czech coup of February,
1948.
THE lUS refused to take a
stand and the NSA severed rela
tions. Many other European dis
affiliated along with the NSA.
The lUS became more blaytenlly
partisan. This marked the end of
the attempt to unite the interna
tion student world into one or
ganization for no organization
which was wholly commited to
one side of the ideological battle
could command the allegiance of
all.
In the summer of 1949 the dis
senting unions meet in London
to discuss the difficulties related
with the lUS. By 1950 they agreed
that a new international organi
zation should be formed which
could truly allow all points of
view. The first meeting of the
International Student Conference
was held in Stockholm of that
year. The lUS labeled it as a
Western bloc organization im
mediately.
Since the time of its formation
the ISC has become more a n d
more political because of the pres
sure of unions from underde
veloped countries for support of
their stands against dictatorship
and colonialism. The lUS lately
has tried to look less partisan

while the ISC has never lost the
stigma placed on it as a bloc or
ganization. Countries of unions
with third power views tend to
belong to both.
THESE EVKNTS have had a
profound effect on the activities
of the NSA. The impetus for its
founding came from international
causes. The international prob
lems have always been more im
mediate and the emphasis of, ac
tivities of the Association have
remained there.
The domestic program has al
ways been the weak sister be
cause with the decentralized edu
cation system of this country it
is more difficult to define pro
jects and pursue them. Since its
early days the Association has
l)cen thrown into the rigors of
the cold war. It has been the sole
American agency investigating

and influencing student commu
nities around the world and con
sidering the work is done by near
amateurs and volunteers, they
have achieved an admirable rec
ord. Because of its involvement
in the cold war it lias been very
easy to get funds for interna
tional activities. In fact the In
ternational Commission has al
ways been self-sufficient while
the domestic activities have had
to limp along on the meager dues
and other hand outs.
The domestic activities of the
Association are continually criti
cized for not doing enough or for
not doing it in the right places.
This is because of the interna
tional orientation it has. It is
ironic that the Association is con
tinually criticized domestically
as leftist when overseas it is
labeled as fascist.
