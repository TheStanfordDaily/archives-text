Editor, The Daily:
Graduate students in ait here
this term are finding themselves
in quite a predicament so far
the University has refused to
give them space in which to paint,
and consequently they are being
forced to locate, rent, and equip
their own studios off campus, a
time-consuming, difficult (consid
ering the Palo Alto landlord), and
prohibitively expensive task, com
parable to requiring graduate
students in chemistry and physics
to find and outfit their own labs.
Of course, if it were unable to
provide its graduates in the
sciences with adequate lab space
and with the best and most mod
ern of equipment, the University
would be acutely embarrassed.
That it is not when the graduates
in question are in art, that in
fact it sees no reason to provide
them with any space whatsoever,
lays bare just that sort of shame
ful (and hopefully unconscious)
discrimination against art in par
ticular and the humanities in gen
eral which the University has
done so much in recent years to
eradicate.
It is unthinkable that this de
nial of the least aid which a stu
dent in art can expect of hi s
university should continue. They
surely will be given space some
time; I only hope that the Uni
versity will do so soon.
And then begin to look for
space adequate for the instruc
tors.

(The following paragraphs
are excerpts and ideas em
bodied in past letters to the
Daily. They do not reflect the
ideas of the Institute of Inter
national Relations.)
The Pcace Corps has been in
existence just over two years and
has yet to remedy the faults that
attracted criticism at its incep
tion. The volunteers are still giv
en just six weeks to six months
to absorb the language, customs
and history of a country, plus a
smattering of diplomacy. This
cannot prepare them for the
squalor and poverty they will
meet or for the. cultural shock in
adjusting to different patterns of
thought. Nor are they qualified
to recognize and counter political
and psychological attacks by
trained Communist opponents.
The fault of the Peace Corps
lies in its very idealism, which
blinds its members to the some
times far from idealistic methods

necessary in the ideological
struggle. The Peace Corps ha s
frequently been compared to the
Childrens' Crusade of the 12th
century, offering to slaughter a
group of "organized do-gooders
on a cloud of philanthropy and
good intentions" with "no sense
of mission beyond that do doing
the work of society or proving
their personal amiability."
The roots of this difficulty lie
in the lack of definition of broad
aims and methods of the Peace
Corps. Despite declarations to
the contrary, it is inevitably seen
as an arm of American foreign
policy. Voluteers have been
charged by Africans with coming
to Africa to spread "American
imperialist propaganda" or "to
spy on what you are doing."
There is a common fear that they
will extend the sphere of the cold
war.
If Peace Corpsmen are trying
to "sell America," how good a
job are they doing? With loosely
defined aims and methods comes
frustration when little is accom
plished. Volunteers inevitably
j suffer lonliness, boredom, and
awkwardness in building pro
grams likely to collapse, or at
least suffer from noncontinunity,
when they leave. Some volun
teers have quit and some have
cracked due to the mental adjust
ments that must be made. The
charge that international inci
dents would be caused has been
validated by the Margery Michel
more postcard affair. Though
they live like natives, as prom
ised, many volunteers take lux
ury trips on vacations, destroying
the carefully-built image of the
industrious, frugal American. In
addition, the Peace Corps in Af
rica has duplicated work being
done by the International Co
operation Administration.
The Peace Corps cannot avoid
being political, and when its
members are inadequately trained
with only a vague idea of what
to do or how to do it, it cannot
be an effective tool in the Cold
War. People in the position of
receiving charity from another
country do not want to be ma
nipulated to benefit the foreign
policy of that country. Like any
other aid program, once commit
ments are made they must be
continued, so that the Peace
Corps evolves ultimately into
kind of a do-it-yourself State
Department in which highly
trained specialists, so badly
needed in our own country, are
turned into ineffectual day-labor
ers abroad.

Graduate students in ait here
this term are finding themselves
in quite a predicament so far
the University has refused to
give them space in which to paint,
and consequently they are being
forced to locate, rent, and equip
their own studios off campus, a
time-consuming, difficult (consid
ering the Palo Alto landlord), and
prohibitively expensive task, com
parable to requiring graduate
students in chemistry and physics
to find and outfit their own labs.
Of course, if it were unable to
provide its graduates in the
sciences with adequate lab space
and with the best and most mod
ern of equipment, the University
would be acutely embarrassed.
That it is not when the graduates
in question are in art, that in
fact it sees no reason to provide
them with any space whatsoever,
lays bare just that sort of shame
ful (and hopefully unconscious)
discrimination against art in par
ticular and the humanities in gen
eral which the University has
done so much in recent years to
eradicate.
It is unthinkable that this de
nial of the least aid which a stu
dent in art can expect of hi s
university should continue. They
surely will be given space some
time; I only hope that the Uni
versity will do so soon.
And then begin to look for

The Pcace Corps has been in
existence just over two years and
has yet to remedy the faults that
attracted criticism at its incep
tion. The volunteers are still giv
en just six weeks to six months
to absorb the language, customs
and history of a country, plus a
smattering of diplomacy. This
cannot prepare them for the
squalor and poverty they will
meet or for the. cultural shock in
adjusting to different patterns of
thought. Nor are they qualified
to recognize and counter political
and psychological attacks by
trained Communist opponents.
The fault of the Peace Corps
lies in its very idealism, which
blinds its members to the some
times far from idealistic methods

necessary in the ideological
struggle. The Peace Corps ha s
frequently been compared to the
Childrens' Crusade of the 12th
century, offering to slaughter a
group of "organized do-gooders
on a cloud of philanthropy and
good intentions" with "no sense
of mission beyond that do doing
the work of society or proving
their personal amiability."
The roots of this difficulty lie
in the lack of definition of broad
aims and methods of the Peace
Corps. Despite declarations to
the contrary, it is inevitably seen
as an arm of American foreign
policy. Voluteers have been
charged by Africans with coming
to Africa to spread "American
imperialist propaganda" or "to
spy on what you are doing."
There is a common fear that they
will extend the sphere of the cold
war.
If Peace Corpsmen are trying
to "sell America," how good a
job are they doing? With loosely
defined aims and methods comes
frustration when little is accom
plished. Volunteers inevitably
j suffer lonliness, boredom, and
awkwardness in building pro
grams likely to collapse, or at
least suffer from noncontinunity,
when they leave. Some volun
teers have quit and some have
cracked due to the mental adjust
ments that must be made. The
charge that international inci
dents would be caused has been
validated by the Margery Michel
more postcard affair. Though
they live like natives, as prom
ised, many volunteers take lux
ury trips on vacations, destroying
the carefully-built image of the
industrious, frugal American. In
addition, the Peace Corps in Af
rica has duplicated work being
done by the International Co
operation Administration.
The Peace Corps cannot avoid
being political, and when its
members are inadequately trained
with only a vague idea of what
to do or how to do it, it cannot
be an effective tool in the Cold
War. People in the position of

charge that international inci
dents would be caused has been
validated by the Margery Michel
more postcard affair. Though
they live like natives, as prom
ised, many volunteers take lux
ury trips on vacations, destroying
the carefully-built image of the
industrious, frugal American. In
addition, the Peace Corps in Af
rica has duplicated work being
done by the International Co
operation Administration.
The Peace Corps cannot avoid
being political, and when its
members are inadequately trained
with only a vague idea of what
to do or how to do it, it cannot
be an effective tool in the Cold
War. People in the position of
receiving charity from another
country do not want to be ma
nipulated to benefit the foreign
policy of that country. Like any
other aid program, once commit
ments are made they must be
continued, so that the Peace
Corps evolves ultimately into
kind of a do-it-yourself State
Department in which highly
trained specialists, so badly
needed in our own country, are
turned into ineffectual day-labor
ers abroad.

Editor, The Daily:
Graduate students in ait here
this term are finding themselves
in quite a predicament so far
the University has refused to
give them space in which to paint,
and consequently they are being
forced to locate, rent, and equip
their own studios off campus, a
time-consuming, difficult (consid
ering the Palo Alto landlord), and
prohibitively expensive task, com
parable to requiring graduate
students in chemistry and physics
to find and outfit their own labs.
Of course, if it were unable to
provide its graduates in the
sciences with adequate lab space
and with the best and most mod
ern of equipment, the University
would be acutely embarrassed.
That it is not when the graduates
in question are in art, that in
fact it sees no reason to provide
them with any space whatsoever,
lays bare just that sort of shame
ful (and hopefully unconscious)
discrimination against art in par
ticular and the humanities in gen
eral which the University has
done so much in recent years to
eradicate.
It is unthinkable that this de
nial of the least aid which a stu
dent in art can expect of hi s
university should continue. They
surely will be given space some
time; I only hope that the Uni
versity will do so soon.
And then begin to look for
space adequate for the instruc
tors.

(The following paragraphs
are excerpts and ideas em
bodied in past letters to the
Daily. They do not reflect the
ideas of the Institute of Inter
national Relations.)
The Pcace Corps has been in
existence just over two years and
has yet to remedy the faults that
attracted criticism at its incep
tion. The volunteers are still giv
en just six weeks to six months
to absorb the language, customs
and history of a country, plus a
smattering of diplomacy. This
cannot prepare them for the
squalor and poverty they will
meet or for the. cultural shock in
adjusting to different patterns of
thought. Nor are they qualified
to recognize and counter political
and psychological attacks by
trained Communist opponents.
The fault of the Peace Corps
lies in its very idealism, which
blinds its members to the some
times far from idealistic methods

necessary in the ideological
struggle. The Peace Corps ha s
frequently been compared to the
Childrens' Crusade of the 12th
century, offering to slaughter a
group of "organized do-gooders
on a cloud of philanthropy and
good intentions" with "no sense
of mission beyond that do doing
the work of society or proving
their personal amiability."
The roots of this difficulty lie
in the lack of definition of broad
aims and methods of the Peace
Corps. Despite declarations to
the contrary, it is inevitably seen
as an arm of American foreign
policy. Voluteers have been
charged by Africans with coming
to Africa to spread "American
imperialist propaganda" or "to
spy on what you are doing."
There is a common fear that they
will extend the sphere of the cold
war.
If Peace Corpsmen are trying
to "sell America," how good a
job are they doing? With loosely
defined aims and methods comes
frustration when little is accom
plished. Volunteers inevitably
j suffer lonliness, boredom, and
awkwardness in building pro
grams likely to collapse, or at
least suffer from noncontinunity,
when they leave. Some volun
teers have quit and some have
cracked due to the mental adjust
ments that must be made. The
