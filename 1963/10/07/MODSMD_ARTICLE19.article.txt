## 
### JUSTIN BECK Sports Editor 
Stanford quarterback Clark
Weaver suffered a knee injury
in Saturday's loss to UCLA that
could put him out for the season.
Coach John Ralston said yester
day. Weaver was injured on a
roll out in the third quarter of
the game. At the time Stanford
was leading 9-3.
Weaver was made first string
quarterback by Ralston in spring
practice last year, as last year's
regular quarterback Steve Thur
low and reserve quarterback Dick
Ragsdale switched to halfback.
Ralston sairl Weaver suffered
a torn ligament in his knee and
would be lost "for a long time,
possibly the whole season." An
operation may be necessary to
repair the damage.
The Stanford coach said no de
cision had been made as to who
would take over as first string
quarterback. Soph quarterbacks
Dick Berg and Mike Connelly,
currently the second and third
string quarterbacks, are consid
ered as the most likely choices.
However, Ragsdale, currently the
team's leading rusher and scorer
at half, may be switched to Weav
er's position In any event Thur
low would definitely remain at
halfback, Ralston said.
Weaver, a senior in his second
year of varsity football, had been
particularly outstanding in the
Big Game of last year, throwing
three touchdown passes in the
last half to beat Cal 30-13, and
in the San Jose game of this
year, when he threw only Iwo
passes, both for touchdowns in
a 29-13 win.
