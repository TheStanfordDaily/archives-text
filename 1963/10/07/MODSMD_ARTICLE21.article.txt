# Miscues Concern Ralston As Indians to Face Rice
## 
### ROGER MAGNUSEN 
The mood of the locker room
matched that of the depressing,
grey afternoon Saturday as a
somber Jo h n Ralston talked
about the one point 10-9 defeat
his Stanford charges had suffered
at the hands of UCLA earlier in
the day.
ASKED WHY the Indians were
jumping off side so often in the
first half, Ralston replied that
"we were trying many audi hies
at the line of scrimmage, a n d
this may have had an adverse
effect on our timing. But. all in
all. I believe we had good success
with most of our audibles."
The pass-run option play re
sponsible 112 or Stanford's only
touchdown was called from th e
bench, said Ralston. "We h a d
practised the play during the
week, and I felt that this was the
right opportunity for us to try
it."
He also took responsibility for
the call of the field goal, when

the Indians were threatening late
in the first half and had a 4th
down and three situation deep in
UCLA territory. He added that
the "Ihe ball was just barely to
the right of the uprights and, of
course, as the game finally came
out, it could have made a great
deal of difference for us."
RALSTON SAID also thai the
last 45 yard field goal attempt,
with only one second remaining
on the clock, had a "one out of
8 chance of being good. Braden
Beck can kick them that far, but
its very difficult to control be
cause he needs a running start."
The coach said he believed that
the hard-luck defeat would not
cause any morale problems
against Rice next week. "O u r
boys have always risen to the oc
casion and I'm sure that I won't
have any problems getting them
up mentally for the remaining
games at all. Today, we were
just too inconsistent and spotty
in our play, just too inconsist
ent."
