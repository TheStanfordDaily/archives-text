An all-campus women's singles
and doubles tennis tournament
beginning October 9. and co-rec.
tennis games every Friday after
noon starting October 4 highlight
this month's calendar of events
for the Women's Recreation Asso
ciation.
Also on the agenda for the fall
quarter is the Women's Invita
tional Fencing Meet which the
WRA will host on November 2.
Teams from several northern
California colleges will compete
in this event.
The vVIiA Board, under the
leadership of Sue Williams, has
recently approved two measures,
the first calling for the expendi
ture of $2,000 for glass back
boards for the Women's Basket
ball Court.
"We hope that these backboards
will last as long as the gym re
mains standing," remarks Sue.
"The backboards will be used by
the regular women's PE classes
as well as our extra-mural
teams," she emphasizes.
In its second project, the board
is attempting to obtain sports
equipment for each of the wom
en's residences. -Representatives
of the residences have been asked
to submit lists of what the girls
would like in equipment to the
WRA Board.
"In this way," explains Sue,
"We hope that girls who wouldn't
take the time to go up to the
gym for an activity will feel that
they can spare a few minutes for
a fast game of ping-pong, badmin
ton or volleyball during a study
break.
"Last quarter, over 143 girls
turned out for extra-mural bas
ketball teams, making it the most
popular sport we offer. The
teams participated in tourna
ment with Cal. at Berkeley, and
various Catholic Women's Col
leges in the Bay Area," Sue re
ports. "As our schedule shows,
interest in tennis and fencing is
steadily growing. At least 30
girls are enrolled in this year's
fencing class.
"Localized sports from various
sections of the country are also
coming into their own; this year
we have several girls interested
in skeet shooting, and a field
hockey team that plays regularly
with a Palo Alto group of mar

l ied women," she concludes.
Selection of sports to be offered
is made by t lie WRA Board which
consists of a girl from each wom
en's dorm or residence. Serving
on the Executive Board with Sue
are Vice President Ann Johnson
and Secretary Angela Mel berg.
Every Stanford co-ed is automati
cally a member of the WRA or
ganization and is invited to par
ticipate in all the athletic activi
ties it offers.

they can spare a few minutes for
a fast game of ping-pong, badmin
ton or volleyball during a study
break.

we have several girls interested
in skeet shooting, and a field

with a Palo Alto group of mar

l ied women," she concludes.
