### MARY VANDEVEER 
Faculty jurisdiction in religious
matters was (he central topic of
last week-s open forum on reli
gious affairs. Expressing hi s
views on the issue was Professor
Eric Hutchinson, chairman of the
University's Committee on Stu
dent Affairs and Services.
In regard to the authorization
of sectarian instruction on cam
pus, Dr. Hutchinson said, "The
job of deciding what shall he
taught and who shall teach it is
very much of the faculty." He
went on to explain, however, that
closed denominational activities
are the business of the student
organized Committee on Religious
Affairs, created last year to dis
cuss such matters.
Dr. Hutchinson blames much of
the University's present problem
on Stanford's "wooley-headed"
founders, who drew up the Found
ing Charter in an exceedingly un
professional manner. The Charter,
which outlaws sectarianism, ac
counts for the Board of Trustees'
conservative policy regarding reli
gious activities. However, Dr.
Hutchinson feels that the Board
can be moved to action by a
greater display of conscientious
interest in religion on the part of
Stanford students.
Professor Edwin Good of Reli
gious Studies also participated in
the discussion. When questioned
on faculty attitude toward the
Board's stand against religious
instruction, he stated that he
doubted that there was much fac
ulty opinion on it.
Dr. Good, however, looks for
ward to a more liberal treatment
of the question. Both he and Dr.
Hutchinson agree that there is a
good possibility that a Catholic,
Jewish, and Protestant theologian
will be appointed to the School
of Humanities and Sciences.
