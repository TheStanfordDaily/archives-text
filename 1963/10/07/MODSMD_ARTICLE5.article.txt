SANFORD TACKLE Bob Nichols picks off a deflected Indian pass and carries to the UCLA two-yard
line in this second half action as John Wilbur (69) looks on. The Indians failed to score in the next
series of downs, but a short field-goal attempt resulted in a safety when a Bruin halfback tried to
run it back and was tackled in the end zone. UCLA later rallied to win. 10-9.
