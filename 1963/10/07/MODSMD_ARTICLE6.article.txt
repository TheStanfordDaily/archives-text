# No Hillel Classes
## Women's Clubhouse 'On Campus' 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
In a letter received by Stanford
Hillel Director Harry May last
Friday, the Executive Committee
of the Women's Clubhouse Board
announced that the Clubhouse
was not available for Hillel
classes. Last week the classes
were barred from University facil
ities due to their "formal instruc
tion" nature.
The Clubhouse is not a Univer
sity-owned building, having been
constructed through contributions
from women students over a pe
riod of years.
UPON READING the state
ment of the Executive Committee
of the Academic Council stating
that "formal courses cannot be
given on campus except by per
sons holding academic appoint
ments," Mrs. Rosamond Bacon,
chairman of the Women's Club
house Board questioned the role
of the Clubhouse. The Hillel
Foundation was scheduled to hold
a music class of the recorder and
a conversational Hebrew class in
the Clubhouse. She approached
Frederic Glover, Executive Assis
tant to President Sterling, and
was told that the Women's Club
house must come under the Pres
ident's ruling.
Glover commented to the Daily,
"The ruling says 'on campus,' and
certainly the Women's Clubhouse
is on campus. If the ruling said
'in university facilities, it might
be a different story."
Glover added, "It is the formal
instruction aspect, not the reli
gion issue, that is the question.
It would apply to the teaching of
aeronautical engineering or any
other subject as well.
"WE HAVE not as yet had a

chance to discuss this fully with
the President and the Board of
Trustees, but this is how it stands
for the moment," Glover con
cluded.
Mrs. Bacon noted to the Daily,
"The officers of t tie Women's
Clubhouse Board decided we must
conform with the ruling of the
President. I approached the Pres
ident's office on my own ini
tiative."
Mrs. Bacon's husband, Harold
Bacon of Mathematics, is a mem
ber of the Executive Committee
of the Academic Council, which
advised the President on this
issue.

"I sent a letter to Dr. May tell
ing him we are happy to have
Hillel and all other religious
groups use our Clubhouse for
meetings, but that we do come
under the ruling of the President
that we can't have formal instruc
tion." Mrs. Bacon said.
"WE MIGHT be asked by New
man Club if a priest could teach
Latin. I felt we should conform,
and asked for clarification," she
I added.
Mrs. Bacon continued, "I know
j how difficult it is to get people
\ down to classes at night off cam
i pus, but this is a problem of long
; standing. If Mr. May were to teach
I conversational Hebrew, Mr. Dud
dington might want to teach
| Latin.
j ."I hope we didn't seem to be
Jun cooperative in any way. We
j wanted to do what the President
| wanted us to do. This is a problem
j that involves formal classwork in
! any subject, not just Latin or
Hebrew."

"WE HAVE not as yet had a

chance to discuss this fully with
the President and the Board of
Trustees, but this is how it stands
for the moment," Glover con
cluded.
Mrs. Bacon noted to the Daily,
"The officers of t tie Women's
Clubhouse Board decided we must
conform with the ruling of the
President. I approached the Pres
ident's office on my own ini
tiative."
Mrs. Bacon's husband, Harold
Bacon of Mathematics, is a mem
ber of the Executive Committee
of the Academic Council, which
advised the President on this
issue.

"I sent a letter to Dr. May tell
ing him we are happy to have
Hillel and all other religious
groups use our Clubhouse for
meetings, but that we do come
under the ruling of the President
that we can't have formal instruc
tion." Mrs. Bacon said.
"WE MIGHT be asked by New
man Club if a priest could teach
Latin. I felt we should conform,
and asked for clarification," she
I added.
Mrs. Bacon continued, "I know
j how difficult it is to get people
\ down to classes at night off cam
i pus, but this is a problem of long
; standing. If Mr. May were to teach
I conversational Hebrew, Mr. Dud
dington might want to teach
| Latin.
j ."I hope we didn't seem to be
Jun cooperative in any way. We
j wanted to do what the President
| wanted us to do. This is a problem
j that involves formal classwork in
! any subject, not just Latin or
Hebrew."
In a letter received by Stanford
Hillel Director Harry May last
Friday, the Executive Committee
of the Women's Clubhouse Board
announced that the Clubhouse
was not available for Hillel
classes. Last week the classes
were barred from University facil
ities due to their "formal instruc
tion" nature.
The Clubhouse is not a Univer
sity-owned building, having been
constructed through contributions
from women students over a pe
riod of years.
UPON READING the state
ment of the Executive Committee
of the Academic Council stating
that "formal courses cannot be
given on campus except by per
sons holding academic appoint
ments," Mrs. Rosamond Bacon,
chairman of the Women's Club
house Board questioned the role
of the Clubhouse. The Hillel
Foundation was scheduled to hold
a music class of the recorder and
a conversational Hebrew class in
the Clubhouse. She approached
Frederic Glover, Executive Assis
tant to President Sterling, and
was told that the Women's Club
house must come under the Pres
ident's ruling.
Glover commented to the Daily,
"The ruling says 'on campus,' and
certainly the Women's Clubhouse
is on campus. If the ruling said
'in university facilities, it might
be a different story."
Glover added, "It is the formal
instruction aspect, not the reli
gion issue, that is the question.
It would apply to the teaching of
aeronautical engineering or any
other subject as well.
"WE HAVE not as yet had a

chance to discuss this fully with
the President and the Board of
Trustees, but this is how it stands
for the moment," Glover con
cluded.
