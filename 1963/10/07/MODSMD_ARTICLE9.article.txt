# Danielle Water Colors on Display in Stanford Museum
## 
### SUE BAKER 
A collection of water colors and sketches of 18th
century India is now on display in the Sarah Love
Miedcl Room of the Leland Stanford Junior Mu
seum. These drawings are t he work of Thomas and
William Danielle, English artists who traveled
through Indian from 178(5 to 1793, and they are
presented at the museum in conjunction with the
Smithsonian Institution.
THOMAS DANIKIXK was one of Ihe first Brit
ish artists to visit India. He hoped to find patron
age in that country and to return with novel ma
terial which would be popular in England. Me was
accompanied on his journey by his nephew Wil
liam. a boy of fifteen.
A fascinating account of their travels can be
read in the journals they wrote, sections of which
accompany the exhibited sketches. The Danielles'
works picture Ihe people, mosques, temples, pal
aces, markets, scenic vistas and historic locations
of an India which was strange and unfamiliar to
Europeans of the times.
When the Danielles returned to England in 1794,
I hoy used their stock of drawings for an ambitious
project. Thomas Danielle spent the next thirteen
years in making 1 14 aquatints for Oriental Scen
ery, a great work published in six parts between
1795 and ISDN. Fourteen of the drawings on exhibit
in the museum are original sketches from which
engravings were later made. Oriental Scenery was
followed in 1810 by A Picturesque Voyaue to India
by Way of < hina, and in 1834, the Oriental Annual
was published.
TIIK WOlik OF the Danielles played an impor
tant part in that taste for "the exotic" which showed
itself in England at the beginning of tln* 19th cen
tury. Translations of Indian classical literature,
histories and travel books gave England a new

imagery.
Pictures, such as those by the Danielles, gave
images visual form. For many men and women,
thci>' conception of the East with dark-skinned,
muslin-clad figures, florid architecture, feathery
palm trees and strange forms of transport such as
palanguins and elephants were derived from these
pictures. Similarly, eastern images used by the ro
mantic poets, such as Southev, Coleridge. Byron,
Keats, Shelly and above all Moore with "Lallah
Rookh" took shape and color from this source.
Besides poetry "the exotic" affected architec
ture. and here the Danielles' influence was decisive.
Many English country homes featured an eastern
effect, and the Royal Stables and Riding House were
styled directly from the Danielles' drawings.
IN ALL THESE developments the Danielles'
were the most important single influence. Their
paintings, sketches and publishings comprised a
body of material from which a whole generation
drew its conception of exotic India. The drawings
combine intricate detailing with a subtle blond of
pastel colors to give an overall impression of the
mystery of 18th century India. As expositors of the
Danielles' are some of the museum's finest oriental
pieces of sculpture and statuary dating from as long
ago as the Bth and 9th century A.D. One of the
original copies of Oriental Scenery can also be seen
with the display.
As part of the museum's regular Tuesday after
noon coffee hour series, John Le Plantc, acting di
rector of the museum and an expert in the area of
oriental art, will speak on October 13, on the sig
nificance and background of the exhibit. Coffee
will be served from 3:00-5:00 p.m., and the speaker
is scheduled for 3:30. All students and interested
patrons of the museum are urged to attend this
enlightening fimction.

A collection of water colors and sketches of 18th
century India is now on display in the Sarah Love
Miedcl Room of the Leland Stanford Junior Mu
seum. These drawings are t he work of Thomas and
William Danielle, English artists who traveled
through Indian from 178(5 to 1793, and they are
presented at the museum in conjunction with the
Smithsonian Institution.
THOMAS DANIKIXK was one of Ihe first Brit
ish artists to visit India. He hoped to find patron
age in that country and to return with novel ma
terial which would be popular in England. Me was
accompanied on his journey by his nephew Wil
liam. a boy of fifteen.
A fascinating account of their travels can be
read in the journals they wrote, sections of which
accompany the exhibited sketches. The Danielles'
works picture Ihe people, mosques, temples, pal
aces, markets, scenic vistas and historic locations
of an India which was strange and unfamiliar to
Europeans of the times.
When the Danielles returned to England in 1794,
I hoy used their stock of drawings for an ambitious
project. Thomas Danielle spent the next thirteen
years in making 1 14 aquatints for Oriental Scen
ery, a great work published in six parts between
1795 and ISDN. Fourteen of the drawings on exhibit
in the museum are original sketches from which
engravings were later made. Oriental Scenery was
followed in 1810 by A Picturesque Voyaue to India
by Way of < hina, and in 1834, the Oriental Annual
was published.
TIIK WOlik OF the Danielles played an impor
tant part in that taste for "the exotic" which showed
itself in England at the beginning of tln* 19th cen
tury. Translations of Indian classical literature,
histories and travel books gave England a new

imagery.
Pictures, such as those by the Danielles, gave
images visual form. For many men and women,
thci>' conception of the East with dark-skinned,
muslin-clad figures, florid architecture, feathery
palm trees and strange forms of transport such as
palanguins and elephants were derived from these
pictures. Similarly, eastern images used by the ro
mantic poets, such as Southev, Coleridge. Byron,
Keats, Shelly and above all Moore with "Lallah
Rookh" took shape and color from this source.
Besides poetry "the exotic" affected architec
ture. and here the Danielles' influence was decisive.
Many English country homes featured an eastern
effect, and the Royal Stables and Riding House were
styled directly from the Danielles' drawings.
IN ALL THESE developments the Danielles'
were the most important single influence. Their
paintings, sketches and publishings comprised a
body of material from which a whole generation
drew its conception of exotic India. The drawings
combine intricate detailing with a subtle blond of
pastel colors to give an overall impression of the
mystery of 18th century India. As expositors of the
Danielles' are some of the museum's finest oriental
pieces of sculpture and statuary dating from as long
ago as the Bth and 9th century A.D. One of the
original copies of Oriental Scenery can also be seen
with the display.
