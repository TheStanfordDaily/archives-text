# Oregon, Long Beach State Battle Fraternity Problems
## 
### 
Racial discrimination by Greek organizations at West Coast
colleges resulted in open criticism of the fraternity system by a
University of Oregon Negro and the withdrawing of recognition for
six sororities by Long Beach State College last week.
Portland State College, in Portland, Oregon, also suspendcl six

national sororities recently be
cause of a charge of discrimina
tion against two Negro girls dur
ing rush.
THE SIX Long Beach sororities
withdrew from campus super
vised rushing without consulting
the college, said Robert Wells,
manager of the LBSC news bu
reau, in the Daily Californian
of the University of California at
Berkeley.
College spokesmen said that
the sororities had sent letters to
members stating that off-campus
rushing would avoid compliance
with a proposed anti-discrimina
tion rule effective next Septem
ber.
The Board of Trustees of th e
California State College system
ruled that Greek organizations
must sign pledges by Sept. 1,
1964, in which they agree not to
discriminate against members
on the basis of race or religion.

EDITH HENDLEY, faculty ad
viser to the six sororities, stated
that "Members of the six national
sororities subject to the present
action in Long Beach believe we
can survive without recognition.
It is our choice to be a private
organization based on a religious
foundation and giving service to
the college whenever possible.
"We prefer to be able to choose
our membership from all who
wish to join us and support our
ideals rather than those who feel
they should join because of an
obligation to taxpayers."
College president Carl Mcin
tosh said. "It is unwise for any
college to permit auxiliary
groups to choose which respon
sibilities they will respect and
which they will ignore."
At the University of Oregon,
Herb Sanders, a freshman Eng
lish major, charged that "rather
evident discrimination" exists in
the University's fraternity sys
tem.
Sanders participated in the
school's fraternity rush and "re
ceived drop cards from all but
two fraternities after he visited
their houses," stated the Oregon
Daily Emerald.
•I WAS actually amazed at the
lack of courage shown," said
Sanders. "It belies the whole prin
ciples of brotherhood which un
derlie the fraternity system."
Sanders said he "was not bit
ter."
"One house said they were
afraid of what the national would
do. At one of the smaller houses,
the people said they were afraid
what other houses would say.
"THEY WERE afraid of'pub
lic opinion and losing their na
tional charter," said Sanders. "I
can see no way for a Negro to
become a member of a fraternity
unless the present system is
changed," he said to an Emerald
reporter.
"When I came up here (Ore
gon) I had no idea that I would
be the only Negro in rush." he
said. "My main reason for want
ing to join a fraternity is because
I believe in the fraternity sys
tem."
Sanders specifically denied any
connection or contact with the
NAACP, CORE, or a similar or
ganization.
Phil Sherburne, Associated Stu
dents president at Oregon, did
not believe that there was any
discrimination on the part of the
fraternities. He said any deci
sion regarding the Negro rushee
was probably made on an in
dividual basis rather than on a
racial basis.
UNIVERSITY president Arthur
S. Flemming said that "appropri
ate action" would be taken
against fraternities and sororities
with discriminatory clauses in
their constitutions.
Panhellenic Council President
Sara Richards told the Oregon
paper that "she personally saw
no sorority discrimination during
rush."
Only one Negro woman signed
up for rush, and she failed to
partcipate, said school officials.

At the University of Oregon,
Herb Sanders, a freshman Eng

evident discrimination" exists in
the University's fraternity sys

Sanders participated in the
school's fraternity rush and "re
ceived drop cards from all but
two fraternities after he visited
their houses," stated the Oregon
Daily Emerald.
•I WAS actually amazed at the
lack of courage shown," said
Sanders. "It belies the whole prin
ciples of brotherhood which un
derlie the fraternity system."
Sanders said he "was not bit

"One house said they were
afraid of what the national would
do. At one of the smaller houses,
the people said they were afraid
what other houses would say.
"THEY WERE afraid of'pub
lic opinion and losing their na
tional charter," said Sanders. "I
can see no way for a Negro to
become a member of a fraternity
unless the present system is
changed," he said to an Emerald
reporter.
"When I came up here (Ore

be the only Negro in rush." he
said. "My main reason for want
ing to join a fraternity is because
I believe in the fraternity sys

Sanders specifically denied any
connection or contact with the
NAACP, CORE, or a similar or
ganization.
Phil Sherburne, Associated Stu
dents president at Oregon, did
not believe that there was any
discrimination on the part of the
fraternities. He said any deci
sion regarding the Negro rushee
was probably made on an in
dividual basis rather than on a
racial basis.
UNIVERSITY president Arthur
S. Flemming said that "appropri
ate action" would be taken
against fraternities and sororities
with discriminatory clauses in
their constitutions.
Panhellenic Council President
Sara Richards told the Oregon
paper that "she personally saw
no sorority discrimination during
rush."
Only one Negro woman signed
up for rush, and she failed to
partcipate, said school officials.
Racial discrimination by Greek organizations at West Coast
colleges resulted in open criticism of the fraternity system by a
University of Oregon Negro and the withdrawing of recognition for
six sororities by Long Beach State College last week.
Portland State College, in Portland, Oregon, also suspendcl six

national sororities recently be

THE SIX Long Beach sororities
withdrew from campus super

the college, said Robert Wells,
manager of the LBSC news bu

of the University of California at

College spokesmen said that
the sororities had sent letters to
members stating that off-campus
rushing would avoid compliance
with a proposed anti-discrimina
tion rule effective next Septem

The Board of Trustees of th e
California State College system
ruled that Greek organizations
must sign pledges by Sept. 1,

discriminate against members
on the basis of race or religion.

sion regarding the Negro rushee
was probably made on an in
dividual basis rather than on a
racial basis.
UNIVERSITY president Arthur
S. Flemming said that "appropri
ate action" would be taken
against fraternities and sororities
with discriminatory clauses in
their constitutions.
Panhellenic Council President
Sara Richards told the Oregon
paper that "she personally saw
no sorority discrimination during
rush."
Only one Negro woman signed
up for rush, and she failed to
partcipate, said school officials.
