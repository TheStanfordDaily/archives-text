## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
Staff members of the "Campus
Voice" yesterday defied the Uni
versity ruling prohibiting open
distribution of their publication
on campus.
VOICE CO-EDITORS, Richard
Rubacher and Ernest Berry, ar
rived on the Stanford campus
with several other staff members
at 9:30 yesterday morning and
began selling their publication on
Engineering Corner and in front
of Tresidder Memorial Union.
At 11 a.m., Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler and Stan
ford Chief of Police Gordon R.
Davis approached the Voice sales
men and informed them that
they were trespassing. Winbig
ler handed the Voice editors a
mimeographed statement which
read, "You do not have permis
sion to come onto the campus
and property owned by the Board
of Trustees of Stanford Univer
sity to sell this publication. In
doing so you are deemed to be
trespassing. The University will
take such steps as are necessary
to assure that this trespassing
is not continued."
However, no immediate action
was forthcoming from the Uni
versity, and the staff members
continued to sell the Voice in
front of the Union through late
afternoon. A later University
release through the Stanford Uni
versity News Service clarified

original mimeographed statement
and indicated that "appropriate
legal action" would be taken
against the Voice salesmen.
rill; UNIVERSITY news re
lease stressed that "the salesmen
violated University regulations
designed to prevent harassment
of Stanford students and faculty
by vendors. . . . The University
has emphasized that the current
dispute centers on the light of
an off-campus group to sell mer
chandise on Stanford property.
The current dispute does not in
volve the contents of the publica
tion itself."
Staff members sold copies of
the Voice for 1.1 cents each amid
the lunch-time crowd in front of
the Union, shouting "Get your
copy of the Campus Voice before
we're banned!" and "Buy the
Campus Voice, the publication
that wouldn't be damned or
banned from the Stanford cam
pus." However, Voice editor Ber
ry emphasized, "We didn't come
down here to battle the adminis
tration. We came here to reach
the students, to reach our read
ers." Berry said ihat the volume
of Voice sales both on the Stan
ford campus last year and at
nearby Kepler's bookstore indi
cated to him a desire on the part
of Stanford students to x'ead the
Voice.
VOICE editor Rubacher took
strong exception to the legality
of the University's ruling on dis
tribution. Rubacher prefaced his
comments by saying, "As far as
comments by saying, the adminis
tration edicts don't exist." Both
Rubacher and Berry insisted thai
the university ruling is in viola
tion of consitutional rights.
BERRY DID NOT deny that
the Voice salesmen were trespass
ing, but at the same time he em
phasized that "consitutional
tights take precedent over prop
erty rights." He said, "We stand
on the Supreme Court decision at
the end of the Nineteenth Cen
tury which ruled that a whole
community cannot Ik? 'owned' as
such." lie stressed that Stanford
is indeed legally a community,
citing the existence of the Stan
ford Post Office, fire department,
and police station as proof of this
point.
Rubacher emphasized that the
Voice did not intend to solicit
within University buildings but
rather planned to restrict sales
efforts to streets and open cam
pus areas which, the Voice main
tains, are public domain.
One salesman estimated that
the Voice had sold over 300 cop
ies by late yesterday afternoon.
"They're really eating it up," he
concluded.
