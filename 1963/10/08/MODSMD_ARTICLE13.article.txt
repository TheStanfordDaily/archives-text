# Children Mimic TV Killers, Thugs

"Hit him down! Sock him in
Iho nose! Kick him!"
Violence of this sort crowds
television channels at all times.
Perched before the family "paci
fier," children spend hours each
day soaking up techniques of
mayhem and mauling.
But, of course, it hasn't an y
effect on the little angels. Vio
lence is really good; it serves to
let off pent-up emotions. Or so
hold a great many self-declared
experts in the field.
A STANFORD psychologist.
Dr. Albert Bandura, has gone far
to discredit this position in a ser
ies of experiments with young
children. His findings are re
viewed in the October 22 "Look"
magazine, on the stands today.
"What TV Violence Can Do to
Your Child" describes Dr. Ban
dura's experiments, and draws
some rather disquieting conclu
sions. When exposed to violent
little skits on a TV screen, chil
dren almost invariable disap
proved of the villain. They called
him "rough" and "mean." "He
whack people!" announced one
pre-schooler.
BIIT, if the villain was success
ful and unpunished the children
imitated him in subsequent free
play sessions . . . The typical TV
bad guy gets away with many
aggressive acts. He is caught
and punished only once — just
before the last commercial. In
the face of his earlier victories
the effect of final retribution is
likely to be small.
MORE SERIOUS than any im
mediate effects on behavior
easily squashed by parents are
the patterns and methods of ag
gression filed away by the child.
Hanging the villain doesn't erase
the memory of his technique. It
might be fun to carry a knife in
your coat sleeve, to demand some
thing at gunpoint and be obeyed.
Dr. Bandura's article throws a
clear and disturbing light on the
question of TV violence. The
models being presented to Ameri
can children are" . . . gunslingers,
hopped up psychopaths . . . and
would deliberately choose such
slapstick buffoons." People who
models must, as Dr. Bandura puts
it, "entertain rather peculiar am
bitions for their growing of f
spring."
