The Student-Faculty Hoard "at home" program is a wel
come effort on the Stanford campus. The program was re
initiated two years ago; old "Dailies" show that at the turn
of" the century and through World War I, faculty members
frequently advertised that they would be "at home" to stu
dents on a certain evening.
The program over the past two years has been feeble,
despite intense efforts on the part of a small group. However,
those faculty members who have been kind enough to par
ticipate have commented favorably, and an increasing num
ber of students are aware of the program.
The past two years have seen as varied a group of people
holding "at homes" as Registrar Harvey Hall, Professor of
Art and Humanities Jeffrey Smith, Professor of Political
Science Kurt Stein or, and Executive Head of the Sociology
Department San ford Dombusch. Tomorrow evening Harold
Bacon, chairman of the Department of Mathematics, will be
"at home" to students. The Bacon home has long been one
open to groups of students; it is a pleasure to see it added
to the "at home" list.
In times when communication among the segments of
the Stanford community often takes on a "cops-and-robbers"
aspect, a step such as the "at home" program should be com
mended for furthering human—and humane—communication.
