## Vermin Ermine: Axe Com OK 
### R.J. DeFELICE 
Ermine Hickenlooper staggers
out of Tresidder Union, clutches
his throat and collapses in a heap
on the ground. In the press of
the noon rush, he remains un
noticed until 2 p.m. when an off
duty health service nurse spots
him writhering there, and notic
ing his contorted features, im
mediately makes a diagnosis. Er
mine has just downed his first
standard third of a cup of that
automated black vitriol. By 5
o'clock Ermine has been ex
pedited through the usual cure
at the Health Service and is rest
ing on the floor in the hall. His
strength slowly returning, he
looks around and to his amaze
ment sights Wilmer Flemm sit
ting next to him.
Vermin Ermine: Wilmer! What
are you doing here?
Wilmer: All I can remember is
setting out from the Post Office
across the Stanford Wastelands
last night. The next thing I knew
the sun was shining and some
workmen were hauling me out of
a pit. They brought me here.
Vermin Ermine: Were you
hurt? Your arm is in a cast.
VVilmer: That's not a cast. They
wore pouring concrete when they
noticed me.
Vermin Ermine: What could
have possessed you to make that
arduous journey at night?
Wilmer: The last time I tried
it during the day, I choked in a
dust storm. Besides, I was late
to the Wednesday night card

sorting bee at the ASSU Office.
Vermin Ermine: Card-sorting,
how did yon get involved in that?
Wilmer: I was about to join
IGNORE when my roommate
got a letter from Axe Com. It
was the most exciting thing that's
happened since the 8.-A. contest
at the Jolly-Up. Axe Com makes
IGNORE look so common.
Vermin Ermine: Axe Com?
But isn't that terribly hard to get
into? In my day, they always
kept it in the family.
Wilmer: Well, the letter says
that he is only an alternate mem
ber and I am just his substitute,
but we're still entitled to sort
cards every Wednesday. More
over, the letter adds, "Of course,
all are to attend social functions
and R.E.'s."
Vermin Ermine: Your problem
is solved then. You've found a
group to join.
VVilmer: I think so, but I'm not
sure. Is Axe Com Administration
approved. I don't want to jeopar
dize my chances for a lifetime
membership in the Alumni Asso
ciation as most outstanding fresh
man.
Vermin Ermine: Of course it
is! It confines itself to the tradi
tional limits of student concern—
simple-minded card stunts, excit
ing rallies, and all-time functions
to remember your happy under
graduate years by.
Wilmer: That's great. Surely
the Axe Com is a gift of Provi
dence. Someday, if I join the
right fraternity, I may become
a full member.

a pit. They brought me here.
Vermin Ermine: Were you
hurt? Your arm is in a cast.
VVilmer: That's not a cast. They
wore pouring concrete when they
noticed me.
Vermin Ermine: What could
have possessed you to make that
arduous journey at night?
Wilmer: The last time I tried
it during the day, I choked in a
dust storm. Besides, I was late
to the Wednesday night card

sorting bee at the ASSU Office.
Vermin Ermine: Card-sorting,
how did yon get involved in that?
Wilmer: I was about to join
IGNORE when my roommate
got a letter from Axe Com. It
was the most exciting thing that's
happened since the 8.-A. contest
at the Jolly-Up. Axe Com makes
IGNORE look so common.
Vermin Ermine: Axe Com?
But isn't that terribly hard to get
into? In my day, they always
kept it in the family.
Wilmer: Well, the letter says
that he is only an alternate mem
ber and I am just his substitute,
but we're still entitled to sort
cards every Wednesday. More
over, the letter adds, "Of course,
all are to attend social functions
and R.E.'s."
Vermin Ermine: Your problem
is solved then. You've found a
group to join.
VVilmer: I think so, but I'm not
sure. Is Axe Com Administration
approved. I don't want to jeopar
dize my chances for a lifetime
membership in the Alumni Asso
ciation as most outstanding fresh
man.
Vermin Ermine: Of course it
is! It confines itself to the tradi
tional limits of student concern—
simple-minded card stunts, excit
ing rallies, and all-time functions
to remember your happy under
graduate years by.
Wilmer: That's great. Surely
the Axe Com is a gift of Provi
dence. Someday, if I join the
right fraternity, I may become
a full member.
Ermine Hickenlooper staggers
out of Tresidder Union, clutches
his throat and collapses in a heap
on the ground. In the press of
the noon rush, he remains un
noticed until 2 p.m. when an off
duty health service nurse spots
him writhering there, and notic
ing his contorted features, im
mediately makes a diagnosis. Er
mine has just downed his first
standard third of a cup of that
automated black vitriol. By 5
o'clock Ermine has been ex
pedited through the usual cure
at the Health Service and is rest
ing on the floor in the hall. His
strength slowly returning, he
looks around and to his amaze
ment sights Wilmer Flemm sit
ting next to him.
Vermin Ermine: Wilmer! What
are you doing here?
Wilmer: All I can remember is
setting out from the Post Office
across the Stanford Wastelands
last night. The next thing I knew
the sun was shining and some
workmen were hauling me out of
a pit. They brought me here.
Vermin Ermine: Were you
hurt? Your arm is in a cast.
