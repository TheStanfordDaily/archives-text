# Defense Department Asks Radical ROTC Changes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS) â€” De
dense Department officials are
asking Congress this week to ap
prove the most radical change
ever in the history of reserve
officer training corps (ROTO
programs at U.S. colleges and
universities.
Pentagon officials have pre
sented a new, two-year voluntary
ROTC program aimed at getting
more and better officers for the
Army and Air Force at less cost.
ASSISTANT Defense Secretary
Norman S. Paul told a House
Armed Services subcommittee
that the need for young officers
in the services was great and the
change would make it easier to
provide them.
The plan would permit educa
tional institutions to continue
their present four-year programs,
if desired.
Colleges and universities in
volved could select only one of
the programs.
College men wishing to enroll
in the two-year program would
be screened carefully before ac
cepted. Once accepted, the serv
ices would pay their college costs.
PAUL said, present plans
call for limited scholarships to
be made available at the begin
ning of the new program, includ
ing 1000 each for the Army and
Air Force.

The scholarships would cover
actual educational expenses of
tuition, school fees and similar
items totaling not more than $800
a year, plus pay a retainer pay of
not more than $50 a month for
ten months each of the two years.
Scholarship students would be
required to serve at least four
years on active duty. Non-schol
arship students would serve a
period perscribed by the service
secretaries.
Subcommittee Chairman F. Ed
ward Hebert. L-La., said the pro
gram "appears to have consider
able merit." It was one more in
dication that the plan would get
congressional approval.
PRESSURE from both univer
sities and colleges and the armed
forces is giving the new program
a needed push.
The military services, especially
the Air Force, has been on th e
kxsing end of mandatory ROTC
programs. At any large land
grant university, where law re
quires a military program, thou
sands of freshmen are spoon-fed
their first taste of military life.
Four years later, the service
ends up with only 30 or 40 first
lieutenants from a single large
university. Falling by the way
side are thousands of students
physically and psychologically un
fit for an officer's job.
