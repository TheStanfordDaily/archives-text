CUBA INACCURACY
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing to protest the in
accurate news report of t he meet
ing last Thursday night at Ilolla
day House. To support my charge
of inaccuracy (not to mention
tendentiousness), 1 would like to
cite the following examples.
1. 112 was paraphrased as having
said that "the people who bene
fited by it |the Cuban Revolu
tion! are expected to express
their approval." Now, if you tell
a man that when he is presented
with an award by Mr. So and So,
he will be expected to express his
approval, that is a polite way of
telling him to express his ap
proval. People aren't told, or even
asked, to express their approval
of the Revolution in Cuba. My
impression was that a large ma
jority of the people freely ap
prove of it, so I especially resent
the insinuation that they are

forced to express their approval
or that I claimed any such thing.
2. Your news report ends by
noting that one of the speakers,
when asked whether he was a
member of the Communist Party,
replied, "It's none of your busi
ness. I have my beliefs and I shall
maintain them whether you like
it or not." Should ending the re
port in that way indicate to any
of your readers that one of us
or all of us were members of the
Communist Party, I would like
to point out that, though it was
nobody's business and entirely
irrelevant to the discussion, none
of us are or have been members
of the Communist Party, we had
accepted an invitation to the
meeting in good faith. We weren't
in a court of law, so that we con
sidered the kind of cross-examin
ing that we encountered rude and
insulting. We didn't wish to dig
nify such questions with answers.

replied, "It's none of your busi
ness. I have my beliefs and I shall
maintain them whether you like
it or not." Should ending the re
port in that way indicate to any
of your readers that one of us
or all of us were members of the
Communist Party, I would like
to point out that, though it was
nobody's business and entirely
irrelevant to the discussion, none
of us are or have been members
of the Communist Party, we had
accepted an invitation to the
meeting in good faith. We weren't
in a court of law, so that we con
sidered the kind of cross-examin
ing that we encountered rude and
insulting. We didn't wish to dig
nify such questions with answers.
