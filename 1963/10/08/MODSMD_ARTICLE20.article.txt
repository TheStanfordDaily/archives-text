# 'Lord of the Flies' Basic, Valid Movie
## 
### FOSTER HIRSCH Drama Editor 
William Golding's "Lord of the Flies" is an electrifying novel.
With insight and precision, he develops an allegory of the essential
ovil within mankind. The rich symbolism which Golding doles out so
generously demands many levels of interpretation. In his film based
on Golding's work, Peter Brook offers one such level of meaning;
his approach, although lacking the novel's complexity and sophisti
cation, is basic and valid. Since Mr. Brook has presented his inter
pretation in terms of cinema, a discussion of the film heavily de
pendent on the novel which is its basis is unfair; one medium cannot
accurately be judged in terms of another. An evaluation must there
fore be based on the degree of success with which the tilm uses
those resources peculiar to its own medium.
AS VOU NO doubt remember, "Lord of the Flies" concerns a
society set up by a group of British school boys marooned on an
island after the crash of a plane carrying them from a nuclear
attack. At first, with civilization yet fresh, the boys enjoy an easy
comaraderie, form a solid group, and elect as their leader, the per
sonable, able Ralph. As the restraining influence of home and school
wears away, harmony is slowly replaced by conflict. Of necessity,
the boys become hunters; Jack, their leader, begins to contest
Ralph's authority. Gradually, the boys shy away from the basic
goodness and order embodied by Ralph and succumb to the lawless
freedom and abandon upheld by Jack. Theirs becomes a dog-eat
dog universe in which rationality and knowledge are eschewed for
barbarity. Stimulated by a frenzied orgy, they kill the solemn,
wise Simon; later, in a moment of senseless cruelty, they kill the
practical, helpless Piggy. -At the end, completely alone, Ralph is
hunted by the others.
The film skillfully dramatizes the various stages of this primitive
society. It is, indeed, on the level of a study of group child psychol
ogy that the film is most successful. The evolutionary process from
a nonchalant harmony to a ferocious savagery flows easily and rea
sonably. Given the nature of the film medium, however, there is
not really adequate time to portray the degradation of the children.
Their deterioration appears somewhat too quick and facile; conse
quently, we must ourselves supply the appropriate time lapses.
The film convinces us that a group of children under these cir
cumstances would assuredly conduct themselves as is here sug
gested. The film is less fortunate in extracting from its account
an allegory of the evil which is inherent in mankind when the veneer
of civilization is stripped away. The scenes of the hunt, the orgy,
the murders, the offering of the pig, call forth the savagery of the
boys. This symbolism, however, does not seem universal, but ap
plicable merely to the boys under examination. With the camera's
directness and concrete rendering of detail, the symbols seem too
obvious, too simplified, and thus lack the universality needed for
an allegorical statement.
TECHNICALLY, the film is enormously resourceful. The harsh,
grainy photography is continually beautiful. Contrasts of light and
dark are used to great effect, and the Puerto Rican setting is util
ized to the utmost advantage. Careful attention is paid to spatial
arrangements, and the movement of the boys is balanced like chore
ography.
The music effectively highlights the course of the boys' society.
Initially tenuous, delicate, and charming, it builds to a menacing,
sinister throbbing. Significantly, there is throughout an undertone
of poignancy.
The performances which Mr. Brook has drawn from his cast: of
amateurs is the film's most noteworthy achievement. The young
man who plays Ralph (whose professional name I unfortunately
do not know) performs with complete ease. He typifies the natural
leader, the perennial favorite endowed with charm arid sharp native
ability. Tom Chapin as Jack is chilling, the vei*y embodiment : of
evil. Piggy, performed by Hugh Edwards with an uncanny natural
ness, is the film's most sympathetic character. His recitation about
his home town of Camberley is certainly as good as anything ever
put on film; so real and true that it cannot possibly be considered
mere acting.
BROOK'S direction has grace and rhythm and he has edited with
vigorous sharpness. He has seen to it that the momentum builds
evenly and steadily. His film is less ambitious than it might have
been; for what he has achieved, though, he and his entire company
deserve the highest praise.
"Lord of the Flies" is now at the Fine Arts Theatre in Palo Alto.
