## 
### 
By ROGER MAGNUSON
The undefeated Stanford soccer
i team, tiring badly in (he fourth
j period, staved off a lasl minute
' Air Force Academy rally and beat
i the Falcons 3-2 at the rugby field
here Saturday.
A 1 Nnoli once again was the
Indians' chief point-getter, con
tributing two goals and one assist
to the winning effort, while Ed
Clark gained credit for the other
tally.
AFTER A SCORELESS first
period, in which neither team
seemed able 1o mount a consist
ent offensive attack, the Air
Force drew first blood in the sec
ond as Jim Perry received a pass
in front of the Stanford net from
Jim Thames and kicked the ball
past goalie Kent Muller at 16:30.
Then, with only four seconds
remaining in the half, Klaus
Bergman passed perfectly to
Nnoli, who booted the ball from
30 feet, out into the corner of the
goal, tying the game at one each.

•/
In the third quarter, the Stan
ford team began to apply some
persistent pressure rleep in Aca
demy territory scoring at 10:60
when the Falcon goalie was faked
out of position, and Nnoli drilled
the ball into the open net.
FOUR MINUTES later, Ed
Clark scored the Tribe's third of
the game on a pass from Nnoli
to make the score 3-1.
In the fourth period the Red
men began to run out of gas, and
the Air Force took advantage of
their weariness to pester goalie
Tom Poulson, who had been
brought in in the second half.
Finally, Jim Thames brought the
Air Force to within one goal of
a tie, by scoring with only 54
seconds left in the game. The
Academy tried desperately to i
knot the game in the final sec- |
onds but Stanford's defense rose
to the occasion and protected the j
lead.
After the game, Coach Priddle
remarked that such games give
him "gray hair." He added that
"we just ran out of steam. We
ran out of replacements, and the
players were pretty tired. But
our passing has improved and I j
think we played well enough to
deserve a couple of more goals
than we got."
Next week, the team begins its
conference schedule by playing
San Francisco State here <
Saturday at the rugby field. Be
cause the football team is away, |
the game is scheduled to begin at ;
2:30 p.m. instead of the regular !
11:00 a.m. stal ling time.

Nnoli, who booted the ball from
30 feet, out into the corner of the
goal, tying the game at one each.

•/
In the third quarter, the Stan
ford team began to apply some
persistent pressure rleep in Aca
demy territory scoring at 10:60
when the Falcon goalie was faked
out of position, and Nnoli drilled
the ball into the open net.
FOUR MINUTES later, Ed
Clark scored the Tribe's third of
the game on a pass from Nnoli
to make the score 3-1.
In the fourth period the Red
men began to run out of gas, and
the Air Force took advantage of
their weariness to pester goalie
Tom Poulson, who had been
brought in in the second half.
Finally, Jim Thames brought the
Air Force to within one goal of
a tie, by scoring with only 54
seconds left in the game. The
Academy tried desperately to i
knot the game in the final sec- |
onds but Stanford's defense rose
to the occasion and protected the j
lead.
After the game, Coach Priddle
remarked that such games give
him "gray hair." He added that
"we just ran out of steam. We
ran out of replacements, and the
players were pretty tired. But
our passing has improved and I j
think we played well enough to
deserve a couple of more goals
than we got."
Next week, the team begins its
conference schedule by playing
San Francisco State here <
Saturday at the rugby field. Be
cause the football team is away, |
the game is scheduled to begin at ;
2:30 p.m. instead of the regular !
11:00 a.m. stal ling time.
