# UCLA Coach Pleased With Bruin Effort
## 
### JOHN CALMORE 
After Saturday's game, the joy
of victory was quite present in
the locker room marked "visi
tors." For UCLA the taste of vic
tory was a new experience in this
grid season. But from the gen
eral atmosphere of the locker
room, they seemingly enjoy the
dish very much.
After a beaming Billy Barnes
finished walking among his play
ers congratulating them, he took
a seat. With his hands still clutch
ing the game ball, he stated
"Stanford's a big, strong team
that's going to get better as they
go along."
Coach Barnes expressed his
satisfaction with the play of his
Bruins as a whole, pointing out
that he used about 18 sopho
mores. He was particularly
pleased with the .fine quarterback
ing of Larry Zeno, and also the
successful change of Carl Jones
from quarterback to left half.
