## 
### 
Professor and Mrs. Harold Ba
; con of the Mathematics Depart -
| ment will host the first faculty
[ "at home" of the year tomorrow
night from 7:30 to 8:30 at 565
Lasuen on ihc Row.
All students have been invited
lo the "at homes" at which a fac-
I ulty member opens his home for
i an evening to any students who
! wish to drop by and informally
visit.
The program is conducted un
i dei* the sponsorship of the Stu
! dent-Faculty Board and represents
| an attempt on its part to further
I student faculty relations at an
I academic level in an non-class- :
I room atmosphere.
The "at home" program was
: reestablished in November. 1961,
after having lain dormant for
: nearly half a century.
The 1897 version of Once!
: Around the Quad often carried!
notices such as "Professor and I
I Mrs. Jones at home to students !
j tonight."
The "at home" idea offers com- ;
plete informality in that no inter-;
! mediary body plans a program. ;
Professors are free to call the'
Daily and announce an "at home" i
j evening at any time.
The program puts no pressure j
| upon the schedule of the faculty j
member as he is not expected to
lead formal discussion or be i
bothered with sign-ups.
