### 
OTTAWA (CUP-CPS Â» The
president of the National Federa
tion of Canadian University Stu
dents (NFCUS), the Canadian
National Union of students, has
branded as "unreasonable" a
threal by the University of Mon
treal to sever all ties with Eng
lish-speaking students.
Pierre Marois, president of the
students' association at Montreal,
made a public statement last
week in Le Devoir, a Montreal
newspaper, that there must, be
Iwo separate general unions of
students in Canada one French
and one English.
He threatened that NFCUS as
it now stands must be split with
an undefined super-structure,
whose responsibilities would be
determined by a joint commission
of the two unions.
"If NFCUS refuses to comply
with this ultimatum," said Ma
rois, "it will sign its own death
warrant."
Dave Jenkins, national NFCUS
president, said that Marois is
making a mistake in thinking
that he can solve the situation
with an "ill timed ultimatum."
"The place for dealing with this
problem is the National Congress
Marois knows, a new structure
of NFCUS." Jenkins added. "As
for NFCUS will be the major
issue discussed at this year's Con
gress."
"Over the years, considering
all the organizations in the coun
try. inc 1 u ding governments,
NFCUS has been in the forefront
in establishing and maintaining
productive cooperation between
French and English-speaking stu
dents.
