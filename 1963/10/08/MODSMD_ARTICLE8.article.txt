A CCUN chapter was estab

the same office in the lIR.

chapter. Although CCUN at Stan
ford was inactive last year, "We
have plans this year," said Gon
dim in an interview with The
Daily. CCUN plans to commemo
rate United Nations Day. October

Gondim and his staff are also
working on a college conference
of all California CCUN chapters
which will be held Winter Quar

will be held over a weekend, and
will include outside speakers, as

facing the United Nations today.
