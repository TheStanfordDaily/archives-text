"BORN TWICE"?
Everyone has been born at least once, but some people have
been born twice. The latter are called Christians. Their second
birth has awakened them from spiritual death into spiritual
life; As fully complete human beings they enjoy daily fellow
ship with their Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. The second birth
and the indwelling Holy Spirit are wonderful, miraculous, and
emphatically real. As Jesus said Do not marvel that I said to
you, you must be born anew! The wind blows where it wills,
and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it
comes or whither it goes,- so it is with everyone born of the
Spirit (John 3:7,8). There is indeed an answer to the needs of
the human heart and a meaning to life. In our pragmatic age
the only convincing proof is to see for yourself that Jesus Christ
is indeed the Alpha and Omega, the everlasting God. Find out
for yourself; don't take somebody else's word for it.

and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it
comes or whither it goes,- so it is with everyone born of the
Spirit (John 3:7,8). There is indeed an answer to the needs of
the human heart and a meaning to life. In our pragmatic age
the only convincing proof is to see for yourself that Jesus Christ
is indeed the Alpha and Omega, the everlasting God. Find out
for yourself; don't take somebody else's word for it.

"BORN TWICE"?
Everyone has been born at least once, but some people have
been born twice. The latter are called Christians. Their second
birth has awakened them from spiritual death into spiritual
life; As fully complete human beings they enjoy daily fellow
ship with their Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. The second birth
and the indwelling Holy Spirit are wonderful, miraculous, and
emphatically real. As Jesus said Do not marvel that I said to
you, you must be born anew! The wind blows where it wills,
and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it
comes or whither it goes,- so it is with everyone born of the
Spirit (John 3:7,8). There is indeed an answer to the needs of
the human heart and a meaning to life. In our pragmatic age
the only convincing proof is to see for yourself that Jesus Christ
is indeed the Alpha and Omega, the everlasting God. Find out
