### GUY FUNABIKI 
The elaborate Khmer civilization of ancient Cambodia, its initia
tion, development and decline was described to a Tuesday Evening
Series audience last night by Dr. John A. Pope, Director of the Freer
Gallery of Art of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. Using
colored slides, Dr. Pope spoke on "The Monuments of Angkor," a

historical study of the Hindu and
Buddhist monuments of the age.
The Khmer civilization was first
studied extensively by the French
under an archeological treaty with
Cambodia. Its elaborate edifices,
the marks of an extremely ad
vanced civilization, have been a
perpetual mystery to modern day
scholars.
The Khmer civilization was ini
tiated by Jayavarman I who de
clared himself god-king of the
royal cult. It reached its peak
during the realm of Jayavarman
VII, a vain man who ordered
large numbers of shrines to be
built in his honor. Such was the
cause of both the peak and rapid
decline of the Khmer civilization,
for Jayavarman Vll's extensive
building programs, highway sys
tems and hospitals depleted the
resources of his country.
Its subjects became dejected be
cause of the effort needed to build
these elaborate shrines and rev
enue fell drastically. Thus, Dr.
Pope explains, the decline of its
people, the loss of revenue and the
influx of a new religion.
Hinayana Buddhism appealed to
the broken people because it was
a democratic religion. It did not
require the pomp of an Ankor
Watt or the elaborateness that
Jayavarman VII demanded.
The Angkor Watt, adjacent to
the city of Ankor Thorn in Cam
bodia, is considered the "Ultimate
masterpiece of Khmer architec
ture." Its three terraced, moat
surrounded shrine, built jis a fu
neral monument by Jayavarman
VII for himself, contains 1 » mile
of low relief, six feet high, upon
its walls. The central feature is

the middle tower, a tomb-like
inner sanctum built to house the
I image of the Go Vishma. The
: steps leading to it. are awkwardly
| steep and are thought to symbol
ize man's ascension to the heav
! ens.
The reign of Jayavarman VII
was at once the peak of an ad
; vanced civilization and its nem
! esis, Dr. Pople concluded.
Dr. Pope was educated at Har
! vard, Yale and the Courtland In
stitute at the University of Lon-

The elaborate Khmer civilization of ancient Cambodia, its initia
tion, development and decline was described to a Tuesday Evening
Series audience last night by Dr. John A. Pope, Director of the Freer
Gallery of Art of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. Using
colored slides, Dr. Pope spoke on "The Monuments of Angkor," a

historical study of the Hindu and
Buddhist monuments of the age.
The Khmer civilization was first
studied extensively by the French
under an archeological treaty with
Cambodia. Its elaborate edifices,
the marks of an extremely ad
vanced civilization, have been a
perpetual mystery to modern day
scholars.
The Khmer civilization was ini
tiated by Jayavarman I who de
clared himself god-king of the
royal cult. It reached its peak
during the realm of Jayavarman
VII, a vain man who ordered
large numbers of shrines to be
built in his honor. Such was the
cause of both the peak and rapid
decline of the Khmer civilization,
for Jayavarman Vll's extensive
building programs, highway sys
tems and hospitals depleted the
resources of his country.
Its subjects became dejected be
cause of the effort needed to build
these elaborate shrines and rev
enue fell drastically. Thus, Dr.
Pope explains, the decline of its
people, the loss of revenue and the
influx of a new religion.
Hinayana Buddhism appealed to
the broken people because it was
a democratic religion. It did not
require the pomp of an Ankor
Watt or the elaborateness that
Jayavarman VII demanded.
The Angkor Watt, adjacent to
the city of Ankor Thorn in Cam
bodia, is considered the "Ultimate
masterpiece of Khmer architec
ture." Its three terraced, moat

VII for himself, contains 1 » mile
