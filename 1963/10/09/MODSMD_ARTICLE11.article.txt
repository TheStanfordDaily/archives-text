## 
### 
Dr. Fred C. Schwartz, Director
of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade, will speak tonight at
7:30 in Cubberley Auditorium on
"Communism, and the Continu
ing Global Crisis." Following the
speech the Stanford Student Con
gress will hold its first debate
meeting. The debate will concern
a resolution on the right to free
travel.
DR. SCHWARZ's speech is be
ing sponsored by the Stanford
Student Congress with the co
operation of the Political Union.
Dennis Sweeney, Student Con
gress Speaker, anticipates a lively
debate on the resolution because
of Dr. Schwarz's presence and be
cause of the recent program in
Holladay House featuring some
of the American students w ho
traveled in Cuba. The students
made the trip to Cuba despite a
State Department ban.
Membership lists for the Young
Republicans, the Democratic
Club, and an Independent Roster
will be circulated at the Student
Congress meeting tonight. It is
very important that students sign
one of these lists, Sweeney em
phasized, so that a Resolutiions
Committee can be chosen giving
proportional representation to all
factions of the Student Congress.
EXECUTIVES of both the Stan

ford Area Young Republicans
and the newly organized Stan
ford Democratic Club joined in
urging students to attend to
night's speech and debate. The
resolution to be debated tonight
was inspired by the State De
partment's restriction on travel
to Cuba.
The text of the resolution to be
presented for debate tonight is
as follows:

ticle 13, sec. 2 declares "the right
