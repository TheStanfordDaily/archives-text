# Dr. Fred Schwarz Speaks Today on Anti-Communism
## 
### 
Dr. Fred Schwarz, who will speak tonight at Cubberley Audito
j rium, founded his Christian Anti-Communism Crusade with the dual
: purpose of combating the growth of communism and propagating
! the Christian faith.
The organization was established in 1953 and lias its headquarters
i in Long Beach. California. Dr .Schwarz does not view the two pur
poses of his group as inseparable corollaries, but feels rather that
its Christian belief is simply a valuable motivating and unifying
force in the struggle against communism.
THE BASIC GOAL of the Crusade is to bring the public lo an
awareness of the nature of communism. Rather than concentrate
on individual actions of communist nations, the organization tries
to demonstrate the basic divergence between the communist philoso
phy and the ideal of Christian individualism.
The Crusade carries on its educational activities through the
publication and distribution of anti-communist literature and films
and through the presentation of public lectures.
The organization has held anti-communism schools in many of
the major cities across the nation. These schools are usually one
week in duration and consist primarily of lectures by Schwarz and
other leading anti-communists. Enrollments at some of these schools
has reached as high as 20,1)00. One such school was held in Oakland
two years ago.
THE CRUSADE also sponsors many small seminars or training
sessions and provides speakers for many groups interested in study
i ing communism.
On the international level the organization distributes translations
of its literature in many foreign nations, particularly those immedi
ately threatened with communist takeover.
The founder of the Christian Anti-Communism Crusade, Dr. Fred
Schwarz, was born in Brisbane, Australia in 1913. He was educated
at the University of Queensland where he received his degree in
J medicine and surgery. He has been a lecturer al Queensland Teach
