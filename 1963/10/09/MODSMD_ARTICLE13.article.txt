peace corps
Editor, The Daily:
The author or authors of Mon
day's composite letter to The
Daily haranguing ihe Peace Corps
are sadly misinformed both about
its aims and about the quality of
work being done by volunteers
abroad.
The Peace Corps does not ex
ist primarily for the purpose of
"selling America" or waging an j
"ideological struggle" against the j
Communists. The struggle of the
Peace Corps volunteer is on e
against disease, poverty, malnu
trition, ignorance and economic
underdevelopment. Working side
by side with the people of t he
host country, he trains them to
help themselves; such a relation
ship promotes a better mutual
understanding between the volun
teer and the people served. This
contact, incidentally, is a most
effective means of countering
anti-American propaganda.
True, these aims are broad,
"loosely defined." It would be im
possible (and undesirable) to
formulate rigid, specific instruc
tions applicable to every situa
tion encountered by Peace Corps
men. Thus the volunteer is rela
tively free to use his own intelli
gence and imagination to solve
the problems which confront him.
Idealistic? Yes; one doesn't
volunteer for the salary. Yet the
results of the Peace Corps pro
gram are very real: bigger har
vests gathered, slums cleared,
children educated, doctors
trained. And as for the attitudes
of the people served, the fact is
that, every host nation has re
quested at least double the origi
nal number of volunteers.
Peace Corps officials realize
that they aren't going to set the
world on fire, that mistakes will
be made, that volunteers will
have personal problems, and that
results wil be intangible. They
also realize that their "idealistic"
goals will, in part at least, be
come realities.

MR. GLOVER
Editor, The Daily:
One hopes always that one can
reason towards the eventual reso
lution of issues and that the con
testants agree at least in end (in
this case, the best good of the
University). Therefore, I wish to
point out what I feel are inade
quacies in the arguments of Mr.
Glover, cited Monday in The Daily
concerning both the Campus
Voice and the religious issue, and
ask for clarification.
He said about Campus Voice:
"We control solicitations here
just as we would with vacuum
cleaner salesmen: we prevent our
students from being harried."
Now, I think that the Campus
Voice should receive special con
sideration because unlike the va
cuum cleaner salesmen or indeed
the distributor of the Chronicle,
the students who wish to dis
tribute the Campus Voice are
themselves students and as such
aspire to stimulate the student
community of Stanford Univer
sity and the Bay Area. And,
therefore, I see no reason to re
strict the distribution of the Cam
pus Voice or to require notifica
tion months in advance so that
the spontaneity of such an effort j
is frustrated.
About the religious issue, Glov
er said, "It is the formal instruc
tion aspect, not the religious

| issue, that is the question. It
' would apply to the teaching of
aeronautical engineering or any
other subject as well." Now, it
seems to me that the distinction
between instruction and the free
practice of religion is quite pre
cariously based, especially when a
religion might be considered a
culture as well as an ethic. So
when the University restricts
formal instruction (which is not
otherwise provided) dealing with
the history, ritual, and language
of a culture, it is in fact exclud
ing the free practice of religion
from the campus. And. therefore,
I think that this formal instruc
tion is not at all the same as the
teaching of aeronautical engineer
ing and wish that Mr. Glover
would either clarify or redefine
the position of the Administra
tion.

ENCINA SIT-IN
Editor, The Daily:
It has been brought to my at
tention that under a new policy,
Encina head hashers and check
ers, unlike regular hashers, are
not allowed to eat meals at their
own dorms.
Here is another case of clear
cut discrimination by a powerful
private institution against a help
less minority group. Any member
of the general public is able to
eat meals at the Encina and Stern
dining halls. Arc not these head
hashers guaranteed an equal sta
tus with the other citizens of this
nation. Certainly the Constitu
tion does not give anyone the
right to discriminate simply on
the basis of another person's eco
nomic position in society, especi
ally when acting in a quasi-pub
lic capacity. These hashers are
no less human than we; it is not
our right to say, "The rest of the
public can eat anywhere, but you
must eat at Encina."
Can Stanford truly become a
great university if such acts of
prejudice are allowed to con
tinue? I think not. The time has
come for all ASSU to join in the
march against the oppressive poli
cies of Encina dining hall. The
consequences may indeed be
grave: bombings at the elemen
tary school; federal troops and
Stanford police battling rocks and
bottles thrown by the angry En
cina administration. But if we let
this pass, the real freedom of
Stanford students may be forever
lost. Head hashers now, but who
knows what poor group may be
next.
Sit-ins begin tomorrow on the
Encina East side.
