# Soviets to Regulate Graduates' Careers
## 
### 
(Student Mirror) A new Soviet
educational decree has tightened
control over college graduates to
insure that they apply their train
ing in the national interest. Start
ing with the school year that
opened in September, students
will be awarded only temporary
certificates upon graduation.
According to the Government
directive, the student will receive
his official diploma a year after
graduation on the basis of a
recommendation from the place
of employment to which the stu
dent has been assigned. The pro
cedure is apparently designed to
make certain that college gradu
ates perform satisfactorily in in
dustry, agriculture and other oc
cupations after having received
a higher education, which is free
in the Soviet Union.
In return for their education,
Soviet graduates are abliged to
accept a three-year appointment
to any place they are assigned.
The decree is evidently also in
tended to reduce the heavy turn
over in jobs in Siberian areas,
which young college graduates
usually leave because of poor
living conditions as soon as the
three-year compulsory employ
ment term expires. The delayed
award of diplomas is one of sev
eral reforms that go into effect
in the new school year. In keep
ing with the growing attention
to ideological matters, all college
students will be taking a fourth
compulsory course, in social
sciences to strengthen their Com
munist convictions. The new
course, "Principles of Scientific
Communism," will be in addition
to the history of the Communist
Party, Marxist-Leninist philoso
phy and political economy, which

have been required of all stu
dents. In an effort to encourage
college students to do more inde
pendent reading and research, au
thorities are sharply reducing the
time required for compulsory
courses. Instead, six hours of
optional subjects a week are be
ing introduced into the college
curriculum.
