STANFORD-Lord Acton's fa
miliar dictum that "power tends
to corrupt and absolute power
corrupts absolutely" comes in for
sharp criticism in a new book
just issued by Prentice-Hall Inc.
The authors, Arnold A. Rogow,
associate professor of political
science at Stanford and Harold D.
Lasswell, professor of law a n d
political science at Yale, say that
Acton was guilty of "gross over
simplification of the facts."
Power also enobles and power
lessness also corrupts or enobles,
the authors declare, adding that
"the method of political thought
exemplified by Acton is exceed
ingly inappropriate to the exami
nation of politics.'
IN FACT, the two political
scientists argue, the eminent Vic
torian's political principle has
held back the growth of proper
strategy for the exercise of
shared power in America.
"The ideolgy of human dignity
is very strong in American civili
zation," the authors say. "Much
of the confusion, uncertainty, con
flict — even corruption — char
acteristic of American life is due
to the vitality of our ideological
orientation.
"The conception of the worth
of individuality, and of the obliga
tion to correct whatever stands in
the way of a social order based
upon merit, is sufficiently potent
to maintain . . . self-appraisal and
to inspire the perpetual recon
struction of American personality
and culture in accord with the

ideals of human dignity."
This ideology, they conclude, is
strong among us "because it pro
vides a built-inchallenge to scruti
nize individual and group prac
tices from (he point of view of
the contributions they make, or
fail to make, to the goal.
"THIS CHALLENGE is a cor
rosive and creative component of
individual personality and of the
culture of every subgroup in
American society.
'This built-in component sooner
or laier challenges undemocratic
practices in government and the
economy; it makes caste take the
defensive; it distrusts and chal
lenges secrecy and all measures
that deny public enlightenment;
it questions every ritualized
claim to rectitude and demands
that it be re-evaluated in terms
of the whole of human experi
ence.
"It demands, in short, 'physi
cian, heal thyself.' "
DR. ROGOW, educated at Wis
consin and Princeton, is the au
thor or editor of five books and
more than 30 articles in profes
sional journals. His intimate
study of former Secretary of the
Navy James Forrestal will be
issued by Macmillan next month.
Dr. Lasswell was educated at
the University of Chicago. He
has held posts in the Library of
Congress, the Department of Jus
tice and the State Department;.
He is best known for his book,
"Psychopathology and Politics."
Both authors were fellows at
the Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences on the
Stanford campus when plans fox 1
the book were made in 1954-55.
