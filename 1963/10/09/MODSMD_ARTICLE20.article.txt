Looming out of Smogville as
consensus choices to repeat as
AAWU champs the 19G3 Trojan
football squad returns 27 letter
men. including seven starters,
from last year's team.
Most feared among the re
turnees are the "B" boys, Beat
hard, Bedsole, Brown, and Bame.
all of whom gained All-American
recognition, Bedsole and Bame
first team honors, Bet hard a n d
Brown honorable mention.
FETE BEATIIARD, a master
at. the rollout option, vital in
Troy's offense last fall, gained
267 yards rushing, and completed
50 percent of his passes for 918
yards, placing second AAWU
wise in total offense. Bedsole,

picking off most of Bethar Ps
pitches, hauled in 33 catches for
827 yards and 11 TDs.
Willie Brown, hard charging
halfback, led the 1962 Trojan
team in rushing with a good sev
en yards per carry average, and
was second in pass receiving,
while also leading the team in
punt returns, interception returns
and kickoff returns.
Damon Bame, giving opponents
headaches on defense, led USC
in tackles from his linebacking
position. He was named AAWU
Lineman-of-the-Week three times,
while his play against Stanford
earned him similar national
honors from the Associated
Press.
RETURNING STARTERS Gary
Kirner, Pete Lubisich, and Larry
Sagouspe, who all gained All-
AAWU team positions last fall,
bolster the Trojan line at tackle,
guard and center respectively.
Sophomore speedster Mike Gar
rett has shown well at halfback
this fall to lead the AAWU in
yards gained per carry, with a
sharp 8.5 average. His running
gives Troy a potent one-two half
back punch.
So far this season Ihe USC of
fense has failed to reach its 1962
form. Beathard, in three tilts, has
connected on only 36 percent of
his tosses, while Bedsole, blanked
until the Michigan State-USC
game last Friday, has caught less
than five passes. On the ground,
USC has amased only 142 yards
per game this fall, scoring ten
points in the final frame of the

Michigan St ate conlest, however,
the Trojans showed signs of
reaching top offensive form. De
fensively, the 1963 squad has ex
reeded last fall's total defensive
average.
Despite making a slower start
this fall than last, the Trojan
team has no peers in the AAWU,
standing an excellent chance of
retaining the league crown.
PK KKI) GENERALLY to fin
ish behind USC in the AAWU
race, the University of Washing
ton football team has failed to
jell this fall, losing its first three
contests.
The loss for the season of All-
Coast fullback Junior Coffey
one of four top returning starters,
has undoubtedly hurt the Husk
ies. With Coffey out, the fine
pair of guards, Rick Redman and
Rick Sortun head the list of 1G
Husky lettermen. Redman, who
handles the punting chores
gained All-Coast first team status,
while Sortun earned AAWU
honorable mention. Tackle Mike
Briggs, All-Coast second team,
completes a trio of to p Husky

interior linemen.
CHARLIE BROWNING has
taken over the fulback job credit
ably, leading the Huskies in yards
gained per carry this season. He
is third In AAWU rushing. Let
termen Bill Siler and Bill Doug
las return with plenty of experi
ence at quarterback.
After being held to 186 yards
gained by Air Force, the Husky
offence has improved in each of
the succeeding two games. A sig
nificant passing attack, however,
has been missing, as Washington
quarterbacks have completed only
37 percent of their passes, for a
meager 48 yards per game.
ON DEFENSE, leaky pass pro
tection has allowed opponents a
53 percent completion rate, for
115 yards per contest, while rush
ing-wise, opponents have out
gained Washington on the ground
in two of three games this season.
Though th e Huskies won't
challenge the Trojans for the
league title they have yet to
reach full potential, and should
still be in the thick of the first
division fight.
