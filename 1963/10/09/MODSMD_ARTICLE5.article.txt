sand cheering Negroes Monday that this troubled city must meet
Negro demands or face demonstrations "bigger than ever before."
"If the conditions that brought on the dynamiting and the death
of four beautiful little girls are not changed we will put on our
walking shoes and demonstrate all over town," King said.
King announced a $5,000 contribution from his Southern Christian
Leadership Conference to the 16th Street Baptist Church, shattered
by a dynamite blast Sept. 13 that Killed four girls in a Sunday school
class.
Another of the speakers at the mass rally was the Rev. John
Cross, pastor of the bombed church.
"Surely there always will be something on the corner of 16th
Street," he said. "Surely there will be something to commemorate
those four little girls. "So help mo God, somthing will be there.
Let them live on in our hearts and memories."
HURRICANE HITS HAITI-MIAMI Hurricane Flora broke out
of Cuba Tuesday after an eight day rampage that left entire towns
demolished and a death toll which may climb to more than 5,000
persons in the Carribbean. It sot a new course across the U.S. At

double."
In New York, a spokesman for CARE, the international relief

if a bomb hit" and said $110,000 in food and other relief supplies
were being distributed.
