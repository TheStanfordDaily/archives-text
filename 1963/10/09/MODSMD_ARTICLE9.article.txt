# Volunteers Entertain Psychotics
## 
### 
Meeting behind the bookstore
at 7:15 every Wednesday evening
are members of the Stanford
Mental Health Field Work Proj
ect. This volunteer group travels
weekly to the Menlo Park VA
(Mental) Hospital. There they
participate with the patients in
such activities as volleyball, bowl
ing. roller skating and an occa
sional party.
Through the program, which
has been in operation for about,
a year and nine months, the Stan
ford group has been affiliated
with Ward 202A-I in the Con
tinued Treatment Service. The
175 patients in this group arc suf
fering from what Recreation Di
rector Stnaley Epstein terms as
"Institutionalism Syndrome," as
well as a primary illness, usually
schizophrenia.
EPSTEIN CALLS INSTITU
TIONALISM, "One of the great
est problems facing the staff of
even the most modern mental in
stitutions. It is usually evidenced
in wards of long-term chronic pa
tients, its symptoms being apathy,
resignation, a n d dependence.
Thus, the patient is fearful of
leaving the security of the hos
pital and rejoining society."
The goals of the. Ward staff as
outlined by Ward Director Dr. L.
D. Smith are to increase the ac
tivity level of the patient, to in
crease the amount of social inter
action among patients, and to
increase the amount of respon
sibility assumed by each patient
for himself and for others.
"This," reports Dr. Smith, "is
where the students come in. Act
ing as hosts and hostesses for the
ward parties and participating in
the various recreational activities,
the student volunteer brings to
the Hospital an invaluable asset,
as the patients seem to respond
more readily to him.
I)K. SMITH FEELS that "This
empathy is due to the fact that
the patients know that the volun
teer is here out of a real desire
to help and understand, not for a
monitary reward for his time and
effort."
Judging from their comments,
the students feel that they are
gaining greatly from their par
ticipation in the program. One
volunteer reports that "I brought
with me a tremendous number of
stereotyped ideas that didn't fit
the situation at hand."
"I found the people to have a
quality of warmth and meaning
fulness, perhaps because of all
the suffering they've gone
through, perhaps from the help
they've received here at the hos
pital. perhaps due to the group
therapy, helpful because there
they learn to talk of themselevs
and their problems in an environ
ment beyond commendation, and
judgments.
"THEIR CONVERSATION is
human and deep and real . . . be
yond the trivia of the latest gos
sip, the latest movie . . . beyond
intellectualism, beyond theoriz
ing. I usually come away feeling
a few more barriers in my mind
have been washed away, and that
I've made another step towards
understanding human nature."
Students interested in partic
ipating in this year's program are
advised to contact Max Zeig, pres
ent co-chairman, at 327-4078.
