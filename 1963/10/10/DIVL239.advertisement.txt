What Kind of Fool Are You?
(a) 'The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth
to counsel is wise.' Prov. 12:15
(b) "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Ps. 53:1
(c) ' Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to
be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be
wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God."
I Cor. 3:18,19
(d) "... The preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolish
ness, but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God. I Cor.
1:18
(e) "We are fools for Christ's sake." I Cor. 4:10
