# Larimer Resigns Position As Associate Dean of Men
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
Associate Dean of Men David Larimer has resigned from his
Stanford position, effective October 31.
I-Ie will become assistant to a vice-President at Union Bank in Los
Angeles. Larimer was an economics major as a Stanford under
graduate and received his Masters of Business Administration decree

at Stanford business school in
1953.
"I HAVE thought for some
time of going into business,"
commented the Dean on his deci
sion. I was in business before,
and a particularly good oppor
tunity came up for me with
Union bank.
"I have had a dilemma," he con
tinued. "I love being in an edu
cational setting, yet have a strong
bent towards business too. I can't
do both at the same time; this
is my compromise."
From 1956 to 1958, Larimer
was a division sales manger for
the Utah Oil Refining Company
in Salt Lake City.
He said he doubts if he will
return to the academic commu
nity. "I will always take a strong
interest in education as a layman,
but find a return unlikely. I am
making the switch with the inten
tion of it being permanent."
LARIMER'S ties with Stanford
have been strong. In 1951, he was
president of the Interfraternity
Council, and was a president of
Phi Gamma Delta. When asked
why he initially entered adminis
tration at Stanford, he replied,
"When I was a graduate student,
I was an RA at Toyon and En
eina with the freshmen. I just
enjoyed the collegiate life and
being an RA.
"I had gotten to know some
members of the administration—
I had been Rixford Snyder's
gardener during school. After I
left, I was asked if I were inter
ested in coming back and work
ing with them. I had always con
sidered academic work."
When asked what about Stan
ford he would most like to see
changed, he chose "the general
tension between segments of the
student body and segments of
the faculty and the administra
tion. 1 have always felt that some
of this is inevitable, but some of
it is also unnecessary.
Larimer's own contact with stu
dents has been close and varied.
In addition to his activities as a
Stanford student, he was direc
tor of Stern Hall and assistant
Dean of Men from 1958 to 1961.
He was named assistant dean of
men for fraternities in 1961, and
was acting dean of men last year.
In addition to his official duties,
he has worked in the area of
student-faculty relations and as
a member of the student-faculty
board.
THE GREATEST change Lari
mer has seen throughout hi s
years at Stanford is in "the in
terests and serious concerns of
the students. There is much
broader interest and perspective
than when I was a student; we
were more provincial."
"The biggest change I have
noticed in the increase in quality
in the University, in terms of stu
dents, teaching, the nature of re
search done, buildings.
"Since the post-war era the Uni
versity has been extremely am
bitious to upgrade itself. This is
a major and positive change.
Some of the tensions existing are
just the result of growing pains.
Whenever you have pronounced
change like that, there is bound
to be some friction along the
way," Larimer concluded.

THE GREATEST change Lari

years at Stanford is in "the in

the students. There is much
broader interest and perspective

"The biggest change I have

DEAN OF STUDENTS 11. Don

"As one who has known him

Associate Dean of Men David Larimer has resigned from his
Stanford position, effective October 31.
I-Ie will become assistant to a vice-President at Union Bank in Los
Angeles. Larimer was an economics major as a Stanford under
graduate and received his Masters of Business Administration decree

at Stanford business school in
1953.
"I HAVE thought for some
time of going into business,"
commented the Dean on his deci
sion. I was in business before,
and a particularly good oppor
tunity came up for me with
Union bank.
"I have had a dilemma," he con
tinued. "I love being in an edu
cational setting, yet have a strong
bent towards business too. I can't
do both at the same time; this
is my compromise."
From 1956 to 1958, Larimer
was a division sales manger for
the Utah Oil Refining Company
in Salt Lake City.
He said he doubts if he will
return to the academic commu
nity. "I will always take a strong
interest in education as a layman,
but find a return unlikely. I am
making the switch with the inten
tion of it being permanent."
LARIMER'S ties with Stanford
have been strong. In 1951, he was
president of the Interfraternity
Council, and was a president of
Phi Gamma Delta. When asked
why he initially entered adminis
tration at Stanford, he replied,
"When I was a graduate student,
I was an RA at Toyon and En
eina with the freshmen. I just
enjoyed the collegiate life and
being an RA.
"I had gotten to know some
members of the administration—
I had been Rixford Snyder's
gardener during school. After I
left, I was asked if I were inter
ested in coming back and work
ing with them. I had always con
sidered academic work."
When asked what about Stan

changed, he chose "the general
tension between segments of the
student body and segments of
the faculty and the administra

"I have had a dilemma," he con
tinued. "I love being in an edu
cational setting, yet have a strong
bent towards business too. I can't
do both at the same time; this
is my compromise."
From 1956 to 1958, Larimer
was a division sales manger for
the Utah Oil Refining Company
in Salt Lake City.
He said he doubts if he will
return to the academic commu
nity. "I will always take a strong
interest in education as a layman,
but find a return unlikely. I am
making the switch with the inten
tion of it being permanent."
LARIMER'S ties with Stanford
have been strong. In 1951, he was
president of the Interfraternity
Council, and was a president of
Phi Gamma Delta. When asked
why he initially entered adminis
tration at Stanford, he replied,
"When I was a graduate student,
I was an RA at Toyon and En
eina with the freshmen. I just
enjoyed the collegiate life and
being an RA.
"I had gotten to know some
members of the administration—
I had been Rixford Snyder's
gardener during school. After I
left, I was asked if I were inter
ested in coming back and work
ing with them. I had always con
sidered academic work."
When asked what about Stan
ford he would most like to see
changed, he chose "the general
tension between segments of the
student body and segments of
the faculty and the administra
tion. 1 have always felt that some
of this is inevitable, but some of
it is also unnecessary.
Larimer's own contact with stu
dents has been close and varied.
In addition to his activities as a
Stanford student, he was direc
tor of Stern Hall and assistant
Dean of Men from 1958 to 1961.
He was named assistant dean of
men for fraternities in 1961, and
was acting dean of men last year.
In addition to his official duties,
he has worked in the area of
student-faculty relations and as
a member of the student-faculty
board.
THE GREATEST change Lari
mer has seen throughout hi s
years at Stanford is in "the in
terests and serious concerns of
the students. There is much
broader interest and perspective
than when I was a student; we
were more provincial."
"The biggest change I have
noticed in the increase in quality
in the University, in terms of stu
dents, teaching, the nature of re
search done, buildings.
"Since the post-war era the Uni
versity has been extremely am
bitious to upgrade itself. This is
a major and positive change.
Some of the tensions existing are
just the result of growing pains.
Whenever you have pronounced
change like that, there is bound
to be some friction along the
way," Larimer concluded.

DEAN OF STUDENTS 11. Don
ald Winbigler commented, "First
as a student, then as director of
Stein Hall, assistant dean of men
and acting dean of men, Mr. Lari
mer has made many valuable con
tributions to student life at Stan
ford.
"As one who has known him
for more than 15 years and who
has worked closely with him pro
fessionally for t ho past five years,
I share the great affection a n d
respect which Dean Larimer's
many friends hold for him and
the regret at his departure.
"He is accepting a challenging
position in a business sector
which has a very promising fu
ture. I join with the host of his
friends in extending best wishes
to him and his family."
Associate Dean of Men David Larimer has resigned from his
Stanford position, effective October 31.
I-Ie will become assistant to a vice-President at Union Bank in Los
Angeles. Larimer was an economics major as a Stanford under
graduate and received his Masters of Business Administration decree

at Stanford business school in
1953.
"I HAVE thought for some
time of going into business,"
commented the Dean on his deci
sion. I was in business before,
and a particularly good oppor
tunity came up for me with
Union bank.
