# Stanford-in- Washington Completes Summer Session
## 
### LINDA HESS Contributing Editor 
Stanford's newest foreign cam
pus has just completed its first
summer session, and all informa
tion indicates that it was an out
standing success.
Members of the pilot group re
port that they were in constant
contact with the natives and that
they had very little difficulty in
surmounting the language barrier.
WHERE HAVE the creeping
branches of the University most
recently taken root? In Washing
ton, D.C.. where this summer four
teen Stanford students worked in
the offices of various senators and
congressmen, learning the ropes
of government and politics.
Stanford students on Capitol
Hill this summer had a first-hand
view of some of the most impor
tant issues and events in the na
tion's history: the initiation of the
great legislative struggle over
civil rights; the sociological revo
lution powerfully asserted by the
March on Washington; and the
congressional hearings on the nu
clear test ban treaty. They par
ticipated in the workings of Con
gress in many capacities and had
access to a broad spectrum of ac
tivities and personalities in the
Capitol.
Stanford-in-Washington was in
the consideration and planning
stages for two years before its
realization this summer. It all be
gan when Jamie Hunter, now a
third-year law student, brought
tlie idea to the Farm after having
participated in a similar program
as a Yale undergraduate. 11 was
under his leadership that the no
tion of a Stanford "political in
ternship" program in Washing
ton became a reality.
EARLY in 1963 ASSU President
Armin Rosencranz went to Wash
ington and called on numerous
prospective employers in the
House and Senate. Meanwhile stu
dent applications were taken on
campus and, after preliminary
screening, Chairman Hunter took
the applications to Washington
where employers confirmed their
commitments and made the final
selections.
Some of the offices paid full
salaries, some part, and some

none at all. Through the W. T.
Grant Foundation of New York,
full or partial fellowships were
awarded to those students not
sufficiently salaried by their of
fices.
Then of the fourteen interns
have returned to the campus this
year. These include undergrad
uates Bob Burke, Fred Nelson,
Susan Westerberg, Doug Parker,
Bob Ronka, and Linda Hess;
PhD. candidate Tom Cronin; and
law students Lee Carlson. Tom
Von Stein, and Tac Craven. The
others are scattered over the
world: Ron Bass is pursuing his
studies at Yale on a Wilson schol
arship; Sally Davenport is a
'Peace Corps trainee headed for
(Tanganyika; Jim Woolsey is a
Rhodes scholar at Oxford.
STANFORD STUDENTS fre
j quently have cause to note the
contrast between life as it pro
i ceeds in orderly sequence behind
the sandstone walls, and as it
j careens along 'out there' in a
place we tend to think of as the
' real world. The Washington in
terns experienced this contrast
j sharply. Just as the students who
I attend overseas campuses, the
j congressional interns discovered
; first-hand how much the history
I books leave out. Whether they
went with an excess of idealism
: or of cynicism, the preconceptions
which had grown out of class
room experience were quickly
jarred to make way for reality.
Many people arc now asking
the question, "Where will the
Stanford Foreign Campus strike
next?" Rumors have circulated
that the campus is the initial step
in a nationwide plan destined
eventually to close in on the
Peninsula: first Washington, then
maybe Stanford-in-Duluth. Talla
hassee, Salt Lake City, and fin
ally (the ultimate triumph!),
Stanford-in-Berkeley. It should be
added that these rumors have
been denied by official sources.
But there is no question that the
University is branching out at an
accelerated pace, and the day may
yet come when the Palo Alto Cen
ter will be known simply as the
Stanford of the West.
