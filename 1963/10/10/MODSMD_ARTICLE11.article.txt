# Larimer Resignation: A Loss to Stanford
## 
### 
Classical scholar Francis Cornforcl lias written of Socrates
that lie "was ready to converse with anyone; but above all
he welcomed (lie company of the adolescent young. They
found in him exactly what youth needs ... a man whose
proved courage they could respect and admire, and whose
subtle intellect was always at the service of the youthful
passion for argument. He would never silence their crude
questionings with the superior tone of adult experience; he
wanted to know all that was going on in their minds, and
positively encouraged them to think for themselves on every
subject, and especially about right and wrong. . . .
"Here was one who had found the secret of life, and
achieved in his own character a balance and harmony which
nothing could disturb. I lis time was always at the disposal
of anyone who would set about discovering that secret for
himself—above all, the youth whose obscure but pressing need
was to achieve the freedom of self-ruling manhood."
Whatever the verdict of Athens, it would seem that the
philosophy embodied here would serve as the code of the
ideal person and approach in the governing of a university
whose main goal is to assist "the adolescent young . . . to
achieve the freedom of self-ruling manhood."
The Stanford Dean of Men's office has been notable in
attracting the type of person who takes this approach and
embodies these qualities. Regretably, several of them are no
longer with Stanford. It was this type of man Stanford lost
in 1962 with the departure of then Dean of Men Gordon Craig
and Assistant Dean of Men Allard Lowenstein.
We have incurred another loss. In three weeks, Associate
Dean of Men David Larimer will leave the Stanford Commu
nity. lie is a man devoted to the student. His work with
fraternities and in the area of student-faculty relations has
been perceptive and deep. As an associate dean, and as Act
ing Dean of Men last year, he has made integrity his over
whelming characteristic.
It can only be hoped that these losses are coincidental and
not a commentary upon any facet of Stanford; and that an
other man of this calibre w ill be sought and found.
Dean Larimer is wished every success in his new position;
he will be sorely missed.

was to achieve the freedom of self-ruling manhood."
Whatever the verdict of Athens, it would seem that the
philosophy embodied here would serve as the code of the
ideal person and approach in the governing of a university
whose main goal is to assist "the adolescent young . . . to
achieve the freedom of self-ruling manhood."
The Stanford Dean of Men's office has been notable in
attracting the type of person who takes this approach and
embodies these qualities. Regretably, several of them are no
longer with Stanford. It was this type of man Stanford lost
in 1962 with the departure of then Dean of Men Gordon Craig
and Assistant Dean of Men Allard Lowenstein.
We have incurred another loss. In three weeks, Associate
Dean of Men David Larimer will leave the Stanford Commu
nity. lie is a man devoted to the student. His work with
fraternities and in the area of student-faculty relations has
been perceptive and deep. As an associate dean, and as Act
ing Dean of Men last year, he has made integrity his over
whelming characteristic.
It can only be hoped that these losses are coincidental and
not a commentary upon any facet of Stanford; and that an
other man of this calibre w ill be sought and found.
Dean Larimer is wished every success in his new position;
he will be sorely missed.
Classical scholar Francis Cornforcl lias written of Socrates
that lie "was ready to converse with anyone; but above all
he welcomed (lie company of the adolescent young. They
found in him exactly what youth needs ... a man whose
proved courage they could respect and admire, and whose
subtle intellect was always at the service of the youthful
passion for argument. He would never silence their crude
questionings with the superior tone of adult experience; he
wanted to know all that was going on in their minds, and
positively encouraged them to think for themselves on every
subject, and especially about right and wrong. . . .
"Here was one who had found the secret of life, and
achieved in his own character a balance and harmony which
nothing could disturb. I lis time was always at the disposal
of anyone who would set about discovering that secret for
himself—above all, the youth whose obscure but pressing need
was to achieve the freedom of self-ruling manhood."
