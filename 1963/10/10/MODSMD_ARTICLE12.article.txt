# Shriver and Staff Are Welcome Guests
## 
### 
Sargent Shriver is a most welcome visitor to the Stanford
campus. And the presence of key members of Shriver's staff
throughout this week is most appropriate to Stanford. Stan
ford is one of the leading schools in the nation in its percent
age of Peace Corps volunteers. The Stanford volunteers are
of a high level: of the first fifty-seven volunteers from Stan
ford, fifty-five had at least a Bachelor of Arts degree.
In 1960 a large number of Stanford people were among
the crowd gathered in the San Francisco Cow Palace to hear
one of President Kennedy's last major addresses before the
election. He spoke of the establishment of a Peace Corps,
and the audience roared its enthusiasm. Few people, how
ever, would have expected the Peace Corps of 1963 to be
the established success that it is.
The Peace Corps is a child of the times. It is idealism
securely wrapped in direct-action pragmatism. The Peace
Corps staff will no doubt be enthusiastically received here,
during what LASSU has proclaimed as "Peace Corps Week."
It is an honor to Stanford to host them.
