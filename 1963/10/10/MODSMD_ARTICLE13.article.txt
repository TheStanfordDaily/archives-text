(Reprinted below is the full
text of the revised statement
"The Government and Conduct
of Students —The Fundamental
Standard and the Honor Code,"
as approved by the Board of
Trustees at their September 11)
meeting:. It will he included in
the Stanford information Bulle
tin of January, 1964, replacing
page 101 of the 1963 Bulletin.)
"In student affairs, Stanford
seeks the largest individual lib
erty consistent with good work
and orderly conduct.
"The authority and responsibil
ity for student conduct and dis
cipline have been vested in th c
President of the University by the
Board of Trustees. The Dean of
Students is the representative of
the President in all matters relat
ing to student activities, conduct,
and discipline. The Faculty Com
mittee on Student Affairs and
Services is appointed by the
President and serves as an ad
visory group to him and the Dean
of Students in this area.
"IN ORDER to encourage re
sponsible citizenship and the exer
cise of individaul and corporate
responsibility on the part of stu
dents in the government of stu
dent affairs and activities, the
University has authorized the
Associated Students of Stanford
University to exercise major
privileges a n d responsibilities
through its constitution and in a
manner consistent with the poli
cies and regulations established
by the University through the
President of the University and
the Board of Trustees.
"Students are expected to ob
serve the Fundamental Standard
of student conduct, which was
stated as follows by Stanford's
first President, David Starr Jor
dan:
'Students arc expected to show
both within and without Ihe Uni
versity such respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the
rights of others as is demanded
of good citizens. Failure to ob
serve this will be sufficient cause
for removal from the University.'

This statement has been incor
porated as Article 1, Section 1, of
the Bylaws of the Associated Stu
dents.
"The ASSU constitution pro
vides for judicial enforcement of
this standard in most cases by
students. This is achieved pri
marily through the Student Judi
cial Council, which is composed
of Men's and Women's Councils.
These Councils have both investi
gative and judicial responsibili
ties. They may act either on their
own initiative or upon the refer
ral of specific cases to them by
the University.
"THESE COUNCILS and their
decisions are designed to be con
structive. helpful and educative,
rather than solely punitive. They
act in an orderly manner, dealing
not only with actual violations
but also with thoughtless acts
which may erroneously give th e
impression of violations.
"Men's and Women's Councils
meet separately to hear cases of
nonacademic violations of the
Fundamental Standard involving
men and women, respectively.
They meet jointly, as the Student
Judicial Council, to hear evidence
and act on reported infringe
ments of proper standards of aca
demic conduct. There is also pro
vision for various subordinate
judicial councils which function
under the supervision of the Judi
cial Council.
"The Honor Code at Stanford
is essentially the application of
the Fundamental Standard to
academic matters. Provisions of
the Code date from 1921 when
the honor system was established
by the Academic Council of the
University Faculty at the request
of the student body and with the
approval of the President.
"BY THEIR registration at ihe
University, all students affirm
'that they will not give or receive
aid on examinations; that they
will not receive unpermitted aid
in class work, in the preparation
of reports, or in any other work
that is to be used by the instruc
tor as the basis of grading.'

"The Code stems from belief
that optimum academic perform
ance is possible only in an atmos
phere of trust, rather than in one
of suspicion. The Code places
great emphasis on individual in
tegrity. It places responsibility
for honesty in academic work 1 >
in the individual student, 2) in
students majoring in a particular
school or department, and 3) in
the Student Judicial Council,
which exercises general supervi
sory control and has the power to
adopt regulations in this area.
"The findings of Student Judi
cial Councils are submitted as
recommendations to the Dean of
Students.
'The use or possession by stu
dents of intoxicating liquors of

any kind on the Stanford campus
(except in Married Student Hous
ing) is prohibited by the Univer
sity.
"Attendance at Ihe University
is a privilege, not a right. The
University may withhold regis
tration from or require the with
drawal of any student whose aca
demic performance is deemed un
satisfactory, who fails to abide by
University regulations, or whose
social conduct, personal habits or
moral character are deemed detri
mental by the University. Regis
tration as a student constitutes
full acceptance of the Funda
mental Standard and the Honor
Code as well as all other Univer
sity rules and standards of con
duct."
