PRESIDENT'S COMMITTEES
Editor, The Daily:
The following facts may help
keep discussion of student partici
pation on Presidential Commit
tees in proper perspective:
1) Both faculty and student,
members on the Student Affairs
and Services Committee are be
ing reduced, on the recommenda
tion of the committee chairman
and with the approval of the
President.
2) Students now serve on seven
Presidential Committees. Their
total representation on these com
mittees this year will be 24, an
increase ot 1 over last year.
The committees, this year's rep
resentation, and last year's rep
resentation (shown in paren
thesis) are: Student Affairs and
Services. 3 (5); PACE Advisory,
6 (6); Foreign Visitors and Stu
dents, 3 (3); Stanford Today Edi
torial Advisory Committee, 1(1);
Public Heallh, 3 (1); Public Ex
ercises, 3 (3): Union, 5 (5).

3) Members of the Stanford
Union Committee are chosen in
accord with its Constitution,
which was approved by the Trus
tees in 19f>9. In selecting mem
bers for the other six committees,
the President draws on a wide
variety of sources, including the
Nominating Committee of the
Academic Council's Executive
Committe, the ASSU president,
the Presidential Committee chair
men, individual recommendations,
and suggestions from those re
sponsible for day-to-day opera
tions in a particular field.
While a wide range of individ
ual views will lie found on these
committees, their members are
chosen by the President and serve
in an advisory capacity 1o him.
The Presidential committees are
not groups of representatives
chosen separately by the faculty,
the student body, and the ad
ministration.
