# Group From Stanford Abroad Takes Two-Week USSR Tour
## 
### JOHN C. SPENCE 
This last summer, 27 students from Stanford's three European
campuses spent 19 days touring the Soviet Union, Poland and Hun
gary. While the trip included the usual sightseeing attractions in
the USSR, the visit was unique in that we, as a group and as in
dividuals, had a large measure of personal contact with Soviet stu
dents.
Although we spent hut 13 days in the Soviet Union itself, I feel
that we were able to gain some insight into the lives of students in
the USSR. One evening in Moscow, for example, our group was
hosted by the Young Communist League of Moscow at an informal
party. After speeches and introductions, we broke up into small dis
cussion groups. Through an English-Russian interpreter, I spoke at
length with a woman who teaches elementary and secondary school
in the Soviet Union. I found that it was quite difficult to discuss
problems of significance objectively with her, since we came from
such widely different backgrounds.
IX OIIR DISCUSSIONS, we would argue from completely dif
ferent premises and assumptions. If we reached some common
ground of understanding, a minute later we would be at opposite
poles. . . . For instance, we talked about national "objectives" of the
United States and the Soviet Union. We both agreed that basic to
our two countries' foreign policy is a belief in "the self-dtermination
of nations." Then, however, my Soviet, "conversational partner"
asked me, "why does the United States try to keep the nations of
Latin America under the imperialist yoke!"
THE SOVIET schoolteacher was surprised that I, a non-Marxist
Westerner, was interested in some of the philosophy and theoreti
cal problems of Marxism. What surprised her even more was my
telling her that "Comparative Marxist Theory" is offered by the
Political Science Department at Stanford, a presumably "bourgeois"
University.
In another conversation, this time at the main campus of Moscow
State University, a follow Stanford student, Sue Cline, and I talked
for a while with a young woman student majoring in advanced
mathematics and cybernetics. Our conversation, in French, ranged
from American literature that is popular in the USSR to Franco's
Spain. In connection with this last point, the Soviet student re
marked that she thought that Fascists and NeoNazis were quite
prominent and influential in American politics today. Moreover,
she felt that such "extremists," for uttering "dangerous" ideas,
ought to be deprived of all civil liberties.
This student was amazed when Miss Cline and I told her that
people at both ends of the political spectrumi in the United Slates—
Communist as well as Fascist —are allowed to speak out, but people,
in general, don't pay any attention to them.

asked me, "why does the United States try to keep the nations of
Latin America under the imperialist yoke!"
THE SOVIET schoolteacher was surprised that I, a non-Marxist
Westerner, was interested in some of the philosophy and theoreti
cal problems of Marxism. What surprised her even more was my
telling her that "Comparative Marxist Theory" is offered by the
Political Science Department at Stanford, a presumably "bourgeois"
University.
In another conversation, this time at the main campus of Moscow
State University, a follow Stanford student, Sue Cline, and I talked
for a while with a young woman student majoring in advanced
mathematics and cybernetics. Our conversation, in French, ranged
from American literature that is popular in the USSR to Franco's
Spain. In connection with this last point, the Soviet student re
marked that she thought that Fascists and NeoNazis were quite
prominent and influential in American politics today. Moreover,
she felt that such "extremists," for uttering "dangerous" ideas,
ought to be deprived of all civil liberties.
This student was amazed when Miss Cline and I told her that
people at both ends of the political spectrumi in the United Slates—
Communist as well as Fascist —are allowed to speak out, but people,
in general, don't pay any attention to them.
This last summer, 27 students from Stanford's three European
campuses spent 19 days touring the Soviet Union, Poland and Hun
gary. While the trip included the usual sightseeing attractions in
the USSR, the visit was unique in that we, as a group and as in
dividuals, had a large measure of personal contact with Soviet stu
dents.
Although we spent hut 13 days in the Soviet Union itself, I feel
that we were able to gain some insight into the lives of students in
the USSR. One evening in Moscow, for example, our group was
hosted by the Young Communist League of Moscow at an informal
party. After speeches and introductions, we broke up into small dis
cussion groups. Through an English-Russian interpreter, I spoke at
length with a woman who teaches elementary and secondary school
in the Soviet Union. I found that it was quite difficult to discuss
problems of significance objectively with her, since we came from
such widely different backgrounds.
IX OIIR DISCUSSIONS, we would argue from completely dif
ferent premises and assumptions. If we reached some common
ground of understanding, a minute later we would be at opposite
poles. . . . For instance, we talked about national "objectives" of the
United States and the Soviet Union. We both agreed that basic to
our two countries' foreign policy is a belief in "the self-dtermination
of nations." Then, however, my Soviet, "conversational partner"
asked me, "why does the United States try to keep the nations of
Latin America under the imperialist yoke!"
