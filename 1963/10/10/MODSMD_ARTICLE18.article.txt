# Washington State, UCLA, Cal Loom As Big Six Darkhorses

### ALAN CHARLESWORTH 
(This is the last part of a
two-part story covering l Stan
ford's competition in the
AAWU race to the Rose Bowl.)

The departure of end Hugh
Campbell brings to an end an era
at VVSU, an era that saw the Cou
gars live and die by Ihe pass, but
its end promises an increased em
phasis on rushing. This fall, for
example VVSU has run 194 rush
ing plays to only (51 pass plays,
accounting for two-thirds of its
total yardage on the ground, a
marked reversal from past sea
sons.
Replacing departed George Reed
as the primary Cougar ground
threat is junior halfback Clarence
Williams. Williams, a 9.6 speed
ster. managed only 150 yards last,
season. This fall he leads th e
AAWU in rushing with 311 yards
on 49 carries, for a sharp 6.3 aver
age gain.
TO BL SURE, WSU has no t
abandoned passing. Returning
quarterback Dave Mathieson led
the AAWU last fall throwing
with a 53 percent completion rate
good for 1,452 yards, 552 yards
more than his nearest rival.
Though not: being much of a run
ning threat, Mathieson still
topped the Big Six in total off
ense.
Thus far Mathieson is second

behind Cal's Craig Morton in
AAWU pasing, having accounted
for 222 yards through the ait
lanes.
On Ihe receiving end of Cougar
passing this fall, sophomore Den
nis Kloke tops AAWU ends with
eight catches good for H8 yards,
while junior Gerry Shaw, second
leading WSU receiver behind
Campbell last year, is fifth in
AAWU receiving with 66 yards
on seven snags. Shaw was sixth
in the Big Six last fall.
Hl* FRONT on the forward
wall, four of five regulars return
to give WSU improved strength
along the forward wall.
In three games 1 his fall, the
Cougars have shown a defensive
ability lacked by past WSU teams,
holding opponents to an average '
of 126 yards on Ihe ground and
115 in the air.
Since WSU plays only two
league contests, it is not eligible
for the league crown, but could
still be voted into the Rose Bowl.
IN ITS SECOND year w i th
the T-formation, the emphasis at
UCLA this fall is to mold an
improved passing attack into the
Bruin offense. Against Pitt, the
experiment fell flat as UCLA
completed only four of 19 aerials
for a scanty 44 yards. In the fol
lowing Penn State contest how
ever. the Bruins were successful
on 11 of 23 passes for 124 yards.

Last Friday against the Indians,
UCLA compiled 135 yards, wilh
11 of 20 completions.
Senior quarterback Larry Zeno
has assumed Bruin passing
chores. With a 54 percent com
pletion rale, he ranks third in
Ijoth AAWIJ passing and total
offense. End Mo! Profit, who lied
for first in UCLA pass catching
last fall with 12 receptions, has
already snagged seven passes for
110 yards, third best in Ihe
AAWIJ.
On the rushing side of the
fence, however, the graduation of
All-American halfback Kirmit
Alexander seems to have left a
vacuum. Halfback Mike Haffner,
All-AAWU in 1961 as a sopho
more, but out last season with an
injury, and fullback Warren
Jackson, second in Bruin rushing
last fall, were expected to lead
the rushing attack, but both
have averaged less than 28 yards
per game. In fact, UCLA has
averaged only 115 yards per con
test on the ground.
THIO LINK is fairly quick, and
agile, but is not large in size.
Seniors Walt Dathe, and J a h n
Walker, and ju n i or Randy
Schwarty and Kent Francisco are
the only returnees with more
than 150 minutes of varsity ac
tion.
Defensively this fall UCLA
ranks fifth in the Big Six, allow
ing opponents an average of 178
yards rushing and 178 passing,
for a total of 356 yards.
The only bright note so far in
the otherwise bleak picture of a
young Cal team facing an awe
some schedule is the passing of
junior quarterback Craig Morton.
Morton led the Bears in passing
last year with 905 yards and thus
far leads the AAWIJ with 30 com
pletions good for 376 yards.
JACK SCHRAUB tops the Bears
in receiving with seven receptions
good for 88 yards, and is fourth
in the AAWIJ. Loren Hawley has
caught fewer passes, five, but
has gained 99 yards.
Rushing, however, is a differ
ent matter, as the Bears have
managed to gain but 78 yards per
game on the ground.
Inexperience, there are only
four seniors on the first three
teams, has hurt Cal. especially on
defense. The Bears are last in
the Big Six defensively, allowing
opponents an average of 246
yards rushing and 121 yards pass
ing per contest.
The Cal line is heavier than in
past years anct has fair potential,
but needs experience to develop,
as four sophomores and seven
juniors inhabit the top three lines.
