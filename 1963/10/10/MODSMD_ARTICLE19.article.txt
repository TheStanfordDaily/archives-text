# Rice Next Stanford Foe
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Sports Editor 
Saturday night, in Houston, the
Indians got their first tost with
out quarterback Clark Weaver,
and the Rice Owls aren't planning
on making it very easy.
The Owls are seeking a come
back after last year's 2-6-2 record,
and, while they don't figure to be
in the class of the tough South
western Conference, it looks like
24 year veteran coach Jess Neely
has come up with a pretty fair
team as usual.
RICK IS 1-1 on the season,
beating LSU 21-12 and losing to
eighth ranked Penn State last
weekend 28-7. The oddsmakers
figure Stanford to be a 13 point
underdog.
The Indians biggest loss is
Weaver, who was highly valued
both as a quarterback and as a
team leader, but he isn't the In
dians' only casualty. Defensive
expert and punter Jim Shroyer
injured his leg in practice on
Tuesday and is expected to be
unable to play on Saturday. Dick
Ragsdale will handle the team's
punting until Shroyer returns.
Also a pair of guards are gone,
Morris Warren with a knee in
jury that will at least keep him
out of the Rice game, and Frank
Dubofsky, a regular last year,
who turned in his uniform last
week, saying that he had lost in
terest in the sport.
THE OWLS have suffered only
one major injury thus far in the
season, kingsize tackle John
Minis (6-4. 2661 hurt his knee
against Penn State and will be
lost for a couple of weeks.
One of Neely's biggest prob
lems may be to pick his starting
quarterback for the Stanlord
game. Walter Mcßeyolds, a jun

ior. started the season as the
Owls signal caller, but completed
only four passes against Penn
State. Second stringer Benny
ITollingsworth came in and hit
14 of 24 pases, leading the drive
for Rice's only score of the game.

THE OWLS have suffered only
one major injury thus far in the
season, kingsize tackle John
Minis (6-4. 2661 hurt his knee
against Penn State and will be
lost for a couple of weeks.
One of Neely's biggest prob
lems may be to pick his starting
quarterback for the Stanlord
game. Walter Mcßeyolds, a jun

ior. started the season as the
Owls signal caller, but completed
only four passes against Penn
State. Second stringer Benny
ITollingsworth came in and hit
14 of 24 pases, leading the drive
for Rice's only score of the game.
Saturday night, in Houston, the
Indians got their first tost with
out quarterback Clark Weaver,
and the Rice Owls aren't planning
on making it very easy.
The Owls are seeking a come
back after last year's 2-6-2 record,
and, while they don't figure to be
in the class of the tough South
western Conference, it looks like
24 year veteran coach Jess Neely
has come up with a pretty fair
team as usual.
RICK IS 1-1 on the season,
beating LSU 21-12 and losing to
eighth ranked Penn State last
weekend 28-7. The oddsmakers
figure Stanford to be a 13 point
underdog.
The Indians biggest loss is
Weaver, who was highly valued
both as a quarterback and as a
team leader, but he isn't the In
dians' only casualty. Defensive
expert and punter Jim Shroyer
injured his leg in practice on
Tuesday and is expected to be
unable to play on Saturday. Dick
Ragsdale will handle the team's
punting until Shroyer returns.
Also a pair of guards are gone,
Morris Warren with a knee in
jury that will at least keep him
out of the Rice game, and Frank
Dubofsky, a regular last year,
who turned in his uniform last
week, saying that he had lost in
terest in the sport.
