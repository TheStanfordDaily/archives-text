### 
United Press International
PLAQUEMINE, La. Police bombarded Freedom Rock Baptist
Church with eight tear gas grenades yesterday to rout 75 Negro
students who had gathered there to plan racial protest demonstra
t ions.
It was not immediately known if any of the teen-agers were
injured in a mad scramble to escape from the stinging gas. The
administrator of Plaquemine Hospital refused to say if any of the
students were treated for injuries. The students had returned to
Ihe church after being chased from the streets with tear gas during
an attempt to march on the white high school.
Approximately 500 Negro students have boycotted their own
Iverville Negro High School for four days in protest against seg
regation and the dismissal of 35 students last week for demonstrat
ing.
The students have been using the Freedom Rock Baptist Church
as their rallying point. The church was the scene of a near riot
Aug. 31 at the climax of a series of Negro demonstrations led by
the Congress of Racial Equality CORE.
CATHOLICS TO USE VERNACULAR VATICAN CITY — The
Ecumenical Council voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to permit
Roman Catholics to worship God in their mother tongues.
Approved by tremendous majorities at yesterday's council session
were a series of proposals defining conditions under modern lan
guage may be substituted for Latin in celebration of the Mass.
Of eight proposals adopted by the council, two were of particular
significance. They would empower national conferences of bishops
to introduce use of modern languages at their discretion in all parts
of the Mass which call for participation of the congregation and
open the door to eventual use of the vernacular — the everyday
language of the people in a given area — even in the "Canon" of
the Mass.
NHU CLAIMS SOLUTION NEW YORK — Mme. Ngo Dinh Nhu
declared yesterday that the United States has "not found the solution
against subversive war" and could learn from South Viet Nam.
"Just watch us," the controversial sister-in-law of South Viet
Nam President Ngo Dinh Diem told a luncheon meeting of the Over
seas Press Club at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel here.
Replying to written questions submitted by newsmen, she warned
the United States to prepare against subversive warfare and sug
gested the best place to learn would be from South Viet Nam.
"We in Viet Nam are proving that we can win such a war against
the Communists. We have found the solution," Mme. Nhu declared.
She did not elaborate on why she felt the U.S. was unschooled in
subversive warfare.
