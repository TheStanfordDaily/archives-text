BOOM!
Today, foregoing levity, let us turn our keen young minds to
the principal problem facing American colleges today: the
population explosion. Only last week four people exploded in
Cleveland, Ohio—one of them while carrying a plate of soup.
In case you're thinking such a thing couldn't happen anywhere
but in Cleveland, let me tell you about two other cases last
week—a 45-year-old man in Provo, Utah, and a 19-year-old
girl in North field, Minnesota. And, in addition, there was a
near miss in High Point, North Carolina—an eight,-year-old
boy who was saved only by the quick thinking of his cat, Fred, who
pushed the phone off the hook with his muzzle and dialed the
department of weights and measures. (It would, perhaps, have
been more logical for Fred to dial the lire department, but one
can hardly expect a cat to summon a fire engine which is fol
lowed by a Dalmatian, can one?)
But I digress. The population explosion, I say, is upon us.
It is, of course, cause for concern but not for alarm, because 1
feel sure that science will ultimately find an answer. After all,

has not science in recent years brought us such marvels as (lie
n laser, the bevatron, and tin* Marlboro filter? Oh, what a saga
of science was the discovery of the Marlboro filter! Oh, what a
heart-rending epic of trial and error, of dedication and perse
verance! And, in the end, what a triumph it was when the
Marlboro research team, after years of testing and discarding
one filter material after another—iron, nickel, tin, antimony,
obsidian, poundcake—finally emerged, tired but happy, from
their laboratory, carrying in their hands the perfect filter
cigarette! Indeed, what rejoicing there still is whenever we
light up a Marlboro which comes to us in soft pack and flip-
Top Box in all fifty states and Cleveland!
Yes, science will ultimately solve the problems arising from
the population explosion, but meanwhile America's colleges
are in dire straits. Where can we find classrooms and teachers
for today's gigantic influx of students?
Well sir, some Bay the solution is to adopt the trimester sys
tem, This system, already in usr> at many colleges, eliminates
summer vacations, has threr semesters per annum instead of
two, and compresses a four-year-course into three years.
This is, of course, good, but is it good enough? I'"veil under
the trimester system the student has occasional Hays off. More
over, his nights are utterly wasted in sleeping. Is this the kind
of all-out attack that is indicated?
1 say no. I say desperate situations call for desperate reme
dies. 1 say that partial measures will not solve this crisis. I
say we must do no le>s than go to school every single day of
the year. But that is not all. I say we must go to school
hours of every day!
The benefits of such a program are, as you can see, obvious.
First of all, the classroom shortage will disappear because all
the dormitories can l>e converted into classrooms. Second, the
teacher shortage will disap|>ear because all the night watchmen
can l>e put to work teaching solid state physics and Restoration
drama. And finally, overcrowding will disappear because evcry-
Ixidy will quit school.

Yet, one /i.rthrr question: the makers of Marlboro, who
s/)onsor this e.tlumn, would like to know whether you have
tried a Marlboro lately. It's llie filter cigarette with a man's
world of /furor. Settle back and enioi; one sr*on.

Yet, one /i.rthrr question: the makers of Marlboro, who
s/)onsor this e.tlumn, would like to know whether you have
tried a Marlboro lately. It's llie filter cigarette with a man's
world of /furor. Settle back and enioi; one sr*on.


BOOM!
Today, foregoing levity, let us turn our keen young minds to
the principal problem facing American colleges today: the
population explosion. Only last week four people exploded in
Cleveland, Ohio—one of them while carrying a plate of soup.
In case you're thinking such a thing couldn't happen anywhere
but in Cleveland, let me tell you about two other cases last
week—a 45-year-old man in Provo, Utah, and a 19-year-old
girl in North field, Minnesota. And, in addition, there was a
near miss in High Point, North Carolina—an eight,-year-old
boy who was saved only by the quick thinking of his cat, Fred, who
pushed the phone off the hook with his muzzle and dialed the
department of weights and measures. (It would, perhaps, have
been more logical for Fred to dial the lire department, but one
can hardly expect a cat to summon a fire engine which is fol
lowed by a Dalmatian, can one?)
But I digress. The population explosion, I say, is upon us.
It is, of course, cause for concern but not for alarm, because 1
feel sure that science will ultimately find an answer. After all,

has not science in recent years brought us such marvels as (lie
n laser, the bevatron, and tin* Marlboro filter? Oh, what a saga
of science was the discovery of the Marlboro filter! Oh, what a
heart-rending epic of trial and error, of dedication and perse
verance! And, in the end, what a triumph it was when the
Marlboro research team, after years of testing and discarding
one filter material after another—iron, nickel, tin, antimony,
obsidian, poundcake—finally emerged, tired but happy, from
their laboratory, carrying in their hands the perfect filter
cigarette! Indeed, what rejoicing there still is whenever we
light up a Marlboro which comes to us in soft pack and flip-
Top Box in all fifty states and Cleveland!
Yes, science will ultimately solve the problems arising from
the population explosion, but meanwhile America's colleges
are in dire straits. Where can we find classrooms and teachers
for today's gigantic influx of students?
Well sir, some Bay the solution is to adopt the trimester sys
tem, This system, already in usr> at many colleges, eliminates
summer vacations, has threr semesters per annum instead of
two, and compresses a four-year-course into three years.
This is, of course, good, but is it good enough? I'"veil under
the trimester system the student has occasional Hays off. More
over, his nights are utterly wasted in sleeping. Is this the kind
of all-out attack that is indicated?
1 say no. I say desperate situations call for desperate reme
dies. 1 say that partial measures will not solve this crisis. I
say we must do no le>s than go to school every single day of
the year. But that is not all. I say we must go to school
hours of every day!
The benefits of such a program are, as you can see, obvious.
First of all, the classroom shortage will disappear because all
the dormitories can l>e converted into classrooms. Second, the
teacher shortage will disap|>ear because all the night watchmen
can l>e put to work teaching solid state physics and Restoration
drama. And finally, overcrowding will disappear because evcry-
Ixidy will quit school.
