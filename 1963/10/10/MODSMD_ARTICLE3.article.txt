# Schwarz Warns Against Optimism; Communist Threat Still Prevalent
## 
### JOHN BARTZ 
Today, many Americans are complacent and optimistic about the
danger of Communism in the United States said Dr. Fred Schwarz,
describing his views on "Communism and the Continuing Global
Crisis."
Following his speech last night in Cubberley Auditorium, the

Stanford Student Congress post
poned its debate on a resolution
on the right to free travel until
next meeting since a quorum was
not present.
In his speech Schwarz sum
marized Communism's history,
philosophy and objectives. In
1903. when Lenin organized a
group known as the Bolshevists,
there were only 17 members. In
1917, the government was over
thrown by the action of 40.000
supporters, and today, over one
billion people have been co n
quered by Communism. Schwarz
said that this is certainly an
"achievement of very great a n d
alarming magnitude." If any
group or ideology can accomplish
this, "it's claims must be taken
seriously."
TODAY, many Americans are
complacent and optimistic about
that Communism has been seri

the clanger of Communism in the
United States, since Communism
ran have only a very limited ap
peal here. These people also feel
ously weakened by the present
conflict between the Soviet Union
and Communist China. Said Dr.
Schwarz, "I would be the first to
admit that there is a deep con
flict within Communism today."
However, "the conflicts (both
present and past) within Com
munism are manifestations of
unity." In fact, "the record of
Communism is apparently a rec
ord of amazing inconsistency."
Perhaps the greatest and most
obvious example of this in the
history of Communism was th e
Ribbentrop-Molotov, pact of 1939
which united traditional arch
enemies--Nazism and Commu
nism.
However the inconsistencies of
Communism and the present con
flict between the two Communist
camps are not signs of weakness,
nor do they signify any change in
the ultimate Communist objective
of world domination. "The very
changes inherent in Communism
themselves manifest a constancy
in their philosophy and their ob
jectives." Said Dr, Schwarz, "I
hate to point out that the conflict
may not be to our advantage at
all," since "the quarrel is con
cerned with the best way to con
summate the objective of world
domination."
CHANGE is inherent in th e
Communist philosophy of dialec
tics. The form of "dialectic ad
vance is forwards and back
wards," and the basic policy is
one of one step forward, two
steps backward.
Schwarz said that there are
essentially four approaches to
achieving Communist domination
of the United States. The first is
by the democratic process, which
the Communists despise. The sec
ond is by military conquest involv
ing thermonuclear war, and the
"Communists have renounced . . .
war as an instrument of policy."
The last, two methods of con
quering the United States are the
points on which the two Commu
nist camps do not agree. The Chi
nese Communists, following the
traditional Marxist doctrine ad
vocate internal coup. However,
the Russian Communists says that
the Chinese are not being realistic
â€”the U.S. can only be conquered
by "progressive surrender," and
peaceful co-existence, and "th e
formula of peaceful co-existence
is encirclement plus . . . demorali
zation equals surender." The
United States can best be ap
proached by infiltrating Europe
and Latin America. The Ameri
can Communists are necessary
only as "administrative agents of
the surrender process."
In the future, we can expect a
series of tests to see if America
is ready to surrender. We should
always remember that "Commu
nists are Communists," whether
they agree with each other or not.
