The most serious problem await
: ing the new German chancellor
j upon the retirement of Konrad
| Adenauer will be the re-unifica
| tion of Germany, says Kurt Kie
j singer, president of the Upper
| House of the German Parliament.
In a speech yesterday at Tre
sidder Union, Kiesinger warned
| that the task of choosing a man
| to follow in the footsteps of Ade
; nauer will not be an easy one.
; Germany today is facing many
problems, and the new Chancellor
! must be as strong a leader as pos
: sible if Germany is to have a pur-
I poseful role in the world commu
| nity.
Elaborating on reunification,
| Kiesinger said, "The German
people will never be satisfied un
-1 til all of Germany can be united
j again."
Kiesinger admitted, however,
: that no one in Germany had any
S concrete ideas on how this re
j unification could be achieved, and
j said that he could not imagine
; unification coming in the near
I future.
Another problem the new Chan
cellor would have to face, Kie
singer stated, would be that, of
Germany's alilance with the West
j ern powers. He said that Germany
was united in its desire for close
j co-operation with the United
States and commented on the
good impression President Ken
nedy made on the German people
during his trip through Germany.
Kiesinger, who is thought by
some people to be a possible can
didate for Chancellor himself, de
clined to comment on his election
plans.
