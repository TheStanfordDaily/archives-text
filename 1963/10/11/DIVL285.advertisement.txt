FREUD ENVIED THE CHRISTIAN
"How we who have little belief envy those who are convinced of the exist
ence of a Supreme Power. . . . How comprehensive, exhaustive, and final
are the doctrines of the believers compared with the laboured, poor, and patchy
attempts at explanation which are the best we can produce! ( —Sigmund
Freud, Moses and Monotheism, 1939)
Are you dissatisfied with poor, patchy attempts at explanation —admittedly
the best that man can produce? Don't despair. God lias given man the true
picture of the "way things are and what life is all about' in the Bible. As
for God his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is tried; he is a buckler (shield)
to all those that trust in Him . . . (Psalm 18:30). I rejoice at thy word as
one that findeth great spoil . . . (Psalm 119:162). Give me understanding
according to thy word" . . . (Psalm 1 19:169).
Why not give God a chance in your life and see if you get definite results.
Test the Word of God in the laboratory oflife.
Don't let Freud make up your mind for you—it is your life which is at stake.
