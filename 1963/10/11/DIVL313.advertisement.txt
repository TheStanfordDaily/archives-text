■ chandising-wise, we at Eagle have devoted particular attention of late to
the commercial practices of our colleagues in the tunafish, soup and soap lines.
It seems that these three diverse industries have all discovered that by
offering you a free discount coupon good for three cents off the purchase price
of their product, they can lure you down to the neighborhood store. Well,
we have been considering various ways to market (we believe that s the word
they use) our Inishowen Cheviot Brooketowne. The first two adjectives describe
a heavy herringbone oxford designed by our shirting gourmet who describes this
fabric as meaty. Brooketowne is our tapered body button-down with the sloppy
bulge we used to call flare before everyone else did too. So. tunafish on the
mind, we decided to dip into that great fund of American advertising knowhow.
Friends! as soon as you've wr itcn us to learn the name ol your nearest
Eagle dealer (not all Eagle shirts have the I agle label in them, recall), and we
answer you, and you need a shirt, run! don't walk and claim your Eagle I. ( .
