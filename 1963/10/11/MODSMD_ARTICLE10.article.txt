Do Cinque Graphic Arts is ex
hibiting a number of original
lithographs and etchings by ar
tists from Delacroix to Picasso at
the Stanford Art Gallery.
Almost all of the artists rep- 1
resented are known as painters
rather than printmakers. Conse
quently many of the prints have
the lively, direct chareter of draw- ;
ings or pen and ink washes un
like the strictly printerly quality i
that has been the traditional
standard until recently.
Renoir's tiny nude, for example,
is brushed and liquid like a water
color. Picasso's lithograph. "Les
Saltimbanques," of circus per
formers, is rapidly, loosely calli
graphic. probably one of the most
seductive prints in the collection.
With Rouault' colored elching
aquatints, but particularly with
his big. thick black etching-aqua
tint from his "Miserere" series,
the prints approach painting. Al
though lie worked with this med
ium for at least a decade, Rou
ault seems to have bent it to fit
his painterly instincts. The result
is not forced, but just something
other than what we expect in I
etching-aquatints; there is no deli
cacy or intricacy, but rather.'
black, heavy lines, a stark sim- i
plification of light and texture,
worked and reworked into one 1
big anguished image.
Quite the opposite is Dela
croix's, "Juive D'Alger." which
has all tli unrestricted pattern '
and textural richnes orginally de
manded or etchings. Other prints j
include those by I'issaro, Corot. j
IVrain and Toulouse Laulree.
