# Schriver Attributes Success Of Corps to 'Catching' Idea
## 
### MARTY MASKALL 
The tremendous success of the
Peace Corps can be attributed to
the idea which it represents, de
clared Robert Sargent Schriver,
Jr., in an address in Memorial
Auditorium yesterday afternoon.
Schriver, who has been director of
the Peace Corps since its begin
ning in 1961, spoke in conjunction
with the Institute of International
Relations Peace Corps Week.
"The Peace Corps represents an
idea which has revolutionary po
tential, that of a free democratic
society. That idea is catching,"
said Schriver. He stated that one
of the great accomplishments of
the Peace Corps has been to prove
that "individual men and women
can reshape the world. Everything
is possible with sufficient energy,
intelligence, and courage."
SCHRIVER CITEI) many exam
ples of the accomplishments of
the individual members of the
Peace Corps. In the Peace oCrps,
he said, "we have done what we
said we would do—send people
overseas to exist with locals as
locals, not as Americans." Despite
initial predictions that the project
would fail, these people have sur
vived well under these circum
stances. It has been said of the
Peace Corps that it is more effec
tive than economic or military
aid. and that "it is the most power
ful political force for change in
Latin America which the United
States has going for it today."
Another factor to w hi c h
Schriver attributed the success of
the Peace Corps is the quality of
the volunteers. "The competence
which these men and women dem
onstrate speaks well for the Amer
ican university students of today."
The Peace Corps now has 6,000
volunteers in 47 countries through

out the world. An additional 1,100
volunteers are in training in the
United States, and by the end of
this year, the number of volun
teers abroad is expected to be
7,000. A year from now, 12,000
volunteers are anticipated. "This
number," Schriver pointed out,
"will be determined more by the
number of qualified volunteers
than by any other factor. The
demand by foreign countries is
almost incredible."
AS AN EXAMPLE of a partic
ularly outstanding member,
Schriver told of a Yale graduate
who was sent to Thailand as a
teacher. Despite the belief of
the Thailanders that Americans
can't learn the Thai language be
cause of the difficulties of its ton
ality, this volunteer was teaching
physics in the native language
only eight months after he ar
rived in Thailand. On the 1 side he
captivated the natives by engag
ing in boxing, Thailand-style,
which has considerably fewer re
strictions than Uniled States box
ing. He is one of the few Amer
icans who can boast of having re
ceived a draw in a boxing match
with a native Thailander, Schriver
said.
Schriver spoke of the remark
able popularity of the Peace
Corps. "In many places, especially
in Asia and South America, he
said, the cries of 'Yankee go
home' have been replaced by 'Send
us more Peace Corps volun
teers.' " The volunteers them
selves often speak of the experi
ence as the most meaningful of
their lives. Often they find jobs
in these countries, planning to re
main for a much longer time than
the original two years. Other vol
unteers are hired by the State De
partment, and many return to
U.S. universities after they leave
the Peace Corps.
The success of the Peace Corps
lias caused 12 other nations to
plan similar groups. Denmark is
currently initiating an African
project in Tanganyika. Schriver
said that "the Peace Corps is the
most copied organization today."
PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS
must be at least 18 years of age,
but there is no upper age limit.
Schriver remarked that there are
350 volunteers who are over 50,
and he spoke of a few instances
of volunteers in their 70's. The
Peace Corps includes over 100
married couples. Two-thirds of
the volunteers are men.
The usual stay in a foreign
country is two years, but some
times this length of time may be
extended an additional year if the
applicant and the country wish.
In other cases, a volunteer may
re-enlist for two years in another
country.

stances. It has been said of the
Peace Corps that it is more effec
tive than economic or military
aid. and that "it is the most power
ful political force for change in
Latin America which the United
States has going for it today."
Another factor to w hi c h
Schriver attributed the success of
the Peace Corps is the quality of
the volunteers. "The competence
which these men and women dem
onstrate speaks well for the Amer
ican university students of today."
The Peace Corps now has 6,000
volunteers in 47 countries through

out the world. An additional 1,100
volunteers are in training in the
United States, and by the end of
this year, the number of volun
teers abroad is expected to be
7,000. A year from now, 12,000
volunteers are anticipated. "This
number," Schriver pointed out,
"will be determined more by the
number of qualified volunteers
than by any other factor. The
demand by foreign countries is
almost incredible."
AS AN EXAMPLE of a partic
ularly outstanding member,
Schriver told of a Yale graduate
who was sent to Thailand as a
teacher. Despite the belief of
the Thailanders that Americans
can't learn the Thai language be
cause of the difficulties of its ton
ality, this volunteer was teaching
physics in the native language
only eight months after he ar
rived in Thailand. On the 1 side he
captivated the natives by engag
ing in boxing, Thailand-style,
which has considerably fewer re
strictions than Uniled States box
ing. He is one of the few Amer
icans who can boast of having re
ceived a draw in a boxing match
with a native Thailander, Schriver
said.
Schriver spoke of the remark
able popularity of the Peace
Corps. "In many places, especially
in Asia and South America, he
said, the cries of 'Yankee go
home' have been replaced by 'Send
us more Peace Corps volun
teers.' " The volunteers them
selves often speak of the experi
ence as the most meaningful of
their lives. Often they find jobs
in these countries, planning to re
main for a much longer time than
the original two years. Other vol
unteers are hired by the State De
partment, and many return to
U.S. universities after they leave
the Peace Corps.
The success of the Peace Corps
lias caused 12 other nations to
plan similar groups. Denmark is
currently initiating an African
project in Tanganyika. Schriver
said that "the Peace Corps is the
most copied organization today."
PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS
must be at least 18 years of age,
but there is no upper age limit.
Schriver remarked that there are
350 volunteers who are over 50,
and he spoke of a few instances
of volunteers in their 70's. The
Peace Corps includes over 100
married couples. Two-thirds of
the volunteers are men.
The usual stay in a foreign
country is two years, but some
times this length of time may be
extended an additional year if the
applicant and the country wish.
In other cases, a volunteer may
re-enlist for two years in another
country.

who was sent to Thailand as a
teacher. Despite the belief of
the Thailanders that Americans
can't learn the Thai language be
cause of the difficulties of its ton
ality, this volunteer was teaching
physics in the native language
only eight months after he ar
rived in Thailand. On the 1 side he
captivated the natives by engag
ing in boxing, Thailand-style,
which has considerably fewer re
strictions than Uniled States box
ing. He is one of the few Amer
icans who can boast of having re
ceived a draw in a boxing match
with a native Thailander, Schriver
said.
Schriver spoke of the remark
able popularity of the Peace
Corps. "In many places, especially
in Asia and South America, he
said, the cries of 'Yankee go
home' have been replaced by 'Send
us more Peace Corps volun
teers.' " The volunteers them
selves often speak of the experi
ence as the most meaningful of
their lives. Often they find jobs
in these countries, planning to re
main for a much longer time than
the original two years. Other vol
unteers are hired by the State De
partment, and many return to
U.S. universities after they leave
the Peace Corps.
The success of the Peace Corps
lias caused 12 other nations to
plan similar groups. Denmark is
currently initiating an African
project in Tanganyika. Schriver
said that "the Peace Corps is the
most copied organization today."
PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS
must be at least 18 years of age,
but there is no upper age limit.
Schriver remarked that there are
350 volunteers who are over 50,
and he spoke of a few instances
of volunteers in their 70's. The
Peace Corps includes over 100
married couples. Two-thirds of
the volunteers are men.
The usual stay in a foreign
country is two years, but some
times this length of time may be
extended an additional year if the
applicant and the country wish.
In other cases, a volunteer may
re-enlist for two years in another
country.

The tremendous success of the
Peace Corps can be attributed to
the idea which it represents, de
clared Robert Sargent Schriver,
Jr., in an address in Memorial
Auditorium yesterday afternoon.
Schriver, who has been director of
the Peace Corps since its begin
ning in 1961, spoke in conjunction
with the Institute of International
Relations Peace Corps Week.
"The Peace Corps represents an
idea which has revolutionary po
tential, that of a free democratic
society. That idea is catching,"
said Schriver. He stated that one
of the great accomplishments of
the Peace Corps has been to prove
that "individual men and women
can reshape the world. Everything
is possible with sufficient energy,
intelligence, and courage."
SCHRIVER CITEI) many exam
ples of the accomplishments of
the individual members of the
Peace Corps. In the Peace oCrps,
he said, "we have done what we
said we would do—send people
overseas to exist with locals as
locals, not as Americans." Despite
initial predictions that the project
would fail, these people have sur
vived well under these circum
stances. It has been said of the
Peace Corps that it is more effec
tive than economic or military
aid. and that "it is the most power
ful political force for change in
Latin America which the United
States has going for it today."
Another factor to w hi c h
Schriver attributed the success of
the Peace Corps is the quality of
the volunteers. "The competence
which these men and women dem
onstrate speaks well for the Amer
ican university students of today."
The Peace Corps now has 6,000
volunteers in 47 countries through

out the world. An additional 1,100
volunteers are in training in the
United States, and by the end of
this year, the number of volun
teers abroad is expected to be
7,000. A year from now, 12,000
volunteers are anticipated. "This
number," Schriver pointed out,
"will be determined more by the
number of qualified volunteers
than by any other factor. The
demand by foreign countries is
almost incredible."
AS AN EXAMPLE of a partic
ularly outstanding member,
