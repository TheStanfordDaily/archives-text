PETER, PAUL, MARY
Editor, The Daily:
May I give my thanks to some
one's planning to have the Peter,
Paul and Mary folk concert in
the Basketball Pavilion, and for
the reasonable price of $4.00 a
ticket for those who wish to go
and special $5.00 tickets for those
who wish to sit close and hear.
No need to tell us of the struc
tural capacity of the Pavilion;
most ol us are aware of the fine
tonal and acoustical qualities
that structure affords us in
speeches, registration crowds, and
basketball games.

FUNDAM ENTAL STANDARD
Editor, The Daily:
"We at Stanford are a close
community of faculty and stu
dents. All of us are engaged in
the process of university educa
tion, and all of us share a com
mon university life. Like any
group of individuals working to
gether toward certain goals, we
recognize the need for regula
tions which facilitate the attain
ment of those objectives." So be
gins the booklet on the Funda
mental Standard. My letter of
last week showed that the concept
of our regulated "common uni
versity life" had been expanded,
under the name of the Funda
mental Standard, to include the
most personal and intimate of be
havior. This letter is to discuss
the vague rationale of the Funda
mental Standard.
"In effect, it is the assumption
by the University that the stu
dents will conduct themselves as
ladies and gentlemen." (Funstan
Booklet ! So what are "ladies and
gentlemen?" And what do they
do? Ladies and gentlemen are
people of which the bourgeoisie
approves and is not afraid. But
what do ladies and gentlemen do?
They don't do anything; rather
they don't do, or don't admit do
ing, any act violating convention
al, off-campus morality. The Ad
ministration's purpose in sanc
tioning and enforcing Funstan is
to placate the exponents of off
campus morality. Just consider
the statement that by obeying
the Fundamental Standard "...
the student preserves and pro
tects his own reputation, as well
as that of the student body and
the University." (Funstan Book
let) The kind of reputation that
you preserve and protect, instead
of deserve and build, is a very
old and rotten one—one of much
more value to the Administration
than to you. It is obvious that
Funstan does not reflect student
wishes, for the Administration
exercises veto power over any
student revision of the Standard;
neither does Funstan serve the
students' interests, for it serves
the contrary interests of the Ad
ministration.
The deliberate confusion over
Funstan depends upon the am
biguity of the word "Standards."
Ultimately, it is the confusion of
descriptive and proscriptive law
•—i.e., of what is and what is
supposed to be. This confusion
is greatest in the area of Social
Regulations, whose perpetrators
defend even the Double Standard.
Confusion comes easily for them,
as in this statement from last
year's Social Regulations Book-

Jot: "Individual decisions musl be
accompanied by careful consider
ation of the standards maintained
by the group." The use of th e
word "standards" presents a par
ticularly subtle twist. By some
happy coincidence, "standards"
suggests not only the Funda
mental Standard and the social
norm, but also a girl's own sex
ual taboos. Any girl knows the
everyday moral use of "stand
ards." It is assumed that because
of the simple pun, we may equate
personal sexual mores with group
behavior with university regula
tions.
This confusion carries over into
the field of "responsibility." The
Funstan Booklet claims that you
have "freedom of behavior" and
"individual responsibility." But
you don't have freedom of be
havior, as I showed last week. I
submit that the Administration
curtails every activity of moral
import, with the single exception
of smoking outside of class. Con
sider the remarkable statement:
"The privilege of making inde
pendent decisions involves the
acceptance of a penalty should
such choices violate the spirit of
the regulations." (Social Regula
tions Booklet) Strangely enough,
the absence of the right to make
individual decisions—as in a pri
son — also involves the accept
ance of a penally should your be
havior violate the regulations.
You all have the right to do it
the Dean's way — the right to
agree. And if you don't decide to
do it that way—and here's where
"individual responsibility" comes
in—you are subject to discipli
nary action.
This brings me to my last point.
I've said that the concept of the
Fundamental Standard rests upon
the confusion of the norm and the
ideal. But the norm is the norm
because the Administration and
its supporters wanted it to be the
norm. But they did not want it
to be the norm because it was
the ideal. They made it the norm
because it used to be the norm,
because it was easiest and most
lucrative. It is another of the un
counted blessings of Mrs. Stan
ford and the Nineteenth Century.

descriptive and proscriptive law
•—i.e., of what is and what is
supposed to be. This confusion
is greatest in the area of Social
Regulations, whose perpetrators
defend even the Double Standard.
Confusion comes easily for them,
as in this statement from last
year's Social Regulations Book-

Jot: "Individual decisions musl be
accompanied by careful consider
ation of the standards maintained
by the group." The use of th e
word "standards" presents a par
ticularly subtle twist. By some
happy coincidence, "standards"
suggests not only the Funda
mental Standard and the social
norm, but also a girl's own sex
ual taboos. Any girl knows the
everyday moral use of "stand
ards." It is assumed that because
of the simple pun, we may equate
personal sexual mores with group
behavior with university regula
tions.
This confusion carries over into
the field of "responsibility." The
Funstan Booklet claims that you
have "freedom of behavior" and
"individual responsibility." But
you don't have freedom of be
havior, as I showed last week. I
submit that the Administration
curtails every activity of moral
import, with the single exception
of smoking outside of class. Con
sider the remarkable statement:
"The privilege of making inde
pendent decisions involves the
acceptance of a penalty should
such choices violate the spirit of
the regulations." (Social Regula
tions Booklet) Strangely enough,
the absence of the right to make
individual decisions—as in a pri
son — also involves the accept
ance of a penally should your be
havior violate the regulations.
You all have the right to do it
the Dean's way — the right to
agree. And if you don't decide to
do it that way—and here's where
"individual responsibility" comes
in—you are subject to discipli
nary action.
This brings me to my last point.
I've said that the concept of the
Fundamental Standard rests upon
the confusion of the norm and the
ideal. But the norm is the norm
because the Administration and
its supporters wanted it to be the
norm. But they did not want it
to be the norm because it was
the ideal. They made it the norm
because it used to be the norm,
because it was easiest and most
lucrative. It is another of the un
counted blessings of Mrs. Stan
ford and the Nineteenth Century.

FUNDAM ENTAL STANDARD
Editor, The Daily:
"We at Stanford are a close
community of faculty and stu
dents. All of us are engaged in
the process of university educa
tion, and all of us share a com
mon university life. Like any
group of individuals working to
gether toward certain goals, we
recognize the need for regula
tions which facilitate the attain
ment of those objectives." So be
gins the booklet on the Funda
mental Standard. My letter of
last week showed that the concept
of our regulated "common uni
versity life" had been expanded,
under the name of the Funda
mental Standard, to include the
most personal and intimate of be
havior. This letter is to discuss
the vague rationale of the Funda

"In effect, it is the assumption

people of which the bourgeoisie

They don't do anything; rather
they don't do, or don't admit do
ing, any act violating convention
al, off-campus morality. The Ad
ministration's purpose in sanc

to placate the exponents of off
campus morality. Just consider
the statement that by obeying
the Fundamental Standard "...
the student preserves and pro

as that of the student body and
the University." (Funstan Book

you preserve and protect, instead
of deserve and build, is a very
old and rotten one—one of much
more value to the Administration
than to you. It is obvious that
Funstan does not reflect student
wishes, for the Administration
exercises veto power over any
student revision of the Standard;
neither does Funstan serve the
students' interests, for it serves
the contrary interests of the Ad

FUNDAM ENTAL STANDARD
Editor, The Daily:
"We at Stanford are a close
community of faculty and stu
dents. All of us are engaged in
the process of university educa
tion, and all of us share a com
mon university life. Like any
group of individuals working to
gether toward certain goals, we
recognize the need for regula
tions which facilitate the attain
ment of those objectives." So be
gins the booklet on the Funda
mental Standard. My letter of
last week showed that the concept
of our regulated "common uni
versity life" had been expanded,
under the name of the Funda
mental Standard, to include the
most personal and intimate of be
havior. This letter is to discuss
the vague rationale of the Funda
mental Standard.
"In effect, it is the assumption
by the University that the stu
dents will conduct themselves as
ladies and gentlemen." (Funstan
Booklet ! So what are "ladies and
gentlemen?" And what do they
do? Ladies and gentlemen are
people of which the bourgeoisie
approves and is not afraid. But
what do ladies and gentlemen do?
They don't do anything; rather
they don't do, or don't admit do
ing, any act violating convention
al, off-campus morality. The Ad
ministration's purpose in sanc
tioning and enforcing Funstan is
to placate the exponents of off
campus morality. Just consider
the statement that by obeying
the Fundamental Standard "...
the student preserves and pro
tects his own reputation, as well
as that of the student body and
the University." (Funstan Book
let) The kind of reputation that
you preserve and protect, instead
of deserve and build, is a very
old and rotten one—one of much
more value to the Administration
than to you. It is obvious that
Funstan does not reflect student
wishes, for the Administration
exercises veto power over any
student revision of the Standard;
neither does Funstan serve the
students' interests, for it serves
the contrary interests of the Ad
ministration.
The deliberate confusion over
Funstan depends upon the am
biguity of the word "Standards."
Ultimately, it is the confusion of
descriptive and proscriptive law
•—i.e., of what is and what is
supposed to be. This confusion
is greatest in the area of Social
Regulations, whose perpetrators
defend even the Double Standard.
Confusion comes easily for them,
as in this statement from last
year's Social Regulations Book-

Jot: "Individual decisions musl be
accompanied by careful consider
ation of the standards maintained
by the group." The use of th e
word "standards" presents a par
ticularly subtle twist. By some
happy coincidence, "standards"
suggests not only the Funda
mental Standard and the social
norm, but also a girl's own sex
ual taboos. Any girl knows the
everyday moral use of "stand
ards." It is assumed that because
of the simple pun, we may equate
personal sexual mores with group
behavior with university regula
tions.
This confusion carries over into
the field of "responsibility." The
Funstan Booklet claims that you
have "freedom of behavior" and
"individual responsibility." But
you don't have freedom of be
havior, as I showed last week. I
submit that the Administration
curtails every activity of moral
import, with the single exception
of smoking outside of class. Con
sider the remarkable statement:
"The privilege of making inde
pendent decisions involves the
acceptance of a penalty should
such choices violate the spirit of
the regulations." (Social Regula
tions Booklet) Strangely enough,
the absence of the right to make
individual decisions—as in a pri
son — also involves the accept
ance of a penally should your be
havior violate the regulations.
You all have the right to do it
the Dean's way — the right to
agree. And if you don't decide to
do it that way—and here's where
"individual responsibility" comes
in—you are subject to discipli
nary action.
This brings me to my last point.
I've said that the concept of the
Fundamental Standard rests upon
the confusion of the norm and the
ideal. But the norm is the norm
because the Administration and
its supporters wanted it to be the
norm. But they did not want it
to be the norm because it was
the ideal. They made it the norm
because it used to be the norm,
because it was easiest and most
lucrative. It is another of the un
counted blessings of Mrs. Stan
ford and the Nineteenth Century.

exercises veto power over any
student revision of the Standard;
neither does Funstan serve the
students' interests, for it serves
the contrary interests of the Ad
ministration.
The deliberate confusion over
Funstan depends upon the am
biguity of the word "Standards."
Ultimately, it is the confusion of
descriptive and proscriptive law
•—i.e., of what is and what is
supposed to be. This confusion
is greatest in the area of Social
Regulations, whose perpetrators
defend even the Double Standard.
Confusion comes easily for them,
as in this statement from last
year's Social Regulations Book-

Jot: "Individual decisions musl be
accompanied by careful consider
ation of the standards maintained
by the group." The use of th e
word "standards" presents a par
ticularly subtle twist. By some
happy coincidence, "standards"
suggests not only the Funda
mental Standard and the social
norm, but also a girl's own sex
ual taboos. Any girl knows the
everyday moral use of "stand
ards." It is assumed that because
of the simple pun, we may equate
personal sexual mores with group
behavior with university regula
tions.
This confusion carries over into
the field of "responsibility." The
Funstan Booklet claims that you
have "freedom of behavior" and
"individual responsibility." But
you don't have freedom of be
havior, as I showed last week. I
submit that the Administration
curtails every activity of moral
import, with the single exception
of smoking outside of class. Con
sider the remarkable statement:
"The privilege of making inde
pendent decisions involves the
acceptance of a penalty should
such choices violate the spirit of
the regulations." (Social Regula
tions Booklet) Strangely enough,
the absence of the right to make
individual decisions—as in a pri
son — also involves the accept
ance of a penally should your be
havior violate the regulations.
You all have the right to do it
the Dean's way — the right to
agree. And if you don't decide to
do it that way—and here's where
"individual responsibility" comes
in—you are subject to discipli
nary action.
This brings me to my last point.
I've said that the concept of the
Fundamental Standard rests upon
the confusion of the norm and the
ideal. But the norm is the norm
because the Administration and
its supporters wanted it to be the
norm. But they did not want it
to be the norm because it was
the ideal. They made it the norm
because it used to be the norm,
because it was easiest and most
lucrative. It is another of the un
counted blessings of Mrs. Stan
ford and the Nineteenth Century.

FOOTBALL YELLS
Editor, The Daily:
We feel that the yells at the
Stanford football games have
been consistently both crude and
uninspiring. Surely the purpose
of the yells should be to encour
age the team and to add to rather
than detract from the enjoyment
of the sport.
