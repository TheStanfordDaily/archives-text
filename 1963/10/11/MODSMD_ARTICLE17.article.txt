# NSA Education Travel Institute Offers Aid
## 
### 
Students planning to travel in
Europe during the present year
or next summer would probably
find a brief visit to the NSA Edu
cational Travel Institute (ETF)
desk at the lIR loft in Tresidder
of benefit in obtaining inexpen
sive housing, restaurants, a n d
transportation in Europe.
ETI WAS established in 1948
to act as the travel department
for NSA as an information and
advisory service for American
students planning to travel. By
cooperating with the travel de
partments of the student unions
of other countries, ETI has been
able to offer educational and cul
tural programs as well as contact
with foreign students.
Since 1948 ETI expanded its
programs to include numerous
services in addition to general
tours. Study tours have been
established, but in addition ETI
offers many travel aids to the
student such as the booklet,
"Work, Study, Travel Abroad."
This publication includes general

information about visas and pass
ports, work opportunities and
work camps, scholarships and fel
lowships and fellowships, festi
vals, and the services of the Euro
pean students' unions, plus other
information of general interest.
ETI IS also the issuer of the
International Student Identity
Card in the United States. This
is an internationally accepted
means of student identification
which entitles the student to dis
count at cultural activities, stu
dent hostels, restaurants, and
transportation. These facilities
are listed in the "Handbook for
Student Travel" and in the "Tra
velling Student." The Overseas
Campus Office requires these
ID's for its students going to the
European Campuses.
These booklets, cards, and
other information are available
at the NSA-ETI desk in the lIR
loft at Tresidder on Tuesday or
Thursday afternoons or by writ
ing to NSA-ETI, Box 2222, Stan
ford, California.
