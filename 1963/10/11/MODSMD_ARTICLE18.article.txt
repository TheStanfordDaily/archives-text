# Stanford-in-Washington
## Interns Tackle Varied Tasks 
### LINDA HESS 
The Stanford students who held
political internships in Washing
ton this summer did nearly every
kind of work available on Capitol
Hill, excepting the kind of politi
cal maneuvering reserved for
lobbyists and strategists.
They did research and analyzed
legislative issues for their em
ployers.
They compiled information and
prepared speeches, committee
testimony, press releases, and
statements for the Congressional
Record.
They answered constituent cor
respondence, which required them
to be in touch with all branches
of government.
And they engaged in a variety
of unofficial activities too num
erous to mention, such as plan
ning birthday parties for Con
gressmen, cococting questions de
signed to put teamster President
James Hoffa on the spot (a feat
at which no one was successful),
and wangling invitations to Em
bassy parties.
Tac Craven, a 1963 graduate
who has just entered the Law
School, was placed on the staff of
the Senate Commerce Committee.
Warren Magnuson, Senator from
Tac's home state of Washington,
is the chairman of that commit
tee, and Tac spent the summer
attending the civil rights hear
ings and preparing the final tran
scripts of the Public Accommoda
tions bill testimony.
Lee Carlson, a third-year law
student, did legal research for
the Senate Committee on Interior
and Insular Affairs.
Bob Burke, a senior in political
science, was assigned by Con
gresswoman Edith Green of Ore
gon to do a complete coverage of
the civil rights legislation for his
office. This included attending
the hearings of the three major

committees handling civil rights
—House and Senate Judiciary and
Senate Commerce and keeping a
full documentation of each com
mittee's proceedings.
Both political parties kept busy ,
seeing that the neophyte politi
cians on the Hill were exposed to
the proper kinds of influences.
Speeches and question-and-an
swer sessions were arranged with
James Hoffa, Barry Goldwater
(no guilt by association intended),
and Sens. Jacob Javits, John
Tower, Thomas Kuchel, and Joe
Clark, to name a few.
The Stanford group enjoyed a
series of programs of a very high
caliber arranged for the group
by individual members on their
own initiative. These included
meetings with Ambassadors, in
terviews with Supreme Court
Justices, question-and-answer ses
sions with Congressmen and Sen
ators, and a visit to the Pentagon
with a briefing by Deputy As
sistant Secretary of Defense Wil
liam Gorham.
Gorham was one of the Stan
ford alumni in Washington whose
cooperation with the Stanford
group provided some very special!
opportunities. Another was Brig. |
Gen. Don Flickinger, special con
sultant for the National Aeronau
tics and Space Administration,
who, out of love for the alma
mater, arranged a panel discus
sion on NASA followed by a din
ner party.
These were the kinds of activi
ties and opportunities enjoyed by
the first participants in the Stan
lord-i n-Washington pr o g r a m.
Several came back with a new
taste for a career in politics. But '
whether or not they decide to .
run for office or enter public |
life, all agreed that the experi-!
enee had inspired a new aware
ness and sense of responsibility
and involvement in the affairs of
government.
