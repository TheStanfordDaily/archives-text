# Mike Moore Utilizes Brush, Pen, Charcoal in Art Exhibit
## 
### LINDA FREIDEL Art Editor 
Mike Moore, a Stanford art stu
dent, is exhibiting paintings,
small pen and ink drawings, and
a series of large charcoal draw
ings at St. Michael's Alley. The
paintings are abstracted land
scapes, growing from Moore's
linear, rectangularly organized
pen and ink drawings of house,
field, and trees. Of the paintings,
the large red, orange, and blue
"seascape," hung like a banner,
is the most enjoyable.
What deserves special atten
tion, however, is the series of
charcoal drawings based on old
family photographs of Edwardian
childhood. The children's faces
prefigure their adult faces, while
their bodies remain weak, child
like, and limited by parental dis
cipline. They are, therefore, al
ternately children and dwarfs, de
pending upon interpretation.
IN ORDER TO CREATE a sin
ister personality for his children,
Moore borrows and exaggerates
certain photographic effects, such
as black massed shadows and sil
hovcttes, glaring, ominous sun
light, and the sudden softness of
flesh next to the starkness of
this sharp black and white. In
one of the drawings a boy stand
ing in a street is blinded by the
light, reflected from his white
smile of unarticulatcd, touched
up teeth. lie looks the way people
look to those who have just gone
outside in the early morning after
staying up all night.
In another drawing a little girl
hugs her Irish Setter lovingly
and stares out at us with menac
ing directness, her face strong
and heavy. Her black stockinged
legs merge with the dark setter
so that the beast has six legs.

THIS LAST DRAWING is an
exception to the series in one de
tail. In general the faces of the
dwarfs or children have that curi
ously dead feeling peculiar to
photography. Their faces are
erased by the light. Consequently
their minds seem turned in on
themselves, but though they do
not seem to see us, they control
us.
The little boy stationed between
two ugly leering middle-aged
women, mother (with baby) and
aunt, is sullen, and his face is
obscure. He has been forced to
stand still and be nice, but he
knows that his superiority puts
him beyond their dominance.
Altogether, these evil grownup
children provoke the suspicion
that they know too much. They
are children in disguise. Moore's
drawings convince us that chil
dren are dangerous and should be
carefully watched.

Mike Moore, a Stanford art stu
dent, is exhibiting paintings,
small pen and ink drawings, and
a series of large charcoal draw
ings at St. Michael's Alley. The
paintings are abstracted land
scapes, growing from Moore's
linear, rectangularly organized
pen and ink drawings of house,
field, and trees. Of the paintings,
the large red, orange, and blue
"seascape," hung like a banner,
is the most enjoyable.
What deserves special atten
tion, however, is the series of
charcoal drawings based on old
family photographs of Edwardian
childhood. The children's faces
prefigure their adult faces, while
their bodies remain weak, child
like, and limited by parental dis
cipline. They are, therefore, al
ternately children and dwarfs, de
pending upon interpretation.
IN ORDER TO CREATE a sin
ister personality for his children,
Moore borrows and exaggerates
certain photographic effects, such
as black massed shadows and sil
hovcttes, glaring, ominous sun
light, and the sudden softness of
flesh next to the starkness of
this sharp black and white. In
one of the drawings a boy stand
ing in a street is blinded by the
light, reflected from his white
smile of unarticulatcd, touched
up teeth. lie looks the way people
look to those who have just gone
outside in the early morning after
staying up all night.
In another drawing a little girl
hugs her Irish Setter lovingly
and stares out at us with menac
ing directness, her face strong
and heavy. Her black stockinged
legs merge with the dark setter
so that the beast has six legs.

THIS LAST DRAWING is an
exception to the series in one de
tail. In general the faces of the
dwarfs or children have that curi
ously dead feeling peculiar to
photography. Their faces are
erased by the light. Consequently
their minds seem turned in on
themselves, but though they do
not seem to see us, they control
us.
The little boy stationed between
two ugly leering middle-aged
women, mother (with baby) and
aunt, is sullen, and his face is
obscure. He has been forced to
stand still and be nice, but he
knows that his superiority puts
him beyond their dominance.
Altogether, these evil grownup
children provoke the suspicion
that they know too much. They
are children in disguise. Moore's
drawings convince us that chil
dren are dangerous and should be
carefully watched.
