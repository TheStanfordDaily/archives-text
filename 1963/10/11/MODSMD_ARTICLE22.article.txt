# Dean Relates Art Forms to Environment
## 
### FRED WARNICK 
In two highly thought-provok
ing lectures, a noted architeetura
scholar provided his summei
quarter audiences with sugges
tions for speculation on architec
i tural styles, and on environment
and the art form.
Henry Elder — Dean of the
School of Architecture at the Uni
versity of British Columbia in
Vancouver charged his deliveries
with much interest. He was mark-
I edly moved by his return to Stan
ford, in visits with colleagues,
students, and friends whose re
spect and admiration he had won
I while instructing here in 1961,
In his first lecture on the anal
! y.sis of architectural styles of var
; ious cultures, Mr. Elder theorized
that any given style experiences
its conception, birth, growth,
flowering, maturing, decay, and
death.
HE HYPOTHESIZED that just
as one architectural style grows
J to its heighth—its flowering—the
conception of the subsequent style
occurs. And as the old style whith
ers and dies, the new style is born,
and glows to its flowering stage.
The current modern trend
flowered in the 1930's and is now
refining itself in the elegance of
maturity. The birth pangs of a
new style were felt in the early
20th century—with the concept of
e ~ me-.
The architectural style of a cul
ture often relates to that culture's
interpretation of the universe, Mr.
Elder noted. Since Einstein's
time, there has developed the no
tion in astronomy that the uni
verse is expanding and infinite,
but bounded. A new style in ar
chitecture is afoot, which invari
ably develops to be "infinte and
expanding, but bounded." The
current modern style reflects an
understanding of an infinite and
unbounded universe—and should
nol last much past the 20th cen
tury. It is endless, in a sense, in
that it is possible to add and add
unit elements, or modules.
Alternating styles have a few
essential similar characteristics.
The Greek, Gothic, and Modern
are featured by a modular con
cept—you can add or take away
the unit elements. Roman and
Renaissance are completed, or or
ganic, and one cannot add or take
away parts of buildings in these
styles. Barouque, Rococe, and
Victorian are considered as out
growths of the Renaissance space
concept, in this frame of refer
ence.
Though Frank Lloyd Wright
occasionally worked with the mod
ule, he was the last glorious em
ber of the Renaissance concept—
as his buildings were usually or
ganic and complete, not modular.
In this sense, then, Wright was
not "modern" at all. (Indeed, Mr.
Wright began practice in the

i 1880's). That Wright is the "father
of modern architecture" is more
a convenient cliche of tlie "sellers"
of architecture, than it is a tru
; ism, in this context.
THE BAUIIAUS SCHOOL
founded by Walter Gropius, and
| the buildings of Mies van der
; Rohe are more typical of the
modern style featuring the mod
\ ule. Evidence of a new non-mod
ular style that will succeed the
current modern notion of architec
ture in Ronchamps Cathedral,
France, by Le Corbusier, sug
gested by Elder.
"The nature of architectural
styles is that they seem to last
for several generations. Thus, the
'new' style—though growing—
will not flower for some time, and
by then 'modern' architecture will
be in its death throes."
MR. ELDUR TRACED this pat
tern of simultaneous flowering
and death of adjacent architec
tural styles to the Western cul
tures: Modern flowered as Ren
aissance died& Renaissance flow
ered as Gothic died; Medieval
Christian flowered as Roman i
died; and Roman flowered as
Greek died.
Mr. Elder raised some curiosity 1
the next day, when he applied i
art theory to the idea that man
shapes his environment. To be
gin, Mr. Elder recalled that envi
ronment is defined in physiology
as a series of "unorganized" con
ditions outside an organism. The
organism uses "energy" to "or- j
ganize" his environment. Physiol- j
ogically, such use of energy is I
called the condition of the "steady
state," a characteristic of all 'liv
ing' matter.
THREE REQUIREMENTS are
necessary to sustain the "steady
state" of the organism: 1) acqui
sition of food, 2) reproduction of
the specie, and 3> formation of
groups.
The first two requirements are
self-explanatory; it is with the
latter stipulation—the formation
of groups—that Mr. Elder sug
gested his analogy.
For it is the formation of a
group that provides the medium
in which the human can commu
nicate and express ideas. The com
municated ideas significant to this
discussion are those known as
works of art architecture being
one of many examples.
THOUGH ARTISTIC express
sion and creation are by an in
dividual, the group is necessary
to complete the cycle of artistic
expression—as receiver of the art
ist's creation. Just as food and
reproduction are necessary to en
gender further life, so, too, are

works of art. Mr. Elder explained.
Artistic creations provide the
inspiration—the fount, the very
impulse-—for the "energy" needed
to "organize" one's "environ
ment," for ihe sustenance of the
"steady state," and for the very
maintenance of "life."
"ART ALLOWS the organism
the freedom to express itself with
out obligation," Mr. Elder con
tinued. Indeed, only such an art
form can provide the full oppor
tunity and the veritable chal
lenge—to sustain the life of the
single human organism, to sus
tain the "steady state," and to
give the individual his due iden
tity and respect for his very exis

fence.
The urgency of this analogy,
Mr. Elder explained, is glaringly
apparent when one notes the cur
re nt widespread misunderstand
ing of the intent, purpose, and
very reason for the occurrence
of architecture as a requisite for
the sustenance of the human or
ganism. It is not only for keeping
rain off peoples' heads.
If architecture- a part of the
human's environment practically
every minute of every day—can
not rally occasional moments of
personal justification for living,
then indeed it may he a thorough
ly misunderstood, if not lost, art
form.

"ART ALLOWS the organism
the freedom to express itself with
out obligation," Mr. Elder con
tinued. Indeed, only such an art
form can provide the full oppor
tunity and the veritable chal
lenge—to sustain the life of the
single human organism, to sus
tain the "steady state," and to
give the individual his due iden
tity and respect for his very exis

fence.
The urgency of this analogy,
Mr. Elder explained, is glaringly
apparent when one notes the cur
re nt widespread misunderstand
ing of the intent, purpose, and
very reason for the occurrence
of architecture as a requisite for
the sustenance of the human or
ganism. It is not only for keeping
rain off peoples' heads.
If architecture- a part of the
human's environment practically
every minute of every day—can
not rally occasional moments of
personal justification for living,
then indeed it may he a thorough
ly misunderstood, if not lost, art
form.
In two highly thought-provok
ing lectures, a noted architeetura
scholar provided his summei
quarter audiences with sugges

i tural styles, and on environment
and the art form.
Henry Elder — Dean of the
School of Architecture at the Uni
versity of British Columbia in
Vancouver charged his deliveries
with much interest. He was mark-
I edly moved by his return to Stan
ford, in visits with colleagues,
students, and friends whose re
spect and admiration he had won
I while instructing here in 1961,
In his first lecture on the anal
! y.sis of architectural styles of var
; ious cultures, Mr. Elder theorized
that any given style experiences
its conception, birth, growth,
flowering, maturing, decay, and
death.
HE HYPOTHESIZED that just
as one architectural style grows
J to its heighth—its flowering—the
conception of the subsequent style
occurs. And as the old style whith
ers and dies, the new style is born,
and glows to its flowering stage.
The current modern trend
flowered in the 1930's and is now
refining itself in the elegance of
maturity. The birth pangs of a
new style were felt in the early
20th century—with the concept of
e ~ me-.
The architectural style of a cul
ture often relates to that culture's
interpretation of the universe, Mr.
Elder noted. Since Einstein's
time, there has developed the no
tion in astronomy that the uni
verse is expanding and infinite,
but bounded. A new style in ar
chitecture is afoot, which invari
ably develops to be "infinte and
expanding, but bounded." The
current modern style reflects an
understanding of an infinite and
unbounded universe—and should
nol last much past the 20th cen
tury. It is endless, in a sense, in
that it is possible to add and add
unit elements, or modules.
Alternating styles have a few
essential similar characteristics.
The Greek, Gothic, and Modern
are featured by a modular con
cept—you can add or take away
the unit elements. Roman and
Renaissance are completed, or or
ganic, and one cannot add or take
away parts of buildings in these
styles. Barouque, Rococe, and
Victorian are considered as out
growths of the Renaissance space
concept, in this frame of refer
ence.
Though Frank Lloyd Wright
occasionally worked with the mod
ule, he was the last glorious em
ber of the Renaissance concept—
as his buildings were usually or
ganic and complete, not modular.
In this sense, then, Wright was
not "modern" at all. (Indeed, Mr.
Wright began practice in the

i 1880's). That Wright is the "father
of modern architecture" is more
a convenient cliche of tlie "sellers"
of architecture, than it is a tru
; ism, in this context.

modern style featuring the mod
\ ule. Evidence of a new non-mod
ular style that will succeed the
current modern notion of architec
ture in Ronchamps Cathedral,
France, by Le Corbusier, sug
gested by Elder.
"The nature of architectural
styles is that they seem to last
for several generations. Thus, the
'new' style—though growing—
will not flower for some time, and
by then 'modern' architecture will
be in its death throes."
MR. ELDUR TRACED this pat
tern of simultaneous flowering
and death of adjacent architec
tural styles to the Western cul
tures: Modern flowered as Ren

ered as Gothic died; Medieval
Christian flowered as Roman i
died; and Roman flowered as
Greek died.
Mr. Elder raised some curiosity 1
the next day, when he applied i
art theory to the idea that man
shapes his environment. To be
gin, Mr. Elder recalled that envi
ronment is defined in physiology
as a series of "unorganized" con
ditions outside an organism. The
organism uses "energy" to "or- j

ogically, such use of energy is I
called the condition of the "steady

THREE REQUIREMENTS are
necessary to sustain the "steady

the specie, and 3> formation of
groups.
The first two requirements are
self-explanatory; it is with the
latter stipulation—the formation
of groups—that Mr. Elder sug
gested his analogy.
For it is the formation of a
group that provides the medium
in which the human can commu
nicate and express ideas. The com
municated ideas significant to this
discussion are those known as
works of art architecture being
one of many examples.
THOUGH ARTISTIC express
sion and creation are by an in
dividual, the group is necessary
to complete the cycle of artistic
expression—as receiver of the art
ist's creation. Just as food and
reproduction are necessary to en
gender further life, so, too, are

works of art. Mr. Elder explained.
Artistic creations provide the
inspiration—the fount, the very
impulse-—for the "energy" needed
to "organize" one's "environ
ment," for ihe sustenance of the
"steady state," and for the very
maintenance of "life."
"ART ALLOWS the organism

self-explanatory; it is with the
latter stipulation—the formation
of groups—that Mr. Elder sug
gested his analogy.
For it is the formation of a
group that provides the medium
in which the human can commu
nicate and express ideas. The com
municated ideas significant to this
discussion are those known as
works of art architecture being
one of many examples.
THOUGH ARTISTIC express
sion and creation are by an in
dividual, the group is necessary
to complete the cycle of artistic
expression—as receiver of the art
ist's creation. Just as food and
reproduction are necessary to en
gender further life, so, too, are

works of art. Mr. Elder explained.
Artistic creations provide the
inspiration—the fount, the very
impulse-—for the "energy" needed
to "organize" one's "environ
ment," for ihe sustenance of the
"steady state," and for the very
maintenance of "life."
"ART ALLOWS the organism
the freedom to express itself with
out obligation," Mr. Elder con
tinued. Indeed, only such an art
form can provide the full oppor
tunity and the veritable chal
lenge—to sustain the life of the
single human organism, to sus
tain the "steady state," and to
give the individual his due iden
tity and respect for his very exis

fence.
The urgency of this analogy,
Mr. Elder explained, is glaringly
apparent when one notes the cur
re nt widespread misunderstand
ing of the intent, purpose, and
very reason for the occurrence
of architecture as a requisite for
the sustenance of the human or
ganism. It is not only for keeping
rain off peoples' heads.
If architecture- a part of the
human's environment practically
every minute of every day—can
not rally occasional moments of
personal justification for living,
then indeed it may he a thorough
ly misunderstood, if not lost, art
form.
In two highly thought-provok
ing lectures, a noted architeetura
scholar provided his summei
quarter audiences with sugges
tions for speculation on architec
i tural styles, and on environment
and the art form.
Henry Elder — Dean of the
School of Architecture at the Uni
versity of British Columbia in
Vancouver charged his deliveries
with much interest. He was mark-
I edly moved by his return to Stan
ford, in visits with colleagues,
students, and friends whose re
spect and admiration he had won
I while instructing here in 1961,
In his first lecture on the anal
! y.sis of architectural styles of var
; ious cultures, Mr. Elder theorized
that any given style experiences
its conception, birth, growth,
flowering, maturing, decay, and
death.
HE HYPOTHESIZED that just
as one architectural style grows
J to its heighth—its flowering—the
conception of the subsequent style
occurs. And as the old style whith
ers and dies, the new style is born,
and glows to its flowering stage.
The current modern trend
flowered in the 1930's and is now
refining itself in the elegance of
maturity. The birth pangs of a
new style were felt in the early
20th century—with the concept of
e ~ me-.
The architectural style of a cul
ture often relates to that culture's
interpretation of the universe, Mr.
Elder noted. Since Einstein's
time, there has developed the no
tion in astronomy that the uni
verse is expanding and infinite,
but bounded. A new style in ar
chitecture is afoot, which invari
ably develops to be "infinte and
expanding, but bounded." The
current modern style reflects an
understanding of an infinite and
unbounded universe—and should
nol last much past the 20th cen
tury. It is endless, in a sense, in
that it is possible to add and add
unit elements, or modules.
Alternating styles have a few
essential similar characteristics.
The Greek, Gothic, and Modern
are featured by a modular con
cept—you can add or take away
the unit elements. Roman and
Renaissance are completed, or or
ganic, and one cannot add or take
away parts of buildings in these
styles. Barouque, Rococe, and
Victorian are considered as out
growths of the Renaissance space
concept, in this frame of refer
ence.
Though Frank Lloyd Wright
occasionally worked with the mod
ule, he was the last glorious em
ber of the Renaissance concept—
as his buildings were usually or
ganic and complete, not modular.
In this sense, then, Wright was
not "modern" at all. (Indeed, Mr.
Wright began practice in the

i 1880's). That Wright is the "father
of modern architecture" is more
a convenient cliche of tlie "sellers"
of architecture, than it is a tru
; ism, in this context.

modern style featuring the mod
\ ule. Evidence of a new non-mod
ular style that will succeed the
current modern notion of architec
ture in Ronchamps Cathedral,
France, by Le Corbusier, sug
gested by Elder.
"The nature of architectural
styles is that they seem to last
for several generations. Thus, the
'new' style—though growing—
will not flower for some time, and
by then 'modern' architecture will
be in its death throes."
MR. ELDUR TRACED this pat
tern of simultaneous flowering
and death of adjacent architec
tural styles to the Western cul
tures: Modern flowered as Ren
aissance died& Renaissance flow
ered as Gothic died; Medieval
Christian flowered as Roman i
died; and Roman flowered as
Greek died.
Mr. Elder raised some curiosity 1
the next day, when he applied i
art theory to the idea that man
shapes his environment. To be
gin, Mr. Elder recalled that envi
ronment is defined in physiology
as a series of "unorganized" con
ditions outside an organism. The
organism uses "energy" to "or- j
ganize" his environment. Physiol- j
ogically, such use of energy is I
called the condition of the "steady
state," a characteristic of all 'liv

Mr. Elder raised some curiosity 1
the next day, when he applied i
art theory to the idea that man
shapes his environment. To be
gin, Mr. Elder recalled that envi
ronment is defined in physiology
as a series of "unorganized" con
ditions outside an organism. The
organism uses "energy" to "or- j
ganize" his environment. Physiol- j
ogically, such use of energy is I
called the condition of the "steady
state," a characteristic of all 'liv
ing' matter.
THREE REQUIREMENTS are
necessary to sustain the "steady
state" of the organism: 1) acqui
sition of food, 2) reproduction of
the specie, and 3> formation of
groups.
The first two requirements are
self-explanatory; it is with the
latter stipulation—the formation
of groups—that Mr. Elder sug
gested his analogy.
For it is the formation of a
group that provides the medium
in which the human can commu
nicate and express ideas. The com
municated ideas significant to this
discussion are those known as
works of art architecture being
one of many examples.
THOUGH ARTISTIC express
sion and creation are by an in
dividual, the group is necessary
to complete the cycle of artistic
expression—as receiver of the art
ist's creation. Just as food and
reproduction are necessary to en
gender further life, so, too, are

works of art. Mr. Elder explained.
Artistic creations provide the
inspiration—the fount, the very
impulse-—for the "energy" needed
to "organize" one's "environ
ment," for ihe sustenance of the
"steady state," and for the very
maintenance of "life."
"ART ALLOWS the organism
the freedom to express itself with
out obligation," Mr. Elder con
tinued. Indeed, only such an art
form can provide the full oppor
tunity and the veritable chal
lenge—to sustain the life of the
single human organism, to sus
tain the "steady state," and to
give the individual his due iden
tity and respect for his very exis

fence.
The urgency of this analogy,
Mr. Elder explained, is glaringly
apparent when one notes the cur
re nt widespread misunderstand
ing of the intent, purpose, and
very reason for the occurrence
of architecture as a requisite for
the sustenance of the human or
ganism. It is not only for keeping
rain off peoples' heads.
If architecture- a part of the
human's environment practically
every minute of every day—can
not rally occasional moments of
personal justification for living,
then indeed it may he a thorough
ly misunderstood, if not lost, art
form.
In two highly thought-provok
ing lectures, a noted architeetura
scholar provided his summei
quarter audiences with sugges
tions for speculation on architec
i tural styles, and on environment
and the art form.
Henry Elder — Dean of the
School of Architecture at the Uni
versity of British Columbia in
Vancouver charged his deliveries
with much interest. He was mark-
I edly moved by his return to Stan
ford, in visits with colleagues,
students, and friends whose re
spect and admiration he had won
I while instructing here in 1961,
In his first lecture on the anal
! y.sis of architectural styles of var
; ious cultures, Mr. Elder theorized
that any given style experiences
its conception, birth, growth,
flowering, maturing, decay, and
death.
HE HYPOTHESIZED that just
as one architectural style grows
J to its heighth—its flowering—the
conception of the subsequent style
occurs. And as the old style whith
ers and dies, the new style is born,
and glows to its flowering stage.
The current modern trend
flowered in the 1930's and is now
refining itself in the elegance of
maturity. The birth pangs of a
new style were felt in the early
20th century—with the concept of
e ~ me-.
The architectural style of a cul
ture often relates to that culture's
interpretation of the universe, Mr.
Elder noted. Since Einstein's
time, there has developed the no
tion in astronomy that the uni
verse is expanding and infinite,
but bounded. A new style in ar
chitecture is afoot, which invari
ably develops to be "infinte and
expanding, but bounded." The
current modern style reflects an
understanding of an infinite and
unbounded universe—and should
nol last much past the 20th cen
tury. It is endless, in a sense, in
that it is possible to add and add
unit elements, or modules.
Alternating styles have a few
essential similar characteristics.
The Greek, Gothic, and Modern
are featured by a modular con
cept—you can add or take away
the unit elements. Roman and
Renaissance are completed, or or
ganic, and one cannot add or take
away parts of buildings in these
styles. Barouque, Rococe, and
Victorian are considered as out
growths of the Renaissance space
concept, in this frame of refer
ence.
Though Frank Lloyd Wright
occasionally worked with the mod
ule, he was the last glorious em
ber of the Renaissance concept—
as his buildings were usually or
ganic and complete, not modular.
In this sense, then, Wright was
not "modern" at all. (Indeed, Mr.
Wright began practice in the

i 1880's). That Wright is the "father
of modern architecture" is more
a convenient cliche of tlie "sellers"
of architecture, than it is a tru
; ism, in this context.
THE BAUIIAUS SCHOOL
founded by Walter Gropius, and
| the buildings of Mies van der
; Rohe are more typical of the
modern style featuring the mod
\ ule. Evidence of a new non-mod
ular style that will succeed the
current modern notion of architec
ture in Ronchamps Cathedral,
France, by Le Corbusier, sug
gested by Elder.
"The nature of architectural
styles is that they seem to last
for several generations. Thus, the
'new' style—though growing—
will not flower for some time, and
by then 'modern' architecture will
be in its death throes."
MR. ELDUR TRACED this pat
tern of simultaneous flowering
and death of adjacent architec
tural styles to the Western cul
tures: Modern flowered as Ren
aissance died& Renaissance flow
ered as Gothic died; Medieval
Christian flowered as Roman i
