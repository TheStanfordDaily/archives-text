# Stanford to Face Strong Passing
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Sports Editor 
The Stanford Indians, missing a
few feathers since the start of the
season, try their luck tomorrow
night against Rice, a small Texas
school with a big football reputa
tion.
If Stanford is to better last
year's 5-5 mark, tomorrow night's
game is a must for Coach John
Ralston's charges. A loss to the
Owls would drop the Tribe to a
1-3 mark with three more games
on the schedule <Notre Dame,
USC, and Oregon State» in which
Stanford is definitely the under
dog.
BUT BEATING RICE, a 13
point favorite, won't be easy, es
pecially without quarterback
Clark Weaver, finished for the
year with a knee injury. The only
other times the two schools have
met, in 1957-58, the Indians lost
34-7 and 30-7.
Ralston's biggest problem is
finding a replacement for the in
jured Weaver. Sophomore Mike
Connelly rates as the favorite
l ight now, but another soph, Dick
Berg, is also a candidate. Berg is
probably the better passer, but
has had two interceptions in 14
attempts thus far in the season.
One interception, with a 46-yard
run back, set up UCLA's winning
touchdown last week.
If both of these fail, Dick Rags
dale, the top Frosh quarterback

of two years ago, may get a shot
at the post. Ragsdale, converted
by Ralston into a halfback last
spring, has been doing some work
at quarterback. Steve Thurlow,
another reconverted quarterback,
will remain at halfback, but it is
possible that he may have a big
ger share in the Tribe passing
attack.
ANOTHER LOSS, defensive
back Jim Shroyer, could plague
the Indians against Rice, too.
Shroyer, a big part of the Tribe
pass defense, hurt his leg in prac
tice this week and is a doubtful
for this wekeend.
The Cards' pass defense, worst
in the Big Six, was steadied last
weekend with the addition of Jim
Richie, but the loss of Shroyer
could give Ralston real problems
in handling Rice's quarterback
duo, Walt Mcßeynolds and Benny
Hollingworth. Shroyer's 39.7 yard
punting average will be missed
by the Cards, too.
Rice, a consistent threat in the
tough SWC, upset LSU 21-12 in
their opener two weeks ago, and
dropped last week's game to Penn
State, 28-7. Last year Jess Neely's
Owls tied Texas 14-14 and LSU
6-6 in a couple of surprises, but
lost most of the rest for a 2-6-2
final mark.

THEIR ONLY big loss from
last year's team was end Gene
Raesz who topped the squad in
receptions last year with 29. Ran
dall Kerbox, the Owls' top passer
last year also graduated, but Mr-
Reynolds with 115 completions in
33 attempts and Hollingsworth,
15 for 25 seem to be more than
adequate replacements at quarter
back.
Rice has been mostly a passing
club this year averaging 21(5 yards
in the air per game and only 81.5
yards on the ground. So the big
problems that face the Indians
going into tomorrow's game, are
stopping Rice's parsing game, and
developing a passing attack of
their own. If they can solve both
these problems Saturday, the In
dians could come home with an
upset in their belts.

STANFORD RICE
Patitucci REL Sylvester
Nichols RTL Stewart
Wilbur RGL B. Walker
Harris C M. Walker
Chappie LGR Nichols
