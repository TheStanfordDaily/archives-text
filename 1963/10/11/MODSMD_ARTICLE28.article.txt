# Frosh Team Begins Season
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
In preparation for three weeks,
an able Stanford Frosh football
team will get its first taste of
outside competition when it faces
the experienced Santa Clara
J.V.'s tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in
Stanford Stadium. Coach Bill
Walsh thinks the game will be a
tough one because Santa Clara
already has played several games,
but he thinks the team is ready.
Walsh expects the team to have
an "explosive attack." The abund
ance of backfield talent that
prompted him to make this pre
diction includes Dave Lewis at
quarterback, Bob Oar and Bob
Blunt at the halfback slots and
either Mike Hibler or Bill Ost
rander at fullback.
DAVE LEWIS, 190 pounder

from Clovis, is a fine passer and j
runner and figures to be the
spearhead of a strong aerial at
tack. Targets include right end.
Bob Newberry and left end A 1
Wilburn besides the halfbacks, j
Dan DeSomery, a top contender 1
for end, will not see action be-,
cause of a bruised shoulder.
Helping Dave Lewis in signal-:
calling duties are Rick Biachina j
and John Propstra. Coach Walsh j
indicated that a'l three will defi-!
nitely see action.
Oar and Blunt ai-e fine runners i
offering not only fine natural ;
ability but also speed. Walsh is
counting on them to do most of
the pigskin toting. Greg Ford and
Mike Reppy are able substitutes.
THE LINK, not as strong depth-!
wise as the backfield, has im
proved steadily. Players to watch |
in the lino are center Otis Smith, i
guard Dave Net to. and tackles !
Jim Mills and Jack Longinotti.
All weigh over 200 pounds. Bob;
Petersen ,a center, and Bob Ar- j
non, a guard, will see extensive !
duty as replacements for the'
starters.
The frosh footballers recently
took on the varsity reserves in a j
scrimmage. Coach Walsh was
pleased with the freshmen show
ing, particularly with the per
formance of quarterback Rick
Bianchina and fullback Mike Hib
ler. Bianchina not only passed
and ran well but did an outstand
ing job of overall play calling.
Walsh has named Hibler and
Bianchina to be the co-captains j
in the season's opener.
AS SANTA CLARA has only
one player in the 200 bracket,
Stanford will have a definite
weight advantage. The young
Tribe will also have a depth ad
vantage. The game will decide
whether size can defeat experi
ence.
All freshmen men and women
are strongly urged to support
this their class' first collegiate
football endeavor.
