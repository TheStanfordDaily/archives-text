# Shriver: Man with a Message
## 
### BILL MOORE Staff Editor 
Peace Corps Director Robert
Sargent Shriver was a man with
a message yesterday.
And it was all Peace Corps.
In a whirlwind tour of The
Farm that would do credit to any
Fuller Brush man, Schriver man
aged to pump every arm in sight
— all the way from Medical School
to Tresidder Union.
AS HE EXPLAINED to The
Daily in a special interview yes
terday afternoon:
"What we're trying to do is to
keep this organization pepped up.
One of the things about the Peace
Corps is thai we have to be appeal
ing. If we were authoritarian and
stiff, no one would want to volun
teer. Pep that's what we want."
And pop is Schriver's specialty.
RELAXING AT TRESIDDER
before his speech yesterday after
noon, Schriver talked, looked and
acted like a Kennedy and, as the
President's brother-in-law, he al
most qualifies. The JFK haircut
was missing (his looked more like
Bobby's), but nothing else was.
There was the same vibrant East
ern twang, the staccato-like ges
turing, the conservative dark suit
and the sly humor.
And, of course, there was the
energy.
"In a job this hectic you've got
to have that," he pointed out.
"How else can you start a Peace
Corps from nothing? It's just
like the guy who sculptures a
statue: He had nothing to start
with but a block of marble. In our
case, nobody had ever seen a
Peace Corps before we thought it

up."
Schriver now spends most of
his timo traveling, both at home
and abroad.
HE STILL RECALLS vividly—
but not without shuddering his
trip this year to Ghana, where he
was given a plush welcome by a
group of natives in the interior.
, After a flourish of drums, lie ar
1 rived in a tribal court teeming
with brightly-clad officials.
"The chief of the tribe was
seated in one corner, with a
crown on his head and surrounded
by leopard skins. After I was
: seated, a messenger came over to
me and asked who I was, my
country and so forth. I replied
! although I think he knew and he
| went back to inform the chief.
"The chief conferred with the
elders of the tribe, and after a
I while they came over and greeted
us but their faces were grave.
| Then we went over and greeted
them. Following another tribal
conference, they came over and
gave us an official greeting. This
time they were all smiling."
AFTER THE TRIBE presented
gifts to Schriver and his aides, the
chief performed a ceremonial
| dance in his honor.
"It was fantastic. But when lie
finished, the messenger came
, and asked if I'd dance for them,
i So I had to do it and you've
never seen anything funnier: I did
I a little Bossanova and a little jit
terbug. The place went wild. Even
the fellows with me from Peace
Corps were applauding loudly."
It wasn't until afterwards, how
ever, that Schriver discovered 1he
tribal chief had an M.A. from Ox
! ford.
DESPITE THE STRAIN of it
all. Schriver is still able to claim
i "there's no better job in Wash
ington" than that of Peace Corps
boss.
He added: "My life has pre
pared me well for this. I've had
an extensive legal and business
, background. |He was head of the
1 Merchandise Mart in Chicago be
fore joining the New Frontier|,

and I've worked for some tirru
with the Experiment in Interna
tional Living.
"But I must admit: This Peacc
Corps is one helluvan adventure.'
