# Response Encourages Coordinators Of New Cultural Bus Program to S.F.

### MEIMEI CHENG 
Favorable responses from stu
dents and generous cooperation
from the Tresidder Ticket Office
have thus far greatly encouraged
the coordinators of the Saturday
night cultural bus program. Their
efforts to afford inexpensive, con
venient transportation to cultural

offerings in San Francisco are
being supported by the Commit
tee on General Studies, which
successfully initiated similar pro
grams at overseas campuses.
Familiar with the transporta
tion arrangements overseas,
which enabled Stanford students
to attend events away from the
foreign campuses, Rich Van Morn
investigated the possibility of es
tablishing closer contact between
San Francisco and the Stanford
home campus.
THE PRIMARY AIM in view
was to stimulate more interest in
the cultural activities of the city
by making them readily access
ible. Van Horn, now general co
ordinator of the program, found
substantial support from the Tre
sidder Ticket Office and the Gen
eral Studies Committee, which
had already instituted regular bus
trips to the San Francisco Sym
phony concerts.
Presently in its initial stages of
operation, the program will in
crease its scope after systems of
ticket selling and event schedul
ing become more established. It
is expected that more and more
cultural offerings will be added in
the future.
At present, the program in
cludes: Oct. 12, Gilbert and Sulli
van, "Princess Ida," Harding
Theater; Oct. 19, Actor's Work
shop, "Taming of the Shrew,"
Shakespeare Marine's Memorial
Theater; Oct. 26, Sabicus Fla
menco Guitar, Nourse Auditor
ium; Nov. 2, San Francisco Inter
national Film Festival. Metro
Theater; Nov. 9, Actor's Work
shop, to be announced; Nov. 16,
Actor's Workshop, "The Caretak
ers," by Harold Pinter, Marine's
Memorial Theater.
TO AID IN the scheduling of
buses, students are encouraged to
buy their tickets in advance. The
tradition of Dutch treat is also
encouraged.
Tickets will be sold one week
in advance at the Tresidder Ticket
Office. The cost, $1.2."5 per person,
round trip, represents a savings
of around 25-50 cents over com
mercial bus lines which are also
extremely inconvenient to use.
Seats will be allotted on a first
come, first-served basis. Any re
ma iriing space will be sold at the
time of departure, however, it is
hoped that students will purchase
their bus tickets at the same time
they buy the tickets for the par
ticular event.
The schedule of departures for
the coming weeks has been set
up: Wilbur. 6:50 p.m.; Roble, 7
p.m.; Bowman Alumni House,
7:1 u p.m.

extremely inconvenient to use.

Familiar with the transporta

which enabled Stanford students
to attend events away from the
foreign campuses, Rich Van Morn
investigated the possibility of es
tablishing closer contact between
San Francisco and the Stanford

THE PRIMARY AIM in view
was to stimulate more interest in
the cultural activities of the city
by making them readily access

ordinator of the program, found
substantial support from the Tre
sidder Ticket Office and the Gen
eral Studies Committee, which
had already instituted regular bus
trips to the San Francisco Sym
phony concerts.
Presently in its initial stages of
operation, the program will in
crease its scope after systems of
ticket selling and event schedul
ing become more established. It
is expected that more and more
cultural offerings will be added in
the future.
