GOOD WORKS WON'T GET YOU TO HEAVEN
For by grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves: it is the
gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. . . . (Eph. 2: 8,9).
Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His
mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy
Ghost; which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour."
(Titus 3:5-7).
You can't work your way into Heaven. Salvation is God's free gift to man. But
like any other gift, you must accept it before you can enjoy it. A step of faith
and commitment to Jesus Christ is all that is required in order to be born into
God's family. It is so simple and easy that many have missed the truth. Don't
be left out.
