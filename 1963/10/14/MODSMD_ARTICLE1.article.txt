# Rice Owls Whip Indians With Second Half Surge
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Sports Editor 
In a weekend of major college upsets, Stanford almost came up
with one of its own against Rice Saturday night at Houston, but
the Tribe's second half doldroms coupled with a strong Rice attack
handed Stanford its third defeat of the season 23-13.
Stanford led at half time 13-6 and seemed to be headed for a major

► upset over the highly favored
Owls until a fumble, a pass inter
ception, and one determined Rice
drive provided the hosts with a
pair of touchdowns and a field
goal for a ten point winning mar
, gin.
THIS WAS the second straight
week that Stanford has blown a
halftiine lead to lose. Last week
the Tribe was out in front by a
9-3 margin when UCLA bounced
back with a touchdown in the
fourth period for a 10-9 win.
When the Stanford attack was
moving, the Indians looked as
good as at any time this season,
with quarterbacks Mike Connel
ly and Dick Berg both running
the team well.
Third team quarterback Don
Cook also moved into contention
for the starting berth with a
final quarter passing surge that
moved the Indians to the Rice
five yard line. Cook hit four of
six passes in the drive.
TIIE CARDS took the lead late
in the first quarter taking advan
tage of the second of four O w 1
fumbles that they recovered that
evening. Following end Mike Mc-
Cormick's recovery of Russ
Wayt's fumble on the Rice 26.
Berg and the second team drove
to the 13 where the first unit
came in.
Halfback Steve Thurlow hit the
right end for five yards and on
the next play caught Connelly's
pass for the touchdown. The com
pletion was Connelly's only one
of the night in seven attempts.
Braden Beck got the extra point
for a 7-0 margin at 3:51.
Rice came right back to score
at the start of the second period
as tailback Gene Fleming broke
around right end and outran the
Indians to the Stanford end zone
forty yards away. But the Indians
held the lead at 7-6 as the Rice
extra point attempt was wide to
the right of the goal posts.
THOUGH THE Indians couldn't
cross the Owls' goal line for the
rest of the game, the Cards
weren't through building up their
slender lead, for the second half
slump.
Thurlow started the next drive
returning the Rice kickoff 32
yards to the Stanford 44 and after
an incomplete pass by Connelly
and a five yard penalty against
the Tribe, Thurlow, on a halfback
pass tossed a 40 yarder toward
Bob Howard who vanished under
a pair of Rice defenders before
the ball arrived. The resulting
pass interference gave the Tribe
the ball on the Rice 21.
Three downs later the Tribe
was still on the 21 as the Owl
defense stiffened. But Braden
Beck whose earlier extra point
was the Indians' narrow margin
came in for his second field goal
attempt of the game. Unlike the
first, a 49 yard attempt in t he
first period, this one was good
from the 2N for a 10-6 lead.
Rice started moving on the next
set of plays, a solid ground at
tack and a 15 yard personal foul
moving the ball to the Stanford
28 where Fleming was hit by
Frank Patitucci and fumbled, de
fensive back Craig Ritchey re
covering for the Indians.
STANFORD COULDN'T move
the ball and Ragsdale punted to
Fleming, who fumbled again, A 1
Hildebrand grabbing the ball just
inside the 50.

Given a second chance by Flem
ing, the Tribe, with Berg quarter
backing. pushed down to the Rice
10 where Beck kicked his second
field goal of the game, a 36
yarder for a 13-6 ha Iftime lead.
The big plays in the last Stan
lord scoring drive of the game
were a 16 yard pass Berg to Thur
low. and a 15 yard gain by lull
back Tony DeLillis on the follow
ing play.
It took Rice a little more than
four minutes of the second half
to undo the Stanford lead. Con
nelly opened the gates with a
fumbled snap from center on the
Stanford 48 at 11:40 of the third
quarter.
LARIiY STEWART recovered
for the Owls and three plays later
the score was tied 13 all on a 30
yard pass by Walt Mcßeynolds to
end John Sylvester.
Each team held until midway
in the final quarter when the In
dians cracked. With fullback
Paul Piper and wingback Billy
Hale hitting the center of the
Stanford line for consistent yard
age the Owls drove from their 42
to the Stanford 6 where on a

fourth and one Larry Rico kicked 1
a 22 yard field goal to put the
Owls ahead.
With four minutes left Stan- i
ford was still in the ball game, |
at least for one play. Following j
the kick, Berg tossed a pass to i
Thurlow, which Rice defensive
back Larry Callihan picked off at j
the Stanford 45. Nobody slopped !
him as he raced all the way for
the deciding score.
AS THE STANDS began to
empty in the waning minutes of
the game, the Tribe got off one
last drive, engineered by third
stringer Cook. Starting from the
31 he hit McCormick for 14, Pat
titucci for 17, and Ragsdale for]
8 on successive plays, and after |
one incomplete, hit Bob Mont-;
gomery for 25 yards down to the
Rice five.
But Cook's magic failed there. !
He was hit for a 13 yard loss on !
the next play and had his final
pass of the day intercepted with
25 seconds left to end the Stan- 1
ford threat.
After the game Stanford head |
football coach John Ralston was I
anything but pleased with the
outcome. "The team played well
and deserved to win," he said, |
adding that Stanford could well
have won had they been able to
move the ball during the second
half.
"We haven't far to go to vic
tory," Ralston said.
After two weeks on the thres
hold of victory one can hardly
disagree.
