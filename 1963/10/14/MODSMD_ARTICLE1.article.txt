## 
### JUSTIN BECK Sports Editor 
In a weekend of major college upsets, Stanford almost came up
with one of its own against Rice Saturday night at Houston, but
the Tribe's second half doldroms coupled with a strong Rice attack
handed Stanford its third defeat of the season 23-13.
Stanford led at half time 13-6 and seemed to be headed for a major

► upset over the highly favored
Owls until a fumble, a pass inter
ception, and one determined Rice
drive provided the hosts with a
pair of touchdowns and a field
goal for a ten point winning mar
, gin.
THIS WAS the second straight
week that Stanford has blown a
halftiine lead to lose. Last week
the Tribe was out in front by a
9-3 margin when UCLA bounced
back with a touchdown in the
fourth period for a 10-9 win.
When the Stanford attack was
moving, the Indians looked as
good as at any time this season,
with quarterbacks Mike Connel
ly and Dick Berg both running
the team well.
Third team quarterback Don
Cook also moved into contention
for the starting berth with a
final quarter passing surge that
moved the Indians to the Rice
five yard line. Cook hit four of
six passes in the drive.
TIIE CARDS took the lead late
in the first quarter taking advan
tage of the second of four O w 1
fumbles that they recovered that
evening. Following end Mike Mc-
Cormick's recovery of Russ
Wayt's fumble on the Rice 26.
Berg and the second team drove
to the 13 where the first unit
came in.
Halfback Steve Thurlow hit the
right end for five yards and on
the next play caught Connelly's
pass for the touchdown. The com
pletion was Connelly's only one
of the night in seven attempts.
Braden Beck got the extra point
for a 7-0 margin at 3:51.
Rice came right back to score
at the start of the second period
as tailback Gene Fleming broke
around right end and outran the
Indians to the Stanford end zone
forty yards away. But the Indians
held the lead at 7-6 as the Rice
extra point attempt was wide to
the right of the goal posts.
THOUGH THE Indians couldn't
cross the Owls' goal line for the
rest of the game, the Cards
weren't through building up their
slender lead, for the second half
slump.
Thurlow started the next drive
returning the Rice kickoff 32
yards to the Stanford 44 and after
an incomplete pass by Connelly
