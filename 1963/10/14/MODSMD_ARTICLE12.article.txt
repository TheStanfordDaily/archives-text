### 
United Press Internationa'
LONDON Communist Chinese leader Mao T/.e-Tung, 159. is
planning to step down soon from active leadership of his nation
and assume the status of an elder statesman, according to reports
circulating among Communist sources.
Informed sources said Mao's possible retirement would have little
foreseeable effect on China's hostility toward the West or its cur
rent dispute with Ihe Soviet Union.
Liu Shai-chi, who succeeded Mao as chairman of the Chinese
People's Republic four years ago. was considered the best bet to
become the new head of the Chinese Communist party.
He is a reputed "hard liner" who would continue the present tough
course against Moscow and the West, the sources said.
NO DISPUTE OVER ACCESS RIGHTS BERLIN U.S. Army
convoys demonstrating American access rights to Berlin next week
will avoid disputes with Soviet control officers over dismounting
from their vehicles informed sources said yesterday.
Several convoys will move in both directions over the 110-mile
East German Autobahn between West Berlin and West Germany to
demonstrate that last week's three-day holdup did not lessen allied
access rights.
NO VICTORY UNDER DIEM WASHINGTON Tran Von
Chuong, who resigned as South Vietnamese ambassador to the
United States in protest ot his government's policies, said yesterday
there was "no possibility" the war against the Communists could be
won under President Nego Dinh Diem.
Chuong was asked about the U.S announcement that the major
portion of its military effort in Viet Nam would end in 1965.
"It is up to the United States to withdraw its military advisors
in 1965. 1956 or 1961," Chuong said. "But that does not mean the end
of the war is near."
