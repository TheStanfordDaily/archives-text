One year ago this month "they"
said Ole Miss was dead.
The almost unanimous opinion
of newspaper reports and editor
ials around the nation was that
the University of Mississippi had
had it.
On the night of September 30.
a bloody riot against the admis
sion of Negro James Meredith
had engulfed the otherwise se
date campus. Almost all the riot
ers were outsiders, but that mat
tered little. Most of the Northern
press launched an anti-Oie Miss
campaign as if the University
itself had planned and carried out
the riot.

Did these soothsayers prove to
be right? Did the University of
Mississippi walk silently to its
grave? Hardly. Under the most
adverse of conditions, it enjoyed
one of its most productive years.
But that is a story that has never
been published.
As soon as tho tear gas cleared,
Ole Miss started repairing cracks
in its battered reputation. An d
what it came up with is an in
credible success story stemming
from what to most universities
would have been complete dis
aster.
The first step forward was
made while the month of October
was still an infant. Installation
was begun on the Ole Miss cam
pus of a Dynamitron. the only
such particle accelerator on any
college or university campus in
America. This installation opened
fields of research to be found in
the academic world only at Ole
Miss.

\ More than $2,400,000 in grants
â€¢ rolled in during the year from
governmental and private
i sources.
The students also lost no time
in displaying their determination
to uphold the Ole Miss tradition
of excellence. The University
Players' October production of
"Sainl Joan" was called by a
drama critic "the best college pro
duction ever staged in Missis
i sippi." Honor Roll figures for the
fall semester showed an increase
in the number of students on the
' Honor Roll and a decrease in the
number of students dismissed for
academic reasons.
The second semester of O Ie
; Miss' most difficult year proved
! to be even more successful, al
though some national news media
continued to pounce on every
insignificant mistake made by a
student.
More graduates than ever be
fore received scholarships a n d

fellowships for graduate study at
other universities. Graduates of
the School of Engineering re
ceived job offers from $75 to $200
per month above the national
norm. During the 1962-63 year
Ole Miss awarded approximately
1.3.10 degrees a record.
Enrollment in the 1963 summer
session fell short by only nine
students of breaking the all-time
high for a summer session. A
record number of doctoral de
grees were awarded at the close
of Ihe summer session.
During the year a few profes
sors made bitter attacks on t he
University, knowing that their
words would make national head
lines and enable them to receive
better job offers elsewhere. The
part of the faculty story at Ole
Miss that has not been told is
that the vast majority of Ole
Miss' professors have refused
more lucrative jobs in order to
stav at Ole Miss simplv because

they are fiercely loyal to the Uni
versity. lovo the University, and
are determined to help rebuild
its reputation.
Although enrollment now is
down from the previous year, the
School of Law, the Graduate
School and the School of Pharm
acy all have the highest enroll
ments in the University's history.
Ole Miss has been hurt yes.
But its wounds have healed so
rapidly that the scar tissue is
barely visible. Given time it will
not be visible at all. Ole Miss'
successes during the last year
have not been easy or accidental.
The fight has been uphill and
tough. But the significant fact is
that accomplishment has been
reaped from havoc.
The prophets of gloom and
doom have been proved wrong.
What they did not reckon with
was a 115-year history of adverse
conditions and dogged determina
tion.
