MR. CALM A
(Editor's Note: It has re
cently come to the attention of
The Daily that Mr. Calma's
initial letter, dealing with wom
en's social regulations, had
been printed in a lengthier form
than the Daily permitted in a
publication circulating on cam
pus last year.
The Daily wishes (o maintain
a free forum for all readers,
but prefers that readers limit
themselves to issues currently
concerning them. There is no
need to "test" the Daily letters
policy. Letters do not neces
sarily refleet Daily policy; the
letters column is a free forum,
limited only by laws of libel
and obscenity, and available
spate.)
Editor, The Daily:
I read the letter- written by Mr.
Jacques Calma last week with
some degree of irritation, but his
latest epistle (The Daily, October
11) cannot, go unchallenged.
Mr. Calma asserts that the kind
of reputation which the Funda
mental Standard enjoins us Stan
ford students to preserve and
protect is a "very old and rotten
one." I believe that integrity and
honesty in both academic and
non-academic matters and in deal
ings with others are not at all
rotten; indeed, they are as much
a part; of the Fundamental Stand
ard as personal morality. -Fur
thermore, it is scarcely "obvious"
to me that the Fundamental
Standard "does not reflect stu
dent wishes" or "serve the stu
dents' interest." Mr. Calma's en
tire argument is based on the
fallacy that the interests of the
students and the Administration
are in complete opposition—how
can he postulate that the Admin
istration is here only to support
its own interests against those of
the students?
"The Administration curtails
every activity of moral import,
with the single exception of
smoking outside of class.' This
statement is indeed one of the
most illogical I have ever heard.
I doubt, Mr. Calma, that the Ad
ministration (which you seem to
equate with some kind of omni
present secret police) could do
much about it if you walked
down University Avenue in Palo
Alto and decided to shoot six
passers-by; perhaps you would
claim that this matter has no
moral import.
It seems that Mr. Calma envi
sions a group the size of the Stan
ford student body having no
"standards" at all except for
what is; is it not ludicrous to
deny that when part of a group,
each person has to give up some
of his individual wishes to pre
vent complete anarchy? Of
course, Mr. Calma doesn't state
his concept of the elusive ideal
which should be the norm for all
of us—l suspect his norm has no
ideal(s) behind it, that his norm
is whatever he feels like doing at
any given time. Just as he doesn't
accept the Administration's norm,
whv should it.(and we) accept
his?
The "rationale" behind the
Fundamental Standard is not as
vague as Mr. Calma thinks. I be
lieve I'm correct in saying that
every Stanford student accepts
the Fundamental Standard and
its rationale by his enrollment at
this university. Since Mr. Calma
does not desire to accept it in any
way, and since there is little like
lihood of its being abandoned
in toto by tomorrow morning, I
suggest that he cease committing
the error of following the double
standard of enrolling here and
not agreeing with the precepts of
enrollment and leave post haste,
repairing to some solitary en
vironment where no Administra
tion can regulate every matter of
moral import in his life.
—GEORGE R. HAMRDLA
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Calma's double volley
against the Fundamental Stand
ard and women's social regula
tions was notable for its vigor 1
and intensity.
We are interested. And we are
curious. Does Mr. Calma advo
cate the abolition of all official
standards and regulations in the
social governance of the univer
city? If so, we understand his
alternative to the Fundamental
Standard.
If not, we wonder to what ex
tent it might be proper to temper
social anarchy by regulation in
a private institution. And in what
terms might such regulations be
couched (no pun intended) in or
der to avoid the evil to which
Mr. Calma refers as "inhibition
of sexual behavior"? Perhaps fur
ther explanation of his position
would be helpful.
We would warn, however,
against the hasty assumption that
in all cases Stanford women don't
only because t hey can't.

THE 'VOICE':
NOT WORTH A MARTYR
Editor, The Daily:
It appears to me, as perhaps it
does to a few other people, that
the situation of "The Campus
Voice" has become a bit ludicrous,
a lot of screaming and shouting
to a little end. The editors wish
to have the Voice distributed on
the Stanford campus as it is dis
tributed on every other college
campus in the Bay Area. The
Voice is distributed on campus,
quite legally, in the Union store,

but this is not the way the editors
are used to having their maga
zine distributed. They are no t
satisfied. They want a privilege
granted no other magazine in the
world with the exception of
ASSU sponsored publications, the
privilege of selling in the street.
I think they have a point of
a sort, but if they are in any
sense "right" it is not in a legal
sense. Legality rarely makes for
"rightness," never in a situation
such as this, a situation involv
ing interpretation of the concept
of "freedom." The "Campus
Voice" people, on the other hand,
are openly trying to get in trouble
in the expectation of winning a
case in the courts, and at th e
same time are capitalizing on
their daring. (A salesman, last
Monday, shouting, "Get your
'Campus Voice' before we're ar
rested!")
What we have is a classic sit
uation arousing a stock response,
a small group of people challeng
ing a larger group, a more power
ful group, David and Goliath, and
let's all cheer for the little fel
low, a great sitation for martyrs.
But, quite frankly, I, at least,
do not think the magazine is
worth all the fuss, all the hoarse
ness and exhaustion, all the emo
tion that some people are expend
ing on it. You can get your "Cam
pus Voice" if you want to, if you
are looking for a cause or are
curious. But the magazine is with
out a purpose, without a goal,
and it is not a forum, which
might justify a little of the noise.
On the front page, the cover,
just above the cartoon, you can
find this slogan: "militant,
thoughtful, sensitive." Militant
yes, of that I think there is no
doubt, though I am not so cer
tain that militancy is desirable,
but thoughtful, or sensitive? I
don't think so. But don't take my
word for it, read the Voice and
see. If you have a sense of pro
portion it's kind of fun. But don't
be taken in by the sensationalism,
either that in the magazine, or
that attendent on its distribution.
This cause is not worth a mar
tyr.

TRESIDDER:
'PRO-CREATIVITY?"
Editor, The Daily:
Yesterday evening, between
study breaks, Ol' Eddie and Big
Jim were expressing their na
tural affection for two young
Stanford lovelies in our be
lovedi?) student union. Just as
things were starting to rock, we
were rudely interrupted by an ob
noxious young attendant in cat
sup-stained tunic with the absurd
request to empty our diminutive
ashtray. After painstakingly
rendering this small service (and
removing any potentially smoke
able butts from the tray), he
oozed away from out table to
disturb another Socratic gather
ing.
A bit disconcerted by all this,
we resumed our pursuit of spiri
tual culmination only to be fur
ther disturbed by a young lady
dancing by in an arousingly short
skirt. Our friends, we were
shocked. Our only consolation
was in the Socratic dictum, "Vir
tue is knowledge." The crowning
tragedy of the evening was a
rasping voice informing us that
the Union was "closed." Be as
sured. our friends, that there
could not have been a more effec
tive interruption of our line —
of thought. It was only with the
greatest difficulty that we were
able to revive our conversation,
later in the evening.
But why this tedious account of
our unfortunate experience? Our
friends, the Union is not pro crea
tive thought. It serves only as a
vile instrument for the abase
ment of our spiritual impulses,
the adulteration of our divine
souls, and the destruction of our
noblest aspirations. This former
ly beloved institution is in a sad
state indeed.
We only ask that, you, o u r
friends, reflect upon this matter
with diligence, and through the
medium of this honored news
paper, express your consequential
opinion, in the hope that this
coffeehouse may once again re
gain its for mer stature as a place
where the Western mind may
meet for learned discussion and
scholarly research.

DEAN LARIMER
Editor, The Daily:
As one who has had the plea
sure of working closely with
Dave Larimer, it is difficult to
conceive of his being replaced.
Dean Larimer is a tireless and
capable individual who has man
aged to do a great deal of tan
gible and intangible good for the
University.
Dean Larimer has a remark
able sensitivity to the problems
of students. He has managed to
live Christianity in all phases of
life to a degree that is an inspira
tion to all of us who have seen
his good work, his near-perfect
human relations with his fellow
man.
All of us who have enjoyed and
benefited from the humanitarian
efforts of Dean Larimer will miss
him deeply.

lIONOK CODI<: WORKS
Editor, The Daily:
About a week ago I succeeded
in losing my billfold. Three days
later it was picked up on campus
and turned in to the Registrar's
Of lice, whence it made its way
back to me. I hardly need men
tion the trouble which would have
been involved in replacing the
many identification cards an
American male is expected to

keep on his person. Moreover,
the forty dollars I had been carry
ing in the billfold when 1 lost it
was still ihere when it was re
turned to me.
I'm fully aware, as a first-year
graduate student is expected to
be, of the dangers of generalizing
from a single case; but certainly
I have had a rather convincing
introduction to Stanford's honor
system.

About a week ago I succeeded

many identification cards an

keep on his person. Moreover,
the forty dollars I had been carry

MR. CALM A
(Editor's Note: It has re
cently come to the attention of
The Daily that Mr. Calma's
initial letter, dealing with wom
en's social regulations, had
been printed in a lengthier form
than the Daily permitted in a
publication circulating on cam
pus last year.
The Daily wishes (o maintain
a free forum for all readers,
but prefers that readers limit
themselves to issues currently
concerning them. There is no
need to "test" the Daily letters
policy. Letters do not neces
sarily refleet Daily policy; the
letters column is a free forum,
limited only by laws of libel
and obscenity, and available
spate.)
Editor, The Daily:
I read the letter- written by Mr.
Jacques Calma last week with
some degree of irritation, but his
latest epistle (The Daily, October
11) cannot, go unchallenged.
Mr. Calma asserts that the kind
of reputation which the Funda
mental Standard enjoins us Stan
ford students to preserve and
protect is a "very old and rotten
one." I believe that integrity and
honesty in both academic and
non-academic matters and in deal
ings with others are not at all
rotten; indeed, they are as much
a part; of the Fundamental Stand
ard as personal morality. -Fur
thermore, it is scarcely "obvious"
to me that the Fundamental
Standard "does not reflect stu
dent wishes" or "serve the stu
dents' interest." Mr. Calma's en
tire argument is based on the
fallacy that the interests of the
students and the Administration
are in complete opposition—how
can he postulate that the Admin
istration is here only to support
its own interests against those of
the students?
"The Administration curtails
every activity of moral import,
with the single exception of
smoking outside of class.' This
statement is indeed one of the
most illogical I have ever heard.
I doubt, Mr. Calma, that the Ad
ministration (which you seem to
equate with some kind of omni
present secret police) could do
much about it if you walked
down University Avenue in Palo
Alto and decided to shoot six
passers-by; perhaps you would
claim that this matter has no
moral import.
It seems that Mr. Calma envi
sions a group the size of the Stan
ford student body having no
"standards" at all except for
what is; is it not ludicrous to
deny that when part of a group,
each person has to give up some
of his individual wishes to pre
vent complete anarchy? Of
course, Mr. Calma doesn't state
his concept of the elusive ideal
which should be the norm for all
of us—l suspect his norm has no
ideal(s) behind it, that his norm
is whatever he feels like doing at
any given time. Just as he doesn't
accept the Administration's norm,
whv should it.(and we) accept
his?
The "rationale" behind the
Fundamental Standard is not as
vague as Mr. Calma thinks. I be
lieve I'm correct in saying that
every Stanford student accepts
the Fundamental Standard and
its rationale by his enrollment at
this university. Since Mr. Calma
does not desire to accept it in any
way, and since there is little like
lihood of its being abandoned
in toto by tomorrow morning, I
suggest that he cease committing
the error of following the double
standard of enrolling here and
not agreeing with the precepts of
enrollment and leave post haste,
repairing to some solitary en
vironment where no Administra
tion can regulate every matter of
moral import in his life.
—GEORGE R. HAMRDLA
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Calma's double volley
against the Fundamental Stand
ard and women's social regula
tions was notable for its vigor 1
and intensity.
We are interested. And we are
curious. Does Mr. Calma advo
cate the abolition of all official
standards and regulations in the
social governance of the univer
city? If so, we understand his
alternative to the Fundamental
Standard.
If not, we wonder to what ex
tent it might be proper to temper
social anarchy by regulation in
a private institution. And in what
terms might such regulations be
couched (no pun intended) in or
der to avoid the evil to which
Mr. Calma refers as "inhibition
of sexual behavior"? Perhaps fur
ther explanation of his position
would be helpful.
We would warn, however,
against the hasty assumption that
in all cases Stanford women don't

THE 'VOICE':
NOT WORTH A MARTYR
Editor, The Daily:
It appears to me, as perhaps it
does to a few other people, that
the situation of "The Campus
Voice" has become a bit ludicrous,
a lot of screaming and shouting
to a little end. The editors wish
to have the Voice distributed on
the Stanford campus as it is dis
tributed on every other college
campus in the Bay Area. The
Voice is distributed on campus,
quite legally, in the Union store,

but this is not the way the editors
are used to having their maga
zine distributed. They are no t
satisfied. They want a privilege
granted no other magazine in the
world with the exception of
ASSU sponsored publications, the
privilege of selling in the street.
I think they have a point of
a sort, but if they are in any
sense "right" it is not in a legal
sense. Legality rarely makes for
"rightness," never in a situation
such as this, a situation involv
ing interpretation of the concept
of "freedom." The "Campus
Voice" people, on the other hand,
are openly trying to get in trouble
in the expectation of winning a
case in the courts, and at th e
same time are capitalizing on
their daring. (A salesman, last
Monday, shouting, "Get your
'Campus Voice' before we're ar
rested!")
What we have is a classic sit
uation arousing a stock response,
a small group of people challeng
ing a larger group, a more power
ful group, David and Goliath, and
let's all cheer for the little fel
low, a great sitation for martyrs.
But, quite frankly, I, at least,
do not think the magazine is
worth all the fuss, all the hoarse
ness and exhaustion, all the emo
tion that some people are expend
ing on it. You can get your "Cam
pus Voice" if you want to, if you
are looking for a cause or are
curious. But the magazine is with
out a purpose, without a goal,
and it is not a forum, which
might justify a little of the noise.
On the front page, the cover,
just above the cartoon, you can
find this slogan: "militant,
thoughtful, sensitive." Militant
yes, of that I think there is no
doubt, though I am not so cer
tain that militancy is desirable,
but thoughtful, or sensitive? I
don't think so. But don't take my
word for it, read the Voice and
see. If you have a sense of pro
portion it's kind of fun. But don't
be taken in by the sensationalism,
either that in the magazine, or
that attendent on its distribution.
This cause is not worth a mar
tyr.

'PRO-CREATIVITY?"
Editor, The Daily:
Yesterday evening, between
study breaks, Ol' Eddie and Big
Jim were expressing their na
tural affection for two young
Stanford lovelies in our be
lovedi?) student union. Just as
things were starting to rock, we
were rudely interrupted by an ob
noxious young attendant in cat
sup-stained tunic with the absurd
request to empty our diminutive
ashtray. After painstakingly
rendering this small service (and
removing any potentially smoke
able butts from the tray), he
oozed away from out table to
disturb another Socratic gather
ing.
A bit disconcerted by all this,
we resumed our pursuit of spiri
tual culmination only to be fur
ther disturbed by a young lady
dancing by in an arousingly short
skirt. Our friends, we were
shocked. Our only consolation
was in the Socratic dictum, "Vir
tue is knowledge." The crowning
tragedy of the evening was a
rasping voice informing us that
the Union was "closed." Be as
sured. our friends, that there
could not have been a more effec
tive interruption of our line —
of thought. It was only with the
greatest difficulty that we were
able to revive our conversation,
later in the evening.
But why this tedious account of
our unfortunate experience? Our
friends, the Union is not pro crea
tive thought. It serves only as a
vile instrument for the abase
ment of our spiritual impulses,
the adulteration of our divine
souls, and the destruction of our
noblest aspirations. This former
ly beloved institution is in a sad
state indeed.
We only ask that, you, o u r
friends, reflect upon this matter
with diligence, and through the
medium of this honored news
paper, express your consequential
opinion, in the hope that this
coffeehouse may once again re
gain its for mer stature as a place
where the Western mind may
meet for learned discussion and

But why this tedious account of

About a week ago I succeeded

the forty dollars I had been carry

MR. CALM A
(Editor's Note: It has re
cently come to the attention of
The Daily that Mr. Calma's
initial letter, dealing with wom
en's social regulations, had
been printed in a lengthier form
than the Daily permitted in a
publication circulating on cam
pus last year.
The Daily wishes (o maintain
a free forum for all readers,
but prefers that readers limit
themselves to issues currently
concerning them. There is no
need to "test" the Daily letters
policy. Letters do not neces
sarily refleet Daily policy; the
letters column is a free forum,
limited only by laws of libel
and obscenity, and available
spate.)
Editor, The Daily:
I read the letter- written by Mr.
Jacques Calma last week with
some degree of irritation, but his
latest epistle (The Daily, October
11) cannot, go unchallenged.
Mr. Calma asserts that the kind
of reputation which the Funda
mental Standard enjoins us Stan
ford students to preserve and
protect is a "very old and rotten
one." I believe that integrity and
honesty in both academic and
non-academic matters and in deal
ings with others are not at all
rotten; indeed, they are as much
a part; of the Fundamental Stand
ard as personal morality. -Fur
thermore, it is scarcely "obvious"
to me that the Fundamental
Standard "does not reflect stu
dent wishes" or "serve the stu
dents' interest." Mr. Calma's en
tire argument is based on the
fallacy that the interests of the
students and the Administration
are in complete opposition—how
can he postulate that the Admin
istration is here only to support
its own interests against those of
the students?
"The Administration curtails
every activity of moral import,
with the single exception of
smoking outside of class.' This
statement is indeed one of the
most illogical I have ever heard.
I doubt, Mr. Calma, that the Ad
ministration (which you seem to
equate with some kind of omni
present secret police) could do
much about it if you walked
down University Avenue in Palo
Alto and decided to shoot six
passers-by; perhaps you would
claim that this matter has no
moral import.
It seems that Mr. Calma envi
sions a group the size of the Stan
ford student body having no
"standards" at all except for
what is; is it not ludicrous to
deny that when part of a group,
each person has to give up some
of his individual wishes to pre
vent complete anarchy? Of
course, Mr. Calma doesn't state
his concept of the elusive ideal
which should be the norm for all
of us—l suspect his norm has no
ideal(s) behind it, that his norm
is whatever he feels like doing at
any given time. Just as he doesn't
accept the Administration's norm,
whv should it.(and we) accept
his?
The "rationale" behind the
Fundamental Standard is not as
vague as Mr. Calma thinks. I be
lieve I'm correct in saying that
every Stanford student accepts
the Fundamental Standard and
its rationale by his enrollment at
this university. Since Mr. Calma
does not desire to accept it in any
way, and since there is little like
lihood of its being abandoned
in toto by tomorrow morning, I
suggest that he cease committing
the error of following the double
standard of enrolling here and
not agreeing with the precepts of
enrollment and leave post haste,
repairing to some solitary en
vironment where no Administra
tion can regulate every matter of
moral import in his life.
—GEORGE R. HAMRDLA
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Calma's double volley
against the Fundamental Stand
ard and women's social regula
tions was notable for its vigor 1
and intensity.
We are interested. And we are
curious. Does Mr. Calma advo
cate the abolition of all official
standards and regulations in the
social governance of the univer
city? If so, we understand his
alternative to the Fundamental
Standard.
If not, we wonder to what ex
tent it might be proper to temper
social anarchy by regulation in
a private institution. And in what
terms might such regulations be
couched (no pun intended) in or
der to avoid the evil to which
Mr. Calma refers as "inhibition
of sexual behavior"? Perhaps fur
ther explanation of his position
would be helpful.
We would warn, however,
against the hasty assumption that
in all cases Stanford women don't
only because t hey can't.

THE 'VOICE':
NOT WORTH A MARTYR
Editor, The Daily:
It appears to me, as perhaps it
does to a few other people, that
the situation of "The Campus
Voice" has become a bit ludicrous,
a lot of screaming and shouting
to a little end. The editors wish
to have the Voice distributed on
the Stanford campus as it is dis
tributed on every other college
campus in the Bay Area. The
Voice is distributed on campus,
quite legally, in the Union store,

but this is not the way the editors
are used to having their maga
zine distributed. They are no t
satisfied. They want a privilege
granted no other magazine in the
world with the exception of
ASSU sponsored publications, the
privilege of selling in the street.
I think they have a point of
a sort, but if they are in any
sense "right" it is not in a legal
sense. Legality rarely makes for
"rightness," never in a situation
such as this, a situation involv
ing interpretation of the concept
of "freedom." The "Campus
Voice" people, on the other hand,
are openly trying to get in trouble
in the expectation of winning a
case in the courts, and at th e
same time are capitalizing on
their daring. (A salesman, last
Monday, shouting, "Get your
'Campus Voice' before we're ar
rested!")
What we have is a classic sit
uation arousing a stock response,
a small group of people challeng
ing a larger group, a more power
ful group, David and Goliath, and
let's all cheer for the little fel
low, a great sitation for martyrs.
But, quite frankly, I, at least,
do not think the magazine is
worth all the fuss, all the hoarse
ness and exhaustion, all the emo
tion that some people are expend
ing on it. You can get your "Cam
pus Voice" if you want to, if you
are looking for a cause or are
curious. But the magazine is with
out a purpose, without a goal,
and it is not a forum, which
might justify a little of the noise.
On the front page, the cover,
just above the cartoon, you can
find this slogan: "militant,
thoughtful, sensitive." Militant
yes, of that I think there is no
doubt, though I am not so cer
tain that militancy is desirable,
but thoughtful, or sensitive? I
don't think so. But don't take my
word for it, read the Voice and
see. If you have a sense of pro
portion it's kind of fun. But don't
be taken in by the sensationalism,
either that in the magazine, or
that attendent on its distribution.
This cause is not worth a mar
tyr.

yes, of that I think there is no

TRESIDDER:
'PRO-CREATIVITY?"
Editor, The Daily:
Yesterday evening, between
study breaks, Ol' Eddie and Big
Jim were expressing their na
tural affection for two young
Stanford lovelies in our be
lovedi?) student union. Just as
things were starting to rock, we
were rudely interrupted by an ob
noxious young attendant in cat
sup-stained tunic with the absurd
request to empty our diminutive
ashtray. After painstakingly
rendering this small service (and
removing any potentially smoke
able butts from the tray), he
oozed away from out table to
disturb another Socratic gather
ing.
A bit disconcerted by all this,
we resumed our pursuit of spiri
tual culmination only to be fur
ther disturbed by a young lady
dancing by in an arousingly short
skirt. Our friends, we were
shocked. Our only consolation
was in the Socratic dictum, "Vir
tue is knowledge." The crowning
tragedy of the evening was a
rasping voice informing us that
the Union was "closed." Be as
sured. our friends, that there
could not have been a more effec
tive interruption of our line —
of thought. It was only with the
greatest difficulty that we were
able to revive our conversation,
later in the evening.
But why this tedious account of
our unfortunate experience? Our
friends, the Union is not pro crea
tive thought. It serves only as a
vile instrument for the abase
ment of our spiritual impulses,
the adulteration of our divine
souls, and the destruction of our
noblest aspirations. This former
ly beloved institution is in a sad
state indeed.
We only ask that, you, o u r

with diligence, and through the
medium of this honored news
paper, express your consequential
opinion, in the hope that this
coffeehouse may once again re
gain its for mer stature as a place
where the Western mind may
meet for learned discussion and

MR. CALM A
(Editor's Note: It has re
cently come to the attention of
The Daily that Mr. Calma's
initial letter, dealing with wom
en's social regulations, had
been printed in a lengthier form
than the Daily permitted in a
publication circulating on cam
pus last year.
The Daily wishes (o maintain
a free forum for all readers,
but prefers that readers limit
themselves to issues currently
concerning them. There is no
need to "test" the Daily letters
policy. Letters do not neces
sarily refleet Daily policy; the
letters column is a free forum,
limited only by laws of libel
and obscenity, and available
spate.)
Editor, The Daily:
I read the letter- written by Mr.
Jacques Calma last week with
some degree of irritation, but his
latest epistle (The Daily, October
11) cannot, go unchallenged.
Mr. Calma asserts that the kind
of reputation which the Funda
mental Standard enjoins us Stan
ford students to preserve and
protect is a "very old and rotten
one." I believe that integrity and
honesty in both academic and
non-academic matters and in deal
ings with others are not at all
rotten; indeed, they are as much
a part; of the Fundamental Stand
ard as personal morality. -Fur
thermore, it is scarcely "obvious"
to me that the Fundamental
Standard "does not reflect stu
dent wishes" or "serve the stu
dents' interest." Mr. Calma's en
tire argument is based on the
fallacy that the interests of the
students and the Administration
are in complete opposition—how
can he postulate that the Admin
istration is here only to support
its own interests against those of
the students?
"The Administration curtails
every activity of moral import,
with the single exception of
smoking outside of class.' This
statement is indeed one of the
most illogical I have ever heard.
I doubt, Mr. Calma, that the Ad
ministration (which you seem to
equate with some kind of omni
present secret police) could do
much about it if you walked
down University Avenue in Palo
Alto and decided to shoot six
passers-by; perhaps you would
claim that this matter has no
moral import.
It seems that Mr. Calma envi
sions a group the size of the Stan
ford student body having no
"standards" at all except for
what is; is it not ludicrous to
deny that when part of a group,
each person has to give up some
of his individual wishes to pre
vent complete anarchy? Of
course, Mr. Calma doesn't state
his concept of the elusive ideal
which should be the norm for all
of us—l suspect his norm has no
ideal(s) behind it, that his norm
is whatever he feels like doing at
any given time. Just as he doesn't
accept the Administration's norm,
whv should it.(and we) accept
his?
The "rationale" behind the
Fundamental Standard is not as
vague as Mr. Calma thinks. I be
lieve I'm correct in saying that
every Stanford student accepts
the Fundamental Standard and
its rationale by his enrollment at
this university. Since Mr. Calma
does not desire to accept it in any
way, and since there is little like
lihood of its being abandoned
in toto by tomorrow morning, I
suggest that he cease committing
the error of following the double
standard of enrolling here and
not agreeing with the precepts of
enrollment and leave post haste,
repairing to some solitary en
vironment where no Administra
tion can regulate every matter of
moral import in his life.
—GEORGE R. HAMRDLA
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Calma's double volley
against the Fundamental Stand
ard and women's social regula
tions was notable for its vigor 1
and intensity.
We are interested. And we are
curious. Does Mr. Calma advo
cate the abolition of all official
standards and regulations in the
social governance of the univer
city? If so, we understand his
alternative to the Fundamental
Standard.
If not, we wonder to what ex
tent it might be proper to temper
social anarchy by regulation in
a private institution. And in what
terms might such regulations be
couched (no pun intended) in or
der to avoid the evil to which
Mr. Calma refers as "inhibition
of sexual behavior"? Perhaps fur
ther explanation of his position
would be helpful.
We would warn, however,
against the hasty assumption that
in all cases Stanford women don't
only because t hey can't.

THE 'VOICE':
NOT WORTH A MARTYR
Editor, The Daily:
It appears to me, as perhaps it
does to a few other people, that
the situation of "The Campus
Voice" has become a bit ludicrous,
a lot of screaming and shouting
to a little end. The editors wish
to have the Voice distributed on
the Stanford campus as it is dis
tributed on every other college
campus in the Bay Area. The
Voice is distributed on campus,
quite legally, in the Union store,

but this is not the way the editors
are used to having their maga
zine distributed. They are no t
satisfied. They want a privilege
granted no other magazine in the
world with the exception of
ASSU sponsored publications, the
privilege of selling in the street.
I think they have a point of
a sort, but if they are in any
sense "right" it is not in a legal
sense. Legality rarely makes for
"rightness," never in a situation
such as this, a situation involv
ing interpretation of the concept
of "freedom." The "Campus
Voice" people, on the other hand,
are openly trying to get in trouble
in the expectation of winning a
case in the courts, and at th e
same time are capitalizing on
their daring. (A salesman, last
Monday, shouting, "Get your
'Campus Voice' before we're ar
rested!")
What we have is a classic sit
uation arousing a stock response,
a small group of people challeng
ing a larger group, a more power
ful group, David and Goliath, and
let's all cheer for the little fel
low, a great sitation for martyrs.
But, quite frankly, I, at least,
do not think the magazine is
worth all the fuss, all the hoarse
ness and exhaustion, all the emo
tion that some people are expend
ing on it. You can get your "Cam
pus Voice" if you want to, if you
are looking for a cause or are
curious. But the magazine is with
out a purpose, without a goal,
and it is not a forum, which

to have the Voice distributed on
the Stanford campus as it is dis
tributed on every other college
campus in the Bay Area. The
Voice is distributed on campus,
quite legally, in the Union store,

but this is not the way the editors
are used to having their maga
zine distributed. They are no t
satisfied. They want a privilege
granted no other magazine in the
world with the exception of
ASSU sponsored publications, the
privilege of selling in the street.
I think they have a point of
a sort, but if they are in any
sense "right" it is not in a legal
sense. Legality rarely makes for
"rightness," never in a situation
such as this, a situation involv
ing interpretation of the concept
of "freedom." The "Campus
Voice" people, on the other hand,
are openly trying to get in trouble
in the expectation of winning a
case in the courts, and at th e
same time are capitalizing on
their daring. (A salesman, last
Monday, shouting, "Get your
'Campus Voice' before we're ar
rested!")
What we have is a classic sit
uation arousing a stock response,
a small group of people challeng
ing a larger group, a more power
ful group, David and Goliath, and
let's all cheer for the little fel
low, a great sitation for martyrs.
But, quite frankly, I, at least,
do not think the magazine is
worth all the fuss, all the hoarse
ness and exhaustion, all the emo
tion that some people are expend
ing on it. You can get your "Cam
pus Voice" if you want to, if you
are looking for a cause or are
curious. But the magazine is with
out a purpose, without a goal,
and it is not a forum, which
might justify a little of the noise.
On the front page, the cover,
just above the cartoon, you can
find this slogan: "militant,
thoughtful, sensitive." Militant
yes, of that I think there is no
doubt, though I am not so cer
tain that militancy is desirable,
but thoughtful, or sensitive? I
don't think so. But don't take my
word for it, read the Voice and
see. If you have a sense of pro
portion it's kind of fun. But don't
be taken in by the sensationalism,
either that in the magazine, or
that attendent on its distribution.
This cause is not worth a mar

'PRO-CREATIVITY?"
Editor, The Daily:
Yesterday evening, between
study breaks, Ol' Eddie and Big
Jim were expressing their na
tural affection for two young
Stanford lovelies in our be
lovedi?) student union. Just as
things were starting to rock, we
were rudely interrupted by an ob
noxious young attendant in cat
sup-stained tunic with the absurd
request to empty our diminutive
ashtray. After painstakingly
rendering this small service (and
removing any potentially smoke
able butts from the tray), he
oozed away from out table to
disturb another Socratic gather
ing.
A bit disconcerted by all this,
we resumed our pursuit of spiri
tual culmination only to be fur
ther disturbed by a young lady
dancing by in an arousingly short
skirt. Our friends, we were
shocked. Our only consolation
was in the Socratic dictum, "Vir
tue is knowledge." The crowning
tragedy of the evening was a
rasping voice informing us that
the Union was "closed." Be as
sured. our friends, that there
could not have been a more effec
tive interruption of our line —
of thought. It was only with the
greatest difficulty that we were
able to revive our conversation,
later in the evening.
But why this tedious account of
our unfortunate experience? Our
friends, the Union is not pro crea
tive thought. It serves only as a
vile instrument for the abase
ment of our spiritual impulses,
the adulteration of our divine
souls, and the destruction of our
noblest aspirations. This former
ly beloved institution is in a sad
state indeed.
We only ask that, you, o u r

with diligence, and through the
medium of this honored news
paper, express your consequential
opinion, in the hope that this
coffeehouse may once again re
gain its for mer stature as a place
where the Western mind may
meet for learned discussion and

MR. CALM A
(Editor's Note: It has re
cently come to the attention of
The Daily that Mr. Calma's
initial letter, dealing with wom
en's social regulations, had
been printed in a lengthier form
than the Daily permitted in a
publication circulating on cam
pus last year.
The Daily wishes (o maintain
a free forum for all readers,
but prefers that readers limit
themselves to issues currently
concerning them. There is no
need to "test" the Daily letters
policy. Letters do not neces
sarily refleet Daily policy; the
letters column is a free forum,
limited only by laws of libel
and obscenity, and available
spate.)
Editor, The Daily:
I read the letter- written by Mr.
Jacques Calma last week with
some degree of irritation, but his
latest epistle (The Daily, October
11) cannot, go unchallenged.
Mr. Calma asserts that the kind
of reputation which the Funda
mental Standard enjoins us Stan
ford students to preserve and
protect is a "very old and rotten
one." I believe that integrity and
honesty in both academic and
non-academic matters and in deal
ings with others are not at all
rotten; indeed, they are as much
a part; of the Fundamental Stand
ard as personal morality. -Fur
thermore, it is scarcely "obvious"
to me that the Fundamental
Standard "does not reflect stu
dent wishes" or "serve the stu
dents' interest." Mr. Calma's en
tire argument is based on the
fallacy that the interests of the
students and the Administration
are in complete opposition—how
can he postulate that the Admin
istration is here only to support
its own interests against those of
the students?
"The Administration curtails
every activity of moral import,
with the single exception of
smoking outside of class.' This
statement is indeed one of the
most illogical I have ever heard.
I doubt, Mr. Calma, that the Ad
ministration (which you seem to
equate with some kind of omni
present secret police) could do
much about it if you walked
down University Avenue in Palo
Alto and decided to shoot six
passers-by; perhaps you would
claim that this matter has no
moral import.
It seems that Mr. Calma envi
sions a group the size of the Stan
ford student body having no
"standards" at all except for
what is; is it not ludicrous to
deny that when part of a group,
each person has to give up some
of his individual wishes to pre
vent complete anarchy? Of
course, Mr. Calma doesn't state
his concept of the elusive ideal
which should be the norm for all
of us—l suspect his norm has no
ideal(s) behind it, that his norm
is whatever he feels like doing at
any given time. Just as he doesn't
accept the Administration's norm,
whv should it.(and we) accept
his?
The "rationale" behind the
Fundamental Standard is not as
vague as Mr. Calma thinks. I be
lieve I'm correct in saying that
every Stanford student accepts
the Fundamental Standard and
its rationale by his enrollment at
this university. Since Mr. Calma
does not desire to accept it in any
way, and since there is little like
lihood of its being abandoned
in toto by tomorrow morning, I
suggest that he cease committing
the error of following the double
standard of enrolling here and
not agreeing with the precepts of
enrollment and leave post haste,
repairing to some solitary en
vironment where no Administra
tion can regulate every matter of
moral import in his life.
—GEORGE R. HAMRDLA
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Calma's double volley
against the Fundamental Stand
ard and women's social regula
tions was notable for its vigor 1
and intensity.
We are interested. And we are
curious. Does Mr. Calma advo
cate the abolition of all official
standards and regulations in the
social governance of the univer
city? If so, we understand his
alternative to the Fundamental
Standard.
If not, we wonder to what ex
tent it might be proper to temper
social anarchy by regulation in
a private institution. And in what
terms might such regulations be
couched (no pun intended) in or
der to avoid the evil to which
Mr. Calma refers as "inhibition
of sexual behavior"? Perhaps fur
ther explanation of his position
would be helpful.
We would warn, however,
against the hasty assumption that
in all cases Stanford women don't
only because t hey can't.

THE 'VOICE':
NOT WORTH A MARTYR
Editor, The Daily:
It appears to me, as perhaps it
does to a few other people, that
the situation of "The Campus
Voice" has become a bit ludicrous,
a lot of screaming and shouting
to a little end. The editors wish
to have the Voice distributed on
the Stanford campus as it is dis
tributed on every other college
campus in the Bay Area. The
Voice is distributed on campus,
quite legally, in the Union store,

but this is not the way the editors
are used to having their maga
zine distributed. They are no t
satisfied. They want a privilege
granted no other magazine in the
world with the exception of
ASSU sponsored publications, the
privilege of selling in the street.
I think they have a point of
a sort, but if they are in any
sense "right" it is not in a legal
sense. Legality rarely makes for
"rightness," never in a situation
such as this, a situation involv
ing interpretation of the concept
of "freedom." The "Campus
Voice" people, on the other hand,
are openly trying to get in trouble
in the expectation of winning a
case in the courts, and at th e
same time are capitalizing on
their daring. (A salesman, last
Monday, shouting, "Get your
'Campus Voice' before we're ar
rested!")
What we have is a classic sit
uation arousing a stock response,
a small group of people challeng
ing a larger group, a more power
ful group, David and Goliath, and
let's all cheer for the little fel
low, a great sitation for martyrs.
But, quite frankly, I, at least,
do not think the magazine is
worth all the fuss, all the hoarse
ness and exhaustion, all the emo
tion that some people are expend
ing on it. You can get your "Cam
pus Voice" if you want to, if you
are looking for a cause or are
curious. But the magazine is with
out a purpose, without a goal,
and it is not a forum, which
might justify a little of the noise.
On the front page, the cover,
just above the cartoon, you can
find this slogan: "militant,
thoughtful, sensitive." Militant
yes, of that I think there is no
doubt, though I am not so cer
tain that militancy is desirable,
but thoughtful, or sensitive? I
don't think so. But don't take my
word for it, read the Voice and
see. If you have a sense of pro
portion it's kind of fun. But don't
be taken in by the sensationalism,
either that in the magazine, or
that attendent on its distribution.
This cause is not worth a mar
tyr.

TRESIDDER:
'PRO-CREATIVITY?"
Editor, The Daily:
Yesterday evening, between
study breaks, Ol' Eddie and Big
Jim were expressing their na
tural affection for two young
Stanford lovelies in our be
lovedi?) student union. Just as
things were starting to rock, we
were rudely interrupted by an ob
noxious young attendant in cat
sup-stained tunic with the absurd
request to empty our diminutive
ashtray. After painstakingly
rendering this small service (and
removing any potentially smoke
able butts from the tray), he
oozed away from out table to
disturb another Socratic gather
ing.
A bit disconcerted by all this,
we resumed our pursuit of spiri
tual culmination only to be fur
ther disturbed by a young lady
dancing by in an arousingly short
skirt. Our friends, we were
shocked. Our only consolation
was in the Socratic dictum, "Vir
tue is knowledge." The crowning
tragedy of the evening was a
rasping voice informing us that
the Union was "closed." Be as
sured. our friends, that there
could not have been a more effec
tive interruption of our line —
of thought. It was only with the
greatest difficulty that we were
able to revive our conversation,
later in the evening.
But why this tedious account of
our unfortunate experience? Our
friends, the Union is not pro crea
tive thought. It serves only as a
vile instrument for the abase
ment of our spiritual impulses,
the adulteration of our divine
souls, and the destruction of our
noblest aspirations. This former

state indeed.
We only ask that, you, o u r

with diligence, and through the

opinion, in the hope that this

gain its for mer stature as a place

MR. CALM A
(Editor's Note: It has re
cently come to the attention of
The Daily that Mr. Calma's
initial letter, dealing with wom
en's social regulations, had
been printed in a lengthier form
than the Daily permitted in a
publication circulating on cam
pus last year.
The Daily wishes (o maintain
a free forum for all readers,
but prefers that readers limit
themselves to issues currently
concerning them. There is no
need to "test" the Daily letters
policy. Letters do not neces
sarily refleet Daily policy; the
letters column is a free forum,
limited only by laws of libel
and obscenity, and available
spate.)
Editor, The Daily:
I read the letter- written by Mr.
Jacques Calma last week with
some degree of irritation, but his
latest epistle (The Daily, October
11) cannot, go unchallenged.
Mr. Calma asserts that the kind
of reputation which the Funda
mental Standard enjoins us Stan
ford students to preserve and
protect is a "very old and rotten
one." I believe that integrity and
honesty in both academic and
non-academic matters and in deal
ings with others are not at all
rotten; indeed, they are as much
a part; of the Fundamental Stand
ard as personal morality. -Fur
thermore, it is scarcely "obvious"
to me that the Fundamental
Standard "does not reflect stu
dent wishes" or "serve the stu
dents' interest." Mr. Calma's en
tire argument is based on the
fallacy that the interests of the
students and the Administration
are in complete opposition—how
can he postulate that the Admin
istration is here only to support
its own interests against those of
the students?
"The Administration curtails
every activity of moral import,
with the single exception of
smoking outside of class.' This
statement is indeed one of the
most illogical I have ever heard.
I doubt, Mr. Calma, that the Ad
ministration (which you seem to
equate with some kind of omni
present secret police) could do
much about it if you walked
down University Avenue in Palo
Alto and decided to shoot six
passers-by; perhaps you would
claim that this matter has no
moral import.
It seems that Mr. Calma envi
sions a group the size of the Stan
ford student body having no
"standards" at all except for
what is; is it not ludicrous to
deny that when part of a group,
each person has to give up some
of his individual wishes to pre
vent complete anarchy? Of
course, Mr. Calma doesn't state
his concept of the elusive ideal
which should be the norm for all
of us—l suspect his norm has no
ideal(s) behind it, that his norm
is whatever he feels like doing at
any given time. Just as he doesn't
accept the Administration's norm,
whv should it.(and we) accept
his?
The "rationale" behind the
Fundamental Standard is not as
vague as Mr. Calma thinks. I be
lieve I'm correct in saying that
every Stanford student accepts
the Fundamental Standard and
its rationale by his enrollment at
this university. Since Mr. Calma
does not desire to accept it in any
way, and since there is little like
lihood of its being abandoned
in toto by tomorrow morning, I
suggest that he cease committing
the error of following the double
standard of enrolling here and
not agreeing with the precepts of
enrollment and leave post haste,
repairing to some solitary en
vironment where no Administra
tion can regulate every matter of
moral import in his life.
