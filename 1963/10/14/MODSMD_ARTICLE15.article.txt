# Vermin Ermine Supports The Stanford 'T.A.' System

Vermin Ermine Hickenlooper is distraught. Like all doctoral can
didates, he is feeling a hit queasy in the vocal cords. His orals are
coming up. Perhaps Ermine is more distraught than most and with
good reason.
Since he received BA's in philosophy, art, history and economics
with a minor in petroleum geology, and assorted Master's degrees
in animal husbandry, Greek and municipal drainage (a Stanford
specialty), one can see how his grasp of petrography might be a
bit below the high standard of excellence demanded by Stanford's
outstanding petrography department.
UNABLE TO loose his frustration in constructive activity (for
bidden by IGNORE), he has turned to the defiance of authority.
Indeed, at this moment he is scandalously rifling his bicycle under
the arcaves of Inner Quad, smoking a cigarette, and playing ;Â« fus
ing Baptist hymn on his Haleel (recorder).
Passing in front of Mem Chu, he slows down a little to admire
its supple grace, ethereal beauty and simple charm. "Ch for the
Gothic spire that once embellished this neo-Franciscan-Byzantine
heap!" he titters. Before he gets a chance to turn his he.id away,
he finds himself gazing into the splendid opulence of roon 61-H.
What he sees jolts him from this delirium of joyful defian-e. He
slams on the brakes, laying a thick, black smudge through the
classes of '10 through '37 inclusive, and scurries back lo ha v <> an
other look.
There in the classroom are two people: one is copying from a
book onto the blackboard; the other, asleep in the first row, is
Wilmer K. Flemm. Vermin Ermine notes that it is ten after nine,
sneaks into the room and awakens Wilmer.
Vermine Ermine: Wake up, Wilmer!
Willmer: Uh . . . er .. . uh . . . would you please l-epeat the ques
tion?
Vermine Ermine: No, no. It's me Ermine.
Wilmer: Uh . . . cosecant theta . . . er . . . uh . . . cosine
. . . no, arc tan squared . . . uh . . f of x . . . uh . . .
Vermine Ermine: It's ten after. Is this class over or starting?
T.A. Ten after? Oh, I must have missed the bell. Well, we'll
stop hero for the day. Urn, I'll give tomorrow's assignment, next
time. Uh, one other thing ... no office hours next week. Er . . .
uh . . . test Friday on all previous material.
The T.A. walks out. Wilmer begins to stir.
Vermin Ermine: Who was that, and where is everyone else?
Wilmer: That was my math T.A., Mr. Rech. It was my turn to
come to class today, but I fell asleep. I was supposed to get the
assignment for the others. Did you hear anything about it?
Vermin Ermine: This is ridiculous. Why don't you transfer out of
this section?
Wilmer: I've already transferred twice. My first T.A. didn't
speak English, and the second had to break up the class when he
discovered that he hadn't taken this course yet. This one's a real
find. Were you ever a T.A., Ermine?
Vermin Ermine: Was I ever a T.A.! History 1, Logic and Bio
were a few. I also led a seminar in mosaic repair under a transcept
in Mem Chu.
Wilmer: What does T.A. stand for?
Vermin Ermine: Terman's Anomalies.
Wilmer: Why don't they get rid of them?
Ermine: What! Throw out the greatest breakthrough in educa
tion since erector sets! This sterling conception set the pace in the
emancipation of the teaching profession from the drudgery of the
classroom. Now they can devote themselves to public relations and
research, the two overwhelming ends of an educational institution.
Wilmer. Gee willikers, how can so few do so lit lie so often to
so many? And if the 250,000 PACE door-to-door volunteers do their
iob, this great program could be doubled.
