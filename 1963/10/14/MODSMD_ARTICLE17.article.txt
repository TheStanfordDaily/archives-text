# Frosh Back fields Shine In 53-0 Santa Clara Rout
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
Stanford's frosh football team,
opening its season on a blight
note, ran for 53 points around
and through an undermanned
Santa Clara J.V. squad which
acted more as a fall guy than an
opponent at Stanford Stadium
Saturday morning.
Coach Walsh, satisfied with the
game, credits it with giving hi s
players a lot of experience. But
he was worried about the large
amount of mistakes made.
PLAYERS singled out by Walsh
for their outstanding play were
halfbacks Don Leydig and Bruce
Lytic, quarterback, Flick Bian
china, and fullback John Read.
Don Leydig led the Card runners
with 86 yards on fi attempts. Full
backs Bill Ostrander and John
Read were a distant second and
third.
Offensive power was evident
from the beginning. Bob Blunt re
ceived a Santa Clara punt on the
Trib'e 37 in the opening minutes
of play. He followed a wall of
blockers down the left side-line
most of the way and then cut and
spun the last 20 yards on his own
to reach the end zone.
Given a chance to operate, the
second unit showed its stuff. Con
tinuing the halfback hoedown,
Don Leydig's and Greg Ford's
footwork accounted for most of
the 90 yards in Stanford's second
successful drive.
DON LEYDIG came up with
the big gainer of the series. Be
ginning near midfield. he went
over left guard, cut right after
fighting his way into the secon
dary, and had to be brought down
from behind on the 19 yard line.
Leydig powered the final 6 yards
over the middle to culminate the
drive.
On the attack again after a
Cameron interception, Stanford
quickly covered 32 yards in 5
plays for another TD. The two
key plays were Dave Lewis to
Bob Oar aerials along the left
sideline, the first good for seven
yards, the second for 21 yards
and 6 points.
Only minutes later, the alert
Stanford line pounced on a Santa
Clara fumble at the Bronc 38. A
John Propstra-Larry Hansen con
nection netted 20 yards. Cameron
scampered around left end for
the final 13 yards several plays
later.
PUSHING THE halftime mar
gin to 38-0, end Doug Montgom
ery picked off a short Santa Clara
pass and did a nifty bit of run
ning to end up with the ball in
the end zone.

Stanford did not get on the
scoreboard in the second half un
til Bill Ostronder crossed the goal
line from three yards out with
but four minutes remaining in
the game. Bruce Lytle, small but
quick, completed the scoring of
the one-sided game with a 15 yard
run around right end.
Stanford's defense had Santa
Clara runners under lock and key
as they netted a minus 25 yards
on 20 efforts. Before Santa Clara
had gained a first down, the
Cards had 22 points.
