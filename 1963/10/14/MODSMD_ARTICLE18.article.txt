### TOM ELIAS 
Stanford's cross-country team
turned in a disappointing per
formance Satui'day in the Sacra
mento State Invitational, placing
second behind San Jose State's
defending national champions.
In what their coach, Pay ton
Jordan, termed "a fairly good
performance for this early in the
season," the Indians rang up a 59
point total against only 21 for
San Jose. Lowest total wins in
a cross country meet. The Tribe
was followed in the final results
by Cal with 96.
THE OUTSTANDING individ
ual peiformance for Stanford
was turned in by Harry McCalla
who covered the 3.5 mile course
in 18:15 to take second place be
hind Spartan Jeff Fishback. but
ahead of Danny Murphy, third in
the nation for San Jose last sea
son.
Other good performances were
turned in for Stanford by Paul
Schlicke in tenth place, Bill
Pratt in 12th, Jim Puible 14th and
Roy Andrews 17th.
Prime disappointment for In
dian followers was the 22nd place
finish of Dave Deubner, who has
been running even with McCalla
all through practice. Coach Jor
dan indicated that he is looking
for considerable improvement
from Deubner as the runner is
actually in prime condition.
STANFORD, SAID J or d a ft,
"must improve considerably or
we will never beat San Jose. We
have a better team man for man
than San Jose, but have not yet
proved it and won't until the boys
are willing to put out like they
do."
Next meet on the Stanford
schedule is a triangular against
UCLA and Cal. either on the Stan
ford course or at Berkeley.
