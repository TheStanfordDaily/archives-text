# Malaya U. To Remain Unaltered

### SHEILA RICKETTS 
The formation of the Federa
tion of Malaysia will have no im
mediate impact upon the Univer
sity of Malaya, Dr. Wa/ir Pallie,
Professor of Anatomy at the uni
versity, stated to The Daily.
Dr. Pallie felt, however, that
the University would bo indi
rectly affected by the added em
phasis on defense in the face of
the Indonesian opposition to the
Federation.
"TIIE UNIVERSITY of Malaya
is a state university which de
rives its funds from the govern
ment budget. If the government
becomes more involved in de
fense, funds will be restricted,"
he explained.
Pallie stayed in the Florence
Moore questroom from Wednes
day to Sunday of last week, while
he visited the Stanford Medical
School. He is traveling around
the world on a trip that will in
clude visits to medical schools in
such widespread places as Aus
tralia, the U.S., Britain and Leba
non.
WHEN ASKED about the re
lations between his university
and the state university in Singa
pore, Pallie explained that there
was already a great deal of co
operation between the two insti
tutions even before the formation
of the Federation, since the
school in Kuala Lumpur budded
off from the one in Singapore.
By the large the staff and the
student body of the university
are Chinese, said Pallie. He then
elaborated on this phase of the
somewhat strained Chinese-Malay
relations in the Federation: "Ma
lays have the political majority
by a very thin margin, but the
Chinese predominate because the
Malays, from the nature of their
villages, are used to a rural
rather than urban existence."
"But the government is aiding
the development of the Malays
in rural areas by such measures
as the improvement of the village
schools."
