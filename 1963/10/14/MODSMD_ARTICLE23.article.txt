# San Antonio Span Repairs to Begin
## 
### 
The San Antonio Bridge located
behind Lake Lagunita will be
closed for the next three weeks.
Menlo Park Police issued this
statement last night, announcing
that workmen will be repairing
the bridge and alternate routes
must be planned for commuters
who travel between Menlo Park
and Stanford. Alternate route
suggested include going through
the Stanford Shopping Center to
Palo Alto, or up Alpine Road to
Arastradero and following Aras
tradero to Page Mill Road.
