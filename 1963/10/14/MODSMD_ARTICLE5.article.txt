# Unity Called Essential for Atlantic Community

### BILL SMITH Contributing Editor 
! "There is no future for anybody
: without a recognition of the unity
j of the Atlantic Community,"
I Prince Hubert us Zu Lowenstein
said in a speech in the large
! Lounge of Tresidder last Friday.
Lowenstein, German historian
and politician, said, "This is t lie
I real nationalism. If you really
love your country, which you
| should, then you must dedicate
j yourself to a community of free
I peoples."
"A new fundamental belief in
| in tiie dignity of man has grown
! up" in Germany since the war, he
| said. "Freedom is neither Ger
man nor French nor American,
J but human and indivisible and
! this is the great lesson of these
years."
Lowenstein was a member of
the Reichstag in the early 1930's
and fled Germany soon after Hit
: ler's rise to power. During hi s
! years of exile, he taught in the
United States at Carnegie Insti-
I tute. In 194(3, he returned to Ger

many to help in reconstruction.
When he returned to Bremen,
Lowenstein was shocked by "the
complete destruction and com
plete disorganization, the millions
of refugees pouring west from
the cast, no government but a
military government and the
country divided into four air tight
j compartments."
"Many experts felt it might
1 take 50-100 years to reconstruct
i Germany," Lowenstein said.
"But by the end of 1916, free
elections were being held in the
! counties in the West, and to al-
I most everyone's surprise, over
i 95 percent of the people used
! their restored rights," he said.
"In October 1046 a landmark
! was reached," Lowenstein said.
! "A general election was held in
greater Berlin and in spite of ex
tensive propaganda efforts by the
Russians, only 26 Russian backed
| candidates were elected out of 130
i deputies in Hie parliament."
"The result was that there has
never been a free, universal suf-
I frage election east of the border
! since then," he said. "The fact
I that the proletariate of Berlin

would not vote Communist, as
Marxist-Leninist theory said they
would, has resounded around the
globe."
"Solvency was not restored to
Germany until 1955, but the Mar
shall plan started it and th e
Schumann plan of 1951-52 laid
the foundation of the Coal and
Steel Community and complete
economic recovery," he said.
"Reconstruction of Germany
came about because the peoples
of the Atlantic Community recog
nized their oneness their super
nationalism," L o we n s t c in
claimed.
But there was another factor
aiding Western German recon
struction, Lowenstein noted, a
factor not present in the East.
"Their democratic rights (the
West German's) have allowed
them to rebuild their cities," Low
enstein said. "Because the moral
elements present in democracy
have been lacking in the East,
the German people there — who !
ai-e not less industrious nor more !
lazy than those in the West —
have not been able to rebuild i
their society."

"Reconstruction of Germany
came about because the peoples
of the Atlantic Community recog
nized their oneness their super
nationalism," L o we n s t c in
claimed.
But there was another factor
aiding Western German recon
struction, Lowenstein noted, a
factor not present in the East.
"Their democratic rights (the
West German's) have allowed
them to rebuild their cities," Low
enstein said. "Because the moral
elements present in democracy
have been lacking in the East,
the German people there — who !
ai-e not less industrious nor more !
lazy than those in the West —
have not been able to rebuild i
their society."
! "There is no future for anybody
: without a recognition of the unity
j of the Atlantic Community,"
I Prince Hubert us Zu Lowenstein
said in a speech in the large
! Lounge of Tresidder last Friday.
Lowenstein, German historian
and politician, said, "This is t lie
I real nationalism. If you really
love your country, which you
| should, then you must dedicate
j yourself to a community of free
I peoples."
"A new fundamental belief in
| in tiie dignity of man has grown
! up" in Germany since the war, he
| said. "Freedom is neither Ger
man nor French nor American,
J but human and indivisible and
! this is the great lesson of these
years."
Lowenstein was a member of
the Reichstag in the early 1930's
and fled Germany soon after Hit
: ler's rise to power. During hi s
! years of exile, he taught in the
United States at Carnegie Insti-
I tute. In 194(3, he returned to Ger

many to help in reconstruction.
When he returned to Bremen,
Lowenstein was shocked by "the
complete destruction and com
plete disorganization, the millions
of refugees pouring west from
the cast, no government but a
military government and the
country divided into four air tight
j compartments."
"Many experts felt it might
1 take 50-100 years to reconstruct
i Germany," Lowenstein said.
"But by the end of 1916, free
elections were being held in the
! counties in the West, and to al-
I most everyone's surprise, over
i 95 percent of the people used
! their restored rights," he said.
"In October 1046 a landmark
! was reached," Lowenstein said.
! "A general election was held in
greater Berlin and in spite of ex
tensive propaganda efforts by the
Russians, only 26 Russian backed
| candidates were elected out of 130
i deputies in Hie parliament."
"The result was that there has
never been a free, universal suf-
I frage election east of the border
! since then," he said. "The fact
I that the proletariate of Berlin

would not vote Communist, as
Marxist-Leninist theory said they
would, has resounded around the
globe."
"Solvency was not restored to
Germany until 1955, but the Mar
shall plan started it and th e
Schumann plan of 1951-52 laid
