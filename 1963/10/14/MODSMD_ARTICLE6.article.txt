### CATHY PIKE 
One purpose of the Peace Corps
in Colombia, according to Stan
ford graduate student Jack
Coombs a member of the Peace
Corps in La Plata, September
1961 to June 1963, is to encourage
self-help projects.
Coombs thought an impressive
part about the work of the Peace
Corps was that "The people came
to us." He cited one instance in
particular in which members of a
rural community walked for five
hours to reach the Peace Corps
Center in the central town of La
Plata. They had wanted to build
a bridge for six years, but the gov
ernment had neglected their re
quests. The bridge was to open
the other side of the river for the
exploitation of timber.
THREE MEN from the Peace
Corps worked on this assignment,
but only gave initial instructions;
then entrusted the rest, of the
project to the community itself.
According to Coombs, the prin
ciple behind this policy is that a
local projects belongs to the com
munity involved and that the job
of the Peace Corps is to help the
citizens realize their own plans.
In many cases the initiative for
projects comes from Peace Corps
members. Coombs was active in
forming- the village cooperative
store of San Andreas.
Other projects in La Plata in
cluded t lie construction of roads
and schools, the formation of a
village counsel, and the establish
ment of an adult literary pro
gram.
The Peace Corps has a favor
able economic impact on several
communities, Coombs says. By
encouraging initiative in a coun
try the Peace Corps creates work
for many people.
Coombs stressed the importance
of the Peace Corps members'
proving themselves as individuals.
Very little information about U.S.
affairs ever reaches rural areas.
The ideas of Marxism-Leninism
have penetrated South America
as a whole, he said, but Russia
has nothing to export that in
volves personal contact on a local
level there, such as the Peace
Corps.

rural community walked for five
hours to reach the Peace Corps
Center in the central town of La
Plata. They had wanted to build
a bridge for six years, but the gov
ernment had neglected their re
quests. The bridge was to open
the other side of the river for the
exploitation of timber.
THREE MEN from the Peace
Corps worked on this assignment,
but only gave initial instructions;
then entrusted the rest, of the
project to the community itself.
According to Coombs, the prin
ciple behind this policy is that a
local projects belongs to the com
munity involved and that the job
of the Peace Corps is to help the
citizens realize their own plans.
In many cases the initiative for
projects comes from Peace Corps
members. Coombs was active in
forming- the village cooperative
store of San Andreas.
Other projects in La Plata in
cluded t lie construction of roads
and schools, the formation of a
village counsel, and the establish
ment of an adult literary pro
gram.
The Peace Corps has a favor
able economic impact on several
communities, Coombs says. By
encouraging initiative in a coun
try the Peace Corps creates work
for many people.
Coombs stressed the importance
of the Peace Corps members'
proving themselves as individuals.
Very little information about U.S.
affairs ever reaches rural areas.
The ideas of Marxism-Leninism
have penetrated South America
as a whole, he said, but Russia
has nothing to export that in
volves personal contact on a local
level there, such as the Peace
Corps.
