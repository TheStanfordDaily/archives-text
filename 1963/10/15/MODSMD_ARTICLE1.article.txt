## Morocco Forces in Algeria; UN Opposes Rhodesia Plan 
### 
United Press International
ALGIERS The Algerian government said the Moroccan army,
supported by tanks and planes, had invaded Algeria to a depth of
nearly 20 miles yesterday but that the assault had been "contained."
It said fighting continued. A government communique issued after
a l'u-hour emergency cabinet meeting said the fighting raged along
the southwest frontier with Morocco about midway between Algiers
and the Coroccan capital of Rabat, 550 miles from each.
The border there is ill-defined and both Algeria and Morocco
claim and expanse of desert and mountains behind which President
Ahmed Ben Bella's army trained for the way of liberation against
France. Ben Bella, involved in a revolt with the Berbers who ac
tually fought the French, was reported to have withdrawn some
troops from the rebellius Kabylia area.
BRITAIN ASKEIJ TO WITHHOLD INDEPENDENCE -UNITED
NATIONS N.Y. The General Assembly yesterday called on Bri
tain to withhold sovereignty, including control of one of Africa's
strongest armed forces, from the "white minority" government of
Southern Rhodesia. The assembly approved by a 90-2 vote, with 13
abstentions, virtually the same resolution vetoed by Britain in the
Security Council early in September. The council resolution would
have amounted to an order to Britain; the assembly measure carries
only the force of a recommendation.
Only Portugal and South Africa voted against the 34-power reso
lution which invites Britain "to await the establishment of a govern
ment fully representative of all the inhabitants of the colony" before
transferring full authority to Southern Rhodesia. The United States
abstained.
COURT AVOIDS CANCER RULING WASHINGTON — The
Supreme Court declined yesterday for the time being to get involved
in the controversy over claims that cigarette smoking may cause
lung cancer. It did so at the first working session of the new term
by refusing to hear an appeal by a Louisiana widow who unsuccess
fully sued two cigarette firms on grounds their products were re
sponsible for the death of her husband.
The action was announced in a brief order without comment.
However, the sth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is hearing re-argu
ments on Nov. 1 in a similar case from Florida where the state court
has held that a cigarette company can be held liable for the death
of a person. (See story this paye.)
BIRMINGHAM MAYOR WON'T YIELD BIRMINGHAM, Ala.
Mayor Albert Bout well said yesterday near the deadline for an
other showdown with integration leaders that he would never bow
the pressure in the hiring of Negro policemen.
Bout well's executive assistant, W. C. Hamilton, explained that
it would be "impossible" anyway to employ even one Negro officer
by the deadline — one week from Monday set by Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., as the price for refraining from new racial demon
strations. Hamilton said civil service regulations require about six
weeks to clear prospective policemen for employment and therefore
"it would take an act of the legislature to hire Negro policemen" by
King's deadline.

COURT AVOIDS CANCER RULING WASHINGTON — The
Supreme Court declined yesterday for the time being to get involved
in the controversy over claims that cigarette smoking may cause
lung cancer. It did so at the first working session of the new term
by refusing to hear an appeal by a Louisiana widow who unsuccess
fully sued two cigarette firms on grounds their products were re
sponsible for the death of her husband.
The action was announced in a brief order without comment.
However, the sth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is hearing re-argu
ments on Nov. 1 in a similar case from Florida where the state court
has held that a cigarette company can be held liable for the death
of a person. (See story this paye.)
BIRMINGHAM MAYOR WON'T YIELD BIRMINGHAM, Ala.
Mayor Albert Bout well said yesterday near the deadline for an
other showdown with integration leaders that he would never bow
the pressure in the hiring of Negro policemen.
Bout well's executive assistant, W. C. Hamilton, explained that
it would be "impossible" anyway to employ even one Negro officer
by the deadline — one week from Monday set by Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., as the price for refraining from new racial demon
strations. Hamilton said civil service regulations require about six
weeks to clear prospective policemen for employment and therefore
"it would take an act of the legislature to hire Negro policemen" by
King's deadline.

the southwest frontier with Morocco about midway between Algiers
and the Coroccan capital of Rabat, 550 miles from each.
The border there is ill-defined and both Algeria and Morocco
claim and expanse of desert and mountains behind which President
Ahmed Ben Bella's army trained for the way of liberation against
