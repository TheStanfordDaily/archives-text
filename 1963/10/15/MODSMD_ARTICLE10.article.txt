# Caracas University Faculty to Close
## 
### 
CARACUS, Venezuela (UPI)
The faculty yesterday voted to
close Caracas' Central University
because of student links with pro-
Castro terrorists.
The council acted after police
traced cars used in Sunday's slay
ing of four men by terrorists to
the university campus. The coun
cil apparently feared the incident
would suffice to give the police
reason to enter and search the
grounds for terrorists.
