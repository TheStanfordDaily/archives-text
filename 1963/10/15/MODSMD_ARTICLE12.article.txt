# Cancer Danger Warning Labels Suggested
## 
### GUY FUNABIKI 
Twenty-three scientific officials and agencies
now arc of the opinion Hint cigarette smoking is
a major causative factor in lung cancer and other
diseases. These include among them the Public
Health Cancer Association, the Swedish and Bri
tish Research Councils, the Nnlional Cancer Insti
tute, the American Heart Association, the World
Health Organization and several state medical
societies.
Having met with an industry-wide refusal of
its proposal that cigarette manufacturers volun
tarily label their products with a warning stating
that the excessive use of cigarettes is detrimental
to health, the Rosewell Park Memorial Institute,
a research-treatment center of the New York State
Department of Health, restated the preponderance
of scientific and medical opinion in a letter to the
Tobacco Institute.
AN KAKI/IKK LKTTKK to C.eorgo V. Allen,
President and Executive Director of the Tobacco
Institute, Inc.. suggesting that warning labels be
placed on all cigarette packages was met with a
response to the effect that until more conclusive
evidence is presented, linking cigarette smoking
with cancer, the cigarette industry does not feel
that the action is warranted.
Whereupon, Dr. Morton L. Levin. Chairman of

the Cigarette Canccr Committee of tlie Rosewell
Park Memorial Institute, restated the proposal,
citing nine major scientific facts showing the
effects on health by cigarcte smokers as compared
with non-smokers.
It is now known that cigarette smokers have
a higher general death rate than do non-smokers
and that the increase in lung cancer among smok
ers is approximately proportional to the average
number of cigarettes smoked per day. Cigarette
smokers have over a 50'< greater chance of dying
of heart attack than do non-smokers and cigarette
smoke tar contains small quantities of sixteen
chemicals previously known to be cancer-produc
ing in animals.
I)|{. LISYIN concluded his letter to the Tobacco
Institute: "We realize tho tobacco industry is faced
with a serious problem because of these findings.
However, the industry cannot evade responsibility
for what it now does about these facts. If it tries
to hide them, to deny them, or to minimize them
it thereby assumes responsibility for the harmful
consequences to the health of smokers.
"We, therefore, suggest that the industry fur
ther consider the advisability of ircognizing the
health hazards of cigarette smoking, whether by
warning labels on cigarette packages or by other
means."
