# 'Runners Renown Outran...'
## 
### 
Harold MacMillan has resigned. Konrad Adenauer lias
resigned. Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower find
their words heeded loss and loss. An era in international poli
tics is passing. Those people have served their countries
devotedly and well, but their time has passed, and with them
will pass the nationalism of the World Wars, and the "new
Europe" of integration will slowly emerge.
Great men are slow to face the greatest service of all: to
know when to step down in favor of another generation of
men and ideas. Charles DeGaulle might perhaps be held to
answer in this last category.
A. E. Houseman, in his poem, "To An Athlete Dying
Young," states:
"Smart lad, to slip betimes away
From fields where glory does not stay
And early through the laurel grows
It withers quicker than the rose. . . .
"Now you will not swell the rout
Of lads that wore their honours out,
Runners whom renown outran
And the name died before the man."
Few "athletes" are favored enough by history to be taken
from their arena while their skills are unsurpassed and their
laurels are fresh. And few men easily relinquish power that
is based upon conviction of their own ideals, even when time
proves their ideals irrelevant.
As the great leaders of one time step down, we must
accord them their respected place in history, and turn to
their successors to meet the challenges of a world the older
men cannot understand.
