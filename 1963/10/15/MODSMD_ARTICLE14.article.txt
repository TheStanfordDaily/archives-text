DEAN LARIMER
Editor, The Daily:
To the degree that a univer
sity derives its greatness from
the stature of men guiding it,
Stanford will suffer an inesti
mable loss at the end of this
month.
News of the resignation of Dean
Larimer has indeed been the
cause of true regret to us as stu
dents. He was a man of rare
qualities, not often enough found
in administrative positions. His
unquestioned integrity together
with an enthusiastic and refresh
ing idealism concerning the role
of the university, has been com
bined with an amazing and self
less desire to serve others.
The influence of such men goes
far beyond that generated by im
mediate policy decisions — im
portant and pressing as these
may seem at the time. Their in
fluence. rather, lives on far more
enduring in the lives of students
who have met with them on a
person-to-person basis, and have
emerged better people because of
it. The many students who over
the years have come to Dean
Larimer with problems — large
or small, academic or personal—
have left with a truer sense of
their potential and responsibili
ties as students. Such an influ
ence is hard to replace.
These last three years as a stu
dent I have empathized with the
Stanford which I believe in its
better moments is striving to at
tain the ideals of a great univer
sity. It is not only, then, a per
sonal sense of sorrow which I ex
press, but also a shared sense of
shame which must lie heavily at
this time upon the regime which
could bring about, once again,
that which I imagine must be a
truly difficult feat: the resigna
tion of a dedicated and idealistic
man.

Editor, The Daily:
We, as a university, can feel
only a very sad loss at the resig
nation of Assoc. Dean of Men
David Larimer. He has been a
great personal help and a fine
friend to all of us. His kindness
and wisdom have been a tremen
dous contribution in a time when
kindness and wisdom have been
so needed and yet so rare.
We owe Lean Larimer a great
vote of thanks, and the hope that
he will find only happiness and
success in his new position.

'VOIC E' NEEDED
Editor, The Daily:
Off campus publications may
not bo freely sold on campus; the
reason given by the administra
tion for the limitation is to "pro
hibit harassment of Stanford stu
dents and faculty." Stanford stu
dents and faculty (and adminis
trators) sorely need to be ha
rassed. They need to be shocked
by some outside influence into
being concerned — about any
thing: intellectual, philosophic,
artistic, or political, anything out
side of themselves and their im
mediate community. Stanford is
a fascinating place, but the crime
is that it holds but a fraction of
the fascination and stimulation it
should. Comparatively, it is a
stagnant community.
Why is it so static? The stu
dent body is certainly of very
high caliber, and the faculty is
undisputedly one of the finest
and largest in the country. That
should be an electric combination,
but it is not. The university com
munity is so introverted, so iso
lationist that it is almost unaware
of the existence of an outside
world. The hottest controversy
on campus last year was the aboli
tion of class government. Not
that it wasn't an important cause,
and not that very important
issues weren't involved, but it was
a concern wholly bound up within
Stanford and bearing no relation
to anything else.
Apathy brings a tragic atrophy,
and by its own introversion, Stan
ford is dying of it. The univer
sity has, for the most part, ma
tured past the rah-rah-college
stage, but it has not yet fully
grown into its role as a univer
sity. It is not doing justice to its
reputation, its faculty, its stu
dents, nor the communities sur
rounding it. What the campus
needs now more than contribu
tions to PACE or an effective
card stunt program is a handful
or more of real radicals, of self
proclaimed messiahs, of soap-box
orators, of reactionary or avant
garde publications peddled by col
-legi a t e philosophers. Stanford
needs a dozen dogs nipping at its
heels. Don't throw out the dogs
that are finally daring to nip;
feed them and be thankful for
the service they are trying to
render.
And in this immediate contro
versy, don't let it degenerate into
a legalistic argument or a politi
cal squabble, but keep the issue a
basic one. It doesn't matter
whether Stanford is "private
property" or "a community" nor
does the quality, source, or bias
of the specific publication in
volved make any important dif
ference. The issue at stake is:
Will Stanford continue in its self
contented way. producing "nor
mal" middle-class conservatives
(not that we don't need normal,
middle-class conservatives), or is
it finally going to be forced to
realize that there are vital con
cerns which extend beyond Juni
pera Serra and Palm Drive. Wel
come the dissenters; they are do
ing their unwitting best to save
a great university.

To the degree that a univer

the stature of men guiding it,
Stanford will suffer an inesti
mable loss at the end of this
month.
News of the resignation of Dean
Larimer has indeed been the
cause of true regret to us as stu
dents. He was a man of rare
qualities, not often enough found
in administrative positions. His
unquestioned integrity together
with an enthusiastic and refresh
ing idealism concerning the role
of the university, has been com
bined with an amazing and self
less desire to serve others.
The influence of such men goes
far beyond that generated by im
mediate policy decisions — im
portant and pressing as these
may seem at the time. Their in
fluence. rather, lives on far more
enduring in the lives of students
who have met with them on a
person-to-person basis, and have
emerged better people because of
it. The many students who over
the years have come to Dean
Larimer with problems — large
or small, academic or personal—
have left with a truer sense of
their potential and responsibili
ties as students. Such an influ
ence is hard to replace.
These last three years as a stu
dent I have empathized with the
Stanford which I believe in its
better moments is striving to at
tain the ideals of a great univer
sity. It is not only, then, a per
sonal sense of sorrow which I ex
press, but also a shared sense of
shame which must lie heavily at
this time upon the regime which
could bring about, once again,
that which I imagine must be a
truly difficult feat: the resigna
tion of a dedicated and idealistic
man.

We, as a university, can feel
only a very sad loss at the resig
nation of Assoc. Dean of Men
David Larimer. He has been a
great personal help and a fine
friend to all of us. His kindness
and wisdom have been a tremen

kindness and wisdom have been
so needed and yet so rare.
We owe Lean Larimer a great
vote of thanks, and the hope that
he will find only happiness and

'VOIC E' NEEDED
Editor, The Daily:
Off campus publications may
not bo freely sold on campus; the
reason given by the administra
tion for the limitation is to "pro
hibit harassment of Stanford stu
dents and faculty." Stanford stu
dents and faculty (and adminis
trators) sorely need to be ha
rassed. They need to be shocked
by some outside influence into
being concerned — about any
thing: intellectual, philosophic,
artistic, or political, anything out
side of themselves and their im
mediate community. Stanford is
a fascinating place, but the crime
is that it holds but a fraction of
the fascination and stimulation it
should. Comparatively, it is a
stagnant community.
Why is it so static? The stu
dent body is certainly of very
high caliber, and the faculty is
undisputedly one of the finest
and largest in the country. That
should be an electric combination,
but it is not. The university com
munity is so introverted, so iso
lationist that it is almost unaware
of the existence of an outside
world. The hottest controversy
on campus last year was the aboli
tion of class government. Not
that it wasn't an important cause,
and not that very important
issues weren't involved, but it was
a concern wholly bound up within
Stanford and bearing no relation
to anything else.
Apathy brings a tragic atrophy,
and by its own introversion, Stan
ford is dying of it. The univer
sity has, for the most part, ma
tured past the rah-rah-college
stage, but it has not yet fully
grown into its role as a univer
sity. It is not doing justice to its
reputation, its faculty, its stu
dents, nor the communities sur
rounding it. What the campus
needs now more than contribu
tions to PACE or an effective
card stunt program is a handful
or more of real radicals, of self
proclaimed messiahs, of soap-box
orators, of reactionary or avant
garde publications peddled by col
-legi a t e philosophers. Stanford
needs a dozen dogs nipping at its
heels. Don't throw out the dogs
that are finally daring to nip;
feed them and be thankful for
the service they are trying to
render.
And in this immediate contro
versy, don't let it degenerate into
a legalistic argument or a politi
cal squabble, but keep the issue a
basic one. It doesn't matter
whether Stanford is "private
property" or "a community" nor
does the quality, source, or bias
of the specific publication in
volved make any important dif
ference. The issue at stake is:
Will Stanford continue in its self
contented way. producing "nor
mal" middle-class conservatives
(not that we don't need normal,
middle-class conservatives), or is
it finally going to be forced to
realize that there are vital con
cerns which extend beyond Juni

To the degree that a univer

the stature of men guiding it,
Stanford will suffer an inesti
mable loss at the end of this
month.
News of the resignation of Dean
Larimer has indeed been the
cause of true regret to us as stu
dents. He was a man of rare
qualities, not often enough found
in administrative positions. His
unquestioned integrity together
with an enthusiastic and refresh
ing idealism concerning the role
of the university, has been com
bined with an amazing and self
less desire to serve others.
The influence of such men goes
far beyond that generated by im
mediate policy decisions — im
portant and pressing as these
may seem at the time. Their in
fluence. rather, lives on far more
enduring in the lives of students
who have met with them on a
person-to-person basis, and have
emerged better people because of
it. The many students who over
the years have come to Dean
Larimer with problems — large
or small, academic or personal—
have left with a truer sense of
their potential and responsibili
ties as students. Such an influ
ence is hard to replace.
These last three years as a stu
dent I have empathized with the
Stanford which I believe in its
better moments is striving to at
tain the ideals of a great univer
sity. It is not only, then, a per
sonal sense of sorrow which I ex
press, but also a shared sense of
shame which must lie heavily at
this time upon the regime which
could bring about, once again,
that which I imagine must be a
truly difficult feat: the resigna

We, as a university, can feel
only a very sad loss at the resig
nation of Assoc. Dean of Men
David Larimer. He has been a
great personal help and a fine
friend to all of us. His kindness
and wisdom have been a tremen

kindness and wisdom have been
so needed and yet so rare.
We owe Lean Larimer a great
vote of thanks, and the hope that
he will find only happiness and

Editor, The Daily:
Off campus publications may
not bo freely sold on campus; the
reason given by the administra
tion for the limitation is to "pro
hibit harassment of Stanford stu
dents and faculty." Stanford stu
dents and faculty (and adminis
trators) sorely need to be ha
rassed. They need to be shocked
by some outside influence into
being concerned — about any
thing: intellectual, philosophic,
artistic, or political, anything out
side of themselves and their im
mediate community. Stanford is
a fascinating place, but the crime
is that it holds but a fraction of
the fascination and stimulation it
should. Comparatively, it is a
stagnant community.
Why is it so static? The stu
dent body is certainly of very
high caliber, and the faculty is
undisputedly one of the finest
and largest in the country. That
should be an electric combination,
but it is not. The university com
munity is so introverted, so iso
lationist that it is almost unaware
of the existence of an outside
world. The hottest controversy
on campus last year was the aboli
tion of class government. Not
that it wasn't an important cause,
and not that very important
issues weren't involved, but it was
a concern wholly bound up within
Stanford and bearing no relation
to anything else.
Apathy brings a tragic atrophy,
and by its own introversion, Stan
ford is dying of it. The univer
sity has, for the most part, ma
tured past the rah-rah-college
stage, but it has not yet fully
grown into its role as a univer
sity. It is not doing justice to its
reputation, its faculty, its stu
dents, nor the communities sur
rounding it. What the campus
needs now more than contribu
tions to PACE or an effective
card stunt program is a handful
or more of real radicals, of self
proclaimed messiahs, of soap-box
orators, of reactionary or avant
garde publications peddled by col
-legi a t e philosophers. Stanford
needs a dozen dogs nipping at its
heels. Don't throw out the dogs
that are finally daring to nip;
feed them and be thankful for
the service they are trying to
render.
And in this immediate contro
versy, don't let it degenerate into
a legalistic argument or a politi
cal squabble, but keep the issue a
basic one. It doesn't matter

Editor, The Daily:
To the degree that a univer
sity derives its greatness from
the stature of men guiding it,
Stanford will suffer an inesti
mable loss at the end of this
month.
News of the resignation of Dean
Larimer has indeed been the
cause of true regret to us as stu
dents. He was a man of rare
qualities, not often enough found
in administrative positions. His
unquestioned integrity together
with an enthusiastic and refresh
ing idealism concerning the role
of the university, has been com
bined with an amazing and self
less desire to serve others.
The influence of such men goes
far beyond that generated by im
mediate policy decisions — im
portant and pressing as these
may seem at the time. Their in
fluence. rather, lives on far more
enduring in the lives of students
who have met with them on a
person-to-person basis, and have
emerged better people because of
it. The many students who over
the years have come to Dean
Larimer with problems — large
or small, academic or personal—
have left with a truer sense of
their potential and responsibili
ties as students. Such an influ
ence is hard to replace.
These last three years as a stu
dent I have empathized with the
Stanford which I believe in its
better moments is striving to at
tain the ideals of a great univer
sity. It is not only, then, a per
sonal sense of sorrow which I ex
press, but also a shared sense of
shame which must lie heavily at
this time upon the regime which
could bring about, once again,
that which I imagine must be a
truly difficult feat: the resigna
tion of a dedicated and idealistic
man.

We, as a university, can feel
only a very sad loss at the resig
nation of Assoc. Dean of Men
David Larimer. He has been a
great personal help and a fine
friend to all of us. His kindness
and wisdom have been a tremen
dous contribution in a time when
kindness and wisdom have been
so needed and yet so rare.
We owe Lean Larimer a great
vote of thanks, and the hope that
he will find only happiness and
success in his new position.

'VOIC E' NEEDED
Editor, The Daily:
Off campus publications may
not bo freely sold on campus; the
reason given by the administra
tion for the limitation is to "pro
hibit harassment of Stanford stu
dents and faculty." Stanford stu
dents and faculty (and adminis
trators) sorely need to be ha
rassed. They need to be shocked
by some outside influence into
being concerned — about any
thing: intellectual, philosophic,
artistic, or political, anything out
side of themselves and their im
mediate community. Stanford is
a fascinating place, but the crime
is that it holds but a fraction of
the fascination and stimulation it
should. Comparatively, it is a
stagnant community.
Why is it so static? The stu
dent body is certainly of very
high caliber, and the faculty is
undisputedly one of the finest
and largest in the country. That
should be an electric combination,
but it is not. The university com
munity is so introverted, so iso
lationist that it is almost unaware
of the existence of an outside
world. The hottest controversy
on campus last year was the aboli
tion of class government. Not
that it wasn't an important cause,
and not that very important
issues weren't involved, but it was
a concern wholly bound up within
Stanford and bearing no relation
to anything else.
Apathy brings a tragic atrophy,
and by its own introversion, Stan
ford is dying of it. The univer
sity has, for the most part, ma
tured past the rah-rah-college
stage, but it has not yet fully
grown into its role as a univer
sity. It is not doing justice to its
reputation, its faculty, its stu
dents, nor the communities sur
rounding it. What the campus
needs now more than contribu
tions to PACE or an effective
card stunt program is a handful
or more of real radicals, of self
proclaimed messiahs, of soap-box
orators, of reactionary or avant
garde publications peddled by col
-legi a t e philosophers. Stanford
needs a dozen dogs nipping at its
heels. Don't throw out the dogs
that are finally daring to nip;
feed them and be thankful for
the service they are trying to
