# Paris Theatre's 'Joan' --Sombre, Philosophical
## 
### FRED ANDRLE Daily Drama Critic 
The Paris Theatre's latest off
ering, "Joan of the Angels," is a
sombre little piece, of interest
both cinematically and philosophi
cally. Director-producer Jerzy
Kawalerowicz' tale of a pious
priest's attempt to rid a Christian
convent of the demons which
have managed to overcome its in
habitants is quite arresting, due
principally to the combination of
impeccable performances on the
part of the principal players and
an excellent directorial technique.
Lucynna Wionicka as mother
superior Joan, the lady in ques
tion, is most effective in her por
trayal of the possessed. She is
called upon to deliver a wide
range of emotion and finds no
great difficultv in responding.
MIECZYSLAW VOIT as th e
priest is appropriately simple,
wide-eyed, and prayerful. like
wise more than competent.
Kawaleroficz' camera is rarely
at rest but roams about flitting
from horror to horror, silently
approaching the grey convent
walls, probing its shadowy hall
ways, coming to rest unexpect
edly on the faces of the possesed.
The director is a master at the
creation and release of tension
by a variety of visual and aural
effects. He is equally competent
in the area of visual inference,
the most striking instance of
which is the priest's murder of
grooms in a stable seen only in
its influence upon two magnifi
cent while horses, maddened for
the moment by the sight and
smell of blood.

All this dramatic excellence is,
alas, merely a superficiality of
the vehicle for this Polish gov
ernment sponsored film's philo
sophical tenets. The production,
assures a sardonic prologue, is
no mere resurrection of a medie
val fantasy but an examination of
the problems arising when hu
man desire conflicts with a "set
of rules." The rules under con
sideration here are the principles
of Christian morality, and the
film's ideological progression
makes it clear that, from this
artist's point of view, those regu
lations are the cause of the funda
rental distress of modern man.
HUMAN ACTS which some
call sin, maintains Kawalerowicz,
are in reality expressions of
man's continual search for the
good. None, therefore, may ques
tion or condemn any act th e
basis of which is love. The nuns'
possession is actually a Christ
possession. The solution of the
strife caused by the 'demons" in
the individual is Christ exorcism,
a renunciation of the traditional
rules of moral behavior in favor
of a permissive secularism.
Mother Joan of the title does
not, poor girl, realize her need
for the proper form of exorcism
and, in the production's final mo
ment is shown clutching another
distraught holy woman while the
superimposed image of a church
bell peals silently to the accom
paniment of their weeping. This,
of course, a final relating of hu
man misery to its cause.
All of which leads one to con
sider the film's source and deal
with it accordingly.

All this dramatic excellence is,
alas, merely a superficiality of
the vehicle for this Polish gov
ernment sponsored film's philo
sophical tenets. The production,
assures a sardonic prologue, is
no mere resurrection of a medie
val fantasy but an examination of
the problems arising when hu
man desire conflicts with a "set
of rules." The rules under con
sideration here are the principles
of Christian morality, and the
film's ideological progression
makes it clear that, from this
artist's point of view, those regu
lations are the cause of the funda
rental distress of modern man.
HUMAN ACTS which some
call sin, maintains Kawalerowicz,
are in reality expressions of
man's continual search for the
good. None, therefore, may ques
tion or condemn any act th e
basis of which is love. The nuns'
possession is actually a Christ
possession. The solution of the
strife caused by the 'demons" in
the individual is Christ exorcism,
a renunciation of the traditional
rules of moral behavior in favor
of a permissive secularism.
Mother Joan of the title does
not, poor girl, realize her need
for the proper form of exorcism
and, in the production's final mo
ment is shown clutching another
distraught holy woman while the
superimposed image of a church
bell peals silently to the accom
paniment of their weeping. This,
of course, a final relating of hu
man misery to its cause.
All of which leads one to con
sider the film's source and deal
with it accordingly.
The Paris Theatre's latest off
ering, "Joan of the Angels," is a
sombre little piece, of interest
both cinematically and philosophi
cally. Director-producer Jerzy
Kawalerowicz' tale of a pious
priest's attempt to rid a Christian
convent of the demons which
have managed to overcome its in
habitants is quite arresting, due
principally to the combination of
impeccable performances on the
part of the principal players and
an excellent directorial technique.
Lucynna Wionicka as mother
superior Joan, the lady in ques
tion, is most effective in her por
trayal of the possessed. She is
called upon to deliver a wide
range of emotion and finds no
great difficultv in responding.
MIECZYSLAW VOIT as th e
priest is appropriately simple,
wide-eyed, and prayerful. like
wise more than competent.
Kawaleroficz' camera is rarely
at rest but roams about flitting
from horror to horror, silently
approaching the grey convent
walls, probing its shadowy hall
ways, coming to rest unexpect
edly on the faces of the possesed.
The director is a master at the
creation and release of tension
by a variety of visual and aural
effects. He is equally competent
in the area of visual inference,
the most striking instance of
which is the priest's murder of
grooms in a stable seen only in
its influence upon two magnifi
cent while horses, maddened for
the moment by the sight and
smell of blood.
