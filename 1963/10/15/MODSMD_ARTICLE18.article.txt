### ROGER MAGNUSON 
"We would've beat litem twice
as bad without that guy in there,"
muttered the spectator while am
bling from the Indian rugby field,
site of the San Francisco State-
Stanford soccer game Saturday.
"That guy" was State goalie Dick
Soderstrom who displayed some
sensational gymnastics as he
stopped twenty Indian shots and
and let five go by, in a game
won by the Tribe, 5-1.
Stanford's long lead passes and
crisp, short passing attack re
peatedly set up scoring opportuni
ties in front of the San Francisco
cage that were either repulsed
by Soderstrom or ihe side posts
of the net. The Indians scored
first at I:3f> when Klaus Berg
man kicked a long, lead pass over
the head of State defenders to
Don Griffith who dribbled in
alone deked out the goalie.
CHUCK WI']I)KBK gained credit
for Stanford's second tally as he
"headed" a pass from the side
lines past Soderstrom at 2:25 of
the second period. Another lead
pass gave the Tribe squad its
third score. This time Kammel
Kadi did the honors with a vici

| ous kick from thirty fool out that
appeared virtually unstoppable
as it sailed into tiio mesh.
At Ihe end of the first half, the
1 State goalie had stopped eleven
shots while Stanford's goalie Mid
ler had two, as I ho Indians led 3-0.
With 11:43 expended on the
dock in the 3rd period, Griffith
got his second goal by diverting
a Bergman pass into the nel with
his head after many other Stan
ford attempts had failed by
inches in the period,
STATU WAS finally able to
score at :10 of the fourth period
when Tech-wah Man intercepted
a Stanford defenseman's pass in
tended for second half goalie Tom
Paulsen, and beat Paulsen with
a well-aimed shot into ihe left
I upper corner' of the net.
A 1 Nnoli finished off the scor
ing with his sixth goal of the sea
son, booting a ball which struck
the top post of the goal and richo
' cheted in at 1:44.
This year's varsity has now pro
ducer! an average of six goals per
game, while allowing opponents
an average of but one, prompting
Priddle to remark that "I guess J
can't complain about that."
NKXT OPPONENT for the un
defeated Indians is San Jose, a
learn expected to provide another
challenge for the team's future
hopes. The game is scheduled to
start at 9:00 a.m. at the rugby
field.
In other soccer games Satur
day, the freshmen lost to Diablo
Valley Jr. College, while the Stan
ford Junior Varsity edged San
Francisco State Jr. Varsity 1-0.
