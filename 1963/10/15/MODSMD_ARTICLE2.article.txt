## 
### 
ANN ARBOR. Mich. iCPSi The University of Michigan's
faculty advisory committee on referral issued a M-day stay last
Monday on a student government motion to eliminate discrimination
in the membership procedures of student groups.
"The referral committee which advises vice-president of student

affairs, James A. Lewis, declared
the stay in order to investigate
further the anti-discrimination
motion," explained Joseph Kal
lenvach, a professor of political
science.
If the deadline had not been ex
tended. the vice-president would
have to decide for or against the
motion. Lewis holds sole approv
al and veto authority subject to
referral committe advice.
ALSO RESPONSIBLE for the
postponement was a request by
Lawrence Smith, an attorney rep
resenting 11 campus sororities
challenging student council au
thority to watch over member
ship selection practices.
Entitled "Membership Selec
tion in Student Organization." the
controversial motion establishes
a membership committee to in
vestigate alleged discriminatory
practices in student groups a n d
sets up a three-man student-con
trolled tribunal to hear proceed
ings initiated by the membership
com mittee.
THE TRIBUNAL has the sane

t inning power to withdraw recog
nition from student groups sub
ject to veto by the vice-president
for student affairs.
The student council's action is
vested under the delegation of au
thority from the University board
of regents. This delegation, re
affirmed in a declaration last
May. states that the council is
empowered to establish rules and
procedures implementing Regents
bylaw 2.14, which notes in part
that the University "shall work
for the elimination of discrimina
tion in private organizations
recognized by the University."
