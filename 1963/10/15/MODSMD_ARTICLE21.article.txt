Jim Gaughran's water polo
1o;nn showed its muscle over the
weekend by trouncing Cal 32-2
Friday, and whipping the San
Francisco Olympic Club 15-6, and
Foothill College 12-1 on Saturday.
Brian Beck, and Marty Hull,
each scoring seven markers, led
the Indians to a smashing 32-2
victory over Cal, Friday, in the
Cards' AAVVU league debut. Stan

ford is ticrl with I T SC for the Big
Six Water Polo Lead, with a 1-0
league record.
Saturday's show was especially
impressive. 1951 was t he last year
in which the Indians were able to
come out victorious over the
Olympic Club. Although "O" Club
was not at full strength, it was
obvious that they were no match
for Stanford under any circum
stances. Goughran substituted lib

orally and si ill made tho victory
look easy.
MARTY HULL (4 goals) and
Bill Ready <r> goals) did tho hulk
of tho scoring against "O" Club.
A fantastic back hand shot by
Hull loft tho crowd (and the
Olympic goalie) speechless.
Foothill College brought a 4-0
record into Saturday's game, but
failed to blemish the Indians' 6-0
mark. Led by Lorton and Hull tho
Cards jumped to a 5-0 load in the
first period. Goalie George Stran
ski was to use Coach Gaughran's
post game words "fantastic."
C.AUfiHRAN ALSO praised the
rest of tho Card defense, calling
the defense, "The most important
part of our offensive. Alertness is
tho key to our defense." The In
dians made Foothill look asleep,
Foothill being unable to keep the
ball long enough to sot up an
effective play.
Next week Stanford travels
south for a Saturday double
header, meeting UCLA in a league
I contest, then tackling Cerritos.

Foothill College brought a 4-0
record into Saturday's game, but
failed to blemish the Indians' 6-0
mark. Led by Lorton and Hull tho
Cards jumped to a 5-0 load in the
first period. Goalie George Stran
ski was to use Coach Gaughran's
post game words "fantastic."
C.AUfiHRAN ALSO praised the
rest of tho Card defense, calling
the defense, "The most important
part of our offensive. Alertness is
tho key to our defense." The In
dians made Foothill look asleep,
Foothill being unable to keep the
ball long enough to sot up an
effective play.
Next week Stanford travels
south for a Saturday double
header, meeting UCLA in a league
I contest, then tackling Cerritos.
