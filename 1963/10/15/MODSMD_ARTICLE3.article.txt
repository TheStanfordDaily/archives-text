## 
### 
Stanford has made off with an
other gem from the eastern aca
| demie crown. Waller H. Sokel,
| associate professor of German at
Columbia, has agreed to join the
Stanford Gerin a n department
■ next year.
When interviewed by the Co
lumbia Spectator, Sokel said his
I reasons for coming were two
fold: 1 » Stanford offers salaries
25 to 35 percent higher than Co-
I lumbia; and 2> Stanford has
promised an all-expense paid trip
to Europe for his entire family
I for one semester every o t her
| year.
SOKKL expects to find the
I same high quality students here
1 that he taught at Columbia; he
: will also enjoy free medical serv
j ice for his family and a climate
: far superior to that of New York.
At Columbia, Sokel taught
i courses in the German novel.
I Kafka to the present, and the
; German lyric. Here he will have
I a free hand in deciding what he
! will teach.
lIK HAS INDICATED he will
instruct drama and novel courses
j similar to those at Columbia,
j Sokel commented that he ex-1
i pects to find an "eastern" atmos
phere permeating the faculty
i here.
