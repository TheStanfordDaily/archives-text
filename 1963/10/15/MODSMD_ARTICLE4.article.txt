# Six Portland Sororities Inactivated For Racial Prejudice Against Pledges
## 
### 
Six national sorority chapters
have been suspended at Portland
State College because they re
fused to pledge the only two
Negro girls who sought member
ship. The sororities were put on
an inactive basis by Branford
Millar, president of the college,
because there was evidence that
discrimination was involved.
Millar noted that the only rea
son the sororities had for reject

ing the Negroes is the wish of the
girls in the houses not to live
with them. The sororities feel that
they should have the freedom to
choose whom they wish to asso
ciate with and that "to yield to
faculty pressure eliminates all
freedom of choice."
The two girls were "eminently
qualified" and"the kin d of
pledges all sororities are looking
for," according to Millar. There
were only two other girls cut dur
ing the early stages of rush out
of 115 who sought membership.
"There were many other cases
in the past when sorority mem
bership was questioned by the
faculty," Millar said. "No longer
can sorority membership prac
itces escape serious doubt. This
was not a test case as far as the
administration is concerned, hut
'the straw thai finally broke the
camel's back.' " He added that
"the burden of proof is on the
sororities. They must show that
they do not practice discrimina
tion."
In a joint statement, the soror
ities said that the college's re
quest for such evidence amounted
to an ultimatum to admit the
Negro girls. Millar said he will
appoint a faculty board to review
the case and to establish the fu
ture status of the sororities at the
college.
