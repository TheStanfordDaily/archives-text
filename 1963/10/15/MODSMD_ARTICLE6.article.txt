# College Grads Share Unemployment Threat
## 
### 
WASHINGTON <CPS> President Kennedy's chief economic
advisor lias shattered the notion that a college degree assures all
graduates of a job. Chairman Walter W. Heller of the Council of
Economic Advisors told a Washington meeting of the American
Council on Education <ACE) last week that the unemployment rate

for college graduates more IharH
doubled between 19."i7 and 1962. J
During the same period, Heller,
said, the unemployment rate for
the much larger group of mule
workers with an Bth grade educa
tion or less rose only about one
half roughly the same as over
all unemployment during the five
year period.
HELLER said while the unem
ployment rate during the same
period fell for the poorly educated
group by 47 per cent, the rate of'
unemployed with some education;
rose instead of dropping.
Heller also attacked the as
sumption that automation was I
creating a demand for more col- i
lege-t rained workers.
"The evidence is to the con
trary," he said.
Heller said that unemployment i
among college graduates wasj
nothing new. Ho compared the
years of 1954 and 1962 — both
with an unemployment rate of j
5.6 per cent of the labor force.
During both years, a group aver
aging over 16 years of schooling
remained jobless at the identical
rate of 1.7 per cent.
"THIS AGAIN suggests," Hel
ler said, "that the highly educated I
group, vital as it is to longer
term growth, is no more of a hot - :
tleneck on the road to full em
ployment than it was in the ex
pansion between 1954-57."
Heller said a magic wand mak
ing every worker a college gradu
ate would not solve the nation's
4 million unemployment problem.
"There simply aren't enough
jobs to absorb both the unem
ployed, the technologically dis
placed and the new entrants all j
at once," he said.

The college trained, no matter
what the U.S. economy is doing,
still stands a better chance in the
labor market than the poorly
educated, Heller said. But. what's
needed is President Kennedy's
pending income tax cut program,
"1 he centerpiece of policy to gen
erate that demand and create the
needed jobs," Heller said.

more than 1.000 educators attend- j

House and Senate education com
mittees "have labored long and!

structive programs."
Keppel asserted, "1 have no fear j

lation will be bad legislation."
KKITKL ALSO attacked in
equality of education opportunity
heing paid "only lip service" by
many in higher education. He;
said tHat 11 per cent of the U.S.
population is Negro while only 4 I

crs.
"Almosl 12 per cenl of young ]

WASHINGTON <CPS> President Kennedy's chief economic
advisor lias shattered the notion that a college degree assures all
graduates of a job. Chairman Walter W. Heller of the Council of
Economic Advisors told a Washington meeting of the American
Council on Education <ACE) last week that the unemployment rate

for college graduates more IharH
doubled between 19."i7 and 1962. J
During the same period, Heller,
said, the unemployment rate for
the much larger group of mule
workers with an Bth grade educa
tion or less rose only about one
half roughly the same as over
all unemployment during the five
year period.
HELLER said while the unem
ployment rate during the same
period fell for the poorly educated
group by 47 per cent, the rate of'
unemployed with some education;
rose instead of dropping.
Heller also attacked the as
sumption that automation was I
creating a demand for more col- i
lege-t rained workers.
"The evidence is to the con
trary," he said.
Heller said that unemployment i
among college graduates wasj
nothing new. Ho compared the
years of 1954 and 1962 — both
with an unemployment rate of j
5.6 per cent of the labor force.
During both years, a group aver
aging over 16 years of schooling
remained jobless at the identical
rate of 1.7 per cent.
"THIS AGAIN suggests," Hel
ler said, "that the highly educated I
group, vital as it is to longer
term growth, is no more of a hot - :
tleneck on the road to full em
ployment than it was in the ex
pansion between 1954-57."
Heller said a magic wand mak
ing every worker a college gradu
ate would not solve the nation's
4 million unemployment problem.
"There simply aren't enough
jobs to absorb both the unem
ployed, the technologically dis
placed and the new entrants all j
at once," he said.

The college trained, no matter
what the U.S. economy is doing,
still stands a better chance in the
labor market than the poorly
educated, Heller said. But. what's
needed is President Kennedy's
pending income tax cut program,
"1 he centerpiece of policy to gen
erate that demand and create the
needed jobs," Heller said.
