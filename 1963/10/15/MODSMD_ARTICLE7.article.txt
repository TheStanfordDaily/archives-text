## 
### NANCY MARSHALL Managing Editor 
Problems, from realizing the aims of the Peace Corps to social
dating while serving overseas, were discussed by Dr. Joseph Col
men, Director of the Research Division, us he revealed the "other
side" of the Peace Corps experience to potential volunteers yesterday
afternoon.
From 90 to 95 per cent of the Americans working in the lesser

developed areas have reported- 1
that at some time they faced
problems that led to anger, frus
tration, and anxiety, he said.
But, these are all problems of
adjustment, and in the long run,
may have a positive effect on the
volunteer as an individual.
"Frustration is a growth experi
ence for the person who works
and lives through it. He becomes
a better person," Colmen said.
THE VOLUNTEER is first un
sure as to how lie will fulfill the
goals enumerated in the Peace
Act. He has learned that he must
1) help another nation to develop
socially, economically, and politi
cally; 2) learn more about that
country and report back to his
own; and 3> teach the people of
that country more about Ameri
cans so they will appreciate and
understand the aims of the Peace
Corps.
Because the Act does not estab
lish a priority of these three aims,
the volunteer is uncertain as to
just what he is to accomplish and
uncertain as to whether or not
he is doing the best possible job, ;
Colmen explained.

ONCE ABROAD, he said, the
volunteer finds he must revise
drastically his expectations of the
work ho had anticipated accom
plishing. He is confronted w i th
peoples who often are not ac
customed lo working hard and be
ing rewarded for it. They do not
look to the future, and conse
quently are not motivated to im
prove their suroundings.
"THUS THE volunter faces the
frustration of not being able to
see results as quickly as he would
like to see them. But then, ho
should not expect to see immedi
ate change in a nation that has
remained almost stagnant for
several centuries," Colmen said.
"The volunteer is often frus
trated 100 by a lack of cultural
and intellectual stimulation in the
community he is serving," Col
men said. "He finds no museums,
no universities, no opportunities
for discussion, and therefore is
faced with the problem of how to
overcome intellectual ennui and
how to maintain intellectual curi
osity."
IN DATING and other social
situations, the Peace Corps volun
teer must also adjust to the stand
ards of the country he is serving.
"In the Philippines," Colmen
said, "there is no such thing as
a movie and ice cream soda date,
and dates must always be chape
roned." The female volunteer
finds she must destroy the image
of the American woman as por
trayed in the movies if she is to
maintain a balance of dating and
friendship.
EVEN AFTER returning home,
the volunteer may be frustrated
as tries to explain in realistic
terms occasional defeat and bore
dom to an American public that
has read only of the glory, ex
citement, and accomplishments
of the Peace Corps, Calmen said.
"Yet. in .spite of these examples
of the "other side" of the Peace
Corps experience, volunteers have
for the most part done the right
tiling whether or not it was their
impulse to do so. They have ad
justed lo being viewed as a "curi
osity" and to thinking before re
sponding. This is what lias made
the success," he concluded.
