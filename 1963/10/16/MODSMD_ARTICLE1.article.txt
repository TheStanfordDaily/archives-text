# Peace Corps Psychiatrists Help Volunteers Adjust
## 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
Only one-half of one per cent I
of Peace Corps volunteers return
to America because of psychia
tric problems before they have
completed their service. The work j
done by the Psychiatric Division !
of tho Peace Corps, to which this
excellent record is largely due,
was described yesterday by Dr.
Joseph T. English, who heads
this division and who is a mem
ber of the Peace Corps staff cur
rently on campus, in an inter
view with The Daily.
The major part of their work
involves talking with volunteers
in the university training sites.
"Unlike the Army, the Peace
Corps does not require that its
members suppress their feelings. I

Our psychiatrists try to prepare
volunteers for possible psycho
logical reactions they will have
overseas and show them how to
deal with them," English said.
Many find difficulty, for example,
in adjusting to being stared at
wherever they go; trainees can
not avoid being conspicuous, he
said.
"OUR MOST IMPORTANT
work is done overseas," he added.
In each country there is a sup
porting staff consisting of one
or two representatives of the
Peace Corps and a doctor. These
staffs are oriented to have an
awareness of the psychological
problems of volunteers, and often
visit them not only for progress
reports but to give them a chance
to talk, English said.

What kind of applicant makes !
the best volunteers? English
characterized him as a "pragma
tic idealist" â€” a person whose
ideals do not occupy him so com
pletely that he is unable to do
the hard, often frustrating work
needed to fulfill them.
"A VOLUNTEER might find
in his community a situation com
pletely different from what he ex
pected. He should be one who
finds a disorganized situation a
challenge," English said. The best
volunteers, he explained, are
those who are tremendously at
tracted by the opportunity to do
a meaningul job as an individual,
who have the capacity to learn
from the experience, and who are
able to tolerate great frustration
in the process.

Ho added however, that even
the most successful must go
through a difficult period of ma
turation of their unrealistic ex
pectations. "Despite warnings
during training, many a volun
teer still goes over thinking he
will be a long-awaited messiah.
He is likely to find not only that
the community didn't expect him,
but that they don't understand
wiiat he is there for once he ar
rives. Suspicions are intensified
when they learn that money does
not accompany his arrival, as has
always been the case before with
Americans."
Part of the job of the overseas
staff, said English, is to support
the volunteers through the first
four or five months of trying to
be accepted by the community.<

"This maturation is seldom dra
matic," he said; "more often it
is the satisfaction of seeing tan- j
gible evidence of their work.
For a teacher it may simply be j
knowing that his presence h a s j
aimed a few children toward col-1
lege, and that one of them may |
be the first college graduate of
his community.
A SERIES of conferences with
the first group of two-year vol
unteers, which took place about
six weeks befoit? they were
scheduled to return, has just
been completed. "We talked to
them to find out what the prob
lems of return would be," Eng
lish said. "We knew they'd done
a good job; but in these confer
ences we were more impressed
1 by what had happened to th e m

personally."
According to t he volunteers, he
said, they had never before en
joyed such freedom of operation,
and such freedom to be com
pletely themselves. They had
been impressed by having had so
much responsibility and having
earned so much personal respect.
Many of them thought that it
might bo difficult to adjust to
returning to America where this
situation would be greatly
changed.
Now only about 20 per cent are
interviewed personally by the
psychiatrists, and often only for
the psychiatrists' interest. 'Two
years ago we were interested in
the impact psychology would
have on the Peace Corps, now
we're interested in the reverse

case," English said. "Psychia
trists are rediscovering how
healthy the majority of college
students are." He added that ap
plicants are never disqualified be
cause they have sought mental
help during college, as this may
merely signify that they have
come to grips with inevitable emo
tional problems of college.
Dr. English, who has worked
with the Peace Corps since June
1962, is its first full-time Chief of
Psychiatry, and is "on loan" from
the National Institute of Mental
Health, His chief assistant is Dr.
Walter Menninger, a member of
Menninger Clinic and a Stanford
graduate. The staff includes 160
psychiatrists around the country
who act as consultants for th e
training sites.
