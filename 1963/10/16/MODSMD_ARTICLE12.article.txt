# Panel Questions Implications Of Rise of Interest in Religion
## 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
Given the fact that religion in
general has become more vital
to Stanford students in the last
few years, should religious in
struction be allowed on campus?
Should buildings for worship
other than that conducted in Me
morial Church be allowed on cam
pus? What does "non-sectarian
ism" as stated in the founding
grant imply?
These were among the ques
tions discussed last night by the
panel discussion on "Religious
Programs at Stanford."
That there has definitely lieen
a trend toward increased religi
ous interest was pointed out by
Good, who noted that the three
full-time faculty members for
the Curriculum of Religious
Study (part of the Special Pro
grams in Humanities) arc fairly
recent additions to the faculty,
which had previously contained
no religion professors as such.
Over 800 students were enrolled
in their classes last year, he said.
"THE ATMOSPHERE at Stan
ford now is very conducive to re
ligious activities," Minto added.
He said that there were now
about twelve independent minis
ters working on campus, and that,
in addition, the Council on Re
ligious Affairs is now a mechan
ism which guarantees to all stu
dent religious organizations the
right to present programs and
speakers or have meetings, on
campus.
Miss Strelitz agreed that the
religious organizations were quite
active, but raised the issue of
Stanford's being a non-sectarian
university, as is provided in the
founding grant.
It was agreed in discussion that
Memorial Church still claims to
be non-denominational, in accord
ance with the Grant, but is actu
ally Protestant. Good agreed with
several speakers from the audi
ence. that it should renounce its
claim to non-sectarianism, and if
this raises legal problems w i th
the Grant, 1o try and work out a
solution then.
"One must always respect the
founders' intentions . . . they
wanted a college essentially
Christian, but without the bick
ering be t we en denominations

that was then current," Hutchin
son said. He added that many of
the President's advisers concern
ing this policy felt that "non
sectarianism" could be inter
preted as "pan-sectarianism."
Wedin said that increased aca
demic study and activity of religi
ous organizations were not
enough to satisfy this increased
interest of religion on campus;
worship should accompany these,
he said. Which would be the
more equitable solution, to facili
tate complete on-campus freedom
of religion, or to go to the other
extreme? He noted that the im
plications of both possibilities
were complex, but said that the
idea of a university as an open
forum seemed to imply that stu
dents uncommitted to any re
ligion be in proximity to the wor
ship of various faiths.
Wedin brought up the question
of the university being allowed
to give instruction on campus.
Hutchinson explained that, strict
ly speaking, students' feeling that
instruction should be provided is
not a religious issue, but an aca
demic one; they should request
the dean, for example, or a class
in Comparative Religion.
