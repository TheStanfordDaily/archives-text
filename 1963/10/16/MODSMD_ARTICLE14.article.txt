# Death Takes Her Poet -Jean Cocteau
## 
### PROF. JEAN ONIMUS Visiting Professor of French 
(Editor's Nole: Less than a week ago, the death of singer Edith
Piaf and her friend Jean Cocteau were announced within a few
hours of each other. The Daily asked visiting professor Jean Oni
mus to analyze the meaning of this to the world of literature.)
The death of Jean Cocteau was, like his life itself, strangely
poetic; when he heard that his friend, the chanteuse, Edith (La
Mome) Piaf, had died, he was so upset that he lay down and closed
his eyes. In a few seconds, he was dead. Sensitive to the point of
neuroticism, Cocteau had long been haunted by the idea of death,
his own death. This was the lasting theme of his literary work, and
the one which gives it a genuine human quality.
It is true that in many ways Cocteau was an artist full of whimsy,
lacking in substance and depth. Nature endowed him with too many
different talents, and he became in turn, with disconcerting ease, a
novelist, a dramatist, a poet, an artist and a creator of films, play
ing on all the strings of his lyre at once. It might not be too para
odxical to say he unswervingly followed the "avant-garde," trying
symbolist drama: L'Aigle a deux tetes (The Two-Headed Eagle),
intricate plot-comedy: La Machine a Eerire (The Typewriter), sur
realistic farce: Les Maries de la Tour Eiffel (The Married Couple
on the Eiffel Tower), and even classic tragedy: Antigone, and always
in an ultra-modern style.
THERE WERE MANY facades or facets to Cocteau; what, one
wonders, did they hide? When one tried to grasp him, he pirouetted
away and changed his mask: a "baroque" artist, if ever there was
one! Yet his first novels (Les Enlants Terribles, Les Parents Ter
ribles) reveal painful experiences, a conscience full of complexes
and anguish. Even when he tries to make us laugh, as he does in
the story of poor Thomas rimposteur (Thomas the Impostor), he
brings tears to our eyes. In short, taken as a whole, his works are
ambiguous, much like the periods they reflect, and as a eonseqeunce,
appear slightly dated from having attempted in every instance to
conform to current tastes.
Cocteau remains one of the great poets of death. Whole collec
tions, for example Clair-Obscur, are devoted to the subject. He made
Death one of his characters, conversing with it, seeing it in the great
dark eyes of Maria Casares.
His films (I'Eternel Retour, and I,a Belle et; la Bete) may be
somewhat facile and contrived, but Orphee is a masterpiece into
which Cocteau poured his whole being. In this film we feel a soul
trembling before the invisible. This nearness of the Beyond lends
to real life a strangeness which is the poetic secret of Cocteau.
WE WOULD BE wrong to dismiss his drawings and paintings
because they were the work of a literary man. He was an admirable
draftsman (actually more an illustrator, a decorator than a painter).
The chapel of Villefranche, the wedding room in the town hall at
Menton, and his own home in Beaulieu are harmoniously successful,
only slightly impaired by that demon of the bizarre he bore within
him.
For those who knew him Cocteau will be remembered as a charm
ing, kind man who was generous with the young poets and students
who came in throngs to visit him. Yet his glance always seemed to
reach beyond you. to be fascinated by something else, far away, out
of the world, and whatever it was he saw seemed to fill him with
anguish. Death that he feared so much was gentle with her poet.
She took him in her arms like a sleeping child.

She took him in her arms like a sleeping child.
(Editor's Nole: Less than a week ago, the death of singer Edith
Piaf and her friend Jean Cocteau were announced within a few
hours of each other. The Daily asked visiting professor Jean Oni
mus to analyze the meaning of this to the world of literature.)
The death of Jean Cocteau was, like his life itself, strangely
poetic; when he heard that his friend, the chanteuse, Edith (La
Mome) Piaf, had died, he was so upset that he lay down and closed
his eyes. In a few seconds, he was dead. Sensitive to the point of
neuroticism, Cocteau had long been haunted by the idea of death,
his own death. This was the lasting theme of his literary work, and
the one which gives it a genuine human quality.
It is true that in many ways Cocteau was an artist full of whimsy,
lacking in substance and depth. Nature endowed him with too many
different talents, and he became in turn, with disconcerting ease, a
novelist, a dramatist, a poet, an artist and a creator of films, play
ing on all the strings of his lyre at once. It might not be too para
odxical to say he unswervingly followed the "avant-garde," trying
symbolist drama: L'Aigle a deux tetes (The Two-Headed Eagle),
intricate plot-comedy: La Machine a Eerire (The Typewriter), sur
realistic farce: Les Maries de la Tour Eiffel (The Married Couple
on the Eiffel Tower), and even classic tragedy: Antigone, and always
in an ultra-modern style.
THERE WERE MANY facades or facets to Cocteau; what, one
wonders, did they hide? When one tried to grasp him, he pirouetted
away and changed his mask: a "baroque" artist, if ever there was
one! Yet his first novels (Les Enlants Terribles, Les Parents Ter
ribles) reveal painful experiences, a conscience full of complexes
and anguish. Even when he tries to make us laugh, as he does in
the story of poor Thomas rimposteur (Thomas the Impostor), he
brings tears to our eyes. In short, taken as a whole, his works are
ambiguous, much like the periods they reflect, and as a eonseqeunce,
appear slightly dated from having attempted in every instance to
conform to current tastes.
Cocteau remains one of the great poets of death. Whole collec
tions, for example Clair-Obscur, are devoted to the subject. He made
Death one of his characters, conversing with it, seeing it in the great
dark eyes of Maria Casares.
His films (I'Eternel Retour, and I,a Belle et; la Bete) may be
somewhat facile and contrived, but Orphee is a masterpiece into
which Cocteau poured his whole being. In this film we feel a soul
trembling before the invisible. This nearness of the Beyond lends
to real life a strangeness which is the poetic secret of Cocteau.
WE WOULD BE wrong to dismiss his drawings and paintings
because they were the work of a literary man. He was an admirable
draftsman (actually more an illustrator, a decorator than a painter).
The chapel of Villefranche, the wedding room in the town hall at
Menton, and his own home in Beaulieu are harmoniously successful,
only slightly impaired by that demon of the bizarre he bore within
him.
For those who knew him Cocteau will be remembered as a charm
ing, kind man who was generous with the young poets and students
who came in throngs to visit him. Yet his glance always seemed to
reach beyond you. to be fascinated by something else, far away, out
of the world, and whatever it was he saw seemed to fill him with
anguish. Death that he feared so much was gentle with her poet.
