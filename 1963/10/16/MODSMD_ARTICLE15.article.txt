FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD
Editor, The Daily:
After filling out a question
naire on the Fundamental Stand
ard tonight, I reread part of the
"Stanford Handbook" to learn ex
actly what this code of conduct
is. The second paragraph on page
16 left me with an impression
which I'm sure the writer did not
intend. The paragraph reads,
"The problem of liquor needs
particular consideration. Univer
sity rules and traditions prohibit
possession of any intoxicating
liquors in University buildings,
dormitories, fraternities, living
areas, or grounds. However, dis
turbances of order and privacy
and destruction of property,
which result from intoxication,
will be considered a violation of
the Fundamental Standard."
The word "however" leaves the
implication (it almost seems as
though a sentence actually say
ing it has been deleted), that
drinking does take place on cam
pus, and, in accordance with the
Fundamental Standard, is ig
nored unless "disturbances of or
der and privacy and destruction
of property" result from it. If
my deduction from this para
graph is correct, then the Funda
mental Standard is obviously be
ing upheld very well.
If the writer meant that de
structiveness resulting from in
toxication which took place off
campus is a violation, this should
be obvious. Any destructiveness
would be a violation, regardless
of the cause.
I suggest that this paragraph
be rewritten so that it will give
a better understanding of the
Fundamental Standard. If stu
dents are going to uphold the
Fundamental Standard, they
must understand, and this para
graph certainly left one student
with a misconception.

Editor, The Daily:
I have just come from what
is probably the most revolting ex
perience 1 can imagine. I have
just witnessed what is proclaimed
to be the intellectual cream of
young American manhood behav
ing in a manner that would make
the most foulmouthed of men,
the language of the most hard
ened criminals seem clean and
delicate by comparison.
The occasion was the showing
of the film "Barabbas" at the Me
morial Auditorium on Sunday
night.
It is disgusting enough when
these scum make so much noise
with their inane screams and
squeals and whistles that the dia
logue of the cartoons cannot be
heard — this may even be a bless
ing. It may even be that such
voluble verbalizations may be per
missible during the showing of a
story attempting to portray some
of the frailties of our supposedly
democratic government — as hap
pened during the showing of "Ad
vice and Consent" two weeks ago.
But, I must, draw the line of
reasonableness when ridicule and
abuse is heaped on the head of
Christ even while he is being
crowned with the thorns; I must
plead for an end to such pro

fanation as the jeers and catcalls
which accompanied the scenes of
Christ carrying the cross, during
His time of agony on the cross.
Picture this: The stone has been
rolled away from the tomb. Christ
is gone. Barabbas says, "Where
has He gone?" And, one of our
future leaders of man shouts out,
"On an Easter egg hunt!" Which,
of course was greeted with gales
of laughter.
Is it germane to mention that
there were children present
(these measured by their chrono
logical. not their emotional age)?
Is it relevant to say that there
were ladies present? (Girlish gig
gles in response to the masculine
debasement leaves doubt as to
what proportion of the females
present were ladies.)
I hold that this is not accept
able conduct for Stanford s t u
dents. I believe that a student
body which will condone and al
low to continue conduct of this
nature is in no way entitled to
the greater intellectual and be
havorial freedoms which they
have so mournfully cried for in
recent issues of The Daily. I en
courage the students themselves
to put a stop to these abominible
displays of sacrilige and desecra
tion, even as they chastised the
card-thrower at the UCLA game;
failing this, I strongly urge Presi
dent Sterling and his staff to see
that this senseless, disgusting, im
mature behavior is ended.
Freedom of speech is a basic
American right. It can be —and
has been—carried too far.

INTERNATIONAL CENTER
Editor, The Daily:
We were glad to see your re
cent article introducing the new
Bechtel International Student
Center to the campus. However,
to correct one possible misinter
pretation: the Bechtel Center is
for all students, both American
and foreign, (as well as for the
wider Stanford community). We
are internationals all. As one re
cently arrived foreign students
put it on her third day at Stan
ford: "I have not met an Ameri
can student yet who has not been
abroad, or plans to go soon."

POOR TASTE
Editor, The Daily:
As I work for the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center I have
the opportunity to read your
paper daily. Usually it is well
done, and in good taste, however
I noticed a headline in Wednes
day's paper which I feel merits
strong negative criticism. It was
on the front page, and read "Vol
unteers Entertain Psychotics."
Psychotic is defined by Webster
as 'serious mental derangement,'
and I question whether the per
sons referred to all fall into this
category. Even if they do, I am
sure if you were one of this
group you would hardly be im
pressed to read of yourself as
psychotic. The term patient, is
most commonly used by those
within and outside mental insti
tutions. I hope in future articles
your paper will show better taste.

of the frailties of our supposedly
democratic government — as hap
pened during the showing of "Ad
vice and Consent" two weeks ago.
But, I must, draw the line of
reasonableness when ridicule and
abuse is heaped on the head of
Christ even while he is being
crowned with the thorns; I must
plead for an end to such pro

fanation as the jeers and catcalls
which accompanied the scenes of
Christ carrying the cross, during
His time of agony on the cross.
Picture this: The stone has been
rolled away from the tomb. Christ
is gone. Barabbas says, "Where
has He gone?" And, one of our
future leaders of man shouts out,
"On an Easter egg hunt!" Which,
of course was greeted with gales
of laughter.
Is it germane to mention that
there were children present
(these measured by their chrono
logical. not their emotional age)?
Is it relevant to say that there
were ladies present? (Girlish gig
gles in response to the masculine
debasement leaves doubt as to
what proportion of the females
present were ladies.)
I hold that this is not accept
able conduct for Stanford s t u
dents. I believe that a student
body which will condone and al
low to continue conduct of this
nature is in no way entitled to
the greater intellectual and be
havorial freedoms which they
have so mournfully cried for in
recent issues of The Daily. I en
courage the students themselves
to put a stop to these abominible
displays of sacrilige and desecra

card-thrower at the UCLA game;
failing this, I strongly urge Presi

that this senseless, disgusting, im
mature behavior is ended.
Freedom of speech is a basic
American right. It can be —and

Editor, The Daily:
As I work for the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center I have
the opportunity to read your
paper daily. Usually it is well
done, and in good taste, however
I noticed a headline in Wednes
day's paper which I feel merits
strong negative criticism. It was
on the front page, and read "Vol
unteers Entertain Psychotics."
Psychotic is defined by Webster
as 'serious mental derangement,'
and I question whether the per
sons referred to all fall into this
category. Even if they do, I am
sure if you were one of this
group you would hardly be im
pressed to read of yourself as
psychotic. The term patient, is
most commonly used by those
within and outside mental insti

your paper will show better taste.

FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD
Editor, The Daily:
After filling out a question
naire on the Fundamental Stand
ard tonight, I reread part of the
"Stanford Handbook" to learn ex
actly what this code of conduct
is. The second paragraph on page
16 left me with an impression
which I'm sure the writer did not
intend. The paragraph reads,
"The problem of liquor needs
particular consideration. Univer
sity rules and traditions prohibit
possession of any intoxicating
liquors in University buildings,
dormitories, fraternities, living
areas, or grounds. However, dis
turbances of order and privacy
and destruction of property,
which result from intoxication,
will be considered a violation of
the Fundamental Standard."
The word "however" leaves the
implication (it almost seems as
though a sentence actually say
ing it has been deleted), that
drinking does take place on cam
pus, and, in accordance with the
Fundamental Standard, is ig
nored unless "disturbances of or
der and privacy and destruction
of property" result from it. If
my deduction from this para
graph is correct, then the Funda
mental Standard is obviously be
ing upheld very well.
If the writer meant that de
structiveness resulting from in
toxication which took place off
campus is a violation, this should
be obvious. Any destructiveness
would be a violation, regardless
of the cause.
I suggest that this paragraph
be rewritten so that it will give
a better understanding of the
Fundamental Standard. If stu
dents are going to uphold the
Fundamental Standard, they
must understand, and this para
graph certainly left one student
with a misconception.

Editor, The Daily:
As I work for the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center I have
the opportunity to read your
paper daily. Usually it is well
done, and in good taste, however
I noticed a headline in Wednes
day's paper which I feel merits
strong negative criticism. It was
on the front page, and read "Vol
unteers Entertain Psychotics."
Psychotic is defined by Webster
as 'serious mental derangement,'
and I question whether the per
sons referred to all fall into this
category. Even if they do, I am
sure if you were one of this
group you would hardly be im
pressed to read of yourself as
psychotic. The term patient, is
most commonly used by those
within and outside mental insti
tutions. I hope in future articles
your paper will show better taste.

FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD
Editor, The Daily:
After filling out a question
naire on the Fundamental Stand
ard tonight, I reread part of the
"Stanford Handbook" to learn ex
actly what this code of conduct
is. The second paragraph on page
16 left me with an impression
which I'm sure the writer did not
intend. The paragraph reads,
"The problem of liquor needs
particular consideration. Univer
sity rules and traditions prohibit
possession of any intoxicating
liquors in University buildings,
dormitories, fraternities, living
areas, or grounds. However, dis
turbances of order and privacy
and destruction of property,
which result from intoxication,
will be considered a violation of
the Fundamental Standard."
The word "however" leaves the
implication (it almost seems as
though a sentence actually say
ing it has been deleted), that
drinking does take place on cam
pus, and, in accordance with the
Fundamental Standard, is ig
nored unless "disturbances of or
der and privacy and destruction
of property" result from it. If
my deduction from this para
graph is correct, then the Funda
mental Standard is obviously be
ing upheld very well.
If the writer meant that de
structiveness resulting from in
toxication which took place off
campus is a violation, this should
be obvious. Any destructiveness
would be a violation, regardless
of the cause.
I suggest that this paragraph
be rewritten so that it will give
a better understanding of the
Fundamental Standard. If stu
dents are going to uphold the
Fundamental Standard, they
must understand, and this para
graph certainly left one student
with a misconception.

I have just come from what
is probably the most revolting ex
perience 1 can imagine. I have
just witnessed what is proclaimed
to be the intellectual cream of
young American manhood behav
ing in a manner that would make
the most foulmouthed of men,
the language of the most hard
ened criminals seem clean and
delicate by comparison.
The occasion was the showing
of the film "Barabbas" at the Me
morial Auditorium on Sunday
night.
It is disgusting enough when
these scum make so much noise
with their inane screams and
squeals and whistles that the dia
logue of the cartoons cannot be
heard — this may even be a bless
ing. It may even be that such
voluble verbalizations may be per
missible during the showing of a
story attempting to portray some
of the frailties of our supposedly
democratic government — as hap
pened during the showing of "Ad
vice and Consent" two weeks ago.
But, I must, draw the line of
reasonableness when ridicule and
abuse is heaped on the head of
Christ even while he is being
crowned with the thorns; I must
plead for an end to such pro

fanation as the jeers and catcalls
which accompanied the scenes of
Christ carrying the cross, during
His time of agony on the cross.
Picture this: The stone has been
rolled away from the tomb. Christ
is gone. Barabbas says, "Where
has He gone?" And, one of our
future leaders of man shouts out,
"On an Easter egg hunt!" Which,
of course was greeted with gales
of laughter.
Is it germane to mention that
there were children present
(these measured by their chrono
logical. not their emotional age)?
Is it relevant to say that there
were ladies present? (Girlish gig
gles in response to the masculine
debasement leaves doubt as to
what proportion of the females
present were ladies.)
I hold that this is not accept
able conduct for Stanford s t u
dents. I believe that a student
body which will condone and al
low to continue conduct of this
nature is in no way entitled to
the greater intellectual and be
havorial freedoms which they
have so mournfully cried for in
recent issues of The Daily. I en
courage the students themselves
to put a stop to these abominible
displays of sacrilige and desecra
tion, even as they chastised the
card-thrower at the UCLA game;
failing this, I strongly urge Presi
dent Sterling and his staff to see
that this senseless, disgusting, im
mature behavior is ended.

American right. It can be —and

I have just come from what
is probably the most revolting ex
perience 1 can imagine. I have
just witnessed what is proclaimed
to be the intellectual cream of
young American manhood behav
ing in a manner that would make
the most foulmouthed of men,
the language of the most hard
ened criminals seem clean and
delicate by comparison.
The occasion was the showing
of the film "Barabbas" at the Me
morial Auditorium on Sunday
night.
It is disgusting enough when
these scum make so much noise
with their inane screams and
squeals and whistles that the dia
logue of the cartoons cannot be
heard — this may even be a bless
ing. It may even be that such
voluble verbalizations may be per
missible during the showing of a
story attempting to portray some
of the frailties of our supposedly
democratic government — as hap
pened during the showing of "Ad
vice and Consent" two weeks ago.
But, I must, draw the line of
reasonableness when ridicule and
abuse is heaped on the head of
Christ even while he is being
crowned with the thorns; I must
plead for an end to such pro

fanation as the jeers and catcalls
which accompanied the scenes of
Christ carrying the cross, during
His time of agony on the cross.
Picture this: The stone has been
rolled away from the tomb. Christ
is gone. Barabbas says, "Where
has He gone?" And, one of our
future leaders of man shouts out,
"On an Easter egg hunt!" Which,
of course was greeted with gales
of laughter.
Is it germane to mention that
there were children present
(these measured by their chrono
logical. not their emotional age)?
Is it relevant to say that there
were ladies present? (Girlish gig
gles in response to the masculine
debasement leaves doubt as to
what proportion of the females
present were ladies.)
I hold that this is not accept
able conduct for Stanford s t u
dents. I believe that a student
body which will condone and al
low to continue conduct of this
nature is in no way entitled to
the greater intellectual and be
havorial freedoms which they
have so mournfully cried for in
recent issues of The Daily. I en
courage the students themselves
to put a stop to these abominible
displays of sacrilige and desecra
tion, even as they chastised the
card-thrower at the UCLA game;
failing this, I strongly urge Presi
dent Sterling and his staff to see
that this senseless, disgusting, im
mature behavior is ended.
Freedom of speech is a basic
American right. It can be —and
has been—carried too far.

INTERNATIONAL CENTER
Editor, The Daily:
We were glad to see your re
cent article introducing the new
Bechtel International Student
Center to the campus. However,
to correct one possible misinter
pretation: the Bechtel Center is
for all students, both American
and foreign, (as well as for the
wider Stanford community). We
are internationals all. As one re
cently arrived foreign students
put it on her third day at Stan
ford: "I have not met an Ameri
can student yet who has not been
abroad, or plans to go soon."

POOR TASTE
Editor, The Daily:
As I work for the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center I have
the opportunity to read your
paper daily. Usually it is well
done, and in good taste, however
I noticed a headline in Wednes
day's paper which I feel merits
strong negative criticism. It was
on the front page, and read "Vol
unteers Entertain Psychotics."
Psychotic is defined by Webster
as 'serious mental derangement,'
and I question whether the per
sons referred to all fall into this
category. Even if they do, I am
sure if you were one of this
group you would hardly be im
pressed to read of yourself as
psychotic. The term patient, is
most commonly used by those
within and outside mental insti
tutions. I hope in future articles
your paper will show better taste.
