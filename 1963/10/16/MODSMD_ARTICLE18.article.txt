'BIRCHLR?*
Editor, The Daily:
II has been called to our atten
tion that the announcement of
the Civil Rights Debate held
October 7 misspelled Mr. Donati's
name and identified him as a
"John Bireher." The name is
spelled DONATI, not Lonati. He
is not a member of the John
Birch Society if this is what you
meant to infer. However, many
of his friends are members of the
.John Birch Society and he has
great respect and admiration for
them. You might say that he is
a "fellow traveller."
He was delighted to have the
opportunity to speak. He was
speaking as an individual and
not as Chairman of the Liberty
Amendment Committee of Cali
j fornia.
We would appreciate correction
! of the mis-label.
â€”DON R. PIGGOTT
Coordinator,
Liberty Amendment
Committee of Calif.
