... Some notes about you, about
us, and the advertising business

About you. If you are the man we seek: You have an
abiding curiosity about people and the world around you.
You're alert and responsive to new ideas, new ways of doing
things. You like to take on new problems ... you see them as
opportunities.
You dig deep into the ivhy of things. And the best answers
you can come up with today are never good enough for you
tomorrow.
You're an individualist. Yet you thrive on team spirit.
You have conviction about freedom of choice, consistent
with the rights of others.
You're the kind of man who could be successful in business
for himself, but you see the greater challenge implicit in the
major enterprises of today's world.
About US. The J. Walter Thompson Company was formed
99 years ago. It has for many years been the largest advertis
ing firm; its stock is owned by more than live hundred active
stafT members.
We help over 500 companies in the United States and
abroad sell thousands of products and services to hundreds of
millions of people. Last year alone, we were responsible for the
advertising investment of over one-third of a billion dollars.
There are 6,800 people working wit h Thompson around the
world. Our backgrounds range far and wide. And so do our
assignments: writing, art, market research, media buying, TV
and radio, styling, marketing and merchandising, music and
the theatre, engineering, accounting and statistical analysis,
international business, and the social sciences are only part
of the list.

In our experience, superior individuals from every graduate and
undergraduate educational discipline find successful careers
in a major agency such as the Thompson Company. Staff
members in our New York Office alone represent nearly 300
colleges and universities here and abroad.
Your career with us. You may be surprised to learn
that while an advertising company must have artistically cre
ative people, it depends just as much on people who are imagi
native and inventive in other ways.
Our business is selling. Communicating through the written
and spoken word is hoiv we sell. You must possess the ability
to speak and write well so your ideas may be shared and
understood.
We are looking for the kind of men who wish and are able to
assume substantial responsibility early in their business lives.
To such men we offer a remarkable chance to grow and develop
—one seldom found in any firm.
Previous advertising experience is not required. Basically,
our interest is in the nature of a person, and not in his special
ized knowledge and abilities.
We offer you no standard starting salary, no cut-and-dried
training program. Beginning salaries are individually con
sidered and compare favorably to those of other national firms.
We help you tailor your own development program, based on
your interests, your abilities, your goals. Your program will
differ from other men's programs just as you differ from
other men.
When you join us you will work side by side with experi
enced advertising men. Your growth will be based on your own
initiative, your own development. There are no age or senior
ity requirements to limit the responsibility you can earn.
We encourage you to follow your curiosity into all phases of
advertising, because we want you to become a well-rounded
practitioner as rapidly as possible. Experienced advertising
men are eager to coach you individually in your efforts to
develop your capabilities. Additionally, you are free to delve
into every nook and cranny of advertising through our
annual series of twenty professional seminars, workshops and
classes. You learn from men who are experts in their fields.
About men who join us. Eight out of ten college men
who have joined us in the past decade have remained with us
and are enjoying varied, exciting careers.
Because of our emphasis on early growth, relatively young
men commonly handle major responsibilities in many phases
of our business—in New York and throughout the world.
All initial assignments are in New York City. However,
there are many offices throughout the United States and the
world to which you may, if interested, request assignment
later on.
If you wish to be a candidate, you must be in a position to join
us between January 1,1961+ and June 1,1965. You may obtain
further information at the placement office. Please consult
with them regarding the possibility of a personal interview.
We will be on campus October 30 and 31.
