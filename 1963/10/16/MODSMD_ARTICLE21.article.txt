# Upsets Highlight AAWU Weekend Play; Ragsdale Keeps Conference Scoring Lead
## Daily Sports 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO — As the'
1963 season approaches the mid
point, the most readily apparent
fact is that it has been one of j
upsets and surprises.
One surprise is that after four
weeks of play, all of the AAWU
elevens have suffered at least two j
defeats. Second, any time a team
lets it be known that it sports
;tn unbeaten record you can be
sure its demise is only one Satur-

day away.
This week's action includes an
important league contest. Stan
ford's Indians invade Seattle to
battle the rejuvenated Huskies,
and the winner could emerge as
a tille threat. Stanford needs a
win to stay in the race, as it al
ready suffered a league loss to
UCLA. Washington would jump
into a first-place tie with UCLA,
and very much into title conten
tion with a win.
USC DRAWS a tough assign
ment as tho defending National
Champions seek to* bounce back
from last week's close loss. An
inability to catch the ball has
severely damaged Troy's fine
passing attack and slowed the
Trojan offense. UCLA also gets a
toughie. the Notre Dame team
that dumped USC, again at South
Bend.
Two AAWU individual statisti
cal leads changed hands as a re
sult of play during the fourth
weekend of the 19(33 season.
ERNIE JONES of USC, defend
ing AAWU punting champion,
grabbed the lead in that depart
ment by posting a 41.1 average,
while last week's leader Bob
James of WSU had a bad week
end and slipped to 38.1.
In total offense and passing,
Cal's brilliant junior giant Craig
Morton padded his lead with a
dra/.zling offensive show against
Duke. He upped his total offense
to 533 yards, and jacked his pass
ing marks to 44 completions for
581 yards and four touchdowns.
Fourteen of the completions, 205
yards and two touchdowns came
Saturday against the Blue Devils.
Clarence Williams of WSU

maintained his big lead in rush
ing, with his season's marks now
350 yards on GO carries for a 5.8
average.
Die K KAGSDALE of Stanford
clung to his scoring lead, even
though he did not score a single
point for the second straight
week. Cal's Jack Schraub has
moved into a challenging position
with 20 points, two other players
i\VQ close with IS.

SAN FRANCISCO — As the'
1963 season approaches the mid
point, the most readily apparent
fact is that it has been one of j
upsets and surprises.
One surprise is that after four
weeks of play, all of the AAWU
elevens have suffered at least two j
defeats. Second, any time a team
lets it be known that it sports
;tn unbeaten record you can be
sure its demise is only one Satur-

day away.
This week's action includes an
important league contest. Stan
ford's Indians invade Seattle to
battle the rejuvenated Huskies,
and the winner could emerge as
a tille threat. Stanford needs a
win to stay in the race, as it al
ready suffered a league loss to
UCLA. Washington would jump
into a first-place tie with UCLA,
and very much into title conten
tion with a win.
USC DRAWS a tough assign
ment as tho defending National
Champions seek to* bounce back
from last week's close loss. An
inability to catch the ball has
severely damaged Troy's fine
passing attack and slowed the
Trojan offense. UCLA also gets a
toughie. the Notre Dame team
that dumped USC, again at South
Bend.
Two AAWU individual statisti
cal leads changed hands as a re
sult of play during the fourth
weekend of the 19(33 season.
ERNIE JONES of USC, defend
ing AAWU punting champion,
grabbed the lead in that depart
ment by posting a 41.1 average,
while last week's leader Bob
James of WSU had a bad week
end and slipped to 38.1.
In total offense and passing,
Cal's brilliant junior giant Craig
Morton padded his lead with a
dra/.zling offensive show against
Duke. He upped his total offense
to 533 yards, and jacked his pass
ing marks to 44 completions for
581 yards and four touchdowns.
Fourteen of the completions, 205
yards and two touchdowns came
Saturday against the Blue Devils.
Clarence Williams of WSU

maintained his big lead in rush
ing, with his season's marks now
350 yards on GO carries for a 5.8
average.
Die K KAGSDALE of Stanford
clung to his scoring lead, even
though he did not score a single
point for the second straight
week. Cal's Jack Schraub has
moved into a challenging position
with 20 points, two other players

SAN FRANCISCO — As the'
1963 season approaches the mid
point, the most readily apparent
fact is that it has been one of j
upsets and surprises.
One surprise is that after four
weeks of play, all of the AAWU
elevens have suffered at least two j
defeats. Second, any time a team
lets it be known that it sports
;tn unbeaten record you can be
sure its demise is only one Satur-

day away.
This week's action includes an
important league contest. Stan
ford's Indians invade Seattle to
battle the rejuvenated Huskies,
and the winner could emerge as
a tille threat. Stanford needs a
win to stay in the race, as it al
ready suffered a league loss to
UCLA. Washington would jump
into a first-place tie with UCLA,
and very much into title conten
tion with a win.
USC DRAWS a tough assign
ment as tho defending National
Champions seek to* bounce back
from last week's close loss. An
inability to catch the ball has
severely damaged Troy's fine
passing attack and slowed the
Trojan offense. UCLA also gets a
toughie. the Notre Dame team
that dumped USC, again at South
Bend.
Two AAWU individual statisti
cal leads changed hands as a re
sult of play during the fourth
weekend of the 19(33 season.
ERNIE JONES of USC, defend
ing AAWU punting champion,
grabbed the lead in that depart
ment by posting a 41.1 average,
while last week's leader Bob
James of WSU had a bad week
end and slipped to 38.1.
In total offense and passing,
Cal's brilliant junior giant Craig
Morton padded his lead with a
dra/.zling offensive show against
Duke. He upped his total offense
to 533 yards, and jacked his pass
ing marks to 44 completions for
581 yards and four touchdowns.
Fourteen of the completions, 205
yards and two touchdowns came
Saturday against the Blue Devils.
Clarence Williams of WSU

maintained his big lead in rush
ing, with his season's marks now
350 yards on GO carries for a 5.8
average.
Die K KAGSDALE of Stanford
clung to his scoring lead, even
though he did not score a single
point for the second straight
week. Cal's Jack Schraub has
moved into a challenging position
with 20 points, two other players

SAN FRANCISCO — As the'
1963 season approaches the mid
point, the most readily apparent
fact is that it has been one of j
upsets and surprises.
One surprise is that after four
weeks of play, all of the AAWU
elevens have suffered at least two j
defeats. Second, any time a team
lets it be known that it sports
;tn unbeaten record you can be
sure its demise is only one Satur-

day away.
This week's action includes an
important league contest. Stan
ford's Indians invade Seattle to
battle the rejuvenated Huskies,
and the winner could emerge as
a tille threat. Stanford needs a
win to stay in the race, as it al
ready suffered a league loss to
UCLA. Washington would jump
into a first-place tie with UCLA,
and very much into title conten
tion with a win.
USC DRAWS a tough assign
ment as tho defending National
Champions seek to* bounce back
from last week's close loss. An
inability to catch the ball has
severely damaged Troy's fine
passing attack and slowed the
Trojan offense. UCLA also gets a
toughie. the Notre Dame team
that dumped USC, again at South
Bend.
Two AAWU individual statisti
cal leads changed hands as a re
sult of play during the fourth
weekend of the 19(33 season.
ERNIE JONES of USC, defend
ing AAWU punting champion,
grabbed the lead in that depart
ment by posting a 41.1 average,
while last week's leader Bob
James of WSU had a bad week
end and slipped to 38.1.
In total offense and passing,
Cal's brilliant junior giant Craig
Morton padded his lead with a
dra/.zling offensive show against
Duke. He upped his total offense
to 533 yards, and jacked his pass
ing marks to 44 completions for
581 yards and four touchdowns.
Fourteen of the completions, 205
yards and two touchdowns came
Saturday against the Blue Devils.
Clarence Williams of WSU

maintained his big lead in rush
ing, with his season's marks now
350 yards on GO carries for a 5.8
average.
Die K KAGSDALE of Stanford
clung to his scoring lead, even
though he did not score a single
point for the second straight
week. Cal's Jack Schraub has
moved into a challenging position
with 20 points, two other players

SAN FRANCISCO — As the'
1963 season approaches the mid
point, the most readily apparent
fact is that it has been one of j
upsets and surprises.
One surprise is that after four
weeks of play, all of the AAWU
elevens have suffered at least two j
defeats. Second, any time a team
lets it be known that it sports
;tn unbeaten record you can be
sure its demise is only one Satur-

day away.
This week's action includes an
important league contest. Stan
ford's Indians invade Seattle to
battle the rejuvenated Huskies,
and the winner could emerge as
a tille threat. Stanford needs a
win to stay in the race, as it al
ready suffered a league loss to
UCLA. Washington would jump
into a first-place tie with UCLA,
and very much into title conten
tion with a win.
USC DRAWS a tough assign
ment as tho defending National
Champions seek to* bounce back
from last week's close loss. An
inability to catch the ball has
severely damaged Troy's fine
passing attack and slowed the
Trojan offense. UCLA also gets a
toughie. the Notre Dame team
that dumped USC, again at South
Bend.
Two AAWU individual statisti
cal leads changed hands as a re
sult of play during the fourth
weekend of the 19(33 season.
ERNIE JONES of USC, defend
ing AAWU punting champion,
grabbed the lead in that depart
ment by posting a 41.1 average,
while last week's leader Bob
James of WSU had a bad week
end and slipped to 38.1.
In total offense and passing,
Cal's brilliant junior giant Craig
Morton padded his lead with a
dra/.zling offensive show against
Duke. He upped his total offense
to 533 yards, and jacked his pass
ing marks to 44 completions for
581 yards and four touchdowns.
Fourteen of the completions, 205
yards and two touchdowns came
Saturday against the Blue Devils.
Clarence Williams of WSU

maintained his big lead in rush
ing, with his season's marks now
350 yards on GO carries for a 5.8
average.
Die K KAGSDALE of Stanford
clung to his scoring lead, even
though he did not score a single
point for the second straight
week. Cal's Jack Schraub has
moved into a challenging position
with 20 points, two other players
i\VQ close with IS.
