Dr. Albert Elsen will present
a lecture, "On Being of Our
Time," tonight at 8 p.m. in Room
320, the first in a series of four
lectures on the modernity of mod
ern art.
According to Dr. Elsen, "The
point of these four lectures is to J
demonstrate the intimate con
nection between modern art and j
the time and place of its origin.
To counter the view that modern
artists have been indifferent to
life, a group of themes has been
chosen to show their involvement
with life and death, daily living,
the experiences of the senses,
mind, and feelings. To help the
public understand the "modern
ity" of the art done in the last
hundred years, contrasts will be
made with the painting and sculp i
ture of the past in terms of both j
form and content."
