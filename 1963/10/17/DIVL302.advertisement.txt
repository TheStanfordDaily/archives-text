"NATURAL" MAN AND "SPIRITUAL" MAN
"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the
heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that
love him. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit
of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can be known
them, for they are spiritually discerned." I Cor. 2:9, 14.
What is "natural" man? He is the product of physical birthâ€”
anyone who has been born into the world with endowments of
human nature. Many wonderful capabilities are given to us by
our physical birth, but one painful deficiency is apparent. "Nat
ural" man lacks the capacity to understand spiritual realities.
"They are foolishness unto him." Indeed, he cannot know them,
the Bible says, because they can only be "spiritually discerned."
To become aware of the things of God requires a spiritual birth.
This happens to anyone who acknowledges Jesus Christ as God
and Saviour. Along with this spiritual birth and regeneration
comes the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit which indwells
each believer and brings him to a knowledge of God. "He will
guide you into all truth" (John 16:13) and perfect you so that
you grow up into "the stature of the fulness of Christ." (Eph.
4 :13). You, the reader can actually experience this spiritual birth.
All that is required is simple faith in Jesus Christ.
