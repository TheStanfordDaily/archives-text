### 
United Press International
WASHINGTON Despite Negro cries of "sellout," Atty. Gen.
Robert F. Kennedy won major support yesterday in his drive to
soften a House civil rights bill as a step toward pushing it through
Congress.
Chairman Emanuel Celler, D-N.Y., of the Mouse Judiciary Com
mittee agreed with Kennedy that tlie bill would have to be toned
down to win more bipartisan backing. As drafted by a judiciary
subcommittee, the bill is stronger than the administration proposed.
As Kennedy had expected, he was the immediate target of Negro
leaders. Clarence Mitchell, Washington director of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, told newsmen:
"It's a shame. There's no reason for this kind of sellout."
Appearing at Ihe capiial as Kennedy testified for tin 4 second day
before Celler s committee, Mitchell said civil rights forces had polled
the 1 louse and Senate and found enough support to pass the bill
the atlorney general feared would be defeated.
Kennedy particularly opposed a section in ihe bill that would
give ihe Justice Department blanket authority to start lawsuits in
any alleged violation of civil rights, racial or otherwise. He said
this could upset the federal-state balance of power and lead to crea
tion of a national police force.

In Algiers, the government of President Ahmed Ben Bella an
nounced that 10.000 volunteers and 2,300 reservists have been mo

U.S. DOMINICAN RELATIONS WORSEN SANTA DOMINGO,
Dominican Republic Dominican leaders reacted indignantly to a
United States "suggestion" they turn the government back to the
ousted Bosch regime.
The new civilian junta termed the suggestion "unusual." Political
leader Viriato Fiallo, a long-time friend of the United States, called it
"unwise and stupid."
Fiallo accused the United States of "seeking to establish another
Cuba" in the Dominican Republic. "We will die before we let them
do it,"he added.
In Washington, the State Department denied the charge.
