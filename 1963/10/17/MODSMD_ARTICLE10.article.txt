# Ole Miss Faculty Protests University News Release
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
'I'he University of Mississippi Chapter of the American Associa
tion of University Professors recently sent a letter to the Chancellor
of the University deploring and challenging a release from the Uni
versity News Service which minimized the effect of racial strife
upon the school.
The letter lias not been made public, but the Daily has been given
access to it. The news service article in question was reprinted in
the Monday, October 1-4 Daily, under the headline "Ole Miss Enjoys

-♦■Productive Year despite Racial
I Troubles."
TIIE ARTICLE stated "Most of
j the Northern Press launched an
| anti-Ole Miss campaign. . . ." The
| letter states that little if any evi
j donee was seen of this by the
! members of the chapter. The
chapter felt that a condemnation
of injustice is not to be inter
preted as a campaign against the
institution at which it occurs.
The article stated that "news
media continued to pounce on
every insignificant mistake made
by a student." The chapter al
leged that its members had noted
wide play in the press only of un
lawful and intolerant acts on the
part of the wide students, cer
tainly something beyond the
sphere of pranks.
The author of the article stated
"almost all of the rioters were
outsiders. . . ." The reply of the
AAUP at Mississippi was that the
personal knowledge of the mem
bers, eye-witnesses at the riot,
deemed this statement simply un
true, and that its untruth is
widely known.
The Chapter deplored the omis
sion of all negative details: losses
of students and faculty members,
and the seriousness of these
losses.
THE CHAPTER felt that those
faculty members who had left
I were slurred in the article, that
! it was insinuated that they felt
for personal gain. The article
I noted "the vast majority of Ole
l Miss' Professors have refused
I more lucrative jobs. ..." Both
i this statement and the allegation
| that faculty members left for per-
I sonal gain were labeled false by
; the AAUP group.
The article was given the Daily
1 by a Stanford student after the
! Daily had requested an analysis
i of the theory that the University
of Mississippi had been killed by
racial strife. The article was
' identified in the Daily as being
I a release of the University of
| Mississippi News Service.
