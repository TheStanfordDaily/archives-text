# Committee for Non-Violence Requests JFK's Validation of 'Walk for Peace'
## 
### 
The Committee for Non-Violent
Action, sponsor of the Quebec-
Washington-Guantanamao Walk
for Peace, is now circulating
petitions addressed to President
Kennedy, asking for tho valida
tion for travel to Cuba of the
passports of the participants in
tho Walk for Peace.
The purpose of the walk, ac
cording to the committee, is to
spread the message of non-vio
lence. The motivation for the
walk is stated as "the earnest de
sire to help bring about better
relations between the United

States and Cuba, and thus hefp
insure longer life for all of us."
THE COMMITTEE believes that
both sides have made mistakes
in the Cuban crisis. Its literature
states that while United States
policy over the years has harmed
the Cuban people, hostile state
ments and Soviet troops in Cuba
have also featured resentment.
"When mutual resentment
reaches the point where it endang
ers the life of every man, woman
and child on earth, isn't it time
to ask how the situation can be
salvaged?" the committee pamph
let asks.
Petitions can be obtained from
the Committee for Nonviolent
Action, 32."5 Lafayette St., New
York 12. New York.
The petition requests validation
of the passports to Cuba on the
grounds that the walkers have a
message that the people of the
world must be permitted to hear;
that in order to be a champion
of civil liberties, the United
States must remove restrictions
on the political (i.e. right to
travel) rights of her own people;
and finally that communication
between peoples is necessary to
achieve peace.
