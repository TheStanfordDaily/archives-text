# Dr. Harman Evaluating Data from Hallucination-Producing Drug
## 
### BILLY WERTZ 
The effects of controversial,
mind-releasing LSD-25 are now
being studied on the Stanford
campus.
Dr. Willis \V. Harman, profes
sor of Electrical Engineering, is
one of a team of researchers
which is evaluating data from
tests given to patients before and
after they tunc undergone LSD
treatment.
Many stories concerning the
mystical sensations produced by
LSD h.ivc been prevalent in re
cent months. The dreams which
LSD invokes have been portrayed
as indescribably beautiful and
moving. Subjects who have been
under the drug's influence have
reported vivid and enchanting
world of intense, vibrant colors.

this sounds, LSD is not being
considered as the next replace
ment for color movies. The expe
rience of taking ihe drug is at
times beautiful, but in many in
stances it can also be shocking
and terrifying. The fact that
Canadian researchers report thai
none of their patients wanted to
repeat the LSD experience indi
cates that it is not always enjoy
able.
According to Dr. Harman, LSD
seems to "render ineffective the
mechanism in the mind which or
dinarily prevents psychic material
in the unconscious from coming
to awareness." The dreams in
duced by LSD have the effect of
allowing a person to detach a por
tion of his mind and actually see
his own unconscious thoughts.
The subject may re-live childhood
experiences 01 see his own re

pressed thoughts in his dream
like state. The subject is afforded
a unique glimpse into his sub
conscious mind, which, whether
it a mazes or shocks him, allows
him to gain a much clearer pic
ture of what he is really like.
"Seeing himself more wholly
and clearly than before," says
Harman, "a person may be
enabled to change himself in some
direction on the basis of this
insight."
When they can actually see the
reason behind their fears and
anxieties, many people are able
to abandon them entirely. In one
sense, this is the purpose of LSD.
It is an effective tool of psycho
therapy to clear away the feats,
yuilt complexes, frustrations, and
inhibitions which prevent many
people from living happily.
DR. HARMAN finds that many
people who seeni to have great

talent are unable to be successful
because of their emotional prob
lems. He feels that LSD may
ultimately be used to enable these
people to receive the greatest
benefit from their natural ability
and education.
"People in this country receive
a very good technical education,"
Harman says, "but this is often
wasted because of emotional
problems which prevent them
from realizing their full poten
tials." Early tests seem to in
dicate that LSD can be of signif
icant value in relieving these
mental tensions.
Harman and Professor Robert
Mogar of San Francisco State
College's Psychology Department
have just received an $11.000
grant from the Ittleson Family
Foundation for further LSD
study. Harman and Mogar will ex
plore tlie potentialities of LSD as

an educational experience for per
sons going into managerial and
professional positions. It is their
hope that LSD may ultimately be
used to develop such desirable
personality traits as a mature
sense of responsibility, objective
judgment, breadth of vision, and
creativity, which cannot be taught
directly.
Harman warns that LSD re
search is a relatively new field,
and that it will be some time be
i fore many of their goals are re
alized. But early tests show
promise, and they seem to in
dicate that LSD-2") is going to be
one of the most important drugs
ever developed for psychological
use, "We are such stuff as our

may one day show men exactly

people to receive the greatest
benefit from their natural ability
and education.
"People in this country receive
a very good technical education,"
Harman says, "but this is often
wasted because of emotional
problems which prevent them
from realizing their full poten
tials." Early tests seem to in
dicate that LSD can be of signif
icant value in relieving these
mental tensions.
Harman and Professor Robert
Mogar of San Francisco State
College's Psychology Department
have just received an $11.000
grant from the Ittleson Family
Foundation for further LSD
study. Harman and Mogar will ex
plore tlie potentialities of LSD as

an educational experience for per
sons going into managerial and
professional positions. It is their
hope that LSD may ultimately be
used to develop such desirable
personality traits as a mature
sense of responsibility, objective
judgment, breadth of vision, and
creativity, which cannot be taught
directly.
Harman warns that LSD re
search is a relatively new field,
and that it will be some time be
i fore many of their goals are re
alized. But early tests show
promise, and they seem to in
dicate that LSD-2") is going to be
one of the most important drugs
ever developed for psychological
use, "We are such stuff as our
dreams are made of," said Shakes
peare. It may be that LSD dreams
may one day show men exactly
what thev are mafle of. and even
