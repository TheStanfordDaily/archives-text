# Stanford Not Isolated From Discrimination
## 
### 
Fraternities and sororities on campuses throughout the
nation have been making headlines in their rebellion against
discrimination clauses. From Portland to Cal to Michigan
students have been saying they would rather depart from the
campus than lose their integral right to be unjust.
Stanford is not a part of these headlines. Two of our fra
ternities have gone local rather than conform to national dis
criminatory clauses. Those remaining have been given a
deadline by which to remove the offensive clauses or break
with the national; they are seemingly working with this dead
line.
We deserve, however, no large pat on the back. In cer
tain areas we are somewhat akin to the white-Anglo-Saxon-
Protestant northern community which condemns and feels
above the bigotry of Mississippi. The minority group popu
lation among Stanford undergraduates is so small that the
lack of discrimination problems here might merely be the
result of an isolated community.
Our admissions office states that it is trying to obtain a
wide spectrum of students, and indeed the current freshman
class seems to be somewhat less homogeneous than older
classes. However, until the Stanford community makes itself
appealing to a broader segment of the American student popu
lation, we remain in the thick of the discrimination problem.
