PEACE ( OKI'S INEQUITY
Editor, The Daily:
In connection with the informa
tion campaign about the Peace
Corps taking place this week on
campus, I think that a personal
experience of mine may be of in
terest to Stanford students who
are planning to become Volun
teers.
Last Juno, after graduating
from Columbia University as an
English major, I went to Ober
lin College, Ohio to start training
for the Peace Corps' secondary
education project slated to go to
Gabon, a new nation in former
French Equatorial Africa. Six
weeks later and halfway through
the program I was notified that
a Committee of Selection h a d
come to the decision to "sepa
rate* me from the organization.
I was given an airplane ticket
and was asked to leave ObcM'lin
within four hours.
I had no personal contact with
most of the members of the com
mittee,'which included the staff
psychologist and psychiatrist.
When asked the grounds upon
which the decision was based, the
Chief Selection Officer informed
me and the other trainees, as
well as the staff and faculty of
the program, that the committee's
deliberations were held in secret,
that appeal was impossible, and
that he was under no obligation
to give an account of them to
anyone.
When pressed further by a uni
fied opposition of trainees and
faculty members, he offered the
following justification: (1) I was
'too much of an intellectual' and
(2) I didn't display 'the right
attitude towards authority.' How
ever, he refused to cite any in
stances of behavior on my part
that could support these charges,
if charges they be.
After my departure, a petition
of protest against the decision
was signed by 44 out of 48 of
the remaining trainees and sent
to Mr. Shriver. The Assistant
Director of the Oberlin program
informed me by letter that my
score had been high in all the
Peace Corps' rating as to job per
formance and character, and that
he was unable to understand the
action. Later I heard that Har
vard University, which was off
ered the sponsorship of a train
ing program by the Peace Corps,
refused to accept it because of
what they claimed were inequities
in the selection process insisted
upon by the Washington adminis
tration.
I spent the following weeks try
ing either to have the decision
appealed or to elicit from the
Peace Corps, the reasons for
which it was made. Time and
again I was promised by several
high officials that the case was
being reviewed, that the decision
most probably would bo reversed,
and that mistakes or personality
conflicts accounted for what had
happened.
Now, three months later, after
a great many letters, telegrams
and phone calls to Washington,
I have yet to receive even a for
mal acknowledgement in re
sponse. I believe that the rea
sons given for my dismissal,
whatever vague meaning they
may have, and the irresponsibil
ity of my subsequent treatment
are not in keeping with the ideals
of the organization as we find
them so frequently expressed.

T A. PROBLEM
Editor, Tlie Daily:
Let me preface this letter with
the remark that it is not a de
fense of the T.A. system.
Ist year T.A.: When are your
office hours?
4th year T.A.: Now.
Ist: So are mine. Isn't it excit
ing to sit here knowing that soon
some of the students, the cream
of America's youth, will be here.
That driven by an overwhelming

desire to learn, infused with the
true spirit of education, they
won't be satisfied with a mere
superficial knowledge of their
subject, but will be here asking
deep and penetrating questions
about calculus.
4th: How many students have
been to your office hours?
Ist: None so far. But it's only
the 4th week. Have any of your
students come?
4th: Sure, one did last winter;
he thought I'd made a mistake
grading his test.
Ist: You're just a cynic. I bet
someone will come today.
(Student enters.)
Student: May I talk to you sir.
Ist: Sure, what can I help you
with.
Student: I wonder if there's any
chance of my not getting a cinch
note.
Ist: It looks like you'll get one.
You only got 3 out of 200 on the
exam.
Student: I know sir, but I'm
trying my best.
Ist: But you weren't even in
class the 3 days before the exam.
Student: But I have good ex
cuses. Monday I was recovering
from the football game, Wednes
day I was recovering from a fra
ternity meeting that lasted until
4:00 a.m.; and Friday I was get
ting ready for the football game
Saturday.
Ist: I'm sorry, but I'll have to
give you a cinch note. Now are
there any questions about the ma
terial? It seems that you could
use some help.
Student: No. I have to hurry.
I have a coffee date in five min
utes.

WORST MASSACRE
Editor, The Daily:
Check one only: "The worst
massacre in the history of th e
world" probably occurred at
Hiroshima
Dresden
If you checked Hiroshima, you
may be interested to know that
"the most senseless single act of
mass murder committed in the
whole course of World War II"
was committed with conventional
weapons and yielded twice the
number of deaths as that nuclear
attack. Few persons know this
fact, so I decided to inform you
about a relevant article in the
November "Esquire." The moti
vation for this massacre stemmed
from the desire
•——for strategic Allied mili
tary advances.
to exterminate the Jews.
on the part of the Allies
to impress the Russians.
Arc you sure you're right in
your answer to that last ques
tion?
—P. M. BENTLER
