THE FLICKS
Editor, The Daily:
I thank Mr. Freeman, Jr. for
his stimulating "Treatise on Im
maturity." Though we the stu
dents may not be as perfect as
Mr. Freeman, I'm also sure that
we haven't precocity to admit
that we're "mature" either. In
fact, some might classify us as
"bawdies," especially at the Sun
day night flicks.
And of course there are many
solutions to Mr. Freeman Jr.'s
profound insight (though they
may have more devastation than
Mr. Freeman considered).
Instead of releasing our small
"immature" venomous remarks
on Sunday night, perhaps we
could hold our tensions and re
lease them at some other time.
There are many ways in which
this could be done. Property with
in the surrounding area could be
devastated 'e.g., broken windows,
etc.*. Or students might desire
to gain further insight into the
realm of intoxication, while cruis
ing at the speed of flight down
El Camino Real, with the eventual
outcome of further waste- man
gled bodies twisted by automobile
parts, and innocent people
marred. Yes indeed, these are but
a few of the perhaps, many solu
tions for the curtailment of the
Sunday night "bawdies."
Of course Mr. Freeman could
use the example of what 'ma
ture" people deem a solution to
tension, for there is always some
whipping post. It comes either in
the form of fighting with your
wife, picking on your kids, or
brow beating your employees and
students. If Mr. Freeman wishes
to have a more generalized and
absurd solution to his problems,
we could always start a war, thus
releasing, en mass, the tensions
one gets from being alive while
not being omnipotent.
I further suggest that Mr. Five
man take into account his exqui
site choice of "mature" vocabu
lary. Indeed such name calling
as "scum" and "foulmouthed"
shows us how responsible and
"mature" Mr. Freeman's gripe is!
I also suggest that if Mr. Free
man wishes to enjoy some melo
dramatic flick without such down
to earth interruptions he con Id
always attend some "nice, quiet,
and mature" theater in town
where he can become as overly
sentimental as he wants and cry
to his heart's content.

TYPES OF STUDENTS
Editor, The Daily:
I once read in the "Stanford
University Bulletin," the follow
ing line; "We shall be happy to
talk over with you Stanford's
aims and the education the Uni
versity offers."

An incident which occurred on
Monday, October 14, has given me
cause to force myself to evaluate
the aims of Ihis fine university.
I attended the Sunday Morning
Service in the Memorial Church,
and could nut help noticing the
faces of some of the congregation
in the benches near to me. One
student in particular made the
sign of the cross at the conclu
sion of each prayer, while upon
his face there shone a humble and
gentle smile. It occurred to me
that one might find a similar
smile of mercy and compassion
on Ihe face of Gotama, or Gandi,
or Jesus.
On Monday afternoon, I believe
I saw ihis student again, on the
Harry Maloney Soccer Field here
at Stanford- but no humble smile,
the sign of a different cross, a
uniform and a rifle. This was
education at Stanford.
What type of student is Stan
ford trying to produce? Is this
university attempting to suppress
that which is gentle, and humble,
and holy in each individual? In
stead, is Stanford aiming to edu
cate its undergraduates in the
operating "tactics and techniques"
of war? If these are Stanford's
goals, perhaps each of us should
ask himself again, "Why have I
come to Stanford?"

FIREDRILLS
Editor, The Daily:
Where were your reporters
when the fire wardens met Mon
day night? Something has to be
done. I mean it was a horrible
experience for us all when the
fire alarm went off unexpectedly
at 6:00 o'clock this morning. We
new students at Crothers Memo
rial just aren't used to such dirty
tactics, and we're sure that Mrs.
Stanford didn't intend to subject
us to such ordeals. I thought it
was my roommate's alarm clock
—but he just let it ring and ring
and ring. I was afraid he would
wake everyone in Crothers Me
morial. Then someone started
pounding on the door—l knew it
was everyone in the dorm coming
to our room to teach us better
manners. Then someone unlocked
the door and turned on the lighl
—that was too much! I woke up.
I staggered down the hall and
went outside.' Just then some
one yelled okay and everyone
came charging in. Coming in, I
met my roommate still coming
out and turned him around.
Neither one of us liked the ex
perience very much.
We can't allow such occur
rences to happen again. Maybe
pre-scheduled fire drills at a rea
sonable hour (so we can go off
campus) but the present type of
drill has got to stop!
