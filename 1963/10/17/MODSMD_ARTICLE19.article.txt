# New USC Policy Establishes Semester Four-Course Limit
## 
### 
In an effort to "streamline and
stiffen its course of study," the
University of Southern California
next fall will require that stu
dents take only four courses each
semester or eight during the en
tire academic academic year.
The four courses each semester
will give the student 32 classes
in a four-year program instead
of the 124 units now required for
graduation.
The plan will eliminate one and
two-unit courses, which have long
been regarded as the "fat" in the
e d u c a t i on a 1 program. These
courses will be incorporated into
courses of more substance and
greater depth.
Every department must now
justify every course, its sequence,
its level and its contribution, re
ported the Los Angeles Times.
THE PLAN is actually under
way 1 his semester in 14 of USC's
44 departments and will event
ually eliminate about 1,500 of the
3,500 courses in its catalogue.
The new curriculum will also
have profound effects on the fac
ulty. Each professor will be asked
to teach only two courses each
semester, regardless of his rank.
The University administration is
of the opinion that a heavy load
of classes "tends to make profes
sors lecturers, not teachers."
Another effect of the "four
course" plan will be to reduce
the somewhat relaxed attitude
that students have regarding
adding or dropping courses. Many
students carry a course for sev
eral weeks and then drop it for
personal reasons. The University
suggests that when students re
alize that any course dropped rep
resents a fourth of their acad
emic load, they will probably com
plete their work or have a much
better reason to drop the class
than in previous years.
THE IDEA for the new stream
lining effect began with the
inaugural address of University
president Dr. Norman Topping in
October, 1958. Suggestions in his
address gave rise to an educa
tional affairs committee com
prised of administrators and fac
ulty.

The plan will reportedly "integ
rate many subject fields to keep
the total curriculum relevant to
the growing body of knowledge,
to the shifting boundaries be
tween disciplines, to heightening
student expectations and to the
needs of society."
In addition to Topping and Dr.
Tracy E. Strevey, Vice President
for Academic Affairs, two other
! key university personnel are play
ing major roles in establishing
the new academic format. Dr. Ed
ward McDonagh, Chairman of the
Division of Social Sciences, served
as Chairman of the Educational
I Affairs committee and Dr. Neil
D. Warren, Dean of the College of
Letters. Arts, and Sciences, raised
the possibility of considering
j courses rather than units as the
basis for computing a student's
class load. Eight other members
of the faculty and administration
also worked on the committee.
The group studied the feasibil
ity of converting the school's sem
ester program to the much dis
cussed trimester plan, but felt
that students could not benefit
from such calendar reform "until
; the fragmented curriculum is
overhauled."
"TOO MANY of the students
; are forced to take six and seven
! courses per semester to carry a
full load. It becomes increasingly
apparent that students are get
! ting exposed to the surfaces of
many bits of knowledge," the
committee reported.
The committee was of the
opinion that use of a trimester
system, without basic educational
I changes, amounts to little more
j than an "academic form of day
: light saving time."
McDonagh and Warren feel cer
tain that the new program will
demand an entering student of
; superior quality. Few freshmen
j with grade point averages below
2.8 are now admitted. Three
fourths of the student body are
significantly superior to operat
ing standards of admission and
this level will move upwards as
the program progresses, they
1 agreed.
