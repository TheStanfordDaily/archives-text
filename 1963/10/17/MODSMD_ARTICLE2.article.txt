## 
### PAM CHAMBERS 
The recent succession of Lud
wig Erhard to the position of
Chancellor of West Germany, and
I he political crisis facing him in
that position, provided the main
topic for the speech given yester
day afternoon by Professor Wal
deman Besson, Director of the
Political Institute at the Univer
sity of Erlangen in Germany.
The success of the new govern
ment rests on the question ot
whether or not the new chancellor
will maintain the old policies initi
ated by his predecessor, Konrad
Adenauer, or whether he will
create a new era of his own, Bes
son declared.
"11 - ' KKIIAKI) cannot convey to
the country that a new style a
new initiation in politics has be
gun. he will lose his chance (to
make any important contribution
to Germany's advancement). The
country wants change. His suc
cess will depend on whether he
can make these changes," ho said.
The modifications proposed by
Professor Besson would involve
both German domestic and for
eign policy. In the domestic area.
Besson fell that Germany's rapid
change from a primarily agricul
tural state to one of the largest
industrial powers in the world
necessitated a revision of the edu
cational and political institutions.
Specifically, he suggested t li
need for an expanded Social Se
curity system, stronger anti-trust
legislation, more government con
trol of education, a more united
Christian Democratic Party, and
legislation to eliminate over-repre

sentation in the parliament of
the agrarian regions in the coun
try.
IN FOREIGN POLICY, Besson
declared, the main issue has be
comel the vying of France and the
United States for Germany's fa
vors. Erhard, who sympathizes
with the American interests, is
facing the serious question of
"How to move towards the Ameri
can line without breaking with
De Gaulle." Besson also indicated
the drastic need for a reinterpre
tation of the German attitude to
ward their "relations and position
with the p]ast, and more specifi
cally, with Russia."
In conclusion, Professor Bes
son stated that the "reinterpreta
tion of policies and principals is
needed more than anything else
in Germany today."
