# College Survey Reveals Liberal Trend
## 
### NORM HIRSCH 
A survey of the political and
religious attitudes of American
college students has recently been
conducted by Educational Review
er, Inc., and the results are in
an article by Dr. Albert Bandura,
Stanford psychologist, in the Oc
tober 22 issue of Look Magazine.
Almost a third of the students
at Sarah Lawrence and at Wil
liams advocate at least "govern
ment control of the basic indus
tries." At Reed a quarter of the
students are at least "somewhat

I in favor" of total socialism.
THE CONSERVATIVE element
lon campus is definitely in the
minority. Of the students whose
political beliefs were reversed
after coming to Davidson, 36 per
cent went from "conservative to
more liberal," while only 18 per
j cent went from "liberal to more
conservative."
These figures are very similar
to those of Stanford. Followers
of Ayn Rand, who call the Sher
man Anti-trust Act of 1890 the
most pernicious piece of legisla
tion ever passed in America, are
most numerous on the Stanford
campus. Boston University also
has a large number of them.
About 30 per cent of the Stan
ford students who reacted against
religion while at the university
said that "courses dealing with
religion" were the cause. At Stan
ford 33 per cent of the Protestant
students have formally aposta
sized; at Reed a full 72 per cent
have rejected their faith. Fifteen
per cent of the Jewish students
at Stanford have given up their
faith.
Although about 70 per cent of
the students taking the poll pro
fessed "belief in some form of
; Christianity," less than half of
these said that Christ was God
I in the flesh. Of the students that
did not apostasize their Christian
faith at Williams, only 45 per cenl
I accent this basic tenet of Christi

anity.
THE MAJORITY of all stu
dents polled believe in immortal
ity (46 per cent at Stanford), and,
except for Reed which has a ma
jority of atheists and agnostics,
83 per cent believe in a Divine
Presence. Of this large majority,
however 34 per cent believe in a
God about which "nothing can be
affirmed."
Most of those who believe in a
God that is relevant to them are
Roman Catholics, extremely few
are Jews. Eighty per cent of the
students who believe in a Divine
Presence responded that they
pray.
The large majority of the stu
dents polled, Bandura concludes,
regardless of their own beliefs,
want to give their children reli
gious training, and many who
doubt their own religious tradi
tion will teach their children to
adhere to it.
The survey of twelve colleges,
according to Dr. Brandura's ar
ticle. indicates "that American lib
eral arts colleges tend to exercise
a politically liberalizing influence
on their students, chiefly because
of the liberal viewpoint of the j
average American faculty mem- j
her." About 45 per cent of the
students at Stanford labeled J
themselves "moderate liberals,";
but the poll points out that many !
of the "moderate liberals" have
definite socialistic leanings.

Almost a third of the students
at Sarah Lawrence and at Wil
liams advocate at least "govern
ment control of the basic indus
tries." At Reed a quarter of the
students are at least "somewhat

I in favor" of total socialism.
THE CONSERVATIVE element
lon campus is definitely in the
minority. Of the students whose
political beliefs were reversed
after coming to Davidson, 36 per
cent went from "conservative to
more liberal," while only 18 per
j cent went from "liberal to more
conservative."
These figures are very similar
to those of Stanford. Followers
of Ayn Rand, who call the Sher
man Anti-trust Act of 1890 the
most pernicious piece of legisla
tion ever passed in America, are
most numerous on the Stanford
campus. Boston University also
has a large number of them.
About 30 per cent of the Stan
ford students who reacted against
religion while at the university
said that "courses dealing with
religion" were the cause. At Stan
ford 33 per cent of the Protestant
students have formally aposta
sized; at Reed a full 72 per cent
have rejected their faith. Fifteen
per cent of the Jewish students
at Stanford have given up their
faith.
Although about 70 per cent of
the students taking the poll pro
fessed "belief in some form of
; Christianity," less than half of
these said that Christ was God
I in the flesh. Of the students that
did not apostasize their Christian
faith at Williams, only 45 per cenl
I accent this basic tenet of Christi

anity.
THE MAJORITY of all stu
dents polled believe in immortal
ity (46 per cent at Stanford), and,
except for Reed which has a ma
jority of atheists and agnostics,
83 per cent believe in a Divine
Presence. Of this large majority,
however 34 per cent believe in a
God about which "nothing can be
affirmed."
Most of those who believe in a
God that is relevant to them are
Roman Catholics, extremely few
are Jews. Eighty per cent of the
students who believe in a Divine
Presence responded that they
pray.
The large majority of the stu
dents polled, Bandura concludes,
regardless of their own beliefs,
want to give their children reli
gious training, and many who
doubt their own religious tradi
tion will teach their children to
adhere to it.
The survey of twelve colleges,
according to Dr. Brandura's ar
ticle. indicates "that American lib
eral arts colleges tend to exercise
a politically liberalizing influence
on their students, chiefly because
of the liberal viewpoint of the j
average American faculty mem- j
her." About 45 per cent of the
students at Stanford labeled J
themselves "moderate liberals,";
but the poll points out that many !
of the "moderate liberals" have
definite socialistic leanings.
A survey of the political and
religious attitudes of American
college students has recently been
conducted by Educational Review
er, Inc., and the results are in
an article by Dr. Albert Bandura,
Stanford psychologist, in the Oc
