### 
SELMA, Alabama (CPS More
than 400 Negroes went to the
C o un t y Courthouse here lasl
Wednesday in an attempt to reg
ister to vote. For the most part,
they failed.
Negroes qued up early since
Monday (October 7> was one of
the few days of the year when
the registration rolls were open
ed for new voters. However, they
were sent from one door of the
building to another, told at each
entrance that they could not enter
by police or citizens.
Three youths, carrying signs
reading "Register to Vote," were
arrested by the state police on a
charge of unlawful assembly.
JAMES FORM AN, Executive
Secretary of the Student Nonvio
lent Coordinat ing C o m m i 11 e e
(SNCC> was jabbed several times
in the ribs with a billy club by
Sheriff Jim Clark of Dallas
County.
Forman, who has registered
complaints with the Justice De
partment before on the same sub
ject, sent a telegram to Attorney
General Robert Kennedy request
ing the Justice Department ob
tain a restraining order on Sheriff
Clark.
Forman, along with James
Baldwin and Professor Howard
Zinn later asked the Sheriff if
Negroes could leave the line to
get food and return to their same
positions. The Sheriff told them
that any one leaving would have
to go to the end on returning. He
also told the three that if they
went to the line and attempted to
talk with any of the Negroes
there was a good chance they
would be arrested.
Later, two SNCC wo r k e r s .
Avery Williams and "Chico" Neb
litt, went to the line with voter
registration forms and were se
verly beaten by the state police
when the police arrested them.
THE SNCC OFFICE estimated
that only 23 of the Negroes ever
got in to the Court house, and out
of those they had no idea how
many were ever registered. SNCC
also said that there were 1,1 state
police cars parked in double file
in front of the Court House.
The United States National Stu
dent Association (USNSA) in
Philadelphia sent the following

telegram to Attorney General j
Robert Kennedy, protesting the
actions here:
"Appalled by reports reaching
our offices tonight from Sclma,
Ala., the United States National j
Student Association calls on the
Justice Department to protect the
citizens of Selma who, trying to :
cxcersise their democratic right
to vote, were brutally intimiated
by the local and state police. Con- .
cerned Americans can not hope
much longer for the maintenance j
of the non-violent character of !
civil rights demonstrations in
basence of similar restraint on
the part of local officials and pro- j
tection by the federal govern-1
ment.
