# TICKET BOOK PLANNED
## Admission Will Be Charged in All Sports 
### ALAN CHARLESWORTH 
Starting this fall, a uniform
admission charge of 50 cents is
being put into effect for the so
called "minor sports," according
to Director of Athletics Chuck
Taylor.
In the past admission has been
charged irregularly to some of
these sports, mainly in the case
of league or specially important
games.
This action is preparatory to
th e establishment of season
tickets for the minor sports be
ginning next fall. The season
tickets will cost students in the
neighborhood of three dollars per
year, entitling the bearer admis
sion to approximately 125 con
tests in 25 different sports.

Finances are a major motive
behind the change. Most of the
minor sports at present produce
little or no revenue, the financial
load falling almost entirely on
football and basketball. Increased
income from the other sports
would allow these sports a greatly
increased budget for equipment
and supplies, as presently they
are quite limited in this respect.
A second reason behind the
change concerns an attempt to
increase the poor attendance the
minor sports receive. In the
words of Taylor, "When you give
something away, people naturally
tend to assume that it is worth
loss. The price tag makes things
important." Thus a uniform
charge will tend to give the minor
sports more prestige. The season
ticket will allow the student an
immense saving over the 50 cents
a game cost otherwise available.
Accompanying the season
tickets next fall will be increased
publicity concerning the minor
sports aimed at the surrounding
communities. Season tickets will
cost the general public twelve
dollars, through some form of
family plan will also be available.
In contrast to the present sea
son football tickets, the minor
sports ticket will be completely
transferable, the only restriction
being that students only will be
permitted to use student tickets.
Thus it will be possible for living
groups to buy a number of the
season tickets for the members
of the group to use.
Taylor cited the example of a
fraternity, which purchasing ten
or fifteen season tickets, could
satisfy the needs of all its forty
or so members.
The tickets will cover all sports
except basketball and football.
Concerning basketball, Taylor
mentioned the dilemma that
would be caused if in excess of
2,000 tickets were sold, it would
be impossible to provide seating
for all the ticket holders.
Adding football to the ticket
would force officials to raise the
price to the neighborhood of ten
dollars, unduly penalizing stu
dents who wish to attend either
football or the minor sports, but
not both.
He praised attendance at th e
major sports, especially football,
where student attendance has re
mained excellent despite the ab
sence recently of winning teams.
In relation to the size of the Stan
ford student body, the average
football attendance is among the
best in American universities. His
hope is that this enthusiasm will
carry over in an increasing degree
to the minor sports, in which
Stanford has a top flight pro
gram.
