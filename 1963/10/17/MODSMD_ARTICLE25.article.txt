## Huskies Meet Tribe 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Picked to finish near the t op
of the AAYVU this year, Washing
ton unexpectedly dropped its first
three encounters of the season
to Pitt, Air Force Academy, and
lowa before erupting against Ore
gon State. Last Satur d a y,

the Huskies demonstrated rather
conclusively that they have re
moved the mothballs from their
offense by swarming the favored
Beavers from Oregon State with
34 points.
Washington's now prolific off
ense will pit itself against a tough
Stanford defense that has given
up only two touchdowns in the
last two games. Opponents have
pushed across two other tallies
after Stanford passing miscues.
WASHINGTON has a scant 14
returning lettermen compared
with 26 for Stanford. Heading the
backfield returnees are Bill Doug
las and Junior Coffey. Douglas, a
junior has taken over for the in
jured Bill Siler and is an able
passer, principally aiming hi s
tosses to 6'5" end A 1 Ligke, a con
verted safetyman.
But passing has not been the
strong point of the Husky offense
so far. It leads the Big Six in
total rushing yardage and is last
in passing yardage. Incidentally.
Stanford is not far off the Wash

, ington pace, taking second honors
in rushing and fifth in passing.
Sophomore Steve Bramwell,
who already has runback several
punts and kickoffs for long yard
age is a breakaway threat that
Stanford must contain. Other
halfbacks used by the Huskies are
Dave Kopay, Ron Medved, a n d
Gary Price.
JUNIOR COFFEY is the fastest
back on the squad and was t he
leading rusher on the Coast last
year in his first varsity season.
This year, tabbed as a pre-season
all-American candidate, ho unfor
tunately received a hairline frac
ture on his foot early in the sea
son.
Inevitably, Coffey is ready to
play his first game of the season
against Stanford. To play exten
sively, he will have to beat out
the present first stringer, Charlie
Browning, who sports a 4.8 rush
ing average and is one reason
why Washington leads in rush
ing. Miko Otis, his replacement,
has also had his moments this
year and will see plenty of action
in the course of the game.
Tackle and guard are the two
strong positions on a relatively
weak Washington line primarily
responsible for its last place
AAWIJ ranking in total defense.
On the right side are a couple of
two year veterans, Mike Briggs
at tackle and guard Rick Sorlun.
Rick R.edman, on most All-Coast
squads and on several AU-Ameri
can honorable mention listings,
backbones the other side of the
line.
IN SATURDAY'S contest at
Seattle, Washington has tradition
on its side. In the four year
existence of the AAWU. Stan
ford has been defeated each of
these four years by the Huskies.
Three of these times the Tribe
was blanked. Coach Jim Owen in
the last four years has directed
his charges to at least a second
place finish, twice copping the
championship.

three encounters of the season
to Pitt, Air Force Academy, and
lowa before erupting against Ore
gon State. Last Satur d a y,

the Huskies demonstrated rather
conclusively that they have re
moved the mothballs from their
offense by swarming the favored
Beavers from Oregon State with
34 points.
Washington's now prolific off
ense will pit itself against a tough
Stanford defense that has given
up only two touchdowns in the
last two games. Opponents have
pushed across two other tallies
after Stanford passing miscues.
WASHINGTON has a scant 14
returning lettermen compared
with 26 for Stanford. Heading the
backfield returnees are Bill Doug
las and Junior Coffey. Douglas, a
junior has taken over for the in
jured Bill Siler and is an able
passer, principally aiming hi s
tosses to 6'5" end A 1 Ligke, a con
verted safetyman.
But passing has not been the
strong point of the Husky offense
so far. It leads the Big Six in
total rushing yardage and is last
in passing yardage. Incidentally.
Stanford is not far off the Wash

, ington pace, taking second honors
in rushing and fifth in passing.
Sophomore Steve Bramwell,
who already has runback several
punts and kickoffs for long yard
age is a breakaway threat that
Stanford must contain. Other
halfbacks used by the Huskies are
Dave Kopay, Ron Medved, a n d
Gary Price.
JUNIOR COFFEY is the fastest
back on the squad and was t he
leading rusher on the Coast last
year in his first varsity season.
This year, tabbed as a pre-season
all-American candidate, ho unfor
tunately received a hairline frac
ture on his foot early in the sea
son.
Inevitably, Coffey is ready to
play his first game of the season
against Stanford. To play exten
sively, he will have to beat out
the present first stringer, Charlie
Browning, who sports a 4.8 rush
ing average and is one reason
why Washington leads in rush
ing. Miko Otis, his replacement,
has also had his moments this
year and will see plenty of action
in the course of the game.
Tackle and guard are the two
strong positions on a relatively
weak Washington line primarily
responsible for its last place
AAWIJ ranking in total defense.
On the right side are a couple of
two year veterans, Mike Briggs
at tackle and guard Rick Sorlun.
Rick R.edman, on most All-Coast
squads and on several AU-Ameri
can honorable mention listings,
backbones the other side of the
line.
IN SATURDAY'S contest at
Seattle, Washington has tradition
on its side. In the four year
existence of the AAWU. Stan
ford has been defeated each of
these four years by the Huskies.
Three of these times the Tribe
was blanked. Coach Jim Owen in
the last four years has directed
his charges to at least a second
place finish, twice copping the
championship.
