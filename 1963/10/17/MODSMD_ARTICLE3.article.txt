# Panel Discusses Corps Problems
## 
### BANNING GARRETT 
"The hardships endured by
Peace Corps volunteers are not
physical, hut psychological," said
George A. Barnes at the Peace
Corps panel discussion last night
al Trosidder.
The members of the panel with
George A. Barnes, a Peace Corps
returnee from Sierra Leone were:
Walter C. Carrington, Peace
Corps lawyer; Joseph T. English,
Chief of Psychiastry; and Charles
Woodward, Director of Public
Affairs.
ENTHUSIASTIC' volunteers are
surprised 1o find that the people
often do not know they are com
ing, do not know why they are
coming, and do nowl understand
why they want to disturb the
status quo.
Once the people have adjusted
to the Peace Corps and vice-versa,
ii is often expected that tractors
and other "foreign-aid type"
equipment will follow. When the
people realize that only the vol
unteer himself is coming, they
are often disappointed.
Although volunteers have met
I his situation well and have dem
onstrated their worth to the
people, the adjustment period
often has been very frustrating
and disappoint ing.
"PEACE COUPS volunteers are
expected to live on the level of
their foreign counterparts," said
Carrington. "and in Africa it has
been difficult to avoid conspicu
ous under consumption." Teach
ers live very well in Africa and
it would be conspicuous for a
volunteer to deliberately live at
poorer economic level than the
average Africa teacher.
When asked why the Peace
Corps has succeeded where the
experts had failed, Carrington re
plied that the volunteers arc not
advisors and experts telling the
people what to do. they are in the
countries to help the people do
what the people want to do. The
volunteers work with the people,
not above them.
The Peace Corps Week pro
gram concludes this evening wilh
a seminar, "The Peace Corps in
Africa." The presentation, to be
load by Walter Carrington, will be
in room 271 at Trosidder and will
begin at 7:30 p.m.

ers live very well in Africa and
it would be conspicuous for a
volunteer to deliberately live at
poorer economic level than the
average Africa teacher.
When asked why the Peace
Corps has succeeded where the
experts had failed, Carrington re
plied that the volunteers arc not
advisors and experts telling the
people what to do. they are in the
countries to help the people do
what the people want to do. The
volunteers work with the people,
not above them.
The Peace Corps Week pro
gram concludes this evening wilh
a seminar, "The Peace Corps in
Africa." The presentation, to be
load by Walter Carrington, will be
in room 271 at Trosidder and will
begin at 7:30 p.m.
"The hardships endured by
Peace Corps volunteers are not
physical, hut psychological," said
George A. Barnes at the Peace
Corps panel discussion last night
al Trosidder.
The members of the panel with
George A. Barnes, a Peace Corps
returnee from Sierra Leone were:
Walter C. Carrington, Peace
Corps lawyer; Joseph T. English,
Chief of Psychiastry; and Charles
Woodward, Director of Public
Affairs.
ENTHUSIASTIC' volunteers are
surprised 1o find that the people
often do not know they are com
ing, do not know why they are
coming, and do nowl understand
why they want to disturb the
status quo.
Once the people have adjusted
to the Peace Corps and vice-versa,
ii is often expected that tractors
and other "foreign-aid type"
equipment will follow. When the
people realize that only the vol
unteer himself is coming, they
are often disappointed.
Although volunteers have met
I his situation well and have dem
onstrated their worth to the
people, the adjustment period
often has been very frustrating
and disappoint ing.
"PEACE COUPS volunteers are
expected to live on the level of
their foreign counterparts," said
Carrington. "and in Africa it has
been difficult to avoid conspicu
ous under consumption." Teach
ers live very well in Africa and
it would be conspicuous for a
volunteer to deliberately live at
poorer economic level than the
average Africa teacher.
