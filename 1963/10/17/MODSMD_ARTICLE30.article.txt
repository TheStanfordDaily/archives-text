# HOT LINE TO THE SIDELINE Jordan Top Coach
## 
### TOM ELIAS 
"Nothing but complete application and self-discipline can make
you a champion." These words are among the first that all fresh
man track men hear when they arrive at Stanford.
They form the credo of Payton Jordan the coach who created ;
a track renaissance at Stanford after his arrival in 1957. Jordan,
a native of Whittier, Cal., came to Stanford after spending ten years
at Los Angeles' Occidental College, where he produced some of the
finest track and field athletes in U.S. history. Among them were
pole vaulter Bob Gutowski and miler Bob McMillen, both of whom
starred for Uncle Sam in Olympic and other international competi
tion.
A graduate of Pasadena High School, where he was student body
president, Jordan spent one year at Santa Monica J.C. before moving
over to Southern Cal.
CAPTAINKI) TRACK TKA.M
At SC he starred in both football and track, playing halfback on

i lir" gridiron and running sprints, j
the quarter milo, and relays on ;
the cinders. Captain of the 1939
Trojan track and field squad, Jor- j
dan ran a line 9.5 hundred and
48.0 quarter that season.
After his graduation, the coach
spent two years as mentor at Red
lands High School before going
into the service. A flight training
instructor during the war, Jor
dan also competed for the foot-!
ball teams at St. Mary's and the i
University of lowa pro-flight :
training centers. He was named !
Al-Service All-American in 1914 J
while at lowa.
Coming out of the service in
194."5, Jordan spent one year at
his old post in Redlands before
moving on to Occidental.
A dedicated athlete himself, the
coach feels that his purpose, and

1 hat of any other coach is to inspire his charges to use their potential
and, to help them develop ii to the fullest extent possible.
"My main job as a coach is to simplify, to make things practical
and functional. It interferes with an athlete's performance if ho
has too many things to think about at once," says the Stanford coach.
His main teaching problem, Jordan says, is not the instruction
of techniques, but instilling self-discipline in his men.
"Championship performance is not accidental," maintains the
coach, but it results from the proper attitude together with physical
attributes.
"All the technique in the world is no good without the will to
work to win. In addition a champion in any field must have high ;
expectations of himself. He need not trumpet these feelings, but i
should hold them and thus expect good performance of himself."
DIRECTED U.S. RUSSIAN MEET
The Stanford coach is today one of the world's foremost person
alities in the world of track and field. His international contacts were
largely responsible for bringing the 1962 Russian-American duel
meet to Stanford Stadium, where the two-day spectacle, directed by;
Jordan, drew over 150,000 fans.
This year, the Indian mentor assumed the chore, a pleasure for!
him of coaching the United States team.in the latest renewal of thel
Soviet-American rivalry, held in Moscow in July.
Jordan feels very strongly about the "irresponsible" writing which
painted tho team, a slim victor over the Russians, as a group of ;
playboys.
"There was only one American sports writer in Russia for the 1
meet." says the coach, "and he had never written track before. The
other writers were all political correspondents, in Moscow to cover
the test ban talks. They had very little time to spend around the I
team, and the resulting stories were unfair and did the boys and
the United States as a whole no good in the eyes of the world."
That this team was not a group of playboys as alleged can be I
seen from their subsequent big victories over England. Germany, |
and Poland.
Stanford can indeed feel itself fortunate to boast of having a man I
like Payton Jordan on its faculty, a man who has spread the name j
of the university over the whole world, and one who annually attracts I
the cream of the nation's high school track and field performers to 1
the Indian tepee.
