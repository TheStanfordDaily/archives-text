# UC Senate Fables Measure On Student Political Affiliation
## 
### 
The student Senate at the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley
tabled Tuesday night a measure
which would have permitted can
didates in a student election to
put the name of a "recognized
campus political party" after their
name on the ballot.
The measure asked for amend
ments to the election rules, the
election procedures, and the
ASUC sponsorship policy. Th e
Student Judicial Committee had
previously ruled that the political
group affiliations can be placed
after the candidates' names. The
Committee's decision overruled
Electional Council Chairman Alex
Salamando who last week ordered
all political affiliations off the
ballot.
MKJIBKRS of campus political
groups Slate and the College
Young Democrats had protested
Salamo's decision at the Judicial
Committee meeting when they
were told that no affiliations
would be allowed on the ballot
for Freshman class elections on
Tuesday.
The proposal before the Asso
ciated Students Senate required
that special conditions would have
to be met by the political groups
before they would be recognized.
The purposes of such groups
would be limited to matters of
concern to Berkeley students as
others in the ASUC elections.
Recognition of the group would
depend on a majority vote from
among Ihe ASUC Executive Di
rector. the Dean of Students, and
the ASUC President.
ASUC PRESIDENT MEL EE
VINE concurred with Salamando
in his decision to omit the affilia
tions from the ballot.
Slale has used its name with
its candidates for five years and
the Young Democrats were at
tempting to endorse candidates
on the ballot for the first time.
Because of "poor communica
tion and the resulting confusion
surrounding the entire election,"
only Slate appeared on the fresh
man ballot.
All three students endorsed by
the Young Democrats lost.
THE JUDIC lAL COMMITTEE
based its decision on a resolution
passed in 1959 by the Student
Executive Committee, forerunner
of the ASUC Senate. The resolu
tions stated that "candidates cam
paigning as endorsed representa
tives of a recognized campus polit
ical party may request that their

party's designation shall appear
after their names on the ballot."
Salamando had claimed that
"recognized political party" meant
only a party recognized the Uni
versity as a campus political
part.
Slate and CYD's contention was
upheld because, since the Univer
sity refused to recognize any
campus political party, "recog
nized cannot be taken to mean by
the University."
"We interpret 'recognized' to
mean 'legal.' " said a Committee
member. "That is. a party the
University recognizes as being a
legal student group."
In making his decision last
week. Salamendo said, "I was un
able to find any record of Judicial
Committee hearings that would
justify the use of endorsements
on the ballot."
"There were no rules saying
yes or no, so I said no."
Following Salamendo's decision,
Richard Smith of the CYD's said,
"The disallowance of endorse
ments on ASUC election ballots
by the election council chairman
is a serious infringement upon
meaningful students government
and is obviously void of all
logic."
