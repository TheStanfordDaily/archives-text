VATICAN CITY A document strongly condemning anti-Semi
tism is being prepared by a key Vatican secretariat for distribution
to the 2.300 Roman Catholic bishops participating in the Ecumenical
Council.
Vatican sources said the document is being drafted by the Sec
retariate for Promoting Christian Unity. This secretariate originally
was set up to handle Vatican relations with Protestant and Ortho
dox churches, but Pope Paul VI recently expanded its jurisdiction
to include responsibility for Catholic contacts with non-Christian
religions such as Judaism, Islam and Buddhism.
While the contents of the document are secret, its major theme
is known to be a strong emphasis on the fact that hatred of Jews
jn un-Christian and in direct contradiction of Catholic teaching.
It also is reported to emphasize the historic links of Christendom
with Judaism, including the fact that Jesus himself was a Jew, as
were all of the apostles of the early Church.
It is expected the document will stress as many Catholic and
Protestant theologians have done in recent years—that it is bad
history and worse doctrine to blame "the Jews" for the crucifixion
of Jesus.
HUAC RENEWS INVESTIGATION OF STUDENTS—WASHING
TON Mystery replaced violence Wednesday as the House Com
mittee on Un-American Activities renewed its investigation of an
unauthorized trip to Cuba last summer by 59 American students.
The committee was able to question witnesses—some cooperative,
others not—without the trace of a disturbance. The last time it
covered the same subject police had to eject some 50 screaming and
kicking youths.
In its questioning, the committee staff inquiried into the financ
ing and arranging of the trip. It centered its focus on the man who
in August colleeed $6,201.60 lor 13 airline tickets the student group
did not use.
ALGERIAN-MOROCCAN TALKS COLLAPSE—ALGIERS—Al
gerian-Moroccan peace talks collapsed Thursday in Marrakeeh.
Algeria was reported rushing 50.000 troops becked by artillery
and planes to its Sahara border in preparation for possible all-out
war.
A dispatch from Marrakeeh said Morocco had 10,000 men in action
and was sending reinforcements to the front. The dispatch said 700
Moroccan wounded had been taken to Marrakeeh in an indication the
fighting was heavier than reported in Algiers.
Reports from Algerian army headqu irters at Colomb Bechar 500
miles southwest of here said reinforcements were flooding in there
while fighting continued 250 miles farther to the southwest for the
fourth consecutive day.
The fighting was said to be limited for the time being to long
range artillery firing without close-in combat. Casualties were re
ported relatively light. Algiers Radio said Thursday night fighting
continues "without respite."
Algerian peace delegates M'Hamed Yazid and Col. Hoffman Sli
mane felw home from Marrakeeh with Ambassador to Morocco Saad
Dahlab to report to President Ahmed Ben Bella.
Asked by newsmen whether his departure for Algiers meant
final collapse of peace talks, Yazid refused comment.

Vatican sources said the document is being drafted by the Sec
retariate for Promoting Christian Unity. This secretariate originally
was set up to handle Vatican relations with Protestant and Ortho
dox churches, but Pope Paul VI recently expanded its jurisdiction
to include responsibility for Catholic contacts with non-Christian
religions such as Judaism, Islam and Buddhism.
While the contents of the document are secret, its major theme
is known to be a strong emphasis on the fact that hatred of Jews
jn un-Christian and in direct contradiction of Catholic teaching.
It also is reported to emphasize the historic links of Christendom
with Judaism, including the fact that Jesus himself was a Jew, as
were all of the apostles of the early Church.
It is expected the document will stress as many Catholic and
Protestant theologians have done in recent years—that it is bad
history and worse doctrine to blame "the Jews" for the crucifixion
of Jesus.

mittee on Un-American Activities renewed its investigation of an
unauthorized trip to Cuba last summer by 59 American students.

covered the same subject police had to eject some 50 screaming and
kicking youths.

miles southwest of here said reinforcements were flooding in there
while fighting continued 250 miles farther to the southwest for the
fourth consecutive day.

range artillery firing without close-in combat. Casualties were re
ported relatively light. Algiers Radio said Thursday night fighting
continues "without respite."
