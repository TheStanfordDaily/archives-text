The first meeting of the Stan
ford Young Democrats was held
yesterday, under ihe leadership
of Bob Ronka. The purpose of
this meeting, said Ronka, "is to
define the structure of the organ
ization, to enroll charter mem
bers, and to elect officers."
In the past, Ronka said, "the
Young Democrats have not been
affiliated with the national or
ganization." What existed were
splinter groups and :iri hoc com
mittees which were largely un
successful." The problem then,
Ronka stated, "is whether 1 to affil
iate with the California Federa
tion of Young Democrats, the
County Central, or the National
Federation."
THE ANSWER, Ronka thinks,
is to be "a junior organ of the
National Federation, because then
we would have access to lop
speakers and other good resour
ces." However, he later added,
this decision is up to the charter
members.
After an introductory talk,
Ronka gave the floor to Professor
Bernard Coden of Social Research,
whose message was the follow
ing: "What counts is not hearing
people that say what you believe,
but active participation, partic
ularly outside the campus."
After Cohen's talk the constitu
tion which Ronka presented was
discussed. Many objections to the
constitution were raised because
there were no provisions for
amendment, for approval of the
constitution, or for approval of
offices.
TO GET AROUND the prob
lem. Cohan suggested that they
approve the constitution on the
condition that it later be
amended. Approval was unanim
ous by the 54 charter members
present.
Nominations were declared
open until next Monday, the day
of the election meeting. The nom
inations thus far are as follows:
for President: Bob Ronka; for
Vice-President; Doug Parker; for
Corresponding Secretary: Carrie
Brand and David Stroall; for Re
cording Secretary: Mac MeCon*
nel; for Treasurer: Fred Altshu
ler.
