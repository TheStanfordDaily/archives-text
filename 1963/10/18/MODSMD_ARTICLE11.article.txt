# Serious Debate Where Frivolity Has Reigned
## 
### 
The time has passed when collegiate student government
is regarded by faculty and administrators as solely an "exer
cise in citizenship," a rehearsal ot means without ends.
Student Presidents at Stanford are no longer elected by
turning over old cars in front of the bookstore, as was the case
four years ago. The election of last June was fought on philo
sophical grounds: the role of the student in University deci
sion-making.
Last night the Legislature discussed three vital areas of
University policy: reductions of students on President Ster
ling's advisory committees, research into the legal aspects of
religion at Stanford, and analysis of the recent Trustee's revi
sion of the policy of Student Government and Conduct.
Few students are presumptuous enough to challenge the
fact that the President of this University is responsible for
its policy and may choose his advisors and make recommenda
tions solely at his own discretion. Students, in debating state
ments of the President and of the Trustees, are not demanding
democratic decision-making in the University, a method which
is certainly questionable in a community of students and pro
fessors.
The principle behind student involvement in University
decision-making would seem to be two-fold. First, it is as
sumed that those who are legally responsible for university
policy want to hear the views and recommendations of a
concerned student-body, whose constituency represents a
major reason for their work. Secondly, it is assumed that the
student, who analyzes the purposes of his education and its
methods will profit from it on a more sophisticated level. In
light of this second point, it is regrettable that philosophical
statements of the principles behind a Stanford education have
been sparse.
Perhaps it is a poor sign of the times that college students
have turned to serious debate of educational purpose in places
where frivolity has reigned in other times. Whatever the ver
dict be, the Legislature and student government of Stanford
are considering matters of depth and import, and the change
is worthy of note.
