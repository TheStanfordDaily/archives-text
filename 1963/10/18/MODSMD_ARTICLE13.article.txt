PEACE ( OKI'S REPLIES
Editor, The Daily:
Thank you for allowing us to
respond to the letter by Steven
Marx published in your October
17 issue.
By way of background, the se
lection process that has been ap
plied successfully to over 7,000
Volunteers is based on the judg
ment of many members of th e
University faculty who have per
sonally observed each Trainee
during the training program, sev
eral psychologists, a psychiatrist,
an official member of the Peace
Corps overseas staff who is fa
miliar with the problems the po
tential Volunteers will face, and
the University's Project Director.
In addition, this process utilizes
data of personal references on
each Trainee that is compiled by
a comprehensive background in
vestigation.
After a review of this material
and Mr. Marx's performance prior
to and during the training pro
gram, his Selection Board was
unanimous in arriving at a final
decision that it would be in his
best interests and those of the
Peace Corps if he were not to pro
ceed overseas as a Volunteer. On
October 9, Dr. S. J. Kaplan, Act
ing Director of the Selection
Division, advised him, in response
to his appeal, that the decision of
the Board had been sustained and
was final. In this letter Dr. Kap
lan states as follows:
. . As you will recall from
the orientation you received at
the beginning of training, the de
terminant for selection is the
composite of opinions and obser
vations and grades provided by
all who have been asked to evalu
ate the candidate. All are oriented
to seek evidence provided by the
Trainee that he is a person who
should be selected for an overseas
assignment. On the basis of these
combined observations, a consen
sus of opinion is developed at the
time of the Board meeting which
leads to a decision. It is generally
not the case that any one factor is
sufficient to lead to the Board's
decision for separation. . .
We did receive a petition from
his fellow trainees which was
considered in the review of the
original decision. We were pleased
to note that they had observed
many of Mr. Marx's excellent
qualities. It should be pointed
out, however, that they were not

completely aware of all of the
material discussed and reviewed
by the Selection Board.
Our relationship with Harvard
University has at no time in
volved the Peace Corps Selection
process or any question pertain
ing to that process.
I can assure you that no or.e is
separated from Peace Corps serv
ice simply because he is "too
much of an intellectual." Con
versely, however, it takes a good
deal more than a good intellect
to make a productive Peace Corps
Volunteer.
We appreciate the depth of Mr.
Marx's disappointment. Needless
to say, we continue to wish him
well in what we hope will be suc
cessful pursuits at Stanford Uni
versity.

FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD
Editor, The Daily:
On Monday evening, October
14, the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commission distrib
uted questionnaires to a large por
tion of the freshman class. The
objective was to assay the fresh
men's opinion of the effectiveness
of the Fundamental Standard and
the Honor Code. Jan Handke's
letter to the Daily on October 16
indicates that the questionnaire
was regarded, at least by some,
with critical, constructive thought.
Miss Handke notes possible mis
conceptions arising from the
1963-64 Stanford Handbook con
cerning liquor on campus. Though
it is obviously impossible to im
pute intentions to the Adminis
tration, a Board of Trustees rul
ing exists which states that "The
use or possession by the students
of intoxicating liquors of any
kind on the Stanford campus (ex
cept in Married Student Housing)
is prohibited by the University."
However, in the past, the Student
Judicial Councils have taken ac
tion only in those situations
where drinking has led to de
struction of property and viola
tion of the rights of others.
In any case, actions which are
offensive to, or jeopardize the
rights, privileges and safety of
others represent a clear violation
of the Fundamental Standard.
