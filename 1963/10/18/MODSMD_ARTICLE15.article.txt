## U.S. Needs Leader of Charm: Goldwater Frank, Decisive 
### 
Travelling at present in Europe.
I am interested to find that many
Europeans — who know America
only through one or two news
papers and as many broadcasters
—are uneasy at the rise to popu
larity of Senator Goldwater. The
Senator's very frankness a n d
quick power of decision seem
faults to some people I talk with.
"Is that the democratic way?"
they ask.
Well, certainly there have been
many indecisive democratic poli
ticians, in our century. One such
was Jan Masaryk, who doomed
himself and Czechoslovakia by
flirting with the Communists un
til power was snatched from his
hands. But I do not believe that
democracy requires as leaders
men of faint heart and infirm pur
pose.
WHEN THE fountains of the
great deep are broken up. men of
remarkable gifts are needed to
lead a nation through its dangers.
Democracies naturally are slug
gish in action; also they tend to
be suspicious of political leaders
who display ambition and
strength. Can, then, the present
American democracy find public
men with that power of altering
or directing public opinion which
is almost magical?
In this century, only two Amer
ican presidents can be considered
as leaders of curious personal
magnetism: the two (very differ
ent) Roosevelts. The climate of
opinion of twentieth-century lib
eralism works against the accep
tance of decisive and farsighted
statesmen, preferring "modera
tion" or "muddling through." as
represented, say, by Mr. Harry
Truman or Mr. Harold Macmillan.
Churchills and Adenauers are
accepted only in crisis.
In his Democracy in America,
written a century and a quarter
ago, Alexis de Tocqueville dis
cussed this problem of American
democratic leadership. The lead

ers of the old Europe, Tocque
ville says, aspired to be men of
honor, the product of medieval
institutions and beliefs, is much
decayed as a moving power in our
time. In America, he continues,
the idea of honor survives only
in attenuated and altered form—
as in the American pressure upon
leaders to ''live chastely." Also
Americans esteem courage — the
courage of risk-taking and bold
enterpise, though commercial
rather than military.
TOCQUEVILLE suggests that,
almost deliberately, democratic
peoples force ambitious men to
waste their best years in s u r
mounting petty regulations and
requirements. So, in democratic
America, men of strong talents
are liable to lose themselves in
small and ephemeral successes.
"They are more apt 1o complete
a number of undertakings with
rapidity than to raise lasting
monuments of their achievements,
and they care much more for
success than for fame."
It seems to this commentator
that America now needs ur
gently the leader of charm and
strong character, possessed of a
sense of honor, and governed by
an understanding of free institu
tions. America needs proud men.
As Tocqueville put it, "Far from
thinking that humility ought to
be preached to our contempo
raries, I would have endeavors
made to give them more enlarged
ideas of themselves and of their
kind. Humility is unwholesome
to them; what they most want, in
my opinion, is pride. I would
willingly exchange several of our
small virtues for this one vice."
So I tell my European friends
that America is not going to cease
to be democratic — unless the
country fails to recognize the
just and decisive leaders without
whom a people become a timid
mob.
