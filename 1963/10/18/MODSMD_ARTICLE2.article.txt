# Sieveking Emphasizes History's Effect on German Democracy
## 
### MARSHA ROOD 
"The democratic tradition in Germany from the 11th century to
the present has been one of periodic waning and reviving," stated
Dr. Kurr Sieveking, President of the American Society of Hamburg,
at a Hoover Institute seminar yesterday afternoon in Tresidder
Union.
Dr. Sievcking's speech, "Tradition and the Future of Democracy

in Germany." gave a greater em--
phasis to the historic aspect of
German Democratic spirit in his
tory, than to the future of democ
racy in Germany.
TIIIO SPIRIT OF freedom, Dr.
Sieveking said, came out of t h e
birth of cities from the death of
the feudalistic order in the elev
enth century. It was then that
the towns of Germany began two
centuries of economic and politi
cal activity culminating in the
Hanscatic League. The system of

| government in these cities recog
! nized the worth of the individual
iris a part of the functioning eco
j nomic community.
This first "breath of freedom"
was not only dealt a crushing
blow when the II a n s e a t i c
League's monopoly was broken
by the Dutch and the English, but
when the power of the German
(central empire was lessened by
rural leaders who gained a strong
hold in tlit? government. This
: amounted to the loss of political
status of town, Dr. Sieveking
j stated.
It was not until the Industrial
Revolution that the revival of the
democratic spirit in Germany oc
, curred. This was due, he stated,
1 to the growing importance of the
labor class in the towns. The mid
dle class availed itself of the new
politics, and thus the communi
ties again became important.
"HOW COULI) HITLER have
overswept this democratic spirit
'that prevailed in Germany?" Dr.
Sieveking stated that it was the
failure of the democratic Weimar
Republic to provide for the basic
needs of the people that usured
in the rule of Hitler. The most
important blow dealt to the Re
public was the 1929 stock market
crash in the United States. This
crash caused the government and
the trade unions the loss of the
i people, and thus prepared the
way for Hitler's appointment as
chancellor.
The German people, he said,
were in a very unique situation
in World War II. They wished for
the defeat of a government that
encroached upon their democra
tic rights, and yet had to fight for
their existence as a nation.
FOR THE INSURANCE of
democracy in Germany for t h e
fture, Dr. Sieveking said that it
was imperitive to withstand the
first signs of any encroachment
upon their democratic rights. He
also stated that the youth must
be educated t<" have a democratic
conscience and to learn to accept
i csponNihility.

Tuesday, October 22, is the
deadline for filing candicacy ap
plications for April A.N., M.S.,
and Engineer degrees. Applica
tions must be signed by major
departments before being sub
mitted to the Graduate Study
Office, Room III.M, Registrar's
Office.

Hanscatic League. The system of

| government in these cities recog
! nized the worth of the individual
iris a part of the functioning eco
j nomic community.
This first "breath of freedom"
was not only dealt a crushing
blow when the II a n s e a t i c
League's monopoly was broken
by the Dutch and the English, but
when the power of the German
(central empire was lessened by
rural leaders who gained a strong
hold in tlit? government. This
: amounted to the loss of political
status of town, Dr. Sieveking
j stated.
It was not until the Industrial
Revolution that the revival of the
democratic spirit in Germany oc
, curred. This was due, he stated,
1 to the growing importance of the
labor class in the towns. The mid
dle class availed itself of the new
politics, and thus the communi
ties again became important.
"HOW COULI) HITLER have
overswept this democratic spirit
'that prevailed in Germany?" Dr.
Sieveking stated that it was the
failure of the democratic Weimar
Republic to provide for the basic
needs of the people that usured
in the rule of Hitler. The most
important blow dealt to the Re
public was the 1929 stock market
crash in the United States. This
crash caused the government and
the trade unions the loss of the
i people, and thus prepared the
way for Hitler's appointment as
chancellor.
The German people, he said,
were in a very unique situation
in World War II. They wished for
the defeat of a government that
encroached upon their democra
tic rights, and yet had to fight for
their existence as a nation.
FOR THE INSURANCE of
democracy in Germany for t h e
fture, Dr. Sieveking said that it
was imperitive to withstand the
first signs of any encroachment
upon their democratic rights. He
also stated that the youth must
be educated t<" have a democratic
conscience and to learn to accept
i csponNihility.

"The democratic tradition in Germany from the 11th century to
the present has been one of periodic waning and reviving," stated
Dr. Kurr Sieveking, President of the American Society of Hamburg,
at a Hoover Institute seminar yesterday afternoon in Tresidder
Union.
Dr. Sievcking's speech, "Tradition and the Future of Democracy

in Germany." gave a greater em--
phasis to the historic aspect of
German Democratic spirit in his
tory, than to the future of democ
racy in Germany.
TIIIO SPIRIT OF freedom, Dr.
Sieveking said, came out of t h e
birth of cities from the death of
the feudalistic order in the elev
enth century. It was then that
the towns of Germany began two

cal activity culminating in the
Hanscatic League. The system of
