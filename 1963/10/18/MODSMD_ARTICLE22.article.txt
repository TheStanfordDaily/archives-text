# Parsley Putting a Fine Art at Flo Mo
## 
### BILL MOORE Staff Editor 
David Welch, mind you, isn't
any ordinary hasher.
He isn't any extraordinary
hasher, either.
The title, to be sure, is Head
Parsley Putter and the accent
is on "parsley." To be sure.
"I'M TilK only permanent Head
Parsley Putter at Florence
Moore." boasts Welch, a junior
economics major. "Sometimes,
however, there's another part
time one."
At 6:05 every night of the week
Welch reports to the hashing line
at Flo Mo's central kitchen. His
job? To put parsley on the girl's
plates.
"I'm the last one in the line,"
he explains earnestly, "so by the
time the plate gets to me it al
ready has meat and potatoes on
it. I put the parsley next to the
meat."

WELCH, who just began basil
ing this quarter, got the job more
j because of his talent than li is
seniority.
"The rest of the hashers always
flip coins for the other positions
I in the line," he points out. "But
i it is kind of understood that I'm
I Parsley Putter."
And Welch couldn't be more de
lighted with the arrangement.
"You see, you get a feeling for
putting parsley after a while. It's
one of those great, deep-down,
hard-to-explain emotions. All 1
know is that it makes me so hap
py to put parsley because the
plates look so much prettier after
wards."
Welch, however, doesn't put
parsley like most Head Parsley
Putters. He's more imaginative.
"SOMETIMES I put the parsley
around the plate in interesting
designs," he says, with a big in
fectious smile. "That's, of course,
only for the late plates. Ot her
times — when they come back
j for seconds and nothing's left
! I'll give them a bowl full of par

sely."
At present Welch is trying to
cope with the problem of putting
parsley with his right hand. Or
dinarily, it wouldn't be so perplex
ing but he's left-handed.
"Till-: l'AKSMCY comes from
the wrong side, and that means I
have to use my right hand on the
parsley because my left hand is
holding the plate lids. As a result,
I can't put parsley as neatly as
I'd like to."
The Head Parsley Putter still
recalls with a trace of sadness the
night the kitchen ran out of pars
ley.
"1 had to dish ice cream." ho
moaned. "But 1 guess il wasn't
that bad. At least the ice cream
was green."
But even Welch admits re
luctantly that he can't, spend
all his hashing time putting pars-
Icy. And so, in •id' on to putting
parsley, he now ks in the dish
room after mea
Doing what .
"1 take the parsley off t h e
plates."
