# Frosh Seek Second Victory Against Tough USC Gridders
## 
### 
The frosh football team, last
j week's 53-0 conquerors of Santa
Clara, will meet a USC squad to
j morrow in Los Angeles, which
j coach Bill Walsh describes as "one
! of the most talented, toughest
| freshman teams they've ever
! fielded." The frosh will leave for
; Los Angeles this afternoon, tak
j ing on the Trojans at 10:00 a.m.
| as a preliminary to the varsity
j contest between USC and UCLA
! at 1:30 p.m.
I
Coach Walsh Says his team is
prepared for the test, and will
have "no excuses" should they be
defeated. "We have only two
! players lost because of injuries
fullback Mike Hibler and end
| Don DeSomdrie, so we're ready
i and it should he a great game."
ANOTHER FAC TOR wh i c h
' should make the game interesting
is the similarity of styles between
the two teams. Both the Indians
; and the Trojans have speed in
: the back field, and both have a
wide open offense with fine pass
ing attacks. "We're not afraid to
do some passing," said Walsh,
"and they have the same type of
attack as their varsity, employing
roll-outs, speedy halfbacks, a n d
a solid passing attack. I think
we are evenly matched in speed
and in the quarterback position;
! it should be a tight, well-played

| game."
Cited by Walsh for outstanding
play so far in the season were
tackles Jack Longinotti, and Jack
j Mills, end A 1 Wilburn and full
back Bill Ostrander all of whom
' are expected to be key figures in
I the effort against USC.
The frosh will also feature a
pair of 9.9 sprinters in the back
field in halfbacks Bob Blunt and
Bob Oar. Each scored in the
i team's opening victory against
; the Sanla Clara JV's, Blunt on a
j 63 yard punt return and Oar on
I a 21 yard pass from quarterback
Dave Lewis.
TilE PROBABLE starting line
up for tomorrow's game is Bob
Newberry and Wilburn at ends.
Longinotti and Mills at tackles,
1 Larry Volmert and Bob Arnon at
i guards, Otis Smith at center, and
Lewis Blunt, Oar, and Ostrander
j in the backfield.
Coach Walsh believes the trip
i will be a "good experience" 112 or
the team because it will be their
i first opportunity to play before
a massive audience when, especi
ally in ihe second half, early ar
rivers for the USC-UCLA game
will be thronging into the sta
dium.
"This is a big game for us, but
I'm optimistic about the team's
prospects. We have as much
speed and passing as they do,
and I believe that if we can get
by USC our chances are excellent
for going all the way."

"This is a big game for us, but

The frosh football team, last

Coach Walsh Says his team is
prepared for the test, and will
have "no excuses" should they be
defeated. "We have only two
! players lost because of injuries
fullback Mike Hibler and end
| Don DeSomdrie, so we're ready
i and it should he a great game."
ANOTHER FAC TOR wh i c h
' should make the game interesting
is the similarity of styles between
the two teams. Both the Indians
; and the Trojans have speed in
: the back field, and both have a
wide open offense with fine pass
ing attacks. "We're not afraid to
do some passing," said Walsh,
"and they have the same type of
attack as their varsity, employing
roll-outs, speedy halfbacks, a n d
a solid passing attack. I think
we are evenly matched in speed
and in the quarterback position;
! it should be a tight, well-played

| game."

play so far in the season were
tackles Jack Longinotti, and Jack
