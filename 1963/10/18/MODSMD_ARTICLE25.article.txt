# Water Poloists Nation's Best?
## 
### JUSTIN BECK 
Sports Editor
Stanford's water polo team at
home this weekend against UCLA
and Cerritos could be the best in
the nation this year. Last season
they came close, but losses to
Long Beach State and USC
dropped them to a third national
ranking behind those two clubs.
This season things have been
even better and indications are
that the club is going to improve
their national ranking.
In addition to the water polo
game with UCLA Saturday morn
ing the water polo squad will play
a second game, against Cerritos
starting at 3 p.m. in the Stanford
Pool.
So far this season in compiling
a 7-0 mark no opponent has come
any closer than nine goals to the
high flying Indians, and against
Cal the winning margin was 30
points, 32-2.
The tribe has also knocked off
San Francisco powerful Olympic
Club, usually the best team in
Northern California, 15-6. The win
was the first for the Indians
against the "O" Club since 1951.

A few hours after beating the
Olympics, Stanford soundly beat
Foothill, regarded a major threat
in the schedule. The game was
the closest the team had been in
all season, decided by a mere 10-1
Tribe Margin.
The mainspring of this year's
attack has been Marty Hull, a
junior who is hitting 53 per cent
of his shots while averaging
about four goals a game. He was
named to the AAU All-American
team last year and was outstand
ing in last spring's Pan-American
games.
In supporting roles are Pete
Pettigrew, second to Hull in scor
ing this year, and goalie George
Stransky who has allowed only
10 goals in the seven games in
which he has played thus far.
Both these players, in addition to
Hull, can be regarded as poten
tial Ail-Americans.
Almost forgotten this year is
another All-American Don Bue
hler who was picked to the AAU
team this summer. With Buehler,
the rest of the starting team, Bill
Ready, Mike Echleman, Bill Los
ton and such top flight reserves
as Brian Beck who scored seven
goals against Cal last weekend,
and Ron Kovas, the Indians have
a team that is probably the
strongest in their history.
But much of the credit for the
Indian's resurgence in the sport
must be given to their coach, Jim
Gaughran, himself a former
Stanford star. Gaughran took
over a squad that had finished
1-7 the year before, a win against
UCLA the season's only bright
spot. Last year, three year's after
becoming coach the Tribe were
16-5 and third in the nation.
But the Indians' biggest prob
lems this season are yet to come,
Long Beach and USC. Stanford
gets their chance against the na
tion's best October 26 when the
Trojans invade the Farm, and No
vember 2 when Long Beach comes
north.
USC should be particularly
tough. The Trojans boast of Roy
Saari, possibly the best in the
country. Saari has been averag
ing nine goals per game this
season.
If the Indians can slip by those
two teams, the Tribe should be
a sure bet for the nation's top
! spot in the national ranking.

In supporting roles are Pete
Pettigrew, second to Hull in scor
ing this year, and goalie George
Stransky who has allowed only
10 goals in the seven games in
which he has played thus far.
Both these players, in addition to
Hull, can be regarded as poten
tial Ail-Americans.
Almost forgotten this year is
another All-American Don Bue
hler who was picked to the AAU
team this summer. With Buehler,
the rest of the starting team, Bill
Ready, Mike Echleman, Bill Los
ton and such top flight reserves
as Brian Beck who scored seven
goals against Cal last weekend,
and Ron Kovas, the Indians have
a team that is probably the
strongest in their history.
But much of the credit for the
Indian's resurgence in the sport
must be given to their coach, Jim
Gaughran, himself a former
Stanford star. Gaughran took
over a squad that had finished
1-7 the year before, a win against
UCLA the season's only bright
spot. Last year, three year's after
becoming coach the Tribe were
16-5 and third in the nation.
But the Indians' biggest prob
lems this season are yet to come,
Long Beach and USC. Stanford
gets their chance against the na
tion's best October 26 when the
Trojans invade the Farm, and No
vember 2 when Long Beach comes
north.
USC should be particularly
tough. The Trojans boast of Roy
Saari, possibly the best in the
country. Saari has been averag
ing nine goals per game this
season.
If the Indians can slip by those
two teams, the Tribe should be
a sure bet for the nation's top
! spot in the national ranking.

Stanford's water polo team at
home this weekend against UCLA
and Cerritos could be the best in
the nation this year. Last season
they came close, but losses to
Long Beach State and USC
dropped them to a third national
ranking behind those two clubs.
This season things have been
even better and indications are
that the club is going to improve
their national ranking.
In addition to the water polo
game with UCLA Saturday morn
ing the water polo squad will play
a second game, against Cerritos
starting at 3 p.m. in the Stanford
Pool.
So far this season in compiling
a 7-0 mark no opponent has come
any closer than nine goals to the
high flying Indians, and against
Cal the winning margin was 30
points, 32-2.
The tribe has also knocked off
San Francisco powerful Olympic
Club, usually the best team in
Northern California, 15-6. The win
was the first for the Indians
against the "O" Club since 1951.

A few hours after beating the
Olympics, Stanford soundly beat
Foothill, regarded a major threat
in the schedule. The game was
the closest the team had been in
all season, decided by a mere 10-1
Tribe Margin.
The mainspring of this year's
attack has been Marty Hull, a
junior who is hitting 53 per cent
of his shots while averaging
about four goals a game. He was
named to the AAU All-American
team last year and was outstand
ing in last spring's Pan-American
games.
In supporting roles are Pete
Pettigrew, second to Hull in scor
ing this year, and goalie George
Stransky who has allowed only
10 goals in the seven games in
which he has played thus far.
