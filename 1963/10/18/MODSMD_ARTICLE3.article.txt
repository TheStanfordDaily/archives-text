# Bids Offered for SLAC Buildings; Completion in '67
## 
### 
Construction bids for two more
major buildings to comprise tho
"research complex" of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
i SLAC i were opened last Tues
day by ihe project's prime sub
contractor, Actron - Blum • Atkin
son.
ABA provides architect-engin
eer-manager services for SLAC,
which is building the $114 mil
lion, two-mile linear accelerator
and its associated structures un
der contract with the U.S. Atomic
Energy Com mission.
ABA announced that 12 bids
were received, and the apparent
low bid of $1,910,000 was sub
mitted by Engstrum and Nourse
of San Francisco. Other bids
ranged up to $2,415,000. All bids
arc now under study by SLAC
and AFJC officials, and award of
the contract is expected within
30 days.
At the same time, ABA an
nounced award of a $3,624,000
contract to Jasper Construction
Co. of Santa Cruz to build a 10,-
000-foot-long klystron gallery on
the accelerator site. Bids for this
building, which will house the 240
klystron tubes that will power the
the accelerator, were opened Sept.
20. Work is scheduled is start
Nov. I, with competion in April,
1965.
Construction of the two build
ings, seventh and eighth at the
Center, also should begin in No
vember.
One will be the Central Labor
atory Building, with 50,000 square
feet on three floors. It will be
used by SLAC physicists to plan
and build mock-ups of research
experiment to be carried out with
the accelerator.
The second, a Heavy Assembly
Building of 33,000 square feet on
one level, will be used for setting
up the experiments full-scale.
After first being put together
there, experiment o will be dis
mantled and moved to the accel
erator's target buildings where
the actual research can take place.
The two-mile linear accelerator,
largest research machine ever un
dertaken, will speed electrons
downs a 10,000-foot pipe at ap
proximately the speed of light. At
"end stations" yet to be built they
will smash into targets in an ef
fort to pry new secrets out of the
atom.
Although nine major buildings
and six minor ones will be erected
for SLAC operations. Construc
tion began in July 1962 and the
Center is expected to be ready for
full-scale research in the spring
of 1967.

Although nine major buildings
and six minor ones will be erected
for SLAC operations. Construc
tion began in July 1962 and the
Center is expected to be ready for
full-scale research in the spring
of 1967.
Construction bids for two more
major buildings to comprise tho
"research complex" of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
i SLAC i were opened last Tues
day by ihe project's prime sub
contractor, Actron - Blum • Atkin
son.
ABA provides architect-engin
eer-manager services for SLAC,
which is building the $114 mil
lion, two-mile linear accelerator
and its associated structures un
der contract with the U.S. Atomic
Energy Com mission.
ABA announced that 12 bids
were received, and the apparent
low bid of $1,910,000 was sub
mitted by Engstrum and Nourse
of San Francisco. Other bids
ranged up to $2,415,000. All bids
arc now under study by SLAC
and AFJC officials, and award of
the contract is expected within
30 days.
At the same time, ABA an
nounced award of a $3,624,000
contract to Jasper Construction
Co. of Santa Cruz to build a 10,-
000-foot-long klystron gallery on
the accelerator site. Bids for this
building, which will house the 240
klystron tubes that will power the
the accelerator, were opened Sept.
20. Work is scheduled is start
Nov. I, with competion in April,
1965.
Construction of the two build
ings, seventh and eighth at the
Center, also should begin in No
vember.
One will be the Central Labor
atory Building, with 50,000 square
feet on three floors. It will be
used by SLAC physicists to plan
and build mock-ups of research
experiment to be carried out with
the accelerator.
The second, a Heavy Assembly
Building of 33,000 square feet on
one level, will be used for setting
up the experiments full-scale.
After first being put together
there, experiment o will be dis
mantled and moved to the accel
erator's target buildings where
the actual research can take place.
The two-mile linear accelerator,
largest research machine ever un
dertaken, will speed electrons
downs a 10,000-foot pipe at ap
proximately the speed of light. At
"end stations" yet to be built they
will smash into targets in an ef
fort to pry new secrets out of the
atom.
