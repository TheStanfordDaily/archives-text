toughest test of the young season
this Saturday when they collide
with a strong San Jose State
eleven at 10:30 a.m. on the Stan

two common opponents with the
Indians. The Spartans edged Air

Jose a line team, picking them

to finish near the top of the
league. He singled out A 1 Korbas,
Dave Kingsly, and Ed Zumot as
the Spartan's primary individual
threats.

| ago for San Francisco U., load
S.F. to an upset 1-0 victory. Kor

San Jose 6-4, on the strength of

dians have scored one each.
