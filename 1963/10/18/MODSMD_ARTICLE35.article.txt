# CARDS TEST HUSKIES
## Stanford Hopes to AAWU Record 
### PETER EAKLAND 
For the third time this year,
Stanford will attempt to get bark
into the winning column, this
time against a Washington Husky
squad fresh from a stunning 34-7
victory over the Oregon State
Beavers. Defeated in its initial
Big Six outing, Stanford must
come out on top Saturday against
Washington if it is to stay in con
tention.
With a win, Stanford can undue
two losing streaks. The Tribe has
a three game losing streak it
would desperately like to snap
and also has been at the mercy of
the Huskies for the past four
years. Performing well in its last
two games, the Cards have been
each time, passed in the stretch.
The painful, hut fortunately cur
able disease called second half
anemia may have run its course.
And then again maybe Stanford
rooters will have to endure more
agonizing moments such as those
of the UCLA game just two
weeks ago.
WASHINGTON will he favored
to send the Tribe home on th e
short end of the score. This pre
diction is based primarily on its
strong showing against Oregon
State. Washington has not been
the powerhouse experts picked it
to be and cannot boast a record
any better than Stanford's.
The game may well turn out to
Ik 1 a hard-nosed battle of middle
of the line fullback carries. In
the Stanford corner are fullbacks
Glenn Myers and Tony DeLellis
who personally accounted for

more than half of the team's total
rushing yardage against Rice this
past weekend. For the first time
in many years, Stanford has been
covering more yards on the
ground than through the air.
Washington can match Stan
ford's dangerous duo with the
hard running of fullback Charlie
Browning and Junior Coffey.
Browning has given Husky sup
porters much to cheer about this
year. In losing causes, he rushed
83 yards against Pitt and 90
against Iowa. Going into last
Saturday's game, his average was
6.4 yards per carry.
WASHINGTON also boasts a
pairs of fine halfs in Ron Med
ved and Dave Kopay. Stanford's
Thurlow-Ragsdale halfback com
bination is one of the best in the
Conference. Not only good run
ners, they are both able passers
and pass catchers. Ragsdale is
also a fine offensive blocker and
a defensive standout.
Sophomores have crashed into
starting line ups on both teams.
Glenn Myers, impressive all sea
son despite a separated shoulder
early in the year, takes over for
the injured Ken Babajian. Sopho
mores Mike Connelly and Dick
Berg will share chores at the
quarterback spot, Connelly prob
ably receiving the nod for the
starting assignment.
Ron Medved, a talented sopho
more for the Huskies, has been
first string left-halfback since the
word go. He also is a good pass
receiver.
SEVERAL OF THE TROUBLES

that have hurt the Indians this
year have also plagued the Husk
ies. In its first three games,
Washington bobbed leven foot
balls and paid dearly for its mis
takes, losing eight of them.
Plagued by tlie red flag, Wash
ington has been called for many
penalties that have frequently in
terrupted the progress of Wash
ington's offense.
Washington kept its passing at
tack in the bank for a couple
of games, passing very seldom.
The Huskies now seem to have
gained interest on their invest
ment. Junior - quarterback Bill
Douglas, pitching for a 52.8 aver
age on the season, found open re
ceivers on 8 of 11 tosses for 135
yards during the recent Oregon
State encounter. Douglas is a cap
able runner also and leads the
team in total offense.
STANFORD quarterbacks also
like to pass, but they can not
claim equal success, unfortun
ately. The Tribe's last two losses
were direct results of intercepted
passes. If Stanford does not re
vert to its recent fumbling antics,
it will do well to stay on t he
grou nd.
If Stanford's defense is up to
par, Washington will not be able
to march up and down the field
at will, but will have to fight for
every inch. Having a capable de
fense, Stanford needs only a cap
able offense to change the com
plexion of the so-far dreary cam
paign. For this reason, Ralston
has had his team working exten
sively on offense this week. Two
touchdowns in the last two games
is a statistic that must be im
proved upon in upcoming games
if Stanford is to make a good
showing.
Ralston says that the team will
be in good condition injury-wise.
End Frank Patitucci received an
ankle sprain this week and will
be a doubtful starter'. Babajian
will not see action because of an
ankle injury incurred several
games ago. Bob Howard has re
covered from the flu which side
lined him at Rice and Carl Shroy
er, a defensive specialist and
punter, is back in action after
sitting out a week with a bone
bruise.


DICK RAGSDALE I eads the Indians into Seattle tomorrow with
hopes of ending a three-game losing streak. Washington, however,
with fullback Junior Coffey back in the starting lineup, is highly
favored to win.
