Speaking to an overflow crowd in Tresidder, Dr. Theodore Kreps,
professor emeritus of economics at Stanford, presented his "last
lecture" yesterday. This speech was the first of the "My Last Lec
ture Series."
Throughout his lecture, Dr. Kreps hammered at t he necessity for

awareness of the times by the<
common people. "A nation is as
great, ancl only as great as its
rank and file." ho said. "History
is made when the man on the
street wakes up."
I FIRMLY BELIEVE that there
will be a tomorrow and you can j
make that tomorrow happen,"
Kreps said. He challenged the
present generation to be "shapers
of tomorrow." "Great changes
come not through the action of
the conspicuous few," he noted,
but from the humble many."
Dr. Kreps stated that change
need not come through catastro
phe. "The establishment of a bet
ter society is not beyond history,"
he said.
He emphasized that the people
most strongly advocating this!
change by catastrophe, the right
wingers and the communists are j
not really so different. "They are .
the same kind of cat with thei
same smell," he said.
TURING TO BUSINESS he
stated "Whether studying busi- >
ness or not, you are a part of it." j
"Business needs more than free
enterprise, it needs great enter
prise," Dr. Kreps emphasized. "It
is reasonably easy to make a liv-;
ing, but very hard to make a life." j
ABOUT LABOR relations, Dr.!
Kreps stated that "The labor lead
ers are reflections of the i r I
bosses." "Businessmen make the |
kind of labor leaders they have." '
Concluding, Dr. Kreps said that i
there will always be resistance!
to change from those who have
prospered by the old system.

lecture" yesterday. This speech was the first of the "My Last Lec
ture Series."
Throughout his lecture, Dr. Kreps hammered at t he necessity for

awareness of the times by the<
common people. "A nation is as
great, ancl only as great as its
rank and file." ho said. "History
is made when the man on the
street wakes up."
I FIRMLY BELIEVE that there
will be a tomorrow and you can j
make that tomorrow happen,"
Kreps said. He challenged the
present generation to be "shapers
of tomorrow." "Great changes
come not through the action of
the conspicuous few," he noted,
but from the humble many."
Dr. Kreps stated that change
need not come through catastro
phe. "The establishment of a bet
ter society is not beyond history,"
he said.
He emphasized that the people
most strongly advocating this!
change by catastrophe, the right
wingers and the communists are j
not really so different. "They are .
the same kind of cat with thei
same smell," he said.
TURING TO BUSINESS he
stated "Whether studying busi- >
ness or not, you are a part of it." j
"Business needs more than free
enterprise, it needs great enter
prise," Dr. Kreps emphasized. "It
is reasonably easy to make a liv-;
ing, but very hard to make a life." j
ABOUT LABOR relations, Dr.!
Kreps stated that "The labor lead
ers are reflections of the i r I
bosses." "Businessmen make the |
kind of labor leaders they have." '
Concluding, Dr. Kreps said that i
there will always be resistance!
to change from those who have
prospered by the old system.
