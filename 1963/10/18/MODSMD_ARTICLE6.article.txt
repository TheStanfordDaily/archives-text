## 
### 
KINGSTON, R.I. (CPS- Para
digm, the University of Rhode
Island literary magazine was cen
sored because, according to John
I F. Quinn, vice-president for- stu
; dent affairs, certain passages in
a story were deemed "not suitable
for publication in a University
j sponsored magazine."
Dr. Quinn said the University
President Horn and an Advisory
| Council, came to unanimous
agreement that certain passages
from the story "Ballin" be de
leted.
The Rhode Island Student Sen
| ate passed a resolution condemn
i ing the university administra
; tion's handling of the case. Gerald
j McDowell, Senate president ,
| stressed that Senate disapproval
;is not so much aimed at the
j "solitary act of censorship, but at
the administration's policy to cen
sor anything which might pos
sibly be detrimental to the repu
tation of the University." Mc-
I Dowell objected to censorship
I used merely "when it suits the
j University."
The Beacon, the student news
paper, commenting on the case
â–  said, "A publication of this nature
is supposed to reflect the feelings,
the objectives and the ideals of a
young generation, and these
I should not be judged by the stand
ards of acceptance of another
1 generation of older people."
