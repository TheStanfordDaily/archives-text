# LASSU Protests Cutback Of Student Representation
## 
### ROD PECK 
Last night, in a majority action, the Legislature of the Associated
Students of Stanford University passed a resolution in protest of
the Administration's recent reduction of student representation on
the President's Committee on Student Affairs and Service from five
to three and the similar reduction of the Public Exercises Committee
from seven to three. â€”

Considering this tabled resolu
tion, the Legislature expressed
disapproval of the "disproportion
ate reduction in committee mem
bers." The resolution cited the
past contributions given and the
close cooperation achieved by stu
dent members.
LASSU President Bud Wedin
and many members of the Legis
lature expressed displeasure at
the few reasons given by the Ad
ministration in this reduction.
The sole rationale from the Ad
ministration stated that the com
mittee sizes had become unweildy
and that a change was therefore
in order. (Wedin pointed out that
the student representation on
cornmittes this year had been de
termined at three by the Adminis
tration. Presently, there are three
students and fifteen faculty mem
bers on the Student Affairs com
mittee. Student representation
was reduced by two from last
year and faculty representation
by one.
The method of selection of stu
dents for such committees h a s
been set up as a process whereby
suggested names are obtained
from the ASSU President, other
interested groups, and by individ
ual response. The President of
the University then selects stu
dents to serve on these commit
tees.
In other action, Ed Shaw, Stu
dent Financial Manager, pro
posed. and the Legislature ap
proved, a release of $6,307 from
ASSU funds to meet the present
shortage in funds for the con
struction of the Storke Student
Publications Building, future
home of Stanford's student and

ASSU publications. Because of
far higher construction bids than
were expected ($66,000), funds
from the Daily, Quad, and Chap
arrel to the amount of $59,593
were made available to meet the
difference. This was still short
of the necessary amount by $6,307.
and the LASSU moved to meet
this disparity.
A committee was appointed by
Wedin for research on the found
ing giant relative to the non-sec
tarian aspect of Stanford. This
committee will meet in conjunc
tion with members of the Daily
in an effort to clarify this part
of the grant.
Also appointed was a commit
tee to study the recent change in
the official University statement
on Student Government and the
Conduct of Students.
