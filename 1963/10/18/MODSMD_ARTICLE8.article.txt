# Texas Republican To Discuss Revolt
## 
### 
U.S. Congressman Ed Foreman
(R-Texas) will speak today in the
large lounge of Tresidder at 4:15
p.m. on "The Republican Revolt
in the South."
Foreman considers himself part
of the Republican "revolt" in the
once-solid-Democrat South. There
are now eleven G.O.P. Congress
men and one G.O.P. senator from
Southern states. Republican can
didates in the 1962 Congressional
elections gained seats in 5 South
ern states and lost none of their
incumbencies. They rolled up one
third of the total vote, even
though they contested only one
half of the Congressional seats.
The Republican "revolt" is seen
by .some as the result of a number
of forces, including the effects of
industrialization and urbaniza
tion. In general, the back-woods
element continues to vote Demo
cratic, while swifter means of
communication and transporta
tion have "diluted" the aneestal
tendencies of the urban South.
