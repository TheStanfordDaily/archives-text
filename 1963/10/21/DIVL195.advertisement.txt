TIRED OF ZEN?
Zen Buddhism is supposed to be "in' these days, and indeed
it is ci sophisticated and interesting philosophy of life. But
cioes it work? It keeps you busy with arts and disciplines of
living, but what about your deep, inner needs. You can Zen
all you want to, but it will not give you access to God and
bring you the love, peace, and joy of fellowship with the
Lord Jesus Christ.
!ln whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:
Who is the image of the invisible Cod, the first born of every creafuic- For
by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth visible
and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities or powers:
cjII things were created by him, and for him And he is before all tilings, and
by him all tilings consist (Col. 1.14-17).
If Buddha had created the world, it might be a different story.

TIRED OF ZEN?
Zen Buddhism is supposed to be "in' these days, and indeed
it is ci sophisticated and interesting philosophy of life. But
cioes it work? It keeps you busy with arts and disciplines of
living, but what about your deep, inner needs. You can Zen
all you want to, but it will not give you access to God and
bring you the love, peace, and joy of fellowship with the
Lord Jesus Christ.
!ln whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:
Who is the image of the invisible Cod, the first born of every creafuic- For
by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth visible
and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities or powers:
cjII things were created by him, and for him And he is before all tilings, and
by him all tilings consist (Col. 1.14-17).
If Buddha had created the world, it might be a different story.
