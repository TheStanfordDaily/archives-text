YOU have heard us mention Miss Revera Afflerbach who has been Forelady here at liable Shirts since 1918.
It is not often that one sees such allegiance, and we appreciate it. Also, she has been very nice to allow us
to bandy her name about in ads, books, etc. So we would like to proclaim something to honoi hei and also gi\c
us another excuse to bandy her name: The Afflerbach Golden Jubilee Year. ★ Now, ordinarily this wouldn't
occur until 1968, but why wait until the last moment? Besides, we have already struck a medal (see above). 1 lie
cloth in the shirt upon which the medal is hanging is also named after her: Afflerbach Cloth. It is made in
Switzerland to her specifications, which arc 20% wool and 80'e cotton. Her reasoning is interesting. She wanted
enough wool to make it very soft, but enough cotton to make it light and washable. Any more wool than
that and it's not a slwrt so much as a nice, if bulky, garment for woodchopping or other hearty activities.
★ Additionally, it is mothproof: if for no other reason than that no moth would be willing to go to all that
work for such scant nourishment. Afflerbach Cloth is the moth equivalent of pomegranates. Ihe Alllerbaeh Jubilee
Shirt comes, complete with medal as shown, in solid colors (flame red. midnight navy, loden green, winter white,
smoke blue) at about $13.00: and tartans, district checks and blazer stripes at about !> 14.00. wlierc\cr Eagle Shiits

YOU have heard us mention Miss Revera Afflerbach who has been Forelady here at liable Shirts since 1918.
It is not often that one sees such allegiance, and we appreciate it. Also, she has been very nice to allow us
to bandy her name about in ads, books, etc. So we would like to proclaim something to honoi hei and also gi\c
us another excuse to bandy her name: The Afflerbach Golden Jubilee Year. ★ Now, ordinarily this wouldn't
occur until 1968, but why wait until the last moment? Besides, we have already struck a medal (see above). 1 lie
cloth in the shirt upon which the medal is hanging is also named after her: Afflerbach Cloth. It is made in
Switzerland to her specifications, which arc 20% wool and 80'e cotton. Her reasoning is interesting. She wanted
enough wool to make it very soft, but enough cotton to make it light and washable. Any more wool than
that and it's not a slwrt so much as a nice, if bulky, garment for woodchopping or other hearty activities.
★ Additionally, it is mothproof: if for no other reason than that no moth would be willing to go to all that
work for such scant nourishment. Afflerbach Cloth is the moth equivalent of pomegranates. Ihe Alllerbaeh Jubilee
Shirt comes, complete with medal as shown, in solid colors (flame red. midnight navy, loden green, winter white,
smoke blue) at about $13.00: and tartans, district checks and blazer stripes at about !> 14.00. wlierc\cr Eagle Shiits
