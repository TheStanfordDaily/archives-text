## 
### PETER OAKLAND 
The Washington Huskies, after clicking for scores on three plays
from "way downtown" in the first two ancl one-half quarters, held
on to record a sweet, if not entirely deserved, 19-11 victory at Seattle
Saturday against a fast closing Stanford squad.
Stanford chipped away at Washington defenses for sustained
drives of 60, 51, and 50 yards, but ♦

scored a touchdown only once on
a 27-yard Dick Berg to Bob Burke
pass. On the other hand, Wash
ington exploded three dynamite
sticks in the Stanford ranks an
88-yard scamper by Hon Medved
and scoring passes of 38 and 32
yards from Bill Douglas to Jake
Kupp. Only one other time d i d
Washington enter Stanford terri
tory, thai time being stopped
cold by a tenacious goal line de
fense headed by Chuck McCor
mick.
Coach John Ralston said after
the game that lie was "real proud
of the team's overall perform
ance." He termed the game "our
best of the season. We're getting
better every week. Nobody in the
country practices any harder than
we do during the week, ft has to
pay off."
A CONTROVERSIAL penalty
destroyed Stanford's chance to
dead-heat the contest with two
minutes to go. With Dick Berg
at the controls, the Indians were
on the warpath, advancing deep
into Huskies' territory. On Wash
ington's 12 yard line, Steve Thur
low, running right, connected
with end Chuck McCormick in
the end zone.
One official raised his hands,
indicating a touchdown. Another
dropped a red cloth and cite d
Frank Patitucci for offensive
pass interference. Coach Ralston,
who very rarely will question a
referee's decision, couldn't under
stand the call.
Till; ri:\Al/TY stopped the
Cards' momentum, and they
couldn't regain it. Berg was
dropped behind the line of scrim
mage and then threw incomplete
into the end /one on fourth down
to end Ihe threat.
Again this week Stanford had
an edge in several statistics. Al
though Tribe runners couldn't
keep up with the Husky foot
soldiers who maneuvered for a
net 318 yards and although its
passers couldn't match Douglas'
perfect 5 for r> afternoon, S t a n
ford ran more plays in the game
than Washington and out first
downed the hometowners, 16-14.

football, fumbling nine times.
Stanford recovered three of the
bobbles, two within the Husky
thirty yard line, but could not
emulate Oregon and convert these
breaks into points.
Toward the end of the first
quarter, with Stanford's secon
dary playing men on the Huskies'
flankers, Ron Medved broke free
going over left guard and
streaked <S8 yards down the mid
dle of the field untouched for the
TD.
STANFORD couldn't muster a

first down, much less a drive,
until the second quarter. From
this point, discounting two inter
cepted passes, Stanford played
the offensive football it i> capable

time in the game, lauched two
missiles to Jake Kupp that caught
Stanford's DEW line defensive

system off guard. A personal foul

pass allowed Washington to kick
