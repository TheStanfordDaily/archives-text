Kingman Brewster, Jr., was
officially named the seventeenth
president of Yale University Sat

ended a five-month search for a
successor to A. Whitney Griswold,
who died in April.
A former professor at the Har
vard Law School, Brewster had
been serving as acting president
since Griswold's death. He had
been provost of Yale since 1960.
An editorial in the Yale Daily
News applauded the selection of
Brewster, "a man of exceptional
and varied talents, well suited to
lead a changing University. Mr.
Brewster should become one of
Yale's great presidents."
Several Yale graduates w i th
Harvard connections had been
considered candidates for the Yale
presidency. McGeorge Bun d y,
former Dean of the Faculty and
now special assistant to the Presi
dent for National Security Af
fairs, who was considered a lead
ing candidate, announced publicly
that he was not available.
Brewster was graduated from
Yale in 1911; he was chairman of
the Yale Daily News while in col
lege. After serving with the gov
ernment for a time, he studied
at the Harvard Law School from
1945 to 1948, was on MlT's faculty
as a research associate in eco
nomics for a year, and joined the
Law School faculty in 1950.
After ten years on the faculty,
and seven as a full professor of
Law, Brewster became provost of
Yale in 1960 at the request of his
personal friend, President Gris
wold.
