PEACE CORPS
Editor, The Daily:
Since my last letter to The
Daily evoked such an immediate
response from the Peace Corps,
and since letters sent to Wash
ington have either been ignored
or left unanswered for several
weeks, I hope that the dialogue
can be continued in this manner.
Mr. Woodard says that 'on
October 9 the Director of Selec
tion (Dr. S. J. Kaplan) advised
(me) that the decision of the
Board had been sustained and was
final.' I didn't receive Dr. Kap
lan's letter, which is quoted at
length by Mr. Woodard, until the
day after I had written to the
Daily - October 17. Although
dated October 9, it was post
marked on the 16. The questions
which I posed to Dr. Kaplan in
my appeal were no further clari
fied by what he said in response:
'The determinant for selection is
the composite of opinions and ob
servations and grades provided
by all who have been asked to
evaluate the candidate.'
In my reply to Dr. Kaplan, I
asked that if this were the deter
minant, then how did he explain
the Oberlin faculty protest of the
decision. And how did the peti
tion of my fellow trainees 'con
tribute' to his sustaining of t he
Board's action? All that ho ac
tually said was that 'there was
other material, however, suggest
ing that your personality might
possibly be one that would better
succeed in a capacity other than
that of a Peace Corps volunteer
(sic).'
Mr. Shriver's statement to the
House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee, reported in the New York
Times of October 16. 1963. is
somewhat less noncommital but
contains no more information:
'We recently selected out of train
ing a magna cum laude, Phi Beta
Kappa graduate of one of o u r
leading universities; he did not
have the personality to match his
intelligence. The best efforts of
his supporters, which included
some very distinguished names,
failed to convince our selecting
officers otherwise.'
If 'personality' is to be graded
in the same manner as intellec
tual potential, what defense can
I offer but the testimony of those
Who know me? I ask again, as
I did in my appeal, that one
specify what 'material' it w a s
that suggested 'that my person
ality might possibly be one that
would better succeed in a capacity
other than that of a Peace Corps
Volunteer.' As I did before, I
challenge Dr. Kaplan, Mr. Wood
ard or Mr. Shriver to show that
such material exists. I don't think
there is anything in my past
which could possibly be relevant
to this decision that I would not
be willing to disclose or defend
publicly. I think the casting of
aspersions upon my character by
the intimation of the existence of
'hidden facts' comprises a wrong
that is not justified even by the
demands of bureaucratic effi
ciency.

Editor, The Daily:
One of the most frequent ques
tions asked about Peace Corps
service concerns the attitude of
the people whom the Peace Corps
Volunteer is attempting to help.
Much emphasis has been placed
upon the traditional apathy and
general lack of concern for prog
ress encountered among villagers
by the PC community develop
ment worker. It should be clari
fied that there are many people
in these villages who do want
to help themselves. It is through
these concerned individuals that
the PCV works to generate inter
est in specific projects and gen
eral progress. If there is apathy,
he is no more frustrated than
they are.
In most cases, the villagers want
progress, but under their own
terms, and the PCV has had to
evaluate and adapt his own
standards. In general, he has en
countred a willingness to work
for progress I hat is often surpris
ing, but always gratifying. True,
the specific goals and projects de
sired by the villagers might not
be those which he might have
conceived as best for them, but
it is his responsibility to adjust.
It is here that the much publi

cized psychological difficulties
lie, not in resigning himself to
any inertia of the people, but in
adapting his ideas of progress to
theirs.
It should be emphasized that
PCV's have generally encount
ered their real stumbling blocks
not in promoting local interest
and active participation in a
project, but at the government
levels (both host country and US)
when they have approached these
entities for material support for
the project. Despite inertia on
these levels, the Peace Corps is
slowly convincing host counlry
government agencies and US Aid
officials of the benefits derived
from villages participating in
self-help projects, chosen and
executed by the villagers them
selves, for their own development.
The human resources are avail
able and wailing, some of them
impatiently; the government and
development agencies must step
down to meet them.

REPLIES TO MR. SHURTLEFF
Editor, The Daily:
Re: Jeffrey Shurtleff's letter,
"Types of Students": did not the
student mentioned choose the
ROTC of his own volition? Was
! not the decision his?
—KIRBV SCARBOROUGH
Editor, The Daily:
There once was a very righteous
man who if tie prayed said: "Lord,
Lord, grant that I may always
keep your commandment to do
no murder, therefore keep the
draft from me." During his life
this righteous man saw his
friends and neighbors and his
friends' and neighbors' friends
and neighbors threatened by great
tribes of the ungodly. Although
he wrote letters of protest to his
own neighbors and judged that
they did not love their enemies
enough (his neighbors were pre
paring to defend their own neigh
bors against the weapons of the
ungodly), he did not show any
displeasure when the great tribes
of the ungodly enslaved his more
distant neighbors' neighbors.
At this time there was a humble
man who when he finished his
prayers made the sign of the
cross. During his life this man
saw his friends and neighbors
and his friends' and neighbors'
friends and neighbors threatened
continually by great tribes of the
ungodly. Because he longed for
peace on this earth to men of
good will, he was prepared to
perish by Ihe sword so that his
neighbors might live.
Which of these men truly loved
his neighbors?

TA REPLIES
Editor, The Daily:
Several problems regarding
teaching assistants in the sciences
could be alleviated if the depart
ments would follow some basic
principles in selecting TA's and
administering the TA program.
1 > Selection of TA's for a
course should be made with con
sideration given to the capabili
ties and liabilities of the TA in
question. First year graduate stu
dents should not teach upper divi
sion courses unless very well
qualified. A TA should not be
required to teach a course for
which he has no background.
Granted that the TA experience
is meant to broaden the TA's hori
zons, it is still unfair to the stu
dents if their TA lacks experience.
2) After selection, first year
TA's should be given some basic
"dos" and "don'ts" of lecturing
as well as pointers on leading dis
cussions and making classroom
demonstrations. This TA instruc
tion should be given by a senior
faculty member who is known
for his teaching abilities and by
all means should not be left up
to the individual course instruc
tor or the TA.
3) The instructor should make
very clear to the TA's what he
wants to accomplish in the course,
to that the TA will be able to sup
plement his lectures. TA's should
be required to attend lectures and
prepare adequately for all class
sessions. For example, if a TA
merely looks over a lab procedure
just before entering the class

room, the results can be disast
rous. Each TA should perform the
experiment in advance (regard
less of how simple it is or how
many times he has performed it).
so that he can warn the students
of what might go wrong and mod
! ify the proceedure accordingly.
4) TA positions in the sciences
should be made financially attrac
tive so as to entice competent
teachers away from the ample
grant funds available.
5) A TA should be given mini
mum responsibilities outside of
; his TA job the quarter he is teach
i ing, so that he can devote most of
i his time to giving his students
| the best possible instruction of
which he is capable.

Just a few comments on Mr. M.
O. Freeman's letter of October 16
condemning audience behavior
! during Sunday night's flick, "Bar
: abbas." His reaction showed he
, didn't, have the perception to
realize that such a film was speci
fically, deliberately designed to
play upon the audience's every
bit of religious emotionalism, pro
voking Ihe expected, dogmatic re
sponse. The film itself was poorly
done (from a technical viewpoint)
I—a Biblical farce, worthy of what
it got. Just because Mr. M. O.
I Freeman Jr. could not differen
tiate emotionally between a two
bit, Hollywood extravaganza and

—JANET HOWELL
Editor, The Daily:
In response to M. O. Freeman's
j letter concerning the Sunday
i night entertainment which is pro
vided for and by the students, we
wish to suggest that he ignores
the purpose of and possible good
which can come from these mean
ingful experiences.
Mr. Freeman should be aware
that the "flicks" are not meant
merely to be observed passively
but rather require active partici
i pation. In this participation is
found the true value of this ac
tivity. The foremost purpose of
] this experience is therapeutic. By
i bringing to the conscious level all
the repressions of the uncon
scious and facilitating an emo
tional discharge, the "flicks" and
the accompanying student expres
sion are great preventatives of
neurotic illness.
Critics of these events, them
selves, seem to be the victims of
neurotic anxiety. In their neu
rosis, their instinct life has been
j more or less inhibited, leading to
I instinctual tensions which are dis
charged in anxiety. Their feelings
i of guilt for the other students
j probably conceal an ungratified
! object libido which is striving
for gratification project e d
through delusion into religious
fervor.
Rather than encouraging stu
dents to chastise each other,
rather than presuming to direct
the president of this university,
critics might find it wise to sub
stitute more specialized psychia
tric treatment for attendance at
the "Sunday night flicks."

Editor, The Daily:
This letter is in reply to that j
misguided, unfortunate Fresh
man boy who was unnerved and I
shaken by the audience at the
showing of "Barabbas" last Sun
day. Despite the length of his
| letter to ihe editor, only one point
i was made: the deportment of tho
audience displayed "sacrilege
and desecration." I would suggest |
that very few people there
thought the crucifixion of Christ |
as something to be honored and
reverred. Furthermore, no one
has a right to demand that any
one pay respect to the crucufixion
displayed at a Stanford function.
If Mr. M. O. Freeman wishes to
express his reverence for the cru- j
cifixion, J would think it more!
reasonable to go to a church and I
not to the Sunday Flicks. Now j
certainly people will argue that
the wild antics of the audience at
the Flicks is destructive and leads
to group hysteria where the in
dividual loses his inhibitions.
First, are these actions of the au
dience destructive? I would say
that Mom Aud through the years
has withstood the Sunday Flicks
admirably. That the darkened
theater and the group presence
lead to a slakening of normal in
hibitions is certainly true. So
what? If people want to release
pent up emotions by screaming j
and yelling at the Flicks in a
harmless manner, let them. Those
people who are insulted or aston
ished at this, should not attend
the Flicks. This applies also to
children; the Flicks is a Stanford
student function not a public util
ity. And furthermore, Mr. M. O.
Freeman, to suggest that the com
portment of the audience was im
! mature illustrates an alarmingly
; inadequate knowledge of human
j nature which as you grow older

REPLY TO MR. CALM A
Editor, The Daily:
The second (of an undoubtedly
unparalleled series) letter from
Jacques Calma appeared in the
Daily October 12. Some amusing
j background might be of interest
| to you. Jacques has been wres
; tling with this Great Concern for
at least six months (that I know
:of and quite possibly for even
longer that that). He was finally
I invited to be the guest of th e
| AVVS Social Regulations Commit
! tee for dinner and a long meet
ing afterwards last spring quar
ter so that he could pursue dis
cussion of his confusion as to the
! Intent of the social regulations
and his Concern for Sexual Free
dom. The hope of the committee,
in fulfilling its obligation to talk
with Mr Calma, was that Jacques
' would at least be less confused
after some discussion. Unfortun
ately, Jacques is still confused.
I find it extremely interesting
to note that Mr. Calma seems
upset about the Intent and Impli
-1 cation of the Women's Social
Regulations than are Stanford
women themselves. He seems rle
-1 termined to incite a Sexual Revo
| lut ion on the Stanford campus,
but he doesn't seem to he getting
| much response from the women
i whose Freedom he is trying to
protect. Isn't that strange . . .
Nonetheless, I would like to
' take issue with several points
raised by Mr. Calma in his letters
; to the Daily:
1> Please define "conventional,
I off-campus morality," distinguish
!it from "on-campus morality"
! (my quotes I, justify and docu
j ment so-called administrative dis
; tinction between the two, and
I then, if you can, justify statement
{ that the "administrative purpose
in sanctioning and enforcing Fun
j stan is to placate exponents of off-
I campus morality." Before doing
: any of this, re-read the "Funstan"
in both its original and recently
revised forms.
21 Justify your broad and un
substantiated generalization to
j the effect that student and Ad
; ministration interests are essen
| tially contrary.
3> Please tell me "what is"
| I'm dying to know.
; 4) Your correlation between "a
! girl's own sexual taboos" and the
meaning of the word "standards"
is abstruse, at best. If it's the
product of Brilliant Insight, prove
it.
5) The last two paragraphs of
your letter, in which you tell us
what the Social Regulations mean
and explain the intentions,
| thought, and past and present ac
tion of the Administration, are
not only highly presumptuous but
also, to my knowledge, are totally
false. Please substantiate.
6) Last but not least, let's give
credit and blame where both are
due. I refer to repetition of "The
Dean and Assistant Dean of Wom
en . . in your first letter. Stu
. dents are responsible for the AWS
j Social Regulations.

Since my last letter to The

response from the Peace Corps,
and since letters sent to Wash

or left unanswered for several
weeks, I hope that the dialogue
can be continued in this manner.
Mr. Woodard says that 'on
October 9 the Director of Selec

(me) that the decision of the
Board had been sustained and was
final.' I didn't receive Dr. Kap

length by Mr. Woodard, until the

dated October 9, it was post

which I posed to Dr. Kaplan in
my appeal were no further clari
fied by what he said in response:
'The determinant for selection is
the composite of opinions and ob
servations and grades provided
by all who have been asked to
evaluate the candidate.'
In my reply to Dr. Kaplan, I
asked that if this were the deter
minant, then how did he explain
the Oberlin faculty protest of the
decision. And how did the peti

Board's action? All that ho ac

possibly be one that would better
succeed in a capacity other than
that of a Peace Corps volunteer

Mr. Shriver's statement to the
House Foreign Affairs Commit

somewhat less noncommital but
contains no more information:
'We recently selected out of train

leading universities; he did not
have the personality to match his

One of the most frequent ques

service concerns the attitude of
the people whom the Peace Corps
Volunteer is attempting to help.
Much emphasis has been placed
upon the traditional apathy and
general lack of concern for prog
ress encountered among villagers
by the PC community develop
ment worker. It should be clari
fied that there are many people
in these villages who do want
to help themselves. It is through
these concerned individuals that
the PCV works to generate inter
est in specific projects and gen
eral progress. If there is apathy,
he is no more frustrated than
they are.
In most cases, the villagers want
progress, but under their own
terms, and the PCV has had to
evaluate and adapt his own
standards. In general, he has en
countred a willingness to work
for progress I hat is often surpris
ing, but always gratifying. True,
the specific goals and projects de
sired by the villagers might not
be those which he might have
conceived as best for them, but
it is his responsibility to adjust.
It is here that the much publi

cized psychological difficulties
lie, not in resigning himself to
any inertia of the people, but in
adapting his ideas of progress to
theirs.
It should be emphasized that
PCV's have generally encount
ered their real stumbling blocks
not in promoting local interest
and active participation in a
project, but at the government
levels (both host country and US)
when they have approached these
entities for material support for
the project. Despite inertia on
these levels, the Peace Corps is
slowly convincing host counlry
government agencies and US Aid

from villages participating in
self-help projects, chosen and

This letter is in reply to that j
misguided, unfortunate Fresh
man boy who was unnerved and I
shaken by the audience at the
showing of "Barabbas" last Sun
day. Despite the length of his
| letter to ihe editor, only one point
i was made: the deportment of tho
audience displayed "sacrilege
and desecration." I would suggest |
that very few people there
thought the crucifixion of Christ |
as something to be honored and
reverred. Furthermore, no one
has a right to demand that any
one pay respect to the crucufixion
displayed at a Stanford function.
If Mr. M. O. Freeman wishes to
express his reverence for the cru- j
cifixion, J would think it more!
reasonable to go to a church and I
not to the Sunday Flicks. Now j
certainly people will argue that
the wild antics of the audience at
the Flicks is destructive and leads
to group hysteria where the in
dividual loses his inhibitions.
First, are these actions of the au
dience destructive? I would say
that Mom Aud through the years
has withstood the Sunday Flicks
admirably. That the darkened
theater and the group presence
lead to a slakening of normal in
hibitions is certainly true. So
what? If people want to release
pent up emotions by screaming j
and yelling at the Flicks in a
harmless manner, let them. Those
people who are insulted or aston
ished at this, should not attend
the Flicks. This applies also to
children; the Flicks is a Stanford
student function not a public util
ity. And furthermore, Mr. M. O.
Freeman, to suggest that the com
portment of the audience was im
! mature illustrates an alarmingly
; inadequate knowledge of human
j nature which as you grow older

REPLY TO MR. CALM A

unparalleled series) letter from

j background might be of interest

; tling with this Great Concern for
at least six months (that I know
:of and quite possibly for even
longer that that). He was finally
I invited to be the guest of th e
| AVVS Social Regulations Commit
! tee for dinner and a long meet
ing afterwards last spring quar
ter so that he could pursue dis
cussion of his confusion as to the
! Intent of the social regulations
and his Concern for Sexual Free
dom. The hope of the committee,
in fulfilling its obligation to talk
with Mr Calma, was that Jacques
' would at least be less confused
after some discussion. Unfortun
ately, Jacques is still confused.
I find it extremely interesting
to note that Mr. Calma seems
upset about the Intent and Impli
-1 cation of the Women's Social
Regulations than are Stanford
women themselves. He seems rle
-1 termined to incite a Sexual Revo
| lut ion on the Stanford campus,
but he doesn't seem to he getting
| much response from the women
i whose Freedom he is trying to
protect. Isn't that strange . . .

I off-campus morality," distinguish
!it from "on-campus morality"
! (my quotes I, justify and docu
j ment so-called administrative dis

I then, if you can, justify statement
{ that the "administrative purpose
in sanctioning and enforcing Fun
j stan is to placate exponents of off-
I campus morality." Before doing
: any of this, re-read the "Funstan"
in both its original and recently
revised forms.
21 Justify your broad and un
substantiated generalization to
j the effect that student and Ad

3> Please tell me "what is"

; 4) Your correlation between "a

meaning of the word "standards"
is abstruse, at best. If it's the
product of Brilliant Insight, prove
it.
5) The last two paragraphs of

what the Social Regulations mean
and explain the intentions,
| thought, and past and present ac
tion of the Administration, are
not only highly presumptuous but
also, to my knowledge, are totally

'The determinant for selection is

In my reply to Dr. Kaplan, I
asked that if this were the deter

—JANET HOWELL
Editor, The Daily:
In response to M. O. Freeman's
j letter concerning the Sunday
i night entertainment which is pro
vided for and by the students, we
wish to suggest that he ignores
the purpose of and possible good
which can come from these mean
ingful experiences.
Mr. Freeman should be aware
that the "flicks" are not meant
merely to be observed passively
but rather require active partici
i pation. In this participation is
found the true value of this ac
tivity. The foremost purpose of
] this experience is therapeutic. By
i bringing to the conscious level all
the repressions of the uncon
scious and facilitating an emo
tional discharge, the "flicks" and
the accompanying student expres
sion are great preventatives of
neurotic illness.
Critics of these events, them
selves, seem to be the victims of
neurotic anxiety. In their neu
rosis, their instinct life has been
j more or less inhibited, leading to
I instinctual tensions which are dis
charged in anxiety. Their feelings
i of guilt for the other students
j probably conceal an ungratified
! object libido which is striving
for gratification project e d
through delusion into religious
fervor.
Rather than encouraging stu
dents to chastise each other,
rather than presuming to direct
the president of this university,
critics might find it wise to sub
stitute more specialized psychia
tric treatment for attendance at
the "Sunday night flicks."

bad by saying it could be worse

Tension can be, and should be

i was made: the deportment of tho
audience displayed "sacrilege
and desecration." I would suggest |
that very few people there
thought the crucifixion of Christ |
as something to be honored and

i was made: the deportment of tho

that very few people there
thought the crucifixion of Christ |

has a right to demand that any

Editor, The Daily:
Just a few comments on Mr. M.
O. Freeman's letter of October 16
condemning audience behavior
! during Sunday night's flick, "Bar
: abbas." His reaction showed he
, didn't, have the perception to
realize that such a film was speci
fically, deliberately designed to
play upon the audience's every
bit of religious emotionalism, pro
voking Ihe expected, dogmatic re
sponse. The film itself was poorly
done (from a technical viewpoint)
I—a Biblical farce, worthy of what
it got. Just because Mr. M. O.
I Freeman Jr. could not differen
tiate emotionally between a two
bit, Hollywood extravaganza and
Ihe "real thing" is no reason to
condemn those who could—and
expressed themselves accordingly.
—JANET HOWELL
Editor, The Daily:
In response to M. O. Freeman's
j letter concerning the Sunday
i night entertainment which is pro
vided for and by the students, we
wish to suggest that he ignores
the purpose of and possible good
which can come from these mean
ingful experiences.
Mr. Freeman should be aware
that the "flicks" are not meant
merely to be observed passively
but rather require active partici
i pation. In this participation is
found the true value of this ac
tivity. The foremost purpose of
] this experience is therapeutic. By
i bringing to the conscious level all
the repressions of the uncon
scious and facilitating an emo
tional discharge, the "flicks" and
the accompanying student expres
sion are great preventatives of
neurotic illness.
Critics of these events, them
selves, seem to be the victims of
neurotic anxiety. In their neu
rosis, their instinct life has been
j more or less inhibited, leading to
I instinctual tensions which are dis
charged in anxiety. Their feelings
i of guilt for the other students
j probably conceal an ungratified
! object libido which is striving
for gratification project e d
through delusion into religious
fervor.
Rather than encouraging stu
dents to chastise each other,
rather than presuming to direct

stitute more specialized psychia

TA REPLIES
Editor, The Daily:
Several problems regarding
teaching assistants in the sciences
could be alleviated if the depart
ments would follow some basic
principles in selecting TA's and
administering the TA program.
1 > Selection of TA's for a
course should be made with con
sideration given to the capabili
ties and liabilities of the TA in
question. First year graduate stu
dents should not teach upper divi
sion courses unless very well
qualified. A TA should not be
required to teach a course for
which he has no background.
Granted that the TA experience
is meant to broaden the TA's hori
zons, it is still unfair to the stu
dents if their TA lacks experience.
2) After selection, first year
TA's should be given some basic
"dos" and "don'ts" of lecturing
as well as pointers on leading dis
cussions and making classroom
demonstrations. This TA instruc
tion should be given by a senior
faculty member who is known
for his teaching abilities and by
all means should not be left up
to the individual course instruc
tor or the TA.
3) The instructor should make
very clear to the TA's what he
wants to accomplish in the course,
to that the TA will be able to sup
plement his lectures. TA's should
be required to attend lectures and
prepare adequately for all class
sessions. For example, if a TA
merely looks over a lab procedure
just before entering the class

room, the results can be disast
rous. Each TA should perform the
experiment in advance (regard
less of how simple it is or how
many times he has performed it).
so that he can warn the students
of what might go wrong and mod
! ify the proceedure accordingly.
4) TA positions in the sciences
should be made financially attrac
tive so as to entice competent
teachers away from the ample
grant funds available.
5) A TA should be given mini
mum responsibilities outside of
; his TA job the quarter he is teach
i ing, so that he can devote most of
i his time to giving his students
| the best possible instruction of
which he is capable.

Several problems regarding
teaching assistants in the sciences
could be alleviated if the depart
ments would follow some basic
principles in selecting TA's and
administering the TA program.
1 > Selection of TA's for a
course should be made with con
sideration given to the capabili
ties and liabilities of the TA in
question. First year graduate stu
dents should not teach upper divi
sion courses unless very well
qualified. A TA should not be
required to teach a course for
which he has no background.
Granted that the TA experience
is meant to broaden the TA's hori
zons, it is still unfair to the stu
dents if their TA lacks experience.
2) After selection, first year
TA's should be given some basic
"dos" and "don'ts" of lecturing
as well as pointers on leading dis
cussions and making classroom
demonstrations. This TA instruc
tion should be given by a senior
faculty member who is known
for his teaching abilities and by
all means should not be left up
to the individual course instruc
tor or the TA.
3) The instructor should make
very clear to the TA's what he
wants to accomplish in the course,
to that the TA will be able to sup
plement his lectures. TA's should
be required to attend lectures and
prepare adequately for all class
sessions. For example, if a TA
merely looks over a lab procedure
just before entering the class

rous. Each TA should perform the
experiment in advance (regard
less of how simple it is or how

One of the most frequent ques
tions asked about Peace Corps
service concerns the attitude of
the people whom the Peace Corps
Volunteer is attempting to help.
Much emphasis has been placed
upon the traditional apathy and
general lack of concern for prog
ress encountered among villagers
by the PC community develop
ment worker. It should be clari
fied that there are many people
in these villages who do want
to help themselves. It is through
these concerned individuals that
the PCV works to generate inter
est in specific projects and gen
eral progress. If there is apathy,
he is no more frustrated than
they are.
In most cases, the villagers want
progress, but under their own
terms, and the PCV has had to
evaluate and adapt his own
standards. In general, he has en
countred a willingness to work
for progress I hat is often surpris
ing, but always gratifying. True,
the specific goals and projects de
sired by the villagers might not
be those which he might have
conceived as best for them, but
it is his responsibility to adjust.
It is here that the much publi

cized psychological difficulties
lie, not in resigning himself to
any inertia of the people, but in
adapting his ideas of progress to
theirs.
It should be emphasized that
PCV's have generally encount
ered their real stumbling blocks
not in promoting local interest
and active participation in a
project, but at the government
levels (both host country and US)
when they have approached these
entities for material support for
the project. Despite inertia on
these levels, the Peace Corps is
slowly convincing host counlry
government agencies and US Aid
officials of the benefits derived
from villages participating in
self-help projects, chosen and
executed by the villagers them
selves, for their own development.
The human resources are avail
able and wailing, some of them
impatiently; the government and
development agencies must step
down to meet them.

Several problems regarding
teaching assistants in the sciences
could be alleviated if the depart
ments would follow some basic
principles in selecting TA's and
administering the TA program.
1 > Selection of TA's for a
course should be made with con
sideration given to the capabili
ties and liabilities of the TA in
question. First year graduate stu
dents should not teach upper divi
sion courses unless very well
qualified. A TA should not be
required to teach a course for
which he has no background.
Granted that the TA experience
is meant to broaden the TA's hori
zons, it is still unfair to the stu
dents if their TA lacks experience.
2) After selection, first year
TA's should be given some basic
"dos" and "don'ts" of lecturing
as well as pointers on leading dis
cussions and making classroom
demonstrations. This TA instruc
tion should be given by a senior
faculty member who is known
for his teaching abilities and by
all means should not be left up
to the individual course instruc
tor or the TA.
3) The instructor should make
very clear to the TA's what he
wants to accomplish in the course,
to that the TA will be able to sup
plement his lectures. TA's should
be required to attend lectures and
prepare adequately for all class
sessions. For example, if a TA

just before entering the class

rous. Each TA should perform the
experiment in advance (regard

Editor, The Daily:
Since my last letter to The
Daily evoked such an immediate
response from the Peace Corps,
and since letters sent to Wash
ington have either been ignored
or left unanswered for several
weeks, I hope that the dialogue
can be continued in this manner.
Mr. Woodard says that 'on
October 9 the Director of Selec
tion (Dr. S. J. Kaplan) advised
(me) that the decision of the
Board had been sustained and was
final.' I didn't receive Dr. Kap
lan's letter, which is quoted at
length by Mr. Woodard, until the
day after I had written to the
Daily - October 17. Although
dated October 9, it was post
marked on the 16. The questions
which I posed to Dr. Kaplan in
my appeal were no further clari
fied by what he said in response:
'The determinant for selection is
the composite of opinions and ob
servations and grades provided
by all who have been asked to
evaluate the candidate.'
In my reply to Dr. Kaplan, I
asked that if this were the deter
minant, then how did he explain
the Oberlin faculty protest of the
decision. And how did the peti
tion of my fellow trainees 'con
tribute' to his sustaining of t he
Board's action? All that ho ac
tually said was that 'there was
other material, however, suggest
ing that your personality might
possibly be one that would better
succeed in a capacity other than
that of a Peace Corps volunteer
(sic).'
Mr. Shriver's statement to the
House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee, reported in the New York
Times of October 16. 1963. is
somewhat less noncommital but
contains no more information:
'We recently selected out of train
ing a magna cum laude, Phi Beta
Kappa graduate of one of o u r
leading universities; he did not
have the personality to match his
intelligence. The best efforts of
his supporters, which included
some very distinguished names,
failed to convince our selecting
officers otherwise.'
If 'personality' is to be graded
in the same manner as intellec
tual potential, what defense can
I offer but the testimony of those
Who know me? I ask again, as
I did in my appeal, that one
specify what 'material' it w a s
that suggested 'that my person
ality might possibly be one that
would better succeed in a capacity
other than that of a Peace Corps
Volunteer.' As I did before, I
challenge Dr. Kaplan, Mr. Wood
ard or Mr. Shriver to show that
such material exists. I don't think
there is anything in my past
which could possibly be relevant
to this decision that I would not
be willing to disclose or defend
publicly. I think the casting of
aspersions upon my character by
the intimation of the existence of
'hidden facts' comprises a wrong
that is not justified even by the
demands of bureaucratic effi
ciency.
—STEVEN MARX
Editor, The Daily:
One of the most frequent ques
tions asked about Peace Corps
service concerns the attitude of
the people whom the Peace Corps
Volunteer is attempting to help.
Much emphasis has been placed
upon the traditional apathy and
general lack of concern for prog
ress encountered among villagers
by the PC community develop
ment worker. It should be clari
fied that there are many people
in these villages who do want
to help themselves. It is through
these concerned individuals that
the PCV works to generate inter
est in specific projects and gen
eral progress. If there is apathy,
he is no more frustrated than
they are.
In most cases, the villagers want
progress, but under their own
terms, and the PCV has had to
evaluate and adapt his own
standards. In general, he has en
countred a willingness to work
for progress I hat is often surpris
ing, but always gratifying. True,
the specific goals and projects de
sired by the villagers might not
be those which he might have
conceived as best for them, but
it is his responsibility to adjust.
It is here that the much publi

cized psychological difficulties
lie, not in resigning himself to
any inertia of the people, but in
adapting his ideas of progress to
theirs.
It should be emphasized that
PCV's have generally encount
ered their real stumbling blocks
not in promoting local interest
and active participation in a
project, but at the government
levels (both host country and US)
when they have approached these
entities for material support for
the project. Despite inertia on
these levels, the Peace Corps is

One of the most frequent ques
tions asked about Peace Corps
service concerns the attitude of
the people whom the Peace Corps
Volunteer is attempting to help.
Much emphasis has been placed
upon the traditional apathy and
general lack of concern for prog
ress encountered among villagers
by the PC community develop
ment worker. It should be clari
fied that there are many people
in these villages who do want
to help themselves. It is through
these concerned individuals that
the PCV works to generate inter
est in specific projects and gen
eral progress. If there is apathy,
he is no more frustrated than
they are.
In most cases, the villagers want
progress, but under their own
terms, and the PCV has had to
evaluate and adapt his own
standards. In general, he has en
countred a willingness to work
for progress I hat is often surpris
ing, but always gratifying. True,
the specific goals and projects de
sired by the villagers might not
be those which he might have
conceived as best for them, but
it is his responsibility to adjust.
It is here that the much publi

cized psychological difficulties
lie, not in resigning himself to
any inertia of the people, but in
adapting his ideas of progress to
theirs.
It should be emphasized that
PCV's have generally encount
ered their real stumbling blocks
not in promoting local interest
and active participation in a
project, but at the government
levels (both host country and US)
when they have approached these
entities for material support for
the project. Despite inertia on
these levels, the Peace Corps is
slowly convincing host counlry
government agencies and US Aid
officials of the benefits derived
from villages participating in
self-help projects, chosen and
executed by the villagers them
selves, for their own development.
The human resources are avail
able and wailing, some of them
impatiently; the government and
development agencies must step
down to meet them.

Several problems regarding
teaching assistants in the sciences
could be alleviated if the depart

principles in selecting TA's and
administering the TA program.
1 > Selection of TA's for a
course should be made with con
sideration given to the capabili

qualified. A TA should not be
required to teach a course for
which he has no background.
Granted that the TA experience
is meant to broaden the TA's hori
zons, it is still unfair to the stu
dents if their TA lacks experience.
2) After selection, first year
TA's should be given some basic
"dos" and "don'ts" of lecturing
as well as pointers on leading dis

demonstrations. This TA instruc
tion should be given by a senior
faculty member who is known
for his teaching abilities and by

3) The instructor should make
very clear to the TA's what he

to that the TA will be able to sup

be required to attend lectures and

PEACE CORPS
Editor, The Daily:
Since my last letter to The
Daily evoked such an immediate
response from the Peace Corps,
and since letters sent to Wash
ington have either been ignored
or left unanswered for several
weeks, I hope that the dialogue
can be continued in this manner.
Mr. Woodard says that 'on
October 9 the Director of Selec
tion (Dr. S. J. Kaplan) advised
(me) that the decision of the
Board had been sustained and was
final.' I didn't receive Dr. Kap
lan's letter, which is quoted at
length by Mr. Woodard, until the
day after I had written to the
Daily - October 17. Although
dated October 9, it was post
marked on the 16. The questions
which I posed to Dr. Kaplan in
my appeal were no further clari
fied by what he said in response:
'The determinant for selection is
the composite of opinions and ob
servations and grades provided
by all who have been asked to
evaluate the candidate.'
In my reply to Dr. Kaplan, I
asked that if this were the deter
minant, then how did he explain
the Oberlin faculty protest of the
decision. And how did the peti
tion of my fellow trainees 'con
tribute' to his sustaining of t he
Board's action? All that ho ac
tually said was that 'there was
other material, however, suggest
ing that your personality might
possibly be one that would better
succeed in a capacity other than
that of a Peace Corps volunteer
(sic).'
Mr. Shriver's statement to the
House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee, reported in the New York
Times of October 16. 1963. is
somewhat less noncommital but
contains no more information:
'We recently selected out of train
ing a magna cum laude, Phi Beta
Kappa graduate of one of o u r
leading universities; he did not
have the personality to match his
intelligence. The best efforts of
his supporters, which included
some very distinguished names,
failed to convince our selecting
officers otherwise.'

PEACE CORPS
Editor, The Daily:
Since my last letter to The
Daily evoked such an immediate
response from the Peace Corps,
and since letters sent to Wash
ington have either been ignored
or left unanswered for several
weeks, I hope that the dialogue
can be continued in this manner.
Mr. Woodard says that 'on
October 9 the Director of Selec
tion (Dr. S. J. Kaplan) advised
(me) that the decision of the
Board had been sustained and was
final.' I didn't receive Dr. Kap
lan's letter, which is quoted at
length by Mr. Woodard, until the
day after I had written to the
Daily - October 17. Although
dated October 9, it was post
marked on the 16. The questions
which I posed to Dr. Kaplan in
my appeal were no further clari
fied by what he said in response:
'The determinant for selection is
the composite of opinions and ob
servations and grades provided
by all who have been asked to
evaluate the candidate.'
In my reply to Dr. Kaplan, I
asked that if this were the deter
minant, then how did he explain
the Oberlin faculty protest of the
decision. And how did the peti
tion of my fellow trainees 'con
tribute' to his sustaining of t he
Board's action? All that ho ac
tually said was that 'there was
other material, however, suggest
ing that your personality might
possibly be one that would better
succeed in a capacity other than
that of a Peace Corps volunteer
(sic).'
Mr. Shriver's statement to the
House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee, reported in the New York
Times of October 16. 1963. is
somewhat less noncommital but
contains no more information:
'We recently selected out of train
ing a magna cum laude, Phi Beta
Kappa graduate of one of o u r
leading universities; he did not
have the personality to match his
intelligence. The best efforts of
his supporters, which included
some very distinguished names,
failed to convince our selecting
officers otherwise.'
If 'personality' is to be graded

challenge Dr. Kaplan, Mr. Wood

such material exists. I don't think
there is anything in my past
which could possibly be relevant
to this decision that I would not
be willing to disclose or defend

Editor, The Daily:
One of the most frequent ques
tions asked about Peace Corps
service concerns the attitude of
the people whom the Peace Corps
Volunteer is attempting to help.
Much emphasis has been placed
upon the traditional apathy and
general lack of concern for prog
ress encountered among villagers
by the PC community develop
ment worker. It should be clari
fied that there are many people
in these villages who do want
to help themselves. It is through
these concerned individuals that
the PCV works to generate inter
est in specific projects and gen
eral progress. If there is apathy,
he is no more frustrated than
they are.
In most cases, the villagers want
progress, but under their own
terms, and the PCV has had to
evaluate and adapt his own
standards. In general, he has en
countred a willingness to work
for progress I hat is often surpris
ing, but always gratifying. True,
the specific goals and projects de
sired by the villagers might not
be those which he might have
conceived as best for them, but
it is his responsibility to adjust.
It is here that the much publi

cized psychological difficulties
lie, not in resigning himself to
any inertia of the people, but in
adapting his ideas of progress to
theirs.
It should be emphasized that
PCV's have generally encount
ered their real stumbling blocks
not in promoting local interest
and active participation in a
project, but at the government
levels (both host country and US)
when they have approached these
entities for material support for
the project. Despite inertia on
these levels, the Peace Corps is
slowly convincing host counlry
government agencies and US Aid
officials of the benefits derived
from villages participating in
self-help projects, chosen and
executed by the villagers them
selves, for their own development.
The human resources are avail
able and wailing, some of them
impatiently; the government and
development agencies must step
down to meet them.

Several problems regarding

1 > Selection of TA's for a

Granted that the TA experience

REPLY TO MR. CALM A
Editor, The Daily:
The second (of an undoubtedly
unparalleled series) letter from
Jacques Calma appeared in the
Daily October 12. Some amusing
j background might be of interest
| to you. Jacques has been wres
; tling with this Great Concern for
at least six months (that I know
:of and quite possibly for even
longer that that). He was finally
I invited to be the guest of th e
| AVVS Social Regulations Commit
! tee for dinner and a long meet
ing afterwards last spring quar
ter so that he could pursue dis
cussion of his confusion as to the
! Intent of the social regulations
and his Concern for Sexual Free
dom. The hope of the committee,
in fulfilling its obligation to talk
with Mr Calma, was that Jacques
' would at least be less confused
after some discussion. Unfortun
ately, Jacques is still confused.
I find it extremely interesting
to note that Mr. Calma seems
upset about the Intent and Impli
-1 cation of the Women's Social
Regulations than are Stanford
women themselves. He seems rle
-1 termined to incite a Sexual Revo
| lut ion on the Stanford campus,
but he doesn't seem to he getting
| much response from the women
i whose Freedom he is trying to
protect. Isn't that strange . . .
Nonetheless, I would like to
' take issue with several points
raised by Mr. Calma in his letters
; to the Daily:
1> Please define "conventional,
I off-campus morality," distinguish
!it from "on-campus morality"
! (my quotes I, justify and docu
j ment so-called administrative dis
; tinction between the two, and
I then, if you can, justify statement
{ that the "administrative purpose
in sanctioning and enforcing Fun
j stan is to placate exponents of off-
I campus morality." Before doing
: any of this, re-read the "Funstan"
in both its original and recently
revised forms.
21 Justify your broad and un
substantiated generalization to
j the effect that student and Ad
; ministration interests are essen
| tially contrary.
3> Please tell me "what is"
| I'm dying to know.
; 4) Your correlation between "a
! girl's own sexual taboos" and the
meaning of the word "standards"
is abstruse, at best. If it's the
product of Brilliant Insight, prove
it.
5) The last two paragraphs of
your letter, in which you tell us
what the Social Regulations mean
and explain the intentions,
| thought, and past and present ac
tion of the Administration, are
not only highly presumptuous but
also, to my knowledge, are totally
false. Please substantiate.
6) Last but not least, let's give
credit and blame where both are
due. I refer to repetition of "The
Dean and Assistant Dean of Wom
en . . in your first letter. Stu
. dents are responsible for the AWS
j Social Regulations.

I invited to be the guest of th e
| AVVS Social Regulations Commit
! tee for dinner and a long meet
ing afterwards last spring quar
ter so that he could pursue dis
cussion of his confusion as to the
! Intent of the social regulations
and his Concern for Sexual Free
dom. The hope of the committee,
in fulfilling its obligation to talk
with Mr Calma, was that Jacques
' would at least be less confused
after some discussion. Unfortun
ately, Jacques is still confused.
I find it extremely interesting
to note that Mr. Calma seems
upset about the Intent and Impli
-1 cation of the Women's Social
Regulations than are Stanford
women themselves. He seems rle
-1 termined to incite a Sexual Revo
| lut ion on the Stanford campus,
but he doesn't seem to he getting
| much response from the women
i whose Freedom he is trying to
protect. Isn't that strange . . .
Nonetheless, I would like to
' take issue with several points
raised by Mr. Calma in his letters
; to the Daily:
1> Please define "conventional,
I off-campus morality," distinguish
!it from "on-campus morality"
! (my quotes I, justify and docu
j ment so-called administrative dis
; tinction between the two, and
I then, if you can, justify statement
{ that the "administrative purpose
in sanctioning and enforcing Fun
j stan is to placate exponents of off-
I campus morality." Before doing
: any of this, re-read the "Funstan"
in both its original and recently
revised forms.
21 Justify your broad and un
substantiated generalization to
j the effect that student and Ad
; ministration interests are essen
| tially contrary.
3> Please tell me "what is"
| I'm dying to know.
; 4) Your correlation between "a
! girl's own sexual taboos" and the
meaning of the word "standards"
is abstruse, at best. If it's the
product of Brilliant Insight, prove
it.
5) The last two paragraphs of
your letter, in which you tell us
what the Social Regulations mean
and explain the intentions,
| thought, and past and present ac
tion of the Administration, are
not only highly presumptuous but
also, to my knowledge, are totally
false. Please substantiate.
6) Last but not least, let's give
credit and blame where both are
due. I refer to repetition of "The
Dean and Assistant Dean of Wom
en . . in your first letter. Stu
. dents are responsible for the AWS
j Social Regulations.
