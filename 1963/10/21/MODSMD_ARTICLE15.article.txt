The Stanford varsity water!
polo toam ran its season win
streak to ton games by beating
UCLA 13-6 and Cerritos Junior
College 14-2 on Saturday. On Fri
day they beal University of the
Pacific at Stockton, .11-4.
Saturday morning's game pit tori
the Indians against a smart, alert |
Bruin team. The game was es
pecially important to the Indians j
as UCLA had just suffered an 8-5
defeat at the hands of USC, the!
defending national champions.
The Bruins tried to cut down :
the Stanford scoring attack (20:
goal average) by collapsing in
front of the nets on defense, and .
to jolt the Card defense with an !
excellent passing attack. They
hoped to keep the Indians from
using their potent "fast break"
which is highly dependent on de
fensive position.
Tin: STRATEGY was ineffec
tive as Hull and Lorton each
scored from the corner in the first
period as the Indians ran up a
3-0 lead.
UCLA broke the ice in the sec
ond period when All-American
Mike Ashley scored for the
Bruins. Don Buehlor, who is the j
top defensive man on the Stan-1
ford team, held Ashley under
check for one and a half quarters. :
Unfortunately he gathered six j
fouls doing it. It takes four fouls
to foul out hut the aggressive
Beuhler picked up two more be
fore he could be persuaded to j
leave the pool.
Hull scored six goals in eight !
attempts. The other scorers for!
Stanford were Fete Pettigrew,
Bill Ready, and Mike Eshleman :
with two goals, and Lorton and
Ron Kovas with one. The Indians
were 13-32 which is a solid 40.7'r.
(-ERKITOS Junior College off
ered no competition for the Cards. |
Although starters Pettigrew a n d !
Hull did the bulk of the scoring !
with five and four goals apiece, ;
the reserves played most of the |
game.
