# Alabama Modifies News Restriction
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY. Ala. <CPS)
The University of Alabama has
significantly modied the oalh re
stricting all students from writ
ing for news media on matters ex
pressly concerning race relations.
Restrictions are only in force pro
hibiting students from writing
about Negro students in the cam
pus or about applicants to the
University.
This action was taken at t he
end of Stpember, but official an
nouncement came only last week.
Also added to the pledge was
the phrase, "No prohibitions 011
writing herein contained apply to
the Crimson-White, the Univer
sity newspaper. This was simply
by way of clarification. The stu
dent paper had never refrained
from printing racial news.
A University spokesman said
I lie change was made because
"the greatest period of danger for
the University is past. . . . "We
adopted emergency measures be
cause we felt we were in an em
ergency."
"We didn't want the phrase
"tacit approval of racial violence'
attached to us as it was the ad
ministration of the University of
Mississippi. We were determined
to act in whatever ways we
thought necessary to forestall the
eruption of an explosive atmos
phere on our campus," he said.
Mel Meyer, editor of the Crim
son-White during the 1962-63 year
who was named "student editor
of the year" has interpreted the
change to mean that he will also
be able to resume his duties as
Southern Bureau Chief of the
Collegiate Press Service.
