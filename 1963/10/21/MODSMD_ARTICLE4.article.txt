"WHITE FENCES"' BY JAMES R. STANFORD, APSA, is one of the many photographs in "Photography
in the Fine Arts, Exhibit III" which is on display in Tresidder Memorial Union through Nov. 8. One
hundred forty-one photos, the best in international camera technique, will be on display throughout
the Union. The prints represent the work of more than 100 photographers selected by the 10-man
PFA National Jury from 877 entries. These photographs, deemed worthy of a place on the gallery
walls of a museum, answer the criticism of earlier PFA exhibits, which asked in the form of edit
orial headlines: But Is It Art?" They show that the quest for artistic truth—the capture of the time
less even in the purely topical—is the same for all artists whether they use paint or marble or film
as a medium.
