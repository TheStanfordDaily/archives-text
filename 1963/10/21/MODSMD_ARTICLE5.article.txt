# DIEBENKORN
## Painter Residing Here Gets Critical Acclaim 
### RALPH PEER 
Richard Diebenkorn, a young
and distinguished Bay Area artist,
is maintaining his studio on cam
pus for this academic year as part
of the Stanford Art Department's
new artist-in-residence program.
Two days a week the studio is
open so that students may come
in and discuss whatever they wish
with the artist.
THE PROGRAM, made possible
through private funds, was con
ceived last year. Although Mr.
Diebenkorn is still unsure as to
what his position entails, he feels
that students are taking advan
tage of the program. Only time
will tell whether his suggestions
are having any effect, says Die
benkorn.
Next spring, Mr. Diebenkorn,
will mark the end of his stay here
with a one-man show. The art
department hopes that this ex
hibit will be a comprehensive
showing of representative works
over the years, including those
he may paint while at Stanford.
Though no artist has been se
lected for nexl year, the art de
partment is very pleased with the
program and hopes to continue it.
In the future artists-in-residence
will include prominent sculptors
and probably photographers and
architects.
|{ I < II A R 1) IMIOBENKORN
started his career as an artist in
the early 1940's while lie was a
student at Stanford. His first
paintings were relatively repre
sentational. but during the Sec
ond World War he tended in
creasingly towards the abstract.

Slowly, however, he started using
more landscape references. These
paintings showed a sense of the
wide open spaces of the West,
achieved by the use of thin, ten
tative, pointed rectangles of color
that lent the essence of fields,
water and sky.
In Diebenkorn's most recent
work this aura of the West still
persists, but the artist has begun
using figures as part of his move
ment away from abstractionism.
Many of his latest paintings con
tain a figure, usually a woman,
sitting or standing in perfect har
mony with the surroundings.
Some critics contend that Die
benkorn's use of figures in this
era of abstractionism represent
"a genuinely new kind of human
ism." Mr. Diebenkorn, however,
insists that he includes figures
only for artistic purpose.
Critics have acclaimed Dieben
korn as the leader of the San
Francisco School. Though he him
self defines the school as "a
lumping together" for which the
critics are responsible, Dieben
korn's reputation as the pace
setter for this prominent Califor
nia group strengthens his position
as an important artist.
The art department hopes that
its artist -in - residence program
will allow students to get a
glimpse of the concept of crea
tion. Although it is easy to see a
finished painting and discuss it
in texts, it is impossible to discuss
the creation of that painting in
words. The artist-in-residence pro
gram provides a certain insight
of which textbooks are incapable.
