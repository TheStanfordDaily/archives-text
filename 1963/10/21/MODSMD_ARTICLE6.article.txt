There are no requirements for

ferred. Entries should be sent, ac
companied by a stamped, self
addressed envelope, to SEQUOIA,
Box 2167, Stanford. 'Hie deadline
is November 29.
Sequoia will hold its first gen

The meeting begins at 4:30.
Members of the Editorial Board

more about it, or who has a
question about the contest, is in
viled to come.
"This year, we want to publish
magazines full of writings by
Stanford students." said Sharon
Cobb, Sequoia's editor-in-chief.
"We want to stay as far away as
possible from printing slim, ele
gant little volumes which contain
too few contributions from Stan
ford undergraduates and gradu
ates, and which do not, therefore,
widely sell. We hope to produce
some big, fat, representative
issues — yet which do not ignore
quality. In order to do this we
need, of course, to receive a wide
selection of manuscripts. The
Autumn issue, which will be out
in a few weeks, contains many
poems and photographs received
from Stanford students in the
contests held last spring. We hope
the same thing will happen this
quarter with fiction."

gant little volumes which contain
too few contributions from Stan
ford undergraduates and gradu
ates, and which do not, therefore,
widely sell. We hope to produce
some big, fat, representative
issues — yet which do not ignore
quality. In order to do this we
need, of course, to receive a wide
selection of manuscripts. The
Autumn issue, which will be out
in a few weeks, contains many
poems and photographs received
from Stanford students in the
contests held last spring. We hope
the same thing will happen this
quarter with fiction."
