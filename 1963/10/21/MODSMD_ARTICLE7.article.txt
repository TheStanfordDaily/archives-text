S< RAM ON WOULD ACCEPT GOP DRAFT — WASHINGTON
Gov. William W. Seranton of Pennsylvania said Sunday he would
accept an "honest and sincere" draft for the 1961 Republican presi
dential nomination. He said the same went for the vice presidential
nomination.
In a wide-ranging discussion of political issues on ABC's Issues
and Answers, the governor also endorsed the idea of debates between
GOP presidential candidates and spoke out strongly in support of a
public accommodations provision in any new civil rights law.
Seranton, who declared early this year that President Kennedy
could not be beaten in 1964, said he had changed his mind consider
ably since then. He said the civil rights controversy, foreign policy,
economic issues and handling of the recent railroad labor dispute had
cost the President popular support.

S< RAM ON WOULD ACCEPT GOP DRAFT — WASHINGTON

accept an "honest and sincere" draft for the 1961 Republican presi
dential nomination. He said the same went for the vice presidential
nomination.

and Answers, the governor also endorsed the idea of debates between
GOP presidential candidates and spoke out strongly in support of a
public accommodations provision in any new civil rights law.
Seranton, who declared early this year that President Kennedy
could not be beaten in 1964, said he had changed his mind consider
ably since then. He said the civil rights controversy, foreign policy,
economic issues and handling of the recent railroad labor dispute had
cost the President popular support.
