# Frats Losing Style and Members; Many Factors Killing Greek System

### JANE DUDERSTADT 
"There are indications that the sorority and
fraternity system al the Bay area's major univer
sities may pass out of existence for the ironical
reason that the Greek letter institutions have re
fined themselves into high scholarship, no non
sense houses."
THI'S BEGAN Bill Hall's article in the San
Francisco Examiner. Sundays. Oct. 13, 1963, in
which Hall tried to find out "What's Killing the
Fraternities and Sororities."
Basing his conclusions on evidence taken from
lIC at Berkeley, l*C at Sant Cruz, and Stanford.
Hall charged that one of the reasons for the fra
ternities' decline was their loss of uniqueness. No
longer is the fraternity man necessarily the "guy
with a convertible and fancy clothes." No longer
are fraternties and sororities the center of the
"rah-rah crowd, snobs, bigots, and producers of
perennial sophomores," says Hall. Indeed, quite
the contrary imply figures from the National In
terfraternity Conference, which show that fifty
per cent ot all fraternity men are above the over
all average of their campuses and the rate of drop
out is half as high among fraternity men as among
non-fraternity men.
The loss of the Greeks' "image." however, is
accomnanied bv a decline in Greek membership.

The approach taken now toward Greek organiza
tions is similar to that which one takes toward
any living group, maintains Hall. And, he con
tinues. "the competition from other housing is
strong." Many fraternities take in boarders when
their membership can't reach the fill-in quota.
"Soon there won't be much to choose from among
a fraternity, residence hall, co-op or rooming
house."
THE ATTITUDE of the student body toward
Greek organizations is changing also to seem
ing indifference. According to Hall, this spirit
can be seen in the fact that Stanford's and Cal's,
student body presidents are both non-fraternity
men. He cites the editor of the Daily California!),
who places the beginning of the decline during the
war years when the veterans came on campus
and "had no time for such frills."
ANOTHER FACTOR adding to Ihe Greek de
cline is the pressure put on fraternities by the uni
versities, charges Hall. A recent case of this pres
sure is the controversial discrimination policy the
Regents have passed requiring that no one be re
jected for membership because of race, color, or
creed.
Thus, Hall declares that indifference toward the
Greeks, their loss of prestige, the competition of
other housing, and policy pressures are seriously
threatenin" the Greek svstem.
