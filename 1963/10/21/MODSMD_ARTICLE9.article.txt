# Legion Lacks Information; No Commie Hunt at Minn. U.
## 
### 
The national American Legion will not take immediate action on
resolution calling for investigation of the Student Peace Union and
the World Affairs Center, according to a Minnesota Daily article
last week.
I he article quoted Daniel O'Connor, chairman of the commission,

as saying the already full
would not permit consideration of
the resolution in the remaining
lime. The resolution, which called
for investigation of the two Uni- :
versity organizations to deter-!
mine if they are Communist in
filtrated, originated at the Minne- i
sola State Legion convention last
July.
O'Connor said that such a reso
lution needs careful research and
stud}'. The commission's perman
ent research staff will study the j
problem and report back, prob- i
ably no sooner than next spring
at the commission's next regular
meeting.
Ed Ryan, chairman of the Min
nesota Legion Americanism com
mittee and of the anti-subversive
committee, eited the Legion's ;
1934 counter-subversive manual
instructing individual Legion- |
naires to contact the national

counter - subversive committee,
"when you believe subversive ac
tivity exists." He also cited the
August, 1963 issue of the Firing
Line, the commission's official
publication. "The weapon of ex
posure is one which must be used
with a great deal of wisdom. The
first step is to get the correct
facts," it instructs Legionnaires.
Ryan brought a folder of in
formation with him, including a
tape of the McDonald testimony,
which he turned over to O'Con
nor.
"Frankly, we made no attempt
to evaluate any of this evidence,"
Rayan said. His committee, he
explained, never did any investi
gating or evaluating because this
is rightfully the duty of the na
tional commission, in his estima
tion.
John Balentine, Minnesota Le
gion chaplain, told the commis
sion after Ryan's presentation,
"An investigation has already
been done at the University of
Minnesota which showed there
are 'socialists at the University
more revolutionary than the most,
militant Krushchev Commu
nists.' " He did not have the docu
ment with him and did not know
when the study was done.
O'Connor did not say whether
he had favored an investigation
at the University, but he did com
ment on investigations in general.
"My thinking and feeling has
been: let them investigate. If
there is nothing to fear, why
oppose an investigation?
