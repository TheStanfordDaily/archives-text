Jung Was Worried About the Future, Too
"II it (Protestantism) keeps on disintegrating as a church, it succeds in depriving
man of all liis spiritual safeguards and means of defense against the immediate ex
perience of the forces waiting for liberation in the unconscious mind. Look at all
the incredible savagery going on in our so-called civilized world, all of which is
derived from human beings and their mental condition! Look at the devilish means
<»112, destruction! Thc\ we invented by perfectly harmless gentlemen, reasonable, re
spectable citizens, being all we hope to be. And when the whole thing blows up and
causes an indescribable inferno of devastation, nobody seems to be responsible . . .
As nobody is capable of recognizing where and how he himself is possessed and un
conscious, one simply projects one's own condition upon the neighbor." (CarJ Jung,
I'ttucholony (iiul Religion, 1938).
Jung himself never became a Christian. Like so many highly educated men, he felt
God could be explained away. He attributed the religious symbols which he found
in the dreams of bis patients to the "collective unconscious." However, Jung was
certainly aware of the forces of evil in the world. Perhaps you've sensed them, too.
The spiritually regenerated Christian knows all too well that he lives in a dying
world. He is personally aware of powerful evil forces at work in addition to the
great light of Christ which he has received. If you are worried about the world, as
Jung was, there is good news. You can have the inner peace and joy ol salvation,
and then proceed actively to do something about it by joining in the warfare between
good and evil going on all around us.
"Put on all the armour which God provides, so that you may be able to stand firm
against the devices of the evil. For our fight is not against human foes, but against
cosmic powers, against the authorities and potentates of this dark world, against the
superhuman forces of evil in the heavens. Therefore, take up God's armour; then
you will be able to stand your ground when things are at their worst, to complete
every task and still to stand. Stand firm, 1 say. Huckle on the belt of truth, tor coat
of mail put on integrity; let the shoes on your feet be the gospel of peace, to give
you firm footing; and with all these, take up the great shield of faith, with which
you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take salvation
for helmet; for sword take that which the Sj>irit gives you—the words that come from
God." Eph. r>-10-17 NE.
