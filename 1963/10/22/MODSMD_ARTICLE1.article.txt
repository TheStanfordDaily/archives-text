# 'Campus Voice' Salesmen Ignore University Ruling
## 
### JANE DUDERSTADT 
An estimated 300 copies of this issue of the "Campus Voice" were j
illegally sold yesterday on Engineering Corner and in front of Tie-1
sidder Union as staffers again defied Stanford policy.
The sale was not impeded except for a short visit from a univer- j
sity official and a police commissioner who reminded the distributors j

that they were trespassing.
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler confirmed that the
staffers were asked to leave and
did not comply. Winbigler de
clined to comment further, al
though ho indicated comment
might be forthcoming.
NO DIRECT ACTION was tak
en against the salesmen, and they
later stated that the magazine
would be sold again today at Engi
neering Corner and in front of
Tresidder.
The "Voice," a student protest
paper published in San Jose, was
barred from open sales at Stan
ford on September 1 26. It is per
mitted to be sold in the Tresid
der Store, however.
The varied reception of the
"Campus Voice" at different
schools in the Bay Area was re
ported in yesterday's issue of the
magazine.
THE "VOICE" stated that it
also met opposition at San Jose
State when it began to sell copies
on September 30. A campus se
curity officer ordered "Voice"
salesmen to leave campus.
In a telephone conversation
with the Daily, President Wahl
quist of SJS denied that the uni
versity took any stand against
the "Campus Voice."
lie stated that the "Voice" is
now being sold on 7th street, a
public thoroughfare through cam
pus which has recently been
closed to traffic to allow for cam
pus unification.
ACCORDING TO Wahlquist,
the "Voice's" distribution was
stopped by the Chief of Police
because the distributors did not
have a vendor's license. The uni
versity has never made an effort
to stop its sale.
Giving his reaction to the Cam
pus Voice, Wahlquist commented,
"I have examined the last two
issues, and have found nothing
objectionable."
The October 21 issue of the
Voice also referred to a conversa

tion between Stanford's President
Wallace Sterling and President
Dodd of San Francisco State in
which Dodd reportedly said " 'The
Campus Voice' is enjoyable read
ing." Dodd's assistant was un
aware of this conversation when
interviewed yesterday. Frederick
Glover, executive assistant to
President Sterling, stated to the
Daily that this alleged conversa
tion did not take place. Dodd was
not sure "whether the 'Campus
Voice' was being sold or not."
The "Voice" also cited an open
letter from Thomas Ramsay, stu
dent body president at San Fran
cisco State, to Bud Wedin, Stan
ford's student body president, in
regard to the banning of the
"Voice" from open sale at Stan
lord. Ramsey expressed his "con
dolences" for "this unfortunate
interference with the basic right
of your students to avail them
selves of any information which
attempts to reflect or comment
on the life of the university com
munity."
