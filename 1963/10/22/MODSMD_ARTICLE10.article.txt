# IFB Places Zeta Psi On Probation for Year
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
The Interfraternity Board has
placed the Zeta Psi Fraternity on
"General Probation" for the en
tire 1963-64 school year. The
Board, which is chaired by Inter-
Fraternity Council Chairman Don
Haider and consists of student,
faculty, and administration mem
bers, was prompted to action by
a series of incidents inv olving the
Zete House.
The first incident was the
| breaking of a window in Florence
i Moore Hall last April 20, and the
I last which brought about imme
diate action- was damage to the
I Alpha Kappa Lambda House and
injury of an AKL active. The
AKL incident took place on Sep
-1 tember 20 of this quarter. Dam
| age to the AKL house involved
| broken furniture, tiles torn up,
a broken guitar, and weights
dropped from the second floor.
One student received a blow re
sulting in damage to his teeth.
THE BOAltl) took action on
October 9, and last Monday a
: letter was sent to all fraternity
house presidents informing them
of the status of the Zete House.
The letter was signed by Haider
and Director of Fraternities
Robert Summers.
Five specific actions were
taken. One was, according to the
letter, "Complete monetary resti
i tution will be made to the Alpha
1 Kappa Lambda fraternity for all
; material damage . . . and for the
| total medical expenses incurred
1... as a result of injuries sus
| tained in the September 20 in
cident."
The other four points were
specific listing of what "general
probation" will entail. The house
j must "prove to the satisfaction of
'the interfraternity board that it
is capable of governing its own
members and operation." The
IFB letter cited the governmental
structure by which this is to be
, accomplished. Secondly, a liaison
i committee of a Zeta Psi member
! from each class in school and the
' house president will report to
each IFB meeting on progress in
! the fraternity.
The letter also stated, "This
! special committee will be called
upon to prove to the satisfaction

of IFB that Zeta Psi is positively
contributing to the intellectual,
social, and personal advancement
of its members."
APPARENTLY, the AKL in
cident was the work of members
of the pledge class. The fourth
point under the "General Proba
tion" statement is that the spe
cial committee will "be called
upon to show evidence to the IFB
that punishment was imparted by
the house leadership to the pledge
class, and specifically to the four
members of the class who were
admittedly involved in the AKL
incident."
The IFB stressed that the Zete
house was nearly placed in a
"Receivership Plan" wherein Zete
alumni would have been "called
in to manage the complete affairs
of the fraternity for the entire
school year."
In reference to the action, Dean
of Men Robert Gordon com
mented, "It is not the incident,
but how we respond that is most
important. I don't want to see
any fraternity leave the campus
until such time as we have done
everything we could to help them
constructively."
Inter-Fraternity Board Member
James Wat kins, professor of
political science, stated to the
Daily, "The pattern has been set;
if it comes to the point of throw
ing a fraternity off campus, we
would put them into a receiver
ship. . . ."
GORDON, in his statement to

the Daily, added, "This is a test
issue: are we going to be able
(o put teeth in the concept of self
government?" He noted, "1 was
very pleased to learn that the
fraternities and fraternity men in
general do not condone this type
of activity."
According to the IFB by-laws,
the Dean of Men is a voting mem
ber of the Board. Gordon, how
ever, felt that since the Board is
an advisory group to the Presi
dent and its recommendations
pass across the Dean of Men's
desk, it was illogical for him to
be a voting member of the body.
The Dean asked to be removed as
a voting member of the budy;
his request was granted.
Zete President Charlie Bonner
stated to the Daily, "We have ac
cepted responsibilty for the in
cident and have acted upon it ac
cordingly. We have instituted
positive programs for the future
which we feel are to the satisfac
tion of the active members, the
alumni, and the administration."
Watkins stressed that firm self
government at a living group
level is the best way "for all liv
ing groups to encourage respon
sible conduct. One can't teach
good judgment without allowing
I>eople to make judgments." In
this light. Watkins saw the phil
osophy behind the action taken
against the Zetes as one that "ap
plies to Florence Moore, Stern,
everywhere—this is not just a
fraternity problem."

' house president will report to

The letter also stated, "This
! special committee will be called
upon to prove to the satisfaction

of IFB that Zeta Psi is positively
contributing to the intellectual,
social, and personal advancement
of its members."
APPARENTLY, the AKL in
cident was the work of members
of the pledge class. The fourth
point under the "General Proba
tion" statement is that the spe
cial committee will "be called
upon to show evidence to the IFB
that punishment was imparted by
the house leadership to the pledge
class, and specifically to the four
members of the class who were
admittedly involved in the AKL
incident."
The IFB stressed that the Zete
house was nearly placed in a
"Receivership Plan" wherein Zete
alumni would have been "called
in to manage the complete affairs
of the fraternity for the entire
school year."
In reference to the action, Dean
of Men Robert Gordon com
mented, "It is not the incident,
but how we respond that is most
important. I don't want to see
any fraternity leave the campus
until such time as we have done
everything we could to help them
constructively."
Inter-Fraternity Board Member
James Wat kins, professor of
political science, stated to the
Daily, "The pattern has been set;
if it comes to the point of throw
ing a fraternity off campus, we
would put them into a receiver
ship. . . ."
GORDON, in his statement to

the Daily, added, "This is a test
issue: are we going to be able
(o put teeth in the concept of self
government?" He noted, "1 was
very pleased to learn that the
fraternities and fraternity men in
general do not condone this type
of activity."
According to the IFB by-laws,
the Dean of Men is a voting mem
ber of the Board. Gordon, how
ever, felt that since the Board is
an advisory group to the Presi
dent and its recommendations
pass across the Dean of Men's
desk, it was illogical for him to
be a voting member of the body.
The Dean asked to be removed as
a voting member of the budy;
his request was granted.
Zete President Charlie Bonner
stated to the Daily, "We have ac
cepted responsibilty for the in
cident and have acted upon it ac
cordingly. We have instituted
positive programs for the future
which we feel are to the satisfac
tion of the active members, the
alumni, and the administration."
Watkins stressed that firm self
government at a living group
level is the best way "for all liv
ing groups to encourage respon
sible conduct. One can't teach
good judgment without allowing
I>eople to make judgments." In
this light. Watkins saw the phil
osophy behind the action taken
against the Zetes as one that "ap
plies to Florence Moore, Stern,
everywhere—this is not just a
fraternity problem."
The Interfraternity Board has
placed the Zeta Psi Fraternity on
"General Probation" for the en
tire 1963-64 school year. The
Board, which is chaired by Inter-
Fraternity Council Chairman Don
Haider and consists of student,
faculty, and administration mem
bers, was prompted to action by
a series of incidents inv olving the
Zete House.
The first incident was the
| breaking of a window in Florence
i Moore Hall last April 20, and the
I last which brought about imme
diate action- was damage to the
I Alpha Kappa Lambda House and
injury of an AKL active. The
AKL incident took place on Sep
-1 tember 20 of this quarter. Dam
| age to the AKL house involved
| broken furniture, tiles torn up,
a broken guitar, and weights
dropped from the second floor.
One student received a blow re
sulting in damage to his teeth.
THE BOAltl) took action on
October 9, and last Monday a
: letter was sent to all fraternity
house presidents informing them
of the status of the Zete House.
The letter was signed by Haider
and Director of Fraternities
Robert Summers.
Five specific actions were
taken. One was, according to the
letter, "Complete monetary resti
i tution will be made to the Alpha
1 Kappa Lambda fraternity for all
; material damage . . . and for the
| total medical expenses incurred
1... as a result of injuries sus
| tained in the September 20 in
cident."
The other four points were
specific listing of what "general
probation" will entail. The house
j must "prove to the satisfaction of
'the interfraternity board that it
is capable of governing its own
members and operation." The
IFB letter cited the governmental
structure by which this is to be
, accomplished. Secondly, a liaison

ber of the Board. Gordon, how
ever, felt that since the Board is
an advisory group to the Presi
dent and its recommendations
pass across the Dean of Men's
desk, it was illogical for him to
be a voting member of the body.
The Dean asked to be removed as
a voting member of the budy;
his request was granted.
Zete President Charlie Bonner
stated to the Daily, "We have ac
cepted responsibilty for the in
cident and have acted upon it ac
cordingly. We have instituted
positive programs for the future
which we feel are to the satisfac
tion of the active members, the
alumni, and the administration."
Watkins stressed that firm self
government at a living group
level is the best way "for all liv
ing groups to encourage respon
sible conduct. One can't teach
good judgment without allowing
I>eople to make judgments." In
this light. Watkins saw the phil
osophy behind the action taken
against the Zetes as one that "ap
plies to Florence Moore, Stern,
everywhere—this is not just a
fraternity problem."
The Interfraternity Board has
placed the Zeta Psi Fraternity on
"General Probation" for the en
tire 1963-64 school year. The
Board, which is chaired by Inter-
Fraternity Council Chairman Don
Haider and consists of student,
faculty, and administration mem
bers, was prompted to action by
a series of incidents inv olving the
Zete House.
The first incident was the
| breaking of a window in Florence
i Moore Hall last April 20, and the
I last which brought about imme
diate action- was damage to the
I Alpha Kappa Lambda House and
injury of an AKL active. The
AKL incident took place on Sep
-1 tember 20 of this quarter. Dam
| age to the AKL house involved
| broken furniture, tiles torn up,
a broken guitar, and weights
dropped from the second floor.
One student received a blow re
sulting in damage to his teeth.
THE BOAltl) took action on
October 9, and last Monday a
: letter was sent to all fraternity
house presidents informing them
of the status of the Zete House.
The letter was signed by Haider
and Director of Fraternities
Robert Summers.
Five specific actions were
taken. One was, according to the
letter, "Complete monetary resti
i tution will be made to the Alpha
1 Kappa Lambda fraternity for all
; material damage . . . and for the
| total medical expenses incurred
1... as a result of injuries sus
| tained in the September 20 in
cident."
The other four points were
specific listing of what "general
probation" will entail. The house
j must "prove to the satisfaction of
'the interfraternity board that it
is capable of governing its own
members and operation." The
IFB letter cited the governmental
structure by which this is to be
, accomplished. Secondly, a liaison
i committee of a Zeta Psi member
! from each class in school and the
' house president will report to
each IFB meeting on progress in
! the fraternity.
The letter also stated, "This
! special committee will be called
upon to prove to the satisfaction

of IFB that Zeta Psi is positively
contributing to the intellectual,
social, and personal advancement
of its members."
APPARENTLY, the AKL in
cident was the work of members
of the pledge class. The fourth
point under the "General Proba
tion" statement is that the spe
cial committee will "be called
upon to show evidence to the IFB
that punishment was imparted by
the house leadership to the pledge
class, and specifically to the four
members of the class who were
admittedly involved in the AKL
incident."
The IFB stressed that the Zete
house was nearly placed in a
"Receivership Plan" wherein Zete
alumni would have been "called
in to manage the complete affairs
of the fraternity for the entire
school year."
In reference to the action, Dean
of Men Robert Gordon com
mented, "It is not the incident,
but how we respond that is most
important. I don't want to see
any fraternity leave the campus
until such time as we have done
everything we could to help them
constructively."
Inter-Fraternity Board Member
James Wat kins, professor of
political science, stated to the
Daily, "The pattern has been set;
if it comes to the point of throw
ing a fraternity off campus, we
would put them into a receiver
ship. . . ."
GORDON, in his statement to

the Daily, added, "This is a test
issue: are we going to be able
(o put teeth in the concept of self
government?" He noted, "1 was
very pleased to learn that the
fraternities and fraternity men in
general do not condone this type
of activity."
