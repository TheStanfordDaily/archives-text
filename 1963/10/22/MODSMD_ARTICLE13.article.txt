# IFB Chairman's Statement

### 
(Editor's Note: The following
is a statement from IFC Clialr
man Don Haider released to
the Daily yesterday concerning l
fraternity self-government.)
There arose in the fall of 19."59
due to a specific fraternity inci
dent which involved a tragic
death to a fraternity member, the
need for a special fraternity com
mittee to consider interfraternity
problems and policy. Such a com
mittee composed of students, fac
ulty. and administration members
came to be known as the Inter
fraternity Board or 1.F.8.
The Board whose powers are
derived from and subject to the
President of the University has
been involved in the role of self
government in two specific fra
ternities: Sigma Nu (Beta Chi
Local) in 1959-1960 and Phi Gam
ma Delta in 1901-1962. Both of
these houses became involved in
numerous incidents which indi
cated a complete abdication of self
discipline and responsibility.
THE KOAKI) is currently com
posed of 14 members, nine of
whom are students and five from
the faculty and administration.
The recent faculty appointments
include Prof. Ted Kreps of t he
Stanford Business School; Dean
Charles Park. Jr., Dean of th e
School of Mineral Sciences; Don
Carlson, Associate Director of
University Relations; and ex
ol'ficiary members Richard Lager
strum, Prof. Harry Rathbun, and
Director of Fraternities Robert
Sommers. These men join past
appointees Robert Moulton, Di
rector of SLAC, and Prof. James
T. Watkins IV, the official advisor
to the fraternities and originator
of the 1.F.8.
The 1.F.8. has recently seen
due cause under its authority to
consider interfraternity problems
and policy for taking action
against Zeta Psi fraternity. Fre
quent incidents by members of
this chapter have placed its stand
ing in the fraternity system in
extreme jeopardy. The result of
these incidents has been the plac
ing of Zeta Psi on probationary
standing for the entire 1963-1964
school year.
Stanford fraternities have long
enjoyed the privilege of auto
nomous living. The basis of this
privilege is the belief <>i fraternity
leaders in the personal self de
velopment and self discipline that
can result from a fraternal living
environment. Self development
and self discipline are values
which are upheld in our educa
tional system and fraternities are
manifested as a necessary adjunct
to the teaching of these values.
When the concept of freedom is
taken by fraternities to mean the
absense of restraint by one man
upon another, it becomes intel
lectually bankrupt. Franternities
cannot separate the concept of
freedom from the concept of re
sponsibility if they arc to continue

to exist. Responsibility becomes
the standard of judgment by
which a fraternity living group
must be assessed. If the group
ceases to engender a life which is
conducive to the intellectual, so
cial. and personal advancement
of its members, it may justifiably
be termed irresponsible.
THUS, when the abuse of free
dom becomes so apparent, mani
fested in reoecurring incidents,
low scholarship and the complete
lack of conscience to relate one's
group to the university as a
whole, the entire fraternity sys
tem is called upon to justify its
existence. This is the necessary
result when responsibility has
been thoroughly abdicated.
Zeta Psi fraternity whose once
great history included more stu
dent leaders than any other liv
ing group on campus has been
called upon by the 1.F.8. to prove
to the university and the frater
nity system that is is capable of
governing its own members, that
it is capable of contributing posi
tively to the intellectual, social,
and personal advancement of its
members, that it is capable of re
lating itself to the fraternity sys
tem and Stanford University.
THE ANSWER which Zeta Psi
is called upon to come up with
might well contain the answer to
the future of the entire fraternity
system here at Stanford. Th e
1.F.8. felt that leadership and di
rection could only be engendered
and stimulated if the entire func
tioning of the chapter remained
with its present officers and ac
tive members of the house. The
Zeta Psi fraternity has been giv
en its complete freedom and the
entire Stanford co m m unit y
awaits to see if the Zetes can
bear the responsibility.

The recent faculty appointments
include Prof. Ted Kreps of t he

of the 1.F.8.
The 1.F.8. has recently seen
due cause under its authority to
consider interfraternity problems
and policy for taking action
against Zeta Psi fraternity. Fre
quent incidents by members of
this chapter have placed its stand
ing in the fraternity system in
extreme jeopardy. The result of
these incidents has been the plac
ing of Zeta Psi on probationary
standing for the entire 1963-1964
school year.
Stanford fraternities have long
enjoyed the privilege of auto
nomous living. The basis of this
privilege is the belief <>i fraternity
leaders in the personal self de
velopment and self discipline that
can result from a fraternal living
environment. Self development
and self discipline are values
which are upheld in our educa
tional system and fraternities are
manifested as a necessary adjunct
to the teaching of these values.
When the concept of freedom is
taken by fraternities to mean the
absense of restraint by one man
upon another, it becomes intel
lectually bankrupt. Franternities
cannot separate the concept of
freedom from the concept of re
sponsibility if they arc to continue

to exist. Responsibility becomes
the standard of judgment by
which a fraternity living group
must be assessed. If the group
ceases to engender a life which is
conducive to the intellectual, so
cial. and personal advancement
of its members, it may justifiably
be termed irresponsible.
THUS, when the abuse of free
dom becomes so apparent, mani
fested in reoecurring incidents,
low scholarship and the complete
lack of conscience to relate one's
group to the university as a
whole, the entire fraternity sys
tem is called upon to justify its
existence. This is the necessary
result when responsibility has
been thoroughly abdicated.
Zeta Psi fraternity whose once
great history included more stu
dent leaders than any other liv
ing group on campus has been
called upon by the 1.F.8. to prove
to the university and the frater
nity system that is is capable of
governing its own members, that
it is capable of contributing posi
tively to the intellectual, social,
and personal advancement of its
members, that it is capable of re
lating itself to the fraternity sys
tem and Stanford University.
THE ANSWER which Zeta Psi
is called upon to come up with
might well contain the answer to
the future of the entire fraternity
system here at Stanford. Th e
1.F.8. felt that leadership and di
rection could only be engendered
and stimulated if the entire func
tioning of the chapter remained
with its present officers and ac
tive members of the house. The
Zeta Psi fraternity has been giv
en its complete freedom and the
entire Stanford co m m unit y
awaits to see if the Zetes can
bear the responsibility.

to the fraternities and originator
of the 1.F.8.
The 1.F.8. has recently seen
due cause under its authority to
consider interfraternity problems
and policy for taking action
against Zeta Psi fraternity. Fre
quent incidents by members of
this chapter have placed its stand
ing in the fraternity system in
extreme jeopardy. The result of
these incidents has been the plac
ing of Zeta Psi on probationary
standing for the entire 1963-1964
school year.
Stanford fraternities have long
enjoyed the privilege of auto
nomous living. The basis of this
privilege is the belief <>i fraternity
leaders in the personal self de
velopment and self discipline that
can result from a fraternal living
environment. Self development
and self discipline are values
which are upheld in our educa
tional system and fraternities are
manifested as a necessary adjunct
to the teaching of these values.
When the concept of freedom is
taken by fraternities to mean the
absense of restraint by one man
upon another, it becomes intel
lectually bankrupt. Franternities
cannot separate the concept of
freedom from the concept of re
sponsibility if they arc to continue

to exist. Responsibility becomes
the standard of judgment by
which a fraternity living group
must be assessed. If the group
ceases to engender a life which is
conducive to the intellectual, so
cial. and personal advancement
of its members, it may justifiably
be termed irresponsible.
THUS, when the abuse of free
dom becomes so apparent, mani
fested in reoecurring incidents,
low scholarship and the complete
lack of conscience to relate one's
group to the university as a
whole, the entire fraternity sys
tem is called upon to justify its
existence. This is the necessary
result when responsibility has
been thoroughly abdicated.
Zeta Psi fraternity whose once
great history included more stu
dent leaders than any other liv
ing group on campus has been
called upon by the 1.F.8. to prove
to the university and the frater
nity system that is is capable of
governing its own members, that
it is capable of contributing posi
tively to the intellectual, social,
and personal advancement of its
members, that it is capable of re
lating itself to the fraternity sys
tem and Stanford University.
THE ANSWER which Zeta Psi
is called upon to come up with
might well contain the answer to
the future of the entire fraternity
system here at Stanford. Th e
1.F.8. felt that leadership and di
rection could only be engendered
and stimulated if the entire func
tioning of the chapter remained
with its present officers and ac
tive members of the house. The
Zeta Psi fraternity has been giv
en its complete freedom and the
entire Stanford co m m unit y
awaits to see if the Zetes can
bear the responsibility.

due to a specific fraternity inci

death to a fraternity member, the
need for a special fraternity com
mittee to consider interfraternity
problems and policy. Such a com

came to be known as the Inter

The Board whose powers are

been involved in the role of self
government in two specific fra

these houses became involved in
numerous incidents which indi
