PEACE CORPS: NO IDEALISM
Editor, The Daily:
As an ex-Peace Corps trainee,
who like Mr. Marx, was recently
dropped from a Peace Corps proj
ect (the India IV project, trained
in Milwaukee last summer) lor
"psychological" reasons, and who
is familiar with yet another simi
lar case from a third project, I
would like 10 pass on the lessons
I have learned to future volun
teers.
The Peace Corps has been or
gan ized and run by men of a gen
eration that grew up before the
recent ferment of dedicated ideal
ism among American young
people, and they don't understand
it very well. The psychologists
and psychiatrists especially vis
ualize an "idealist" as one who
sits dreamily and contemplates,
however intelligently, the Brother
hood of Man, but who would
break down in confusion if called
on to descend from these ethereal
realms to face the reality of hard
work under frustrating, unfamil
iar conditions. They are afraid
that this unrealistic dreamer will
volunteer sentimentally for the
Peace Corps. In talking to Peace
Corps selection officials a bout
idealism, a trainee may just be
revealing an interest in integrat
ing his desire to serve into a lar
ger philosophical framework. But
unfortunately this looks to many
psychologists like "unrealistic"
dreaming. I think that this mis
understanding has caused many
able people to be dropped from
Peace Corps projects.
My advice to prospective volun
teers: A project psychologist in
terviews each trainee in a project.
The most important question in
this interview is something like
"Why did you join the Peace
Corps?" I suggest that the trainee
answer this question, and all re
lated questions, e.g., on the pur
pose of the Peace Corps, in con
crete terms of filling a specific
need with a specific skill, and
that he on no account be drawn
into a more abstract discussion.
I'm convinced that if I'd followed
this advice I'd be in the Peace
Corps today. But if another
idealistic volunteer can use my
experience to cope successfully
with the mystery of selection it
will almost be worth it.

DAILY LETTERS ANALYZED
Editor, The Daily:
As a graduate student who has
come here from a small engineer
ing school in the east. I find my
self isolated from the main flux
of student life and student atti
tudes and opinions. Therefore I
read the Letters to the Editor
column as a means of dipping
into the current of ideas which
flows through this campus. I am
pleased to observe a spirited in
terest in ethics, morality, and the
world around us. This is in sharp
contrast to the apathy of engi
neering students, on such issues, j
when they undertake study in a
wholly scientific environment.
The growth of a person may
certainly be measured by his
varied experience with ideas and
people. That Stanford has pro
duced many 'giants' is testimony !
to the electric atmosphere of this
university. Each student at Stan
ford has a rare opportunity to
grapple with thoughts and per
sonalities which challenge his
own on an intellectual plane at
or above his level. Such stimula
tion is the measure of worth of
this or any university and is the
quality which distinguishes a
university education from a pro
gram of acquiring knowledge. To
paraphrase President Sterling, an
education extends into every
phase of life.
A minimum requirement of an
education is that it facilitate the
ease with which the individual
plays his role in society. We can
certainly ask of it much more:
that our increased breadth of in
terests provide us with much
pleasure and enjoyment, that we
obtain an understanding of our
selves, rid our natures of conceit
and prejudice.
These are broad generalities
with which most Stanford stu
dents will agree. Therefore I find
it discouraging to reconcile these
values with some of the view
points expressed in the letters to
the Editor. They are quick to
question and criticize and yet they
do not seek answers. For ex
ample, the Fundamental Standard
has had an extensive airing, un
doubtedly because it deals with
sex always a popular issue. To
debate its utility or enforcibility
is amusing but scarcely meaning
ful. It expresses a code with
which one may agree or disagree.
The question one should ask is
why does the university express
an opinion on such a personal
matter. First, it certainly forces
one to consider his values in re
lation to those of others, even if
those expressed do not constitute
a majority opinion. Secondly, the
Fundamental Standard indicates
a very real concern over a major
problem today, that of unwed
mothers. In addition to being a
tragic personal problem, it is also
a considerable problem to society.
I find it amusing that because
a Stanford student observes that
the ROTC cadet is a church goer,
he concludes that Stanford's goal
may be to "educate its tinder
graduates in the operating 'tac
tics and techniques' of war." I
confess that his logic is above
me.

I particularly agree with the
student who is disgusted with the
use of vulgarity in public. Com
ing from a school where the coed
is rare, I am rather used to un
inhibited language. But I still dis
dain the depreciation of speech in
a language which is otherwise
beautiful in its variety and
subtlety. Reasoning further, com
mon usage of anglo-saxon words
deprives them of their true
strength when strength is needed
to express virulent emotions.
Again, however, I am appalled at
the logic of the student who be
lieved that the obvious alterna
tive to these public displays was
the destruction of life and / limb
and discordant family relations.
There are many ways to subli
mate primitive urges and frustra
tions. Perhaps intermural sports
are the best possible solution
since they also further develop
ment of the body.
From the evidence I have seen,
Stanford students take themsel
ves very seriously, belicing their
youth. The comment made about
Christ being on an Easter egg
hunt during the film "Barabas"
was certainly in poor taste. But
I am surprised that the com
plainant found no humor at all in
the situation. After all, we have
imputed to God many human
values such as revenge, goodness,
and mercy. Can we not also allow
Him a sense of humor? Jesus, a
compassionate being, might Him
self have chuckled at such a joke.
I admire the literacy of those
who write to the Editor. Many
of Ihem express themselves ex
ceedingly well, including those
whom I have criticized. But I
think that a gun firing blanks
provides a poor offense.

loved and admired as a living
monument to the consumate en
joyment of Sunday night flicks.
Every Sunday night, Suetos
would arrive at Mem And, hi s
overcoat bulging with an array
of horns, buzzers, small reptiles,
and assorted flashlights and noise
makers.
Suetos was blessed by God with
that highly contageous, maniac
laughter that drove uninitiate
freshmen and campus cops to the
very limits of their wits. In the
middle of a profound or dramatic
sequence, he would unfailingly
give a quick blast of his duck call
or his air horn, and explode into
that insane guffaw. Suetos was
known for his readiness to fit
the right vernacular to any situa
tion, and his propensity to throw
his shoes expressively from the
balcony to the main floor.
Suetos' golden moment, how
ever, came during the showing
of Ben Hur. in April, 1962. At the
height of the dramatic conclusion
to this cinematic epic (Christ, I
believe, was being executed), Sue
tos, deprived of his buzzers, flash
lights, etc. by clean living author
ity, ran down to the front of the
balcony, his lunatic laughter peal
ing across the hushed auditorium,
leaned over the railing, and
flashed spectacularly onto the
main floor. An unforgettable ex
perience for All concerned. In the
light, of this amazing feat, who
are we to talk about "emotional

Editor, The Daily:
I commend the Daily on its de
cision to print the column by Mr.
Russell Kirk. The Daily's opinion
page has long been dominated by
liberal throught: the columns by
Lippmann, the cartoons by Her
block, and the heavily liberal let
ters to the editor and "Staff
Opinion."
A student can certainly form a
better opinion on a current issue
if he hears all arguments. The
editorial staff should, of course,
state its opinion, but it. should
also allow all views to be aired.
The new column is a good step in
this direction. The next logical
step is to include some respon
sible conservative political c a r
toons.

a majority opinion. Secondly, the
Fundamental Standard indicates
a very real concern over a major
problem today, that of unwed
mothers. In addition to being a
tragic personal problem, it is also
a considerable problem to society.
I find it amusing that because
a Stanford student observes that
the ROTC cadet is a church goer,
he concludes that Stanford's goal
may be to "educate its tinder
graduates in the operating 'tac
tics and techniques' of war." I
confess that his logic is above
me.

I particularly agree with the
student who is disgusted with the
use of vulgarity in public. Com
ing from a school where the coed
is rare, I am rather used to un
inhibited language. But I still dis
dain the depreciation of speech in
a language which is otherwise
beautiful in its variety and
subtlety. Reasoning further, com
mon usage of anglo-saxon words
deprives them of their true
strength when strength is needed
to express virulent emotions.
Again, however, I am appalled at
the logic of the student who be
lieved that the obvious alterna
tive to these public displays was
the destruction of life and / limb
and discordant family relations.
There are many ways to subli
mate primitive urges and frustra
tions. Perhaps intermural sports
are the best possible solution
since they also further develop
ment of the body.
From the evidence I have seen,
Stanford students take themsel
ves very seriously, belicing their
youth. The comment made about
Christ being on an Easter egg
hunt during the film "Barabas"
was certainly in poor taste. But
I am surprised that the com
plainant found no humor at all in
the situation. After all, we have
imputed to God many human
values such as revenge, goodness,
and mercy. Can we not also allow
Him a sense of humor? Jesus, a
compassionate being, might Him
self have chuckled at such a joke.
I admire the literacy of those
who write to the Editor. Many
of Ihem express themselves ex
ceedingly well, including those
whom I have criticized. But I
think that a gun firing blanks

PEACE CORPS: NO IDEALISM
Editor, The Daily:
As an ex-Peace Corps trainee,
who like Mr. Marx, was recently
dropped from a Peace Corps proj
ect (the India IV project, trained
in Milwaukee last summer) lor
"psychological" reasons, and who
is familiar with yet another simi
lar case from a third project, I
would like 10 pass on the lessons
I have learned to future volun
teers.
The Peace Corps has been or
gan ized and run by men of a gen
eration that grew up before the
recent ferment of dedicated ideal
ism among American young
people, and they don't understand
it very well. The psychologists
and psychiatrists especially vis
ualize an "idealist" as one who
sits dreamily and contemplates,
however intelligently, the Brother
hood of Man, but who would
break down in confusion if called
on to descend from these ethereal
realms to face the reality of hard
work under frustrating, unfamil
iar conditions. They are afraid
that this unrealistic dreamer will
volunteer sentimentally for the
Peace Corps. In talking to Peace
Corps selection officials a bout
idealism, a trainee may just be
revealing an interest in integrat
ing his desire to serve into a lar
ger philosophical framework. But
unfortunately this looks to many
psychologists like "unrealistic"
dreaming. I think that this mis
understanding has caused many
able people to be dropped from
Peace Corps projects.
My advice to prospective volun
teers: A project psychologist in
terviews each trainee in a project.
The most important question in
this interview is something like
"Why did you join the Peace
Corps?" I suggest that the trainee
answer this question, and all re
lated questions, e.g., on the pur
pose of the Peace Corps, in con
crete terms of filling a specific
need with a specific skill, and
that he on no account be drawn
into a more abstract discussion.
I'm convinced that if I'd followed
this advice I'd be in the Peace
Corps today. But if another
idealistic volunteer can use my
experience to cope successfully
with the mystery of selection it
will almost be worth it.

DAILY LETTERS ANALYZED
Editor, The Daily:
As a graduate student who has
come here from a small engineer
ing school in the east. I find my
self isolated from the main flux
of student life and student atti
tudes and opinions. Therefore I
read the Letters to the Editor
column as a means of dipping
into the current of ideas which
flows through this campus. I am
pleased to observe a spirited in
terest in ethics, morality, and the
world around us. This is in sharp
contrast to the apathy of engi
neering students, on such issues, j
when they undertake study in a
wholly scientific environment.
The growth of a person may
certainly be measured by his
varied experience with ideas and
people. That Stanford has pro
duced many 'giants' is testimony !
to the electric atmosphere of this
university. Each student at Stan
ford has a rare opportunity to
grapple with thoughts and per
sonalities which challenge his
own on an intellectual plane at
or above his level. Such stimula
tion is the measure of worth of
this or any university and is the
quality which distinguishes a
university education from a pro
gram of acquiring knowledge. To
paraphrase President Sterling, an
education extends into every
phase of life.
A minimum requirement of an
education is that it facilitate the
ease with which the individual
plays his role in society. We can
certainly ask of it much more:
that our increased breadth of in
terests provide us with much
pleasure and enjoyment, that we
obtain an understanding of our
selves, rid our natures of conceit
and prejudice.
These are broad generalities
with which most Stanford stu
dents will agree. Therefore I find
it discouraging to reconcile these
values with some of the view
points expressed in the letters to
the Editor. They are quick to
question and criticize and yet they
do not seek answers. For ex
ample, the Fundamental Standard
has had an extensive airing, un
doubtedly because it deals with
sex always a popular issue. To
debate its utility or enforcibility
is amusing but scarcely meaning
ful. It expresses a code with
which one may agree or disagree.
The question one should ask is
why does the university express
an opinion on such a personal
matter. First, it certainly forces
one to consider his values in re
lation to those of others, even if
those expressed do not constitute
a majority opinion. Secondly, the
Fundamental Standard indicates
a very real concern over a major
problem today, that of unwed
mothers. In addition to being a
tragic personal problem, it is also
a considerable problem to society.
I find it amusing that because
a Stanford student observes that
the ROTC cadet is a church goer,
he concludes that Stanford's goal
may be to "educate its tinder
graduates in the operating 'tac
tics and techniques' of war." I

As an ex-Peace Corps trainee,
who like Mr. Marx, was recently
dropped from a Peace Corps proj
ect (the India IV project, trained
in Milwaukee last summer) lor
"psychological" reasons, and who
is familiar with yet another simi
lar case from a third project, I
would like 10 pass on the lessons
I have learned to future volun
teers.
The Peace Corps has been or
gan ized and run by men of a gen
eration that grew up before the
recent ferment of dedicated ideal
ism among American young
people, and they don't understand
it very well. The psychologists
and psychiatrists especially vis
ualize an "idealist" as one who
sits dreamily and contemplates,
however intelligently, the Brother
hood of Man, but who would
break down in confusion if called
on to descend from these ethereal
realms to face the reality of hard
work under frustrating, unfamil
iar conditions. They are afraid
that this unrealistic dreamer will
volunteer sentimentally for the
Peace Corps. In talking to Peace
Corps selection officials a bout
idealism, a trainee may just be
revealing an interest in integrat
ing his desire to serve into a lar
ger philosophical framework. But
unfortunately this looks to many
psychologists like "unrealistic"
dreaming. I think that this mis
understanding has caused many
able people to be dropped from
Peace Corps projects.
My advice to prospective volun
teers: A project psychologist in
terviews each trainee in a project.
The most important question in
this interview is something like
"Why did you join the Peace
Corps?" I suggest that the trainee
answer this question, and all re
lated questions, e.g., on the pur
pose of the Peace Corps, in con
crete terms of filling a specific
need with a specific skill, and
that he on no account be drawn
into a more abstract discussion.
I'm convinced that if I'd followed
this advice I'd be in the Peace
Corps today. But if another
idealistic volunteer can use my
experience to cope successfully
with the mystery of selection it
will almost be worth it.

DAILY LETTERS ANALYZED
Editor, The Daily:
As a graduate student who has
come here from a small engineer
ing school in the east. I find my
self isolated from the main flux
of student life and student atti
tudes and opinions. Therefore I
read the Letters to the Editor
column as a means of dipping
into the current of ideas which
flows through this campus. I am
pleased to observe a spirited in
terest in ethics, morality, and the
world around us. This is in sharp
contrast to the apathy of engi
neering students, on such issues, j
when they undertake study in a
wholly scientific environment.
The growth of a person may
certainly be measured by his
varied experience with ideas and
people. That Stanford has pro
duced many 'giants' is testimony !
to the electric atmosphere of this
university. Each student at Stan
ford has a rare opportunity to
grapple with thoughts and per
sonalities which challenge his
own on an intellectual plane at
or above his level. Such stimula
tion is the measure of worth of
this or any university and is the
quality which distinguishes a
university education from a pro
gram of acquiring knowledge. To
paraphrase President Sterling, an
education extends into every
phase of life.
A minimum requirement of an
education is that it facilitate the
ease with which the individual
plays his role in society. We can
certainly ask of it much more:
that our increased breadth of in
terests provide us with much
pleasure and enjoyment, that we
obtain an understanding of our
selves, rid our natures of conceit
and prejudice.
These are broad generalities
with which most Stanford stu
dents will agree. Therefore I find
it discouraging to reconcile these
values with some of the view
points expressed in the letters to
the Editor. They are quick to
question and criticize and yet they
do not seek answers. For ex
ample, the Fundamental Standard
has had an extensive airing, un
doubtedly because it deals with
sex always a popular issue. To
debate its utility or enforcibility
is amusing but scarcely meaning
ful. It expresses a code with
which one may agree or disagree.
The question one should ask is
why does the university express
an opinion on such a personal
matter. First, it certainly forces
one to consider his values in re
lation to those of others, even if
those expressed do not constitute
a majority opinion. Secondly, the
Fundamental Standard indicates
a very real concern over a major
problem today, that of unwed
mothers. In addition to being a
tragic personal problem, it is also
a considerable problem to society.
I find it amusing that because
a Stanford student observes that
the ROTC cadet is a church goer,
he concludes that Stanford's goal
may be to "educate its tinder
graduates in the operating 'tac
tics and techniques' of war." I
confess that his logic is above
me.

I particularly agree with the
student who is disgusted with the
use of vulgarity in public. Com
ing from a school where the coed
is rare, I am rather used to un
inhibited language. But I still dis
dain the depreciation of speech in
a language which is otherwise
beautiful in its variety and
subtlety. Reasoning further, com
mon usage of anglo-saxon words
deprives them of their true
strength when strength is needed
to express virulent emotions.
Again, however, I am appalled at
the logic of the student who be
lieved that the obvious alterna
tive to these public displays was
the destruction of life and / limb
and discordant family relations.
There are many ways to subli
mate primitive urges and frustra
tions. Perhaps intermural sports
are the best possible solution
since they also further develop
ment of the body.
From the evidence I have seen,
Stanford students take themsel
ves very seriously, belicing their
youth. The comment made about
Christ being on an Easter egg
hunt during the film "Barabas"
was certainly in poor taste. But
I am surprised that the com
plainant found no humor at all in
the situation. After all, we have
imputed to God many human
values such as revenge, goodness,
and mercy. Can we not also allow
Him a sense of humor? Jesus, a
compassionate being, might Him
self have chuckled at such a joke.
I admire the literacy of those
who write to the Editor. Many
of Ihem express themselves ex
ceedingly well, including those
whom I have criticized. But I
think that a gun firing blanks
provides a poor offense.

Every Sunday night, Suetos
would arrive at Mem And, hi s

of horns, buzzers, small reptiles,

makers.
Suetos was blessed by God with
that highly contageous, maniac
laughter that drove uninitiate
freshmen and campus cops to the
very limits of their wits. In the
middle of a profound or dramatic

give a quick blast of his duck call
or his air horn, and explode into
that insane guffaw. Suetos was
known for his readiness to fit
the right vernacular to any situa
tion, and his propensity to throw
his shoes expressively from the
balcony to the main floor.
Suetos' golden moment, how
ever, came during the showing
of Ben Hur. in April, 1962. At the
height of the dramatic conclusion
to this cinematic epic (Christ, I
believe, was being executed), Sue
tos, deprived of his buzzers, flash
lights, etc. by clean living author
ity, ran down to the front of the
balcony, his lunatic laughter peal

leaned over the railing, and
flashed spectacularly onto the

A student can certainly form a

a very real concern over a major
problem today, that of unwed
mothers. In addition to being a
tragic personal problem, it is also
a considerable problem to society.
I find it amusing that because
a Stanford student observes that
the ROTC cadet is a church goer,
he concludes that Stanford's goal
may be to "educate its tinder
graduates in the operating 'tac
tics and techniques' of war." I
confess that his logic is above
me.

I particularly agree with the
student who is disgusted with the
use of vulgarity in public. Com
ing from a school where the coed
is rare, I am rather used to un
inhibited language. But I still dis
dain the depreciation of speech in
a language which is otherwise
beautiful in its variety and
subtlety. Reasoning further, com
mon usage of anglo-saxon words
deprives them of their true
strength when strength is needed
to express virulent emotions.
Again, however, I am appalled at
the logic of the student who be
lieved that the obvious alterna
tive to these public displays was
the destruction of life and / limb
and discordant family relations.
There are many ways to subli
mate primitive urges and frustra
tions. Perhaps intermural sports
are the best possible solution
since they also further develop
ment of the body.
From the evidence I have seen,
Stanford students take themsel
ves very seriously, belicing their
youth. The comment made about
Christ being on an Easter egg
hunt during the film "Barabas"
was certainly in poor taste. But
I am surprised that the com
plainant found no humor at all in
the situation. After all, we have
imputed to God many human
values such as revenge, goodness,
and mercy. Can we not also allow
Him a sense of humor? Jesus, a
compassionate being, might Him
self have chuckled at such a joke.
I admire the literacy of those
who write to the Editor. Many
of Ihem express themselves ex
ceedingly well, including those
whom I have criticized. But I
think that a gun firing blanks

PEACE CORPS: NO IDEALISM
Editor, The Daily:
As an ex-Peace Corps trainee,
who like Mr. Marx, was recently
dropped from a Peace Corps proj
ect (the India IV project, trained
in Milwaukee last summer) lor
"psychological" reasons, and who
is familiar with yet another simi
lar case from a third project, I
would like 10 pass on the lessons
I have learned to future volun
teers.
The Peace Corps has been or
gan ized and run by men of a gen
eration that grew up before the
recent ferment of dedicated ideal
ism among American young
people, and they don't understand
it very well. The psychologists
and psychiatrists especially vis
ualize an "idealist" as one who
sits dreamily and contemplates,
however intelligently, the Brother
hood of Man, but who would
break down in confusion if called
on to descend from these ethereal
realms to face the reality of hard
work under frustrating, unfamil
iar conditions. They are afraid
that this unrealistic dreamer will
volunteer sentimentally for the
Peace Corps. In talking to Peace
Corps selection officials a bout
idealism, a trainee may just be
revealing an interest in integrat
ing his desire to serve into a lar
ger philosophical framework. But
unfortunately this looks to many
psychologists like "unrealistic"
dreaming. I think that this mis
understanding has caused many
able people to be dropped from
Peace Corps projects.
My advice to prospective volun
teers: A project psychologist in
terviews each trainee in a project.
The most important question in
this interview is something like
"Why did you join the Peace
Corps?" I suggest that the trainee
answer this question, and all re
lated questions, e.g., on the pur
pose of the Peace Corps, in con
crete terms of filling a specific
need with a specific skill, and
that he on no account be drawn
into a more abstract discussion.
I'm convinced that if I'd followed
this advice I'd be in the Peace
Corps today. But if another
idealistic volunteer can use my
experience to cope successfully
with the mystery of selection it
will almost be worth it.

DAILY LETTERS ANALYZED
Editor, The Daily:
As a graduate student who has
come here from a small engineer
ing school in the east. I find my
self isolated from the main flux
of student life and student atti
tudes and opinions. Therefore I
read the Letters to the Editor
column as a means of dipping
into the current of ideas which
flows through this campus. I am
pleased to observe a spirited in
terest in ethics, morality, and the
world around us. This is in sharp
contrast to the apathy of engi
neering students, on such issues, j
when they undertake study in a
wholly scientific environment.
The growth of a person may
certainly be measured by his
varied experience with ideas and
people. That Stanford has pro
duced many 'giants' is testimony !
to the electric atmosphere of this
university. Each student at Stan
ford has a rare opportunity to
grapple with thoughts and per
sonalities which challenge his
own on an intellectual plane at
or above his level. Such stimula
tion is the measure of worth of
this or any university and is the
quality which distinguishes a
university education from a pro
gram of acquiring knowledge. To
paraphrase President Sterling, an
education extends into every
phase of life.
A minimum requirement of an
education is that it facilitate the
ease with which the individual
plays his role in society. We can
certainly ask of it much more:
that our increased breadth of in
terests provide us with much
pleasure and enjoyment, that we
obtain an understanding of our
selves, rid our natures of conceit
and prejudice.
These are broad generalities
with which most Stanford stu
dents will agree. Therefore I find
it discouraging to reconcile these
values with some of the view
points expressed in the letters to
the Editor. They are quick to
question and criticize and yet they
do not seek answers. For ex
ample, the Fundamental Standard
has had an extensive airing, un
doubtedly because it deals with
sex always a popular issue. To
debate its utility or enforcibility
is amusing but scarcely meaning
ful. It expresses a code with
which one may agree or disagree.
The question one should ask is
why does the university express
an opinion on such a personal
matter. First, it certainly forces
one to consider his values in re
lation to those of others, even if
those expressed do not constitute
a majority opinion. Secondly, the
Fundamental Standard indicates
a very real concern over a major
problem today, that of unwed
mothers. In addition to being a
tragic personal problem, it is also
a considerable problem to society.
I find it amusing that because
a Stanford student observes that
the ROTC cadet is a church goer,
he concludes that Stanford's goal
may be to "educate its tinder
graduates in the operating 'tac
tics and techniques' of war." I

who like Mr. Marx, was recently
dropped from a Peace Corps proj
ect (the India IV project, trained
in Milwaukee last summer) lor
"psychological" reasons, and who
is familiar with yet another simi
lar case from a third project, I
would like 10 pass on the lessons
I have learned to future volun
teers.
The Peace Corps has been or
gan ized and run by men of a gen
eration that grew up before the
recent ferment of dedicated ideal
ism among American young
people, and they don't understand
it very well. The psychologists
and psychiatrists especially vis
ualize an "idealist" as one who
sits dreamily and contemplates,
however intelligently, the Brother
hood of Man, but who would
break down in confusion if called
on to descend from these ethereal
realms to face the reality of hard
work under frustrating, unfamil
iar conditions. They are afraid
that this unrealistic dreamer will
volunteer sentimentally for the
Peace Corps. In talking to Peace
Corps selection officials a bout
idealism, a trainee may just be
revealing an interest in integrat
ing his desire to serve into a lar
ger philosophical framework. But
unfortunately this looks to many
psychologists like "unrealistic"
dreaming. I think that this mis
understanding has caused many
able people to be dropped from
Peace Corps projects.
My advice to prospective volun
teers: A project psychologist in
terviews each trainee in a project.
The most important question in
this interview is something like
"Why did you join the Peace
Corps?" I suggest that the trainee
answer this question, and all re
lated questions, e.g., on the pur
pose of the Peace Corps, in con
crete terms of filling a specific
need with a specific skill, and
that he on no account be drawn
into a more abstract discussion.
I'm convinced that if I'd followed
this advice I'd be in the Peace
Corps today. But if another
idealistic volunteer can use my
experience to cope successfully
with the mystery of selection it
will almost be worth it.

DAILY LETTERS ANALYZED
Editor, The Daily:
As a graduate student who has
come here from a small engineer
ing school in the east. I find my
self isolated from the main flux
of student life and student atti
tudes and opinions. Therefore I
read the Letters to the Editor
column as a means of dipping
into the current of ideas which
flows through this campus. I am
pleased to observe a spirited in
terest in ethics, morality, and the
world around us. This is in sharp
contrast to the apathy of engi
neering students, on such issues, j
when they undertake study in a
wholly scientific environment.
The growth of a person may
certainly be measured by his
varied experience with ideas and
people. That Stanford has pro
duced many 'giants' is testimony !
to the electric atmosphere of this
university. Each student at Stan
ford has a rare opportunity to
grapple with thoughts and per
sonalities which challenge his
own on an intellectual plane at
or above his level. Such stimula
tion is the measure of worth of
this or any university and is the
quality which distinguishes a
university education from a pro
gram of acquiring knowledge. To
paraphrase President Sterling, an
education extends into every
phase of life.
A minimum requirement of an
education is that it facilitate the
ease with which the individual
plays his role in society. We can
certainly ask of it much more:
that our increased breadth of in
terests provide us with much
pleasure and enjoyment, that we
obtain an understanding of our
selves, rid our natures of conceit
and prejudice.
These are broad generalities
with which most Stanford stu
dents will agree. Therefore I find
it discouraging to reconcile these
values with some of the view
points expressed in the letters to
the Editor. They are quick to
question and criticize and yet they
do not seek answers. For ex
ample, the Fundamental Standard
has had an extensive airing, un
doubtedly because it deals with
sex always a popular issue. To
debate its utility or enforcibility
is amusing but scarcely meaning
ful. It expresses a code with
which one may agree or disagree.
The question one should ask is
why does the university express
an opinion on such a personal
matter. First, it certainly forces
one to consider his values in re
lation to those of others, even if
those expressed do not constitute
a majority opinion. Secondly, the
Fundamental Standard indicates
a very real concern over a major
problem today, that of unwed
mothers. In addition to being a
tragic personal problem, it is also
a considerable problem to society.
I find it amusing that because
a Stanford student observes that
the ROTC cadet is a church goer,
he concludes that Stanford's goal
may be to "educate its tinder
graduates in the operating 'tac
tics and techniques' of war." I
confess that his logic is above
me.

I particularly agree with the
student who is disgusted with the
use of vulgarity in public. Com
ing from a school where the coed
is rare, I am rather used to un
inhibited language. But I still dis
dain the depreciation of speech in
a language which is otherwise
beautiful in its variety and
subtlety. Reasoning further, com
mon usage of anglo-saxon words
deprives them of their true
strength when strength is needed
to express virulent emotions.
Again, however, I am appalled at
the logic of the student who be
lieved that the obvious alterna
tive to these public displays was
the destruction of life and / limb
and discordant family relations.
There are many ways to subli
mate primitive urges and frustra
tions. Perhaps intermural sports
are the best possible solution
since they also further develop
ment of the body.
From the evidence I have seen,
Stanford students take themsel
ves very seriously, belicing their
youth. The comment made about
Christ being on an Easter egg
hunt during the film "Barabas"
was certainly in poor taste. But
I am surprised that the com
plainant found no humor at all in
the situation. After all, we have
imputed to God many human
values such as revenge, goodness,
and mercy. Can we not also allow
Him a sense of humor? Jesus, a
compassionate being, might Him
self have chuckled at such a joke.
I admire the literacy of those
who write to the Editor. Many
of Ihem express themselves ex
ceedingly well, including those
whom I have criticized. But I
think that a gun firing blanks
provides a poor offense.

Every Sunday night, Suetos

of horns, buzzers, small reptiles,

Suetos was blessed by God with
that highly contageous, maniac
laughter that drove uninitiate
freshmen and campus cops to the
very limits of their wits. In the

give a quick blast of his duck call

that insane guffaw. Suetos was
known for his readiness to fit
the right vernacular to any situa
tion, and his propensity to throw
his shoes expressively from the
balcony to the main floor.
Suetos' golden moment, how
ever, came during the showing
of Ben Hur. in April, 1962. At the
height of the dramatic conclusion
to this cinematic epic (Christ, I
believe, was being executed), Sue
tos, deprived of his buzzers, flash

balcony, his lunatic laughter peal

leaned over the railing, and
flashed spectacularly onto the

A student can certainly form a
