# 'The Leopard' Fails As Example of Cinema Art
## 
### JOHN THAYER Daily Drama Critic 
1963 must have been an off year
at the Cannes Film Festival; for,
though "The Leopard" is a fine
film in many respects, it is still
a failure as an example of cinema
tic art. Set in Sicily during the
Garibaldi Revolution of 1860, the
story concerns The Leopard, last
of the great princes of Salina, the
Prince's nephew Tancredi, and
Angelica, the daughter of a sud
denly-wealthy bourgeois.
To escape the summer heat of
Palermo and avoid the possibility
of unpleasantness with the local
insurrectionists, the Prince goes
with his family to Donna Fugata.
the ancestral home of the Salinas.
There Tancredi falls in love with
Angelica, the daughter of a weal
thy bouregois, a match of which
the Prince must reluctantly ap
prove, since the Salina fortunes
are on the decline and since Tan
credi needs money to further his
diplomatic career. The Prince
deals a further blow to his pride
when he votes "si" for a republic
he knows will eventually destroy
him. His increasing despair is
evidenced in his refusal of an ap
pointment to the Italian senate;
and the picture ends with the
final, bitter realization that he is
truly growing old.
THE PICTURE is much too
long. The writer and director ap
parently tried to reproduce Gui
seppe de Lampeduca's novel on
the screen. A rendering, faithful
in every detail, of a novel of "The
Leopard's"' genre is just not
dramatically possible. It was a
valiant, a noble effort, but it
failed; ever so elegantly, but it
nevertheless failed. No audience,
however complaisant, is capable
of sustaining the mood and emo
tion the picture demands for two
hours and forty minutes.
The theme of the novel and the
picture is decadence; it is a por
trait of the magnificent ruin of a
man bearing the weight of 2,500
years of tradition, living with the
harshness, bleakness, and tired
ness of his country, coming to
grips with the emptiness and in
evitably approaching end of all
that he and centuries have stood

for. All of Sicily is a death wish,
and the Prince has more cause to
wish for death than most. The
picture spends an hour or so hint
ing at this theme; then the Prince
neatly develops it while percep
tively probing the causes of Si
cily's condition in an interview
with a government representa
tive. And unfortunately there
follows another hoCir of thematic
exposition which becomes intoler
ably boring before the last, digni
fied fadeout.
CLAUDIA CARDINALE and
Alain Delon as Angelica and Tan
credi are required, as indeed are
all the other characters save one,
only to be glittering stereotypes;
and glittering they are. In fact,
in their youth and sensuality they
create a brilliant contrast to the
aging Leopard. It is upon Burt
Lancaster, of course, that the en
tire burden of acting falls. Al
though he is not. quite great
enough for the role of the Prince,
not quite great enough to really
be the character he is portraying
instead of merely acting the part,
he makes a very commendable at
tempt to do so. The high spots in
his performance almost save the
all too frequent low ones. Bu 1
they cannot quite save them, and
that makes all the difference.
Technically the picture is ex
cellent. Special compliments are
due the set designers, the ward
robe people, and the hair stylists
for creating very effectively a
pervasive atmosphere of deca
dence. The photography and di
recting also deserve mention. The
magnificent landscape sequences
brilliantly reveal the harshness of
the island, and the smooth transi
tions from scene to scene, from
place to place, are to the credit
of the director. The music is
beautiful and very well-integrated
with the action.
It is really a shame that the
picture is so long and Burt Lan
caster's acting so unsatisfying,
because the movie has many fine
points. But the viewer still comes
away thinking how good a pic
ture- it might have been instead
of how good it was. And this is
not the mark of a successful mo
tion picture.

CLAUDIA CARDINALE and
Alain Delon as Angelica and Tan
credi are required, as indeed are
all the other characters save one,
only to be glittering stereotypes;
and glittering they are. In fact,
in their youth and sensuality they
create a brilliant contrast to the
aging Leopard. It is upon Burt
Lancaster, of course, that the en
tire burden of acting falls. Al
though he is not. quite great
enough for the role of the Prince,
not quite great enough to really
be the character he is portraying
instead of merely acting the part,
he makes a very commendable at
tempt to do so. The high spots in
his performance almost save the
all too frequent low ones. Bu 1
they cannot quite save them, and
that makes all the difference.
Technically the picture is ex
cellent. Special compliments are
due the set designers, the ward
robe people, and the hair stylists
for creating very effectively a
pervasive atmosphere of deca
dence. The photography and di
recting also deserve mention. The
magnificent landscape sequences
brilliantly reveal the harshness of
the island, and the smooth transi
tions from scene to scene, from
place to place, are to the credit
of the director. The music is
beautiful and very well-integrated
with the action.
It is really a shame that the
picture is so long and Burt Lan
caster's acting so unsatisfying,
because the movie has many fine
points. But the viewer still comes
away thinking how good a pic

of how good it was. And this is
not the mark of a successful mo

1963 must have been an off year
at the Cannes Film Festival; for,
though "The Leopard" is a fine
film in many respects, it is still
a failure as an example of cinema
tic art. Set in Sicily during the
Garibaldi Revolution of 1860, the
story concerns The Leopard, last
of the great princes of Salina, the
Prince's nephew Tancredi, and
Angelica, the daughter of a sud
denly-wealthy bourgeois.
To escape the summer heat of
Palermo and avoid the possibility
of unpleasantness with the local
insurrectionists, the Prince goes
with his family to Donna Fugata.
the ancestral home of the Salinas.
There Tancredi falls in love with
Angelica, the daughter of a weal
thy bouregois, a match of which
the Prince must reluctantly ap
prove, since the Salina fortunes
are on the decline and since Tan
credi needs money to further his
diplomatic career. The Prince
deals a further blow to his pride
when he votes "si" for a republic
he knows will eventually destroy
him. His increasing despair is
evidenced in his refusal of an ap
pointment to the Italian senate;
and the picture ends with the
final, bitter realization that he is
truly growing old.
THE PICTURE is much too
long. The writer and director ap
parently tried to reproduce Gui
seppe de Lampeduca's novel on
the screen. A rendering, faithful
in every detail, of a novel of "The
Leopard's"' genre is just not
dramatically possible. It was a
valiant, a noble effort, but it
failed; ever so elegantly, but it
nevertheless failed. No audience,
however complaisant, is capable
of sustaining the mood and emo
tion the picture demands for two
hours and forty minutes.
The theme of the novel and the
picture is decadence; it is a por
trait of the magnificent ruin of a
man bearing the weight of 2,500
years of tradition, living with the
harshness, bleakness, and tired
ness of his country, coming to
grips with the emptiness and in
evitably approaching end of all
that he and centuries have stood

for. All of Sicily is a death wish,
and the Prince has more cause to
wish for death than most. The
picture spends an hour or so hint
ing at this theme; then the Prince
neatly develops it while percep
tively probing the causes of Si
cily's condition in an interview
with a government representa

follows another hoCir of thematic

the ancestral home of the Salinas.

the Prince must reluctantly ap
prove, since the Salina fortunes

diplomatic career. The Prince
deals a further blow to his pride
when he votes "si" for a republic

him. His increasing despair is
evidenced in his refusal of an ap
pointment to the Italian senate;
and the picture ends with the
final, bitter realization that he is
truly growing old.
THE PICTURE is much too
long. The writer and director ap
parently tried to reproduce Gui
seppe de Lampeduca's novel on
the screen. A rendering, faithful
in every detail, of a novel of "The
Leopard's"' genre is just not
dramatically possible. It was a
valiant, a noble effort, but it
failed; ever so elegantly, but it
nevertheless failed. No audience,
however complaisant, is capable
of sustaining the mood and emo
tion the picture demands for two
hours and forty minutes.
The theme of the novel and the
picture is decadence; it is a por
trait of the magnificent ruin of a
man bearing the weight of 2,500
years of tradition, living with the
harshness, bleakness, and tired
ness of his country, coming to
grips with the emptiness and in
evitably approaching end of all
that he and centuries have stood

for. All of Sicily is a death wish,
and the Prince has more cause to
wish for death than most. The
picture spends an hour or so hint
ing at this theme; then the Prince
neatly develops it while percep
tively probing the causes of Si
cily's condition in an interview
with a government representa
tive. And unfortunately there
follows another hoCir of thematic
exposition which becomes intoler
ably boring before the last, digni
fied fadeout.
CLAUDIA CARDINALE and
Alain Delon as Angelica and Tan
credi are required, as indeed are
all the other characters save one,
only to be glittering stereotypes;
and glittering they are. In fact,
in their youth and sensuality they
create a brilliant contrast to the
aging Leopard. It is upon Burt
Lancaster, of course, that the en
tire burden of acting falls. Al
though he is not. quite great
enough for the role of the Prince,
not quite great enough to really
be the character he is portraying
instead of merely acting the part,
he makes a very commendable at
tempt to do so. The high spots in
his performance almost save the
all too frequent low ones. Bu 1
they cannot quite save them, and
that makes all the difference.
Technically the picture is ex
cellent. Special compliments are
due the set designers, the ward
robe people, and the hair stylists
for creating very effectively a
pervasive atmosphere of deca
dence. The photography and di
recting also deserve mention. The
magnificent landscape sequences
brilliantly reveal the harshness of
the island, and the smooth transi
tions from scene to scene, from
place to place, are to the credit
of the director. The music is
beautiful and very well-integrated
with the action.
It is really a shame that the
picture is so long and Burt Lan
caster's acting so unsatisfying,
because the movie has many fine
points. But the viewer still comes
away thinking how good a pic
ture- it might have been instead
of how good it was. And this is
not the mark of a successful mo
tion picture.

1963 must have been an off year
at the Cannes Film Festival; for,
though "The Leopard" is a fine
film in many respects, it is still
a failure as an example of cinema
tic art. Set in Sicily during the
Garibaldi Revolution of 1860, the
story concerns The Leopard, last
of the great princes of Salina, the
Prince's nephew Tancredi, and
Angelica, the daughter of a sud
denly-wealthy bourgeois.
To escape the summer heat of
Palermo and avoid the possibility
of unpleasantness with the local
insurrectionists, the Prince goes
with his family to Donna Fugata.
the ancestral home of the Salinas.
There Tancredi falls in love with
Angelica, the daughter of a weal
