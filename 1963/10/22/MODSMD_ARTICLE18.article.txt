# Papooses Drop Trobabes With Third Period Splurge
## 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
On the strength of two third
period touchdowns, the Stanford
freshman football team overcame
the reputation of the Southern
California Trojans, winning 127
in a game Coach Walsh called a
"big one" for his charges.
"WE PLAYED poorly in the
first half because of Southern
Cal's awesome reputation," said
Coach Walsh, "but we came back
well in the third quarter, in spite
of some injuries."
Suffering injuries for the In
dians were quarterback Dave
Lewis, who sustained a bone chip
on his passing hand during
the first half, and Kick Biancina,
described by Walsh as "a tremen
dous leader and good field mar
shal," who hurt his foot after
engineering two touchdown drives
in the third quarter.
THE EXTENT of these injuries
are not known as yet, but ihe
coaching staff is hopeful that they
aren't too serious. The team had
made the trip without the serv
ices of fullback Mike Hibler, and
end Don Desomdrie, regulars who
had been injured earlier in the
week.
Tallying for the first frosh
touchdown was Bob Oar who
took a handoff on the Trojan -18-
yard line, skirted around end and
outran the Southern Cal de
fenders. An attempt for a two
point conversion failed when
Biancina's pass into the end zone
fell incomplete.
THE SECOND score was re
corded on a six-yard plunge by
fullback John Read, who showed,
according to Coach Walsh, "great
linebacking and great running"
throughout the game. Again a
pass for two points didn't connect
and Stanford led 12-0 going into
the fourth quarter.
USC finally was able to dent
the Stanford defenses in the
fourth quarter, as Jim Grady cli
maxed the drive by scoring on a

| run from the seven. Jameson
kicked the extra point to finish
. the scoring.
WALSH WAS pleased especi-
I ally with the play of his bnckfield.
! "Our backs looked pretty good
i both ways. Biancina did a fine job
of quarterbaeking in taking Lew
is's place, Head (fullback John)
ran and blocked very well, and
halfbacks Bob Blunt and Bob Oar,
showed good speed on offense and
defense. We played pretty good
ball after we overcame the first
half jitters."
Next Saturday the frosh go up
against the UCLA freshman in a
10:00 game on Saturday, Oct. 2G,
at Stanford Stadium; preliminary
to the Stanford-Notre Dame var
sity contest.

end Don Desomdrie, regulars who
had been injured earlier in the
week.
Tallying for the first frosh
touchdown was Bob Oar who
took a handoff on the Trojan -18-
yard line, skirted around end and
outran the Southern Cal de
fenders. An attempt for a two
point conversion failed when
Biancina's pass into the end zone
fell incomplete.
THE SECOND score was re
corded on a six-yard plunge by
fullback John Read, who showed,
according to Coach Walsh, "great
linebacking and great running"
throughout the game. Again a
pass for two points didn't connect
and Stanford led 12-0 going into
the fourth quarter.
USC finally was able to dent
the Stanford defenses in the
fourth quarter, as Jim Grady cli
maxed the drive by scoring on a

| run from the seven. Jameson
kicked the extra point to finish
. the scoring.
WALSH WAS pleased especi-
I ally with the play of his bnckfield.
! "Our backs looked pretty good
i both ways. Biancina did a fine job
of quarterbaeking in taking Lew
is's place, Head (fullback John)
ran and blocked very well, and
halfbacks Bob Blunt and Bob Oar,
showed good speed on offense and
defense. We played pretty good
ball after we overcame the first
half jitters."
Next Saturday the frosh go up
against the UCLA freshman in a
10:00 game on Saturday, Oct. 2G,
at Stanford Stadium; preliminary
to the Stanford-Notre Dame var
sity contest.
On the strength of two third
period touchdowns, the Stanford
freshman football team overcame
the reputation of the Southern
California Trojans, winning 127
in a game Coach Walsh called a
"big one" for his charges.
"WE PLAYED poorly in the
first half because of Southern
Cal's awesome reputation," said
Coach Walsh, "but we came back
well in the third quarter, in spite
of some injuries."
Suffering injuries for the In
dians were quarterback Dave
Lewis, who sustained a bone chip
on his passing hand during
the first half, and Kick Biancina,
described by Walsh as "a tremen
dous leader and good field mar
shal," who hurt his foot after
engineering two touchdown drives
in the third quarter.
THE EXTENT of these injuries
are not known as yet, but ihe
coaching staff is hopeful that they
aren't too serious. The team had
made the trip without the serv
ices of fullback Mike Hibler, and
end Don Desomdrie, regulars who
had been injured earlier in the
week.
