# Cindermen Stop UCLA

### TOM ELIAS 
Stanford's cross-country team
won its first dual meet of the
season Saturday morning, besting
UCLA 19 to 40 on the Indian
course.
Stanford's Harry McCalla ran
away from the field and then
coasted in for a 20:35.2 clocking
and first place, four seconds
ahead of Indian Weym Kir k
land, whose 20:39 time for second
place in his first race of the sea
son was a considerable improve
ment over his practice marks.
DAVE DEUBNER, in with a
20:44, reverted to his top form
| in taking fourth behind Bruin
Dave Weeks. Fourth man for the
Tribe was Paul Schlicke in fifth
place and Bill Pratt, in seventh
place, was Stanford's fifth man.
But the 21:16 time of J un i or
Bruce Johnson. Stanford's sixth
man, was singled out by coach
Payton Jordan as the outstanding
performance turned in by a Car
dinal.
The excellent time was an im
provement of nearly two minutes
over Johnson's previous best, and
enabled him to beat out estab
lished regulars Harlan Andrews
and Bob Miltz.
THE AGGREGATE team total
time by Stanford of 1:44:04.2 was
the sixth best ever turned in by
any five man team over the rough
4.2 mile course.
Jordan, very pleased with his
team's performance, said only
that his squad was "very much
|impr o v e d. I'm particularly
! pleased with Johnson's rapid im
| provement in every meet and
: practice."
Next meet for the Tribe will be
! a tough triangular contest at Ber
keley on Saturday against Cal and
Southern California. Heading the
USC team should be sophomore
i Bruce Bess, holder of the fresh
j man record over the Stanford
I course.
IT IS QUESTIONABLE as to
' whether Trojan star Julio Marin
! will be able to participate, due to
! eligibility problems stemming
from his transfer from a junior
college to Southern Cal.
The host Bears of California
| should be out for blood in the 9:30
1 a.m. meet next week, having been
shut out by defending national
champion San Jose State last Sat
urday.
