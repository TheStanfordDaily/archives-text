# Foreign Student Comments on Oddities of Cricket at Stanford
## 
### DHANJOO GHISTA 
In April you could get even
money for Stanford to win the
championship, and although bad
luck robbed ihem of some excit
ing victories, they narrowly
missed drinking champagne from
the cup of victory in their very
first season in the California
Cricket League. Even then, th e
side made an otherwise ignoble
summer romantic and memorable
and brought cricket to the con
sciousness of the Stanford public.
OUR CRICKETERS always in
the game in the right spirit—if
you are bowling, then don't think
that the other fellow is your en
emy, but just think of getting
him out and the quicker the bet
ter; for you play the game to en
joy it, and you can't do it if you
are going to allow anything to
upset you.
Used to playing friendly
matches in a spirit of gay aban
don, the Stanford cricketers
found themselves playing in tour
nament matches in a "win at all
cost" atmosphere. A "boundary
bye" was cheered to an echo,
whereas previously it drew mild
appreciative applause. In this
type of Sunday afternoon cricket
one would think every team has
a right to expect a reasonable
total to chase.
THERE IS AN unwritten code
between teams, in this declaration
business. But only too often
things went'wrong between sides.
One side felt that the other didn't
play the game, and the total set
to win got larger and larger as
if to say we won't give you a
Ihing if we can help it.
For all that, the spectators
could never complain of a dullj
moment. Often they were more j
ruffled by events on the fringe ,

than in Iho middle.
There was the usual procession
on the field of amused onlookers
trying to make head or tail of
this strange spectacle of seeing
a fellow come bearing down from
one end, his hands whirling like
a windmill and then the striker
neatly deflecting it off his legs
and drawing applause for this
"foul ball."
THEN THERE was the
strange case of the groundsman
who tried to exert his nonexistant
authority to demand a premature
halt to the proceedings. Gruff
tones drifted across the field; the
opposing bowler raised dust as
he came to a halt, and our bats
man, complaining of his concen
tration being disturbed, threw his
bat down in disgust, while those
who sympathized with the cricket
ers' predicament took consider
able pleasure in voicing their
views.
ON THE WHOLE it has been
a most enjoyable season (the
new season has already started
as far as we are concerned).
Cricket has come to stay, I hope,
on this campus. Our cricketers,
by their geniality on and off the
game, showed that cricket is the
gayest way of spending a week
end afternoon.
Victory and defeat are much
the same thing, quickly for got
ten. What matters is enjoying
the game and making it enjoy
able for others participating in
the game.

tration being disturbed, threw his
bat down in disgust, while those
who sympathized with the cricket
ers' predicament took consider
able pleasure in voicing their
views.
ON THE WHOLE it has been
a most enjoyable season (the
new season has already started
as far as we are concerned).
Cricket has come to stay, I hope,
on this campus. Our cricketers,
by their geniality on and off the
game, showed that cricket is the
gayest way of spending a week
end afternoon.
Victory and defeat are much
the same thing, quickly for got
ten. What matters is enjoying
the game and making it enjoy
able for others participating in
the game.
In April you could get even
money for Stanford to win the
championship, and although bad
luck robbed ihem of some excit
ing victories, they narrowly
missed drinking champagne from
the cup of victory in their very
first season in the California
Cricket League. Even then, th e
side made an otherwise ignoble
summer romantic and memorable
and brought cricket to the con
sciousness of the Stanford public.
OUR CRICKETERS always in
the game in the right spirit—if
you are bowling, then don't think
that the other fellow is your en
emy, but just think of getting
him out and the quicker the bet
ter; for you play the game to en
joy it, and you can't do it if you
are going to allow anything to
upset you.
Used to playing friendly
matches in a spirit of gay aban
don, the Stanford cricketers
found themselves playing in tour
nament matches in a "win at all
cost" atmosphere. A "boundary
bye" was cheered to an echo,
whereas previously it drew mild
appreciative applause. In this
type of Sunday afternoon cricket
one would think every team has
a right to expect a reasonable
total to chase.
THERE IS AN unwritten code
between teams, in this declaration
business. But only too often
things went'wrong between sides.
One side felt that the other didn't
play the game, and the total set
to win got larger and larger as
if to say we won't give you a
Ihing if we can help it.
For all that, the spectators
could never complain of a dullj
moment. Often they were more j
ruffled by events on the fringe ,

than in Iho middle.
There was the usual procession
on the field of amused onlookers
trying to make head or tail of
this strange spectacle of seeing
a fellow come bearing down from
one end, his hands whirling like
a windmill and then the striker
neatly deflecting it off his legs
and drawing applause for this
"foul ball."
THEN THERE was the
strange case of the groundsman
who tried to exert his nonexistant
authority to demand a premature
halt to the proceedings. Gruff
tones drifted across the field; the
opposing bowler raised dust as
he came to a halt, and our bats
man, complaining of his concen
tration being disturbed, threw his
bat down in disgust, while those
who sympathized with the cricket
ers' predicament took consider
able pleasure in voicing their
views.
