### CARRIE BRAND 
While working as 'political in
terns' on Capitol Hill as part of
the summer Stanford-in-Wash
ington program, two politically
minded seniors, Boh Ronka and
Dong Parker, became interested
in setting up a Democratic or
ganization at Stanford.
"After talking with leaders of
Young Democratic branches from
colleges and universities through
out the nation, ii became appar
ent that Stanford was the only
great university without any or
ganization of this kind. We de
cided then that it was high time
Stanford had a permanent, viable
forum for democratic political
opinion," Ronka stated.
At the beginning of the quarter,
an organizing committee met to
draw up proposals for the Con
stitution. to line up charter mem
bers, and to lay the groundwork
for the Stanford Young Dem

ocrats. Yesterday, a( its second
meeting, the SYD elected officers
and approved in its final form the
constitution that had been re
vised since the club's initial meet
ing last week.
RONKA, newly elected presi
dent. is a senior history major
from Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.
He served as chairman of the
Stanford delegation to the Model
United Nations last year, and is
currently International Students
Vice President of the lIR.
Vice President Doug Parker is
also a senior history major, and
is president of Delta Chi fratern
ity. Dave Stroud was elected to
the post of corresponding sec
retary, Carrie Brand lo recording
secretary, and Fred Altshuler to
that of treasurer.
MEMBERS of the SYD's new
executive committee expressed
the belief that this was a partic
ularly opportune time to start a
Young Democratic organization
because of the interest which will
be generated by crucial issues at
stake in the coming election.
"It is our intention to present
Democratic speakers ranging
from local aspirants to national
political figures and to give our
membership an opportunity to
participate personally in the polit
ical process through involvement
in campaigns and precinct work."
said Ronka. Ho added his belief
that the group had a "very firm
foundation because of the excep
tional quality of 72 charter mem
bers."
Now that it is established as
an active organization, the SYD
plans to launch a campus-wide
campaign for membership. All
prospective members, and all
members interested in heading
one of the seven standing com
mittees should contact either Bob
Ronka al DA 3-8683 or Doug
Parker at DA 3-8914.

808 RONKA, newly elected President of Stanford Young Dem- |
ocrats, compiles a list of the 72 charter members of the fledgling ;
organization.
While working as 'political in
terns' on Capitol Hill as part of
the summer Stanford-in-Wash
ington program, two politically
minded seniors, Boh Ronka and
Dong Parker, became interested
in setting up a Democratic or
ganization at Stanford.
"After talking with leaders of
Young Democratic branches from
colleges and universities through
out the nation, ii became appar
ent that Stanford was the only
great university without any or
ganization of this kind. We de
cided then that it was high time
Stanford had a permanent, viable
forum for democratic political
opinion," Ronka stated.
At the beginning of the quarter,
an organizing committee met to
draw up proposals for the Con
stitution. to line up charter mem
bers, and to lay the groundwork
for the Stanford Young Dem

ocrats. Yesterday, a( its second
meeting, the SYD elected officers
and approved in its final form the
constitution that had been re
vised since the club's initial meet
ing last week.
RONKA, newly elected presi
dent. is a senior history major
from Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.
He served as chairman of the
Stanford delegation to the Model
United Nations last year, and is
currently International Students
Vice President of the lIR.
Vice President Doug Parker is
also a senior history major, and
is president of Delta Chi fratern
ity. Dave Stroud was elected to
the post of corresponding sec
retary, Carrie Brand lo recording
secretary, and Fred Altshuler to
that of treasurer.
MEMBERS of the SYD's new
executive committee expressed
the belief that this was a partic
ularly opportune time to start a
Young Democratic organization
because of the interest which will
be generated by crucial issues at
stake in the coming election.
"It is our intention to present
Democratic speakers ranging
from local aspirants to national
political figures and to give our
membership an opportunity to
participate personally in the polit
ical process through involvement
in campaigns and precinct work."
said Ronka. Ho added his belief
that the group had a "very firm
foundation because of the excep
tional quality of 72 charter mem
bers."
