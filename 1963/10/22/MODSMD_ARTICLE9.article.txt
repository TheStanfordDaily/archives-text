# Excavation Starts For SRI Building
## 
### 
Excavation and grading for a
now engineering laboratory build
ing have commenced at Stanford
Research Institute.
The two-story. 38,500-square
foot building will bo of concrete
construction with exposed aggre
gate exterior and a flat roof and
will be located near the Laurel
Street side of the Institute prop
erty.
Air-conditioned office and la
boratory space for electronics
engineering groups will adjoin a
100-by-100-foot high bav-area for
final testing of large radio and
radar antennas. The roof of this
portion will be "transparent" to
radio signals.
Plans for the new building were
approved by the city of Menlo
Park September 13, and occu
pancy is expected by Juno 1. 196-1.
Construction costs are estimated
at $800,000.
The building will be on the site
of two former temporary build
ings which have been razed.
Later, the building occupied by
the Stanford Nursery School also
will he ra/.ed. and the school will
