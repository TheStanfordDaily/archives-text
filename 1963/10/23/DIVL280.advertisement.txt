The holy cathnlii (i.e. universal) church of Jesus Christ is a living body composed
of .ill spiritually born persons. The members are united by the Holy Spirit, and ( hri.-t
is the head of the church. This universal church is not limited to local groups or
emcompassed l>y walls. Christ, the Head, directs individual Christians, as members
of the body, to serve in local visible churches. However, one may not become a mem
ber of the true church by joining an organization or by signing a creed or roster. It
is not a question of affiliation with an ecclesiastical group, but whether one has been
joined by Christ. Memln'tship in the true church is assured by receipt of the in
dwelling Holy Spirit. "He who has the Son has life; lie who has not the Son has not
life." I John 5:1-. Just as it is impossible for an individual to he joined to the true
church by organizational means, so it is likewise impossible for man to fuse visible
churches to form the universal body ot Christ.
