# Dartmouth Faces Problems Raised By Discrimination
## 
### CATHY PIKE 
| Both the students and faculty
! at Dartmouth College have ex
! pressed concern over the discrimi
! nation on the basis of race, creed,
; or national origin in college or
ganizations.
The Intcrfraternity Council of
the College has <et up a Commit
tee on Discrimination to investi
gate the problem with regard to
! fraternity rush procedure in par
i ticular. According to chairman of
the committee, Walton N. Smith
'64. there is nothing now in the
rush regulations to cover the dis
crimination situation which has
occurred this fall at Dartmouth.
SMITH IS QIJOTKD in The
Dartmouth of October 7. 1963. as
stating that the proposed Amend
ment of the Committee is not do
! signed to 'get' any particular
house. It's object is not punitive
as much as it is corrective. It's
intention is mainly to clarify any
further situation."
The faculty of the College
stated its plans to release a reso-
I lution on discriminatory actions
within all campus organizations
in The Durtinouth of October 15,
! 1963: "The faculty spokesman
pointed out that this resolution
is not aimed particularly at the
fraternities, at the College, nor
at The Tabard, which was in
volved in the most serious inci
dents of racial discrimination this
fall. Rather, he said, the resolu
tion is an expression of the fac
ulty opinion regarding discrimi
nation at any time by any or
j gani/.ation which is a part of the
College."
