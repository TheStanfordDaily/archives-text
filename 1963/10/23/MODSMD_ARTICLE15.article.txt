# Sterling Appointments Raise Discussion
## 
### 
President Sterling has appointed the student members of
his advisory committees, and the long discussion on this sub
ject will come temporarily to a halt. This discussion to date
has involved disagreement over methods of appointment and
the number of students on these committees. The students
who have expressed this disagreement are quite cognizant
that these are the President's committees, and that student
representation on them is a "privilege and not a right," to
excerpt phrasing from a recent Trustee statement on another
subject.
It is because the students sense that representation on
these committees is a privilege that has been extended to
them, that they are so concerned with the method of appoint
ment. Last year's student representatives were appointed
solely from a slate submitted by the student body president,
and counted among their ranks several Wilson and Marshall
scholars, and a Rhodes scholar. This year's representatives
were selected from among applications to the Dean of Stu
dents and recommendations to the President from other
sources, as well as from the ASSU President's slate. The
LASSU resolution on the subject stated the case well: . . the
presentation of a student viewpoint can only claim validity
if these students are chosen in some democratic manner by
those whose viewpoint they are to represent; and . . . any
other method of selection is inconsistent with the aims of stu
dent participation on these committees."
The students have also concerned themselves with the
reduction of student membership on two of the most im
portant committees: Public Exercises and Student Affairs
and Services. Last year seven students sat on the Committee
on Public Exercises, although at the end of the year their
voting status on that committee was denied. This year there
are three students on the committee. Last year five students
served on the Student Affairs and Services Committee; this
year there will be three. Faculty members serving on these
committees have landed the students' contributions, and
some have said that some of the decisions made could not
have been made as well without the presence of the students.
This makes the reduction regrettable.
There is one further point that should perhaps be ques
tioned in reference to the President's announcement of his
appointments. Ten students were appointed to the President's
advisory committee. These students are those who are cur
rently holding the top campus positions of representation and
responsibility, and by nature of their positions, are appointed
to meet with the President to discuss issues of common con
cern. This advisory body is now considered as a committee,
and students from it are not appointed to other committees.
Removal of these students from the formal committee struc
ture leads to such possible instances of poor representative
ness as the losing candidate for ASSU President serving on
one of the two major committees, and the ASSU President
serving on neither.
This year the Student Affairs and Services Committee
will initiate sub-committees, and students will serve on these.
The Committee on Public Exercises will continue with exist
ing sub-committees and add some new ones, and students
will more than likely be serving on all. This seems an excel
lent method of increasing student representation and contri
bution.
The advances, and the very opportunity for students to
serve the University in this capacity, are greatly appreciated.
And because they are greatly appreciated the students have
and will continue to question and evaluate.
