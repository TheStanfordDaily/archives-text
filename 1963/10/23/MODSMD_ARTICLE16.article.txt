PEACE CORPS:
•UNASHAMED IDEALISM'
Editor, The Daily:
The Peace Corps, like all in
stitutions this side of heaven, is
not perfect. It has made mistakes
in selection in the past and, un
doubtedly, will make them in the
future. Indeed, it may even have
made thorn in the cases of the two
gentlemen who wrote recent let
ters to the Daily condemning
Peace Corps selection procedures.
But the statement that Mr. Cal
lison made in yesterday's Daily
that Peace Corps trainees are
washed out if they profess ideal
ism and that "the Peace Corps
has been organized and run by
men of a generation that grew
up before recent ferment of dedi
cated idealism among American
young people, and they don't un
derstand it very well" simply
isn't plugged into reality. This is
as sensible as saying that the Su
preme Court is controlled by the
John Birch Society.
As a former Peace Corps Wash
ington staff member, I can as
sure Mr. Callison that the dis
tinguished characteristic of the
P.C. Washington staffers — from
Sargent Shriver down to the ele
vator operator — is their un
ashamed, unrepenant idealism. It
has often been said that if you
scratch a Pcace Corps staff mem
ber in Washington that you will
find that he is a Volunteer at
heart. I recall that during the

first several months of the Peace
Corps that staff members often
worked until 11 p.m. and m id
night and part-time Saturdays
and Sundays, not because we
were being paid ovei'time (We
weren't.), but because of our dedi
cation to getting an idealistic con
cept off the launching pad.
With respect to the allegation
that P.C. trainees are washed out
because of professed idealism, one
can only assert quite flatly that
it is axiomatic among P.C. selec
tion officers that the best Volun
teers are the pragmatic idealists.
On the basis of visiting ten Peace
Corps training sites and of meet
ing about 700 Volunteers, I can
say unequivocally that if Volun
teers were selected out for ex
pressing a sense of idealism, there
wouldn't be much of a Peace
Corps, simply because most of
the trainees would have been
wtshed out. Or to put it another
way, if a person isn't an idealist
there isn't much room for him in
the Peace Corps. (Of course,
other qualities besides idealism
are necessary too.)
Finally, the best validation of
the Peace Corps selection proce
dures is the fact that less than
three per cent of the Volunteers
have come home from overseas
because of failure to adjust. Even
the wildest optimist among us
had not anticipated such a start
lingly low return rate.

young people, and they don't un
derstand it very well" simply
isn't plugged into reality. This is
as sensible as saying that the Su
preme Court is controlled by the
John Birch Society.
As a former Peace Corps Wash
ington staff member, I can as
sure Mr. Callison that the dis
tinguished characteristic of the
P.C. Washington staffers — from
Sargent Shriver down to the ele
vator operator — is their un
ashamed, unrepenant idealism. It
has often been said that if you
scratch a Pcace Corps staff mem
ber in Washington that you will
find that he is a Volunteer at
heart. I recall that during the

first several months of the Peace
Corps that staff members often
worked until 11 p.m. and m id
night and part-time Saturdays
and Sundays, not because we
were being paid ovei'time (We
weren't.), but because of our dedi
cation to getting an idealistic con
cept off the launching pad.
With respect to the allegation
that P.C. trainees are washed out
because of professed idealism, one
can only assert quite flatly that
it is axiomatic among P.C. selec
tion officers that the best Volun
teers are the pragmatic idealists.
On the basis of visiting ten Peace
Corps training sites and of meet
ing about 700 Volunteers, I can
say unequivocally that if Volun
teers were selected out for ex
pressing a sense of idealism, there
wouldn't be much of a Peace
Corps, simply because most of
the trainees would have been
wtshed out. Or to put it another
way, if a person isn't an idealist
there isn't much room for him in
the Peace Corps. (Of course,
other qualities besides idealism
are necessary too.)
Finally, the best validation of
the Peace Corps selection proce
dures is the fact that less than
three per cent of the Volunteers
have come home from overseas
because of failure to adjust. Even
the wildest optimist among us
had not anticipated such a start
lingly low return rate.

PEACE CORPS:
•UNASHAMED IDEALISM'
Editor, The Daily:
The Peace Corps, like all in
stitutions this side of heaven, is
not perfect. It has made mistakes
in selection in the past and, un
doubtedly, will make them in the
future. Indeed, it may even have
made thorn in the cases of the two
gentlemen who wrote recent let
ters to the Daily condemning
Peace Corps selection procedures.
But the statement that Mr. Cal
lison made in yesterday's Daily
that Peace Corps trainees are
washed out if they profess ideal
ism and that "the Peace Corps
has been organized and run by
men of a generation that grew
up before recent ferment of dedi
cated idealism among American
young people, and they don't un
derstand it very well" simply
isn't plugged into reality. This is
as sensible as saying that the Su
preme Court is controlled by the
John Birch Society.
