## 'Me Too' Republicanism A Thing of Yesteryear 
### 
Most of the time, for a genera
tion, Republican politicians have
felt themselves to he an insecure
minority, lucky if they could suc
ceed in whittling down "liberal"
proposals somewhat. — let alone
defeat Democratic plans alto
gether, or pass any legislation
of their own. Even during the
Eisenhower years, for the most
part, Republican leaders were
content if they managed to resist
some Democratic demands, or if
they split the difference with the
liberals.
But this attitude is giving away
to aggressive resolution. The con
trast between the brand of Re
publicanism that commenced in
1933 and the kind rising today
may be suggested by the
speeches, respectively, of Senator
Dirksen and Senator Goldwater
when, recently, the Senate ap
proved the bomb-testing treaty
with Soviet Russia. After initial
opposition. Senator Dirksen gave
way, uttered a sentimental and
almost obsequious oration, a n d
voted for the treaty. He was used
to such tactics. But Senator Gold
water fought the treaty to the
end. Even though only a small
band of senators stood with him.
here he spoke for the real ma
polity of Republican voters, who
are profoundly disturbed at the
concessions President Kennedy
has been making toward the Com
munist bloc.
"ME TOO." REPUBLICANISM
is becoming a thing of yesteryear.
This fact, more Ihan his vcmar
raige, accounts for Governor
Rockefeller's inability to secure
any strong support for the presi
dential nomination outside his
own state: for the mass of Re
publicans suspect that, if elected,
he would follow policies almost
indistinguishable from Mr. Ken
nedy's. Without any regular or
ganization to advance his candi
dacy, Sentator Goldwater seems
to be assured of enough Republi
can delegates, right now, to win
the nomination. More significant
still, surveys indicate that, were
the presidential election held to
morrow, Goldwater would be
about equal to Kennedy in
strength — attracting far more
votes than cotdd any other Re
publican. Governor Rockefeller,
to the contrary, wouldn't stand a
Chinaman's chance of beating
President Kennedy. Wanting a
winner, those Republicans who
initially held reservations about
nominating Mr. Goldwater are
shifting rapidly toward endorse
ment of the senator from Arizona.
Already, leading Democrats are
behaving as if Mr. Goldwater
were the Republican nominee. Ex
pecting the 1964 election to be

fought chiefly over foreign policy,
Senator Church, President Ken
nedy himself, and other Demo
cratic spokesmen have begun to
represent the Democrats as the
party of peace, and Mr. Goldwater
as a rash enthusiast who would
run the risk of catastrophic war.
YET THIS MAY he a mistaken
tactic. To be a champion of "ap
peasement" is an uneasy position
— for Americans remember what
came of appeasing Hitler. Senator
Goldwater argues that war can
be prevented only by bold and con
sistent foreign policy; he says
that the Soviet bloc respect only
strength and firmness. Public
opinion seems to be shifting to
ward the Goldwater attitude in
this, especially since Russian
troops remain in Cuba.
Perhaps Mr. Goldwater's prin
cipal charm for the reinvigorated
Republicans of the 'Sixties is his
forthright ness. In their eyes,
Senator Goldwater stands for the
policy recommended by a very
different sort of person — Dan
ton, the French revolutionary.
"Audacity, and again audacity,
and always audacity!" cried Dan
ton. At first, Mr. Goldwater
seemed audacious in opposing the
long-accepted timidity of Repub
lican leadership. Substantially, he
has won that fight; now he seems
audacious in setting himself
against Mr. Kennedy's television
and movie-magazine popularity.
Yet the American public relishes
audacious Westerners.

Rockefeller's inability to secure
any strong support for the presi

publicans suspect that, if elected,
he would follow policies almost
indistinguishable from Mr. Ken
nedy's. Without any regular or
ganization to advance his candi
dacy, Sentator Goldwater seems
to be assured of enough Republi
can delegates, right now, to win
the nomination. More significant
still, surveys indicate that, were
the presidential election held to
morrow, Goldwater would be
about equal to Kennedy in
strength — attracting far more
votes than cotdd any other Re
publican. Governor Rockefeller,
to the contrary, wouldn't stand a
Chinaman's chance of beating
President Kennedy. Wanting a
winner, those Republicans who
initially held reservations about
nominating Mr. Goldwater are
shifting rapidly toward endorse
ment of the senator from Arizona.
Already, leading Democrats are
behaving as if Mr. Goldwater
were the Republican nominee. Ex
pecting the 1964 election to be

fought chiefly over foreign policy,
Senator Church, President Ken
nedy himself, and other Demo
cratic spokesmen have begun to
represent the Democrats as the
party of peace, and Mr. Goldwater
as a rash enthusiast who would
run the risk of catastrophic war.
YET THIS MAY he a mistaken
tactic. To be a champion of "ap
peasement" is an uneasy position
— for Americans remember what
came of appeasing Hitler. Senator
Goldwater argues that war can
be prevented only by bold and con
sistent foreign policy; he says
that the Soviet bloc respect only
strength and firmness. Public
opinion seems to be shifting to
ward the Goldwater attitude in
this, especially since Russian
troops remain in Cuba.
Perhaps Mr. Goldwater's prin
cipal charm for the reinvigorated
Republicans of the 'Sixties is his
forthright ness. In their eyes,
Senator Goldwater stands for the
policy recommended by a very
different sort of person — Dan
ton, the French revolutionary.
"Audacity, and again audacity,
and always audacity!" cried Dan
ton. At first, Mr. Goldwater
seemed audacious in opposing the
long-accepted timidity of Repub

But this attitude is giving away
to aggressive resolution. The con
trast between the brand of Re
publicanism that commenced in
1933 and the kind rising today
may be suggested by the
speeches, respectively, of Senator
Dirksen and Senator Goldwater
when, recently, the Senate ap
proved the bomb-testing treaty
with Soviet Russia. After initial
opposition. Senator Dirksen gave
way, uttered a sentimental and
almost obsequious oration, a n d
voted for the treaty. He was used
to such tactics. But Senator Gold
water fought the treaty to the
end. Even though only a small
band of senators stood with him.
here he spoke for the real ma
polity of Republican voters, who
are profoundly disturbed at the
concessions President Kennedy
has been making toward the Com
munist bloc.
"ME TOO." REPUBLICANISM
is becoming a thing of yesteryear.
This fact, more Ihan his vcmar
raige, accounts for Governor
Rockefeller's inability to secure
any strong support for the presi
dential nomination outside his
own state: for the mass of Re
publicans suspect that, if elected,
he would follow policies almost
indistinguishable from Mr. Ken
nedy's. Without any regular or
ganization to advance his candi
dacy, Sentator Goldwater seems
to be assured of enough Republi
can delegates, right now, to win
the nomination. More significant
still, surveys indicate that, were
the presidential election held to
morrow, Goldwater would be
about equal to Kennedy in
strength — attracting far more
votes than cotdd any other Re
publican. Governor Rockefeller,
to the contrary, wouldn't stand a
Chinaman's chance of beating
President Kennedy. Wanting a
winner, those Republicans who
initially held reservations about
nominating Mr. Goldwater are
shifting rapidly toward endorse
ment of the senator from Arizona.
Already, leading Democrats are
behaving as if Mr. Goldwater
were the Republican nominee. Ex
pecting the 1964 election to be

fought chiefly over foreign policy,
Senator Church, President Ken
nedy himself, and other Demo
cratic spokesmen have begun to
represent the Democrats as the
party of peace, and Mr. Goldwater
as a rash enthusiast who would
run the risk of catastrophic war.
YET THIS MAY he a mistaken
tactic. To be a champion of "ap
peasement" is an uneasy position
— for Americans remember what
came of appeasing Hitler. Senator
Goldwater argues that war can
be prevented only by bold and con
sistent foreign policy; he says
that the Soviet bloc respect only
strength and firmness. Public
opinion seems to be shifting to
ward the Goldwater attitude in
this, especially since Russian
troops remain in Cuba.
Perhaps Mr. Goldwater's prin
cipal charm for the reinvigorated
Republicans of the 'Sixties is his
forthright ness. In their eyes,
Senator Goldwater stands for the
policy recommended by a very
different sort of person — Dan
ton, the French revolutionary.
"Audacity, and again audacity,
and always audacity!" cried Dan
ton. At first, Mr. Goldwater
seemed audacious in opposing the
long-accepted timidity of Repub
lican leadership. Substantially, he
has won that fight; now he seems
audacious in setting himself
against Mr. Kennedy's television
and movie-magazine popularity.
Yet the American public relishes
audacious Westerners.
