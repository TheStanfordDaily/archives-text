PEACE ( OKI'S
Editor, The Daily:
I think Mr. Steven Marx ought
to quit while he's ahead in his
feud with the Peace Corps. Any
more hair-splitting letters with
paranoid flavoring will surely
convince us all that the Corps
revealed great insight by elimi
nating him.
1 found in the letter from the
Peace Corps nothing which "cast
aspersions" on his character nor

neighbors: does he take up the
sword against them?
