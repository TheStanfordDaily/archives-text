HAPPINESS CAN'T BUY MONEY
With tuition costs steadily on the rise, more and more under
graduates are looking into the student loan plan. If you are
one such, you would do well to consider the case of Leonid
Sigafoos.
Leonid, the son of an unemployed bean gleaner in Straight
ened Circumstances, Montana, had his heart set on going to
college, but his father, alas, could not afford to send him.
Leonid applied for a Regents Scholarship, but his reading
speed, alas, was not very rapid —three words an hour —and
before he could finish flip first page of his exam, the Regents
had closed their briefcases crossly and gone home. Leonid then
applied for an athletic scholarship, but he had, alas, only a single
athletic skill—picking up beebees with his toes—and this, alas,
aroused only fleeting enthusiasm among the coaches.
And then—happy day!—Leonid learned of the student loan
plan: he could borrow money for his tuition and repay it in
easy installments after he left school!
Happily Leonid enrolled in the Southeastern Montana Col

lege of Lanolin and Restoration Drama and happily began a
co I lege career that grew happier year by year. Indeed, it be
came altogether ecstatic in his senior year because T.eonid met
a coed named Anna Livia PInrabelle with hair like beaten gold
and eyes like two sockets full of Lake Louise. Love gripped
them in its big moist, palm, and they were betrothed on St.
Crispin's Day.
Happily they made plans to be married immediately after
commencement—plans, alas, that were never to come to fruition
because Leonid, alas, learned that Anna Livia, like himself,
was in college on a student loan, which meant that he not only
had to repay his own loan after graduation but also Anna
Livia s and the job, alas, that was waiting for Leonid at the
Butte Otter Works simply did not pay enough, alas, to cover
both loans, plus rent and food and clothing and television
repairs.
Heavy hearted, Leonid and Anna Livia sat down and lit
Marlboro Cigarettes and tried to find an answer to their prob
lem—and, sure enough, they did! I do not know whether or
not Marlboro Cigarettes helped them find an answer; all 1 know
is that Marlboros taste good and look good and filter good, and
when the clouds gather and the world is black jis the pit from
pole to pole, it is a heap of comfort and satisfaction to be sure
that Marlboros will always provide the same easy pleasure,
the same unstinting tobacco flavor, in all times and clime* and
conditions. That's all 1 know.
Leonid and Anna Livia, I say, did find an answer—a very
simple one. If their student loans did not come due until they
left school, why then they just, wouldn't leave school! So after
receiving their bachelor's degrees, they re-enrolled and took
masters degrees. After that they took doctor's degrees- loads
and loads of them—until today liconid and Anna Livia, both
aged 87, both still in school, hold doctorates in Philosophy,
Humane letters, Jurisprudence, Veterinary Medicine, Civil
Engineering, Optometry, Wood pulp, and Dewey Decimals.
Their student loans, at the end of the last fiscal year,
amounted to a combined total of nineteen million dollars—a
sum which they probably would have found some difficulty in
repaying had not the Department of the Interior recently de
clared them a National Park. ® i« M m>.

You don't need a student loan—just a little loose change—
to grab a pack of smoking pleasure: Marlboros, sold in all
