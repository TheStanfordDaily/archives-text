# Indian Buck Club; Friend of Athletes
## 
### 
Tn 1934 three alumni observed
that many fine athletes admitted
1o Stanford could nm afford the
costs and had to forego a Stan
ford education. These gentlemen
formed an athletic booster organ
ization and named it the Buck
Club. Today the club claims 2890
men and women intensely inter
ested in intercolegtate athletics.
These people, 7~> per cent Stan
ford alumni, come in three sizes
twenty-five dollars a year and
up, fifty dollars a year and up,
and one hundred dollars a year
and up. One-seventh of the mem
bers are in the last category. All
the contributions, over 100,000
dollars each of the last three
years, are turned over to the Uni
versity for disbursement in tui
tion-size grants. Stanford Univer
sity supplying no funds strictly
for athletic prowess, makes clear
the important role the Buck Club
plays in our athletic program.
THIS GROUP makes it possible
to offer promising athletes
grants-in-aid according to their
financial need. These awards
range from $100 to $1400 and, in
many cases, a hashing job. Of
course these awards depend on
admission to Stanford.
Aside from the grants-in-aid
there are six endowed David Starr
Jordan Scholarships, although
this number varies slightly from
year to year. The requirements
for the Jordan Scholarships are
excellence in athletics and acad

| emics. The class of '07 garnered
six of these awards: three fool
ball players, two trackmen, and
one baseball player. The football
| players were Dave Lewis, Al Wil
bern, and Mike Hibler; the track
| men, Bud Walsh and Terry Erick
ison; and the baseball player Daro
i Quiring.
OVERALL ninety-four aihletes
are given financial help through
this program, eighty-three of
these are grants-in-aid. Fifty-five
grants go to the football team,
seventeen to the frosh gridders.
The other twenty-eight stipends
are spread out among basketball,
13; track, 2; baseball, X; tennis,
•4; and golf, 1.
Once admitted the requirements
for maintaining a scholarship are
a 2.0 gpa and an honest effort to
make first team. Injuries in no
way affect Hie scholarships.
