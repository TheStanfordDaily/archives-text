# Rhinelander Talks On Concept of God
## 
### 
Dr. Philip H. Rhinelander will
speak on Force and Righteous
ness this afternoon at 4:30 in the
small lounge at Tresidder.
Rhinelander will talk about the
problem of righteousness as an
ingredient in the idea of God.
"Can a God who represents mere
power of force he an object of
worship? If not, in what sense
and on what grounds can we
ascribe righteousness to God?
How does the answer to this ques
tion affect problems of morality
for the religions person?"
These questions will be an
swered at the lecture, and the
subject will be pursued through
examples drawn from the Bible,
classical writers, and modern
analysts.
