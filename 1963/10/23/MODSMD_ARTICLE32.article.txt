ford is cited in the November o
isue of Look Magazine (on sale
now). In the article "Why Father
Can't Do Johnny's Math," Dr.
Begle is listed as one of the key
researchers in the study of teach
ing methods of elementary and
high school mathematics.
Recognizing that a more effi
cient method of math teaching
needed to be developed, the Com
mission on Mathematics of th e
College Entrance Examination
Board decided to study current
curricula and suggest reforms.
Professor Begle directed th e
School Mathematics Study Group
—more than 200 teachers a n d
mathematicians- which produced
a series of textbooks for the sev
enth through twelfth grades.
Rather than concentrating on
problem solving "gimmicks," the
new teaching scheme enables the
student to understand the basic
principles of mathematics. Com
menting on the "New Math," Pro
fessor Begle says . .. "We are pro
viding our students with suffi
cient understanding of math so
that they will be able to attack
new problems as they meet them
in the future . . . Since we do not
know the answers to tomorrow's
problems, we cannot teach them."
