United Press International
An American owned freighter flying the Liberian flag was at- â€¢
tacked by an unidentified plane presumably Cuban 12 miles off
the coast of Cuba Tuesday. No casualties were reported from the :
hour-long gunfire attack on tho vessel J. Louis in the early morning
darkness, but the ship's captain radioed that the superstructure and
hull were damaged and that a resulting fire took two hours to bring
under control.
The State Department denounced the incident as an unprovoked j
attack on a vessel operating in international waters. It said the
attacking plane was presumed to be Cuban and that the government !
\v;is investigating to determine whether a protest should be made.
American jet fighters were sent out from Key West. Fla., when j
first word of the attack was received, but the State Department
said "activity had ceased" when they arrived. The planes are on
standing orders to retaliate against any attack over international
waters.
The attack also came less than 24 hours after Cuban Premier !
Fidel Castro appealed to the United States to lift its economic em
bargo against Cuba. In a Monday night radio-television speech, he
said such action was needed to help Cuba recover from hurricane
Flora's devastation.

flika told Selassie that peace talks with Morocco must be preceded
by withdrawal of Moroccan troops from Algerian soil.
