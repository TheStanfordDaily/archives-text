### BARRIE THORNE 
On November Ist and 2nd a year of debating
will get underway for Farm speakers when Stan
ford hosts the Northern California Forensies Asso
ciation Tournament. This year's squad will add to
a forensies tradition which began on the Stanford
campus in 1891. Since that time debaters have
argued a variety of topics and compiled an im
pressive record of achievement in competition
throughout the United States. Last year, for ex
ample, Stanford debaters placed among the lop
teams at Ihe Harvard and Northwestern tourna
ments, and a national poll of coaches rated Stan
ford among the top 7> debate squads in the
country.
MANY DISTINGUISHED alumni participated
in Stanford debating during their undergraduate
years. Lawrence A. Kimpton, Stanford Trustee
and former chancellor of the University of Chi
cago helped win Ihe 1929 Oxford debate by argu
ing proposition, "Resolved: That this Is the best
of all possible worlds." In the same year Vergil
K. Whitaker. spoke in support of A 1 Smith on the
question, "Hoover or Smith?" Other Stanford pro
fessors, including Prof. Thomas Bailey and Prof.
B. F. Johnston, were also once debate squad mem
bers.
In 1933 Fiederie O. Glover, executive assistant
to President Sterling, defended the proposition,
"Resolved: That a separate college for women
should be established at Stanford." Other alumni
of the Farm debating program include Frank
Church, U.S. Senator from Idaho; Robert R. Gros.
Vice President of Pacific Gas and Electric: Good
win Knight, former Governor of California; Abe
Mellinkoff, City Editor of the Chronicle: and Rob
ert McClintock. Ambassador to Argentina. In a
letter to President Sterling. Ambassador McClin
tock asserted that "the habits of thought, of men
tal discipline, and of the ability to speak easily
and surely on one's feet have been the single
greatest asset, in a professional sense, which 1
took with me from Stanford."
Continuing in this distinguished tradition, last

year's debating seniors included one Rhodes schol
ar, two Wood row Wilson scholars, one scholar-'
ship winner to Harvard Law School, and three (
Phi Beta Kappas.
