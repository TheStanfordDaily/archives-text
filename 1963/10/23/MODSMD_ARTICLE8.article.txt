# Coleman Discusses African Communism To Open 1963 Foreign Policy Institute
## 
### BILL MOORE Staff Editor 
Communism has shown "a surprising lack of influence in Africa,"
James Coleman, director of the African Studies Center at UCLA,
told the Tuesday Evening Series last night.
But Coleman, whose speech opened the llR's three-day Foreign
Policy Institute on "Emerging Africa," added: "What's so startling
about this is that there are a cluster of things that would seem to

give the Sino-Soviets a surprise
ing advantage."
Among them:
• Communism's highly popu
lar anti-imperialist propaganda.
• The widespread patterning of
African parties after Communist
party organization.
• The popularity of Democratic j
centrism and Marxism.
Why. then, the lack of influ- j
etice?
"It's simply because the Afri-!
cans are intensely nationalistic
now and hate to have any outside
meddling in their affairs," ex-:
plained Coleman.
Besirles, he continued, many of
the continent's leaders claim the j
Communist theory of class con
flict isn't, applicable to their coun-!
tries — because, they say, there's
no class conflict.
Coleman pointed out that t he j
only type of socialism popular in :
Africa is "racial or nationalistic I
socialism," not the Communist i
type.
"Africa has recently seen th e j
triumph of its sovereignty over!
imperialism," said Coleman. "No j
langer is imperialism tolerated.
There is a new feeling of impor-'
tance."
And, as an example of this, he
cited Africa's increasing impact i
on the UN—where, in 1946. it
started with 6 per cent of the
representation and today has 30'
per cent.
The big problem presently con
fronting most African nations is.
as Coleman put it,"the p o we r
vacu urn."
"Most of these states were born
without any army, civil service or
police force," he explained. "They |
are in remarkably weak posi
tions."
Coleman also noted that the
American Negro's attitude to
ward his African ancestors has i

♦
changed radically since the recent
emergence of the independent
countries.
"There had been an historic
avoidance and aversion toward
I hem by the American Negroes.
The latter had rejected them as
; primitive. . . . But now, according
i to polls, U.S. Negroes have begun
to take pride in them and have
i associated themselves with them."
