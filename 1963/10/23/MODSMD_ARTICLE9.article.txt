# Gallery Presents 'Disturbing' Show
## 
### LINDA FREIDEL 
Last Tuesday the Stanford Art
Gallery opened with an exhibition
of eleven sculptures selected from
the Arts of Southern California
and of eight paintings by William
J. Bowman.
OF THK ELEVEN sculptures
the most disturbing work is a
spray-can painted clay sculpture
by John Mason. It is physically
and mentally painful. One can
see that to touch it would leave
hands scraped â€” the skin and
sense of touch is repulsed by the
thought of jumbled unpleasant
surfaces, like t hoses of cinder
blocks fermenting and multiply
ing. The jarring spray-can color
hurts the eyes.
From this physical and visual
shock, and also from the demon
stration that clay is not so humble
that it cannot be a sculptural ma
terial, one conceives that the
sculptor is anbry with pat state
ment, with what is solved and
repeated "a la mode" in sculp
ture today. This work is like the
complexity of a wondering and
doubting mind that has forced
itself to being committed to hon
est uncertainty.
A WORK OF ART must not
necessarily be disturbing to be
good, however. The cast concrete
"Light Catcher" by Emile La/are
vich is playful, bouncing light
over loops and into crevices and
hollows. The form of the work
is an extention of the lumpy sur
face into mass and space.
The paintings by William Bow
man are light hearted construc
tions of nails and upholstery
lacks, colored strings and painted
wood. They remind one of tinker
toys and the sound of music
boxes. In "Generation" tiny nails,
brightly painted, are sent out into
the darkness.
"Secret Heart II" concentrates
on a small box dug in the middle
of a large black canvas. Glowing
within Ihe box are nails painted
orange, yellow and pink, and just
above the box is its cover, i h e
pink nails of the underside barely
showing as the cover presses
against the canvas. One feels
that something precious and fra
gile has just been discovered. This
feeling, of kaleidoscope and bub
ble, is sustained through most of
Ihe paintings in the exhibit.
