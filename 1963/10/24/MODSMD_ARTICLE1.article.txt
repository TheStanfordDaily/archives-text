## 
### ALLAN C. ANDERSON Contributing Editor 
At a news conference in S a n
Francisco yesterday, Governor
Nelson A. Rockefeller strongly
criticized the views of Senator
Harry Goldwater and the policies
of the Kennedy Administration.
He also announced that he would
make known his intentions 112 or
the coming presidential campaign
"early next month."
Although he appeared some
what tired, the governor answered
questions from tlie press with
skill and confidence. The atmos
phere was quite relaxed, and the
governor frequently joked with
the newsmen present. Ho re
sponded to queries ranging in sub

jeet from his decent divorce and j
remarriage on his political career,
to the reasons for the New York
Yankees' World Series defeat at ]
the hands of the Los Angeles [
Dodgers.
GOVERNOR ROCKEFELLER
began the session with a reitera
tion of his criticisms of Senator
Goldwater's ideas concerning the
United Nations.
Although Goldwater has denied
that he has ever advocated this
country's unqualified withdrawal
from the U.N., the governor
charged that the senator has in
deed taken this position. He pre
sented quotations from some of
Goldwater's past speeches which
he felt supported this conclusion.
The governor has stated that

j such views as these "are not in
: the best interests of the country."
Rockefeller also criticized Gold
| water's views on the subject of
1 foreign aid.
The New York governor took
every opportunity to voice hi s
criticisms of the Kennedy ad
ministration. He charged the
president's civil rights program
has not fulfilled the promises of
the 1960 platform of the Demo
cratic Party. Rockefeller 112 u r
ther charged that Kennedy "only
acted on civil right when massive
demonstrations forced his hand."
He also accused Attorney-General
Robert Kennedy of trying to
"water down the strong civil
right bill" presently before Con
gres. "The parties," Rockefeller

concluded, "ought to cany out
their pledges on civil rights."
The governor also charged that
President Kennedy has failed to
keep his 1%0 promises about in
creasing the country's economic
growth. Kennedy, he remarked,
"hasn't displayed the 'vigah' hei
said he would" in getting the
country moving again. Rockefel-1
ler continued, "A tax cut should
have been made two years ago.
It's got to go through now."
GOVERNOR ROCKEFELLER
stated he will continue to urge
debate between the different fac
tions of the Republican Party.
Such a debate, he said would re
sult in a greater unity in th e
party and an increase in public
interest in politics. He concluded, I

"l don't think it will be devisive;
it will help bring unity."
Discussing Republican chances
of defeating President Kennedy
in the 1964 election, Rockefeller
remarked, "1 think that the Demo
crats are whistling in the dark
trying to keep their confidence
up" when they say it will be im
possible to beat Mr. Kennedy. As
to his own chances for the Repub
lican nomination, the governor
admitted, "1 think the underdog
title is a fair one." He added,
however, that "you can't run for
cover just because the polls run
against you."
At the conclusion of the press
conference a crowd of young
people gathered around the gov
ernor. He willingly answered

their questions, signed auto
graphs for them, and posed for
pictures for student publications.
ALTHOUGH he has no definite
plans for visiting Stanford in the
near future, Governor Rocke
feller informed the Daily that he
has a great interest in speaking
to university gatherings.
Later in the day Governor
Rockefeller spoke at a luncheon
of the League of California Cit
izens. He pointed out the need of
increasing the effectiveness of
local government within the fed
eral system. He cited the improve
ments which have taken place
in city government in New York
since he has been governor of that
state. He also used the opportun
ity to state one of his "basic dis-

I agreements with President Ken-
I nedy." Ho said that Kennedy has
launched a "drive to centralize*
! government power in Washing
j ton." Continuing his discussion of
i the problems of local government,
' the governor declared: "The solu
! tion — the basic solution - lies
i in strengthening the federal-state
! system of shared sovereignty be
tween the federal government and
the state governments, and the
states giving more home r u 1 e
powers to the local governments
so that they can meet their prob
lems at the home level."
After his speech and a recep
tion for California Republicans,
Governor Rockefeller flew to Los
Angeles to continue his western
speaking tour.

ALTHOUGH he has no definite
plans for visiting Stanford in the
near future, Governor Rocke
feller informed the Daily that he
has a great interest in speaking
to university gatherings.
Later in the day Governor
Rockefeller spoke at a luncheon
of the League of California Cit
izens. He pointed out the need of
increasing the effectiveness of
local government within the fed
eral system. He cited the improve
ments which have taken place
in city government in New York
since he has been governor of that
state. He also used the opportun
ity to state one of his "basic dis-

I agreements with President Ken-
I nedy." Ho said that Kennedy has
launched a "drive to centralize*
! government power in Washing
j ton." Continuing his discussion of
i the problems of local government,
' the governor declared: "The solu
! tion — the basic solution - lies
i in strengthening the federal-state
! system of shared sovereignty be
tween the federal government and
the state governments, and the
states giving more home r u 1 e
powers to the local governments
so that they can meet their prob
lems at the home level."
After his speech and a recep
tion for California Republicans,
Governor Rockefeller flew to Los
Angeles to continue his western
speaking tour.
At a news conference in S a n
Francisco yesterday, Governor
Nelson A. Rockefeller strongly
criticized the views of Senator
Harry Goldwater and the policies
of the Kennedy Administration.
He also announced that he would
make known his intentions 112 or
the coming presidential campaign
"early next month."
Although he appeared some
what tired, the governor answered
questions from tlie press with
skill and confidence. The atmos
phere was quite relaxed, and the
governor frequently joked with
the newsmen present. Ho re
sponded to queries ranging in sub

jeet from his decent divorce and j
remarriage on his political career,
to the reasons for the New York
Yankees' World Series defeat at ]
the hands of the Los Angeles [
Dodgers.
GOVERNOR ROCKEFELLER
began the session with a reitera
tion of his criticisms of Senator
Goldwater's ideas concerning the
United Nations.
Although Goldwater has denied
that he has ever advocated this
country's unqualified withdrawal
from the U.N., the governor
charged that the senator has in
deed taken this position. He pre
sented quotations from some of
Goldwater's past speeches which
he felt supported this conclusion.
The governor has stated that

j such views as these "are not in
: the best interests of the country."
Rockefeller also criticized Gold
| water's views on the subject of
1 foreign aid.
The New York governor took
every opportunity to voice hi s
criticisms of the Kennedy ad
ministration. He charged the
president's civil rights program
has not fulfilled the promises of
the 1960 platform of the Demo
cratic Party. Rockefeller 112 u r
ther charged that Kennedy "only
acted on civil right when massive
demonstrations forced his hand."
He also accused Attorney-General
Robert Kennedy of trying to
"water down the strong civil
right bill" presently before Con
gres. "The parties," Rockefeller

concluded, "ought to cany out
their pledges on civil rights."
The governor also charged that
President Kennedy has failed to
keep his 1%0 promises about in
creasing the country's economic
growth. Kennedy, he remarked,
"hasn't displayed the 'vigah' hei
said he would" in getting the
country moving again. Rockefel-1
ler continued, "A tax cut should
have been made two years ago.
It's got to go through now."
GOVERNOR ROCKEFELLER
stated he will continue to urge
debate between the different fac
tions of the Republican Party.
Such a debate, he said would re
sult in a greater unity in th e
party and an increase in public
interest in politics. He concluded, I

"l don't think it will be devisive;
it will help bring unity."
Discussing Republican chances
of defeating President Kennedy
in the 1964 election, Rockefeller
remarked, "1 think that the Demo
crats are whistling in the dark
trying to keep their confidence
up" when they say it will be im
possible to beat Mr. Kennedy. As
to his own chances for the Repub
lican nomination, the governor
admitted, "1 think the underdog
title is a fair one." He added,
however, that "you can't run for
cover just because the polls run
against you."
At the conclusion of the press
conference a crowd of young
people gathered around the gov
ernor. He willingly answered

their questions, signed auto
graphs for them, and posed for
pictures for student publications.

said he would" in getting the
country moving again. Rockefel-1
ler continued, "A tax cut should
have been made two years ago.
It's got to go through now."
GOVERNOR ROCKEFELLER
stated he will continue to urge
debate between the different fac
tions of the Republican Party.
Such a debate, he said would re
sult in a greater unity in th e
party and an increase in public
interest in politics. He concluded, I

"l don't think it will be devisive;
it will help bring unity."
Discussing Republican chances
of defeating President Kennedy
in the 1964 election, Rockefeller
remarked, "1 think that the Demo
crats are whistling in the dark
trying to keep their confidence
up" when they say it will be im
possible to beat Mr. Kennedy. As
to his own chances for the Repub
lican nomination, the governor
admitted, "1 think the underdog
title is a fair one." He added,
however, that "you can't run for
cover just because the polls run
against you."
At the conclusion of the press
conference a crowd of young
people gathered around the gov
ernor. He willingly answered

their questions, signed auto
graphs for them, and posed for
pictures for student publications.
ALTHOUGH he has no definite
plans for visiting Stanford in the
near future, Governor Rocke
feller informed the Daily that he
has a great interest in speaking
to university gatherings.
Later in the day Governor
Rockefeller spoke at a luncheon
of the League of California Cit
izens. He pointed out the need of
increasing the effectiveness of
local government within the fed
eral system. He cited the improve
ments which have taken place
in city government in New York
since he has been governor of that
state. He also used the opportun
ity to state one of his "basic dis-

I agreements with President Ken-
I nedy." Ho said that Kennedy has
launched a "drive to centralize*
! government power in Washing
j ton." Continuing his discussion of
i the problems of local government,
' the governor declared: "The solu
! tion — the basic solution - lies
i in strengthening the federal-state
! system of shared sovereignty be
tween the federal government and
the state governments, and the
states giving more home r u 1 e
powers to the local governments
so that they can meet their prob
lems at the home level."
After his speech and a recep
tion for California Republicans,
Governor Rockefeller flew to Los
Angeles to continue his western
speaking tour.
At a news conference in S a n
Francisco yesterday, Governor
Nelson A. Rockefeller strongly
criticized the views of Senator
Harry Goldwater and the policies
of the Kennedy Administration.
He also announced that he would
make known his intentions 112 or
the coming presidential campaign
"early next month."
Although he appeared some
what tired, the governor answered
questions from tlie press with
skill and confidence. The atmos
phere was quite relaxed, and the
governor frequently joked with
the newsmen present. Ho re
sponded to queries ranging in sub

jeet from his decent divorce and j
remarriage on his political career,
to the reasons for the New York
Yankees' World Series defeat at ]
the hands of the Los Angeles [
Dodgers.
GOVERNOR ROCKEFELLER
began the session with a reitera
tion of his criticisms of Senator
Goldwater's ideas concerning the
United Nations.
Although Goldwater has denied
that he has ever advocated this
country's unqualified withdrawal
from the U.N., the governor
charged that the senator has in
deed taken this position. He pre
sented quotations from some of
Goldwater's past speeches which
he felt supported this conclusion.
The governor has stated that

j such views as these "are not in
: the best interests of the country."
Rockefeller also criticized Gold
| water's views on the subject of
1 foreign aid.
The New York governor took
every opportunity to voice hi s
criticisms of the Kennedy ad
ministration. He charged the
president's civil rights program
has not fulfilled the promises of
the 1960 platform of the Demo
cratic Party. Rockefeller 112 u r
ther charged that Kennedy "only
acted on civil right when massive
demonstrations forced his hand."
He also accused Attorney-General
Robert Kennedy of trying to
"water down the strong civil
right bill" presently before Con
gres. "The parties," Rockefeller

concluded, "ought to cany out
their pledges on civil rights."
The governor also charged that
President Kennedy has failed to
keep his 1%0 promises about in
creasing the country's economic
growth. Kennedy, he remarked,
"hasn't displayed the 'vigah' hei
said he would" in getting the
country moving again. Rockefel-1
