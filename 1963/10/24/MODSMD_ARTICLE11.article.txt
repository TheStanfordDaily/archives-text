# Fredericks Lauds African Progress Toward Stability
## 
### ANN TODD 
Approaching the subject of "Nations in the Making in Africa,"
J. Wayne Fredericks, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Afri
can Affiairs, was enthusiastic about the progress made toward sta
bility in each of the African nations except those of South Africa.
Fredericks especially attacked the Republic of South Africa which

he called "a world unto itself, a* 1
country which has set itself
against the major trends in Africa ,
and the world."
FREDERICKS pointed out that
America's own racial problems
have made it difficult for the
stale department to take an effec
tive stand against the doctrine of!
apartheid and"the building of a
society in which the whites can
maintain 19th century privileges
while the majority of the popula
tion is denied the normal rights
of general citizenship," but that
we still recognize this system as
being objectional to the equal dig
nity of men.
Elaborating on the influence ra
cial problems in the South have
had on the American image in
Africa, Fredericks said that most
educated African leaders compre
hend and appreciate the problems
connected with progress in the
field of civil rights. Unfortu
nately, the African masses, of
I which approximately 15 per cent
per country are literate, do not
see this side of the problem but
rather sec merely such things as
the picture of the Birmingham
policeman turning loose his dog
on a Negro.
Fredericks moved from the ra
cial problem to that of govern
ment among the 28 new African
.states. He pointed out, that the
i leaders of these new countries
1 are young, and that "Africa is
still a revolutionary continent,
whose attitudes are being shaped
; by young people fresh from uni
versity life."
THESE leaders. Fredericks con
tinued, face the problem of the
: instability of government which
I results from frustration of the 1
masses due to present social and
economic conditions. The people
are anxious to see immediate
progress. These nations have po
j tential, however, the leaders had
so little to start with, that imme
diate significant progress is im
j possible.
Pr ogress has been made,
pointed out Fredericks, but self-
I help measures have not proved
I sufficient. Outside aid. especially
1 European, has proved vital. The
i United States contribution has
been considerably smaller so far,
, yet plans for greater aid are now
being realized.
On the question of African
unity, Fredericks ended with the
hope that education would prove
the answer to overcoming local
tribal bonds and would allow for
an ultimately united Africa, as
I envisioned by the newly formed
I Organization on African Unity,
i The State Department believes
that the organization, made up
of Ihe new African nations, rep
resents "an impressive and re
alistic approach to the problem
of African unity."
United States aid and service in
Africa, concluded Fredericks, is
aiming toward the time when
Africa will stand securely, strong
in peace, freedom, and social and
economic stabilitv.

THESE leaders. Fredericks con
tinued, face the problem of the
: instability of government which
I results from frustration of the 1
masses due to present social and
economic conditions. The people
are anxious to see immediate
progress. These nations have po
j tential, however, the leaders had
so little to start with, that imme
diate significant progress is im
j possible.
Pr ogress has been made,
pointed out Fredericks, but self-
I help measures have not proved
I sufficient. Outside aid. especially
1 European, has proved vital. The
i United States contribution has
been considerably smaller so far,
, yet plans for greater aid are now
being realized.
On the question of African
unity, Fredericks ended with the
hope that education would prove
the answer to overcoming local
tribal bonds and would allow for
an ultimately united Africa, as
I envisioned by the newly formed
I Organization on African Unity,
i The State Department believes
that the organization, made up
of Ihe new African nations, rep
resents "an impressive and re
alistic approach to the problem
of African unity."
United States aid and service in
Africa, concluded Fredericks, is
aiming toward the time when
Africa will stand securely, strong
in peace, freedom, and social and
economic stabilitv.
Approaching the subject of "Nations in the Making in Africa,"
J. Wayne Fredericks, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Afri
can Affiairs, was enthusiastic about the progress made toward sta
bility in each of the African nations except those of South Africa.
Fredericks especially attacked the Republic of South Africa which

he called "a world unto itself, a* 1
country which has set itself
against the major trends in Africa ,
and the world."
FREDERICKS pointed out that
America's own racial problems
have made it difficult for the
stale department to take an effec
tive stand against the doctrine of!
apartheid and"the building of a
society in which the whites can
maintain 19th century privileges
while the majority of the popula
tion is denied the normal rights
of general citizenship," but that
we still recognize this system as
being objectional to the equal dig
nity of men.
Elaborating on the influence ra
cial problems in the South have
had on the American image in
Africa, Fredericks said that most
educated African leaders compre
hend and appreciate the problems
connected with progress in the
field of civil rights. Unfortu
nately, the African masses, of
I which approximately 15 per cent
per country are literate, do not
see this side of the problem but
rather sec merely such things as
the picture of the Birmingham
policeman turning loose his dog
on a Negro.
Fredericks moved from the ra
cial problem to that of govern
ment among the 28 new African
.states. He pointed out, that the
i leaders of these new countries
1 are young, and that "Africa is
still a revolutionary continent,
whose attitudes are being shaped
; by young people fresh from uni
versity life."
