# Anniversary Marks Critical Time for UN
## 
### 
Today is United Nations Day. Each anniversary of the
international organization raises the question of whether it
exists in spite of international political trends or because of
them. The United Nations has its critics, but fewer and fewer
of them see the organization doomed to the ineffectiveness
of the League of Nations, which found it could only talk and
break into committees as Ethiopia was being over-run.
It is because of the impact of UN action that the organiza
tion must consider some critical questions in the near future
Recent l T \ T decisions have brought about the need for more
precise definition of the role of the United Nations in the
internal affairs of a country, and how one defines a problem
as entirely internal.
The UN must decide whether its ultimate goal is to unite
all nations or some nations, and to offer membership accord
ingly. The question of Chinese representation is one that
will continue to demand confrontation on philosophical
grounds.
For all questions that arise within the vast area of supra
national political action, however, the greatest areas of United
Nations concern may well be considered those in social and
humanitarian realms. The world population explosion, the
curing and preventing of disease, the feeding and sheltering
of the human race are man's problems to be dealt with by
all men. From international labor problems to medical re
search, the United Nations has stepped into areas that could
only be handled by a body such as itself, and its success in
these areas is unchallenged.
The anniversary of an international organization existing
in the mid-twentieth century is an event to be heralded. The
United Nations is young in years, and those organizational
problems confronting it will be solved. The United Nations
is old when one considers the decisions it has faced and those
it is yet to face, and when one considers the life-span of its
predecessor, and this is the wondrous thing.
