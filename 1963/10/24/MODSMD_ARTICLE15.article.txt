• QUAD TRADITION OUT?
Editor, The Daily:
The theme of the 1964 Stanford
Quad is focused on Stanford tra
ditions in our high academic
standing, in sports, in Big Game,
in the cultural atmosphere, and in
student publications. It is ironic
that just as the book has started
to be assembled, one of the older
traditions associated with it is
being threatened.
A major object of the Quad is
to furnish students with a refer
ence manual of student pictures.
What better way is there of find
ing out what that blind date looks
like than to refer to the past
Quads and Froshbooks?
With this object in mind, after
Fall Quarter registration each
year, the Quad hires a photog
rapher to come to campus and
take student portraits. It is felt
that having the facilities here on
campus makes it much easier
(and cheaper) for students to
have their pictures taken. The
result, as can be seen in past
Quads, is a high quality portrait
of a uniform nature in relation
to others and of a small expense
which makes the Quad senior and
residence sections some of the
best in the country.
It has even become a tradit ion
for residences, particularly th e
men's, to compete in trying to get
the best percentage of representa
tion from their houses. However,
this is not the case this year. For
some reason, this is the year that
a certain number of students have
decided to revolt against some
thing that has been done longer
than any of them have been on
campus. (Not all students feel
this way, the women's residences
have had a high turn out already,
and more seniors have had their
pictures taken this year than ever
before in the history of the
Quad.)
The complaints seem to center
around three questions: 1) Why
should the pictures betaken over
every year?, 2) Why should the
student pay $2.25 when it appears
that he gets nothing in return?,
3) Why is one particular photog
rapher chosen each year?
Have you looked at your high
school yearbook recently? How
closely does that picture, taken
at most four years ago, resemble
the way you look now? Even a
better comparison can be seen by
looking at your yearbooks from
your freshman and senior years.
It should be fairly evident why
you are asked to have a new pic

ture each year. The relatively
small cost ($2.25 a year, $9.00 for
the four undergraduate years) is
worth the better representation
of you in the book.
Without going deeply into the
economics involved, the $2,25 is
a minimum charge and very
necessary to the Quad. The Quad
is entirely a self-supporting, non
profit organization, and must get
funds from every source it can
without wringing any one of them
dry. Quads are sold for $7.00
($B.OO after February 1), but the
cost per book for printing is over
$10.00. On top of this, the Quad
has transferred an extremely
large sum to the university to pay
for its share of the new Storke
Student Publications Building.
This extra money, both for the
books and for the building, has to
come from somewhere.
Campus organizations and liv
ing group organizations are
charged for the space Ihey re
ceive and even the Athletic De
partment pays for a percentage
of the coverage of sports, but
this is still far below the income
needed to break even. The $2.25
pays: 11 for the photographer's
and secretary's salaries; 2) for
the film, film processing, and
printing; 3) for mailing proofs
and secretarial work in process
ing choices; 4) (if. indeed, there
is any left after the first three ex
penses) for the portrait space in
the book.
Kieth Cole Studios has been the
photographer for Stanford at
least since 1956. By no means
does he have a monopoly, for
each year, the staff accepts bids
and the contract is awarded to
the studio that offers the best
quality and most savings to the
Quad and the student. It is aca
demic, at the present time, that
Mr. Cole offers the best of these.
It was his studios, and in fact Mr.
Cole himself, who pioneered the
senior color portraits in 1956
which led to Stanford having the
first annual in the nation with
a full color senior section.
While it may be "unfair" to
charge the students for portraits,
a yearbook is primarily a picture
book, and it is the only way the
Quad can afford a high quality
book with uniform pictures. Simi
larly, it cannot be a picture book
without pictures. It is sincerely
hoped that the "revolt" against
the Quad is over if indeed it ever
started.
