JACQUES CALMA CONTINUES
Editor, The Daily:
The student challenging my
last letter may have created some
misunderstanding. I do not: claim
or believe that "the interests of
the students and administration
are in complete opposition."
Neither do I recommend creating
a "new norm for all of us" to
guide the followers of the old
norm. Much to the contrary. Nor
do I think that the claim that the
administration might fail to pre
vent a murder proves its disinter
est in any moral behavior. If you
murdered someone, the Stanford
Police would co-operate in appre
hending you, you would be kicked
out of school, and I would sup
port the administration. Let's not
be stupid, even on purpose.
Rather than dwelling on these
misunderstandings, let's continue
the discussion of Social Regula
tions and their function. Some of
the most questionable regulations
are the compulsory sign-outs and
hours for juniors and seniors. Be
cause the sign-out is semi-public,
it is an invasion of privacy and
an invitation to dishonesty. A
girl should not be punished be
cause she forgets or refuses to
sign out; she should use the sign
out only when she wants to. On
these occasions she could indicate
the time such that, if she had not
returned to or notified her dorm
by then, the universily should be
gin looking for her. Regulations
are not necessary during the day;
they should not be always neces
sary at night.
What are the reasons for com
pulsory sign outs and hours? Of
the five purposes for Social Regu
lations advanced in this year's
booklet, two apply logically to
sign-outs. The first is that sign
ing out enables ". . . Ihe Univer
sity to contact a woman in case
of an emergency." Common sense
indicates that the probability that
the University will need to con
tact a girl late on a night she's
out is infinitesimal. The prob
ability is no greater for girls than
for boys, who do not have .sign
outs.
Another reason for sign-outs
and hours is what the booklet
laconically calls "safety." The
idea is that if a girl isn't back
by a certain hour, she may be in
danger and the police can be sent
to save her. But how does this
work in practice? Suppose a jun
ior girl signs out for the Roxy
Theater at 7 p.m. and doesn't re
turn by 3 a.m. The police might
be able to help her — assuming
she needs and wants help — hut
where are they going to go? She's
not at the theater, which closed
at one. Furthermore, if she were
at the movie — or the play, dance,
lecture, concert, night, club, or
restaurant she's apt to sign out
for — she's not in danger. A n d
again, all things considered, men
are subject to as much danger as
women. Why have rules for the
women but not for the men? The
answer is always the same: the
Double Standard.
When the Social Regulators
talk about "safety," what do they
have in mind? Danger of preg
nancy? If you're in danger of be
coming pregnant, the Social Regu
lations aren't going to help you.
And what about danger of attack?
If a girl does feel in danger, she
should make maximal use of the
voluntary, flexible sign outs and
hours I recommended above. As
shown in the Roxy Theater ex

ample, Ihe present Regulations
do not provide effective protec
tion against attack. If a girl is
really attacked, successfully or
not, she should inform the police.
This is difficult for her. But if a
few girls had the social bravery
to protest properly, the problem
would be solved for everyone.
The word would get around, and
attacks would cease. Even the un
scrupulous can learn.
A liberal overnight policy is
the natural corollary to the op
tional sign-out. Why put up with
the insulting nonsense about
"adult" chaperones, committee
approval, and window locks? The
unscrupulous got around these
rules. The problem, as I under
stand it from last year's Social
Regulations Committee, is that a
man may coerce a girl by taking
her to a place with inadequate
facilities or by isolating himself
with her in a room. If you don't
trust a guy, don't go with him.
And if you're on a group over
night and a man won't leave your
room, call the people next door,
or the police, or the Dean of Men
. . . collect.

FLICKS
Editor, The Daily:
Concerning M. O. Freeman's
denunciation of student behavior
at the flicks; although I didn't
attend "Barabbas" I can't help
thinking Ihat it couldn't have got
ten any more derision than it de
served. I have never seen a more
"abominible display of sacrilige
and resecration," not to mention
cross commercialism than this
movie, although I expect the new
movie coming out soon on the
life of Christ i entitled "The Great
est Show on Earth," I think) with
John Wayne as Christ and Eliza
beth Taylor as the Virgin Mary,
will surpass even "Barabbas."
—TOM SMITH
Editor, The Daily:
While it. seems that the Daily
supports the actions, or'at least
heralds the dot ions of one Svelton
Suetos C6l) who secured a niche
in the Stanford Sunday Flick Hall
of Eame at the showing of Ben
Hur in his senior year at the cru
cifixion, I feci that such a letter
is highly immature and just plain
silly. My fiancee and I were at
the flicks that night sitting in
the fourteenth row when Suetos
lunched over the balcony. At
first 1 chuckled, thinking that per
haps this was some sort of special
effect produced by the picture,
but in time I realized what had
happened. I think that people
that go in for this sort of thing,
specifically both Mr. Suetos and
Mr. Steinhart should have their
head examined. My date was sure
plenty mad and so was I and she
felt pretty d--- stupid walking
into Branner looking like a Jack
son Pollack painting. How about
it? Is theLuft really Wehing with
Freiheit?

INACCURACY
Editor, The Daily:
Due to your inaccurate report
ing you have credited two goals
in the San Francisco State game
to Don Griffith when they were
actually scored by Ed Clark. As
Mr. Clark is a co-captain of the
team, he surely deserves an apol
ogy and a retraction.
