# OUR MAN ON THE FARM Stanford's Bucketeers Seek Big Six Title Repeat
## Justin Beck 
### 
In six weeks, give or take a few days, the 1963-64 basketball sea
son opens with Stanford once again in ils annual quest of the Big
Six crown.
Tribe rooters are going to find this year's setting a little different
from last year's. Tom Dose, a fixture at center the past two seasons,
is back, as is most of his supporting cast. And, unfortunately, so is
UCLA, conference co-champs, returning with almost the same per
sonnel that tied the Indians last winter.
ANY JOY Stanford might have had in topping the conference
for the first time since 1942 must be dimmed with the memory of
how that tie with UCLA was earned, mainly dropping a two-game
lead in the final weekend and then eliminating themselves from
the NCAA tournament with a loss to the Bruins in a post-season
playoff.
Beating the Bruins won't be any easier for the Tribe cagers this
year, for the Southlanders have their entire starting five again in
cluding 6-2 guard Walt Hazzard, a reasonably good bet for some
body's All-American team. s
INDIANS LOSE CLEMETSON
But where the Bruins are back intact, Stanford is not. All-AAWU
guard Don Clemetson has graduated, as has third leading scorer
Darrell Sutherland, leaving Coach Howie Dallmar with a hole in
the backcourt to fill. As Clemetson was the only regular lost, whether
the Tribe can better last year's 16-9 record depends to a great degree
on who can replace the sharpshooting guard.
With a number of talented sophs up from last year's powerful
freshman team, and some guards returning, the task shouldn't be

►•100 difficult for Dallmar. The |
' leading choices available for back-;
court duty are Kent Hinckly, a '
junior, who replaced Sutherland
at one guard spot toward the end j
of last year, and Lew Shape, who j
averaged 4.1 points per game as i
a part-timer last year.
Another candidate Dallmar is
considering is 6-4 Mollis Moore, j
currently a forward. Moore is
considered a standout on defense
and has been a regular on the
team for the last two years. But
Dallmar has more depth at for-!
ward than elsewhere on the team
and if Shupe or the sophomores
can't handle the job, Moore may
be switched.
KAAKA RETURNS
With or without Moore the for- j
[wards are in good shape with 1
Clayton Raaka, a starter last sea
son, a pair of highly regarded
sophs, Bob Bedell and Ray Ko
sanke, and a couple of others all
shooting for starting jobs.
At center Dose is back, going
after Ail-American recognition
and the all-time Stanford scoring
record. It's unlikely that he'll
miss either this year, and m ay
pick up the conference scoring
crown for good measure.
IT'S ( LEAR that to beat llaz-|
zard and company better than
last year's performance is needed.
Last year, with Clemetson, they
didn't have quite enough. This
year they haven't got him, and
all-AAWU guards are hard to re
place. But with four regulars in
cluding an Ail-American back and
a host of hopefuls behind those,
maybe this year's Stanford bas
ketball season will have a happier
ending for the Tribe.
