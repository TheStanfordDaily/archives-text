and win their third straight over
California opposition this year.
After losing thrillers to Wiscon
sin, 14-9, and Purdue, 7-6, Notre

came up with what publicist
Charley Callahan termed "one of
the greatest victories in our his
tory" as they downed then second

Notre Dame Stadium.
LAST WEEK, the Irish con
vincingly whipped the Bruins of

feated on the coast.
Notre Dame, which has won
both meetings with Stanford in
the past (the last game being

throw an excellent passing attack
centered around Ail-American
prospect Jim Kelly, an end who
holds passing marks at N.D. for
most passes received in a season
(41 i and most total yards on pass
receptions (523).
A pair of fullbacks, junior Joe
Kantor from Cleveland, and
sophomore Pete Duranko from

statistics for Notre Dame. Kan
tor has garnered 71 yards in 13
carries for 5.5 average, while the
burly. 216 11). Duranko has picked

up f>l yards in 15 tries.
AI.L IN' ALL, the underdog In
