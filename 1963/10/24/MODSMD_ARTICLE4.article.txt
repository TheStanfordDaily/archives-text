# Elsen Delivers Lecture on 'City In Modern Art'
## 
### 
Last night Dr. Albert Elsen pre
sented the second in the series of
four lectures on the Modernity of
Modern Art. "The City in Mod
ern Art."
In this lecture, as in the next
two, Dr. Elsen concentrates on
content in modern art, having de
veloped in the last lecture the
idea that the ethic in modern art
is that it be relevant: relevant to
the artist's high visual fidelity
to his environment and experi
ences.
In order to clarify the modern
artist's perspective, Dr. Elsen con
trasted the academic-historical
tradition with the sensitive-to
patterns-of-seeing approach of
the modern artist. Delacroix's
painting on the 1830 Uprising in
Paris, with a symbolic female
figure leading the citizens over
the dead bodies was seen next to
Monet's "14th Juillet" which ig
nores the political, historical or
literary and capitalizes upon the
dazzle of flags, bright spots of
color, Paris on a particular day,
at a particular moment, trans
formed by the giddy government.
Delacroix's painting, though
second-hand and therefore pre
dating the modern attitude, is
nonetheless moving, but one re
acts immediately to the bright
reds and blues in Monet's paint
ing â€” it is an event in itself.
Next Wednesday's "Lecture on
Art" will be given by Dr. Lorenz
Eitner, head of the Art and Archi
tecture Department, on "Clouds,
Madmen and Self-Portraits: Real
ist Themes in Romantic Paint
ing."
