CBS will use two cameras to
cover the show, giving two views
on the TV screen. Three-fourths
of the screen will show the en
tire section from across the field,
while the remaining quarter of
the screen shows a close-up of the
card section.

both the oldest and the largest in
the country. It contains 3,46.")
cards, over 1.000 cards more than
any other section in the country.
BILL KUEIIN, director of cards
on the Axe Commission, asked all
students to cooperate fully in per
forming the stunts. He stressed
these points:
• Wear white shirts.
• Line up directly behind the
person in front.
• Hold the center of the card
at eye level.
Kitehn said all seats would be
marked so students will know ex
actly where to sit.

mass rally in front of Tresidder
