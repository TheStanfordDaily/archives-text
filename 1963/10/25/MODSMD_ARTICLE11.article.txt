# Wilbur Attacks "Notorious Ratio'
## 
### JIM SELNA 
The idea of two Wilbur spon
sors and a faculty resident has
i mushroomed into a full-sealo ex-
I change dining program for the
freshman class. Every Tuesday
and Thursday 160 girls dine at
I Wilbur, and an equal number of
men dine at Roble and Branner.
Hugh Smith, a sponsor in Otero
land one of the initiators of the
exchanges, said that this was one
I step in breaking down the notor
ious ratio.
Smith told the Daily that there
were quite a few problems in set
the program up, but that it
I was working well. Smith, Jack
Copeland. also a sponsor, and Dr.
Rapson, Otero faculty resident,
conceived the idea of inviting a
! number of freshmen women to
! dine with the house regularly.
The Wilbur, Branner, and Roble
i social coordinators met with
j Smith, and decided to open the
program up t<> the whole of Wil
bur. The program had never been
\ tried before. The bi<j question was
how tÂ«i balance the number of
people eating at each house so
that the Food Service could
handle everyone.
Till: KKACTION in the pro

gram has been varied, but most
freshman like it. The frosh men
and women have a chance to meet
one another on an informal basis.
The men seem to enjoy dining at
I he women's house and getting
| away from the humdrum of the
j dinners at Wilbur. One Wilbur
man unabashedly said that dining
I at Roble forced him to realize
i that he was still a human being
even though he was a college stu
dent. Most men were not so flip
pant. but they all agreed that

dining out twice a week was
something lo look forward to.
The girls who dine at Wilbur
thought that the best part of the
program was getting to meet the
men in a different light. The par
ticipants in the program agreed
that the food was just about the
same everywhere.
SMITH SAII) that this was just
one of many programs that the
sponsors had initiated, but he
stressed that the frosh are the
ones who will be running the pro
gram. He summed up the idea of
the exchange system by saying
that "it gives the frosh a chance
to relax, casually enjoy a meal,
and get to know one another."
The Food Service and the
Dean's Office gave Smith and
Copeland the backing that they
needed to make the idea a reality.
A system of special meal tickets
was worked out for exchange
nights.
Next quarter the frosh will vote
to con t in u e the exchange or
modify it. One of tho things that
has made the program work is
that it is informal and voluntary.
There are plans to provide rides
to and from Roble on exchange
nights.
