# African Bloodshed Termed Inevitable
## 
### 
Visiting Professor of Sociology
St. Clair Drake took the view that
more violence and bloodshed in
Africa is almost inevitable, as he
wound up the lIR Institute on
"Emerging Africa" with a speech
on "America and the Unfinished
African Revolution" last night.
According to Professor Drake,
who has taught at both the Uni
versity of Ghana and the Univer
sity of Liberia, and is presently
writing a book on emerging Afri
can states, the movement toward
freedom and equality in Africa is
irreversible.
Three as yet colonial "trouble
spots" — Angola. Southern Rho
desia, and Mazambique — cannot
remain as they are Drake claimed.
He added that either colonial pow
ers must give in to black de
mands, or the nominally "passive"
Africans will take up arms, just
as our own forefathers once did.
Dr. Drake was quick to point
out that the United States is in
volved in all this whether we like
it or not. The federal govern
ment must decide whether Afri
can freedom and human dignity
or the "friendship" of a few colon
ial powers is more important.
President Kennedy's civil rights
program is greatly helping our
image in Africa, Dr. Drake be
lieves; although many Africans
still equate the United States with
South Africa, because of the ac
tions of such men as Governor
Ross Barnett of Mississippi.
As a project for the ordinary
citizen, Dr. Drake suggested "get
ting the feel of the African revo
lution." in order to understand
ii better and to sympathize with
