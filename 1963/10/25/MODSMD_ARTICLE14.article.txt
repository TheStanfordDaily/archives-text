# Karp Cites Economic Stability Of Ex-European Dependencies
## 
### ROD PECK 
The most important consequence of the association of formei
European dependencies in Africa has been the prevention of an eco
nomic crisis precipitated by the establishment of the Common Mar
ket, stated Dr. Mark Karp ol Boston University in the concluding
speech to the Ilß's Foreign Policy Conference on Africa and the

Common Market. The Treaty of
Rome which established the Com
mon Market also provided for
the association of former French,
Belgian, and Italian dependencies
in Africa.
CITING THE INABILITY to ad
just to rapidly changing world
economic conditions as the major
problem of underdeveloped Afri
can nations. Dr. Karp staled.
"Minor setbacks in other countries
were catastrophic in Africa a n d
were followed by social and poli
tical upheaval." By giving prefer
ential tariff and economic treat
ment to these nations, the Asso
ciation has helped to combat this
situation. He likened the problem
to the analogy expressed by an
African diplomat, ". . . too many
people are concerned with how
one might care for a concubine
before first finding how to pro
vide for a legitimate spouse."
KAKP FELT that the primary
benefit derived from this Associa
tion would therefore be the long
term gain in increased political
and social stability. The economic
gains over non-associated African
nations are likely to be small.
Vet, the factor of overall stability
was more than sufficient justifica
tion of the Association.
The United States has adopted
no definitive position toward the
African association with the Com
mon Market but even so, Karp
felt proper consideration should
be given to these factors.
Karp's speech marked the end
of the Ilß's Seventh Annual For
eign Policy Institute which dealt
exclusively with the problems of
emerging Africa. Six speeches
were given during ihe three day
program, October 22-24, with the
topics ranging from "African So
cialism" to Tribalism and Racial
Issues.
