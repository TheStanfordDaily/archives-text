Francois Mauriac. "What I Believe." Translated with on intro

M. Mauriac begins a short preface by saying, "This book is not
intended for scholars or philosophers or theologians." I could, I
suppose, ask why I should review it. I will not do so, largely because,
whether il was intended for theologians or not, they should not omit
reading it. Nor should anyone who is prepared to enter sympatheti
cally into the thought of someone else, thought that may well not
he his own, may be broadly opposed to his own. M. Mauriac is a
Roman Catholic, and he refuses to hide or to blur the laet. 1 am not.
and I would follow his good example.
The fact that M. Mauriac is a Catholic means that his book is not
merely a statement of his own opinions. That is refreshing, and
it takes some of the lift out of the eyebrow that looks upon any
book entitled "What I Believe" as almost inevitably an exercise in
arrogance. Why in the world should we care what someone else be
lieves? Yet what M. Mauriac turns out to believe is often something
that he would rather not believe. "The unbelievable truth,"he calls
it (p. 100). And it is not finally different from the "unbelievable
truth" that any Christian holds, that "In the world as we find it, we
believe that Christ is present and that His invisible presence is felt
in it" (p. 81). Note "as we find it." It is no good for the Christian
to believe that the presence of Christ in the world depends on the
world's excellence. If it were so, the presence could never be affirmed.
But even in a world anylhing but excellent, besmirched by every evil
man could conceive and some he scarcely can, even there, unbeliev
ably. Christ is present. Besides that — the fantastic assertion of
Christendom that the world as il is is the location of divine redemp
tion the little Objections to believing turn out to be word games.
NO ONE who either accepts or rejects Christianity should permit
himself to do so without being very sure that he understands where
its actual center is. And anyone who either accepts or rejects Chris
tianity ought to read and pay attention to Mauriac, because he knows
where its center is, keeps returning to it, refuses to let the reader
off without seeing it. Nor is it any easier to believe when one is
finished with Mauriac than it was when he started. That is hardly
the point anyway.
There is another aspect of this book that strikes me as being
worth further comment. In Mauriac we have an old man testifying
to what over long years has come increasingly to commend itself
lo him as true. It is perhaps the case that the young (and I would
want to count myself still young — maybe whistling in the dark)
become impatient with the old. We live in a time of such astonish
ingly rapid change that the shape of the world become a blur. It
is probably the assumption of the young that the old have become
so fossilized that the changing world has passed them by. What has
an old man, and a Christian to boot, to say that is relevant to the
impatient, brilliant, and pioneering young? We must not ignore this
question. But neither must we close it oif with a premature answer.
WE MIGHT answer that the young must listen to the old men
because the old men know more. But the young will be skeptical
of that. We might answer that the old men probably have nothing
to say to the young. But that would leave the young unilluminated
by the fact that they were not the first ever to be born. A certain
burden of responsibility rests on both the young and the old, the
burden of justifying their independence on the young, the burden of
letting go of their prerogatives on the old. Perhaps in the end of the
day we should read Mauriac not because he is old but because he is
a Christian and has held his Christianity close to the world as it actu
ally is for many years. There is. after all, a weight of wisdom that,
though it cannot compel our assent, we ignoi-e at our peril.
