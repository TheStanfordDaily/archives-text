# Nazi War Crimes Film Artistic, Provocative
## 
### FOSTER HIKSCH Drama Editor 
The Swedish filmmaker Tore
Sjoberg, who was responsible for
'Mein Kampf" a few years ago,
has produced and edited another
documentary on the Third Reich,
"Socrets of the Nazi War Crimi
nals." He has studiously assem
bled a massive amount of news
reel footage and organized h i s
presentation according to the
three Nuremberg indictments:
crimes against peace, crimes in
waging war, and crimes against
humanity.
The first segment involves Hit
lers hypnotic power over the Ger
man people and the hysteria of
his political ambitions. It is, how
ever, in those scenes depicting
ci imes in war and crimes against
humanity that the film becomes a
benumbing account of the "be
stialities which spurt out of men
under the stimulus of war." We
are shown, in film not previously
available, scenes of unbelievable
inhumanity: emaciated bodies
piled high on top of each other,
acres of human hair and teeth,
human gas chambers, guillotines,
and mass crematories. We are
shown, in short, a universe in
which human life has been ab
surdly devalued, a universe in
which man's capacity for evil
overwhelms his capacity for good,
a universe which is a prolonged,
horrendous nightmare.
WISELY, THE FOOTAGE is al
lowed to speak for itself; the nar
ration is deliberate, dispassionate,
nothing more than a precise
enumeration of facts. Wisely, too,
there is not a distracting music
score; we watch in a dazed
silence. The cumulative effect is
indeed paralyzing. Sojberg's
statement is difficult to accept
as an actual part of the history
of our times; all too often, it ap
pears to be a Daliesque night
mare, staged for a stunning ar
tistic effect, but only superficially
frightening because it is merely
a product of a contorted imagina
tion.
The film offers no new insights

into the Nazi atrocities; we have
been made aware of all this be
fore. Nevertheless, Sjoberg's
achievement is vitally important
just because it is a reminder and
instills in the viewer a recurrent
sense of that horror and brutality
which blackens the twentieth cen
tury.
. The impact of Sjoberg's film is
heightened by his concentration
on the faces of the men who were
on trial at Nuremberg. We look
for indications of sadism, and see
nothing but haggard men with
nervous twitches. Looking at
these men. once again a series of
stinging questions is raised. These
men are assuredly guilty (do we
dare doubt it?), but to w r hat ex
tent are the German people re
sponsible? To what extent must
our own country share in th e
guilt? If God exists, how could
this possibly have happened. Can
il happen again? Are we as in
dividuals powerless to prevent an
other Nuremberg? In the final
analysis, is the need for war in
herent within the nature of man?
These are questions which, by its
very nature, the film cannot fail
to raise. Fortunately, there is no
attempt made to suggest answers.
The film presents the harsh facts.
SJOBERG'S SHOCKING, illu
minating account put the cinema
to good use. No other medium
could capture so graphically and
with such immediacy the hells of
war. He is to be commended for
his effort to enlighten a world
which is not immune to another
Nuremberg.
"Secrets of the Nazi War Crimi
nals" is now screening at the
highly selective North Beach
showcase, the Movie, located at
1034 Kearny Street, just south of
Broadway. Their programs al
ways show taste and intelligence.
Often the Movie has offered the
American premiere of important
foreign films and often too they
present fi'ms which cannot be
seen elsewhere in the United
States. For anyone interested in
cinema as a serious art, I recom
mend the Movie to your attention.
