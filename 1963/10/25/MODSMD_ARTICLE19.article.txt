STERLING APPOINTMENTS I
Editor, The Daily:
The announcement of Presi- j
dential appointments to Univer- .
sity Committees in the Daily on j
Wednesday of this week substan- !
tiates some of the doubts which
I had earlier in the year when the
President's new method of selec
tion was unveiled, and, indeed,
raises some new and interesting
questions.
I, as a student concerned with
making student government, a
mature and viable force on the
campus, must protest this recent
action from the President's office
for the following reasons:
1) The entire method of selec
tion employed by the President
must be called into question on
the basis of a policy statement
from the Board of Trustees (April
2, 1963; Stanford Daily) concern
ing student government at Stan
ford. "All students art* required
to become members of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford Uni
versity which represents th e m
with respect to student affairs on
the Stanford campus." The Presi
dent method of selection under
mines this legitimate function of
student government. Student Gov
ernment is not just one way for
students to participate in student
affairs, it is their single repre
sentative organization on this
campus, and, unfortunately, has
been reduced to a much les sig
nificant status by the President's
action. The President is not mani
festing his desire for a representa
tive student government by un
dercutting that which now exists.
21 The inability of this method
of selection to provide interested
students who have taken the initi
ative to apply to either the ASSU
President or to the Dean of Stu
dents is demonstrated by the fact
that the President went beyond
both the slate proposed by th e
ASSU President and that of the
Dean of Students to find student
members for his Committees.
Sever, student appointees were on
neither of these lists, and at least
one of these seven expressed com
plete surprise upon reading in the
Daily that she had been appointed
to a Presidential Committee.
31 Another inequity dealt by
this method is that of the losing
candidate for the ASSU Presi
dency sitting on the Student Af
fairs and Services Committee,
while the ASSU President does
not. The Student Body President
was placed on the Athletics Com
mittee, an appointment which he
did not seek, to say the least, and
is also on the President's Student
Advisory Committee, a position
which he has by virtue of the fact
that he is ASSU President. I find
it hard to believe that the ASSU
President should not be on 1 h e
committee with which he is obvi
ously most directly connected,
that of Student Affairs and Serv
ices. While I do believe that the
losing candidate can be an im
portant and articulate representa
tive of student opinion, his posi
tion on this committee is not justi
fied without the winning candi
date being there.
4) There was no indication that
service on the President's Student
Advisory Committee would make
students ineligible for service on
any other committees, and last
year four members of the Presi
dent's Student Advisory Commit
tee served on other committees as
well. If the ASSU President had
had any indication that this would
be the rationale, he would have
indicated a strong preference for
the Student Affairs and Services
Committee for himself as well as
others, e.g., Daily Editor, Head
Wilbur Sponsor.
Moreover, besides these specific
grievances which are confusing
perhaps, when described so rapid
ly, why should the entire problem
have been raised? Why did the
President decide to change his
method of selection when last
year's method worked so well, as
manifested by the enthusiastic
response from faculty members
to last year's student performance
on these committees. Where are
the Tom Greys, Maureen Strains,
Bill Butlers, and John McCarthys
on this year's committees?
I cannot, in good conscience, let
this pass without challenge, as it
is setting a precedent which has
ominous implications for the fu
ture of student government at
Stanford. I hope that if other
students agree, they will make
their positions known in every
possible way.

IFB ACTION
Editor, The Daily:
Tuesday's half page spread on
the Zete House, a subject which
seems to fascinate those farthest
removed from it, leaves one won
dering why there is need for even
one morning newspaper on th e
peninsula.

Editor, The Daily:
How could you possibly? I find
it incredible!
My objection to your featuring
Russell Kirk is not that lie is a
self-proclaimed conservative.
My objection is that you put
him in ihe same league (yes, Big
League!) with Walter Lippmann.
Lippmann is a great newspaper
man and a brilliant political es
sayist.
Kirk is neither great nor bril
liant. He is strictly a busher.

ROTC
Editor, The Daily:
Certainly participation in mili
tary training at Stanford is volun
tary, but how can one reconcile
making available a program of
instruction in learning to kill with
the values of education, which
traditionally rest on the develop
ment of the freedom of the in
dividual to seek knowledge a n d
truth both about himself and his
environment? The university does
not see as part of its task to pro
vide opportunities for individuals
to learn voluntarily how lo crack
a safe or use a black-jack. Simi
larly, it seems clear to me that
a university which purports to
concern itself with the growth of
individuals cannot provide for the
instruction of these individuals in
organization to kill other individ
uals; in short, that there is no
place for ROTC on campus.
The fact that our society has
accepted widely the overwhelm
ing influence of the military and
the nation-state makes it even
more urgent that educational in
stitutions carry out their stated
intentions of developing the sensi
tivity and awareness of individ
uals, of helping students to per
ceive and act for themselves in
stead of simply acquiescing to the
regimentation and preparations
for nuclear war, for mass murder,
which have become central to our
society. Rather than cooperating
with and even encouraging the
national ROTC program, the uni
versity should concern itself with
active efforts to prevent the en
croachment of military attitudes
and training into the lives of its
students.

SU: MONETARY MAGNET?
Editor, The Daily:
Woe are we, for we feel that
troubled times have settled on
these hallowed halls of belabored
learning. The true spirit of the
founding tat her has pervaded the
common air we breathe and has
instilled in the intelligensia what
might bo called a "Little Leland"
perspective. This is indeed a pro
found tragedy. We readily admit
that the existence of "Little Le
landism" is not patent. Many may
not even acknowledge its pres
ence. Others will claim to be liv
ing proof to the lie. However, we
urge you, the members of the
Stanford commune, not to be mis
led by these devious refutations;
a spectre haunts this campus.
In the past few weeks, Ol' Ed
die and Big Jim have been search
ing the campus diligently for
those most possessed of the "Lit
tle Leland syndrome," and we
must admit that on the whole the
faculty and students have been
suffering only the insidious side
effects of this morbid phenome
non. The real area of concern lies
with the minor bureaucrats of
this great and glorious academic
institution. They alone have been
able to incorporate in their home
spun little creeds the mercenary
tendencies of the one and only Big
Leland. By now it should be in
tuitively obvious to whom we re
fer. Bui for those of you who lack
the intuition for the obvious, we
shall be more explicit.
Specifically we refer to those
hot shot cost accountants in the
TMU and the SUPD. In this mat
ter the SUPD must assume the
greater degree of guilt. The
Duenna Street brain trust has de
vised a sure fire GRQASR scheme
(get rich quick and stay rich)
which is known in D-Street jar
gon as the SUPD multiplier. Bas
ically their philosophy is "Each
dollar spent means several thou
sand more created." As each stu
dent or faculty member invests
in the SUPD bonds (known by
those other than the elite as traf
fic and parking tickets), they are
able to amass more high powered
machinery and "skilled" labor
(more motorcycles and copsi,
which in turn capture the ima
gination of more investors. As
far as we can ascertain, this con
cept is still in its foetal stage of
development, but we predict that
within ten years, if the present
situation persists, dear old SU
will be known as the Financial
Center of the West, a veritable
monetary magnet.
