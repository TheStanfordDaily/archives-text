The coming dedication of Stanford's second fraternity cluster 1
in conjunction with Homecoming serves to illustrate the impor
tance of fraternities on campus and, at the same time, brings to
mind questions as to the future role to be played by fraternities
in the university community. The very existence of these new
facilities proves that Stanford has a stake in the continued growth
and improvement of fraternal groups on campus. The creation
of the position of Director of Fraternities—a post held by Robert
Summers — and the statements of Dean of Men Robert Gordon
also give evidence of the university's confidence in the ability of
the fraternity system to fulfill an important function in campus
life.
At Stanford fraternities are part of an integrated university
housing system along with the eating clubs and independent resi
dences. "Each of these alternatives," states Summers, "has some
thing to offer the Stanford student."
What is this role to be played by the fraternity system? What
does it have to offer the Stanford student? What then is a fra
ternity lor?
A FRATERNITY is, first of all, a group of friends. In a fra
ternity a student has the opportunity to live with the men he has
chosen and who have chosen him. In spite of the often superficial
nature of rushing programs, a student who chooses to enter a
fraternity is more likely to encounter fellow students with similar
tastes, interests, and ideas than the student who chooses some
other form of housing. This is not to say that this background of
common interests is to be sought by all students, but simply that
it is one of the important aspects of what a fraternity has to offer
the student.
The opportunities for self-government and house management
are much greater in a fraternity than in other types of housing.
In financing, government, and social life, fraternities are more
independent than other groups.
THE SMALL SIZE of fraternities gives llie members the oppor
tunity to develop closer friendships than are usually cultivated in
the larger living groups. These friendships often result in discus
sion and an interchange of ideas — important, relevant ideas.
This intimacy adds greatly to the effectiveness of the foreign
student program in the fraternities. Through this program several
fraternities have the opportunity of having a foreign student live
with them during one quarter of the academic year. In thus mak
ing the acquaintence of a student from another country, many
fraternity men find that new interests and ideas, which would
otherwise remain dormant, have been awakened in them.
Fraternities also offer possibilities for the educational develop
ment of their members—opportunities which are aften neglected,
but which nevertheless exist and form an area in which fraternal
groups can grow and develop. Discussions, guest speakers, and
study programs could be developed to aid the educational growth
of fraternity members. The faculty associate program and the
new faculty residences in the clusters offer further possibilities
for educational development.
SOCIAL LIFE, the aspect most commonly associated with fra
ternities, is usually more fully developed in fraternities than in
other living groups. Not only parties and dances but also general
social competence are heavily emphasized. Fraternities attempt
to cultivate the social graces and to help its members gain an

ability to handle various social situations. Here, however, the
ideal is often quite different from the reality. We are often con
fronted with reports of the unsocial behavior of fraternity men.
This problem, however, can also be found in the other kinds of
living groups. It is an area in which both fraternities and other
groups can improve.
Fraternities, then, have a role to play in the university com
munity both socially and academically. "Fraternities," says Sum
mers, "offer the student opportunities for personal development
in a group atmosphere in scholarship, leadership, and social com
petence." And he continues, "They can help a man to take; maxi
mum advantage of his university experience."
The fraternity system has had its critics both just and unjust
in recent years. Some of these have argued that fraternities are
on the decline and are no longer relevant to the general university
scene. However, according to Summers, Stanford has experienced
a slow and steady growth in its fraternity system. With the con
tinued construction of new university clusters, Summers looks
forward to even further increases in the fraternity population here
at Stanford. Growth in the form of an increase in the number
of fraternity chapters here on campus does not seem likely. In
the past applications for new fraternal groups have been refused
by the administration.
A RECENT ARTICLE in (he San Francisco Examiner made
the allegation that the fraternity system in the Bay Area "may
pass out of existence for the ironical reason the Greek letter insti
tutions have refined themselves into high scholarship, no nonsense
houses." In the first place it seems that the author of this article
has gotten the cart before the horse. It could perhaps be more
logically argued that fraternities, in improving their academic
standards, are responding to a basic change in the attitudes of

students. Fraternities are changing to retain the support ol' stu
dents growing increasingly more serious and conscious of their
role in life. It would not seem that students are rejecting fra
ternities in order to find their "nonsense" elsewhere. In the second
place, it does not appear that this "refining process" is as yet
complete although fraternities seem to be continually improving
their academic standings.
The presence of discriminatory clauses in their constitutions
has left some fraternities vulnerable to criticism. However, at
Stanford Summers reports that substantial progress has been
made in this field by all of the fraternities. This work by the
various chapters has not received great publicity; but advances
have been made, and more work is planned for the future.
Fraternities at some universities have experienced hosility on
the part of administration officials. This is not the case at Stan
ford. The Dean of Men's Office has expressed active interest in
the fraternity system and hopes to work closely with the fraternity
members in order to continue the improvement of the campus
fraternity system. Dean Gordon has expressed the desire to "in
crease the educational meaning and importance of fraternities"
on the Stanford campus. IFC Chairman Don Haider states that
there is now a "means of communication between the adminis
tration and fraternity men which did not exist a few years ago."
Both Haider and Dean Gordon feel that fraternities have a role
to play on campus and that they can work together to improve
and develop Stanford's fraternity system.
THIS "(iUKKK UMPIRE" is far from dead on the Stanford cam
pus; and the University, through cooperation between adminis
tration and students, hopes to continually expand the unique
opportunities for intellectual, personal, and social development
which the fraternity system offers.
