ROTC
Editor, The Daily:
No truer parable has been spok
en on the "defense" paradox than
that by Jeffery Shurtleff in these
columns a week ago. We cannot
escape its point, though some are
blinking hard ,in the attempt.
Watch the "eye for an eye" con
cept befoul their rationale.
Old friend ROTC is by nature
no voluntary institution, even
though a number of state-sup
ported colleges have managed to
shake it off. I well remember the
fight of regents and students of
the University of Wisconsin to do
so in 1959. If Jim Bridges will
turn from his amused brow-lifting
to two pages farther (Tuesday
issue), he'll hear its ingratiation
from ROTC's own mouth — "with
good pay, too."
