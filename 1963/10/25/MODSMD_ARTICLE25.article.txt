# Poloists Face Foe
## 
### 
WHAT could be the best water
polo game of the season will take
place today a 1 3:00 p.m. in the
Stanford pool. The powerful USC
Trojans will try to lengthen their
three year conference win streak
by boating the equally powerful
Stanford Indians. Stanford hasn't
beaten the Trojans since 1953, but
coach Jim Gaughran and his team
feel that this year the task will
be accomplished.
USC (last year rated second in
the nation behind Long Beach
State and ahead of Stanford)
brings into the game a team
which is actually stronger than
the team which beat the Indians
twice last year, 8-5 and 9-8. It is
a team which experienced vir
tually no graduation losses ar.d
which picked up some impressive
underclass talent.
Roy Sarrai, All-American AAIJ
water poloist and swimmer, leads
the fast, aggressive Trojan team
in scoring. Perry Linberg, NCAA
100-yard freestyle champion and
all-conference water poloist last
season, teams with Sarrai to make
an effective one-two punch. The
USC goalie shared the all-confer
ence first team berth with Stan
ford's George Stransky* last year
so net play will be superb at
both ends of the pool.
USC is coached by Neill Kohl
hase who was mentor of boih the
1956 and 1960 Olympic loams.
Indian coach Jim Gaughran
played under Kohlhase on the

I 1936 Olympic quad.
Gaughran reports that his team
is in perfect shape for today's
contest both physically and ment
ally. "We are ready for this one.
' It will be a great contest, featur
; ing two groups of outstanding
swimmers," Stanford will use its
most potent weapon, defense, to
1 hold down the Trojans. All-Amer
| ican defensive specialist Do n
Buehler will probably cover the
! dangerous Sarrai most of the
| game. Stanford's small pool will
| also lie of some help. USC plays
j its home games in a pool which
i is about eight feet wider and may
have to alter their attack some
what. However, Graughran points
[out that this hasn't "caused them
i too much trouble in the past."
The Card offensive attack will
Ibe led by Ail-American Marty
Hull and All-AAWU Center-Back
\ Pete Pettigrew. Marty and Pete
: lead the team in goals and have
looked impressive all season. Bill
Lorton, Bill Ready, Brian Beck,
George Stransky, and Don Beuh
ler round out a starting seven
which well might be the best in
the nation.
STANFORD is 10-1 on the
season and USC has an 8-1 rec
ord. The Trojan's only loss came
at the hands of Long Beach State
10-6. Saturday at 11:00 a m| the
varsity face Fullerton J.C. in what
should be an easy contest.
The frosh play two games this
weekend. Friday they face Palo
Alto High School. On Saturday
at 10:00 a.m. they meet Await
H.S. which has the best prep team
in the country.
