# Papooses Go For Third Win
## 
### 
Fresh from a 12-6 victory over
USC's "best team ever," the Stan
ford Papooses will try for their
third victory of the season in as
many outings when they go
against the Baby Bruins of UCLA
tomorrow at 10 a.m. in Stanford
Stadium.
Coach Walsh expects the game
to be a tough one and even thinks
UCLA will be a "little bit better
than USC." He has spent this
week polishing the attack in an
effort to eliminate costly mis
takes. A fumble within the three
yard line last_ week cost the frosh
a margin-widening touchdown.
Stanford lost its first two
quarterbacks, Dave Lewis and
Hick Bianchina, in the S.C. con
test and now must count on John
Propstra, an All-Stater from
Arizona, to fill the gap. He has
seen extensive action during the
first two games, but this will be
his first starting assignment.
At fullback, John Reed, playing
third string the first game, has
moved up to top spot.
Bruce Lytle, a small but speedy
addition to the defensive unit, will
be safetyman and will team up
with cornermen Bob Oar and Bob
Blunt to provide a fast secondaiy
coach Walsh hopes will be invul
nerable to the big play.
