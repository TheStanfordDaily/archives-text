# Irish, TV Invade Stanford
## 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
The Stanford Indians, after
what Coach John Ralston called
an "excellent week of practice,"
try to find (he winning combina
tion and snap out of the doldrums
of four straight defeats, as they
encounter a well-balanced Notre
Dame squad here Saturday in a
nationally televised game.
Despite absorbing several tough
defeats during the last month of
play in compiling their 1-4 record,
the Indians are very highly
"keyed" for victory. Ralston said
the team has showed a "lot of
improvement" during this week's
practice.
The Tribe has concentrated
primarily on offensive and de
fensive consistency in preparation
for the "Fighting Irish." The
Stanford offense, while at itmes
brilliant, has unfortunately, much
of the time been spotly. Mental
lapses, both offensively and
defensively, have stalled long
marches and set up scores for
opponents.
Another aspect of play the
Tribe has sought to improve on
is pass defense. Although the
team has shown some improve
ment during the last few games,
this week they will have to con
lend with big Jim Kelly, an All-

America end prospect who breaks !
a new school record every time he
catches a pass.
Adding to the defensive backs'
problems next week will be |
Frank Budka, now back in form
after a long layoff caused by a
broken leg. A good field marshal,
Budka has a better than .500 com- !
pletion ratio for his passing.
But even with a strong passing !
attack, the Noire Dame team has i
gained most of their yardage
throughout the season with a
stronger rushing attack. Leading
the attack have been the burly
fullbacks, Joe Kant or and Pete !

Duranko, and line inside block
ing led by Capt. Bob Lehmann.
Ralston rales this attack as the
biggest his charges will have to
stop Saturday. "Budka and Kelly
make a formidable passing com
bination, but I'm more worried
about the steady, consistent Notre
Dame ground game."
The Irish, coming off impres
sive wins over Southern Cal and
UCLA, are heavy favorites to win
their third straight over Califor
nia opposition, and third straight
over Stanford in a long and hectic
series that dates all the way back
to 1925. But Ralston is confident
that his team will meet the chal
lenge.
"If we can continue to improve
as we have the last few games,
and maintain the same fire and
spirit of practice sessions, this
can be our week for the upset
win."
Stanford's line-up will be ap
proximately the same as last
week, except for the inclusion of
sophomore Dick Berg at quarter
back, and Bob Burke at end. The
probable starling line-ups:
STANFORD NOTRE DAME
Burke RE Coberville
Nichols RT Meyers
Wilbur RG DeCarlo
Harris C Carroll
Cliapple EG Eehniann
Hart wig ET Arlington
Howard EE Kelly
B»*rg QB Budka
Thurlow RH Snow

defensively, have stalled long
marches and set up scores for
opponents.
Another aspect of play the
Tribe has sought to improve on
is pass defense. Although the
team has shown some improve
ment during the last few games,
this week they will have to con
lend with big Jim Kelly, an All-

America end prospect who breaks !
a new school record every time he
catches a pass.
Adding to the defensive backs'
problems next week will be |
Frank Budka, now back in form
after a long layoff caused by a
broken leg. A good field marshal,
Budka has a better than .500 com- !
pletion ratio for his passing.
But even with a strong passing !
attack, the Noire Dame team has i
gained most of their yardage
throughout the season with a
stronger rushing attack. Leading
the attack have been the burly
fullbacks, Joe Kant or and Pete !

Duranko, and line inside block
ing led by Capt. Bob Lehmann.
Ralston rales this attack as the
biggest his charges will have to
stop Saturday. "Budka and Kelly
make a formidable passing com
bination, but I'm more worried
about the steady, consistent Notre
Dame ground game."
The Irish, coming off impres
sive wins over Southern Cal and
UCLA, are heavy favorites to win
their third straight over Califor
nia opposition, and third straight
over Stanford in a long and hectic
series that dates all the way back
to 1925. But Ralston is confident
that his team will meet the chal
lenge.
"If we can continue to improve
as we have the last few games,
and maintain the same fire and
spirit of practice sessions, this
can be our week for the upset
win."
Stanford's line-up will be ap
proximately the same as last
week, except for the inclusion of
sophomore Dick Berg at quarter
back, and Bob Burke at end. The
probable starling line-ups:
STANFORD NOTRE DAME
Burke RE Coberville
Nichols RT Meyers
Wilbur RG DeCarlo
Harris C Carroll
Cliapple EG Eehniann
Hart wig ET Arlington
Howard EE Kelly
B»*rg QB Budka
Thurlow RH Snow
Iiagsdah* EH Farrell
Myers FB Duranko


Duranko — "It's My Ball"
The Stanford Indians, after
what Coach John Ralston called
an "excellent week of practice,"
try to find (he winning combina
tion and snap out of the doldrums
of four straight defeats, as they
encounter a well-balanced Notre
Dame squad here Saturday in a
nationally televised game.
Despite absorbing several tough
defeats during the last month of
play in compiling their 1-4 record,
the Indians are very highly
"keyed" for victory. Ralston said
the team has showed a "lot of
improvement" during this week's
practice.
The Tribe has concentrated
primarily on offensive and de
fensive consistency in preparation
for the "Fighting Irish." The
Stanford offense, while at itmes
brilliant, has unfortunately, much
of the time been spotly. Mental
lapses, both offensively and
defensively, have stalled long
marches and set up scores for
opponents.
