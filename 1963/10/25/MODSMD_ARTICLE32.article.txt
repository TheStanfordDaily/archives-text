# S.C. Harriers Face Indians
## 
### 
Stanford's cross-country team
faces one of its sternest lests of
the season tomorrow morning at
9:30 in Berkeley when it takes on
Cal's Golden Bears and a strong
USC unit.
In their only previous compe
tition, Payton Jordan's Indians
bested Cal in the Sacramento
State Invitational two weeks ago
by better than 40 points, placing
second while the Bears took third.
USC's Julio Marin, a double
winner in last year's N'CAA dis
tance events may be ineligible to
run because he is a junior college
transfer. USC also boasts Bruce
Bess, holder of the ninth best
mark ever run over the Stanford
course and the freshmen record.

Notre Dame's famous Imek
fiekl, the Four Horseman, will
reunite for the first time in
many years al tomorrow's
game. Ernie Nevers, an all-time
great Stanford fullback, will
also be on hand to see his alma
mater In action.

II you have a transistor radio,
bring it to the game and listen
to the play-by-play on KCBS.
