THE OLDEST card stunt in the U.S.A., the expanding Stanford "S," will be televised by CBS during
halftime at the Stanford-Notre Dame football game tomorrow. Bill Kuehn, Director of Cards on
Axe Commission, reminds all students who will be participating in the card section to wear white
shirts, sit directly behind the person in front, and to hold the center of the cards at eye level.
