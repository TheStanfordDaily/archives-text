Stanford student Robert Mann
said today he was physically well
treated during his 21-month im
prisonment in East Berlin, ac
cording to an Associated Press
release. He said that the expe
rience had left him a nervous
wreck.
When he appeared before re
porters in the U.S. mission in
West Berlin he was very pale
and obviously nervous. His Eng
lish was stumbling, as if spoken
by a German. He frequently
turned to a U.S. official to ask
for the translation of a German
word into English.
Mann was sentenced to 21
months imprisonment after a
secret trial in East Berlin July
14, 1962, on charges of trying to
help an East German escape to
the west. Informed sources said
he was accused of trying to sup
ply false identity papers to a
young East Berliner.
Mann was released by the Rod
regime yesteday. He said that he
stayed last night in a private
home in West Berlin. "I'm glad
to be back, but one of the most
important things for me now is
the process of making a transi
tion," he said. "I am nervous and
I still have difficulty speaking
English."
He said the East Germans never
tried to use force to convert him
to communism, but they often
discussed communism with him.
