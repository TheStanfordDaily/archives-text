## 
### ROGER MAGNUSEN 
A nation-wide television audience Saturday witnessed the super
charged Stanford Indians demolish the heavily favored Irish of Notre
Dame, 24-14, before a wildly cheering, upset-minded crowd of Card
partisans al Stanford Stadium.
It was a beautiful day for football, and the game matched the

weather from the opening kick
off. The Tribe, showing improve
ment steadily over the last few
games, finally came into their
own, almost completely dominat
ing the game against highly
touted Notre Dame.
But the first series of downs
suggested that perhaps the "ex
perts" were going to be right in
predicting that the Indians would
suffer.their fifth consecutive de
feat of the season.
WINNING THE toss, the Irish
captain, guard Bob Lehmann,
elected to receive. A Stanford off
side on Braden Beck's 60-y a r d
kick-off drew a five yard penalty,
and forced the Cards to kick from
their own 35.
Notre Dame halfback Bill Wol
ski then took this second effort
on his own 12 and raced 35 yards
to put the Irish in excellent field
post ion on their own 47. The In
dians jumped off-side again on
the first play from scrimmage,
giving Notre Dame a first down
and five yards to go situation on
the Stanford 48.
From there on the Irish seemed
virtually unstoppable as they
marched through the Card off
ense needing 14 plays and 5 min
utes, 24 seconds to register their
first score. The drive was cli
maxed by quarterback Frank Bud
ka's plunge over center from 1
yard out. Ken Ivan added the ex
tra point and Notre Dame was
already seven point in front.
When Stanford finally got their
hands on the ball, they found
trouble moving against the tough
Irish defense and were forced to
punt on fourth down with 24
yards to go. But Stanford wasn't
about to fold.
TIIItEE MINUTES later, end
Gary Pettigrew intercepted a
long Budka aerial on the Stanford
36 intended for Notre Dame's
chief hope for All-America honors,
end Jim Kelly. The Cards started
to move.
Halfback Ray Handley, who
averaged 7:25 yards per carry in
the first half, swept the left end
of the line for thirteen yards, and
three plays later caught a pass
for ten more, down to the Notre
Dame 36. Then, the Indians moved
all the way to the 16 after an un
neeesary roughness penalty on
Notre Dame.
However, on the next play from
scrimmage, Stanford got caught
holding and was back again on
the 30. Successive completions on
passes from Berg to Burke, a n d
Thurlow to Ragsdale for 13 and 8
yards respectively, brought th e

ball to the none, Ragsdale then
carted the ball to the four as the
quarter ended.
On the first play of the second
quarter Steve Thurlow. whose
hard running and clutch passing
earned him the 'back of th game"
award from the writers present,
smashed over right tackle for 4
yards and the score. Beck con
verted the point after and the In
dians were back in the game.
AFTER EXC HANGING punts
with the Irish, the Cards got a
break when Dick Ragsdale alertly
leaped on a fumble at the Notre
Dame 18. Rushes by Thurlow and
Ragsdale brought Ihe pigskin in
side tho 12, but Notre Dame's de
fense stiffened and Stanford was
forced to accept a 30-yard field
goal off the talented toe of Braden
Beck. The scent of an upset was
in the air.
But the tantalizing scent was
short-lived as, on the next series
of downs, Notre Dame again
showed its offensive might, this

time using nine plays, and a 15-
yard unnecessary roughnes call
against Stanford, to reach pay
dirt and pull ahead, 14-10.
A Budka pass to end Dave Pivec
was the clincher in the series,
Pivec grabbing the ball while sur
rounded by four Stanford defend
ers at the five and stumbling into
the end zone. Ivan's conversion
attempt was good with 5:31 left
in the half.
The Indians made a gallant ef
fort to go ahead once again in
the last minute before the end of
the second half. But, after driv
ing down to the 2 yard line, quar
terback Berg fumbled, and Irish
halfback Clay Stephens fell on it
to finish off the drive and the half.
Taking the kick-off to open the
half, the Cards began to cut off
yardage in big chunks, especially
using the magnificent Thurlow
on pass-run options that loosened
up the Notre Dame defense.
After Thurlow had plunged
over right tackle from the five

i for the score, Beck picked up his
sixth point of the game by suc
cessfully booting the point after.
The final, and longest, scoring
drive was begun with 1:50 left
in the third quarter with the ball
on the Stanford 15. Using sharp
rushing plays off the right side
of the Irish line, with Thurlow,
Ragsdale, and Handley doing most
j of the carrying, they ripped off 85
I yards, with Thurlow getting credit
for the score again on a 5 yard
; burst off right tackle.
BECK MADE the point after
once more, and the scoring w a s
complete.
Led by Thurlow's rushing, the
Cards also outgained Notre Dame
221 yards to 91 on the ground,
122-99 in the air, and 343 to 190
overall.
In addition to Thurlow's choice
as back of the game, Stanford's
tackle A 1 Hindebrand was named
' lineman of the game for his con
j tribution to a consistent Indian de-
I fense.
