### ROGER MAGNUSEN 
A nation-wide television audience Saturday witnessed the super
charged Stanford Indians demolish the heavily favored Irish of Notre
Dame, 24-14, before a wildly cheering, upset-minded crowd of Card
partisans al Stanford Stadium.
It was a beautiful day for football, and the game matched the

weather from the opening kick
off. The Tribe, showing improve
ment steadily over the last few
games, finally came into their
own, almost completely dominat
ing the game against highly
touted Notre Dame.
But the first series of downs
suggested that perhaps the "ex
perts" were going to be right in
predicting that the Indians would
suffer.their fifth consecutive de
feat of the season.
WINNING THE toss, the Irish
captain, guard Bob Lehmann,
elected to receive. A Stanford off
side on Braden Beck's 60-y a r d
kick-off drew a five yard penalty,
and forced the Cards to kick from
their own 35.
Notre Dame halfback Bill Wol
ski then took this second effort
on his own 12 and raced 35 yards
to put the Irish in excellent field
post ion on their own 47. The In
dians jumped off-side again on
the first play from scrimmage,
giving Notre Dame a first down
and five yards to go situation on
the Stanford 48.
From there on the Irish seemed
virtually unstoppable as they
marched through the Card off
ense needing 14 plays and 5 min
utes, 24 seconds to register their
first score. The drive was cli
maxed by quarterback Frank Bud
ka's plunge over center from 1
yard out. Ken Ivan added the ex
tra point and Notre Dame was
already seven point in front.
When Stanford finally got their
hands on the ball, they found
trouble moving against the tough
Irish defense and were forced to
punt on fourth down with 24
yards to go. But Stanford wasn't
about to fold.
TIIItEE MINUTES later, end
Gary Pettigrew intercepted a
long Budka aerial on the Stanford
36 intended for Notre Dame's
chief hope for All-America honors,
end Jim Kelly. The Cards started
to move.
Halfback Ray Handley, who
averaged 7:25 yards per carry in
the first half, swept the left end
of the line for thirteen yards, and
three plays later caught a pass
for ten more, down to the Notre
Dame 36. Then, the Indians moved
all the way to the 16 after an un
neeesary roughness penalty on
Notre Dame.
However, on the next play from
scrimmage, Stanford got caught
holding and was back again on
the 30. Successive completions on
passes from Berg to Burke, a n d
Thurlow to Ragsdale for 13 and 8
yards respectively, brought th e

ball to the none, Ragsdale then
carted the ball to the four as the
quarter ended.
On the first play of the second
quarter Steve Thurlow. whose
hard running and clutch passing
earned him the 'back of th game"
award from the writers present,
smashed over right tackle for 4
yards and the score. Beck con
verted the point after and the In
dians were back in the game.
AFTER EXC HANGING punts
with the Irish, the Cards got a
break when Dick Ragsdale alertly
leaped on a fumble at the Notre
Dame 18. Rushes by Thurlow and
