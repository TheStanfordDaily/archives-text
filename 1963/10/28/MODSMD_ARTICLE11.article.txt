# Stanford Students Can Change Missiissippi
## 
### 
Yesterday morning at 8 a.m. four Stanford students began
a voyage of 48 hours straight driving to Mississippi. An
other group left yesterday afternoon. They have mid-terms
this week, little money, and the ability to work directly to
make Mississippi, USA, a place where one man has one vote,
where people are not beaten and jailed for attempting to
exercise the franchise.
The students will lx* field workers on the Aaron Henry
for Governor campaign, the mock election that will permit
the disenfranchised Negroes to express to their state, the
nation, ami the federal government that close to 50 percent
of Mississippi's qualfied voters want to vote and cannot.
When the information was received yesterday morning of
the drastic need for funds for the vote, a quick collection at
one Florence Moore house yielded $100, a collection at a meet
ing of the Stanford Daily Staff produced another $100, and
a Wilbur house and brief visits to some faculty homes added
a third $100.
With funds to release campaign workers from jail, with
funds to carry on the campaign publicity, enough Negroes
will vote in the November 2, 3, and 4 balloting to give lever
age to the federal government to turn Mississippi citizens into
American citizens with full privileges. As more and more
money is needed for bail, the financial needs at this last and
crucial moment are vast.
We cannot all go down to Mississippi. Few of us can know
if we have a commitment which would bring us from Stanford
in the middle of the quarter to lend the force of the Northern
student to the needs of Mississippi. However, financial aid is
a direct contribution.
These arc 1 times when marching in the street, when voter
registration drives, are not the work of small groups of "radi
cals." The Northern university students are no longer isolated
in their concerns from the brutality and intimidation of Missis
sippi. And with the support of the Northern academic com
munities, "We Shall Overcome" will join songs of the Ameri
can Revolution, the Civil War, and the labor unions as a part
of American history — a song of the past.

can Revolution, the Civil War, and the labor unions as a part
of American history — a song of the past.
Yesterday morning at 8 a.m. four Stanford students began
a voyage of 48 hours straight driving to Mississippi. An
other group left yesterday afternoon. They have mid-terms
this week, little money, and the ability to work directly to
make Mississippi, USA, a place where one man has one vote,
where people are not beaten and jailed for attempting to
exercise the franchise.
The students will lx* field workers on the Aaron Henry
for Governor campaign, the mock election that will permit
the disenfranchised Negroes to express to their state, the
nation, ami the federal government that close to 50 percent
of Mississippi's qualfied voters want to vote and cannot.
When the information was received yesterday morning of
the drastic need for funds for the vote, a quick collection at
one Florence Moore house yielded $100, a collection at a meet
ing of the Stanford Daily Staff produced another $100, and
a Wilbur house and brief visits to some faculty homes added
a third $100.
With funds to release campaign workers from jail, with
funds to carry on the campaign publicity, enough Negroes
will vote in the November 2, 3, and 4 balloting to give lever
age to the federal government to turn Mississippi citizens into
American citizens with full privileges. As more and more
money is needed for bail, the financial needs at this last and
crucial moment are vast.
We cannot all go down to Mississippi. Few of us can know
if we have a commitment which would bring us from Stanford
in the middle of the quarter to lend the force of the Northern
student to the needs of Mississippi. However, financial aid is
a direct contribution.
These arc 1 times when marching in the street, when voter
registration drives, are not the work of small groups of "radi
cals." The Northern university students are no longer isolated
in their concerns from the brutality and intimidation of Missis
sippi. And with the support of the Northern academic com
munities, "We Shall Overcome" will join songs of the Ameri
can Revolution, the Civil War, and the labor unions as a part
of American history — a song of the past.
