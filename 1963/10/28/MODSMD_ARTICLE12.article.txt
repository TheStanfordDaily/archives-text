PEACE CORPS
Editor, The Daily:
Apparently I failed to make the
point of my letter of last Tues
day entirely clear to Mr. Grothe,
and perhaps to other readers of
the Daily, including the potential
Peace Corps volunteers to whom
it was directed.
It goes without saying that all
the Peace Corps volunteers, and
most of the staff members, are
idealists, in the sense that they
are willing, and even eager to
work hard under difficult condi
tions, and the Peace Corps is
naturally eager to recruit and
hire such people. That is as it
should be. But my point is that
if a volunteer, no matter how will
ing and eager he is to do this
hard, rewarding work, indicates
an interest in such questions as
fundamental morality or the hu
man condition, he does so at his
own risk. As Mr. Grothe says,
the Peace Corps wants not just
idealists but "pragmatic idealists,"
and I found that a trainee can be
labelled as the other kind of ideal
ist, which Mr. Grothe does not
specify, if he shows too keen an
interest in philosophical ques
tions. In my case, a conversation
with the project psychologist on
such unpragmatic topics eventu
ally resulted in a decision by the
head of the selection committee,
another psychologist whom none
of us knew, that I "wouldn't ad
just" to Peace Corps life in In
dia, this iit spite of a record of
all A's on Peace Corps work and
reportedly high ratings by my
fellow trainees.
As Mr. Gothe acknowledges,
the Peace Corps can make mis
takes in selection. The cases of
Mr. Marx, myself, and a couple
in another project that I am ac
quainted with lead me to suspect
that for some of these mistakes
there is a discernible pattern. I
hope that by being forewarned of
this pattern, some potential
trainee can assist the Peace Corps
in retaining more, and not fewer
idealists in its ranks, an objective
in which Mr. Grothe and myself
are apparently in complete har
mony.

SOCCER
Editor, The Daily:
I appreciate the concern of
Messrs. Tuttle and Gondim over
the inaccuracies in a Daily story
of the soccer game on October 12,
and I admit my disappointment
at having my "moment of glory"
overlooked in the story. However,
I have with the other members
of the soccer team a concern over
the general inadequacies and in
accuracies in the coverage of soc
cer in the Daily. Hopefully, it has
been or will remedied.
We are also concerned about
the general lack of interest to
ward an exciting sport and a win
ning team.

STANFORD POLICE
Editor, The Daily:
Once upon a time, many years
ago, a University not yet on the
Edge of Greatness, but neverthe
less well endowed with Cream of
America's Youth, decided that,
some form of student and campus
protection was necessary. So the
Trustees set up a commission, and
called it the Campus Police De
partment. They hired many top

flight officers of the law to serve
in this department, and they
divided the department into two
divisions, one division to protect
the campus, and one to patrol it.
Eventually, they set up a th i r d
division, to protect the campus
against the division which pa
trolled it, but that is an issue out
of the past and perhaps best for
gotten.
The specific duties of this de
partment seem to have been writ
ten by tradition rather than by
statute, and, if a list of Police De
partment procedures were to be
written by observing the depart
ment in action instead of in sta
tute, a typical "Orders of the Day"
might read somthing like this:
7:30 a.m.—Direct traffic in front
of Stern Hall. Employ at least one
squad car and one motorcycle.
The officer in the squad car will
cover the motorcycle officer at
all times.
5:00 p.m.—Check parking lots
eveiy five minutes. Give tickets
to anyone parking one minute
overtime.
All Day—Give speeding tickets.
Remember that tickets for going
26 in a 25 mph zone count double
on your weekly score (last week's
winner to be announced at the
party Saturday night).
All Day—Car 117 will stand
watch at the intersection in front
of Wilbur Hall. (Keep your eyes
open, out of the three fatal acci
dents which ocurred here yester
day, two of the cars were speed
ing and the surviving drivers col
lectively fined $200. Good work,
men.)
Quad Patrol (Day Shift)— Ca
ptain Midnight will remove muf
flers from his Harley and hide in
the Foyer of Memorial Church.
Give tickets to any students rid
ing bicycles in the Arcades. Use
siren if necessary (Mrs. Stan
ford's wishes about bicycles must
be honored).
Quad Patrol (Night Shift) —
Close all classrooms on Quad
promptly at 10:00. The students
can study in their dorms, and be
sides, the University electric bill
is more important than their stud
ies, anyway.
All Cars—ln no case, repeat no
case should any police vehicle or
officer go near the intersection of
Galvez and Campus Drive (near
the Stadium) between the hours
of 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. Traffic is
unbelievable during this time, and
you might get hurt trying to
drive through the melee on the
way to the Station Coffee Hour
(5:00-6:00). If you must drive
through this intersection, and wit
ness an accident here, call the
Palo Alto Police Department at
your earliest convenience, or after
the coffee hour, which ever comes
later. If traffic is tied up com
pletely, check your may of "Em
ergency Alternate Routes Around
Campus Trouble Spots." Remem
ber, there is always some way to
avoid any problem.
Finally, handle all problems
with tact and diplomacy, and
above all. do not antagonize the
administration. Remember, if you
get thrown out of here, you may
actually have to get a job and go
to work for a living.
And thus ends another day in
the lives of our Campus Cops.
Isn't this game of "public protec
tion" fun?
