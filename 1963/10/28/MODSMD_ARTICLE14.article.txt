ROTC
Editor, The Daily:
I quote from Miss Chenery's
letter concerning ROTC in last
Friday's Daily: "values of educa
tion which traditionally rest on
the development of the freedom
of the individual to seek knowl
edge and truth both about him
self and his environment." Notice
that word "freedom." Wake up,
Miss Chenery. Come down out of
those clouds of oughtness and
take a look at the isness of life.
How long do you think you would
have that freedom if there were
not those who went out and dealt
with the realities of life? Go to
any Communist country and see
how much freedom you are al
lowed with which to develop your
individuality.
Affiliation with an armed force
is something that must be done
by those, who have any sense of
duty, to protect their freedom
and yours. We all wish that man
could put the walls down and
live entirely at peace, but he
can't. He can't because reality and
ideality are inseparable in th is
life. Thank Heavens for the ROTC
program and other programs like
it that gather men who know why
they must do something that does
not agree with I heir ideals; who
have the insight to see why they
must participate. They pay for
their citizenship, Miss Chenery.
What do you do for yours?

Editor, The Daily:
Perhaps the most fascinating
element in Mr. Shurtleff's letter
of October 17 is ihe author's ap
parent astonishment in discover
ing that men display blatant in
consistencies. His implication is
that the blame for this phenome
non rests with institutions; in this
case they have balefully meta
morphosed a genlle man into a
militant. Undeniably, there are
less absurd pastimes lhan war,
including the hurling of invec
tives during the Sunday Night

Flicks. However, despite all pious
declarations to the contrary,
Homo sapiens obviously revels in
war, at least in its initial stages;
one suspects that liberal doses of
legislation are not going to cure
this neolithic abandon in the near
future.
No doubt this fact becomes a
dilemma to the philosophic. When
the unsanctified barbarians
scramble over the walls, how are
they to be greeted? Those who
wish to embrace them as brothers,
rejoicing hearts o'er flowing with
humanitarian love, ought not to
be too disappointed if there is no
understanding response. Still. I
suppose that there would be com
pensations. Had this approach
been tried in 1942, for instance,
those of us sufficiently Aryan to
have survived could today be
heiling the successors of Hitler
with the eminently satisfying
realization that we had remained
rationally and consistently true
to "that which is gentle, and hum
ble, and holy in each individual."
I, for one, am quite pleased
that the man of religion is incon
i sistent and marches in league
with the ROTC. I have no desire
to live under the Marxist-Leninist-
Stanlinist hybrid, whether the
virulent type of China or Khru
shchev's pasteurised variety, and
will probably require more than
I a beatific glow to preserve this
ambition.

Editor, The Daily:
| I would like to take this oppor
' tunity to call Mr. Parker a damned
liar. Liar, liar!
Any simpleton knows that row
number 14 is nowhere near the
front of the balcony. Mr. Parker
could not have been anywhere
near the "touch-down" area when
Svelton Suetos took his memor
able lunge into immortality.
It's this kind of letter that ruins
, the fun for everyone else!

P.S.: What's wrong with a Jack
son Pollack painting?
