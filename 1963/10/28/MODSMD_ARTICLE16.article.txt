# Ralston Lauds Team, Staff In Notre Dame Post-Mortem
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
Atoning nicely for two near
misses away from home, the In
dians returned to their reserva
tion Saturday and began a "new
season" as they played exciting,
relatively flawless football to de
feat the highly-rated Irish of No
tre Dame, 24-14.
After the game, Coach Ralston,
as happy as could be. remarked,
"Life is worth living again." When
asked the difference between this
game and the four consecutive
losses preceding il, Ralston pro
claimed, "The team took them
selves over the fine line between
victory and defeat."
THE PLAYERS were, lie said,
convinced up to and throughout
the game that Notre Dame could
be beat and set about to accom
plish this task.
Called upon several times to
evaluate player performances,
Ralston had mentioned a good
part of Stanford's roster before
answering all questions.
Backfield members cited were
Dick Berg, engineer of all of
Stanford's three lone h d o w n
marches; Steve Thurlow, the
Tribe's "Mr. Double Threat" who
ran for two TD's and passed for
the third; his running mate Dick
Rragsdale, another busy runner
Saturday; and the second unit
halfback conbination of J. D. Lo
dato and Ray Handley, which,
Ralston said, is coming along
nicely.
CONCERNING LINE PLAY,
Ralston called the game "the line's
best play of the season." "Tre
mendous efforts" went out to
Capt. Marv Harris, A1 Hildebrand,
and Chuck Hart wig for their de
fensive work. Guy Rounsaville
and Bob Nichols also received
mention.
Rod Rust, Ralston said, did an
especially fine job in making de
fensive adjustments for the game.

Iho derision to run outside as
much as possible was a consenus
decision of ihe entire staff.
ASKKI) IF perhaps he might
have forgotten someone â€” him
self Ralston replied, "The losses
are my fault, and the team and
the rest of the coaching staff get
credit for the wins."
But credit does belong to Ral
ston, to a large extent. Under his
first-year tutelage, the Indians'
tomahawks without exception
have been getting sharper every
week.
Against Notre Dame, the In
dians again played four-quarter
football and, for the first time,
consistently made first downs
when they counted most.
