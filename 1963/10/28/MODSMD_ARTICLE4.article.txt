### 
United Press International
SAIGON A Buddhist priest drenched his saffron robes with
gasoline outside Saigon's Roman Catholic Cathedral Sunday, struck
a match and died a flaming death to protest alleged "suppression"
of his religion by the South Vietnamese government.
Hundreds of persons witnessed the self-immolation of Ho Dinli
Van. 42, but an apparent error in timing by the priest prevented
members of the seven-man U.N. fact-finding mission from seeing him
die. The mission was sent to South Viet Nam to find out if the gov
ernment of President Ngo Dinh Diem was in fact persecuting Budd
hists.
The U.N. motorcade en route to the An Quang Buddhist pagoda
passed the big cathedral after the suicide, and team members did
not see it. It was the seventh such Buddhist suicide since last June.
Buddhist sources said the priest, shortly before his suicide, had
written a series of letters to United Nations Secretary General Than)
and to President Diem saying he was taking his life to protest "the
suppression of Buddhism."
