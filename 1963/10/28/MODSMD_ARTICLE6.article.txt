# 'Don't Tell Me To Go Slow, You Go Fast'--Louis Lomax
## 
### VIVI BOZMAN 
"The Negro is more than black; he's man. As long as he's in
bondage, all mankind is in bondage," Louis Lomax. a leader of the
Negro freedom movement and author of the book "The Negro Re
volt," told a largely non-student audience in a speech sponsored by
the Civil Liberties Caucus yesterday afternoon.
"So. you white liberals," Lomax dontinued, "don't you tell me

to go slow, you go fast. Because,
if I go slow, the young Negro kids
are going to run me over."
"THE ISSUE in this country,"
Lomax said, "is not between black
and White; it's between right and
wrong. We yell and we demon
strate. because you refuse to obey
your own laws."
Characterizing the Negro revolt
as a first step in a moral evolu
tion of man from "tribalism to
what can be called humanity,"
Lomax warned, "The time to free
man has now arrived, and the
freedom movement will trample
anyone in the way."
Lomax linked Birmingham, Ala
bama; Havana, Cuba; and East
and West Berlins, Germany, as
three scenes where the type of
"moral blindness" which the Ne
gro freedom revolt attacks has
prevailed.
"YOU'VE LOST CUBA," he
stated, "Because Americans have
been blinded by being white, con
sumed by greed. Communism
didn't win it; you goofed it."
Lomax recalled a conversation
he had with a head of a collective
farm near Havana. "Before Fidel
I had nothing," the man told him;
and Lomax found himself speech

less. "How do you argue with a
| man like that?" he asked his
I audience, "How do you tell him
! not to equate American with what
j the United Fruit Company has
: done in Cuba?"
The second city in Lomax's tale
j of three cities is Berlin, where,
he declared, "You have managed
; to rebuild the society economic
-1 ally, because this is your genius
i but have not wiped out the hate
of Jews, because doop in your
! hearts you'd follow this too."
IN ANOTHER "Foreign land
I ruled by an alien ideology," a
I land called Birmingham, Ala
! bama, Lomax found the Negro
revolt a moving spirited expe-
I rience, a movement which moves
I man from the moral blindness
; which caused defeat in Cuba and
j Berlin toward moral evolution.
Condemning the American
moral blindness, Lomax said.
I "There's no point in invading
i Havana, Cuba, before you invade
i Birmingham, Alabama."
Speaking of the goals of the
j Negro revolt, Lomax said, "It's
j not your daughter we want; it's
your money we're after. What
all the non-white peoples of Ihe
: world seek today is economic
I security."
LOMAX EMPHASIZE!) the fact
that the Negro revolt cannot be
stopped. He warned that 5,000
Negro demonstrators, with or
I without a call from such leaders
! as Roy Wilkins, will go back to
Washington. "We let them put us
i in jail in Birmingham for civil
rights," Lomax said; "we'll let
S Bobby Kennedy put us in jail in
I Washington to gel a decent civil
| rights bill passed."
Lomax opened his speech with
a warning against the rising tide
i of conservatism in America to
| day. "We may be forced into
voting for John Kennedy." ho
| said, "not because he smells so
i sweet, but because Goldwater
j stinks so bad."

stopped. He warned that 5,000
Negro demonstrators, with or
I without a call from such leaders
! as Roy Wilkins, will go back to
Washington. "We let them put us
i in jail in Birmingham for civil
rights," Lomax said; "we'll let
S Bobby Kennedy put us in jail in
I Washington to gel a decent civil
| rights bill passed."
Lomax opened his speech with
a warning against the rising tide

"The Negro is more than black; he's man. As long as he's in
bondage, all mankind is in bondage," Louis Lomax. a leader of the
Negro freedom movement and author of the book "The Negro Re
volt," told a largely non-student audience in a speech sponsored by
the Civil Liberties Caucus yesterday afternoon.
"So. you white liberals," Lomax dontinued, "don't you tell me

to go slow, you go fast. Because,
if I go slow, the young Negro kids
are going to run me over."
"THE ISSUE in this country,"
Lomax said, "is not between black
and White; it's between right and
wrong. We yell and we demon
strate. because you refuse to obey
your own laws."
Characterizing the Negro revolt
as a first step in a moral evolu
tion of man from "tribalism to
what can be called humanity,"
Lomax warned, "The time to free
man has now arrived, and the
freedom movement will trample
anyone in the way."
Lomax linked Birmingham, Ala
bama; Havana, Cuba; and East
and West Berlins, Germany, as
three scenes where the type of
"moral blindness" which the Ne
gro freedom revolt attacks has
prevailed.
"YOU'VE LOST CUBA," he
stated, "Because Americans have
been blinded by being white, con
sumed by greed. Communism
didn't win it; you goofed it."
Lomax recalled a conversation
he had with a head of a collective
farm near Havana. "Before Fidel
I had nothing," the man told him;
and Lomax found himself speech

less. "How do you argue with a
| man like that?" he asked his
I audience, "How do you tell him
! not to equate American with what
j the United Fruit Company has
: done in Cuba?"
The second city in Lomax's tale
j of three cities is Berlin, where,
he declared, "You have managed
; to rebuild the society economic
-1 ally, because this is your genius
i but have not wiped out the hate
of Jews, because doop in your
! hearts you'd follow this too."
IN ANOTHER "Foreign land
I ruled by an alien ideology," a
I land called Birmingham, Ala
! bama, Lomax found the Negro
revolt a moving spirited expe-
I rience, a movement which moves
I man from the moral blindness
; which caused defeat in Cuba and
j Berlin toward moral evolution.
Condemning the American
moral blindness, Lomax said.
I "There's no point in invading
i Havana, Cuba, before you invade
i Birmingham, Alabama."
Speaking of the goals of the
j Negro revolt, Lomax said, "It's
j not your daughter we want; it's
your money we're after. What
all the non-white peoples of Ihe
: world seek today is economic
I security."
