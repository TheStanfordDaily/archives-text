# Stanford Students Help Mock Vote; Need Funds
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
A "mock vote" held in Mississippi to afford Negro citizens an
opportunity to express their views has reached a crucial period. The
vote is being held simultaneously with the "legal" gubernatorial
election.
The mock campaign, known as the "Aaron Henry for Governor"

campaign, was (ho product of the
failure to secure Negro registra
tion in the "legal election." On
October 6, a convention of civil
rights organizations working in
Mississippi nominated Henry for
Governor. Henry is a 42 year-old
Negro pharmacist and President
of the State NAACP. Negro vot
ers who would be qualified to vote
in other states of the Union will
cast ballots in the mock election
in order to express their desire to
vote, their inability to register
for the "legal election," and their
opposition to the candidates run
ning.
THE SAMK TYPE of brutal in
timidation that prevented Negro
voter registration legally has been
blocking the Henry for Governor
campaign. A rally scheduled for
last Friday night at a church in
Yazoo city was cancelled "after
grossest intimidation of local Ne
groes," according to a note jotted
on a rally announcement by a
campaign worker.
Sixty Yale students are ex
pected to bo in Mississippi by the
end of the week. Of the first fif
teen which arrived last week, six
were in jail within thirty-six
hours. They are being released
on $100 bail. They are being
picked up on minor traffic viola
tions. loitering, curfew violations.
Professor All ar d Lowenstein,
chairman of the advisory commit
tee of the campaign was arrested
and jailed this week-end for walk
ing across a street at 1:30 in the
morning a curfew violation.
Another group of Stanford stu
dents left yesterday afternoon;
their names were not available to
the Daily at publication time, but
will be included in future news
of the event.
Yesterday morning four Stan
ford students loft for Mississippi.
Fred Goff. a junior majoring in
history and political science; Holt
Ruffin. a sophomore; Hugh
Smith, a senior philosophy major;
and Dennis Sweeney, a junior his
tory major left by car for cam
paign work in Mississippi. Goff
is President of the Latin America
House, Smith is a sponsor in
Otero, and Sweeney is a Cedro
sponsor and speaker of the Stan
ford Student Congress.
FUNDS ARE currently needed
for the campaign itself — publi
city, office supplies, balloting ex
penses — and for bail bonds. It
is most likely that all contributors
to the bail bond fund will have
all money returned to them with
in eight to twelve months. Con
tributors may indicate for which
fund they would like their money
used. Checks may bo made out
to the "Aaron Henry for Gover
nor" campaign. The address of
campaign headquarters is 1072
Lynch Street, Room 10, Jackson,
Mississippi, zip code 39203. Groups
of checks may bo left in the edi
tor's box at the Stanford Daily;
a registered letter will bo sent to
Mississippi by the Daily every
day containing all checks received.
After word of the state of the
vote was received by tho Daily
yesterday morning, an informal
collection wielded close to $330

from one Florence Moore House,
one Wilbur House, one fraternity,
the Stanford Daily staff, and per
sonal visits to some faculty
homes. The majority of checks
were made out to Advisory Com
mittee Chairman Allard Lowen
stein to use where most needed.
Campaign manager Bob Moses
stated in a letter to Lowenstein,
"The Freedom Ballot will show
that if Negroes had the right to
vote without fear of physical vio
lence and other reprisals, they
would do so. It will also show
that not only are they protesting
the obstacles to voting, but that
they have a program and candi
dates in which they believe. It is
our belief that this program is in
the best interest of all the people
of Mississippi, black and white,
and that our candidates are the
best qualified to fill the offices
sought.
". . . We will not be able to
utilize the basic information
media, nor to print and mail out
basic campaign materials, unless
funds arrive almost immediately.
The need is thus desperate, and
we would be deeply grateful for
any help that you may be able to
get for us in this campaign."
As soon as the Stanford stu
dents arrive in Mississippi they
will send tapes and news copy
each day to the Daily and to
KZSU.

The following is a statement
from Allard I\. Lowenstein,
Chairman, Advisory Committee,
Henry for Governor of .Missis
sippi.
What is going on in the Slate?
of Mississippi in October, 1963, is
astonishing to an American citi
zen not experienced in the ways of
this state. It is of course no se
cret; that Negroes in general are
not allowed to vote in Mississippi,
but the American people need to
know that in addition to disen
franchising Negroes, ihe preserva
tion of the "Mississippi way of
life" demands the intimidation of
anyone not willing to support
white rule.
This "way of life" can he called
the "Mississippi way of life" only
in the sense that it is enforced by
Ihe State of Mississippi in viola
tion of the Constitution of the
United States. But in a larger
sense it is unfair to call this the
Mississippi way of life because,
as the people who run the State
well know, it could not survive
the test of a free election. That
is why these people will not allow
a free election to be held.
THE EFFORT to present an al
tentative to the current situation
lias come to be centered in I h e
candidacies of Dr. Aaron Henry
and Rev. R. Edwin King.
Campaign workers for 1 h e s e
candidates have discovered that
it is impossible to function in
Mississippi with the minimum
safeguards of any free society.
People are arrested for distribut
ing leaflets, for violating curfews
while trying to enter hotels, for
committing the most imaginative
variety of non-existent traffic vio
lations. Ministers who offer the
use of church facilities for work
ers are told — sometimes by pri
vate citizens, but more frequently
by officials of the community —
not to "let it happen again."
In short, the atmosphere of this
campaign suggests more nearly
what a campaign might be like
in the Soviet Union or Cuba un
der communism than in the
United Stales of America. In such
a situation, the courage of the
people who are continuing their
efforts in the campaign cannot
fail to impress and move those of
us who have arrived from other
parts of the United States.
WE SHALL tell what we have
found in Mississippi wherever we
go when we leave and we shall
not leave until we have seen
through the rest of this dismal
affair. We shall submit evidence
of what we have found to the
Civil Rights Commission and to
Members of the Congress of the
United Stales in the faith that,
the American people, once they
know the facts, will not long be
willing to allow tyranny to wrap
itself in ihe American flag in an
American state.
We are particularly grateful to
ihe students of Yale University
who have taken time from their
studies and traveled long dis
tances to assist in these efforts.
II is of course a pity that it should
be necessary for people to make
such sacrifices'in our country at
Ibis late date, but it is wonderful
lo know thai Ihere are many pre
pared to flo so as long as it may
be necessary.

Campaign manager Bob Moses
stated in a letter to Lowenstein,
"The Freedom Ballot will show
that if Negroes had the right to
vote without fear of physical vio
lence and other reprisals, they
would do so. It will also show
that not only are they protesting
the obstacles to voting, but that
they have a program and candi

our belief that this program is in
the best interest of all the people
of Mississippi, black and white,

best qualified to fill the offices
sought.
". . . We will not be able to
utilize the basic information

The need is thus desperate, and
we would be deeply grateful for

The following is a statement
from Allard I\. Lowenstein,
Chairman, Advisory Committee,
Henry for Governor of .Missis
sippi.
What is going on in the Slate?
of Mississippi in October, 1963, is
astonishing to an American citi
zen not experienced in the ways of
this state. It is of course no se
cret; that Negroes in general are
not allowed to vote in Mississippi,
but the American people need to
know that in addition to disen
franchising Negroes, ihe preserva
tion of the "Mississippi way of
life" demands the intimidation of
anyone not willing to support
white rule.
This "way of life" can he called
the "Mississippi way of life" only
in the sense that it is enforced by
Ihe State of Mississippi in viola
tion of the Constitution of the
United States. But in a larger
sense it is unfair to call this the
Mississippi way of life because,
as the people who run the State
well know, it could not survive
the test of a free election. That
is why these people will not allow
a free election to be held.
THE EFFORT to present an al
tentative to the current situation
lias come to be centered in I h e
candidacies of Dr. Aaron Henry
and Rev. R. Edwin King.
Campaign workers for 1 h e s e
candidates have discovered that
it is impossible to function in
Mississippi with the minimum
safeguards of any free society.
People are arrested for distribut
ing leaflets, for violating curfews
while trying to enter hotels, for
committing the most imaginative
variety of non-existent traffic vio
lations. Ministers who offer the
use of church facilities for work
ers are told — sometimes by pri
vate citizens, but more frequently
by officials of the community —
not to "let it happen again."
In short, the atmosphere of this
campaign suggests more nearly
what a campaign might be like
in the Soviet Union or Cuba un
der communism than in the
United Stales of America. In such
a situation, the courage of the
people who are continuing their
efforts in the campaign cannot
fail to impress and move those of
us who have arrived from other
parts of the United States.
WE SHALL tell what we have
found in Mississippi wherever we
go when we leave and we shall
not leave until we have seen
through the rest of this dismal
affair. We shall submit evidence
of what we have found to the
Civil Rights Commission and to
Members of the Congress of the
United Stales in the faith that,
the American people, once they
know the facts, will not long be
willing to allow tyranny to wrap
itself in ihe American flag in an
American state.
We are particularly grateful to
ihe students of Yale University
who have taken time from their
studies and traveled long dis
tances to assist in these efforts.
II is of course a pity that it should
be necessary for people to make
such sacrifices'in our country at
Ibis late date, but it is wonderful
lo know thai Ihere are many pre
pared to flo so as long as it may
be necessary.
A "mock vote" held in Mississippi to afford Negro citizens an
opportunity to express their views has reached a crucial period. The
vote is being held simultaneously with the "legal" gubernatorial
election.
The mock campaign, known as the "Aaron Henry for Governor"

campaign, was (ho product of the
failure to secure Negro registra
tion in the "legal election." On
October 6, a convention of civil
rights organizations working in
Mississippi nominated Henry for
Governor. Henry is a 42 year-old
Negro pharmacist and President
of the State NAACP. Negro vot
ers who would be qualified to vote
in other states of the Union will
cast ballots in the mock election
in order to express their desire to
vote, their inability to register
for the "legal election," and their
opposition to the candidates run
ning.
THE SAMK TYPE of brutal in
timidation that prevented Negro
voter registration legally has been
blocking the Henry for Governor
campaign. A rally scheduled for
last Friday night at a church in
Yazoo city was cancelled "after
grossest intimidation of local Ne
groes," according to a note jotted
on a rally announcement by a
campaign worker.
Sixty Yale students are ex
pected to bo in Mississippi by the
end of the week. Of the first fif
teen which arrived last week, six
were in jail within thirty-six
hours. They are being released
on $100 bail. They are being
picked up on minor traffic viola
tions. loitering, curfew violations.
Professor All ar d Lowenstein,
chairman of the advisory commit
tee of the campaign was arrested
and jailed this week-end for walk
ing across a street at 1:30 in the
morning a curfew violation.

"The Freedom Ballot will show

The following is a statement
from Allard I\. Lowenstein,
Chairman, Advisory Committee,
Henry for Governor of .Missis
sippi.
What is going on in the Slate?
of Mississippi in October, 1963, is
astonishing to an American citi
zen not experienced in the ways of
this state. It is of course no se
cret; that Negroes in general are
not allowed to vote in Mississippi,
but the American people need to
know that in addition to disen
franchising Negroes, ihe preserva
tion of the "Mississippi way of
life" demands the intimidation of
anyone not willing to support
white rule.
This "way of life" can he called
the "Mississippi way of life" only
in the sense that it is enforced by
Ihe State of Mississippi in viola
tion of the Constitution of the
United States. But in a larger
sense it is unfair to call this the
Mississippi way of life because,
as the people who run the State
well know, it could not survive
the test of a free election. That
is why these people will not allow
a free election to be held.
THE EFFORT to present an al
tentative to the current situation
lias come to be centered in I h e
candidacies of Dr. Aaron Henry
and Rev. R. Edwin King.
Campaign workers for 1 h e s e
candidates have discovered that
it is impossible to function in
Mississippi with the minimum
safeguards of any free society.
People are arrested for distribut
ing leaflets, for violating curfews
while trying to enter hotels, for
committing the most imaginative
variety of non-existent traffic vio
lations. Ministers who offer the
use of church facilities for work
ers are told — sometimes by pri
vate citizens, but more frequently
by officials of the community —
not to "let it happen again."
In short, the atmosphere of this
campaign suggests more nearly
what a campaign might be like
in the Soviet Union or Cuba un
der communism than in the
United Stales of America. In such
a situation, the courage of the
people who are continuing their
efforts in the campaign cannot
fail to impress and move those of
us who have arrived from other
parts of the United States.
WE SHALL tell what we have
found in Mississippi wherever we
go when we leave and we shall
not leave until we have seen
through the rest of this dismal
affair. We shall submit evidence
of what we have found to the
Civil Rights Commission and to
Members of the Congress of the
United Stales in the faith that,
the American people, once they
know the facts, will not long be
willing to allow tyranny to wrap
itself in ihe American flag in an
American state.
We are particularly grateful to
ihe students of Yale University
who have taken time from their
studies and traveled long dis
tances to assist in these efforts.
II is of course a pity that it should
be necessary for people to make
such sacrifices'in our country at
Ibis late date, but it is wonderful
lo know thai Ihere are many pre
pared to flo so as long as it may
be necessary.
A "mock vote" held in Mississippi to afford Negro citizens an
opportunity to express their views has reached a crucial period. The
vote is being held simultaneously with the "legal" gubernatorial
election.
The mock campaign, known as the "Aaron Henry for Governor"

campaign, was (ho product of the
failure to secure Negro registra
tion in the "legal election." On
October 6, a convention of civil
rights organizations working in
Mississippi nominated Henry for
Governor. Henry is a 42 year-old
Negro pharmacist and President
of the State NAACP. Negro vot
ers who would be qualified to vote
in other states of the Union will
cast ballots in the mock election
in order to express their desire to
vote, their inability to register
for the "legal election," and their
opposition to the candidates run
ning.
THE SAMK TYPE of brutal in
timidation that prevented Negro
voter registration legally has been
blocking the Henry for Governor
campaign. A rally scheduled for
last Friday night at a church in
Yazoo city was cancelled "after
grossest intimidation of local Ne
groes," according to a note jotted
on a rally announcement by a
campaign worker.
Sixty Yale students are ex
pected to bo in Mississippi by the
end of the week. Of the first fif
teen which arrived last week, six
were in jail within thirty-six
hours. They are being released
on $100 bail. They are being
picked up on minor traffic viola
tions. loitering, curfew violations.
Professor All ar d Lowenstein,
chairman of the advisory commit
tee of the campaign was arrested
and jailed this week-end for walk
ing across a street at 1:30 in the
morning a curfew violation.
Another group of Stanford stu
dents left yesterday afternoon;
their names were not available to
the Daily at publication time, but
will be included in future news
of the event.
Yesterday morning four Stan
ford students loft for Mississippi.
Fred Goff. a junior majoring in
history and political science; Holt
Ruffin. a sophomore; Hugh
Smith, a senior philosophy major;
and Dennis Sweeney, a junior his
tory major left by car for cam
paign work in Mississippi. Goff
is President of the Latin America
House, Smith is a sponsor in
Otero, and Sweeney is a Cedro
sponsor and speaker of the Stan
ford Student Congress.
FUNDS ARE currently needed
for the campaign itself — publi
city, office supplies, balloting ex
penses — and for bail bonds. It
is most likely that all contributors
to the bail bond fund will have
all money returned to them with
in eight to twelve months. Con
tributors may indicate for which
fund they would like their money
used. Checks may bo made out
to the "Aaron Henry for Gover
nor" campaign. The address of
campaign headquarters is 1072
Lynch Street, Room 10, Jackson,
Mississippi, zip code 39203. Groups
of checks may bo left in the edi
tor's box at the Stanford Daily;
a registered letter will bo sent to
Mississippi by the Daily every
day containing all checks received.
After word of the state of the
vote was received by tho Daily
yesterday morning, an informal
collection wielded close to $330

from one Florence Moore House,
one Wilbur House, one fraternity,
the Stanford Daily staff, and per
sonal visits to some faculty

anyone not willing to support
white rule.
This "way of life" can he called
the "Mississippi way of life" only
in the sense that it is enforced by
Ihe State of Mississippi in viola
tion of the Constitution of the
United States. But in a larger
sense it is unfair to call this the
Mississippi way of life because,
as the people who run the State
well know, it could not survive
the test of a free election. That
is why these people will not allow
a free election to be held.
THE EFFORT to present an al
tentative to the current situation
lias come to be centered in I h e
candidacies of Dr. Aaron Henry
and Rev. R. Edwin King.
Campaign workers for 1 h e s e
candidates have discovered that
it is impossible to function in
Mississippi with the minimum
safeguards of any free society.
People are arrested for distribut
ing leaflets, for violating curfews
while trying to enter hotels, for
committing the most imaginative
variety of non-existent traffic vio
lations. Ministers who offer the
use of church facilities for work
ers are told — sometimes by pri
vate citizens, but more frequently
by officials of the community —
not to "let it happen again."
In short, the atmosphere of this
campaign suggests more nearly
what a campaign might be like
in the Soviet Union or Cuba un
der communism than in the
United Stales of America. In such
a situation, the courage of the
people who are continuing their
efforts in the campaign cannot
fail to impress and move those of
us who have arrived from other
parts of the United States.
WE SHALL tell what we have
found in Mississippi wherever we
go when we leave and we shall
not leave until we have seen
through the rest of this dismal
affair. We shall submit evidence
of what we have found to the
Civil Rights Commission and to
Members of the Congress of the
United Stales in the faith that,
the American people, once they
know the facts, will not long be
willing to allow tyranny to wrap
itself in ihe American flag in an
American state.
We are particularly grateful to
ihe students of Yale University
who have taken time from their
studies and traveled long dis
tances to assist in these efforts.
II is of course a pity that it should
be necessary for people to make
such sacrifices'in our country at
Ibis late date, but it is wonderful
lo know thai Ihere are many pre
pared to flo so as long as it may
be necessary.
A "mock vote" held in Mississippi to afford Negro citizens an
opportunity to express their views has reached a crucial period. The
vote is being held simultaneously with the "legal" gubernatorial
election.
The mock campaign, known as the "Aaron Henry for Governor"

campaign, was (ho product of the
failure to secure Negro registra
tion in the "legal election." On
October 6, a convention of civil
rights organizations working in
Mississippi nominated Henry for
Governor. Henry is a 42 year-old
Negro pharmacist and President
of the State NAACP. Negro vot
ers who would be qualified to vote
in other states of the Union will
cast ballots in the mock election
in order to express their desire to
vote, their inability to register
for the "legal election," and their
opposition to the candidates run
ning.
THE SAMK TYPE of brutal in
timidation that prevented Negro
voter registration legally has been
blocking the Henry for Governor
campaign. A rally scheduled for
last Friday night at a church in
Yazoo city was cancelled "after
grossest intimidation of local Ne
groes," according to a note jotted
on a rally announcement by a
campaign worker.
Sixty Yale students are ex
pected to bo in Mississippi by the
end of the week. Of the first fif
teen which arrived last week, six
were in jail within thirty-six
hours. They are being released
on $100 bail. They are being
picked up on minor traffic viola
tions. loitering, curfew violations.
Professor All ar d Lowenstein,
chairman of the advisory commit
tee of the campaign was arrested
and jailed this week-end for walk
ing across a street at 1:30 in the
morning a curfew violation.
Another group of Stanford stu
dents left yesterday afternoon;
their names were not available to
the Daily at publication time, but
will be included in future news
of the event.
Yesterday morning four Stan
ford students loft for Mississippi.
Fred Goff. a junior majoring in
history and political science; Holt
Ruffin. a sophomore; Hugh
Smith, a senior philosophy major;
and Dennis Sweeney, a junior his
tory major left by car for cam
paign work in Mississippi. Goff
is President of the Latin America
House, Smith is a sponsor in
Otero, and Sweeney is a Cedro
sponsor and speaker of the Stan
ford Student Congress.
FUNDS ARE currently needed
for the campaign itself — publi
city, office supplies, balloting ex
penses — and for bail bonds. It
is most likely that all contributors
to the bail bond fund will have
all money returned to them with
in eight to twelve months. Con
tributors may indicate for which
fund they would like their money
used. Checks may bo made out
to the "Aaron Henry for Gover
nor" campaign. The address of
campaign headquarters is 1072
Lynch Street, Room 10, Jackson,
Mississippi, zip code 39203. Groups
of checks may bo left in the edi
tor's box at the Stanford Daily;
a registered letter will bo sent to
Mississippi by the Daily every
day containing all checks received.
After word of the state of the
vote was received by tho Daily
yesterday morning, an informal
collection wielded close to $330

from one Florence Moore House,
one Wilbur House, one fraternity,
the Stanford Daily staff, and per
sonal visits to some faculty
homes. The majority of checks
were made out to Advisory Com
mittee Chairman Allard Lowen
stein to use where most needed.
Campaign manager Bob Moses
stated in a letter to Lowenstein,
"The Freedom Ballot will show
that if Negroes had the right to
vote without fear of physical vio
lence and other reprisals, they
would do so. It will also show
that not only are they protesting
the obstacles to voting, but that
they have a program and candi
dates in which they believe. It is
our belief that this program is in
the best interest of all the people
of Mississippi, black and white,
and that our candidates are the
best qualified to fill the offices
sought.
". . . We will not be able to
utilize the basic information
media, nor to print and mail out
basic campaign materials, unless
funds arrive almost immediately.
The need is thus desperate, and
we would be deeply grateful for
any help that you may be able to
get for us in this campaign."
As soon as the Stanford stu
dents arrive in Mississippi they
will send tapes and news copy
each day to the Daily and to
KZSU.

through the rest of this dismal
affair. We shall submit evidence
of what we have found to the
Civil Rights Commission and to
Members of the Congress of the
United Stales in the faith that,
the American people, once they
know the facts, will not long be
willing to allow tyranny to wrap
itself in ihe American flag in an
American state.
We are particularly grateful to
ihe students of Yale University
who have taken time from their
studies and traveled long dis
tances to assist in these efforts.
II is of course a pity that it should
be necessary for people to make
such sacrifices'in our country at
Ibis late date, but it is wonderful
lo know thai Ihere are many pre
pared to flo so as long as it may
be necessary.
