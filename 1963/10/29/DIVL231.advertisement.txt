The Priests of the Living Church
"But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,
God's own poeple, that you may declare the wonderful deeds of
Him who called you out of darkness into His marvellous light."
I Peter, 2:9.
Every Christian is a priest of the true church of Jesus Christ.
This means that he is enjoying full and complete access to God
and all the privileges of priesthood, which the unbeliever does
not enjoy. The believer-priest offers sacrifices of devotion,
service and self to God and acts as intercessor between God and
all of mankind. As a priest of the universal church every spirit
s ually born believer rests confident that his prayers are heard
and his presence before God justified by the shed blood of
i Christ.
j "Since then it is by faith that we are justified, let us grasp the !
i fact that we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
j Through him we have confidently entered into this new rela-
J tionship of grace, and here we take our stand, in happy certainty
j of the glorious things he has for us in the future." Rom. 5: 1-2.
' While the Old Testament priests were born at physical birth into
j the priesthood, so the believer today is born into the present-age
priesthood when he commits his life to Jesus Christ,
i "Therefore my brothers, I implore you by God's mercy to offer
your very selves to him; a living sacrifice, dedicated and fit for
his acceptance, the worship offered by mind and heart. Adapt
i yourselves no longer to the pattern of this present world, but
let your minds be remade and your whole nature thus trans
formed. Then you will be able to discern the will of God and to
know what is good, and acceptable, and perfect." Rom. 12: 1-2
