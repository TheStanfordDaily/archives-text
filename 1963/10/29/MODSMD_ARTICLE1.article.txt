# Worsening Mississippi Conditions Cause Needs Change
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
After four phone calls from
Mississippi headquarters, th e
number of Stanford students leav
ing for Mississippi was cut to
10 yesterday making a total of
14 students.
The number of student cam
paign workers was held down to

people with financial resources 11
to provide bail for themselves and
several trips back to Mississippi i
for court processing.
A CONVERSATION with Cam
paign Advisory Committee Chair
i man Allard Lowenstein and Cam
paign Manager Bob Moses re
vealed that the Mississippi situa
tion had taken such a turn fori
the worse yesterday that the nor
mal demand for campaign work
ers had to bo cut off and replaced |
by people with complete financial i
backing or special skills.
The changes in Mississippi that
demanded the cutback of enter-;
ing Northerners are highlighted !
by the action of the chicf of:
police of Hattiesburg, Mississippi.
According to Lowenstein and ;
Moses, the chief stated that any j
"white agitator" entering the city 1
will be jailed for 6 months and j
fined $500. Further conversations i
revealed that four Yale students j
in Clarksdale were told that if j
they appeared once more in the |
Negro area of town they would j
be jailed.
DUE TO THIS complete block-1
ing off of cities, the number of
campaign workers that can be
absorbed at minimum chance of:
arrest is drastically cut. Lowen-1

stein stressed the gratitude of the
Jackson workers for the desire
of the students to come, but added
that the worsening of conditions
changes the needs in Mississippi.
After the 5:30 rally the num
ber of students planning to go
from Stanford was high. Plans
were under way for buses to be
subsidized round - trip. Lowen
stein's statement that busload of
students would invariably be ar
rested and bring about a severe
drain on civil rights fun d s
changed the plan of action by
9:00 yesterday evening.
The spirit of co-operation on
the project throughout all seg
ments of the campus was in
dicated by a meeting of Women's
Council and Dean of Women Lu
cille Allen which worked out a
system to permit Stanford women
to go to Mississippi if the need
a rised.
ACCORDING TO A statement
released to the Daily by Women's
Council mcmher Marion Leib,
women must give notification of
confirmation of hotel or SNCC
or CORE accommodations. Con
firmation must also be received
of parents' knowledge—not neces
sarily consent —of the trip.
These confirmations must go
to either the office of the Dean
of Women, or to one of the five
members of Women's Council:
Karen Booth, Vicki Gantz. Judy
Gilpin. Marian Leib. or Sally Pey
ton. Both confirmations must go
to the same person.
Lowenstein stressed that the
most immediate demands now are
funds to arrive by this Saturday,
demand of action on the Congress
floor, and national publicity. Stu
dents are urged to contact their
congressmen and their hometown
newspapers of Mississippi events.
SEN. WAYNE MORSE (D-Ore. ■
has promised action on the Sen
ate floor, according to Lowenstein,
and Oregon students are urged
to phone him to tell of Stanford
activities and their support.
Lowenstein will come to cam
pus in December to organize sum

mcr programs for students inter
ested in working in Mississippi
under more organized conditions.
Among the Stanford students
who left tiiis evening were four
Zeta Psi men: senior political sci
ence major Frank Dubofsky, se
nior history major Anson Garn
sey, sophomore Russian major
Tony King, and sophomore his
tory major George Maentz. The
six others from Stanford who
left after the Wilbur rally last
night were senior history and
political science major Lawrence
Deßivort, junior political science
and humanities major Ken Iver
son, freshman religion major Jeff
Dennis-Straethmeyer, graduate in
political science Steve Lesser,
frosh pre-med student Didier Mil
haud, and sophomore history ma
jor Terry Taketa.

After four phone calls from

14 students.
The number of student cam

people with financial resources 11
to provide bail for themselves and
several trips back to Mississippi i
for court processing.
A CONVERSATION with Cam
paign Advisory Committee Chair
i man Allard Lowenstein and Cam
paign Manager Bob Moses re
vealed that the Mississippi situa
tion had taken such a turn fori
the worse yesterday that the nor
mal demand for campaign work
ers had to bo cut off and replaced |
by people with complete financial i
backing or special skills.
The changes in Mississippi that
demanded the cutback of enter-;
ing Northerners are highlighted !
by the action of the chicf of:
police of Hattiesburg, Mississippi.
According to Lowenstein and ;
Moses, the chief stated that any j
"white agitator" entering the city 1
will be jailed for 6 months and j
fined $500. Further conversations i
revealed that four Yale students j
in Clarksdale were told that if j
they appeared once more in the |
Negro area of town they would j
be jailed.
DUE TO THIS complete block-1
ing off of cities, the number of
campaign workers that can be
absorbed at minimum chance of:
arrest is drastically cut. Lowen-1

stein stressed the gratitude of the
Jackson workers for the desire
of the students to come, but added
that the worsening of conditions
changes the needs in Mississippi.
After the 5:30 rally the num
ber of students planning to go
from Stanford was high. Plans
were under way for buses to be
subsidized round - trip. Lowen
stein's statement that busload of
students would invariably be ar
rested and bring about a severe
drain on civil rights fun d s
changed the plan of action by
9:00 yesterday evening.
The spirit of co-operation on
the project throughout all seg
ments of the campus was in
dicated by a meeting of Women's
Council and Dean of Women Lu
cille Allen which worked out a
system to permit Stanford women
to go to Mississippi if the need
a rised.
ACCORDING TO A statement
released to the Daily by Women's
Council mcmher Marion Leib,
women must give notification of
confirmation of hotel or SNCC
or CORE accommodations. Con
firmation must also be received
of parents' knowledge—not neces
sarily consent —of the trip.
These confirmations must go
to either the office of the Dean
of Women, or to one of the five
members of Women's Council:
Karen Booth, Vicki Gantz. Judy
Gilpin. Marian Leib. or Sally Pey
ton. Both confirmations must go
to the same person.
Lowenstein stressed that the
most immediate demands now are
funds to arrive by this Saturday,
demand of action on the Congress
floor, and national publicity. Stu
dents are urged to contact their
congressmen and their hometown
newspapers of Mississippi events.

were under way for buses to be
subsidized round - trip. Lowen
stein's statement that busload of
students would invariably be ar
rested and bring about a severe
drain on civil rights fun d s
changed the plan of action by
9:00 yesterday evening.
The spirit of co-operation on
the project throughout all seg
ments of the campus was in
dicated by a meeting of Women's
Council and Dean of Women Lu
cille Allen which worked out a
system to permit Stanford women
to go to Mississippi if the need
a rised.
ACCORDING TO A statement
released to the Daily by Women's
Council mcmher Marion Leib,
women must give notification of
confirmation of hotel or SNCC
or CORE accommodations. Con
firmation must also be received
of parents' knowledge—not neces
sarily consent —of the trip.
These confirmations must go
to either the office of the Dean
of Women, or to one of the five
members of Women's Council:
Karen Booth, Vicki Gantz. Judy
Gilpin. Marian Leib. or Sally Pey
ton. Both confirmations must go
to the same person.
Lowenstein stressed that the
most immediate demands now are
funds to arrive by this Saturday,
demand of action on the Congress
floor, and national publicity. Stu
dents are urged to contact their
congressmen and their hometown
newspapers of Mississippi events.
SEN. WAYNE MORSE (D-Ore. ■
has promised action on the Sen
ate floor, according to Lowenstein,
and Oregon students are urged
to phone him to tell of Stanford
activities and their support.
Lowenstein will come to cam
pus in December to organize sum

mcr programs for students inter
ested in working in Mississippi
under more organized conditions.

After four phone calls from
Mississippi headquarters, th e
number of Stanford students leav
ing for Mississippi was cut to
10 yesterday making a total of
14 students.
The number of student cam
paign workers was held down to

people with financial resources 11
to provide bail for themselves and
several trips back to Mississippi i
for court processing.
A CONVERSATION with Cam
paign Advisory Committee Chair
i man Allard Lowenstein and Cam
paign Manager Bob Moses re
vealed that the Mississippi situa
tion had taken such a turn fori
the worse yesterday that the nor
mal demand for campaign work
ers had to bo cut off and replaced |
by people with complete financial i
backing or special skills.
The changes in Mississippi that
demanded the cutback of enter-;
ing Northerners are highlighted !
by the action of the chicf of:
police of Hattiesburg, Mississippi.
According to Lowenstein and ;
Moses, the chief stated that any j
"white agitator" entering the city 1
will be jailed for 6 months and j
fined $500. Further conversations i
revealed that four Yale students j
in Clarksdale were told that if j
they appeared once more in the |
Negro area of town they would j
be jailed.
DUE TO THIS complete block-1
ing off of cities, the number of
campaign workers that can be
absorbed at minimum chance of:
arrest is drastically cut. Lowen-1

stein stressed the gratitude of the
Jackson workers for the desire
of the students to come, but added
that the worsening of conditions
changes the needs in Mississippi.
