Financial support for this bur

and industry, but also from in
dividuals interested in the Middle
East area. In short, support
comes from American citizens de

can way of life to the peoples of
the Middle East, and conversely,
interpreting the realities and as
pirations of life in the Middle
East to Americans.
THE WORK of the American
Friends of the Middle East is di
vided into four main categories:
• Educational Services notably
student counseling, trainee pro
gramming, placement, and aid of
various kinds. More than 15,000
student visitors were interviewed

in AFME field offices during
1961-62. and some 100 of them
were assisted through placement
in American educational institu
tions. More than $146,000 was
arranged for or granted directly
by AFME, in scholarship assist
ance, during the last academic
year.
• Technical Training, in Ameri
can methods and techniques of
industry, for specially qualified
nationals of the Middle East and
North Africa. For example, more
than twenty "senior trainees"
were assisted in professions rang
ing from soil conservation 1 Al
geria 1. international banking pro
cedures (Syria', to hospital ad
ministration (in the U.A.R.). dur
ing 1961-62.
• Information Services: AFME
headquarters in Washington. D.C..
have an expanding list of publica
tions, a library of some 5,000
hoiinrl hnoks neriodieals. a n d

pamphlets, a catalogue of films
on North Africa and the Middle
East, and research files. A well
illustrated monthly periodical,
"Viewpoints," publishes many in
teresting and timely articles.
• Cultural Exchange, which is
fostered in two different ways.
Programs arc worked out in this
country for visitors from the Mid
dle East who represent all levels
of academic and professional life,
including government officials.
Secondly, exhibitions of arts and
crafts are organized under AFME
sponsorship, as well as film pro
grams and lectures.
In all they do. officials of the
American Friends of the Middle
East operate with the maximum
flexibility and imagination, and
their emphasis is always on per
sonalized service. Every program
and project, moreover, is sub
jected to a fundamental test:
"Does ii meet a real need?"

by AFME, in scholarship assist

• Technical Training, in Ameri

industry, for specially qualified
nationals of the Middle East and
North Africa. For example, more

were assisted in professions rang
