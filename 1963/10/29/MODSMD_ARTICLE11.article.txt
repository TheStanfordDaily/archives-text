# Mississippi Campaign: Education Experience
## 
### 
Few things have aroused the whirl-wind of soul-searching
that has come to campus with the news of the straits of the
Misssissippi mock election. The financial response has been
overwhelming, although further money mailed in from dona
tions today might make the crucial difference in the fate
of the campaign.
Stanford University has had an image, an image of a self
centered and wealthy student body, calmly basking in a world
of sun, blue skies, palm trees, and sandstone. That students
leave during mid-term week for work in Mississippi, that
students staying on campus pass mid-term week raising money
for the campaign is action which proves an identification on
the part of a large segment of the Stanford student body that
is both broader and deeper that tradition would have us
suspect.
The time spent in working on the Mississippi campaign
is not something estranged from the educational experience.
One Stanford faculty member said Sunday night, as he was
approached by two students working for the campaign, "1
can't believe that anything could take precedence over an
examination for a Stanford student. It's a good thing to see.
One receives an education not in order to possess a group
of facts, but to learn the thought processes, the values, the
spectrum of concern of the truly educated man. To face the
questions of the situation in Mississippi, one's relation to it,
the mock election as a mode of political action, individual
responsibility to (lie Mississippi citizen, is to meet the educa
tional process squarely.
The students who are suffering on examinations because
this campaign are not sacrificing; they are gaining as much
as or more than they are giving to the campaign. No student
who has entered the homes of Stanford faculty members,
seen their concern over the Mississippi situation, and watched
them contribute generously can feel that involvement in this
activity is in any way at odds with our purposes in attending
this universitv. It is the epitome of them.
