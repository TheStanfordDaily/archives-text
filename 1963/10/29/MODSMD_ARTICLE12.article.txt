ROTC
Editor, The Daily:
A rousing "second!" to HOLLY
CIIENERY'S brilliant proposal to
do away with ROTC at STAN
FORD. I, for one, am hoping that
she'll push on with similar logic
and anlogy to over-more-sweeping
proposals. Having discovered that
war and violence can bo elimi
nated just by not thinking about
them, I'm hoping she'll focus her
analytical talent on disease, fa
mine and natural disaster.
We ought to do away with the
study and practice of medicine
altogether because disease is cer
tainly distasteful to us sensitive
and aware individuals. The trouble
with the damn doctors is that they
systematize disease; they make
their living off of human suffer
ing (the blackguards!). Don't
they realize that if they would
just leave it alone we could each
suffer in our own individual way
and die sensitively and individ
ually aware of our undiagnosed
pain? And while we're at it, how
about those lousy engineers and
scientists forming up in veritable
regimental ranks to attack the
problems of sanitation, irrigation,
transportation, et ceteration! Pic
ture them memorizing rote formu
lae and drilling in tare you
ready?) the "discipline" of their
field. And right here on campus!
Make your blood boil? Well 1
should say. One more thing; the
sociologists, anthropologists and
political scientists are fiddling
with my individual sensitivity
and awareness in what I consider
a wholly subversive and organized
fashion. I'll excuse the historians
and philosophers for the moment
but I reserve the right to come
back to them if they get out of
line. (Make that, "if they get into
line.)
Yes sir. I agree with HOLLY
CHENERY, we ought not to let
those military guys get any edu
cation. Let them stick to their
indoctrination, or whatever they
call it, and let them do it some
where else. "After all," as my
old peace-marching buddy used
to say, "what's the use of being
dumb if you can't be a soldier?"

Editor, The Daily:
In answer to Miss Chenery I
can only say that I too wish that
people could spend their time hap
pily flitting about tossing roses.
Then the breezes of intellectual
freedom could caress students sit
ting on hillsides while discussing
their impressions of self and of
environment. Unfortunately the
history of "civilization" has been
continually linked with organized
killing of individuals. Unfortun
ately our lot is not only one of
gleaning impressions from our en
vironment, but also of having to
bear the circumstances of that
environment. Unfortunately while
groups of "intellectuals" sit dis
cussing topics such as how nice

it would be if man were humane,
other groups of "dullwits" become
warmongers, because of such tri
via as clashes of ideas and im
balances in wealth or necessities
of life. Unfortunately as long as
there are warmongers, truly
peaceful people cannot survive as
neighbors.
I would suggest that before you,
Miss Chenery, condemn our edu
cational institutions for providing
the leaders for the organized kill
ing of individuals, you should re
move such things as egotism,
selfishness, and aggressiveness
from human personality and then
make every man on earth eco
nomically and socially so happy
that he would want for nothing.
Then perhaps it would not be
necessary to keep standing arm
ies for both offense and defense.
Then perhaps there would be no
warlike men; the earth could be
covered with peaceful, contented
souls. Then perhaps there would
not be encroachment of military
attitudes and training into the
lives of students, and they could
pursue truth and knowledge with
out hindrance in that happiest of
all possible worlds.

PEACE CORPS
Editor, The Daily:
As one of the "generation that
grew up before the recent fer
ment of dedicated idealism among
American young people," I want
to point out to Mr. Callison, Stan
ford, Class of '63, that if it hadn't
been for the rugged idealism and
devotion of my generation, which
had to fight for what it believed
in, he might not be here to grump
and grouse! He implies that we
were stolid clods because we took
part in a holocaust not of o u r
making. Evidently he has n o t
been taught that we were as
starry-eyed as he, believed in
Wendell Willkie and One World,
and deplored the degradation of
poverty and injustice.
Perhaps Mr. Callison should
present us with halos, for we
worked at the migrant labor
camps, picked sugar beets and
walnuts when the pickers had
gone to war, gave blood, sold
bonds, put up with rationing (has
Mr. Callison ever gone without
sugar and shoes?), saw our
fathers, brothers and friends go
off to war, and NEVER had a
sports car!
Our idealism was tested in a
far different crusible from that
which Mr. Callison has faced. We
were not afraid to get out and
dig in the earth or take our places
in the dismal factories, even
though we felt our individual
efforts were drops in the bucket
compared with our beautiful
fancies of saving the world
through lengthy discussions of
what the world should be.
The psychologists who inter
view prospective Peace Corps
members are interested in sepa
rating the wheat from the chaff.
They want to find young people
who are REALISTIC dreamers:
those who will get down from
their soap boxes and do the dirty
work, hard and uncompromising,
without giving up their idealism
because they cannot be fair
haired messiahs. You who would
field a shovel instead of a gun—
volunteer and you will be ac
cepted!
