### FOSTER HIRSCH Drama Editor 
''The House of Bernarda Alba." the current presentation of the
Actor's Workshop at its Encore Theare, is Hie undoubted masterpiece
of the Spanish poet-playwright, Federico Garcia-Lorca. In the play,
Lorca forsakes his customary lyricism for a rigid austerity. Situation
and dialogue are grim and sparse, with flashes of black humor high
lighting the awesome solemnity.
Lorca's play is intensely Spanish in theme, mood, and setting,
and contains distinct political and religious protests. Bernarda, bound
to an inflexible tradition of pride and aristocratic class consciousness,
tyrannically dominates her five daughters. In her obsession to pro
tect Ihem from a contaminating world, Bernarda represses their
humanity in a cloister-like atmosphere. Enclosed behind shuttered
windows, a normal life of ordinary emotions has been mercilessly
denied the daughters; consequently, they invest the town Romeo,
Pepe El Romano, with a distorted majesty and cloak him in the charm
and mystery of vagueness. His betrothal to Augu.stias, the oldest
daughter and therefore heiress to a considerable fortune, sets oft a
chan of hatred and envy among them all.
THE ACTOR'S WORKSHOP production succeeds in capturing the
severity and bleakness of this household. The well-integrated techni
cal elements of the performance combine to underscore the play's
theme. The set, which consists of plain white walls and an oppres
sively low ceiling, suggests at once the false purity and prison-like
suffocation which Bernarda's tyranny imposes. The costumes of
mourning black worn by the members of the household reflect the
moral darkness of the characters themselves. The ceiling, done in
a low key, sustains the atmosphere of a pervasive darkness. Too, the
rigid antique Spanish furniture calls forth the characters' morbid
repression. The slow, precise pace, under Lee Breuer's firm direc
tion, incorporate all the technical apparatus into a meaningful state
ment of the nunnery-like routine by which Bernarda rules her small
world.
Beatrice Manley's Bernarda is an aria of evil: studiedly super
cilious, she has throughout a mocking smile; her deliberate gestures,
her haughty carriage, her passionless voice, the venom with which
she delivers her astringent dialogue, are all manifestations of her
willful, destructive pride. Not for a moment does Miss Manley indi
cate that her character is invested with so much as an ounce of com
passion.
THE DAUGHTERS, played individually with varying skill, never
theless manage as an ensemble to create beneath their placid exterior
an undercurrent of restlessness and accumulated frustration which
culminates in a frenzy of hatred and bitterness. Peggy Doyle as
Angustias is vastly amusing as she lines out the total artlessness of
her character. Winifred Mann's rebellious, serpent-tongued Magda
lena specializes in dirty looks that are unsurpassed for sheer malevol
ence. Martirio, the snivelling hunchback, and the obedient, colorless
Adelia are performed by Ruth Bluer and Kay Williams, who are
made to appear as frightening and sinister and their parts truly
demand. Adcla, the youngest and only attractive daughter, deter
mined to escape from her nightmarish imprisonment, is not well
played by Susan Darby, a wooden actress who calls our attention
to herself as an actress rather lhan to the character she is portraying.
Rhoda Gemignani and Shirley Jae Wagner's earthy servants offer
a telling contrast to the twisted abnormality of the house in which
they endlessly labor.
The Actor's Workshop, although not quite so polished as a more
wealthy, strictly professional company, offers in their carefully
selected repertoire a superb training ground for ambitious and con
scientious actors. "The House of Bernarda Alba" is the first offering
of the 1963-64 season, and if it's an indication of what's to come,
San Francisco can look forward to some veiy distinguished theatre
indeed.
