# USC, FULLERTON LATEST VICTIMS
## Poloists Run Skein to Twelve 
### BILL PRACHAR 
Stanford's great water polo
team, led by the offensive punch
of Marty Hull and Pete Pettigrew,
recovered quickly from a shaky
first quarter to defeat USC 11-6
on Friday afternoon. The victory,
witnessed by a packed house of
900, marked the first time that
the Indians have beaten SC since
1953. The win gave Stanford an
11-0 mark on the season and
vaulted them into the conference
lead.
FROM THE OPENING sprint
to the final gun the game was a
tight contest between two great
teams. The opening sprint saw
All-American Marty Hull beat
NCAA 100-yard freestyle cham
pion Perry Linberg to mid-pool
and control the ball. Early Stan
ford passes missed their marks
and Linberg and Miller were able
to score for SC. Hull broke the ice
for the Cards with about three
minutes gone in t{ie quarter by
scoring on a short shot from the
hole. Ail-American .Roy Sarri
came right back for the Trojans
with his patented roll-out in front
of the net to make the score 3-1.
The Indians shook off the "jit
lers" with about two minutes left
in the quarter and started con
trolling the ball. This caused SC
to foul which helped the Cards
in two ways. First, two of the
Trojan starters got into serious
foul trouble. Second, the fouling
gave ihe Cards a chance to set
up the play which ultimately de
cided the game the quick shot
after a foul.
BILL READY, fouled in the
corner, lofted his free toss to
Pettigrew who slammed the first
of his five goals. Pete said after
the game that the "closed stuff"
made the difference in the con
test. Pete scored four goals and
Hull two on the short shot after
a foul. With five seconds left in
the first period Pettigrew scored
again to knot the score at 3-3.
Although Linberg won the open
ing sprint of the second quarter,
Stanford quickly took control,
with Don Buehler doing a tre
mendous defensive job on the al
ways dangerous Sarri. Sopho
more Mike Eshleman put the In
dians ahead for keeps with an
outside shot early in the quarter.
Hull widened the gap to 5-3 with
a beautiful, blind backhand shot.
McGeagh came back and scored
for SC and the crowd sensed a
high scoring battle.
FOULS, HOWEVER, a g a in
came into play. Two of the SC
starters fouled out and Hull and
Pettigrew each scored another
goal on the short shot after a
free toss from Ready. Sarri

scored once more and the half j
ended 7-5 with Stanford in tho
lead.
The third quarter was all Stan
ford. Although Linberg won tho i
sprint, and Sarri scored a quick 1
goal, the Indian defense really;
| took hold. SC was unable to score !
for the remainder of the game. I
Only outstanding net work by!
Trojan goalie Nolan kept the
Cards from running wild as USC
fouled out two more starters try- j
ing to stop the potent Stanford '
attack.
BRIAN BECK and Ron Kovas
came in at ihe start of the fourth
quarter to replace two of the tired
starters. Hull won the sprint and
Pettigrew scored off the SC
: goalie's head for the eleventh and
final tally for Stanford. Petti
grew and Ready fouled out early
in the quarter followed by Hull
;with two minutes left in the
game. With 1:36 showing on the
! clock Coach Gaughran put in the
reserves. The first team was
j given a standing ovation by the
! crowd. The final score was 11-6.
Coach Gaughran was pleased
with the performance of the
j whole team. He lauded the net
j play of goalie George Stranski.
; He also made special note of the
: two Sophomores who played most
| of the game, Jeff Beck and Mike
i Eshleman.
GEORGE STRANSKY, Indian
| goalie, admitted that the whole
team was "nervous as heck" at
the start of the game and that it
took a while for them to get mov
ing.
Stanford was 11-34 (32 pet
cent) in shooting, while SC was
0-26 123 per cent). Hull was 5-12

and Pettigrew was 5-13.
SATURDAY MORNING the

apiece. Next Saturday the polo
ists face Long Beach State in a

Stanford's great water polo
team, led by the offensive punch
of Marty Hull and Pete Pettigrew,

USC GOALIE Bill Nolcin blocks an attempted Indian shot while two
swimmers fight for position in front of the net. Eleven shots eluded
Nolan as Stanford won 1 1-6.
Stanford's great water polo
team, led by the offensive punch
of Marty Hull and Pete Pettigrew,
recovered quickly from a shaky
first quarter to defeat USC 11-6
on Friday afternoon. The victory,
witnessed by a packed house of
900, marked the first time that
the Indians have beaten SC since
1953. The win gave Stanford an
11-0 mark on the season and
vaulted them into the conference
lead.
FROM THE OPENING sprint
to the final gun the game was a
tight contest between two great
teams. The opening sprint saw
All-American Marty Hull beat
NCAA 100-yard freestyle cham
pion Perry Linberg to mid-pool
and control the ball. Early Stan
ford passes missed their marks
and Linberg and Miller were able
to score for SC. Hull broke the ice
for the Cards with about three
minutes gone in t{ie quarter by
scoring on a short shot from the
hole. Ail-American .Roy Sarri
came right back for the Trojans
with his patented roll-out in front
of the net to make the score 3-1.
The Indians shook off the "jit
lers" with about two minutes left
in the quarter and started con
trolling the ball. This caused SC
to foul which helped the Cards
in two ways. First, two of the
Trojan starters got into serious
foul trouble. Second, the fouling
gave ihe Cards a chance to set
up the play which ultimately de
cided the game the quick shot
after a foul.
BILL READY, fouled in the
corner, lofted his free toss to
Pettigrew who slammed the first
of his five goals. Pete said after
the game that the "closed stuff"
made the difference in the con
test. Pete scored four goals and
Hull two on the short shot after
a foul. With five seconds left in
the first period Pettigrew scored
again to knot the score at 3-3.
Although Linberg won the open
ing sprint of the second quarter,
Stanford quickly took control,
with Don Buehler doing a tre
mendous defensive job on the al
ways dangerous Sarri. Sopho
more Mike Eshleman put the In
dians ahead for keeps with an
outside shot early in the quarter.
Hull widened the gap to 5-3 with
a beautiful, blind backhand shot.
McGeagh came back and scored
for SC and the crowd sensed a
high scoring battle.
FOULS, HOWEVER, a g a in
came into play. Two of the SC
starters fouled out and Hull and
Pettigrew each scored another
goal on the short shot after a
free toss from Ready. Sarri

scored once more and the half j
ended 7-5 with Stanford in tho
lead.
