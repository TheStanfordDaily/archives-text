# Penn Protests Ban on Wallace
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA (CPS) More
than 200 University of Pennsyl
vania students picketed and pro
tested the decision of the Penn
administration not to allow the
Daily Pennsylvania!!, the campus
newspaper, the use of one of tin?
campus auditoriums to sponsor a
speech by Alabama Governor
George C. Wallace.
The campus paper decided to
re-invite Wallace after the Law
School forum had earlier decided
it would be risking civil chaos by
sponsoring an address. The Penn
paper had been meeting with local
police officials and the Governor's
press seci-etary to work out the
arrangements for police protec
tion.
THE liKASOX given for denial
of auditorium usage was that
groups such ;is the campus chap
ter of the NAACP would no t
have enough time to arrange a
protest demonstration. This was
refuted by the NAACP in a letter
to the Daily Pennsylvanian this
morning from that group.
Wallace was a hot issue at an
other campus as well. The stu
dent activities committee, com
posed of varying amounts of stu
dents, faculty, and administration,
of Adelphi University (Garden
City, N.Y.i last night refused to
allow Walace to speak on the
Adelphi campus.
Miss RUTH SKINNER, chair
man of the committee, released
a statement to the Delphian, the
campus newspaper, explaining
the group's action. The letter
states that while "recognizing the
desireability of having various
points of view discused on cam
pus. the committee . . . feels that
Governor Wallace, by defiance of
the decision of the Supreme
Court, does not represent 1 h e
ideals and practices that we up
hold at Adelphi University."
Dr. Eddy, president of Adelphi,
in a press conference prior to the
student activities committee meet
ing, said about the proposed Wal
lace visit "If you think it will be
to your (the students) advantage
to get him here, and if you see
to it that the thing is balanced
and not just a way to create sen
sationalism. then have him here."
Richard Haley, national assist
ant of the Congress of Racial
Equality (CORE*, said "First of
all, I believe that the only way
we can demonstrate our regard
for the spirit of the first amend
ment of the Constitution is to al
low anyone the right to express
themselves."
