# More Leave for Mississippi;
## 
### HOPE SELBY BANNING GARRETT 
Ten more Stanford students
have left the university for Mis
sissippi to join other students
from Stanford and Yale in the
campaign to promote Negro voter
registration in the state.
To further the campaign, $2,200
was collected yesterday at a rally
hold last night in front of Wilbur
Hall and from students, faculty
members, and residents of the
Palo Alto area. These funds added
to the total of $900 collected from
students and faculty members on
Sunday, making the total contri
bution $3,100.
The campaign to increase the
Negro vote in Mississippi centers
around a mock election on No
vember 2, 3, and 4, supporting
Dr. Aaron Henry for state gov
ernor and Rev. R. Edwin K in g
for Lieutenant Governor. Dr.
Henry, a 42-year-old pharmacist,
is state president of the NAACP.
Ilev. King, a 27-year-old w hi t e
Methodist minister, is Chaplain
and Dean of Students at Touga
loo college. In addition to the
drive for 200,000 signatures of
unregistered Negroes anticipated
in the Freedom vote, there is a
campaign to write ; n Dr. Henry
and Rev. King on the regular bal
lot on November 5. Although
Negroes constitute fifty per cent
of Mississippi's population, less
than eight per cent are registered
to vote.
AT AN ORGANIZATIONAL
meeting held yesterdav afternoon

in Tresidder, Hone Strelitz, edi
tor of the Daily, and Bud Weden,
ASSU president, spoke on the
need for funds and student par
ticipation in the Mississippi cam
paign. Miss Strelitz stressed the
interest that student participa
tion would arouse in the national
press.
Wedin stated that he felt that
participation in this campaign
could be ultimately more signifi
cant than the march on Washing
ton last summer. Both empha
sized that they were speaking
neither as representatives of the
university nor in their capacity
as Editor of the Daily and ASSU
president.
Carolyn Egan and Ed Shaw
then discussed the plans for soli
citing contributions from students
and faculty members. All checks,
they said, should be made out to
the Stanford Henry for Governor
campaign, and no solicitations
may be made in Tresidder, nor
in any class without the presence
of the student police. All funds
collected should be given to the
ASSU Office.
LAST NIGHT three-hundred
people crowded into the Junipero
lounge to hear Wedin and Miss
Strelitz tell of the latest develop
ments in Mississippi.
SHE SAID the American pub
lic must be made aware of the
situation in Mississippi. "Negro
children should not have to be
killed in church bombings for the

brought to the attention of all

tor of the Daily, and Bud Weden,

need for funds and student par
ticipation in the Mississippi cam
paign. Miss Strelitz stressed the
interest that student participa
tion would arouse in the national
press.

university nor in their capacity
as Editor of the Daily and ASSU
president.

Strelitz tell of the latest develop
ments in Mississippi.
SHE SAID the American pub
lic must be made aware of the
situation in Mississippi. "Negro
children should not have to be
killed in church bombings for the
plight of Mississippi to be
brought to the attention of all
America."
