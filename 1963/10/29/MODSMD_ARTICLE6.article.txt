### 
United Press Inlenuitioiuil
WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court Monday turned down
Mobile's appeal from a school integration order which directed the
Alabama community to proceed with desegregation this fall.
The Mobile County school board had asked the high court to hold
hearings on its argument thai integration would seriously disrupt
the educational system that serves 75,000 children. The Supreme
Court rejected the request without comment.
Earlier this year, Justice Hugo L. Black had refused the school
board's request that the lower court order be stayed pending appeal.
Black, acting as an individual justice with jurisdiction over the fed
eral court invoked, bluntly commented that the board had known
for nine years that it was conducting its schools in an unconstitu
tional manner.
MOROCCANS REPEL INVADERS MARRAKECH, Morocco
The Moroccan government said Monday night its troops had driven
the Algerian army out of most disputed border areas and the Alger
ians were retreating south under Moroccan attack.
The victory claims came on the eve of the four-power African
summit conference which will try to end the border fighting which
flai-ed Oct. <S with Algerian attacks on the Sahara oases of Tinn
joub and Hassi Beida.
The government said "fighting is continuing" as the Moroccans
pursue Algerian troops into the desert. A spokesman said all troops
were cleared from the Hassi Beida area and that the Moroccans had
pushed out seven miles behind Tinnpoub. One group of Algerians
was reported falling back from Hassi Beida to a base at Tinfouchy
50 miles to the south.
WEST BERLIN CENTER VETOED BERLIN The Big Three
Western powers refused to back down on their veto of Soviet plans
to extend Communist influence by setting up a center in West Berlin,
a western spokesman said Monday.
The U.S., British and French ambassadors to West Germany re
affirmed their opposition in a letter rejecting the protests of Piotr
Abrasimov, Soviet ambassador to East Germany
In a letter last Sept. 28. Abrasimov protested the Western Allied
refusal to allow the Russians to establish a unified headquarters in
West Berlin by consolidating various commercial and cultural enter
prises in one building in the British sector. The building has been
Soviet property since 1923. He said the Western Allies had no right
to resist Soviet activity in West Berlin.

WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court Monday turned down
Mobile's appeal from a school integration order which directed the
Alabama community to proceed with desegregation this fall.
The Mobile County school board had asked the high court to hold
hearings on its argument thai integration would seriously disrupt
the educational system that serves 75,000 children. The Supreme
Court rejected the request without comment.
Earlier this year, Justice Hugo L. Black had refused the school
board's request that the lower court order be stayed pending appeal.
Black, acting as an individual justice with jurisdiction over the fed
eral court invoked, bluntly commented that the board had known
for nine years that it was conducting its schools in an unconstitu
tional manner.

flai-ed Oct. <S with Algerian attacks on the Sahara oases of Tinn
joub and Hassi Beida.

pushed out seven miles behind Tinnpoub. One group of Algerians
was reported falling back from Hassi Beida to a base at Tinfouchy
