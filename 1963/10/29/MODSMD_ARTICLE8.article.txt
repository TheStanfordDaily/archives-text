# Professor Katz Discusses Meaning, Place of Values
## 
### JAMES BRISCOE 
"What do values mean? How
do they function? Why do we
have them?" These are some of
the questions Dr. Joseph Katz,
professor of psychology, brought
up in his lecture "The Psychology
of Values," given yesterday after
noon at Tresidder.
"The base of the problem of
values is on human impulse,"
Katz stated. "These impulses are
difficult to control, so our con
trols or values do not work so
well sometimes."
I SING THi; psycho-analytical
theory developed by Freud and
, others, Dr. Katz showed how
i these impulses are originated in
childhood. "During the first five
years of a child's life these im
pulses are violent and aggres
sive." Katz said. "Then from
about six to twelve they become
much weaker." Dr. Katz said
that an infant develops these
| strong impulses because he
; wishes to take over powers which
are beyond his capacity. He
wishes to become a part of the
adult world he sees around him,
but is unable to do this.
'The two types of controls of
values are the super-ego and the
ego." Katz said. The super-ego
or conscience is engrained in chil
dren from about age six onward.
Dr. Katz said, howver, that early
education often misuses this type
of control. "This sometimes
makes us feel over-guilty and to
some extent injures our self-con
fidence," he said.
The ego control is based on a

growing sense of reality, Dr. Katx
stated, and it comes only through
maturity. It cannot bo developed
by children. Katz emphasized
thai "Controls often develop at a
time in life when we are not
! completely ready to use them."
"IT IS Very HAH!) to change
! values," Katz stated, "because to
do this we also need to have a
i change of personality." He em
phasized. however, that values
i could be changed by being open
to experience, and by associating
freely with people other than our
own kind.
Dr. Katz cited a survey taken
of 500 Stanford freshmen last
year to show the scope of value
judgments amo n g students,
j Three-hundred and fifty men and
i 130 women were asked to rank.
! in order, fourteen values they felt
i would give the most satisfaction
in later life.
The men ranked a career first
among these values while the
i women placed a family on top.
Family was second among men
and career fifth with women.
Both sexes ranked development
of personal ideas third. Love and
affection was fourth among men
and second among women. Sur
prisingly enough, the fifth choice
for men and the fourth among
women was time for thought and
reflection. Sex was ranked ninth
by both men and women and so
cial life and entertainment were
eleventh with men and thirteenth
with women. At the bottom of
the list for both sexes was home
improvement.
