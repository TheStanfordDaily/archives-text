# Moore Gives Impressions Of Soviet Life, Medicine
## 
### PHIL HEINRICHS 
"There is a great contrast between what exists in the Soviet Union
and the impression we get from the news media," stated Dr. William
W. Moore, research associate in microbiology, Stanford School of
Medicine, yesterday evening in a Tuesday Evening Series lecture
titled "Impressions of Medicine and Life in the Soviet Union."
"There is a great difference between the old Soviet citizen and
the young Soviet citizen," Dr. Moore also pointed out. The old per
sons were sometimes very much afraid to even give their names,
while the youths were not in general afraid to criticise even the
government. Dr. Moore talked to one student who told him that the
student stoning of the American embassy after troops were sent to
Lebanon was required attendance. 4-

DURING HIS STAY in Moscow
last year. Dr. Moore lived in hous
ing provided by the University of
Moscow. He remarked, "It was
surprising to find considerable
discrimination against African
students at the University."
Dr. Moore found the teaching
at the First Medical Institute to
be "very adequate." Teaching
methods were much the same as
fit Stanford, with large lecture
sessions and small teaching ses
sions.
"Medical care in Moscow Is cer
tainly adequate. It is comparable
to care in our own hospitals with
only a few except ions," stated Dr.
Moore. The differences he cited
were a higher rate of post-surgi
cal wound infection and less gen
eral competance in plastic sur
gory.
"To the extent that I went into
technical equipment, it was much
the same as our own." Dr. Moore
noted thai he even found some
American made apparatus being
used.
TUi; RUSSIAN STUDENTS lie
haved to all appearances much
like students everywhere. "The
idea that Soviet students are more
hard working just isn't so." Dr.
Moore stated. He remarked that
they sometimes talked or fell
asleep during lectures like stu
dents here occasionally do.
Although Soviet students re
ceive an allowance from the gov
ernment, Dr. Moore noted that it
isn't enough to cover expenses.
Students usually have to get more
funds from home because oppor
tunities for student employment
are very few.
Dr. Moore also noted that stu
dents must stand in line for a
large amount of time, particu
larly in the dining halls. He said,
"Some students say that they do
all of their required reading in
line."
Dr. Moore stated that contrary
1o what is often said about the
extreme number of women in the
medical professions, he found
their number to be approximately
equal to the men students at the
Medical Institute.

tainly adequate. It is comparable
to care in our own hospitals with
only a few except ions," stated Dr.
Moore. The differences he cited
were a higher rate of post-surgi
cal wound infection and less gen
eral competance in plastic sur
gory.
"To the extent that I went into
technical equipment, it was much
the same as our own." Dr. Moore
noted thai he even found some
American made apparatus being
used.
TUi; RUSSIAN STUDENTS lie
haved to all appearances much
like students everywhere. "The
idea that Soviet students are more
hard working just isn't so." Dr.
Moore stated. He remarked that
they sometimes talked or fell
asleep during lectures like stu
dents here occasionally do.
Although Soviet students re
ceive an allowance from the gov
ernment, Dr. Moore noted that it
isn't enough to cover expenses.
Students usually have to get more
funds from home because oppor
tunities for student employment
are very few.
Dr. Moore also noted that stu
dents must stand in line for a
large amount of time, particu
larly in the dining halls. He said,
"Some students say that they do
all of their required reading in
line."
Dr. Moore stated that contrary
1o what is often said about the
extreme number of women in the
medical professions, he found
their number to be approximately
equal to the men students at the
Medical Institute.
"There is a great contrast between what exists in the Soviet Union
and the impression we get from the news media," stated Dr. William
W. Moore, research associate in microbiology, Stanford School of
Medicine, yesterday evening in a Tuesday Evening Series lecture
titled "Impressions of Medicine and Life in the Soviet Union."
"There is a great difference between the old Soviet citizen and
the young Soviet citizen," Dr. Moore also pointed out. The old per
sons were sometimes very much afraid to even give their names,
while the youths were not in general afraid to criticise even the
government. Dr. Moore talked to one student who told him that the
student stoning of the American embassy after troops were sent to
Lebanon was required attendance. 4-

DURING HIS STAY in Moscow
last year. Dr. Moore lived in hous
ing provided by the University of
Moscow. He remarked, "It was
surprising to find considerable
discrimination against African
students at the University."
Dr. Moore found the teaching
at the First Medical Institute to
be "very adequate." Teaching
methods were much the same as
fit Stanford, with large lecture
sessions and small teaching ses
sions.

tainly adequate. It is comparable
