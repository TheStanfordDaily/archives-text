"We're going to win what we're
striving for," Allard Lowenstein
told the Daily in a second phone
call to Jackson, Mississippi, last
night.
A rally at Jackson was de
scribed as a "swinging good time"
by Aaron Henry, NAACP state
president, and freedom candidate
for governor, Lowenstein said.
More than 400 people attended
the rally, including a few whites
from Mississippi Southern Uni
versity. Several white girls were
detained and questioned without
charges.
"The people who run Missis
sippi are now aware that this
thing is much bigger than they
expected, and they are trying to
repress it." Lowenstein reported.
The strategy of the Mississippi
police, according to Lowenstein,
is now to hand out very high
bonds. George Green, a Negro
from Greenwood Mississippi, was
arrested for suspicion of auto
theft, and bond was posted at
$5,000.
Instead of arresting everyone
at one time, Lowenstein reported,
Mississippi police are trying to
arrest "white agitators" in order
to cripple the entire operation.
Bail money is now running out.
Norman Thomas arrives on
Saturday to assist in the freedom
balloting.
