### EVE BAKER 
The "art major" offered by
the Stanford Art Department is
undergoing clarification and ex
pansion. According to Prof Lo
renz Eitner. new head of the Art
and Architecture Department,
students working for an A.B. in
art have had to take a combina
tion of courses in studio art and
art history, in spite of the fact
that these are distinct, though re
lated fields, and that they attract
people of essentially different
viewpoints: the art scholar and
the creative artist.
For this reason, the Art De
partment has expanded its pro
gram to offer, in addition to the
art major, a now major in art
history, with minimal studio re
quirements and the opportunity
for a minor in such areas as liter
ature, philosophy, or classics. In
the near future, a studio major
will be introduced, with art his
tory requirements, and the "art

major" will bo abandoned. Eitner
said.
Of grout importance is the de
velopment of a good art history
library, according to Eitner; this
is no small task, for the history
of art is a long one. and no phase
can lie overlooked. Although the
Stanford museum has improved
over the past thirty years, ho said,
it holds no vital interest. "A sched
ule of events, and improved col
lections. lighting and spacing
would make it more dynamic."
Above all. more good art histor
ians arc needed; however, they
tend to cluster whore the condi
tions are good.
"It is important to realize that
the arts, including music, litera
ture, and philosophy, are the most
vital part of culture; they com
prise a repository of human feel
ings, capable of affecting people
centuries after the culture itself
has died." Eitner said. "Stanford's
lack of concern in this area is
Stanford's loss."
