# Stanford Students Now in Mississippi; Support for Mock Vote Increases
## 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN Editorial Page Editor 
The freedom vote campaign is taking on the character of a major
political campaign, Allarri Lowenstein told the Daily last night'in
a telephone call from the election headquarters in Jackson.
The four Stanford students who left for Jackson on Sunday
arrived safely yesterday. The four are Dennis Sweeny, Fred Goff
Hugh Smith, and Holt Ruffin.
"Please communicate to Stanford students how much your sup
port has meant to us," Sweeny told the Daily. Lowenstein and
Sweeny emphasized the effect on lifting morale of the high interest
and support at Stanford.
Ilene Strelit/, Daily editor, was unable to take Lowenstein's call,
as she, Bud Wedin, ASSU president, and Don Haider, IFC president,
spoke last night at a meeting of the Cal student body senate at
Berkeley to raise support for the freedom campaign.
Cal response was highly favorable. Student body president Mel

Levine said. "As an individual, I
strongly urge students to support
this appeal." KZSU reported that
at least, half of the senate mem
bers are beginning to raise funds.
INTIMIDATION and harass
ment have increased. Lowenstein
told the Daily of being trailed for
three hours Tuesday night by the
police and finally being fined for
running a red light: at a spot
where there was no traffic light.
Workers are followed whenever
they go anywhere.
Lowenstein reported a feeling
of near defiance after a rally
held in Jackson last night. He
felt that support had risen, a n d
more ministers would be willing
te give churches to be used as
polling places.
Jane Stembridge, a white girl
from Georgia, was arrested for
an illegal turn and improper rear
lights cm her car. Bond has been
set at SI.OOO.
Yesterday two Yale students
debated against two local citizens
on a television program in Hat
tisburg. After the debate a white
girl, a student at Southern Mis
sissippi University, came to the
freedom vote headquarters to say
she wished to attend the rally to
be held that night. Leaving the
building with two Yale students,
the girl was stopped by the police.
The police told her she was in
the wrong neighborhood, Mendy
Sanstein reported, and that she
had beter get out. The girl re
fused. and the police "pounced on
her and dragged her to the car."
Fred Goff will remain in Jack
son with Lowenstein, while the
other three Stanford students are
leaving today for Oxford. Tomor
row the three will go to Holly
springs, and Goff may join them
there.
SWEENY REPORTED on an
enthusiastic mass meeting in
Jackson last night. He noted that
Lowenstein's speech to the crowd
created a highly dynamic atmos
phere, partly because the voting
is "the one tangible, concrete
thing the people can do." Police
patrolled the area throughout the
entire meeting.
No money sent from Stanford
was received yesterday by Low
enstein. He commented that this
was "very suspicious."
The structure of the balloting
for the election will fulfill legal
requirements as required through
out most of the United States. All
candidates will be listed on the
ballot; voters must be over 21.
U.S. citizens, and free of a crimi
nal record.
There will be no literacy test.
Lowenstein stated that a super
structure cannot be set up on the
basis of who has been deprived
of education, "The Mississippi
sharecropper knows well enough
he doesn't want to vote for Paul
Johnson,' lie commented. "Nobody
knows better than the Negro who
has been hitting him over the
head."

The freedom vote campaign is taking on the character of a major
political campaign, Allarri Lowenstein told the Daily last night'in
a telephone call from the election headquarters in Jackson.
The four Stanford students who left for Jackson on Sunday
arrived safely yesterday. The four are Dennis Sweeny, Fred Goff
Hugh Smith, and Holt Ruffin.
"Please communicate to Stanford students how much your sup
port has meant to us," Sweeny told the Daily. Lowenstein and
Sweeny emphasized the effect on lifting morale of the high interest
and support at Stanford.
Ilene Strelit/, Daily editor, was unable to take Lowenstein's call,
as she, Bud Wedin, ASSU president, and Don Haider, IFC president,
spoke last night at a meeting of the Cal student body senate at
Berkeley to raise support for the freedom campaign.
Cal response was highly favorable. Student body president Mel

Levine said. "As an individual, I
strongly urge students to support
this appeal." KZSU reported that
at least, half of the senate mem
bers are beginning to raise funds.
INTIMIDATION and harass
ment have increased. Lowenstein
told the Daily of being trailed for
three hours Tuesday night by the
police and finally being fined for
running a red light: at a spot
where there was no traffic light.
Workers are followed whenever
they go anywhere.
Lowenstein reported a feeling
of near defiance after a rally
held in Jackson last night. He
felt that support had risen, a n d
more ministers would be willing
te give churches to be used as
polling places.
Jane Stembridge, a white girl
from Georgia, was arrested for
an illegal turn and improper rear
lights cm her car. Bond has been
set at SI.OOO.
Yesterday two Yale students
debated against two local citizens
on a television program in Hat
tisburg. After the debate a white
girl, a student at Southern Mis
sissippi University, came to the
freedom vote headquarters to say
she wished to attend the rally to
be held that night. Leaving the
building with two Yale students,
the girl was stopped by the police.
The police told her she was in
the wrong neighborhood, Mendy
Sanstein reported, and that she
had beter get out. The girl re
fused. and the police "pounced on
her and dragged her to the car."
Fred Goff will remain in Jack
son with Lowenstein, while the
other three Stanford students are
leaving today for Oxford. Tomor
row the three will go to Holly
springs, and Goff may join them
there.
SWEENY REPORTED on an
enthusiastic mass meeting in
Jackson last night. He noted that
Lowenstein's speech to the crowd
created a highly dynamic atmos
phere, partly because the voting
is "the one tangible, concrete
thing the people can do." Police
patrolled the area throughout the
entire meeting.
No money sent from Stanford
was received yesterday by Low
enstein. He commented that this
was "very suspicious."
The structure of the balloting
for the election will fulfill legal
requirements as required through
out most of the United States. All
candidates will be listed on the
ballot; voters must be over 21.
U.S. citizens, and free of a crimi
nal record.
There will be no literacy test.
Lowenstein stated that a super
structure cannot be set up on the
basis of who has been deprived
of education, "The Mississippi
sharecropper knows well enough
he doesn't want to vote for Paul
Johnson,' lie commented. "Nobody
knows better than the Negro who
has been hitting him over the
head."
