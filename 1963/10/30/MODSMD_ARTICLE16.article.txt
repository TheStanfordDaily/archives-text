# Urge Congress Action On Mississippi Vote
## 
### 
As of noon yesterday, $4200 was sent from Stanford to
the Henry for Governor campaign in Mississippi. Aaron
Ilenry will never be Governor of Mississippi, but the 1 proof
of disenfranehisement of fifty per cent of the Mississippi popu
lation will hopefully lead to a Mississippi that acts as if it
is part of the United States.
In addition to the tremendous financial boost lent the
Mississippi campaign, the Stanford activities will hopefully
push the shocking condition of the gubernatorial vote in that
state into national headlines. As of Monday night two Ameri
can cities — Hattiesbnrg and Glarksdale — were virtually
blocked off from the rest of the nation. Whites coming in to
work on the mock election, whites who even appear in the
Negro sections, will be jailed. That this can happen in our
country must be investigated by the Congress. Students must
contact their Congressman, tell them what is happening, urge
action on the Congress floor to investigate Mississippi activi
ties against its own citizens. The federal government and
the nation as a whole must decide if Mississippi is to continue
forbidding its citizens the vote. Once the vote is gained by
the Negroes, the most difficult segment of the civil right prob
lem there is solved. The mock vote, then, is more than a sym
pathy march; it is direct and tangible action.
II other academic communities will follow the lead of the
Stanford students and faculty within the next three days,
national publicity may force Mississippi to the brink.
The phone conversations with Henry headquarters con
tinue; the students spend their evenings knocking on doors;
the academic community continues to respond financially.
Stanford, for a brief few days, has placed itself in the heart
of the Mississippi delta.
