MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
The featured story in Monday's
Daily was the departure of a
group of Stanford students, in
cluding two Wilbur Hall sponsors,
to join in civil rights activity in
Mississippi. While we think it is
fine for students to be interested
and involved in such important
problems, we question the advis
ability of two freshman dormitory
sponsors, with important commit
ments of their own here on the
campus and, by the way, univer
sity employes, participating in
such demonstrations.
It seems to us that there can
be only two possible reasons for
their action:
Either they have gone to Mis
sissippi with University approval,
which would imply that this civil
rights activity is supported by
Stanford University, or—more im
portant—they have deserted their
commitments as university em
ployes to counsel their freshman
charges.
We do not believe the first rea
son is the case. If, then, the sec
ond reason is true, we wonder
what kind of example the two
sponsors are setting. After all,
through our tuitions we pay their
salaries as sponsors, and would
we rather have them performing
their own duties here at Stan
f or d, showing impressionable
freshmen (with only six weeks of
Stanford life under their belts)
what is expected of them; or do
we want them getting caught up
in the emotions of our time and
forgetting their personal respon
sibilities?

Editor, The Daily:
Four questions have arisen con
cerning the "Freedom Ballot"
campaign currently being con
ducted in Mississippi, and of
which we hear so much. I would
like clarification from someone
in close touch with the situation
on the points listed below.
1) Are the ballots and supplies
being printed and distributed by
the Aaron Henry for Governor
Committee? If so, this is akin to
having the Democratic Central
Committee of Chicago print and
distribute general election ma
terials and then call for an "hon
est" election.
2) Do the names of the other
three candidates for Governor ap
pear on the ballot also? If so,
do they appear in alphabetical
order in the same type size as Mr.
Henry's name, and do they appear
listing simply party affiliation
and occupation, or are names of
the other candidates, assuming
they appear, suffixed by designa
tions such as "segregationist" or
anti-Negro? If the Daily would
print a sample ballot, this matter
could be clarified.
3) Why are three days given
for voting for the "Freedom Bal
lot" while the legal election com
prises only twelve hours? If this
is to be a fair comparison, then
the same conditions ought to pre
vail for both the legal and "Free
dom Ballot" elections. If this is
to be ademonstration of the Ne
groes' desire and willingness lo
vote, they should not have special
privileges, since, in a legal elec
tion. they will not have three
days, but only twelve hours.
4) What methods of registra
tion are being used to prevent
multiple voting, check residency
requirements, prevent underage
voting, etc?
The results of the "Freedom
Ballot" will be effective only inso
far as the "Freedom Ballot" is
held under the exact same condi
tions as the legal General Elec
tion of Mississippi. I am con
cerned that the substantiation of
any of the four points above

would invalidate the results of
the "Freedom Ballot."

ROTC
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to take this op
portunity to condemn Miss Holly
Chenery for her condemnation of
ROTC. Her attitude is clearly
based on outmoded standards of
middle class morality and molded
through a narrow mind.
Miss Chenery says that "The
university does not see as part of
its task to provide opportunities
for individuals to learn voluntar
ily how to crack a safe or use a
blackjack ... A university which
purports to concern itself with
the growth of the individual can
not provide for the instruction of
these individuals in organization
to kill other individuals; in short,
there is no place for ROTC on
campus." However, while it is
true that, the University does not
offer such courses as Extortion
109, hundreds do graduate from
the business school each year,
presumably well equipped to face
the multiple challenges of the
competitive outside world. ROTC,
in its own way, also gives its ad
herents valuable skills for th e
competitive life ahead. Surely
the need is obvious.
Perhaps the widespread cal
umny directed at ROTC in these
past days is prompted not by
doubts of its true place in cam
pus life, but by the poor perform
ance of the candidates during
drill. Here is a worthy cause for
viewing the program with alarm.
These writers went down to the
| Harry Maloney Soccer field Mon
i day afternoon, expecting to see
a sparkling exhibition of discip
line, devotion, and dedication from
the candidates; instead we were
confronted with crooked lines
snaking across the field, rifles
pointing in all directions, and
stumbling, slipshod turns. Their
own company commander sum
marized the situation aptly in
these (overheard) words: "Those
damned idiots ... they don't know
how to march!"
Obviously, something is lacking
in ROTC. These writers have
come to the conclusion that
ROTC's poor drill performance
must be another sorry outgrowth
of apathy on the part of the stu
dent body it represents. Does the
football team do well with none
to cheer it on? Of course not.
Then how can ROTC be expected
to march on to new heights of
excellence without the support of
the student body which it repre
sents? However, on Monday last
only two spectators, plus an occa
sional tennis player fielding a
stray tennis ball, were on hand
to revel in the grandeur of our
marching militarists. Small won
der that the candidates become
dispirited.
Increased student support is
constantly solicited for water
polo, soccer, class government,
and other spectator sports. Surely
ROTC can be classified along with
these, so we strongly urge all stu
dents to bring blankets, refresh
ments, and dates to the gala
ROTC Leadership Laboratory.
The Harry Maloney Soccer field
is supplied with ample bleachers
and soft green grass for all those
who wish to cheer on their favor
ite ROTC candidate in action.
Cadets come in three decorator
uniforms: Navy—3:ls Monday,
Army—3:ls Tuesday, Air Force—
3:15 Thursday. Pick your favor
ite pastel for three hours of fun
and excitement every week—and
with thousands watching every
misstep, how could the corps help
but ameliorate itself? Remember,
ask not what ROTC can do for
you, but what you can do to
ROTC! —ALLYSON YOUNG
