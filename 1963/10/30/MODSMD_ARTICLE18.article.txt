# 'Taming of the Shrew' Not Pure Shakespeare
## 
### MANUEL FREEDMAN 
Downtown San Francisco was
dedicated to France, City movie
houses to mediocre French films,
museums to French artists,
restaurants to sour French bread
(even Italian ones), burlesque
houses to the Follies Bergere:
thus, the imperfect setting for
Shakespeare, who was dedicated
: to "THE TAMING OF THE
SHREW."
The Actor's Workshop might
have contributed to the French
Week festivities with a piece by
Moliere, since it was inclined to
make a farce of something. Com
edy that: resides in ihe play of
poetic phrase more than on the
play of players in the cast is most
enjoyable devoid of Victorian
farcical gimmicks. To my sur
prise, I found Shavian antics and
the nonsense of "Our Gang"
mixed into the usually pleasant
purity of Shakespearean comedy.
The result was a performance of
the Bard's propaganda-for-hus
bands piece that found its vogue
four hundred years after it was
written. Not that THE SHREW
does not call for some ingenious
and rollicking theatrics. But to
some point, which should not ex
tend so far as to, as Hamlet says,
"lose the name of action." Action
in this production became irrele
vant to what the Bard wrote. In
so doing, the Workshop's show is
a masterpiece of Robert Symond's
direction and a wilted flowering
of Shakespeare's poetery.
GLENN >fAZEN plays the in
domitable Petruchio. The play
opened on October 4. When I
saw it the 19th, Mr. Ma/.en had
lost his voice, undoubtedly be
cause of all the ranting and rav
ing and rhapsodizing that his part
demands. And well he does it
when we can hear him. He is a
long, slender actor, who produces
poetic magic in a very wave of
his spacious fingers. When he
bows to kiss Katherine's hand,
he goes down more in sections
than all at once; but he is a de
light to watch. His opposite,
played by Priscilla Pointer, is a
fairly desirable Katherine. Only
she has the stage's most infuri
ating habit of swallowing many of
her lines. And when the words
of Shakespeare are gurgled in
the esophagus of one of his por
trayers, an absolute felony is done
to one's ears. I could swear at
times she spoke with her mouth
closed. She is consistently a curse
able Kate to the end, when Pet
ruchio employs her now-tamed
habitual wrath to underline the
play's point with her final speech:
that; the husband is the god of
his wife. This philosophy ex
tended and seen in light of the
god's progeny, must make college
students readily snicker. When
Petruchio induces Kate to kiss
him in the streets of Padua, the
embrace is reminiscent of the
mediocre French film I saw the
night before. However, the two
of them pull off the best scene
of the play, the one in which they
meet. Here more than anywhere
else the whole performance the
brilliancy of Shakespearean play
fulness dances from the actors.
Those who know the metaphori
cal tricks it plays will delight in
Mr. Mazer's and Miss Pointer's
interpretation.
IT IS A SHAME that one must
wait until the first scene of act
two before realizing that Shake
speare and not some imposter of
Shaw had written the play. In
deed GBS himself would have
been astounded to see one of his
own plays so overdone with non
sense. There were moments
though. Frank Bayer does a re
markable job of staccato double
talking in describing Potruchio's
wedding attire. As Biodello, he

portrays the mischievious servant j
to Lucentio with well-tempered
skill. Paul Rebillot as Grumio,
the servant to Petruchio, dressed
in plaids and sporting a crooked
walking stick, thankfully plays
with the words Shakespeare pro
vided for him. Me unmistakably |
identifies himself throughout as
Grumio. Robert Haswell has a
couple of good scenes as Bap
tista, Dan Sullivan does a good
small job as the Tailor, and Rob- j
ert Benson demands praise as
Vincentio. A special word of j
thanks to Irving Israel as Chris- j
topher Sly. Although the Work- |
shop employed some parttime
playright to doctor with his role,
he was very good and very drunk
and very ready to take his "wife"
to bed instead of to watch the
play that was being done in his
honor.
Oh, yes, there were others in
the play. Well, some were cred
ible, some were offensive, some
were so insignificant as to be
negligible. Ray Fray as Gremio
was good at times but he is the
kind of actor who presumes the
audience will laugh at every bat
of his eyes. Gremio grows gro
tesquely into the exploitation of
Fry's virtuosity as a slapstick ac
tor. Edward Winter looks and
sounds like Douglass Campbell
when I saw Campbell do Oedipus;
but since he was playing Morten
sio in the SHREW he was con
ventional. Robert Phalen was
bored with the play and with his
part of Tranio. He was dreary
to watch. Monte Markham re
cites Lucentio's poetry in a way
that; would drive the most insen-;
sitive speech teacher 1o delirious
tears of despair. Linda Ewing
was middling impressive as the
flirtacious Bianca. She had a
gooey voice, which floated slowly
about two feet across the or
chestra pit, then lay down and
went to sleep.
TO RECOUNT the plot is tedi
ous. Besides I presume you have
ae least a Charles Lamb knowl
edge of THE SHREW. There is
confusion as to what music Rich
ard Vartanian composed. What
served as overture was excellent,
although I guessed it to be Bach.
If it was that music played on
stage at various times, I am
afraid Ted Mack could have come
up with a better score from one
of his proteges. The setting de
scribing the outside of an ale
house used by the traveling com
pany to perform the SHREW for
Sly, the largest hunting dogs I
have ever seen, the huge carriage
which conveyed the acting com
pany to the alehouse were t he
artistic achievements of the whole
production, next to the fashion
able meeting scene between Pet
ruchio and Kate. Costumes like
the ones used can be rented
wholesale out of any theatrical
supply house, and the lighting
was . . . light.
On the whole, the show was
Petruchio's, Biondello's, Brumio's
and Sly's. It lacked Elizabethan
sense of comedy, being replaced
with Victorian not-so-farcial-as
it-was-superfluous farce. It was
more Actor's Workshop than
Shakespeare. But overlook this
article, burn it out of the Daily,
and go see it. Never miss a
chance to see decent Shakespeare.
It runs another ten performances
Wednesday through Sunday for
the next two weeks. If you have
never seen THE SHREW, a re
markable introduction to it awaits
you at the Marines' Theatre. Al
though it: might do injustice to
your sense for pure Shakespeare,
go for the rollicking fun of slap
stick comedy and then read the
play to see what the Workshop
missed or mussed. But save your
black clothes, for HAMLET is
coming soon to Stanford.

light to watch. His opposite,
played by Priscilla Pointer, is a
fairly desirable Katherine. Only
she has the stage's most infuri
ating habit of swallowing many of
her lines. And when the words
of Shakespeare are gurgled in
the esophagus of one of his por
trayers, an absolute felony is done
to one's ears. I could swear at
times she spoke with her mouth
closed. She is consistently a curse
able Kate to the end, when Pet
ruchio employs her now-tamed
habitual wrath to underline the
play's point with her final speech:
that; the husband is the god of
his wife. This philosophy ex
tended and seen in light of the
god's progeny, must make college
students readily snicker. When
Petruchio induces Kate to kiss
him in the streets of Padua, the
embrace is reminiscent of the
mediocre French film I saw the
night before. However, the two
of them pull off the best scene
of the play, the one in which they
meet. Here more than anywhere
else the whole performance the
brilliancy of Shakespearean play
fulness dances from the actors.
Those who know the metaphori
cal tricks it plays will delight in
Mr. Mazer's and Miss Pointer's
interpretation.
IT IS A SHAME that one must
wait until the first scene of act
two before realizing that Shake
speare and not some imposter of
Shaw had written the play. In
deed GBS himself would have
been astounded to see one of his
own plays so overdone with non
sense. There were moments
though. Frank Bayer does a re
markable job of staccato double
talking in describing Potruchio's
wedding attire. As Biodello, he

portrays the mischievious servant j
to Lucentio with well-tempered
skill. Paul Rebillot as Grumio,
the servant to Petruchio, dressed
in plaids and sporting a crooked
walking stick, thankfully plays
with the words Shakespeare pro
vided for him. Me unmistakably |
identifies himself throughout as
Grumio. Robert Haswell has a
couple of good scenes as Bap
tista, Dan Sullivan does a good
small job as the Tailor, and Rob- j
ert Benson demands praise as
Vincentio. A special word of j
thanks to Irving Israel as Chris- j
topher Sly. Although the Work- |
shop employed some parttime
playright to doctor with his role,
he was very good and very drunk
and very ready to take his "wife"
to bed instead of to watch the
play that was being done in his
honor.
Oh, yes, there were others in
the play. Well, some were cred
ible, some were offensive, some
were so insignificant as to be
negligible. Ray Fray as Gremio
was good at times but he is the
kind of actor who presumes the
audience will laugh at every bat
of his eyes. Gremio grows gro
tesquely into the exploitation of
Fry's virtuosity as a slapstick ac
tor. Edward Winter looks and
sounds like Douglass Campbell
when I saw Campbell do Oedipus;
but since he was playing Morten
sio in the SHREW he was con
ventional. Robert Phalen was
bored with the play and with his
part of Tranio. He was dreary
to watch. Monte Markham re
cites Lucentio's poetry in a way
that; would drive the most insen-;
sitive speech teacher 1o delirious
tears of despair. Linda Ewing
was middling impressive as the
flirtacious Bianca. She had a
gooey voice, which floated slowly
about two feet across the or
chestra pit, then lay down and
went to sleep.
TO RECOUNT the plot is tedi
ous. Besides I presume you have
ae least a Charles Lamb knowl
edge of THE SHREW. There is
confusion as to what music Rich
ard Vartanian composed. What
served as overture was excellent,
although I guessed it to be Bach.
If it was that music played on
stage at various times, I am
afraid Ted Mack could have come
up with a better score from one
of his proteges. The setting de
scribing the outside of an ale
house used by the traveling com
pany to perform the SHREW for
Sly, the largest hunting dogs I
have ever seen, the huge carriage
which conveyed the acting com
pany to the alehouse were t he
artistic achievements of the whole
production, next to the fashion
able meeting scene between Pet
ruchio and Kate. Costumes like
the ones used can be rented
wholesale out of any theatrical
supply house, and the lighting
was . . . light.
On the whole, the show was
Petruchio's, Biondello's, Brumio's
and Sly's. It lacked Elizabethan
sense of comedy, being replaced
with Victorian not-so-farcial-as
it-was-superfluous farce. It was
more Actor's Workshop than
Shakespeare. But overlook this
article, burn it out of the Daily,
and go see it. Never miss a
chance to see decent Shakespeare.
It runs another ten performances
Wednesday through Sunday for
the next two weeks. If you have
never seen THE SHREW, a re
markable introduction to it awaits
you at the Marines' Theatre. Al
though it: might do injustice to
your sense for pure Shakespeare,
go for the rollicking fun of slap
stick comedy and then read the
play to see what the Workshop
missed or mussed. But save your
black clothes, for HAMLET is
coming soon to Stanford.
Downtown San Francisco was
dedicated to France, City movie
houses to mediocre French films,
museums to French artists,
restaurants to sour French bread
(even Italian ones), burlesque
houses to the Follies Bergere:
thus, the imperfect setting for
Shakespeare, who was dedicated
: to "THE TAMING OF THE
SHREW."
The Actor's Workshop might
have contributed to the French
Week festivities with a piece by
Moliere, since it was inclined to
make a farce of something. Com
edy that: resides in ihe play of
poetic phrase more than on the
play of players in the cast is most
enjoyable devoid of Victorian
farcical gimmicks. To my sur
prise, I found Shavian antics and
the nonsense of "Our Gang"
mixed into the usually pleasant
purity of Shakespearean comedy.
The result was a performance of
the Bard's propaganda-for-hus
bands piece that found its vogue
four hundred years after it was
written. Not that THE SHREW
does not call for some ingenious
and rollicking theatrics. But to
some point, which should not ex
tend so far as to, as Hamlet says,
"lose the name of action." Action
in this production became irrele
vant to what the Bard wrote. In
so doing, the Workshop's show is
a masterpiece of Robert Symond's
direction and a wilted flowering
of Shakespeare's poetery.
GLENN >fAZEN plays the in
domitable Petruchio. The play
opened on October 4. When I
saw it the 19th, Mr. Ma/.en had
lost his voice, undoubtedly be
cause of all the ranting and rav
ing and rhapsodizing that his part
demands. And well he does it
when we can hear him. He is a
long, slender actor, who produces
poetic magic in a very wave of
his spacious fingers. When he
bows to kiss Katherine's hand,
he goes down more in sections
than all at once; but he is a de
light to watch. His opposite,
played by Priscilla Pointer, is a

Grumio. Robert Haswell has a
couple of good scenes as Bap
tista, Dan Sullivan does a good
small job as the Tailor, and Rob- j
ert Benson demands praise as
Vincentio. A special word of j
thanks to Irving Israel as Chris- j
topher Sly. Although the Work- |
shop employed some parttime
playright to doctor with his role,
he was very good and very drunk
and very ready to take his "wife"
to bed instead of to watch the
play that was being done in his
honor.
Oh, yes, there were others in
the play. Well, some were cred
ible, some were offensive, some
were so insignificant as to be
negligible. Ray Fray as Gremio
was good at times but he is the
kind of actor who presumes the
audience will laugh at every bat
of his eyes. Gremio grows gro
tesquely into the exploitation of
Fry's virtuosity as a slapstick ac
tor. Edward Winter looks and
sounds like Douglass Campbell
when I saw Campbell do Oedipus;
but since he was playing Morten
sio in the SHREW he was con
ventional. Robert Phalen was
bored with the play and with his
part of Tranio. He was dreary
to watch. Monte Markham re
cites Lucentio's poetry in a way
that; would drive the most insen-;
sitive speech teacher 1o delirious
tears of despair. Linda Ewing
was middling impressive as the
flirtacious Bianca. She had a
gooey voice, which floated slowly
about two feet across the or
chestra pit, then lay down and
went to sleep.
TO RECOUNT the plot is tedi
ous. Besides I presume you have
ae least a Charles Lamb knowl
edge of THE SHREW. There is
confusion as to what music Rich
ard Vartanian composed. What
served as overture was excellent,
although I guessed it to be Bach.
If it was that music played on
stage at various times, I am
afraid Ted Mack could have come
up with a better score from one
of his proteges. The setting de
scribing the outside of an ale
house used by the traveling com
pany to perform the SHREW for
Sly, the largest hunting dogs I
have ever seen, the huge carriage
which conveyed the acting com
pany to the alehouse were t he
artistic achievements of the whole
production, next to the fashion
able meeting scene between Pet
ruchio and Kate. Costumes like
the ones used can be rented
wholesale out of any theatrical
supply house, and the lighting
was . . . light.
On the whole, the show was
Petruchio's, Biondello's, Brumio's
and Sly's. It lacked Elizabethan
sense of comedy, being replaced
with Victorian not-so-farcial-as
it-was-superfluous farce. It was
more Actor's Workshop than
Shakespeare. But overlook this
article, burn it out of the Daily,
and go see it. Never miss a
chance to see decent Shakespeare.
It runs another ten performances
Wednesday through Sunday for
the next two weeks. If you have
never seen THE SHREW, a re
markable introduction to it awaits
you at the Marines' Theatre. Al
though it: might do injustice to
your sense for pure Shakespeare,
go for the rollicking fun of slap
stick comedy and then read the
play to see what the Workshop
missed or mussed. But save your
black clothes, for HAMLET is
coming soon to Stanford.
Downtown San Francisco was
dedicated to France, City movie
houses to mediocre French films,
museums to French artists,
restaurants to sour French bread
(even Italian ones), burlesque
houses to the Follies Bergere:
thus, the imperfect setting for
Shakespeare, who was dedicated
: to "THE TAMING OF THE
SHREW."
The Actor's Workshop might
have contributed to the French
Week festivities with a piece by
Moliere, since it was inclined to
make a farce of something. Com
edy that: resides in ihe play of
poetic phrase more than on the
play of players in the cast is most
enjoyable devoid of Victorian
farcical gimmicks. To my sur
prise, I found Shavian antics and
the nonsense of "Our Gang"
mixed into the usually pleasant
purity of Shakespearean comedy.
The result was a performance of
the Bard's propaganda-for-hus
bands piece that found its vogue
four hundred years after it was
written. Not that THE SHREW
does not call for some ingenious
and rollicking theatrics. But to
some point, which should not ex
tend so far as to, as Hamlet says,
"lose the name of action." Action
in this production became irrele
vant to what the Bard wrote. In
so doing, the Workshop's show is
a masterpiece of Robert Symond's
direction and a wilted flowering
of Shakespeare's poetery.
GLENN >fAZEN plays the in
domitable Petruchio. The play
opened on October 4. When I
saw it the 19th, Mr. Ma/.en had
lost his voice, undoubtedly be
cause of all the ranting and rav
ing and rhapsodizing that his part
demands. And well he does it
when we can hear him. He is a
long, slender actor, who produces
poetic magic in a very wave of
his spacious fingers. When he
bows to kiss Katherine's hand,
he goes down more in sections
than all at once; but he is a de
light to watch. His opposite,
played by Priscilla Pointer, is a
fairly desirable Katherine. Only
she has the stage's most infuri
ating habit of swallowing many of
her lines. And when the words
of Shakespeare are gurgled in
the esophagus of one of his por
trayers, an absolute felony is done
to one's ears. I could swear at
times she spoke with her mouth
closed. She is consistently a curse
able Kate to the end, when Pet
ruchio employs her now-tamed
habitual wrath to underline the
play's point with her final speech:
that; the husband is the god of
his wife. This philosophy ex
tended and seen in light of the
god's progeny, must make college
students readily snicker. When
Petruchio induces Kate to kiss
him in the streets of Padua, the
embrace is reminiscent of the
mediocre French film I saw the
night before. However, the two
of them pull off the best scene
of the play, the one in which they
meet. Here more than anywhere
else the whole performance the
brilliancy of Shakespearean play
fulness dances from the actors.
Those who know the metaphori
cal tricks it plays will delight in
Mr. Mazer's and Miss Pointer's
interpretation.
IT IS A SHAME that one must
wait until the first scene of act
two before realizing that Shake
speare and not some imposter of
Shaw had written the play. In
deed GBS himself would have
been astounded to see one of his
own plays so overdone with non
sense. There were moments
though. Frank Bayer does a re
markable job of staccato double
talking in describing Potruchio's
wedding attire. As Biodello, he

portrays the mischievious servant j
to Lucentio with well-tempered
skill. Paul Rebillot as Grumio,
the servant to Petruchio, dressed
in plaids and sporting a crooked
walking stick, thankfully plays
with the words Shakespeare pro
vided for him. Me unmistakably |
identifies himself throughout as
Grumio. Robert Haswell has a

up with a better score from one
of his proteges. The setting de
scribing the outside of an ale
house used by the traveling com
pany to perform the SHREW for
Sly, the largest hunting dogs I
have ever seen, the huge carriage
which conveyed the acting com
pany to the alehouse were t he
artistic achievements of the whole
production, next to the fashion
able meeting scene between Pet
ruchio and Kate. Costumes like
the ones used can be rented
wholesale out of any theatrical
supply house, and the lighting
was . . . light.
On the whole, the show was
Petruchio's, Biondello's, Brumio's
and Sly's. It lacked Elizabethan
sense of comedy, being replaced
with Victorian not-so-farcial-as
it-was-superfluous farce. It was
more Actor's Workshop than
Shakespeare. But overlook this
article, burn it out of the Daily,
and go see it. Never miss a
chance to see decent Shakespeare.
It runs another ten performances
Wednesday through Sunday for
the next two weeks. If you have
never seen THE SHREW, a re
markable introduction to it awaits
you at the Marines' Theatre. Al
though it: might do injustice to
your sense for pure Shakespeare,
go for the rollicking fun of slap
stick comedy and then read the
play to see what the Workshop
missed or mussed. But save your
black clothes, for HAMLET is
coming soon to Stanford.
Downtown San Francisco was
dedicated to France, City movie
houses to mediocre French films,
museums to French artists,
restaurants to sour French bread
(even Italian ones), burlesque
houses to the Follies Bergere:
thus, the imperfect setting for
Shakespeare, who was dedicated
: to "THE TAMING OF THE
SHREW."
The Actor's Workshop might
have contributed to the French
Week festivities with a piece by
Moliere, since it was inclined to
make a farce of something. Com
edy that: resides in ihe play of
poetic phrase more than on the
play of players in the cast is most
enjoyable devoid of Victorian
farcical gimmicks. To my sur
prise, I found Shavian antics and
the nonsense of "Our Gang"
mixed into the usually pleasant
purity of Shakespearean comedy.
The result was a performance of
the Bard's propaganda-for-hus
bands piece that found its vogue
four hundred years after it was
written. Not that THE SHREW
does not call for some ingenious
and rollicking theatrics. But to
some point, which should not ex
tend so far as to, as Hamlet says,
"lose the name of action." Action
in this production became irrele
vant to what the Bard wrote. In
so doing, the Workshop's show is
a masterpiece of Robert Symond's
direction and a wilted flowering
of Shakespeare's poetery.
GLENN >fAZEN plays the in
domitable Petruchio. The play
opened on October 4. When I
saw it the 19th, Mr. Ma/.en had
lost his voice, undoubtedly be
cause of all the ranting and rav
ing and rhapsodizing that his part
demands. And well he does it
when we can hear him. He is a
long, slender actor, who produces
poetic magic in a very wave of
his spacious fingers. When he
bows to kiss Katherine's hand,
he goes down more in sections
than all at once; but he is a de
light to watch. His opposite,
played by Priscilla Pointer, is a
fairly desirable Katherine. Only
she has the stage's most infuri
ating habit of swallowing many of
her lines. And when the words
of Shakespeare are gurgled in
the esophagus of one of his por
trayers, an absolute felony is done
to one's ears. I could swear at
times she spoke with her mouth
closed. She is consistently a curse
able Kate to the end, when Pet
ruchio employs her now-tamed
habitual wrath to underline the
play's point with her final speech:
that; the husband is the god of
his wife. This philosophy ex
tended and seen in light of the
god's progeny, must make college
students readily snicker. When
Petruchio induces Kate to kiss
him in the streets of Padua, the
embrace is reminiscent of the
mediocre French film I saw the
night before. However, the two
of them pull off the best scene
of the play, the one in which they
meet. Here more than anywhere
else the whole performance the
brilliancy of Shakespearean play
fulness dances from the actors.
Those who know the metaphori
cal tricks it plays will delight in
Mr. Mazer's and Miss Pointer's
interpretation.
IT IS A SHAME that one must
wait until the first scene of act
two before realizing that Shake
speare and not some imposter of
Shaw had written the play. In
deed GBS himself would have
been astounded to see one of his
own plays so overdone with non
sense. There were moments
though. Frank Bayer does a re
markable job of staccato double
talking in describing Potruchio's
wedding attire. As Biodello, he

portrays the mischievious servant j
to Lucentio with well-tempered
skill. Paul Rebillot as Grumio,
the servant to Petruchio, dressed
in plaids and sporting a crooked
walking stick, thankfully plays
with the words Shakespeare pro
vided for him. Me unmistakably |
identifies himself throughout as
Grumio. Robert Haswell has a
couple of good scenes as Bap
tista, Dan Sullivan does a good
small job as the Tailor, and Rob- j
ert Benson demands praise as
Vincentio. A special word of j
thanks to Irving Israel as Chris- j
topher Sly. Although the Work- |
shop employed some parttime
playright to doctor with his role,
he was very good and very drunk
and very ready to take his "wife"
to bed instead of to watch the
play that was being done in his
honor.
Oh, yes, there were others in
the play. Well, some were cred
ible, some were offensive, some
were so insignificant as to be
negligible. Ray Fray as Gremio
was good at times but he is the
kind of actor who presumes the
audience will laugh at every bat
of his eyes. Gremio grows gro
tesquely into the exploitation of
Fry's virtuosity as a slapstick ac
tor. Edward Winter looks and
sounds like Douglass Campbell
when I saw Campbell do Oedipus;
but since he was playing Morten
sio in the SHREW he was con
ventional. Robert Phalen was
bored with the play and with his
part of Tranio. He was dreary
to watch. Monte Markham re
cites Lucentio's poetry in a way
that; would drive the most insen-;
sitive speech teacher 1o delirious
tears of despair. Linda Ewing
was middling impressive as the
flirtacious Bianca. She had a
gooey voice, which floated slowly
about two feet across the or
chestra pit, then lay down and
went to sleep.
TO RECOUNT the plot is tedi
ous. Besides I presume you have
ae least a Charles Lamb knowl
edge of THE SHREW. There is
confusion as to what music Rich
ard Vartanian composed. What
served as overture was excellent,
although I guessed it to be Bach.
If it was that music played on
