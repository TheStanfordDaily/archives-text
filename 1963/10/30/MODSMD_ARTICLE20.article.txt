### TOM ELIAS 
Stanford's cross country team
goes after its third dual meet
; win of the season tomorrow after
| noon when the defending national
j champion San Jose Spartans
[ come to the Farm.
The race will start on the sec
ond tee of the Stanford golf
, course at 4 o'clock,
IN PREVIOUS action this sea
i son the Tribe has engaged San
1 Jose just once, placing second be
hind Ihe Spartans at the Sacra
mento State Invitational on Oct.
12. Since then, Payton Jordan's
crew has beaten UCLA, lost to
Southern Cal by one point, and
slaughtered Cal.
San Jose is unbeaten so far
! this season, having shut out Cal
15 to 40 last week and having
beaten the Golden Gate AC of
San Francisco this Saturday.
Last year the Spartans beat
Stanford 19 to 40 en route to
their national crown. This was
the smallest victory margin the
unbeaten Spartans had all season,
including the NCAA meet.
SAN JOSE, this season again
â€¢ coached by Dean Miller, will be
led into the meet by Danny Mur
phy, third in the nation last sea
son, and Jeff Fishback, a con
stantly improving runner who
j has beaten Murphy on occasion
this year.
Stanford will bp led into the
| meet by outstanding senior Har-
I ry McCalla, eleventh place fin
i isher in last season's NCAA ac-
I tion, and by the resurgent Weym
Kirkland, who nearly beat out
: USC's All-American Julio Marin
j in last week's meet at Berkeley.
Kirkland, the defending West
j Coast Intercollegiate champion,
i started the season so slowly this
! year that he did not even make
the travelling squad for the har-
I riers' opener at Sacramento.
Bill Pratt, Paul Sohlicke and
; constantly improving Bruce John
! son should combine with McCalla
1 ami Kirkland to provide at least
: a very good test for the Spartans.
