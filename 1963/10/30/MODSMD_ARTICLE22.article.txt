## Bruins Beat Stanford Frosh Daily Sports 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The UCLA frosh foot ball team
Saturday slipped through and
around a lethargic Stanford club
for two quick first quarter touch
downs to hand the Papooses their
first defeat in three outings, 12-0
at Stanford Stadium.
The contest, prior to the varsity
game, started off as a Woody
Hayes Special â€” three yards and

a cloud of dust. But with 5:31
loft in the first quarter, Stan
ford, deep in their own territory,
punted. UCLA safetyman Tim
McAteer gathered in the ball on
his own 42-yard line, evaded a
tackier, and raced down the press
box sideline for an easy TD.
WITHIN two minutes UCLA
had its second touchdown.
Following the kickoff, which
the Papooses returned to the
30, UCLA recovered a loose ball.

The Bruins then sent 165 pound i
speedster Ed Mutt through the!
line on a slant over right tackle, j
Mult saw daylight to the out
side, cut sharply, and was off.
The attempted kick for point was
blocked. This left the score at j
12-0 Bruins.
Stanford missed a big oppor
tunity in the second quarter when,
after ripping off successive gains
of 16 and 18 yards, UCLA corner
man Mike Roof intercepted on
his 32-yard lino. The first half
ended one play later.
THE ItKUINS also started mov
ing in the third period and drove i
to lhe Stanford 27 where, aided!
by two penalties. Stanford held.
With two minutes remaining
in the third quarter, quarterback
John Propstra tossed consecutive
first down passes to halfbacks
Don Leydig and Greg Ford and
snuck for a first down himself to
put the Indians on the Bruin 34.
Then when it looked like the
Indians were just about to score
Bruin defensive back Tim Mc-
Ateer nabbed a pass in the end
zone and ran it back 29 yards.

LEADING BACK of the game
was Ed llutt of UCLA who racked ;
up 90 yards and 1 touchdown in j
11 carries. Fullback Bill Ost-
Hinder crunched for (56 yards in >
14 tries for the Indians.
Next week in their big game
and final tussle of the year thoy i
encounter an undefeated Cal.i-!
fornia frosh team at Berkeley.
