At least nine out of ten Americans are still running arounu spiritually dead in the
world-womb, oblivious to the real world of liod. Layers and layers ■ >f ego defense
mechanisms, and an innermost membrane of pride protect them from the living Clod
who loves them an<l the risen Christ who died for them. While massive powers of
evil will do all they can to keep one from being born into God's world. Hi- grace
and mercy are fully aide to "deliver" anyone who will come humbly to Him.
The world-womb is not a closed -ystein mail's picture of his world is not -elf-con

and plug up the Raps where (iod's revelation seeps in. Politicians gloss over the real
suffering, pain, and sin on Karth, emphasizing; material goods as the answer to the
world's problems. Many liberal ministers teach, contrary to the Bible, that man is
inherently good and can solve his own problems, ignoring the evidence that all men
are capable of great evil. Kveti death is carefully covered over with flowers and
perfume in order to hide the fact that a loved one may actually have slipped off into
Hell.
The Word of God is capable of piercing through all the layers of unbelief ami false
doctrine plastering the walls of the world womb. There arc eternal truths and ulti
mate answers to the meaning of life revealed in the Holy Scriptures. The only way
out of the world womb into life is through the gate of the cross and the broken body
of Christ. Man in his own efforts can do nothing to please (iod. It is necessary that
one put aside his pride and let the l.ight of the World flood into the recesses of >our
heart. "Jesus spoke unto them saying: I am the light of the world: he who follows
me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." John S-:12. "In truth,
in very truth I tell you. unless a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of
(iod . . . no one can enter without being born from water and spirit. Flesh gives
rise to flesh; it is spirit which give- birth to spirit . . . you inust be born again."

At least nine out of ten Americans are still running arounu spiritually dead in the
world-womb, oblivious to the real world of liod. Layers and layers ■ >f ego defense
mechanisms, and an innermost membrane of pride protect them from the living Clod
who loves them an<l the risen Christ who died for them. While massive powers of
evil will do all they can to keep one from being born into God's world. Hi- grace
and mercy are fully aide to "deliver" anyone who will come humbly to Him.
The world-womb is not a closed -ystein mail's picture of his world is not -elf-con
sistent. It takes the full-time efforts of many great philosophers to deny the truth
and plug up the Raps where (iod's revelation seeps in. Politicians gloss over the real
suffering, pain, and sin on Karth, emphasizing; material goods as the answer to the
world's problems. Many liberal ministers teach, contrary to the Bible, that man is
inherently good and can solve his own problems, ignoring the evidence that all men
are capable of great evil. Kveti death is carefully covered over with flowers and
perfume in order to hide the fact that a loved one may actually have slipped off into
Hell.
The Word of God is capable of piercing through all the layers of unbelief ami false
doctrine plastering the walls of the world womb. There arc eternal truths and ulti
mate answers to the meaning of life revealed in the Holy Scriptures. The only way
out of the world womb into life is through the gate of the cross and the broken body
of Christ. Man in his own efforts can do nothing to please (iod. It is necessary that
one put aside his pride and let the l.ight of the World flood into the recesses of >our
heart. "Jesus spoke unto them saying: I am the light of the world: he who follows
me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." John S-:12. "In truth,
in very truth I tell you. unless a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of
(iod . . . no one can enter without being born from water and spirit. Flesh gives
rise to flesh; it is spirit which give- birth to spirit . . . you inust be born again."
