# Tresidder Adopts New Hours Today
## 
### 
Hours for most services at Tre
sidder will change today, due to
a study made into actual student
use of the Union.
According to Charlie Hinkle,
Union Board Chairman, the new
hours will reflect more closely
ihe pattern of use. They will
allow the Union to be open when
most Stanford students seem to
want it open.
The Union food service will be
open from 7 to 11:30, Sunday
through Thursday; half an hour
longer than usual to allow stu
dents to visit the Union after the
library closes at 11. However, the
Union will be closed at 11:30 in
stead of 12:30 on Friday and Sat
urday nights, since few students
come during this hour.
