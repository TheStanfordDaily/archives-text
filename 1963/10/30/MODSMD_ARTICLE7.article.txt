## House Committee Okays Famed Civil Rights Bill 
### 
United Press International
WASHINGTON The House Judiciary Committee at President
Kennedy's personal persuasion approved yesterday a compromise
civil rights bill after scuttling a tougher measure he contended could
not pass Congress. The approved bill would prohibit racial dis
crimination in public accommodations; strengthen Negro voting and
job rights and allow the federal go\ernment to initiate civil rights
suits in the courts.
Prior to final approval, the committee, by a 19-15 vote, killed the
"tough" measure written by a judiciary subcommittee which the
President opposed. It then voted preliminary approval of the ad
ministration bill by a 20-14 vote. The final vote came at a later
session.
Both bills dealt with generally the same civil rights problems but
the rejected subcommittee bill would have armed the federal gov
ernment with weapons that the administration felt were too far
reaching and possibly unconstitutional.
His moderate tone coincided with a message from the people of
China thanking the Soviet government and party for congratulations
on Oct. 1 -Communist China's national day. There was no explana
tion of the 28-day delay.

COWâ€”Chao Kuo-ehiang, secretary of the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions, spoke yesterday in the Palace of Congresses behind
the Kremlin walls on Communist solidarity, and said that the Chinese
support the implementation of peaceful co-existence.
Chai's brief address at the meeting was in sharp contrast to the
violent war of words emanating from Moscow and Peking. The
moderate Chinese pronouncements followed a bid by Premier Nikita
S. Khrushchev to end the bitter accusations. But Western diplomats
in Moscow cautioned against interpreting them as a radical depar
ture in Chinese politics.
Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi declared in Peking Monday
that China would "never yield" to Khrushchev in the ideological
battle. He also indicated Peking is going ahead with the creation of
nuclear weapons.
