# Freshmen Eager To Answer Need
## 
### ROD PECK 
As it to appear Monday
night that a large number of
Stanford students were needed in
Mississippi, the freshman re
sponse was phenomenal. Some
times far removed from the heart
of such activity, freshmen played
an integral part.
From 3 p.m. Monday there was
a flurry of activity as hurried
long distance calls went to par
ents for consent and money and
worried consultations worked
out the details of travel. The bus
originally procured by LASSU
was considered too expensive by
most and cost-sharing in private
cars seemed more feasable. One
group of six even attempted to
purchase a 1951 DeSoto for the
trek. In all, 30 freshment were
on the verge of leaving with more
considering.
Richard L. Rapson, instructor
in history and Otero faculty res
ident, commended the freshmen.
''Although they could not be cer
tain that their personal participa
tion would be of direct benefit to
the campaign, their willingness
to take the risk speaks highly of
them." he believed. "Some mo
tives may not have been entirely
pure, but then it is unrealistic to
expect that. As much good has
come from the many uncertain
idealists as has from the certain
few."
When word came that altered
conditions would prevent them
from going, there was some bit
terness and, of course, a large
let-down. Later, in face of 6
month jail terms and $500 fines
with attendent difficulties, it was
realized that other means of assis
tance would be more equitable.
One student remarked, "Having
to decide on one's personal con
victions in this matter was very
difficult. Perhaps, even though
we couldn't go ourselves, making
a decision and trying to carry it
out was worth it."
