he is a well-known authority.
Three weeks ago he was ap

Robert Sears, dean of the Hu
manities and Sciences said he "re
luctantly agreed to Mr. Whitak
er's request because of his heavy
load of other administrative dut
ies. He is a superb administrator
and has been instrumental in
building the Department of Eng
lish to a very high status." Sears
said.
Whitaker's successor as head

of the Department of English will
lie announced this quarter. The
appointment will be made by
President Wallace Sterling on
recommendation of the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences.
With the exception of one year,

taught for a year at Whitworth
College in Spokane, Washington.
In 1934 he returned to Stanford,
was named professor of English
in 1950, and became head of the
