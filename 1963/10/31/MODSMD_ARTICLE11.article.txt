## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
The Mississippi mock vote for
Henry for Governor campaign
is "gaining in positive response,"
campaign manager Bob Moses
told the Daily from Jackson, Mis
sissippi last night. Moses said
that the Hattiesburg rally of last
night was "the big turn-about."
As the Daily spoke with Moses,
Allard Lowenstein and Stanford
student Fred Goff were leading
a major rally in Clarksdale, fea
turing Georgia's Negro Senator
Johnson as a speaker. Clarks
dale is the only town in which
mock vote workers arc currently
in jail. Two Yale students are
presently confined there.
Stanford students Holt Ruff in,
Hugh Smith, and Dennis Sweeney
are now in Oxford, Mississippi,
trying to determine Olc Miss re
actions to the mock vote, and
conducting interviews there. They
were with a SNCC worker in Ox
ford yesterday afternoon and
were stopped by police. They were
interrogated, but released, a 11 d
phoned back to Jackson from
a store across the street from the
police station. Today they move
on to Rust College in Holly
Springs, Mississippi.
PHONE CALLS were received
by the Daily yesterday from the
two Stanford cars that were still
on the road there. The four
Zctes called from Texarkana at
2:30 yesterday afternoon for in
structions on where to go upon
arriving in Jackson. They ex
pected to arrive at 11 last night.
Frank Dubofsky, Anson Garnsey.
Tony King, and George Mentz
are in that group. The other Stan
ford students called from Louisi
ana at 7 p.m.; the conversation
was conducted entirely in French
as they felt the instructions being

given them from California might
be taped. These others are Law
rence De√üivort, Ken Iverson, Jeff
Dennis-Straethmayer, Steve Les
ser, Didier Milhaud, and Terry
Taketa. All are Stanford students
with the exception of Milhaud
who is a Foothill freshman.
In Nachez, Mississippi yester
day a SNCC worker was picked
up on a stolen car charge a n d
imprisoned at $5,000 bail. He was
released when a telegram was re-

ceived confirming car registra
tion. In Tupelo yesterday, a mock
election organizer was unable to
remain in town due to police ac
tion.
Moses confirmed that Lowen
stein received today the first
$900 of Stanford money, mailed
last Monday morning. The Stan
ford total is now close to $5,000.
with $800 having been collected
in front of I he Post Office yester
day.
Reactions vary from commun
ity to community, Yale students
distributed leaflets in Laurel,
Mississippi yesterday with no
problem. "Laurel learned a les
son from the Hattiesburg rally,
and decided they couldn't make
a fuss about it," Moses stated.
MOSES DESCRIBED the five
dom ballot: The names of the
legal candidates for governor and
lieutenant governor appear on
the ballot in alphabetical order
along with those of Henry and
King. They are all in the same
size type. The ballot reads "Vole
for Freedom; This is an unoffi
cial ballot; Mark one choice with
an X."
"Votemobiles" will be on major
Mississippi highways and towns
on Saturday. Each will have poll
watchers who will check voting
age, and take names and ad
dreses of voters to assure "one
man- one vote."
"I expect the entire staff could
be arrested with the votemobiles
on Saturday," noted Moses. "All
the Negroes come to town to shop
on Saturday from the rural areas.
The police may just stop the
voting and jail us all."
On Friday night twenty-five
rallies will be hold simultaneously
throughout the state. Aaron
Henry will speak at a major one
in Jackson.
STANFORD STUDENTS Tom

Galbrailh and Skip Martin ad
dresed tho student senate and
residence officers the University
of Ihe Pacific in Stockton, Cali
fornia. yesterday evening. Inter
est. there was high; plane reserva
tions were made to fly three stu
dents to Jackson. Moses co n
sented to this in a phone conver
sation from Stockton.
Stanford students yesterday
spoke with San Francisco civil
rights attorneys, and secured the
guarantee of free legal aid from
five lawyers should any Stanford
student in Mississippi need it.
National publicity and Congres
sional action demands rank along
| with finances now, according to
Moses. It has been reported to
the Daily that NBC networks
have been giving news of Stan
ford activities nationally. Infor
mation has been sent out by the
i wire services. In a personal let
ter received at the Daily yester
day, Lowenstein indicated that
the justice department may be
moving in on Mississippi shortly.
Moses stated that ABC. CBS,
NBC, and the New York Times
have contacted Henry headquar
ters. The Collegiate Press Serv
ice has released lengthy informa
tion on Stanford activities to
campuses throughout the nation.
"We can't express what Stan
ford support has meant," Moses
said. He urged students to wire
their Congressmen to bring Con
gressional investigation of cur
rent activities in Mississippi, and
to write to home-town news
papers.
