Allard Lowenstein called as
the Daily went to press last
night and stated: "The cam
paign is a much greater suc
cess than we ever dreamed was
possible. There is no question
that Stanford and Yale have
changed the nature of the cam
paign in Mississippi. On the
basis of the Stanford funds, TV
time was bought, and leaflets
distributed in mass instead of
being picked up from the floor
after being used once. When
lie announced at the Clarksdale
Rally what Stanford had done,
the place went wild. This is
what can stop the intimidation,
the force of someone from the
outside."
