SPONSORS IN MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
The concern voiced by Mr. Hen
nion and Mr. Young regarding
a sponsor's obligations was
equally shared by Mr. Sweeney
and Mr. Smith before they de
cided to depart for Jackson, Mis
sissippi.
Both of these felt a two-fold
obligation. Their obligation to
the freshmen in their houses was
of great concern to them. It. was
only after careful consideration
of the results of their absence,
and only after Ihey received as
surances from the other sponsors
in their houses that the gap
created could be filled effectively!
for the time they were gone, that
they reached their decision.
In addition, they both had a
special concern for the situation
in the South; both have previ
ously worked there for the civil
rights movement, knew what go
ing there would entail, knew that
their experience would be of par
ticular help to the movement at
this time. Their personal respon
sibility, about which Mr. Hennion
and Mr. Young are justifiably
concerned, was surely seen by
them to extend beyond the con
fines of Stanford University.
Their obligation as sponsors could
be fulfilled by having other will
ing sponsors fill in for them for
the time, but their obligation as j
concerned individuals could only
be fulfilled by their presence in
Jackson at this time.
While sponsors live in the fresh- !
man residences at the pleasure
of the university administration,
and are compensated in part for
their time and effort, by free
room, the sponsor organization is
a student one. Ultimately every
student must weigh his obliga
tions in many areas and ask him
self where he must go and what
he must do. I am convinced that
these two men were most con
scientious about their behavior
in this matter, and no more can
be asked of them.
—PAUL STRASBURG,
Head Sponsor
Editor, The Daily:
In reference to the letter oppos
ing the defection of two Wilbur
Hall sponsors to Mississippi:
The concern expressed for the
"impressionable freshmen" is
commendable, but rather unneces
sary. If there is one thing fresh
men have in excess, it is people
to show them "what is expected
of them." I am referring to the
sponsors, faculty residents, stu
dent associates, faculty associ
ates, and faculty advisor-associ
ates as well. Stanford is certainly
foremost among colleges in its
provision for the well-being of
freshmen.
A second point in the letter was
the question of whether or not
students should get "caught up
in the emotions of our time and
forget their personal responsibili
ties." Personal responsibilities
being, in the case of the sponsors,
their duties toward the "impres
sionable freshmen." It seems to
me. however, that by going to
Mississippi the sponsors provided
an excellent example to their
charges, for they showed that
some Stanford students believe
very strongly in causes other
than their own grade point aver
age.
Although I, myself, am not in
clined to get "caught up in the
emotions of our time," I none
theless respect those who do sac
rifice their immediate personal
interests to a worthwhile cause.

Editor, The Daily:
Having experienced the trials
of a freshman year at Stanford,
I realize the necessity to be
guided through a very frighten
ing, even discriminatory society
where all are treated as equals,
except Freshmen. Dangerous
ideas predominate the campus,
and 1 was thankful for the tender
protection of my sponsor. Had I
been weaned at the early age of
six weeks (for no understandable
reason), I too would have suf
fered great anxiety. Impression
able freshmen, you have a worthy
cause. Go to Mississippi to re
trieve your unloyal sponsors.

MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
Increasing racial tensions and
outbreaks of racial violence, not
only in Mississippi but through

out the South during recent
months, have aroused the anxious
attention of intelligent Americans
everywhere.
I submit the following Letter
to the Editor found in Saturday
Review Alagasine (November 2,
1963, issue) with convictions simi
lar to those of the Pittsburgh,
Pa., couple who write it: namely,
that the nation's eye can and
should be focused on these fla
grant atrocities through the ve
hicle of the Press.
'WHAT CAN WE DO?"
Why have our newspapers not
published the following news,
which was read into the Congres
sional Record by Senator Paul
H. Douglas on September 4, 19G3?
Two white women gave first
hand accounts of their experi
ences in Southern jails. One was
Joyce Barrett, twenty-four-year
old graduate of Temple Univei'-
sity and cousin of Representative
William A. Barrett of Pennsyl
vania. She was jailed, with an
other white woman, in Albany,
Georgia, for passing out voter
registration leaflets on the streets.
She was sentenced to thirty days
in the Albany city jail. She told
of unspeakable conditions in the
jail, one of which she described as
follows: "We were stripped in
' view of male prisoners in the cell
| block. Our toilet facilities were
; next to a male cell with no sepa
ration in between. The policeman
came and stared at us, making
insinuations about our morals
| and taunting us for our beliefs."
The Student Non-Violent Coordi
nating Committee, with which
Miss Barrett works, "has filed
more than 100 affidavits with the
Justice Department in the last
year and a half with scant re
sults." Why?
The other firsthand account
was reported by Mrs. Jacob Kar
ro, wife of a Labor Department
lawyer and mother of three chil
dren. She was arrested in Dan
ville, Virginia, for carying a plac
ard saying "No More Segrega
tion" in a demonstration for more
job opportunities for Negroes.
Her accounts of conditions in the
jail are reminiscent of the hor
rors of Nazi concentration camps.
For example, from her cell in the
white section of the jail, she
"could hear young Negro girls
who had been arrested for demon
strating crying and screaming for
their mothers when they were
abused through painfid pelvic ex
amination." (Other sources have
ascertained that these examina
tions were conducted by fellow
prisoners, not by doctors, nurses,
or medical technicians.)
Can any of us in this country
sit back in comfort and permit
such things to occur in another
part of the country? What can
we do within our own communi
ties, North or South, to eliminate
the conditions that build up to
these atrocities?
—lUDY POTTER MILLER
Editor, The Daily:
In the past three days, it has
become obvious that the Stanford
Daily is being used to push the I
students of this university to an j
unprecedented fervor over a sit- j
uation that, exists in Mississippi. |
My first objection would be
that the top right story in last
Monday's Daily included a solici
tation for funds for a specified
purpose. In view of the treatment
of those who attempted to solicit
for CORE at James Baldwin's ad
dress here last spring, it would
seem that this use (or misuse)
of the Daily is in opposition to
past University policy.
However my primary objection
is that front page stories on this
subject, which are printed as
news, are rapidly taking on edi
torial overtones and arc there
fore simultaneously becoming
biased. The use (or again the
misuse) of the news section of
a newspaper to further a cause
dear to the editor's heart is not
within the acccptcd ethics of news
coverage.
As there exist a few of us who
feel that an influx of relatively
immature college students, who
have had little or no first hand
experience with the race situa
tion in the south, will most likely
aggravate the open sore of racial
strife rather than heal it, I would
like to see the editor's personal
prejudices confined to the edi
torial page and have the front
page left for news items.

SPONSORS IN MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
The concern voiced by Mr. Hen
nion and Mr. Young regarding
a sponsor's obligations was
equally shared by Mr. Sweeney
and Mr. Smith before they de
cided to depart for Jackson, Mis
sissippi.
Both of these felt a two-fold
obligation. Their obligation to
the freshmen in their houses was
of great concern to them. It. was
only after careful consideration
of the results of their absence,
and only after Ihey received as
surances from the other sponsors
in their houses that the gap
created could be filled effectively!
for the time they were gone, that
they reached their decision.
In addition, they both had a
special concern for the situation
in the South; both have previ
ously worked there for the civil
rights movement, knew what go
ing there would entail, knew that
their experience would be of par
ticular help to the movement at
this time. Their personal respon
sibility, about which Mr. Hennion
and Mr. Young are justifiably
concerned, was surely seen by
them to extend beyond the con
fines of Stanford University.
Their obligation as sponsors could
be fulfilled by having other will
ing sponsors fill in for them for
the time, but their obligation as j
concerned individuals could only
be fulfilled by their presence in
Jackson at this time.
While sponsors live in the fresh- !
man residences at the pleasure
of the university administration,
and are compensated in part for
their time and effort, by free
room, the sponsor organization is
a student one. Ultimately every
student must weigh his obliga
tions in many areas and ask him
self where he must go and what
he must do. I am convinced that
these two men were most con
scientious about their behavior
in this matter, and no more can
be asked of them.
—PAUL STRASBURG,
Head Sponsor
Editor, The Daily:
In reference to the letter oppos
ing the defection of two Wilbur
Hall sponsors to Mississippi:
The concern expressed for the
"impressionable freshmen" is
commendable, but rather unneces
sary. If there is one thing fresh
men have in excess, it is people
to show them "what is expected
of them." I am referring to the
sponsors, faculty residents, stu
dent associates, faculty associ
ates, and faculty advisor-associ
ates as well. Stanford is certainly
foremost among colleges in its
provision for the well-being of
freshmen.
A second point in the letter was
the question of whether or not
students should get "caught up
in the emotions of our time and
forget their personal responsibili
ties." Personal responsibilities
being, in the case of the sponsors,
their duties toward the "impres
sionable freshmen." It seems to
me. however, that by going to
Mississippi the sponsors provided
an excellent example to their
charges, for they showed that
some Stanford students believe
very strongly in causes other
than their own grade point aver
age.
Although I, myself, am not in
clined to get "caught up in the
emotions of our time," I none
theless respect those who do sac
rifice their immediate personal
interests to a worthwhile cause.

MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
Increasing racial tensions and
outbreaks of racial violence, not
only in Mississippi but through

out the South during recent
months, have aroused the anxious
attention of intelligent Americans
everywhere.
I submit the following Letter
to the Editor found in Saturday
Review Alagasine (November 2,
1963, issue) with convictions simi
lar to those of the Pittsburgh,
Pa., couple who write it: namely,
that the nation's eye can and
should be focused on these fla
grant atrocities through the ve
hicle of the Press.
'WHAT CAN WE DO?"
Why have our newspapers not
published the following news,
which was read into the Congres
sional Record by Senator Paul
H. Douglas on September 4, 19G3?
Two white women gave first
hand accounts of their experi
ences in Southern jails. One was
Joyce Barrett, twenty-four-year
old graduate of Temple Univei'-
sity and cousin of Representative
William A. Barrett of Pennsyl
vania. She was jailed, with an
other white woman, in Albany,
Georgia, for passing out voter
registration leaflets on the streets.
She was sentenced to thirty days
in the Albany city jail. She told
of unspeakable conditions in the
jail, one of which she described as
follows: "We were stripped in
' view of male prisoners in the cell
| block. Our toilet facilities were
; next to a male cell with no sepa
ration in between. The policeman
came and stared at us, making
insinuations about our morals
| and taunting us for our beliefs."
The Student Non-Violent Coordi
nating Committee, with which
Miss Barrett works, "has filed
more than 100 affidavits with the
Justice Department in the last
year and a half with scant re
sults." Why?
The other firsthand account
was reported by Mrs. Jacob Kar
ro, wife of a Labor Department
lawyer and mother of three chil
dren. She was arrested in Dan
ville, Virginia, for carying a plac
ard saying "No More Segrega
tion" in a demonstration for more
job opportunities for Negroes.
Her accounts of conditions in the
jail are reminiscent of the hor
rors of Nazi concentration camps.
For example, from her cell in the
white section of the jail, she
"could hear young Negro girls
who had been arrested for demon
strating crying and screaming for
their mothers when they were
abused through painfid pelvic ex
amination." (Other sources have
ascertained that these examina
tions were conducted by fellow
prisoners, not by doctors, nurses,
or medical technicians.)
Can any of us in this country
sit back in comfort and permit
such things to occur in another
part of the country? What can
we do within our own communi
ties, North or South, to eliminate
the conditions that build up to
these atrocities?
—lUDY POTTER MILLER
Editor, The Daily:
In the past three days, it has
become obvious that the Stanford
Daily is being used to push the I
students of this university to an j
unprecedented fervor over a sit- j
uation that, exists in Mississippi. |
My first objection would be
that the top right story in last
Monday's Daily included a solici
tation for funds for a specified
purpose. In view of the treatment
of those who attempted to solicit
for CORE at James Baldwin's ad
dress here last spring, it would
seem that this use (or misuse)
of the Daily is in opposition to
past University policy.

In the past three days, it has
become obvious that the Stanford
Daily is being used to push the I
students of this university to an j
unprecedented fervor over a sit- j
uation that, exists in Mississippi. |
My first objection would be
that the top right story in last
Monday's Daily included a solici
tation for funds for a specified
purpose. In view of the treatment
of those who attempted to solicit
for CORE at James Baldwin's ad
dress here last spring, it would
seem that this use (or misuse)
of the Daily is in opposition to
past University policy.
However my primary objection
is that front page stories on this
subject, which are printed as
news, are rapidly taking on edi
torial overtones and arc there
fore simultaneously becoming
biased. The use (or again the
misuse) of the news section of
a newspaper to further a cause
dear to the editor's heart is not
within the acccptcd ethics of news
coverage.
As there exist a few of us who
feel that an influx of relatively
immature college students, who
have had little or no first hand
experience with the race situa
tion in the south, will most likely
aggravate the open sore of racial

SPONSORS IN MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
The concern voiced by Mr. Hen
nion and Mr. Young regarding
a sponsor's obligations was
equally shared by Mr. Sweeney
and Mr. Smith before they de
cided to depart for Jackson, Mis
sissippi.
Both of these felt a two-fold
obligation. Their obligation to
the freshmen in their houses was
of great concern to them. It. was
only after careful consideration
of the results of their absence,
and only after Ihey received as
surances from the other sponsors
in their houses that the gap
created could be filled effectively!
for the time they were gone, that
they reached their decision.
In addition, they both had a
special concern for the situation
in the South; both have previ
ously worked there for the civil
rights movement, knew what go
ing there would entail, knew that
their experience would be of par
ticular help to the movement at
this time. Their personal respon
sibility, about which Mr. Hennion
and Mr. Young are justifiably
concerned, was surely seen by
them to extend beyond the con
fines of Stanford University.
Their obligation as sponsors could
be fulfilled by having other will
ing sponsors fill in for them for
the time, but their obligation as j
concerned individuals could only
be fulfilled by their presence in
Jackson at this time.
While sponsors live in the fresh- !
man residences at the pleasure
of the university administration,
and are compensated in part for
their time and effort, by free
room, the sponsor organization is
a student one. Ultimately every
student must weigh his obliga
tions in many areas and ask him
self where he must go and what
he must do. I am convinced that
these two men were most con
scientious about their behavior
in this matter, and no more can
be asked of them.
—PAUL STRASBURG,

Editor, The Daily:
In reference to the letter oppos
ing the defection of two Wilbur
Hall sponsors to Mississippi:
The concern expressed for the
"impressionable freshmen" is
commendable, but rather unneces
sary. If there is one thing fresh
men have in excess, it is people
to show them "what is expected
of them." I am referring to the
sponsors, faculty residents, stu
dent associates, faculty associ
ates, and faculty advisor-associ
ates as well. Stanford is certainly
foremost among colleges in its
provision for the well-being of
freshmen.
A second point in the letter was
the question of whether or not
students should get "caught up
in the emotions of our time and
forget their personal responsibili
ties." Personal responsibilities
being, in the case of the sponsors,
their duties toward the "impres
sionable freshmen." It seems to
me. however, that by going to
Mississippi the sponsors provided
an excellent example to their
charges, for they showed that
some Stanford students believe
very strongly in causes other
than their own grade point aver
age.
Although I, myself, am not in
clined to get "caught up in the

MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
Increasing racial tensions and
outbreaks of racial violence, not
only in Mississippi but through

out the South during recent
months, have aroused the anxious
attention of intelligent Americans
everywhere.
I submit the following Letter
to the Editor found in Saturday
Review Alagasine (November 2,
1963, issue) with convictions simi
lar to those of the Pittsburgh,
Pa., couple who write it: namely,
that the nation's eye can and
should be focused on these fla
grant atrocities through the ve
hicle of the Press.
'WHAT CAN WE DO?"
Why have our newspapers not
published the following news,
which was read into the Congres
sional Record by Senator Paul
H. Douglas on September 4, 19G3?
Two white women gave first
hand accounts of their experi
ences in Southern jails. One was
Joyce Barrett, twenty-four-year
old graduate of Temple Univei'-
sity and cousin of Representative
William A. Barrett of Pennsyl
vania. She was jailed, with an
other white woman, in Albany,
Georgia, for passing out voter
registration leaflets on the streets.
She was sentenced to thirty days
in the Albany city jail. She told
of unspeakable conditions in the
jail, one of which she described as
follows: "We were stripped in
' view of male prisoners in the cell
| block. Our toilet facilities were
; next to a male cell with no sepa
ration in between. The policeman
came and stared at us, making
insinuations about our morals
| and taunting us for our beliefs."
The Student Non-Violent Coordi
nating Committee, with which
Miss Barrett works, "has filed
more than 100 affidavits with the
Justice Department in the last
year and a half with scant re
sults." Why?
The other firsthand account
was reported by Mrs. Jacob Kar
ro, wife of a Labor Department
lawyer and mother of three chil
dren. She was arrested in Dan
ville, Virginia, for carying a plac
ard saying "No More Segrega
tion" in a demonstration for more
job opportunities for Negroes.
Her accounts of conditions in the
jail are reminiscent of the hor
rors of Nazi concentration camps.
For example, from her cell in the
white section of the jail, she
"could hear young Negro girls
who had been arrested for demon
strating crying and screaming for
their mothers when they were
abused through painfid pelvic ex
amination." (Other sources have
ascertained that these examina
tions were conducted by fellow
prisoners, not by doctors, nurses,
or medical technicians.)
Can any of us in this country
sit back in comfort and permit
such things to occur in another
part of the country? What can
we do within our own communi
ties, North or South, to eliminate
the conditions that build up to
these atrocities?

was reported by Mrs. Jacob Kar
ro, wife of a Labor Department
lawyer and mother of three chil
dren. She was arrested in Dan
ville, Virginia, for carying a plac

job opportunities for Negroes.
Her accounts of conditions in the
jail are reminiscent of the hor
rors of Nazi concentration camps.
For example, from her cell in the
white section of the jail, she
"could hear young Negro girls
who had been arrested for demon
strating crying and screaming for
their mothers when they were
abused through painfid pelvic ex
amination." (Other sources have
ascertained that these examina
tions were conducted by fellow
prisoners, not by doctors, nurses,
or medical technicians.)
Can any of us in this country
sit back in comfort and permit
such things to occur in another
part of the country? What can
we do within our own communi
ties, North or South, to eliminate
the conditions that build up to
these atrocities?

In the past three days, it has
become obvious that the Stanford
Daily is being used to push the I
students of this university to an j
unprecedented fervor over a sit- j
uation that, exists in Mississippi. |
My first objection would be
that the top right story in last
Monday's Daily included a solici
tation for funds for a specified
purpose. In view of the treatment
of those who attempted to solicit
for CORE at James Baldwin's ad
dress here last spring, it would
seem that this use (or misuse)
of the Daily is in opposition to
past University policy.
However my primary objection
is that front page stories on this
subject, which are printed as
news, are rapidly taking on edi
torial overtones and arc there
fore simultaneously becoming
biased. The use (or again the
misuse) of the news section of
a newspaper to further a cause
dear to the editor's heart is not
within the acccptcd ethics of news
coverage.
As there exist a few of us who
feel that an influx of relatively

SPONSORS IN MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
The concern voiced by Mr. Hen
nion and Mr. Young regarding
a sponsor's obligations was
equally shared by Mr. Sweeney
and Mr. Smith before they de
cided to depart for Jackson, Mis
sissippi.
Both of these felt a two-fold
obligation. Their obligation to
the freshmen in their houses was
of great concern to them. It. was
only after careful consideration
of the results of their absence,
and only after Ihey received as
surances from the other sponsors
in their houses that the gap
created could be filled effectively!
for the time they were gone, that
they reached their decision.
In addition, they both had a
special concern for the situation
in the South; both have previ
ously worked there for the civil
rights movement, knew what go
ing there would entail, knew that
their experience would be of par
ticular help to the movement at
this time. Their personal respon
sibility, about which Mr. Hennion
and Mr. Young are justifiably
concerned, was surely seen by
them to extend beyond the con
fines of Stanford University.
Their obligation as sponsors could
be fulfilled by having other will
ing sponsors fill in for them for
the time, but their obligation as j
concerned individuals could only
be fulfilled by their presence in
Jackson at this time.
While sponsors live in the fresh- !
man residences at the pleasure
of the university administration,
and are compensated in part for
their time and effort, by free
room, the sponsor organization is
a student one. Ultimately every
student must weigh his obliga
tions in many areas and ask him
self where he must go and what
he must do. I am convinced that
these two men were most con
scientious about their behavior
in this matter, and no more can
be asked of them.

Editor, The Daily:
In reference to the letter oppos
ing the defection of two Wilbur
Hall sponsors to Mississippi:
The concern expressed for the
"impressionable freshmen" is
commendable, but rather unneces
sary. If there is one thing fresh
men have in excess, it is people
to show them "what is expected
of them." I am referring to the
sponsors, faculty residents, stu
dent associates, faculty associ
ates, and faculty advisor-associ
ates as well. Stanford is certainly
foremost among colleges in its
provision for the well-being of
freshmen.
A second point in the letter was
the question of whether or not
students should get "caught up
in the emotions of our time and
forget their personal responsibili
ties." Personal responsibilities
being, in the case of the sponsors,
their duties toward the "impres
sionable freshmen." It seems to
me. however, that by going to
Mississippi the sponsors provided
an excellent example to their
charges, for they showed that
some Stanford students believe
very strongly in causes other
than their own grade point aver
age.
Although I, myself, am not in

MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
Increasing racial tensions and
outbreaks of racial violence, not
only in Mississippi but through

out the South during recent
months, have aroused the anxious
attention of intelligent Americans
everywhere.
I submit the following Letter
to the Editor found in Saturday
Review Alagasine (November 2,
1963, issue) with convictions simi
lar to those of the Pittsburgh,
Pa., couple who write it: namely,
that the nation's eye can and
should be focused on these fla
grant atrocities through the ve
hicle of the Press.
'WHAT CAN WE DO?"
Why have our newspapers not
published the following news,
which was read into the Congres
sional Record by Senator Paul
H. Douglas on September 4, 19G3?
Two white women gave first
hand accounts of their experi
ences in Southern jails. One was
Joyce Barrett, twenty-four-year
old graduate of Temple Univei'-
sity and cousin of Representative
William A. Barrett of Pennsyl
vania. She was jailed, with an
other white woman, in Albany,
Georgia, for passing out voter
registration leaflets on the streets.
She was sentenced to thirty days
in the Albany city jail. She told
of unspeakable conditions in the
jail, one of which she described as
follows: "We were stripped in
' view of male prisoners in the cell
| block. Our toilet facilities were
; next to a male cell with no sepa
ration in between. The policeman
came and stared at us, making
insinuations about our morals
| and taunting us for our beliefs."
The Student Non-Violent Coordi
nating Committee, with which
Miss Barrett works, "has filed
more than 100 affidavits with the
Justice Department in the last
year and a half with scant re
sults." Why?
The other firsthand account
was reported by Mrs. Jacob Kar
ro, wife of a Labor Department
lawyer and mother of three chil
dren. She was arrested in Dan
ville, Virginia, for carying a plac
ard saying "No More Segrega
tion" in a demonstration for more
job opportunities for Negroes.

Editor, The Daily:
In the past three days, it has
become obvious that the Stanford
Daily is being used to push the I
students of this university to an j
unprecedented fervor over a sit- j
uation that, exists in Mississippi. |
My first objection would be
that the top right story in last
Monday's Daily included a solici
tation for funds for a specified
purpose. In view of the treatment
of those who attempted to solicit
for CORE at James Baldwin's ad
dress here last spring, it would
seem that this use (or misuse)
of the Daily is in opposition to
past University policy.
However my primary objection
is that front page stories on this
subject, which are printed as
news, are rapidly taking on edi
torial overtones and arc there
fore simultaneously becoming
biased. The use (or again the
misuse) of the news section of
a newspaper to further a cause
dear to the editor's heart is not
within the acccptcd ethics of news
coverage.
As there exist a few of us who
feel that an influx of relatively
immature college students, who
have had little or no first hand
experience with the race situa
tion in the south, will most likely
aggravate the open sore of racial
strife rather than heal it, I would
like to see the editor's personal
prejudices confined to the edi
torial page and have the front
page left for news items.

SPONSORS IN MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
The concern voiced by Mr. Hen
nion and Mr. Young regarding
a sponsor's obligations was
equally shared by Mr. Sweeney
and Mr. Smith before they de
cided to depart for Jackson, Mis
sissippi.
Both of these felt a two-fold
obligation. Their obligation to
the freshmen in their houses was
of great concern to them. It. was
only after careful consideration
of the results of their absence,
and only after Ihey received as
surances from the other sponsors
in their houses that the gap
created could be filled effectively!
for the time they were gone, that
they reached their decision.
In addition, they both had a
special concern for the situation
in the South; both have previ
ously worked there for the civil
rights movement, knew what go
ing there would entail, knew that
their experience would be of par
ticular help to the movement at
this time. Their personal respon
sibility, about which Mr. Hennion
and Mr. Young are justifiably
concerned, was surely seen by
them to extend beyond the con
fines of Stanford University.
Their obligation as sponsors could
be fulfilled by having other will
ing sponsors fill in for them for
the time, but their obligation as j
concerned individuals could only
be fulfilled by their presence in
Jackson at this time.
While sponsors live in the fresh- !
man residences at the pleasure
of the university administration,
and are compensated in part for
their time and effort, by free
room, the sponsor organization is
a student one. Ultimately every
student must weigh his obliga
tions in many areas and ask him
self where he must go and what
he must do. I am convinced that
these two men were most con
scientious about their behavior
in this matter, and no more can
be asked of them.
—PAUL STRASBURG,
Head Sponsor
Editor, The Daily:
In reference to the letter oppos
ing the defection of two Wilbur
Hall sponsors to Mississippi:
The concern expressed for the
"impressionable freshmen" is
commendable, but rather unneces
sary. If there is one thing fresh
men have in excess, it is people
to show them "what is expected
of them." I am referring to the
sponsors, faculty residents, stu
dent associates, faculty associ
ates, and faculty advisor-associ
ates as well. Stanford is certainly
foremost among colleges in its
provision for the well-being of
freshmen.
A second point in the letter was
the question of whether or not
students should get "caught up
in the emotions of our time and
forget their personal responsibili
ties." Personal responsibilities
being, in the case of the sponsors,
their duties toward the "impres
sionable freshmen." It seems to
me. however, that by going to
Mississippi the sponsors provided
an excellent example to their
charges, for they showed that
some Stanford students believe
very strongly in causes other
than their own grade point aver
age.
Although I, myself, am not in
clined to get "caught up in the
emotions of our time," I none
theless respect those who do sac
rifice their immediate personal
interests to a worthwhile cause.
—DAVID ALKIRE
Editor, The Daily:
Having experienced the trials
of a freshman year at Stanford,
I realize the necessity to be
guided through a very frighten
ing, even discriminatory society
where all are treated as equals,
except Freshmen. Dangerous
ideas predominate the campus,
and 1 was thankful for the tender
protection of my sponsor. Had I
been weaned at the early age of
six weeks (for no understandable
reason), I too would have suf
fered great anxiety. Impression
able freshmen, you have a worthy
cause. Go to Mississippi to re
trieve your unloyal sponsors.

MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
Increasing racial tensions and
outbreaks of racial violence, not
only in Mississippi but through

out the South during recent
months, have aroused the anxious
attention of intelligent Americans
everywhere.
I submit the following Letter
to the Editor found in Saturday
Review Alagasine (November 2,
1963, issue) with convictions simi
lar to those of the Pittsburgh,
Pa., couple who write it: namely,
that the nation's eye can and
should be focused on these fla
grant atrocities through the ve
hicle of the Press.
'WHAT CAN WE DO?"
Why have our newspapers not
published the following news,
which was read into the Congres
sional Record by Senator Paul
H. Douglas on September 4, 19G3?
Two white women gave first
hand accounts of their experi
ences in Southern jails. One was
Joyce Barrett, twenty-four-year
old graduate of Temple Univei'-
sity and cousin of Representative
William A. Barrett of Pennsyl
vania. She was jailed, with an
other white woman, in Albany,
Georgia, for passing out voter
registration leaflets on the streets.
She was sentenced to thirty days
in the Albany city jail. She told
of unspeakable conditions in the
jail, one of which she described as
follows: "We were stripped in
' view of male prisoners in the cell
| block. Our toilet facilities were
; next to a male cell with no sepa
ration in between. The policeman
came and stared at us, making
insinuations about our morals
| and taunting us for our beliefs."
The Student Non-Violent Coordi
nating Committee, with which
Miss Barrett works, "has filed
more than 100 affidavits with the
Justice Department in the last
year and a half with scant re
sults." Why?
The other firsthand account
was reported by Mrs. Jacob Kar
ro, wife of a Labor Department
lawyer and mother of three chil
dren. She was arrested in Dan
ville, Virginia, for carying a plac
ard saying "No More Segrega
tion" in a demonstration for more
job opportunities for Negroes.
Her accounts of conditions in the
jail are reminiscent of the hor
rors of Nazi concentration camps.
For example, from her cell in the
white section of the jail, she
"could hear young Negro girls
who had been arrested for demon
strating crying and screaming for
their mothers when they were
abused through painfid pelvic ex
amination." (Other sources have
ascertained that these examina
tions were conducted by fellow
prisoners, not by doctors, nurses,
or medical technicians.)
Can any of us in this country
sit back in comfort and permit
such things to occur in another
part of the country? What can
we do within our own communi
ties, North or South, to eliminate
the conditions that build up to
these atrocities?
