As directors of Axe Commis
sion we want to thank all the
student body for the tremendous
support on Saturday. The CBS i
people told us, again, that we
were the best group they had ever
seen and the most cooperative.
Telegrams have been coming in
from all over the United States
congratulating Ihe University on
what a fine show we put on. This
is a great tribute to you people.
Throughout all the stunts there
was never one card out of place.
As a result of this and in hopes
that we are again 'Bitchin" at Big
Game, there will be no card stunts
at the Washington State game—
and there will be a jazz group
then. Again we would like to say
you are the best people to work
with—and the best rooting sec
tion in the country.

ROTC
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Holly Chenery seems wor
ried that the atmosphere neces
sary for the proper "growth of
the individual" at Stanford is pol
luted and rendered les evervating
by the presence of ROTC. What
is this "growth of the individual"
which is incompatible with mili
tary science?
If we consider the word
"growth" independently, it obvi
ously can refer to movement in
any direction, positive or nega
tive, and certainly the learning of
martial skills is growth of sorts.
Therefore, it must be that Miss
Chenery is no t championing
"growth of the individual" per se,
but growth in a particular direc
tion. The direction she chooses
is the anti-martial one.
But that is her own moral judg
ment. It is an opinion, a choice,
to which she is entitled, but
which she has no more right to
press on someone else than Ihe
local sergeant has to enforce his
preference. This is the very rea
son that the specific program to
which Miss Chenery objects is,
as she admits, voluntary.
However, I would question even
Miss Chenery's value judgment
as to the worth of military train
ing. Implicit in her argument
that such education is morally
wrong is the assumption that "in
struction in learning to kill," to
put it in an unsophisticated man
ner, required moral approval of
killing.
Might I suggest that I, for one.
concur in President Kennedy's
opinion that this is simply not
true. The avowed "purpose" of
the armed forces is to prevent
war by being supremely capable
of winning war. Such capability
requires superiority in military
skills. To use Miss Chenery's
analogy, many very respectable
schools do, in fact, provide the
opportunity for individuals to
learn how to crack safes. In fact
every police academy in the coun
try does. In order to beat the bad
guy (or to prevent his doing bad
things) you have to understand
his tactics. A good cop knows the
safecracker's techniques and tools
(and those of the murderer also)
as well as the wrongdoer. A good
keeper of the peace knows his
(and civilization's) enemy's tech
niques and tools also. His very
existence demonstrates disap
proval of those techniques and
their consequences.

Editor, The Daily:
Miss Chenery's letter in Friday's
Daily on the ROTC programs at
Stanford is the latest in a series
advocating a policy which, to me,
shows an incredible lack of objec
tive reasoning. It seems super
fluous to repeat that the basic
Communist doctrine is world
domination — they themselves
have said this on occasions too
numerous to mention — and the
only force standing in their way
is the military power of the West,
in particular that of the United
States. Mr. Khrushchev is cur
rently on his co-existence kick be
cause and only because he rea
lized that Russia would not be
able to match the military power
of the United States within the
foreseeable future. If he ever
becomes convinced otherwise, he
will lose no time in switching
back to a policy of military ag
gression.
Now, the military strength of
the United States will be m a i n
tained only as long as we are
prepared to use it if it becomes
necessary. This means relatively
large armed forces, and these in
turn need a large number of
trained officers.
This training could be and to
a certain extent is accomplished
at special schools, but as one very
important part of an officer's
training consists of a college edu
cation, it is much easier and more
efficient for the government to
make use of the existing educa
tional facilities than to duplicate
them with a large number of mili
tary academies. An idea of the
importance of the college ROTC
programs in the U.S. military
makeup is shown by these facts:
The U.S. Army takes into the
service each year approximately
20,000 new officers; in a recent
year 600 of these men came from
West Point, 1,800 from Officer's
Candidate Schools and 18,000
from the college ROTC programs.
It is not hard to see, then, the
vital role played by the ROTC
program in the U.S. defense
struct ure.
It seems then, to me at least,
that anyone seriously advocating
the 1 abolishment of ROTC pro
grams must either be so unbeliev
ably short-sighted that they can
not see the basic importance of
maintaining a strong armed
forces, or they must be so hypo
critical that they l-ealize the need,
but do not want to be associated
somehow with the persons that
protect their freedom because
they might be contaminated by
the abstractly dirty idea of war.
In which case one is reminded of
the poem "Tommy" by Rudyard
Kipling.
And finally, I am somewhat
mystified by Miss Chenery's last
statement that . . the univer
sity should concern itself with
active efforts to prevent the en
croachment of military attitudes
and training into the lives of its
students." I wasn't aware that
the ROTC programs were en
croaching that much on the stu
dent's lives. In fact I doubt this
very seriously. Certainly they
aren't encroaching as much as
Russion tanks and soldiers would.
Perhaps Miss Chenery and a
number of others on this campus
should go back and review some
of the basic histories of democ
racies. They last only as long as
their citizens aie willing to de
fend them. As a famous man
once said, "Eternal Vigilance is
the price of democracy."

gression.
Now, the military strength of
the United States will be m a i n
tained only as long as we are
prepared to use it if it becomes
necessary. This means relatively
large armed forces, and these in
turn need a large number of
trained officers.
This training could be and to
a certain extent is accomplished
at special schools, but as one very
important part of an officer's
training consists of a college edu
cation, it is much easier and more
efficient for the government to
make use of the existing educa
tional facilities than to duplicate
them with a large number of mili
tary academies. An idea of the
importance of the college ROTC
programs in the U.S. military
makeup is shown by these facts:
The U.S. Army takes into the
service each year approximately
20,000 new officers; in a recent
year 600 of these men came from
West Point, 1,800 from Officer's
Candidate Schools and 18,000
from the college ROTC programs.
It is not hard to see, then, the
vital role played by the ROTC
program in the U.S. defense
struct ure.
It seems then, to me at least,
that anyone seriously advocating
the 1 abolishment of ROTC pro
grams must either be so unbeliev
ably short-sighted that they can
not see the basic importance of
maintaining a strong armed
forces, or they must be so hypo
critical that they l-ealize the need,
but do not want to be associated
somehow with the persons that
protect their freedom because
they might be contaminated by
the abstractly dirty idea of war.
In which case one is reminded of
the poem "Tommy" by Rudyard
Kipling.
And finally, I am somewhat
mystified by Miss Chenery's last
statement that . . the univer
sity should concern itself with
active efforts to prevent the en
croachment of military attitudes
and training into the lives of its
students." I wasn't aware that
the ROTC programs were en
croaching that much on the stu
dent's lives. In fact I doubt this
very seriously. Certainly they
aren't encroaching as much as
Russion tanks and soldiers would.
Perhaps Miss Chenery and a
number of others on this campus
should go back and review some
of the basic histories of democ
racies. They last only as long as
their citizens aie willing to de
fend them. As a famous man
once said, "Eternal Vigilance is
the price of democracy."

ROTC
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Holly Chenery seems wor
ried that the atmosphere neces
sary for the proper "growth of
the individual" at Stanford is pol
luted and rendered les evervating
by the presence of ROTC. What
is this "growth of the individual"
which is incompatible with mili
tary science?
If we consider the word
"growth" independently, it obvi
ously can refer to movement in
any direction, positive or nega
tive, and certainly the learning of
martial skills is growth of sorts.
Therefore, it must be that Miss
Chenery is no t championing
"growth of the individual" per se,
but growth in a particular direc
tion. The direction she chooses
is the anti-martial one.
But that is her own moral judg
ment. It is an opinion, a choice,
to which she is entitled, but
which she has no more right to
press on someone else than Ihe
local sergeant has to enforce his
preference. This is the very rea
son that the specific program to
which Miss Chenery objects is,
as she admits, voluntary.
However, I would question even
Miss Chenery's value judgment
as to the worth of military train
ing. Implicit in her argument
that such education is morally
wrong is the assumption that "in
struction in learning to kill," to
put it in an unsophisticated man
ner, required moral approval of
killing.
Might I suggest that I, for one.
concur in President Kennedy's
opinion that this is simply not
true. The avowed "purpose" of
the armed forces is to prevent
war by being supremely capable
of winning war. Such capability
requires superiority in military
skills. To use Miss Chenery's
analogy, many very respectable
schools do, in fact, provide the
opportunity for individuals to
learn how to crack safes. In fact
every police academy in the coun
try does. In order to beat the bad
guy (or to prevent his doing bad
things) you have to understand
his tactics. A good cop knows the
safecracker's techniques and tools
(and those of the murderer also)
as well as the wrongdoer. A good
keeper of the peace knows his
(and civilization's) enemy's tech
niques and tools also. His very
existence demonstrates disap
proval of those techniques and
their consequences.

Editor, The Daily:
Miss Chenery's letter in Friday's
Daily on the ROTC programs at
Stanford is the latest in a series
advocating a policy which, to me,
shows an incredible lack of objec
tive reasoning. It seems super
fluous to repeat that the basic
Communist doctrine is world
domination — they themselves
have said this on occasions too
numerous to mention — and the
only force standing in their way
is the military power of the West,
in particular that of the United
States. Mr. Khrushchev is cur
rently on his co-existence kick be
cause and only because he rea
lized that Russia would not be
able to match the military power
of the United States within the
foreseeable future. If he ever
becomes convinced otherwise, he
will lose no time in switching

gression.

Chenery is no t championing
"growth of the individual" per se,
but growth in a particular direc
tion. The direction she chooses
is the anti-martial one.
But that is her own moral judg
ment. It is an opinion, a choice,
to which she is entitled, but
which she has no more right to
press on someone else than Ihe
local sergeant has to enforce his
preference. This is the very rea
son that the specific program to
which Miss Chenery objects is,
as she admits, voluntary.
However, I would question even
Miss Chenery's value judgment
as to the worth of military train
ing. Implicit in her argument
that such education is morally
wrong is the assumption that "in
struction in learning to kill," to
put it in an unsophisticated man
ner, required moral approval of
killing.
Might I suggest that I, for one.
concur in President Kennedy's
opinion that this is simply not
true. The avowed "purpose" of
the armed forces is to prevent
war by being supremely capable
of winning war. Such capability
requires superiority in military
skills. To use Miss Chenery's
analogy, many very respectable
schools do, in fact, provide the
opportunity for individuals to
learn how to crack safes. In fact
every police academy in the coun
try does. In order to beat the bad
guy (or to prevent his doing bad
things) you have to understand
his tactics. A good cop knows the
safecracker's techniques and tools
(and those of the murderer also)
as well as the wrongdoer. A good
keeper of the peace knows his
(and civilization's) enemy's tech
niques and tools also. His very
existence demonstrates disap
proval of those techniques and
their consequences.

Editor, The Daily:
Miss Chenery's letter in Friday's
Daily on the ROTC programs at
Stanford is the latest in a series
advocating a policy which, to me,
shows an incredible lack of objec
tive reasoning. It seems super
fluous to repeat that the basic
Communist doctrine is world
domination — they themselves
have said this on occasions too
numerous to mention — and the
only force standing in their way
is the military power of the West,
in particular that of the United
States. Mr. Khrushchev is cur
rently on his co-existence kick be
cause and only because he rea
lized that Russia would not be
able to match the military power
of the United States within the
foreseeable future. If he ever
becomes convinced otherwise, he
will lose no time in switching
back to a policy of military ag
gression.
Now, the military strength of
the United States will be m a i n
tained only as long as we are
prepared to use it if it becomes
necessary. This means relatively
large armed forces, and these in
turn need a large number of
trained officers.
This training could be and to
a certain extent is accomplished
at special schools, but as one very
important part of an officer's
training consists of a college edu
cation, it is much easier and more
efficient for the government to
make use of the existing educa
tional facilities than to duplicate
them with a large number of mili
tary academies. An idea of the
importance of the college ROTC
programs in the U.S. military
makeup is shown by these facts:
The U.S. Army takes into the
service each year approximately
20,000 new officers; in a recent
year 600 of these men came from
West Point, 1,800 from Officer's
Candidate Schools and 18,000
from the college ROTC programs.
It is not hard to see, then, the
vital role played by the ROTC
program in the U.S. defense
struct ure.
It seems then, to me at least,
that anyone seriously advocating
the 1 abolishment of ROTC pro
grams must either be so unbeliev
ably short-sighted that they can
not see the basic importance of
maintaining a strong armed
forces, or they must be so hypo
critical that they l-ealize the need,
but do not want to be associated
somehow with the persons that
protect their freedom because
they might be contaminated by
the abstractly dirty idea of war.
In which case one is reminded of
the poem "Tommy" by Rudyard
Kipling.
And finally, I am somewhat
mystified by Miss Chenery's last
statement that . . the univer
sity should concern itself with
active efforts to prevent the en
croachment of military attitudes
and training into the lives of its
students." I wasn't aware that
the ROTC programs were en
croaching that much on the stu
dent's lives. In fact I doubt this
very seriously. Certainly they
aren't encroaching as much as
Russion tanks and soldiers would.
Perhaps Miss Chenery and a
number of others on this campus
should go back and review some
of the basic histories of democ
racies. They last only as long as
their citizens aie willing to de
fend them. As a famous man
once said, "Eternal Vigilance is
the price of democracy."

the ROTC programs were en
croaching that much on the stu

very seriously. Certainly they
aren't encroaching as much as
Russion tanks and soldiers would.
Perhaps Miss Chenery and a
number of others on this campus
should go back and review some
of the basic histories of democ

As directors of Axe Commis
sion we want to thank all the
student body for the tremendous
support on Saturday. The CBS i
people told us, again, that we
were the best group they had ever
seen and the most cooperative.
Telegrams have been coming in
from all over the United States
congratulating Ihe University on
what a fine show we put on. This
is a great tribute to you people.
Throughout all the stunts there
was never one card out of place.
As a result of this and in hopes
that we are again 'Bitchin" at Big
Game, there will be no card stunts
at the Washington State game—
and there will be a jazz group
then. Again we would like to say
you are the best people to work
with—and the best rooting sec
tion in the country.

ROTC
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Holly Chenery seems wor
ried that the atmosphere neces
sary for the proper "growth of
the individual" at Stanford is pol
luted and rendered les evervating
by the presence of ROTC. What
is this "growth of the individual"
which is incompatible with mili
tary science?
If we consider the word
"growth" independently, it obvi
ously can refer to movement in
any direction, positive or nega
tive, and certainly the learning of
martial skills is growth of sorts.
Therefore, it must be that Miss
Chenery is no t championing
"growth of the individual" per se,
but growth in a particular direc
tion. The direction she chooses
is the anti-martial one.
But that is her own moral judg
ment. It is an opinion, a choice,
to which she is entitled, but
which she has no more right to
press on someone else than Ihe
local sergeant has to enforce his
preference. This is the very rea
son that the specific program to
which Miss Chenery objects is,
as she admits, voluntary.
However, I would question even
Miss Chenery's value judgment
as to the worth of military train
ing. Implicit in her argument
that such education is morally
wrong is the assumption that "in
struction in learning to kill," to
put it in an unsophisticated man
ner, required moral approval of
killing.
Might I suggest that I, for one.
concur in President Kennedy's
opinion that this is simply not
true. The avowed "purpose" of
the armed forces is to prevent
war by being supremely capable
of winning war. Such capability
requires superiority in military
skills. To use Miss Chenery's
analogy, many very respectable
schools do, in fact, provide the
opportunity for individuals to
learn how to crack safes. In fact
every police academy in the coun
try does. In order to beat the bad
guy (or to prevent his doing bad
things) you have to understand
his tactics. A good cop knows the
safecracker's techniques and tools
(and those of the murderer also)
as well as the wrongdoer. A good
keeper of the peace knows his
(and civilization's) enemy's tech
niques and tools also. His very
existence demonstrates disap
proval of those techniques and
their consequences.

Editor, The Daily:
Miss Chenery's letter in Friday's
Daily on the ROTC programs at
Stanford is the latest in a series
advocating a policy which, to me,
shows an incredible lack of objec
tive reasoning. It seems super
fluous to repeat that the basic
Communist doctrine is world
domination — they themselves
have said this on occasions too
numerous to mention — and the
only force standing in their way
is the military power of the West,
in particular that of the United
States. Mr. Khrushchev is cur
rently on his co-existence kick be
cause and only because he rea
lized that Russia would not be
able to match the military power
of the United States within the
foreseeable future. If he ever
becomes convinced otherwise, he
will lose no time in switching
back to a policy of military ag
gression.
Now, the military strength of
the United States will be m a i n
tained only as long as we are
prepared to use it if it becomes
necessary. This means relatively
large armed forces, and these in
turn need a large number of
trained officers.
This training could be and to
a certain extent is accomplished
at special schools, but as one very
important part of an officer's
training consists of a college edu
cation, it is much easier and more
efficient for the government to
make use of the existing educa
tional facilities than to duplicate
them with a large number of mili
tary academies. An idea of the
importance of the college ROTC
programs in the U.S. military
makeup is shown by these facts:
The U.S. Army takes into the
service each year approximately
20,000 new officers; in a recent
year 600 of these men came from
West Point, 1,800 from Officer's
Candidate Schools and 18,000
from the college ROTC programs.
It is not hard to see, then, the
vital role played by the ROTC
program in the U.S. defense
struct ure.
It seems then, to me at least,
that anyone seriously advocating
the 1 abolishment of ROTC pro
grams must either be so unbeliev
ably short-sighted that they can
not see the basic importance of
maintaining a strong armed
forces, or they must be so hypo
critical that they l-ealize the need,
but do not want to be associated
somehow with the persons that
protect their freedom because
they might be contaminated by
the abstractly dirty idea of war.
In which case one is reminded of
the poem "Tommy" by Rudyard
Kipling.
And finally, I am somewhat
mystified by Miss Chenery's last
