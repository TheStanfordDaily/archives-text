# OSU Awaits Tribe

### TOM ELIAS 
Despite their inspired upset
victory over mighty Notre Dame
last weekend, New York bookies
have installed Coach John Ral
ston's Stanford Indians as a four
point underdog to the Oregon Bea
vers in this Saturday's contest at
Corvallis.
While the Indians have won
only twice this season, the sea
son opener over San Jose State
and last Saturday over the Fight
ing Irish, Coach Tommy Prothro's
Orange and Black warriors have
won four times, over Utah. Colo
rado, Baylor in an upset, and over
Washington State two weeks ago
in their last home game.
THE SEASONAL patterns of
ihe two teams, if Stanford's San
Jose game is disregarded, present
a study in contrasts. The only
game Ralston's men have really
been out of all season was the
second contest and first real test,
the Oregon debacle in which they
fumbled seven times.
Since then the Tribe has im
proved with each outing, losing
to UCLA by one point on a late
pass interception, to Rice at Hou
ston after leading at the half, to
Washington on a debated offen
sive interference call on a late
touchdown pass which could have
resulted in a tie, and finally jell
ing in Saturday's game against
Notre Dame.
The Beavers, on Ihe other hand,
started strongly, beating their
first three opponents, slacked off

against Washington three weeks
ago at Seattle, rebounded with a
victory over WSU, and last week
were routed 30 to 8 by Ben
Schwartbwalder's Syracuse unit.
TIIK STRONG start made by
OSIJ despite the loss of Heisman
Award winner Terry Baker, now
with the Los Angeles Rams of the
NFL, was due primarily to the
fine passing combination of Gor
don Queen and Vern Burke.
With Baker throwing to him
last season. Burke caught G9
passes for 1,007 yards, setting two
all-time collegiate records. This

season ho has caught touchdown
passes in every game for Oregon
State except its two losses.
Queen, as understudy to Baker
last year, managed to letter while
only a sophomore and threw for
213 yards and four touchdowns in
the brief lime he did play.
THIO IMPRESSIVE perform
ances of these two in all of OSU's
wins and the fact that they have
been effectively bottled up in
State's only losses would seem to
indicate that they are certainly
the key to Tommy Prothro's off
ense.
Ralston and his staff managed
last week to devise a defense
capable of stopping Notre Dame's
vaunted passing combination of
Frank Budka and Jim Kelly.
Stanford supporters can only
hope that Coach Ralston and the
Card denfensive unit, led by Craig
Ritchey, Dick Ragsdale, and A 1
Hildcbrand can do as well at Cor
vallis this week.
