LOS ANGELES (UPI) Rob
ert Mann's English is coming
back to him.
Arriving at International Air
port Sunday after spending 21
months in East German prisons,
I lie 20-year-old student had little
trouble saying to his waiting fam
ily, "It's great to be home," and,
"Donald, you're pretty darned
big."
Mann had been studying at
Stanford overseas campus at
Stuttgart in Germany before he
was arrested Jan. 22, 19152, for
trying to help an East German
escape to the West.
Till] COMMUNISTS released
Mann at the end of his term last
Wednesday. In a Berlin news
conference two days later. Mann
had difficulty with some English
words and phrases, because he
spoke only German during hi s
imprisonment.
He described prison conditions
as rather poor although he said
he was never physically under
pressure.
"THEY HAD some cells . . .
cots. I was very carefully ob
served through an observation
hole in the door," he said.
He said during numerous in
terrogation sessions that "you
sit in a corner, and if they know
you know something then you're
under pressure until you say
something."
Mann said, "I don't regret it,
trying to help the East German
escape. I said it in court and I
said it in the interrogations."
