# Girls Play Intramurals
## 
### MARY EDWARDS GLENN NOLTE 
Tentively scheduled for this
weekend two women's living
groups will engage in a football
game.
The coming contest features
two of the university's top-seeded
football power "houses"- Naran
ja and Alondra.
BOTH TEAMS come into to
day's game fresh from an off
t he-field victory â€” against the
powerful Women's Recreation
Association, which refused to al
locate the necessary funds 112 or
footballs. But the girls were not
to bo denied. Spurred on by the
spirit of PACE, they somehow
managed to procure the needed
pigskin.
The WRA opposition was based
on the assumption that football
is not a recognized women's sport,
but the girls disagreed. They con
tended that football is fun, good
exercise, and offers a release com
parable to the Sunday Flicks.
Partcipating in the games also
gives the girls greater insight
into the intricacies of this previ
ously men-dominated sport.
Both teams are underfeated,
unscored upon, and unproven.
But according to their coaches
are "really tough." Their only
previous meeting was a scrim
mage. In a tight defensive bat
tle, the advantage seesawed back
and forth, but neither team was
able to muster a sustained drive.
The result was a 0-0 deadlock.
ALONDRA AND NAKANJA
are but two of the contenders in
this power-packed league. Other
teams with a shot at the title are
Olivo, Cardenal, and Roth.
Each team is made up of seven
players, generally coached by a
sympathetic male. Teams play
under the same intramural
"touch" rules as men's residences.
Feeling is running high, prac
tices have been spirited, and all
the teams are keyed for the com
ing season. In its third year of
competition, Naran.ja rates an
edge in the league play on ex
perience. Oddsmakers have made
them 3 to 1 favorites, unless the
fates, or dates, intervene.
League authorities report they
are considering staging a post
season contest between the league
champion and the San Francisco
Forty-Niners, on Ihe thesis that
if the Rams can beat the Forty-
Niners, anvone can.
