# â€˜Salome Tryouts' To Begin Tonight
## 
### 
Open tryouts for Oscar Wilde's
"Salome" are being held tonight
and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in
Room 129. Memorial Auditorium.
There are openings for ten men
and five women in the Stanford
Players Studio Theatre presen
tation of the Wilde play.
"Salome" was banned in Eng
land when first written by Wilde,
but was performed by Sarah
Bernhardt in Paris in 1894 to
great acclaim. A poetic drama
of considerable exoticism. "Sa
lonme," according to Michael Ad
dison of the Stanford Players, is
a dramatic reminder- that Wilde
was not limited to the comic
form. Turning upon the passion
of Salome for "Jokanaan," Wilde
transforms the Biblical incident
of the beheading of John the Bap
tist into a drama of thwarted
love and bloody revenge.
The cast of "Salome" will be
selected only from members of
the Stanford community, and un
dergraduates will be given par
ticular preference.
The play, lo be staged Novem
ber 22, and 23. in the Nightery
Theatre, wil be directed by An
thony Lorraine, a graduate stu
dent in drama.
