# Satirized Ad Nearly Causes Humor Magazine's Suspension
## 
### 
Racial furor over a satirized
advertisement in tho Pelican,
campus humor magazine at the
University of California at Berk
eley, placed that student publi
cation in danger of suspension
last week, according (o a report
in the Daily Califorian.
The advertisement pictured Uni
versity senior Akin Adubifa, a
Negro from Nigeria, lighting a
cigarette, with the words, "Only
pure white touches your lips"
superimposed on the photograph.
The ad further read. "You Get
Lots More From L&M, pure white
filter, pure white paper, pure
white smoke. This is L&M coun
try. Let's damn well keep it that
way."

The ASUC Senate scheduled an
emergency meeting to discuss the
issue, and reliable sources said
the president would call for sus
pension of the magazine.
The controversy was resolved,
however, before it could be
brought before the student legis
lature.
Other meetings were held by
the Vice-Chancellor of Student
Affairs with the editorial boards,
four Negro students, and the
Dean of Students. Neither the
Dean of Students nor the Vice-
Chancellor would comment on the
possibility of disciplinary mea
sures against the Pelican staff.
According to the Californian,
one of the Negroes said the ad
was "entirely enfuriating, to put
it mildly, insulting and distaste
ful." He continued, adding that
"what whites saw as satire, blacks
saw as racism.'
