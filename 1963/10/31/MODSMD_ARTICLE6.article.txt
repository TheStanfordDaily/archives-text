# Eitner Describes Romantic Artists
## 
### LINDA FREIDEL 
By studying nature in detail
with a highly sharpened, almost
scientifically objective eye to the
inner structure of changing form,
the artist of the romantic period
searched for the universal life
energy that would ultimately ex
plain himself.
Thus began Dr. Lorenz Eitner's
lecture last night on "Clouds,
Madmen and Self-Portraits: Real
ist Themes in Romantic Paint
ing." The particular strain of ro
manticism under scrutiny was
curiously enough realism. The
romantic artist was freed from
the conventions that had governed
perceptions in the centuries be
fore him, said Dr. Eitner, because
in his self-centered research only
what he personally observed, re
corded and evaluated had validity.
THE PARALLEL to scientific
discipline is not a coincidence, for
the early natural scientist of this
period was captured by a roman
tic purpose behind his work, and
the romantic artist augmented
his perceptual data with scientific
theory and analysis.
Thus Constable was intimately
concerned with the landscape of
clouds forming and reforming,
painting over fifty such studies
in one year, with the recently de
veloped science of meteorology
impressed upon his mind, guiding
his vision.
Clouds, an "accidental" pheno
mena to earlier generations, irra
tional and therefore open to
either imaginative fantasy or
stereotype, suddenly became the
subject for realistic representa
tion, the artist sensitive to every
cloud shape. The purpose of this
meticulous study was to paint the
unpaintable wind, world in proc
ess. life-force.
AN EQUALLY powerful in
stance of the fusion of science
and art was the collaboration of
Gericault with an early psychi
atrist. Gcrieault was commis
sioned to paint ten portraits of
the insane, another accident of
nature, so that his friend could
have a visual of the categories of
madness he was formulating.
From the portraits it is evident
that Gericault himself became
deeply involved in trying to un
derstand what was the agitation
under the surface of these people,
perhaps to understand himself,
yet the portraits remain unman
iacal in style. They seek the truth
with dignity, sensitive to the un
derlying flavor of his subjects.
Self-portrait was the final "re
alist" theme, and in that the ro
mantic painter succeeded no more
than an artist of any other period
in detaching himself from him
self. Nevertheless Ihe portraits
are remarkable in their straight
forward. intensely self-searching
attitude, unadorned in their pur
pose to record and understand,
not to display.

unpaintable wind, world in proc
ess. life-force.
AN EQUALLY powerful in
stance of the fusion of science
and art was the collaboration of
Gericault with an early psychi
atrist. Gcrieault was commis
sioned to paint ten portraits of
the insane, another accident of
nature, so that his friend could
have a visual of the categories of
madness he was formulating.
From the portraits it is evident
that Gericault himself became
deeply involved in trying to un
derstand what was the agitation
under the surface of these people,
perhaps to understand himself,
yet the portraits remain unman
iacal in style. They seek the truth
with dignity, sensitive to the un
derlying flavor of his subjects.
Self-portrait was the final "re
alist" theme, and in that the ro
mantic painter succeeded no more
than an artist of any other period
in detaching himself from him
self. Nevertheless Ihe portraits
are remarkable in their straight
forward. intensely self-searching
attitude, unadorned in their pur
pose to record and understand,
not to display.
By studying nature in detail
with a highly sharpened, almost
scientifically objective eye to the
inner structure of changing form,
the artist of the romantic period
searched for the universal life
energy that would ultimately ex
plain himself.
Thus began Dr. Lorenz Eitner's
lecture last night on "Clouds,
Madmen and Self-Portraits: Real
ist Themes in Romantic Paint
ing." The particular strain of ro
manticism under scrutiny was
curiously enough realism. The
romantic artist was freed from
the conventions that had governed
perceptions in the centuries be
fore him, said Dr. Eitner, because
in his self-centered research only
what he personally observed, re
corded and evaluated had validity.
THE PARALLEL to scientific
discipline is not a coincidence, for
the early natural scientist of this
period was captured by a roman
tic purpose behind his work, and
the romantic artist augmented
his perceptual data with scientific
theory and analysis.
Thus Constable was intimately
concerned with the landscape of
clouds forming and reforming,
painting over fifty such studies
in one year, with the recently de
veloped science of meteorology
impressed upon his mind, guiding
his vision.
Clouds, an "accidental" pheno
mena to earlier generations, irra
tional and therefore open to
either imaginative fantasy or
stereotype, suddenly became the
subject for realistic representa
tion, the artist sensitive to every
cloud shape. The purpose of this
