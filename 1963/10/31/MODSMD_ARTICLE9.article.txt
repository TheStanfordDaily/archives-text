# AFME's Overton:
## Understanding of Middle East Shakes Our Concept of World 
### JIM HAUSER 
The West's understanding of
the motives behind the actions of
the Middle Eastern countries is
"obviously shaking many of our
concepts of the world," stated Mr.
Edward W. Overton Jr. in a
speech yesterday at Tresidder.
Overton, vice president of the
American Friends of the Middle
East, suggested that a knowl
edge of four prevailing Middle
Eastern political ideas would help
the West to "look behind the
scenes" of recent political moves.
The four current ideas are: li
that there is no great difference
between the imperialism of the
East (USSR) and that of the
West. 21 that the West is trying
to regain its position as colonizer
by control of Middle Eastern re
sources. 31 that powerful central
government is necessary to
achieve the progress that these
nations desire, and -It that a capi
talistic economy "exploits" the
resources of the land hindering
equitable sharing of the nation's
wea It h.
OVKRTON STATKD that only
"from 1960 on" has there been
justification for the Middle East
ern countries to believe that "Rus
sian imperialism just might be
more readly than the West's."
He was optimistic about a
change in Middle Eastern atti
tudes toward Western influence
on their resources.
In spite of Western suspicion
of highly centralized govern
ments. Overton stressed that
"there is not a sovereign state in

the area which we in the West
would not tolerate today." He
said that much of the Middle
Eastern reserve toward capital
ism stemmed from poor educa
tional opportunities offered by
imperialistic Western powers dur
ing the crucial years after World
War I when the USSR was ex
ploiting eveiy weakness in the
West's system.
A "MAJOR EFFORT" is now
being made by the United States
both in the Middle East and in
South America to provide educa
tion to underdeveloped nations,
but "It will be a considerable
time before this program takes
effect."
Overton cited a lack of trained
personnel to put improvement
plans into operation as tiie big
gest problem facing the Middle
East today. He expressed hope
that with the coming of the prag
matism needed to put present
plans into effect, "private endea
vor will begin to come back and
take a bigger role."

East today. He expressed hope
that with the coming of the prag
matism needed to put present
plans into effect, "private endea
vor will begin to come back and
take a bigger role."
The West's understanding of
the motives behind the actions of
the Middle Eastern countries is
"obviously shaking many of our
concepts of the world," stated Mr.
Edward W. Overton Jr. in a
speech yesterday at Tresidder.
Overton, vice president of the
American Friends of the Middle
East, suggested that a knowl
edge of four prevailing Middle
Eastern political ideas would help
the West to "look behind the
scenes" of recent political moves.
The four current ideas are: li
that there is no great difference
between the imperialism of the
East (USSR) and that of the
West. 21 that the West is trying
to regain its position as colonizer
by control of Middle Eastern re
sources. 31 that powerful central
government is necessary to
achieve the progress that these
nations desire, and -It that a capi
talistic economy "exploits" the
resources of the land hindering
equitable sharing of the nation's
wea It h.
OVKRTON STATKD that only
"from 1960 on" has there been
justification for the Middle East
ern countries to believe that "Rus
sian imperialism just might be
more readly than the West's."
He was optimistic about a
change in Middle Eastern atti
tudes toward Western influence
on their resources.
In spite of Western suspicion
of highly centralized govern
ments. Overton stressed that
"there is not a sovereign state in

the area which we in the West
would not tolerate today." He
said that much of the Middle
Eastern reserve toward capital
ism stemmed from poor educa
tional opportunities offered by
imperialistic Western powers dur
ing the crucial years after World
War I when the USSR was ex
ploiting eveiy weakness in the
West's system.
A "MAJOR EFFORT" is now
being made by the United States
both in the Middle East and in
South America to provide educa
tion to underdeveloped nations,
but "It will be a considerable
time before this program takes
effect."
Overton cited a lack of trained
personnel to put improvement
plans into operation as tiie big
gest problem facing the Middle
East today. He expressed hope
that with the coming of the prag
matism needed to put present
plans into effect, "private endea
vor will begin to come back and
