Just listen to their Capitol album, "New Directions in Folk Music."
You'll hear (he rocking, driving way the Journeymen sing "Someday Baby"
a low down blues out of Chicago. The fun they have with "Stackolec!' the wild
song about a legendary terror of New Orleans. Their quiet and moving version
of "All the Pretty Little Horses" one of the most beautiful lullabies ever written.
Their spirited ragtime rendition of "San Francisco Bay."
Then you'll know what's new in folk songs. And what's best. )
