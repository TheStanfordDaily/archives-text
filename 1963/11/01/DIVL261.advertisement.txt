BIRTHMARKS OF SALVATION—OR, HOW TO KNOW
A CHRISTIAN WHEN YOU SEE ONE
Not everyone who professes Christian faith is spiritually born in Clod. Clod knows
who tin' true Christians arc. anil the Christian can know for sure in his own heart.
Changes always take place in a person's life when he becomes a Christian. Christians
arc different and do show birthmarks of regeneration.
"For if any man is in Christ he hccomes a new person altogether- the past is fin
ished and gone, everything has become fresh and new." II ("or. 5:17 I'll.
The Holy Spirit, indwelling the new Christian is fully able to transform the believer
into a new person. .\ person yielded to the Spirit exhibits a wonderful transformation
outwardly and experiences great inner peace and joy. The believer becomes clothed
in the righteousness of Christ, whereas before he had none at all. (see Horn. 3:10
and I John 2:29). The Christian is no longer ;t slave to sin but is free not to sin.
" The man who is really (iod's son does not practice sin. fur (toil's nature is in him.
and such a heredity is incapable of sin. Here we have a clear indication as to who
are the children of Cod and who are the children of the Devil. The man who does
not lead a good life is no son of (iod. nor is the man who fails to love his brother."
I John 3 :7-9.
The true Christian is filled with love. "Every man who truly loves is (iod's son
and has knowledge of him. Hut the man who does not love cannot know him, for
(lod is love." 1 John 4:7. K.
You will not find Christians off track as members of cults and "merely religious"
groups.
"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ proves himself one of God s family.
The man who lnves tin leather cannot help loving the Father's own Son .... For
the world is becoming full of imposters men who will not admit that Jesus Christ
really became man. Xow this is the very spirit of deceit and is antichrist." I John
5:1. II John 7.
Finally tin- Christian is one who is victorious in the end: "You, my children, who
belong to (iod have already defeated this spirit (of deceit) because the one who
lives in you is far stronger than the antichrist in the world. The agents of the anti
christ are children of the world: they speak the world's language and the world, of
course, pays attention to what they say." I John 4:4. "For who could ever be said
to compter the world, in the true sense, except the man who really believes that Jesus
is (iod's Son *" I John 5:4.
