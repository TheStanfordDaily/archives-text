If you can take your nose out of that text, book for just .a
moment, you'll notice that Yum-Yum has emerged as the most
stimulating campus sport in many a year. Who needs panty raids
when you can Yum-Yum under a large tree or in a little sports
car? Be advised, however, that on rainy days the
Mr hip prefer their Yum-Yum indoors. (Research
K rooms of libraries and empty field houses are eon
§| 1 sidered the choicest locations.)
As you've probably deduced by now, Yum-
Wpfe i| Yum is strictly for Him and Her. And in Columbia's
riotous new comedy "UNDER THE YUM-YUM
TREE", (Columbia Pictures, not Columbia University) Yum-Yum
is developed into a high art form by its greatest practitioner,
"Hogan."
Hogan, hilariously portrayed by Jack Lemmon, is a lecherous
landlord who rents apartments to attractive girls and goes from
door to door with a heart-shaped passkey. One of the tenants is
Carol Lvnley, a curvy co-ed who is conducting a cozy experiment
in platonic, pre-marital co-habitation. (It's all in the interests
of science.) Dean Jones is her nervous wreck of a fiance and Edie
Adams is on the premises as the marriage-counseling teacher who
takes a tumble for Hogan.
Hogan's own apartment, happily referred to as "The Sin
Bin," is an electronic ambush-on-virtue that could make etchings
obsolete. There's a violin section, for example, that emerges out
of nowhere and plays, without benefit of human hands, "Music To
Make Yum-Yum By." There's also a bar with
enough whiskey to refloat the Titanic. But don't j
get Hogan wrong. Jack Lemmon defines Hogan S
as "a man who is outraged at humanity. There- I üß*'
fore, everything that seems outlandish and bizarre
t<» the rest of the world, seems perfectly normal to wImSW
him. Ilogan cannot understand why the world is so ungrateful to
him."
We guarantee it's marvelous mayhem and sure-fire ma
terial for a term paper on Laughter. It may not earn you an "A"
—but what an 'education' when you see Jack Lemmon in Co
lumbia Picture's "UNDER THE YUM-YUM TREE," co-starring:
Carol Lynley • Dean Jones • Edie Adams • Imogene Coca • Paul
Lynd • Robert Lansing and The Yum-Yum Girls.

as "a man who is outraged at humanity. There- I üß*'

We guarantee it's marvelous mayhem and sure-fire ma

If you can take your nose out of that text, book for just .a
moment, you'll notice that Yum-Yum has emerged as the most
stimulating campus sport in many a year. Who needs panty raids
when you can Yum-Yum under a large tree or in a little sports
car? Be advised, however, that on rainy days the
Mr hip prefer their Yum-Yum indoors. (Research
K rooms of libraries and empty field houses are eon
§| 1 sidered the choicest locations.)
As you've probably deduced by now, Yum-
Wpfe i| Yum is strictly for Him and Her. And in Columbia's
riotous new comedy "UNDER THE YUM-YUM
TREE", (Columbia Pictures, not Columbia University) Yum-Yum
is developed into a high art form by its greatest practitioner,
"Hogan."
Hogan, hilariously portrayed by Jack Lemmon, is a lecherous
landlord who rents apartments to attractive girls and goes from
door to door with a heart-shaped passkey. One of the tenants is
Carol Lvnley, a curvy co-ed who is conducting a cozy experiment
in platonic, pre-marital co-habitation. (It's all in the interests
of science.) Dean Jones is her nervous wreck of a fiance and Edie
Adams is on the premises as the marriage-counseling teacher who
takes a tumble for Hogan.
Hogan's own apartment, happily referred to as "The Sin
Bin," is an electronic ambush-on-virtue that could make etchings
obsolete. There's a violin section, for example, that emerges out
of nowhere and plays, without benefit of human hands, "Music To
Make Yum-Yum By." There's also a bar with
