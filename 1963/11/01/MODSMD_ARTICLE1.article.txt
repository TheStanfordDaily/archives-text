## 
### ROD PECK 
Bradley Efron was elected Speaker of the Legislature of the
Associated Students at last night's meeting. Efron, a third-year
graduate student in Engineering and former Chapparal Editor, served
a short term as speaker last spring. The speaker moderates LASSU
meetings as its chairman. Prefacing the election, President Bud

YVedin cited the need fur the
speaker to involve all members
in the Legislature's activity as
well as calling on individual mem
bers to take a more active role
of their own accord.
Efron defeated Martin Gibson,
senior and former Student Police
Chief in a close vote (30-25).
CONCERNING an appropria
tion of $150 lo the Daily to defray
expenses incurred in communica
tion with Mississippi during t lie
current crisis, it was disclosed
that the President's Office had
indicated disapproval of what it
felt was involvement of Legisla
ture funds in out-of-state politics.
FOLLOWING MUCH discus
sion, a resolution was passed en
dorsing the Legislature's right to
appropriate funds to make pos
sible the continued reporting by
the Daily of activities of Stanford
students in Mississippi. It was
felt that by precedent it is a valid
and legitimate function of the

112
j Legislature to appropriate money
from the contingency fund to var
ious ASSU organizations to meet
emergency expenses that were
not planned for in the normal
budget.
Discussion pointed out that
i LASSU does not endorse any or
| ganizat ion's actions by appropri
| ating money to meet any special
expenses that become necessary.
THE LEGISLATURE then con
sidered a motion to appropriate
i the necessary funds to the Daily
but this was tabled until the
Board of Trustees of the Univer
sity rules on the matter. This
j should occur in about one month.
Ed Shaw, Student Financial
Manager, called for and secured
a resolution to the effect that
LASSU would accept responsibil
ity for future student charter
plane flights by creating an or
ganization that would serve as a
veritable clearinghouse for such
flights if the administration con
sents. This was prompted by last
spring's fiasco in New York
which found a large number of
California students stranded by
the unorthodox methods of a local
travel agent. The necessity to pro
tect students from such situations
was given as the rationale for
the formation of this organiza
tion.
ACADEMIC AFFAIRS Com
mittee Chairman Mark Lohman
reported an intensive study was
being planned of the General
Studies Program. Senior Collo
quia, and the attitudes of Stan
ford students toward learning.
He stated that much question had
arisen concerning these and that
possible revision of General Stud
ies and Colloquia would eventu
ally be in order. The committee
hoped to report by the beginning
of 1 he Winter Quarter.
During the President's report.
Wedin read a letter from Presi
dent J. E. Wallace Sterling in re
gard to LASSU's recent protest
of cutbacks in student representa
tion on university committees.
The letter stated that LASSU's
protest had been considered and
that more evaluation of the most
equitable commiltee sizes would
probably be done at the end of
the current academic year.
AS WAS ANNOUNCED, Wedin
appointed the chairman and vice
chairman of next year's Pre-Reg
Committee. Dick Ney will serve
as chairman and Carol Swanson
as Vice-Chairman.
