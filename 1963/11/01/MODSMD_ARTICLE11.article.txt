# Have We Perspective On Mississippi Acts?
## 
### 
Yes, when speaking of Mississippi there is always the
danger of losing perspective. This much-sought perspective
can be gained with ease. 1 lvpothesizc four out-of-state college
students pulling into Palo Alto and checking into the President
Hotel, proclaiming that they were going to attempt to aid
the Negroes in East Palo Alto through voter education, rallies
and pamphlets. Continue the hypothetical case by adding a
statement by the Chief of Police of Palo Alto saying that any
white agitators coming into East Palo Alto would bo jailed
for six months and fined $500. Finish with the students being
arrested in their hotel room and pulled into the police sta
tion.
The outcry from the Stanford students would be heard
across the nation. Every California official would state that
this does not happen in an American city. National headlines
and protest would assure that the incident would never hap
pen again. The case is ludicrous; "It Can't Happen Here," as
Sinclair Lewis would have it.
This type of action is so typical to Mississippi, however,
that one can become deadened to it. Someone is always be
ing arrested, beaten, or intimidated in that sovereign state.
The effect is much like that of gazing upon 10,000 tombstones
in a graveyard; sheer quantity removes the meaning of death.
However, driving past one fatal accident leaves an impres
sion upon one for days. It is this type of insensitivity, this
growing accustomed to the face of Mississippi hospitality
that has made the American press and public loose perspec
tive when dealing with Mississippi.
The interest of Stanford students in Mississippi has put
that state into focus for our campus. Our activities in that
realm do not exclude possible activity in onr own backyard
with East Palo Alto and migrant workers in California as a
start. We must not fear direction of attention to something
as broad as the Mississippi situation, however, on the logic
"Do nothing because we cannot do enough." That is the state
ment of the man who has lost perspective.
