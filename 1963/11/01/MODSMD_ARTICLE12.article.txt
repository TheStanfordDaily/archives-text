MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
Certainly everyone believing in
the principles of American democ
racy can be in sympathy with the
desire of Southern Negroes to ex
ercise their rightful franchise in
State and Federal elections. Per
haps the Mississippi mock elec
tion will be a step toward this
goal. Only history will provide
the answer.
The desire of many Stanford
students to participate in any
project of political importance
must be commended for impli
mentation of political beliefs can
best be done in the area of parti
san politics. College Young Re
publican organizations have long
attempted to further the philoso
phies of their members of politi
cal activism. Other groups, such
as the Civil Liberties Union, Stu
dent Peace Union, John Birch
Society, Young Democrats, a n d
Young Socialists each have their
programs of political action. Will
all groups be afforded an equal
opportunity to carry out their
respective programs on the cam
pus?
The Daily for the past two
days has given nearly three col
umns in each issue to a discussion
of the Mississippi situation. If
properly presented, this coverage
may be legitimately called news,
but the halting of academic lec
tures early to appeal for funds,
the permission to solicit donations
in dormitories and on campus
with ASSU identification, and the
use of Tresidder and the ASSU
offices for meetings and coordi
nation of the campaign are defi
nitely privileges granted to this
project.
Most Republicans are attempt
ing to achieve a reform in the
"Mississippi way of life" too, but
we are striving to accomplish our
goals by the creation of a genuine
two-party South. At present,
there is a strong campaign being
waged for Governor of Missis
sippi by Republican Rubel Phil
lips, who quit the Democratic
Party in disgust over the way
Barnett and his followers are
governing the state. Should the
Stanford Area Young Republi
cans wish to conduct a pro-Phil
lips campaign on the Stanford
campus, will we be afforded a
similar opportunity with similar
publicity and similar privileges?

Editor, The Daily:
In an article in Wednesday's
Daily the headline "We Will Win"
expressed perfectly the attitude
of those who have rushed unthink
ingly into the cause of the Mis
sissippi mock vote. To those
would-be do-gooders and politi
cians of the future, Mississippi is
just a stage on which they can
carry out their grand projects.
Any projects. "We will win." It
does not occur to these "ideal
ists that by "winning" the mock
vote they may hinder rather than
help the cause of Negro integra
tion. I am not condemning the
mock vote as harmful to integra
tion; I am saying that it might
h• rtnful, and I am condemning
hose who, ignoring its possible
' vi 1 effects, have rushed into the
project.
The only good the vote could do
would be to give Bobby Kennedy
evidence that Ross Barnett does

not represent the majority of the
citizens. But do you need evidence
to support a universally known
fact? Besides doing only a dubi
ous good, the vote may do definite
damage to the chances for Negro
integration. Segregation is ulti
mately a result of the way some
prejudiced whites feel about Ne
groes. Segregation will be truly
ended only when white prejudice
is ended. The mock vote will only
add to prejudice by antagonizing
the whites; there is no better way
to infuriate a person than by hav
ing self-righteous outsiders come
into his home and tell him how
to run it. The resulting increase
in white prejudice could not be
called an advance for Negro inte
gration. Furthermore, even if the
mock vote is completely worth
while, will white out of state stu
dents be of any real assistance?
7'he NAACP can recruit man
power to go door to door. Misssis
sippi Negroes will be more easily
persuaded to vote by a sym
pathetic Negro than by a nineteen
year old white from a California
rich kid school. Since they are
not needed, why did Stanford
students go? Perhaps they went
because they saw a chance to get
thrown in jail and "win" an edu
cational experience at the expense
of Mississippi.

Editor, The Daily:
Several recent writers to the
Daily have seemed to suggest a
criterion for singling out praise
worthy students from "ordinary"
students. The former are willing
to sacrifice their grade-point aver
age in order to further the Ne
groes' cause in Mississippi; the j
latter do not take part, supposedly
out of selfish concern for grades.
I should like to remind critics
that a conscientious student is not
ncessarily grade-oriented. He may i
work hard because he has a com
mendable goal in mind, which his
studying furthers. Perhaps it is;
as much a sacrifice for him to j
work day by day toward a not so 1
glorious end as it is for some!
others to drop immediate respon-1
sibilities and participate in an ex-1
citing cause.
Although it is an admirable 1
trait to be willing to help others '
on the spur of the moment, it is
also worthwhile for some people
to realize that a period of "selfish"
studying and preparation may
make them more useful citizens
later on.
I do have high regard for the
students working to help Negroes
in Mississippi. They are further
ing a cause which concerns us :
all. But so are diligent students
who stick to hard work and learn
well the skills they will need to \
be competent workers in their
profession. I salute these people
as well.
