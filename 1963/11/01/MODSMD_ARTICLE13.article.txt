WELFARE STATE?
Editor, The Daily:
The self proclaimed conserva
tive revival has had as one of
its war cries the encroachment of
the welfare state. I wonder if
the "conservatives on campus"
would be so adamant against gov
ernment handouts if they had
read Homer Bigart's article in
the October 22nd Western Edition
of the N.Y. Times.
The article was entitled "Ken
tucky's Miners Face a Grim Win- j
tor." I wish to reiterate a few of j
the salient points. "I've seen chil
dren eat dirt out of chimneys. Of
5.200 children in Letcher County
(Kentucky), 75 to 85 per cent are
underweight." Th is statement
was made by Dr. Collins, th e |
Letcher county health officer. A
Dr. Fox, health officer of Leslie
and Knott counties, estimated
that 75 per cent of the children
had intestinal parasites.
These are just two of the points
made by Mr. Bigart. The schools
in these areas are very poor. I
imagine the children have not
been enlightened by Senator Gold
water's harangues against the
welfare state. There is one sub
ject, however, of which the chil
dren are knowledgeable, hunger.

Editor, The Daily:
The opinions expressed by Mr.
P. J. DeWolf in his letter chal
lenging the "validity" of the Free
dom Ballot campaign in Missis
sippi are the sort that lead many
to suspect the intelligence and/or
motives of many young college
conservatives.
Obviously Mr. DeWolf does not
understand the purpose of th e
Freedom Ballot, for the condi
tions of "validity" he suggests
would be applicable only if the
Aaron Henry for Governor Com
mittee were considering filing
suit to have the results of the
Freedom Ballot counted in the
official Mississippi gubernatorial
race.
The Freedom Ballot is a peti
tion to be signed by Mississippi
Negroes who have been illegally
deprived of their constitutional
right to vote. Only Negroes
otherwise qualified to vote will
be allowed to sign. For whom they
might vote in an official election
is nobody's business: what mat
ters is the denial of this right.
I ask Mr. DeWolf to explain
what purpose was served by his
incredibly callous charge that the
three day run of the Freedom
Ballot represents "special privi
lege's" for the Negroes signing
it. The three day run is neces
sitated by the desperate repres
sive measures taken by the Mis
sissippi police to crush the Free
dom Ballot effort by intimidat
ing both workers and potential
signers.
Finally, I would like to ask Mr.
DeWolf why almost half the
qualified voters in Mississippi are
being illegally deprived of their
franchise in next week's vote for
governor. I am concerned that
the answer to the above point,
would invalidate the results of
the official Mississippi election.
