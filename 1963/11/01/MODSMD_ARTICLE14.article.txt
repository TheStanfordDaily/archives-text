ALABAMA REPLIES
Editor, Tlu» Daily:
I have just read of your efforts
to hold a mock election in Missis
sippi, with Aaron Henry as your
candidate for governor.
I am sure that you firmly be
lieve in your convictions, Miss
St relit/, but in my opinion, your
"cause" is just an effort to create
more discord and racial unrest in
Mississippi.
You are unwelcome in Missis
sippi, Alabama and any other
State where movements such as
yours seek to worsen an already
bad situation. We are well aware
of our problems and we do not

invito outside agitation. O u r
people are seeking a solution to
these problems, but there is no
magic formula for instant inte
gration.
I suggest that you channel your
endeavors into more worthwhile
causes. There are many families,
of all races, here in America to

day, who would be most grateful
for just a few dollars to buy food
and clothing. Why not seek them
out, Miss Strelitz, give them Ihe
money you are collecting for
political purposes, you will be
blessed for charitable acts.
