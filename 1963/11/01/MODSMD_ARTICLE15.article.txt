# LOCAL MOCK VOTE?
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The story in today's MERCURY
re your activities on behalf of the
voteless Negroes reminded us of
the days, early in 1957, when we
were agitating and propagandiz
ing on behalf of the voteless
Blancoes in Holy City. The hu
man, civil and PROPERTY rights
of some seven Blancoes WERE
recognized on July 22, 1957 —
but you would never know it
from reading the MERCURY.
The Spirit moves us to suggest
that those students who are not
making the pilgrimage to Jack
son might stage a mock election
in HOLY CITY Nov. 2, 3 and 4
with almost as much effectiveness
as the one in Jackson. Holy City,
for forty years and more, has
been the "deep South" of Santa
Clara County, in more ways than
the geographical, as the clip files

of the PALO ALTO TIMES will
reveal.
If all Negroes hereabouts can
be persuaded to make the pil
grimage to Holy City to vote in
the mock election for Mayor of
lioly City, the San Francisco
papers will eat it up. For that
matter, any Blancoes who are
"fellow-pilgrims" can add their
votes to those of the Negroes.
As to whom the pilgrims should
elect, we suggest (and nominate>
James Milton Wood, 58 (P.O. Box
3, Holy City), a Democrat from
way back < Milt worked for Uppy
Sinclair in the EPIC campaign of
1934, among others). Milt was
also the prime mover in the "di
rect action" of a pair of "trouble
makers and goofy guys" (SAN
JOSE MERCURY, Jan. 20. 1957)
who insisted that ALL the Holy
Citizens had the light — and the
responsibility — to determine
what would be done with THEIR
Holy City.
So have a small local ball.

Editor, The Daily:
When I read Holly Chenery's
letter to the editor in Friday's
daily, I was disheartened by the
naive logic throughout.
Several important considera
tions seem to have been over
looked. For one thing, the free
dom of education which Holly
thinks so highly of is, in large
part, safe-guarded by our armed
forces. Since the military aca
demies cannot provide the num
ber of trained officers that our
present needs require, the col
leges and universities are an im
portant source of such men. In
fulfilling the needs of our armed
forces, colleges and universities
do their part in keeping our coun
try and freedom safe. This free
dom of education also permits
students to study what they wish
without being forced to cater to
the whims of minority groups
that would foist their values on
all students.
As for the comment about the
university not giving courses in
"how to crack a safe or use a
black-jack," do you really think
that these fit into the same cate
gory as the ROTC? It is unfor
tunate that you feel that the lives
of Stanford students are being
encroached upon or that all our
armed forces do is to prepare for
mass murder: however, perhaps
you should consider the lot of
students in some other countries.
You must realize that in some
countries you would not have
been able to write or publish that
article. Would you call that free
dom? And finally Holly, would
you like to feel yourself in part
responsible for the consequences
of our country's not being mili
tarily prepared in the future?

The story in today's MERCURY
re your activities on behalf of the
voteless Negroes reminded us of
the days, early in 1957, when we
were agitating and propagandiz
ing on behalf of the voteless
Blancoes in Holy City. The hu
man, civil and PROPERTY rights
of some seven Blancoes WERE
recognized on July 22, 1957 —
but you would never know it
from reading the MERCURY.
The Spirit moves us to suggest
that those students who are not
making the pilgrimage to Jack
son might stage a mock election
in HOLY CITY Nov. 2, 3 and 4
with almost as much effectiveness
as the one in Jackson. Holy City,
for forty years and more, has
been the "deep South" of Santa
Clara County, in more ways than
the geographical, as the clip files

of the PALO ALTO TIMES will
reveal.
If all Negroes hereabouts can
be persuaded to make the pil
grimage to Holy City to vote in
the mock election for Mayor of
lioly City, the San Francisco
papers will eat it up. For that
matter, any Blancoes who are
"fellow-pilgrims" can add their
votes to those of the Negroes.
As to whom the pilgrims should
elect, we suggest (and nominate>
James Milton Wood, 58 (P.O. Box
3, Holy City), a Democrat from
way back < Milt worked for Uppy
Sinclair in the EPIC campaign of
1934, among others). Milt was
also the prime mover in the "di
rect action" of a pair of "trouble
makers and goofy guys" (SAN
JOSE MERCURY, Jan. 20. 1957)
who insisted that ALL the Holy
Citizens had the light — and the
responsibility — to determine
what would be done with THEIR
Holy City.
So have a small local ball.

When I read Holly Chenery's
letter to the editor in Friday's
daily, I was disheartened by the
naive logic throughout.
Several important considera
tions seem to have been over
looked. For one thing, the free
dom of education which Holly
thinks so highly of is, in large
part, safe-guarded by our armed
forces. Since the military aca
demies cannot provide the num
ber of trained officers that our
present needs require, the col
leges and universities are an im
portant source of such men. In
fulfilling the needs of our armed
forces, colleges and universities
do their part in keeping our coun
try and freedom safe. This free
dom of education also permits
students to study what they wish
without being forced to cater to
the whims of minority groups
that would foist their values on
all students.
As for the comment about the
university not giving courses in
"how to crack a safe or use a
black-jack," do you really think
that these fit into the same cate
gory as the ROTC? It is unfor
