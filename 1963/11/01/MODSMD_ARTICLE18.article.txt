# Junior Rooters Show Spirit, Learn Good Sportsmanship

### HOPE SELBY 
"Score. Big Red, let's score!"
Over a thousand of them
screamed from the bleachers.
Some waved Stanford pennants,
some argued about the strategy
of the team, and some just sat
in the stands eating hot dogs and
drinking bottles of pop.
THIS WAS the Stanford junior
rooter section at the Notre Dame
game last Saturday. You'll see
them at home gamesâ€”the kids
from the Palo Alto area elemen
tary schools who make up th e
Stanford Junior Indian Rooters
club.
Some come on their bikes.
Others walk. Others come with
their parents. But you can be sure
that most of ihe 1,046 fourth,
fifth, and sixth graders registered
in the club this year will bo there.
Their section at the games is
led by Sherman Thurston, pro
gram secretary of the Palo Alto
YMCA. If the yells aren't loud
enough, you might hear him over
the microphone saying, "I bet
only one junior rooter out of five
is yelling!" And when he's not
leading the kids in Stanford songs
and yell's, he's explaining th e
plays.
ALTHOUGH this is only Thur
ston's second year as head of the
section, the YMCA has been run
ning the program for nine years.
Before that it was sponsored by
Ihe University, but the student
police were too busy to provide
much supervision for the kids.
Now there is a regular team of
supervisors who register them
and see to it that they obey the
club's rules at the games. They
are all adults from the Palo Alto
Area, and are paid for their serv
ices by free admission to the
games.
The rules the club has set up
for the kids at the games include:
coming early to the games, re
membering to bring their mem
bership cards, being courteous to
the supervisors, and not fighting
in the stands, throwing things, or
booing the team. In the words of
Thurston, these rules "teach the
kids the important things about
spectator sports." This, says
Thurston, is often difficult be
cause of the poor sportsmanship
shown by adults who often leave
before the game is over if the
team is losing.
And what do the kids think?
For the most part, they like it.
It's not only fun, it's also cheap.
For a fifty cent membership fee
paid at the start of the season,
they can attend all home games.
And Stanford games, as one kid
put it, "can be prety darn excit
ing to watch." Most of the
younger ones obey the rules.
BUT SOME of the older kids
are a bit more cynical about the
whole operation. When asked
what he thought about the cheers

used in the section, one young- j
ster flatly stated, "They stink."
The Stanford ones are a lot bet- j
tor than ihose the junior rooters
have. And we understand them,
too. I mean, the younger genera
tion is a lot smarter these days,
and knows what's coming off."
For this group, the ihrill of the
game is going down to the field
(illegally ) after the game and get
ting the chin strap of one of the
players. Chin straps are prized
possessions, to be kept as souve
nirs or sold to those less lucky.
But if Stanford loses, as one root
er remarked, you aren't likely to :
get a strap.
But obey the rules or not, it's
still pretty exciting. Perhaps the
glamor of it all is best summed
up by the nine-year-old girl who
said that the lime she was glad
dest she was a junior rooter was
when "number fifty-three bumped
into me on the way home."
