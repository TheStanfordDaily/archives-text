CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (UPI)
Wild sex parties at Harvard Uni
versity, the nation's oldest col
lege, were disclosed Thursday by
Harvard officials.
College Dean John U. Monro
said visits by coeds and other
women to Harvard dormitories
"has come to be a license to use
the college rooms for wild parties
and sexual intercourse."
Under college rules. Harvard
men may entertain women in
their rooms from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.
Monday through Friday and from
noon to midnight on Saturday.
MONRO'S DISCLOSURE of the
parties by "a few" of the univer
sity's 13.700 students were made
in the Crimson, Harvard un d e r
graduate daily newspaper. Hi s
remarks were confirmed as au
thentic by a college spokesman.
Monro said he and Dean of Stu
dents Robert Waston "have been
badly shaken up recently by some
severe violations of our rules and
recent standards of behavior and
the feeling that the college itself
seemed to be contributing to an
atmosphere of 'don't care.' "
A series of meetings between
students and officials were held
recently but failed to resolve a
disagreement over changes in
house rules.
