HOW SMALL CAN YOU GET?
Foday let us address ourselves to a question that has long rocked
and roiled the academic world: Is a student better off at a small
college than at a largo college?
To iutswer this question it is necessary first to define terms.
hat, exactly, do we meaii by a small college? Well sir, some
say that in order to lie called truly small, a college should have
an enrollment of not more than lour students.
1 surely have no quarrel with this statement; a four-student
college must unequivocally be called small. Indeed, I would
even call it inlimi il I knew what intime meant. But I submit
there is such a thing :ts being too small. Take, for instance, a
recent unfortunate event at Crimscott A and M.
Crimscott A and M, situated in a pleasant valley nestled
between Philadelphia and Salt Lake City, was founded by

A. and M. Crimscott, two brothers who loft Ireland in lf>2s
to escape the potato famine of IS4I. As a result of their fore
sight, the Crimscott brothers never went without potatoes for
one single day of their lives—and mighty grateful they were!
One night, full of gratitude after a wholesome meal of French
fries, cottage fries, hash browns, and uu gratin, they decided
to show their appreciation to this bountiful land of potatoes
by endowing a college. But their generosity contained one
.stipulation: the enrollment of the college must never exceed
four students. They felt that only by keeping the school this
small could each student be assured of the personalized atten
tion, the camaraderie, the esprit, that is all too often lacking in
larger institutions of higher learning.
Well sir, things went along swimmingly until one Saturday
a few years ago. On this day Crimscott had a football game
scheduled against Minnesota, its traditional rival. Football,
as you can well imagine, was something of a problem at Crim
scott, what with only four undergraduates in the entire college.
It was easy enough to muster a baekfield, but to find a good
line—or even a bad line—baffled some of the most resourceful
coaching minds in the nation.
Well on the morning of the big game against Minnesota,
its traditional rival, a capricious fate dealt Crimscott a cruel
blow - in fact, four cruel blows. Sigafoos, the quarterback,
woke up that morning with an impacted incisor. Wrichards,
the slot hack, flunked his taxidermy exam and was declared in
eligible. lieerbohm-Tree, the wingback-tailback, got his neck
tie caught in his espresso machine. Yuld, the fullback, was
stolen by gypsies.
Consequently, none of the Crimscott team showed up at the
football game, and Minnesota, its traditional rival, was able to
score almost at will. ('rimscott was so cross after this humiliating
defeat that, they immediately broke off football relations with
Minnesota, its tradtional rival. This later became known :is
the Sacco-Vanzetti Case.
So you can see how only four students might be too meagre
an enrollment. The number that I personally favor i- twent.v.
Why? you ask. Because, I reply, when you have twenty
students and one of them opens a pack of Marlboro ("igarettt
there are enough to go around for everybody, and no one has
to be deprived of Marlboro's flavor, of Marlboro's filter, of
Marlboro's staunch and steadfast companionship, and a- a
result you have a student body that is brimming with sweet
content and amity and harmony and concord and togcfhcmc<«
and soft pack and Flip-Top box.
