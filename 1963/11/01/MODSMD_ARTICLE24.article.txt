# Tough Oregon State Beavers Confront Cards in Corvallis
## 
### TOM ELIAS 
A healthy Stanford football
team takes off from San Fran
cisco Airport this morning en
route to a rendezvous tomorrow
noon at 1:30 in Corvallis with the
tough Oregon State Beavers.
Although Stanford halfback
Dick Ragsdale had been betlried
down with the flu most of the
week, he returned to practice yes
terday. His availability, together
with that of fullback Ken Baba
jian, out for the past two weeks,
means that Stanford's backfield

is healthier than at any time
since the opener with San Jose.
IN TOMORROW'S contest, the
Indian line, also in good physical
shape, will outweigh its opponents
an average of ten pounds per
man.
But this was the case last year
also, anrl Tommy Prothro's hard
charging forwards got off the
mark quickly and strongly enough
to give the Beavers a 27 to 0 vic
tory. their tenth in 32 tries against
Stanford.
In the backfield the swifl
Orange and Black are outweighed
by 20 pounds per man, but their
greater speed could well make up
for the edge the Tribe will have
in power running.
LEADING RUSHER for the
Beavers is 169-pound junior speed
ster Dan Espalin,
The runs of Espalin, his side
kick Tim Osmer, a 177-pound
soph from San Jose, and fullback
Booker Washington, at 181 an
other speedster, will serve to keep
the Stanford defense loose for
the air game spearheaded by

quarterback Gordon Queen and
All-American end V e r n Burke,
holder ol' two NCAA pass receiv
ing records.
Stanford, according to publicist !
Glenn Alford, has not concen
trated greatly on pass defense |
this week, since "We've already
seen some of the besl in I lie coun
try and if we haven't learned pass
defense yet. working on it won't
help 100 much."
Instead, the Indians have been j
practicing goal line offense. In i
Wednesday's practice, the Red!
first team managed to run the 1
ball over from the five yard line
on the first iry eight out of ten
times. This emphasis on close in 1
offense is designer! to prevenl
failures like last week's fumble
on the two yard line in ihe wan
ing moments of the first half.
