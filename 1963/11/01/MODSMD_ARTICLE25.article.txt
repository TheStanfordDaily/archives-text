# Frosh Engage Cal In Season Finale
## 
### PETE EAKLAND 
"The Little Big Game" at Berk
eley tomorrow between the frosh
squads of Stanford and Cal is a
tossup affair and will pit the
Cards' balanced offense and prov
en defense against the Cubs'
heavy line and conservative off
ense of Karl Dawkins' occasional
passes and the straight-ahead
talents of fullback Bomber Gen
etti.
Coach Bill Walsh thinks his
players will be up for the game.
"The team is high and spirited
for the game and is anticipating
a win."
The offense, held scoreless by
UCLA, has been gaining in con
sistency during the week. John
Propstra, the nervousness of his
first starting assignment behind
him. has been improving. Half
backs Bob Oar and Bob Blunt,
little used last week, will be called
upon to supplement the standout
rushing of Bill Ostrander and
John Heed.
Injured quarterbacks Dave
Lewis and Hick Bianchina have
taken light workouts this week
and may be ready to play.
The seasonal records of Stan
ford and Cal are strikingly simi
lar. Each has played three games
and won two. Both accounted for
one of their victories with one
touchdown squeakers over t h e
SC Trojans.
Cal has also bombasted Fresno
State and tied San Jose's Frosh.
Walsh rates Cal strong up the
middle but gives Stanford, with
speedsters Oar and Blunt, an edge
at halfback. Although Cal's line
is heavier, Walsh considers I h e
Tribe line its equal.
As for Stanford's season, it
bludgeoned Santa Clara in its
opener, followed with a good win
over a touted USC squad, then
floundered offensively against
UCLA and lost, 12-0.
A victory would insure the Pa
pooses of a winning season, end
the season on a bright note by
defeating t heir archrival and give
Coach Walsh not only a fine rec
ord in his first year but also a
victory over the school where he
last coached.
