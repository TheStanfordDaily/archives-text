# Kerr Excited by 'Hamlet' Role
## 
### MICHAEL ADDISON 
"There could be no better place
to perform Hamlet for the first
lime." This is the declaration of
John Kerr, stage and motion pic
ture actor, who is preparing to
play the Prince of Denmark in
the forthcoming Stanford Play
ers production of "Hamlet" on
the 6th, 71 h. <Sth, and 91 h of No
vember in Memorial Auditorium.
When asked why he felt this
about his Visiting Artist perform
ance. Kerr gave two reasons.
"First and foremost," he replied,
"it's a great relief not to have
any pressure to deliver to a group

of financial backers who know
nothing about the theatre. And
then this is an intelligent com
munity. and thus we can expect
to play to an intelligent audience."
KEKIt SPEAKS from long ex
perience in virtually all the me
diums available to a contempor
ary actor. Currently featured as
John Pine in the ABC-TV series
"Arrest and Trial," Kerr began
acting while an undergraduate at
Harvard by working in summer
stock.
His Broadway debut was made
in the 1952 production of "Ber
nardine," with his first starring
role the following season in the
role of Tom Lee in "Tea and Sym
pathy." Since then Kerr has ap
peared in Broadway productions
of "All Summer Long," "The In
fernal Machine." and "Cue for
Passion." And within the past
few years he has appeared in
West coast productions of "Anti
gone, "The Rainmaker," an d
"Five Finger Exercise," and has
directed "Bus Stop." "The Sound
of Murder," and "See the Jaquar."
Apart from legitimate theatre,
he has performed in both motion
pictures and on television. After
recreating the role of Tom Lee
for the film of "Tea and Sym
pathy," Kerr played Lieutenant
Cable in Hip film of "South Pa
cific," and has since been featured
in such films as "Girl of the
Night" with Loyd Nolan and
"The Ci'owded Sky" with Rhonda
Fleming.
On television he has performed
in virtually all the live TV drama
tic programs, including "Play
house 90" and "Studio One." and
has made guest appearances in
such series as "Wagon Train."
"U.S. Steel Hour," and"The De
fenders."

The legitimate stage is still
John Kerr's first love, and of his
current work in "Arrest and
Trial" he says."I have a family
to support and took this role as
an economic necessity. But," he
adds, "this is hardly where the
future of the theatre lies. Groups
such as the Actor's Workshop in
San Francisco are the represen
tatives of the new wave. This is
what I want to become involved
with."
AS FOR HAMLET with the
Stanford Players, Kerr has a def
inite goal. "What I am attempt
ing to do is to present the com
plete Hamlet, not just a melan
choly Dane. To me Hamlet seems
to be a vital and in many ways
modern young man, and certainly
not a figure who may be best
understood from the printed
page. This play demands that it
be put on the stage it's brim
ming over with life."
And for Kerr this is the most
exciting aspect of performing
Hamlet. "The chief weakness of
the contemporary theatre is that
it is too much of an entertain
ment," he says. "We lack plays
of the stature of "Hamlet" be
cause we are unwilling or unable
to follow Shakespeare's advice to
hold a mirror up to nature."
The Stanford Players produc
tion of "Hamlet" will be directed
by Dr. Norman Philbriek, with
costumes and settings by Douglas
Russell and Holmes Easley, all
of the Stanford Drama faculty.
Four evening performances will
be presented at 8:30 p.m. on the
nights of November oth. 7th, Sth,
and 9th. with a 2:00 p.m. matinee
on the afternoon <>112 the 9th.
Tickets for all performances are
available at the Tresidder Box


JOHN KERR, distinguished stage and motion picture actor, will play
the title role in Hamlet.' The play will be presented in Memorial
Auditorium Novembei 6 to 9.
