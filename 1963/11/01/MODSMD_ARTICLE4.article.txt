"Religion and Racism" us to be I
i ho theme of a national Student !
Leadership Conference to be held
in Washington, D.C., from Nov.
IT lo Nov. 20. under the sponsor
ship of the B'nai B'rith Hillel
Foundations, the National New- ;
man Club Federation, and the Na-'
tional Student Christian Federa
tion.
The conference will consist of
250 delegates from approximately
60 universities. Selection of these
universities was made, according
to Rabbi Oscar Grover, Assistant
Director of the Conference, on j
the basis of "geographic location,
racial and religious tension or I
the need for ameliorative action
in either the campus community ;
of nearby communities, the need
to arouse interest, and. in many
instances, to share positive ex 1
periences which have been under
taken by many campus groups." j
STUDMNTS are called lo this I
conference by a statement of con-'
science. "Racism is a grave threat I
to the basic foundations of o u r !
faith in the One Living God . . . i
To deprive any citizen unjustly of ,
his 'inalianable rights' is to deny I
Him who alone is the source of!
these fights." The statement goes!
on to point up the emphasis of ;
the conference, i.e., the position
and obligation of the university j
in the community and American
society in general. "While the!
university has as its purpose the

deeper transformation of the char
acter of those in its charge and
the truthful pursuit of learning,
we recognize sadly, that as long
as the university remains aloof
from the struggle for injustice,
this transformation and this pur
suit cannot be effected."
