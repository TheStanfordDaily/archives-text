Three major incidents of vio
lence have accurred against Yale
students since the last reports to
the Daily. Yale graduate student
Bruce Payne, who received his
CA from Berkeley, was beaten by
four white men in a gas station
yesterday. In Nachez. Mississippi
yesterday afternoon he drove to
the Negro section to pick up a
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference worker who was to
address a rally in a town 45 min
ntcs away. He was followed by
two cars, who joined with a police
car in cruising in front of the
house when he stopped to pick
up the speaker. The two private
cars followed them until they
stopped at a gas station to ask
directions.
AT THE GAS STATION, ac
cording to Payne, "Two white
men got out of each car. T hoy
began beating me. hitting my
head against the gas pumps,
kicking me for about ten minutes
as the station attendants stood
around.
"They told me I better get out
out of Adams County or I would

got worse. The gas station owner
came up while they were beat
ing me; they motioned him and
pushed a dollar toward him. He
did not take the money, but
backed off. I got the numbers of
their license plates, and the high
way patrol said they would in
vestigate. Telegrams have been
sent off to Bobby Kennedy a n d
to the FBI."
Payne was speaking from Jack
son. He continued, "I am return
ing to Nachez in the morning with
omre people. I want to show
them they can't run us out; we
are going to keep working. There
is much work to do there. Things
are going well with the Negro
community, but they are fright
ened. They are glad to see us;
they are excited by us.
"I AM SURE in my own mind
that the police put the men up
to the beating. The police kept
bringing the name of Emmet Till
into the conversation yesterday;
he was the Negro lynched a few
years ago. They said they couldn't
provide protection."
According to Payne, the chief
of police at Nachez said to him
on Wednesday, "They'll tear your
head off out there. My men have
guns and I've told them what to
do with them. If one rock is
thrown, there will be some slow
walking and some sad singing."
Yale student Frank Heintz was
reportedly assaulted by Clarks
dale City Police Chief Ben Col
lins yesterday. Heintz was jailed
there earlier this week on charges
of reckles driving while report
edly going at 15 to 20 miles per
hour. The Daily was told that
the Chief hit him in the face and
broke his glasses. He was sched
uled to go to trial yesterday.
JOEL LIEBERMAN, chairman
of the Yale Daily News reported
from Jackson yesterday that Yale
students Peter Andrews and Ken
neth Klotz were arrested on as
sault and battery charges Wed
nesday evening in Hattiesburg.
They tried to get a Negro cab to
take them from the downtown
area to the Negro residential area,
but were refused by the driver
when he saw a police car nearby,
according to Lieberman. He said
that they then went across the
street to the dispatch office of a
white taxi company. A cab drove
up with a front seat passenger
who reportedly identified himself
as "Buck Anderson." According to
the Yale editor, Anderson called
the students "meddlers," and an
nounced that he "wasn't going to
ride in any cab with Yale students
to Mobile Street."
Lieberman reported that An
derson told them to get out of
the cab, and face a wall. He then
began swinging at them, they pro

tected their faces and didn't
strike back. Lieberman went on
to note that two white by stand
ees a 16-year-old boy and a
middle-aged man said they would
testify on the students' behalf.
The boy was picked up on a loi
tering charge shortly thereafter.
TIIE YALE STUDENTS were
taken to the police station a n d

Lieberman stated. They were re
leased on $25 bond, and left town
thereby forfeiting bond - yes

but he accepted an offer from
police to drop the charge if he
left town with a police escort
within ten minutes. The English
