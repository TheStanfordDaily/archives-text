# Thurber Reviews Practical Politics
## 
### 
James Thurber, Jr., Mayor of
Los Altos and Assistant to the
Vice-President and Provost at
Stanford University, spoke in the
Tresidder Lounge yesterday on
the practical difficulties facing a
Democratic candidate in a "safely
Republic district."
Thurber ran for the U.S. House
of Representatives on the Demo
cratic ticket in the 10th Califor
nia district during the fall of
1962. The talk sponsored by the
Stanford Young Democrats, in co
operation with the Political Union.
IN AN I N T H () DEC T <) R V
speech, Bob Ronka, President of
the Stanford YD's, said that the
County Central Committee had
approved the constitution of the
newly-formed organization, "mak
ing us an officially bona fide, al
though independent, Democratic
club." Ronka also announced the
names of the newly-selected com
mittee chairmen: Chris Burns,
Campaign; Pete Hanson, Mem
bership; Gary Parker, Program;
Pete Firestein, Publicity; Howard
Garfield. Resolutions; and Fran
cis Rotenberg, Social.
Thurber stressed that the prim
ary concern of the candidate
should be to get his name before
the public, and noted that the in
cumbent has a tremendous ad
vantage in this respect. Personal
contact is the principal means of
influencing voters and can be de
veloped into a fine art through
experience. Thurber stated his
belief that a Democrat could un
seat a Republican with adequate
funds and imaginative ideas, if
the Democratic contender was
well known by the people in his
district.
