# Tribe Loses to Beavers On Second-Half Miscues
## 
### TOM ELIAS 
Corvallis, Ore. There is a sign posted in Coach Tommy Pro
thro's Oregon State football dressing room which reads "The team
that makes the fewest mistakes wins."
This seemed especially appropriate Saturday afternoon in the
aftermath of Stanford's good-but-not-good-enough effort against

Prothro's Beavers. Time and-*
again, particularly in the third
quarter, the Indians seemed on
their way to a score which would
have meant I lie load and most
likely a victory.
BUT KAMI time they got ai
drive under way, something hap
pened. First, quarterback Dick
Berg fumbled on the OSU 39. ;
Moments later, after the stalwart
Stanford defense had forced a j
Beaver punt and the Indians had j
driven down to the State 35, a i
Steve Thurlow aerial went astray,'
being picked off by Beaver Dick j
Ruhl.
Two minutes later, with the ball 1
again deep in Oregon State terri
tory at. the 33, a Dick Ragsdale I
fumble was fallen on by a Beaver.'
This time the Orange and Black
fumbled it right back to Stanford, j
and now it was Berg's turn again, j
He lost the ball to Beaver Joe;
Bonilla on the State 28 on a sec-'
ond down and eight play which I
marked the end of the third quar- I
tor, and the last real Stanford
threat.
The second time Oregon State
got its hands on the ball, it drove I
82 yards to the Stanford 4 before
being stalled. Steve Clark then
kicked the field goal which was to
provide the eventual margin of j
victory from 21 yards out.
STANFORD COULD not move
the ball after the ensuing kickoff. i
and an exchange of punts re
sulted. Craig Ritehey took the
next Oregon Stale punt on his'
own 33, and danced and weaved
his way for a 67-yard touchdown •
and Stanford's only k'ore of the ,
day. Braden Beck converted and j
the score was 7 to 3 at the quar-!
ter.
Beck booted the next kickoff to j
Beaver Leroy Whittle on the State j
11. and the speedster from Berk-1
eley returned it 38 yards to the,
49.
TAKING POSSESSION again
after an exchange of punts, this
time on their own 36, Oregon
State covered the 64 yards to pay i
dirt in 11 plays, getting help from j
the officials on a piling on rap
which moved the ball from the !
2*l to the Stanford nine yard line.
Three line smashes by fullback i
Booker Washington and Whittle
put the ball on the 2-yard line
with fourth down and goal to go.
Here quarterback Gordon Queen
crossed up the defense by flip
ping a short pass to end Len Frke
tich in the end zone. Steve Clark
converted to close the day's scor
ing.
Oregon State managed only one
more threat during the ball game,
advancing to the Stanford one
with four seconds left in the first
half on a Queen to Whittle toss.
But the Tribe held on the one
play the Beavers were able to try,
and the halftime score remained
10 to 7, also the final margin.
STANFORD'S LONE scoring
opportunity in the fourth quarter
came after end Frank Patitucci
recovered an Oregon State fumble
on the Beavers 28 on the first
play of the period, as both teams
continued to suffer from fumbli
tis.

Unable to move the ball past
the 2H, Stanford went with a field
goal attempt by Braden Beck
from 43 yards out. It had th e
distance, but was off the mark to
the left and State took over on
its 20.
Stanford made one last su
preme effort in the waning mo
ments of the game, when a Thur
low to Dick Ragsdalc pass cover
ing 40 yards to the Beaver 35 was
ruled out of bounds on a contro
versial call.

Corvallis, Ore. There is a sign posted in Coach Tommy Pro
thro's Oregon State football dressing room which reads "The team
that makes the fewest mistakes wins."
This seemed especially appropriate Saturday afternoon in the
aftermath of Stanford's good-but-not-good-enough effort against

Prothro's Beavers. Time and-*
again, particularly in the third
quarter, the Indians seemed on
their way to a score which would
have meant I lie load and most
likely a victory.
BUT KAMI time they got ai
drive under way, something hap
pened. First, quarterback Dick
Berg fumbled on the OSU 39. ;
Moments later, after the stalwart
Stanford defense had forced a j
Beaver punt and the Indians had j
driven down to the State 35, a i
Steve Thurlow aerial went astray,'
being picked off by Beaver Dick j
Ruhl.
Two minutes later, with the ball 1
again deep in Oregon State terri
tory at. the 33, a Dick Ragsdale I
fumble was fallen on by a Beaver.'
This time the Orange and Black
fumbled it right back to Stanford, j
and now it was Berg's turn again, j
He lost the ball to Beaver Joe;
Bonilla on the State 28 on a sec-'
ond down and eight play which I
marked the end of the third quar- I
tor, and the last real Stanford
threat.
The second time Oregon State
got its hands on the ball, it drove I
82 yards to the Stanford 4 before
being stalled. Steve Clark then
kicked the field goal which was to
provide the eventual margin of j
victory from 21 yards out.
STANFORD COULD not move
the ball after the ensuing kickoff. i
and an exchange of punts re
sulted. Craig Ritehey took the
next Oregon Stale punt on his'
own 33, and danced and weaved
his way for a 67-yard touchdown •
and Stanford's only k'ore of the ,
day. Braden Beck converted and j
the score was 7 to 3 at the quar-!
ter.
Beck booted the next kickoff to j
Beaver Leroy Whittle on the State j
11. and the speedster from Berk-1
eley returned it 38 yards to the,
49.
TAKING POSSESSION again
after an exchange of punts, this
time on their own 36, Oregon
State covered the 64 yards to pay i
dirt in 11 plays, getting help from j
the officials on a piling on rap
which moved the ball from the !
2*l to the Stanford nine yard line.
Three line smashes by fullback i
Booker Washington and Whittle
put the ball on the 2-yard line
with fourth down and goal to go.
Here quarterback Gordon Queen
crossed up the defense by flip
