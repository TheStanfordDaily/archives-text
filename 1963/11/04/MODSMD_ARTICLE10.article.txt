# TWA Group Flights Now Being Formed
## 
### 
Trans World Airlines ITWAI
announced today that it will use
the date of admittance rather
than registration in determining
who is eligible for money-saving
group flights this Christmas.
The rule is that a person must
be a member of an organization
at least six months before he is
eligible for a group flight.
This interpretation thus makes
freshmen, transfer students, and
graduate students eligible for
group flights this Christmas as
long as they were admitted by
Stanford on. or before, June 12,
1963.
The Daily business office has
a list of the group flights now
being formed. They are going to
New York, Chicago, Kansas City,
and Washington, D.C. Anyone
wishing to organize a group t<> a
different location may do so. but
all groups must be organized by
November 12 to qualify.
The business office will be
happy to list your group or direct
you to one being formed.
