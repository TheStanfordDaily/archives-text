# Justice Dept. Unable to Help Vote Workers
## 
### 
In an exclusive inter vi e w
granted Robert Suffel of KZSU
Radio News, Buske Marshall,
Assistant Attorney General for
Civil Rights, said that there was
no way in which the Justice De
partment could help the student
workers in the Aaron Henry for
Governor Camp a i g n except
through the courts.
Suffel, referring to the Bruce
Payne beating in Natchez, asked
if the Justicce Department could
prevent such actions. Marshall re
plied that he had not heard of the
beating but that the Justice De
partment has several lawyers and
FBI men in Mississippi who are
trying to keep abreast of all
events taking place. Marshall re
minded, however, that they can
not prevent a crime in advance.
He also stated Federal law does
not give authority for action in
cases involving only private citi
zens.
Marshall indicated that the gov
ernment of Mississippi is not re
sponsive to the needs of the Ne
groes. "They have accepted this
for a long time, but are tiring
of it."
Suffel mentioned the Hat ties
burg case where the Chief of
Police had declared that he would
put any "outside agitators" in
jail for six months with fines of
$500 for entering the city. He
asked if there was anything the
Justice Department could do to
make it unnecessary for the stu
dents to spend up to two years
commuting to Mississippi to ap
peal their cases. Marshall re
peated that the department is
unable to represent private citi
zens. However, hi s personal
opinion was that everyone should
fight any false charges brought
against him. He mentioned that
there were many interested law
yers who would help the students.
Marshall also pointed out some
of the ways in which the Justice
Department was attempting to
remedy the non-representation
of Mississippi Negroes. A county
by county canvass has been con
ducted in the last two-and-one
half years with more than fifty
counties being covered. Voter ap
plications of whites and Negroes
are being compared and processed
for use as evidence in suits
against the state of Mississippi.
When asked for an evaluation
of the Aaron Henry for Governor
Campaign, Marshall stated that
it won't have any direct effort on
government action, but that the
national reaction to the situation
may help pass legislation needed
to give the government acting
powers. The Justice Department
will still be unable to participate
directly in personal cases involv
ing campaign workers, but the
overall effect of the campaign, if
successfully completed, can no t
help but further the cause of civil
rights.
