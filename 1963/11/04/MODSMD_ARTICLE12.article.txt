# LASSU As Restrained By Archaic Regulation

Stanford students are being driven out of Mississippi towns
at gunpoint. Stanford volunteer donations poured over $1,000
per day into Mississippi all last week. Few issues have brought
as much intense interest and participation from the Stanford
community as tlie question of constitutional rights in Missis
sippi.
On Thursday night our large and highly representative
student legislature met. And by virtue of a Board of Trustees
ruling of last year they were unable to express their feelings
on Mississippi, to perhaps state that the legislature of the
Associated Students of Stanford University condemns the
violation of constitutional rights in Mississippi. Our legisla
ture is barred from speaking out on "off campus issues."
That any group should be permitted to define for the stu
dent body what issues are of concern to it as a whole is inde
fensible. The students of the University of the Pacific, for
example, have sent a strong resolution on behalf of their stu
dent body to Congress, the President, the press. When the
lives of Stanford students are being endangered in an effort
to secure the constitutional rights of American citizens, we
are faced with something of which the Stanford students
should be permitted to speak through their legislative organ.
That a line can be drawn between the university and the
world, that one can declare the events of Mississippi unrelated
to the campus is an example of an archaic conception of the
isolated academic world. The educated man has a social com
mitment, and the educational institution must serve as the
leader of social and intellectual ferment and not the slow re
action to it.
Mississippi is not an "off-campus issue," whatever attempt
at definition one may make with that ludicrous phrase. The
academic community must make the world its province, and
students must not be hampered from lending their voice to
the issues of our time. May we not comment upon the educa
tion bill before Congress? Upon the banning of the National
Union of South African Students? Upon Mississippi?
We as students must demand release from these false
bonds, that our legislature not be silenced.
