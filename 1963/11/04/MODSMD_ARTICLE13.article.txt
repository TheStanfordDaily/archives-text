JACKSON, Miss. Oct. 21 â€” As
one enters the rotunda of Missis
sippi's Renaissance-styled capitol
building, he is immediately greet
ed by lovely color photographs of
Lynda Lee Mead and Mary Ann
Mobley, the state's two recent
Miss America winners.
Behind a column on the other
side of the rotunda is a water
fountain, above which the word
"WHITE" is boldly imprinted.
INSIDE AN adjoining office,
Ross Barnett, governor of Missis
sippi, sat back and, speaking in
a slow Southern drawl, expressed
the hostile reaction of the Missis
sipi white community to the
arrival of Yale students in the
state.
"All we ask is the same treat
ment from other states, for them
to quit trying to run the affairs
of Mississippi and quit sending
freedom riders and agitators. We
will send Ihem to jail when they
violate our laws and will continue
to do so as long as I am gov
ernor."
The governor also defended
Mississippi's segregationist poli
cies with all the resourcefulness
of a practical Southern politician.
"I would not dare," he said dur
ing the exclusive NEWS inter
view, "to tell the people of Con
necticut or any other state what
they ought to do with their local
problems, because I am not fa
miliar with their local problems."
GOV. BARNETT s a id that
Negroes are happy in Mississippi,
"because ninety per cent who
graduate in the high schools and
colleges remain here."
"Of the last hundred million
dollars spent, by the state of Mis
sissippi for school facilities," he
continued, defending the segrega
tionist policies of his administra
tion, "sixty-three per cent of the
money has gone into Negro
schools. We are spending more
money for Negro schools accord
ing to our wealth than any state
in the nation."
"I'd say," Governor Barnett
continued, ''that Washington,

D.C., is integrated probably more
than any other section in the na
tion. It has more crime than any
other section in the nation.
"Mississippi has no integration
in the public schools," he added
proudly, "and it is the only state
in the nation that doesn't have.
Our state is next to the lowest
in the commission of crime, ac
cording to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation."
TWELVE PERSONS (five Ne
groes and seven whites) had been
arrested in Jackson a day earlier
for attempting to enter white
churches, and on this very day
the Supreme Court was deliberat
ing on the charge of criminal con
tempt the Governor had received
during last year's turmoil at the
University of Mississippi. Yet Mr.
Barnett remained convinced that
the Negro was well off in his
state.
"In this state," said the bespec
tacled. 65-year-old governor, "we
have one Negro school teacher
to every hundred-thirty-five Ne
gro citizens. In New York, where
they claim they integrate, they
have one teacher for every five
hundred Negroes."
Mr. Burnet continued with a
statement which had obviously
been made many times before:
"This state is probably making
more progress than any state in
the South, and probably more
than any in the nation."
THE GOVERNOR, who is for
bidden by law to succeed himself,
said he supports Paul B. Johnson,
the Democratic candidate, "whole
heartedly" and contended that the
two-party system is bad for Mis
sissippi because it divides the con
servative majority.
Mr. Barnett insisted that the
Democratic candidate is con
cerned with the problems of the
Negroes. When asked if he felt
that the campaign of Freedom-
Vote candidate Aaron Henry re
vealed any dissatisfaction among
the Negroes, he replied, "You'll
have to ask them about that."
Governor Barnett was asked
whether the segregation problems
had hurt the development of his
state. "No," he replied, "those
Northern industrialists like what
we are doing here.
"Stay around a while," he said
good-naturedly, "and we will 'doc
trinate you. Mississippi's way of
life is the best in the world."
