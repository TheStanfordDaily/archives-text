WIRE FROM JACKSON
(Editor's Note: The following
was received as a telegram to
the Daily yesterday morning.)
Editor, The Daily:
Our deepest gratitude to Ihe
students and faculty of Stanford
University whose extraordinary
support and generosity have
transformed this campaign. The
help from Stanford and Yale has
been more responsible than any
other single factor for what we
have been able to do in difficult
circumstances to build toward a
better land for all Americans,
i Your financial assistance, enthu
siasm for our cause and help in
publishing our situation have
been invaluable, but above all we
are grateful for the presence of
your people among ours and you
should know that henceforth
there will always be a touch of
Stanford in Mississippi.
Aaron Henry, Edwin King, Rob
ert Moses, Charles Evers, A. K.
Lowenstein.
MISSISSIPPI COVERAGE
Editor, The Daily:
In the Tuesday, Oct. 31, issue
of The Daily, a student protested
the use of the front page news
section as an editorial page with
the supposed result that. Stanford
Students are receiving a pre
judicial account of events in Mis
sissippi.
The student's first objection
was that the use of The Daily
included a solicitation for funds
which he claims, on the basis of
an incident: with James Baldwin
last spring, is in opposition to
past University policy. However,
; it was just that incident, which
| brought about a clarification and
j liberalization of University policy,
i In order to solicit funds a group
j must gain permission from a com
jmittee of three who decide upon
! all requests and all funds col
lected must be deposited and
withdrawn from the Student Or
ganization Fund. In light of this
The Daily request is not in viola
tion of any University policy. Fur
thermore, many non-profit groups
such as Con Home and World
University Service use the Daily
to appeal for funds. Therefore no
particular precedent is being
broken or established by another
group's request, for financial help
in the Mississippi Mock Election.
For myself. I find the level of
j reporting in this quarter's Daily
j quite refreshing. First, the in
j crease in news concerning other
1 universities has been well pre
j sented and has done much to dem
onstrate that many of the issues
j here at Stanford are revelent. at
! other campuses. Secondly, there
i has been a decrease in the at
| tempt at summarizing national
news events which should never
i be the role of a campus news
paper given the N.Y. Times,
| Christian Science Monitor, Time,
and other national news media.
i The charge that the coverage
lon the Mississippi Mock Election
reflects the personal prejudice of
I the editor is worth investigation.
I Many students feel the individual
participation of Stanford under
-1 graduates in the Mock Election
is the most important and signif
icant action taken by our student
body on civil rights. Therefore I
think the validity of printing the
events in Mississippi is well jus
tified. The question that now re
' mains is whether the reporting
I is prejudicial. If so. I am sure that
| student body would be interested
in knowing what statements are
prejudiced. Better than this, pos
sibly Mr. Peer has access to a
more sophisticated report on
the events in Mississippi by some
veteran reporter on civil rights
and certainly we should all desire
to be enlightened.

DEAN AELEN THANKED
! Editor, The Daily:
In response to a request con
cerning women's regulations gov
erning student trips such as the
I one to Mississippi to participate
in mock vote registration, Dean of
Women Lucille Allen and the
members of Women's Council
demonstrated a responsive a n d
realistic attitude. Dean Allen's
recognition of student interest in
the issue and her availability last
Monday evening when the issue
arose enabled a spirit of co-opera
tion between Women's Council
and the women students inter
ested in travelling to Mississippi.
Despite personal concern about
girls going to Mississippi under
the present circumstances, Dean
Allen interpreted the university
policy to allow girls to make the
trip. No undergraduate women
enroled at Stanford went to Mis
sissippi. but the decision may
serve as a precedent for similar
issues of student concern in the
future.
The policy, as expressed by
Women's Council, allows girls to
use their own judgment: par
ental knowledge, but not consent,
is required, and women must no

lify the university that they are
going and where they will be stay
ing. The issue is an example of
the responsiveness of official
channels to a request and the con
fidence of Dean Allen in student
judgment. We express our ap
preciation to Dean Allen for ac
cepting the responsibility of this
decision.

ARYAN VS. NEGRO?
Editor, The Daily:
In a time when the people of
the United States are just begin
ning to be liberated from the pre
judices they have maintained to
wards racial minorities, Mr. Rob
ert Luehrs, a Stanford student
(by definition an educated mani,
has revived a term which has not
been used for the past fifteen to
twenty years. It is indeed unfor
tunate that such an effective
classificatory word as "Aryan"
should drop from common usage.
Who can tell how much that is es
sential to our current racial prob
lems has been ignored through
our grievous loss of this word?
How much more definitive our
discussions of racjal tensions will
now be! Now Governor Wallace
and his comrades can match capi
tal letter for capital letter. It is
ihe Aryan vs. the Negro. Not
simply while man versus Negro.
Mere is the word with which mil
lions who crave identity can iden
tify. Yes, we should be grateful
to Mi-. Luehrs that through the
verbiage of his outrage an im
portan figment of the Western
imagination has been restored to
its rightful pace in our collective
conscience.

SIJ ROOTERS
: Editor, The Daily:
Seldom do we in the Athletic
j Department send a letter asking
that it be printed in the"Letters
; to the Editor" section of the Stan
ford daily.
However in this instance I
; would deem it a privilege to send
j our sincere thanks for the tre
| mendous job done by the stu
dents, the rooting section and all
those connected with the opera
tion of last week's football game
— the Notre Dame-Stanford game.
As this was a nationally tele
vised game where about 50,000,-
000 people were going to view it,
we were of course concerned that
the entire program go well. I
believe there is no doubt that this
was the finest television pro
gram of the National TV Game
of the Week that has been pre
sented this year. This was told
to me by the CBS people, and
every person who was in th e
Stadium certainly concurs with
that opinion.
Being a Stanford graduate my
self, I felt very proud of Stanford
and was extremely pleased with
the conduct of the rooting section
and the perfect card stunts. I be
lieve Edgar Keiser and all of his
committees should have a big pat
on the back for a job well done.
Mike McCardle the Band Manager
did a tremendous job, and I was
particularly impressed by and
appreciative of the excellent work
that Art Barnes the Band Director
did in the entire operation. I have
received around 100 calls and com
ments concerning the new ar
rangement of the National An
-1 them, which was spectacular and
impressive.
The Athletic Department wishes
to express sincere appreciation
for a tremendous effort on the
part of all our students involved
in this production. I believe that
the Stanford student body can be
proud of themselves for their
part in it.

Director of Athletics
PEACE CORPS THANKS
Editor, The Daily:
With your kind permission. I
would like to use the pages of
the Stanford Daily to thank the
members of the Stanford faculty
and student body who were so
helpful and cooperative during
our recent visit to Stanford.
As a Stanford graduate (LL.B,
2949) x was not surprised, but I
was certainly pleased at the won
derful response of faculty a n d
students.
Those of us who work for the
Peace Corps tend to get so caught
up in the urgency and spirit of
the moment that we sometimes
lose sight of the problems which
our needs may create for others.
We are especially grateful to
members of the faculty who per
mitted us to speak in their classes
and to administration and student
union officials and students
whose very fine cooperation and
help assisted us through many
problems.
—CHARLES C. WOODARD, IR.,
Associate Director,
Peace Corps
