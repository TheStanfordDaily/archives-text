# Two Stanford Grad Students Killed Sunday
## 
### 
Two Stanford students were
killed early Sunday morning
when the car in which they were
riding was rammed broadside by
another vehicle.
The victims were Robert C.
Malkin, 22, of Menlo Park, and
John R. Barth, 25, Palo Alto.
Both were graduate students at
Stanford University. They were
dead on arrival at Palo Alto-Stan
ford Medical Center.
The driver of the other vehicle,
Ronald G. Da vies. 21, of BurJin
game, was booked in city jail on
a charge of felony drunk driving.
According to police, Davis's
auto ran a stop sign at the corner
of Middlefield Road and Univer
sity Avenue, and crashed broad
side into the car. Davis left his
car and was apprehended near the
scene of the accident.
The students apparently had
just reutrned from a biological
field trip to Dillion Beach in So
noma County. Malkin and Barth
left the group to return a uni
versity automobile which they
had taken on the trip to the mu
seum. There they picked up their
own car, a Hillman soft-top, and
were returning to the Biology
building when the fatal accident
occurred.
John Raymond Barth, of Hills
borough, Calif., graduated from
Stanford University in April of
1960 in Chemical Engineering. He
was a member of Phi Beta Kappa,
Tau Beta Pi. and the American
Institute of Chemical Engineers.
He had been living in Stern this
year. He was working for his doc
torate in Biological Science.
Robert Christopher "Kit" Mal
kin was in his first quarter at.
Stanford University as a graduate
student. He came from Van
couver, British Columbia. He
graduated from the University of
British Columbia in June, 1963,
with a first class rating and
honors in four subjects, and did
summer work at Duke University
prior to coming to Stanford.
Barth's parents have already
arrived on campus, his mother
coming from Hillsborough, and
his father flying in from Chicago,
but authorities have been unable
to contact Malkin's parents so
far. They are apparently in Aus
tralia now. An uncle has been
located, however, and efforts to
reach them are continuing.
At this time, no funeral services
have been set.

John R. Barth, 25, Palo Alto.
Both were graduate students at
Stanford University. They were
