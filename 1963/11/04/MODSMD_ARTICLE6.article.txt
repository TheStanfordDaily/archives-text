### 
Dr. Stefan Possony. director of
| the international studies program
I at the Hoover Institution, criti
-1 ci/ed Secretary of Defense Robert
i McNamara Saturday for "al
i tempting to take us back to the
cavalry and mules." and called the
test ban treaty between the
United and Russia "a trap into
i which we fell with both our feet."
j Possony said that at the present
I rate of phasing out military weap
-1 ons our firepower would be re-
I duced ninty percent by 1972.
Since McNamara came to power,
he said, "not a single new weap
-1 ons system has been approved."
Possony spoke at a JNorthern
I California Leadership Conference
I of the California Young Republi
; can College Federation (CYRCF).
About 40 of the top leaders of the
| College Federation attended.
I Hitting U.S. foreign policy, Pos
i sony said that "everytime the
word victory is uttered, someone
| says, 'You want nuclear war.'"
He doesn't want nuclear war, he
| said, but "the only way you can
| deal with the Communists is from
I a position of strength. Now it
j wasn't Senator Goldwater who in
vented that concept; it was Dean
Acheson." Acheson was Secretary
1 of State under former President
Truman.
"As far as the Democrats are
concerned, the armament program
is the modern equivalent of the
YV.P.A.," Possony said. But hi s
I criticisms were not confined to
the Democrats. "At the same
| time, the Republicans are wrong
i in insisting on holding down mili-
I tary spending just for budget
reasons."
