### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
Over a weekend marked by incidents that could have come from
a sensationalized novel of intrigue, the Mississippi "Aaron Henry
lor Governor" campaign reached the mock vote stage.
As had been expected, the "votemobile" operating in rural com
munities on Saturday brought the greatest problem. Stanford stu-

dent Hugh Smith and SNCC
workers Bruce Payne and George
Green were driven from Nachez,
Mississippi in a chase of over
100 miles at speds reaching up to
105 miles per hour. They were
being shot at all the while, and
lost their assailants when they
entered urban traffic. None were
injured, although the bullet holes
in the car served as grim testi
mony of their day of handing out
mock vote ballots.
Payne was beaten in a Nachez
gas station last week, and ex
presed the belief that the auto
chase was conducted by the same
men who had attacked him be
fore.
NEGRO CAMPAIGN worker
Ivanhoe Donaldson was held at
gunpoint in the Jackson airport
Saturday when he went to meet
campaign manager Bob Moses.
He was made to stand with his

! hands on the car as the police
I rapped him on the knuckles and
told him the federal government
had no jurisdiction there. Wit h
a gun at Donaldson's head, the
police asked, "Do you thing a
| white man is better than a nig
• ger?" Donaldson replied "no."
1 and the officer stated, "I'm going
I to shoot you, nigger." This inter
j change continued for several min
| utes, and Donaldson was released
unharmed.
Stanford student Hugh Smith
! stopped at a market near Oxford
on Saturday and was met with
gunfire as he returned to his car.
On the basis of over 200 incidents,
I campaign advisory committee
i chairman Allard Lowenstein com
j mented Saturday, "Jackson is in
a state of seige."
Fearing "possibility of further
i shootings leading to death" Henry
I for Governor headquarters d i s
patched telegrams to President
Kennedy and his brother Attorney
j General Robert Kennedy early
Saturday morning. As of Sunday
night neither federal marshals
nor replies had arrived.
An Aaron Henry rally in Bu
lovic, Mississippi Friday night
was attacked by a mob of white
citizens. All windows in the
Church site of the rally were
broken as the police stood by,
running sirens but taking no ac
tion. The white press in Jackson
i reported the story under the head
line "Mixed Church Affair Sparks
Battle."
VALE STUDENT from Oxford,
j England Nicolas Bosarquet was
i arrested in Jackson Saturday
night at a concert of the British
j Philharmonic in the Municipal
Auditorium there. Bosarquet, who
is merely observing the campaign
| and playing no part in it, was
! with a Negro music major from
Tuskegee College in Mississippi.
, The pair were arrested on $."500
i bond on charges of disturbing the
j peace. The tax-supported audi
j torium in Jackson is a segregated
i hall. Bond money was borrowed
I for them and they were released
i Saturday night.
In Jackson Saturday Stanford
student Fred Goff was ordered
i out of a Negro cafe by three
! policeman when he stopped for a
coke. 'You can buy a coke at a
nigger restaurant, but you can't
drink it there. You can live with
niggers if you want to, but not in
. Mississippi." Goff was told by the
j police.
Students were followed by police
continually, were ordered out of
' more than a dozen towns, found
I gas tanks filled with water upon
'leaving police stations, were
driven from Negroes' doors at
gunpoint by white citizens.
Lowenstein stressed that Stan
ford students were in a most pecu
liar position in Mississippi as
most were working in the most
liberal county in that state.
"Washington County," he com
mented. "is still not in the twen
tieth century, but is unlike the
1 rest of Mississippi The Negro is

still on 1 lie master/servant rela
tionship. hut the police are learn
ing some tolerance of dissent.
Even they, however, have no in
tentions of any integration."
IN REFERENCE to the cam
paign in general, Lowenstein com
mented, "It has been important to
know what Mississippi will do to
keep people down. The very fact
of Negroes wearing campaign
buttons for the first time, of see
ing a Negro girl on white televi
sion — on time Stanford money
made possible — telling them to
vote for Henry, has been a great
educational experience for the
state.
"The psychological impact upon
the Negroes of outside support,
the growing awareness of whites
of what is coming has succeeded
in doing something in Mississippi
far beyond our expectations. The
loudest cheer at the Jackson rally
was at our announcement of the
Stanford work; the place came to
life. We have finally promised
these people something, and hope
fully won't stop now."
As the first ballots were counted
Jackson headquarters said last
night that the vote will definitely
hit 100,000 or over, with votes
coming in from over 300 towns.
Normally the final gubernatorial
election in Mississippi brings in
50 to 100 thousand votes. This
year, with a race going. Demo
crat Paul Johnson is expected to
attract 300 to 400 thousand.votes.
Mock vote polls close at noon to
day.
