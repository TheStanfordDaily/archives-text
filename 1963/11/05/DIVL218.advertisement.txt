THE HOLY ANGER OF GOD
The "wrath of Clod" is not the rage and tantrums of an emotionally imma
ture Clod—man's projected father-image of God, but a result of the holy
nature of the true, liv ing God acting to justly reward and punish all man
kind.
"The Lord is a jealous God and avenging, the Lord avenges and He is
full of wrath; the Lord takes vengeance on I lis adversaries and reserves
wrath for his enemies. The Lord is slow to anger and great in power,
and will by no means clear the guilty. The Lord has His way in the whirl
wind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of I lis feet."' Nah. t :2-3
"... do you imagine that you . . . will escape the judgment of God? Or
do you think lightly of his wealth of kindness, of tolerance, and of pa
tience, without recognizing that God's kindness is meant to -lead you
to a change of heart? In the rigid obstinacy of your heart you are laying
up lor yourself a store of retribution for the day of retribution, when God's
judgment will be revealed and he will pay every man for what he has
done. To those glory, honor, and immortality by steady persistence in
well-doing, he will give eternal life; but for those who are governed by
seliish ambition, who refuse obedience to the truth and take wrong lor
their guide, there w ill be the fury of retribution." Rom. ::: S.
In the present Age, the divine anger of God is withheld in order that all
men who will, might be saved—the wrath of God is yet to come.
"Heboid the day of the Lord comes! Fierce, with wrath and raging anger, I
to make the land and the whole earth e desolation, and to destroy out
of it is sinners." Is. 13:9. I
"For we see divine retribution revealed from heaven and falling upon all I
the godless wickedness of men. In their wickedness they arc stilling the
truth. For all that may be known of God by men lies plain before their
eves; indeed God has himself disclosed it to them. 1 lis invisible attributes,
that is to say his everlasting power and deity, have been visible, ever
since the world began, to the eye of reason, in the things lie has made.
There is therefore 110 possible defense; knowing God, they have refused
to honor him as God or to rndcr him thanks. Hence, all their thinking
has ended 111 futility, and their misguided minds are plunged into dark
ness. They boast of wisdom, hut they have made fools of themselves . . ."
Rom. 1: tN 22.
God is love: the scriptures leave no double about this. But the loev of God
is directly experienced only by those who have accepted (Christ and given
their lives to 1 lim.
"I le who puts his faith in the Son has hold of eternal life, but he who

THE HOLY ANGER OF GOD
The "wrath of Clod" is not the rage and tantrums of an emotionally imma
ture Clod—man's projected father-image of God, but a result of the holy
nature of the true, liv ing God acting to justly reward and punish all man
kind.
"The Lord is a jealous God and avenging, the Lord avenges and He is
full of wrath; the Lord takes vengeance on I lis adversaries and reserves
wrath for his enemies. The Lord is slow to anger and great in power,
and will by no means clear the guilty. The Lord has His way in the whirl
wind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of I lis feet."' Nah. t :2-3
"... do you imagine that you . . . will escape the judgment of God? Or
do you think lightly of his wealth of kindness, of tolerance, and of pa
tience, without recognizing that God's kindness is meant to -lead you
to a change of heart? In the rigid obstinacy of your heart you are laying
up lor yourself a store of retribution for the day of retribution, when God's
judgment will be revealed and he will pay every man for what he has
done. To those glory, honor, and immortality by steady persistence in
well-doing, he will give eternal life; but for those who are governed by
seliish ambition, who refuse obedience to the truth and take wrong lor
their guide, there w ill be the fury of retribution." Rom. ::: S.
In the present Age, the divine anger of God is withheld in order that all
men who will, might be saved—the wrath of God is yet to come.
"Heboid the day of the Lord comes! Fierce, with wrath and raging anger, I
to make the land and the whole earth e desolation, and to destroy out
of it is sinners." Is. 13:9. I
"For we see divine retribution revealed from heaven and falling upon all I
the godless wickedness of men. In their wickedness they arc stilling the
truth. For all that may be known of God by men lies plain before their
eves; indeed God has himself disclosed it to them. 1 lis invisible attributes,
that is to say his everlasting power and deity, have been visible, ever
since the world began, to the eye of reason, in the things lie has made.
There is therefore 110 possible defense; knowing God, they have refused
