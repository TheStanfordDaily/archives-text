# S.U. Southern Students and Profs Express Opinions for Daily Survey
## 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
A telephone survey conducted
by The Daily revealed a variety
of attitudes toward the Mock
Vote held by professors and stu
dents from southern states.
Though most of those who com
mented at all had no particular
objection to the holding of the
Mock Vote, several expressed
doubt as to its effectiveness, to
I ho way il was being conducted,
and to its importance. And re
garding the role of college stu
dents from Stanford and Yale in
conducting the mock election,
opinion ranged even more widely.
H. J. FORSTMAN, assistant
professor of religion from Ala
bama, said that the Mock Vote,
if successful, "ought to demon
strate to the country (if not the
people of Mississippi) the neces
sity of allowing Negroes to vote."
He said he considered it "one of
the most prominent demonstra
tions in the civil rights movement
up to this time â€” side by side
with the one at Birmingham."
Dr. John Loft is, Associate Ex
ecutive Head of the English De
partment, who is from Georgia,
said he was "altogether in sym
pathy with the objective of the
Mock Vote, obtaining equal vot
ing rights for Negroes." Like
Forstman. he expressed admira
tion for the students' part in the
campaign. Forstman added, "that
college students have been work
ing so vigorously both on the
scene and through financial con
tributions shows that the issue
cannot be kept local; this is
greatly heartening."
"The mock vote will crystallize
opposition, and it looks like it's
going to work," said John Rosen
berg, an Alabaman. He added,
however, that it would probably
hurt the role of the Mississippi
moderates, undermining local
agitation. "But they couldn't in
fluence anything before, anyway,"
he said.
A STUDKNT from Georgia
who felt the Mock Vote would be
ineffective said it was "merely
an opportunity for liberal do
gooders to assume a noble pos
ture." lie added that everyone
knew there were inequities in the
governmental system but that
outside interference such as this
only made the removal of them
more difficult.
Harry Freiburg, a student from
New Orleans, was in sympathy
with the aims of the mock elec
tion but did not feel it would do
any good. "The state is so or
ganized that this is just a little
ripple Barnett and his people will
ignore." Colored people and white
people who want to resist are
too scared, he said; "they've been
told they've had it if they lift, a
finger." The campaign hasn't
been given enough national publi
city, he added; regardless of the
enthusiasm and ideals of Ihe
campaigners, "practically it won't
work."
Several southerners expressed
concern over the way the cam
paign was being conducted, "it
is certainly worthwhile, but there
should be more controls, as in a
regular legal election." said Joe
Cannon, of South Carolina. Ac
cording to Irene Mangold, of Ya
zoo City, Mississippi, the mock
vote would be much more effec
tive if there were two colored
candidates for governor, who
could debate about real issues;
"this would point out how ridicu
lous the regular white election is
with the choice of candidates it
offers," she said.
"It's generally known that Bar
nett doesn't repivsent his state,
but the Mock Vote by itself is not
enough concrete action to change
things radically." said a student
from Alabama who didn't want
his name printed because, as he
said. "1 have to go home at Christ
mas."
.MOST A(.KI I I) that the atti
tude of most of the Mississip
pians towarrl the college students

j would be hostile because "agita
! tion by outsiders is never wel
j come." "I hate to see outsiders
! come in," said Freiburg, "but it
will eventually take outsiders,
since the Negroes and whites of
the south are unable to work out
| a solution among themselves."
An Alabama student questioned
| the motives of the students;
"many of the people aren't that
| dedicated, and some may be go
j ing just for a lark," he said.
1 "Nevertheless, they're probably
| accomplishing something." He
cited the "insurmountable amount
of pressure" on Mississippi civil
! rights leaders as a reason why
j outside help was necessary.
"White agitators are never ap
j predated," Miss Mangold said,
j She suggested Ihat if students
from the North actually attended
: Ole Miss or another state univer
sity for at least a quarter their
presence would not be so rank
ling, and they could be more
I effective.
I Several southerners felt the
students had no right in the south
i because of their ignorance about
'the situation. According to
j Michael Bowers of Georgia,
j "white southerners are not disen
j franchising the Negroes because
| they wish to do them harm. This
is a holdover from Reconstruc
| tion." which he said was a time
of tremendous upheaval in the
j South when the poor whites,
I stirred up by "prospective politi
j dans," became afraid of the
j newly liberated black masses.
"Southerners didn't believe th e
| Reconstruction was equitable,
! and viewed the Negro as a threat.
I It takes education on both sides
I to wipe this out." he said.
I The opposite view was ex
j pressed by a student from Ten
: nessee. "Though the presence of
the college students will aggra
vate feelings of resentment and
mostility among the white Mis
sissippians, their idealism and
enthusiasm is admirable."
