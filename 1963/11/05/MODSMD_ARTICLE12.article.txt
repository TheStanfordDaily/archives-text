## 
### 
Students interested in business
administration and wishing to
work for short periods overseas
are invited to a meeting tonight
at 7:15 in Room 271 of Tresidder
Union.
THE PROGRAM is sponsored
by AIESEC, an international stu
dent organization whieh provides
job opportunities for American
students interested in short term
employment in foreign countries.
The jobs are managerial and are
prov i d e d mostly by English
speaking firms in Europe, the Far
East, and South America. These
jobs or traineeships usually take
place during the summer, b u t
work is also available during the
school year.
Last year, three Stanford stu
dents received employment under
the program; one for work in
Lodon, one in Sweden, and one in
Tokyo.
ALTHOUGH the students must
pay their own transportation ex
penses to the job, the company
pays wages sufficient for living
and traveling while in the coun
try. Students must bo at least
sophomores and have an interest
in some aspect of busines admin
istration. No specific courses are
required.
AIESEC was founded in 1948
and is recognized by the U.S.
State Department as an official
Exchange-Visitor Program. Over
350 American students worked
abroad last summer under this
employment program.
The jobs are for durations of H
weeks to 3 months, and employ
ment is available in 10 countries.
