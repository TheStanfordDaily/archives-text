# Thousands at Henry Rally; Stanford Students Return
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
An estimated three thousand voices were singing "Oh Freedom"
in the auditorium below Henry headquarters last night as ballotin»
figures were revealed to the Daily. With most major areas still un
reported, 25,500 ballots for Aaron Henry were reported in the mock
vote, 100 for Democrat Paul Johnson, and 40 for Republican Rubel
★ ★ ★ I Phillips. The "legal vote" takes

place today.
Due to mail-in ballots, official
"mock election" totals will not
be available for about one week,
although the estimate of 60 to
90 thousand total was given by
SNCC worker Mendy Sandstein
last night.
The crowd of 3,000 was gath
ered in Jackson for a Henry vic
tory rally which began at 7:30
last night and was going strong
at 10:30 Mississippi time. The
crowd was 95 per cent Negro, and
was addressed later in the eve
ning by "freedom vote" guberna
torial candidate Aaron Henry.
AS THE campaign ended and
Stanford students departed late
last night, Sandstein commented,
"There is no question of the im
port of this campaign in terms of
voter education and securing the
franchise for the Mississippi Ne
gro. Important organizational
groupings have been made in
every area of the state; tremen
dous analysis will bo made and
Bob Moses and I will stay down
here to work on Negro voter edu
cation and on food and clothing
drives such as the University of
Chicago conducted last year."
Five campaign workers we r e
harassed yesterday in Yazoo City,
Mississippi, as they attempted to
canvass for the mock vote.
George Raymond of CORE re
ported, "When we got into town
they were waiting for us. There
were city police and two state
troopers. Everywhere we went,
there was a policeman on either
side and one in back. They kept
saying that the others should
back away so they could take me
in an alley and kill me.
"WHEN WE walked into a
store, the police told them not to
serve us; they wouldn't let any
one permit us to use a telephone.
They arrested Lenora Simon, a
CORE worker with us, for pass
ing out Henry leaflets. We stayed
in town until we got hold of the
$500 bail to get her out.
"On the way back to Jackson,
we were stopped on the highway,
and interrogated for an hour.
The police wrote agitator on my
drivers license in ink."
Stanford student Frank Dubof
sky said that fear and intimida
tion had kept vote totals down,
that ministers referred to the
Alabama bombing when asked if
their church could be used for
balloting, that store owners
stated that mortgages were held
by whites when asked if their
shops could be used for balloting.
Only in Holly Springs, in North
ern Mississippi, were votemobiles
effectively set up. In all other
places, workers went from door
to door explaining the vote for
freedom at the same time they
tried to get votes, or worked with
local ministers in their churches.
Campaign advisory committee
chairman A llard Lowenstein
stated he will be at Stanford dur
ing the first week of December
to present the student body with
a report on how their volunteer
donations were used and on the
meaning of the campaign.
