ROTC
Editor, Tiic Daily:
In response to Holly Chenery's
letter re ROTC in the Daily of
October 25, we would like to men
tion two small points which she
has apparently overlooked.
1) Freedom h a s historically
been obtained by the people only
through sacrifice, oflen of a physi
cal nature, and once won it has
had to be protected from those
who would deprive the people of
this freedom. Those nations
which have proved unwilling or
unable to defend themselves no
longer have their freedom. Who
finally stopped Hitler—those stu
dents in Britain who, in the 1930'5,
signed the Oxford Oath, pledging
"never to fight for King and
Country?"
2) Given the fact that present
international conditions require
the maintenance of a national de
fense force, it is better to abolish
ROTC and entrust the command
responsibilities within this de
fense force to those who, lacking
the type of education offered by
such institutions as Stanford, are
unable to appreciate those same
fredoms whose protection Miss
Chenery believes are so vital?

Editor, Tlu> Daily:
The letters of Messrs. Gurney
and Compton concerning (he ques
tion of military training on a uni
versity campus unintentionally
emphasize some of the more co
gent arguments against such
training. Both letters reveal a
a fatalistic acceptance of the use
of force and violence in the solu
tion of international conflict. In
a rather absurd analogy Mr. Gur
ney equates war (generally
agreed to be caused by men) and
disease (supposedly caused by
germs, although with the devel
opment of biological warfare man
appears to be making an attempt
in this field on his own). Doctors
work to eliminate disease, and re
sponsible leaders should be work
ing to do away with war instead
of accepting it. War and violence
CANNOT be eliminated "just by
not thinking about them," nor can
they be eliminated by their un
considered acceptance as a means
of conflict resolution.
With a withering blow in the
name of "realism" Mr. Compton
notes that the "history of 'civili
zation' has been continually linked
with organized killing of individ
uals." It would seem that the re
sults of this practice in the past
and our present potential for
mass murder make it impertive
that we find some alternative to
this insanity. How can it be real
ism to accept it?
Neither the letter of Mr. Gur
ney nor that of Mr. Compton
leaves any room for the solution
of serious international conflicts
outside of violence or the threat
of violence ( historically the latter
has had a disturbing tendency to
become the former). Ideally a
university should be a community
constantly attempting to examine
the values of society from a uni
quely advantageous position.
When military attitudes are al
lowed to pervade this atmosphere,
the examination of values is ob
viously prejudiced as these two
letters indicate by their un
examined acceptance of violence.
Fortunately, some work is now
being done by psychologists and
political scientists in the investi
gation of non-violent alternatives
to war, but this has had little
publicity. I suspect that this is
largely due to the prevalence of
militaristic assumptions in o u r
society, none of which is amelio
rated by the presence of military
training at institutions of learn
ing.

AN ARKANSAN REPLIES
Editor, The Daily:
The remarks in the "Alabama
Replies" letter in Friday's Daily
are fairly typical of Southern
"moderates." 1 too, used to think
that outsiders, such as the Free
dom Riders, were only creating
unnecessary discord, which was
harmful to the cause. But I have
come to realize that this position
is not correct. The fact is that
most Southern States will do
nothing about the existing racial
segregation unless forced to,
either by insiders or outsiders.
The state and local governments
and their police forces, as we
have seen, are sympathetic to the
segregationist stand, and are sup
ported by a large body of South
ern whites. The Southern moder
ates, such as Mary D. Mahathy,
are acquiescent; the few South
ern liberals are greatly overpow
ered. Help for the Negro must
come from the outside, if we are
to right this situation, at least
according to Federal law, in the
not-too-distant future. The situa
tion, as created by the Souther
nors, calLs for outside interven
tion in order that the existing
state of affairs may be forced
into national recognition, so that
it can be remedied by the Federal
Government, backed (as has been
proven necessary) by Federal
troops.
I personally feel that it is un
fortunate that such measures are
necessary, but anything less will
come to no avail. The Southern
States (they are the most blatant,
but let us remember that states
in other parts of the U.S. are not
to be excluded) have kept the
Negro from exercising his rights

long enough; the time has come j
for action leading to positive re-;
suits. Granted, such action will
lead to civil strife and racial un
rest, at least as an intermediate
step; but such'is caused by the
Southern "rednecks," backed by
their police forces (many of
whom are "rednecks" them
selves i, in active resistance to
those who merely seek what they
are entitled to under law. The
Southern moderates have demon
strated in the past that they will
take no active part in ihe prob
lem unless strongly forced to by
others. The "Aaron Henry Pro
gram," carried on with the help
of Yale, Stanford, and other "out
siders," is just such an action
which will lead, eventually, to
positive results. The Southern
States leave us no choice; Ameri
cans must act now to remove
this stigma, entangled as it is
within the state laws, from our
society.

ADMINISTRATION
Editor, The Daily:
Two present situations reflect
poorly on the strength of Stan
ford's administration:
1) On Registration Day this
year, the Stanford Administration
banned the sale by solicitation of
the Campus Voice from Univer
sity property. The Voice had ap
parently not applied for permis
sion to distribute its copy, thus
i violating an administrative regu
lation. There may have been other
factors influencing this decision.
At any rate, today the Voice is
still being sold on Stanford prop
erty in the prohibited solicitation
manner.
21 The Fundamental Standard!
has become a well-known part of
Stanford's tradition. In recom
mending the Standard to the Uni
versity's students, the adminis
tration shows clear approval of
it. While compliance with the
Standard is the decision of the in
dividual Stanford student., with
whom alone it is concerned, the!
administration should not fail to ;
encourage actively the observance '
of this Standard, as it has recom
j mended. Yet when representa
| tives of University authority fail
to comment on clear and open vio-
I lations of the Standard (namely,
| those involving the state law
against minors' possessing intoxi
cating beverages), it would seem
that the administration is qual
ifying, at least by default, its sup
posed complete support of t he j
Standard. The students should be \
the primary defenders of the!
Standard. And, if necessary, the!
police must be the enforcers of !
the laws for which the Standard!
affirms a respect. But this does j
not remove the administration;
from its obligation to express dis
approval of violations of the
Standard. This, however is ap
parently the case.
In both these instances, the ad
ministration has failed to support
actively its professed policies and
beliefs. If observance of Univer
sity regulations in (1) is not even
going to be enforced and in (2)
is hardly going to be encouraged,
the administration ought to offer |
some justification to the student
body. If it doesn't, then, by de
fault, it admits that it lacks the
moral courage and conviction to
uphold its own decisions and atti
tudes.

LASSU CHARTERS
Editor, The Daily:
According to last Friday's
Daily, "Ed Shaw, Student Finan
cial Manager, called for and se
cured a resolution to the effect
that LASSU would accept respon
sibility for future plane flights by
creating an organization that
would serve as a veritable clear-j
inghouse for such flights if the
administration consents . . . The
necessity to protect students from
such situations (as the one last
spring) was given as the ration-1
ale for the formation of this or
ganization."
I think that this is not only a
wrong approach to the problem j
of unscrupulous travel agencies, j
but a harmful one as well.
It is wrong in that it is totally
defensive in nature. It does
nothing to eliminate the problem.
I think a more constructive reso
lution would have been one favor
ing a recent proposal to the Cali
fornia legislature which would re
quire all travel agents to be
bonded. If made a law, this would
mean that all licensed travel
agents would necessarily be fi
nancially solvent.
More important to me, how
ever, is the dangerous assumption
behind this resolution. Financial
Manager Shaw stated it well in a
letter to Dean Winbigler (part of
which was mimeographed and
distributed to LASSU reps) in
which he said "there is a definite
moral obligation involved" for
Stanford to protect its students in
this particular instance. I agree
that there is a moral obligation !
involved. It is not to protect the j
students, however, but to help |
them realize that they must be 1
responsible for their own actions, i
That is to say. one of the duties
of this university is to teach its I
students to take care of them-1
selves, for they will eventually !
have to leave Stanford's benevo-1
lent paternalism for a society j
which demands self-sufficiency.

The letters of Messrs. Gurney
and Compton concerning (he ques
tion of military training on a uni
versity campus unintentionally
emphasize some of the more co
gent arguments against such
training. Both letters reveal a
a fatalistic acceptance of the use
of force and violence in the solu
tion of international conflict. In
a rather absurd analogy Mr. Gur
ney equates war (generally
agreed to be caused by men) and
disease (supposedly caused by
germs, although with the devel
opment of biological warfare man
appears to be making an attempt
in this field on his own). Doctors
work to eliminate disease, and re
sponsible leaders should be work
ing to do away with war instead
of accepting it. War and violence
CANNOT be eliminated "just by
not thinking about them," nor can
they be eliminated by their un
considered acceptance as a means
of conflict resolution.
With a withering blow in the
name of "realism" Mr. Compton
notes that the "history of 'civili
zation' has been continually linked
with organized killing of individ
uals." It would seem that the re
sults of this practice in the past
and our present potential for
mass murder make it impertive
that we find some alternative to
this insanity. How can it be real
ism to accept it?
Neither the letter of Mr. Gur
ney nor that of Mr. Compton
leaves any room for the solution
of serious international conflicts
outside of violence or the threat
of violence ( historically the latter
has had a disturbing tendency to
become the former). Ideally a
university should be a community
constantly attempting to examine
the values of society from a uni
quely advantageous position.
When military attitudes are al
lowed to pervade this atmosphere,
the examination of values is ob
viously prejudiced as these two
letters indicate by their un
examined acceptance of violence.
Fortunately, some work is now
being done by psychologists and
political scientists in the investi
gation of non-violent alternatives
to war, but this has had little
publicity. I suspect that this is
largely due to the prevalence of
militaristic assumptions in o u r
society, none of which is amelio
rated by the presence of military
training at institutions of learn
ing.

AN ARKANSAN REPLIES
Editor, The Daily:
The remarks in the "Alabama
Replies" letter in Friday's Daily
are fairly typical of Southern
"moderates." 1 too, used to think
that outsiders, such as the Free
dom Riders, were only creating
unnecessary discord, which was
harmful to the cause. But I have
come to realize that this position
is not correct. The fact is that
most Southern States will do
nothing about the existing racial
segregation unless forced to,
either by insiders or outsiders.
The state and local governments
and their police forces, as we
have seen, are sympathetic to the
segregationist stand, and are sup
ported by a large body of South
ern whites. The Southern moder
ates, such as Mary D. Mahathy,
are acquiescent; the few South
ern liberals are greatly overpow
ered. Help for the Negro must
come from the outside, if we are
to right this situation, at least
according to Federal law, in the
not-too-distant future. The situa
tion, as created by the Souther
nors, calLs for outside interven
tion in order that the existing
state of affairs may be forced
into national recognition, so that
it can be remedied by the Federal
Government, backed (as has been
proven necessary) by Federal
troops.
I personally feel that it is un
fortunate that such measures are
necessary, but anything less will
come to no avail. The Southern
States (they are the most blatant,
but let us remember that states
in other parts of the U.S. are not
to be excluded) have kept the
Negro from exercising his rights

long enough; the time has come j
for action leading to positive re-;
suits. Granted, such action will
lead to civil strife and racial un
rest, at least as an intermediate
step; but such'is caused by the
Southern "rednecks," backed by
their police forces (many of
whom are "rednecks" them
selves i, in active resistance to
those who merely seek what they
are entitled to under law. The
Southern moderates have demon
strated in the past that they will
take no active part in ihe prob
lem unless strongly forced to by
others. The "Aaron Henry Pro
gram," carried on with the help
of Yale, Stanford, and other "out
siders," is just such an action
which will lead, eventually, to
positive results. The Southern
States leave us no choice; Ameri
cans must act now to remove
this stigma, entangled as it is
within the state laws, from our
society.

ADMINISTRATION
Editor, The Daily:
Two present situations reflect
poorly on the strength of Stan
ford's administration:
1) On Registration Day this
year, the Stanford Administration
banned the sale by solicitation of
the Campus Voice from Univer
sity property. The Voice had ap
parently not applied for permis
sion to distribute its copy, thus
i violating an administrative regu
lation. There may have been other
factors influencing this decision.
At any rate, today the Voice is
still being sold on Stanford prop
erty in the prohibited solicitation
manner.
21 The Fundamental Standard!
has become a well-known part of
Stanford's tradition. In recom
mending the Standard to the Uni
versity's students, the adminis
tration shows clear approval of
it. While compliance with the
Standard is the decision of the in
dividual Stanford student., with
whom alone it is concerned, the!
administration should not fail to ;
encourage actively the observance '
of this Standard, as it has recom
j mended. Yet when representa
| tives of University authority fail
to comment on clear and open vio-
I lations of the Standard (namely,
| those involving the state law
against minors' possessing intoxi
cating beverages), it would seem
that the administration is qual
ifying, at least by default, its sup
posed complete support of t he j
Standard. The students should be \
the primary defenders of the!
Standard. And, if necessary, the!
police must be the enforcers of !
the laws for which the Standard!
affirms a respect. But this does j
not remove the administration;
from its obligation to express dis
approval of violations of the
Standard. This, however is ap
parently the case.
In both these instances, the ad
ministration has failed to support
actively its professed policies and
beliefs. If observance of Univer
sity regulations in (1) is not even
going to be enforced and in (2)
is hardly going to be encouraged,
the administration ought to offer |
some justification to the student
body. If it doesn't, then, by de
fault, it admits that it lacks the
moral courage and conviction to
uphold its own decisions and atti
tudes.

LASSU CHARTERS
Editor, The Daily:
According to last Friday's
Daily, "Ed Shaw, Student Finan
cial Manager, called for and se
cured a resolution to the effect
that LASSU would accept respon
sibility for future plane flights by
creating an organization that
would serve as a veritable clear-j
inghouse for such flights if the
administration consents . . . The
necessity to protect students from
such situations (as the one last
spring) was given as the ration-1
ale for the formation of this or
ganization."
I think that this is not only a
wrong approach to the problem j
of unscrupulous travel agencies, j
but a harmful one as well.
It is wrong in that it is totally
defensive in nature. It does
nothing to eliminate the problem.
I think a more constructive reso
lution would have been one favor
ing a recent proposal to the Cali
fornia legislature which would re
quire all travel agents to be
bonded. If made a law, this would
mean that all licensed travel
agents would necessarily be fi
nancially solvent.
More important to me, how
ever, is the dangerous assumption
behind this resolution. Financial
Manager Shaw stated it well in a
letter to Dean Winbigler (part of
which was mimeographed and
distributed to LASSU reps) in
which he said "there is a definite
moral obligation involved" for
Stanford to protect its students in
this particular instance. I agree
that there is a moral obligation !
involved. It is not to protect the j
students, however, but to help |
them realize that they must be 1
responsible for their own actions, i
That is to say. one of the duties
of this university is to teach its I
students to take care of them-1
selves, for they will eventually !
have to leave Stanford's benevo-1
lent paternalism for a society j
which demands self-sufficiency.

ROTC
Editor, Tiic Daily:
In response to Holly Chenery's
letter re ROTC in the Daily of
October 25, we would like to men
tion two small points which she
has apparently overlooked.
1) Freedom h a s historically
been obtained by the people only
through sacrifice, oflen of a physi
cal nature, and once won it has
had to be protected from those
who would deprive the people of
this freedom. Those nations
which have proved unwilling or
unable to defend themselves no
longer have their freedom. Who
finally stopped Hitler—those stu
dents in Britain who, in the 1930'5,
signed the Oxford Oath, pledging
"never to fight for King and
Country?"
2) Given the fact that present
international conditions require
the maintenance of a national de
fense force, it is better to abolish
ROTC and entrust the command
responsibilities within this de
fense force to those who, lacking
the type of education offered by
such institutions as Stanford, are
unable to appreciate those same
fredoms whose protection Miss
Chenery believes are so vital?

Neither the letter of Mr. Gur

leaves any room for the solution
of serious international conflicts
outside of violence or the threat
of violence ( historically the latter
has had a disturbing tendency to

university should be a community
constantly attempting to examine
the values of society from a uni
quely advantageous position.
When military attitudes are al
lowed to pervade this atmosphere,
the examination of values is ob
viously prejudiced as these two
letters indicate by their un
examined acceptance of violence.
Fortunately, some work is now
being done by psychologists and
political scientists in the investi
gation of non-violent alternatives
to war, but this has had little
publicity. I suspect that this is
largely due to the prevalence of
militaristic assumptions in o u r

AN ARKANSAN REPLIES
Editor, The Daily:
The remarks in the "Alabama
Replies" letter in Friday's Daily
are fairly typical of Southern
"moderates." 1 too, used to think
that outsiders, such as the Free
dom Riders, were only creating
unnecessary discord, which was
harmful to the cause. But I have
come to realize that this position
is not correct. The fact is that
most Southern States will do
nothing about the existing racial
segregation unless forced to,
either by insiders or outsiders.
The state and local governments
and their police forces, as we
have seen, are sympathetic to the
segregationist stand, and are sup
ported by a large body of South
ern whites. The Southern moder
ates, such as Mary D. Mahathy,
are acquiescent; the few South
ern liberals are greatly overpow
ered. Help for the Negro must
come from the outside, if we are
to right this situation, at least
according to Federal law, in the
not-too-distant future. The situa
tion, as created by the Souther
nors, calLs for outside interven
tion in order that the existing
state of affairs may be forced
into national recognition, so that
it can be remedied by the Federal
Government, backed (as has been
proven necessary) by Federal
troops.
I personally feel that it is un
fortunate that such measures are
necessary, but anything less will
come to no avail. The Southern
States (they are the most blatant,
but let us remember that states
in other parts of the U.S. are not
to be excluded) have kept the
Negro from exercising his rights

long enough; the time has come j
for action leading to positive re-;
suits. Granted, such action will
lead to civil strife and racial un
rest, at least as an intermediate
step; but such'is caused by the
Southern "rednecks," backed by
their police forces (many of
whom are "rednecks" them
selves i, in active resistance to
those who merely seek what they
are entitled to under law. The
Southern moderates have demon
strated in the past that they will
take no active part in ihe prob
lem unless strongly forced to by
others. The "Aaron Henry Pro
gram," carried on with the help
of Yale, Stanford, and other "out
siders," is just such an action
which will lead, eventually, to
positive results. The Southern
States leave us no choice; Ameri
cans must act now to remove
this stigma, entangled as it is
within the state laws, from our
society.

ADMINISTRATION
Editor, The Daily:
Two present situations reflect
poorly on the strength of Stan
ford's administration:
1) On Registration Day this
year, the Stanford Administration
banned the sale by solicitation of
the Campus Voice from Univer
sity property. The Voice had ap
parently not applied for permis
sion to distribute its copy, thus
i violating an administrative regu
lation. There may have been other
factors influencing this decision.
At any rate, today the Voice is
still being sold on Stanford prop
erty in the prohibited solicitation
manner.
21 The Fundamental Standard!
has become a well-known part of
Stanford's tradition. In recom
mending the Standard to the Uni
versity's students, the adminis
tration shows clear approval of
it. While compliance with the
Standard is the decision of the in
dividual Stanford student., with
whom alone it is concerned, the!
administration should not fail to ;
encourage actively the observance '
of this Standard, as it has recom
j mended. Yet when representa
| tives of University authority fail
to comment on clear and open vio-
I lations of the Standard (namely,
| those involving the state law
against minors' possessing intoxi
cating beverages), it would seem
that the administration is qual
ifying, at least by default, its sup
posed complete support of t he j
Standard. The students should be \
the primary defenders of the!
Standard. And, if necessary, the!
police must be the enforcers of !
the laws for which the Standard!
affirms a respect. But this does j
not remove the administration;
from its obligation to express dis
approval of violations of the
Standard. This, however is ap
parently the case.
In both these instances, the ad
ministration has failed to support
actively its professed policies and
beliefs. If observance of Univer
sity regulations in (1) is not even
going to be enforced and in (2)
is hardly going to be encouraged,
the administration ought to offer |
some justification to the student
body. If it doesn't, then, by de
fault, it admits that it lacks the
moral courage and conviction to
uphold its own decisions and atti
tudes.

LASSU CHARTERS
Editor, The Daily:
According to last Friday's
Daily, "Ed Shaw, Student Finan
cial Manager, called for and se
cured a resolution to the effect
that LASSU would accept respon
sibility for future plane flights by
creating an organization that
would serve as a veritable clear-j
inghouse for such flights if the
administration consents . . . The
necessity to protect students from
such situations (as the one last
spring) was given as the ration-1
ale for the formation of this or
ganization."
I think that this is not only a
wrong approach to the problem j
of unscrupulous travel agencies, j
but a harmful one as well.
It is wrong in that it is totally
defensive in nature. It does
nothing to eliminate the problem.
I think a more constructive reso
lution would have been one favor
ing a recent proposal to the Cali
fornia legislature which would re
quire all travel agents to be
bonded. If made a law, this would
mean that all licensed travel
agents would necessarily be fi
nancially solvent.
More important to me, how
ever, is the dangerous assumption
behind this resolution. Financial
Manager Shaw stated it well in a
letter to Dean Winbigler (part of
which was mimeographed and
distributed to LASSU reps) in
which he said "there is a definite
moral obligation involved" for
Stanford to protect its students in
this particular instance. I agree
that there is a moral obligation !
involved. It is not to protect the j
students, however, but to help |
them realize that they must be 1
responsible for their own actions, i
That is to say. one of the duties
of this university is to teach its I
students to take care of them-1
selves, for they will eventually !
have to leave Stanford's benevo-1
lent paternalism for a society j
which demands self-sufficiency.

ROTC
Editor, Tiic Daily:
In response to Holly Chenery's
letter re ROTC in the Daily of
October 25, we would like to men
tion two small points which she
has apparently overlooked.
1) Freedom h a s historically
been obtained by the people only
through sacrifice, oflen of a physi
cal nature, and once won it has
had to be protected from those
who would deprive the people of
this freedom. Those nations
which have proved unwilling or
unable to defend themselves no
longer have their freedom. Who
finally stopped Hitler—those stu
dents in Britain who, in the 1930'5,
signed the Oxford Oath, pledging
"never to fight for King and
Country?"
2) Given the fact that present
international conditions require
the maintenance of a national de
fense force, it is better to abolish
ROTC and entrust the command
responsibilities within this de
fense force to those who, lacking
the type of education offered by
such institutions as Stanford, are
unable to appreciate those same
fredoms whose protection Miss
Chenery believes are so vital?

Editor, Tlu> Daily:
The letters of Messrs. Gurney
and Compton concerning (he ques
tion of military training on a uni
versity campus unintentionally
emphasize some of the more co
gent arguments against such
training. Both letters reveal a
a fatalistic acceptance of the use
of force and violence in the solu
tion of international conflict. In
a rather absurd analogy Mr. Gur
ney equates war (generally
agreed to be caused by men) and
disease (supposedly caused by
germs, although with the devel
opment of biological warfare man
appears to be making an attempt
in this field on his own). Doctors
work to eliminate disease, and re
sponsible leaders should be work
ing to do away with war instead
of accepting it. War and violence
CANNOT be eliminated "just by
not thinking about them," nor can
they be eliminated by their un
considered acceptance as a means
of conflict resolution.
With a withering blow in the
name of "realism" Mr. Compton
notes that the "history of 'civili
zation' has been continually linked
with organized killing of individ
uals." It would seem that the re

Replies" letter in Friday's Daily
are fairly typical of Southern
"moderates." 1 too, used to think
that outsiders, such as the Free
dom Riders, were only creating
unnecessary discord, which was
harmful to the cause. But I have
come to realize that this position
is not correct. The fact is that
most Southern States will do
nothing about the existing racial
segregation unless forced to,
either by insiders or outsiders.
The state and local governments
and their police forces, as we
have seen, are sympathetic to the
segregationist stand, and are sup
ported by a large body of South
ern whites. The Southern moder
ates, such as Mary D. Mahathy,
are acquiescent; the few South
ern liberals are greatly overpow
ered. Help for the Negro must
come from the outside, if we are
to right this situation, at least
according to Federal law, in the
not-too-distant future. The situa
tion, as created by the Souther
nors, calLs for outside interven
tion in order that the existing
state of affairs may be forced
into national recognition, so that
it can be remedied by the Federal
Government, backed (as has been
proven necessary) by Federal
troops.
I personally feel that it is un
fortunate that such measures are
necessary, but anything less will
come to no avail. The Southern
States (they are the most blatant,
but let us remember that states
in other parts of the U.S. are not
to be excluded) have kept the
Negro from exercising his rights

long enough; the time has come j
for action leading to positive re-;
suits. Granted, such action will
lead to civil strife and racial un
rest, at least as an intermediate
step; but such'is caused by the
Southern "rednecks," backed by
their police forces (many of
whom are "rednecks" them
selves i, in active resistance to
those who merely seek what they
are entitled to under law. The
Southern moderates have demon
strated in the past that they will
take no active part in ihe prob
lem unless strongly forced to by
others. The "Aaron Henry Pro
gram," carried on with the help
of Yale, Stanford, and other "out
siders," is just such an action
which will lead, eventually, to
positive results. The Southern
States leave us no choice; Ameri
cans must act now to remove
this stigma, entangled as it is
within the state laws, from our
society.

ADMINISTRATION
Editor, The Daily:
Two present situations reflect
poorly on the strength of Stan
ford's administration:
1) On Registration Day this
year, the Stanford Administration
banned the sale by solicitation of
the Campus Voice from Univer
sity property. The Voice had ap
parently not applied for permis
sion to distribute its copy, thus
i violating an administrative regu
lation. There may have been other
factors influencing this decision.
At any rate, today the Voice is
still being sold on Stanford prop
erty in the prohibited solicitation
manner.
21 The Fundamental Standard!
has become a well-known part of
Stanford's tradition. In recom
mending the Standard to the Uni
versity's students, the adminis
tration shows clear approval of
it. While compliance with the
Standard is the decision of the in
dividual Stanford student., with
whom alone it is concerned, the!
administration should not fail to ;
encourage actively the observance '
of this Standard, as it has recom
j mended. Yet when representa
| tives of University authority fail
to comment on clear and open vio-
I lations of the Standard (namely,
| those involving the state law
against minors' possessing intoxi
cating beverages), it would seem
that the administration is qual
ifying, at least by default, its sup
posed complete support of t he j
Standard. The students should be \
the primary defenders of the!
Standard. And, if necessary, the!
police must be the enforcers of !
the laws for which the Standard!
affirms a respect. But this does j
not remove the administration;
from its obligation to express dis
approval of violations of the
Standard. This, however is ap
parently the case.
In both these instances, the ad
ministration has failed to support
actively its professed policies and
beliefs. If observance of Univer
sity regulations in (1) is not even
going to be enforced and in (2)
is hardly going to be encouraged,
the administration ought to offer |
some justification to the student
body. If it doesn't, then, by de
fault, it admits that it lacks the
moral courage and conviction to
uphold its own decisions and atti
tudes.

LASSU CHARTERS
Editor, The Daily:
According to last Friday's
Daily, "Ed Shaw, Student Finan
cial Manager, called for and se
cured a resolution to the effect
that LASSU would accept respon
sibility for future plane flights by
creating an organization that
would serve as a veritable clear-j
inghouse for such flights if the
administration consents . . . The
necessity to protect students from
such situations (as the one last
spring) was given as the ration-1
ale for the formation of this or
ganization."
I think that this is not only a
wrong approach to the problem j
of unscrupulous travel agencies, j
but a harmful one as well.
It is wrong in that it is totally
defensive in nature. It does
nothing to eliminate the problem.
I think a more constructive reso
lution would have been one favor
ing a recent proposal to the Cali
fornia legislature which would re
quire all travel agents to be
bonded. If made a law, this would
mean that all licensed travel
agents would necessarily be fi
nancially solvent.
More important to me, how
ever, is the dangerous assumption
behind this resolution. Financial
Manager Shaw stated it well in a
letter to Dean Winbigler (part of
which was mimeographed and
distributed to LASSU reps) in
which he said "there is a definite
moral obligation involved" for
Stanford to protect its students in
this particular instance. I agree
that there is a moral obligation !
involved. It is not to protect the j
students, however, but to help |
them realize that they must be 1
responsible for their own actions, i
That is to say. one of the duties
of this university is to teach its I
students to take care of them-1
selves, for they will eventually !
have to leave Stanford's benevo-1
lent paternalism for a society j
which demands self-sufficiency.

ROTC
Editor, Tiic Daily:
In response to Holly Chenery's
letter re ROTC in the Daily of
October 25, we would like to men
tion two small points which she
has apparently overlooked.
1) Freedom h a s historically
been obtained by the people only
through sacrifice, oflen of a physi
cal nature, and once won it has
had to be protected from those
who would deprive the people of
this freedom. Those nations
which have proved unwilling or
unable to defend themselves no
longer have their freedom. Who
finally stopped Hitler—those stu
dents in Britain who, in the 1930'5,
signed the Oxford Oath, pledging
"never to fight for King and
Country?"
2) Given the fact that present
international conditions require
the maintenance of a national de
fense force, it is better to abolish
ROTC and entrust the command
responsibilities within this de
fense force to those who, lacking
the type of education offered by
such institutions as Stanford, are
unable to appreciate those same
fredoms whose protection Miss
Chenery believes are so vital?

Editor, Tlu> Daily:
The letters of Messrs. Gurney
and Compton concerning (he ques
tion of military training on a uni
versity campus unintentionally
emphasize some of the more co
gent arguments against such
training. Both letters reveal a
a fatalistic acceptance of the use
of force and violence in the solu
tion of international conflict. In
a rather absurd analogy Mr. Gur
ney equates war (generally
agreed to be caused by men) and
disease (supposedly caused by
germs, although with the devel
opment of biological warfare man
appears to be making an attempt
in this field on his own). Doctors
work to eliminate disease, and re
sponsible leaders should be work
ing to do away with war instead
of accepting it. War and violence
CANNOT be eliminated "just by
not thinking about them," nor can
they be eliminated by their un
considered acceptance as a means
of conflict resolution.
With a withering blow in the
name of "realism" Mr. Compton
notes that the "history of 'civili
zation' has been continually linked
with organized killing of individ
uals." It would seem that the re
sults of this practice in the past
and our present potential for
mass murder make it impertive
that we find some alternative to
this insanity. How can it be real
ism to accept it?
Neither the letter of Mr. Gur
ney nor that of Mr. Compton
leaves any room for the solution
of serious international conflicts
outside of violence or the threat
of violence ( historically the latter
has had a disturbing tendency to
become the former). Ideally a
university should be a community
constantly attempting to examine
the values of society from a uni
quely advantageous position.
When military attitudes are al
lowed to pervade this atmosphere,
the examination of values is ob
viously prejudiced as these two
letters indicate by their un
examined acceptance of violence.
Fortunately, some work is now
being done by psychologists and
political scientists in the investi
gation of non-violent alternatives
to war, but this has had little
publicity. I suspect that this is
largely due to the prevalence of
militaristic assumptions in o u r
society, none of which is amelio
rated by the presence of military
training at institutions of learn
ing.

proven necessary) by Federal
troops.
I personally feel that it is un
fortunate that such measures are
necessary, but anything less will
come to no avail. The Southern
States (they are the most blatant,
but let us remember that states
in other parts of the U.S. are not
to be excluded) have kept the
Negro from exercising his rights

long enough; the time has come j
for action leading to positive re-;
suits. Granted, such action will
lead to civil strife and racial un
rest, at least as an intermediate
step; but such'is caused by the
Southern "rednecks," backed by
their police forces (many of
whom are "rednecks" them
selves i, in active resistance to
those who merely seek what they
are entitled to under law. The
Southern moderates have demon
strated in the past that they will
take no active part in ihe prob
lem unless strongly forced to by
others. The "Aaron Henry Pro
gram," carried on with the help
of Yale, Stanford, and other "out
siders," is just such an action
which will lead, eventually, to
positive results. The Southern
States leave us no choice; Ameri
cans must act now to remove
this stigma, entangled as it is
within the state laws, from our
society.

ADMINISTRATION
Editor, The Daily:
Two present situations reflect
poorly on the strength of Stan
ford's administration:
1) On Registration Day this
year, the Stanford Administration
banned the sale by solicitation of
the Campus Voice from Univer
sity property. The Voice had ap
parently not applied for permis
sion to distribute its copy, thus
i violating an administrative regu
lation. There may have been other
factors influencing this decision.
At any rate, today the Voice is
still being sold on Stanford prop
erty in the prohibited solicitation
manner.
21 The Fundamental Standard!
has become a well-known part of
Stanford's tradition. In recom
mending the Standard to the Uni
versity's students, the adminis
tration shows clear approval of
it. While compliance with the
Standard is the decision of the in
dividual Stanford student., with
whom alone it is concerned, the!
administration should not fail to ;
encourage actively the observance '
of this Standard, as it has recom
j mended. Yet when representa
| tives of University authority fail
to comment on clear and open vio-
I lations of the Standard (namely,
| those involving the state law
against minors' possessing intoxi
cating beverages), it would seem
that the administration is qual
ifying, at least by default, its sup
posed complete support of t he j
Standard. The students should be \
the primary defenders of the!
Standard. And, if necessary, the!
police must be the enforcers of !
the laws for which the Standard!
affirms a respect. But this does j
not remove the administration;
from its obligation to express dis
approval of violations of the
Standard. This, however is ap
parently the case.
In both these instances, the ad
ministration has failed to support
actively its professed policies and
beliefs. If observance of Univer
sity regulations in (1) is not even
going to be enforced and in (2)
is hardly going to be encouraged,
the administration ought to offer |
some justification to the student
body. If it doesn't, then, by de
fault, it admits that it lacks the
moral courage and conviction to
uphold its own decisions and atti
tudes.

LASSU CHARTERS
Editor, The Daily:
According to last Friday's
Daily, "Ed Shaw, Student Finan
cial Manager, called for and se
cured a resolution to the effect
that LASSU would accept respon
sibility for future plane flights by
creating an organization that
would serve as a veritable clear-j
inghouse for such flights if the
administration consents . . . The
necessity to protect students from
such situations (as the one last
spring) was given as the ration-1
ale for the formation of this or
ganization."
I think that this is not only a
wrong approach to the problem j
of unscrupulous travel agencies, j
but a harmful one as well.
It is wrong in that it is totally
defensive in nature. It does
nothing to eliminate the problem.
I think a more constructive reso
lution would have been one favor
ing a recent proposal to the Cali
fornia legislature which would re
quire all travel agents to be
bonded. If made a law, this would
mean that all licensed travel
agents would necessarily be fi
nancially solvent.
More important to me, how
ever, is the dangerous assumption
behind this resolution. Financial
Manager Shaw stated it well in a
letter to Dean Winbigler (part of
which was mimeographed and
distributed to LASSU reps) in
which he said "there is a definite
moral obligation involved" for
Stanford to protect its students in
this particular instance. I agree
that there is a moral obligation !
involved. It is not to protect the j
students, however, but to help |
them realize that they must be 1
responsible for their own actions, i
That is to say. one of the duties
of this university is to teach its I
students to take care of them-1
selves, for they will eventually !
have to leave Stanford's benevo-1
lent paternalism for a society j
which demands self-sufficiency.

ROTC
Editor, Tiic Daily:
In response to Holly Chenery's
letter re ROTC in the Daily of
October 25, we would like to men
tion two small points which she
has apparently overlooked.
1) Freedom h a s historically
been obtained by the people only
through sacrifice, oflen of a physi
cal nature, and once won it has
had to be protected from those
who would deprive the people of
this freedom. Those nations
which have proved unwilling or
unable to defend themselves no
longer have their freedom. Who
finally stopped Hitler—those stu
dents in Britain who, in the 1930'5,
signed the Oxford Oath, pledging
"never to fight for King and
Country?"
2) Given the fact that present
international conditions require
the maintenance of a national de
fense force, it is better to abolish
ROTC and entrust the command
responsibilities within this de
fense force to those who, lacking
the type of education offered by
such institutions as Stanford, are
unable to appreciate those same
fredoms whose protection Miss
Chenery believes are so vital?

Editor, Tlu> Daily:
The letters of Messrs. Gurney
and Compton concerning (he ques
tion of military training on a uni
versity campus unintentionally
emphasize some of the more co
gent arguments against such
training. Both letters reveal a
a fatalistic acceptance of the use
of force and violence in the solu
tion of international conflict. In
a rather absurd analogy Mr. Gur
ney equates war (generally
agreed to be caused by men) and
disease (supposedly caused by
germs, although with the devel
opment of biological warfare man
appears to be making an attempt
in this field on his own). Doctors
work to eliminate disease, and re
sponsible leaders should be work
ing to do away with war instead
of accepting it. War and violence
CANNOT be eliminated "just by
not thinking about them," nor can
they be eliminated by their un
considered acceptance as a means
of conflict resolution.
With a withering blow in the
name of "realism" Mr. Compton
notes that the "history of 'civili
zation' has been continually linked
with organized killing of individ
uals." It would seem that the re
sults of this practice in the past
and our present potential for
mass murder make it impertive
that we find some alternative to
this insanity. How can it be real
ism to accept it?
Neither the letter of Mr. Gur
ney nor that of Mr. Compton
leaves any room for the solution
of serious international conflicts
outside of violence or the threat
of violence ( historically the latter
has had a disturbing tendency to
become the former). Ideally a
university should be a community
constantly attempting to examine
the values of society from a uni
quely advantageous position.
When military attitudes are al
lowed to pervade this atmosphere,
the examination of values is ob
viously prejudiced as these two
letters indicate by their un
examined acceptance of violence.
Fortunately, some work is now
being done by psychologists and
political scientists in the investi
gation of non-violent alternatives
to war, but this has had little
publicity. I suspect that this is
largely due to the prevalence of
militaristic assumptions in o u r
society, none of which is amelio
rated by the presence of military
training at institutions of learn
ing.

AN ARKANSAN REPLIES
Editor, The Daily:
The remarks in the "Alabama
Replies" letter in Friday's Daily
are fairly typical of Southern
"moderates." 1 too, used to think
that outsiders, such as the Free
dom Riders, were only creating
unnecessary discord, which was
harmful to the cause. But I have
come to realize that this position
is not correct. The fact is that
most Southern States will do
nothing about the existing racial
segregation unless forced to,
either by insiders or outsiders.
The state and local governments
and their police forces, as we
have seen, are sympathetic to the
segregationist stand, and are sup
ported by a large body of South
ern whites. The Southern moder
ates, such as Mary D. Mahathy,
are acquiescent; the few South
ern liberals are greatly overpow
ered. Help for the Negro must
come from the outside, if we are
to right this situation, at least
according to Federal law, in the
not-too-distant future. The situa
tion, as created by the Souther

this stigma, entangled as it is

ADMINISTRATION
Editor, The Daily:
Two present situations reflect
poorly on the strength of Stan
ford's administration:
1) On Registration Day this
year, the Stanford Administration
banned the sale by solicitation of
the Campus Voice from Univer
sity property. The Voice had ap
parently not applied for permis
sion to distribute its copy, thus
i violating an administrative regu
lation. There may have been other
factors influencing this decision.
At any rate, today the Voice is
still being sold on Stanford prop
erty in the prohibited solicitation
manner.
21 The Fundamental Standard!
has become a well-known part of
Stanford's tradition. In recom
mending the Standard to the Uni
versity's students, the adminis
tration shows clear approval of
it. While compliance with the
Standard is the decision of the in
dividual Stanford student., with
whom alone it is concerned, the!
administration should not fail to ;
encourage actively the observance '
of this Standard, as it has recom
j mended. Yet when representa
| tives of University authority fail
to comment on clear and open vio-
I lations of the Standard (namely,
| those involving the state law
against minors' possessing intoxi
cating beverages), it would seem
that the administration is qual
ifying, at least by default, its sup
posed complete support of t he j
Standard. The students should be \
the primary defenders of the!
Standard. And, if necessary, the!
police must be the enforcers of !
the laws for which the Standard!
affirms a respect. But this does j
not remove the administration;
from its obligation to express dis
approval of violations of the
Standard. This, however is ap
parently the case.
In both these instances, the ad
ministration has failed to support
actively its professed policies and
beliefs. If observance of Univer
sity regulations in (1) is not even
going to be enforced and in (2)
is hardly going to be encouraged,
the administration ought to offer |
some justification to the student
body. If it doesn't, then, by de
fault, it admits that it lacks the
moral courage and conviction to
uphold its own decisions and atti
tudes.

LASSU CHARTERS
Editor, The Daily:
According to last Friday's
Daily, "Ed Shaw, Student Finan
cial Manager, called for and se
cured a resolution to the effect
that LASSU would accept respon
sibility for future plane flights by
creating an organization that
would serve as a veritable clear-j
inghouse for such flights if the
administration consents . . . The
necessity to protect students from
such situations (as the one last
spring) was given as the ration-1
ale for the formation of this or
ganization."
I think that this is not only a
wrong approach to the problem j
of unscrupulous travel agencies, j
but a harmful one as well.
It is wrong in that it is totally
defensive in nature. It does
nothing to eliminate the problem.
I think a more constructive reso
lution would have been one favor
ing a recent proposal to the Cali
fornia legislature which would re
quire all travel agents to be
bonded. If made a law, this would
mean that all licensed travel
agents would necessarily be fi
nancially solvent.
More important to me, how
ever, is the dangerous assumption
behind this resolution. Financial
Manager Shaw stated it well in a
letter to Dean Winbigler (part of
which was mimeographed and
distributed to LASSU reps) in
which he said "there is a definite
moral obligation involved" for
Stanford to protect its students in
this particular instance. I agree
that there is a moral obligation !
involved. It is not to protect the j
students, however, but to help |
them realize that they must be 1
responsible for their own actions, i
That is to say. one of the duties
of this university is to teach its I
students to take care of them-1
selves, for they will eventually !
have to leave Stanford's benevo-1
lent paternalism for a society j
which demands self-sufficiency.

ROTC
Editor, Tiic Daily:
In response to Holly Chenery's
letter re ROTC in the Daily of
October 25, we would like to men
tion two small points which she
has apparently overlooked.
1) Freedom h a s historically
been obtained by the people only
through sacrifice, oflen of a physi
cal nature, and once won it has
had to be protected from those
who would deprive the people of
this freedom. Those nations
which have proved unwilling or
unable to defend themselves no
longer have their freedom. Who
finally stopped Hitler—those stu
dents in Britain who, in the 1930'5,
signed the Oxford Oath, pledging
"never to fight for King and
Country?"
2) Given the fact that present
international conditions require
the maintenance of a national de
fense force, it is better to abolish
ROTC and entrust the command
responsibilities within this de
fense force to those who, lacking
the type of education offered by
such institutions as Stanford, are
unable to appreciate those same
fredoms whose protection Miss
Chenery believes are so vital?

—F. GRAHAM McSWINEY
Editor, Tlu> Daily:
The letters of Messrs. Gurney
and Compton concerning (he ques
tion of military training on a uni
versity campus unintentionally
emphasize some of the more co
gent arguments against such
training. Both letters reveal a
a fatalistic acceptance of the use
of force and violence in the solu
tion of international conflict. In
a rather absurd analogy Mr. Gur
ney equates war (generally
agreed to be caused by men) and
disease (supposedly caused by
germs, although with the devel
opment of biological warfare man
appears to be making an attempt
in this field on his own). Doctors
work to eliminate disease, and re
sponsible leaders should be work
ing to do away with war instead
of accepting it. War and violence
CANNOT be eliminated "just by
not thinking about them," nor can
they be eliminated by their un
considered acceptance as a means
of conflict resolution.
With a withering blow in the
name of "realism" Mr. Compton
notes that the "history of 'civili
zation' has been continually linked
with organized killing of individ
uals." It would seem that the re
sults of this practice in the past
and our present potential for
mass murder make it impertive
that we find some alternative to
this insanity. How can it be real
ism to accept it?
Neither the letter of Mr. Gur
ney nor that of Mr. Compton
leaves any room for the solution
of serious international conflicts
outside of violence or the threat
of violence ( historically the latter
has had a disturbing tendency to
become the former). Ideally a
university should be a community
constantly attempting to examine
the values of society from a uni
quely advantageous position.
When military attitudes are al
lowed to pervade this atmosphere,
the examination of values is ob
viously prejudiced as these two
letters indicate by their un
examined acceptance of violence.
Fortunately, some work is now
being done by psychologists and
political scientists in the investi
gation of non-violent alternatives
to war, but this has had little
publicity. I suspect that this is
largely due to the prevalence of
militaristic assumptions in o u r
society, none of which is amelio
rated by the presence of military
training at institutions of learn
ing.

AN ARKANSAN REPLIES
Editor, The Daily:
The remarks in the "Alabama
Replies" letter in Friday's Daily
are fairly typical of Southern
"moderates." 1 too, used to think
that outsiders, such as the Free
dom Riders, were only creating
unnecessary discord, which was
harmful to the cause. But I have
come to realize that this position
is not correct. The fact is that
most Southern States will do
nothing about the existing racial
segregation unless forced to,
either by insiders or outsiders.
The state and local governments
and their police forces, as we
have seen, are sympathetic to the
segregationist stand, and are sup
ported by a large body of South
ern whites. The Southern moder
ates, such as Mary D. Mahathy,
are acquiescent; the few South
ern liberals are greatly overpow
ered. Help for the Negro must
come from the outside, if we are
to right this situation, at least
according to Federal law, in the
not-too-distant future. The situa
tion, as created by the Souther
nors, calLs for outside interven
tion in order that the existing
state of affairs may be forced
into national recognition, so that
it can be remedied by the Federal
Government, backed (as has been
proven necessary) by Federal
troops.
I personally feel that it is un
fortunate that such measures are
necessary, but anything less will
come to no avail. The Southern
States (they are the most blatant,
but let us remember that states
in other parts of the U.S. are not
to be excluded) have kept the
Negro from exercising his rights

long enough; the time has come j
for action leading to positive re-;
suits. Granted, such action will
lead to civil strife and racial un
rest, at least as an intermediate
step; but such'is caused by the
Southern "rednecks," backed by
their police forces (many of
whom are "rednecks" them
selves i, in active resistance to
those who merely seek what they
are entitled to under law. The
Southern moderates have demon
strated in the past that they will
take no active part in ihe prob
lem unless strongly forced to by
others. The "Aaron Henry Pro
gram," carried on with the help
of Yale, Stanford, and other "out
siders," is just such an action
which will lead, eventually, to
positive results. The Southern
States leave us no choice; Ameri
cans must act now to remove
this stigma, entangled as it is
within the state laws, from our
society.
