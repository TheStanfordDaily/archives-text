# 'Right Hypocritical, Left Unethical, But Miss' Worse'
## 
### MIKE WAGGONER Associate Editor 
The letters in Tuesday's Daily
by De Wolf, Hennion, and Young
are the sort of nit-picking that
tends to discredit the conservative
movement. By harping on the
minor, though relevant, and ex
agerating the absurd, and irrele
vant, the arguments presented
but obscure the basic issue:
In Mississippi the Negro popu
lation has an economic status one
third that of whites and an edu
cational level one-half that of
whites, and the perpetuation of
these and other evils rests largely
on denial to the Negro of the
fundamental right of voting.
Elimination of these evils must
of course be weighed against the
evils that could arise in their
solution, but it is hard to doubt
that the former evil is far greater
than the second. Those who do
doubt should quickly resolve their
doubts into questions, pose these
questions, and decide.
THE CONSERVATIVE action
leads one to accuse them of hypoc
ricy. They claim to believe in
liberty, and oppose most Federal
civil l ights action on the ground
that the Federal intervention is
a cure more dangerous than the
disease.
Yet, here there is no Federal
intervention, and still the con
servatives oppose. Here private
enterprise works for justice, but
the conservatives sit on their
hands. "Here," said a conserva
tive who asked his name not be
used as I was quoting him out

of context, "wo just can't get ex
cited."
If tho conservatives oppose Fed
eral intervention, they would do
better to act to make it unneces
sary. Until that happens, and de
spite their own beliefs to the con
trary, conservatives are unlikely
to lose their aura of bigotry,
wealth-hoarding, and insensitivity.
THK LIBERALS of this cam
paign merit similar though mild
er criticism. The Daily has pre
sented reports of enthusiam ex
ceeding that existing, but ex
ceeded by that presented by speak
ers at rallies.
Above all there is Lowenstein,
an intelligent man of the best in
tentions, but a man so long a
reformer that he can no longer
appreciate the human fear and
ignorance of the bigots, a man
who threatens further racial
strife even if Negro victory by
statements like, "Nobody knows
better than the Negro who has
been hitting him over the head."
YES, THK NKGRO knows who,
but, even more poor and be
nighted than the whites who now
oppress him. he probably doesn't
know why. Unless he is told be
fore he wins, even if this means
he wins later, he may just hit
heads in turn. And fear in the
whites is likely to delay any kind
of victory. Such was Algeria.
Prolonged and cyclical racial
strife would be horrible, but it
is only a possibility. It must be
rated less than the present real
ity. Many liberal campaign tac
tics are unethical and illegal,
but Mississippi is worse.

know why. Unless he is told be
fore he wins, even if this means
he wins later, he may just hit
heads in turn. And fear in the
whites is likely to delay any kind
of victory. Such was Algeria.
Prolonged and cyclical racial
strife would be horrible, but it
is only a possibility. It must be
rated less than the present real
ity. Many liberal campaign tac
tics are unethical and illegal,
but Mississippi is worse.
The letters in Tuesday's Daily
by De Wolf, Hennion, and Young
are the sort of nit-picking that
tends to discredit the conservative
movement. By harping on the
minor, though relevant, and ex
agerating the absurd, and irrele
vant, the arguments presented
but obscure the basic issue:
In Mississippi the Negro popu
lation has an economic status one
third that of whites and an edu
cational level one-half that of
whites, and the perpetuation of
these and other evils rests largely
on denial to the Negro of the
fundamental right of voting.
Elimination of these evils must
of course be weighed against the
evils that could arise in their
solution, but it is hard to doubt
that the former evil is far greater
than the second. Those who do
doubt should quickly resolve their
doubts into questions, pose these
questions, and decide.
THE CONSERVATIVE action
leads one to accuse them of hypoc
ricy. They claim to believe in
liberty, and oppose most Federal
civil l ights action on the ground
that the Federal intervention is
a cure more dangerous than the
disease.
Yet, here there is no Federal
intervention, and still the con
servatives oppose. Here private
enterprise works for justice, but
the conservatives sit on their
hands. "Here," said a conserva
tive who asked his name not be
used as I was quoting him out

of context, "wo just can't get ex
cited."
If tho conservatives oppose Fed
eral intervention, they would do
better to act to make it unneces
sary. Until that happens, and de
spite their own beliefs to the con
trary, conservatives are unlikely
to lose their aura of bigotry,
wealth-hoarding, and insensitivity.
