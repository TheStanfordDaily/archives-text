STUDENTS IN MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
Yup! It's just like them smart
college folks says, alright: ain't
gonna be hardly no nigras votin'
in Miss'ippi this year. O 'course,
very few white folks gonna vote
neither. Them people just don't
consider votin' important, I guess.
We 'uns hyar in Loosianny think
o' miss'ippi as "backward," if you
know what ah mean: folks ain't
got no cash money, no edjeeca
shun, no idee o' what's goin' on
in th' "outside world." An' any
time some young feller goes off
t' college, wel, like as not he don't
come back to Miss'ippi no more.
Now. in them circumstances, you
got what ah calls a "dis-aster
area."
Ain't jest the nigras that got
problems in Miss'ippi. Ev'ybody's
got 'em. What them folks up thar
needs is leedership; some sharp
young 'uns from th' outside to
move in, set a while, pine th' leg
islature and gets things done.
O'course, Miss'ippi's sech a un
commonly bleak place t' live in,
no 'un sets: they jest ageetates
and gits. Seems t' me that any
one from th' outside who really
got ants in 'is britches about how
things is run in Miss'ippi would
stay aroun' long enough to do
somethin' 'bout it, 'stead of 'jes
gittin' nigras t' sign pieces uv
paper. That ain't gonna get the
horse no hay.
But then, ya cain't tell 'bout
them Yankee college kids. Seems
like they's always movin'. hyar
t' day, gone tomorree. Sorta like
the Carpetbaggers, ah guess.
Come down t' fleece yuh, and
then off som'ere's else to fatter
diggin's. It's a shame none of 'em
care to set a while. But, ah s'pose
if yuh got a edjeecashun, you
gotta fleece people rather'n help
'em.

SPONSORS IN MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to answer the
letter of Messrs. Hennion and
Young in Wednesday's Daily,
which questions the validity of
the actions of the two Wilbur
sponsors who left for Mississippi
this week.
I, for one, laud and admire the

two sponsors for leaving their re
sponsibilities at Stanford to
assume what they considered
greater responsibilities in Missis
sippi. I further feel that they are
setting commendable examples of
unapathetic Stanford life by an
swering the challenge with direct
action rather than with suppres
sion of their personal convictions.
Their "impressionable" freshman
charges will, I believe, be more
impressed by this action than
they would have been if the spon
sors had stayed here to "perform
their own duties."
In addition, I feel that the lead
ership qualities for which they
were chosen as Wilbur sponsors
should make them especially ef
fective in their demanding tasks
in Mississippi.
These two sponsors, thc n,
should not he criticized; rather,
they should be praised.

NOTRE DAME GAME
Editor, The Daily:
Congradulations, Doug Moir on
your handling of the Notre Dame
game! You did an excellent job!
I only hope that you proved to
yourself (as you did to me an d
many other Stanford students)
that it is possible to conduct taste
ful, highly satisfactory cheers
that pertain first, last and always
to the football game in progress
and with our team's effort to win
that game. Please do not lapse
back into old habits now that you
have successfully rid yourself of
them. Your new techniques of
operation did not go unnoticed
nor were they in vain, as you
most of all should realize.
—BILL CHANDLER
Editor, The Daily:
Everything about Saturday's
Notre Dame game football fes
tivities was exciting! I feel the
necessity to momment on one
thing, especially. I would like to
compliment the Stanford band
and the music director on th e
most thrilling presentation of the
national anthem. Everyone was
commenting about it and it
seemed worth at least one letter.
