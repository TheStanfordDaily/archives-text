TENNIS IN Till] FAMILY
The product of a tennis-mad family, Julie has been playing for
more than ten years. Her father was a National Juniors champion
and her mother, while not an outstanding player, is the editor and
publisher of the Bible of tennis, World Tennis magazine.

Between high school years spent at Dalton
School, a Manhatten girls' day school, Julie spent
some summers at a lennis camp in Hamtramck,
Mich, sharpening her game. Julie won her first
major tournament when only 12 years old, the
Canadian Juniors in 1956. She repeated this win
in each of the next two years, and won the U.S.
15 and under the next season.
Since that triumph, in addition to being the
current National Junior champion, Julie has won
three clay courts crowns the 1962 Southern
Women's, the 1962 Tennessee Valley Invitational
and the Tri-State tournament in Cincinatti.

Janie, on the other hand, comes from a football family with deep
roots at Stanford. Her father, Frank, was the great quarterback
who enabled Clark Shaugnessy to introduce the T formation on the

| Farm in the early '40's, and more recently coached
the San Francisco '49ers to their best season ever.
Since she obviously could not play football,
Janie began to play tennis when she was about
11 years old. A very successful player, Jane has
won the California women's singles and doubles
crowns, the Middle States Women's in Philadel
phia, and the National 16 and under championship.
She has also been runnerup the last two years in
the National 18 and under championships.
This summer, Janie traveled to Wimbledon in
England to play in the women's singles tourney.
She lost out in the first round there to Vera Sek-

ova of Czechoslovakia when went on to the semi-finals, and had boon
runnerup the previous year.
JULIE ANI) JAM: NOT ALONE
But good as they are. these two are not the whole women's tennis
team. Sponsored by the Women's Tennis Club, under the auspices
of the Women's Recreation Council, the team has about ten members.
Outside Julie and Janie, the leading members are Carol Lepper, Ann
Johnson. Linda George and Judy Minna.

National IN and under tournament, the first time they met, Jane
won out in three sets. She repeated her victory a few weeks later in

This year, with the pair ranked second and third in the nation
in the 18 and under bracket, they mot in the finals at Forest Hills,
New York and Julie triumphed in the finals to win ttie champion
ship with Jane placing second.
TENNIS IN Till] FAMILY
The product of a tennis-mad family, Julie has been playing for
more than ten years. Her father was a National Juniors champion
and her mother, while not an outstanding player, is the editor and
publisher of the Bible of tennis, World Tennis magazine.

Between high school years spent at Dalton
School, a Manhatten girls' day school, Julie spent
some summers at a lennis camp in Hamtramck,
Mich, sharpening her game. Julie won her first
major tournament when only 12 years old, the
Canadian Juniors in 1956. She repeated this win
in each of the next two years, and won the U.S.
15 and under the next season.
Since that triumph, in addition to being the
current National Junior champion, Julie has won
three clay courts crowns the 1962 Southern
Women's, the 1962 Tennessee Valley Invitational
and the Tri-State tournament in Cincinatti.

Janie, on the other hand, comes from a football family with deep
roots at Stanford. Her father, Frank, was the great quarterback
who enabled Clark Shaugnessy to introduce the T formation on the

| Farm in the early '40's, and more recently coached
the San Francisco '49ers to their best season ever.
Since she obviously could not play football,
Janie began to play tennis when she was about
11 years old. A very successful player, Jane has
won the California women's singles and doubles
crowns, the Middle States Women's in Philadel
phia, and the National 16 and under championship.
She has also been runnerup the last two years in
the National 18 and under championships.
This summer, Janie traveled to Wimbledon in
England to play in the women's singles tourney.
She lost out in the first round there to Vera Sek-

ova of Czechoslovakia when went on to the semi-finals, and had boon
runnerup the previous year.
