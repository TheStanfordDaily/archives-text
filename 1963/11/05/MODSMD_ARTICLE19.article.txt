# Booters Bop USF in Overtime
## 
### 
By ROGER MAGNISON
The strong Stanford soccer
! team took another step toward
an unbeaten season and a Nor-
I Cal conference championship Sat-
I urday. But not, however, before
I they had blown a big three goal
' first period lead to San Francisco
I University, being forced to settle
for a 4-3 squeaker over USF.
With fifteen minutes gone in
) the first stanza, Klas Bergman
j dribbled down the left sidelines
and, after confusing several de
fensemen with some excellent
footwork, fired a pass in front
to Kammel Kadi who rapped it
! in from 20 feet out and to the
j left.
SHEER SPEED, with the addi
tion of extremely accurate kick
ing ability accounted for Stan
i ford's next goal three minutes
later. A 1 Nnoli, a good prospect
for All-America honors, gained
possession of the ball near mid
field, outwitted two S.F. half
backs, and simply outran the rest
; of the opposition down the left
sidelines, climaxing his individ
ual effort with a low, sharp kick
into the opposite corner of the
net.
A minute later, at 19:53, it was
j Nnoli again getting off one of
! his powerful screaming shots
j that shot into the net past a dazed
| goalie, from 30 feet out.
THE SECOND period w'as only

two minutes old when Pepe Mar
tines of LI.S.F. booted the ball
past starting goalie Kent Muller,
from a crowd of players gath
ered in front of the Stanford net.
The hard-kicking Martines was
again the villain at 6:07 when he
beat the Cards defense to a loose
ball, and raced in alone on the
goalie, deking out Muller with a
virtually unstopable shot that
soared into the right hand corner.
THAT WAS ALL the scoring
until midway in the fourth period
when, after what Coach Priddle
termed some "sloppy playing"
during the second and third pe
riods, the S.F. squad finally got
the equalizer on a shot off the
foot of Saiz, at 10:27. on a pass
from Sofaer, to send the contest
into overtime.
At 3:11 of the first overtime,
Larry Chuckwedebe dribbled de
terminedly down the right side
line and kicked an across field
pass in front of the net, where A 1
Nnoli "used his head" in the lit
eral sense, and knocked the ball
past the IF.S.F. goalie, garnering
his third goal of the game, and
adding to his team scoring lead.
From there on, the Indian defense
held, giving the Cards a 4-3 tri
umph.

two minutes old when Pepe Mar
tines of LI.S.F. booted the ball
past starting goalie Kent Muller,
from a crowd of players gath
ered in front of the Stanford net.
The hard-kicking Martines was
again the villain at 6:07 when he
beat the Cards defense to a loose
ball, and raced in alone on the
goalie, deking out Muller with a
virtually unstopable shot that
soared into the right hand corner.
THAT WAS ALL the scoring
until midway in the fourth period
when, after what Coach Priddle
termed some "sloppy playing"
during the second and third pe
riods, the S.F. squad finally got
the equalizer on a shot off the
foot of Saiz, at 10:27. on a pass
from Sofaer, to send the contest
into overtime.
At 3:11 of the first overtime,
Larry Chuckwedebe dribbled de
terminedly down the right side
line and kicked an across field
pass in front of the net, where A 1
Nnoli "used his head" in the lit
eral sense, and knocked the ball
past the IF.S.F. goalie, garnering
his third goal of the game, and
adding to his team scoring lead.
From there on, the Indian defense
held, giving the Cards a 4-3 tri
umph.

The strong Stanford soccer
! team took another step toward
an unbeaten season and a Nor-
I Cal conference championship Sat-
I urday. But not, however, before
I they had blown a big three goal
' first period lead to San Francisco
I University, being forced to settle
for a 4-3 squeaker over USF.
With fifteen minutes gone in
) the first stanza, Klas Bergman
j dribbled down the left sidelines
and, after confusing several de
fensemen with some excellent
footwork, fired a pass in front
to Kammel Kadi who rapped it
! in from 20 feet out and to the
j left.
SHEER SPEED, with the addi
tion of extremely accurate kick
ing ability accounted for Stan
i ford's next goal three minutes
later. A 1 Nnoli, a good prospect
for All-America honors, gained
possession of the ball near mid
field, outwitted two S.F. half
backs, and simply outran the rest
; of the opposition down the left
sidelines, climaxing his individ
ual effort with a low, sharp kick
into the opposite corner of the
net.
A minute later, at 19:53, it was
j Nnoli again getting off one of
! his powerful screaming shots
j that shot into the net past a dazed
| goalie, from 30 feet out.
