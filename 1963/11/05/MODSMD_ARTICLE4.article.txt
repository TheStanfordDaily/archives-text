# Noted Socialist Residing Here
## 
### 
Norman M. Thomas, a member
of the Socialist Party for forty
five years and six times its presi
dential nominee from 1928 to
1948 is staying in Stern Hall this
quarter. While here, Thomas will
speak of his vision of Iho world,
both as it exists presently and
as if could exist were men to set
about to change it â€” to insure
"peace, freedom, cooperation."
THOMAS BELIEVES that in
1963 we contend with a world
where conflicting pressures of
overpopulation continually
threaten peace and order, a
world facing a disproportion be
tween its material and spiritual
development, a world which ap
proaches the difficulty of manag
ing an economy of actual or po
tential surpluses with concepts
developed under an economy of
scarcity, a world which sees re
curring harbingers of an "un
thinkable war," a world in which
the new national freedoms do
not mean individual freedom, a
world "sick with frustration."
Thomas is deeply committed
to socialism as a means of deal
ing with these problems of our
times, and he regards socialism
as capable of effecting a genuine
revolution in the present human
condition.
Thomas' visit here affords a
rare opportunity for the men of
the Stern houses not only to meet
a man of history and challenge
his ideas, but to challenge their
own ideas. His visit should afford
students the opportunity to grasp
more precisely the issues, great
and small, of our age.
THOMAS was born in Marion.
Ohio, on November 20. 1884. He
graduated from Princeton in
1905 and from the Union Theol
ogical Seminary iti 1911; shortly
thereafter lie was ordained in the
Presbyterian ministry. Thomas
.joined the Socialist Party in
1918; in 1924 he was his party's
candidate for the governorship
of New York.
