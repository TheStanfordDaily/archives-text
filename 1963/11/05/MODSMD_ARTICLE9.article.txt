(Editor's Not**: This summer
'it Stanford men, 15 freshmen
and th«' rest iipperelassmen,
under the leadership of Dean of
Ereslunen Dwight Clark, tra
veled to Hong Koiik for a work
project. The following is th e
first of a three part series on
their trip.)

Everyone knows about S t a n
ford in France and Italy, but how
many people know that last sum
mer there was a Stanford in Hong
Kong? Our dormitory facilities
ranged from the servants' quar
ters of a YMCA to the concrete
floor of a middle school, and we
taught the classes instead of be
ing taught but as a learning
experience it rivaled any of the
others.
The work project was arranged
by World University Service
(WUS) and was financed by the
men involved. WUS, an organi
zation whose purpose is to give
aid to and foster understanding
between tho college students of
the world, had never run a work
camp like this before.
TIIK I DMA for t ho project origi
nated in a late-night discussion
between Stanford's Dean Dwight
Clark and WUS representative
Frank Watanabe about how Stan
ford students might contribute
more directly than through dona
tions. The result became known
;is the Stanford-llongKong WUS.
That was January, and in June
we were touring Japan on our
way to Hong Kong. We spent

fifteen days there with Makoto
Fujita, a WUS official who
wanted us to see deeper into
Japan than the average tourist
does. We did. but the pace Mr.
Fujita set nearly made invalids
of some of us.
ONE OF the most memorable
parts of our stay in Japan was a
two-day interlude in a Buddhist
monastery in a town called Koya
san. high in the mountains south
of Osaka. In this community of
120 Buddhist monasteries we
sampled the traditional Buddhist
life and the vegetarian food
(which left mixed impressions).
We even got up at 6:30 one morn
ing to attend a service where the
priests chanted the scripture in a
high monotone and the smoke of
the incense we offered made the
darkened room seem even more
mystical. This experience, if none
other, demonstrated to us how
little we knew about this culture
and how much we could learn.
Tuberculosis is one of the
Orient's most widespread dis
eases. and we visited a TB sani
torium near Tokyo that WUS had
just constructed, with the help of
$1,700 that Si an ford students do
noted to WUS last fall. Here stu
dents may have a TB-arresting
operation and a place to conva
lesce. The waiting list of appli
cants was far beyond the capacity
of the sani torium.
We talked with a great many
people, and discovered that a
great way to meet people was to
look lost, which was hardly diffi
cult because we usually were. We

found the people generally shy at
first but eager to talk about al
most anything, especially for
eign affairs and tho U.S. What
they always asked about .and
what we could never explain sat
isfactorily, was why we allowed
violence like that in Birmingham,
which was being played up in
their papers.
While some of the more ener
getic members of the group went
off to climb Mount Fuji a few of
us went down to Hiroshima.
There we visited Earle Reynolds,
the noted pacifist who has sailed
in protest into both the American
and Russian testing areas. He was
a very impressive and intelligent
person, deeply concerned with the
problems, like prejudice and fear,
that the survivors of Hiroshima
and their children face, and with
preventing a repetition of such
destruction. After seeing the ex
hi bits in the Peace Memorial Mu
seum, which included some fairly
shocking pictures of people with
most of their skin burned off, wo
were a little more impressed by
the figures people so easily quote
for "number injured."
AT KWANSKI Gakuin Univer
sity we laid a wreath at a memo
rial to the students who died in
World War 11. This gesture not
only go) us a very warm recep
tion at the school but oven got
us int«» several of the Tokyo
papers and at least one television
news broadcast. We left Japan
quite pleased with the experi
ences we had been able to pack
into fifteen days.
