THE GREAT DOOR OF DEATH
The Holy Scriptures, speaking with the authority of God. claim thai
a created sold cannot he destroyed. This means that each of lis will
spend eternity somewhere, that physical death is not extinction of
our individual consciousness. Death is either a victory or a defeat,
according to the path we choose here in this world. Now is the time
when death will he defeated if yon will choose llie way of Christ.
Otherwise, at the experience t ailed "physical death" }oii will be for
ever separated from Chid.
"Jesus said. I am the resurrection and the life, lie who believes in
me, though be die, yet shall he live, and whoever lives and believes
in me shall never die." John 11:25-26 KS\
"For the wages of sin is death; hut the gift of Cod is eternal life
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Rom: 6:23.
"In truth I tell you, if anyone obeys my teaching he shall never know
what il is to die." John8:i)l ,\'E.
" \nyone who gives heed to what 1 say and puts his trust in him who
sent me has hold of eternal life, and does not come up for judgment,
but lias already passed from death to life." John 5:24 NE.
"... when we were baptised into union with Christ Jesus we were
baptised into death. Bv baptism we are buried with him. and lay
dead in order that as Christ was raised from the dead by the splendor
i»f the father, so vve also might set our feet upon the new path of life."
Rom. 6:3-4 INE
"O death where i> thy sting? O grave where is iliv victory ? The sling
of death is sin: and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to
God which givetli us our victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
I (ior. 15 K J
"\\ e see. then, thai as one act of sin exposed llie whole race of men
In God's judgment and condemnation, so one act of perfect righteous
ness presents all men freely acquitted in the sight of God. One man's
disobedience placed all men under the threat of condemnation, but
one man's obedience has the power to present all men righteous before
(iod. Now vve find that the law keeps slipping into the picture to point
the vast extent of sin. Yet, though sin is shown to he wide and deep,
thank God his grace is wider and deeper still! The whole outlook
changes sin used to be the master of men and in the end handed them
over lo death: now grace is the ruling factor, with righteousness as
its purpose and its end the bringing of men to eternal life of God
through Jesus Christ our Lord." Rom: .1:12-17 Ph. "We know lhat
vve have passed from death into life ..." I John 3:14 RSV.
Have vou passed from death into life? Il happens when you give your
self to Jesus Christ, 'l lie experience is real and the price has been
paid bv God for you. li s yours for the asking.
