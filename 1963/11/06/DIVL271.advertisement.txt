Button Tab*... a new Gant idea that eliminates the collar
button; in its place a permanent button is sewn on the tab.
Result: fast, easy adjustment with no snaps showing. Note:
the slight but noticeably different shape of collar. It's a
more generous tab — typically Gant. In solid colors or
stripes about $7 at discerning stores.
