# Chappie Makes Effort At 'Pompous' Humor
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingdale 
The Chaparral makes its first
appearance of the year today with
a pompous satire of the Campus
Voice, the controversial protest
magazine sold and published by
a number of Bay Area college stu
dents.
Calling itself the "Pompous
Voice," this Chappie effort rips
into the real Voice, satirizing its
self-professed "militant, thought
ful, and sensitive" personality and
ridiculing its style and subject
matter by exaggerating it to a
point well beyond absurdity and
at times well beyond interesting
reading.
WRITTEN BY seven Chappie
staff members under the direc
tion of new editor Steve Zousmer.
the Pompous Voice includes sev
eral insane and raving editorials,
some Jack Kerouac-like fiction, a
few satires on ultra-ethereal po
etry, a number of zany articles,
and music for a song entitled "Oh,
Freedom, Oh."
The theme of the satire is that
the Pompous Voice is the only
sensitive and militant safeguard
of freedom, and that freedom is
constantly endangered by the
many Fascist, Communist, Lib
eral and Conservative warmong
ers who are hiding everywhere,
especially on the Stanford cam
pus. The opening editorial
("We're Gonna Publish In Spite
Of You Jerks") proclaims the
Pompous Voice's militant inten
tion to rescue freedom and keep
publishing despite the anti-free
dom eonspiratory designs of any
"drugstore pacifists and Monday
morning Roosevelt s."
IN THE DEPARTMENT of liv
ing fiction the Pompous Voice
presents "Freedom on the Rods,"
tlie earthy story of Gaby Joe and
Mike the Bum and "the one they
called Underpants." and another
story which is quite modestly
titled "Me." The poems are "Swirl
ing Hemlock" and "Knobs," and
neither has anything to do with
either.
"Abortion and Reality at Stan
ford" is one of several non-fic
tion essays, along with "An In
terview \Yilh Two Students Who
Went to Cuba" (although they
never got out of Florida and an
article on "The South American
Rectal Root," a new drug which
the author consumes as he writes,
There is a movie review (of the
film "Influenza of the Bowels"),
a list of local Beat Spots, an ar
ticle on Protest Technique, and
a pseudo-sensilive love story
called "Two Daflodils "
However faithful the Channie

motives of its originators. The
"Campus Voice" is an inordinate
ly boring publication; parody in
volves verbal caricature, exagger
ation. However, before one ends
up by calling the Chappie exag
gerated boredom, one should
stop.
