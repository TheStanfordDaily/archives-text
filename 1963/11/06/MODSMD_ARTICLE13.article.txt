# New Student Affairs Committee To Evaluate Senior Colloquia
## 
### 
An evaluation of the General
Studies Program and a study of
Senior Colloquia offerings are
planned as the first undertakings
of the new Student Academic Af
fairs Committee. Recently created

by the Legislature, the committee
has been set up to make evalua
tions on areas of academic life
which warrant particular student
attention and to report its find
ings to the student body.
ASSU President Bud Wedin has
appointed Mark Lowman chair
man of the group, which is pres
ently in the process of formation.
Keith Bent/, director of the
study on Senior Colloquias, states,
"There is much criticism being di
rected by students and faculty
not only at the limited number
of offerings, but at the entire
value of required Senior Collo
quias. The time has come to find
out what a representative number
of students and faculty have to
say about the program."
At the beginning of Winter
Quarter, the Student Academic
Affairs Committee plans to pub
lish an evaluation of General
Studies offerings, including sug
gestions for improvements.
Asked about past student ef
forts in producing such an evalu
ation, Chairman Lowman com
ments. "Unfortunately the his
tory of the "Scratch Sheet" has
been characterized by insufficient
sampling and, often times, irre
sponsible attacks on a professor's
method of teaching. By taking
a careful and scientific approach
toward evaluation, most of the
past weaknesses can be elimin
ated and. at the same time, an
effective basis for instituting im
provements in courses and teach
ing can be established."
Several faculty members are
assisting the committee in draft
ing a meaningful, comprehensive
questionnaire for the student
body. Students are urgently
needed from all departments to
assist the committee in its efforts.
The signup sheet for interested
students is posted in the ASSU
Office and will bo there for the
remainder of the week.
