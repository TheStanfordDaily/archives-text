# Art Show Coming
## 
### 
The second annual student art
show will take placo from Nov.
26-Dec. 13 at Tresidder Union.
The exhibit will consist of both
two and three dimensional art
work, representing the work of
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents.
Members of the Cultural Arts
Division of Tresidder will select
the works to be displayed. Three
to five of the works displayed will
be purchased by the Union to be
added to its permanent collection,
and these works may be shown in
a special exhibit of prize-winning
student art from previous Tres
idder exhibits sometime in the fu
ture. The selection for purchase
will take place about a week after
the exhibit will open.
The entry deadline is 4 p.m..
Wednesday, Nov. 20. The Cultural
Arts Division requests that works
be matted or framed, preferably
fitted for hanging. Works should
be submitted at the Information
Center of Tresidder. Students are
not limited to one entry or cate
gory. Sculptures or paintings of
unusual size will probably not be
eligible.
Miss Penny Ray, a chairman of
the event, emphasizes that this is
a student art show, not a profes
sional one, and she encourages
all students to submit their work
regardless of previous experience.
Any inquiries should be di
rected to Penny Ray, Tony Sweet,
or Paul Escobosa.
