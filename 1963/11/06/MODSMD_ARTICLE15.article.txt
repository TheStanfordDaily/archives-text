# Opposing Standpoints Cause Student-Administration Clash
## 
### FRED NELSON BUD RATTS 
(Editor's Not**: This is the first of a series of columns concern
ing recent trends in student thought ami intra-Uni versify rela
tions.)
In recent months the attention of the student body, at the instiga
tion of members of its official structure, has been drawn to Ihe
student role in University decision processes, and beyond that to
concern, on its own initiative, with the role of the University in the
fields of education and public policy. Although this student interest
has been present before, during the past two years its expression at
Stanford has been broad, and has been intended to cause the Uni
versity to extend its sympathy and to seriously reexamine its own
policy structure. The nature of this expression, however, and sub
sequent reaction within the University administration, have given a
strained and formal aspect to present student-administration rela
tions, and have jeopardized the future of student involvement in the
governance of the University.
Student thought in this area, by its nature, has a strong touch
of idealism and simplification, and concerns itself with particular
points of interest, isolated from the broad scope of University affairs.
The organized administration of the University, on the other hand,
is tinged with tradition and custom and is continuously concerned
with numerous and often conflicting involvements, pressures and
purposes. Opposing standpoints have been caused by these opposing
characteristics, and from them has come the recent conflict of views
concerning student rights and capabilities. Student thought tends
to ignore the nature and extent of the University's responsibilities,
and has seldom been presented in a spirit of understanding and
accommodation of the context in which the administration works.
The University, in a similar manner, has been slow to understand
and accommodate student thought. The resulting atmosphere of
mutual recrimination and distrust has led to the apparent assump
tion by each party lhat the other is inherently opposed to its views.
An increasing number of people in responsible positions have come
to see the University as a battlefield for two opposing camps stu
dents and administration.
THE FAULT IS MUTUAL. Students sense immediacy more eas
ily than they can long-run importance, and the University reaction
is all too often one of head-on opposition rather than careful analysis
and decision. Both contribute to the unnecessary air of crisis sur
rounding student affairs, and both are being dragged back from the
realization of mutual goals.
Communication — natural, not artificial — should be of immedi
ate concern to all persons who assume for themselves some interest
in University government. Mutual perspective, and a perception of
the background of issues and the motivation of other parties, should
come before public discussion — and conflict — concerning issues
of importance. The present a priori assumption that communication
is impossible, or attainable only in a formal context, precludes the
accomplishment of anyone's ends.
The point most often missed is that member's of the University
community — faculty, administrators and students — have the same
goals. All wish, in one manner or another, for- the strengthening of
curricular education, for the heightening of the University's impact
on the society it serves, for increased student awareness of issues
of social importance and for the strengthening of Stanford's status
among American universities. Few can deny the importance of these
goals, and it would seem difficult to justify the accusation that either
students or administrators have lost sight of them. They comprise,
in a broad sense, the reason for the University' existence, and the
accusation that one or another reason is attempting to hinder prog
ress toward them is false.
A FULL CONSESUS on these matters is improbable, but both
students and administrators should give serious thought to the means
they use to govern their progress toward their expressed goals. A
careful approach, free from both sensationalism and preconceived
conflict, should be made to the study of the roles of the University.
Conflict at Stanford often precedes its own justification, and will
continue to do so until a more rational mutual approach is used.
Students, and particularly student officers, as the natural pro
tagonists in these discussions, should throughly analyze the problems
they conceive; they should study them in the larger context of Uni
versity responsibility, reexamine University stands and work with
the University to resolve apparent disagreements before open battle
is declared.
The University, on its part, has been marking time while students
are taking the initiative in examining and expressing the goals of the
institution. In this area, if no other, it should seize the initiative for
itself and explain, in the fullest possible manner, its purposes and
the rationale for the policies that have been created to facilitate its
work. Conflict will and should exist, but some will be tempered and
much will be circumscribed by a far-reaching, positive statement of
goals and policies. In this aspect of the administration's present
relationship with the student body, if it can't lick them, it should
lead them.
A GOAL of intelligent consensus should be established, to remove
many of the immediate difficulties involved in campus communica
tion. The means used to reach this goal should be geared to reflect
the seriousness with which both parties claim to consider the fuction
and future of the University.
