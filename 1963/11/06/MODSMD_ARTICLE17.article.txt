STUDENTS IN MISSISSIPPI i
Editor, The Daily:
According to the Western edi
tion of the New York Times for
November 2nd, three hundred
Stanford students volunteered to
go to Mississippi to help the elec
tion campaign of the Negro can
didate for governor. It's hard for
me to know which to praise the
most: their motives, their initia
tive, or their courage. I can only
say that in twelve years of fol
lowing Stanford affairs, on and
off campus, I cannot remember
anything more heartening. Any
i one who is willing to take direct
! action against the unspeakable
tyranny of the Southern white
: man deserves the genuinely hum
| hie praise of those of us North
i ern whites whose spirit is willing
but whose flesh is all too weak, i
This action may not be noticed
in the alumni bulletin, but 1 hope
i it is much more characteristic of
j Stanford in the 1960's than the
Confederate flag hanging from
the fraternity house.

YOUTHFUL ENTHUSIASM
Editor, The Daily:
The following can, I think, be
of some interest to a rather large
number of Stanford students. I
would like to see it presented in
The Daily.
I have recently discovered in
myself and many of my fellow
students an attitude equally as
unhealthy as that undisciplined
emancipation of spirit so often
associated with the beat genera
tion. It is an admiration for and
striving after the wisdom, stabil
ity, and self-assurance of middle
age. The ordinary occurrence of
this attitude takes the form of a
rejection of "romantic," idealistic,
and emotional urges. Since it per
forms this beneficial function and
is at first glance a sign of matur
ity. it is usually left unexamined.
1 have been examining it, and
strongly recommend that others
do so.
It is agreed, I think, that un
critical freedom of spirit, like
every form of psychic unbutton
ing, leads to dissolution of person
ality—at least rn those few who
have courage enough to live their
convictions. But a premature ac
quisition of the wisdom of the
ancients is just as detrimental.
Though it does not dissipate the
strength and integrity of person
ality, it does very effectively
drain away all real life and mean
ing.
Among many of today's intel
ligent young people emotionalism
is anaethema, dreamers are par
iahs; and there is probably a
sound basis for such a tendency.
On the other hand, I can think of
nothing more foolish—or tragic
- —than someone in his early twen
ties struggling to assume the
gravity and sweet reasonableness
of an older generation. Maturity,
after all, is the fruit of experi
ence, not a substitute for - it. Men
are wise to the degree that they
understand themselves and their
relationship to life. And this wis
dom, despite its potential for uni
versal application, remains essen
tially a very personal possession
and cannot be assimilated whole
or in part by another.
There is, though, a wisdom
proper to youth; and I think it
consists in what might be called,
for- lack of a better word, natural
ness. 11 is something like detach
ment, both from what one has
been and from what one will be.
It is, as a young French girl put
it, a willingness to wait and see
what one will do and how one
will behave as something instruc
tive about oneself. Self-knowledge
thus attained may well prelude
the beginnings of a better- wisdom
—but in later years, when time
has worn away the irrelevant.
Let us not grow old too soon.
—JOHN S. LAMBERT
LONG LETTERS
Editor, The Daily:
The length, wordiness, and tedi
ousness of the letters published
by The Daily is detracting from
their role in this stimulating and
entertaining forum of opinion.
I urge you to encourage succinct
statements, and to edit the long,
nagging plaints. Above all. I hope
to see no more inept fables, tenu
ous parables, and other odd Once
upon-a-time's.
—PETER MORETTI

REPLY TO MR. SHURTLEFF
Editor, The Daily:
The romantic idealism of Mr.
Jeffrey Shurtleff is of a nature
infuriating lo any person harbor
ing a trace of realism in his head.
Mr. Shurtleff's revulsion at see
ing Jesus on the drill field is ap
parently untempered by any in
telligent notion of the world sit
uation. The diplomatic wiles and
subversive aggression of Commu
nist Russia are nearly sixty years
old: there can be little question
of its intention to dominate the
world. Suppression of free speech
in Russia is of an age with its
Byzantine foreign policy: there
should be little doubt in Mr.
Shurtleff's mind that the freedom
he enjoys in writing such letters
of dissent is a phenomenon pecu
liar to the Free World. Surely
churchgoer Shurtleff does not be
lieve that the ruling Russian
Communist Party, whose policies
include atheism as well as univer
sal conscription, is less guilty
than this university of "attempt
ing to suppress that which is
gentle, and humble, and holy in
each individual." But for those
unable to see the looming Rus
sian bear, or to detect its threaten
ing character, I need only look
back twenty years to Nazi Ger
many for proof. I suggest to Mr.
Shurtleff that were it not for
ROTC at universities like Stan
ford, and for other forms of the
peacetime military training which
ROTC exemplifies, he. with his
latter-day Jesus, might well spend
his Monday afternoons goose
stepping around Harry Maloney
Field.

ON JACKSON POLLOCK
Editor, The Daily:
I was highly amused to read
the letter in the Daily written by
one young and stupid Barbara
Keeney dealing with the happen
ings at the showing of Ben Hur
in 1961, especially the part where
Svelton Suetos ('6l) vomited over
the balcony there.
Well, first, just let me say that
the reason for this unmitigated
stupid attack of Miss Keeney's
on me is just what psychologists
call a defense mechanism. She
was actually my date that eve
ning and it was her that got vo
mited upon and it was she what
looked like a Jackson Pollack
painting. And she has ever since,
in fact. As to the answer of your
question, what's wrong with a
Jackson Pollack painting, I say
what's wrong with you. You
along with Steinhart and Suetos
should have your head examined.
So there, dumb college broad!

EAST GERMAN ELECTIONS
Editor, The Daily:
Last week the East German
government announced that the
recent elections resulted in ap
proval of the present government
by 90.95 per cent of the voters.
This letter, written by a 19-year
old student at Humboldt Univer
sity in East Berlin, illustrates the
validity of these elections. He
wrote in English, to avoid having
the letter censored; I have not
changed a word even to improve
the grammar.
"Yesterday here was the elec
tion s It was a tragic comedy or,
may be, also a comic tragedy. 1
went to the Wahllokal at 7 p.m.
as one of the last men. It was in
a restaurant, and about the half
of those people managing the
election were sitting already at
their beer and had got a little
blue, already. I had to show my
Personalausweis (identification)
and the information - postcard,
and then I got the paper with the
names of the candidates. Then
I asked, what to do, and they
said, I should fold the paper and
put it into the box. I hesitated
and asked, if there is no election
cabine (booth), where you can
elect secretly. They looked aston
ished, but then they showed me
a box looking like an orator-desk
full of flags at its outside. There
in I laid down the paper, took
quickly out of my coat a red pen
cil and effaced the whole paper.
But the paper crackled, and all
the people heard it. When I
wanted lo put. it into the box
now, a man stopped me and or
dered me to show the informa
tion-postcard again, on which he
saw my address. Then I could
put the paper in and walked out
quickly. The peoples looked
quiet as wishing to lynch me.
Today I experienced, that most
of my fellow-students had done
the same. I think, our doing prob
ably will have no political effects,
but I myself must have now no
bad conscience."
