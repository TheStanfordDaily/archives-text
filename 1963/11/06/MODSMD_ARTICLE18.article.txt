# Winbigler Offers Theory of University's Role in Human Struggles
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: In the past
two years, addresses and writ
ings of student leaders have
shown an increasing concern
with the philosophical role of
the University. In an October
24 "My Last Lecture" presen
tation, Dean of Students 11.
Donald Winbigler presented one
of the first commentaries along
this line to come to the student
body from a high-ranking uni
versity administrator. The
Daily has excerpted the speech
at length here, and hopes to
continue to do so should similar
speeches lie forthcoming from
others, in an attempt to estab
lish what a 'Stanford educa
tion" is and should be in the
eyes those who administrate
it.)
Some of you may recognize this
title ("Human Relations in The
University Arena") as a reflec
tion of a question which has been
a favorite in student discussions
of recent years, involving the con
trast between the classical con
cept of a university as an ivory
tower claister for contempla
tion and reflection and the con
cept of a university as a dusty
arena, noisy with racing chariots.
Since I chose this title, obviously
I hold to the arena theory.
But in using this figure, I rea
lize that the arena is less fa
miliarly known as the scene for
jousts of ideas than as the scene
for spectacles of cruelty. This is
uncomfortably close to what I

want to talk about.
Students of human personality
who have sought to understand,
measure and describe human per
sonality have long realized that
there are a number of polar quali
ties involved and that people dif
fer rather basically in their per
sonality patterns according to
their position on these gamuts.
The gamuts range from the ex
tremely dominant to the ex
tremely subservient, from the
independent to the dependent,
from the resistant to the com
pliant, from the egocentric to the
other-person centered.
Now while spontaneous behav
ior is often dictated entirely by
basic tempermental factors, the
intelligent person, who is cortex
directed, learns lhat his broad
ends can best be served by some
modification of these spontane
ous impulses. Being at the center
of the universe, and wanting to
come to terms with other people
who are also at the center of the
universe, it becomes important to
you to try to put yourself in their
position and to estimate how they
might react, i.e., if their reaction
is important to you.
Then you will discover some
thing even more profound and
simple about human beings.
While we pride ourselves on be
ing rational human creatures
and, therefore, cortex-directed or
idea-centered, we are really for
the most part feeling-centered,
even the most civilized and sophis
ticated of us. As a pratical propo
sition, of course, ideas do not ex
ist apart from the feelings we
have about them. Thought and
feeling are inseparable except in
theory.
But what passes for thought
has a higher emotional component
than is generally recognized. Wit
ness our contemporary preoccu
pation with the term intellectual
excitement. If by intellectual we
mean purely cognitive processes,
the phrase intellectual excite
ment would be a contradiction
in terms. In most of the discus
sion I hear about intellectual ex
citement, the term excitement is
in caps and the term intellectual
is in lower case. All this means
that you will always be sensitive
to the feelings of others as well
as to their conceptual orientation.
The logical course of this ap
proach to human relations is the
development in an individual of
certain facility in inter-personal
relationships which at one level
may be thought of as techniques
but, raised to its highest level, is
an art. It is the art of the coun
selor, the art of the actor, the art
of the speaker, the ait of the con
versationalist, the art of the
teacher, the art of the friend and
companion, eventually the art of
conjugal living.
Now there is nothing basically
wrong with giving attention to
the techniques of inter-personal
relationships. We are all inter
ested in self-improvement. I trust,
and certainly this is one impor
tant aspect of personal compet
ence. Attention to technique may
be as important in this area as
it is to the pianist, the violinist
or the painter.
It is only when we become pre
occupied with techniques or do
not go beyond the stage of the
technician that we merit the onus
of the "Dale Carnegie: How to
Win Friends a n d Influence
People" Award.
I should interject here that I
am assuming all along that you
are a person of integrity and
that you have ethically commend
able motives in your efforts to re
late to others, that you are not
bent on exploiting other people,
selling them vacuum cleaners
they do not need, or otherwise
manipulating them for your self
ish gain and to their detriment.
So far, we have been dealing
only with individual human rela
tionships. When these relation
ships are extended to the quasi
public realm and larger groups
e.g.. the Stanford arena most of
the same considerations are ap

plicable but there are others
which seem to he in contradiction
to them whether they are or not.
First, most of us enjoy a good
fight. All drama is based on
struggle. Sometimes it is the
struggle of an individual against
nonhuman forces, as in Greek
tragedy. But generally it is strug
gle between people who personify
forces. Generally, there is at
least one protagonist and one an
tagonist.
We. as observers, receive vicari
ous satisfaction from identifying
ourselves with this struggle even
though it involves violence, blood
shed or mayhem with which we
would not want to be more di
rectly involved.
Secondly, in any struggle, we
like to have our ideas personified.
It is more convenient and com
fortable to do battle with people
than with ideas, just as it is more
convenient and comfortable to
hate people than to hale abstrac
tions, to hate even individual
people rather than groups of
people or institutions, like gov
ernment.
This accounts for the fact that

in time of war when there is a
basic struggle between peoples,
the heads of state are generally
hated as people beyond the mea
sure of even their direct respon
sibility for the conflict. It also
i accounts for the general suscep
tibility of people to propaganda.
All this seems to present t he
budding politician with a dilem
ma. If you want to have effective
relationships with human beings
individually, you should cultivate
honesty, personal integrity, re
spect for the dignity of the in
dividual, spiritual and material
generosity and, in fact, great hu
manity.
But if you want to be a leader,
publicly recognized as such, get
yourself a cause which you can
personify, select a few worthy
enemies and stage a good fight.
Manipulate people to serve your
own ends and inhibit any im
pulses you may have to be hu
manitarian about it.
These seem to be the alterna
tives. It is my sad observation
that all too often students who
become caught up in political in
trigue succumb to the games

manship of it (which I admit is
great fun and quite irresistible),
setting aside for the time being
the ethical standards which nor
mally guide them in their individ
ual relationships. This is one of
the reasons 1 have more enthusi
asm for vigorous debate on politi
cal and social issues, concepts and
philosophies than I do for early
preoccupation with the machin
ery of our national political par
ties.
1 must admit that the dilemma
I posed is really a false one. Dif
ficult as it is, it is possible to be
a vigorous competitor and at the
same time maintain high respect
for the dignity of other human
beings. Its difficulty is demon
strated by the fact that all too
often even our most respected
statesmen fall from grace in this
particular and subsequently just
ify what amounts to personal
slander as just "campaign ora
tory."
In the last analysis, the gull
ible public must share some re
sponsibility for making slander
and ethically-shady campaigning
profitable. If the profit were tak

en out of it, it would be less com
mon. This brings me to the reali
zation that if Stanford is to do
its part as an educational insti
tution, it must contribute to a
more enlightened and discrimin
ating public.
Stanford has come a long way
in its development as a univer
sity in recent years. I hope we
can continue to have the intel
lectual restlessness which has
been called "ferment." Person
ally, I prize vigorous discussion,
debate and controversy of ideas.
With it I hope we can maintain
a climate which nourishes opti
mum growth in the personal com
petence of students; a climate
which encourages the values of
helpfulness and support to the
human beings which make up
Stanford; a climate which re
wards special talents and abilities
and cultural contributions; a cli
mate which provides an antidote
for such personal hostilities as
slip from control at times of emo
tional pressure; in short, a cli
mate which nourishes the finest
qualities of human character and
personality in us all.
