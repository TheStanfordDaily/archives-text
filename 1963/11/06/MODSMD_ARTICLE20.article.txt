second article on a work project
that 24 Stanford men, led by
Dean of Freshmen DwigJil
Clark, carried out in Hong - Kong
last summer under the auspices
of World University Service.)
After our fifteen days in Japan
we flew to Taiwan for a four-day
tour. A tour of this length is of
necessity superficial, but we man
aged to have an interesting time.
One of the most interesting
things we saw was a school where
students were taking the exams
that determined whether or not
ihey advanced to the next level
of school or dropped out. Anxious
families, obviously nervous, filled
the hallways, waiting for their
children to finish the tests. Tai
wan's education system is exceed
ingly inadequate, and so the pres
sure to do well in school is high.
Each year some suicides follow
the publishing of the exam re
sults.
Talking to the Chinese was
sometimes exciting, like the time
someone asked one 1 of them when
ho thought they would invade the
mainland and for a minute it
looked as if ho had committed
high treason. One does not, we
found, use the word "invade."
They are going to "retake" ihe
mainland.
OUR PR E S EN ( E was re
quested at a tea that the China
Youth Corps (a semi-official and
very important political organi
zation) gave for us, and we were
a bit shocked to walk in and find
television cameras and flood
lights staring us in the face.
We were welcomed effusively
and given official China Youth
Corps pins (we haven't found a

suitable occasion for wearing
them yet» and then were treated
to a rather radical harangue in
which we were told that the U.S.
is bungling the fight with Com
munism and that the only solu
tion is an all-out attack on Rus
sia and China.
We suspect that this whole
affair, wilh its great publicity,
was regarded as a golden oppor
tunity to connect the CYC with
a respected organization like
WUS and get some helpful propa
ganda. We hope not, because a
nonpartisan organization like
WUS can't afford to be politically
aligned.
WE WERE TIRED enough of
traveling at this point that we
were glad to get to Hong Kong
and to work. In the colony wo
were split up into two main
groups of eight men each plus
a few scattered individuals. One
group, the "townies," lived in
Kowloon in a YMCA, We spent
part of each day helping college
students with English conversa
tion, and for the rest of the day
some of us worked as the recrea
tion directors on the roofs of the
resettlement blocks, the giant
concrete shells that the British
are building to alleviate the hous
ing shortage.
While some worked in the re
settlement areas other "stal
warts" (as our leader referred to
us) worked in a WUS library,
trying to bring order out of a
chaos of old and very dusty
hooks. The purpose of this was
to create a badly-needed reference
library for the students of Hong
Kong.
We had to unpack crates of
books from the U.S.; and after
having to throw out a twenty-foot
stack of pre-1950 science texts
that some unknown benefactor
had sent us we came to the prize
of the lot—a 1917 edition of "Won
ders of the World." It made de
lightful reading, but somehow we
felt that it might make more
sense for people who clean out
their libraries to throw out the
useless books and send the money
that they would otherwise waste
on postage.
DURING THE EVENINGS all
of us who weren't on the resettle
ment blocks painted the interior
of a Mandarin church. This
church consisted simply of a large
room on the second floor of an
apartment house, but it was a
source of pride to the members
of the church and to us too when,
after two coats of paint, the place
looked clean and neat.
Life, even in the city, was some
times full of problems — like the
shoeshine boys who would liter
ally tackle vou on the street, or

I the drivers of (hose big double
! decked buses who had never been
taught to drive but were just put
in the cab and told to improvise.
Also there was the water, which
| due to the worst drought in Hong
1 Kong's history was turned on
only four hours every fourth day.
In Hong Kong's steambath atmos
phere this was a definite handi
cap. At least it was all interest
j ing-
