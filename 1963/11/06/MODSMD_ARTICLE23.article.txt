### JOHN CALMORE 
The Palo Alto Medical Clinic
is presently conducting a film
study on the healing of Clark
Weaver's knee. The study began
October f> when Weaver was in
jured while playing against
UCLA.
The film is to be shown to the
National Athletic Training Asso

next June. The various scenes of
the film cover Weaver being
brought off the field and ex
amined, to his operation lour
weeks ago.
The study will be resumed in
a couple of weeks when the cast
is removed. The remainder of the
film will be concerned mainly
with the rehabilitation of the in
jured knee, most of this filming
being done in the university's
training quarters. The final film

back on his feet, playing rugby.
