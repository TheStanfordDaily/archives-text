# ACCENT ON SPORTS
## Spirit on Upswing 
### PETE EAKLAND 
"You're not on television," Peter of the Peter, Paul, and Mary
trio screamed Wednesday night in the Pavilion at the five thousand
folk music lovers in attendance who had begun to clap in time to
"Oh, Rock My Soul." Spectator spirit at Stanford athletic contests
received a shot in the arm a week ago because of the very communi
cation medium that Peter had blasted—television. More Stanford
students were in attendance al tlie Notre Dame football game viewed
by forty million viewers coast-to-coast than at any other football
game this season. Many students who had not bought season books
were willing to pay upwards of $2.50 to see the game.
BANI) BANNER
Performing on field for the first time this year, the Stanford
band, under its new director Art Barnes, began the afternoon's activ
ity. It went through a sparkling rendition of the "Star-Spangled
Banner" that prompted Preseott Sullivan, sports columnist of the
San Francisco Examiner, to write an entire column about it. He tells
how the piece cause everybody present to react favorably. Most men
and women experienced a lump of patriotism in their throats. Some
men, he says, were on the verge of tears. One man in the press box
almost swallowed the cigar he had in his mouth.
The cheer leading staff spurred on to greater efforts came up
with some eftective cheers that the entire student body could shout
out without feeling a bit ashamed. Foremost among the new cheers
has to be the Famous People Series, ranging in variety from an
Eisenhower-inspired "Fore" cheer, quite useful on kiekoffs 10 a Mac-
Arthur oldie but goodie "We Shall Return" to be used when Stan
lord is penalized or thrown for a Joss to a Madame Nhu favorite
"Persecute Them" to be used when Stanford is on defense (unfortun
ately, this last one must be .junked.» Another cheer that immedi
ately caught on was an emphatic "Oet Off the Grass," useful when an

opponent marches, into Tribe ter-4
ritory, but fortunately not very
useful last Saturday.
CARD CARD SECTION
The card section, according to
some observers on the other side
of the field, was many times bet
ter than it had been previously
this season. And the card section
had been pretty darn good in its
two previous exhibitions at the
Oregon and UCLA games.
The important thing about the
enthusiasm generated Saturday
is that it does not seem to be
transitory. Activities of the week
after provide indications that
spectator spirit might cary over
for the rest of the quarter. And
since fall quarter athletics more
or less set the tone for other)
athletics, untapped energy can
find no better place for an outlet
than in the football, water polo, ;
or soccer stands.
The rally for the "Little Big
Game" Friday night led by the
cheerleaders, pom-pon girls, and
a portion of the band was a huge
success.
The next day, Stanford's unde-;
foaled water poloists, cheered on j
by a standing room only crowd
of approximately 1,200 fans, in- i
eluding the entire band, stayed '
in the groove by defeating Long;
Beach State in two overtime !
periods.
Coach Bob Gaughran said after
the game, dripping wet from an
enjoyable dunk in the pool,
"Thank you fans. You're really
great." Let's hope these senti
ments are reverberated by Stan
ford coaches for the rest of tho
quarter and, to be more optimis
tic, for the rest of the year.
