I WAS A TEEN-AGE SLIDE RULE
In .i mriii learned journal (l'laybov) the distinguished board
chairman (Ralph "Hot Lips" Sigafoos) of one of our most
important American industrial corporations (the Arf Mechan
ical I >og Co.) wrote a trenchant article in which lie pinpointed
our single most serious national problem: the lack of culture
among science graduates.
Let rue hasten to state that Mr. Sigafoos's article was in no
sense derogatory. He said emphatically that the science grad
uate, what with his gruelling curriculum in physics, math, and
chemistry, can hardly be expected to find time to study the
arts too. What distresses Mr. Sigafoos—and, indeed, all of us—
is the lopsided result of today's science courses: graduates
who can build a skyscraper but can't compose a concerto; who
know Newton s Third Law but not Beethoven s Fourth Sym-

phony; who nre familiar with Fraunhofer's lines but not with
Shelley's.
Mr. Sigafoos can find no solution to this lamentable imbal
ance. I, however, believe there is one and a very simple one.
It. is this: it students of science don't have time to come to
the arts, then the arts must come to students of science.
For example, it would be a very easy thing to teach poetry
and music riylit along with physics. Students, instead of being
called upon merely to recite, would instead be required to
rhyme their answers and set them to familiar tunes—like, for
instance, tho stirring Colonel Bogey March. Thus recitations
would not only be chock-a-block with important facts but
would, at the same time, expose the students to the aesthetic
delights of great poetry and music. Here, try it yourself. You
all know 1 lu Colonel Bogey March. Come, sing along with me:
Physics
Is what wc learn in class.
Einstein
iSaid energy is mass.
Keivton
I3 high-falutin'
A 7id Pascal's 11 rascal. So's BoyU .
Do you see how much more broadening, how much more up
lifting it is to learn physics this way? Of course you do. What?
You want another chorus? By all means:
/.1 yd en

Trolley
He made the Trolley car.
Curie

And Diesel's a weasel. So's Boyle.
Once the student has mastered The Colonel Bogey March,

I WAS A TEEN-AGE SLIDE RULE
In .i mriii learned journal (l'laybov) the distinguished board
chairman (Ralph "Hot Lips" Sigafoos) of one of our most
important American industrial corporations (the Arf Mechan
ical I >og Co.) wrote a trenchant article in which lie pinpointed
our single most serious national problem: the lack of culture
among science graduates.
Let rue hasten to state that Mr. Sigafoos's article was in no
sense derogatory. He said emphatically that the science grad
uate, what with his gruelling curriculum in physics, math, and
chemistry, can hardly be expected to find time to study the
arts too. What distresses Mr. Sigafoos—and, indeed, all of us—
is the lopsided result of today's science courses: graduates
who can build a skyscraper but can't compose a concerto; who
know Newton s Third Law but not Beethoven s Fourth Sym-

phony; who nre familiar with Fraunhofer's lines but not with
Shelley's.
Mr. Sigafoos can find no solution to this lamentable imbal
ance. I, however, believe there is one and a very simple one.
It. is this: it students of science don't have time to come to
the arts, then the arts must come to students of science.
For example, it would be a very easy thing to teach poetry
and music riylit along with physics. Students, instead of being
called upon merely to recite, would instead be required to
rhyme their answers and set them to familiar tunes—like, for
instance, tho stirring Colonel Bogey March. Thus recitations
would not only be chock-a-block with important facts but
would, at the same time, expose the students to the aesthetic
delights of great poetry and music. Here, try it yourself. You
all know 1 lu Colonel Bogey March. Come, sing along with me:
Physics
Is what wc learn in class.
Einstein
iSaid energy is mass.
Keivton
I3 high-falutin'
A 7id Pascal's 11 rascal. So's BoyU .
Do you see how much more broadening, how much more up
lifting it is to learn physics this way? Of course you do. What?
You want another chorus? By all means:

Trolley

Once the student has mastered The Colonel Bogey March,
