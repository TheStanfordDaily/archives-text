# Harvard Students Plan Cuba Trip
## 
### 
A recent article in- "The Har
vard Crimson" announced the in
tention of three Harvard students
to help improve international si in
dent communications by making
a trip to Cuba. Unlike the stu
dents who visited Cuba this sum
mer. they arc seeking State De
partment validation of their pass
ports.
Speaking of the proposed trip.
Fit/.hugh Mullein, one of the three,
said; "We have only an objective
interest in Cuba . . . We have no
intention of letting the Castro
government pay for any of our
expenses. We hope merely to
establish lies with Cuban stu
dents in an effort to reopen chan
nels of student communication."
Considering themselves politi
cally innocuous, they hope I he
Stale Department will approve of
their trip. They aim to give the
Cuban student an unbiased view
of the United States, and hope to
hear an unemotional account of
what has happened in Cuba. So
far the University has taken no
stand on the trip.
