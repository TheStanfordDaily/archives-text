# House-Senate Committee Approves $1.2 Billion for College Construction
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS) Representatives of the House and Sen
ate last Thursday agreed on 51.2 billion in federal aid for college
construction the largest government funding program for higher
education in U.S. history.
The agreement was reached after Senate and House versions of

the "bricks and mortar" college-*
aid bill were sent to a conference ;
committee to permit House-Sen
ate negotiators to come up with
a compromise version. The price
tag agreement was seen as a vic
tory for House Education Com
mittee members.
THEY HAD PUSHED for a $1.2
billion authorization- $.7 billion
short of the Senate approved bill. ,
Also agreed on was th;il the pro-!
gram would cover three years as ;
urged by the House instead of!
five years as in the Senate ver- j
sion. But House conferees went
along with the Senate provision
for a separate $50 million for pub
lic junior colleges. The House
had included these schools with
other colleges meaning theyj
would have received less.
The agreement also covered the
two major obstacles that were;
stopping Congressional action.
The major obstacle, created by
Sen. Sam J. Ervin (D.-N.C.), was |
compromised out of the bill. Be- j
fore the Senate approved its ver- J
sion of the college aid construe-]
tion bill, Ervin had won approval 1
of an amendment permitting any
taxpayer to bring suit against the 1
U.S. education commissioner to
block federal grants to church !
affiliated colleges or universities. ;
BECAUSE THE Ervin amend
ment invites court supervision of |
the bill. House Education mem
bers bitterly contested that it was
unconstitutional. Enough Senate I
members of the conference com
mittee were also opposed to it
and it was removed from the bill.
A second, but lesser roadblock,
was just what sort of const ruc
tion could be permitted with!
grant funds from five program.
The House version permitted con
struction of any classrooms
except those for religious study
or worship.
The Senate bill restricted the j
funds 1o eliminate the possibility
of any religious use including i
philosophy which would tend

*
to hurt liberal arts facilities while
favoring science and engineering
classrooms. The compromise ver
sion prohibits the construction of
religious chapels and permits
funds for liberal arts facilities
i and is thus tantamount to ap
i proval of the bill.

had included these schools with
other colleges meaning theyj
would have received less.
The agreement also covered the
two major obstacles that were;
stopping Congressional action.
The major obstacle, created by
Sen. Sam J. Ervin (D.-N.C.), was |
compromised out of the bill. Be- j
fore the Senate approved its ver- J
sion of the college aid construe-]
tion bill, Ervin had won approval 1
of an amendment permitting any
taxpayer to bring suit against the 1
U.S. education commissioner to
block federal grants to church !
affiliated colleges or universities. ;
BECAUSE THE Ervin amend
ment invites court supervision of |
the bill. House Education mem
bers bitterly contested that it was
unconstitutional. Enough Senate I
members of the conference com
mittee were also opposed to it
and it was removed from the bill.
A second, but lesser roadblock,
was just what sort of const ruc
tion could be permitted with!
grant funds from five program.
The House version permitted con
struction of any classrooms
except those for religious study
or worship.
The Senate bill restricted the j
funds 1o eliminate the possibility
of any religious use including i
philosophy which would tend

*
to hurt liberal arts facilities while
favoring science and engineering
classrooms. The compromise ver
sion prohibits the construction of
religious chapels and permits
funds for liberal arts facilities
i and is thus tantamount to ap
i proval of the bill.
WASHINGTON (CPS) Representatives of the House and Sen
ate last Thursday agreed on 51.2 billion in federal aid for college
construction the largest government funding program for higher
education in U.S. history.
The agreement was reached after Senate and House versions of

the "bricks and mortar" college-*
aid bill were sent to a conference ;
committee to permit House-Sen
ate negotiators to come up with
a compromise version. The price
tag agreement was seen as a vic
tory for House Education Com
mittee members.
THEY HAD PUSHED for a $1.2
billion authorization- $.7 billion
short of the Senate approved bill. ,
Also agreed on was th;il the pro-!
gram would cover three years as ;
urged by the House instead of!
five years as in the Senate ver- j
sion. But House conferees went
along with the Senate provision
for a separate $50 million for pub
lic junior colleges. The House
