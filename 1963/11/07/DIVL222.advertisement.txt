TO STUDENT CHURCHMEN
I ... the Church's mission is to bring you to an intelligent and mature
Christian life. Your childhood faitli needs to keep pace with other areas
of your development. Too often Christian faith is shuffled off a< something
that was important when we were children, hut no longer is relevant to
tlie complexities anil hard realities of adult life. Thus the Church's first
mi«sion to the campus is In help people moving to adulthood, sometimes
with much difficulty and pain, to take their place in a maturely adidl world
intellectually, socially, maritally, and religiously.
TO NON-CHURCHMEN
i ... the Church'* mission is to hriug a strong and relevant way of life.
The mission is to present persuasively and attractively the truth of God
| in Jesus Christ, and the life of the Church which honors and serves that
truth . . . truth ahout God, about man in all his relationships, as given in
Christ. In a world where truth has become competitive, where all kinds
of truth are spread before a student cafeteria-style, the. Church has a mission
to the mind!
