Our engineers talk to
horses. And, this horse talks back!
He's Blaze™—the talking hobby horse
whose legs move realistically as he gal
lops, Lucks and rears. Nobody had ever
made such an animal before, so our
R&D people had to solve lots of inter
esting new problems in the process —
like developing the linkage and springs
that make this bronc perform with
equal enthusiasm whether his rider
Weighs 35 lbs. or 70, while simultane
ously licking stress and fatigue prob
lems similar in scope to those found in
aircraft design.
It's stimulating work. Technically
Challenging. Not only in K&D, but in
manufacturing and administration,too.
And, most rewarding —in terms of
both salary and satisfaction. Wheel
spinning is kept to a minimum and a
surprising number of the ideas our
'people propose end up in production.
Maybe because so many have bien good
ideas —that are reflected in products
selling at a rate demanding that wc
substantially increase our engineer
ing stalT, again, to keep up with our
growth. This opens up some choice
spots for men particularly interested
in finding ways to make things simpler,
better and cheaper.
Consider the possibility of coming to
work at our facilities near the Los
Angeles International Airport and of
raising your family in one of the
pleasant beach or valley communities
nearby. To find out more, see our pro
fessional employment interviewer — on
campus — soon.
