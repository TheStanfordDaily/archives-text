## Nikita Says Convoy Blockade Set Up to Test West's 'Nerve' 
### 
MOSCOW Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev (old a group of
Americans yesterday the Soviet Union deliberately blocked a Berlin
bound U.S. convoy for two days to "test your nerves" and s;iid war
could have broken out if the Americans had tried to break through.
Khrushchev said that if the U.S. Army had tried to force its mili
tary convoy through the Soviet armored blockade on the Autobahn,
it would have had to roll "over our dead bodies."
"When you decided to test our nerves, we decided in response
to put our armored cars across the Autobahn to test your nerves
and see if you would start shooting or not." Khrushchev said. "And
we are very glad you didn't." The Soviet premier, speaking with a
group of U.S. corporation executives in the Kremlin, also said Rus
sia has not given up on its moon launch program and warned that
the "time had passed" when the United States could feel secure
against war on the other side of the ocean."

The estimated returns gave Aaron Henry 90,000 votes in the
.Vloek election lor governor, according to AUard K. Lowenstein.
The actual count last night was 74,(540 with returns still uncounted
from eight towns and mailed ballots. The winner of the official
gubernatorial election received votes with 833 of the state's
precincts reported.

HOUSE PASSES COLLEGE BILL WASHINGTON The House
yesterday approved a $1.2 billion college construction program.
Senate passage would make the bill the first major education mea
sure to clear Congress this session. The compromise legislation
worked out by House-Senate conferees would authorize a three year
program of federal grants and loans for the construction of college
classrooms, libraries and laboratories.
The vote was 27)8 lo 92. There was no opposing debate and the
votes against it were cast by Southern Democrats and conservative
Republicans. The construction proposal was part of President Ken
nedy's $5 billion omnibus education program, most of which stands
little chance of enactment this year.

to put our armored cars across the Autobahn to test your nerves
and see if you would start shooting or not." Khrushchev said. "And
we are very glad you didn't." The Soviet premier, speaking with a
group of U.S. corporation executives in the Kremlin, also said Rus
