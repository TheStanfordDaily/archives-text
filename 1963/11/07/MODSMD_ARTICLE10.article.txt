# Aid for Students In South Offered
## 
### 
The Seven Sister Colleges have
I decided to join the Ivy League in
I a "talent search program" for
students from economically de
pressed areas, the "Harvard Crim
son" reported recently.
White and Negro students, pri
i marily in the South, will be ap
| proached by representatives of
the Northern colleges who will
stress the liberal arts opportuni
ties available in the North and
| will offer financial aid to quali-
I fied applicants, according to Mar
| garet E. Stimpson, Radcliffe Col-
J lege Director of Admissions.
Charles E. McCarthy, Jr., assist
| ant admissions director of Yale
and supervisor of the program.
I met with representatives of the
Seven Sister Colleges recently.
The colleges will provide Mc-
Carthy with the specific admis
sions qualifications of each of
the schools so that during hi s
I interviews, he will be able to
recommend particular institutions
I to interested students.
Students from economically de
j pressed Southern areas, the
i "Crimson" stated, are rarely en
i eouraged by their guidance coun
' selors to apply to state or local
J colleges. Often, Northern col
leges, an d particularly, Ivy
League institutions, are automati
! cally ruled out as being geo
: graphically and financially inac
i cessible.
Many students, the article con-
I tinues, are not aware of the fi
â€¢ nancial aid available for needy,
qualified students. Applications
; from normally inactive areas will
increase considerably, it is hoped,
if students are informed of the
I aid.
