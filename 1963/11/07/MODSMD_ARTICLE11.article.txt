# Hong Kong Student Project Aims toward Understanding
## 
### MIKE MILLIGAN 
(Editor's Note: This is (he
last in a series of articles oil a
World University Serviee work
project in Hong Kong- that
twenty-four Stanford men com
pleted this summer.)
The second group of eight men
in the project lived at the Haven
of Hope tuberculosis sanitorium
near the town of Rennie's Mill
(hence their group name, the 'Mil
lers') in Hong Kong's New Terri
tories.
Their main job was construc
tion. and they laid concrete at a
fantastic rate. They lifted some
eighty-five tons of concrete three
times and taught English to chil
dren and the nurses of the sani
torium on the side. Probably the
most unusual achievement of this
group was made by Tom Fox,
who taught his class of kinder
garten-aged children to march
around the room singing "Robin
Hood."
THIS HARD WORKING group
even developed its own language,
employing terms like 'DC'
iDouble Cola, the only thing that
kept them from dehydration) on
a 'ME' (Maximum Effort) day.
They slept on a cement floor and
ate food that was at best plain,
but they had an unmatched group
spirit.
The rest of the 'stalwarts' were
scattered around the colony on
everything from work camps to
independent relief work. Two of
them. Mars Blois and Net Payne,
spent their time aboard Project
Concern, a floating clinic run by
Dr. James Turpin. This clinic is
the only medical care available
to thousands of people who live
on junks in the city's teeming
Typhoon Harbor.
Dr. Turpin also ran a clinic in
Kowloon's Walled City, an area
of disputed jurisdiction where law
enforcement is light and forms of
vice like opium dens exist almost
openly. Narrow, cavelike pas
sages that are sometimes nearly
pitch black are the only streets
in the Walled Citv. and the onlv

that run along the passages.
lIEKE WE watched hundreds
of children line up at the clinic
door to be run through an assem
bly line where they had a vitamin
pill put into their mouth, got a
glass of reconstituted milk, and
were handed two highly enriched
crackers. This uncomplicated
treatment gave these children a
large part of their normal week's
nourishment.
We found that WUS has an
amazingly difficult job to do in
Hong Kong where the educa
tional system is sadly inadequate
and where those few students
bright enough to continue their
studies arc often unable to do so
for a variety of reasons.
BEING NATURALLY curious
about Communist China, we spent
as much time as we could speak
ing with refugees from it. We
were searching for the 'truth'
about what China is like today,
but we.found that among the
refugees there were as many dif
ferent opinions as we ourselves
had. Some of them hated th e
Communists and others preferred
them to the Nationalists because
they were 'less corrupt.' They
even differed on whether there
was political suppression or not;
and while all said material condi
tions were bad some thought they
were better than before the* take
over. It was confusing.
What we hoped to accomplish
which simple donations can't do
was to bring about a meeting and
a certain amount of understand
ing between two widely separated
peoples. We certainly profited
from the trip in an increased un
dersanding of what the rest of
the world is like and in experi
ence at working with people. We
hope that the people we came in
contact with also benefited, and
judging from the moving farewell
ceremony we had at the airport
it seems that we managed to
make some sort of contact.
We hope to continue the project
even expand it to include other
countries and hopefully make
