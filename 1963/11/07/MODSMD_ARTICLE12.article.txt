# Lost Human Value Crime Of Racism Says Griffith

### JANE SOKOLOW 
"We must decide whether to be pro-white, pro-Negro, or pro
human." said John Griffith last night in his speech on "The Negro
and the White Conscious" to a crowded audience. The most heinous
crime evolving from the problem of racism is the destruction of
human value, he said.
In 1959 Mr. Griffith was asked to do research study on the prob-

lem of why there was such a high
suicide rate in the South, among
Negroes. After questioning Nc
roes and whites, he concluded
that there was no communication
between the two groups.
NKGKOKS who opposed the
whites were called "uppity and
arrogant." No dissension was
tolerated, Griffith said; however,
he added, the whites claim, "We
enjoy wonderfully harmonious
relations with the Negroes." "Ne
groes do not trust whites with
truths lhat can be used against
them, and so the only answer was
to travel as a Negro to see the
situation for myself," said Grif
fith.
Consequently, Griffith, ap
proved by the FBI. had his pig
ment darkened and shaved his
head so that he would look like
a Negro.
Griffith described his journey
to the South. "The profoundest
shock was that I had to plan not
where I wanted to go, but where
1 could go to avoid having to go
inordinate distances to satisfy
my physical needs," he said. The
result he explained was that he
as a Negro was constantly pie
occupied with animal instincts;
his mind was not free to dwell
on what he wished.
Tin; Til KICK questions Negroes
always ask each other, he stated,
are "why, what sense does it
make, what good does it do them
to make it like this for us?"
"We were always accorded
courtesies." Griffith added, "but
all the courtesies in the world
don't make up for the fact that*
the Negroes are penalized for
their pigment and that they
aren't allowed to live up to full
human dignity."
"This wonderfully harmonious
relationship which the whites
claim exists, is that which one
has with an animal beaten into
subjugation," he excla i m e d.
Griffith concluded his speech
by describing the death and mar
tyrdom of the Negro's great epic
hero, Clyde Canard, who was im
prisoned and sentenced to hard
labor, in order to prevent him
from enrolling in a university in
Southern Mississippi.
