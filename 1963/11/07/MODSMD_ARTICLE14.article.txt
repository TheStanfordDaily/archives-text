MISSISSIPPI
Editor, The Daily:
For those of you who h av e
never been to Mississippi: it is
not all Yoknapatawpha County;
it is not all rednecks, poor whites
and decadent gentry. There are
many of us from and in Missis
sippi who are embarrassed by the
treatment of the Negroes in Mis
sissippi. There are those of us,
in the South, who feel a sincere
compassion for the Negro. We
detest the unpleasantness re
ported in every news medium we
pick up. We wish we could be
literate and responsible and while
being so, not be reminded of our
irresponsible apathy to the in
justices being done. We wish we
could enjoy the lovely, genteel
traditions of the southern way
of life without involving our
selves in the ugly traditions re
garding the Negro's "place" in
the southern way of life. We wish
we could carry on the tradition
of rocking away our lives on our
screened front porches, discuss
ing the heat because nothing
more important needs to be said.
We wish we could, but we can't
any longer.
Because of incidents like th e
freedom balloting, or the demon
strations in Oxford, Birmingham,
and Washington, or simply be
cause of basic regard for our
brothers, we can't deny an aware
ness of the realities of the Ne
gro's situation. We need to have
outsiders come in and "agitate."
Obviously nothing from within
has caused us to foe the Ameri
cans we would like to think we
are. We need the wisdom and
guidance of leaders whom we can
respect.
We have been slapped in the
face by a need for action to help
human beings. But we, out of
habit—to avoid "unpleasantness"
have turned the other cheek and
we now feel the sickening thud
of our own torpor. And what will
we do?
We'll talk But hopefully our j
talk will leave the confines of j
our front porches. Hopefully,!
we'll search our consciences and |
our resources and achieve some j
meaningfulness. Hopefully our
talks wil be less theoretical, less,
a circular rehashing of hackneyed :
observations, less futile. We must i
make public gestures and risk
whatever malcontent our friends j
and relatives exact. We must see
to it that our fellow southerners
work toward a better understand- j
ing of themselves — and hope |
that someday "themselves" will
tru 1 y include Negroes AND
whites, together.
There is the argument that
" 'outsiders' can't possibly under- j
stand." Surely it is because they I
don't understand that they feel
behooved to help the Negro . . . j
and incidentally, to help the'
whites. Social critics have accu- j
rately described the motives of;
the southern whites who harass
the Negro and feel justified (e.g.,
"Why ... it says right here in
the Bible . . ."). Nevertheless, we
feel there is "no excuse" for the
despicable behavior of these fool
lish, danger ou s southerners.
Please don't exonerate the mod
erates simply because they seem
to be in an irresolute conflicl.
There is no excuse for the likes
of me, either.
We who believe in human rights
but do nothing are as deserving
of scorn as those who obviously j
haven't thought about it but who :
are causing the world to believe j
that no one in the south has any ;
real concern for his fellow man.
Some of us—perhaps most of us j
—feel a deep concern. Now we,!
too, must do something about it.!

WHAT COLOR ARE YOU?
Editor, The Daily:
At one time or another, a small
group discussion of color differ
ences comes to the top of all the
other chaotic or misunderstood
situations in our basket of na
tional problems, and I would like
to express my opinion in a kind
of poetic form as to why one of
a dark group of people must logi
cally come under the term "col
ored" rather than "negro." The
word negro meaning "black" can
not possibly apply to one who is
brown or lighter, nor can white
apply to one of the lightest com
plexion. We all have color an d
are therefore "colored" people.
This opinion is primarily for
the benefit of darker complexion
people who seem to be offended
by the use of the term "negr
versus "colored." How can one
be "proud" to be black or white
when either of these is a color.
F<kkl for thought?
ON COLOR BLINDNESS
If I'm a black man and you're a
white man
We're colorless as can be.
But, if I'm a deep brown and
you're rather pink,
There's color in you and me.
If black is no color and neither
is white

I We must take a logical view.
Let's say we're all "colored" men
dark or light
and the difference lies only in
lute.
"Negro" means black, and black
being colorless
makes negro inadequate too,
For there's no logic in calling me
black
If I'm also colored like you.
Brown is the basic color of our
skin
and we're all different hues of it,
So quit fretting my friend about
the color you are,
The lamp of knowledge is lit.
Light skin turns brown under the
summer sun,
and brown skin turns light when
bleached.
As the light get darker and the
dark get lighter,
a happy medium is reached.
When colors are blended and dif
ferences so few
That destruction comes to
bigotry,
Humanity will cherish and never
forget
Its attainment of lasting dignity.
—ROBERT O. JOHNSON
Anatomy
WELFARE STATE
Editor, The Daily:
Opinion expresed by Mi*. Taylor
in his letter on the welfare state
shows that he has completely
missed the point on conservative
objections to the welfare state.
Taking the liberty to speak for
at least some conservatives, I
would say that we object to the
national welfare state because it
places tremendous power into the
hands of the federal government.
We believe that such power, when
it falls into the hands of an un
scrupulous person, would under
mine individual freedom in the
United States. We believe that it
would be better for state and
local governments to assume
more of the welfare (with an em
phasis on habilitation) work that
admittedly needs to be done.
Liberals do not seem to have
this mistrust of a powerful cen
tral government. Let us admit
that history alone will tell who is
right.
In the meantime, we can hope
that both liberals and conserva
tives will learn to discuss with
one another on basic beliefs and
not misconstrue each other's opin
ions to be steeped with unhu
manitarian feelings.

HEALTH SERVICE
Editor, The Daily:
As a graduate student living
among other graduate students
from various foreign countries,
I have detected a serious flaw in
Stanford's fine image amongst
our friends from other lands. Al
most with one voice they com
plain of Stanford's Health Serv
ice. The treatment is impersonal,
aloof and quite unsettling.
It seems to me that we are liv
ing in an age where we must be
zealous of how we speak and act
to the educated elite of other
countries. The newspapers con
stantly attest to the importance
of having friends. Supposedly,
the whole idea of the Peace
Corps, which Stanford has just
hosted for a week, is another ex
pression of this same thought.
What is required is for the
Health Service to realize the fact
that people, who perhaps are far
from home and in a different cli
mate, often pamper themselves
and are looking for simple and
kind attention to their common
colds, sore throats and other
minor ailments. It is in small
kindnesses at this level that the
greatness of a university is seen
and in which we can impress our
foreign friends with our sincerity
and warmth. It is a shame to see
the university's reputation fail
at this point especially when she
has so conseieneiously succeeded
in ntoher areas in which she deals
with people.

DANGEROUS MORALITY
Editor, The Daily:
I certainly appreciate the gen
erosity of Mr. Lambert, for it is
not often that a person is willing
to share his Messianic vision with
the world at large. However, I
think that what Mr. Lambert
shares is painfully simple-minded.
Although he assumes that a ra
tional control of impulse is neces
sary, he argues that college stu
dents would be better off with an
unfettered instinct; to act ration
ally and morally is to "drain
away all real life," at least for
inexperienced s t u d en t s. He
equates "real life" with "natural
ness," justifying a behavior which
he admits is imperfect. God help
us if very many should accept
such reasoning! It is obvious to
me that "time" will never "wear
away the irrelevant;" the irrele
vant (by which he seems to mean
uncontrolled behavior) is elimi
nated only by a conscious effort
to control oneself in light of pre
cise moral judgment. One doesn't
just sit around without any prin
ciples for thirty years, and then
wake up one morning to find that
a glorious maturity has blos
somed in the night. Neither ex
perience, nor self-knowledge, are
good in themselves. Mr. L a m
bert has found a dangerous posi
tion, a morality which allows him
to do whatever he pleases while

maintaining the personal illusion
of correct behavior.
The wisdom proper to youth,
and to everybody for that matter,
is the ability to recognize the
blatant irresponsibility and lull
ing deception of such arguments.
While Mr. Lambert is gulping his
experience and waiting for time
to bring his maturity, some of us
will realize that man is not natu
rally good, and that true self
knowledge is founded on this
recognition.
Perhaps Mr. Lambert's problem
is one of source: young French
girls are not particularly dis
tinguished in the field of moral
guidance.

STUDENT TRAVEL CENTER
Editor, The Daily:
The Student Travel Center, as
proposed by Ed Shaw, would be
of benefit to students and staff
alike, it would ideally serve the
student by organizing flights and
tours to Europe and elsewhere
with the OK of the ASSU and the
University.
The Travel Center should be
set" up in Tresidder or so m e
other such central location and
would offer complete travel in
formation, special plans an d
planes for the student traveller.
The student could travel under
plans directly organized by the
Center, but the Center would also
have material available on stu
dent ships or other plans set up
outside the University. The NSA
ETI, which handles student ID's,
hostels, and ground travel infor
mation abroad, and the SOIS
which has a good library on
study, work. etc. abroad might,
also be incorporated within the
Center so as to offer a broader
spectrum of information.
The vacation flights this Christ
mas are an example where such
a central source of information
would be useful. There are char
ter flights, group flights, prop or
jet flights, but is there no one lo
cation where the student may
speak to the organizers, find out
full information, or pay for his
ticket conveniently. It is certainly
outside the jurisdiction of the
Daily to even attempt this. The
student might still select the plan
best suited to him and his funds
be it by charter (by calling YO 7-
4969>, group (by calling the
Business Manager of the Daily)
or full fare (by calling a travel
agent).
