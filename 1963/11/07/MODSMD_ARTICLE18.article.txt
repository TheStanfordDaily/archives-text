### JOHN CALMORE 
The USC Trojans are looking
for their sixth straight victory
over the Indians this Saturday
afternoon in the Los Angeles
Coliseum. For Southern Cal, to
win this game is a must if they
are to stay in the race for t lie
roses.
Washington, in heating USC
22-7 last Saturday, knocked the
1962 Big Six Champions down
from the top of the list of fa-

vorite Rose Bowl candidates. A
loss to Stanford would practi
cally remove them from it com
pletely.
TOMMY'S TROJANS are seek
ing their fifth win of the season,
having lost three and tied none.
The Washington game was costly
in more ways than one, for Pete
Beat hard, SC's starting quarter
back, is now a doubtful starter
due to injuries received last Sat
urday. The signal-calling duties
will be taken over by Craig Fer
tig, a 6-1, 176 pound junior.
The Trojans are expected to

show the Indians a very versatile
offense with running hacks Wil
lie Brown and Mike Garret lead
ing the ground attack, while
Brown and Ail-American end Hal
Bedsole handle most of the pass
catching.
Garret, a sophomore, is the top
ball carrier in the Big Six, rush
ing for 348 net yards and averag
ing a spectacular 8.3 yards per
carry. lie also has two touch
downs to his credit. The 5-9, IS2
pounder has returned seven punts
for 68 yards, and also leads SC
in this department.
STOPPING GARRET, how
ever, is only part of Stanford's
problems in holding the Trojan
offense. Brown, his running mate,
is one of the most dangerous
breakaway runners in the confer
ence. As a pass catcher, Brown
leads the Big Six. receiving 16
passes for 240 yards.
Bedsole has seven receptions
for 136 yards and one touchdown.
Along with his seven passes
caught, he has dropped six. Fer
tig has completed three out of
ten for 37 yards, while Beathard
has 38 completions in 90 attempts
for f>B7 yards and three touch
downs.
LEADING THE defense will
be last year's All-American, line
backer Damon Bame. Adding to
the strength at the linebaeking
spot is Ernie Pye and Anno San

ehez. The Southern Cal lino Is
boosted by Gary Kirner (213),
Mac Byrd (196), Mike Giers
(22.1), Pete Lubisieh (210), and
Larry Sagauspe (224). The de
dense has given up only 47 points
in SC's seven games.
