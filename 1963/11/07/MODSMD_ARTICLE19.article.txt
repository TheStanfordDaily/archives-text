# Hooters Meet Cal Saturday
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team,
washed out of a tentative game
at San Jose State yesterday, will
travel to meet the Spartans in
stead next Tuesday, Nov. 12, in
an 8:00 game played under the
lights at San Jose.
The immediate challenge for
undefeated In d i a n s, however,
comes this Saturday when they
take on the California Bears at
Berkeley, now in ihird place in
the Nor-Cal conference standings
and always a power to be reck
oned with.
THIS WILL mark the second
meeting between the teams this
year, Stanford winning the first
in an exciting 2-1 squeaker. Since
then Cal has shown improvement,
and. last week, whipped a tough
San Francisco State squad.
Coach Priddle said that the
slow soccer field at Berkeley
could "give Cal an advantage be
cause it might detract from our
edge in speed." The frosh an d
junior varsity squads will also
make the trip to face their Cal
counterparts.
