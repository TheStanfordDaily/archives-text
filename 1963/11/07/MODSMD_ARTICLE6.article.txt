### TONY TUFT 
"Whats wrong with Capitalism"
was the subject of a talk given
last night by Arlon Taussing,
Associate Professor of Economics
at San Francisco State College.
His talk was sponsored by the
Socialist Caucus of the Political
Union.
Professor Taussing's discussion
was centered on the social abuses
and injustices that are allowed
to exist under Capitalism, an d
which cannot be dealt with effec
tively unless this economic sys
tem is transformed. "The tough
est housing law." he contended,
"Won't eliminate urban ghettos
unless a socialistic government
can make low-cost housing is.iO
s6o per month) readily available;
and no amount of liberal rhetoric
will encourage white workers 1o
accept Negro or orientals to com
pote with them if there are not
enough jobs available for th e
whites."
RKLATFD to these are the
staggering problems presented
by the chronically depressed
areas, which cannot offer the in
habitants the training necessary
to find employment, since their
school systems are so precari
ously financed. Nor is there any
existing means of identifying
these educationally handicapped
until they have joined the swell
ing ranks of the unemployed.
"These abuses," he was care
ful to add, "are not intrinsically
capitalistic." The capitalisms of
Western Europe, France, Ger
many and Italy are enjoying un
precedented prosperity and con
trast sharply with the socialist
nations of the East whose reser
voirs of unemployment continue
to grow.
IX Till; United States, how
ever. the popular commitment to
laissez-faire economics as well as
the over-representation of vested
interests in government make
solutions to these pressing prob
lems remote indeed. The ideal
istic elements in American so
ciety, the social workers, journa
ists and liberals are aware of
the problems, but their proposals
are neither socialist nor work
able.
