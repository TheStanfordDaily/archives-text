# ‘Hamlet’ by Stanford Players Offers Uneven Dramatic Performance
## 
### FOSTER HIRSCH Drama Editor 
Shakespeare's "Hamlet" has provided a seemingly in
exhaustible framework within which several centuries of
critics have dutifully labored. Each new generation has in
turn imposed its own values and techniques of criticism
upon the play and its central character. By means of this
endless critical continuum, Hamlet has come to signify
practically all things to all men.
For an actor to attempt to play Hamlet, therefore, is
almost as presumptuous and sacrilegious a task as a dra
matic interpretation ol Christ. It is simply impossible for
any actor to give to his Hamlet the stature and magnitude
which volumes of perceptive criticism have lavished upon
him. Moreover, it is much less demanding to resolve the
complexities of Hamlet in a rigorous literary exigesis than
it is to bring him to life within the comparatively limited
devices of the actor.
JOHN KERR is thus courageous in embarking upon
such a thankless task; that he is ultimately unable to em
body Hamlet, try as he may, is not therefore altogether his
own fault. Significantly, Kerr's performance is uneven,
which indicates that he does at various moments actually
come to terms with his character. His very best moment,
surprisingly, is his very first moment: in dark clothes, he
sits apart from the colorful court. His facial expression
and his posture suggest immediately his predilection to
gloom and sorrow, his introspection, his cynical distaste
for the life about him, and his alienation; Kerr even indi
cates in his movements that certain indecisiveness which
is to plague him the rest of his days. Physically then Kerr
conveys an intensity suitable to his character's search for
truth. Unfortunately, Kerr does not adequately pursue
each of these threads of his character. He is, however,
thoroughly at ease with Hamlet's cynicism; when called

upon to be sarcastic, he is most impressive. Likewise, Kerr
makes Hamlet's utter displeasure with the world palpable
enough, but he is at a loss when he atempts to portray
sorrow. To suggest tears and to communicate the depth
of his grief he employs two dramatic devices the insuffi
ciencies of which reinforce each other all too forcibly: lie
shrieks in piercing tones of feigned anguish and he snivels
like a whining child. Nonetheless, Kerr works up an atmos
phere of chaos and manages to convey a sense of Hamlet's
mental imprisonment; inevitably, though, he keeps Ham
let's sufferings on the surface, and that interiority so much
a part of Hamlet's character is lost among the theatrical
flourishes.
All told, the parts of Kerr's performance build reason
ably well to that point in which the plot has him removed
to a ship bound for England. Regrettably, he is off-stage
for an inordinately long time; when he returns, we have
lost the thread of his character's progression and Hamlet
appears to be a stranger. Since at this point Kerr seems
to lose interest in the proceedings, our task of re-acquaint
ance is made considerably difficult. Consequently, Hamlet
diminishes to such an extent that his death is very small
indeed.
TECHNICALLY speaking, Kerr has an exceedingly in
teresting voice; there is about it a harshness and sibilance
which is theatrically quite effective. The inflexibility of
his voice, however, gives a monotony to his interpretation.
His sense of timing is often deficient (though his pregnant
pause before his 'to be or not to be" speech works enorm
ously well); he seems generally uncomfortable in the
rhythms of the Shakespearean idiom. Ii is his gestures
which most obviously betray his insecurity; they are uni
formly stiff and ill-motivated.
The supporting cast, faced with roles infinitely less de
manding, fare somewhat better. Robert Loper as Claudius

succeeds in capturing the hypocrisy of ;i man forced to
play a role; wisely his Claudius is never allowed to become
a deep-dyed villian. Indeed, the altar scene in which he
reveals his spiritual suffocation is a superlative piece of
acting. His studiously worked-out movements, although
valid for his character, nevertheless call too much atten
tion to themselves. Edna Clark's Gertrude is perhaps
more amusing than she should be, but her performance is
assuredly first-rate. At first she is haughty and calculat
ing; after her confrontation with Hamlet, Miss Clark gen
erously unfolds such deeper layers of her character as
her love for her son and her horror at the indiscretions
she has committed. In the scene between her and Hamlet,
the intensity of her shrieks nearly shakes the balcony off
its hinges. Mark Hammer is altogether assured as Po
lonius; pompous, obtuse, yet wise in his own bumbling
way. Linda Bishop's competent Ophelia does not really
hold together only because Ophelia is not well-developed
by Shakespeare; her insanity intrudes upon us much too
quickly. The effect of Miss Bishop's quite good mad scene
is augmented by her clear, lovely soprano voice which she
cracks at just the right moment. Conrad Bishop, in the
enthusiasm and action which he musters as Laertes, offers
a tolling contrast to the plodding Hamlet. Philip N. Angc
loff's Horatio is a bit too unobtrusive, and Sean Cunning
ham as Rosencrantz and Lars Kampmann as Guildenstern
suggest here and there that they might be good some other
time.
IN ADDITION to the good supporting cast, there are
four very small parts which are extraordinarily well
played. Albert Novikoff miraculously doubles as the Ghost
and the Player King. His work in both instances is un
speakably good. Susan Leich's Player Queen is a breath
of fresh air; Miss Leich. in addition to the crystalline
beauty of her voice, has such grace and poise that she

appears to be performing in a ballet. Indeed, the play
within-a-play sequence is much the best scene in the pro
duction; it captures a real feeling of the period, and the
players' deliberately exaggerated movements mirror the
pretense within which the main characters move. Bill
Louis' gravedigger, although he comes too near the end
of a long evening to be fully appreciated, is very fine, as
is Bruce Salvatore's vastly amusing dandy.
NORMAN PHI I-BRICK'S direction has balance and he
has scrupulously staged the presentation with an eye to
symmetry. He handles the play's alternating moods well,
but he has allowed the pace to taper off toward the end.
Ideally, the play of course should build in intensity toward
an overpowering climax. Here the play starts fortissimo
and diminishes steadily to a dull thud in the singularly un
moving climax, despite its convincing fencing sequence
and the symmetry of the numerous dead bodies carefully
arranged on the tiers of the set piece.
Douglas Russell's costumes are perhaps more appropri
ate to "The Day Lincoln Was Shot" than to Shakespeare,
but they certainly are elegant. Holmes Easley is respon
sible for the functional, exceedingly unattractive set which
at once evokes a sense of mystery and deterioration. The
flag-like effect which he has achieved in his poles is inven
tive and lends itself easily to either interior or exterior
scenes. Derek Hunt's lighting is admirably restrained,
especially considering the temptations which "Hamlet"
offers for tour de force lighting effects. Mr. Hunt uses
his lighting to conservatively highlight the moods of par
ticular scenes. The cathedral-like ray of light at the end
produces an inspired moment. Too, the few brief musical
interludes provide charm and atmosphere.
The Stanford Players' production of "Hamlet" con
tinues in Memorial Auditorium tonight and tomorrow
night with a matinee performance tomorrow.
