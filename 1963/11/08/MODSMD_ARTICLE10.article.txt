# SU Biologists Chart Volcano
## 
### 
Stanford's floating biology
classroom, the schooner Te Vega,
helped chart a submarine volcano
; while cruising through the World
War II battleground of Guadal
canal last month.
As a result, the volcano has
been named the Te Vega Sea
' mount. It lies near Vangunu
j Island in the New Georgia group
| in the northern Solomons.
John C. Grover, chief geologist
; of the Department of Geological
Surveys on the island, guided the
expedition toward a spot in the
ocean near the south shore of
Vangunu, where in 1960 ho photo
i graphed a small, new-born vol
i cano.
It had since died and disap
! peared, he told Prof. Rolf Bolin,
: chief scientist of the Te Vega,
, who is professor of marine biol
' ogy at Stanford's Hopkins Marine
: Station at Pacific Grove.
But a recent earthquake led
Grover to believe the volcano was
j active again. This prompted the
I successful search.
