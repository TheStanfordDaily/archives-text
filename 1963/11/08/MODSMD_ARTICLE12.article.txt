# SU Workers Tell of White Terror in Mock Election
## 
### BILL MOORE Staff Editor 
No matter where they went among Mississippi's Negro popula
tion last week, 13 Stanford students found themselves up against a
towering obstacle:
Fear.
That was the story the returning students all volunteers in the

Negro mock election campaign- ■
told a press conference at Tresid
der yesterday. And it was a story
chilling enough to make a Ten
nessee Williams script look like
the account of a Sunday school
picnic.
"The white down there had a
reign of terror over the Negroes,"
said Frank Dubofsky, a senior
Political Science major, who
worked iti the southern part of
the state.
"When we talked to the Ne
groes, their eyes lit up like silver
dollars; and you could see they
were frightened to death to he
talking to us. The whites say the
Negroes re happy but if this
is happiness, I'd hate to see
people sad."
Dubofsky continued:
"The older Negroes were th e
most fearful. I remember trying
to get a 75-year-old Negro lady
in Picayune to cast a mock bal
lot. She said, 'We're just nigger
folk. We can't vote.' To think of
the degradation of this -living 75
years feeling that way."
Holt Ruffin, a sophomore Poli
tical Science major, was eon
fronted with similar problems
working in the northeastern part
of the state. Upon visiting the all-
Negro West Point College, he
was told by its Negro president
that students would have to be
expelled if they joined the Aaron
Henry for Governor campaign.
"The hands of these educators
were tied," explained Ruffin.
"They are under the control of
the all-white state Board of Edu
cation."
Ruffin said Negro merchants
balked at requests to allow bal

►
j loting on their property for fear
! of economic reprisal from the
whites. "Their attitude." he
I pointed out, "was one of. 'You can
j leave, but we have to live here
i with these people."
Hugh Smith, a senior Philoso-
I phy major, encountered this
; same fear in his talks with Ne
| groes in the Oxford area.
"Everywhere we went we were
followed by policemen," he said.
"Faculty members at Ole Miss
and even ministers said they
I couldn't help us. We had to ask
people to sneak ballots to us."
While driving through one com
munity, Smith was fired upon by
I an irate townsman.
"1 felt something zinging by my
i arm just outside the car," he re
lated, "Then 1 .saw dust shoot-
I ing up. si) 1 stomped on the gas
j and took off like I never took
; off before. . . . When I looked
back. I saw someone with a gun."
Dennis Sweeney, a junior His
tory major, alleged that it was
"this climate of fear" that kept
many Negroes from voting. But,
he added, there were others fac
| tors, too- like the $3 poll tax, the
ultra-rigorous Constitutional ex
ams (designed for Negro use
onlyt and the "good moral judg
ments" made by the election offi
cials.
Sweeney said the results of the
mock election in which candi
date Henry polled almost 100,000
1 Negro votes, topping both the
I official Democratic and GOP
! contenders convinced him that
| "the Negroes there really want to
| vote, but we must give them
! moral support."
But Fred Goff. a junior major
| ing in Political Science, pointed
; out that the campaign workers
j were continually experiencing "a
I tremendous sense of futility in
| that state."
Continued Goff: "It's like but
j ting your head against a brick
wall. However, you can't imagine
the effect, the morale boosting at
the rallies when we told the Ne
' groes that Stanford was donating
$1,000 a day or that two Yale
j student were being jailed.
I think this helped to keep
i things bi-racial, which is import
ant."
j Other Stanford students who
I participated in the campaign
were Lawrence Deßivort, Jeff
Dennis-Straethmeyer. Ken Ivor
son. Jr., Stephen Lesser, Terry
Taketa, Anson Garnsey, Tony
King and George Maentz.
All had returned to Stanford by
Wednesday night.

Holt Ruffin, a sophomore Poli
tical Science major, was eon
fronted with similar problems
working in the northeastern part
of the state. Upon visiting the all-
Negro West Point College, he
was told by its Negro president
that students would have to be
expelled if they joined the Aaron
Henry for Governor campaign.
"The hands of these educators
were tied," explained Ruffin.
"They are under the control of
the all-white state Board of Edu

Ruffin said Negro merchants
balked at requests to allow bal

j loting on their property for fear
! of economic reprisal from the
whites. "Their attitude." he
I pointed out, "was one of. 'You can

i with these people."
Hugh Smith, a senior Philoso-
I phy major, encountered this
; same fear in his talks with Ne

"Everywhere we went we were
followed by policemen," he said.
"Faculty members at Ole Miss
and even ministers said they
I couldn't help us. We had to ask
people to sneak ballots to us."
While driving through one com

I an irate townsman.
"1 felt something zinging by my

lated, "Then 1 .saw dust shoot-

j and took off like I never took

back. I saw someone with a gun."
Dennis Sweeney, a junior His
tory major, alleged that it was
"this climate of fear" that kept
many Negroes from voting. But,
he added, there were others fac
| tors, too- like the $3 poll tax, the
ultra-rigorous Constitutional ex
ams (designed for Negro use
onlyt and the "good moral judg
ments" made by the election offi
cials.
Sweeney said the results of the
mock election in which candi
date Henry polled almost 100,000
1 Negro votes, topping both the
I official Democratic and GOP
! contenders convinced him that

But Fred Goff. a junior major

; out that the campaign workers
j were continually experiencing "a
I tremendous sense of futility in

Continued Goff: "It's like but

wall. However, you can't imagine
the effect, the morale boosting at
the rallies when we told the Ne
' groes that Stanford was donating
$1,000 a day or that two Yale

"Everywhere we went we were
followed by policemen," he said.
"Faculty members at Ole Miss
and even ministers said they
I couldn't help us. We had to ask
people to sneak ballots to us."
While driving through one com
munity, Smith was fired upon by
I an irate townsman.
"1 felt something zinging by my
i arm just outside the car," he re
lated, "Then 1 .saw dust shoot-
I ing up. si) 1 stomped on the gas
j and took off like I never took
; off before. . . . When I looked
back. I saw someone with a gun."
Dennis Sweeney, a junior His
tory major, alleged that it was
"this climate of fear" that kept
many Negroes from voting. But,
he added, there were others fac
| tors, too- like the $3 poll tax, the
ultra-rigorous Constitutional ex
ams (designed for Negro use
onlyt and the "good moral judg
ments" made by the election offi
cials.
Sweeney said the results of the
mock election in which candi
date Henry polled almost 100,000
1 Negro votes, topping both the
I official Democratic and GOP
! contenders convinced him that
| "the Negroes there really want to
| vote, but we must give them
! moral support."
But Fred Goff. a junior major
| ing in Political Science, pointed
; out that the campaign workers
j were continually experiencing "a
I tremendous sense of futility in
| that state."
Continued Goff: "It's like but
j ting your head against a brick
wall. However, you can't imagine
the effect, the morale boosting at
the rallies when we told the Ne
' groes that Stanford was donating
$1,000 a day or that two Yale
j student were being jailed.
I think this helped to keep
i things bi-racial, which is import
ant."
j Other Stanford students who
I participated in the campaign
were Lawrence Deßivort, Jeff
Dennis-Straethmeyer. Ken Ivor
son. Jr., Stephen Lesser, Terry
Taketa, Anson Garnsey, Tony
King and George Maentz.
All had returned to Stanford by
Wednesday night.
No matter where they went among Mississippi's Negro popula
tion last week, 13 Stanford students found themselves up against a
towering obstacle:
Fear.
That was the story the returning students all volunteers in the

Negro mock election campaign- ■
told a press conference at Tresid
der yesterday. And it was a story
chilling enough to make a Ten
nessee Williams script look like
the account of a Sunday school
picnic.
"The white down there had a
reign of terror over the Negroes,"
said Frank Dubofsky, a senior
Political Science major, who
worked iti the southern part of
the state.
"When we talked to the Ne
groes, their eyes lit up like silver
dollars; and you could see they
were frightened to death to he
talking to us. The whites say the
Negroes re happy but if this
is happiness, I'd hate to see
people sad."
Dubofsky continued:
"The older Negroes were th e
most fearful. I remember trying
to get a 75-year-old Negro lady
in Picayune to cast a mock bal
lot. She said, 'We're just nigger
folk. We can't vote.' To think of
the degradation of this -living 75
years feeling that way."
Holt Ruffin, a sophomore Poli
tical Science major, was eon
fronted with similar problems
working in the northeastern part
of the state. Upon visiting the all-
Negro West Point College, he
was told by its Negro president
that students would have to be
expelled if they joined the Aaron
Henry for Governor campaign.
"The hands of these educators
were tied," explained Ruffin.
"They are under the control of
the all-white state Board of Edu
cation."
Ruffin said Negro merchants
balked at requests to allow bal

►
j loting on their property for fear
! of economic reprisal from the
whites. "Their attitude." he
I pointed out, "was one of. 'You can
j leave, but we have to live here
i with these people."
Hugh Smith, a senior Philoso-
I phy major, encountered this
