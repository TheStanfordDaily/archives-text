The mystery of the bagpiper of
Santa Teresa Street is no longer
a mystery.
She is Karen Plain, a junior
physics major. Every evening
she can be seen playing her pipes
on the sidewalk between .Roble
and Lagunita. Passers-by stare at
her, the policeman on the beat
nods to her, hut nothing stops
Karen once she has started play
ing.
A girl bagpiper is a rarity.
Karen learned to play from her
father, a research scientist at the
China Lake Naval Ordinance
Base, and a piper. Mr. Plain is a
member of a pipe band made up
of fellow scientists. Karen's big
problem is that she has no one
to play with. Traditionally bands
have been all male.
Karen, who is a quarter Scotch,
dresses up in the kilts of her clan
on Scottish holidays and plays
after church services. She plans
to celebrate St. Andrew's Day. No
vember 30, with a special display
of her bagpipes.
The Stanford Players put her
to work last spring as a "special
effect" in "The Hostages." It
takes practice to be a good bag
piper, and rather than disturb any
of tlic women ;it Lagunita Karen
