# Stanford and the Mock Vote: What Did It Mean
## 
### 
The mock vote is over, the Stanford students have re
turned, and for a brief time the Daily will return to being a
university bulletin. The mock vote has accomplished many
things, both for .Mississippi and for Stanford.
In reporting the results of the Mississippi gubernatorial
race, both major wire services included a statement on the
mock vote, and the estimate of 90 to 100 thousand votes to
be tallied for "freedom ballot" candidate Dr. Aaron Henry.
The Mississippi Negro has begun to learn that politics is not
merely "white folks' business;" he has gotten the feeling of a
campaign button on his chest and a ballot in his hand. In
spite of the grossest intimidation and the most widespread
of fears, he spoke with 100,000 voices to demand American
citizenship.
The Mississippi segregationist white is taking on the cast
of his "apartheid" counterpart in South Africa. National pres
sure will cease to condone him as "that's the way people are
in Mississippi," and he will be forced to step down. The ar
rival of Stanford and Yale students and support forced the
national press to realize that the exposure of the written word
still has a role in Mississippi, and that brutality and violation
of constitutional rights cannot be ignored merely because they
are frequent. It is a sad commentary upon the insensitivity of
our time that the national media could be drawn in only bv
Northern white students and that they ignored the dedicated
civil rights workers who were in the South months before
Stanford students arrived, and will be there for months to
come. Whatever the illogic and injustice involved, Stanford
student and faculty support did raise from the dead crucial
stories of the Mississippi way of life.
And the mock vote has taught us a lesson about ourselves.
In days when the forces of the world seemingly render the
individual impotent, we have proven we can have an impact
on even so vast a problem as constiutional rights in the state
of Mississippi. We are ten thousand students, highly blessed
with the material gifts of the world and the intellectual capa
city to put them to use. We can no longer accept defeatism
in dealing with issues of our campus, the local community,
the state. To those who tell us we lack patience, to those who
tell us to avoid paths where others have tread and failed, to
those who raise all the objections of generations that have
fought and lost, we must reply with an empathctic nod, study
their words, and go beyond them. And to those who deny our
right to speak out and act, once we have decided upon words
and action, we must reply with contemptâ€”with sympathetic
contempt, perhaps, but with contempt nonetheless.
