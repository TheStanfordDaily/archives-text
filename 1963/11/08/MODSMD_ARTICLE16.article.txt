THE WELFARE STATE
Editor, The Daily:
Tom Walters mistakenly as
sumes the right to speak for per
sons other than himself: his is a
second way to usurp the freedom
of speech.
However, he objects to the
Welfare State "because it places
tremendous power into the hands
of the federal government." He
does not specify that this power
is threefold — economic power,
social power, and political power.
The Welfare State uses its eco
nomic power to feed mediocrities
and to starve geniuses; by social
security, minimum wage, relief,
"socialized" medicine, and other
projects, it gives values to those
who cannot or will not pay their
way in order to live; and from
those great men who do pay their
way with their intelligent dis
coveries and creations, feats of
rational thinking which benefit
all men. the Welfare State takes
their earnings as Income Tax.
The sponsors of Welfare repeat
that, they are guaranteeing th e
rights of man to life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness. Does
"socialized" medicine guarantee
any person a longer life? It does
not. Does social security liberate
any person from bankruptcy?
It does not. Do social security,
minimum wage, relief, and "so
cialized" medicine make a mooch
ing incompetent any happier?
They do not. Can any govern
ment legislate rights and oppor
tunities? They do not. Can any
one claim a right or demand an
opportunity which he does not
earn by exercising the right or
by making the best of the op
portunity? He can — and the
United States is a defunct cul
ture because it supports hi s
claim.
The Welfare State can perpetu
ate its political designs by pan
dering to union officials and
pseudo-intellectuals — the men
who seek security by dominating
men's bodies and the men who
seek self-justification by dominat
ing men's minds. It cannot sus
tain itself by appealing to the
rational thinkers who produce
goods and who are at once their

own justification, their own se
curity, and hence their own good.
Only by destroying their self
esteem can it induce men who
think and produce to work for
the good of an unthinking, un
productive "Whole." Only by in
sinuating that originality is origi
nal sin can it force men who work
for themselves to sacrifice them
selves to masses of people who
do not earn or deserve the very
food they eat.
As sanction for the enslave
ment of genius, the Welfare State
adopts the catch-phrase "From
each according to his ability, to
each according to his need." In
its exact meaning, this is the slo
gan of the Welfare State known
as the U.S.S.R. (remember—they
are Socialist Republics). If th e
elected officials of the United
States do not want such a slave
state here, why do they cling to
its basic tent ■— the arbitrary dis
tribution of wealth? Why do
they employ its primary device
—not equal, but equalized oppor
tunity? And why do they support
the failing Soviet economy with
the fruits of the capitalist system
it is set to annihilate?
When we coddle our declared
murderers, giving aid instead of
letting their collective destroy it
self, our danger lies within our
nation, not without. Against this
danger of death by default, there
is only one defense: the power of
thought.
The power of thought is the
one power that a Welfare State
does not and cannot encourage.
A person who feels it is his
duty to help others has already
disarmed his one weapon of sur
vival; his mind. He has felt when
he should have thought. He has
sacrificed his humanity on that
great altar of impotent feeling—
the Golden Rule.
Tom Walters says that history
alone will tell who is right. Thus,
he sacrifices himself to his meta
phor. But actions make history.
Production, not arbitrary distri
bution, is the life of a country.
Laissez-faire capitalism is the
only economy which produces the
goods, and it is the life of Amer
ica.
