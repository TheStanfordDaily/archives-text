DAILY DISCRIMINATION
Editor, The Daily.
It is extremely grievous to me
to have to report this to you, the
loyal "Daily" readers, but a situa
tion exists on this campus which
makes it imperative that 1 speak
before it is too late. Yes, I mean
that discrimination does exist at
this University. I call your atten
tion to "The Stanford Daily," the
"Peninsula's Only Morning News
paper." The editors of this gi
gantic news organ are involved
in a cunning scheme to prevent
the intellectual enlightenment of
a substantial portion of the Stan
ford Student Body. I refer, of
course, to the painfully acute
shortage of "Dailies" available
in the south cafeteria of Stern
Hall during the breakfast hour.
I do not know if this situation
exists in other locales on this
campus, but the fact that it exists
at all is despicable. Why, only
last week a sophomore was mor
tally wounded in a battle with a
freshman over who would get the
last "Daily." The freshman got
the "Daily," and the sophomore
was last seen being cartered
away in the direction of the meat
grinder by a head hasher and an
assistant dietician, both of whom
had fiendish grins on their faces.
(We still don't know what hap
penerd to this victim, but his
SAE pledge pin turned up last
night in a bowl of beef stew. >
How long must we be denied
our rights? When will "The
Daily" stop this fiendish plan
which comes frightfully close
to imposing actual censorship of
our reading material? Perhaps a
LASSU investigation of a pos
sible criminal conspiracy between
"The Daily" and the Stem Food
Service is called for—it is yet
too early to say. But this discrim
ination against Stern South can
not be allowed to continue. Now
is the time for action. I call on all
those who served during the less
troubled times of the fallout
shelter controversy last winter,
on all those who picketed the
ROTC Presidential Review last
spring, on those who cannot un
derstand a man who is both a
Christian and a soldier, on all
these and more, to rally to this,
the greatest crusade in Stanford's
history. Now is the time for pick
eting Dr. Sterling's office, for
printing signs and carrying plac
ards, for organizing rallies, per
haps even for the ultimate action,
a sit-in at the Faculty Club. I
turn this problem over to you,
good people. Will you once again
respond to the ultimate chal
lenge?
