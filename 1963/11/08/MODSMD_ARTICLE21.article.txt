CIVIL RIGHTS OF
CALIFORNIANS
(Editor's Note: William F.
Stanton is a California Assem
blyman lor the Twenty-fifth
District ami vice-chairman of
the Legislature's Committee on
Social Welfare. This is a re
print of a letter Assemblyman
Stanton wrote to Governor Ed
mund Brown In reference to the
mistreatment of California citi
zens in several southern states,
particularly Mississippi.)
Dear Governor Brown:
I have had a number of inquir
ies from my constituents with re
spect to the treatment that citi
zens of California have been ac
corded in some of the Southern
states. Several of my own con
stituents have been jailed. These
people have committed no crimes
other than to exercise their Con
stitutional rights as Americans.
Arrest and jail have been fol
lowed by the setting of outrage
ous amounts for bail. As you are
also aware, a number of people
from California have charged
that during their internment,
they have been subject to all
kinds of degrading treatment.
This has been particularly true
in Ihe case of women who have
suffered disgraceful and humili
ating treatment from their jail
ers. Additional details can, of
course, be found on the front
pages of the Sunday newspapers
of November 3.
I know that you fully share my
regard for the Constitutional
rights of all Americans. 1 am cer
tain, too, that you believe that
the national image of the United
.States will suffer throughout the
■world uriles<4 our people actively
protest the cruel and unlawful
practices of segregation and dis
crimination. Therefore, I am ask
ing you, possibly in conjunction
with the Attorney General Mosk,
to send a representative or repre
sentatives to the Southern States
(particularly Mississippi) to deter
mine what treatment is being ac
corded to Californians and how
we can help our citizens in their
lawful efforts to assure human
dignity and Constitutional rights
for all Americans.
If an investigation shows that
Californians are in need of legal
advice and representation, it is
my hope that you and Attorney
General Mosk will seriously con
sider providing legal counsel for
Californians who are illegally ar
rested and jailed. I am certain
that Southern legal scholars will
agree that the establishment of
such an office is wholly consist
ent with a state's rights and the
exercise of its police powers. In
addition, I feel that, under the
present circumstances, it is now
a state's duty to do so.
We. the people of California,
are morally obligated to assist in
every manner possible those
brave citizens of California who
have gone to the South to pre
serve Constitutional government
and human dignity.
Sincerely yours,
—WILLIAM F. STANTON
