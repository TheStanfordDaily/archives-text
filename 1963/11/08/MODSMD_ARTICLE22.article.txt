# Federal Court Decision Frees Civil Rights Workers in Georgia
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
Last Saturday, four civil rights

field workers—three white and
one Negro- walked triumphantly
from an Americus, Georgia, jail
where they had been imprisoned
for nearly three months, under
arrest for "inciting to insurrec
tion," a charge which, under an
1871 Georgia statute, carried a
possible death penalty. The four
SNCC and CORE workers were
freed, on bond, by a precedent
setting federal court decision
which declared the Georgia insur
rection statute unconstitutional
and granted a suit charging
Americus, Sumter County, and
state officials with conspiracy
against the civil rights movement.
The two-to-one split decision
marks the first time the federal
judiciary has intervened to halt
a state court proceeding in a
civil rights case at the request of
a private party. The majority
opinion ruled that federal courts
I were empowered to take such
action under an 1870 Civil Rights
Act and a 1957 amendment to the
act. This act gives district courts
jurisdiction over civil actions ini
tiated by individuals to end de
nial of their constitutional rights
by a state or its officials.
The federal court gave city,
j county, and state officials until
j next January to prepare their de
; fense against the charge that they
used their authority in a conspir
acy to block the campaign for
civil rights in Georgia. If the
case against them succeeds, a
powerful precedent would be es
! tablished which could be used to
J stymie further official suppres
! sion of the civil rights movement
throughout the South.
Released by the federal court
injunction were three SN'CC field
secretaries — John Perdew, a
Harvard student, Ralph Allen of
Melrose, Mass., and Donald Harris
of New York. On August 8, they
were arrested in Americus dur
ing a non-violent, anti-segregation
demonstration and confined in a
make-shift jail on eight counts,
I including the charge of "inciting
to insurrection." Later, on Aug
ust 17, CORE field worker Zev
j Aelony of Minneapolis was seized
| after a demonstration and jailed
under the same statute.
Local officials made certain
that those arrested stayed in jail.
The committing magistrate, C.
M. Bradley, allowed a "Peace
! Bond" to be set, and the bond
1 total rose to $120,000. In addition,
; under Georgia law, no bail is
i allowed for those held on a cap
: ital offense.
Atorney Morris B. Abram, who
| brought suit in behalf of the
] CORFJ workers before the federal
! court, had charged, according to
i a Time 3lagaine article, "These
people are being held and offered
bail only if they give up their
, constitutional rights, that is, leave
the state." During the course of
,the federal hearing, Sumter
! County Prosecutor Stephen Pace
Jr., seemed to admit as much.
Time quoted him as saying, "We
j were in hopes that by holding

these men we would be able to
talk 10 their lawyers and their
people and convince them that
this type of activity is not the
right way to go about it."
During its summer congress at
Bloomington, Indiana, the Na
tional Student Association (NSAi ,
received testimony of shocking
police brutality involved in the
arrest of the SNCC workers. In
a telephone conversation of Aug
ust 26 with defense attorney C.
B. King, Tim Manring, National
Association Vice President, asked,
"Were there any cases of police
brutality during their arrests?"
King replied, "Well, Perdew was
hit with a night stick and slapped j
by the officers. . . . Ralph Allen ,
was hit on the forehead with a
night stick, requiring two or three
stitches." King related incidents
of brutality- beatings and torture !
which occured during the ar-1
rest of other civil rights demon-1
strators.
In this same conversation, King
described the conditions he ob
served in ihe Americus jail where |
the workers were imprisoned. He j
recalled that the jail "had no I
shower; the toilet was upstairs I

and was stuffed with toilet tissue
and overflowing. There as a tre
mendous stench. . . . They were
fed four hamburgers daily, and
nothing else. There was no
water. . . ."
A transcript of the King-Man
i ring conversation was read to a
shocked and silent audience. As
a result of this and other evid
ence, NSA passed a resolution
protesting the brutal suspension
of civil liberties in Americus and
urged federal action. The Con
gress mandated the NSA Vice
President to telegram the U.S.

justice department apprising the
Assistant Attorney General of
NSA's position.
The judicial signifiance of the
Amerieus case is still in doubt.
Stanford Law Professor Gerald
Gunther was hesitant to comment
on the ruling without first hav
ing read the court opinion. "Cer
tainly, the result were unusual,"
he ventured, "hut how much of a
one-shot this is, I can't say yet.
It is possible that here they have
laid a broad basis for future ac
tion, but we'll have to wait and
see."
