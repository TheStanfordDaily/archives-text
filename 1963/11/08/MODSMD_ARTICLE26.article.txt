# Militant Ideology Held by â€˜New Gandhi'
## 
### 
Since Mahal ma Gandhi died, |
India has awaited a successor
with the magic* of his appeal to
the masses of the East.
Three weeks ago a second \
Gandhi burst upon the Indian;
scene, polarizing public demand j
for a strong and united nation, I
and confronting China's Mao Tse- j
tung with what may prove to be j
his sternest challenge for the
leadership of Asia.
He is the Mahatma's 28-year-'
old grandson, .Rajmohan. West- j
ern-trained like his famous grand- j
father, Gandhi is no pacifist or i

neutralist. He believes military
defense against aggression is es
sential. But he holds (hat a mili
tant, moral ideology is equally
essential. He believes that with
out a revolution of character in
India, and a rebirth of faith and
patriotism, freedom in that giant
land is doomed.
He is dramatizing this belief
in a 3,400-mile March-on-Wheels
now heading from Kerala in the
south, through eight states and
29 cities, towards the capital of
New Delhi in the north.
Rajmohan Gandhi is convinced
that India needs a new national
purpose. "India, not China," he
says, "must become the dynamic,
revolutionary nation of this cen
tury. We plan to awaken in out
people the will to fight with every
weapon available for the social
and moral transformation of the
modern world."
Gandhi's march, reminiscent
of his grandfather's marches 30
years ago that freed India from
British rule, began on October 2,
the Mahal ma's birthday. It
started from the continent's
southermost tif). Cape Comorin.
The hard core of the marching
column is a group of Indian polit
ical leaders. They include mem

bers of the Kerala Legislature
who in 1957 helped overthrow the
state's Communist regime, and
have since cemented a common
democratic front against the cor
ruption and religious rivalry
which had made the takeover pos
sible.
Already the march has roused
hundred of thousands of Indians.
In Trivandrum, capital of Kerala,
the 86-year-old Hindu Liberation
leader Mannath Padmanabham,
led the welcome with 100,000 lin
ing the streets and 25,000 cheer
ing at the mass rally in the sta
dium. In the next city, Coimba
tore, 160,000 turned out.
In 1930 the Mahatma marched
200 miles from Ahmedabad to the
sea to make salt in defiance of
the British salt tax. It touched
off a nation-wide campaign of re
sistance that led to independence.
Today the Chinese, not the Brit
ish, are regarded as the threat
to India's freedom.
Young Gandhi believes revolu

tionary action is required to turn
back the invader, and to demon
strate that poverty, exploitation,
and disunity can be cured in In
dia more rapidly and effectively
than in Communist China.
The Mahatma's grandson is
uniquely qualified to lead India.
His father, Devadas Gandhi, was
for years editor of the influential
Hindustan Times. His maternal
grandfather, the Conservative
statesman Rajagopalachari, be
came the first Indian Governor-
General, and is still a powerful
political figure.
Gandhi's 3,400-mile trek from
Kerala will culminate in a world
assembly in New Delhi in Novem
ber and December.
