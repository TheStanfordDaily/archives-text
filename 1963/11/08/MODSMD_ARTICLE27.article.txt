in the game. The wide pool also
lets the Trojans open up and use
their usual attack.

poses the major individual threat
to the Indians. In the two teams'
first meeting Sarri scored three
of his teams six goals. With the
high goal, which Stanford Coach

roundings hard to handle early
in the game. The wide pool also
lets the Trojans open up and use
their usual attack.

of his teams six goals. With the

Jim Gauhgran says, "looks like
a drive-in movie screen," Sarri,
Linberg. and company may be

Buehler, Eshleman, and Ready.

much different story than t he
«. one played two weeks ago. Last
Tuesday the Trojans beat the
strong Long Beach team 6-3.
Stanford was only able to squeak
out a 9-8 overtime win last Sat
urday over the same Long Beach
seven.
The greatest handicap facing
J Stanford is the USC pool. The
pool has a shallow end and is
several yards wider than Stan
; ford's home pool. Because of the
shallow end the goalie is able to
| stand in front of the goal. This
necessitates raising the goal sev

will probably find the new sur
roundings hard to handle early
in the game. The wide pool also
