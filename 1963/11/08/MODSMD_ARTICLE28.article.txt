Stanford's cross country team
gets a rematch with the Trojans
of Southern California this week
end in Los Angeles.
Beaten by the men of Troy 27
to 2N two weeks ago at Berkeley
in a meet which did not count in
the conference standings, the In
dians can win the Big Six by
simply having one man move up
one place, thus reversing the
scores.
STANFORD Coach Payton Jor
dan said the meet is also doubly
important because if the Tribe
does not make a considerably bet
ter showing than it did last week
it will not make the trip to the
nationals at East Lansing, Mich,
in two weeks.
Jordan said also that if any
individual beats USC's great Julio
Marin, he should bo assured of a
trip to the NCAA meet. Also if
any runner appears to be in the
top five in the nation on the basis
of his performance over the en
tire season, he would make the
trip.
Marin, winner of the two teams'
previous meet this year, together
with sophomore Bruce Bess, who
took second in that meet, will
lead SC into the competition.
Stanford, once again, should be
led by Harry McCalla and Weym
Kirkland.
THK Mi:i;T will be run at 10
a.m. Saturday at Griffith Park
in Los Angeles on the Equest
rian trail, a course new to Stan
ford.
