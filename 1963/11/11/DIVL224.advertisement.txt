BOUNDLESS LOVE
"The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in
mercy. He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger tor
ever. He hath not dealth with us alter our >ins; nor rewarded us accord
ing to our inif|iiities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great
is His merry toward them that fear him. \s far as the east is from the
west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. Like as a
father pitied) his children, so the Lord pitied) them that fear Him. For
He knoweth our frame; He rememhereth that we are dust. As lor man,
his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourished]. For the
wind passed) over it, and il is gone; and the place thereof shall know it
no more. But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting
upon them that fear Him, and His righteousness unto cliildre it's children."
Ps. 103:8-1 7
"... for God is love. In this was manifested the love of (.oil toward us,
because that God sent his only begotten Son into 111«• world, that we might
li\e through him. Herein is love, noi that we loved God, but that he
j loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins." John .*>:7-H•
"And you he made alive, when you were dead through the trespasses and
sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world lid
low ing the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work
in the sons of disobedience. Among these we all once lived in the passions
of our flesh, following the desires of body and mind, and so we were by
nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But Cod, who is rich
in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us, even when we
were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together wit It ( lirM ( by
grace you have been saved), and raised us up with him, and made us sit
with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the coming ages
he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us
in Christ Jesus. For by grace have you been saved, through faith; and
this is not your own doing, it is t lie gi ft of God not because of works lest
any man should boast. For we are liis workmanship, created in Christ
Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should
walk in them. Eph. 2:1-10.
"He bath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what dotli the Lord re
quire of thee, hut to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly
with thy God?" ftlic. ft :K
"Whosoever shall confess that Jesus i- the Son of God, (rod dwelled) in
Flim. and lie in (rod. \nd we have known and believed that love that
God bath to us. Cod is love; and lie that dwelled) in love ilwelleth in God.
and God in him. We love him because he first loved us." I John t:L~>
lft, 19.
Do you know God's great love in your life? This love is no mystical ex- i
perience or imagined virtue, but a real and personal love which the !
risen Christ freely given to all those who follow Him. (rod's love is
free to all because Christ paid the price in order that we might receive
it as a gift.
