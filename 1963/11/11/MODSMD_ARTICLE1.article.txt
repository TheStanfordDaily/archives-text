## 
### JOHN CALMORE 
The USC Trojans battled back in tho second half to defeat Stan
ford's Indians 25-11. before 57,035 spectators at Los Angeles' smog
filled Memorial Coliseum last Saturday afternoon.
The first time SC had the ball was the only time in the first half
that they moved il well. After getting the ball on a Stanford punt
the Trojans took over on their 23-yard line. With halfback Mike
Garrett carrying on eight of the 14 plays, SC moved to the Tribe 30
before the Stanford defense got too tough.
\VHJ;n STANFORD look possession J. D. Lodato and Steve Thur
low's running, along with quarterback Mike Connelly's passing gave
the Indians two quick first downs. Then on a third and six, Thurlow
brought the crowd to their feet*

with a 36-yard aerial to Ray Hand
ley, putting the ball on the Tro
jan seven.
Mere the offense bogged and
Braden Beck was called on for
a three-pointer, but the attempt
was blocked by USC's John
Thomas. The quarter closed in a
scoreless deadlock.
The Trojan horse was unable
to move, and Ernie Jones punted
to Lodato on the Stanford 22. J.
D. shot down the right sideline
for a 57-yard return and the In
dians were on the Southern Cal
21. But it was SC's turn to be
tough on defense and again Beck
came in to try a field goal a n d
again it was no good, going wide.
NEITHER TEAM could get a
score; help was needed. On first
an d ten, Trojan quarterback
Craig Fertig, hit by a host of
white shirts, fumbled on his own
31 and Tony DeLellis pounced on
the loose ball. After a Thurlow
to Frank Patitucci pass for 16
yards, DeLellis carried up the
middle for one. and then took the
ball again, punching through left
guard for the score, 10:15 into
the second period. Thurlow pow
ered over for the two points.
Garrett fumbled the kickoff
and Beck recovered on the SC 20.
Fullback Glenn Myers went up
the middle for four, then next
play pushed over left guard for
five. Mike Connelly dropped back
J to pass, was hit and lost the ball
! but recovered ii for a loss of 12.
With the ball on the 29, Beck
came in for another field goal
attempt, this one true to the
mark, giving the Tribe an 11-0
lead.
At the beginning of the second
half it was again time for mis
takes to offer aid. This time USC
got the help as Dick Ragsdale
was in punt formation and t h e
center snap sailed over his head.
; SC's Thomas recovering on the
j Stanford 24-yard line.
SOUTHERN C'AIj wasted no
I lime in taking advantage of the
break, with Willie Brown a n d
Garrett moving ihe ball to Stan
ford's six. Stanford's defensive
unit dug in and held to a fourth
! and six situation, when Garrett
, swept right end, stopped and fired
I a strike to Brown in ihe end zone.
On the PAT, Fertig kept for two
j points.
The Trojans kicked off to
! Ritehey on the 13, with him fum

bling after a 12-yard return. San
chez picked the ball out of th e
air, and the Trojans were on the
Stanford 25. But two things
bothering the USC drive all day,
penalties and the Indian defense,
pushed SC back to the 30.
After the ball exchanged hands
once, Jones punted to Ragsdale
and the Indian halfback mis
judged it, fumbling, and Garrett
recovered it on the Tribe 15. Two
rushes by Brown and a Fertig
to Fred Hill pass put the ball on
the four, first and goal. Brown
tried left guard for two, Fertig
kept at right guard for no gain,
Brown at left guard for no gain,
an incomplete Brown pass â€” and
Stanford had completed a Berlin
Wall-like stand.
DEEP IN Til 101R own territory,
the Indians thought their chances
of covering a kickoff better than
those of covering a punt, so Con
nelly, in punt formation, ran out
of the end zone for an intential
safety.
But the plan backfired as Gar
rett took the kickoff back 44
yards to the Stanford 30. Runs by
Garrett and Ron Heller, and a

pass from Fertig lo Garrett
moved SC to iho 17. Fertig passed
to Brown for the touchdown, and
the Trojans took tho load for the
first time.
Holler added insult to injury,
finally giving SC another six
points when ho seored on a 13-
yard run.
