The USC Trojans battled back in tho second half to defeat Stan
ford's Indians 25-11. before 57,035 spectators at Los Angeles' smog
filled Memorial Coliseum last Saturday afternoon.
The first time SC had the ball was the only time in the first half
that they moved il well. After getting the ball on a Stanford punt
the Trojans took over on their 23-yard line. With halfback Mike
Garrett carrying on eight of the 14 plays, SC moved to the Tribe 30
before the Stanford defense got too tough.
\VHJ;n STANFORD look possession J. D. Lodato and Steve Thur
low's running, along with quarterback Mike Connelly's passing gave
the Indians two quick first downs. Then on a third and six, Thurlow
brought the crowd to their feet*

with a 36-yard aerial to Ray Hand
ley, putting the ball on the Tro
jan seven.
Mere the offense bogged and
Braden Beck was called on for
a three-pointer, but the attempt
was blocked by USC's John
Thomas. The quarter closed in a
scoreless deadlock.
The Trojan horse was unable
to move, and Ernie Jones punted
to Lodato on the Stanford 22. J.
D. shot down the right sideline
for a 57-yard return and the In
dians were on the Southern Cal
21. But it was SC's turn to be
tough on defense and again Beck
came in to try a field goal a n d
again it was no good, going wide.
NEITHER TEAM could get a
score; help was needed. On first
an d ten, Trojan quarterback
Craig Fertig, hit by a host of
white shirts, fumbled on his own
31 and Tony DeLellis pounced on
the loose ball. After a Thurlow
to Frank Patitucci pass for 16
yards, DeLellis carried up the
middle for one. and then took the
ball again, punching through left
guard for the score, 10:15 into
the second period. Thurlow pow
ered over for the two points.
Garrett fumbled the kickoff
and Beck recovered on the SC 20.
Fullback Glenn Myers went up
the middle for four, then next
play pushed over left guard for
five. Mike Connelly dropped back
