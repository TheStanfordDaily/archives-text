# Serra Upsets Hi-Fi Robbery
## 
### ROD PECK 
Ail attempted robbery of a hi-fi
.set from Stern Hall's Serra House
was foilerl last Saturday night by
the ingenuity of the students re
siding there. One of the attempted
thief's was apprehended an d
turned over to the Stanford Police
Department.
AT APPROXIMATELY 12:30
a.m., students in Serra were
aroused by a burglar alarm they
had wired into their hi-fi set in
the house lounge. Rushing to the
lounge, they surprised two men
trying to take components from
the set. The robbers bolted out
the door but were pursued by
about a dozen Serra men. After
a chase across the Stern parking
lot. one of them described as
"very fast," stumbled and fell and
was immediately overtaken by
three of the pursuers. He was
pinned down until a larger group
arrived and was held 'til the Stan
ford Police came about five min
utes later.
The alarm system built into the
hi-fi set was set up last year by
Ralph Hiesey after a similar out
lit costing approximately $500
was stolen in the spring. Serra
raised money to replace it, and
set up the alarm and pre-arranged
positions for each student after
the theft. Saturday, their prepara
tion was rewarded. Although
Hiesey said it didn't work as well
as expected because "too many
men were gone," he said the work
that went into arranging the pre
cautions was well worth it.
HE SURMISED that the rob
bers were probably at the KZSU
record hop held earlier that night
in the Stern courtyard and saw
th e combination record-player
and radio in the Serra Lounge and
thought it would be easy to make
off with it. Much to their dismay,
the men of Serra were ready for
them.
To discourage designs any o1 her
potential thiefs may have on the
Serra hi-fi set, Hiesey said that
they were planning to bolt it
down in the near future as well
as maintaining their already so
phisticated system of crime pre
vention.

Ail attempted robbery of a hi-fi
.set from Stern Hall's Serra House
was foilerl last Saturday night by
the ingenuity of the students re
siding there. One of the attempted
thief's was apprehended an d
turned over to the Stanford Police
Department.
AT APPROXIMATELY 12:30
a.m., students in Serra were
aroused by a burglar alarm they
had wired into their hi-fi set in
the house lounge. Rushing to the
lounge, they surprised two men
trying to take components from
the set. The robbers bolted out
the door but were pursued by
about a dozen Serra men. After
a chase across the Stern parking
lot. one of them described as
"very fast," stumbled and fell and
was immediately overtaken by
three of the pursuers. He was
pinned down until a larger group
arrived and was held 'til the Stan
ford Police came about five min
utes later.
The alarm system built into the
hi-fi set was set up last year by
Ralph Hiesey after a similar out
lit costing approximately $500
was stolen in the spring. Serra
raised money to replace it, and
set up the alarm and pre-arranged
positions for each student after
the theft. Saturday, their prepara
