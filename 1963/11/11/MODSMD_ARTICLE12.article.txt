# Yale Men Picket For Coeducation
## 
### 
Equal rights for the fairer sex
became a pressing issue late Sat
urday morning, when according
to the"The Dartmouth," over TOO
Yale students and assorted wom
en demonstrated in front of Presi
dent Kingman Brewster Jr.'s
office in the March on New Ha
ven for Equality in the Ivy
League.
DEMONSTRATION for a new
admissions policy which would
allow coeds, the students waved
banners proclaiming "We Want
Fair Sex." "Move Vassar to New
Haven." Slogans such as "We
want women now." were coun
tered by a dissenting minority
whose banners proclaimed "Keep
Yale Male." and "Would You Like
Your Son to Marry a Yalie."
"The Dartmouth" reported.
The movement is the work of
the Lueinda Foote Committee, a
group favoring the admission of
coeds "to add to the educational
experience," acc or ding to a
spokesman for the committee in
favor of stirring up interest.
The committee plans no fur
ther action in the near future
according to a spokesman. How
ever, "If someone gives money
(to establish coed facilities) then
we would be called on to applaud
their act ion,"
TIIE "Yale Daily News" told
"The Dartmouth" that three rea
sons wore cited by those opposing
coeds. They feel it would be
breaking tradition, it would lower
educational attainment, and it
might lower faculty quality.
Whether women other than
graduate students will be a fix
ture on the tradition-laden New
Haven campus in the near future
is a debatable point. But as one
Yalie put it: Our activities "have
brought out discussion on
whether women should be ad
mitted."
