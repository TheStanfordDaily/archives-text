# CAMPUS OPINION
## Student Attacks Possony on National Defense 
### RICHARD SUCH 
There appeared in the Daily of
November 4 an article under the
heading "Possony Blasts Arma
ment Policy," in which the direc
tor of the international studies
program of the Hoover Institution
was said to have attacked the de
fense policy of Secretary Robert
McNamara at a recent meeting of
the California Young Republican
College Federation. Quite un
happily, I was not present at that
meeting and cannot know what
qualifications ftr. Possony may
have appended to his charges
that (1) the test ban treaty was
" 'a trap into which we fell with
both our feet,' " (2) "at the pres
ent rate of phasing out military
weapons our firepower would be
reduced ninety per cent by 1972,"
(3) since McNamara came to
power, 'not a single new weapons
system has been approved,' " and
(4) " 'the only way you can deal
with the communists is from a
position of strength.' " Rut taking
these statements at face value,
the first would clearly be difficult
to defend against the arguments
familiar to nearly all Stanford
students and the following three
are entirely misleading.
T assume that the referrence
was to the probable phasing-out
of the B-52. It is quite true that
if the number of these carriers of
more than 20-megaton bombs is
reduced, the "firepower" of the
American arsenal will be corres
pondingly reduced. It is also true,
however, that present techniques
of interception make both of the
great military opponents practic
ally invulnerable to bomber at
tack and thus make the B-."i2 a
virtually obsolete system, the re
maining functions of which can
be adequately performed by the
faster B-58. The notion of fire
power is meaningless if applied
to weapons which cannot be deliv
ered and must not be measured
only in terms of the megatonnage
of a weapons system but also in
terms of its ability to penetrate
enemy defenses, to perform reli
ably, a survive a counterforce at
tack, to deliver "discrete" nuclear
packages rather than provocative
ly massive ones, and so on.
It is not obvious that Secretary
McNamara is to blame just be
cause no new weapons system has
been approved. If no workable
system has been newly devised,
then naturally none will have
been approved. Yet perhaps what
Dr. Possony had in mind was the
reluctance of the Department of
Defense to develop the Skybolt,
the RS-70, an advanced anti-mis

sile missile like the Nike-Zeus,
and super-bombs of the Russian
100-megaton variety, each of
which has very convincingly been
shown to be either technically in
feasible or strategically redun
dant.
So far from neglecting the na
tion's defense needs, the Me-
Namara "regime" has vastly im
proved both our nuclear and con
ventional capacities; perhaps its
most impressive (or, if you will,
frightening i accomplishment, is
the Minuteman system which will
total 800 ICBM's by the middle
1960\5, with the Secretary's assur
ance of a possible, nearly imme
diate expansion to a force of 1600
upon the completion of the pres
ent program. This system, com
bined with other programs such
as the missile submarine, gives
the United States a potential for
the discriminant of all-out use of
force such as no other nation
comes close to possessing. Dr.
Possony's insistence on the crea
tion of a "position of strength"
is a proposition of the coals-to-
Newcastl'e variety.
Each of these four charges, in
cidentally, is easily associated
with the proponents of a "hard
line" policy, found particularly
within the Air Force and among
the members of the radical-right. [
This curious association prompt-!
Ed me lo inquire somewhal fur
ther into the political thinking
of Dr. Possony. I found that he,
along with Robert Strausz-Hupe
and William Kintner, is the
author of a book, printed in 1951,
entitled A Forward Strategy for
America.
In reviewing this book, C. L.
Sulzberger of the New York i
Times quoted what he regarded
to be three "dangerous thoughts"
of Dr. Possony and his associates.
The first, in referrence to the con
test between the U.S. and the
USSR: "The struggle ends only
with the total destruction of the
weapons of one or the other con
testant." The second: "We should
hew forthrightly to the line that
negotiations with the Soviets are
impractical so long as the com
munists remain attached to their
deceitful code and their global
ambitions." The third: "The per
manent coexistence between sys
tems so fundamentally opposed
as closed and open societies is im
possible."
I might add a few other quota
tions, drawn from A Forward
Strategy:
"... Refusal to endorse the
present political status of the cap
tive nations is a beginning: it can
not be the end of Western efforts

to dissolve t he . . . Soviet empire. I
... the tools of political war
fare are ethically neutral.
. . . Morality in the conduct of
international affairs is an elusive,
and subjective standard . . . we
are forced to deal with the world
as it is, not as we might like it
to be.
. . . The abolition of nuclear
weapons is a pipe dream."
A very recent article by Dr.
Possony, found in a Hoover In
stitution publication entitled Na
tional Security, renews this ex
treme moroseness, lack of sublety
and exaggeration of the neces
sities of defense, as does, indeed,
the volume as a whole. For exam
ple: "But there also is a sincere
conviction, not entirely unfound
ed, that some conversations with
the Soviets are necessary. Yet,
what is there to talk about except
schemes of unreality?"
The second page of the Daily
issue mentioned above carried
Miss Strelit/'s editorial reminder
of a controversy which took place
last year over the right of stu
dents, as a body, to express them
selves on "off-campus issues."
The Administration's argument,
which was set forth to justify
the silencing of the student legis
lature, replied largely on the sup
posedly unrepresentative charac
ter of that group; the argximent

was bad, and mainly because the
large, heterogeneous legislature
has rarely, if ever, even threat
ened to express an opinion about
which there was not virtual una
nimity or at least the favor of a
majority among the community
as a whole, students and faculty.
The legislature is representative
and deserves to be heard. I could
not be convinced, however, thai
Dr. Possony's opinions, to which
are linked the authority and pres
tige of Stanford University, can
be representative of more than
an insignificani faction of the
community. Despite that fact, and
perhaps because of it, it is cer
tainly not my wish that Dr. Pos
sony be "silenced." On the other
hand, it does seem to me that he
commands too large a measure
of the respectability of Stanford's
name.
It is unfortunate that Dr. Pos
sony has been singled out for
criticism. By this stricture I have
intended to particularize and to
point toward a broader criticism
and to raise a question which may
lead to a solution to the problem
of what seems to be an abuse of
the University's good name- to
raise the question, that is, of the
academic qualifications, the polit
ical responsibility, and the mo
tivational salubrity of the Hoover
staff generally.
