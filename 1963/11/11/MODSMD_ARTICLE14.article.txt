These are not the names of "for
eigners," but of American boys
and girls, just like you, who died
to destroy the tyrants so that you,
their children and grandchildren,
might walk the Quad in peace and
freedom — the freedom of which
Voltaire spoke when he said, "I
disapprove of what you say, but
I will defend to the death your
right to say it."
The next time you enter Mem
Aud, pause for one moment and
remember that it is not "corny"
or "waving the flag" to think of
those who, in terror (we were all
scared) and agony, gave their
lives not only for you, but also
for humanity, along with hun
dreds of thousands of others all
over the world, and including in
n u m e r a b le Chinese-Americans
and the 42nd Infantry Division
from Hawaii, all of whom were
Nisei and fought with unsur
passed bravery and devotion in
Italy.

SCHULMANN AND DEATH
Editor, The Daily:
Though I have long enjoyed
Max Schulmann, I find it hard
to understand how a man of his
intelligence and sensitivity can so
gaily serve death for money. I
suggest that the time is ripe for
the Daily either to drop him or to
accompany his column with a re
minder of the macrabre facts
which his gonial and sophisticated
cynicism persuades us to forget.
—JEFFERY SMITH
WHS
Editor, The Daily:
During the past few days the
Stanford WUS committee has
been attempting to inform the
campus of the international and
local operations of the World Uni
versity Service. Through our arti
cles on Hong Kong, and our sum
maries of Stanford's WUS activi
ties (the T.B. sanitorium in Japan,
Ihe bookstore in Basutoland, the
work project for Peru), we have
been explaining the effects of
WUS on our own, as well as on
foreign university communities.
And this is the committee's goal
—to explain what WUS is. In
the past, Stanford has greatly
helped World University Service
efforts, even though many stu
dents were not fully aware of
WUS' services. But in the future,
we want the students and th e
faculty to be as interested and
encouraged in WUS accomplish
ments as are the people who
know WUS in other countries.
We want the campus to under
stand the sentiments of Ihe
people in Madras, India, who in
1962 donated 50 per cent of the
proceeds from the Madras Ba
zaar to the National Defense
Fund, and the other 50 per cent
to the World University Service.
This is the degree of importance
which WUS commands in th e
areas which know it best.
This coming week will be the
one opportunity during the year
that we, as a campus, will be able
to directly support the material
and intellectual advancement of
the world university community.
But more than this, it is an op
portunity to begin 1o understand
this international community. As
the fund drive progresses during
the next three days, think of what
you are supporting. If you give
$.50 or $5.00, have a purpose in
giving. Try to understand what
the World University Service is.
We want contributions from
thought.

SCHULMANN AND DEATH
Editor, The Daily:
Though I have long enjoyed
Max Schulmann, I find it hard
to understand how a man of his
intelligence and sensitivity can so
gaily serve death for money. I
suggest that the time is ripe for
the Daily either to drop him or to
accompany his column with a re
minder of the macrabre facts
which his gonial and sophisticated
cynicism persuades us to forget.

WHS
Editor, The Daily:
During the past few days the
Stanford WUS committee has
been attempting to inform the
campus of the international and
local operations of the World Uni
versity Service. Through our arti
cles on Hong Kong, and our sum
maries of Stanford's WUS activi
ties (the T.B. sanitorium in Japan,
Ihe bookstore in Basutoland, the
work project for Peru), we have
been explaining the effects of
WUS on our own, as well as on
foreign university communities.
And this is the committee's goal
—to explain what WUS is. In
the past, Stanford has greatly
helped World University Service
efforts, even though many stu
dents were not fully aware of
WUS' services. But in the future,
we want the students and th e
faculty to be as interested and
encouraged in WUS accomplish
ments as are the people who
know WUS in other countries.
We want the campus to under
stand the sentiments of Ihe
people in Madras, India, who in
1962 donated 50 per cent of the
proceeds from the Madras Ba
zaar to the National Defense
Fund, and the other 50 per cent
to the World University Service.
This is the degree of importance
which WUS commands in th e
areas which know it best.
This coming week will be the
one opportunity during the year
that we, as a campus, will be able
to directly support the material
and intellectual advancement of
the world university community.
But more than this, it is an op
portunity to begin 1o understand
this international community. As
the fund drive progresses during
the next three days, think of what
you are supporting. If you give
$.50 or $5.00, have a purpose in
giving. Try to understand what
the World University Service is.
We want contributions from
thought.

SCHULMANN AND DEATH
Editor, The Daily:
Though I have long enjoyed
Max Schulmann, I find it hard
to understand how a man of his
intelligence and sensitivity can so
gaily serve death for money. I
suggest that the time is ripe for
the Daily either to drop him or to
accompany his column with a re
minder of the macrabre facts
which his gonial and sophisticated
cynicism persuades us to forget.

WHS
Editor, The Daily:
During the past few days the
Stanford WUS committee has
been attempting to inform the
campus of the international and
local operations of the World Uni
versity Service. Through our arti
cles on Hong Kong, and our sum
maries of Stanford's WUS activi
ties (the T.B. sanitorium in Japan,
Ihe bookstore in Basutoland, the
work project for Peru), we have
been explaining the effects of
WUS on our own, as well as on
foreign university communities.
And this is the committee's goal
—to explain what WUS is. In
the past, Stanford has greatly
helped World University Service
efforts, even though many stu
dents were not fully aware of
WUS' services. But in the future,
we want the students and th e
faculty to be as interested and
encouraged in WUS accomplish
ments as are the people who
know WUS in other countries.
We want the campus to under
stand the sentiments of Ihe
people in Madras, India, who in
1962 donated 50 per cent of the
proceeds from the Madras Ba
zaar to the National Defense
Fund, and the other 50 per cent
to the World University Service.
This is the degree of importance
which WUS commands in th e
areas which know it best.
This coming week will be the
one opportunity during the year
that we, as a campus, will be able
to directly support the material
and intellectual advancement of
the world university community.
But more than this, it is an op
portunity to begin 1o understand
this international community. As
the fund drive progresses during
the next three days, think of what
you are supporting. If you give
$.50 or $5.00, have a purpose in
giving. Try to understand what
the World University Service is.
We want contributions from
thought.
