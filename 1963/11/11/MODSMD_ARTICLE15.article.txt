ROLE OF LAS ST J
Editor, The Daily:
The recent activities of Stan
ford students in the civil rights
field and the general interest
aroused on campus are reassur
ing indications that Stan
ford students are becoming aware
of the world beyond Palm Drive.
While agreeing with the ultimate
goals of the current activity, we
would nevertheless disagree with
the suggestion that LASSU be
used as a forum for discussion
and expression of such "off-cam
pus" issues (Daily editorial, Nov.
4).
LASSU is a body for manage
ment, by students, of student af
fairs on campus. The scope of
student government need not be
limited to selecting the color of
cheerleaders' sweaters, as was
suggested last year. Helping with
evaluation of the General Studies
program, cooperation with the
Committee on Student Affairs,
and maintaining the rights of stu
dents on this campus are all valu
able and fruitful areas for ASSU
action. While national issues may
be more glamorous, the inter
ested minority should not be al
lowed to use the forum and name
of ihe entire Associated Students
to support its views.
Last year the Stanford Student
Congress, a voluntary group of
interested individuals, was
formed to handle such discussions
as have been suggested by the
Daily. Stanford's student govern
ment does not, and was not in
tended to, speak out on national
and international issues as the
voice of the entire student body.
Representative are not elected to
the basis of their stand on such
issues, and cannot claim, even
now, to wholly represent their
constituents. If students want to
add emphasis to their expression
by speaking in the name of some
organization, let them go to the
Student Congress.
Miss Strelitz asks: "May we
not comment upon the education
bill before Congress? Upon the
banning of the National Union of

South African Students? Upon
Mississippi?" Certainly as in
dividuals we may comment, and
should. But it would be wrong to
allow a few individuals to use the
name and weight of Ihe Associ
ated Students to express their
personal convictions.

Editor, Tlu' Daily:
And hey there, Mister Pos
sony! People have been hitting
earth for a long time and gonna
keep on doin' it harder if ihey
listen to you! Guys like you,
Mister Possony, who wanna beat
hell out of our planet are just
too much to take!
Back, 'way back, in the real old
days, guys would hit earth with
their feet, or with a stick, or may
be a big rock. But there's always
a bigger rock on the other side
of the hill, and there's always an
other guy imaybe a lady?) on
the other side of that fabled hill
who can maybe heft a bigger
rock than you.
The good thing about earth
in the old days was that not
many people lived there—a strong
guy could hit earth all day with
a fifty megaton rock and nobody
knew or cared. But now we got
ta watch how hard we hit earth
because lotsa people live on it,
and we got plenty big rocks that
also go bang in the sky, hey?
Earth wasn't meant to be lugged
around in green bookbags by
guys of your ilk—it was meant
to stay in one place, in one piece.
Now see here, Mister Possony,
T don't know what goes on up
there in Hoo Tow but sayin'
that we gotta keep hitting earth
and moving it around just be
cause the fellow next door may
have a bigger rockpile is about
like saying that Hitler was
framed, ceteris paribus. So lei's
wreck Fort Knox and Capo Ca
naveral and Oak Ridge and Lock
heed and maybe The Vatican and
put all those rocks back where
we found 'em.

And hey there, Mister Pos
sony! People have been hitting
earth for a long time and gonna
keep on doin' it harder if ihey
listen to you! Guys like you,
Mister Possony, who wanna beat
hell out of our planet are just
too much to take!
Back, 'way back, in the real old
days, guys would hit earth with
their feet, or with a stick, or may
be a big rock. But there's always
a bigger rock on the other side
of the hill, and there's always an
other guy imaybe a lady?) on
the other side of that fabled hill
who can maybe heft a bigger
rock than you.
The good thing about earth
in the old days was that not
many people lived there—a strong
guy could hit earth all day with
a fifty megaton rock and nobody
knew or cared. But now we got
ta watch how hard we hit earth
because lotsa people live on it,
and we got plenty big rocks that
also go bang in the sky, hey?
Earth wasn't meant to be lugged
around in green bookbags by
guys of your ilk—it was meant
to stay in one place, in one piece.
Now see here, Mister Possony,
T don't know what goes on up
there in Hoo Tow but sayin'
that we gotta keep hitting earth
and moving it around just be
cause the fellow next door may
have a bigger rockpile is about
like saying that Hitler was

as have been suggested by the
Daily. Stanford's student govern
ment does not, and was not in
tended to, speak out on national
and international issues as the
voice of the entire student body.
Representative are not elected to
the basis of their stand on such
issues, and cannot claim, even
now, to wholly represent their
constituents. If students want to
add emphasis to their expression
by speaking in the name of some
organization, let them go to the
Student Congress.
Miss Strelitz asks: "May we
not comment upon the education
bill before Congress? Upon the
banning of the National Union of

South African Students? Upon
Mississippi?" Certainly as in
dividuals we may comment, and
should. But it would be wrong to
allow a few individuals to use the
name and weight of Ihe Associ
ated Students to express their
personal convictions.

POSSONY
Editor, Tlu' Daily:
And hey there, Mister Pos
sony! People have been hitting
earth for a long time and gonna
keep on doin' it harder if ihey
listen to you! Guys like you,
Mister Possony, who wanna beat
hell out of our planet are just
too much to take!
Back, 'way back, in the real old
days, guys would hit earth with
their feet, or with a stick, or may
be a big rock. But there's always
a bigger rock on the other side
of the hill, and there's always an
other guy imaybe a lady?) on
the other side of that fabled hill
who can maybe heft a bigger
rock than you.
The good thing about earth
in the old days was that not
many people lived there—a strong
guy could hit earth all day with
a fifty megaton rock and nobody
knew or cared. But now we got
ta watch how hard we hit earth
because lotsa people live on it,
and we got plenty big rocks that
also go bang in the sky, hey?
Earth wasn't meant to be lugged
around in green bookbags by
guys of your ilk—it was meant
to stay in one place, in one piece.
Now see here, Mister Possony,
T don't know what goes on up
there in Hoo Tow but sayin'
that we gotta keep hitting earth
and moving it around just be
cause the fellow next door may
have a bigger rockpile is about
like saying that Hitler was
framed, ceteris paribus. So lei's
wreck Fort Knox and Capo Ca
naveral and Oak Ridge and Lock
heed and maybe The Vatican and
put all those rocks back where
we found 'em.
