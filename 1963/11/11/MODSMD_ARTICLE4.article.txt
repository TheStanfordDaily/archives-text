# Dixie Declared Closed Society

### 
Dr. James W. Silver, professor
of history at Ole Miss, charged,
according to the Associated Press,
that Mississippi is a "closed so
ciety" where the white man "does
not dare express a deviation of
j opinion without looking over his
j shoulder."
THE SEARCH FOR historical
truth — including the truth of
what happened when Meredith
enrolled- "has become a casual
ty," he asserted. Silver was pres
ent at the beginning of the riot
and when Meredith was enrolled
at bayonet-point. According to
the Associated Press, Silver
claimed that Mississippi's "closed
society" shifted the blame for the
defiance of law from "those cre
ating the violence <the university
administration) to those enforc
ing the law (the Federal govern
ment
According to the Associated
Press, Governor Ross Barnett of,
Mississippi commented: "Old Sil :
ver's liable to say anything. I 1
wouldn't waste words on thai
man. He ought to have been
kicked out a long time ago."
Concerning the Ole Miss riot, j
Silver charged that State high- j
way patrolmen had ceased to en-1
force law and order and "in fact |
in some cases (were) encourag- i
ing the restless crowd to demon-1
strate against the marshals." He
said that the Army was not called
in until it was evident that the
marshals were fighting for their
lives.
"Long after it was made abun
dantly clear that many faculty |
members had witnessed the in-,
ception of the riot and knew for'
a certainty about the fraud j
against the Federal government.;
the university administration did i
not deviate from its original po-1
sition but. on the contrary, con
tinued to search for evidence
against the marshals," he said.
"TODAY THE totalitarian soci
ety of Mississippi imposes on all
its people acceptance of an obe
dience to an official orthodoxy
almost identical with the pro
slavery philosophy," he claimed.
Without Federal intervention, he
said, Negro leadership is helpless
in trying to improve the race's
lot.
