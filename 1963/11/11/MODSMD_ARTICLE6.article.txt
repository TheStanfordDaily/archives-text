Kditor's Note: Application forms for the Keio-
Stanford summer exchange program to Japan

This summer I travelled to Toyko with ten
other Stanford students on the Stanford-Keio ex
change program. During the two months of July
and August, we lived with Japanese families in
Tokyo, and ihen with families in Kyoto, (lie an
cient capital of Japan.
We were also able to stay for short times with
other families in widely differing economic and
social positions. Finally, our group travelled with
a group of Japanese university students to vari
ous areas in Japan.
The Japanese society that I observed during
my two-month stay seemed a dynamic and chang
ing one.
Tokyo is a crowded industrial city whose popu
lation of over ten million makes it the largest city
in the world. It sprawls over a great deal of ter
ritory since earthquake danger rules out sky
scrapers.
The industry, the traffic, and the constant con
struction work seem to symbolize in Tokyo the
dynamic nature of the modern Japanese nation
just as the lovely temples in Kyoto represent the
country's traditions.
In spite of all that I had heard, I was some
what shocked by the position of women in the
society In several families that I visited the
mother did not eat dinner with the family. She
served the meal and ate afterwards, or at best,
she served everyone and started long after them.
Another example of the power of the Japanese
man in lamilv decisions can be seen in the some

what distorted buying patterns of many Japanese
families. Most families have such luxury items as
televisions (there are 13 million sots in a popula
tion of about 100 millioni, but the numbers of
such items as washing machines which are de
signed to lighten a woman's work are much
smaller.
Japanese food is much more time-consuming to
prepare than American food, and Japanese women
spend hours in the kitchen. American influence
can be seen in the large number of lunch spots
which offer hot dogs and hamburgers. These are
quite popular.
But within the home, food is usually tradi
tional, and the Japanese still prefer to eat it with
chopst icks.
In very modern families, the younger genera
tion sometimes sleeps in beds, but most Japanese
still use thick pads on the relatively soft floor of
"tatami" mats. These beds are comfortable and
in some ways convenient, but they involve a great
rleal of work for the women who must fold up the
heavy pads in the morning and stuff them in
closets and then bring them out again al night.
Japanese social life is changing rapidly, how
ever. due to the collective force of such powerful
influences as rapid industrialization, the new poli
tical structure brought in by the Occupation, and
mass media, such as American movies and rock
'n' roll and television.
Hut in spite of the force of industrialization and
over-crowding which makes the Japanese in
crowds or in traffic seem to have forgotten the
traditional courtesy for which they are famous,
they are remarkably generous and courteous as
individuals. Their kindness and consideration to
wards us proved over and over again that a great
deal of traditional Japan remains beneath the

This summer I travelled to Toyko with ten
other Stanford students on the Stanford-Keio ex
change program. During the two months of July
and August, we lived with Japanese families in
Tokyo, and ihen with families in Kyoto, (lie an
cient capital of Japan.
We were also able to stay for short times with
other families in widely differing economic and
social positions. Finally, our group travelled with
a group of Japanese university students to vari
ous areas in Japan.
The Japanese society that I observed during
my two-month stay seemed a dynamic and chang
ing one.
Tokyo is a crowded industrial city whose popu
lation of over ten million makes it the largest city
in the world. It sprawls over a great deal of ter
ritory since earthquake danger rules out sky
scrapers.
The industry, the traffic, and the constant con
struction work seem to symbolize in Tokyo the
dynamic nature of the modern Japanese nation
just as the lovely temples in Kyoto represent the
country's traditions.
In spite of all that I had heard, I was some
what shocked by the position of women in the
society In several families that I visited the
mother did not eat dinner with the family. She
served the meal and ate afterwards, or at best,
she served everyone and started long after them.
Another example of the power of the Japanese
man in lamilv decisions can be seen in the some

what distorted buying patterns of many Japanese
families. Most families have such luxury items as
televisions (there are 13 million sots in a popula
tion of about 100 millioni, but the numbers of
such items as washing machines which are de
signed to lighten a woman's work are much
smaller.
Japanese food is much more time-consuming to
prepare than American food, and Japanese women
spend hours in the kitchen. American influence
can be seen in the large number of lunch spots
which offer hot dogs and hamburgers. These are
quite popular.
But within the home, food is usually tradi
tional, and the Japanese still prefer to eat it with
chopst icks.
In very modern families, the younger genera
tion sometimes sleeps in beds, but most Japanese
still use thick pads on the relatively soft floor of
"tatami" mats. These beds are comfortable and
in some ways convenient, but they involve a great
rleal of work for the women who must fold up the
heavy pads in the morning and stuff them in
closets and then bring them out again al night.
Japanese social life is changing rapidly, how
ever. due to the collective force of such powerful
influences as rapid industrialization, the new poli
tical structure brought in by the Occupation, and
mass media, such as American movies and rock
'n' roll and television.

over-crowding which makes the Japanese in
