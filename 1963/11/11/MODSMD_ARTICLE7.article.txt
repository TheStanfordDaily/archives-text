The incident occurred when the
demonstrators inside the building
pushed passed security guards to
open a door letting in twenty to
fifty other CORE demonstrators.
Van Leuven and two others
were arrested because they ap
peared to be leaders of the group,
the "Bruin" stated.
Till; UC LA PAPER quoted Van
Leuven as saying. "CORE's phil
osophy of non-violence prevented
us from so much as touching the
guards, so we didn't even con
sider pushing by them to get to
a door. The guards climbed over
us, stepping on at least one dem
onstrator's face; they dragged the
three of us outside, arrested and
handcuffed us."
The door the group rushed to
open had guards, "neither inside
nor outside it,"he added.
"The "Bruin" quoted a Board of
Education official as saying. "The
Board has leaned over backwards
to prevent an incident." He also
said that the discipline was not
typical of other CORE demon
strations.
Pleading not guilty, Van Leu
ven was released without bail,
and said he agreed not to enter
or remain in the building after
closing. In this way CORE did
not have to post $500 bail at a
cost of $50 to them.
"I am sure," Van Leuven con
cluded. "that the UCLA students
will enter en masse against school
segregation by going to the third
vigil at the board this Thursday."
