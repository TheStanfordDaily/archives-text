# World University Service Opens Annual Fund Drive
## 
### 
Tuesday begins the annual World University Service funds drive
with the commencement of the Red Hot Professor contest. In pre
facing the drive, Chairman Bill Plippert said, "This year we want
lo inform the student body about the projects and goals of World
University Service. We hope to reach our monetary goals as a con-

•■sequences of tolling students
j about WUS. That is, we want
contributions from thought and
I not merely from reflex." To help
I accomplish this talks by WUS
members will be given to {he vari
ous living groups.
STANFORD has actively sup
ported WUS in recent years. Last
year, $2,300 went to Basutoland
1o finance a co-operative book
store which was very well re
ceived. In 1962, $1,800 went to
Japan to help finance one of the
first TB sanitoriums solely for
students.
Now Stanford's relations with
WUS are taking an even more ac
tive form. Last summer, 24 Stan
ford students went to Hong Kong
in WUS's first work camp. It
was so successful that a similar
group is being planned for the
coming summer, and operations
may be expanded to Japan, Tai
wan, and Macau in addition to
Hong Kong.
Stanford WUS hopes to raise
$1,500 to aid those in Hong Kong
who will be able to continue study
only with WUS aid. Also, $1,500
is destined to aid Holladay
House's expressed interest in a
proposed student center in Aya
cucho, Peru. Finally, $1,500 is
assigned to the WUS general
fund at Ihe Geneva Headquarters.
PRESIDENT J. E. Wallace ster
ling urged, "I hope all will give
consideration to work of WUS
during its fund drive this week.
Much can be done through it to
help feed, house, clothe, or train
our contemporaries in less for
tunate countries."
ASSU President. Bud Wedin.
cited the need to aid students
abroad. "We, perhaps better than
anyone else, can empathize a n d
concern ourselves with the great
obstacles to education that lie be
fore many of these students. I
would urge a whole-hearted «up
port of the drive and would hope
that it will realize its fullest ex
pectations."
On Tuesday and Wednesday,
Nov. 12 and 13, a booth to collect
off-campus, faculty and graduate
student contributions to WUS will
be set up adjacent to the Red Hot
Prof, booth on Engineering Cor
ner.
