# Thomas Cites Need For Powerful State
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD 
"It is absolutely necessary to
have a powerful State to guaran
tee justice and other basic civil
rights to individuals," declared
Norman Thomas, six-time Presi
dential candidate of the American |
Socialist Party, to a packed house
at Cubberley Auditorium yester- :
day.
Thomas, whose speech was en
tit led "The Role of the State in
Confronting Our Times," dis
cussed the three major issues
confronting the U.S. today civil •
rights, war and peace, and the
general economy as well as com
menting on the philosophy and ,
possible nomination of Republican ;
Senator Barry Goldwater and the :
need for Congressional reforms, i
1) CIVIL RIGHTS "We have
found that justice cannot be pro- i
tected except by Federal law in i
this field. You cannot legislate j
fraternal love. But you can give j
mankind a chance by establishing
certain legal frameworks. You
can help wipe out a history of
infamy in this area," Thomas de
clared.
The nation has made some
progress in civil rights, he re
marked, but the "religion of
white supremacy" is not native
to Mississippi alone; its origins

are much more diverse. "We can
see this in the continuance of
legislation favoring segregation
in many states, in the vote of the
people of Texas just last Satur
day in favor of keeping the dis
criminatory poll tax, an d the
choruses of those people, unfor
tunately very numerous in this
country, who think we are going
too far too fast."

Norman Thomas, who just re
turned from Mississippi, pre
faced his speech l>y thanking:
the members of the Stanford
community who helped in the
recent mock vote there. "Your
participation showed the Uni
versity world at its best, "he
staled. "Your aid, which was
most significant in the cam
paign, effectively rebuked the
racists oil both sides."

2) THE ECONOMY-Although
this country has an affluent so
ciety, its economy is based upon
the economics of scarcity instead [
of tlie economics of abundance,
Thomas explained. Instead of pro- !
ducing and dispersing necessities, 1
U.S. economy concentrates on j
war stuffs and excess luxuries.
He blamed a great deal of the!
world's economic woes on the fact i
that "in two-fifths of the world i
we have people living on mar-;
ginal subsistence while at the [
same time, according to United
Nations figures, $120 billion is j
spent on war." This brought him |
to the third issue:
S) WAR ANI) PEACE Thomas j
asserted that the most dominant j
religion in the world today is na-:
tionalism. "Is the religion of na-;
tlonalism the result of inculcation j
by the State?" he asked. In most !
countries, yes, hut not in the U.S. j
Rather, he found that the pres
ent administration was "ahead of
the people" in this respect.
He also found no solution in
unilateral disarmament, which he
opposed for "psychological rea
sons"; rather, the answer lies in
universal disarmament with con
trols supervised by a more pow
erful UN.
"Senator Goldwater does not
seem to see our problems in this
light." Thomas continued. "He
seems to feel that this nation is
in greater danger of being under
mined by continued spending in
the fields of Health, Education,
and Welfare rather than in un
necessary military expenditure to
obtain an overwhelming superior
ity in 'overkill.'"
While on the subject of Gold
water. Thomas resisted the sug
gestion that liberals ought to be
in favor of the Arizonian's nomi
nation. "I find Goldwater's nomi
nation a terrible wage to pay for
liberal salvation," he snapped.
Besides, he added, it won't help
this country any in changing a
i "crazy" legislative system that
i allows committee chairmen who
are in radical disagreement with
; even the broadest policies of their
i own party's policy platform to
continue to obstruct legislation.
To solve these problems as well
as the three major issues previ
ously mentioned, Thomas advo
i cated the rise of a more powerful
j State government. "And by State
government, I don't mean omni
potent tyrant but a democratic
Federal power which both works
and co-exists with voluntary as
sociations such as labor unions
land business organizations but
I maintains its role as final ar
j biter."

1) CIVIL RIGHTS "We have
found that justice cannot be pro- i
tected except by Federal law in i
this field. You cannot legislate j
fraternal love. But you can give j
mankind a chance by establishing
certain legal frameworks. You
can help wipe out a history of
infamy in this area," Thomas de
clared.
The nation has made some
progress in civil rights, he re
marked, but the "religion of
white supremacy" is not native
to Mississippi alone; its origins

are much more diverse. "We can
see this in the continuance of
legislation favoring segregation
in many states, in the vote of the
people of Texas just last Satur
day in favor of keeping the dis
criminatory poll tax, an d the
choruses of those people, unfor
tunately very numerous in this
country, who think we are going
too far too fast."

Norman Thomas, who just re
turned from Mississippi, pre
faced his speech l>y thanking:
the members of the Stanford
community who helped in the
recent mock vote there. "Your
participation showed the Uni
versity world at its best, "he
staled. "Your aid, which was
most significant in the cam
paign, effectively rebuked the
racists oil both sides."

2) THE ECONOMY-Although
this country has an affluent so
ciety, its economy is based upon
the economics of scarcity instead [
of tlie economics of abundance,
Thomas explained. Instead of pro- !
ducing and dispersing necessities, 1
U.S. economy concentrates on j
war stuffs and excess luxuries.
He blamed a great deal of the!
world's economic woes on the fact i
that "in two-fifths of the world i
we have people living on mar-;
ginal subsistence while at the [
same time, according to United
Nations figures, $120 billion is j
spent on war." This brought him |
to the third issue:
S) WAR ANI) PEACE Thomas j
asserted that the most dominant j
religion in the world today is na-:
tionalism. "Is the religion of na-;
tlonalism the result of inculcation j
by the State?" he asked. In most !
countries, yes, hut not in the U.S. j
Rather, he found that the pres
ent administration was "ahead of
the people" in this respect.
He also found no solution in
unilateral disarmament, which he
opposed for "psychological rea
sons"; rather, the answer lies in
universal disarmament with con
trols supervised by a more pow
erful UN.
"Senator Goldwater does not
seem to see our problems in this
light." Thomas continued. "He
seems to feel that this nation is
in greater danger of being under
mined by continued spending in
the fields of Health, Education,
and Welfare rather than in un
necessary military expenditure to
obtain an overwhelming superior
ity in 'overkill.'"
While on the subject of Gold
water. Thomas resisted the sug
gestion that liberals ought to be
in favor of the Arizonian's nomi
nation. "I find Goldwater's nomi
nation a terrible wage to pay for
liberal salvation," he snapped.
Besides, he added, it won't help
this country any in changing a
i "crazy" legislative system that
i allows committee chairmen who
are in radical disagreement with
; even the broadest policies of their
i own party's policy platform to
continue to obstruct legislation.
To solve these problems as well
as the three major issues previ
ously mentioned, Thomas advo
i cated the rise of a more powerful
j State government. "And by State
government, I don't mean omni
potent tyrant but a democratic
Federal power which both works
and co-exists with voluntary as
sociations such as labor unions
land business organizations but

j biter."

The nation has made some
progress in civil rights, he re
marked, but the "religion of
white supremacy" is not native
to Mississippi alone; its origins

are much more diverse. "We can
see this in the continuance of
legislation favoring segregation
in many states, in the vote of the
people of Texas just last Satur
day in favor of keeping the dis
criminatory poll tax, an d the
choruses of those people, unfor
tunately very numerous in this
country, who think we are going
too far too fast."

Norman Thomas, who just re
turned from Mississippi, pre
faced his speech l>y thanking:
the members of the Stanford
community who helped in the
recent mock vote there. "Your
participation showed the Uni
versity world at its best, "he
staled. "Your aid, which was
most significant in the cam
paign, effectively rebuked the
racists oil both sides."

2) THE ECONOMY-Although
this country has an affluent so
ciety, its economy is based upon
the economics of scarcity instead [
of tlie economics of abundance,
Thomas explained. Instead of pro- !
ducing and dispersing necessities, 1
U.S. economy concentrates on j
war stuffs and excess luxuries.
He blamed a great deal of the!
world's economic woes on the fact i
that "in two-fifths of the world i
we have people living on mar-;
ginal subsistence while at the [
same time, according to United
Nations figures, $120 billion is j
spent on war." This brought him |
to the third issue:
S) WAR ANI) PEACE Thomas j
asserted that the most dominant j
religion in the world today is na-:
tionalism. "Is the religion of na-;
tlonalism the result of inculcation j
by the State?" he asked. In most !
countries, yes, hut not in the U.S. j
Rather, he found that the pres
ent administration was "ahead of
the people" in this respect.
He also found no solution in
unilateral disarmament, which he
opposed for "psychological rea
sons"; rather, the answer lies in
universal disarmament with con
trols supervised by a more pow
erful UN.
"Senator Goldwater does not
seem to see our problems in this
light." Thomas continued. "He
seems to feel that this nation is
in greater danger of being under
mined by continued spending in
the fields of Health, Education,
and Welfare rather than in un
necessary military expenditure to
obtain an overwhelming superior
ity in 'overkill.'"
While on the subject of Gold
water. Thomas resisted the sug
gestion that liberals ought to be
in favor of the Arizonian's nomi
nation. "I find Goldwater's nomi
nation a terrible wage to pay for
liberal salvation," he snapped.
Besides, he added, it won't help
this country any in changing a
i "crazy" legislative system that
i allows committee chairmen who
are in radical disagreement with
; even the broadest policies of their
i own party's policy platform to
continue to obstruct legislation.
To solve these problems as well
as the three major issues previ
ously mentioned, Thomas advo
i cated the rise of a more powerful
j State government. "And by State
government, I don't mean omni
potent tyrant but a democratic
Federal power which both works
and co-exists with voluntary as
sociations such as labor unions
land business organizations but
I maintains its role as final ar
j biter."
"It is absolutely necessary to
have a powerful State to guaran
tee justice and other basic civil
rights to individuals," declared
Norman Thomas, six-time Presi
dential candidate of the American |
Socialist Party, to a packed house
at Cubberley Auditorium yester- :
day.
Thomas, whose speech was en
tit led "The Role of the State in
Confronting Our Times," dis
cussed the three major issues
confronting the U.S. today civil •
rights, war and peace, and the
general economy as well as com
menting on the philosophy and ,
possible nomination of Republican ;
Senator Barry Goldwater and the :
need for Congressional reforms, i
1) CIVIL RIGHTS "We have
found that justice cannot be pro- i
tected except by Federal law in i
this field. You cannot legislate j
fraternal love. But you can give j
mankind a chance by establishing
certain legal frameworks. You
can help wipe out a history of
infamy in this area," Thomas de
clared.
