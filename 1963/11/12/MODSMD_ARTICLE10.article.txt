# FCC Asks KPFA to File Non-Communist Affidavits
## 
### BILL SMITH Contributing Editor 
The Federal Communications Commission, in a precedent-shut
tering move, has asked the Board of Directors of the Pacifica Foun
dation, owners of radio station KPFA, to file questionnaires stating
whether foundation personnel are now, or have ever been, members
of the Communist Party.
KPFA has been under investigation by the FCC and the Senate
Internal Security Sub-Commit tee 4-

iince January of this year for i
Uleged "Communist infiltration." :
rho investigation was instigated
)y questions raised about the
presentation of Communist speak- |
M's on the station and began when i
<PFA requested a renewal of its
icense. Renewal has been with- I
leld pending the conclusion of i
he investigation. The station is :
•urrently operating on a "de- !
[erred renewal license."
In a statement released for 1
publication yesterday, the Pacifica
Foundation said, "It is not the
policy of Pacifica to inquire into i
the political or religious affilia
tion of its personnel or to conduct i
investigations to that end.
"WE JUDGE the good character j
honesty, loyalty and commitments !
to the United States Constitution i
and to the preservation of its in- j
stitutions by the quality of their
(the staff's! work and by the acts
which express the idea and beliefs
that motivate their lives." -
The foundation concluded their
statement like this: "We are con
fident that on the basis of the
submission and the record of our;
operation, the FCC will conclude]
that we operate 'in the public in-.
terest and necessity.' "
The directors of the Foundation j
said that they are, at present,
preparing a petition to the FCC.
The Commission has given the
station until Dec. 16 to reply.
Jack H. Friedenthal, associate
professor of Law at Stanford,
when contacted by the Daily, said,
"The legal aspects of the problem
are very difficult. There have
been two views in the past: (1)
When public interest is involved,
the government has the right to
require such information as it
needs and <2) the government is
not entitled to inquire into these
areas at all."
"THE LATTER view lias been
mostly refuted. Such affidavits
(as those requested of KPFA)
have been* upheld. Bui there are
still two issues involved. If they
(KPFA) refuse, does this make
them against the public interest?
(Whether people are Communist
or not may have some bearing on
the public interest.) But more
central to the issue is what does
I he FCC hope to do with this in
formation? If this information is
to be used to refuse a license re
newal to KPFA, then a ticklish
legal problem arrises. An analogy
might be cited.
"Can the California Bar Asso
ciation inquire into whether a
man is a Communist? The an
swer seems to be 'yes.' But can
they then stop him from becom
ing a lawyer in California? The
i Supreme Court in one case has
; seemed to say 'no.'
"PERHAPS the analogy is valid,
j perhaps not. Nothing comparable
I to this situation has yet arrisen,"
! Friedenthal said.
John D. Lewis, acting assistant
professor of communication here,
said, "These people (KPFA) and
almost any other stations could
stand on their righls. They may
feel this is a violation of the free
' dom of the press.
"However, in the licensing of
a station, one of the FCC require
; merits is that these (stations* can
! not be licensed to any foreign
power. If they were members of

the Communist Party, it might
prohibit their continued owner
ship."
Dr. James Brinton of the Com
munications Department said
"The Smith Act does in fact re
quire that members of the Com
munist Party register as agents
i of a foreign power. Whether this
would be grounds to revoke
1 KPFA's license would have to be
i determined in court."

The Federal Communications Commission, in a precedent-shut
tering move, has asked the Board of Directors of the Pacifica Foun
dation, owners of radio station KPFA, to file questionnaires stating
whether foundation personnel are now, or have ever been, members
of the Communist Party.
KPFA has been under investigation by the FCC and the Senate
Internal Security Sub-Commit tee 4-

iince January of this year for i
Uleged "Communist infiltration." :
rho investigation was instigated
)y questions raised about the
presentation of Communist speak- |
M's on the station and began when i
<PFA requested a renewal of its
icense. Renewal has been with- I
leld pending the conclusion of i
he investigation. The station is :
•urrently operating on a "de- !
[erred renewal license."
In a statement released for 1
publication yesterday, the Pacifica
Foundation said, "It is not the
policy of Pacifica to inquire into i
the political or religious affilia
tion of its personnel or to conduct i
investigations to that end.
"WE JUDGE the good character j
honesty, loyalty and commitments !
to the United States Constitution i
and to the preservation of its in- j
stitutions by the quality of their
(the staff's! work and by the acts
which express the idea and beliefs
that motivate their lives." -
The foundation concluded their
statement like this: "We are con
fident that on the basis of the
submission and the record of our;
operation, the FCC will conclude]
that we operate 'in the public in-.
terest and necessity.' "
The directors of the Foundation j
said that they are, at present,
preparing a petition to the FCC.
The Commission has given the
station until Dec. 16 to reply.
Jack H. Friedenthal, associate
professor of Law at Stanford,
when contacted by the Daily, said,
"The legal aspects of the problem
are very difficult. There have
been two views in the past: (1)
When public interest is involved,
the government has the right to
require such information as it
needs and <2) the government is
not entitled to inquire into these
areas at all."
"THE LATTER view lias been
mostly refuted. Such affidavits
(as those requested of KPFA)
have been* upheld. Bui there are
still two issues involved. If they
(KPFA) refuse, does this make
them against the public interest?
(Whether people are Communist
or not may have some bearing on
the public interest.) But more
central to the issue is what does
I he FCC hope to do with this in
formation? If this information is
to be used to refuse a license re
newal to KPFA, then a ticklish
legal problem arrises. An analogy
might be cited.
"Can the California Bar Asso
ciation inquire into whether a
man is a Communist? The an
swer seems to be 'yes.' But can
they then stop him from becom
ing a lawyer in California? The
i Supreme Court in one case has
; seemed to say 'no.'
"PERHAPS the analogy is valid,
j perhaps not. Nothing comparable
I to this situation has yet arrisen,"
! Friedenthal said.
John D. Lewis, acting assistant
professor of communication here,
said, "These people (KPFA) and
almost any other stations could
stand on their righls. They may
feel this is a violation of the free
' dom of the press.
"However, in the licensing of
a station, one of the FCC require
; merits is that these (stations* can
! not be licensed to any foreign
power. If they were members of

the Communist Party, it might
prohibit their continued owner
ship."
Dr. James Brinton of the Com
munications Department said
"The Smith Act does in fact re
quire that members of the Com
munist Party register as agents
i of a foreign power. Whether this
would be grounds to revoke
1 KPFA's license would have to be
i determined in court."
