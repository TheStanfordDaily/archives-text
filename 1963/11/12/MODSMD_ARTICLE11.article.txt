# Van Tamelen Synthesizes New Benzene
## 
### 
Eugene van Tamelen, Stanford
University chemist, has synthe
sized Dewar benzene, a chemical
substance believed impossible to
create and capture. Van Tamelen\s
associate in the Dewar benzene
work was Dr. Socrates Pappas of
Brandeis University.
The research was begun three
years ago at the University of
Wisconsin, where Pappas was his
student.
"Not until this summer were
we sure we had succeeded," said
the Stanford investigator. "Our
studies of the material, partic
ularly with nuclear magnetic res
onance techniques, leave no doubt
that it's Dewar benzene."
WHILE THE FULL signifiance
of the discovery cannot be imme
diately assessed, it is certain to
open up new research avenues of
tremendous proportions. Hun
dreds of thousands of new ma
terials can be created by substitu
ting Dewar benzene for ordinary
benzene in countless familiar com
pounds.
The new molecule has a slightly
different "ring" structure which
endows it with different proper
ties. It contains higher energy, is
less stable and hence combines
more easily with other molecules.
This means that known benzene
i compounds formed with itâ€”mod
j icine, plastics, perhaps even food
j stuffs would also be different.
The investigators found two
| ways of preparing Dewar ben
j zene. both involving ultra-violet
! irradiation as an energy source
' for the key reaction. It can be
i stored for months under sub-zero
! refrigeration or for days at room
: temporal lire.
The two researchers published
i a report of their work, which was
supported by the Petroleum Re
search Fund and the U.S. Public
Health Service, in the current
Journal of the American Chem
ical Society.
1 Van Tamelen joined the Stan
ford faculty in 1962. He is noted
for earlier syntheses of natural
products including colchicine, a
drug used for the treatment of
gout and rheumatism, and in
j modified form for cancer. In
! 1961 he won the American Chem
ical Society's Award for Pure
i Chemistry.
