# Hour Rules Lifted At U. of Wisconsin
## 
### 
Senior women at the Univer
sity of Wisconsin were freed from
all hours restrictions in a rules
change which went into effect on
November 1. The revolutionary
change also permits unrestricted
hours for junior women on week
ends.
The new rules were effective
at 31 women's houses, but several
of the houses have curtailed or
modified the "no-hours" provision
of the plan. The rules changes ex
tended the closing times to 11
p.m. for weekdays and to 1 a.m.
on weekends. Greater use of 1
a.m. nights during the week was
also provided for.
The plans went into effort for
houses which received "complete
formal approval" for their plans,
provided that the dean of wom
en's office has notified the house
that the plan is acceptable and
that the plan has been explained
at a house meeting.
