. . . Because many of our stu
dents come hero with totally ex
aggerated ideas about the ease
with which important concepts
are added to man's store, we
dearly have the responsibility of
providing a decent basis of per
spective to which the student will
eventually be able to relate his
own particular talents. But to

I achieve this end implies that
I freshman courses — especially
those of the single-sweep survey
| type must be taught by people
who are fa) themselves possessed
of a good sense of perspective and
lb) are deeply committed to the
principle that the transmission of
the sense of perspective is a good
thing.
Both of these requirements im
ply that the teacher exercises a
choice based on a set of values:
in the first case, the personal
choice of what Is significant
(hopefully combined with an ex
plicit recognition that the judg
ment of significance involves
some idiosyncracy and possibly
some prejudice); and in the sec
ond case, a belief that the trans
mission function is sufficiently

worthy as to demand the utmost
of one's talents. Although stu
dents can only rarely form a judg
ment regarding the teacher's
assessment of what is significant
and what is not, they have a pro
found insight into the attitude
that the teacher exhibits regard
ing the importance or unimport
ance of his role in transmitting
knowledge and perspective.
. . . Whatever the facts may be
as the faculty perceives them the
facts from the student viewpoint
are that with some shining excep
tions the faculty has no serious
concern for the freshman, who is
at his most vulnerable state, dur
ing the first six months or so in
college. . . .
Academic institutions in this
country seem to me to be parti
cularly prone to narcissistic and
introspective tendencies — as,
around here, the phrase "edge of
greatness" and others like it regu
larly remind us—and both within
and without institutions there are
openly and widely expressed opin
ions about which areas of the
university ai-e "great" and which
are not. Students are well aware
of this, and they recognize that
such judgments of greatness have
to be settled by some sei of stand
ards. ,
Students, by and large, know
quite well what reputations vari
ous departments have both on and
off the campus, and they see, I
think, that the reputation of a
department outside the campus is
determined almost entirely by
the quantity and quality of re
search carried out by the depart
ment. They frequently discover
that the impact of the department
on the undergraduate student is
unrelated to the outside reputa
tion, and they came squarely in
contact with the fact Ihat the stu
dents' standard of evaluation, as
judged by the department's con
cern for him, is generally differ
ent from that accepted by either
the faculty at large or officially
adopted for "image-making" pur
poses. They suspect (and I be
lieve they are right in doing so)
that there is a somewhat hypocri
tical double standard of values;
one set which is good for the pub
lic relations and fund-raising side
of the university, and another, to
which lip-service is often paid but
which is not for genuine internal
consumption, but rather for the
pietistic salving of our corporate
conscience.
It is, moreover, of little rele
vance to a student to be told that
such and such a department has
many outstanding scholars on its
staff if these eminent folk never
come into contact with him. And
this takes on, for the undergradu
ate, an added sting when he recog
nizes that, at least in general
terms, the "upgrading" of the fac
ulty has been for the benefit of
the graduate and postdoctoral
student. For the undergraduate is
intelligent enough to perceive
that there may be some myth as
well as substance to the current
emphasis on "graduate education"
—this now being the O.K. word
for research in academic circles.
Because, at the lowest level of
interpretation, which some stu
dents suspect to bo the truest
evaluation, graduate and p os t
doctoral students have a "useful
ness" to faculty bent on increas
ing their individual and collective
reputations. In other words, and
in the crudest terms,support goes
to where it "pays off."
ANYONE WHO HAS had his
hands wet in undergraduate prob
lems knows that there are many
apparent signs of unrest in the
student body—by which I mean
the undergraduate student body.
This unrest often takes forms
which embarrass administrators.
And if one were to look at the
more extreme forms of rebellion,
one might conclude that our un
dergraduate students have little
on their minds except sex, drink,
and generally being "against the
government."
In fact, I do not believe these
to be a matter of serious concern
for the majority of our students,
or even for many of those who
stand up and wave the banners
of revolution and emancipation.
The committee on Student Serv
ices and Affairs, to be sure,
spends a lot of its time fighting
brush fires arising from issues
of this kind. Yet although unrest
often takes strange forms a n d
student proposals oft*n get sup
port from other students who
have no deep respect for some of
the causes that are espoused. I
am nevertheless of the opinion
that most of the things that con
stitute problems for administra
tors are not basic causes of con
cern but are symptoms of a gen
eral undergraduate malady; that

of not knowing (and of never be
ing clearly told» what ihe relation
of students to the entire academic
tradition really is; of feeling by
passed. but not knowing how
properly to formulate what they
perceive to be real grievances; of
not knowing to whom they can ex
press their dissatisfactions; and
of feeling that there is nowhere
to turn to find respect (not neces
sarily equated with action) for
! their views.
There seems to he a genuine
difficulty of communication be
tween students and administra
tors, and 1 believe it is unreason
! able to assume that the faults lie
j entirely on one side, even though
, students sometimes mistake stri
! dent declamation for communica
! tion. It seems to be that the
ameliorative function of the fac-
I ulty in assisting communication
' is largely absent, and this is par
ticularly unfortunate when the
I faculty, by patient and sympa
thetic hearing (which is to be dis
tinguished from agreeing) could
i do so much to relieve the tensions
1 that build up, as well as helping
! to clarify for students those issues
i which are Teal and pressing.
Finally, from the student view
| point, there is no doubt at all in
my mind that we on the faculty
are not merely expected to assisl
j in establishing values; we cannot
i avoid it except by avoiding all
j contact with them.
NOW, IF I MAY depart from
the student viewpoint, let me ana
lyze my own feelings about these
matters as they affect me in my
capacity as a teacher. In the first
place, I was attracted into the
teaching profession, and remain
in it, by what seemed to me to
be a nobility attaching to teach
ing. I was taught early in life
that "scholarship" comprises the
great imaginative insights of man
and that the teacher is the tem
porary custodian of the precious
accumulation. I was taught that
to hand on, and to add to, this
I store is one of the greatest of
! privileges, that carries with it
! the obligation to be of service to
! others at whatever cost to self
i service might be involved. I have
| no grounds for rejecting that be
lief now. . . .
But—and I must say this at the
risk of appearing tainted with
self-rightousness—this sense of
obligation appears to be much
weaker, if not absent, in many of
the young men who come around
applying for faculty positions.
There seems to be a general no
tion that the obligation to teach
I (even in its most narrow peda
gogical sense) is a tiresome com
! mitment which one must embrace
in order to practice the much
more important function of add
ing to the stock of knowledge.
That one might undertake this
obligation, not merely with a
sense of indebtedness but with ac
tual joy seems to many recruits
to our profession a notion that is
archaic if not downright laugh
able. And, indeed, who am I that
I should try to counter such an
attitude when many very practi
cal official attitudes seem to con
firm the self-oriented and disci
pline-oriented young man in his
beliefs.
NOW THERE IS nothing par
ticularly new in this emphasis on
research activities, even though
it, might be new in..an institution
as young as Stanford* fii siy own
university the cyclic swings on
the transmission-origination im
balance have occurred many
times. And I believe that history
shows clearly that when universi
ties get into a state of imbalance
they develop all the symptoms of
ill health: student unrest, faculty
unrest, cleavage into camps of
"teachers" an d "researchers,"
first and second-class citizenship,
and the rest. Academic sickness,
however, may well be a more seri
ous matter when, as there are at
least some grounds for suspect
ing, the individual emphasis on
research stems from -not only a
burning desire to add to man's
knowledge but also self-interest
and ambition, and when the cor
porate emphasis on research
stems at least in part from th e
notion that to acquire large sup
port for research is an end in it
self rather than as a means to
attaining goals firmly rooted in
values other than mere size or
financial grandeur.
It seems to me that there are
values in the academic enter
prise that long antedate Stanford
and even antedate all American
universities. These values have
been rich in altruism and gener
osity towards the young, and we
need to be at some pains to con
serve them. This means that we
have to hold and exhibit some set
of values that transcends the tem
porary and opportunistic. . . .
