# Hutchinson, Alum 'Review' See Student Action Superficially
## 
### 
In the most recent issue of the Alumni Association's "Stan
ford Review," editor Dan Endsley speaks of the "student re
volt against authority," notes that it "is not confined to Stan
ford," and mentions "means of maintaining control." His com
ments are in closing to a melange of anecdotes ranging from
student beatniks to student sophomoricism. He headlines the
page with the "Campus Voice" slogan, "Help Undermine the
Administration of Your Choice."
Professor Eric Hutchinson, in the speech reprinted in part
on this page notes, "there are many apparent signs of unrest
in . . . the undergraduate student body. This unrest often
takes forms which embarrass administrators. And if one were
to look at the more extreme forms of rebellion, one might
conclude that our undergraduate students have little on their
minds except sex, drink, and generally being 'against the gov
ernment.' In fact, 1 do not believe these to be matters of
serious concern for the majority of our students, or even for
many of those who stand up and wave the banners of revolu
tion and emancipation."
Having reduced student/administration clash to "generally
being 'against the government,'" and "waving banners of
revolution and emancipation,"—a reduction Mr. Endsley would
seemingly second and epitomize caustically with the "Cam
pus Voice" slogan—Professor Hutchinson concludes that the
whole problem could be solved by "patient and sympathetic
hearing" on the part of the faculty, and by students being told
where they can express their views, although not necessarily
find action on them.
Both these men—one supposedly interpreting student ac
tions to the alumni and the other to faculty—grossly misunder
stand the unrest and dissent that has come to mark Stanford
student action.
In the past tliree years, Stanford students have clashed
with the administrators of this University on the liquor policy,
co-educational housing, students speaking out on "off campus
issues," student representation in University decision-making
bodies, religion on campus, and the retaining of faculty and
deans. These clashes are not the result of "student revolt
against authority" merely for the sake of revolt, nor of the
waving of banners merely to have a cause. The clash is the
product of a student generation that is well aware that it is
endowed with wealth and privilege, and therefore makes high
demands upon itself in terms of socially meaningful action,
and high demands upon its educators in terms of University
goals and organization.
The student government has dedicated itself to considera
tion of the deepening of Stanford education, and an analysis
of the most productive student role in that education. These
concerns of student government have led to student/adminis
tration clash not because students are possessed with the
desire to rebel, but because students are making new demands
upon the university. And because of the nature of these de
mands, the clash will not be resolved by a paternalistic "sym
pathetic hearing" divorced from thoughts of action, or by
"means of control" used to appease adolescent revolt. On.,
would think that those who have dealt with several student
generations could distinguish between rebellion against au
thority and intellectual questioning and demands, and that
the first would be subject to the approach favored by Pro
fessor Hutchinson and Mr. Endsley while the second would
be stimulated and acted upon by our administors.
In his address, Professor Hutchinson presents perccptive
and sensitive analyses of such questions as student reactions
to research versus teaching and the role of the university in
the formulation of values. His remarks are particularly wel
come in that he is a man who is not ashamed to formulate
and speak out upon his conception of the purposes of a uni
versity. It is most sad then, that in speaking of student action
he reaches the conclusion . . that most of the things that
constitute problems for administrators are not basic causes of
concern but are symptoms of a general undergraduate
malady. . . The issues arc basic causes of concern, and until
this is recognized by faculty, administration, and alumni
spokesmen, the clash will become more strident.
