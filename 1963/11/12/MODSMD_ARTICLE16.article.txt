## 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
Stanford's soccer leatn remained
undefeated Saturday as they
scored two first half goals a n d
held on the rest of the way to
whip the California Bears. 2-0 at
Berkeley.
The victory assured Stanford
of at least a lie for the Nor-Cal
conference championship. San
Jose State would be forced to win
all of its remaining three contests,
while Stanford would have to
drop its two remaining games,
in order to give the Spartans a
tie with Stanford. Any other com
bination will give Ihe Indians un
disputed possession of the top
spot.
THE KID HOT Cards were in
control all the way at Cal as they
won their ninth consecutive game
this season. Don Griffith headed
a cross field pass from Klas Berg
man into the Cal net in the first
period for the undefeated Tribe's
Initial tally.
The second score was registered
on the combined effort of A 1 Nnoli
and Don Deschert who both got a
foot on the ball in a rush in the
second quarter. From then on
Stanford played what Coach Prid
dle said was "a very good, steady
game" and held on the rest of
the way.
Coach Priddle was jubilant over
the team's progress so far this
year and remarked that his team
will "probably be the favorite" in

regional competition for a birth
in the NCAA semifinals.
"Tin; BOYS went out an rl
scored early in the first half and
then didn't Jet down at all in the
second," added Priddle, "our de
fense chargcd and 1 was very'
pleased with the whole squad's |
play."
Tomorrow night the hootersi
take on San Jose under ihe lights ,
in San Jose. The last game the
two team's played ended in a 3-2
squeaker which Stanford pulled
out in overtime. A victory would
insure ihe Cards sole ownership'
of the league crown.
