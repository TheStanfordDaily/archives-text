The Stanford water polo team's
season long win streak eame to
an abrupt hall this weekend wilh
a 4-3 loss to UCLA Friday night
and a 7-4 defeat ai the hands of
USC Saturday morning. The
losses dropped the Indians to sec
ond in the league but probably
had little effect on their national
standing as Long Beach and USC
have also lost two games on the
season.
Friday night, against UCLA,
the Indians met a team which
was ically "up" for the game.

Stanford played very loose de
fense until the final period when
the score was 1-1 and it was then
too late. The game moved very
slowly as UCLA was playing a
ball-control game on offense and
was collapsing on Marty Hull
when the Indians had the ball.
Till'] CARDS were still in good
shape at the end of the first quar
ter with the score 1-1. However,
on the opening sprint in the sec
ond period, UCLA broke a man
free and took a quick 2-1 lead,
lie fore the quarter ended they
scored one more goal and led 3-1.
From the start of the second
half to the end of the game, the
Bruins played a ball control game.
There wore only 27 shots taken
in the entire game and Stanford
took 14 of these. (Stanford has
been averaging close to 3.1 shots
a game, i
The Cards were able to score
two more goals but they could
not get the ball enough to do any
greater damage. Pete Pettigrew
scored once for the Indians a n d
Marty Hull twice.
Till; INDIAN poloists were
ready for the big game with USC.
Goals by Bill Ready, Hull and Pet
tigrew gave Stanford a 3-2 leaf!
at the end of the first half. Stan
ford also held a large margin in
the foul department at the end of
the first half with Don Buehler
already out and everyone else in
extreme danger.
The third quarter spelled dis
aster for the Cards. Marty Hull
fouled out early in the period and
was promptly followed by the
rest of the starting field. All thir
teen players who made the trip
were used by Coach Gaughran
in the game. Reserve goalie Jim
Ellis was even forced to play in
the field when no regular players
were left.
Fouls made Ihe difference in
the game. Stanford had 29 fouls
called on Iheir players while SC
had only 11. Calls against the
Indians were so.numerous that
the Trojans were able to control
the ball most of the game. Five
of the seven SC goals were scored
after Stanford fouls. All-American
Ray Sarri scored only one goal
in the contest for the Trojans.
THi: SCORING for Stanford
was done by Ready, who had one
goal, Hull, with two, and Petti
grew who scored once. Friday
night the Cards face the Argen
tina national water polo team at
8:00 p.m. in the Stanford pool.
Argentina placed third in the Pan-
