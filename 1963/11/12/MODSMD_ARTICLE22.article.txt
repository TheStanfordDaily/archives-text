SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE
AND JAZZ LTKE THAT

I am now an elderly gentleman, full of years and aches, l>ui
my thoughts keep ever turning to my undergraduate days. This
is called "arrested development."
But 1 cannot stop the healing tide of nostalgia that washes
over ine as 1 recall those golden campus d;iys, those ivy-covered
buildings (actually, at my college, there was only ivy: no bricks),
those, pulse-tingling lectures on John 1 Dry den and Cotton
Mather, the many friends 1 made, the many deans I hit.
1 know some of you are already dreading the day when you
graduate and lose touch with all your merry classmates. It is
my pleasant task today to assure you that it need not he so;
all you have to do is join the Alumni Association and every year
you will receive a bright, newsy, chatty bulletin, chock-full of
tidings about your old buddies.
Oh, what a red-letter day it is at my house, the day the
Alumni Bulletin arrives! T cancel all my engagements, take the
phone off the hook, dismiss my resident osteopath, put the
cheetah outside, and settle down for an evening of pure pleasure
with the Bulletin and (need I add?) a good supply of Marlboro
('israrettcs.

Whenever T am having fun, a Marlboro makes 1 lie fun oven
more fun. That filter, that flavor, that yielding soft pack, that
firm Flip Top box, never fails to heighten my pleasure whether
T am playing Double Canfield or watching the radio or knitting
an afghan or enjoying any other diverting pursuit you might
name—except, of course, spear fishing. But then, how much
spear fishing does one do in Clovis, New Mexico, where 112 live?
But I digress. Let us return to my Alumni Bulletin and the
fascinating news about my old friends and classmates. I quote
from the current issue:
"Well, fellow alums, it certainly has been a wing-dinger of a
year for us old grads! Remember Mildred Cheddar and Harry
Camembert, those crazy kids who always held hands in Econ II?
Well, they're married now and living in Clovis, Xew Mexico,
where Harry rents spear-fishing equipment.and Mildred has just
given birth to a lovely 28-pound daughter, her second in four
months. Nice going, Mildred and Harry 1
"Remember Jethro Brie, the man we voted most likely to
succeed? Well, old Jethro is still gathering laurels! Last week
he was voted 'Motorman of the Year' by his follow workers in
the Dulutb streetcar system. T owe it all to my brakoman,'
said Jethro in a characteristically modest acceptance speech.
Same old Jethro!
"Probably the most glamorous time had by any of us old
alums was had by Francis Macomber last year. He went on a
big game hunting safari all the way to Africa! We received many
interesting post cards from Francis until he was, alas, acci
dentally shot and killed by his wife and white hunter. Tough
luck, Francis!
"Wilametta 'Dcndeye' Macomber, widow of the late beloved
Francis Macomber, was married yesterday to Fred 'Sureshot'
Sigafoos, white hunter, in a simple double-ring ceremony in
Nairobi. Many happy returns, Wilametta and Fred!
"Well, alums, that just about wraps it up for this year.
Buy bonds!!'

Old grads, new grads, undergrade, and non-grads all agree:
that good Richmond tobacco recipe, that clean Selectrate
filler, hare turned all fifty stales of the Union into Marlboro
Country. It on't you join Ihe throng?

Old grads, new grads, undergrade, and non-grads all agree:
that good Richmond tobacco recipe, that clean Selectrate
filler, hare turned all fifty stales of the Union into Marlboro
Country. It on't you join Ihe throng?


SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE
AND JAZZ LTKE THAT

I am now an elderly gentleman, full of years and aches, l>ui
my thoughts keep ever turning to my undergraduate days. This
is called "arrested development."
But 1 cannot stop the healing tide of nostalgia that washes
over ine as 1 recall those golden campus d;iys, those ivy-covered
buildings (actually, at my college, there was only ivy: no bricks),
those, pulse-tingling lectures on John 1 Dry den and Cotton
Mather, the many friends 1 made, the many deans I hit.
1 know some of you are already dreading the day when you
graduate and lose touch with all your merry classmates. It is
my pleasant task today to assure you that it need not he so;
all you have to do is join the Alumni Association and every year
you will receive a bright, newsy, chatty bulletin, chock-full of
tidings about your old buddies.
Oh, what a red-letter day it is at my house, the day the
Alumni Bulletin arrives! T cancel all my engagements, take the
phone off the hook, dismiss my resident osteopath, put the
cheetah outside, and settle down for an evening of pure pleasure
with the Bulletin and (need I add?) a good supply of Marlboro
('israrettcs.

Whenever T am having fun, a Marlboro makes 1 lie fun oven
more fun. That filter, that flavor, that yielding soft pack, that
firm Flip Top box, never fails to heighten my pleasure whether
T am playing Double Canfield or watching the radio or knitting
an afghan or enjoying any other diverting pursuit you might
name—except, of course, spear fishing. But then, how much
spear fishing does one do in Clovis, New Mexico, where 112 live?
But I digress. Let us return to my Alumni Bulletin and the
fascinating news about my old friends and classmates. I quote
from the current issue:
"Well, fellow alums, it certainly has been a wing-dinger of a
year for us old grads! Remember Mildred Cheddar and Harry
Camembert, those crazy kids who always held hands in Econ II?
Well, they're married now and living in Clovis, Xew Mexico,
where Harry rents spear-fishing equipment.and Mildred has just
given birth to a lovely 28-pound daughter, her second in four
months. Nice going, Mildred and Harry 1
"Remember Jethro Brie, the man we voted most likely to
succeed? Well, old Jethro is still gathering laurels! Last week
he was voted 'Motorman of the Year' by his follow workers in
the Dulutb streetcar system. T owe it all to my brakoman,'
said Jethro in a characteristically modest acceptance speech.
Same old Jethro!
"Probably the most glamorous time had by any of us old
alums was had by Francis Macomber last year. He went on a
big game hunting safari all the way to Africa! We received many
interesting post cards from Francis until he was, alas, acci
dentally shot and killed by his wife and white hunter. Tough
luck, Francis!
"Wilametta 'Dcndeye' Macomber, widow of the late beloved
Francis Macomber, was married yesterday to Fred 'Sureshot'
Sigafoos, white hunter, in a simple double-ring ceremony in
Nairobi. Many happy returns, Wilametta and Fred!
