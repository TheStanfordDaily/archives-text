LONDON Communist leaders have proposed that "Soviet Prem
ier Nikita S. Khrushchev meet Ilod Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung in
a face-to-face challenge on the Moscow-Peking ideological dispute,
Iron Curtain sources said Monday.
The move, initiated by leading Communists from satellites and
from parties outside the Red bloc, apparently has produced no con
crete results thus far.
British experts said they anticipate failure of the effort because
of the strong personal antagonism between the two world Commu
nist leaders.
Nevertheless, the mediation move was understood to be going
ahead, with pressures on the Kremlin and Peking to end the feud,
said to be endangering the unity of Communist parties worldwide.
JEWS TO BE EXONERATED Vatican City The Ecumenical
Council document exonerating the Jewish people of the sole guilt
for the death of Jesus Christ, if approved, will mark a bold reversal
of Roman Catholic tradition.
Copies of the historic document were distributed to the council
fathers last week. Sources said there is a good possibility that it
will be debated at the current session. Approval appears likely.
The words of Pope Innocent 111 and the actions of his council in
1215 is assumed here to be one of the major reasons for the drafting
of the current document. Innocent told churchmcn at the Fourth
Lateran Council that Jews were eternally condemned to servitude.

tonio Segni Monday asked Christian Democratic party leader Aldo
More, 47, to form a new government and end the deep political crisis

alliance with the leftwing Socialists and the Social Democrats and
Republicans. But his political path is long and steep with the Com
munists threatening trouble and his own party divided.
