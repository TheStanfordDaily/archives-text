The following resolution was
drafted at a meeting yesterday

the Civil Liberties Union. Stan-'
ford Area Young Democrats,
Stanford Peace Caucus and Stan
ford Student Congress Executive
Board. The resolution will be in
troduced by Gary Schoolnik,

WHEREAS: the Federal Com
munications Commission, by au
thority of the Federal Commu
nications Act of 1934, has served
the 14 members of the board of
directors and the three station
managers of the Pacifica Foun
dation of America with an affi
davit requiring them to report
the nature of their affiliation
I with any organization deemed
subversive by the United States
Government;
WHEREAS: the worth of the
Pacifica Foundation has been
manifested to our community
through its member station
KPFA in Berkeley;
WHEREAS: such affidavits are
being required of no other radio
stations; be it therefore
RESOLVED THAT: the Federal
Communications Commission
has established no legitimate
grounds for the continuing in
vestigation of the Pacifica
Foundation and KPFA. This
we believe constitutes harass
ment and is not in the public
interest or necessity.
The Stanford Student Congress
mandates the speaker of the
Congress to send copies of this
resolution to Mr. Russ Jorgen
sen. Chairman of the Board of
Directors of the Pacifica Foun
