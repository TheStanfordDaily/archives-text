# Japanese System of Education And College Life Differ from U.S.
## 
### SHEILA RICKETTS 
(This is the conclusion of a two-part article.)
Our opportunities to observe Japanese student
life were in one sense limited since we were in
Japan during the summer break and the Univer
sity was not in session. But we lived in ihe homes
of University students and we traveled widely
with members of the Keio 1111.
The Japanese education pattern is in one way
the reverse of thai of the United States. Japanese
students do a great deal of work in high school
because of the intense competition to get into the
"best" universities. Once they reach tlie Univer
sity. however, they tend to relax and to do less
work.
THE ORGANIZATION of classes is also differ
ent. Students take around fifteen classes at one
time and these classes continue for an entire year
rather than for a quarter or a semester.
An interesting problem is raised by the nature
of the Japanese language. Term papers, of course,
cannot bo typed and they must be carefully writ
ten out by hand. Penmanship is still much more
important to a Japanese student than to an Amer
ican.
Economics is a tremendously popular subject
, for Japanese boys. The businessman holds a pres
| tigeous place in society that it not equalled even
1 by doctors or lawyers.
AM. OF THE STUDENTS that I met had
j studied at least some English, even if they were
j specializing in other languages. For example. No
hu Tsuji, a Chinese literature major, that I met
is fluent in English.
The English Speaking Society (ESS > is one «»I"
the most dynamic groups on most campuses. At

Doshisha University in Kyoto, I spoke to a group
which met during the second month of the sum
mer break to practice English for three hours
every morning even though they received no uni
versity credit for this work.
The universities have no social organizations
comparable to fraternities since students usually
live at home and commute. If they must come to
a city from a country home to attend a Univer
sity. they either live with relatives or get an apart
ment, since there are very few dormitories.
SOCIAL RELATIONS often seem strained to
American students as the Japanese explore the
relatively unfamiliar field of dating. I mel Jap
anese girls who had dated the same boy for as
much a year without ever kissing him and others
who as university freshmen or sophomores had
never dated because their parents did not allow it.
Such observations cannot be generalized to the
entire Japanese student population, however, be
cause Japanese society is so rapidly changing that
standards and experiences vary widely among in
dividuals and groups.
There are a large number of groups on campus
which are very active. These range from the Insti
tute of International Relations at Keio to the ten
nis club. These clubs are in some ways comparable
to similar organizations in American Universities,
but they are for the most part more bureaucratic
and hierarchical.
As a matter of fact, one of the main differences
th.it I felt between Japanese and American stu
dents is one that cannot easily be defined. It is
mainly an awareness of and a dependence upon
the group and an insistence on hierarchy that was
surprising and sometimes irritating to the Ameri
can students.
