# Bill on KPFA Rights Passes; Few Students Attend Debate
## 
### PERRY ANDERSON 
An important resolution concerning the Federal Communications
Commission's investigation of radio station KPFA was passed last
night by the Student Congress in a session practically devoid of par
ticipants.
So small was the interest shown b> Stanford students in regard
to this bill censuring the FCC that only 25 students were pi. sent

at the opening of the session.*
Even after an attempt to round
up more participants was made by
some of those present, only six;
more students came to the meet
ing. The resolution before the!
Congress passed with little dis
cussion.
The Student Congress resolu
tion, which voices the opinion
that the FCC is unnecessarily
harassing the activities of KPFA,
was passed after being made
stronger by changes in the lan
guage of the resolution.
Although the basic principles
of the resolution that the FCC has
neither a legal nor a moral right
to question a radio station as to
the political affiliations of its
staff — was not questioned, par- j
tieipants in the Congress made
some significant changes in the
resolution's wording.
A fourth clause was added to
the originally suggested resolu
tion. This clause stated that an
investigation into the political be
liefs of a radio station staff is
"An infringement of the freedom
of expression."
The main body of the resolution

►
was substantially refined. It was
I stated that FCC harassment of
the radio station is "in the Mc-
Carth\ tradition." The resolution
[ was also clarified in regard to the
fact that no legitimate evidence
has been publicly established for
the continuing of the FCC investi
gation of KPFA and the Pacifica
Foundation.
Much, furthermore, was added
to the conclusion of the main
body of the resolution. The Stu
dent Congress, as a result, stales
its belief that the FCC should be
"directed by the order of the
President of the United States to
cease immediately the investiga
tions of the Pacifica Founda
tion . . on the grounds that the
FCC has neither proved that the
public interest is at stake no r
that an investigation is war
ranted.
The final form of the resolution
is, then, substantially stronger
than the original form, which ex
pressed only the Student Con
gress's belief that the FCC in
vestigation constituted harass
ment. The original form of the
resolution prescribed no concrete
action by the President to stop
the FCC investigation.
Dennis Sween'ey. President of
the Stanford Student Congress,
was, however, disturbed by the
apparent indifference of political
groups toward this issue. He
stated that: "The debate on the
resolution was not lively or rep
resentative of more than one gen
eral political persuasion on cam
pus. I am very disappointed that
the large number of conservatives
on campus did not participate and
attempt to press a resolution more
to their liking. The speaker of
the Student Congress is open to
suggestion from any political
group on campus in order to make
the Student Congress more acces
sible to them."
