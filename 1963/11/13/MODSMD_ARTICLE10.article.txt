# Bracher Scores De Gaulle's Policies
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD 
"The political integration of
Western Europe is clearly out of
the question in I lie immediate
future, and. as a political concept,
ii may have been irretreivably
undermined by De Gaulle's veto
of British entry into the Common
Market and his fascination with
nationalism," commented Dr. Karl
Bracher, visiting professor a n d
guest lecturer at last week's Tues
day Evening Series, in a wide
ranging discussion at Arroyo
lounge.
Bracher, a professor of Poli
tical Science and Contemporary
History at the University of Bonn
currently working at the Institute
of Behavioral Sciences, was gen
erally pessimistic about the politi
cal integration of Western Eu
rope. Economic integration is one
thing and political integration an
other, he cautioned, and the for
mer has not and probably will
not lead to the latter.
"WHAT IMPETUS there was
toward a fusion of political pow
er was killed by De Gaulle's in
sistanee on his 'Community of
Fatherlands' plan for Europe,"
Bracher added. It was to save this

concept from hostile British pres
sure within the Common Market
that prompted De Gaulle to veto
Britain's entry. "There was a
fair chance of integration before
the veto at least things were
tending in that direction but
now the odds are much worse."
European nationalism, which is
"pretty low" at the present, may
well rise again in the interim, and
the whole movement toward poli
tical-economic unity may well
wither away.
On other matters. Bracher was
less pessimistic. He viewed De
Gaulle's concept of a unilateral
nuclear deter rent as a singularly
Gaullist theorj , which neither the
Germans, "nor even the French
people" seem to be too happy
with. He readily granted that
everyone in NATO "wants to have
a hand in tlv decisions concern
ing nuclear war. to get a hand on
the trigger so to speak, because,
after all. we are the ones who
feel the Soviet presence the most."
IN ANSWER to a question on
the possibility of America's Presi
dent ial-Congression system tak
ing over in Europe. Bracher said
that the U.S. system had been ex
ported to several countries, yet it
onl\ took hold in one the Phil

lipines "elsewhere, it just didn't
work." He cited two reasons for
this: 1 i There are too many par
ties in Europe, and even w here
there are only two (i.e.. Germany >
there is too wide an ideological
gap between them to assure any
kind of cooperation between the
legislative body and the independ
ent executive in any American
style government; 2i The tradi
tion of parliamentary democracy
is too old and too strong to break
"Do Gaulle's Fifth Republic
with its powerful and independent
President is an aberration that
just won't last after his death."
Looking at the Europe of the
future as separate states, he saw:
France as an enigma; the new
Germany and. Britain as rela
tively stable; Ital\. with its "open
ing to the left" as another enig
ma; and Spain, the forgotten man
of Europe, as a country being
pushed toward democracy by the
"revolution" in the Catholic
Church. This last phenomenon,
the "involution" initialed by Pope
John XXIII, will have lasting
effects on the politics of both
Spain and Italy, Bracher said. In
the former, the effects can only
be good; in the latter, only time
can tell.

day Evening Series, in a wide
ranging discussion at Arroyo
lounge.
Bracher, a professor of Poli
tical Science and Contemporary
History at the University of Bonn
currently working at the Institute
of Behavioral Sciences, was gen
erally pessimistic about the politi
cal integration of Western Eu
rope. Economic integration is one
thing and political integration an
other, he cautioned, and the for
mer has not and probably will
not lead to the latter.
"WHAT IMPETUS there was
toward a fusion of political pow
er was killed by De Gaulle's in
sistanee on his 'Community of
Fatherlands' plan for Europe,"
Bracher added. It was to save this

concept from hostile British pres
sure within the Common Market
that prompted De Gaulle to veto
Britain's entry. "There was a
fair chance of integration before
the veto at least things were
tending in that direction but
now the odds are much worse."
European nationalism, which is
"pretty low" at the present, may
well rise again in the interim, and
the whole movement toward poli
tical-economic unity may well
wither away.
On other matters. Bracher was
less pessimistic. He viewed De
Gaulle's concept of a unilateral
nuclear deter rent as a singularly
Gaullist theorj , which neither the
Germans, "nor even the French
people" seem to be too happy
with. He readily granted that
everyone in NATO "wants to have
a hand in tlv decisions concern
ing nuclear war. to get a hand on
the trigger so to speak, because,
after all. we are the ones who
feel the Soviet presence the most."
IN ANSWER to a question on
the possibility of America's Presi
dent ial-Congression system tak
ing over in Europe. Bracher said
that the U.S. system had been ex
ported to several countries, yet it
onl\ took hold in one the Phil

lipines "elsewhere, it just didn't
work." He cited two reasons for
this: 1 i There are too many par
ties in Europe, and even w here
there are only two (i.e.. Germany >
there is too wide an ideological
gap between them to assure any
kind of cooperation between the
legislative body and the independ
ent executive in any American
style government; 2i The tradi
tion of parliamentary democracy
is too old and too strong to break
"Do Gaulle's Fifth Republic
with its powerful and independent
President is an aberration that
just won't last after his death."
Looking at the Europe of the
future as separate states, he saw:
France as an enigma; the new
Germany and. Britain as rela
tively stable; Ital\. with its "open
ing to the left" as another enig
ma; and Spain, the forgotten man
of Europe, as a country being
pushed toward democracy by the
"revolution" in the Catholic
Church. This last phenomenon,
the "involution" initialed by Pope
John XXIII, will have lasting
effects on the politics of both
Spain and Italy, Bracher said. In
the former, the effects can only
be good; in the latter, only time
can tell.
"The political integration of
Western Europe is clearly out of
the question in I lie immediate
future, and. as a political concept,
ii may have been irretreivably
undermined by De Gaulle's veto
of British entry into the Common
Market and his fascination with
nationalism," commented Dr. Karl
Bracher, visiting professor a n d
