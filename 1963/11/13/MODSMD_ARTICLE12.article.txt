# Stone Decries Low Level of Communications

### MARTY MASKALL 
"Man lives in a 'Golden Age' of
physical communications, yet
the love! of human communica
tion has been steadily dropping
in this period of progress," de
clared Julius Stone, visiting pro
fessor of law, in the Tuesday Eve
ning Series presentation last night
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The
speech was followed by a recep
tion in Loro Lounge.
In his speech, entitled "Human
Communication in the Second
Half-Century," Stone attributed
this paradox to the influence of
an increasingly impersonal en
vironment. Professor Stone, cur
rently a fellow at the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavorial
Sciences, is also a professor of
jurisprudence and international
law at the University of Sidney,
Australia.
ATTEMPTS TO communicate
depend not only on physical
means but also on psychological
conditions." Stone pointed out. He
emphasized that we must beware
of progress in science at the ex
pense of human communication.
As an example he cited the busi
nessman of today who may travel
around the world "by communi
cating with none save the air hos
tess and his business associates."
Stone contrasted this situation
with that of the medieval traveler
who was forced to communicate
with many people.
Increasing specialization has re
sulted in a "limited group of
knowers, so that scholarly spe
cialists arc steadily coming to
learn more and more about less
and less." Such inadequate com
mon backgrounds of knowledge
tend to lead to either "silence or
senseless babble."
AS EXAMPLES of advances
which have been damaging to hu
man communication. Stone named
the short wave radio and t he
"spread of bare literacy." Th e
short-wave radio, because of its
ability to penetrate national bar
tiers, has actually resulted in re
duced communication because na
tions have erected barriers to pre
vent the infiltration of propa
ganda. Thus a populace tends to
establish a "national version of
truth and justice."
The increased spread of "bare
literacy" has also been detrimen
tal to communication because the
advantageous effects have been
more than neutralized by "th o
chaotic mass of propaganda."
Stone added that the result has
been increased insulation, "reduc
ing the opportunities to compare
the values of one's own society
with those of other societies."
Stone stressed that it is man's
dut\ t<> he alert t<> this danger and
to attempt to remedy it. He con
cluded with the words of the old
sage who stated that "It is not
for thee to finish the task, but
neither art thou free to desist
from it."
