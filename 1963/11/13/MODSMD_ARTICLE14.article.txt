World University Service (WIS) is perhaps somewhat diffi
cult for us to understand. American students are not in the
habit of identifying with each other as a group, and are even
less likely to feel strong bonds with student communities
throughout the world. This has placed us in a paradoxical
situation, however, as American students are the wealthiest
body of students in the world, most able to help their counter
parts, and are accorded high international prestige when they
speak out and act on international student concerns through
such organizations as the National Student Association (NSA).
Those who were disturbed by the conditions in Mississippi
should find the same sensitive nerves chafed upon consider
ing the high incidence of tuberculosis among the Japanese
students brought about by the lack of funds and proper lodg
ing, the poverty of the student in Hong Kong, the need tor
student co-op bookstores and centers in places ranging from
Basutoland to Peru. Last summer 24 Stanford students par
ticipated in a work-project in Hong Kong, and another project
is being planned for this summer; Stern's Latin America House
is concerning itself with a Peruvian student center.
World University Service is unique in its scope and con
centration of concern. It represents a clear opportunity for
us to exercise meaningful membership in the international
student community, a community of which we are scarcely
aware, that looks to us for leadership.
