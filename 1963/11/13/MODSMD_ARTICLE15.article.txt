FIRST MISSISSIPPI
RETURNEE
Editor, The Daily:
The experience of canvassing
voters in the Negro section of
Greenville, Mississippi, during the
Aaron Henry for Governor Cam
paign has left many vivid impres
sions on my mind. This town of
70,000 people is located in Wash
ington County and is one of the
most liberal places in the state.
The police did not interfere with
the campaign.
Slightly more than half of the
people here are Negroes, who live
in marked poverty. In the Negro
commercial district, the stores
and restaurants are dark and
dirty. The old wooden buildings
seem invariably to be covered
with more faded advertisements
than paint. Yet some of these
stores can stand as monuments
of prosperity alongside the homes
of those who live nearby.
When I first went out to can
vass some of these homes, I
walked for many blocks, trying
to summon the courage to begin.
The words of those who had
warned me at Stanford that I
wouldn't be able to help kept
turnning through my mind, but
finally I began.
At first I was too nervous to
talk very much to these people,
but their willingness to listen
and their lack of animosity gave
me sufficient confidence to care
fully explain the campaign. I en
countered apathy, ignorance and
illiteracy, and some fear of per
sonal involvement—but never x*e
sentment. The Negro reactions
to the campaign varied greatly:
A man in his early fourties, re
siding in a reasonably nice home,
permitted me to talk for several
minutes before finally admitting
he was from the NAACP.
A drunk woman in one of the
many dark dimly lit boarding
houses where whole families live
in a single room, promised faith
fully — if unconvincingly — that
she would vote in the election.
An elderly woman listened to
my explanation of the campaign
and then eagerly took copies of
my leaflets to some of her neigh
bors.
A white man who owned a run
down Negro store stubbornly re
fused to allow a poster in his
window; he gave the excuse of
being "scared."
A young man who lived in a
very small, but decent apartment
told me that he had already been
able to vote down at the drug
store, and then he thanked me for
coming down from Yale to help
in the campaign.
I quickly discovered that there
wasn't any "normal" reaction,
that these people can no more be
stereotyped than Stanford stu
dents can. And as I returned to
SNCC headquarters at nightfall,
I finally knew that my decision
to go to Mississippi would never
be regretted.

Editor, The Daily:
Get out white man. Get out
Northie. Get out agitator, you
don't know what you are doing.
You are not a Mississippian, black
or white. You have not grown up
with the situation, the race situa
tion, and as a result cannot pos
sibly understand it, cannot have
the qualifications of a leader in
changing the situation. The issue
in the South is freedom, that is
what it is and that is all it is,
and freedom is not a political
issue. No law, of itself, has ever
made any man any freer. Free
dom depends, first of all, on the
Individual himself, and second, on
those around him. If anything,
freedom is a moral issue, and
morality imposed from without
is never the answer. Changing
the situation of the Negro in Mis

sissippi by giving him the vote
is not going to make him any
freer. What he needs much more
than the vote is respect — self
respect first and then the respect
of those around him, white and
Negro, and not respect only but
also love in the sense of human
love. Pie is not getting our re
spect and he is certainly not
getting our love when we go to
him any try to force him to be
free.
First we must free ourselves.
Then we will know better.

ALL NORTHERNERS NOBLE?
Editor, The Daily:
As a descendant of Northern
and Southern families, and as a
student of American History for
four years at Stanford and fif
teen years thereafter, I wish to
dispute the fuzzy thinking of Mr.
Robert D. Pepper (Ph.D., Stan
ford English Dept.. 1963) in his
letter of November 6th. I am
surprised and dismayed that a
man of his education has so little
common sense.
It is a temptation to say: Hail,
Noble Northerners! You, some of
whose ancestors brought the Ne
groes to this country in the abom
inable slave ships; followed "War
is Hell" Sherman as he cut a 60-
mile wide swath through Georgia
from Atlanta to the sea; put the
uneducated ex-slaves in southern
legislatures and gloted over the
results; gave the slaves their
freedom and then welcomed them
to the ghettos of New York, Chi
cago, Providence, Hartford, and
every other northern city.
Mr. Pepper, I do not doubt your
sincerity, but object to your gen
eralization that ALL Southern
white men are unspeakable ty
rants and ALL Northern white
men avenging angels. Thomas
Jefferson, Robert E. Lee and
Stonewall Jackson, as well as
many other Southerners, freed
their slaves and deplored every
vestige of slavery. It is not the
descendants of these men whom
you should castigate; rather, it
is those of the Northern carpet
baggers and Southern white
trash who continue to degrade
all that is decent in Southern so
ciety and who use Negroes as
political pawns.
Not one of us whites, Northern,
Southern or Western, is innocent.
Let us join hands with under
standing and without recrimina
tion and clean up this mess for
which all of us are responsible.
"Let him who is without sin
amongst us, cast the first stone."
Now, may I be a little facetious
and say: Hail, Stars and Bars of
the Kappa Alphas and Stars and
Stripes of the Phi Sigma Kap
pas!
Mr. Pepper, your spirit may be
willing but your reasoning is
weak.

Last week the Daily identified
several men apprehended for
water-bomb damage to Roble as
residents of Stern Hall. It would
seem no more than equitable to
identify the hi-fi burglar who was
captured Saturday night by the
men of Serra House as a fratern

HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT?
Editor, The Daily:
It is interesting to postulate I
how much government interven- j
tion would be tolerated by Mr. j
Hawley. I would hope that an ;
arrangement could be worked out 1
whereby the substance of what he ■
says could be submitted to the!
Pure Food and Drug Administra- [

freedom is a moral issue, and

the situation of the Negro in Mis

respect first and then the respect
of those around him, white and
Negro, and not respect only but
also love in the sense of human

ALL NORTHERNERS NOBLE?
Editor, The Daily:
As a descendant of Northern
and Southern families, and as a
student of American History for
four years at Stanford and fif
teen years thereafter, I wish to
dispute the fuzzy thinking of Mr.
Robert D. Pepper (Ph.D., Stan
ford English Dept.. 1963) in his
letter of November 6th. I am
surprised and dismayed that a
man of his education has so little
common sense.
It is a temptation to say: Hail,
Noble Northerners! You, some of
whose ancestors brought the Ne
groes to this country in the abom
inable slave ships; followed "War
is Hell" Sherman as he cut a 60-
mile wide swath through Georgia
from Atlanta to the sea; put the
uneducated ex-slaves in southern
legislatures and gloted over the
results; gave the slaves their
freedom and then welcomed them
to the ghettos of New York, Chi
cago, Providence, Hartford, and
every other northern city.
Mr. Pepper, I do not doubt your
sincerity, but object to your gen
eralization that ALL Southern
white men are unspeakable ty
rants and ALL Northern white
men avenging angels. Thomas
Jefferson, Robert E. Lee and
Stonewall Jackson, as well as
many other Southerners, freed
their slaves and deplored every
vestige of slavery. It is not the
descendants of these men whom
you should castigate; rather, it
is those of the Northern carpet
baggers and Southern white
trash who continue to degrade
all that is decent in Southern so
ciety and who use Negroes as
political pawns.
Not one of us whites, Northern,
Southern or Western, is innocent.
Let us join hands with under
standing and without recrimina
tion and clean up this mess for
which all of us are responsible.
"Let him who is without sin
amongst us, cast the first stone."
Now, may I be a little facetious
and say: Hail, Stars and Bars of
the Kappa Alphas and Stars and
Stripes of the Phi Sigma Kap
pas!
Mr. Pepper, your spirit may be
willing but your reasoning is
weak.

FIRST MISSISSIPPI
RETURNEE
Editor, The Daily:
The experience of canvassing
voters in the Negro section of
Greenville, Mississippi, during the
Aaron Henry for Governor Cam
paign has left many vivid impres
sions on my mind. This town of
70,000 people is located in Wash
ington County and is one of the
most liberal places in the state.
The police did not interfere with
the campaign.
Slightly more than half of the
people here are Negroes, who live
in marked poverty. In the Negro
commercial district, the stores
and restaurants are dark and
dirty. The old wooden buildings
seem invariably to be covered
with more faded advertisements
than paint. Yet some of these
stores can stand as monuments
of prosperity alongside the homes
of those who live nearby.
When I first went out to can
vass some of these homes, I
walked for many blocks, trying
to summon the courage to begin.
The words of those who had
warned me at Stanford that I
wouldn't be able to help kept
turnning through my mind, but
finally I began.
At first I was too nervous to
talk very much to these people,
but their willingness to listen
and their lack of animosity gave
me sufficient confidence to care
fully explain the campaign. I en
countered apathy, ignorance and
illiteracy, and some fear of per
sonal involvement—but never x*e
sentment. The Negro reactions
to the campaign varied greatly:
A man in his early fourties, re
siding in a reasonably nice home,
permitted me to talk for several
minutes before finally admitting
he was from the NAACP.
A drunk woman in one of the
many dark dimly lit boarding
houses where whole families live
in a single room, promised faith
fully — if unconvincingly — that
she would vote in the election.
An elderly woman listened to
my explanation of the campaign
and then eagerly took copies of
my leaflets to some of her neigh
bors.
A white man who owned a run
down Negro store stubbornly re
fused to allow a poster in his
window; he gave the excuse of
being "scared."
A young man who lived in a
very small, but decent apartment
told me that he had already been
able to vote down at the drug
store, and then he thanked me for
coming down from Yale to help
in the campaign.
I quickly discovered that there
wasn't any "normal" reaction,
that these people can no more be
stereotyped than Stanford stu
dents can. And as I returned to
SNCC headquarters at nightfall,
I finally knew that my decision
to go to Mississippi would never
be regretted.

FIRST MISSISSIPPI
RETURNEE
Editor, The Daily:
The experience of canvassing
voters in the Negro section of
Greenville, Mississippi, during the
Aaron Henry for Governor Cam
paign has left many vivid impres
sions on my mind. This town of
70,000 people is located in Wash
ington County and is one of the
most liberal places in the state.
The police did not interfere with
the campaign.
Slightly more than half of the
people here are Negroes, who live
in marked poverty. In the Negro
commercial district, the stores
and restaurants are dark and
dirty. The old wooden buildings
seem invariably to be covered
with more faded advertisements
than paint. Yet some of these
stores can stand as monuments
of prosperity alongside the homes
of those who live nearby.
When I first went out to can
vass some of these homes, I
walked for many blocks, trying
to summon the courage to begin.
The words of those who had
warned me at Stanford that I
wouldn't be able to help kept
turnning through my mind, but
finally I began.
At first I was too nervous to
talk very much to these people,
but their willingness to listen
and their lack of animosity gave
me sufficient confidence to care
fully explain the campaign. I en
countered apathy, ignorance and
illiteracy, and some fear of per
sonal involvement—but never x*e
sentment. The Negro reactions
to the campaign varied greatly:
A man in his early fourties, re
siding in a reasonably nice home,
permitted me to talk for several
minutes before finally admitting
he was from the NAACP.
A drunk woman in one of the
many dark dimly lit boarding
houses where whole families live
in a single room, promised faith
fully — if unconvincingly — that
she would vote in the election.
An elderly woman listened to
my explanation of the campaign
and then eagerly took copies of
my leaflets to some of her neigh
bors.
A white man who owned a run
down Negro store stubbornly re
fused to allow a poster in his
window; he gave the excuse of
being "scared."
A young man who lived in a
very small, but decent apartment
told me that he had already been
able to vote down at the drug
store, and then he thanked me for
coming down from Yale to help
in the campaign.
I quickly discovered that there
wasn't any "normal" reaction,
that these people can no more be
stereotyped than Stanford stu
dents can. And as I returned to
SNCC headquarters at nightfall,
I finally knew that my decision
to go to Mississippi would never
be regretted.

Get out white man. Get out
Northie. Get out agitator, you
don't know what you are doing.
You are not a Mississippian, black
or white. You have not grown up
with the situation, the race situa
tion, and as a result cannot pos
sibly understand it, cannot have
the qualifications of a leader in
changing the situation. The issue
in the South is freedom, that is
what it is and that is all it is,
and freedom is not a political
issue. No law, of itself, has ever
made any man any freer. Free
dom depends, first of all, on the
Individual himself, and second, on
those around him. If anything,
freedom is a moral issue, and
morality imposed from without
is never the answer. Changing
the situation of the Negro in Mis

sissippi by giving him the vote
is not going to make him any
freer. What he needs much more
than the vote is respect — self
respect first and then the respect
of those around him, white and
Negro, and not respect only but
also love in the sense of human
love. Pie is not getting our re

ALL NORTHERNERS NOBLE?
Editor, The Daily:
As a descendant of Northern
and Southern families, and as a
student of American History for
four years at Stanford and fif
teen years thereafter, I wish to
dispute the fuzzy thinking of Mr.
Robert D. Pepper (Ph.D., Stan
ford English Dept.. 1963) in his
letter of November 6th. I am
surprised and dismayed that a
man of his education has so little
common sense.
It is a temptation to say: Hail,
Noble Northerners! You, some of
whose ancestors brought the Ne
groes to this country in the abom
inable slave ships; followed "War
is Hell" Sherman as he cut a 60-
mile wide swath through Georgia
from Atlanta to the sea; put the
uneducated ex-slaves in southern
legislatures and gloted over the
results; gave the slaves their
freedom and then welcomed them
to the ghettos of New York, Chi
cago, Providence, Hartford, and
every other northern city.
Mr. Pepper, I do not doubt your
sincerity, but object to your gen
eralization that ALL Southern
white men are unspeakable ty
rants and ALL Northern white
men avenging angels. Thomas
Jefferson, Robert E. Lee and
Stonewall Jackson, as well as
many other Southerners, freed
their slaves and deplored every
vestige of slavery. It is not the
descendants of these men whom
you should castigate; rather, it
is those of the Northern carpet
baggers and Southern white
trash who continue to degrade
all that is decent in Southern so
ciety and who use Negroes as
political pawns.
Not one of us whites, Northern,
Southern or Western, is innocent.
Let us join hands with under
standing and without recrimina
tion and clean up this mess for
which all of us are responsible.
"Let him who is without sin
amongst us, cast the first stone."
Now, may I be a little facetious
and say: Hail, Stars and Bars of
the Kappa Alphas and Stars and
Stripes of the Phi Sigma Kap
pas!
Mr. Pepper, your spirit may be
willing but your reasoning is
weak.

changing the situation. The issue
in the South is freedom, that is
what it is and that is all it is,
and freedom is not a political
issue. No law, of itself, has ever
made any man any freer. Free
dom depends, first of all, on the
Individual himself, and second, on
those around him. If anything,
freedom is a moral issue, and
morality imposed from without
is never the answer. Changing
the situation of the Negro in Mis

sissippi by giving him the vote
is not going to make him any
freer. What he needs much more
than the vote is respect — self
respect first and then the respect
of those around him, white and
Negro, and not respect only but
also love in the sense of human
love. Pie is not getting our re
spect and he is certainly not
getting our love when we go to
him any try to force him to be

First we must free ourselves.

ALL NORTHERNERS NOBLE?
Editor, The Daily:
As a descendant of Northern
and Southern families, and as a
student of American History for
four years at Stanford and fif
teen years thereafter, I wish to
dispute the fuzzy thinking of Mr.
Robert D. Pepper (Ph.D., Stan
ford English Dept.. 1963) in his
letter of November 6th. I am
surprised and dismayed that a
man of his education has so little
common sense.
It is a temptation to say: Hail,
Noble Northerners! You, some of
whose ancestors brought the Ne
groes to this country in the abom
inable slave ships; followed "War
is Hell" Sherman as he cut a 60-
mile wide swath through Georgia
from Atlanta to the sea; put the
uneducated ex-slaves in southern
legislatures and gloted over the
results; gave the slaves their
freedom and then welcomed them
to the ghettos of New York, Chi
cago, Providence, Hartford, and
every other northern city.
Mr. Pepper, I do not doubt your
sincerity, but object to your gen
eralization that ALL Southern
white men are unspeakable ty
rants and ALL Northern white
men avenging angels. Thomas
Jefferson, Robert E. Lee and
Stonewall Jackson, as well as
many other Southerners, freed
their slaves and deplored every
vestige of slavery. It is not the
descendants of these men whom
you should castigate; rather, it
is those of the Northern carpet
baggers and Southern white
trash who continue to degrade
all that is decent in Southern so
ciety and who use Negroes as
political pawns.
Not one of us whites, Northern,
Southern or Western, is innocent.
Let us join hands with under
standing and without recrimina
tion and clean up this mess for
which all of us are responsible.
"Let him who is without sin
amongst us, cast the first stone."
Now, may I be a little facetious
and say: Hail, Stars and Bars of
the Kappa Alphas and Stars and
Stripes of the Phi Sigma Kap
pas!
Mr. Pepper, your spirit may be
willing but your reasoning is
weak.

FIRST MISSISSIPPI
RETURNEE
Editor, The Daily:
The experience of canvassing
voters in the Negro section of
Greenville, Mississippi, during the
Aaron Henry for Governor Cam
paign has left many vivid impres
sions on my mind. This town of
70,000 people is located in Wash
ington County and is one of the
most liberal places in the state.
The police did not interfere with
the campaign.
Slightly more than half of the
people here are Negroes, who live
in marked poverty. In the Negro
commercial district, the stores
and restaurants are dark and
dirty. The old wooden buildings
seem invariably to be covered
with more faded advertisements
than paint. Yet some of these
stores can stand as monuments
of prosperity alongside the homes
of those who live nearby.
When I first went out to can
vass some of these homes, I
walked for many blocks, trying
to summon the courage to begin.
The words of those who had
warned me at Stanford that I
wouldn't be able to help kept
turnning through my mind, but
finally I began.
At first I was too nervous to
talk very much to these people,
but their willingness to listen
and their lack of animosity gave
me sufficient confidence to care
fully explain the campaign. I en
countered apathy, ignorance and
illiteracy, and some fear of per
sonal involvement—but never x*e
sentment. The Negro reactions
to the campaign varied greatly:
A man in his early fourties, re
siding in a reasonably nice home,
permitted me to talk for several
minutes before finally admitting
he was from the NAACP.
A drunk woman in one of the
many dark dimly lit boarding
houses where whole families live
in a single room, promised faith
fully — if unconvincingly — that
she would vote in the election.
An elderly woman listened to
my explanation of the campaign
and then eagerly took copies of
my leaflets to some of her neigh
bors.
A white man who owned a run
down Negro store stubbornly re
fused to allow a poster in his
window; he gave the excuse of
being "scared."
A young man who lived in a
very small, but decent apartment
told me that he had already been
able to vote down at the drug
store, and then he thanked me for
coming down from Yale to help
in the campaign.
I quickly discovered that there
wasn't any "normal" reaction,
that these people can no more be
stereotyped than Stanford stu
dents can. And as I returned to
SNCC headquarters at nightfall,
I finally knew that my decision
to go to Mississippi would never
be regretted.
