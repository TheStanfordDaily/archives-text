lUS (Rabat. Moro c c o and
Prague) — A climate of tenor
ism reigns in Morocco and one of
its principle targets is the Moroc
can student movement, according
to reports reaching the Interna
-1 tional Union of Students from Ra
| bat.
Ham id Berrada. president of the
| National Union of Moroccan Stu-
I dents tUNEM), is one of the vic
i tims. Arrested on August 28th
j for offending the Moroccan mon
i archy, he has not yet been brought
I to trial and his whereabouts are
still unknown.
(The September 25 Daily arti
cle from the Collegiate Press
Service reported that thive men
j walked into the UNEM offices
j August 28, asked to see Berrada
i and claiming to be friends of his.
| When Barrada appeared, they
identified themselves as police
| men and took him away.)
UNEM headquarters were ran
: sacked by the police who had
j been stationed outside the offices,
demanding identity papers of all
! students who wished 1o enter.
(The arrest according to the
Daily article, came twenty-four
hours after a press conference of
the Confederation of Algerian.
Tunisian, and Moroccan National
Unions of Students (Maghreb).
Berrada was at the conference
representing UNEM.
A statement read at the confer
ence had condemned recent re
pression against the opposition
party, the National Union of
Popular Forces, and the illegal
imprisonment and torture of hun
dreds of persons.
The group had also staled that
the present monarchic regime is
"the last remaining obstacle to
the unification of the Maghreb.")
The statement said: "By taking
the same path of violence as
French colonialism and by using
the same methods, such as mass
arrests, kidnappings, torture and
murder, the monarchy in Moroc
co should be denounced and com
bat ted. not only by Ihe people of
Maghreb, but also by all demo
crats throughout the world."
Three days later, an official
new s broadcast in Rabat an
nounced that Hamid Berrada had
been arrested and handed over to
the court, as a result of a recent
declaration which, t the conf. state
ment », according to the Moroc
can Ministry of Information, had
been "injurious and offensive to
the monarchy."
ON AUGUST 28TH, the Moroc
can daily. "Maroe Informations,"
quoting usually well-informed cir
cles, reported that the UNEM
president had been transferred to
a psychiatric center for examina
tion.
In view of the torture which
political prisoners have been un
dergoing in Morocco, the Maghreb
student confederation expresses
grave misgivings about the na
ture of such a "psychiatric ex
amination."

The Moroccan courts disclaim
any knowledge of Ben-aria's
whereabouts. lie had earlier been
abducted on the night of August
H, following a press conference
at the end of another Confedera
tion meeting and kept blind-folded
for three days while being inter
rogated by the security police. No
arrest warrant was issued and he
was subsequently released.
(The Daily article reported that
there are conflicting statements
as to Berrada's whereabouts. The
Moroccan Ministry of Information
confirmed his arrest on the 28th.
A few days later, the Crown At
torney and the Ministry of Justice
said that a mandate had been
issued for his arrest, but that he
had not yet been caught.
Informed observers feel he is
probably in the hands of the Spe
cial Brigade being submitted to
interrogation and torture.)
The official broadcast has
stressed that the arrest of the
UNEM leader "did not constitute
a stand . . . against a student or
ganization."
The Confederation has assumed
full responsibility for all that was
said at the press conference in Ra
bat when this General Statement
was made public: "we know . . .
that Ihe monarchy in Morocco in
cessantly derides elementary lib
erties and human rights. We
know that thousands of patriots
are arbitrarily confined in known
or secret police jails. We know
that hundreds of fighters have
been tortured and that several of
them have found death or gone
mad . . . The truth is that the re
gime in Morocco, which has as
sumed the form of a police dic
tatorship, is no longer in a posi
tion to tolerate any freedom."
THE PRESENT terrorism in
Morocco began with the rigged
referendum of December 7
19G2, when the monarchy realized
that only brute force could keep
it in power. The police cracked
down on all democratic elements
within the country, arresting over
100 leaders of UNFP (National
Union of Popular Forces) on July
16 this year.
Since this mass roundup of its
opponents, the monarchist police
have arrested and abducted many
progressives, including many stu
dents. Torture methods, perfected
by the French "Special Services"
during the Algerian War, were
used against these prisoners who
are denied the right to communi
cate with their family or with
lawyers.
THE IUS SECRETARIAT has
issued a statement demanding
the release of the UNEM official
and of scores of other Moroccan
students who are in jail. It has
also agred 1o send a fact-finding
commission at UNEM's invitation
for an on-the-spot study of the
problems which the Moroccan
student movement faces today.
In inviting lUS observers to
Morocco, UNEM has promised to
turn over the files of cases of stu
dents who have been persecuted
since the July coup de force.
The International Union of Stu
dents has reiterated its solidarity
with UNEM and the students of
Morocco; "the cause of the Moroc
can students is your cause—for
democracy, justice and national
independence. Demand the re
lease of Berrada . . . of all im
prisoned democrats! . . . End per
secution in Morocco!"
