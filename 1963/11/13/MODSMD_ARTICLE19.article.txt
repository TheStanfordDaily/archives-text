# 'WORLD'S TOP TRACK'
## Field Readies for Lag Race 
### JUSTIN BECK Sports Editor 
With the first annual Lagunita
Seca race, if) lie held Saturday
following the Washington State
game, only four days away, t h e
field looks like the strongest col
lection of cars and drivers ever
to assemble on the bed of Lake
Lagunita.
According to Zela Psi, the race
sponsors, I he coveted keg of beer
awarded to the winner by Dean
Winbigler, could go to any of the
cars entered in this. Stanford's
biggest auto race of the year.
THE SITE of this year's race
is America's newest track, built
only last week on the bottom of
Lake Lagunita near the Zete
house. It is reputed to be th e
world's toughest half mile course.
Due to certain fears of insur
ance companies on the matter of
road racing, only one car will be
allowed on the track at a time,
the beer going to the car with
the fastest lap time.
ORHiINAEEY it was planned
to have a limit of fifteen entries,
but because of the great interest
in the race, the Zete's have de
cided to have each car run three
practice laps in the morning, two
for practice, one for time, with
i tic fifteen fastest qualifying for
the finals in the afternoon after
the football game.
The race promises to be one of
the tightest of Ihe 1903 racing sea
son with a number of hot Ameri
can stocks entered, ranging from
a 1939 Cadillac to several cars as
current as the 1953 models.
The American supremacy is be
ing threatened in this race for
the first time, as a '60 Saab is be-

ing entered by Jeff Grynwald.
However, experts on the campus
tend to regard the foreign ma
chinery as too unreliable for the
bruising Lagunita course, pre
ferring the solid and proven
American cars.
AMONG Til I'. early entries is
the Doke's hot '51 Studebaker,
driven by Chuck Patton. The car's
potential is still a mystery at this
time, due to a dead battery, but
once they get the car started, it
should prove to be one of the
cars to beat.
Other entries include a '53 Chev
driven by El Campn's Pete Van
Zant. A spokesman for the El
C'ampo racing team said that they
are considering another entry,
provided they can run the car in
reverse. "It doesn't have a first
gear, but reverse is in good
shape." was the official explana
tion of the plan.
OTHER ENTRIES include the
SAE Special, a '51 Olds driven by
Craig Laudon. is reported to be a
formidable challenge by the SAE's
provided they can get an engine
in it before race time. Also highly
regarded by racing authorities
are a pair of Packards, a '50 driv
en by Dexter Chapin, unofficially
sponsored by 'Francos, and a '53
entered and driven by John Ma
nouses.

ing entered by Jeff Grynwald.
However, experts on the campus
tend to regard the foreign ma
chinery as too unreliable for the
bruising Lagunita course, pre
ferring the solid and proven
American cars.
AMONG Til I'. early entries is
the Doke's hot '51 Studebaker,
driven by Chuck Patton. The car's
potential is still a mystery at this
time, due to a dead battery, but
once they get the car started, it
should prove to be one of the
cars to beat.
Other entries include a '53 Chev
driven by El Campn's Pete Van
Zant. A spokesman for the El
C'ampo racing team said that they
are considering another entry,
provided they can run the car in
reverse. "It doesn't have a first
gear, but reverse is in good
shape." was the official explana
tion of the plan.
OTHER ENTRIES include the
SAE Special, a '51 Olds driven by
Craig Laudon. is reported to be a
formidable challenge by the SAE's
provided they can get an engine
in it before race time. Also highly
regarded by racing authorities
are a pair of Packards, a '50 driv

sponsored by 'Francos, and a '53
entered and driven by John Ma

With the first annual Lagunita
Seca race, if) lie held Saturday
following the Washington State
game, only four days away, t h e
field looks like the strongest col

sponsors, I he coveted keg of beer
awarded to the winner by Dean
Winbigler, could go to any of the
cars entered in this. Stanford's
biggest auto race of the year.
THE SITE of this year's race
is America's newest track, built
only last week on the bottom of
Lake Lagunita near the Zete
house. It is reputed to be th e
world's toughest half mile course.
Due to certain fears of insur
ance companies on the matter of
road racing, only one car will be
allowed on the track at a time,
the beer going to the car with
the fastest lap time.
ORHiINAEEY it was planned
to have a limit of fifteen entries,
but because of the great interest
in the race, the Zete's have de
cided to have each car run three
practice laps in the morning, two
for practice, one for time, with
i tic fifteen fastest qualifying for
the finals in the afternoon after
the football game.
The race promises to be one of
the tightest of Ihe 1903 racing sea
son with a number of hot Ameri
can stocks entered, ranging from
a 1939 Cadillac to several cars as
current as the 1953 models.
