# 'Red Hot Prof Contest Opens; Funds Raised Will Aid WUS
## Dean Clark Raps Lead After Early Balloting 
### MIKE ROSTER 
Leading with a total of over
2,300 votes in the Red Hot Prof,
contest yesterday was Dwight
Clark, Dean of Freshmen Men.
These are only early returns,
however. Election headquarters
at Engineering Corner will be
open again all day today and to
morrow.
To nominate a Red Hot Prof,
requires an initial contribution of
25 cents. Additional votes are a
penny apiece. "Minus" votes, a
feature introduced this year, are
three cents each.
THE RED HOT PROF, contest
is sponsored by the fund drive of
World University Service (WUS),
an international student relief or
ganization. Contributions, re
ceiver! from students and faculty
members in universities around
the world, are used to aid numer
ous university projects in emerg
ing nations.
Among WUS projects are the
establishment of libraries and
bookstores, equipping of student
health centers, construction of
dormitories, and similar work.
Funds are chanelled to Asia, Afri

ca. Latin America, and areas in
Europe. About $350,000 is donated
annually in scholarships to Hun
garian, Chinese, and African stu
dents studying in the United
States.
Close to Dean Clark's 2,319
votes last night was Professor
Herbert D. Merritt, professor of
English Philology, with 2,076
votes. Next came Donald Hilton,
Director of the Institute of His
panic-American Studies, with I,*
107 votes. Hilton had received
500 votes from one student, giv
ing him a substantial boost.
JOHN MOORE, Assistant Dean
of Men and director of the Stern
Houses, is presently at the bot
tom of the pile with a deficit of
43 votes. His campaign managers
are undismayed, however, an d
plan to fight on vigorously.
Past elections have shown that
last minute spurts are common
place. Professor Donald St dwell,
supported by a Med School-Wil
bur Hall coalition, gained 38,000
votes within the last half hour of
polling last year. He won with
total contributions of 5163.64.
Trying to maintain Dean Clark's
lead, the freshmen men have or
ganized a committee to boost Wil
bur spirit and Wilbur contribu
tions. Similar groups are often
formed by the Med School, Law
School, and other graduate divi
sions. Last year's precedent of
forming coalitions between major
voting forces may prove an im
portant factor again this year.
CONTRIBUTIONS c ollecte d
this year from all WUS organiza
tions will be spent in a variety of
ways. In the 1963-64 program,
cooperative cafeterias will be
established in India and Nepal,
book banks will be formed in In
donesia, and health services will
be sent to Pakistan, Hong Kong,
Korea, and Thailand.
In Africa, assistance will be
given to universities in Rhodesia,
Tanganyika, Uganda. South Afri
ca. Angola, Basutoland, and Ni
geria. University facilities in Al
geria will be reconstructed. Other
projects are slated for Chile, Peru.
Greece, Yugoslavia, and other
countries.
WUS' history goes back to its
origin in 1919. It provided relief
for students following World War
I, aided Chinese student refugees
in 1937. placed 1.000 Hungarian
students on scholarships follow
ing the revolution in 1956, among
other accomplishments.
"It's a dastardly plot by un
principled freshmen," said Clark
winningly. His closest rival, Pro
fessor Merritt, added for his part
that "it's all a mystery to me."
Of WUS, President Kennedy
has said, '"In its many services to
education, World University Serv
ice is making a genuine contribu
tion lo the growth of freedom."


A REFUGEE STUDENT I eaves his Hong Kong hut. These homes are
typical of the crowded condition which is a factor in the city s TB
problem (in 1957, one out of eight students had TB). World Univer
sity Service, which will be aided by the Red Hot Prof contest, builds
clinics and hospitals to alleviate this problem. The Red Hot Prof con
test continues until Friday.
