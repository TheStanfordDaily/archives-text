College student socialist groups
are an active influence in Ameri
can socialism, according to Nor
man Thomas, current guest-in
residence at Stern Hall. "They
tend towards the left in relation
to the American Socialist Party,
but they recover; voting people
rai-ely stay as radical as they
start out," he said.
The Young People's Socialist
League is a particularly dynamic
student political group. "Nothing
about socialism is very strong in
the United States, hut the YPSL's
are doing well." They've given a
lot of help to the Civil Rights
movement, Thomas remarked.
THOMAS HIMSELF recently
completed a visit to the South
which he made at the invitation
of the Freedom Party. He said,
"I think that they wanted some
thing to happen to me so that
there would be some publicity;
but nothing did. I must have been
a disappointment to them." Again,
he expressed the deep gratitude
of the people in the South work
ing on Civil Rights for the help
of the Stanford students in financ
ing the Mock Vote in Mississippi.
Thomas, who is almost 80 years
old. is active on many commit
tes, including the Post War World
Council, and SANE; nevertheless,
he spends a large part of his time
speaking at colleges and other
groups.
ALTHOUGH PARTS of the old
socialist platform have been
adopted. Thomas would like to
see a "speedup in democratic so
cialism," involving an expansion
of the State, to accommodate the
needs of the changing country.
One must not go back to the past
too much, he said. In the present
Democratic and Republican par
lies. he would like to see a "rea
listic realignment in their ap
proach to issues."

There will be seminars in Stern
Hall until Thomas leaves tomor
row. In general, they will consist
of a statement given by Thomas
followed by questions and discus
sion. He says that he hopes the
seminars will become increasingly
controversial.

to the American Socialist Party,
but they recover; voting people
rai-ely stay as radical as they
start out," he said.
The Young People's Socialist
League is a particularly dynamic
student political group. "Nothing
about socialism is very strong in
the United States, hut the YPSL's
are doing well." They've given a
lot of help to the Civil Rights
movement, Thomas remarked.
THOMAS HIMSELF recently
completed a visit to the South
which he made at the invitation
of the Freedom Party. He said,
"I think that they wanted some
thing to happen to me so that
there would be some publicity;
but nothing did. I must have been
a disappointment to them." Again,
he expressed the deep gratitude
of the people in the South work
ing on Civil Rights for the help
of the Stanford students in financ
ing the Mock Vote in Mississippi.
Thomas, who is almost 80 years
old. is active on many commit
tes, including the Post War World
Council, and SANE; nevertheless,
he spends a large part of his time
speaking at colleges and other
groups.
ALTHOUGH PARTS of the old
socialist platform have been
adopted. Thomas would like to
see a "speedup in democratic so
cialism," involving an expansion
of the State, to accommodate the
needs of the changing country.
One must not go back to the past
too much, he said. In the present
Democratic and Republican par
lies. he would like to see a "rea
listic realignment in their ap
proach to issues."

There will be seminars in Stern
Hall until Thomas leaves tomor
row. In general, they will consist
of a statement given by Thomas
followed by questions and discus
sion. He says that he hopes the
seminars will become increasingly
controversial.
