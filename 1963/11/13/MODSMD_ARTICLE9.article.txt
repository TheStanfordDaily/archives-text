# Russian Teachers Becoming Scarce
## 
### 
Low salaries and highly unsat- i
isfactory working conditions are |
discouraging Soviet youths from
entering the teaching profession, I
according to recent articles in the s
Russian press.
As a result, Soviet authorities
are having difficulty finding I
enough good teachers to staff sec
ondary schools.
Teachers in the rural areas are j
frequently under the complete j
power of local district govern
moni officials; the teachers' free j
time may be at the disposal of
the local officials, and during j
summer vacation, teachers some- j
times are forced to do menial
farm work rather than being al
lowed to improve their teaching i
qualifications.
Conditions at teachers' col-l
leges also contribute to discour- 1
aging potential teachers. Scholar-1
ships are lower there than fori
other fields of study and living i
conditions are poor. The Moscow j
teachers' gazette reports that the
number of applicants to some;
teachers' colleges is far below the
number of vacancies.
Because many teachers' colleges ;
do not have competitive entrance -
examinations, a large proportion
of applicants are students who
failed to be admitted to other col
leges, "Isvestia" reports.
