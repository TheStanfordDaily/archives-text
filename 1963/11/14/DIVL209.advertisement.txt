The Univesrity Needs the Church
The primary purpose of the University is to seek after, and em
brace the Truth ... in all areas of life. Christian truth, therefore,
about God, and about man (and all of man's hopes and aspira
tions, his motives and his emotions, his rationality and his
skills, his nature and destiny) is essential and integral to the
whole vocation and work of the university! For man's truth
without God's Truth (about Himself, His people and His world)
can at best be only partialand inadequate truth, and at worst
only deluded and arrogant truth!
The Church Has a Vocation to the University
If we take the Incarnation seriously—that God came into our
human situation fully, and thereby met men where they are,
within their own circumstances and conditions—we are then
obliged to conclude that the "time and place'' of the Church's
life and work is at the very heart of the life of the university
... to bear to the university, in a meaningful and relevant
manner the truth about God revealed to us in His Son, Jesus
Christ, and the resulting truth about man (his life, work, econ
omy, society, etc.)
