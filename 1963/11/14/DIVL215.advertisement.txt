ONLY ONE WAY TO GOD
"Kilter l>y tilt' narrow irate. The gate is wide that leads to perdition, there is plenty
of room on the road, and many go that way; hut the gate that leads to life i> small
and the retail narrow, and those who find it are few." Matt. 7:13-14 XK.
"Jesus saith unto hint, I am the way, the truth and the life: no man coniet'i unto
the father, hut by me." I Tim. 2:5 KJ.
"Hellold. I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voiee and open the
door it any man hear my voiee and open the door, I will come in to hint and will
sup with hint and lie with me. To him that overcome will I grant to >it with me in
in\ throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne."
Rev. 3:20-21 KJ.
i Mere is the answer, for all of you and for all the people ot Israel: it was
hy the name of Jestis Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom (iod raised
from the dead . . . This Jesus is the stone rejected lin the builders which has
become the key-tone and you are the builders. There is no salvation in anyone
else at all. for there i- no other name under heaven granted to men. by which we
may receive salvation." Acts 4:10-12 Xl'..
"For there is one 'iod anil one mediator between (iod and men, Himself man, ( lirist
Jesus." I Tint. 2:5 Dnuay.
"Religions" are mail's attempts to reach God, to work out lii> own salvation, to find
peace with <i<><l l>v his own efforts. The words for "religion" in the llible are almost j
always used in a bad sense, and many Christians do not like to be called "religious"
because it often implies a self-righteous hypocrisy similar to that of the Pharisees, i
Christians realize that it is (iod who has come to them through Christ, entirely apart i
from their own efforts to earn Mis favor.
"For at the very time when we were still powerless, then ( lirist died for the wicked.
Even for a just man one of lis would hardly die, though perhaps for a good man
one might actually brave death; but Christ died for Us while we were yet sinners,
and that is God's own proof of his love toward us." Rom. s:<>-8.
"Time was when you were dead in your sins and wickedness, when you followed the
evil ways of this present age, w hen you obeyed the commander of the spiritual powers
of the air, the spirit now at work among God's rebel subjects. We too were of their
number: we lived all our li\i- in sensuality, and obeyed the promptings of our own
insticts and notions. In our natural condition, we like the rest, lay under the
dreadful judgment of (iod. Hut (iod. rich in mercy, for the great love he bore us,
brought us to life with Christ even when we were dead in our sins; For it is by
grace you are saved, through trusting him. it is not your own doing. It i- (iod's
gift, not a reward for work done. There is nothing for anyone to boast of. "Eph.
2:1-10 NE.
There is only one way an individual becomes a Christian: it is by receiving Jesus
Christ on a personal basis, and letting (.iod bring about the miracle of the new birth.
"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to hi- mercy he
saved Us, by the washing of regeneration, and renew ing of the Holy lihost." Titus 3-5.

the father, hut by me." I Tim. 2:5 KJ.
"Hellold. I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voiee and open the
door it any man hear my voiee and open the door, I will come in to hint and will

Rev. 3:20-21 KJ.
i Mere is the answer, for all of you and for all the people ot Israel: it was
hy the name of Jestis Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom (iod raised
from the dead . . . This Jesus is the stone rejected lin the builders which has
become the key-tone and you are the builders. There is no salvation in anyone
else at all. for there i- no other name under heaven granted to men. by which we
may receive salvation." Acts 4:10-12 Xl'..

from their own efforts to earn Mis favor.
"For at the very time when we were still powerless, then ( lirist died for the wicked.
Even for a just man one of lis would hardly die, though perhaps for a good man
one might actually brave death; but Christ died for Us while we were yet sinners,

"Time was when you were dead in your sins and wickedness, when you followed the
evil ways of this present age, w hen you obeyed the commander of the spiritual powers
of the air, the spirit now at work among God's rebel subjects. We too were of their

"Kilter l>y tilt' narrow irate. The gate is wide that leads to perdition, there is plenty
of room on the road, and many go that way; hut the gate that leads to life i> small
and the retail narrow, and those who find it are few." Matt. 7:13-14 XK.
"Jesus saith unto hint, I am the way, the truth and the life: no man coniet'i unto
the father, hut by me." I Tim. 2:5 KJ.
"Hellold. I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voiee and open the
door it any man hear my voiee and open the door, I will come in to hint and will
sup with hint and lie with me. To him that overcome will I grant to >it with me in
in\ throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne."
Rev. 3:20-21 KJ.
i Mere is the answer, for all of you and for all the people ot Israel: it was
hy the name of Jestis Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom (iod raised
from the dead . . . This Jesus is the stone rejected lin the builders which has
become the key-tone and you are the builders. There is no salvation in anyone
else at all. for there i- no other name under heaven granted to men. by which we
may receive salvation." Acts 4:10-12 Xl'..
"For there is one 'iod anil one mediator between (iod and men, Himself man, ( lirist
Jesus." I Tint. 2:5 Dnuay.
"Religions" are mail's attempts to reach God, to work out lii> own salvation, to find
peace with <i<><l l>v his own efforts. The words for "religion" in the llible are almost j
always used in a bad sense, and many Christians do not like to be called "religious"
because it often implies a self-righteous hypocrisy similar to that of the Pharisees, i
Christians realize that it is (iod who has come to them through Christ, entirely apart i
from their own efforts to earn Mis favor.
"For at the very time when we were still powerless, then ( lirist died for the wicked.
Even for a just man one of lis would hardly die, though perhaps for a good man
one might actually brave death; but Christ died for Us while we were yet sinners,
and that is God's own proof of his love toward us." Rom. s:<>-8.
