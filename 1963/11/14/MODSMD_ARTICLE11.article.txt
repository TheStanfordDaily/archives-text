## 
### 
A resolution on the American Legion's condemnation of the US
National Student Association will be presented at the Legislature
meeting tonight at 7:30 in Room 320.
The measure is being drafted by Rick Stearns, NSA regional
chairman for the California-Nevada-Hawaii region, and Tom Neel,

Stanford NSA co-ordintor. +
THE COLLEGIATE PRESS As
sociation reports the Legion's
resolution, drafted at its national
convention in September, stated
the Legion's opposition to the es
tablishment of any more chapters
of the NSA at tax-supported col
leges or universities.
THE STATEMENT said: "Such
chapters would leave the door
ajar for the dissemination of
Communist propaganda, which
is all the Communists desire."
The Legion, according to CPS,
felt that the Communists are
making a major propaganda push
among college students; that com
mittees, clubs, and organizations
are front for the Communist
campus effort; that NSA holds
a teacher should not be fired just
because of Communist Party

membership; and that students
should be allowed to hear Commu
nist speakers is an NSA policy.
Student leaders at the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley
were sharply critical yesterday of
the American Legion's condemna
tion of the National Students'
Association a $ a Communist in
filtrated organization.
Cal's campus coordinator for
the NSA, Jim Duerr, vigorously
defended the organization he rep
resents against the Legion's at
tacks. "NSA is not communist; it
just believes in certain principles
and in upholding academic free
dom. It is not a voice of any one
faction, but rather of all factions."
HE ADDED that NSA's ex
pressed opinions are those of var
ious selected student leaders, and
that the organization is not and
could not be the tool of any single
infiltrating group.
According to the same student,
the opinions expressed at this
year's NSA convention were ac
tually very conservative. "In
fact." he concluded, "it was one
of the most conservative conven
tions ever.
The remainder of the LASSU
agenda will be:
• consideration of an appropri
ation to the Daily to meet ex
penses beyond normal operational
costs. The measure was tabled
at the last meeting pending the
gathering further information on
the university's legal response to
j such an act.
• election of two legislature
members to a panel which will
select the two new members of
men's council. Other members of
the panel will be ASSU President
Bud Wedin and two members of
, the old men's council.
• consideration of the appro
priation of money to pay the ex
penses incurred by the Stanford
: representative to the National
Congress on Religion and Race,
to bo held this weekend in Wash
ington, D.C.

THE COLLEGIATE PRESS As
sociation reports the Legion's
resolution, drafted at its national
convention in September, stated
the Legion's opposition to the es
tablishment of any more chapters
of the NSA at tax-supported col
leges or universities.
THE STATEMENT said: "Such
chapters would leave the door
ajar for the dissemination of
Communist propaganda, which
is all the Communists desire."
The Legion, according to CPS,
felt that the Communists are
making a major propaganda push
among college students; that com
mittees, clubs, and organizations
are front for the Communist
campus effort; that NSA holds
a teacher should not be fired just
because of Communist Party

membership; and that students
should be allowed to hear Commu
nist speakers is an NSA policy.
Student leaders at the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley
were sharply critical yesterday of
the American Legion's condemna
tion of the National Students'
Association a $ a Communist in
filtrated organization.
Cal's campus coordinator for
the NSA, Jim Duerr, vigorously
defended the organization he rep
resents against the Legion's at
tacks. "NSA is not communist; it
just believes in certain principles
and in upholding academic free
dom. It is not a voice of any one
faction, but rather of all factions."
HE ADDED that NSA's ex
pressed opinions are those of var
ious selected student leaders, and
that the organization is not and
could not be the tool of any single
infiltrating group.
According to the same student,
the opinions expressed at this
year's NSA convention were ac
tually very conservative. "In
fact." he concluded, "it was one
of the most conservative conven
tions ever.
The remainder of the LASSU
agenda will be:
• consideration of an appropri
ation to the Daily to meet ex
penses beyond normal operational
costs. The measure was tabled
at the last meeting pending the
gathering further information on
the university's legal response to
j such an act.
• election of two legislature
members to a panel which will
select the two new members of
men's council. Other members of
the panel will be ASSU President
Bud Wedin and two members of
