PALO ALTO, October 13 â€” Stanford is one of those universities
which is right out of the pages of "Bill Buckley goes to college."
Rich, lovely with a superb faculty and relatively few (5,000) students,
it can afford to be as selective as it pleases, and also run ihe student
body as it pleases.
ON FIRST SIGHT, the student body strikes a visitor from Wis
consin as a) wealthy, >j) homogeneous, c) non-controversial. They
are also terribly bright. Well, as one might expect, first impressions
are pretty misleading.
Stanford is a residence college, which means that undergraduates,
with very few exceptions, live in dormitories on the campus. They
are consequently under the thumb of the administration, and the
Stanford catalogue contains what might be termed a university
"enabling act."
"Attendance at Stanford is a privilege, not a right," it reads,
and it then goes on to inform the would-be recipient of this privilege
that he may be asked to leave vale Stanford if his behavior is judged
unacceptable by the powers that be.
THIS TYPE OF university is designed to breed a canny and re
sourceful student body. If one wants to step beyond the bounds of
standard decorum (and lives there an undergraduate with soul so
dead, etc.), then it will not do to take that step in any boisterous
manner. The sword of Damocles hangs heavy over the heads at
this place. So, they have to resort to pincer tactics. An event last
Spring serves to illustrate the demands of the situation.
Last Spring, the University decided that it would be wise to install
bomb shelters (or are they fall-out shelters?) on the campus. One
of these can be found in the basement of a building which also houses
a small bank, a barber shop, and a cafeteria, thus providing for the
wealth, lifliness, and appetities of the survivors.
Anyway, this is a sight designed to throw fear into the hearts of
the heroic. One finds oneself confronted by an immense door with a
huge combination lock on it. Above the door is a sign with a glass
cover on it which reads, "In the event of disaster, the first person
here should open this envelope and read the instructions inside," or
words to that effect.
THERE IS NO envelope immediately observable. Next to the door
is a huge pile of what are euphemistically termed, "Box Survival
Crackers," made by Nabisco. Like I said, terrifying.
Well, it seems that a group of Stanford students decided that this
was going too far, and they wanted to protest. So one day they ap
peared, signs in hand, on the campus. The administrators moved
with the speed worthy of a great academic institution, and informed
the protestors that they had not received a permit to demonstrate,
and hence would have to go home and wait until permission was
granted.
IN THE TRUE spirit of American protest movements, they did
so, and a while later, with the blessings of the administration,
marched benighly in an administration-approved area, carefully
avoiding the well-cropped grass, and waved their signs.
The door is still there. And the crackers. And the sign.
What this proves, of course, is the one does not have to grow a
beard to make an impact. In fact, one can work hand-in-glove with
the administration of Stanford to get one's point across. Even the
anarchist caucus from San Jose State now sells their journal in the
Union. No noise. No disruption of business-as-usual. Just orderly,
respectable activity. Just the way tiie school wants it.
