GATJBRAITH ON PARIETAES
(Editor's Note: The following
letter was submitted to the
"Harvard Crimson" by noted
economist John Kenneth Gal
braith, professor of economics
there. The letter appeared in
the November % edition of the
"Crimson" — in the heart of
national publicity accorded to
alleged wild parties and sexual
orgies in Harvard houses —
and is reprinted in full here
by permission of the Crimson.)
To The Editors of the Crimson:
I can't tell you how depressing
it is 1o find Harvard having an
other discussion of these so
called parietal rules. For forty
years, undergraduates with a spe
cial talent for banal controversy,
and no doubt a secondary inter
est in sex, have known that this
subject could be counted on to
arouse a certain frustrated ma
ternalism which lurks, however
unhappily, in the interstices of
any academic administration.
The resulting debate has invari
ably combined exceptional dreari
ness with a crushing misinterpre
tation of the nature of a univer
sity.
The responsibility of the Uni
versity to its students is to pro
vide the best teaching that can
be associated with the scientific,
literary, artistic or other scholar
ly preoccupations of the faculty.
Additionally, it provides libraries,
laboratories and, though less in
dispensably, places of residence.
Once when Harvard College was
in part a privileged academy for
the socially visible, it needed to
assure parents that their more
retarded offspring would have
the supervision of men of the
scoutmaster type who, however
ineffectually, would try to pro
tect them from the natural pen
alties of indolence, alcohol or
lust. Otherwise needed and pres
tigious clients would be com
mitted to other institutions. All
this, happily, is now over. Thou
sands of men and women clamor
for admission for the serious
purposes of the University. It
can be part of our bargain th a t
they look after themselves.
Accordingly, rules need only
reflect the special requirements
of the academic community—the
quiet, good order and opportun
ity for undisturbed sleep that
facilitate reflection and study.
No effort need be made or should
be made to protect individuals
from the consequences of their
own errors, indiscretions or pas
sion. Parents of Harvard and
Radcliffe applicants who feel
their children need a more pro
tective environment should, no
doubt, be put firmly on notice so
that they may send them else
where.
It is clear that from among
those who accept this bargain we
will have all the students we can
accommodate and presumably
they will be more mature. We
will need waste no energy or
money in providing the surrog
ates of parenthood beyond the
appointed time. There will be
misfortunes but it will be recog

nized that these are inherent in
personality and not the result of
failure or efforts to control it.
Our deans will be able to turn
gratefully to the more welcome
tasks of teaching and scholar
ship. Above all, no moral or bio
logical issue being involved, we
will be spared, praise God, any
further discussion of these rules.
Those who (one hopes on th e
basis of some special compet
ence) are fascinated by the ques
tion of whether undergraduates
are improved or damaged by
forncation can organize private
discussion groups or, if married,
talk about it with their wives.

LASSU, STUDENT CONGRESS
Editor, The Daily:
After much protest the Board
of Trustees last spring an
nounced a "liberalization" of the
policy which had governed offi
cial student comment on extra
campus affairs. In the aftermath
of this "change" the Stanford
Student Congress was created.
Enthusiasts saw two broad roles
for the Congress: as a forum for
free discussion; and as a "voice"
to act in lieu of the traditional
restrictions imposed upon the
Legislature.
Despite the hard work of a
very able Speaker, Dennis Swee
ney, broad student support for
the Congress has yet to be rea
lized. Two conclusions seem evi
dent. Either the long-voiced con
viction that extra-campus issues
are not a matter of serious stu
dent concern is valid, or some
aspect in the structure of the
Congress has caused students to
withhold their support.
The former position seems
hardly tenable in light of the
Stanford reaction to the Missis
sippi "mock-vote." Student dis
appointment in the Congress, I
believe, is primarily centered in
the philosophical imbalance of
the dichotomous functions it has
inherited. The value of the Con
gress as forum of free discussion
cannot be denied. Nevertheless,
the illusion of the Congress as
a responsible substitute for the
Legislature's involuntary silence
we would do well to discard.
An organization with legisla
tive responsibilities speaks norm
ally with whatever persuasion
an organized electorate is willing
to provide. The Congress, of
course, has no such electrate, al
though presumably one could be
solicited. But should it be neces
sary to maintain two elected stu
dent forums? The simple solu
tion is to remove the Legislature
restrictions, and if the majority
of students acquiesce, allow the
Legislature Ihe discretion of de
fining its own limits of interest.
The Congress, of course, must
be supported in realizing its pri
mary role, that of unimpeded
discussion, but the responsibility
of official student comment
should be vested in its legitimate
sources, the elected Legislature.

the illusion of the Congress as

we would do well to discard.
An organization with legisla

an organized electorate is willing
to provide. The Congress, of

tion is to remove the Legislature
restrictions, and if the majority
of students acquiesce, allow the

The Congress, of course, must
be supported in realizing its pri

(Editor's Note: The following
letter was submitted to the
"Harvard Crimson" by noted
economist John Kenneth Gal
braith, professor of economics
there. The letter appeared in
the November % edition of the
"Crimson" — in the heart of
national publicity accorded to
alleged wild parties and sexual
orgies in Harvard houses —
and is reprinted in full here
by permission of the Crimson.)
To The Editors of the Crimson:
I can't tell you how depressing
it is 1o find Harvard having an
other discussion of these so
called parietal rules. For forty
years, undergraduates with a spe
cial talent for banal controversy,
and no doubt a secondary inter
est in sex, have known that this
subject could be counted on to
arouse a certain frustrated ma
ternalism which lurks, however
unhappily, in the interstices of
any academic administration.
The resulting debate has invari
ably combined exceptional dreari
ness with a crushing misinterpre
tation of the nature of a univer
sity.
The responsibility of the Uni
versity to its students is to pro
vide the best teaching that can
be associated with the scientific,
literary, artistic or other scholar
ly preoccupations of the faculty.
Additionally, it provides libraries,
laboratories and, though less in
dispensably, places of residence.
Once when Harvard College was
in part a privileged academy for
the socially visible, it needed to
assure parents that their more
retarded offspring would have
the supervision of men of the
scoutmaster type who, however
ineffectually, would try to pro
tect them from the natural pen
alties of indolence, alcohol or
lust. Otherwise needed and pres
tigious clients would be com
mitted to other institutions. All
this, happily, is now over. Thou
sands of men and women clamor
for admission for the serious
purposes of the University. It
can be part of our bargain th a t
they look after themselves.
Accordingly, rules need only
reflect the special requirements
of the academic community—the
quiet, good order and opportun
ity for undisturbed sleep that
facilitate reflection and study.
No effort need be made or should
be made to protect individuals
from the consequences of their
own errors, indiscretions or pas
sion. Parents of Harvard and
Radcliffe applicants who feel
their children need a more pro
tective environment should, no
doubt, be put firmly on notice so
that they may send them else
where.
It is clear that from among
those who accept this bargain we
will have all the students we can
accommodate and presumably
they will be more mature. We
will need waste no energy or
money in providing the surrog
ates of parenthood beyond the
appointed time. There will be
misfortunes but it will be recog

nized that these are inherent in
personality and not the result of
failure or efforts to control it.
Our deans will be able to turn
gratefully to the more welcome
tasks of teaching and scholar
ship. Above all, no moral or bio
logical issue being involved, we
will be spared, praise God, any
further discussion of these rules.
Those who (one hopes on th e
basis of some special compet
ence) are fascinated by the ques
tion of whether undergraduates
are improved or damaged by
forncation can organize private
discussion groups or, if married,
talk about it with their wives.

After much protest the Board
of Trustees last spring an

policy which had governed offi

of this "change" the Stanford

Editor, The Daily:
After much protest the Board
of Trustees last spring an
nounced a "liberalization" of the
policy which had governed offi
cial student comment on extra
campus affairs. In the aftermath
of this "change" the Stanford
Student Congress was created.
Enthusiasts saw two broad roles
for the Congress: as a forum for
free discussion; and as a "voice"
to act in lieu of the traditional
restrictions imposed upon the
Legislature.
Despite the hard work of a
very able Speaker, Dennis Swee
ney, broad student support for
the Congress has yet to be rea
lized. Two conclusions seem evi
dent. Either the long-voiced con
viction that extra-campus issues
are not a matter of serious stu
dent concern is valid, or some
aspect in the structure of the
Congress has caused students to
withhold their support.
The former position seems
hardly tenable in light of the
Stanford reaction to the Missis
sippi "mock-vote." Student dis
appointment in the Congress, I
believe, is primarily centered in
the philosophical imbalance of
the dichotomous functions it has
inherited. The value of the Con
gress as forum of free discussion
cannot be denied. Nevertheless,
the illusion of the Congress as
a responsible substitute for the
Legislature's involuntary silence
we would do well to discard.
An organization with legisla
tive responsibilities speaks norm
ally with whatever persuasion
an organized electorate is willing
to provide. The Congress, of
course, has no such electrate, al
though presumably one could be
solicited. But should it be neces
sary to maintain two elected stu
dent forums? The simple solu
tion is to remove the Legislature
restrictions, and if the majority
of students acquiesce, allow the
Legislature Ihe discretion of de
fining its own limits of interest.
The Congress, of course, must
be supported in realizing its pri
mary role, that of unimpeded
discussion, but the responsibility
of official student comment
should be vested in its legitimate
sources, the elected Legislature.

(Editor's Note: The following
letter was submitted to the
"Harvard Crimson" by noted
economist John Kenneth Gal
braith, professor of economics
there. The letter appeared in
the November % edition of the
"Crimson" — in the heart of
national publicity accorded to
alleged wild parties and sexual
orgies in Harvard houses —
and is reprinted in full here
by permission of the Crimson.)
To The Editors of the Crimson:
I can't tell you how depressing
it is 1o find Harvard having an
other discussion of these so
called parietal rules. For forty
years, undergraduates with a spe
cial talent for banal controversy,
and no doubt a secondary inter
est in sex, have known that this
subject could be counted on to
arouse a certain frustrated ma
ternalism which lurks, however
unhappily, in the interstices of
any academic administration.
The resulting debate has invari
ably combined exceptional dreari
ness with a crushing misinterpre
tation of the nature of a univer
sity.
The responsibility of the Uni
versity to its students is to pro
vide the best teaching that can
be associated with the scientific,
literary, artistic or other scholar
ly preoccupations of the faculty.
Additionally, it provides libraries,
laboratories and, though less in
dispensably, places of residence.
Once when Harvard College was
in part a privileged academy for
the socially visible, it needed to
assure parents that their more
retarded offspring would have
the supervision of men of the
scoutmaster type who, however
ineffectually, would try to pro
tect them from the natural pen
alties of indolence, alcohol or
lust. Otherwise needed and pres
tigious clients would be com
mitted to other institutions. All
this, happily, is now over. Thou
sands of men and women clamor
for admission for the serious
purposes of the University. It
can be part of our bargain th a t
they look after themselves.
Accordingly, rules need only
reflect the special requirements
of the academic community—the
quiet, good order and opportun
ity for undisturbed sleep that
facilitate reflection and study.
No effort need be made or should
be made to protect individuals
from the consequences of their
own errors, indiscretions or pas
sion. Parents of Harvard and
Radcliffe applicants who feel
their children need a more pro
tective environment should, no
doubt, be put firmly on notice so
that they may send them else
where.
It is clear that from among
those who accept this bargain we
will have all the students we can
accommodate and presumably
they will be more mature. We
will need waste no energy or
money in providing the surrog
ates of parenthood beyond the
appointed time. There will be
misfortunes but it will be recog

nized that these are inherent in
personality and not the result of
failure or efforts to control it.
Our deans will be able to turn
gratefully to the more welcome
