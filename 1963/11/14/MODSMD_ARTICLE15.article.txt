STUDENT CONGRESS
Editor, The Daily:
The fund inn of the Stanford
Student Congress is to give the
student a chance to speak out on
campus national and interna
tional issues. As such it provides
an opportunity for the Stanford
student, body to enter into argu
ments concerning these issues;
a resolution passed by the Stu
dent Congress is a reflection of
the thought found in the student
body. At the last meeting I be
lieve that a tragic misrepresenta
tion of these opinions took place
when a minority of fifteen people
from the Civil Liberties Union
adopted a resolution that was
made public as being the opinion
of Stanford students. The tra
gedy is that this resolution is
taken to be the product of Stan
ford students when in fact it rep
resents only a very minute por
tion of the total student commu
nity.
Stanford students will soon
emerge into positions of leader
ship and responsibility in o u r
community and cannot allow
themselves to remain politically
indolent and passive on questions
thai are important in our times.
Despite the fact that the FCC's
investigation of KPFA is not a
burning political issue, the Stan
ford student should be concerned
with the Student Congress be
cause it affords him a chance to
express himself. I think it is a
privilege to be able to speak out
on national issues in a free so
ciety, and for the Stanford stu
dent not to participate in th is
Congress is certainly a reflection
upon him politically.
The Stanford Student Congress
is not set up to see whether lib
erals can defeat conservatives or
not, but its purpose is 1o promote
Ihe expression of ideas on an
issue. Interaction of ideas is
paramount. For political ideas
are worthless and nothing if un
tested and maintained passively
in an individual. There is a need
to remove a political apathy
found in the Stanford student's
approach to the Student Con
gress.
The Stanford Student Congress
can provide a place for the inter
action of political elements at
Stanford. Instead of the Young
Republicans or Democrats going
to their separate meetings and
patting each other on the backs
for such brillant political opin
ions, they can attend the Stan
ford Student Congress and test
their ideas against each other on
certain issues.
The Stanford Student Congress
should be able to provide an op
portunity for students to express
their political ideas. The Stan
ford students should not let their
political ideas be dominated by
a small group, but must take an
active interest in personal par
ticipation in the Student Con
gress.

Tuesday night's meeting of the
Stanford Student Congress was
indeed a travesty — thirty people
showed up for a meeting of a
group representing the political
forum of a university of ten thou
sand students. Where is the sense
of responsibility of Stanford stu
dents? Can this be the same stu
dent body which manifested such
intense support of the civil rights
campaign in Mississippi just two
weeks ago? Where is the inter
est now? Are Stanford students
so concerned with their personal
interests that they have no con
cern for a body which provides
the only open political forum on
campus?
The resolution before the Con
gress Tuesday night, concerning

the investigation of radio station j
KPFA by the Federal Communi
cations Commission, could have
been replaced by one more ger
mane to a large portion of Stan
ford students. However, it would
seem that, even as a matter of
pride, one should not allow him
self and thousands of others to j
be represented by a mere hand-;
ful expressing only one view- 1
point. This lack of representa
tion resulted in the adoption of
a resolution by a group of fifteen
persons, most of whom were
members of the Stanford Civil
Liberties Union. Ideas can only
be tested by being challenged.
Tuesday night there was no one
to challenge the efforts and ideas
of this group. The resolution
was passed without opposition by
a group which could not possibly j
represent all the various political
opinions of Stanford students.
If Stanford students continue 1
to forego the right of open dis-1
cussion of political events, I do '
not doubt that they will lose that
right. The Stanford Student Con
gress is the only means for such
discussion at the present time.
If it does not receive the support :
of the students, it will atrophy j
and die, and an important stu-!
dent right will have been lost.

The University is to be con
demned for procuring such a
fine film as "Billy Budd" for the
flicks. The very excellence of
the film has stirred up ill-starred
and ominous sentiment which;
threatens to endanger the stu
dent's sacred right to whistle,
howl and shout obscenities. Stu
dents of the University!! Will
we allow such craven "culture
lovers" (ugh!) to take away our
Sunday night substitute for get
ting drunk or raping a girl? Will
we no more be able to bask in
the glow of crowds sent into
howls of laughter by our very
own obscene remarks? Will we
no longer be able to match wits
at finding filth where most per
verted minds would fail? Frus
tration-releasers, unite!!!
Let us examine closely the in
sidious arguments of those who
are plotting our further frustra
tion. They suggest that there is
more value in becoming involved
in a film which significantly ex
amines the human condition,
than in screaming crude com
ments at it. This argument shows
just, how little they know about,
the gnawing depths of our frus
tration. Secondly, they claim
that we violate their right to en
joy the movie by our hilarious
and comradely noises. Send all
such anti-social churls into Palo
Alto for their "aesthetic appre
ciation!!"
Finally, we must request that
the University cease procuring I
films of the calibre of "Billy
Budd" for our Sunday night orgy.
We say 1 his regretfully, because
there was certainly a kind of
rare enjoyment: in turning some
thing obviously meant to be tak
en seriously into a vehicle of ten
sion release. How much louder
the laughs were, thanks to 1 he
restrictive dramatic setting which
the movie provided! "Billy Budd"
was a challenge: could we over
come the fine acting, atmosphere,
and theme which theatened our
fun? We answered that chal
lenge—gloriously!! But no more
"Billy Budd's," please. They tend
to encourage the "culture-lovers"
who want to enjoy such movies
to undermine the wonderful at
mosphere of frustration-release
and abandon that now reigns at
the flicks.

Sunday night substitute for get

Let us examine closely the in

more value in becoming involved

just, how little they know about,

Finally, we must request that
the University cease procuring I

We say 1 his regretfully, because
there was certainly a kind of
rare enjoyment: in turning some
thing obviously meant to be tak

restrictive dramatic setting which
the movie provided! "Billy Budd"
was a challenge: could we over

STUDENT CONGRESS
Editor, The Daily:
The fund inn of the Stanford
Student Congress is to give the
student a chance to speak out on
campus national and interna
tional issues. As such it provides
an opportunity for the Stanford
student, body to enter into argu
ments concerning these issues;
a resolution passed by the Stu
dent Congress is a reflection of
the thought found in the student
body. At the last meeting I be
lieve that a tragic misrepresenta
tion of these opinions took place
when a minority of fifteen people
from the Civil Liberties Union
adopted a resolution that was
made public as being the opinion
of Stanford students. The tra
gedy is that this resolution is
taken to be the product of Stan
ford students when in fact it rep
resents only a very minute por
tion of the total student commu
nity.
Stanford students will soon
emerge into positions of leader
ship and responsibility in o u r
community and cannot allow
themselves to remain politically
indolent and passive on questions
thai are important in our times.
Despite the fact that the FCC's
investigation of KPFA is not a
burning political issue, the Stan
ford student should be concerned
with the Student Congress be
cause it affords him a chance to
express himself. I think it is a
privilege to be able to speak out
on national issues in a free so
ciety, and for the Stanford stu
dent not to participate in th is
Congress is certainly a reflection
upon him politically.
The Stanford Student Congress
is not set up to see whether lib
erals can defeat conservatives or
not, but its purpose is 1o promote
Ihe expression of ideas on an
issue. Interaction of ideas is
paramount. For political ideas
are worthless and nothing if un
tested and maintained passively
in an individual. There is a need
to remove a political apathy
found in the Stanford student's
approach to the Student Con
gress.
The Stanford Student Congress
can provide a place for the inter
action of political elements at
Stanford. Instead of the Young
Republicans or Democrats going
to their separate meetings and
patting each other on the backs
for such brillant political opin
ions, they can attend the Stan
ford Student Congress and test
their ideas against each other on
certain issues.
The Stanford Student Congress
should be able to provide an op
portunity for students to express
their political ideas. The Stan
ford students should not let their
political ideas be dominated by
a small group, but must take an
active interest in personal par
ticipation in the Student Con
gress.

Tuesday night's meeting of the
Stanford Student Congress was
indeed a travesty — thirty people
showed up for a meeting of a
group representing the political
forum of a university of ten thou
sand students. Where is the sense
of responsibility of Stanford stu
dents? Can this be the same stu
dent body which manifested such
intense support of the civil rights
campaign in Mississippi just two
weeks ago? Where is the inter
est now? Are Stanford students
so concerned with their personal
interests that they have no con
cern for a body which provides
the only open political forum on
campus?
The resolution before the Con
gress Tuesday night, concerning

the investigation of radio station j
KPFA by the Federal Communi
cations Commission, could have
been replaced by one more ger
mane to a large portion of Stan
ford students. However, it would
seem that, even as a matter of
pride, one should not allow him
self and thousands of others to j
be represented by a mere hand-;
ful expressing only one view- 1
point. This lack of representa
tion resulted in the adoption of
a resolution by a group of fifteen
persons, most of whom were
members of the Stanford Civil
Liberties Union. Ideas can only
be tested by being challenged.
Tuesday night there was no one
to challenge the efforts and ideas
of this group. The resolution
was passed without opposition by
a group which could not possibly j
represent all the various political
opinions of Stanford students.
If Stanford students continue 1
to forego the right of open dis-1
cussion of political events, I do '
not doubt that they will lose that
right. The Stanford Student Con
gress is the only means for such
discussion at the present time.
If it does not receive the support :
of the students, it will atrophy j
and die, and an important stu-!
dent right will have been lost.

so concerned with their personal
interests that they have no con
cern for a body which provides
the only open political forum on
campus?
The resolution before the Con
gress Tuesday night, concerning

the investigation of radio station j
KPFA by the Federal Communi
cations Commission, could have
been replaced by one more ger
mane to a large portion of Stan
ford students. However, it would
seem that, even as a matter of
pride, one should not allow him
self and thousands of others to j
be represented by a mere hand-;
ful expressing only one view- 1
point. This lack of representa
tion resulted in the adoption of
a resolution by a group of fifteen
persons, most of whom were
members of the Stanford Civil
Liberties Union. Ideas can only
be tested by being challenged.
Tuesday night there was no one
to challenge the efforts and ideas
of this group. The resolution
was passed without opposition by
a group which could not possibly j
represent all the various political
opinions of Stanford students.
If Stanford students continue 1
to forego the right of open dis-1
cussion of political events, I do '
not doubt that they will lose that
right. The Stanford Student Con
gress is the only means for such
discussion at the present time.
If it does not receive the support :
of the students, it will atrophy j
and die, and an important stu-!
dent right will have been lost.

The University is to be con
demned for procuring such a
fine film as "Billy Budd" for the
flicks. The very excellence of
the film has stirred up ill-starred
and ominous sentiment which;
threatens to endanger the stu
dent's sacred right to whistle,
howl and shout obscenities. Stu
dents of the University!! Will
we allow such craven "culture
lovers" (ugh!) to take away our
Sunday night substitute for get
ting drunk or raping a girl? Will
we no more be able to bask in
the glow of crowds sent into
howls of laughter by our very
own obscene remarks? Will we
no longer be able to match wits
at finding filth where most per
verted minds would fail? Frus
tration-releasers, unite!!!
Let us examine closely the in
sidious arguments of those who
are plotting our further frustra
tion. They suggest that there is
more value in becoming involved
in a film which significantly ex
amines the human condition,
than in screaming crude com
ments at it. This argument shows
just, how little they know about,
the gnawing depths of our frus
tration. Secondly, they claim
that we violate their right to en
joy the movie by our hilarious
and comradely noises. Send all
such anti-social churls into Palo
Alto for their "aesthetic appre
ciation!!"
Finally, we must request that
the University cease procuring I
films of the calibre of "Billy
Budd" for our Sunday night orgy.
We say 1 his regretfully, because
there was certainly a kind of
rare enjoyment: in turning some
thing obviously meant to be tak
en seriously into a vehicle of ten
sion release. How much louder
the laughs were, thanks to 1 he
restrictive dramatic setting which
the movie provided! "Billy Budd"
was a challenge: could we over
come the fine acting, atmosphere,
and theme which theatened our
fun? We answered that chal
lenge—gloriously!! But no more
"Billy Budd's," please. They tend
to encourage the "culture-lovers"
who want to enjoy such movies
to undermine the wonderful at
mosphere of frustration-release
and abandon that now reigns at
the flicks.

STUDENT CONGRESS
Editor, The Daily:
The fund inn of the Stanford
Student Congress is to give the
student a chance to speak out on
campus national and interna
tional issues. As such it provides
an opportunity for the Stanford
student, body to enter into argu
ments concerning these issues;
a resolution passed by the Stu
dent Congress is a reflection of
the thought found in the student
body. At the last meeting I be
lieve that a tragic misrepresenta
tion of these opinions took place
when a minority of fifteen people
from the Civil Liberties Union
adopted a resolution that was
made public as being the opinion
of Stanford students. The tra
gedy is that this resolution is
taken to be the product of Stan
ford students when in fact it rep
resents only a very minute por
tion of the total student commu
nity.
Stanford students will soon
emerge into positions of leader
ship and responsibility in o u r
community and cannot allow
themselves to remain politically
indolent and passive on questions
thai are important in our times.
Despite the fact that the FCC's
investigation of KPFA is not a
burning political issue, the Stan
ford student should be concerned
with the Student Congress be
cause it affords him a chance to
express himself. I think it is a
privilege to be able to speak out
on national issues in a free so
ciety, and for the Stanford stu
dent not to participate in th is
Congress is certainly a reflection
upon him politically.
The Stanford Student Congress
is not set up to see whether lib
erals can defeat conservatives or
not, but its purpose is 1o promote
Ihe expression of ideas on an
issue. Interaction of ideas is
paramount. For political ideas
are worthless and nothing if un
tested and maintained passively
in an individual. There is a need
to remove a political apathy
found in the Stanford student's
approach to the Student Con
gress.
The Stanford Student Congress
can provide a place for the inter
action of political elements at
Stanford. Instead of the Young
Republicans or Democrats going
to their separate meetings and
patting each other on the backs
for such brillant political opin
ions, they can attend the Stan
ford Student Congress and test
their ideas against each other on
certain issues.
The Stanford Student Congress
should be able to provide an op
portunity for students to express
their political ideas. The Stan
ford students should not let their
political ideas be dominated by
a small group, but must take an
active interest in personal par
ticipation in the Student Con
gress.

cause it affords him a chance to
express himself. I think it is a
privilege to be able to speak out
on national issues in a free so
ciety, and for the Stanford stu
dent not to participate in th is
Congress is certainly a reflection
upon him politically.
The Stanford Student Congress
is not set up to see whether lib
erals can defeat conservatives or
not, but its purpose is 1o promote
Ihe expression of ideas on an
issue. Interaction of ideas is
paramount. For political ideas
are worthless and nothing if un
tested and maintained passively
in an individual. There is a need
to remove a political apathy
found in the Stanford student's
approach to the Student Con
gress.
The Stanford Student Congress
can provide a place for the inter
action of political elements at
Stanford. Instead of the Young
Republicans or Democrats going
to their separate meetings and
patting each other on the backs
for such brillant political opin
ions, they can attend the Stan
ford Student Congress and test
their ideas against each other on
certain issues.
The Stanford Student Congress
should be able to provide an op
portunity for students to express
their political ideas. The Stan
ford students should not let their
political ideas be dominated by
a small group, but must take an
active interest in personal par
ticipation in the Student Con
gress.

Tuesday night's meeting of the
Stanford Student Congress was
indeed a travesty — thirty people
showed up for a meeting of a
group representing the political
forum of a university of ten thou
sand students. Where is the sense
of responsibility of Stanford stu
dents? Can this be the same stu
dent body which manifested such
intense support of the civil rights
campaign in Mississippi just two
weeks ago? Where is the inter
est now? Are Stanford students
so concerned with their personal
interests that they have no con
cern for a body which provides
the only open political forum on
campus?
The resolution before the Con
gress Tuesday night, concerning

the investigation of radio station j
KPFA by the Federal Communi
cations Commission, could have
been replaced by one more ger
mane to a large portion of Stan
ford students. However, it would
seem that, even as a matter of
pride, one should not allow him
self and thousands of others to j
be represented by a mere hand-;
ful expressing only one view- 1
point. This lack of representa
tion resulted in the adoption of
a resolution by a group of fifteen
persons, most of whom were
members of the Stanford Civil
Liberties Union. Ideas can only
be tested by being challenged.
Tuesday night there was no one
to challenge the efforts and ideas
of this group. The resolution
was passed without opposition by
a group which could not possibly j
represent all the various political
opinions of Stanford students.
If Stanford students continue 1
to forego the right of open dis-1
cussion of political events, I do '
not doubt that they will lose that
right. The Stanford Student Con
gress is the only means for such
discussion at the present time.
If it does not receive the support :
of the students, it will atrophy j
and die, and an important stu-!
dent right will have been lost.

The University is to be con
demned for procuring such a
fine film as "Billy Budd" for the
flicks. The very excellence of
the film has stirred up ill-starred
and ominous sentiment which;
threatens to endanger the stu
dent's sacred right to whistle,
howl and shout obscenities. Stu
dents of the University!! Will
we allow such craven "culture
lovers" (ugh!) to take away our
Sunday night substitute for get
ting drunk or raping a girl? Will
we no more be able to bask in
the glow of crowds sent into
howls of laughter by our very
own obscene remarks? Will we
no longer be able to match wits
at finding filth where most per
verted minds would fail? Frus
tration-releasers, unite!!!
Let us examine closely the in
sidious arguments of those who
are plotting our further frustra
tion. They suggest that there is
more value in becoming involved
in a film which significantly ex
amines the human condition,
than in screaming crude com
ments at it. This argument shows
just, how little they know about,
the gnawing depths of our frus
tration. Secondly, they claim
that we violate their right to en
joy the movie by our hilarious
and comradely noises. Send all
such anti-social churls into Palo
Alto for their "aesthetic appre
ciation!!"
Finally, we must request that
the University cease procuring I
films of the calibre of "Billy
Budd" for our Sunday night orgy.
We say 1 his regretfully, because
there was certainly a kind of
rare enjoyment: in turning some
thing obviously meant to be tak
en seriously into a vehicle of ten
sion release. How much louder
the laughs were, thanks to 1 he
restrictive dramatic setting which
the movie provided! "Billy Budd"
was a challenge: could we over
come the fine acting, atmosphere,
and theme which theatened our
fun? We answered that chal
lenge—gloriously!! But no more
"Billy Budd's," please. They tend
to encourage the "culture-lovers"
who want to enjoy such movies
to undermine the wonderful at
mosphere of frustration-release
and abandon that now reigns at
the flicks.

STUDENT CONGRESS
Editor, The Daily:
The fund inn of the Stanford
Student Congress is to give the
student a chance to speak out on
campus national and interna
tional issues. As such it provides
an opportunity for the Stanford
student, body to enter into argu
ments concerning these issues;
a resolution passed by the Stu
dent Congress is a reflection of
the thought found in the student
body. At the last meeting I be
lieve that a tragic misrepresenta
tion of these opinions took place
when a minority of fifteen people
from the Civil Liberties Union
adopted a resolution that was
made public as being the opinion
of Stanford students. The tra
gedy is that this resolution is
taken to be the product of Stan
ford students when in fact it rep
resents only a very minute por
tion of the total student commu
nity.
Stanford students will soon
emerge into positions of leader
ship and responsibility in o u r
community and cannot allow
themselves to remain politically
indolent and passive on questions
thai are important in our times.
Despite the fact that the FCC's
investigation of KPFA is not a
burning political issue, the Stan
ford student should be concerned
with the Student Congress be
cause it affords him a chance to
express himself. I think it is a

on national issues in a free so
