# WSU Could Be Tough
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Washington Slate University's
Coach Jim Sutherland will bring
down his crimson and grey Cou
gars to Stanford Saturday after
noon in hopes of mauling a few
Indians. WSU's task is a diffi
cut one, though, as the Cougars
are doing poorly in the injury
department.
Ken Graham, regarded as
Washington State's top back hurt
his knee and has been off again
and on again in the back field.
Last year Graham was the num-

I her two rusher and the number
three pass receiver on the squad.
! Another starting back who may
1 be watching from the sidelines is
Herm MeKee. Slated as the num
ber one fullback McKee tore the
cartilege in his knee and has been
out of action for over a month.
KM) DKNNIB Ki.OKE, the
surprise of last spring practice
was counted on heavily before
the season but has been ham
pered by a broken hand.
Both McKee and Kloke have
been coming along well and stand
a good chance of starting against
Stanford.
The disappointment of the year
for WSU rooters has been quar
terback Dave Mathieson. Last
year with Hugh Campbell as his
prime target Mathieson com
pleted 53 per cent of his passes
for 1.472 yards and twelve touch
downs. This year he has gained
797 yards through the air but
most of it has been on short
passes. He has only thrown three
T.D. passes and nine of his
aerials have been intercepted.
A BRIGHT SPOT for the Cou
gars, however, has been Clarence
Williams. The G'2", 195-pound
halfback is the number two
rusher in the AAWU with 416
yards. Coach Sutherland counts
heavily on Williams to keep the
WSU ground attack alive.
If quarterback Mathieson gets
untracked and if the injured
players are able to starl the Cou-
I gers could give the Indians a
rough afternoon.

gars to Stanford Saturday after
noon in hopes of mauling a few
Indians. WSU's task is a diffi
cut one, though, as the Cougars
are doing poorly in the injury
department.
Ken Graham, regarded as
Washington State's top back hurt
his knee and has been off again
and on again in the back field.
Last year Graham was the num-

I her two rusher and the number
three pass receiver on the squad.
! Another starting back who may
1 be watching from the sidelines is
Herm MeKee. Slated as the num
ber one fullback McKee tore the
cartilege in his knee and has been
out of action for over a month.
KM) DKNNIB Ki.OKE, the
surprise of last spring practice
was counted on heavily before
the season but has been ham
pered by a broken hand.
Both McKee and Kloke have
been coming along well and stand
a good chance of starting against
Stanford.
The disappointment of the year
for WSU rooters has been quar
terback Dave Mathieson. Last
year with Hugh Campbell as his
prime target Mathieson com
pleted 53 per cent of his passes
for 1.472 yards and twelve touch
downs. This year he has gained
797 yards through the air but
most of it has been on short
passes. He has only thrown three
T.D. passes and nine of his
aerials have been intercepted.
A BRIGHT SPOT for the Cou
gars, however, has been Clarence
Williams. The G'2", 195-pound
halfback is the number two
rusher in the AAWU with 416
yards. Coach Sutherland counts
heavily on Williams to keep the
WSU ground attack alive.
If quarterback Mathieson gets
untracked and if the injured
players are able to starl the Cou-
I gers could give the Indians a
rough afternoon.
