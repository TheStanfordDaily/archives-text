# Road Race In Lagunita
## 
### 
Zeta Psi fraternity is sponsor
ing the first annual Lagunita
Seca Road Race Saturday after
noon. The course recently com
pleted by an army of engineers
is considered to be the toughest
half mile course in existence.
Practice runs and time trials
will begin at 9:00 a.m.. while the
actual race will begin as soon
I as possible after the Stanford-
Washington State game.
Because of the difficulty in ob
i taining insurance and the high
price which finally had to be paid
I the student police will be very
| strict in the enforcement of
i safety precautions.
The Zetes will also have an all
campus open house featuring a
band and refreshments.
Thus far there ai'e fifteen en
tries. Seedings will be drawn by
lot but Mark Winbigler who com
l peted in the recent Laguna Seca
race in Monterey is an unofficial
â–  favorite.
