## Now is the Time 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Stanford has produced many lino fool hall teams, but best of all
were the "Vow Boys" of '33, '34. and '35 and the "Wow Boys" of
1910. The "Vow Boys" led by Bobby Grayson, Bones Hamilton, Monk
Moscrip, and Bob Reynolds were a talent-laden outfit 1 hat received
three Hose Bowl bids. The year 1940 saw Clark Shaughnessy, in
his initial campaign at Stanford, install the T-formation which iho
"Wow Boys" used to roar through Iho regular season and the Rose
Bowl undefeated.
This year's Stanford football team is a good one. It has been
decidedly outplayed in Only one gamo, tho Oregon debacle. Field
goals have handed Stanford two more defeats, and the other three
losses were see-saw affairs that Stanford allowed to slip through
their fingers. Perhaps a nickname, using the "Vow" "Wow" rhyme,
is in order. Ilere are a few suggestions:
HARD-NOSED FOOTBALL
POW BOYS: "They hit harder than any team w'eve played yet."
This quote accredited to a Rice player typifies the comments of the
players and coaches that Stanford has played against this year. The
forward wall battlers include Frank Patilucci, Marv Harris, Bob
Nichols, John Wilbur, Jack Chappie, Chuck Hartwig, and A 1 Ililde
brand. to name a few. Twice in losing efforts, Stanford has had
one of its players picked for Lineman of the Game. Patitucci
received the honor in the USC and UCLA games. Furthermore,
John Wilbur picked up AAWU Lineman of the Week laurels after
the Notre Dame fray.
The defensive hackfield has contributed its share of bruising
tackles although, admittedly, the pass defense has at times been
weak. Composing the defensive secondary have been, at various
times, Craig Ritchey, Ray Handley, Dick Ragsdale, Carl Shroyer,
J. D. Lodato. and Steve Thurlow. Craig Ritchey, in a defensive capa
city was voted co-back of the game against UCLA.
HOW BOYS: How can Stanford lose so many close games? How
can such a good football team send scares into the toughest oppo
nents on its schedule and have put only two assets on this season's
ledger? If there were such a thing as the Delphian oracle, perhaps
Coach John Ralston could find the answer; but in the absence of
such assistance, he must attempt to curtail critical errors in other
ways.
NOW IS THE TIME
NOW BOYS: After a miserable existence on the road. Stanford
returns io its home reservation to do battle for the last two games
of the season. The Cards find Stanford Stadium a more congenial
atmosphere, playing five-hundred football in four games. Now is the
time for Stanford to end its two game losing streak and let fly some
fur Cougar and Golden Bear fur.
