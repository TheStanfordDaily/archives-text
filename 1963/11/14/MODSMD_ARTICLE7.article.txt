## 'Whites to Pay for Rights Delay' 
### NORMAN GREENBERG 
For the greater part of the twentieth century,
Norman Thomas has been a prominent and out
spoken critic of the political, social and economic
scene in America. Ho has come to Stanford and
has spoken at the seminars in Stern Hall, con
cerned with the plight of men without the rights
of man, the Negro and the migrant laborer.
All those who have worked for civil rights in
the South have come away filled with the tension,
the injustice, and the tragedy of the conflict.
Norman Thomas is no exception, feeling that the
racial crisis is about to reach a climax.
"IT IS A great pity the Congress has not acted
more quickly; we'll pay for the delay," he says,
adding that the white man must blame himself
for the mounting impatience of the Negroes. He
feels also that the influence of the Black Muslims
is far greater than their number; "they could pre
vent any open meeting in Harlem."
Thomas believes that legislation can bring the
conditions necessary for tolerance and for equal
ity of opportunity. "1 have heard a givat deal
by people that you can't legislate love," he says,
"but I've never seen any of them proceed to act
without legislation."
Thomas tells the story of a white man who
picked up "the victim of an automobile accident,
a Negro woman. "They traveled miles and miles
and miles, but each hospital refused to admit her.
When they finally found a hospital, she was dead.
. . . See what extraordinarily irrational people we
are."
THOMAS ADMITS that the socialist party has
not been a significant force in ihe racial crisis.
He feels that this is so because the Negro fears
political impotence, fears the while attitude to
wards extremism, and wishes the advantages off
ered by a large, established party.
He feels that a third party finds almost insur
mountable obstacles to its continuing existence
due to the multiplicity of state and national laws
and to the method of electing a president. A
preferential vote or a run-off between the two
highest candidates for President would olfset the

problem now confronted.
Concerning migrant labor, used extensively in
California. Thomas says: "We don't feel that in
ternational relations are promoted by the importa
tion of these migrant workers. I do not believe
that letting these workers in under the present
conditions solves the situation in Mexico.
"And the labor problem here is worsened. I
do not believe that there is any solution until
there is extension of minimum wages. And I'd
like to challenge any who worry about the omni
potence of the state for a better solution, especi
ally when these migrant laborers have no other
spokesman."
He explains that Mexico now postpones con
fronting its own agricultural problem; further
more, he believes that the mechanization of agri
culture is coming despite migrant labor, and this
labor is therefore not maintaining its own em
ployment. He supports the repeal of Public Law
No. 78 and the extension of minimum wage legis
lation.
Thomas also commented:
• On labor unions: "People who talk of strong
states must also talk of strong unions. Civil lib
erties are often better protected in the state, in
times of peace, then in many of the unions."
• On socialized medicine: "Some of the most
unfair one-sided propaganda in the United States
is the propaganda of the AMA. ... It is not true
that socialized medicine is ineffective."
• On Congress: "The creakiest machinery in
the US is the machinery of Congress." lie feels
that the term of office for the House should be
extended to four years, the use of the filibuster
must be limited, and the seniority system must be
amended so that the chairman of a committee
must agree with the principles of his party's plat
form.
• In the rise of Socialism: "Socialism will
come from a general appeal to men as consumers,
not as individual producers."
• In President Eisenhower's farewell address,
warning of the industrial-military complex: "Presi
dent Eisenhower shows us that the grace of God
comes to almost anybody."
