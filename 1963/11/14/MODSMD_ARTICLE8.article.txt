# Elsen Discusses Family of Man In Modern Painting, Sculpture
## 
### LINDA FREIDEL 
The Family of Man in photog
raphy and painting and sculpture
was the subject of last night's lec
ture on art, the third in the series
of the Modernity of Modern Art
given by Dr. Albert Elsen.
In this series Dr. Elsen has con
centrated on the themes of mod
ern art, concepts, environments,
and now persons.
Using the photographs from the
Museum of Modern Art's exhibi
tion, The Family of Man, as a
backdrop and thematic structure,
Dr. Elsen last night discussed
paintings and sculpture dealing
with the life-cycle of man love,
marriage, pregnancy, childbirth,
childhood, adulthood, death, and
the accompanying flavor of life
fear, pain, growth, and delight.
BEFORE DELVING in the
painting, however, Dr. Elsen, in
troduced the photographs with
the remark that many people felt
that the Family of Man exhibition

clarified an earlier, unspoken,
suspision that photography had
replaced the artist in the field of
recording man.
For this reason Dr. Elsen
wished to underline the unphotog
raphable and therefore visually
unexplored territory of people.
This kiss began the Family of
Man Themes, a couple at a pic
nic; next to this photograph was
The Kiss by Brancusi, a monu
ment to a girl who died while
still quite young, in love. The
sculpture, which has seemed to
many a caricature of a kiss, was
the sculptor's image of two
people wishing to merge and lose
identity in one another, what
Brancusi fell was the primal urge
hidden within the kiss.
THI'S Till; lovers appear to be
one block, two figures mirroring
each other, their arms wrapped
around each other, and the limits
of their bodies barely defined,
erased in the kiss. Again the art
ist can make concrete what is
abstract in human growth, being.
THK ARTIST colors the human
fact. Next to the photograph of
a woman pregnant, waiting, lean
ing against a door, is a drawing
by Malta of his fear that his un
born child will die of strangula
tion or will lie deformed. The
nude body of Matta's wife is de
licately outline, headless and
therefore concentrated upon the
womb. Within the womb are
strange growths, the fetus and
the woman's organs, but not rec
ognizable, multiplying in wild
fantasy.
Chagall also opens the womb
of the pregnant mother, but with
joy. to sing of his happiness and
feeling of abundance. The bright
ly clothed mother dances above
the village, pointing to the child
standing in her abdomen.
