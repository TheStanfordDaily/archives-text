Pseudo-Christians
"Nmv it any man have not tile Spirit of Christ, he is none of His." Rom. S:9 K.l.
Xot everyone who claims to he a Christian is spiritually born of (iod. One does not
Ix come a Christian by water baptism, joining a church, or by intellectual assent to
Christian doctrine. In our nation only about half of the members of a typical
Protestant church are true Christians persons who have been regenerated by the
Holy Spirit. It is not surprising that there should be so many pseudo-Christians,
for the l'rince of Fvil is obviously very active in the churches where he tries to
surround the truth with false doctrine, dilute the testimonies of the core of be
livers and stir up dissention among the congregation (e.g. gossipy women). It is
the pseudo-Christians who have given Christianity a bad name and committed in
famous crimes in the name of Christ down thru the ages.
"But if our gospel he hid. it is hid to them that are lost. In whom the God of this
Jft'nrhl hath blinded the nitnrf.s of fheui believe not, h\st the light of the glorious
'gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. For we preach
not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants.for Jesus'
sake." II Cor. 3-5 KJ.
Pseudo-Christians join churches for social or business reasons, and seek soothing
sermons to justify their own conduct. I'nsaved ministers develop their own versions
of the truth and preach that all is well in heaven and earth. It is tragic that many
prominent men of the church, theologians, and teachers are unable to lead others
to a personal relationship with Christ, because they have never themselves given Him
their lives anil received the Spirit of truth. All classes of pseudo-Christians are used
by Satan to "deceive, if it were possible, even the very elect." False Christians
lack the fruits of the Spirit which include compassion, love, and humility; un
aware of spiritual truth, they give themselves away on essential points of Christian
doctrine. Scripture is clear on how to identify pseudo-Christians and false prophets:
"But do not trust any and every spirit, my friends; test the spirits to see whether
they are from God, for among those who have gone out into the world there are
many prophets falsely inspired. This is how we may recognize the Spirit of God:
every spirit which acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from
God, and every spirit which does not thus acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This
is what is meant by Antichrist, you have been told that be- was to come, and here
he is irt the world already!" I John 4:l-. , > N'K.
"Who is a liar but he that detiieth that Jesus is the Christ? lie is antichrist, that
denieth the Father and the Son. Whosoever detiieth the Son, the same hath not
the Fathers; (bnti he that acknowledged the Son hath the Father also." I John
2:20*22 KJ.
"Von must face the fact; the final age of this world is to be a time of troubles.
Men will love nothing but money and self, they will be arrogant, boastful, and
abusive . . . The.v will be men who put pleasure in the place of God, men who pre
serve the outward form of religion, but arc a standing denial of its reality." 2 Tint.
3 :1 5 N K.
"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpreta
tion. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of
God spake as they were moved by the llolv Spirit. But there were false prophets
also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily
shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them . . . and
many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall
be evil spoken of. And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
tnechatidise of you. . . . But there, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and
destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly
perish in their own corruption. . . . These are wells without water, clouds that are
carried with a tempest; to whom the midst of darkness is reserved forever. . . .
For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge
of the I .Ol d ami Saviour Jestis Christ, they are again entangled therein, and ovei
come, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. For it had been better
for them not have known the way of righteousness, than, they have known it. to
turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them, But it is happened accord
ing to the true proverb; The dog is turned of his own vomit again; and the sow
that was washed to he wallowing in the mire." II Peter 1:20-21, 2:1 t, 12. 1",
20. 21. KJ.
True Christians are sure of their salvation, certain that Christ lives. They are
happy to share with those around them the good news. But truth seeker* should
beware of Satan's imitation Christians who exist to mislead tliern and direct them
.may from the one way into eternal life which is only through meeting I' u Clin t
on a personal, individual basis.
