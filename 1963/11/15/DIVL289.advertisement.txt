Our engineers wear
false noses And you are
i right! Making those is child's play.
Rut not so the task of inventing and
producing the Mattel toy that molds
noses—and dozens of other things —
from plastic sheet. It's done with our
new Vac-U-Form™, a working minia
ture of the plastic industry's multi
thousand-dollar vacuum forming
machine. Yet we make it to retail at
under $10.
Maybe you'd enjoy solving the sort

i than 25< '* Or design a child-safe, in-

I of half a million —at a specified com*

Interesting engineering problems
like these are the daily, year-round
business of the professional engineers
Who've helped us become the biggest

1 manufacturer of toys anywhere. Which

already sizeable technical staff. Which

If you have the educational back
ground we need — and the imagination
to turn complicated ideas into simple,
reliable and saleable products — you'll
like working here. And settling your
family in one of the beach or mountain
communities practically next door to
our multi-plant facilities near the Los
