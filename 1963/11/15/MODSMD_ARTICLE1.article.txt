# Law Students Rally to Pick Meyers 'Red Hot Prof'
## 
### PHIL HEINRICHS 
Charles Meyers, professor of
law, last night vanquished his
opponents in a closely-contested
and hotly-fought election battle
for the honor of being this year's
"Red Hot Prof." His vote total of;
39,295 placed him over 5000' ahead ;
of his nearest rival, Dvvight Clark,
dean of freshmen men, who had |
31.187 votes. Third was Author
Schawlow, professor of physics

and co-inventor of the laser, with
8969 votes.
Prof. Meyers owes his victory
to a $75 contribution turned over
to the WUS sponsors of the elec
tion in the last 30 seconds of the
contest. At the time, though, no
body knew who had won because
the vote count was behind due to
the large amount of last minute
contributions, approximately $400
having been turned in during the
final 15 minutes. Money was be
ing put in two paper sacks, one
tor Dean Clark, the other tor
Prof. Meyers.
John Moore, assistant dean of
men and director of Stern houses,
garnered the title of "Ice Cold
Prof" for his magnificent sup
port, leaving him with a total of
minus 792 votes.
With nerves taut in the closing
minutes and the battle between
Dean Clark and Prof. Meyers ap
proaching its climax, two students
rushed in with several dollars
which they placed for Paul Ehr
lich, associate professor of biol
ogy, bringing his total up to
minus 570, thus saving him from
the ignominy of total defeat.
An anonymous first year law
student said of the victor, "He
is intellectually brilliant, stimu
lating in class, extremely appeal
ing to his students, and the all
around 'Red Hot Prof in real
life."
Dean Clark, who didn't know
that the freshmen were going all
out for his victory because he had
been off campus, came back yes
terday to find "Support the Good
Dean" signs all over Wilbur Hall.
Another aspect of the frosh
campaign was the class's ex
tremely large number of penny
votes. This caused even more
concern among the vote counters
than might be expected because
approximately three-fourths of
the 50-penny rolls didn'l have 50
pennies. The indication, accoiding
to qualified sources, seems to be
that this year's freshmen can't
count very well.
Chairman of the WUS fund
drive Bill Klippert supervised the
final counting of the votes with

two law school associates in 1
trench coats looking on. Accord
ing to impartial observers, they
did not attempt to intimidate the
vote tallyers. Steve Dazey was
chairman of the contest.
Being chosen "Red Hot Prof,"
although a great honor, also has
certain duties that go along with
the position. He must lead the
student body in a cheer at to
rn orro w ' s Washington State ;
game. Veteran observers of "Red j
Hot Prof" performances predict '
that Prof. Meyers' cheer will be ;
as inspiring and up-lifting as \
those of his predecessors.
Funds raised from the election j
will go to aid WUS projects)
around the world.
Prof. Meyers was not available I
for comment at press time.
