## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
Stanford University was caught
by surprise yesterday when the
Palo Alto planning commission
! voted to recommend the construe
! tion of a new city hall on a site
lin Stanford's Industrial Park
j area.
The Palo Alto Times, in a
: front page story yesterday, re
! ported the commission had rec
ommended, in a 6-1 vote Wednes
i day night, that a City Hall and
public safety building be built on
I Stanford lands south of Escon
dito Village. The Times noted
| that the proposal would probably
I involve the condemnation of Uni-
I versity land since the founding
j grant prohibits Stanford from
selling its property.
Executive Assistant to the
President Frederick O. Glover ex
pressed surprise at the move.
When informed of the Times ar
ticle by a Daily reporter, Glover
commented, "Your call is the first
word the President's Office has
heard on this."
The parcel of University land
! involved, near the Page Mill
| Road-Hanover Street intersection,
is within the Palo Alto city limits.
Thus it would be possible for the
City to annex the area in order
: to obtain the City Hall site.
A University spokesman noted
| that Stanford had not been con
j taeted prior to the planning com
mission vote. He emphasized,
however, that the Palo Alto City
Council would have to approve
j the commission recommendation
before serious discussions could
be begun.
According to the Times story,
current plans, tentatively ap
proved by the City Council, call
I for the construction of a new ad
; ministration building and public
i safety building housing police,
: fire, and communication head
quarters on the present City
I Hall site.
The Times noted, however, that
i this plan has been strongly crit
icized by residents in the area
| who claim that the public safety
building would "generate noise
and traffic and ruin the quality
of the neighborhood."
Alt' E. Brandin, Stanford Vice
President foi Business Affairs
and director of development for
the Industrial Park, also ex
pressed some surprise at the
planning commission decision. He
commented, "For a long time the
City has been talking about
building a new City Hall at this
Stanford site. But we haven't
been in any conversations with
! the city recently and by recently
1 mean the last two years at least
about this."

: to obtain the City Hall site.
A University spokesman noted
| that Stanford had not been con
j taeted prior to the planning com
mission vote. He emphasized,
however, that the Palo Alto City
Council would have to approve
j the commission recommendation
before serious discussions could
be begun.
According to the Times story,
current plans, tentatively ap
proved by the City Council, call
I for the construction of a new ad
; ministration building and public
i safety building housing police,
: fire, and communication head
quarters on the present City
I Hall site.
The Times noted, however, that
i this plan has been strongly crit
icized by residents in the area
| who claim that the public safety
building would "generate noise
and traffic and ruin the quality
of the neighborhood."
Alt' E. Brandin, Stanford Vice
President foi Business Affairs
and director of development for
the Industrial Park, also ex
pressed some surprise at the
planning commission decision. He
commented, "For a long time the
City has been talking about
building a new City Hall at this
Stanford site. But we haven't
been in any conversations with
! the city recently and by recently
1 mean the last two years at least
about this."
Stanford University was caught
by surprise yesterday when the
Palo Alto planning commission
! voted to recommend the construe
! tion of a new city hall on a site
lin Stanford's Industrial Park
j area.
The Palo Alto Times, in a
: front page story yesterday, re
! ported the commission had rec
ommended, in a 6-1 vote Wednes
i day night, that a City Hall and
public safety building be built on
I Stanford lands south of Escon
dito Village. The Times noted
| that the proposal would probably
I involve the condemnation of Uni-
I versity land since the founding
j grant prohibits Stanford from
selling its property.
Executive Assistant to the
President Frederick O. Glover ex
pressed surprise at the move.
When informed of the Times ar
ticle by a Daily reporter, Glover
commented, "Your call is the first
word the President's Office has
heard on this."
The parcel of University land
! involved, near the Page Mill
| Road-Hanover Street intersection,
is within the Palo Alto city limits.
Thus it would be possible for the
City to annex the area in order
: to obtain the City Hall site.
