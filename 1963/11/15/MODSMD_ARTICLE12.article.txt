(Editor's Note: In connection witli William Buckley's speech
to the campus tonight on the question of United States Foreign
Policy in the East, this column is reprinted with Mr. Buckley's
permission.)
Diem is dead, and Nhu; and there is dancing in the streets of
Saigon and, as a matter of fact, in the streets of New York and
Washington, and other centers of civilization. If the dancers were a
little inhibited, perhaps it is because Madame Nhu still lives—if she
too had been murdered, the joy would have been unconfined. As it
is, she was alive when it happened, in Los Angeles with her daughter,
at the end of a grueling tour of this country during which she tried
to make two points to the American public, namely 1), that the Diem
regime's iniquities were largely fabricated, and 2), that the Diem
regime's survival was central to the success of the anti-Communist
operation in Southeast Asia. Then at one stroke she lost her hus
band, her brother-in-law, her home, her mission. Times marches
on, what?
Funeral orations are generally a bore—the king is dead, long live
the king! What, matters now, we practical people tell ourselves,
is the future: long and expensive burials, as Miss Jessica Mitford
has most recently reminded us, are ghoulist, and are in any case
beside the point. Let us then forswear the oration, and conduct in
stead an inquest, the charge having been laid by the widow Nhu
that her family and regime were killed, actually, in Washington.
The lady must be allowed poetic license. She does not mean to say
that American bullets killed her family—l should say, American
executioners: the bullets were undoubtedly made in the USA—but
rather that her family was killed as a result of American policy.
The genteel way to put it was of course formulated by the "New
York Times"; American activities, said the Times, "helped to prepare
the psychological atmosphere for the coup."
OUR ADMINISTRATION is composed of gentle folk, and it is
utterly safe to say that they must have been made queasy by the
news that soldiers acting on instructions of the generals with whom
we will now be dealing no less convivially than for years we dealt
with Diem, had beat up, and then slaughtered, their president and
commander-in-chief. But what is there to do about people who be
have in un-American ways? Bob McNamara would have done it
differently, but he after all went to Harvard. Those Orientals are
given to extremist ways, as witness the self-immolating bonzes.
Well, so was the end designated for President Diem and his brother
extremist. None of our concern: we must get on with the business
of fighting the Communists in Southeast Asia, unhampered now by
the despotism of Diem, we should be able to get on with the business
much more efficiently.
But Madame Nhu goes on to say that her family was the adminis
trative soul and spirit of the fight against the Communists, and the
prosecutor counters by saying: how can that be? Considering that
the people of South Vietnam danced in the streets at the news of
their downfall? But one might answer, such are the ways of the
people. They dance at the Revolution, and they dance at the Restora
tion. They danced in the streets of Peking when Chiang Kai-shek
was driven away by the Communists. . . . Well but surely we will
now have stability in South Vietnam, a stability which we can har
ness into effective anti-Communist action without the distractions
of a despot who kept outraging world opinion?
ARE WE INDEED so sure? That is what they said after Syng
man Rhee's ouster from Korea —do you remember him? He too, like
Diem, was revered as the George Washington of his country, but he
too grew despotic and corrupt, and was finally ousted. And what
happened? In the succeeding five years there have been three dif
ferent governments in South Korea, and the current one is giving
us mpst trouble of all.
We will have a more unified effort against the Communists?
But history seems are argue the contrary. One successful coup tends
to be an invitation to other would-be coup-makers. In Latin America
the rule is a coup every couple of years or so: will it be otherwise
in the neo-republic of South Vietnam which has only had one demo
cratic election in its history? (At which it elected Diem as presi
dent?) Or will it be the alternative, of one-man rule? (Rule by one
of the men who murdered a man who was never himself accused
of murdering anyone.)
THERE ARE TWO ways of looking at the Diem regime. The
one way focusses exclusively on its sins (as measured according to
the Western code). It remains a mystery just exactly what they
were, though if Diem did not sin he would proably be the first ruler
since Saint Louis who hasn't. Take the version most scarlet of his
sins, and even then he cannot compare in venality with such other
despotisms—Ceylon's .Burma's, Indonesia's, to name three countries
in the immediate area—against whom no hue and cry is raised. The
second standard calls for focussing on the relative performance of
Diem. As to that, listen to the majority leader of the Senate of the
United States, the Democratic Senator Mike Mansfield, who said of
him the day after he had died that he was "a courageous man." a
"man of integrity," a "great patriot."
But that is not enough these days in the court of public opinion.
He was something else again quite utterly disqualifying. He was a
relentless, undeviating, acting, fighting anti-Communist. That, my
children, is the besetting sin of our time, and few can survive it.
Anti-Communists who unflinchingly support American programs
tend to end up (Diem) with bullets in thei head; or (Rhee) exiled;
or (Chiang) puppetized; or (Salazar) beleaguered. In international
politics, a strong and purposive friendship for this country and its
international purposes tends to lead to what one might call the
American Way of Death.
