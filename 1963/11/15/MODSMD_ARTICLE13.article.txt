UNDERGRADTEACHING
Editor, The Daily:
The editorial accompanying
Professor Hutchinson's abridged
statement did not, I feel, inter
pret his meaning so much as it
tried to mold it into the same
pattern which constructive stu
dent efforts have followed for
the past few years. I do not be
lieve that this does justice to his
arguments.
Although his brief statements
don't express the changes which
they seem to call for, that call
ing is made, and a precedent for
change is presented. The under
graduate must gain the funda
mental knowledge or dogma
necessary to further research,
and the freshman year with its
General Studies requirements at
tempts to lay a broad foundation
for future study. An important
question is whether the present
pattern succeeds or fails.
There may be a few instructors
who are truly interested in th e
basic education of the foundling
student, but on the average the
instructors seem to understand
their role as an inconvenient ob
ligation while continuing their
own advanced study. The T.A.
must, of course, be responsible to
his own study first, and this
seems to be the major drawback
of the T.A. system.
The emphasis on using the
"great men" of a department
purely for graduate and inde
pendent research is a point which
is overworked, but. an under
graduate usually does not come
into contact with these people
until his junior year, and is only
accepted in his role as a student
by them when he shows initia
tive and interest in their fields
of study.
I might suggest a few minor
changes in the present system

and class structure. All instruc
tors have an obligation to teach
certain concepts prescribed by
the course that they are teaching.
The instructor should be made
fully aware of the objectives of
his course, and should at the first
class meeting, if not during the
whole first week, inform the class
of the direction and goals of the
course to be presented. Not only
will the student be given a frame
work on which to base his stud
ies, but also will be given the
opportunity to drop the course
if ho finds that the course ma
terial duplicates present knowl
edge. The student should be am
bitious in this same sense and
approach instructors of difficult
courses, to see if he has the
knowledge necessary to enter the
more advanced field of study.
Directed reading should be en
couraged from at least sopho
more level, preferably from the
second quarter of the freshman
year. I assume that the control
of directed reading groups does
not consume a large fraction of
the time which an instructor
must or should spend on a class
room situation. Therefore, de
partments could allow under
graduates to spend short periods
of time with their "great men"
as advisors to directed studies.
The undergraduate must learn to
interpret and search for knowl
edge independently, and should
not fulfill the role of a tape re
corder in a classroom.
There seems to be a general
assumption that the undergrad
uate does not have the talent or
ability to learn that the graduate
has. Whether this is fact or fancy
I cannot say, but by their dis
criminatory policies, the facul
ties at Stanford do much to keep
this theory alive.
