MISSISSIPPI RITI KNEES
Editor, The Daily:
Having been shot al in the back
woods of Mississippi, (two bullets
slapped into the ground besidemy
car), my neck throbbing, I
slapped into ihe ground beside my
;i twisting country road — away
from a cluster of whites standing
in front of a brown broken coun
try store.
And then, safe in a Negro col
lege dormitory, 1 stopped to re
consider.
For there is actually little vio
lence. "Being shot at" is a privi
lege for visitors only; although in
Mississippi it is the right of every
man who angers a cluster of na
tive whites. There is actually lit
tle violence, only the stony glare
of white hatred, only the dull wax
faces of fear. Little agitation and
enthusiasm, only the proud
threats from sure lips, only th e
dark and numbed voices fumbling
through their unearned ignorance.
No one is afraid except colored
teachers who'll lose their jobs,
colored employees who'll be fired,
farmers who'll have Iheir 1 a n d
taken, young kids who'll be
thrown out of school, business
men who still don't own their
buildings, preachers who'll be
bombed. Everyone, that is. There
is no violence, only fear that cow
ers from any.
A white man in Mississippi's
closed society. Though considered
a foreigner by this society, I was
white and therefore accepted (at
least temporarily I. But as a white
I also entered into Mississippi's
colored society. There I was
feared, welcomed, sometimes re
spected; there I was no James
Meredith. I met the black man
and there were no curses, no
rocks. . . . When I walked in the
old and ragged ghettos, or en
tered an ancient battered Negro
college, its plaster board rooms
neatly arranged and clean, when
ever I encountered a colored man,
I was numbed by a leaden shame
for my race.

Editor, The Daily:
I think that it is finally time
to consider the justification of a
Northerner's intervention in the
racial problem in Mississippi, es
pecially in light of letters such as
Dick Astle's which have appeared
in the Stanford Daily. These
people seem to feel that we have
no right to interfere with the in
ternal problems of Mississippi,
that not having lived in the South
all of our lives, we don't under
stand the situation, and that our
presence in Mississippi is more of
a hindrance to integration than it
is an aid.
In the first place, we do have
a right to interfere in the prob
lems of Mississippi, because what
goes on there is of direct concern
to us. Even if we completely dis
regard the moral issue of segre
gation, the economic and political
complexity of our society involves
every American in the racial cri
sis, whether he likes it or not.
The policy of segregation in Mis
sissippi is responsible for the lack
of development of the potential
abilities of a large portion of our
nation's populace. This inhibits
our nation's productivity, it limits
the consumer base, it leaves many
people who must be given we 1-
fare payments in order to sur
vive, and it narrows the tax base.
Yet, the survival of the country
depends on our maximum use of
our economic resources. This can
not be done until Mississippi ef
fectively educates the Negro, and
properly incorporates him into
the economic system on a basis
of ability and not race.
Politically, segregation is a lia
bility in our affairs with ot her
countries — especially those in
Africa. It reflects a weakness in
the western political system. Also,
Southern senators and representa

tives wield considerable power in
Congress, because they have sen
iority. Their abuse of their power
in their efforts to protect segre
gation have been a continual
mockery of Democracy. Segrega
tionists have continually con
trolled legislation that concerns
the citizens of California. For
example, my children may some
day go to schools of poorer qual
ity than would have been the
case had not segregationists de
feated federal education bills.
Secondly, it is a fallacy to be
lieve that just because a person
lives in the North, he doesn't un
derstand the problems of integra
tion. Almost all of us live in
places where segregation is a
problem. Just because the situa
tion is somewhat less acute in San
Francisco, doesn't mean that Ne
groes are discriminated against
for a different reason here than
they are in Mississippi. Also,
people like Mr. Astle should not
presume that just because we go
to Mississippi, that we are adapt
ing a holier than thou attitude to
ward the people there and claim
ing that there aren't any serious
racial problems where we live.
Thirdly, those of us who went
to Mississippi are not blind to the
fact that you can't legislate true
integration. New York, which has
excellent Civil Rights laws, has a
terrible racial problem. But ibis
is not justification for allowing
i the Negro voting situation in Mis
| sissippi to continue. The fact that
we cannot make a white man love
a black man, is not justification
for permitting the white man to
give impetus to his hate. Fur-
I ther, as I hope my letter in last
: Wednesday's Daily expresses,
i there is no little evidence to sup
port the position of those who be
lieve that the Negroes in Missis
sippi resent the efforts of white
Northerners in trying to secure
this voting right.
Those who went to Mississippi
had every right to do so.

UNJUST UNIVERSE
1 Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Mcßae: I write with regard
to your righteous and self-righte
ous concept of reality. Progress,
which you imply is directly re
: lated to reality, does not neces
sarily mean giving longer and
longer lives to more and more of
humanity. You submit this propo
-1 sition as the first principle of
1 your reality. But we don't live
in "the besl of all possible
worlds." How do you even know
we are moving in the direction of
becoming "the best of all possible
world?' Misery and dissatisfac
tion are not reduced by gleefully
extending the population of th e
world to infinity. Universal good
health and economic security do
not solve all the problems. Indeed,
psychological research and recent
news surveys suggest that the
anxiety of the human individual
has not diminished a bit during
the five or six thousand years
organized mankind ha s been
around.
The universe is not "just" or
"fair" as our understanding of
these words implies -it is "con
tingent" which means that all
things happen by "chance" as our
understanding of ihat word does
imply. We are born by chance,
we live by chance, and we die by
chance — all the while thinking
that our lives are the most ra
tional processions of events which
could possibly occur in any uni
verse. That is the absurd quality
of lile. And that is,what you
ought to try to realize — that
reality embraces the acceptance
of the philosophical principle of
vvhat-is-ism rather than what
should-be-isni. Be happy with
what is really here; quit standing
around wishing for what you
think ought to be here.
