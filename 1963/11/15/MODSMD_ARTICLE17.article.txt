# World Universities Experiment Goal
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL International Student Affairs Editor 
The first of a great number of
world universities — this is the
hope the founders express for
Copenhagen's year-old New Ex
perimental University.
The group feels that "the ex
ploration and development of
man's basic potential through co
operative experimentation on an
intercultural level is imperative
to the achieving of a united
world."
THUS IN ITS three-year found

ing period (1962-65), the College
is engaging in experiments de
signed to determine the necessary
character of a World University,
and is undertaking the prelimi
nary administrative groundwork
for its establishment.
The College is "a cooperative
endeavor intitiated in 1962 by stu
dents and teachers who responded
to an invitation sent to people in
every nation."
In the process of evolving and
programming "an integrated
world curriculum." the College is
acting as a supplementary educa
tional institution. Rather than
duplicating, on a world level, the
efforts of existing institutions,
the College seeks to research "the
fundamental issues which under
lie any educational system, in an
attempt to realize a foundation
upon which universal education
can be built.
IN ORDER TO further their
idea, the founders have sent let
ters to the major leaders of the
world and are planning a Confer
ence on the Exploration and Pro
motion of World Universities. The
meeting, to take place in th e
spring of 1965, will use as a work

ing paper a report compiled by
the College of essays, and s u g •
gestions submitted from people
around the world.
The founding statement of the
College said: "We undertake this
endeavor in l-esponse to our con
viction that contemporary man
has an urgent need for integra
tion of thought and being; that
our world civilization requires the
activation of some common hu
man denominators; and that both
these needs can be met only
through the development of con
fidence in man's ability to grasp
the 'wholes' of experience."
The founders feel a world uni
versity serves to awaken the uni
versal consciousness and they
hope to provide an opportunity
to experience the world as a so
ciety of persons.
Tho rector of the College is
Aage Rosendal Nielsen. The Col
lege is located at Slotcherrensuej
Zi, Vanlose, Copenhagen.

ing paper a report compiled by
the College of essays, and s u g •
gestions submitted from people
around the world.
The founding statement of the
College said: "We undertake this
endeavor in l-esponse to our con
viction that contemporary man
has an urgent need for integra
tion of thought and being; that
our world civilization requires the
activation of some common hu
man denominators; and that both
these needs can be met only
through the development of con
fidence in man's ability to grasp
the 'wholes' of experience."
The founders feel a world uni
versity serves to awaken the uni
versal consciousness and they
hope to provide an opportunity
to experience the world as a so
ciety of persons.
Tho rector of the College is
Aage Rosendal Nielsen. The Col
lege is located at Slotcherrensuej
Zi, Vanlose, Copenhagen.
The first of a great number of
world universities — this is the
hope the founders express for
Copenhagen's year-old New Ex
perimental University.
The group feels that "the ex
ploration and development of
man's basic potential through co
operative experimentation on an
intercultural level is imperative
to the achieving of a united
world."
THUS IN ITS three-year found

ing period (1962-65), the College
is engaging in experiments de
signed to determine the necessary
character of a World University,
and is undertaking the prelimi
nary administrative groundwork
for its establishment.
The College is "a cooperative
endeavor intitiated in 1962 by stu
dents and teachers who responded
to an invitation sent to people in
every nation."
In the process of evolving and
programming "an integrated
world curriculum." the College is
acting as a supplementary educa
tional institution. Rather than
duplicating, on a world level, the
efforts of existing institutions,
the College seeks to research "the
fundamental issues which under
lie any educational system, in an
attempt to realize a foundation
upon which universal education
can be built.
IN ORDER TO further their
idea, the founders have sent let
ters to the major leaders of the
world and are planning a Confer
ence on the Exploration and Pro
motion of World Universities. The
meeting, to take place in th e
spring of 1965, will use as a work
