Selection of students to go
abroad next summer on the Peo
ple-to-People Program will begin
in the next two weeks, according
Stanford's Chapter.
The purpose of this program is
to provide a number of inter
ested and qualified students a
look into the European commu
nity deeper than is possible for
the usual American tourist, he
said. Its goal is "to increase un
derstanding between European
and American people by arrang
ing for well-prepared American
students to stay several days
with European families."
Besides arranging home-stays,
People-to-People also furnishes
details on many of the cultural
events taking place in Europe
during the summer, provides
travel information and very inex
pensive trans-Atlantic transport.
Stanford's group of about 50
students, both garduate and un
dergraduate, will be selected by
the middle of Winter Quarter.
Orientation in Winter Quarter is
informal, involving meetings with
last summer's group, foreign stu
dents, and professors. Spring
Quarter's orientation is more
formal and will be followed by a
three-day orientation in Wash
ington, D.C.
The cost of the summer's pro
gram for the individual student
is as little as $600, including
transportation, although to go on
a charter flight a student must
have been a member of People
to-People for 6 months.
All students who participated iti
last summer's program will be
available to answer questions at
a reception and party Friday at
7:30 p.m. in Tresidder Main
Lounge.
