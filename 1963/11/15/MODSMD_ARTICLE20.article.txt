### 
A group of Stanford-in-France
students last week organized an
information and collection booth
for the Mississippi mock vote.
Their table was located outside
tho Tours "Restaurant Universi
taire," a restaurant serving local
French students as woil as Stan
ford-in-France students.
The Stanford-in-France students'
lable bore a sign which read
"Votre Occasion de Temoigner
Vos Sentiments del'lntegration a
l'ctat do Mississippi." A mimeo
graphed sheet was handed out —
written in French—on "The Ne
gro Problem in the United States."
THE STANFORD IN FRANC E
group acted immediately upon re
ceipt of Dailies covering the
Aaron Henry for Governor cam
paign.
The sheet explains the mock
election, and states "The result is
going to show to the rest of the
world the power of the black
vote." The activities of Stanford
and Yale students are noted, and
the French contigent goes on to
say, ". . . the students of Stan
ford-in-France, your neighbors,
after having given all that they
can, invite you to participate in
their effort and express thereby
the solidarity of French youth
with these people deprived of
rights of citizenship. . . ."
