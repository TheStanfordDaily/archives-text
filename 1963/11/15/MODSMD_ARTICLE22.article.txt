# Goldwater Committee Organized
## 
### 
The formation of Ihe Stanford
Goldwater for President Com
mittee was announced today by
Martin Gibson, chairman. Gibson,
a Democrat and a senior political
science major, is former head of
the Stanford Student Police and
is currently a LASSU rerpesen
tative.
He expressed the belief that
the Goldwater drive would attract
support from all voters —Demo-
crat, Republican, and Independ
ent. Me said that the Stanford
Goldwater Committee welcomes
support from all these groups.
The purpose of the committee,
Gibson said, will be two-fold
"First, if we are to elicit support
for Goldwater's candidacy, we
must acquaint as many people as
possible with his views.
"We feel that among students

j and voters there is oflen a lack
I of complete familiarity with the
| legitimate conservative position;
and we seek inquiry and debate
| from all sides in an effort to
| clarify any misunderstanding of
j the Senator's posiiton.
"Second," Gibson, continued,
"we must win the California pri
! mary for Goldwater so that Cali
| fomia's delegates to the Republi
j can National Convention will be
| pledged to Goldwater." Gibson
| stressed that the California pri
mary is by no means won, al
though Goldwater presently has
a "substantial lead."
These goals will be imple
mented by the committee in two
ways. Members of the commit
tee will contact the various living
groups on campus to discuss in
formally the Goldwater move
ment. At this time they hope to
talk with as many students as
possible and to explain their rea
sons for supporting his candidacy.
The campus organization will
also be doing primary campaign
work in conjunction with the of
ficial ca m p a i g n organization
headed by former Senator Wil
liam F. Knowland. This will in
clude precinct organization and
arrangements for campaign activ
ities in the surrounding area.
Athough Gibson is a registered
Democrat, he emphasized that the
committee is in no way tied to
any partisan group. The exec
utive secretary is Barbara West
erlund, former president of the
Stanford Area Young Republic
ans. Treasurer is Darryl Wold, a
first-year law student from Ari
zona.
"Goldwater is the strongest
candidate against President Ken
nedy in 1964," Gibson said. The
latest poll by Lou Harris of News
week magazine shows Goldwater
ahead of all other prospective
candidates in every section of the
country, including the East,
thought by many to be his weak- j
est area.
The Stanford Goldwater forj
President Committee announced a
charter membership of 40 stu
dents, but expressed the desire
to enlist as large a membership
as possible. Everyone favoring the
nomination of Senator Goldwater
is urged to join. Those interested
can write to P.O. Box 5074, Stan
ford, or contact executive secre
tary Barbara Westerlund at 326-
2200.

ment. At this time they hope to
talk with as many students as
possible and to explain their rea
sons for supporting his candidacy.
The campus organization will
also be doing primary campaign
work in conjunction with the of
ficial ca m p a i g n organization
headed by former Senator Wil
liam F. Knowland. This will in
clude precinct organization and
arrangements for campaign activ
ities in the surrounding area.
Athough Gibson is a registered
Democrat, he emphasized that the
committee is in no way tied to
any partisan group. The exec
utive secretary is Barbara West
erlund, former president of the
Stanford Area Young Republic
ans. Treasurer is Darryl Wold, a
first-year law student from Ari
zona.
"Goldwater is the strongest
candidate against President Ken
nedy in 1964," Gibson said. The
latest poll by Lou Harris of News
week magazine shows Goldwater
ahead of all other prospective
candidates in every section of the
country, including the East,
thought by many to be his weak- j
est area.
The Stanford Goldwater forj
President Committee announced a
charter membership of 40 stu
dents, but expressed the desire
to enlist as large a membership
as possible. Everyone favoring the
nomination of Senator Goldwater
is urged to join. Those interested
can write to P.O. Box 5074, Stan
ford, or contact executive secre
tary Barbara Westerlund at 326-

Stanford-in-Germany
for Goldwater
The formation of Ihe Stanford
Goldwater for President Com
mittee was announced today by
Martin Gibson, chairman. Gibson,
a Democrat and a senior political
science major, is former head of
the Stanford Student Police and
is currently a LASSU rerpesen
tative.
He expressed the belief that
the Goldwater drive would attract
support from all voters —Demo-
crat, Republican, and Independ
ent. Me said that the Stanford
Goldwater Committee welcomes
support from all these groups.
The purpose of the committee,
Gibson said, will be two-fold
"First, if we are to elicit support
for Goldwater's candidacy, we
must acquaint as many people as
possible with his views.
"We feel that among students

j and voters there is oflen a lack
I of complete familiarity with the
| legitimate conservative position;
and we seek inquiry and debate
| from all sides in an effort to
| clarify any misunderstanding of
j the Senator's posiiton.
"Second," Gibson, continued,
"we must win the California pri
! mary for Goldwater so that Cali
| fomia's delegates to the Republi
j can National Convention will be
| pledged to Goldwater." Gibson
| stressed that the California pri
mary is by no means won, al
though Goldwater presently has
a "substantial lead."
These goals will be imple
mented by the committee in two
ways. Members of the commit
tee will contact the various living
groups on campus to discuss in
formally the Goldwater move
ment. At this time they hope to
talk with as many students as
possible and to explain their rea
sons for supporting his candidacy.
The campus organization will
