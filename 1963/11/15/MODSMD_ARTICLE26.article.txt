# Stanford Heavy Favorite to End Skid
## 
### TOM ELIAS 
Stanford's Indians are nvelvo
point favorites tomorrow after
noon at Stanford Stadium to whip
the Washington State Cougars, a
team that they have not beaten
in their previous six meetings.
The odds-makers choice of the
Tribe seems even more improb
able in view of the fact that the
Indians have lost two straight
since their upset conquest of
Notre Dame and ihe fact t hat
they can't help looking ahead to
next week's Big Game.
Coach Jim Sutherland's squad
comes to the Farm with a rather
mediocre 2-5-1 mark, still a little
better that Stanford's 2-6. The
Cougars' lone tie, additionally
came against Big Ten powerhouse
lowa, conquerors of Rose Bowl
bound Washington.
The WSU attack, impotent as it
has generally been this season,
does boast several top-notch per-

I formers. Foremost of these has
been halfback Clarence Williams,
a speedster who started the sea
son on the second string, but after
State's top back, Ken Graham,
! was injured in the Cougars' open
er and put out of action for the
season, took over the first string
job averaging over five yards per
cary with a 416 yard total.
Quarterback Dave Mathieson,
; somewhat disappointing to WSU
this season, has nonetheles man
aged to complete 79 passes total
ing over 900 yards. Sophomore
Tom Roth has seen more and
more action in the signal-calling
slot as the season has progressed.
Top receivers for the Cougars j
have been flanker Gerry Shaw |
' and end Dennis Kloke, just now j
: returning to action after an en
forced three week absence due!
to a broken hand.
Stanford once again is healthy i
for this game, having taken:
nothing more than a few bumps

and bruises in last week's loss to
Southern Cal.

The WSU attack, impotent as it
has generally been this season,
does boast several top-notch per-

I formers. Foremost of these has
been halfback Clarence Williams,
a speedster who started the sea
son on the second string, but after
State's top back, Ken Graham,
! was injured in the Cougars' open
er and put out of action for the
season, took over the first string
job averaging over five yards per
cary with a 416 yard total.
Quarterback Dave Mathieson,
; somewhat disappointing to WSU
this season, has nonetheles man
aged to complete 79 passes total
ing over 900 yards. Sophomore
Tom Roth has seen more and
more action in the signal-calling
slot as the season has progressed.
Top receivers for the Cougars j
have been flanker Gerry Shaw |
' and end Dennis Kloke, just now j
: returning to action after an en
forced three week absence due!
to a broken hand.
Stanford once again is healthy i
for this game, having taken:
nothing more than a few bumps

and bruises in last week's loss to
Southern Cal.
The lineups:

Stanford's Indians are nvelvo
point favorites tomorrow after
noon at Stanford Stadium to whip
the Washington State Cougars, a
team that they have not beaten
in their previous six meetings.
The odds-makers choice of the
Tribe seems even more improb
able in view of the fact that the
Indians have lost two straight
since their upset conquest of
Notre Dame and ihe fact t hat
they can't help looking ahead to
next week's Big Game.
Coach Jim Sutherland's squad
comes to the Farm with a rather
mediocre 2-5-1 mark, still a little
better that Stanford's 2-6. The
Cougars' lone tie, additionally
came against Big Ten powerhouse
lowa, conquerors of Rose Bowl
bound Washington.
