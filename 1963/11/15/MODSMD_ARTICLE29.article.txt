A Rumanian referee, a Lai in
water-polo team awl Coach J i m
Gaughran's Stanford water-polo
ists will tangle tonight at 8:00
p.m. in the Card pool. Club Comu
nicaciones, the Argentine national
champion water polo team from
Beunes Aires, consists basically of
the same players who came in
third in the last Pan American
games.
The team is presently touring
the United States. They have

played Inland, Commerce, and El
Segundo in the south and San
Jose on their northern swing. So
far they are vvinless but it must
be noted that the three southern
California teams they have played
are probably the best water-polo
clubs in the country. The loss to
San Jose followed an eighteen
hour trip from Los Angeles.
THE GAMK will he extremely
interesting to watch. International
rules will be followed. Under these
rules a player is allowed an un
limited number of fouls. He can,
however be thrown out of the
game for excessive fouling. All
the games Argentina has played
so far have been very rough. With
the scrappers on the Stanford
team, i.e., Don Buehler, and Bill
Lorton, fans attending the game
should be provided with plenty
of action.
Admission to the game will be
fifty cents. All proceeds go to pay
the expenses of the Argentina
team.
