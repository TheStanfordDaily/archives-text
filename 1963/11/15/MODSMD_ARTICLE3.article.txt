opinion magazine, will speak to
night at 7:30 p.m. in the Pavilion
on "The Liberal Ideology and U.S.
Foreign Policy."
Buckley will discuss such ques
tions as "Why can't we make any
headway against the Soviet
Union? What are some of the
liberal premises that keep us
from acting effectively in world
crises? And what is the ultimate
meaning of liberalism in our
struggle with the Soviet Union?"
A member of the Yale class of
1950, Buckley is the author of
several books, including "God and
Man at Yale," "Up from Liberal
ism," and "McCarthy and His
Enemies." Many regard him as
the most articulate spokesman of

ham. Willmoore Kendall, William

John Dos Passos, Frank Meyer,
and Brent Bozell. The magazine
has, under his supervision,
"sought to revitalize the conserv
ative faith," and has topped the
circulation level of its left-wing

lenging speaker by conservatives,

United States, and on television
and radio programs. He has been
