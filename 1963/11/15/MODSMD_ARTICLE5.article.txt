# Former E. German Leader Warns Of Red Stress on Economic Aims
## 
### DAVID BARNUM Contributing Editor 
In a stimulating and objective presentation
Wednesday evening, Wolfgang Leon hard, former
top East German Communist Party official, ana
lyzed the present Soviet concept of world revolu
tion and the implications of the Sino-Soviet dis
pute.
Beginning with the initial exhortations of Marx
and Engels to permanent and simultaneous revo
lution in highly industrialized societies, Soviet
revolutionary theory, he said has passed through
three subsequent stages. Lenin expanded the con
cept of world revolution to include its possibility
in colonial as well as industrialized societies. Sta
lin, in theory if not in practice, abandoned com
munism's commitment to world revolution. After
193(5. Stalin caused even the term "world revolu
tion" to fall into disuse.
In 1954. Lconhard said, the term reappeared
in the context of a totally new and quite elaborate
Soviet theory of world revolution, which became
obligatory textbook material for all Soviet and
Eastern European school children. According to
the new theory, the triumph of communism is in
evitable. Only the question of means remains.
War and occupation are officially downgraded,
while new emphasis is placed on winning the race
for economic domination of the world by existing
communist states, and thereby gaining converts
to communism by example. The conditions are
sot down under which victorious revolution, pre
ferably peaceful, if possible in industrial societies.
They include sudden increases in poverty, infla
tion. unemployment, etc.
In underdeveloped societies, said Lconhard,
communist parties are encouraged to give uncon
ditional support to any orientations. Lconhard
pointed out that communist support for seemingly
reactionary nationalist movements and leaders
thereby becomes explicable.
Though in many ways unrealistic, Lconhard

warned that this new doctrine is to be taken quite
seriously. No Western society, he observed, has
planned its future so meticulously.
Leonhard fell with respect to Ihe Sino-Soviet
dispute that Western observers are presently so
delighted with its existence they have exaggerated
its importance. It would be better, he said, to
speak of a "general dissension," within the entire
communist movement, of which the Sino-Soviet
rift is merely the most outstanding and symbolic
manifestation.
To illustrate the increasing disintegration of
the movement, he drew a spectrum of party and
state orientations around the world, placing Ihe
Chinese party on the extreme left. Yugoslavia and
the Italian Communist Party on the right, and
Moscow and other Eastern European Bloc coun
tries in the middle. He noted thai many parties
around the world ;ire splitting within themselves
into pro-Peking and pro-Moscow factions.
He concluded bv saying that the West's answer
to the challenge of world communism must be a
solution of its social and economic problems, in
particular those upon which communism intends
to capitalize for revolutionary purposes, rather
than simple domestic witch-hunting.
In answer the questions following his talk, he
characterized the East German regime as among
the weakest, enjoying no more than three or four
percent direct popular support. In view of com
munist tactics, however, he felt there was little
danger of its being overthrown.
Those of us in the West, he said, must not
necessarily assume that the increasing affluence
of the Soviet Union heralds its imminent liberal
ization. On the other hand, he warned, we must
not let our natural and vehement objections to
communism as a political system cause us to ig
nore significant historical changes in its makeup.
"Over-optimism" and "over-pessimism." he eon
eluded, are equally detrimental to a realistic ap
praisal of the future of the world communist
movement.

for economic domination of the world by existing
communist states, and thereby gaining converts
to communism by example. The conditions are
sot down under which victorious revolution, pre
ferably peaceful, if possible in industrial societies.
They include sudden increases in poverty, infla
tion. unemployment, etc.
In underdeveloped societies, said Lconhard,
communist parties are encouraged to give uncon
ditional support to any orientations. Lconhard
pointed out that communist support for seemingly
reactionary nationalist movements and leaders
thereby becomes explicable.
Though in many ways unrealistic, Lconhard

warned that this new doctrine is to be taken quite
seriously. No Western society, he observed, has
planned its future so meticulously.
Leonhard fell with respect to Ihe Sino-Soviet
dispute that Western observers are presently so
delighted with its existence they have exaggerated
its importance. It would be better, he said, to
speak of a "general dissension," within the entire
communist movement, of which the Sino-Soviet
rift is merely the most outstanding and symbolic
manifestation.
To illustrate the increasing disintegration of
the movement, he drew a spectrum of party and
state orientations around the world, placing Ihe
Chinese party on the extreme left. Yugoslavia and
the Italian Communist Party on the right, and
Moscow and other Eastern European Bloc coun
tries in the middle. He noted thai many parties
around the world ;ire splitting within themselves
into pro-Peking and pro-Moscow factions.
He concluded bv saying that the West's answer
to the challenge of world communism must be a
solution of its social and economic problems, in
particular those upon which communism intends
to capitalize for revolutionary purposes, rather
than simple domestic witch-hunting.
In answer the questions following his talk, he
characterized the East German regime as among
the weakest, enjoying no more than three or four
percent direct popular support. In view of com
munist tactics, however, he felt there was little
danger of its being overthrown.
Those of us in the West, he said, must not
necessarily assume that the increasing affluence
of the Soviet Union heralds its imminent liberal
ization. On the other hand, he warned, we must
not let our natural and vehement objections to
communism as a political system cause us to ig
nore significant historical changes in its makeup.
"Over-optimism" and "over-pessimism." he eon
eluded, are equally detrimental to a realistic ap
praisal of the future of the world communist
movement.
In a stimulating and objective presentation
Wednesday evening, Wolfgang Leon hard, former
top East German Communist Party official, ana
lyzed the present Soviet concept of world revolu
tion and the implications of the Sino-Soviet dis
pute.
Beginning with the initial exhortations of Marx
and Engels to permanent and simultaneous revo
lution in highly industrialized societies, Soviet
revolutionary theory, he said has passed through
three subsequent stages. Lenin expanded the con
cept of world revolution to include its possibility
in colonial as well as industrialized societies. Sta
lin, in theory if not in practice, abandoned com
munism's commitment to world revolution. After
193(5. Stalin caused even the term "world revolu
tion" to fall into disuse.
In 1954. Lconhard said, the term reappeared
in the context of a totally new and quite elaborate
Soviet theory of world revolution, which became
obligatory textbook material for all Soviet and
Eastern European school children. According to
the new theory, the triumph of communism is in
evitable. Only the question of means remains.
War and occupation are officially downgraded,
