### ROD PECK 
Last night, acting with little opposition, LASSU approved a reso
lution protesting the American Legion's condemnation of tho Na
tional Student Association because oi alledged Communist infiltra
lion. The resolution was drafted by Rick Sterns, NSA Regional chair
man. and Tom Noel, Stanford NSA co-ordinator. It cited the Amcri

can Legion's charge that NSA
chapters would "leave the door
ajar for the dissemination of Com
munist propaganda which is all
tho Communists desire" was tot
ally unfair and "no ground or
substance can bo found to justify
the serious charges leveled at the
USNSA."
Sterns stated that the American
Legion was considering "any
group which liberally interprets
the principle of academic freedom
as communistic." He further
pointed out that merely because
NSA favors permitting students
j to hear Communist speakers was
not sufficient justification to
I assert that the NSA was Commu
; nist. In substantiation, he read
I statements by President John F.
I Kennedy and the American Dean's
Congress citing the valuable con
j tri but ions made by NSA to Amer
| ican higher education.
The only opposition to the reso
' lution centered around doubts as
i to the effectiveness of LASSIJ's
1 resolution. President Wed in
I stated, "The body's deliberations
! are indeed considered quite close
ly by the appropriate individual's
1 and do afford much leverage," in
S reply to the uncertainty.
Concerning the Daily's request
for funds to meet expenses in
: curred in the coverage of the Mis
sissippi crisis which was tabled
last meeting pending University
action. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor,
withdrew the request because the
funds were needed immediately at
j the time the request was made
| and private contributions had de
| frayed part of the expenses. How
j ever, she stated, "The Legisla
| ture's failure to act immediately
| to meet the sudden need for finan
; cial support was a disgrace. It
j is hoped that expedient assistance
I will be forthcoming in the future
! should a similar need for action
I arise." It was pointed out that
; withdrawing the request was in
| no way obviating the concept of
! asking the Legislature for finan
j cial support in any emergency
I situation as should be the right
i of any ASSU organization. It was
felt that such requests should be
j considered on t he i r financial
: merits only and not considered as
I matters of policy expression.
In other action, a motion from
1 the Academic Affairs Committee
1 to appropriate $462 to keep the
! Main Library open till one a.m.
; during dead week and final week
i was tediously dealt with but
i eventually passed. It was hoped
j that student response will such
I that support from the University
j will be forthcoming in the future.
Also, a questionnaire was dis
| pensed concerning the role of re
| ligion at Stanford to be circulated
! in Hie student body by LASSU
1 members; Clyde Gustaferson and
: Tom Moiser were elected to the
J Men's Council nominating co m-
I mil tee; and LASSU accepted a
j challenge from Cal's Student Sen
ate to a football game Big Game
! morning.
