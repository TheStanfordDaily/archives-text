SHOULD CHRISTIANS EVANGELIZE?
"1.V1.10 111. ART WITH CHRIST A MISSIONARY, I.VI.RV lIK ART WITH
OUT III.ART WITHOUT CHRIST A MISSION MELD"— (Motto Oversea*
Crusades)
Christ e\ln»rts all the members of his universal church to "put on the armour of
Cod" and spread the gospel <>t Christ. Mi'ton shows that this is not an eas\ task.
In Nero's day the Christians were thrown to the lions. Today our adversary is
less direct, but just as effective. While in Roman times a Christian feared tor his
life, today ll a Christian speaks out, he may fear for his reputation. He is often
termed a religious nut hy his friends and subjected to the scorn and derision ol
his peer;.. Tins is a form of mental persecution and is as useful to Satan as pliys'-
ic.il persecution. However, the Bible makes it clear that the only way unsaved i
friends will come to know the Lord is by hearing or reading the Word.
"And lie said unto them, ye into the world and preach the Ciospel to every
even creature. He that helieveth and is baptised shall be saved; but that bc
lieveth noa shall be damned." Mark 16:15-16.
"For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ: ior it is the power ol God unto
salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew tirst and also the Greek. i-Dr |
therein is the rightteousness of God revealed ..." Rom. 1:16-17.
"For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For necessity is
laid upon me. Woe to me it I do not preach the gospel!" I Corinthians 0:16.
"So then faith conieth by hearing, and hearing by the word ol God." Rom. 11:17.
I "For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but onto us
which are saved it is the power of God." I Cor. 1:18.
When we realize that the fate of our unsaved friends is eternal damnation, is it
not terribly important to show our love tor them by speaking out bodly and
telling them of the gospel. They may derive you now. but it God enters their
lives, they will be eternally grateful.
