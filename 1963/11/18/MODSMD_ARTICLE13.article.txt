# Buckley Blasts Liberalism For Lacking Set of Values

### JON ROISE 
"The true meaning of the American light wing is commitment,
a commitment on the basis of which it becomes possible to take
measurements. For those on the radical left, and for so many Ameri
cans on the moderate left, the true meaning of our time is the loss
of an operative set of values."
This was the major idea expressed by William F. Buckley, editor

of "The National Review," in his
speech on "The Liberal Ideology
and U.S. Foreign Policy," deliv
ered at the Stanford Pavilion Fri
day evening. The controversial
spokesman of the conservative
viewpoint talked before an atten
tive and generally receptive audi
ence of about one thousand per
sons.
BUCKLEY concentrated his
opening remarks on an attack
upon the views and character of
Norman Mailer, a proponent of
the radical left wing. He said
that Mailer is unrealistic, and
that "only demonstrations of hu
man swinishness are truly pleas
ing to him."
He then went on to condemn
strongly the liberal policies of
the United States Government,
blaming it for the gains of the
Communist world in the cold
war.
"THE RIGHT wing, which is
so often charged with wishing to
escape from reality, desires in
fact to introduce reality to o u r
ideologized brothers on the left.
Far from fleeing world respon
sibilities. we wish to acknowledge
that the weight of ihe world's
problems does in fact lie squarely
on the shoulders of our leaders
and draw attention to the fact
that our leaders have been losing
the world war. . . . The logic of
our leaders ... is the logic of
defeat." said Buckley.
"It is said of the American
right wing that de do not trust
our leaders. Nothing could be
considered truer. . . . Why our
great retreat from duty? Because
our leaders are unsure, and,
when all is said and done, are
scared."
Buckley concluded with a state
ment of his policy for interna
tional affairs. "It is implied that
the right wing seeks a war, but
in fact we seek to avoid war, and
the surest way to avoid war is
to assert our willingness to wage
it.
"TO WIN, it will take nerve
and take courage and take a cer
tain kind of humility: humility
that makes man acknowledge the
demands of duty. But it takes
also a quiet and unshakeable
pride, the pride of knowing that
with all its faults, with all its
grossness, with all its appaling
injustices, great and small, we
live here in the West under a
small light, while over there
is blackness, total and impene
trable. We of the right wing seek
to serve the cause of human lib
erty."
