# Buckley Hits Role of NSA
## 
### ALLAN C. ANDERSON Contributing Editor 
William F. Buckley Jr., noted
conservative spokesman and writ
er. questioned the role of the
NSA as a representative voice of
American student opinion and ex
pressed support for the goals and
ideas of the Winds of Freedom
Foundation, in an interview with
the Daily last Friday.
"CONSERVATISM," he stated,
"is growing on college campuses
all across the United States." He
attributed this growth to stu
dents' having "seen the fantastic
inadequacies of modern liberal
ism."
Discussing the recent condem
nation of the National Student
Association by the American
Legion. Buckley stated that al
though he noted a "heavy left
ward bias in the NSA. he felt the
Legion's use of the word "commu
nist" was incorrect. Buckley also
expressed the belief that the NSA
is not truly representative of the
opinions of American students.
BUCKLEY AFFIRMED his
belief that students "ought to be
allowed to speak out on important
national and international prob
lems." He pointed out. however,
that student leaders should not
"seek to speak for the entire stu
dent body." He stated that "stu
dent councils should not have
continuing power" to speak out
as the voice of the student body
and "ought not to have the power
to commit the entire student
body."
"Student newspapers," Buckley
continued, "ought not to present
themselves as representative of
student opinion." He stated that
although be believed that editors
should have "complete license"
in expressing themselves, he felt
that they should make it clear
that the opinions expressed are
their own and not necessarily
those of their fellow students.
BUCKLEY EXPRESSED ap
proval of the Winds of Freedom
Foundation which has been or
ganized by Stanford alumni in
order to promote the teaching of
a more conservative point of
view. The University has not as
yet accepted any gifts from this
group. Buckley attributed this
refusal not to the fact that
strings would be attached to the
gift but to the fact that the Uni
versity has a need to "know the
strings ahead of time."
For Buckley the question quick
ly boils down to a philosophical
one: What is the fuction of a Uni
versity? Mr. Buckley had some
very definite answers to this
question. "A University," ho said,
"should not be an intellectual
smorgasbord" where all ideas are
set out for the student to choose
from. He stated that a univer
sity's administration "ought to
give some thought to its essential
function" and to the "net value
impact of the education given."
