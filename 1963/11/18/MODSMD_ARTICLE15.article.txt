# The 						Libe vs. the Flicks Our Dual Personality?
## 
### 
The last Legislature meeting indicated a somewhat split
personality on the part of Stanford students. The body's
deliberations 011 two issues—the Stanford Library and the
flicks—could easily be mistaken for Ihe deliberations of two
distinctly separate student bodies.
In light of the Stanford library's inability to remain open
during extended hours over dead week and finals week,
LASSU appropriated a ceiling amount of $462 to be given to
the University. In very rational fashion, the body demanded
analysis of which parts of the library are most needed, and
authorized the necessary funds. The legislators realized the
students could not continue to assume the function of sup
porting the library over several quarters, but operated upon
the belief that the library—however limited it be—will be
granted funds in the future from sources other than the stu
dent legislature in order to extend hours during examination
periods. This concern and action indicated one personality
of the Stanford student.
The second personality came to the fore at the end of the
meeting when Student Financial Manager Ed Shaw spoke
of conduct at the Sunday Evening Flicks. Shaw indicated he
wished to inform the student police that gross disturbances
by a member of the audience should merit his leaving the
auditorium and confiscation of his student body card. LASSU,
with little debbate, accepted the opinion of previous meet
ings, and indicated that Shaw was not to increase disciplinary
action. The opinion expressed was that the flicks exist as a
means of "letting off steam," and the "right" to scream obscen
ties from the balcony is a necessary one. This is indeed a sad
commentary upon a group of theoretically highly intelligent
university students. It is difficult to believe that any signifi
cant number of students can find no way to relax short of
yelling at the film screen on Sunday nights.
Surely the body that answered the University's shocking
deficiency in library budgeting could not be representing the
same students that defend the "balcony tradition" of the Sun
day films.
