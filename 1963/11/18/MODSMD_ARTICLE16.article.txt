## Buckley Way of Distortion 
### HOWARD GARFIELD, Resolutions Chairman, SYD 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: The following article —in reply to William
F. Buckely's "The American Way of Death," which oppeared in
last Friday's Daily—was submitted by Bob Rouka, President of
the Stanford Young Democrats, oil behalf of the SYD Executive
Board.)

Usually Mr. Buckley's flippant irrelevancies, invidious analogies,
glib a«l hominem attacks, red herrings, and fallacious arguments
successfully obscure and drastically oversimplify the issues and facts
of complex problems. This ever-ready wit and the "cute" pain,
though, have failed him in his article, "The American Way of Death."
(The Daily's choice of this particular commentary for publication
was most unfortunate. His comments in it certainly do not justify
the claim made by many Ihat he is a perceptive anrt articulate ob
server of American politics.)
The abuse and distortion of facts in the article is obvious. How
can Mr. Buckley seriously maintain that Diem was one of those
leaders who "unflinchingly support American programs" or that he
was the George Washington of Viot-nam? No man whose death
provides the occasion for national joy and exultation can be called
a George Washington without defaming the memory of a great
hero, nor can any man who refuses to follow expert American mili
tary advice or other advice on the enactment of reforms to promote
the success of the war against the Viet-cong be called an unflinching
supporter of American programs. Does Mr. Buckley really want
to suggest that a man who wantonly persecutes the practitioners
of a religion other than his own is following an American program?
Does he really want us to believe that a man who sanctioned the
most abusive harangues against America and American military
officers by Madame Nhu is "unflinchingly" loyal to American poli
cies? She even went so far as to demand the removal of American
military advisors from the country. Only double-think could make
these facts fit Mr. Buckely's implicit contention that Diem was a
champion of America in Asia.
BIIT MR. BUCKLEY'S carelessness with facts and history is not
the most distressing aspect of his article. It seems that for him any
and all kinds of corruption, persecutions, murder, etc. are excused
by anti-Communism. It is true that the murder of Diem was un-
American as Mr. Buckley puts it. But dictatorship, for any purpose,
is also un-American. Not everything, not every oppression and
tryanny or torture can be excused by anti-Communism. The ends
cannot justify the means.
Now the war against the Viet-cong can be pursued by men who
have the support of the people, by generals who are more concerned
with victory over the Communists than with victory over monks and
nuns and students. Hopefully, we will not now win a war only to
lose a country. America's true purpose is not only to prevent the
spread of Communism but to encourage the growth of democracy.
A democratic anti-Communist is better than an anti-Communist
tyrant. And if the first is not possible, an anti-Communist who is
supported by his people is manifestly better than one who oppresses
them.
