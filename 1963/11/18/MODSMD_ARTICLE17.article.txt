Editor, The Daily:
I have just finished reading the
Oct. 29 issue of The Stanford
Daily, and was rather upset to
learn of the activities of a seg
ment of Stanford students who
participated in a Negro registra
tion drive in Mississippi and of
their efforts to aid the guberna
torial bid of Aaron Henry.
Just what, exactly, can these
students accomplish? Their pres
ence in Mississippi can do nothing
but harm race relations in that
state. If Negroes are being de
nied the right to register to vote
in Mississippi, which they prob
ably are—in some sections—it is
their duty, and the duty of the
federal government to correct
this situation. Students from
Stanford should not interfere
with Mississippi problems; I'm
sure they can find quite a bit to
do in California to aid race rela
tions—with Mexicans, as well as
well as Negroes.
The integration process is slow
in Mississippi, but for there to be
a genuine integration, the people
of Mississippi must handle their
own problems themselves. Out
siders, as we have learned in
South Carolina, never aid racial
harmony, but, instead, reverse
what they set out to do.
Stanford's reformers realize, I
hope, that before racial integra
tion can be attained there must
be an unconscious willingness

j among both races toward accep
| tanee. In the end, all that can be
1 achieved by the activities of these
i students is to deepen racial ani
mosities and suspicions. The ideal
; of freedom from prejudice is fine
; in theory, but difficult sometimes
to practice.
It is often difficult for people
in various sections of the nation
to comprehend the struggle that
is taking place in the South to
day. It is a struggle of both
white and Negro races toward
erasing racial misconceptions
and fears that have existed over
many years. The desegregation
process became a reality on our
campus this fall; we faced the
challenge with the courage and
dignity traditional to South Caro
lina. We found that it was diffi
cult to obey laws which inter
fered with our domestic prob
lems, but we felt much better
that we were able to handle the
problem ourselves—without the
aid of outsiders.
In closing, I note with humor
the campaign conducted by Stan
ford students to elect Aaron
Henry governor of Mississippi.
Certainly, they could have not
been serious. We would be inter
ested to know if these same stu
dents would support Mr. Henry
if he sought the governorship of
California?
