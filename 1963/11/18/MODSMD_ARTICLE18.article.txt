# Stanford Administration Liberal... in Comparison
## 
### MALCOLM MACKENZIE 
Much has been said about the suppression of student freedom al
Stanford by the Administration, but the experiences of a former
Stanford student seem to indicate that Stanford- at least in com
parison with some other large universities is quite liberal in this
respect.
The student in question, Jack Scott, after spending his freshman

and sophomore years at Stanford,
transferred to Syracuse Univer
sity, where he became interested
in the local chapter of (he Con
gress of Racial Equality.
THE TIME CAME when Scott
decided that his convictions dic
tated his participation in a down
town Syracuse CORE "sit-in" j
demonstration, but he first!
checked with the Syracuse dean J
of men to avoid any possible
trouble.
As Scott himself put it in a
personal letter to a Stanford
l'riend, "He (the dean of men)
guaranteed me lhat the univer
sity would take no action against j
any students involved in thej
demonstrations. At least they |
would take no action until the;
civil counts had made their deci- j
sion."
Acting on the strength of this
l'eassuranoe, Scott joined in the
demonstrations and was promptly
arrested. Several days later, be
fore the case had been heard in
court, and in strict defiance of
the earlier promises, Syracuse
University placed Jack Scott on
disciplinary probation— the harsh
est punishment possible short of
expulsion.
The next few weeks, saw this
policy of automatic disciplinary
probation without benefit of
prior court decision extended to
some 80 Syracuse students, who,
like Scott, participated in "sit
ins." The university administra
tion also took action against
twelve faculty members.
WHEN SCOTT attempted to
find out from the dean why the
administration's promises were
so completely at odds with its ac
tions, the dean "was 100 busy to
handle matters like this" and
would not see Scott.
Because of what seemed to
Scott hyprocrisy on the part of
the Syracuse administration he
expressed his protest by w i t h
drawing from Ihe university.
Scott's explanation, quoted in
the student newspaper, the "Daily
Orange," ran this way: "I do not
want to associate with or help
propogate in any manner a school
which has laken the stand Syra
cuse has. Frankly, I would be
ashamed to say I graduated from
Syracuse when this is the way
they operate." .
In an editorial feature, th e
"Daily Orange" deplored th e
" 'don't make waves' attitude of
the administration" towards stu
dents, and praised Scott, who
twice made the Syracuse dean's
list. "Jack Scott's committment
to academic freedom far exceeds
anything that we, the students
and faculty, have mustered. His
actions speak out loudly where
our picketing, petitioning, and
soft protests have only mumbled."
THESE EXPERIENCES con
trast markedly with the policy
of the Stanford Administration to
wards students who went a step
further than local "sit-ins" by tra
veling to Mississippi for the mock
election drive. Rather than being
disciplined, these students .seemed
to be the recipients of implied Ad
ministration support; missed
classes were overlooked, and in
many cases tests were resched
uled for Mississippi-bound stu
dents.
Stanford may have a long way
to go towards true campus fi-ee
dom, but it seems to have a gi
gantic head start on Syracuse.

l'eassuranoe, Scott joined in the
demonstrations and was promptly
arrested. Several days later, be
fore the case had been heard in
court, and in strict defiance of
the earlier promises, Syracuse
University placed Jack Scott on
disciplinary probation— the harsh
est punishment possible short of
expulsion.
The next few weeks, saw this
policy of automatic disciplinary
probation without benefit of
prior court decision extended to
some 80 Syracuse students, who,
like Scott, participated in "sit
ins." The university administra
tion also took action against
twelve faculty members.
WHEN SCOTT attempted to
find out from the dean why the
administration's promises were
so completely at odds with its ac
tions, the dean "was 100 busy to
handle matters like this" and
would not see Scott.
Because of what seemed to
Scott hyprocrisy on the part of
the Syracuse administration he
expressed his protest by w i t h
drawing from Ihe university.
Scott's explanation, quoted in
the student newspaper, the "Daily
Orange," ran this way: "I do not
want to associate with or help
propogate in any manner a school
which has laken the stand Syra
cuse has. Frankly, I would be
ashamed to say I graduated from
Syracuse when this is the way
they operate." .
In an editorial feature, th e
"Daily Orange" deplored th e
" 'don't make waves' attitude of
the administration" towards stu
dents, and praised Scott, who
twice made the Syracuse dean's
list. "Jack Scott's committment
to academic freedom far exceeds
anything that we, the students
and faculty, have mustered. His
actions speak out loudly where
our picketing, petitioning, and
soft protests have only mumbled."
THESE EXPERIENCES con
trast markedly with the policy
of the Stanford Administration to
wards students who went a step
further than local "sit-ins" by tra
veling to Mississippi for the mock
election drive. Rather than being
disciplined, these students .seemed
to be the recipients of implied Ad
ministration support; missed
classes were overlooked, and in
many cases tests were resched
uled for Mississippi-bound stu
dents.
Stanford may have a long way
to go towards true campus fi-ee
dom, but it seems to have a gi
gantic head start on Syracuse.
Much has been said about the suppression of student freedom al
Stanford by the Administration, but the experiences of a former
Stanford student seem to indicate that Stanford- at least in com
parison with some other large universities is quite liberal in this
respect.
The student in question, Jack Scott, after spending his freshman

and sophomore years at Stanford,
transferred to Syracuse Univer
sity, where he became interested
in the local chapter of (he Con
gress of Racial Equality.
THE TIME CAME when Scott
decided that his convictions dic
tated his participation in a down
town Syracuse CORE "sit-in" j
demonstration, but he first!
checked with the Syracuse dean J
of men to avoid any possible
trouble.
As Scott himself put it in a
personal letter to a Stanford
l'riend, "He (the dean of men)
guaranteed me lhat the univer
sity would take no action against j
any students involved in thej
demonstrations. At least they |
would take no action until the;
civil counts had made their deci- j
sion."
