DEMOCRAT VS. GIBSON
Editor, The Daily:
May I respectfully request that
Mr. Martin Gibson, chairman of j
the Stanford Goldwater for Presi
dent Committee, change his reg
istration from Democrat to Re
publican at the earliest possible
date.
In the first place, as a Demo
crat, Gibson will not be able to
vote for Goldwater in the Prim
ary which, I hope, will be the;
first, last, and only time thats
Goldwater's name will appear on j
a California ballot.
Secondly, Mr. Gibson is kidding
himself if he thinks he is a Demo
crat and supports Goldwater.
Nothing could be further from
the truth or reality, and I sug
fest that he join the Party he
desires to support and then turn
sharply to the right before taking
over as chairman of this commit
tee.
—JAMES P. THURBER, JR.
GOODNESS AND MERCY
Editor, The Daily:
Surely good ness and mercy shall
follow me...
Goodnes, evil; together they be
surely now till eternity
Yet is this battle waged like so
Black or white, friend or foe.
Evil surely a common cause
But goodness, look through the
gauze
of Man's professed ideals and see
Goodness, surely a disease
That picks away piece by piece
at man's ageless support to peace
Budd, you fool, you do not see
What you do to evil, you do to me.
—PAUL E. PAL ATT
THE NEW GANDHI
Editor, The Daily:
The Friday issue of the Daily
had an article on the "New Mili
tant Gandhi." The article leaves
a very mistaken impression on
the minds of the readers. It is
really strange that the Indian
masses need the emergence of a
"Gandhi" every now and then to
rouse them and it is still more
strange that it is only "Gandhis" j
who can do the job. It is also I
strange that this "Gandhi" has I
to be Western trained and has to
start his political career with a |
march. I feel that the new "Gand- I
hi" and the whole story about him !
has been given an undue import
ance in The Daily. It is worth
nothing more than a small note
in some corner. The fact that the
"New Gandhi" has attracted huge
crowds at some places does not
by itself tell anything. In an over
populated country with a number
of unemployed people, it is not
difficult to draw a crowd, how
ever insignificant your cause be.
If the things mentioned in th e
article are all true, they tell a
very sad story about the political
consciousness of the Indian
masses—that they need just the
same stimuli today that they had
thirty years back. It is time the
Indian politicians — and particu
larly the younger "Western
tvained" ones—stop these marches
and other such silly things—and
did something more constructive.
The article also says:"The Ma
hat ma's grandson . is uniquely
qualified to lead India." Does
leadership necessarily go by
heredity in a democracy?
