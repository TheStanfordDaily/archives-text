# Fiji, Chappie Entries Win Lag
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
Driving for glory and fun,
twenty-four competitors manipu
lated the treacherous (more to
Ihe cars than the drivers) bumps,
curves and mud of Zeta Psi's
carefully layed-out Lagunita Seca
course Saturday morning and
afternoon in a race that proved
! to be as exciting and colorful an
event as Stanford has seen this
fall.
Cheered on by the overwhelm
ing turnout, Bill Gubelmann,
driving under the auspices of
Chaparral, twice conquered the
magic minute-barrier with his
'63 Austin-Cooper to capture the
j small car division and $15.
VVINNKR OF the stock divi
| sion, was Fiji's '53 Ford "Lag'
Eater" driven by Jerry Lewis. In
I the winning circle, he accepted
from Dean Winbigler the .$25
creek and the new symbol of
Stanford stock car skill, "a very
| tired trophy designed to be in
; the anticipated general condition
of the cars."
Caught on the lake earlier this
term driving their cars, the
; to turn evil into a legitimate and
I gala event. Persistent in their
efforts, they were able to cross
: the two biggest obstacles ap
proval of the Dean and the pur
chase of an adequate, but inex
pensive insurance policy.
Till-: HALF-MILK course con
sisted of numerous turns, a hill,
and a complete loop. Instantane
ous speeds were as high as forty
with the average time for the
fastest cars in the neighborhood
of 30 mph. The small cars slid
very little on the corners, because
! of their maneuverability and
light weight and out raced the
heavy stock cars which bogged
down slightly in the mud.
The hill was the crowd pleas
ing aspect of the course. Most

cars in both divisions went over
the top with all four wheels off
the ground. Drivers had to re
cover in time to make a ninety
degree turn to the right.
Racing began in the morning
with two practice runs followed
by a qualifying race. The top
four small cars and eleven stock
cars graduated into the after
noon's activities.
Drivers made substantial im
provements on their preceding
times. The winning times in the
small and stock were apraximate-
Iv two and five seconds better
than the lowest qualifying times.
SMALL CAK entries included
the Austin-Cooper, a '00 Saab, a
VW, a Jaguar, and a T-Bird.
From the beginning, it was
clearly a duel between the Saab
and the Austin-Cooper.
Scrra's Saab, nicknamed the
"Last Straw," with Jeff Gryn
wald at the helm, set the pace in
the afternoon with a record
1:00.2 effort. Three cars later,
"The Flying Gabeleuod," named
after the most levened of Chap

pip editors, proved that the last
straw is not always the best
straw and took over first place
with a 58.5 official time.
Kli TICJRK'S "Flying Tiger"
replaced the fading as challenger
to the speedy, stripped-down i
"Lag' Easter" in the finals. The
Tiger, which drew number one
position for the big race, had
first chance at the course in the
afternoon, a 106.5.
The only girl contestant was a
game gal from Roble, Monica
"Sieel-nerved" Stevens. Placed in ;
a special division by sympathetic!
Zetes, Monica got a chance to,
navigate the course in the after- j
noon despite a rather poor show-1
ing in the morning (she did, how- :
ever, beat the two entrants from \
Wilbur) and received great plau- !
dits from tho crowd for her ef
fort.
