Five brave young women from
Lagunita Court marched on
Memorial Auditorium at 7:15 last
night singing "Onward Christian
Soldiers and carrying signs pro
testing the showing of the Bridget
Bardot film, "And God Created
Woman."
The girls, who refused to give
their names, said they were from
the "S.U. Morality League" pro
testing "the decline of morality
at Stanford."
When asked what they hoped
to accomplished, one answered,
"Just to protest the showing of
the film." Another added, "We
want to defeat the double stand
ard."
The girls said they got the idea
for the march at dinner. They
donned long stockings and high
necked blouses and marched
through the lines of students wait
ing to enter Memorial Audito
rium.
The signs read, "For Shame,
8.8.." "High Morals, High
Blouses." and"The Stanford Mo
rality League Objects."
