# South African Government Strongly Opposes Students
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL International Student Affairs Editor 
The National Union of South African Students faces probable
ban in the very near future, because of its opposition to the apath--
heid policy of the South African government.
Government criticism of NUSAS has increased in recent months,
a usual prelude to the banning of an organization, according to
South African experts. â™¦

The most recent attacks on
NUSAS was a speech given No
vember 1 by South African Minis
ter of Justice B. J. Vorster to a
Nationalist Party meeting in Pie
termaritzburg.
VORSTER, NCSAS's chi e 112
critic, said that the world is badly
informed about South Africa.
Sometimes the misinforming is
deliberate, he charged. He ac
cused NUSAS of being among
those responsible for sending out
wrong information.
He refuted NUSAS's claim that
that 1962 Sabotage Act made it
an offense of sabotage (and thus
punishable by death) for anyone
to try and bring about any social
or political change in South
Africa.
Such statements are not true,
asserted Vorster, and they be
smirch the good name of South
Africa. "The Act made it abso
lutely clear that capital punish
ment applied only to acts of sabo
tage."
NUSAS President Jonty Driver
replied to Mr. Vorster in a press
release issued November 6 that
(he clause from the General Law
Amendment Act of 1962 headed
"Sabotage" reads: "To further or
encourage the achievement of
any political aim. including the
bringing about of any social or
economic change in the Repub
lic."
DRIVER STATED that "this
further attack seems to indicate
that the Minister of Justice is
going to continue his attempt to
make NUSAS out to be what he
considers it, a "cancer" in the
South African society."
"In particular, he seems intent
on proving, though without re
serve to the courts, that NUSAS
is a communist organization. We
point out once again that NUSAS
is neither anti-communist nor
pro-communist, but non-commu
nist. It is against all forms of
totalitarian government and all
abuses of political power."
The Collegiate Press Associa
tion has discovered that the
English press in South
Africa either defended NUSAS or
was non-commital, few attacked
NUSAS. The Rand Daily Mail
said that the Minister of Justice
was using the same smear tactics
that he had used in the past be
fore taking action against an or
ganization. The first step was to
"warn the country" about its lib
eral orientation. After this soft
ening-up process came the second
phase of the attack: brand the
organization as communistic. The
Daily Mail said:
"Having tagged the 'subversive
label to NUSAS, Vorster is no

doubt confident that there will
be no serious public outcry when
he does act. On this occasion,
however, it is ho{)od that this
smearing tactic will not hood
wink the public and t he thousands
of students who belong to
NUSAS."
The South African government,
according to an English weekly,
is "a heavily-armed military re
gime, backed by a powerful econ
omy. fanatically maintaining its
slave society by increasingly vio
lent means."
Focus '63, a South African
"free news service," verifies
"this is no exaggeration. Where
more than 2,000 people are in pri
son awaiting trial under the
'Anti-Sabotage Law,' where nu
merous prisoners are sentenced
on capital charges without legal
representation, where more than
100 people, including minor chil
dren, are detained uncharged un
der the 90-day clause, slavery and
violence are plain facts."
VORSTER OPENED his attack
late in August, when, addressing
the congress of Jeugbond, a
youth group which supports
apartheid and the Nation Party
government, he warned parents
whose children were at colleges
affiliated with NUSAS that "they
should ask what is going on with
NUSAS and where it is leading
the youth."
"It is high time this warning
was given," he continued, "in the
light of certain developments
which will probably be disclosed
in the course of this year."
During September, the govern
ment continued its campaign
against NUSAS, an d, among
other things, attempted to start
a mass resignation campaign
among the South African stu
dents whose universities belonged
to NUSAS.
(The Daily two weeks ago
quoted the Student Mirror as re
porting a group of students at
Capetown claiming that NUSAS
was neither representative of
South African students nor of
the English-speaking students in
South Africa and that NUSAS
had estranged itself from th e
students by its political activity,
A spokesman for the pro-
NUSAS maiority of the student
body replied that the social suc
cesses of NUSAS were exclusive
ly in the interest of the students.)
The government program, how
ever. was for the most part suc
cessful. At Capetown, where the
campaign was most highly or
ganized, only 150 out of 5,800 stu
dents resigned their NUSAS mem
bership.
Toniorow: The conflict. In*-
tween Vorster aii d NCSAS
heightens as Vorster calls
NCSAS a "Red cancer."
