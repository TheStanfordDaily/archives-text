The newly installed president
of Cornell University Dr. James
A. Perkins, commented on the
j emphasis on research resulting
in the neglect of undergraduates
during a press conference held in
the Minnesota Press Club re
cently.
"A problem that you have at
Minnesota, I'm sine, and a prob
! Icm that we have at Cornell is
, providing adequate education,"
1 Perkins said.
He feels that the two main prob-
I lems are that the "best talent"
I in the faculty does research a n d
! public work overseas, and that
the number of students on big
1 campuses tends to make educa
tion "impersonal and mechani
i cal."
Perkins offered two sugges
tions. They are to decentralize the
versifies and to rely more on inde
pendent study, lie feels the use
of TV solves only the quality
problem by bringing the best in
: structor before more students,
but not the numbers problem.
