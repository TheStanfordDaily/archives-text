# Advance Youth Groups Indicted as Red Front
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
Over one month ago, tho President's Subversive Activities Control
Board (SACB) opened hearings on Attorney General Robert Ken
nedy's petition to label the Advance Youth Organization, an 150-
member, New York student group, as a ."communist front" and thus
make it subject to registration under the provisions of the 1950 In
ternal Security Act (the McCarran Ad ). The hearings mark the first
attempt to take such action against a student or youth group since
1954 when the Labor Youlh League (LYL) was investigated under
similar charges. The LYL fought registration, but the case was
ultimately dropped when the group was forced to disband.
On January 10 of this year, Attorney General Kennedy submitted
his first petition against Advance to SACB, claiming that the youth
organization had been established by tho Communist Party to pro
mote its purposes and to train candidates for party membership.
Kennedy's move immediately re-kindled the fires of what has become
a perennial debate on the constitutionality and philosophical advis
ability of the McCarran Act and its sister statute the Smith Act.
THE MOST BITTERLY contested issue in the Advance case con
troversy involves the use of a "parallelism-of-ideas" criterion to
establish a group as a "communist front." One section of the Mc-
Carren Act, as amended in 1954, provides that SACB shall consider
any organization a "communist front" whose "views and policies
do not deviate from those of the world communist movement."
Those who oppose the Act maintain Hiat this provision alone would
effectively stifle constitutionally-guaranteed freedom of thought
and expression.
In his January petition, Attorney General Kennedy claimed that
Advance policies and views had paralleled those of the Communist
Party in the following six instances: 1. in ". . . opposing the United
States-Japanese security pact . . 2. in ". . . demanding an end
to all nuclear tests by the United States . . 3. in asking for "non
intervention in Cuban affairs and the restoration of diplomatic rela
tions with Cuba, and in protesting the United States blockade of
Cuba in October 1962 . . 4. on ". . . the enforcement of the Mc-
Carran Act and the Smith Act"; 5. ". . . in condemning and opposing
the enactment of certain legislation considered by the Party inimical
to its interests, such as the Universal Military Training and Selec
tive Service Statutes"; and 6. ". . . in advocating the withdrawal of
American Armed Forces from Berlin and urging the United States
to accept the offer of the USSR to 'negotiate on Berlin,' " If the
Attorney General's petition succeeds, Advance will be forced, under
the provisions of the McCarran Act, to register its membership and
report its finances to the Attorney General's office.
In an article on the Advance case, "Communist Viewpoint," which
calls itself "A Youth and Student Publication," commented, ". . .
Clearly, no organization can be held responsible for the positions
of any other organization. . . . How many positions? Does it matter
if a position is taken before or after it is taken by the Communist
Party? These are questions not answered in the McCarran Act.
And the SACB, which is not a court, and not manned by judges, has
been given the power to do something which is forbidden by the
Constitution: to kill organizations, for no organization could meet
the impossible conditions of the McCarran Act."
ON THE OPENING day of the hearing, witness for the prosecu
tion David Wilner, an FBI undercover investigator, testified that
Advance had been founded in 1960 as a direct result of efforts by
members of the Communist Party's National Convention. He alleged,
the "Times" reported, that Advance President Mike Stein was him
self a communist. The "Times" noted that Stein declined to com
ment on Wilner's charge against him, but the article quoted Stein
as defining Advance as "Marxist-oriented."
During the initial hearing, defense attorney Kaufman contended
that Advance endeavored to "ease tensions of the cold war period,"
the "Times" asserted. During her cross-examination, attorney Kauf
man got Wilner to agree that he had never discovered any "acts of
espionage or sabotage or talk about it" or "acts of violence" in his
work with Advance. The "Times" story concluded by reporting that
during the hearing, fifty members of Advance picketed outside carry
ing signs which read. "Robert Kennedy: the Real National Threat
Is Racism."
Whether the "Real National Threat Is Racism" or not would seem
somewhat irrelevant here. But by the same token, Advance, as an
organization and as a point of view, would seem to be essentially
irrelevant in the context of the controvercy which the case has
incited. The fact that Advance has not been demonstrated to be
actively revolutionary is not really the crux of the matter, since the
provisions of the McCarran Act, as both friend and foe admit, ex
tend beyond the need for governmental action "in clear and present
danger."
IN THEIR ESSENCE, the McCarran Act and the Smith Act re
fuse to admit that the Communist Party is a legitimate, indigenous
political organ. Supporters of the Acts maintain that to condone
the belief that the Communist Party represents a discrete and inter
nal expression of political opinion would be to commit ideological
suicide. The opposition to the McCarran and Smith Acts, most not
ably the Communist Party itself, claims that the two statutes are
unconstitutional in their very essence in that they implicitly violate
Constitutional protections of freedom of speech, assembly, and due
process of law.
The McCarran Act was passed, over President Truman's veto,
in 1950 during the height of what has been termed the "McCarthy
Era." Title I of the Act provides that all organizations which SACB
finds to be "communist action," "communist front," or "communist
infiltrated" must register with the Attorney General. The Act de
fines a "communist action organization" as "any organization di
rected, dominated or controlled by the foreign government or for
eign organization, controlling the world communist movement." A
"communist front organization" is "any organization in the United
States which is substantially directed dominated or controlled by a
communist action organization. . . ." According to the Act, a "com
munist infiltrated organization" is "one substantially directed, domi
nated or controlled by an individual or individuals who are, or who
within three years have been actively engaged in giving aid to a
communist action organization, a communist foreign government or
the world communist movement."
Under the McCarran Act, an organization designated as commu
nist must label all its literature, list the numbers of its duplicating
machines, and report its finances to the Attorney General. Those
who register as Communists are denied passports, and specified
defense jobs. A "communist infiltrated" union is denied the right
of collective bargaining. In addition, Title II of the Act empowers
the President, under certain conditions, to declare an "Internal Secur
ity Emergency." In such an event, the Attorney General is author
ized to detain those in "whom there is reasonable ground to believe
that (they) . . . probably will engage in or . . . conspire to engage
in acts of espionage or sabotage. . .
THE McCARRAN ACT was fought in the courts for eleven years
by the Communist Party. Then, in 1953, SACB ordered the Commu
nist Party to register. This order was contested in litigation for
several more years. Finally, in 1961, the US Supreme Court voted
sto 4 to uphold the SACB order. In his dissenting opinion, Justice
Black noted, "In my judgment, Ihe act here under consideration is
unconstitutional on at least three grounds in addition to its direct
conflict with the self-incrimination provisions of the Fifth Amend
ment. . . ."
On the same day it ruled on the McCarran Act case, the Supreme
Court voted to uphold the Smith Act which makes it a criminal
offense to belong to an organization which advocates the overthrow
of the government. The test case involved one Junius Scales who
had been indicted under the Smith Act because of his membership
in the Communist Party. Hence, the court set a precedent enabling
the government to prosecute those who register under the provisions
of the McCarran Act on charges as provided by the Smith Act.
The McCarran and Smith Acts, working together, clearly repre
sent an attempt to legislate American Communism out of existence.
The supporters of the Acts admit as much but stress that there is
no difference in the aims, the objectives, or, ultimately, the methods
of the Russian and American Communist Parties. John J. Apt, at
torney for the Communist Party in McCarran Act Litigation, states
the opposing position in his pamphlet "Now Is The Time For All
Good Men to Come to the Aid of Their Country": "This provision
requires the Communist Party to defame itself calling itself some
thing that it doesn't believe it isâ€”a 'communist organization,' which
the Act defines as a seditious conspirator."
President Truman, in his veto of the 1950 Act, seems to come to
terms with the underlying conviction of those who oppose the in
vestigation of Advance under the provisions of the McCarran Act.
In part, he commented, "Once a government is committed to the
principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way
to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures,
until it becames a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a
country where everyone lives in fear."

finds to be "communist action," "communist front," or "communist
infiltrated" must register with the Attorney General. The Act de
fines a "communist action organization" as "any organization di
rected, dominated or controlled by the foreign government or for
eign organization, controlling the world communist movement." A
"communist front organization" is "any organization in the United
States which is substantially directed dominated or controlled by a
communist action organization. . . ." According to the Act, a "com
munist infiltrated organization" is "one substantially directed, domi
nated or controlled by an individual or individuals who are, or who
within three years have been actively engaged in giving aid to a
communist action organization, a communist foreign government or
the world communist movement."
Under the McCarran Act, an organization designated as commu
nist must label all its literature, list the numbers of its duplicating
machines, and report its finances to the Attorney General. Those
who register as Communists are denied passports, and specified
defense jobs. A "communist infiltrated" union is denied the right
of collective bargaining. In addition, Title II of the Act empowers
the President, under certain conditions, to declare an "Internal Secur
ity Emergency." In such an event, the Attorney General is author
ized to detain those in "whom there is reasonable ground to believe
that (they) . . . probably will engage in or . . . conspire to engage
in acts of espionage or sabotage. . .
THE McCARRAN ACT was fought in the courts for eleven years
by the Communist Party. Then, in 1953, SACB ordered the Commu
nist Party to register. This order was contested in litigation for
several more years. Finally, in 1961, the US Supreme Court voted
sto 4 to uphold the SACB order. In his dissenting opinion, Justice
Black noted, "In my judgment, Ihe act here under consideration is
unconstitutional on at least three grounds in addition to its direct
conflict with the self-incrimination provisions of the Fifth Amend
ment. . . ."
On the same day it ruled on the McCarran Act case, the Supreme
Court voted to uphold the Smith Act which makes it a criminal
offense to belong to an organization which advocates the overthrow
of the government. The test case involved one Junius Scales who
had been indicted under the Smith Act because of his membership
in the Communist Party. Hence, the court set a precedent enabling
the government to prosecute those who register under the provisions
of the McCarran Act on charges as provided by the Smith Act.
The McCarran and Smith Acts, working together, clearly repre
sent an attempt to legislate American Communism out of existence.
The supporters of the Acts admit as much but stress that there is
no difference in the aims, the objectives, or, ultimately, the methods
of the Russian and American Communist Parties. John J. Apt, at
torney for the Communist Party in McCarran Act Litigation, states
the opposing position in his pamphlet "Now Is The Time For All
Good Men to Come to the Aid of Their Country": "This provision
requires the Communist Party to defame itself calling itself some
thing that it doesn't believe it isâ€”a 'communist organization,' which
the Act defines as a seditious conspirator."
President Truman, in his veto of the 1950 Act, seems to come to
terms with the underlying conviction of those who oppose the in
vestigation of Advance under the provisions of the McCarran Act.
In part, he commented, "Once a government is committed to the
principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way
to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures,
until it becames a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a
country where everyone lives in fear."
Over one month ago, tho President's Subversive Activities Control
Board (SACB) opened hearings on Attorney General Robert Ken
nedy's petition to label the Advance Youth Organization, an 150-
member, New York student group, as a ."communist front" and thus
make it subject to registration under the provisions of the 1950 In
ternal Security Act (the McCarran Ad ). The hearings mark the first
attempt to take such action against a student or youth group since
1954 when the Labor Youlh League (LYL) was investigated under
similar charges. The LYL fought registration, but the case was
ultimately dropped when the group was forced to disband.
On January 10 of this year, Attorney General Kennedy submitted
his first petition against Advance to SACB, claiming that the youth
organization had been established by tho Communist Party to pro
mote its purposes and to train candidates for party membership.
Kennedy's move immediately re-kindled the fires of what has become
a perennial debate on the constitutionality and philosophical advis
ability of the McCarran Act and its sister statute the Smith Act.
THE MOST BITTERLY contested issue in the Advance case con
troversy involves the use of a "parallelism-of-ideas" criterion to
establish a group as a "communist front." One section of the Mc-
Carren Act, as amended in 1954, provides that SACB shall consider
any organization a "communist front" whose "views and policies
do not deviate from those of the world communist movement."
Those who oppose the Act maintain Hiat this provision alone would
effectively stifle constitutionally-guaranteed freedom of thought
and expression.
In his January petition, Attorney General Kennedy claimed that
Advance policies and views had paralleled those of the Communist
Party in the following six instances: 1. in ". . . opposing the United
States-Japanese security pact . . 2. in ". . . demanding an end
to all nuclear tests by the United States . . 3. in asking for "non
intervention in Cuban affairs and the restoration of diplomatic rela
tions with Cuba, and in protesting the United States blockade of
Cuba in October 1962 . . 4. on ". . . the enforcement of the Mc-
Carran Act and the Smith Act"; 5. ". . . in condemning and opposing
the enactment of certain legislation considered by the Party inimical
to its interests, such as the Universal Military Training and Selec
tive Service Statutes"; and 6. ". . . in advocating the withdrawal of
American Armed Forces from Berlin and urging the United States
to accept the offer of the USSR to 'negotiate on Berlin,' " If the
Attorney General's petition succeeds, Advance will be forced, under
the provisions of the McCarran Act, to register its membership and
report its finances to the Attorney General's office.
In an article on the Advance case, "Communist Viewpoint," which
calls itself "A Youth and Student Publication," commented, ". . .
Clearly, no organization can be held responsible for the positions
of any other organization. . . . How many positions? Does it matter
if a position is taken before or after it is taken by the Communist
Party? These are questions not answered in the McCarran Act.
And the SACB, which is not a court, and not manned by judges, has
been given the power to do something which is forbidden by the
Constitution: to kill organizations, for no organization could meet
the impossible conditions of the McCarran Act."
ON THE OPENING day of the hearing, witness for the prosecu
tion David Wilner, an FBI undercover investigator, testified that
Advance had been founded in 1960 as a direct result of efforts by
members of the Communist Party's National Convention. He alleged,
the "Times" reported, that Advance President Mike Stein was him
self a communist. The "Times" noted that Stein declined to com
ment on Wilner's charge against him, but the article quoted Stein
as defining Advance as "Marxist-oriented."
During the initial hearing, defense attorney Kaufman contended
that Advance endeavored to "ease tensions of the cold war period,"
the "Times" asserted. During her cross-examination, attorney Kauf
man got Wilner to agree that he had never discovered any "acts of
espionage or sabotage or talk about it" or "acts of violence" in his
work with Advance. The "Times" story concluded by reporting that
during the hearing, fifty members of Advance picketed outside carry
ing signs which read. "Robert Kennedy: the Real National Threat
Is Racism."
Whether the "Real National Threat Is Racism" or not would seem
somewhat irrelevant here. But by the same token, Advance, as an
organization and as a point of view, would seem to be essentially
irrelevant in the context of the controvercy which the case has
incited. The fact that Advance has not been demonstrated to be
actively revolutionary is not really the crux of the matter, since the
provisions of the McCarran Act, as both friend and foe admit, ex
tend beyond the need for governmental action "in clear and present
danger."
IN THEIR ESSENCE, the McCarran Act and the Smith Act re
fuse to admit that the Communist Party is a legitimate, indigenous
political organ. Supporters of the Acts maintain that to condone
the belief that the Communist Party represents a discrete and inter
nal expression of political opinion would be to commit ideological
suicide. The opposition to the McCarran and Smith Acts, most not
ably the Communist Party itself, claims that the two statutes are
unconstitutional in their very essence in that they implicitly violate
Constitutional protections of freedom of speech, assembly, and due
process of law.
The McCarran Act was passed, over President Truman's veto,
in 1950 during the height of what has been termed the "McCarthy
Era." Title I of the Act provides that all organizations which SACB

"communist front organization" is "any organization in the United
States which is substantially directed dominated or controlled by a
communist action organization. . . ." According to the Act, a "com
munist infiltrated organization" is "one substantially directed, domi
nated or controlled by an individual or individuals who are, or who
within three years have been actively engaged in giving aid to a
communist action organization, a communist foreign government or
the world communist movement."
Under the McCarran Act, an organization designated as commu
nist must label all its literature, list the numbers of its duplicating

In an article on the Advance case, "Communist Viewpoint," which
calls itself "A Youth and Student Publication," commented, ". . .
Clearly, no organization can be held responsible for the positions
of any other organization. . . . How many positions? Does it matter
if a position is taken before or after it is taken by the Communist

And the SACB, which is not a court, and not manned by judges, has
been given the power to do something which is forbidden by the
Constitution: to kill organizations, for no organization could meet
the impossible conditions of the McCarran Act."
ON THE OPENING day of the hearing, witness for the prosecu
tion David Wilner, an FBI undercover investigator, testified that
Advance had been founded in 1960 as a direct result of efforts by
members of the Communist Party's National Convention. He alleged,
the "Times" reported, that Advance President Mike Stein was him
self a communist. The "Times" noted that Stein declined to com
ment on Wilner's charge against him, but the article quoted Stein
as defining Advance as "Marxist-oriented."
During the initial hearing, defense attorney Kaufman contended
that Advance endeavored to "ease tensions of the cold war period,"
the "Times" asserted. During her cross-examination, attorney Kauf
man got Wilner to agree that he had never discovered any "acts of
espionage or sabotage or talk about it" or "acts of violence" in his
work with Advance. The "Times" story concluded by reporting that
during the hearing, fifty members of Advance picketed outside carry
ing signs which read. "Robert Kennedy: the Real National Threat
Is Racism."
Whether the "Real National Threat Is Racism" or not would seem
somewhat irrelevant here. But by the same token, Advance, as an
organization and as a point of view, would seem to be essentially
irrelevant in the context of the controvercy which the case has
incited. The fact that Advance has not been demonstrated to be
actively revolutionary is not really the crux of the matter, since the
provisions of the McCarran Act, as both friend and foe admit, ex
tend beyond the need for governmental action "in clear and present
danger."
IN THEIR ESSENCE, the McCarran Act and the Smith Act re
fuse to admit that the Communist Party is a legitimate, indigenous
political organ. Supporters of the Acts maintain that to condone
the belief that the Communist Party represents a discrete and inter
nal expression of political opinion would be to commit ideological
suicide. The opposition to the McCarran and Smith Acts, most not
ably the Communist Party itself, claims that the two statutes are
unconstitutional in their very essence in that they implicitly violate
Constitutional protections of freedom of speech, assembly, and due
process of law.
The McCarran Act was passed, over President Truman's veto,
in 1950 during the height of what has been termed the "McCarthy
Era." Title I of the Act provides that all organizations which SACB
finds to be "communist action," "communist front," or "communist
infiltrated" must register with the Attorney General. The Act de
fines a "communist action organization" as "any organization di
rected, dominated or controlled by the foreign government or for
eign organization, controlling the world communist movement." A
"communist front organization" is "any organization in the United
States which is substantially directed dominated or controlled by a
communist action organization. . . ." According to the Act, a "com
munist infiltrated organization" is "one substantially directed, domi
nated or controlled by an individual or individuals who are, or who
within three years have been actively engaged in giving aid to a
communist action organization, a communist foreign government or
the world communist movement."
Under the McCarran Act, an organization designated as commu
nist must label all its literature, list the numbers of its duplicating
machines, and report its finances to the Attorney General. Those
who register as Communists are denied passports, and specified
defense jobs. A "communist infiltrated" union is denied the right
of collective bargaining. In addition, Title II of the Act empowers
the President, under certain conditions, to declare an "Internal Secur
ity Emergency." In such an event, the Attorney General is author
ized to detain those in "whom there is reasonable ground to believe
that (they) . . . probably will engage in or . . . conspire to engage
in acts of espionage or sabotage. . .
THE McCARRAN ACT was fought in the courts for eleven years
by the Communist Party. Then, in 1953, SACB ordered the Commu
nist Party to register. This order was contested in litigation for
several more years. Finally, in 1961, the US Supreme Court voted
sto 4 to uphold the SACB order. In his dissenting opinion, Justice
Black noted, "In my judgment, Ihe act here under consideration is
unconstitutional on at least three grounds in addition to its direct
conflict with the self-incrimination provisions of the Fifth Amend
ment. . . ."
On the same day it ruled on the McCarran Act case, the Supreme
Court voted to uphold the Smith Act which makes it a criminal
offense to belong to an organization which advocates the overthrow
of the government. The test case involved one Junius Scales who
had been indicted under the Smith Act because of his membership
in the Communist Party. Hence, the court set a precedent enabling
the government to prosecute those who register under the provisions
of the McCarran Act on charges as provided by the Smith Act.
The McCarran and Smith Acts, working together, clearly repre
sent an attempt to legislate American Communism out of existence.
The supporters of the Acts admit as much but stress that there is
no difference in the aims, the objectives, or, ultimately, the methods
of the Russian and American Communist Parties. John J. Apt, at
torney for the Communist Party in McCarran Act Litigation, states
the opposing position in his pamphlet "Now Is The Time For All
Good Men to Come to the Aid of Their Country": "This provision
requires the Communist Party to defame itself calling itself some
thing that it doesn't believe it isâ€”a 'communist organization,' which
the Act defines as a seditious conspirator."
President Truman, in his veto of the 1950 Act, seems to come to
terms with the underlying conviction of those who oppose the in
vestigation of Advance under the provisions of the McCarran Act.
In part, he commented, "Once a government is committed to the
principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way
to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures,
until it becames a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a
country where everyone lives in fear."
Over one month ago, tho President's Subversive Activities Control
Board (SACB) opened hearings on Attorney General Robert Ken
nedy's petition to label the Advance Youth Organization, an 150-
member, New York student group, as a ."communist front" and thus
make it subject to registration under the provisions of the 1950 In
ternal Security Act (the McCarran Ad ). The hearings mark the first
attempt to take such action against a student or youth group since
1954 when the Labor Youlh League (LYL) was investigated under
similar charges. The LYL fought registration, but the case was
ultimately dropped when the group was forced to disband.
On January 10 of this year, Attorney General Kennedy submitted
his first petition against Advance to SACB, claiming that the youth
organization had been established by tho Communist Party to pro
mote its purposes and to train candidates for party membership.
Kennedy's move immediately re-kindled the fires of what has become
a perennial debate on the constitutionality and philosophical advis
ability of the McCarran Act and its sister statute the Smith Act.
THE MOST BITTERLY contested issue in the Advance case con
troversy involves the use of a "parallelism-of-ideas" criterion to
establish a group as a "communist front." One section of the Mc-
Carren Act, as amended in 1954, provides that SACB shall consider
any organization a "communist front" whose "views and policies
do not deviate from those of the world communist movement."
Those who oppose the Act maintain Hiat this provision alone would
effectively stifle constitutionally-guaranteed freedom of thought
and expression.
In his January petition, Attorney General Kennedy claimed that
Advance policies and views had paralleled those of the Communist
Party in the following six instances: 1. in ". . . opposing the United
States-Japanese security pact . . 2. in ". . . demanding an end
to all nuclear tests by the United States . . 3. in asking for "non
intervention in Cuban affairs and the restoration of diplomatic rela
tions with Cuba, and in protesting the United States blockade of
Cuba in October 1962 . . 4. on ". . . the enforcement of the Mc-
Carran Act and the Smith Act"; 5. ". . . in condemning and opposing
the enactment of certain legislation considered by the Party inimical
to its interests, such as the Universal Military Training and Selec
tive Service Statutes"; and 6. ". . . in advocating the withdrawal of
American Armed Forces from Berlin and urging the United States
to accept the offer of the USSR to 'negotiate on Berlin,' " If the
Attorney General's petition succeeds, Advance will be forced, under

conflict with the self-incrimination provisions of the Fifth Amend
ment. . . ."
On the same day it ruled on the McCarran Act case, the Supreme
Court voted to uphold the Smith Act which makes it a criminal
offense to belong to an organization which advocates the overthrow
of the government. The test case involved one Junius Scales who
had been indicted under the Smith Act because of his membership
in the Communist Party. Hence, the court set a precedent enabling
the government to prosecute those who register under the provisions
of the McCarran Act on charges as provided by the Smith Act.
The McCarran and Smith Acts, working together, clearly repre
sent an attempt to legislate American Communism out of existence.
The supporters of the Acts admit as much but stress that there is
no difference in the aims, the objectives, or, ultimately, the methods
of the Russian and American Communist Parties. John J. Apt, at
torney for the Communist Party in McCarran Act Litigation, states
the opposing position in his pamphlet "Now Is The Time For All
Good Men to Come to the Aid of Their Country": "This provision
requires the Communist Party to defame itself calling itself some
thing that it doesn't believe it isâ€”a 'communist organization,' which
the Act defines as a seditious conspirator."
President Truman, in his veto of the 1950 Act, seems to come to
terms with the underlying conviction of those who oppose the in
vestigation of Advance under the provisions of the McCarran Act.
In part, he commented, "Once a government is committed to the
principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way
to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures,
until it becames a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a
country where everyone lives in fear."
Over one month ago, tho President's Subversive Activities Control
Board (SACB) opened hearings on Attorney General Robert Ken
nedy's petition to label the Advance Youth Organization, an 150-
member, New York student group, as a ."communist front" and thus
make it subject to registration under the provisions of the 1950 In
ternal Security Act (the McCarran Ad ). The hearings mark the first
attempt to take such action against a student or youth group since
1954 when the Labor Youlh League (LYL) was investigated under
similar charges. The LYL fought registration, but the case was
ultimately dropped when the group was forced to disband.
On January 10 of this year, Attorney General Kennedy submitted
his first petition against Advance to SACB, claiming that the youth
organization had been established by tho Communist Party to pro
mote its purposes and to train candidates for party membership.
Kennedy's move immediately re-kindled the fires of what has become
a perennial debate on the constitutionality and philosophical advis
ability of the McCarran Act and its sister statute the Smith Act.
THE MOST BITTERLY contested issue in the Advance case con
troversy involves the use of a "parallelism-of-ideas" criterion to
establish a group as a "communist front." One section of the Mc-
Carren Act, as amended in 1954, provides that SACB shall consider
any organization a "communist front" whose "views and policies
do not deviate from those of the world communist movement."
Those who oppose the Act maintain Hiat this provision alone would
effectively stifle constitutionally-guaranteed freedom of thought
and expression.
In his January petition, Attorney General Kennedy claimed that
Advance policies and views had paralleled those of the Communist
Party in the following six instances: 1. in ". . . opposing the United
States-Japanese security pact . . 2. in ". . . demanding an end
to all nuclear tests by the United States . . 3. in asking for "non
intervention in Cuban affairs and the restoration of diplomatic rela
tions with Cuba, and in protesting the United States blockade of
Cuba in October 1962 . . 4. on ". . . the enforcement of the Mc-
Carran Act and the Smith Act"; 5. ". . . in condemning and opposing
the enactment of certain legislation considered by the Party inimical
to its interests, such as the Universal Military Training and Selec
tive Service Statutes"; and 6. ". . . in advocating the withdrawal of
American Armed Forces from Berlin and urging the United States
to accept the offer of the USSR to 'negotiate on Berlin,' " If the
Attorney General's petition succeeds, Advance will be forced, under
the provisions of the McCarran Act, to register its membership and
report its finances to the Attorney General's office.
In an article on the Advance case, "Communist Viewpoint," which
calls itself "A Youth and Student Publication," commented, ". . .
Clearly, no organization can be held responsible for the positions
of any other organization. . . . How many positions? Does it matter
if a position is taken before or after it is taken by the Communist
Party? These are questions not answered in the McCarran Act.
And the SACB, which is not a court, and not manned by judges, has
been given the power to do something which is forbidden by the
Constitution: to kill organizations, for no organization could meet
the impossible conditions of the McCarran Act."
ON THE OPENING day of the hearing, witness for the prosecu
tion David Wilner, an FBI undercover investigator, testified that
Advance had been founded in 1960 as a direct result of efforts by
members of the Communist Party's National Convention. He alleged,
the "Times" reported, that Advance President Mike Stein was him
self a communist. The "Times" noted that Stein declined to com
ment on Wilner's charge against him, but the article quoted Stein
as defining Advance as "Marxist-oriented."
During the initial hearing, defense attorney Kaufman contended
that Advance endeavored to "ease tensions of the cold war period,"
the "Times" asserted. During her cross-examination, attorney Kauf
man got Wilner to agree that he had never discovered any "acts of
espionage or sabotage or talk about it" or "acts of violence" in his
work with Advance. The "Times" story concluded by reporting that
during the hearing, fifty members of Advance picketed outside carry
ing signs which read. "Robert Kennedy: the Real National Threat
Is Racism."
Whether the "Real National Threat Is Racism" or not would seem
somewhat irrelevant here. But by the same token, Advance, as an
organization and as a point of view, would seem to be essentially
irrelevant in the context of the controvercy which the case has
incited. The fact that Advance has not been demonstrated to be
actively revolutionary is not really the crux of the matter, since the
provisions of the McCarran Act, as both friend and foe admit, ex
tend beyond the need for governmental action "in clear and present
danger."
IN THEIR ESSENCE, the McCarran Act and the Smith Act re
fuse to admit that the Communist Party is a legitimate, indigenous
political organ. Supporters of the Acts maintain that to condone
the belief that the Communist Party represents a discrete and inter
nal expression of political opinion would be to commit ideological
suicide. The opposition to the McCarran and Smith Acts, most not
ably the Communist Party itself, claims that the two statutes are
unconstitutional in their very essence in that they implicitly violate
Constitutional protections of freedom of speech, assembly, and due
process of law.
The McCarran Act was passed, over President Truman's veto,
in 1950 during the height of what has been termed the "McCarthy
Era." Title I of the Act provides that all organizations which SACB
finds to be "communist action," "communist front," or "communist
infiltrated" must register with the Attorney General. The Act de
fines a "communist action organization" as "any organization di
rected, dominated or controlled by the foreign government or for
eign organization, controlling the world communist movement." A
"communist front organization" is "any organization in the United
States which is substantially directed dominated or controlled by a
communist action organization. . . ." According to the Act, a "com
munist infiltrated organization" is "one substantially directed, domi
nated or controlled by an individual or individuals who are, or who
within three years have been actively engaged in giving aid to a
communist action organization, a communist foreign government or
the world communist movement."
Under the McCarran Act, an organization designated as commu
nist must label all its literature, list the numbers of its duplicating
machines, and report its finances to the Attorney General. Those
who register as Communists are denied passports, and specified
defense jobs. A "communist infiltrated" union is denied the right
of collective bargaining. In addition, Title II of the Act empowers
the President, under certain conditions, to declare an "Internal Secur
ity Emergency." In such an event, the Attorney General is author
ized to detain those in "whom there is reasonable ground to believe
that (they) . . . probably will engage in or . . . conspire to engage
in acts of espionage or sabotage. . .
THE McCARRAN ACT was fought in the courts for eleven years
by the Communist Party. Then, in 1953, SACB ordered the Commu
nist Party to register. This order was contested in litigation for
several more years. Finally, in 1961, the US Supreme Court voted
sto 4 to uphold the SACB order. In his dissenting opinion, Justice
Black noted, "In my judgment, Ihe act here under consideration is
unconstitutional on at least three grounds in addition to its direct
conflict with the self-incrimination provisions of the Fifth Amend

that Advance endeavored to "ease tensions of the cold war period,"
the "Times" asserted. During her cross-examination, attorney Kauf
man got Wilner to agree that he had never discovered any "acts of
espionage or sabotage or talk about it" or "acts of violence" in his
work with Advance. The "Times" story concluded by reporting that
during the hearing, fifty members of Advance picketed outside carry
ing signs which read. "Robert Kennedy: the Real National Threat
Is Racism."
Whether the "Real National Threat Is Racism" or not would seem
somewhat irrelevant here. But by the same token, Advance, as an
organization and as a point of view, would seem to be essentially
irrelevant in the context of the controvercy which the case has
incited. The fact that Advance has not been demonstrated to be
actively revolutionary is not really the crux of the matter, since the
provisions of the McCarran Act, as both friend and foe admit, ex
tend beyond the need for governmental action "in clear and present
danger."
IN THEIR ESSENCE, the McCarran Act and the Smith Act re
fuse to admit that the Communist Party is a legitimate, indigenous
political organ. Supporters of the Acts maintain that to condone
the belief that the Communist Party represents a discrete and inter
nal expression of political opinion would be to commit ideological
suicide. The opposition to the McCarran and Smith Acts, most not
ably the Communist Party itself, claims that the two statutes are
unconstitutional in their very essence in that they implicitly violate
Constitutional protections of freedom of speech, assembly, and due
process of law.
The McCarran Act was passed, over President Truman's veto,
in 1950 during the height of what has been termed the "McCarthy
Era." Title I of the Act provides that all organizations which SACB
finds to be "communist action," "communist front," or "communist
infiltrated" must register with the Attorney General. The Act de
fines a "communist action organization" as "any organization di
rected, dominated or controlled by the foreign government or for
eign organization, controlling the world communist movement." A
"communist front organization" is "any organization in the United
States which is substantially directed dominated or controlled by a
communist action organization. . . ." According to the Act, a "com
munist infiltrated organization" is "one substantially directed, domi
nated or controlled by an individual or individuals who are, or who
within three years have been actively engaged in giving aid to a
communist action organization, a communist foreign government or
the world communist movement."
Under the McCarran Act, an organization designated as commu
nist must label all its literature, list the numbers of its duplicating
machines, and report its finances to the Attorney General. Those
who register as Communists are denied passports, and specified
defense jobs. A "communist infiltrated" union is denied the right
of collective bargaining. In addition, Title II of the Act empowers
the President, under certain conditions, to declare an "Internal Secur
ity Emergency." In such an event, the Attorney General is author
ized to detain those in "whom there is reasonable ground to believe
that (they) . . . probably will engage in or . . . conspire to engage
in acts of espionage or sabotage. . .
THE McCARRAN ACT was fought in the courts for eleven years
by the Communist Party. Then, in 1953, SACB ordered the Commu
nist Party to register. This order was contested in litigation for
several more years. Finally, in 1961, the US Supreme Court voted
sto 4 to uphold the SACB order. In his dissenting opinion, Justice
Black noted, "In my judgment, Ihe act here under consideration is
unconstitutional on at least three grounds in addition to its direct
conflict with the self-incrimination provisions of the Fifth Amend
ment. . . ."
On the same day it ruled on the McCarran Act case, the Supreme
Court voted to uphold the Smith Act which makes it a criminal
offense to belong to an organization which advocates the overthrow
of the government. The test case involved one Junius Scales who
had been indicted under the Smith Act because of his membership
in the Communist Party. Hence, the court set a precedent enabling
the government to prosecute those who register under the provisions
of the McCarran Act on charges as provided by the Smith Act.
The McCarran and Smith Acts, working together, clearly repre
sent an attempt to legislate American Communism out of existence.
The supporters of the Acts admit as much but stress that there is
no difference in the aims, the objectives, or, ultimately, the methods
of the Russian and American Communist Parties. John J. Apt, at
torney for the Communist Party in McCarran Act Litigation, states
the opposing position in his pamphlet "Now Is The Time For All
Good Men to Come to the Aid of Their Country": "This provision
requires the Communist Party to defame itself calling itself some
thing that it doesn't believe it isâ€”a 'communist organization,' which
the Act defines as a seditious conspirator."
President Truman, in his veto of the 1950 Act, seems to come to
terms with the underlying conviction of those who oppose the in
vestigation of Advance under the provisions of the McCarran Act.
In part, he commented, "Once a government is committed to the
principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way
to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures,
until it becames a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a
country where everyone lives in fear."
Over one month ago, tho President's Subversive Activities Control
Board (SACB) opened hearings on Attorney General Robert Ken
nedy's petition to label the Advance Youth Organization, an 150-
member, New York student group, as a ."communist front" and thus
make it subject to registration under the provisions of the 1950 In
ternal Security Act (the McCarran Ad ). The hearings mark the first
attempt to take such action against a student or youth group since
1954 when the Labor Youlh League (LYL) was investigated under
similar charges. The LYL fought registration, but the case was
ultimately dropped when the group was forced to disband.
On January 10 of this year, Attorney General Kennedy submitted
his first petition against Advance to SACB, claiming that the youth
organization had been established by tho Communist Party to pro
mote its purposes and to train candidates for party membership.
Kennedy's move immediately re-kindled the fires of what has become
a perennial debate on the constitutionality and philosophical advis
ability of the McCarran Act and its sister statute the Smith Act.
THE MOST BITTERLY contested issue in the Advance case con
troversy involves the use of a "parallelism-of-ideas" criterion to
establish a group as a "communist front." One section of the Mc-
Carren Act, as amended in 1954, provides that SACB shall consider
any organization a "communist front" whose "views and policies
do not deviate from those of the world communist movement."
Those who oppose the Act maintain Hiat this provision alone would
effectively stifle constitutionally-guaranteed freedom of thought
and expression.
In his January petition, Attorney General Kennedy claimed that
Advance policies and views had paralleled those of the Communist
Party in the following six instances: 1. in ". . . opposing the United
States-Japanese security pact . . 2. in ". . . demanding an end
to all nuclear tests by the United States . . 3. in asking for "non
intervention in Cuban affairs and the restoration of diplomatic rela
tions with Cuba, and in protesting the United States blockade of
Cuba in October 1962 . . 4. on ". . . the enforcement of the Mc-
Carran Act and the Smith Act"; 5. ". . . in condemning and opposing
the enactment of certain legislation considered by the Party inimical
to its interests, such as the Universal Military Training and Selec
tive Service Statutes"; and 6. ". . . in advocating the withdrawal of
American Armed Forces from Berlin and urging the United States
to accept the offer of the USSR to 'negotiate on Berlin,' " If the
Attorney General's petition succeeds, Advance will be forced, under
the provisions of the McCarran Act, to register its membership and
report its finances to the Attorney General's office.
In an article on the Advance case, "Communist Viewpoint," which
calls itself "A Youth and Student Publication," commented, ". . .
Clearly, no organization can be held responsible for the positions
of any other organization. . . . How many positions? Does it matter
if a position is taken before or after it is taken by the Communist
Party? These are questions not answered in the McCarran Act.
And the SACB, which is not a court, and not manned by judges, has
been given the power to do something which is forbidden by the
Constitution: to kill organizations, for no organization could meet
the impossible conditions of the McCarran Act."
ON THE OPENING day of the hearing, witness for the prosecu
tion David Wilner, an FBI undercover investigator, testified that
Advance had been founded in 1960 as a direct result of efforts by
members of the Communist Party's National Convention. He alleged,
the "Times" reported, that Advance President Mike Stein was him
self a communist. The "Times" noted that Stein declined to com
ment on Wilner's charge against him, but the article quoted Stein
as defining Advance as "Marxist-oriented."
During the initial hearing, defense attorney Kaufman contended
that Advance endeavored to "ease tensions of the cold war period,"
the "Times" asserted. During her cross-examination, attorney Kauf
man got Wilner to agree that he had never discovered any "acts of
espionage or sabotage or talk about it" or "acts of violence" in his
work with Advance. The "Times" story concluded by reporting that
during the hearing, fifty members of Advance picketed outside carry
ing signs which read. "Robert Kennedy: the Real National Threat
