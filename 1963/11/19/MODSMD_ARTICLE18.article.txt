STUDENT MALADY?
Editor, the Daily:
Can members of the Adminis
tration now hold to the viewpoint
that those students, requesting
a reconsideration of social regu
lations in the University, are
affected with a "general under
graduate malady" after the ex
pressed opinion of the former
United States Ambassador to In
dia, noted economist, and Presi
dential advisor appeared in
Thursday's Daily? The classifi
cation of all persons holding a
particular opinion in the category
of those somehow socially sick
and maladjusted is a dangerous
tendency often apparent in o u r
society. Perhaps, the reaction of
students to the many-sided Ad
ministration control of social,
political and, in some respects,
personal behaviour is more than
a "malady of students. It might
be considered a legitimate con
cern and involvement with the
maladies of the Administration
itself.
Agreed, there are faults and
weaknesses on both sides. Let's
attempt to work together hon
estly and openly, if it is possible.
We are willing to cooperate, but
not to remain in passive silence
for fear of "embarrassing" th e
Administration.

FREE OURSELVES FROM
WHAT?
Editor, The Daily:
From what does Mr. Astle
wish that we should free our
selves? He has evidently freed
himself from Ihe ability to think
logically, if indeed, he ever pos
sessed it. His contention that
freedom is not a political or legal
issue is like the confused judge's
statement: "This is a question of
law, sir, not of justice."
Being from the South, I want

to cry when I see this kind of
stupid sophistry, because I know
how many of my own friends are
duped by it. Is a man not more
free if he is allowed to vote than
if this right is denied him? Cer
tainly he is more free to vote.
The right 1o vote isn't empty of
value and importance, is it?
Lord, I hope not.
And how do you force a man to
be free? No man is enslaved by
his own choice. Except maybe
Valachi. But perhaps the Negro's
freedom is just as dangerous to
him as would be Valachi's. The
white man did not fear the im
prisoned Negro. But the super
ior-rational-white-man k no ws
that there's just no tellin' what
them irrational Negroes will do
if they're free, and he (or is it
'He') gets scared. So he mani
fests his superior intelligence in
rational midnight killings an d
church bombings. Perhaps, you're
right, Mr. Astle, and it isn't a
manifestation of our love and
respect for a man when we free
his children to be killed. But
people tend to be confused about
this sort of thing. They think
that if the man could vote, he
might elect someone who would
protect him.

THE FLICK TRADITION
Editor, The Daily:
Each activity has definite rules,
generally established by custom,
regarding the behavior of its
spectators: in tennis only light
clapping or soft hissing are ac
ceptable, in football mass yells
are in order, in baseball both um
pires and players are fair game
for abuse, and in church or at
lectures silence is usually main
tined throughout. By the same
token both custom and over
whelming audience approval have
made the yelling of comments,
obscene or otherwise, at the
flicks not only acceptable but al
most mandatory. No individual
or minority group < Daily editors
and Student Police included)
have the right to try to break this
custom. If some vote on this al
ready clearcut issue must be tak
en let it be by Ihe members of
the flick audience. We are the
ones who would have to suffer
through what are usually terrible
flicks without the compensation
of our "balcony tradition."
