"f!nd remains unproved or a myth until we commit ourselves to the way of f'hrist.
The forces of evil, the 'devil,' 'satan,' and all such conceptions remain as a laugh
able superstitious hangover until we seriously attempt to lead Christian lives. 1
have, therefore, no hesitation in challenging any agnostic who wants to test the
truth of the Christian faith. Let him commit himself, and before long he will
know both the splendor of the truth and the seriousness of the struggle." J. 11.

Unbelievers, although they may deny the existence of a being known as Satan or
I.ucifer. will certainly admit that evil and death exist everywhere in the world.
It is obvious that throughout history man has not been able to change the basic
nature of his own heart, nor successfully overcome the power of evil. While most
people today hope for world peace, the) yet suspect that man may not be able to
prevent a terrible nuclear holocaust. The present moral degeneration of our nation
in the midst of prosperity and wealth testify to the fact that sin and evil are all
around us. scarcely under control.
According to the Scriptures, evil did not originate with man, but was introduced
into this world by a fallen archangel who previously held an exalted position before
God.
"How art thou fallen from heaven, O I.ucifer. son of the morning! TTow are thou
cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations' For thou hast said in
thine heart. T will ascend into heaven. 1 will exalt my throne above the stars of
God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
1 will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High, Yet
thou shalt be brought down to Hell, to the sides of the pit." Is. 14:12-15.
Pride was the cause of Satan's fall and is the basis of all sin. Because of pride,
man wants to exalt himself instead of God, to emphasize his own dignity and si-lf
righteousness, and to deny the God of creation and the necessity of redemption.
It's a popular misconception that Satan rules over the departed souls in Ilell. How
ever. scripture indicates that Satan dwells in the "hcavenlies" and oil earth. Satan's
ultimate fate is the Lake of Fire (Rev. 20:10). He was defeated by the death,
resurrection, and ascension of Christ.
'•Rut we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering
of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste
death for every man . . . that through death he might destroy him that had the
power of death, that is. the devil." Ileb. 2:'>. 14.
Satan's main purpose is to dishonor God and to lead men to do likewise. Anything
and everything that honors and exalts Jesus Christ is ol God. and all that dishonors
Christ is uf Satan. Thus, most of the members of the human race are unwittingly
servants of Satan. He is master over all unbelievers, keeping tlvem enslaved by
invisible chains of sin. They can be set, free only by the new birth which comes
from God. Satan has invented all kinds of religions and false forms of Christianity
in order to keep unbelievers from meeting the Living God. To tone down the promise
that Christ will return and reign, Satan has invented a school of thought which
claims that Christ's Second Advent has already occurred. To prevent men from
turning to Christ for salvation. Satan has set up false sciences of healing with a
Christian label. To satisfy man's curiosity about the unseen world of the spirit
he lias created Metaphysics and Spiritism. Satan also promotes the doctrine of
salvation by works in order to discredit the Gospel of the Grace of God. Such are
a few of his cunning ways to delude man .
Every man serves either Satan or Christ. There are 110 in-betweens.
"Xo servant can serve two masters: for either lie will hate the one and love the
other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God
and mammon." Luke 16:1.1.

Unbelievers, although they may deny the existence of a being known as Satan or
I.ucifer. will certainly admit that evil and death exist everywhere in the world.
It is obvious that throughout history man has not been able to change the basic
nature of his own heart, nor successfully overcome the power of evil. While most
people today hope for world peace, the) yet suspect that man may not be able to
prevent a terrible nuclear holocaust. The present moral degeneration of our nation
in the midst of prosperity and wealth testify to the fact that sin and evil are all
around us. scarcely under control.
According to the Scriptures, evil did not originate with man, but was introduced
into this world by a fallen archangel who previously held an exalted position before
God.
"How art thou fallen from heaven, O I.ucifer. son of the morning! TTow are thou
cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations' For thou hast said in
thine heart. T will ascend into heaven. 1 will exalt my throne above the stars of
God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
1 will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High, Yet
thou shalt be brought down to Hell, to the sides of the pit." Is. 14:12-15.
Pride was the cause of Satan's fall and is the basis of all sin. Because of pride,
man wants to exalt himself instead of God, to emphasize his own dignity and si-lf
righteousness, and to deny the God of creation and the necessity of redemption.
It's a popular misconception that Satan rules over the departed souls in Ilell. How
ever. scripture indicates that Satan dwells in the "hcavenlies" and oil earth. Satan's
ultimate fate is the Lake of Fire (Rev. 20:10). He was defeated by the death,
resurrection, and ascension of Christ.
'•Rut we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering
of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste
death for every man . . . that through death he might destroy him that had the
power of death, that is. the devil." Ileb. 2:'>. 14.
Satan's main purpose is to dishonor God and to lead men to do likewise. Anything
and everything that honors and exalts Jesus Christ is ol God. and all that dishonors
Christ is uf Satan. Thus, most of the members of the human race are unwittingly
servants of Satan. He is master over all unbelievers, keeping tlvem enslaved by

Satan's main purpose is to dishonor God and to lead men to do likewise. Anything
and everything that honors and exalts Jesus Christ is ol God. and all that dishonors
Christ is uf Satan. Thus, most of the members of the human race are unwittingly
servants of Satan. He is master over all unbelievers, keeping tlvem enslaved by
invisible chains of sin. They can be set, free only by the new birth which comes
from God. Satan has invented all kinds of religions and false forms of Christianity
in order to keep unbelievers from meeting the Living God. To tone down the promise
that Christ will return and reign, Satan has invented a school of thought which
claims that Christ's Second Advent has already occurred. To prevent men from
turning to Christ for salvation. Satan has set up false sciences of healing with a
Christian label. To satisfy man's curiosity about the unseen world of the spirit
he lias created Metaphysics and Spiritism. Satan also promotes the doctrine of
salvation by works in order to discredit the Gospel of the Grace of God. Such are
a few of his cunning ways to delude man .
Every man serves either Satan or Christ. There are 110 in-betweens.

"f!nd remains unproved or a myth until we commit ourselves to the way of f'hrist.
The forces of evil, the 'devil,' 'satan,' and all such conceptions remain as a laugh
able superstitious hangover until we seriously attempt to lead Christian lives. 1
have, therefore, no hesitation in challenging any agnostic who wants to test the
truth of the Christian faith. Let him commit himself, and before long he will
know both the splendor of the truth and the seriousness of the struggle." J. 11.
Phillips, (ioil Our Contemporary, MacMillan, X.Y., 1960.
Unbelievers, although they may deny the existence of a being known as Satan or
I.ucifer. will certainly admit that evil and death exist everywhere in the world.
It is obvious that throughout history man has not been able to change the basic
nature of his own heart, nor successfully overcome the power of evil. While most
people today hope for world peace, the) yet suspect that man may not be able to
prevent a terrible nuclear holocaust. The present moral degeneration of our nation
in the midst of prosperity and wealth testify to the fact that sin and evil are all
around us. scarcely under control.
According to the Scriptures, evil did not originate with man, but was introduced
into this world by a fallen archangel who previously held an exalted position before
God.
"How art thou fallen from heaven, O I.ucifer. son of the morning! TTow are thou
cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations' For thou hast said in
thine heart. T will ascend into heaven. 1 will exalt my throne above the stars of
God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
1 will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High, Yet
thou shalt be brought down to Hell, to the sides of the pit." Is. 14:12-15.
Pride was the cause of Satan's fall and is the basis of all sin. Because of pride,
man wants to exalt himself instead of God, to emphasize his own dignity and si-lf
righteousness, and to deny the God of creation and the necessity of redemption.
It's a popular misconception that Satan rules over the departed souls in Ilell. How
ever. scripture indicates that Satan dwells in the "hcavenlies" and oil earth. Satan's
ultimate fate is the Lake of Fire (Rev. 20:10). He was defeated by the death,
resurrection, and ascension of Christ.
