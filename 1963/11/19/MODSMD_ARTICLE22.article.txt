# Kickers Drop Duo, Still Cop Nor Cat Title

### 
The strong Stanford soccer
team's nine game winning skein
came to an abrupt end lasl week,
but not until Coach Priddle's In
dians had .salted away thÂ« league
championship and assured them
selves of a berth in the NCAA
regionals.
THE SAN JOSE Spartans were
first to break the Stanford streak,
overcoming a 3-1 Card lead with
a four-goal outbrust during a brief
two-minute span in the third
period. A tight Spartan defense
held the fighting Tribe at bay in
the late minutes to preserve a San
Jose 6-5 victory.
In a game termed "very sloppy"
by Priddle, U.S.F. whipped line
Redman 3-1, Saturday as again
the Stanford hooters sacrificed an
early lead. A penalty kick by Klas
Bergman had put the Tribe ahead
in the first half, but from there
on the USF'ers dominated all the
way.
THE NEXT big assignment
comes for Stanford Saturday,
Nov. 23, when they meet either
USF or San Jose (depending
upon the outcome of this week's
USF-Cal tilt) at Balboa Stadium
in San Francisco in the NCAA
regionals.
