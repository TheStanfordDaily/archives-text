# Ralston Takes WSU Blame, Expresses Big Game Hope
## 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
A dejected John Ralston dis
patched, discounted, and denied
all the customary excuses, and
took full responsibility for what
he termed "one of worst games
ever played by a Stanford foot
ball team" in his squad eighth

j straight loss to Washington State,
| Saturday.
Was the team looking past this
! game to the Big (lame against
Cal next week?
"We weren't looking by Wash
ington State for Cal at all. You
I just don't look past a team that
has beaten you seven times in a
row."
Well, then, did the early fum
bles cause the defeat?
"FUMBLES ALWAYS hurt,
but we were just mentally flat.
We were unenthusiastic, out
charged, out-tackled, out-hit, and
generally out-played. Southerland
(Coach Jim of WSU) did a good
job of getting his boys up and
ready for the game. I lake full
responsibility for not getting our
team high enough."

STAR HALFBACK Stove Thur
low suffered an injury which was
diagnosed by physician Gordon
Campbell as a "severe charley
horse with hemorrhage." His
prospects for playing in npxt
week's game with the Golden
Bears was only rated as 50-50.
Yet, Ralston was optimistic
about Big Game. "We reached our
low point today. We've never
played worse. From here on we
can only go up, and 1 know our
team will play well Saturday. I
still have a lot of faith in the
players."
