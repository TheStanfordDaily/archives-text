CHICAGO (CPS> — With the
administration stoutly claiming
there is no such thing as a foot
ball game and students planning
a protest demonstration, the Uni
versity of Chicago's 1963 non
football season got underway last
week.
The UC team, which does not
exist, lost its first game to North
Central College 29-7 and enter
tained some 1,000 spectators who
dropped by to see what wasn't
going on.
The University's administration
claims that it is offering football
classes and that the "practice
scrimmages" are just part of the
curriculum.
On the other hand, some stu
dents say that it looks like foot
ball to them and planned a sit-in
across the 50 yard lino and an
grily protested in the campus
newspaper, The Maroon.
The university officially
dropped football more than 20
years ago, but resumed "scrim
mages" six years ago.
There might never have boon
a problem this year had it not
been for tho institution a year
ago of a nationwide search by the
university for two "scholar-ath
letes."
To many, the "talent hunt" cli
maxed alleged administration at
tempts in recent years to change
Chicago's image from a haven
for oddballs and beatniks to a
typical well-rounded university.
What, the students asked,
would be the difference between
Harvard and Chicago if they both
