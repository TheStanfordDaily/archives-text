The timo has conic to think of Christinas shopping, for the
Yuletide will ho upon us quicker than you can say .lack Robin
son. (Have you ever wondered, incidentally, about the origin
of this interesting phrase "Quicker than you can say Jack
Robinson"? Well sir, the original saying was French —"Plus
rite (jiu <h dir< Jacques luihespiem ." Jack Robinson is, as every
one knows, an Anglicization of Jacques Robespierre who was,
as everyone knows, the famous figure from the French Revolu
tion who, as everyone knows, got murdered in his bath by
Danton, Murat, Caligula, and A 1 Capone.
(The reason people started saying "Quicker than you can
say Jacques Robespierre —or Jack Robinson, as he is called in
English-speaking countries like England, the U.S., and Cleve
land i> quite an interesting little story. It seems that Robes
pierre's wife, Georges Sand, got word of the plot to murder
her husband in his bath. All she had to do to save his life was
call his name and warn him. But, alas, quicker than she could
say Jacques Robespierre, she received a telegram from her old
friend Frederic Chopin who was down in Majorca setting lyrics

to his immortal "Warsaw Concerto." Chopin said he needed
(leorges Sand's help desperately because he could not find a
rhyme for "Warsaw." Naturally, Georges could not refuse
such an urgent request.
(Well sir, off to Majorca went Georges, but before she left,
v lic told her little daughter Walter that some bad men were
coming to murder Daddy in his bath. She instructed Walter
to shout Robespierre's name the moment the bad men arrived.
Hut Walter, alas, had been sea-bathing that morning on the
Riviera, and she had come home with a big bag of salt water
taffy, and when the bad men arrived to murder Robespierre,
Walter, alas, was chewing a wad of taffy and could not get her
mouth unstuck in time to shout a warning. Robespierre, alas,
was murdered quicker than you could say Jacques Robespierre
—or .Jack Robinson, as he is called in English-speaking countries.
(There is, 1 am pleased to report, one small note of cheer
in this grisly tale. When (ieorges Sand got to Majorca, she did
succeed in helping Chopin find a rhyme for "Warsaw" as every
one knows who has heard those haunting lyrics:
In the fair town of Warsaw,
Which Xapolcoris horse saw,
Singing cocklca and mussels, alive alive o!)
Hut I digress.
We were speaking of Christmas gifts. What we all try to
find at Christinas is, of course, unusual and distinctive gifts for
our friends. May I suggest then a carton of Marlboro Cigarettes?
What ? ou are astonished? Vou had not thought of Marlboro
as unu-ual? You had regarded them as familiar, reliable smokes
who>e excellence varied not one jot nor tittle from year to year?
True. All true. Hut all the same, Marlboros arc unusual be
cause every time you try one, it's like tin- first time. The flavor
never palls, the filter never gets hackneyed, the soft pack i
ever a new delight, and so is the Flip Top box. Each Marlboro
is a fresh and pristine pleasure, and if you want all your friends
to clap their hands and cry, "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa
Clans!" you will see that their stockings arc filled with Marl
boros on C hristmas morn. © ism Max shuiman
