# Government Study Under Way To Remove Taxes on Grants
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CFS» Trea
sury Department and Internal
Revenue Service iIRS) Officials
are meeting with college and uni
versity representatives to work
out new guidelines for taxing
fellowships and scholarships giv
en to U.S. college students.
Officials of the American Coun
cil on Education (ACE) were the
most recent representatives to
confer with government officials
about "A complete revamping of
taxes on student grants."
The study has been underway
since the IllS and Treasury Offi
cals were forced into agreeing
that students receiving scholar
ships and fellowships, which in
cluded such duties as teaching
practical research did not have to
pay income tax on the grants.
Their decision last summer was
forced by two tax court decisions.
In both cases, Hie New York
and Tennessee Tax Courts held
that the students did not have to
pay income tax on the fellowships
granted for the work.
As a result, an IRS spokesman
said "hundreds" of suits pending
against students who have re
fused to pay income tax on such
grants have been dropped, and in
some cases, refunds have been
made.
The temporary ruling upset a
section of the 1931 tax code, re
quiring students to pay income
tax on fellowships of money for
part-time jobs such as teaching or
practical research.
Exempted under the code were
specific cases where tin 1 work in
volved led to the award of a de
gree. Cited were such cases of

practice teaching for students
seeking education degrees. But
the two court rulings held that
the work the students were doing
was part of earning their degrees.
IRS and Treasury Officials are
now attempting to clarify .just
exactly what is necessary work
for students working toward a
degree. An admitted government
mistake was not exempting cer
tain science students required to
take part in research projects to
win advance degrees.
Government officials said no
final decisions have been made.
"We don't know whether we're
going to loosen ortighten the
code just yet." a treasury spokes
man said, "but it looks like we
might end up doing both."
Any new restrictions, he said,
would not be retroactive. But new
benefits would probably affect
persons who have paid taxes
since 1954.

en to U.S. college students.
Officials of the American Coun
cil on Education (ACE) were the
most recent representatives to
confer with government officials
about "A complete revamping of
taxes on student grants."
The study has been underway
since the IllS and Treasury Offi
cals were forced into agreeing
that students receiving scholar
ships and fellowships, which in
cluded such duties as teaching
practical research did not have to
pay income tax on the grants.
Their decision last summer was
forced by two tax court decisions.
In both cases, Hie New York
and Tennessee Tax Courts held
that the students did not have to
pay income tax on the fellowships
granted for the work.
As a result, an IRS spokesman
said "hundreds" of suits pending
against students who have re
fused to pay income tax on such
grants have been dropped, and in
some cases, refunds have been
made.
The temporary ruling upset a
section of the 1931 tax code, re
quiring students to pay income
tax on fellowships of money for
part-time jobs such as teaching or
practical research.
Exempted under the code were
specific cases where tin 1 work in
volved led to the award of a de
gree. Cited were such cases of

practice teaching for students
seeking education degrees. But
the two court rulings held that
the work the students were doing
was part of earning their degrees.
IRS and Treasury Officials are
now attempting to clarify .just
exactly what is necessary work
for students working toward a
degree. An admitted government
mistake was not exempting cer
tain science students required to
take part in research projects to
win advance degrees.
Government officials said no
final decisions have been made.
"We don't know whether we're
going to loosen ortighten the
code just yet." a treasury spokes
man said, "but it looks like we
might end up doing both."
Any new restrictions, he said,
would not be retroactive. But new
benefits would probably affect
persons who have paid taxes
since 1954.
