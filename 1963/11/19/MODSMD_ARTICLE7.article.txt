# School Aid Selective in Benefits

### MIKE WAGGONER Associate Editor 
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first in a series
of articles dealing 1 with the relation between the
Federal government and higher education, and
Stanford's place in this relationship.)
Largely since the second world war. the Ameri
can universities have come to receive large
amounts of money from the federal government
This money, a promise of great benefits, has alsc
brought with it great problems. Vet, rarely is il
refused. The universities are like the lady in the
limerick:
"There was a young lady from Kent,
Who said she knew what it meant,
When men took her to dine.
Gave her cocktails and wine,
She knew what il meant, but she went."
In this series of articles, I shall examine some
of these problems and benefits. The universities
in accepting the money, seem to have given ade
quale consideration to (he benefits. Il is only rea
sonable thai these articles be weighted on the side
of the problems.
MANY BASIC problems of higher education
though seeming to have nothing to do with the
government, arc affected by federal researcl
grants.
There is a long-standing conflict between gradu
ate and undergraduate education, with Ihc gradu
ates in a largo university presently getting more
attention. Federal grants make more researcl
possible; research requires professors' time; th<
only students who can use professors' time while
they are doing research are graduates. Fedora
grants shift the professor's time from teaching
< undergraduates i to research (teaching gradu
ates t.
Or consider the problem of education by teach
ing assistants. This practice* is subject to criticism
even when the best graduate students are em
ployeel as TA's. It is even more questionable vvher
the TA's are not the best students but the se<on<

or third rank, those who got noil her fellowships,
the ultimate prize, nor research assistantships,
popular both for the prestige of research and for
providing a thesis project. Theses are required
for a Ph.D., normally teaching is not.
FOR THK UNIVERSITY there is the question.
"Are the funds really worthwhile?" Research con
tracts rarely pay for themselves. They require
space in University buildings, further personnel
like secretaries, and heat and light expenses. II
is possible that a university will subsidize the gov
ernment.
Government funds are such a large part of
university budgets that the threat of federal con
trol and, more realistically, of federal influence
arises. Funds are negotiated between' the scien
tists and the agency, the universities approval
virtually a rubber stamp. The funds may amount
to 20-80 per cent of the universilv budget. Com
mittments of a major nature are made in the uni
versity's own funds, space and growth areas, with
the university having relatively little control over
them.
Security restrictions may threaten the Univer
sity's freedom to know. It is hard to judge the
affect on the academician of producing so many
weapons of death.
NATIONALLY, the great weight of federal
funds to the sciences puts the humanities in im
balance. There a parallel problem of concentration
by universities. Federal funds go mainly to a few
great universities, enabling them to attract more
and better personnel and students. By taking these
away from the small universities and colleges,
federal programs may hurt the have-nots abso
lutely as well as relatively.
These are among the problems raised by fed
eral funds in higher education. How real are they?
To what extent are they but a misunderstanding
of the modern role of a university? What is be
ing done about them, both nationally and at Stan
ford? This series will address itself to these
questions.
