# 'Beat Cal' Banner Donned by 'David'
## 
### BANNING GARRETT 
The city of Florence's copy
of Michelangelo's "David" now
stands in the driveway of Stan
ford in Italy and is draped with
a red loincloth with white letter
ing saying "Beat Cal." The heist
of the 1,000 pound statue was
made during the early morning of
November 14, by 16 dedicated
Stanford students.
The plan was conceived nearly
a week in advance, and involved
the use of a "borrowed" police
man's uniform, a pick-up truck,
and an intricate system of block
and tackle.
The truck arrived at the old
location of the statue, the cn
-1 ranee to the Palazzo Vecchio, at
3:25 a.m. Six Stanford women
were stationed at the corners of
the six streets converging at the
square to divert "personae non
gratae." Tom Connaughton, the
student "policeman," preserved
the peace when two Florentines
showed curiosity. It took ten men
27 minutes to hoist the statue
onto the mattresses in the pick
up.
The entire project "went off
without a hitch," as one of the
students stated in a bulletin to
the Daily. The bulletin also stated
"We are all pleased with the
'David's new location, though
there is some reason to believe
that the Florentine authorities
may have a different opinion to
day."
Dr. Robert A. Walker, Director
of the Overseas Campuses, said
that he had heard nothing about
the matter. "I talked to the Ital
ian Campus today and they ne
glected to mention the matter. At
this time 1 have no comment."
