# Peace Caucus Sponsors Talk
## 
### 
Military training in ROTC
classes at Stanford will be the
topic of a panel discussion spon
sored by Peace Caucus tonight
at 8:00 p.m. in the Large Lounge
of Tresidder.
Professor Philip Rhinelander
will represent the Administra
tion, Professor Bruce Franklin
will speak against ROTC. Cadet
Major Jim Sisler of Army ROTC
and Peace Caucus member Stuart
Macßae will also participate.
PROFESSOR Rhinelander has
the following to say in support
of ROTC: "Education in a free
society is a privilege which im
plies a responsibility. It implies
(among other things» a respon
sibility to the society which
makes free inquiry and free dis
cussion possible.
"Military service is one way by
which a student can fulfill his
social obligation. It is not the
only way, nor it is necessarily
the best way for all students. But
is is an important way for those
who are eligible. So long as the
University ROTC programs are
voluntary, as they are at Stan
ford, I see no basis for suggest
ing that they involve any im
proper intervention by the gov
ernment in the educational proc
ess. The ROTC programs are an
opportunity, not a mandate."
PKOFKSSOK Franklin, oppos
ing Prof. Rhinelander in tonight's
debate, states: "ROTC represents
an intrusion of alien values which
are not subject to question into
the University; furthermore, con
sidered from a pragmatic point
of view, ROTC is ridiculous."
The Peace Caucus has distrib
uted an appeal to each faculty
and administration member urg
ing him as an educator to involve
himself in. and speak out on, the
presence of military training on
their campus. The appeal also
poses three questions: "Is gov
ernmental military training
threatening traditional education
al values? San educators toler
ate this governmental encroach
ment upon a free educational sys
tem? What type of education
promotes nationalistic values?"
Following the initial presenta
tion by the panel will be a period
for questions and statements
from any attending.
KZSt , >IXO, will broadcast flic
panel discussion starting at
8:05 p.m.
