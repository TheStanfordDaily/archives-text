# Poll Shows Behavior at Flicks Does Bother Students
## 
### 
(EDITOR'S NOTE —The following article and the poll accom
panying it are the result of an effort by the writer, Ken Lillquist, a
Stanford student, to determine if the type of behavior which pre
dominates at the showing of the flicks is condoned by the Stanford
student as an individual or silently approved as part of a crowd
response).
By KEN LILLQUST
A Sunday evening flick—Christ is being taunted and beaten by the
soldiers, and, as he is lying in a heap, one of the soldiers shoves a
crown of thorns on his bleeding head. The picture isn't, complete
enough, so a Stanford student yells to Christ, "Get up you wimp."
The audience roars in response.
This is a typical happening. My question is: Are these same stu
dents who are apparently delighted with these remarks individuals
like myself who are selecting and forming the final ideals by which
they will eventually guide their lives? Are they really that hypocrit
ical and sacriligious, or can their behavior be blamed on crowd in
fluence?
To determine what are the feelings and opinions behind such be
havior I took a poll of 155 students representing all groups from
freshmen girls to graduate men. I hoped to show through this survey
that this type of behavior is unbecoming at Stanford and that the
remarks are indeed a big problem.
Every group questioned said the remarks are made for these
reasons listed in order of significance: To be witty — To release
emotions — To gain attention — To gain acceptance of group — To
heighten self esteem.
Let us look at this reasoning in light of the examples that I gave:
Is this sacrilege witty? Is this emotional release healthy? Accord
ing to the students answers, yes, it is!
I COULD NOT BELIEVE this, and the students do not really
believe it either. When I asked them what kind of impression would
be conveyed by the remarks to people outside the university com
munity, the results were quite different. I gave them the same
choices as when I asked about their own personal reaction except
1 included also the choice — I don't care what they would think.
The answers were nearly reversed. In fact, the so popular choices
previously, namely that the remarks are amusing and appealing,
now ranked seventh and eighth instead of first and second. Only
the choice — They would not be affected — ranked lower. The sad
thing was that over a third of the students do not care what an out
sider might think. In a few years we are going to be this group out
side the Stanford community who would care and as we now say
ourselves in the following order of importance: We would be sur
prised — annoyed — abhorred — disillusioned — offended. Why
then are we now so entertained?
IN REALITY, WE ARE NOT all entertained. As the student
body affirmed, at most we condone the remarks. In fact, though 37
per cent of the students approve of the remarks 21 per cent dis
approve. One fifth of the students is a lot of nobody.
When I asked the students how they thought the majority felt
36 per cent still thought that most students approve, but on the con
trary. only 6 per cent would say they though most disapprove. This

misconception is in fact the root of the problem. A lot of students
do not like the remarks! But everyone just assumes there is no
problem and so nothing gels done about a problem that many of the
students would like to see eliminated.
IN FACT, WHEN I ASKED the students what position they
would take regarding action to stop the remarks, the split in opinion
was even more pronounced. I gave the students four choices — three
of these effectively could eliminate the remarks and the last would
insure that nothing woidd be done about the remarks. Forty nine
per cent of the response was for one of the three choices which could
stop the remarks, wilh the other 51 per cent in favor of no action.
The one rather loaded question of my poll tended to confirm that
the remarks have had bad reflection on the individual as such. My
question had eight attitudes for response. The two most popular
ones — That remarks are a healthy outlet for tension and that they
are clever and funny — are the response of the crowd as a mass,
not as individuals.
NOTE HOWEVER, the following response to five of the other
attitudes that must be an individual response. — 20 per cent: The
remarks show unconcern for propriety — 19 percent: They are dis
respectful to the feelings of others — 1.3 per cent: They damage the
public image of Stanford — 9 per cent: They show disrespect for
Cod — 9 per cent: They show disregard for morality.
These figures represent an average response of almost 1!) per
cent from individuals. Because this response is, and has to be an in
dividual response, it is significant. The crowd perhaps is amused by
the remarks, but the individual is often hurt by them.
Nom de Guerre once said, "It must be a very contemptible, im
mature philosophy that sanctions insidious crowd vulgarity and
ostentatious impropriety — at the expense of debasing the ethical
or moral philosophy of even the most paltry individual."

(EDITOR'S NOTE —The following article and the poll accom
panying it are the result of an effort by the writer, Ken Lillquist, a
Stanford student, to determine if the type of behavior which pre
dominates at the showing of the flicks is condoned by the Stanford
student as an individual or silently approved as part of a crowd
response).
By KEN LILLQUST
A Sunday evening flick—Christ is being taunted and beaten by the
soldiers, and, as he is lying in a heap, one of the soldiers shoves a
crown of thorns on his bleeding head. The picture isn't, complete
enough, so a Stanford student yells to Christ, "Get up you wimp."
The audience roars in response.
This is a typical happening. My question is: Are these same stu
dents who are apparently delighted with these remarks individuals
like myself who are selecting and forming the final ideals by which
they will eventually guide their lives? Are they really that hypocrit
ical and sacriligious, or can their behavior be blamed on crowd in
fluence?
To determine what are the feelings and opinions behind such be
havior I took a poll of 155 students representing all groups from
freshmen girls to graduate men. I hoped to show through this survey
that this type of behavior is unbecoming at Stanford and that the
remarks are indeed a big problem.
Every group questioned said the remarks are made for these
reasons listed in order of significance: To be witty — To release
emotions — To gain attention — To gain acceptance of group — To
heighten self esteem.
Let us look at this reasoning in light of the examples that I gave:
Is this sacrilege witty? Is this emotional release healthy? Accord
ing to the students answers, yes, it is!
I COULD NOT BELIEVE this, and the students do not really
believe it either. When I asked them what kind of impression would
be conveyed by the remarks to people outside the university com
munity, the results were quite different. I gave them the same
choices as when I asked about their own personal reaction except
1 included also the choice — I don't care what they would think.
The answers were nearly reversed. In fact, the so popular choices
previously, namely that the remarks are amusing and appealing,
now ranked seventh and eighth instead of first and second. Only
the choice — They would not be affected — ranked lower. The sad
thing was that over a third of the students do not care what an out
sider might think. In a few years we are going to be this group out
side the Stanford community who would care and as we now say
ourselves in the following order of importance: We would be sur
prised — annoyed — abhorred — disillusioned — offended. Why
then are we now so entertained?
IN REALITY, WE ARE NOT all entertained. As the student
body affirmed, at most we condone the remarks. In fact, though 37
per cent of the students approve of the remarks 21 per cent dis
approve. One fifth of the students is a lot of nobody.
When I asked the students how they thought the majority felt
36 per cent still thought that most students approve, but on the con
trary. only 6 per cent would say they though most disapprove. This

misconception is in fact the root of the problem. A lot of students
do not like the remarks! But everyone just assumes there is no
problem and so nothing gels done about a problem that many of the
students would like to see eliminated.
IN FACT, WHEN I ASKED the students what position they
would take regarding action to stop the remarks, the split in opinion
was even more pronounced. I gave the students four choices — three
of these effectively could eliminate the remarks and the last would
insure that nothing woidd be done about the remarks. Forty nine
per cent of the response was for one of the three choices which could
stop the remarks, wilh the other 51 per cent in favor of no action.
The one rather loaded question of my poll tended to confirm that
the remarks have had bad reflection on the individual as such. My
question had eight attitudes for response. The two most popular
ones — That remarks are a healthy outlet for tension and that they
are clever and funny — are the response of the crowd as a mass,
not as individuals.
NOTE HOWEVER, the following response to five of the other
attitudes that must be an individual response. — 20 per cent: The
remarks show unconcern for propriety — 19 percent: They are dis
respectful to the feelings of others — 1.3 per cent: They damage the
public image of Stanford — 9 per cent: They show disrespect for
Cod — 9 per cent: They show disregard for morality.
These figures represent an average response of almost 1!) per
cent from individuals. Because this response is, and has to be an in
dividual response, it is significant. The crowd perhaps is amused by
the remarks, but the individual is often hurt by them.
Nom de Guerre once said, "It must be a very contemptible, im
mature philosophy that sanctions insidious crowd vulgarity and
ostentatious impropriety — at the expense of debasing the ethical
or moral philosophy of even the most paltry individual."

(EDITOR'S NOTE —The following article and the poll accom

Stanford student, to determine if the type of behavior which pre

By KEN LILLQUST
A Sunday evening flick—Christ is being taunted and beaten by the
soldiers, and, as he is lying in a heap, one of the soldiers shoves a
crown of thorns on his bleeding head. The picture isn't, complete
enough, so a Stanford student yells to Christ, "Get up you wimp."
The audience roars in response.
This is a typical happening. My question is: Are these same stu
dents who are apparently delighted with these remarks individuals
like myself who are selecting and forming the final ideals by which
they will eventually guide their lives? Are they really that hypocrit
ical and sacriligious, or can their behavior be blamed on crowd in
fluence?
To determine what are the feelings and opinions behind such be
havior I took a poll of 155 students representing all groups from
freshmen girls to graduate men. I hoped to show through this survey
that this type of behavior is unbecoming at Stanford and that the
remarks are indeed a big problem.
Every group questioned said the remarks are made for these
reasons listed in order of significance: To be witty — To release
emotions — To gain attention — To gain acceptance of group — To
heighten self esteem.
Let us look at this reasoning in light of the examples that I gave:
Is this sacrilege witty? Is this emotional release healthy? Accord
ing to the students answers, yes, it is!
I COULD NOT BELIEVE this, and the students do not really
believe it either. When I asked them what kind of impression would
be conveyed by the remarks to people outside the university com
munity, the results were quite different. I gave them the same
choices as when I asked about their own personal reaction except
1 included also the choice — I don't care what they would think.
The answers were nearly reversed. In fact, the so popular choices
previously, namely that the remarks are amusing and appealing,
now ranked seventh and eighth instead of first and second. Only
the choice — They would not be affected — ranked lower. The sad
thing was that over a third of the students do not care what an out
sider might think. In a few years we are going to be this group out
side the Stanford community who would care and as we now say
ourselves in the following order of importance: We would be sur
prised — annoyed — abhorred — disillusioned — offended. Why
then are we now so entertained?
IN REALITY, WE ARE NOT all entertained. As the student
body affirmed, at most we condone the remarks. In fact, though 37
per cent of the students approve of the remarks 21 per cent dis
approve. One fifth of the students is a lot of nobody.
When I asked the students how they thought the majority felt
36 per cent still thought that most students approve, but on the con
trary. only 6 per cent would say they though most disapprove. This

misconception is in fact the root of the problem. A lot of students
do not like the remarks! But everyone just assumes there is no
problem and so nothing gels done about a problem that many of the
students would like to see eliminated.
IN FACT, WHEN I ASKED the students what position they
would take regarding action to stop the remarks, the split in opinion
was even more pronounced. I gave the students four choices — three
of these effectively could eliminate the remarks and the last would
insure that nothing woidd be done about the remarks. Forty nine
per cent of the response was for one of the three choices which could
stop the remarks, wilh the other 51 per cent in favor of no action.
The one rather loaded question of my poll tended to confirm that
the remarks have had bad reflection on the individual as such. My
question had eight attitudes for response. The two most popular
ones — That remarks are a healthy outlet for tension and that they
are clever and funny — are the response of the crowd as a mass,
not as individuals.
NOTE HOWEVER, the following response to five of the other
attitudes that must be an individual response. — 20 per cent: The
remarks show unconcern for propriety — 19 percent: They are dis
respectful to the feelings of others — 1.3 per cent: They damage the
public image of Stanford — 9 per cent: They show disrespect for
Cod — 9 per cent: They show disregard for morality.
These figures represent an average response of almost 1!) per
cent from individuals. Because this response is, and has to be an in
dividual response, it is significant. The crowd perhaps is amused by
the remarks, but the individual is often hurt by them.
Nom de Guerre once said, "It must be a very contemptible, im
mature philosophy that sanctions insidious crowd vulgarity and
ostentatious impropriety — at the expense of debasing the ethical
or moral philosophy of even the most paltry individual."

(EDITOR'S NOTE —The following article and the poll accom
panying it are the result of an effort by the writer, Ken Lillquist, a
Stanford student, to determine if the type of behavior which pre
dominates at the showing of the flicks is condoned by the Stanford
student as an individual or silently approved as part of a crowd
response).
By KEN LILLQUST
A Sunday evening flick—Christ is being taunted and beaten by the
soldiers, and, as he is lying in a heap, one of the soldiers shoves a
crown of thorns on his bleeding head. The picture isn't, complete
enough, so a Stanford student yells to Christ, "Get up you wimp."
The audience roars in response.
This is a typical happening. My question is: Are these same stu
dents who are apparently delighted with these remarks individuals
like myself who are selecting and forming the final ideals by which
they will eventually guide their lives? Are they really that hypocrit
ical and sacriligious, or can their behavior be blamed on crowd in
fluence?
To determine what are the feelings and opinions behind such be
havior I took a poll of 155 students representing all groups from
freshmen girls to graduate men. I hoped to show through this survey
that this type of behavior is unbecoming at Stanford and that the
remarks are indeed a big problem.
Every group questioned said the remarks are made for these
reasons listed in order of significance: To be witty — To release
emotions — To gain attention — To gain acceptance of group — To
heighten self esteem.
Let us look at this reasoning in light of the examples that I gave:
Is this sacrilege witty? Is this emotional release healthy? Accord
ing to the students answers, yes, it is!
I COULD NOT BELIEVE this, and the students do not really
believe it either. When I asked them what kind of impression would
be conveyed by the remarks to people outside the university com
munity, the results were quite different. I gave them the same
choices as when I asked about their own personal reaction except
1 included also the choice — I don't care what they would think.
The answers were nearly reversed. In fact, the so popular choices
previously, namely that the remarks are amusing and appealing,
now ranked seventh and eighth instead of first and second. Only
the choice — They would not be affected — ranked lower. The sad
thing was that over a third of the students do not care what an out
sider might think. In a few years we are going to be this group out
side the Stanford community who would care and as we now say
ourselves in the following order of importance: We would be sur
prised — annoyed — abhorred — disillusioned — offended. Why
then are we now so entertained?
IN REALITY, WE ARE NOT all entertained. As the student
body affirmed, at most we condone the remarks. In fact, though 37
per cent of the students approve of the remarks 21 per cent dis
approve. One fifth of the students is a lot of nobody.
When I asked the students how they thought the majority felt
36 per cent still thought that most students approve, but on the con
trary. only 6 per cent would say they though most disapprove. This

misconception is in fact the root of the problem. A lot of students
do not like the remarks! But everyone just assumes there is no
problem and so nothing gels done about a problem that many of the
students would like to see eliminated.
IN FACT, WHEN I ASKED the students what position they
would take regarding action to stop the remarks, the split in opinion
was even more pronounced. I gave the students four choices — three
of these effectively could eliminate the remarks and the last would
insure that nothing woidd be done about the remarks. Forty nine
per cent of the response was for one of the three choices which could
stop the remarks, wilh the other 51 per cent in favor of no action.
The one rather loaded question of my poll tended to confirm that
the remarks have had bad reflection on the individual as such. My
question had eight attitudes for response. The two most popular
ones — That remarks are a healthy outlet for tension and that they
are clever and funny — are the response of the crowd as a mass,
not as individuals.
NOTE HOWEVER, the following response to five of the other
attitudes that must be an individual response. — 20 per cent: The
remarks show unconcern for propriety — 19 percent: They are dis
respectful to the feelings of others — 1.3 per cent: They damage the
public image of Stanford — 9 per cent: They show disrespect for
Cod — 9 per cent: They show disregard for morality.
These figures represent an average response of almost 1!) per
cent from individuals. Because this response is, and has to be an in
dividual response, it is significant. The crowd perhaps is amused by
the remarks, but the individual is often hurt by them.
Nom de Guerre once said, "It must be a very contemptible, im
mature philosophy that sanctions insidious crowd vulgarity and
ostentatious impropriety — at the expense of debasing the ethical
or moral philosophy of even the most paltry individual."

(EDITOR'S NOTE —The following article and the poll accom

Stanford student, to determine if the type of behavior which pre

By KEN LILLQUST
A Sunday evening flick—Christ is being taunted and beaten by the
soldiers, and, as he is lying in a heap, one of the soldiers shoves a
crown of thorns on his bleeding head. The picture isn't, complete
enough, so a Stanford student yells to Christ, "Get up you wimp."
The audience roars in response.
This is a typical happening. My question is: Are these same stu
dents who are apparently delighted with these remarks individuals
like myself who are selecting and forming the final ideals by which
they will eventually guide their lives? Are they really that hypocrit
ical and sacriligious, or can their behavior be blamed on crowd in
fluence?
To determine what are the feelings and opinions behind such be
havior I took a poll of 155 students representing all groups from
freshmen girls to graduate men. I hoped to show through this survey
that this type of behavior is unbecoming at Stanford and that the
remarks are indeed a big problem.
Every group questioned said the remarks are made for these
reasons listed in order of significance: To be witty — To release
emotions — To gain attention — To gain acceptance of group — To
heighten self esteem.
Let us look at this reasoning in light of the examples that I gave:
Is this sacrilege witty? Is this emotional release healthy? Accord
ing to the students answers, yes, it is!
I COULD NOT BELIEVE this, and the students do not really
believe it either. When I asked them what kind of impression would
be conveyed by the remarks to people outside the university com
munity, the results were quite different. I gave them the same
choices as when I asked about their own personal reaction except
1 included also the choice — I don't care what they would think.
The answers were nearly reversed. In fact, the so popular choices
previously, namely that the remarks are amusing and appealing,
now ranked seventh and eighth instead of first and second. Only
the choice — They would not be affected — ranked lower. The sad
thing was that over a third of the students do not care what an out
sider might think. In a few years we are going to be this group out
side the Stanford community who would care and as we now say
ourselves in the following order of importance: We would be sur
prised — annoyed — abhorred — disillusioned — offended. Why
then are we now so entertained?
IN REALITY, WE ARE NOT all entertained. As the student
body affirmed, at most we condone the remarks. In fact, though 37
per cent of the students approve of the remarks 21 per cent dis
approve. One fifth of the students is a lot of nobody.
When I asked the students how they thought the majority felt
36 per cent still thought that most students approve, but on the con
trary. only 6 per cent would say they though most disapprove. This

misconception is in fact the root of the problem. A lot of students
do not like the remarks! But everyone just assumes there is no
problem and so nothing gels done about a problem that many of the
students would like to see eliminated.
IN FACT, WHEN I ASKED the students what position they
would take regarding action to stop the remarks, the split in opinion
was even more pronounced. I gave the students four choices — three
of these effectively could eliminate the remarks and the last would
insure that nothing woidd be done about the remarks. Forty nine
per cent of the response was for one of the three choices which could
stop the remarks, wilh the other 51 per cent in favor of no action.
The one rather loaded question of my poll tended to confirm that
the remarks have had bad reflection on the individual as such. My
question had eight attitudes for response. The two most popular
ones — That remarks are a healthy outlet for tension and that they
are clever and funny — are the response of the crowd as a mass,
not as individuals.
NOTE HOWEVER, the following response to five of the other
attitudes that must be an individual response. — 20 per cent: The
remarks show unconcern for propriety — 19 percent: They are dis
respectful to the feelings of others — 1.3 per cent: They damage the
public image of Stanford — 9 per cent: They show disrespect for
Cod — 9 per cent: They show disregard for morality.
These figures represent an average response of almost 1!) per
cent from individuals. Because this response is, and has to be an in
dividual response, it is significant. The crowd perhaps is amused by
the remarks, but the individual is often hurt by them.
Nom de Guerre once said, "It must be a very contemptible, im
mature philosophy that sanctions insidious crowd vulgarity and
ostentatious impropriety — at the expense of debasing the ethical
or moral philosophy of even the most paltry individual."

(EDITOR'S NOTE —The following article and the poll accom
panying it are the result of an effort by the writer, Ken Lillquist, a
Stanford student, to determine if the type of behavior which pre
dominates at the showing of the flicks is condoned by the Stanford
student as an individual or silently approved as part of a crowd
response).
By KEN LILLQUST
A Sunday evening flick—Christ is being taunted and beaten by the
soldiers, and, as he is lying in a heap, one of the soldiers shoves a
crown of thorns on his bleeding head. The picture isn't, complete
enough, so a Stanford student yells to Christ, "Get up you wimp."
The audience roars in response.
This is a typical happening. My question is: Are these same stu
dents who are apparently delighted with these remarks individuals
like myself who are selecting and forming the final ideals by which
they will eventually guide their lives? Are they really that hypocrit
ical and sacriligious, or can their behavior be blamed on crowd in
fluence?
To determine what are the feelings and opinions behind such be
havior I took a poll of 155 students representing all groups from
freshmen girls to graduate men. I hoped to show through this survey
that this type of behavior is unbecoming at Stanford and that the
remarks are indeed a big problem.
Every group questioned said the remarks are made for these
reasons listed in order of significance: To be witty — To release
emotions — To gain attention — To gain acceptance of group — To
heighten self esteem.
Let us look at this reasoning in light of the examples that I gave:
Is this sacrilege witty? Is this emotional release healthy? Accord
ing to the students answers, yes, it is!
I COULD NOT BELIEVE this, and the students do not really
believe it either. When I asked them what kind of impression would
be conveyed by the remarks to people outside the university com
munity, the results were quite different. I gave them the same
choices as when I asked about their own personal reaction except
1 included also the choice — I don't care what they would think.
The answers were nearly reversed. In fact, the so popular choices
previously, namely that the remarks are amusing and appealing,
now ranked seventh and eighth instead of first and second. Only
the choice — They would not be affected — ranked lower. The sad
thing was that over a third of the students do not care what an out
sider might think. In a few years we are going to be this group out
side the Stanford community who would care and as we now say
ourselves in the following order of importance: We would be sur
prised — annoyed — abhorred — disillusioned — offended. Why
then are we now so entertained?
IN REALITY, WE ARE NOT all entertained. As the student
body affirmed, at most we condone the remarks. In fact, though 37
per cent of the students approve of the remarks 21 per cent dis
approve. One fifth of the students is a lot of nobody.
When I asked the students how they thought the majority felt
36 per cent still thought that most students approve, but on the con
trary. only 6 per cent would say they though most disapprove. This

misconception is in fact the root of the problem. A lot of students
do not like the remarks! But everyone just assumes there is no
problem and so nothing gels done about a problem that many of the
students would like to see eliminated.
IN FACT, WHEN I ASKED the students what position they
would take regarding action to stop the remarks, the split in opinion
was even more pronounced. I gave the students four choices — three
of these effectively could eliminate the remarks and the last would
insure that nothing woidd be done about the remarks. Forty nine
per cent of the response was for one of the three choices which could
stop the remarks, wilh the other 51 per cent in favor of no action.
The one rather loaded question of my poll tended to confirm that
the remarks have had bad reflection on the individual as such. My
question had eight attitudes for response. The two most popular
ones — That remarks are a healthy outlet for tension and that they
are clever and funny — are the response of the crowd as a mass,
not as individuals.
NOTE HOWEVER, the following response to five of the other
attitudes that must be an individual response. — 20 per cent: The
remarks show unconcern for propriety — 19 percent: They are dis
respectful to the feelings of others — 1.3 per cent: They damage the
public image of Stanford — 9 per cent: They show disrespect for
Cod — 9 per cent: They show disregard for morality.
These figures represent an average response of almost 1!) per
cent from individuals. Because this response is, and has to be an in
dividual response, it is significant. The crowd perhaps is amused by
the remarks, but the individual is often hurt by them.
Nom de Guerre once said, "It must be a very contemptible, im
mature philosophy that sanctions insidious crowd vulgarity and
ostentatious impropriety — at the expense of debasing the ethical
or moral philosophy of even the most paltry individual."

(EDITOR'S NOTE —The following article and the poll accom
panying it are the result of an effort by the writer, Ken Lillquist, a
Stanford student, to determine if the type of behavior which pre
dominates at the showing of the flicks is condoned by the Stanford
student as an individual or silently approved as part of a crowd
response).
By KEN LILLQUST
A Sunday evening flick—Christ is being taunted and beaten by the
soldiers, and, as he is lying in a heap, one of the soldiers shoves a
crown of thorns on his bleeding head. The picture isn't, complete
enough, so a Stanford student yells to Christ, "Get up you wimp."
The audience roars in response.
This is a typical happening. My question is: Are these same stu
dents who are apparently delighted with these remarks individuals
like myself who are selecting and forming the final ideals by which
they will eventually guide their lives? Are they really that hypocrit
ical and sacriligious, or can their behavior be blamed on crowd in
fluence?
To determine what are the feelings and opinions behind such be
havior I took a poll of 155 students representing all groups from
freshmen girls to graduate men. I hoped to show through this survey
that this type of behavior is unbecoming at Stanford and that the
remarks are indeed a big problem.
Every group questioned said the remarks are made for these
reasons listed in order of significance: To be witty — To release
emotions — To gain attention — To gain acceptance of group — To
heighten self esteem.
Let us look at this reasoning in light of the examples that I gave:
Is this sacrilege witty? Is this emotional release healthy? Accord
ing to the students answers, yes, it is!
I COULD NOT BELIEVE this, and the students do not really
believe it either. When I asked them what kind of impression would
be conveyed by the remarks to people outside the university com
munity, the results were quite different. I gave them the same
choices as when I asked about their own personal reaction except
1 included also the choice — I don't care what they would think.
The answers were nearly reversed. In fact, the so popular choices
previously, namely that the remarks are amusing and appealing,
now ranked seventh and eighth instead of first and second. Only
the choice — They would not be affected — ranked lower. The sad
thing was that over a third of the students do not care what an out
sider might think. In a few years we are going to be this group out
side the Stanford community who would care and as we now say
ourselves in the following order of importance: We would be sur
prised — annoyed — abhorred — disillusioned — offended. Why
then are we now so entertained?
IN REALITY, WE ARE NOT all entertained. As the student
body affirmed, at most we condone the remarks. In fact, though 37
per cent of the students approve of the remarks 21 per cent dis
approve. One fifth of the students is a lot of nobody.
When I asked the students how they thought the majority felt
36 per cent still thought that most students approve, but on the con
trary. only 6 per cent would say they though most disapprove. This

misconception is in fact the root of the problem. A lot of students
do not like the remarks! But everyone just assumes there is no
problem and so nothing gels done about a problem that many of the
students would like to see eliminated.
IN FACT, WHEN I ASKED the students what position they
would take regarding action to stop the remarks, the split in opinion
was even more pronounced. I gave the students four choices — three
of these effectively could eliminate the remarks and the last would
insure that nothing woidd be done about the remarks. Forty nine
per cent of the response was for one of the three choices which could
stop the remarks, wilh the other 51 per cent in favor of no action.
The one rather loaded question of my poll tended to confirm that
the remarks have had bad reflection on the individual as such. My
question had eight attitudes for response. The two most popular
ones — That remarks are a healthy outlet for tension and that they
are clever and funny — are the response of the crowd as a mass,
not as individuals.
NOTE HOWEVER, the following response to five of the other
attitudes that must be an individual response. — 20 per cent: The
remarks show unconcern for propriety — 19 percent: They are dis
respectful to the feelings of others — 1.3 per cent: They damage the
public image of Stanford — 9 per cent: They show disrespect for
Cod — 9 per cent: They show disregard for morality.
These figures represent an average response of almost 1!) per
cent from individuals. Because this response is, and has to be an in
dividual response, it is significant. The crowd perhaps is amused by
the remarks, but the individual is often hurt by them.
Nom de Guerre once said, "It must be a very contemptible, im
mature philosophy that sanctions insidious crowd vulgarity and
ostentatious impropriety — at the expense of debasing the ethical
or moral philosophy of even the most paltry individual."
