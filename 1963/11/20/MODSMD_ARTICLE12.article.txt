INTERFERENCE
WITH THE MARKET
Editor, The Daily:
On Monday morning the uni
versity witnessed what may be a
classic example of the disadvan
tages of interference with the
operations of a market. A limited
number of student season tickets
to the basketball games were
available and were put on sale
at 8:30. The fact that they were
sold rather than given out by lot
tery or some other means of ra
tioning implies that the univer
sity intended to distribute the
tickets through the normal opera
tions of a market, which was to
be restricted to students and fac
ulty. In its misguided attempt
to be kind to the students, how
ever, a price (apx. 62c per game)
was set which was far below that
which would clear the market.
The obvious result was that far
more people wanted tickets than
could get them; luck and the will
ingness to cut a class to stand in
line for two hours became the
deciding factors, rather than the
more desirable criterion of a will
ingness to pay a price determined
by the market's equating of the
number of buyers and tickets.
The purpose of a price is to
ration scarce goods among poten
tial users; to the extent that it
fails to do so, the goal of distri
buting the goods to those express
ing the greatest interest in hav
ing them is not reached. It might
be argued that this interest is
expressed by the willingness to
stand in line for two hours; the
time then becomes part of the
price. The disadvantages of hav
ing a large number of students
waste two hours and perhaps
miss a class, while the university
effectively throws away a good
deal of money (which might be
used to help build a new pavilion
which would end the whole prob
lem) seem obvious. If the univer
sity is determined to sell the
tickets below the market price,
a lottery would avoid the neces
sity of wasting the better part
of a morning. A more reason
able solution would be to set a
price of $1.00 or slightly more
per game, and allow the market
to ration the tickets.

MONEY CHANGES IN
THEATER
Editor, The Daily:
In a ludicrous posture the
money changers have entered the
arena of theater at Stanford. The
recruitment of John Kerr for the
Hamlet role can be seen only as

an effort to increase box office
receipts. One of educational thea
tre's primary responsibilities is
to prepare the aspirant actor for
work in professional theatre by
allowing him to perform import
ant and challenging parts. It must
not become a pleasant workshop
for one professionally engaged in
acting whether he is talented or
not.
Lamentably, an ideal university
theater climate does not prevail
at Stanford because a lack of
talented student participation in
its productions requires that Stan
ford Players solicit free talent
from the Palo Alto area. This is
well and good, and the Players
could have found such a talented
person for Hamlet.
However, the problem has been
compounded. It seems to me that
the Stanford community would
delight to see staged a play less
ambitious than "Hamlet" if it
could be assured a forceful, ener
getic production of an easier yet
recognizably good script which
would challenge its cast but not
overwhelm it. An entertaining
and unembarrassing evening
would result. "Hamlet" is a giant
in the house of dramatic litera
ture and should rather be allowed
to loom greatly in the imagina
tion than, in walking the boards,
to be represented as a dwarf.

WHERE IS RUSSELL KIRK?
Editor, The Daily:
Where's Rusell Kirk? Profes
sor Eulau's recent harangue not
withstanding, Mr. Kirk remains
one of the most articulate and
knowledgeable spokesmen for the
conservative movement in this
country. While I realize that criti
cizing Walter Lippmann is seen
by many as analagous to attack
ing motherhood, Mr. Kirk seemed
a suitable and welcome replace
ment. But I would be the first
to admit that two columns aren't
enough on which to base a judg
ment. Let's have some more.

GREEN WATER
Editor, The Daily:
Green water. I like to watch
bubble and gurgle merrily. I like
to watch it cascade down the
sides of our beautiful Library
Fountain. Green water — rich in
life and energy — isn't it wonder
ful? Sterlie, unaesthetic, unin
spiring — clear water fountains
surely leave something to be de
sired!
