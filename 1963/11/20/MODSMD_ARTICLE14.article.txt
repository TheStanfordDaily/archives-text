# Three Teams Have Chance for Roses
## 
### 
Thanks to UCLA's upset vic
tory over Washington's Huskies
ihe AAWU Rose Bowl picture is
now a toss-up among three teams.
The University of Washington,
the University of Southern Cali
fornia, and UC at Los Angeles all
have an equal chance of playing
New Year's Day in the big howl
at Pasadena. Games this week
end will tell the story.
Washington, leading Ihe way
for most of the season, was
thought of as a "shoe in" after
their, 22-7, victory over Southern
California. But with Iheir loss
to the Bruins the upcoming game
with Washington State takes on
extra importance. If the Huskies
lose the winner of the USC vs.
UCLA contest will represent the
West in the Rose Bowl. If t lie
Huskies win it will be a toss up.
THE USC-I'CEA rivalry needs
little added incentive to spur the
Trojans and Bruins on to their
best efforts. The winner of this
game will have at least a SO-SO
chance of going to the Rose Bowl.
If both USC and Washington
win, the invitation could go to
either school. Washington has
the better league record, but
Southern Cal has the better over

all record and has had a much
tougher schedule.
A UCLA win would make it
just as difficult a task to pick
the AAWU representative. Wash
ington has the better record in
both conference and overall but
the Bruins did defeat the Huskies
iast week.
Till: DECISION will be made
after the weekend's games when
the Faculty Representatives of
the member schools vote by tele
graph. AAWU Executive Direc
tor, Tom Hamilton, will announce
the results Monday, November 25.

Thanks to UCLA's upset vic
tory over Washington's Huskies
ihe AAWU Rose Bowl picture is
now a toss-up among three teams.
The University of Washington,
the University of Southern Cali
fornia, and UC at Los Angeles all
have an equal chance of playing
New Year's Day in the big howl
at Pasadena. Games this week
end will tell the story.
Washington, leading Ihe way
for most of the season, was
thought of as a "shoe in" after
their, 22-7, victory over Southern
California. But with Iheir loss
to the Bruins the upcoming game
with Washington State takes on
extra importance. If the Huskies
lose the winner of the USC vs.
UCLA contest will represent the
West in the Rose Bowl. If t lie
Huskies win it will be a toss up.
THE USC-I'CEA rivalry needs
little added incentive to spur the
Trojans and Bruins on to their
best efforts. The winner of this
game will have at least a SO-SO
chance of going to the Rose Bowl.
If both USC and Washington
win, the invitation could go to
either school. Washington has
the better league record, but
Southern Cal has the better over

all record and has had a much
tougher schedule.
A UCLA win would make it
just as difficult a task to pick
the AAWU representative. Wash
ington has the better record in
both conference and overall but
the Bruins did defeat the Huskies
iast week.
