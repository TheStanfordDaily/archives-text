# Stat's Race is Tight
## 
### 
With onr> week to play during
t ho 1963 season, two AAWU in
dividual crowns arc still far from
placed on tho athletes who would
be kings. These are in the im
portant categories of scoring and
receiving, where iho leads have
changed hands many times this
season.
In scoring, last week's leader
Willie RroW'n of I JSC, is now tied
for the lead with early-season
leader Dick Ragsdale of Stanford.
They each have tallied 38 points,
while five players have at least
32 points, so this category could
he won by any one of a number
of players.
The other tight race sees Brown
leading, but by a most slim mar
gin. The Trojan senior has caught
31 passes to 30 for WSU's Gerry

i Shaw, and again there are sev
eral others within reach.
Cal's Craig Morton retained
big leads in total offense an d
passing. Mike Garrett, of IJSC
is now a near-cinch to be the
j third sophomore in succession lo
lead the Conference in rushing,
and Ernie Jones appears to have
successfully defended his punting
; championship.
