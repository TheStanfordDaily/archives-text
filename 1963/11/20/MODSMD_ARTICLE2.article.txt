# Football Haters Stage Fifty Yard Line Sit-in
## 
### 
CHICAGO <CPS> â€” The Uni
versity of Chicago's Stagg Field
looked more like Birmingham
than a football arean last Friday,
as 200 students delayed and ham
pered a game for two hours by
siting-in across the fifty-yard line.
The sit-in. which had been
threatened on several earlier oc
casions. was finally triggered by
an announcement Thursday that
CBS-TV would film the game be
tween Chicago and North Cen
tral College. The demonstration,
its sponsors said, was to protest
the "undue publicity" the broad
cast would give football at the
University.
Demonstrators carried signs
reading "Ban Ihe Ball," and "No
Big Ten. No Little Ten, No Mid
dle Ten."
