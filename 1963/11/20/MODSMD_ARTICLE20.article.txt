Despite the elements KA and
the Law School played their semi
final intramural football game
yesterday.
Shooting for their eighteenth
vietory in a row ami their second
consecutive foot hn 11 champion
ship the Law School was shut
out by the KA's, 12-U.
A big reason for the KA win
was the defensive line play which
has limited the last l'our oppo

of the forward wall have be en
John Beman, Tom Yantes, a n d
Dick Wilson.
Offensively the KA team was
lead by passer Joe Mueller. Muel
