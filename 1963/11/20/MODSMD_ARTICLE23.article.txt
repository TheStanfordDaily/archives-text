# Wisconsin Bill 'Spells Out' Power to Ban Speakers
## 
### 
A bill was introduced in the
Wisconsin State Legislature last
week to "spell out" to University
students the Board of Regents'
authority to ban speakers and
groups from campus, according
to the Wisconsin Daily Cardinal.
Nile Soik (R.-Whitefish Bay)
introduced a bill patterned after
one passed by the Ohio legisla
ture in October. It was unani
mously approved for introduction
into the Assembly by the seven
man Rules Committee. Soik has

raised the question to prevent a
repetition at the University of
Wisconsin of a student "upris
ing" against the Ohio State ad
ministration when that adminis
tration banned a liberal speaker
from a convention on the O.S.U.
campus, the Cardinal continued.
The Regents already have the
authority to regulate speakers
using University facilities, but
Soik stressed that he lias brought
up I he bill so that "the students
realize that they (the Regents)
have the authority."
In a recent local television ap
pearance, Soik said: "We should
not provide a platform in o u r
schools and colleges for Commu
nist spokesmen who seek to de
stroy us."
