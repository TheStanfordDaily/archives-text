# Senate Debates College Aid Bill

### 
WASHINGTON (CPS> The
College Construction Aid Bill
awaiting final Senate action is
vastly different than what meets
the eye.
Superficially, Ihe bill to help
build college and university fa
cilities authorizes loans and
grants of $1.2 billion.
At first glance, it authorizes
loans and grants to all higher
education institutions only to
build classrooms for natural or
physical sciences, engineering,
mathematics, modern foreign
languages and libraries. A closer
look shows the facilities built
with the federal funds can be
used for any academic courses
except for "sectarian instruction
or religious worship."
The two points illustrate the
deviousness of congress when it
is fighting for a program and try
ing at the same time to avoid
bluntly offending its opponents.
The last lino assures the pro
gram of reaching about $2 bil
lion in five years unless congress
took the unlikely position of kill
ing the program in its fourth
year.
The hidden price tag, however,
is not as upsetting to the bill's
critics as is the "carte blanche"
of use for federally constructed
classrooms.
Their use in the eye of a con
gressional hurricane over federal
control or support of church con
nected colleges and universities
the same church-state debate
willing all aid to education pro
grams since 1960.
