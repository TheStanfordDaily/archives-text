### BILLY WERTZ 
The Department of Justice and
the Federal Bureau of Investiga
tion have cleared the San Fran
cisco Police Department of charges
of brutality to Negroes, it was
learned today.
Cecil Poole, Department of Jus
tice attorney in charge of the in
vestigation of the case, reported
that the charges leveled at San
Francisco police by the Negro
Students Association had proved
"completely groundless."
THE NSA, at a mass rally at
San Francisco State College, had
protested against police brutality
and had urged violent reaction
from other Negroes. Several ex
amples of police brutality were
cited by NSA speakers. The in
cident which the NSA empha
sized most was one which in
volved the Johnson family of 609
Excelsior avenue in San Fran
cisco and 14 San Francisco police
men.
Regarding this incident, speaker
Saundra Pirtle, a pro-law student
at SFSC, quoted a member of the
Johnson family who described the
police as "a Hitler-like army who
terrorized families."
Miss Pirtle urged a violent dem
onstration. "We're going to
fight," she said. "We've got no
rights. We've got to fight for our
rights. We're going to have to
see blood to get our rights."
THE NEXT DAY, over 150 stu
dents, calling themselves the Ad
Hoc committee for action against
police brutality, marched 2 1 .-
miles through the streets of San
Francisco to the city hall, where
they presented the Police Chief
with three demands. These de
mands included the dropping of
all charges against the Johnson
family, the prosecution of the 14
police officers, and the compen
sation of the Johnson family for
their suffering and inconvenience.
Police Chief Call ill told the pro
test that the matter had been
referred to the FBI and the
Police Community Relations
Board who handle all such mat
ters.
