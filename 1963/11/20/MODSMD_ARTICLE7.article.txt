# Three-Nation Study Project Holds Meeting in Caucasus

(EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first of a series of three articles
by .Margaret Rose, graduate student in Russian, who participated
in a work and study project in the USSR last year.)
The American Friends Service Committee. The Friends Service
Council on Youth Organizations in the USSR have jointly designed
the Tri-Partite Work and Study Project.
This is a unique experiment among Anglo-Soviet and Soviet-
American cultural programs. Representatives from only three

nations attend the camp in con
trast to lhe usual multi-nation
Soviet cultural projects. The dis
cussion sessions are noi open to
the public media; instead they
are conducted privately among
the thirty participants. Also, the
project has a different site each
year: in 1962, ten Americans, ten
British and ten Russians met in
Bristol, England; in 19(53. the fif
teen men and fifteen women met
in the Caucasus Mountain region
of the Autonomous Republic of
Kalbardina-Balkaria; in 1964, the
participants will work and dis
cuss somewhere in the United
States (very likely in the North
ern California area).
Although each host nation
plans the details of the program,
certain fundamental conditions
always apply. In addition to the
privacy provision, it is held that
there shall be ten participants,
five men and five women be
tween the ages of 20 and 30, from
each country; that no more than
three persons in each delegation
will participate in two consecu
tive Tri-Partite Camps; and that
participants will spend time to
gether in at least one major city.
The design of the program clear
ly emphasizes the importance of
environment in which study and
discussion take place. The work
project provides a shared, non
intellectual experience, and pri
vacy insures an atmosphere fa
vorable to uninhibited expression
of ideas.
THK SITK OF the 1963 Tri-Par
tite Project in the Soviet Union
was a large Pioneer Camp about
ten miles from Nalchik, capital ot
the Autonomous Republic. We
seldom had access to the town
but lived day to day in the coun
try setting of the camp grounds.
Five minutes in one direction
from the camp was a Pioneer
Camp in session (with which we
had minimal contact >. In the
other direction, 20 minutes away
on foot, was a small Kalbardin
ian village.

representing Russian. Ukrainian,
Georgian and Kalbardinian na
tionalities, were chosen by the
Committee on Youth Organiza
tions. Of the participants, five
spoke English very well, two
fairly well and three not at all.
Two knew Bengali, one Thai, an
other Chinese and still others
French and German.
WITH A FI2W exceptions, they
represented a core of the bright
intellectual minds of the genera
tion coming of age in the USSR.
They were all convinced Marxist-
Leninists, but varied in sophisti
cation when discussing its prin
ciples and programs. At least
five of them had critically juxta
posed what they had been taught
with their own thoughts, the re
alities of their society and pros
pects for the future. These par
ticular Soviet students and re
search workers contributed great
ly to the originality and depth of
our discussions. The other mem
bers of the Soviet delegation were
less imaginative in their Marxist-
Leninism, but held or aspired to
significant positions in their so
ciety.
It appears that the Committee
on Youth Organizations sends
very capable representatives not
only to impress, as we frequently
conclude, but also because they
consider it important that some
of their would-be leaders experi
ence western behavior and modes
of thought. Perhaps it is signifi
cant that the Soviet participants
were students of politics, lan
guages, education, economics and
youth work all occupations in
which knowledge of different
kinds of people is very important.
American and British represen
tatives were chosen by the AFSC
and FSC. respectively. We aver
aged younger in age than the So
viets and were less advanced in
our studies. This was not disad
vantageous, but a few more par
ticipants in graduate study or ex
perienced in public life might
have been a valuable addition.
