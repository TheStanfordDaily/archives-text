# Vorster Terms NUSAS 'Red Cancer'
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL International Student Affairs Editor 
Conflict between Justice Minis
ter B. J. Vorster and the National
Union of South African Students
heightened in late September
when Vorster charged NUSAS
with being a "Red cancer."
NUSAS had been under attack
from the South African govern
ment because of its stand against
the government policy of apart
heid.
IN Ills STATEMENT in the
September 29th Johannesburg
Sunday Express, Vorster claimed
that "to any unprejudiced mind
I have clearly substantiated my
charge that NUSAS has become
the mouthpiece of Leftists and
Liberalists, that ii is tainted with
Communism and has been 112 or
many years."
"TIIE EEADEKS of NUSAS,
for at least the past twenty-five
years, have practically all joined
up with the Liberal Party or the
Communist Party after leaving
college. Not all member* of
NUSAS are Communist*, l>ut all

! Communists are members a n d
supporters of NUSAS."
"The minutes of this year's
NUSAS conference showed that
it still maintains close co-opera
( 1 ion and cordial relations with
Communist and anti-South Afri
can sludent organizations around
the world."
I (Mi YEARS SINCE lft 15. Vor
ster asserted, NUSAS has been
affiliated to an "out-and-out"
Communist organization, the In
, ternational Union of Students.
"Most Western universities
broke away from the lUS as
early a* IiMS, but NUSAS, al
though warned by some of its
own delegates, refused. Ii eventu
ally did so in 1953 under great
pressure, only to apply again for
associate membership in 195-1
well knowing that it was a Com
munist organization."
"OI'ERATINtJ I N l> E R th e
mask of service to student com
i munities. it is in fact striving to
undermine the very basis of our
â–  way of life."
The NUSAS point-by-point re
buttal to Vorster, printed in the
Uloemfonlein Friend of October

1, was drafted by the NUSAS
President. Jonty Driver, and its
vice president, Kenny Parker.
TIIEY STATED THAT NUSAS
does not have compulsory mem
bership: "at most NUSAS cen
ters, the S.R.C.'s have decided
that enrollment should be auto
malic. although students may re
sign and get back their subscrip
tions (fifteen cents annuallyt."
The reply said NUSAS "has
never condemned any political
party as such. It condemns the
policies of any political party
when il feels those policies are
not in the interests of students.
NUSAS has not adopted the pol
icy of the liberal or any other
party."
"NUSAS HAS BEEN one of
the strongest supporters of the
non-Communist International Stu
dents' Conference since it* incep
tion in 1950. And NUSAS h a d
relations with the anti-Commu
nist student body in Hungary,
not Ihe Communist one."
The statement pointed out that
NUSAS is the only national union
of student* in South Africa be
cause il is the only students' as

soeiation open to all students.
"II is recognized by the non-
Communist International Student
Conference as the only national
union in South Africa."
The so-called "mask of service
to student communities," they
replied, includes Overseas and
local lours; employment for stu
dents duiing vacations iNUSAS
placed over four hundred stu
dents at the University of Cape
town in 19621; scholarships for
study overseas and in South
Africa; a loan fund for needy stu
dents; discounts at shops and eon
cessions to theaters; tutorial
plans; night schools; and wel
fare* projects.
TI! 101 < ON( "If Mr.
Vorster thinks NUSAS is either
Communist-controlled or engaged
in subversion, we hope he will
bring NUSAS and its officers be
fore the courts. We certainly
have nothing to be afraid of since
all we do is open and above
board."
Tomorrow: NUSAS office is
raided and NUSAS becomes em
broiled in a controversy with
(lie national radio station.
