# Kerr: University Becomes Multiversity in America
## 
### MIKE WAGGONER Associate Editor 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the second in a scries of articles
dealing with the relation between the Federal Government and
higher education, and Stanford's place in this relationship.)
One of Clark Kerr's Gocikin lectures delivered at Harvard last
spring was a description of the modern American university, or
multiversity. This lecture is reprinted in the November issue of
"Harpers." His picture of the multiversity is a good frame of refer
ence for a discussion of the problem of the federal government and

higher education.
This article will present Kerr's
lecture in so free and selective
a summary that he cannot be
blamed for it.
KERR BEGINS HIS lecture by
discussing two universities which
the multiversity is not. The multi
versity is not 18th-19th century
Oxford, an academic cloister dedi
cated to raising the tone of so
ciety and educating its students
"to fill any post with credit, and
to master any subject with facil
ity." This concept of a univer
sity does still exist, however.
But it is the concept only of a
section of the undergraduate edu
cation, and not of the entire multi
versity.
The multiversity is not 19th
Century Berlin, "an organism
characterized by highness an d
definiteness of aim, unity of
spirit and purpose." The German
university was dedicated to "the
pursuit of knowledge, the solu
tion of problems, the critical ap
preciation of achievement and the
training of men at a high level."
This meant a concentration on
the graduate schools, solid pro
fessional schools, and certain re
search institutes. The cause of
the change from the Oxford type
of university was the appearance
of the forces of science and na
tionalism. No longer could a man

make all knowledge his province;
and there was a duty to act be
yond the cloister. Germ a ny
served as a model for world high
er education.
The multiversity developed in
America from the influences of
the German model and the Land
Grant College Act of 1862. a 11 d
its succesors. The American uni
versity became more democratic
than the German university, and
it dealt with even more practical
subjects on a less intellectual
basis - agriculture and business
administration.
AROUND THE TURN of the
century universities became ac
tive in politics: Wilson was Presi
dent of Princeton as well as the
U.S., and the University of Wis
consin served as a brain-trust for
Lofollette. The universities began
offering extension courses on a
broad scale. In the 1920'5, spec
tator sports were added to the
universities' functions.
Thus, the considerable contri
bution to the defense effort and,
with the help of federal grants,
the vast increase in scientific re
search by the university during
and since the second world war
are only a step in the creation of
the American contribution to
higher education, the multiver
sity. Though inconsistent with
the classical view of a university
and with parts inconsistent with
each other, the multiversity has
its logic in its history and in its
tradtion of social service.
Much has changed due to the
multiversity. Its diversity,
coupled with specialization of dis
ciplines, have encouraged splits
within the academic community,
such as that between the humani
ties and sciences.
ITS DIVERSITY OF roles and
geography (many universities
have campuses spread all over
the world) coupled with its blend
ing into society via extension
courses and consulting have left
its primary distinguishing char
acteristic its name. "The name
stands for a certain level of qual
ity, a certain degree of respect,
a certain historical legacy . . .
Protection and enhancement of.
the prestige of the name are cen
tral to the multiversity." This
has probably accentuated the
concentration on research, as it
is that which builds a name fast
est.
Kerr presents a many-part de
fense of the mu 11 ivers i t y.
Whether one accepts his case or
not, one must accept his presenta
tion of the multiversity's history.
It may be possible and desireable
to change the multiversity, but
its history and its consistency
with surounding society indicate
that this would require a major
revolution. Consideration of such
a revolution is beyond the scope
of these articles.
UNFORTUNATELY, J nave 110
analysis of Kerr's caliber of the
liberal arts college. Such an anal
ysis is needed for dicussion of
the concentration of Federal
funds at a few multiversities.
