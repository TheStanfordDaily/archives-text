A Theology of Happy Moments
WHY "MOMENTS"?-
BECAUSE God gives experiences of unplanned happiness
which, while fleeting, are disclosures of an eternal reality, and
which strengthen us to live by fciith the rest of the time.
1.
HAPPINESS IS AN INTUITION THAT
GOD IS-and that HE IS GOOD
Expressed in the Charlie Schultz manner, this might come out
as: "HAPPINESS IS SAND AND SURF—-with a picture of Lucy
standing on a sand dune covered with iceplant, and Schroeder
listening to the background music of the breakers on the shore.
If you are theologically articulate, you might say: "But there
is nothing Christologiccil about this." And someone else might
reply: "Does there have to be?" We have a word for both
these people. And our Campus address is: P.O. Box 7844.
