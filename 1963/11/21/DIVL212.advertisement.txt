MAN IS INCURABLY RELIGIOUS
Man is always questing for something to fill that empty place inside which Cod
has designed to be filled only by His Holy Spirit. Often he tries to fill this need
(always unsuccessfully) with idolatrous substitutes. The idol is whatever claims
the loyalty which belongs to Cod alone. lidolatry is not a stage fin the way to a
pure knowledge of Cod. or an indication of increased enlightenment, but a decline
from true spirituality.
"Since earliest times men have seen the earth and sky and all God made, and have
known of His existence and great eternal power. So they have no excuse for saying
they don't know whether or not there is a Cod. Yes. they knew about Him all right,
but they wouldn't admit it or worship Him or even thank Him for all His daily
care. And after a while they lx-gan lo think up silly ideas of what Cod was like
and what lie wanted them to do. The r< suit was that their foolish minds became
dark and confused. Claiming themselves to be wise without Cod. they became utter
fools instead. And then, instead of worshipping the glorious ever-living Cod. they
took wood and stone and made idols for themselves, carving them to look like birds
and animals and snakes and puny men. and said that these were the great, eternal
God, and worshipped them." Rom. 1 :20-2.> L.L.
Patterns of idolatry which are rampant today include:
The Idolatry of Money -
-Those who want to be rich fall into temptations and snares and many foolish harm
ful desires which plunge men into ruin and perdition. The love of money is the root
of all evil things, and there are some, who in reaching for it. have wandered from
the faith and spiked themselves on many thorny griefs." I Tim. 6:9-10 NE
The Idolatry of Pleasure—
"Then you lived in licence and debauchery, drunkenness, riot, and tippling, and
the forbidden worship of idols. Now. when you can no longer plunge with them I
into all this reckless dissipation, they cannot understand it .arid they vilify you I
accordingly; but they shall answer for il to him who stands ready to pass judgment I
on the living and the dead." 1 Pit. 4:4-6 N K
The Idolatry of Tradition
("Jesus said:) This people pays me lip-service, but their heart is far from me
their worship of me is in vain, for they teach as doctrines the commandments of
men. You neglect the commandment of Cod in order to maintain the tradition of
men. . . . Thus, by your own tradition, handed down among you, you make Cod's
word null and void!" Mark 7:0-1.! NE
I The Idolatry of Self
"Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, the other a publican.
The Pharisee stood and prayed thtis with himself. Cod, I thank thee, that I am not
as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast
twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing
afar off. would not lift up so much as bis eves into heaven, saving, Cod be merciful
to me a sinner. I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the
other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbletb
' himself shall be exalted." Luke 18:10 14 KJ
j Idolatry slips in unnoticed until we stop to realize how success, reputation, and
fortune have begun to mean more to lis than Jesiis Christ and His eternal truth. We
may not be literally bowing flown to statues, but our devotion to the perishable things j
of this material world and to man-centered concepts is idolatry. Cod's attitude
toward idolatry h;is never i banged, and a terrible fate awaits the idolatrous:
"He that overcometh shall inherit all tilings; and I will be his God, and he shall be
m> son. Hut the fearful, the nnbclii % iiik. and the abominable, and murderers, and
whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in
the lake which burnetii with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." Kev.
21:7 BKJ
"And we know that the Son of Cod is come, and hath given us an understanding,
| that we may knov. linn that is true, and wr .ire in him that is true, even in his Son.
Jesus Christ. This is the true 'iod, and eternal life. Little children, keep yourself

MAN IS INCURABLY RELIGIOUS
Man is always questing for something to fill that empty place inside which Cod
has designed to be filled only by His Holy Spirit. Often he tries to fill this need
(always unsuccessfully) with idolatrous substitutes. The idol is whatever claims
the loyalty which belongs to Cod alone. lidolatry is not a stage fin the way to a
pure knowledge of Cod. or an indication of increased enlightenment, but a decline
from true spirituality.
"Since earliest times men have seen the earth and sky and all God made, and have
known of His existence and great eternal power. So they have no excuse for saying
they don't know whether or not there is a Cod. Yes. they knew about Him all right,
but they wouldn't admit it or worship Him or even thank Him for all His daily
care. And after a while they lx-gan lo think up silly ideas of what Cod was like
and what lie wanted them to do. The r< suit was that their foolish minds became
dark and confused. Claiming themselves to be wise without Cod. they became utter
fools instead. And then, instead of worshipping the glorious ever-living Cod. they
took wood and stone and made idols for themselves, carving them to look like birds
and animals and snakes and puny men. and said that these were the great, eternal
God, and worshipped them." Rom. 1 :20-2.> L.L.
Patterns of idolatry which are rampant today include:
The Idolatry of Money -
-Those who want to be rich fall into temptations and snares and many foolish harm
ful desires which plunge men into ruin and perdition. The love of money is the root
of all evil things, and there are some, who in reaching for it. have wandered from
the faith and spiked themselves on many thorny griefs." I Tim. 6:9-10 NE
The Idolatry of Pleasure—
"Then you lived in licence and debauchery, drunkenness, riot, and tippling, and
the forbidden worship of idols. Now. when you can no longer plunge with them I
into all this reckless dissipation, they cannot understand it .arid they vilify you I
accordingly; but they shall answer for il to him who stands ready to pass judgment I
on the living and the dead." 1 Pit. 4:4-6 N K
The Idolatry of Tradition
("Jesus said:) This people pays me lip-service, but their heart is far from me
their worship of me is in vain, for they teach as doctrines the commandments of
men. You neglect the commandment of Cod in order to maintain the tradition of
men. . . . Thus, by your own tradition, handed down among you, you make Cod's
word null and void!" Mark 7:0-1.! NE
I The Idolatry of Self
"Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, the other a publican.
The Pharisee stood and prayed thtis with himself. Cod, I thank thee, that I am not
as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast
twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing
afar off. would not lift up so much as bis eves into heaven, saving, Cod be merciful

MAN IS INCURABLY RELIGIOUS
Man is always questing for something to fill that empty place inside which Cod
has designed to be filled only by His Holy Spirit. Often he tries to fill this need
(always unsuccessfully) with idolatrous substitutes. The idol is whatever claims
the loyalty which belongs to Cod alone. lidolatry is not a stage fin the way to a
pure knowledge of Cod. or an indication of increased enlightenment, but a decline
from true spirituality.
"Since earliest times men have seen the earth and sky and all God made, and have
known of His existence and great eternal power. So they have no excuse for saying
they don't know whether or not there is a Cod. Yes. they knew about Him all right,
but they wouldn't admit it or worship Him or even thank Him for all His daily
care. And after a while they lx-gan lo think up silly ideas of what Cod was like
and what lie wanted them to do. The r< suit was that their foolish minds became
dark and confused. Claiming themselves to be wise without Cod. they became utter
fools instead. And then, instead of worshipping the glorious ever-living Cod. they
took wood and stone and made idols for themselves, carving them to look like birds
and animals and snakes and puny men. and said that these were the great, eternal
God, and worshipped them." Rom. 1 :20-2.> L.L.
Patterns of idolatry which are rampant today include:
The Idolatry of Money -
-Those who want to be rich fall into temptations and snares and many foolish harm

of all evil things, and there are some, who in reaching for it. have wandered from
