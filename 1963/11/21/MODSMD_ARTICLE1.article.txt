# NUSAS Called Communist; Security Police Raid Office
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL International Student Affairs Editor (Third in a series) 
The Capetown Office of the National Union of Students was
raided by the Security Police less than three weeks after NL'SAS
had challenged South African Minister of Justice B. J. Vorster to
prove his allegation that NUSAS is Communist.
Vorster, who has led the government attack on NUSAS, had made

his allegation in a statement re
leased to the Johannesburg Sun
day Express September 29.
IX THE raid, the police con
fiscated several publications re
ceived by NUSAS and read all
the correspondence in the office.
The publications included maga
zines on youth affairs, an analy
sis of the attitude of the Commu
nist Party towards religion, an
analysis of Communist front
youth organizations, and resolu
tions of the seventh lUS i Com
munist-backed student group >
Congress. Also taken were two
publications on the ninety-day
clause of the General Law
Amendment Act.
A statement released that day
from the NUSAS president to the
Cape Times stated: "There is no
point in getting hysterical about
this raid. Mr. Vorster tried to
damage NUSAS by using inaccu
rate information. lie has obvi
ously failed. In an attempt to get
damaging information, the Spe
cial Branch raided our offices,
taking away eight publications,
most of which, although a bo u t
communism, are written by non
communists."
"IF THIS is an attempt to
frighten us, it has not succeeded
and it will never succeed. What
NUSAS stands for - academic
freedom and human freedom, the
right of students to be involved
in their society and to criticize it,
the Universal Declaration of Hu
man Rights is not going to be
damaged by police raids or Minis
terial attacks.
NUSAS has also been recently
embroiled in a controversy about
their use of broadcast time on
South African radio. The South
Africa Broadcasting Corporation
had allowed NUSAS to reply to
attack by Ivor Benson.
Immediately following the state

ment by NUSAS, the Corporation
broadcasted Vorster's attack of
NUSAS (cited earlier in this ser
ies from the Johannesburg Sun
day Express) to give "equal
prominence to both statements."
NUSAS's reply to Vorster w a s
covered the next morning in the
Corporation's national news bulle
tins.

fense of NUSAS in three national
news bulletins the Corporation
felt that it was unnecessary to
prolong the controversy by giving
NUSAS further air time, particu
larly in view of the fact that
NUSAS found a strange ally in
Moscow Radio and in the Russian
Communist mouthpiece. Pravda,
|which | commended NUSAS in
its quarrel with the Minister of
Justice."
NUSAS President replied, in a
letter dated November 5. that
"the recording by NUSAS was a
reply to an attack made by Mr.
Benson. When NUSAS recorded
that reply, it had no knowledge
that the Corporation intended to

not even been made when 1 h e

He continued that he was "puz

NUSAS found a 'strange ally' in
Moscow Radio and Pravda."
"I would point out that the Na
tional Unions of Students of the
United States, Scotland, Britain

all condemned the Minister's at
tacks on NUSAS, and have sup
ported NUSAS in its policies. Do

The Capetown Office of the National Union of Students was
raided by the Security Police less than three weeks after NL'SAS
had challenged South African Minister of Justice B. J. Vorster to
prove his allegation that NUSAS is Communist.
Vorster, who has led the government attack on NUSAS, had made

his allegation in a statement re
leased to the Johannesburg Sun
day Express September 29.
IX THE raid, the police con
fiscated several publications re
ceived by NUSAS and read all
the correspondence in the office.
The publications included maga
zines on youth affairs, an analy
sis of the attitude of the Commu
nist Party towards religion, an
analysis of Communist front
youth organizations, and resolu
tions of the seventh lUS i Com
munist-backed student group >
Congress. Also taken were two
publications on the ninety-day
clause of the General Law
Amendment Act.
A statement released that day
from the NUSAS president to the
Cape Times stated: "There is no
point in getting hysterical about
this raid. Mr. Vorster tried to
damage NUSAS by using inaccu
rate information. lie has obvi
ously failed. In an attempt to get
damaging information, the Spe
cial Branch raided our offices,
taking away eight publications,
most of which, although a bo u t
communism, are written by non
communists."
"IF THIS is an attempt to
frighten us, it has not succeeded
and it will never succeed. What
NUSAS stands for - academic
freedom and human freedom, the
right of students to be involved
in their society and to criticize it,
the Universal Declaration of Hu

damaged by police raids or Minis

NUSAS has also been recently
embroiled in a controversy about
their use of broadcast time on
South African radio. The South
Africa Broadcasting Corporation
had allowed NUSAS to reply to
attack by Ivor Benson.
Immediately following the state

broadcasted Vorster's attack of
NUSAS (cited earlier in this ser

prominence to both statements."

The Capetown Office of the National Union of Students was
raided by the Security Police less than three weeks after NL'SAS
had challenged South African Minister of Justice B. J. Vorster to
prove his allegation that NUSAS is Communist.
Vorster, who has led the government attack on NUSAS, had made

his allegation in a statement re
leased to the Johannesburg Sun
day Express September 29.
IX THE raid, the police con
fiscated several publications re
ceived by NUSAS and read all
the correspondence in the office.
The publications included maga
zines on youth affairs, an analy
sis of the attitude of the Commu
nist Party towards religion, an
analysis of Communist front
youth organizations, and resolu
tions of the seventh lUS i Com
munist-backed student group >
Congress. Also taken were two
publications on the ninety-day
clause of the General Law
Amendment Act.
A statement released that day
from the NUSAS president to the
Cape Times stated: "There is no
point in getting hysterical about
this raid. Mr. Vorster tried to
damage NUSAS by using inaccu
rate information. lie has obvi
ously failed. In an attempt to get
damaging information, the Spe
cial Branch raided our offices,
taking away eight publications,
most of which, although a bo u t
communism, are written by non
communists."
"IF THIS is an attempt to
frighten us, it has not succeeded
and it will never succeed. What
NUSAS stands for - academic
freedom and human freedom, the
right of students to be involved
in their society and to criticize it,
the Universal Declaration of Hu
man Rights is not going to be
damaged by police raids or Minis
terial attacks.
NUSAS has also been recently
embroiled in a controversy about
their use of broadcast time on
South African radio. The South
Africa Broadcasting Corporation
had allowed NUSAS to reply to
attack by Ivor Benson.
Immediately following the state

ment by NUSAS, the Corporation
broadcasted Vorster's attack of
NUSAS (cited earlier in this ser
ies from the Johannesburg Sun
day Express) to give "equal
prominence to both statements."
NUSAS's reply to Vorster w a s
covered the next morning in the
Corporation's national news bulle
tins.
IX RKI'I/V TO NUSAS criti
cism of the Corporation's cover
age of the NUSAS-Vorster contro
versy, the Corporation's Program
Director wrote NUSAS's presi
dent that "having rolected the de
fense of NUSAS in three national
news bulletins the Corporation
felt that it was unnecessary to
prolong the controversy by giving
NUSAS further air time, particu
larly in view of the fact that
NUSAS found a strange ally in
Moscow Radio and in the Russian
Communist mouthpiece. Pravda,
|which | commended NUSAS in
its quarrel with the Minister of
Justice."
NUSAS President replied, in a
letter dated November 5. that
"the recording by NUSAS was a
reply to an attack made by Mr.
Benson. When NUSAS recorded
that reply, it had no knowledge
that the Corporation intended to
broadcast the statement of the
Minister of Justice. Indeed, the
statement by the Minister had
not even been made when 1 h e
NUSAS reply was recorded."
He continued that he was "puz
zled by your comment that
NUSAS found a 'strange ally' in
Moscow Radio and Pravda."
"I would point out that the Na
tional Unions of Students of the
United States, Scotland, Britain
land many others | and the
World Assembly of Youth have
all condemned the Minister's at
tacks on NUSAS, and have sup
ported NUSAS in its policies. Do
you consider these 'strange al
lies' "?
Tomorrow: NUSAS fights
government detensions of its
members by setting up a Poli
tical Freedom Fund.
