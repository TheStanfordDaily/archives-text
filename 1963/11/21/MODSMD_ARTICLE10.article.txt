# â€™63 Gaieties of Mixed Quality
## 
### BRAD EFRON 
One does not ordinarily connect Ram's Head
Productions with religious or mystical experience.
And .vet Tuesday evening, as I sat watching the
1963 Big Game Gaieties from the third row of
Memorial Auditorium, I caught a glimpse of eter
nity.
It was early in the first act. about a tenth of
the way through (as it turned out) a melodra
matic satire entitled 'West Flynne,' or 'His Mother
Loved Him But She Died.' The curtain had des
cended for the third time in as many minutes, the
band had exhausted its meager supply of inlorim
music, and even the relatives of the entertainers,
who seemed to comprise tho bulk of the audience,
had grown restive listening to scenery shifting
noises in the dark. A paper airplane flew out of
the orchestra pit.
WITH GROWING terror I realized that they
intended to go on With this thing to the end. And
on and on they went, regaling the audience with
such nuggets of wit as "I never drink, (exagger
ated asidei except for medicinal purposes!" and
"My dear sainted mother didn't believe in hard
likuor" (repeated four times in its various per
mutations.)
The ever-descending brocade curtain began to
seem more like a friend the longer it was down.
At the end I applauded ferociously, with all the
positive emotion of a man completing his dental
appointment.
Unfortunately my relief was a few hours pre
mature. It is fashionable these days, when direct
ing a theatrical endeavor, to keep a "directorial
image" in mind as a point of unification for the
entire production. A fire, a cave, a windstorm,
anything like this will do. On the other hand, a
swamp doesn't seem ideal for a light comedy re
view.
TIME AND again during the evening, basic
ally good material, such as 'El Librador,' the story
and song of a Peace Corp girl in love with a South
American revolutionary hero, would go flat, ruined
by the sluggish pace and poor timing character
istic of the whole show. Bad material, such as
'West Flynne,' was of course a disaster under such
circumstances.

Only once did the show come to life, for ten
minutes, the duration of 'John Brown in Hell,' a
satire on war movies written by Mark Hammer.
Coming at the end ot the first act, its rapid-fire
and accurate dialogue, delivered perfectly by Den
nis Kales, Foster Hirsch. Christopher Cass, and
Richard McKee, stirred me from the defensive
stupor into which I had fallen.
And the final surprise set would have been a
real show-stopper, had the show ever started.
I RETURNED for the second act filled with
false hope. Although the depths of 'West Flynne'
were not to be plumbed again, there were no peaks
comparable to 'John Brown' either. The singers
rose to new levels of inaudibility.
An imaginary patron, entering from the rear
of the theatre, would suppose they were engaged
in some cleaver, if inexplicable, pantomime. Ap
proaching closer to the stage, ho would be dis
appointed to find that they were actually attempt
ing to sing.
Exceptions to this rule of silence were Laurie
Taylor. Chris Cass, and especially Dennis Fales,
a familiar face from the Mendicants, who was
easily the star of the show.
The general mishandling of the music was
especially unfortunate since from what 1 could
hear it seemed to be the best Gaieties score in
several years. (Greg McCurdy, Dick Lamb, Paul
Conrad, Ed Cashman, Phil Graneto, Nancy Ann
Piver, and Donald Paduto are credited with the
music. David Quattione directed the orchestra
to good effect.)
TWO OF what appeared to be the more ela
borate efforts on the second act program were
dropped without explanation, despite which the
final curtain did not fall until past eleven. A song
and dance number which did make it.the 'Ameri
can Housewives Lament.' seemed tu be taken with
out credit from a San Francisco musical review
which played several months ago.
TO ADO TO THE very slim positive ledger.
Jerry Gamble's two puppet acts were beautifully
done, as were the gills who held up the vaude
villiorin introduction signs (Chris Herlick. and
Kathy Kalin.)
Unfortunately, a turkey with a few pretty
feathers is still a turkey.

Richard McKee, stirred me from the defensive
stupor into which I had fallen.
And the final surprise set would have been a
real show-stopper, had the show ever started.
I RETURNED for the second act filled with
false hope. Although the depths of 'West Flynne'
were not to be plumbed again, there were no peaks
comparable to 'John Brown' either. The singers
rose to new levels of inaudibility.
An imaginary patron, entering from the rear
of the theatre, would suppose they were engaged
in some cleaver, if inexplicable, pantomime. Ap
proaching closer to the stage, ho would be dis
appointed to find that they were actually attempt
ing to sing.
Exceptions to this rule of silence were Laurie
Taylor. Chris Cass, and especially Dennis Fales,
a familiar face from the Mendicants, who was
easily the star of the show.
The general mishandling of the music was
especially unfortunate since from what 1 could
hear it seemed to be the best Gaieties score in
several years. (Greg McCurdy, Dick Lamb, Paul
Conrad, Ed Cashman, Phil Graneto, Nancy Ann
Piver, and Donald Paduto are credited with the
music. David Quattione directed the orchestra
to good effect.)
TWO OF what appeared to be the more ela
borate efforts on the second act program were
dropped without explanation, despite which the
final curtain did not fall until past eleven. A song
and dance number which did make it.the 'Ameri
can Housewives Lament.' seemed tu be taken with
out credit from a San Francisco musical review
which played several months ago.
TO ADO TO THE very slim positive ledger.
Jerry Gamble's two puppet acts were beautifully
done, as were the gills who held up the vaude
villiorin introduction signs (Chris Herlick. and
Kathy Kalin.)
Unfortunately, a turkey with a few pretty
feathers is still a turkey.
One does not ordinarily connect Ram's Head
Productions with religious or mystical experience.
And .vet Tuesday evening, as I sat watching the
1963 Big Game Gaieties from the third row of
Memorial Auditorium, I caught a glimpse of eter
nity.
It was early in the first act. about a tenth of
the way through (as it turned out) a melodra
matic satire entitled 'West Flynne,' or 'His Mother
Loved Him But She Died.' The curtain had des
cended for the third time in as many minutes, the
band had exhausted its meager supply of inlorim
music, and even the relatives of the entertainers,
who seemed to comprise tho bulk of the audience,
had grown restive listening to scenery shifting
noises in the dark. A paper airplane flew out of
the orchestra pit.
WITH GROWING terror I realized that they
intended to go on With this thing to the end. And
on and on they went, regaling the audience with
such nuggets of wit as "I never drink, (exagger
ated asidei except for medicinal purposes!" and
"My dear sainted mother didn't believe in hard
likuor" (repeated four times in its various per
mutations.)
The ever-descending brocade curtain began to
seem more like a friend the longer it was down.
At the end I applauded ferociously, with all the
positive emotion of a man completing his dental
appointment.
Unfortunately my relief was a few hours pre
mature. It is fashionable these days, when direct
ing a theatrical endeavor, to keep a "directorial
image" in mind as a point of unification for the
entire production. A fire, a cave, a windstorm,
anything like this will do. On the other hand, a
swamp doesn't seem ideal for a light comedy re
view.
TIME AND again during the evening, basic
ally good material, such as 'El Librador,' the story
and song of a Peace Corp girl in love with a South
American revolutionary hero, would go flat, ruined
by the sluggish pace and poor timing character
istic of the whole show. Bad material, such as
'West Flynne,' was of course a disaster under such
circumstances.

Only once did the show come to life, for ten
minutes, the duration of 'John Brown in Hell,' a
satire on war movies written by Mark Hammer.

and accurate dialogue, delivered perfectly by Den

band had exhausted its meager supply of inlorim
music, and even the relatives of the entertainers,
who seemed to comprise tho bulk of the audience,
had grown restive listening to scenery shifting
noises in the dark. A paper airplane flew out of
the orchestra pit.
WITH GROWING terror I realized that they
intended to go on With this thing to the end. And
on and on they went, regaling the audience with
such nuggets of wit as "I never drink, (exagger
ated asidei except for medicinal purposes!" and
"My dear sainted mother didn't believe in hard
likuor" (repeated four times in its various per
mutations.)
The ever-descending brocade curtain began to
seem more like a friend the longer it was down.
At the end I applauded ferociously, with all the
positive emotion of a man completing his dental
appointment.
Unfortunately my relief was a few hours pre
mature. It is fashionable these days, when direct
ing a theatrical endeavor, to keep a "directorial
image" in mind as a point of unification for the
entire production. A fire, a cave, a windstorm,
anything like this will do. On the other hand, a
swamp doesn't seem ideal for a light comedy re
view.
TIME AND again during the evening, basic
ally good material, such as 'El Librador,' the story
and song of a Peace Corp girl in love with a South
American revolutionary hero, would go flat, ruined
by the sluggish pace and poor timing character
istic of the whole show. Bad material, such as
'West Flynne,' was of course a disaster under such
circumstances.

Only once did the show come to life, for ten
minutes, the duration of 'John Brown in Hell,' a
satire on war movies written by Mark Hammer.
Coming at the end ot the first act, its rapid-fire
and accurate dialogue, delivered perfectly by Den
nis Kales, Foster Hirsch. Christopher Cass, and
Richard McKee, stirred me from the defensive
stupor into which I had fallen.
And the final surprise set would have been a
real show-stopper, had the show ever started.
I RETURNED for the second act filled with
false hope. Although the depths of 'West Flynne'
were not to be plumbed again, there were no peaks
comparable to 'John Brown' either. The singers
rose to new levels of inaudibility.
An imaginary patron, entering from the rear
of the theatre, would suppose they were engaged
in some cleaver, if inexplicable, pantomime. Ap
proaching closer to the stage, ho would be dis
appointed to find that they were actually attempt
ing to sing.
Exceptions to this rule of silence were Laurie
Taylor. Chris Cass, and especially Dennis Fales,
a familiar face from the Mendicants, who was
easily the star of the show.
The general mishandling of the music was
especially unfortunate since from what 1 could
hear it seemed to be the best Gaieties score in
several years. (Greg McCurdy, Dick Lamb, Paul
Conrad, Ed Cashman, Phil Graneto, Nancy Ann
Piver, and Donald Paduto are credited with the
music. David Quattione directed the orchestra
to good effect.)
TWO OF what appeared to be the more ela
borate efforts on the second act program were
dropped without explanation, despite which the
final curtain did not fall until past eleven. A song
and dance number which did make it.the 'Ameri
can Housewives Lament.' seemed tu be taken with
out credit from a San Francisco musical review
which played several months ago.
TO ADO TO THE very slim positive ledger.
Jerry Gamble's two puppet acts were beautifully
done, as were the gills who held up the vaude
villiorin introduction signs (Chris Herlick. and
Kathy Kalin.)
Unfortunately, a turkey with a few pretty
feathers is still a turkey.

Productions with religious or mystical experience.
And .vet Tuesday evening, as I sat watching the
1963 Big Game Gaieties from the third row of
Memorial Auditorium, I caught a glimpse of eter
nity.
It was early in the first act. about a tenth of
the way through (as it turned out) a melodra
matic satire entitled 'West Flynne,' or 'His Mother
Loved Him But She Died.' The curtain had des
cended for the third time in as many minutes, the
band had exhausted its meager supply of inlorim
music, and even the relatives of the entertainers,
who seemed to comprise tho bulk of the audience,

noises in the dark. A paper airplane flew out of
the orchestra pit.
