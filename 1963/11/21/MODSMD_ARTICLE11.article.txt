# Federal Aid Concentrated In Sciences, Grad Schools
## 
### MIKE WAGGONER Associate Editor 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the third in a series of articles deal
ing with the relation between the Federal Government and higher
education, and Stanford's place in this relation.)
The Federal government's activity in higher education has been
concentrated in a few universities, on graduate education, and on
the sciences. This article deals with the extent, effects, and remedies
| of this concentration.
The Federal government in 1960 spent $1.5 billion on higher edu-

cation. This expenditure falls into-*
three roughly equal categories.
Only one of these categories, that
of loans and scholarships to stu
dents, loans for residence hall
construction, and assistance in
creating and improving teaching
programs, is widely distributed
throughout higher education.
THE OTHER two types are
government - sponsored research,
in university-affiliated research
centers and in project research
within universities. This research
is concentrated in a few univer
sities, the top six receiving 59 j
per cent of the funds if research ;
centers are included, 28 per cent j
if not. The figure are 79 per cent j
and 59 per cent for the top 20. j
There are 233 universities offer- j
ing Ph.D.s in fields of govern- 'â– 
ment research, hence qualified J
for these funds.
These centers and projects have
been allocated in an anarchy of
over 35 agencies dealing directly
with scientists, usually butj
weakly moderated by the univer- j
sity administrations and Con- i
gress. This anarchy has prevented ;
most danger of federal control
of higher education, but it has
also resulted in making the rich
richer and perhaps the poor
poorer. The best universities get j
the most funds, so become better,
so get more funds. Now there is
some desire to reverse this trend, j
This is partly a desire to broaden
the base of the best U.S. higher
education, partly a pork barrelish
recognition of universities' ability
to attract industry.
The research funds fall under
three headings: defense accounts
for 40 per cent, health for 37 per
cent, and science and technolog
ical advancement account for 20
per cent. The remainder is mostly
social sciences.
THUS, much of government re
search expenditure is not for de- j
tense, directly. This is even more j
the case as much of the "defense" |
category is for basic research
such as the Navy's support of all j
but the latest of Stanford's !
linear accelerators rather than |
for weapons.
The Cold War, is however, the

reason for much of the expendi
ture in the defense and t he other
categories. And "Federal research
in universities" includes the cost
of running Cal's Los Alamos Sci
entific Laboratory where the A-
Bomb was developed.
There are two other problems
of concentration. Federal funds
aid research, which is closely
linked to graduate teaching. Un
dergraduate education may be
neglected. This produces the
"cruel paradox that a superior
faculty results in an inferior con
cern for undergraduate teaching."
Clark Kerr has stated.
HE SUGGESTED that the uni
versities and the government en
courage research personnel to
teach at least part-time, and em
phasized that several great uni
versities. through diligence, have
managed to avoid this problem.
The concentration of Federal
funds on the sciences and, in
creasingly, on the social sciences
has accentuated a long term de
cline in the humanities. This de
cline began in this country, ac
cording to Stanford Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences Sears, in
the 1880s. Science has a great
glamour for the public, which is
reflected in ihe preferences of the
government and many philan
thropies.
Dr. Harold Orlans in a survey
for the Brookings Institute stated
that the problem wasn't a relative
advance of the sciences, which
have maintained a constant pro
portion of students since the
1920'5, but of an advance of the
social sciences relative to the hu
manities.
WITH THE present predilection
of Congress (the current educa
tion bill has been amended to in
clude funds only for science class
rooms, not all types as originally
planned), federal aid to the hu
manities is not likely to increase.
The problem will have to be met
by foundations and universities
allocating funds to counter the
Federal current. This is eased as
humanities research needs, essen
tially a library and travel, are far
less expensive than those for the
sciences, a library, travel, and
much equipment.
The problem of the sciences,
social sciences and humanities is
most complex. At first science,
then social science, then science
again advanced, it was inevitable
that they take a larger propor
tion of students, funds, and fac
ulty. New balances had to be cre
ated. Now, according to Orlans,
there is a consensus in all three
fields that the balance of funds
and prestige ought to shift back
toward the humanities.
Another view of this question
has been presented by C. P. Snow.
He states that humanists and sci
entists live in separate cultures
and need to make an effort to un
derstand each other. At present,
he states, the scientists are doing
a fai - betlcr job of this.
THIS IS an excellent point. Be
sides Teller, how many uncivil
ized scientists come to mind?
Few. And how many humanists,
or even social scientists, are there
who don't understand the physical
sciences and technology? More.
