# Tri-Partite Project Fosters International Understanding
## 
### 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: This is
the second of a series of three
articles by Margaret Rose,
graduate student in Russia, who
participated in a work and
study project in the USSR last
year.
The American Friends Service
Committee describes the purpose
of the Tri-Partite Work and Study
Project as follows:
To foster, through increased un
derstanding, a mutual respect be
tween individuals of different
ideological beliefs and opinions
with an eye to encouraging coop
eration and lessening mutual fear,
suspicion and hostility.
Frank discussion was the me
dium Americans, British and
Russians attempted thus last
summer at the Tri-Partite Proj
ect in the Soviet Union.
THE BROADCAST theme of
the scheduled discussions, ar
ranged in advance by represen
tatives of the three organizations,
was Youth. This emphasis was
meant to encourage one to speak
his own mind and not to feel
bound by an inherited position (if
this inheritance caused one to
feel bound. >
Many questions came up dur
ing the discussions. Following
are some concerning the cultural
values of youth: Does an artist
produce spontaneously or accord
ing to a plan, a preconceived
idea? Can art also be propa
ganda? What is the difference be
tween propaganda and art? Can
one defend so called "great art"
that is anti-social? that is anti-
Semitic or segregationist? that is
anti-Marxist ?
Does an artist have a respon
sibility to society? Does Socialist
Realism limit an artist? If so.
how?
Many people have asked if the
Russians over disagreed with one
another in the presence of the en-

I tiro group. They disagreed with
i out contradicting one another. (A
; parallel miglit be found in Sino
! Soviet relations: a difference in
i emphasis causes disagreement,
but so far they are not contra
dicting one another.) It was clear
I from our discussions that differ
ent emphases within the same
j ideology can result in extensive
variety of opinion.
Thinking for oneself has been
I encouraged within the last two
years by Khrushchev's rejection
of Stalin or "The Cult of Person
, ality." One hears the opinion that
individuals under Stalin were re
, sponsible for their own actions
; and together with Stalin bear the
j blame for Ihe abuses of that
period.

people aware that not everything
official is right and that they
[ must take responsibility to
i change what is wrong. ("What is
not right" would be what inhibits
; attainment of a Communist So
-5 ciety.»
During work, and at other times
outside discussion sessions, th e
group directed endless questions
to Russians, but seldom did they
reciprocate with questions about
the West. They answered our
questions fully and even origi
nally. hut they more often than
i not told us rather than asked us
j about our own country.
| Ido not attribute the lack of
! questions to fear. It is rather
i that they do not consider western
j societies worthy of emulation,
except of course, statistically and
materially. Why look backwards
to Western values and institu
tions when history is cranking
the world forward toward com
munism? This seems to be an as
sumption at the root of their
! thinking and perhaps keeps other
[ than-factual-questions from ger
minating in their minds.
