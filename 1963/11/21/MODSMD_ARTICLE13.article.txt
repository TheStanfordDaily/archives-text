# Judicial Process Hazy
## 
### 
Stanford's latest discipline case, the Serra hi-fi incident,
has demonstrated at least two things: that our long-stand
ing student judicial structure is hazily constructed at sev
eral points, and that Dean of Men Robert Cordon appears
to be a fast-moving and concerned administrator.
During the course of the case that went to Men's Council
twice, back and forth across the desks of two deans, and
finally to a faculty-administration sub-committee, it became
clear that some basic aspects of our judicial procedure are
undefined. Men's and Women's Councils are constructed
to serve as advisory bodies to the deans. Should they, then,
release their recommendation to the student involved, as
is traditional, or should their recommendation remain con
fidential and only a final decision be released after dean's
approval?
To whom does a student appeal? We tend to assume
currently that appeal is to the dean's office after student
judicial council hearing, but if the student verdict is merely
a recommendation to the dean, the appeal is then directed
to the same person who issued the original decision.
Should the student judicial bodies be advisory in all
cases, or should they issue the final decision in some, cer
tain, or all cases? Should the final body of appeal be taken
from the membership of a Presidential advisory committee,
or should it be derived from a committee of the academic
council?
What type of evidence and witnesses are to lie sought?
In the Serra case, Men's Council held a second, supple
mental meeting in order to hear men from Serra directly;
written evidence had been submitted for the first meeting.
Does "conduct unbecoming a Stanford student" suffice
as a body of law under which one may be punished? Should
we present students with a written statement of the charge
against them and the ruling allegedly violated?
One can offer basic questions infinitely when speaking
of our legal processes as they stand currently. The over
whelming question is whether we have considered the re
quirements of "due process of law" and maintained a con
sistent answer.
Civen the nature of our hazy procedures, however, the
judicial reviewers made the best of a bad thing. Men's
Council acted objectively and, even though their recommen
dation was finally modified by the Presidential sub-com
mittee, attempted to consider all available evidence. Dean
Gordon himself raised several of the basic questions on our
procedures as he watched the case in action, and at every
point acted with all possible speed and openness. Our prob
lems are not with human elements involved, but with struc
tural factors.
