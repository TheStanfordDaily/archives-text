BUCKLEY PROTESTS
♦'ACOUSTIC A I, HOSTII JTY"
Editor, The Daily:
Like the Buddhist bonzes, I
believe that self-immolations
should be to some purpose, and
so address you the plea that fu
ture speakers may bo spared a
labor I failed ignominiously, and
which Hercules himself might
have failed. As the result of an
acoustical hostility more adamant
than any I have ever encountered
anywhere, I was unable last Fri
day to repay the courtesy of
those members of the Stanford
community who came to hear the
views of a dissenter on American
foreign policy. It was not only
that I had to speak at a shrill and
relentless monotone in order to
bo heard at all (even then, those
around the borders of the audi
ence heard only bits and pieces,
hero and there), there was the
matter of the rehearsing band
outdoors, which was following its
own independent, not to say an
archichal, course, and whose mu
sic, to judge from the great deal
I heard of it. was the perfect ac
companiment for your football
team's performance on the fol
lowing day. If the University is
going to provide bands for visit
ing speakers, they should be giv
en the opportunity to provide the
musicians with more or less con
gruent scores. I guess I am try
ing to say that if one fills one's
swimming hole with quicksand,
one does not invite one's fellow
citizens, no not even right-wing
citizens, in for a dip.

FLICKS ANI) THE POLL
Editor, The Daily:
We wish to thank the Daily for
the Wednesday edition which had
to be one of the funniest of the
quarter, largely due to Mr. Li 11-
quist's pseudo-statistical travesty.
First, may we extend sympathy
to tlie uncomplaining typesetter,
who had to set those 505 num
bers.
Although in several instances
the number of responses exceeds
the number of flick-goers inter
viewed, no greater accuracy was
obtained by this technique. As
any student of Stat. 50, Math A,
or even Introduction to Ethics
will testify, a 1.5 per cent sample
of the Stanford population may
tend to be nonrepresentative.
(We lament the absence of
graphs.) In fact, we suggest that
his method be used to generate
new random number tables. The
only correlation obtainable is not
in the number table but in the
article—(dash) there is an exact
correspondence between the num
ber of dashes used (twenty-one)
and the number of fallacious con
clusions.
Wo present here our own poll
of behaviour patterns at the
flicks, which we feel to be a defi
nite improvement, although we
admittedly borrowed some of Mr.
Lillquist's techniques. The sub
jects were randomly selected
from the three originators of this
study, both of whom answered
th© question 50 times. (This elimi

1 nates undesirable diversity in the
results.) We were, however, care
ful to multiply all numbers in our
table by the square root of minus
one. since our subjects are imagi
nary. Each subject was given a
choice of three responses. Here
are the results:
Go
Yes No Away
Question 1. 3.1416 6.8584 59
The avid statistician will note
that our results, too, were
skewed.
With due apologies, paraphras
ing Lillquist's "Norn de Guerre,"
we hope this criticism is not "At
the expense of debasing the ethi
cal or moral philosophy of even
the most poultry individual."

—WARREN PHILLIPS
Editor, The Daily:
In protest of some over simpli
fications apparent in the current
discussion of audience comments
' during the Sunday flicks:
(1) Obscene and crude com
ments are unacceptable in mixed
company at any tim<j;
(2) Attempts to be funny in
excellent, serious movies like
j "Billy Budd" and"The Virgin
Spring" I feel are out of place,
j and a large proportion of the au
dience at these movies obviously
agreed;
(3) Comments at bad movies
(like "The Man Who Shot Lib
erty Valance" last year) can
make an enjoyable evening out of
what would otherwise have been
a waste of time.
Finally may I suggest that Mr.
Lillquist look up the definition
of "abhor" and compare that with
I his ridiculous use of the word in
his olherwi.se good poll.
—JACK MeKAY
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Lillquist, in his article on
the flicks, voices in these words—
"The sad thing was over one
third of the students do not care
what an outsider might think."-
the most contemptible of all be
liefs: that our actions should be
governed by what others think
of them, no matter whether or
not these actions have any rela
tion to these people. I ask, "Does
Stanford exist for Stanford stu
dents or outsiders?" "Do we do
things for ourselves or the out
sider?" More specifically, "Do
we ban from school the Stanford
students who went to Mississippi
because Palo Alto does not ap
prove?" "Do we hold new ASSU
elections because Palo Alto does
not like the candidates?" Finally,
the greatest question, "Are we
'selecting and forming the final
ideas by which we will eventu
ally guide our lives' or are they?"
I believe Stanford exists for
Stanford students. The flicks in
no way affect, concern, or even
pertain to any outsider. It is
completely our business. Their
opinions are not. needed, I, for
one, would rather have Stanford
individualism than outside con
formity. As long as the flicks
are solely a Stanford matter,
others' opinions be damned.
