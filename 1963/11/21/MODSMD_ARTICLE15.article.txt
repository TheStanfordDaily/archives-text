## Ineffectual Organization Mars Student Congress 
### BILL MOORE Staff Editor 
Washington isn't the only place that's suffering from congres
sional woes.
The Stanford Student Congress—although free from the Dixie
capers of Russell, Eastland and Co.—is suffering from a hobgoblin
that's been gagging the Hill for years: ineffectual organization.
The problem at Stanford was underscored nicely at last week's
Student Congress session, in which only a smattering of students
were on hand to unanimously support an otherwise controversial
resolution.
DESPITE Till-: VERY CAPABLE leadership of Speaker Dennis !
Sweeney, the Congress's bi-weekly meetings, which are open to all!
students, fail to attract any real attendance or diversity of debate.
Why? Because under the present system there's little incentive
to participate.
"We contact the leadership of all the political groups on campus
and asked them to send members to the meetings," explains Sweeney.
"But some just are not receptive, and we usually get only one side
represented."
The congress was born last spring in the wake of the student j
rights controversy during which the Board of Trustees refused
to allow LASSIJ to speak out on "off-campus" issues. The congress
was the Trustees' "concession" after the student rights l'lare-up—a
"concession" about as valuable as a three-dollar bill.
AT PRESENT, THE C ONGRESS, which is registered under the
Political Union and SASCOM, provides little more than a soap box
for those who care to speak and vote on resolutions selected for
particular meetings. Its resolutions lack teeth because the Univer
sity does not permit thorn to claim to represent the student body.
Which, indeed, they don't—right now.
The real problem, of course, lies in the absurdity of not allowing
LASSIJ to speak out in trying to draw a line between on and off
campus issues in a community which is supposed to be vitally con
cerned with world affairs.
But as long as we're up against this provincialism, we should at
least try to establish a congress that will generate student interest
and participation. And that could be accomplished if there were
regular members of the congress—one elected from each living
group, as in LASSU.
THE YOUNG DEMOCRATS, Young Republicans and the Politi
cal Union caucuses could actively recruit candidates to run from
each of the living groups. The effect, could be electric in creating
campus political interest—if only because students would have to
examine their own views in selecting persons to represent them.
The congress, in compliance with university ruling, would still
not be able to claim it officially represented the student body. And
that would probably satisfy those who fear embroiling Stanford's
name in horrors!—"off-campus" affairs.
ONE PROBLEM REMAINS. Speaker Sweeney says he has con
sidered the representative congress only as a last resort because it
would not permit an open forum for everyone. His point is a good
one—but there's a solution.
Why not give all students the right to speak on resolutions before
the floor of the congress? Without voting privileges, of
which would be given only to the elected representatives.
Politics is contagious.
There's no reason why Stanford and the Student Congress should
be left behind.
