# Latest Joan Baez Album Something for Everyone
## 
### JOSEPH MAYSHARK 
Joan Baoz's latest release, Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2. (Van
guard, $4.98) will be no disappointment to her fans; and even Miss
Baez' critics will have to admit that the failing quality in her voice,
which has been a major source of criticism against her, has subsided
to a great extent. As this record was recorded at the same time as
its predecessor, Joan Baez in Concert, released a year ago, this im
provement in tonal quality is due more to song choice than anything
else.
The program is long (16 selections; total playing time nearly
three-quarters of an hour) and varied, ranging from such well
established ballads as 'Railroad Bill" and"The Queen of Hearts" to
such recently composed songs as "The Long Black Veil" and Bob
Dylan's "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right." She does three Spanish
numbers, all of them well; the best is "'Nu Bello Cardillo." Her
version of "Fennario" is somehow disappointing; it has been done
with more of a flair, more life, by other singers (notably Judy Col
lins).
THIS ALBUM really seems to have somthing for everybody.
For you liberals, Miss Baez joins with the audience at Miles College,
Birmingham, Alabama, in a really moving rendition of "We Shall
Overcome"; and for those of you who want to die to keep men free,
she closes the program with "The Battle Hymn of the Republic."
The best selections on the album, though, are the several traditional
but little-performed ballads. She does "Jackaroe" and "Three Fish
ers" beautifully, but the best two songs on the album are "Rambler-
Gambler" and "Once I Had a Sweetheart." The album would be
worth owning for these two alone.
And if you were impressed by Bob Dylan's poem on the back of
the latest Peter, Paul & Mary album, rejoice: this one has one, too.
This is the sort of thing that sets trends. It will be interesting to
see what's on the back of Mr. Dylan's next album.
For those of you who are unimpressed by Mr. Dylan's excursions
into poor punctuation, there is a full-color picture of Miss Baez on
the cover. And for those unromantic souls who are unmoved by her
haunting beauty, there's still the record itself. It's the best part
anyhow.
