They say you can throw out
the hook when Big Game time
rolls around, ;mcl it past records
mean anything they're right. The
odds-makers also go along with
that old saw. having marie Stan
ford a slim one point favorite
despite the Tribe's one-sided loss
to Washington State last week.
Stanford has had a disappoint
ing season, having made a really
good showing only twice: in the
San Jose State and Notre Dame
games. But with Steve Thurlow
no longer a question mark and
definitely a starter, Indian hopes
for a Big Game win took a big
leap skyward.
C'AIj (OMKS into the season
finale with its best team since

I 1958, the last time it went to the
Rose Bowl. The Golden Bears
from Berkeley have ridden the
golden arm of quarterback Craig
1 Morton to victories over Iowa
State, San Jose State, UCLA, and
Utah plus a tie with a strong
I Duke team whose record was
previously unblemished. In addi
tion the Bears have made respec
1 table showings against Illinois
and Washington, losing by mar
gins of less than two touchdowns.
Morton has set a new single
season Cal touchdown pass rec
ord throwing 14 to date. The
Oskie passer has a total of 23
TD throws to his credit in his
career, two of them in lust year's
Big Came.
Morton's leading receiver this

season lias been junior end Jack
Schraub, who twice has caught
two scoring tosses in single
games this season.
SCHRAUB HAS caught a total !
of 2.S passes this year for an aver- j
age gain of 16 yards, his longest j
gainer being a 67-yard jaunt for [
a score against Pitt, in his first i
game appearance of the season. 1
A high school teammate of Mor
ton, Schraub*s 28 receptions are!
enough to make him rank ninth
in Cal's all time list of single sea
son receivers.
But passing is not all there is
to the Cal attack. This formidable
offensive machine boasts four
other backs who average close
to, or over five yards per carry. •
Halfback Tom Blanchfield is
the leading Bear rusher with 349
yards gained for a 5.0 average, j
Fullback Rudy Caravajal is next j
with 210 yards and a 5.1 average, j
Halfback Jim Blakeney follows j
with a 191 yard total and 5.1 ;
average, and another halfback,'
Tom Relies has 151 yards for a
5.3 average.
CAL this year has been out
gained by nearly 100 yards per
game, but lias still managed to
amass one more touchdown than
its combined opposition.
Stanford, on the other hand,
has been unable to generate any
offense since the Notre Dame
game in mid-season, and has re
lied chiefly on its sterling de
fense to keep it as close as it has
been in the last three games.
If Cal is to be beaten, the Tribe
must find some way to throttle
the aerial thrusts of Morton and
al the same time bottle up the
fine array of running talent Cal
Coach Marv Levy will throw at
! it in going after his first winning
I season at Cal and second Big
i Game win in four attempts.
