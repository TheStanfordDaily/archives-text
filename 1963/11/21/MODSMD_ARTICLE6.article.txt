# Cohen Makes Two Math Discoveries
## 
### 
Dr. Paul J. Cohen, 29-year-old
associate professor of mathema
tics at Stanford, has recently
ma d e two technical break
throughs in the theory of sets.
The cardinal number of a set is
the number of things that it con
tains; the cardinality of a set de
notes the size of a set. According
to the Palo Alto Times, Cohen
has proved that the existence of
a cardinal number which "lies be
tween the cardinality" of the
whole numbers of the set and
the cardinality of all real num
bers can neither be proved or dis
proved.
Previously mathematicians had
only said that the existence of
this cardinal number cannot be
disproved. Cohen has shown that
it also cannot be proved.
Cohen has also shown that it
is impossible to prove the axiom
of choice with set theory, al
though this principle has been
accepted by most mathematicians.
Cohen has shown that it is not
necessarily always possible to
choose one element from each
set in a given collection of sets.
