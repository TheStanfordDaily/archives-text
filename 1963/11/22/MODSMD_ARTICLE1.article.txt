# THE 						PRESIDENT IS DEAD
## GAME, ALL ACTIVITIES CANCELLED Big Game On Next Week; Other Activities in Doubt 
### MIKE WAGGONER 
Associate Editor
Big Game has been postponed
one week due to the assassination
of President Kennedy in Dallas
today. All other remaining activ
ities scheduled as part of Big
Game had been cancelled or dis
couraged earlier.
Big Game was cancelled when
the Big Six reversed an earlier de
cision to allow scheduled football
games, unless a proclamation of
national mourning were issued
from Washington.
No decision has yet been made
on rescheduling other Big Game
activities. At present, all are can
celled or strongly discouraged: it
is possible many will be resched
uled next week.
PRESIDENT STERLING is
sued the following statement:
"One's heart goes out to all

members of President Kennedy's
family for this grievous personal
loss they have suffered. Millions
mourn with them. In this tragic
hour, one might recall the words
of President Lincoln and resolve
to 'strive on to finish the work we
are in. . . . to do all which may
may achieve and cherish a just and
lasting peace among ourselves and
with all nations.' "
ASSU PRESIDENT Bud Wedin

Big Game has been postponed
one week due to the assassination
of President Kennedy in Dallas
today. All other remaining activ
ities scheduled as part of Big
Game had been cancelled or dis
couraged earlier.
Big Game was cancelled when
the Big Six reversed an earlier de
cision to allow scheduled football
games, unless a proclamation of
national mourning were issued
from Washington.
No decision has yet been made
on rescheduling other Big Game
activities. At present, all are can
celled or strongly discouraged: it
is possible many will be resched
uled next week.
PRESIDENT STERLING is
sued the following statement:
"One's heart goes out to all

members of President Kennedy's
family for this grievous personal
loss they have suffered. Millions
mourn with them. In this tragic
hour, one might recall the words
of President Lincoln and resolve
to 'strive on to finish the work we
are in. . . . to do all which may
may achieve and cherish a just and
lasting peace among ourselves and
with all nations.' "
ASSU PRESIDENT Bud Wedin
and Cal President Mel Levine
have agreed to cancell all activi
ties at both schools connected
