# It Can't Happen Here

At 11:15 this morning a student interrupted a class of 270 po
litical science majors to announce, "The rumor has been confirmed.
The President was shot in Texas, and is in critical condition." At
11:30, a student with an earphone radio interrupted again: "There
is an unconfirmed report that the President is dead;" at 11:45, "It
is official; the President is dead." Throughout the University at that
moment, throughout the nation, and throughout great portions of
the world, people rose from their desks and walked silently away.
The single greatest attribute of the American policy is its com
mitment to politics without violence. In an American city John
Fitzgerald Kennedy was slain. Our President was a brilliant man,
a product of—and devoted to—all that is fine in our nation; he emit
ted the force, youth and vitality that is the United States. If he
was slain by the maniacal workings of one mind, the national trag
edy is incredible. If the assassin was a reflection of a sickness afflict
ing thousands, driven insane by a complicated world, our tragedy
may be insurmountable.
We must in any case continue forward and modify our faith
from"it can't happen here," to "it shall not happen again."
In 1960, John Kennedy asked for our hearts and our hands. We
extend them now to Lyndon Johnson, to those devoted to carrying
on the work that Kennedy began, and to the mourning entity that
is our United States.
At 7:00 this evening and again at 8:00 this evening Stanford
students and faculty will gather together to pray, to try to under
stand. And for many years to come, we will bow our heads as we
remember the date November 22, 1963.


DALLAS: Police today seized Lee H. Oswald, identified as chair
man of a "Fair Play for Cuba Committee," as the prime suspect

Fitzgerald Kennedy was slain. Our President was a brilliant man,
a product of—and devoted to—all that is fine in our nation; he emit
ted the force, youth and vitality that is the United States. If he
was slain by the maniacal workings of one mind, the national trag
edy is incredible. If the assassin was a reflection of a sickness afflict
ing thousands, driven insane by a complicated world, our tragedy
may be insurmountable.
We must in any case continue forward and modify our faith
from"it can't happen here," to "it shall not happen again."
In 1960, John Kennedy asked for our hearts and our hands. We
extend them now to Lyndon Johnson, to those devoted to carrying
on the work that Kennedy began, and to the mourning entity that
is our United States.
At 7:00 this evening and again at 8:00 this evening Stanford
students and faculty will gather together to pray, to try to under
stand. And for many years to come, we will bow our heads as we
remember the date November 22, 1963.


DALLAS: Police today seized Lee H. Oswald, identified as chair
man of a "Fair Play for Cuba Committee," as the prime suspect
in the assassination of President Kennedy. Police said Oswald, 24,
was accused in the slaying of a Dallas policeman shortly after the
shooting of the President. This is a 1 959 file photo of a Lee Oswald
of Ft Worth, Texas, as he applied for Soviet citizenship in Moscow.
At 11:15 this morning a student interrupted a class of 270 po
litical science majors to announce, "The rumor has been confirmed.
The President was shot in Texas, and is in critical condition." At
11:30, a student with an earphone radio interrupted again: "There
is an unconfirmed report that the President is dead;" at 11:45, "It
is official; the President is dead." Throughout the University at that
moment, throughout the nation, and throughout great portions of
the world, people rose from their desks and walked silently away.
The single greatest attribute of the American policy is its com
mitment to politics without violence. In an American city John
Fitzgerald Kennedy was slain. Our President was a brilliant man,
a product of—and devoted to—all that is fine in our nation; he emit
ted the force, youth and vitality that is the United States. If he
was slain by the maniacal workings of one mind, the national trag
edy is incredible. If the assassin was a reflection of a sickness afflict
ing thousands, driven insane by a complicated world, our tragedy
may be insurmountable.
