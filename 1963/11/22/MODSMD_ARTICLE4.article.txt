## 
### 
DALLAS, Nov. 22 (UPI) Lyndon Baines Johnson took the oath
of office as the 36th President of the United States today aboard the
White House plane that brought President Kennedy to Texas and
took his body home.
Mrs. Kennedy witnessed the ceremony.

"Okay, let's got this plane back
to Washington," were Johnson's
only words after Federal Judge
Sarah T. Hughes administered
the brief oath of office to the
Vice President.
Rumors that Johnson had suf
fered a heart attack cropped up
shortly after Kennedy was shot.
He had entered Parkland Hospi
tal with his hand over his chest.
The rumors were denied.
Mrs. Kennedy, Mrs. Johnson,
and White House officials were
aboard the jetliner and returned
to Washington with the new Pres
ident and the body of President
Kennedy in a bronze casket.
Between 25 and 30 persons wit
nessed the swearing in. They in
cluded Mrs. Evelyn Lincoln, Ken
nedy's personal secretary.
Johnson embraced Mrs. Ken
nedy. his wife, and Mrs. Lincoln
after the ceremony.
The swearing-in took place in
the forward suite of the hand
somely furnished jetliner.
The ceremonies were held up
briefly until Mrs. Kennedy ar
rived from the hospital.
The time was 2:30 p.m. Central
Standard Time.
The first statement of Lyndon
B. Johnspn, President of the
United States, made on his arrival
at Andrews Air Force Base nnar
Washington at 3:15 p.m. (PS'H:

"For me it is a deep personal
tragedy. I know the whole world
shares the sorrow that Mrs. Ken
nedy and her family bear. I will
do my best. That's all I can do. I
ask for your help and God's."
From old political foes within
the Democratic party, Johnson
and Kennedy had become a close
working team during the last
three years, Johnson gaining Ken
nedy's high esteem and confidence.
In 1960, Johnson had tried for
the Democratic presidential nomi
nation. When Kennedy won, John
son accepted second place on the
Democratic ticket.
ACCEPTING THE Kennedy
leadership, he became extraordi
narily active in behalf of Kennedy
policies. This activity included
work for the civil rights program
laid down by Kennedy — some
thing that lessened Johnson's
popularity in the South — and
there was some talk this year
Johnson might be dumped from
the ticket next year.
But on October 31, Kennedy was
i asked whether, if he ran next
year, he would again want John
son as the vice presidential nomi
nee, and whether he expected
Johnson to be on the ticket. He
replied:
"Yes, to both of those questions.
That is correct."


THE PRESIDENT
