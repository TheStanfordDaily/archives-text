# JFK Shot In Assassin During Dallas Motorcade
## Gov. Connally Also Injured; LBJ, Mrs. Kennedy Unhurt 
### 
DALLAS UPI—President Kennedy was assassinated today in a
burst of gunfire in downtown Dallas. Texas Gov. John Connally
was shot down with him.
President Kennedy was shot in the right temple. "It was a simple
matter of a bullet right through the head," said Dr. George Burkley,
White House medical officer.
The shooting occurred as Kennedy and his wife, riding with
Gov. Connally and Mrs. Connally, were riding in the White House
"bubbletop" limousine through a crowd of 250,000 people in down
town Dallas.
As it neared the triple underpass leading toward the Trade Mart
where Kennedy was to address a lunch, three bursts of gunfire
sounded.
THE PRESIDENT, cradled in his wife's arms, was rushed
in his blood-spattered limousine to Parkland Hospital and taken to
an emergency room. An urgent call went out for neurosurgeons
and blood.
The President, 46 years old, was shot once in the head. Connally
was hit in the head and wrist.
Police found a foreign-make rifle. Sheriffs officers were question
ing a young man picked up at the scene.
Vice President Lyndon Johnson—the nation's new President
was in the same cavalcade but a number of car lengths behind. He
was not hurt. Terribly shocked, Johnson, who has a record of heart
illness, was whisked off under heavy guard to be sworn in as quickly
as possible as the 36th President of the United States.
Johnson was sworn in as President at 12:39 p.m. PST in the for
ward compartment of the presidential plane before leaving to fly
back to Washington. The plane, marked Air Force 1, was the same
aircraft that brought Kennedy to Dallas this morning.
THE PRESIDENT was conscious as he arrived at the hospital.
Father Huber from Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church was called
and administered the last rights of the church shortly before 1 p.m.
Kennedy died 30 minutes after the shot was fired. Gov. Connally
was reported in satisfactory condition. Johnson left the hospital
moments after he was informed of the President's death.
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, first Roman Catholic President of
the United States and in Dallas on a politicking mission for a second
term, was smiling broadly as he rode through downtown streets.
' Then that awful look crossed his face," said a man at curbside only
15 feet away.
The identity of the assassin or assassins was not immediately
known.
Mrs. Kennedy, who had been a tremendous hit Thursday on the
first day of the two-day visit, was seated just in front of her husband.
After the shot, Kennedy slumped over on the back seat and Mrs.
Kennedy screamed. The interior of the car was splattered with
blood. Mrs. Kennedy took her husbands' head in her arms and bent
over him. Mrs. Connally was kneeling over her husband who lay
face down on the floor of the car.
There was pandamonium among the Secret Service men and
police motorcycle escorts. The asassin's bullets struck home so
suddenly there was no chance for them to hurl themselves around
the President.
Police charged up a grassy knoll into a nearby park. Secret
Service men unlimbered automatic rifles and drew pistols. Hut it
was too late
Kennedys and other limousines sped to the hospital while po
lice and Secret Service agents fanned out looking for the killer or
killers. A German-made Mauser rifle was found on a fifth floor land
i ing of an office building overlooking Main Street. One shell was
still in the chamber and three had been fired.
A TREMENDOUS TRAFFIC jam developed around Parkland
Hospital. White House officials stood by sorrowfully, looking

after minute there were conflicting rumors as to whether the Presi
dent was still alive. Then came the official announcement that John
Fitzgerald Kennedy, 35th President of the United States, was dead.
At Parkland Hospital, only physicians were reported in he
emergency surgery room when Kennedy died.
Dr. Malcolm Perry, 34, said "there was an entrance wound be
low his Adams' apple. There was another wound in the back of his
head."
Two of the 10 physicians in attendance said it was possible the
same bullet caused both wounds. They said it was possible he was
hit by two bullets, but they doubted it.
The President's throat was opened to relieve breathing. Blood
and fluids were administered intravenously. Physicians labored
to keep respiration at a life-sustaining level, but in vain.
Preparations were mide almost immediately after the Presi
dent's death to return his body to Washington. The body was car
ried from the hospital in a wooden casket and placed in a white
Cadillac hearse and the drapes were pulled. Mrs. Kennedy accom
panied the body.
Outside the hospital, blood was cleaned from the limousine. It
was parked outside the emergency entrance.
A yellow rose bouquet, presented to Mrs. Kennedy at Dallas
Live Field on their arrival a short time before, lay on the floor in
the back of the car.
Governor Connally was reported in serious condition and in
great pain.
Take care of Nellie (his wife)," he gasped to an aide. Connally
was hit in the chest. His office said the governor also suffered a
wrist wound and a "minor wound" in the leg.
THE WHITE HOUSE staff said Mrs. Kennedy would return
to Washington late today to be with her children, Caroline, 6, and

John Jr., who will be 3 next week.
The Kennedy party arrived in Dallas on a short plane hop from
nearby Carswell Air Force Base. The glowering, rainy skies that
had darkened Dallas during the day were clear.
The shooting occurred close to their destination—the new Trade
Mart where a bipartisan audience of 2,000 already had gathered to
hear the President's address.
As the presidential car nosed through crowded Main Street,
Kennedy sat on the right side of the back seat. Mrs. Kennedy was
on his left Connally faced the President in a jump seat. Mrs. Con
nally was in the jump seat facing Mrs. Kennedy.
