# Disbelief and Shock Typify Campus Reaction
## 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN 
Friday noon on Quad, and, like
any day at noon, the Quad is
almost empty. A boy wearing a
red and white Stanford jacket
stands at Engineering Corner.
He pulls a "Beat Cal" pin from
his jacket, and throws it to the
ground.
Another student approaches
him, "Have you heard—?" "Yes,
I've hear d." The two walk on
silently. The "Beat Cal" pin lies
on the ground.
The President of the nation is
dead, and Stanford, a university
whose daily life has little direct
relation to the actions of the men
in Washington, is a part of the
nation. In a moment of great
shock and disbelief comes the re
alization that America, a con
glomeration of peoples of vastly
different beliefs, interests, goals,
and daily lives, is one.
THE REACTION of the nation
as a whole is paralleled in the
groups of silent subdued students
crowded around television sets in
dormitory living rooms, listening
to the latest news bulletins.
Tresidder is packed; a group
of about 40 people stand in front
of the television set. The conver
sations at the tables revolve
around one topic and the tone is
the same. "I don't believe it," is
the most common remark "How?"
one girl asks, "it can'e be real."
But it is real, and with the first
reaction of stunned disbelief and
shock comes a fear of the un
known future. "What now?" a
student question. "Civil rights?"
"And Johnson's from Texas," a
: girl answers. "But he's President
now, and the office does mean
something," the boy responds.
1 "JOHNSON'S AN UNKNOWN
' to me," a woman says. "Kennedy,
at least, is—was," she corrects
the tense of the verb, but does
' not finish her sentence.
Again and again the same
words, "How?" "What now?" . . .
1 "Who could have believed it?"
1 and the response, "Who can be
lieve it now?" Almost every scn
• tence is punctuated by a verbal
exclamation point or question
mark; there are no ordinary state
ments; death is no ordinary thing,
' and the assassination of the Presi
dent is no ordinary death.
Two professors eating lunch in
' the old Union dining room look
at the reporter for a moment,
J shake their heads, "No comment,
' I don't have anything to say."
[ Christian Bay of the Institute of
> the Study of Human Problems,
I perhaps summarizes the reaction
' of everyone, whether their orien
tation is apolitical, liberal, or con
; servative, when he says,"I don't
know what to say ... a great

shock ... in terms of the wel
fare of the nation . . . unpredict
able consequences."
"We feel like we're in a coun
try as stable as South Viet Nam,"
a hasher at the dining room com
ments. A janitor stops sweeping
and remains silent for a moment,
"I feel pretty bad ... all the good
he's done . . . and his family, I
sympathize with his family."
A FEW STUDENTS question
each other, "They'll call off Big
Game, won't they?" "How could
they go ahead with it?" And a
Sigma Chi member leaves the
Dean of Men's office on his way
to his fraternity to begin tearing
down the house decorations.
And yet, perhaps because it is
a truism, the cliche that life does
go on regardless persists. The na
tion may mourn, but the daily
routine does not stop. The work
men in front of the post office
continue laying bricks; students
stand in long lines in front of
the registration office in order to
pre-register for winter quarter.
"How can all this still matter?"
one girl questions. But no one
leaves the line.
If the routine does go on, it
goes on with a subdued air. Few
people laugh. "I feel funny just
smiling," one girl says.
The unspoken question of the
state of America and in what di
rection the nation is going is indi
rectly commented on in a speech
by Dr. St. Clair Drake on the
Non-violent Negro Revolution.
Remembering a Negro student
demonstration, Dr. Drake speaks
of "The young people on their
knees in front of churches, say
ing, 'Father, forgive them for
they know not what they do.'"
He speaks not of bad people in
the South, but of a bad situation.
The problem in America today,
Dr. Drake says, is "to change the
situation so all people can act
like Americans."
The reporter leaves the building
and crosses Union Courtyard. A
girl passes by. She carries her
time schedule and pre-registration
cards. On the arm of her jacket
she has pinned a black band of
mourning.
A girl seated on a bench tells
the reporter, "I just don't feel as
though I know anything anymore.
But at least there's that." She is
looking at the black band of
mourning.

The unspoken question of the
state of America and in what di
rection the nation is going is indi
rectly commented on in a speech
by Dr. St. Clair Drake on the
Non-violent Negro Revolution.
Remembering a Negro student
demonstration, Dr. Drake speaks
of "The young people on their
knees in front of churches, say
ing, 'Father, forgive them for
they know not what they do.'"
He speaks not of bad people in
the South, but of a bad situation.
The problem in America today,
Dr. Drake says, is "to change the
situation so all people can act
like Americans."
The reporter leaves the building
and crosses Union Courtyard. A
girl passes by. She carries her
time schedule and pre-registration

she has pinned a black band of
mourning.

the reporter, "I just don't feel as
though I know anything anymore.
But at least there's that." She is

stands at Engineering Corner.

The President of the nation is
dead, and Stanford, a university

glomeration of peoples of vastly
different beliefs, interests, goals,
and daily lives, is one.

groups of silent subdued students
crowded around television sets in

"We feel like we're in a coun

a hasher at the dining room com

A FEW STUDENTS question
each other, "They'll call off Big

they go ahead with it?" And a
Sigma Chi member leaves the
Dean of Men's office on his way
to his fraternity to begin tearing
down the house decorations.
And yet, perhaps because it is
a truism, the cliche that life does
go on regardless persists. The na

routine does not stop. The work
men in front of the post office
continue laying bricks; students
stand in long lines in front of
the registration office in order to
pre-register for winter quarter.
"How can all this still matter?"
one girl questions. But no one

smiling," one girl says.
The unspoken question of the
state of America and in what di
rection the nation is going is indi
rectly commented on in a speech
by Dr. St. Clair Drake on the
Non-violent Negro Revolution.
Remembering a Negro student
demonstration, Dr. Drake speaks
of "The young people on their
knees in front of churches, say
ing, 'Father, forgive them for
they know not what they do.'"
He speaks not of bad people in
the South, but of a bad situation.
The problem in America today,
Dr. Drake says, is "to change the
situation so all people can act
like Americans."
The reporter leaves the building
and crosses Union Courtyard. A
girl passes by. She carries her
time schedule and pre-registration
cards. On the arm of her jacket
she has pinned a black band of
mourning.
A girl seated on a bench tells
the reporter, "I just don't feel as
though I know anything anymore.
But at least there's that." She is
looking at the black band of
mourning.
Friday noon on Quad, and, like
any day at noon, the Quad is
almost empty. A boy wearing a
red and white Stanford jacket
stands at Engineering Corner.
He pulls a "Beat Cal" pin from
his jacket, and throws it to the
ground.
Another student approaches
him, "Have you heard—?" "Yes,
I've hear d." The two walk on
silently. The "Beat Cal" pin lies
on the ground.
The President of the nation is
dead, and Stanford, a university
whose daily life has little direct
relation to the actions of the men
in Washington, is a part of the
nation. In a moment of great
shock and disbelief comes the re
alization that America, a con
glomeration of peoples of vastly
different beliefs, interests, goals,
and daily lives, is one.
THE REACTION of the nation
as a whole is paralleled in the
groups of silent subdued students
crowded around television sets in
dormitory living rooms, listening
to the latest news bulletins.
Tresidder is packed; a group
of about 40 people stand in front
of the television set. The conver
sations at the tables revolve
around one topic and the tone is
the same. "I don't believe it," is
the most common remark "How?"
one girl asks, "it can'e be real."
But it is real, and with the first
reaction of stunned disbelief and
shock comes a fear of the un
known future. "What now?" a
student question. "Civil rights?"
"And Johnson's from Texas," a
: girl answers. "But he's President
now, and the office does mean
something," the boy responds.
1 "JOHNSON'S AN UNKNOWN
' to me," a woman says. "Kennedy,
at least, is—was," she corrects
the tense of the verb, but does
' not finish her sentence.
Again and again the same
words, "How?" "What now?" . . .
1 "Who could have believed it?"
1 and the response, "Who can be
lieve it now?" Almost every scn
• tence is punctuated by a verbal
exclamation point or question
mark; there are no ordinary state
ments; death is no ordinary thing,
' and the assassination of the Presi
dent is no ordinary death.
