poses the harsh realities,
fears, anxieties and tensions
running rampant through today's campus generation.
Through dramatized case histories based on thousands
of interviews, the authors show how the socio-economic
patterns and the unrealistic goals and pressures in
America today arc creating problems of emotional ill
ness, sexual deviation and promiscuity, insecurity and
a lack of moral fiber in the lives of college students.
Here, too, are dynamic proposals for preventing these
emotional ills.
This is must reading for parents, students and all con
cerned with the college scene.
