# President Sterling Offers Questions at Church Service
## 
### 
As the Daily went to press Sun
day night, University President
Wallace Sterling released a part
of the tentative text of his re
marks delivered at the Memorial
Church Service held yesterday
morning in memorium of late
President John Kennedy.
President Sterling posed a
series of questions, after his gen
eral question of "why . . . have
we reacted as we have to the
death of John Fitzgerald Ken
nedy? ..."
"WAS IT BECAUSE of the of
fice he held? . . . We know that
that office is one of great burden
and influence; we also know that
that office does nol always re
ceive the respect which is its
due. . . .
"Was it because President Ken
nedy was struck down by assas
sination? If he had died from na
tural causes or even in an air
plane crash, would our reactions
have been the same? Deep sor
row there would have been, but
I doubt that it would have been
mingled with indignation. And
why are we indignant? Is it be
cause of the ruthless audacity of
the deed? Is it because the deed
was done against our head of
state? Remember that a police
man was slain in the perform
ance of his duty and that a Gov
ernor was seriously wounded.
Remember too that the suspected
assassin has himself been assas
sinated.
Are we as indignant as we are
ashamed?- ashamed of our short
comings as a nation and as citi
zens that our practice of law and
order is so conspicuously less
than our professions thereof. . . .
"EACH OF US might well seek
answers to questions such as
these. . . . We owe it to ourselves
to do so. We owe it to our new
President.. We owe it to the mem
ory of John Fitzgerald Kennedy."

The service opened with a
formal academic procession which
included the officers and deans
of the University, the executive
committee of the academic coun
cil, the denominational campus
chaplains, representatives oi the
campus units of the armed serv
ices, and several students. The
chaplain of the University led the
congregation in prayer.

Remember too that the suspected
assassin has himself been assas
sinated.

formal academic procession which
included the officers and deans
of the University, the executive
committee of the academic coun

chaplains, representatives oi the
campus units of the armed serv

chaplain of the University led the
congregation in prayer.

President Sterling posed a
series of questions, after his gen
eral question of "why . . . have
we reacted as we have to the
death of John Fitzgerald Ken
nedy? ..."
