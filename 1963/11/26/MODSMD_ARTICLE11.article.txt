# Students, faculty Express Sentiments on President's Death
## 
### PAUL STRASBURG 
No American who understands himself to be a part of the greater
force of humanity can remain unmoved by the death of President
Kennedy. In addition to fears that the continuity of the government
structure may have been drastically impaired; in addition to our
opinions of the character of the New Frontier; in addition to doubts
about the future of our loreign prestige, our foreign policy, our
internal affairs; in addition to all such considerations that may
weigh upon us at this time of sorrow, we should grieve for the
tragedy of a man who sought to make his life meaningful.
It is rare in the history of any nation that men of humane purpose i
and great energy enter the positions which enable them to uplift I
significantly the lives of their fellow men. It is rarer still that these
men have the force of character to rise above the institutions which
brought them to these heights. Perhaps John F. Kennedy was not
such a man. but he gave indications of being so. The tragedy which
should pierce us all is that one of those rare people who had traits of
energy a n d genuine concern for the lives of all men was not per
mitted to let these traits pursue their course.
And this should force the deferment of the political, sociologi
cal and historical questions that surround the loss of President Ken
nedy to the one question what does the loss mean for me - does
it tell me anything about my own endeavors among men?
I
It is difficult and probably undesirable to eulogize a man only
a few short hours after his death, and this is not our purpose this
evening. As inadequate as such an event makes men feel, we still
feel a need to do something postive. It is hoped that the reflections
of these men will add more meaning to our own deliberations.
The speaking order will be Mr. Wedin, Mr. Pease, Mr. Dornbush,
and finally Mr. Drckmcier.
By BUI) WEDIN
John Fitzgerald Kennedy, perhaps more than any other president
of the United Slates, held a vitality and meaning for the American
student that is truly amazing. There was something about the man
that virtually forced an identification with him, something that rep
resented ideals and purposes that were finely atuned with those of
America's students. The great identification that perhaps I or
great numbers of American students felt toward John Kennedy can
not be attributed to his youth alone. The youngest president of the
United States, il was yet the spirit that accompanied this youth which
was so encompassing. There have been many young and impressive
figures in American history in whom we could find no meaning;
here was one in whom we could.
In an age that is faced with more complexities and subtleties than
we have ever seen before, to think of tackling them is often depress
ing. Yet this is what American college students are thinking of
doing; they are looking without themselves to the world; they are
asking where they can wipe out inequality and where they can elimi
nate disease; they are working in Mississippi, in Asia, in Africa, and
in Latin America; and they are fighting against fear and prejudice
here in America.
THIS IS the spirit of idealism and empathy that aeled as the
common element between John Kennedy and the students of Ameri
ca. But perhaps the greatest achievement that Mr. Kennedy will be
remembered for is the fact that this was a latent idealism which was
during his term transformed into an active idealism. But this is only
one part of the paradox that he presented: the paradox of present
ing both an answer and a challenge. Or perhaps it was an answer
in the form of a challenge. Civil rights, the Peace Corps, the Na
tional Service Corps, world peace were such challenges. The fad
that the American student answered them speaks enough for the
skill and sensitivity of John Kennedy. His appreciation for the great
potential and ability of America's students could not help but be
answered by a similar feeling. This alone has made John Kennedy
a unique figure in the eyes of history.
There was also a common bond between John Kennedy and the
American student in the vision he foresaw, both of America and of
the world .He seldom narrowed his vision to the nation alone, but
saw its role in leading the world to peace and unity. In short, he
could not define America as a single nation, but rather only in vela
lion to the rest of mankind. I need not dwell on how encouraging
most of us found that vision.
ANYONE who has listened to his unbounded phrases and sen
sible idealism cannot help but see the identification I have outlined.
Yet some say this is the myth of John Kennedy, that the politician
underllying it is far different. But is seems quite obvious that myths
are built only around men who adapt themselves to the need for
particular myth in society. Truly, then, if about John Kennedy there
was a myth, it was one our society needed. If on the other hand,
John Kennedy was a politician, then I praise him for daring to be
a politician, for committing himself to a task that often strips men
of their empathv and idealism, a task that could not do <n to him.

It strikes me as singular that he was able to do both and to do them
so well.
To return briefly to what 1 called the myth surrounding John
Kennedy: It was not his myth, but ours. And not so much our myth
of him, but more our myth of a new American purpose, of a new na
tional concern and orientation, of a new direction in which to turn.
This was how he was elected and how he served, and in so serving
it began to become a reality, a reality that I hope will continue after
him.
WITH THE DEATH ol John Kennedy. I am reminded of an ex
perience I was once told: Years ago a close friend paid a visit to the
! Arlington National Cemetary; it was a beautiful spring day with
j light, clouds in the sky and blossoms on the cherry trees. Yet as he
; gazed serenly upon the rows of white crosses honoring the thousands
of dead American heroes, he was untouched, for death had no mean
ing for him.
Yet this is not so today, for the deatli of John Kennedy comes as
a shock to all of us. And one reason is that with his death seem also
to die many of the values and ideas we held with him. Particularly
as students, is it more than the death of a man or a political leader;
it is the death of someone who represented so much of what we
value and held to be good.
Yet. still, do we have the opportunity to move onward. John Ken
nedy will no longer be with us in this march, but his inspiration and
guide will always be manifest.
By OTIS PEASE
It is easy to see the death of John F. Kennedy as a personal trag
edy. We knew him as a man of intelligence, energy, and charm
and above all we knew him as a young man. More than any other
President in recent memory, many of us can identify ourselves with
him. Young men in professional life note his university degree, his
ability to use words that take us out of ourselves and remind us of
what we ought to be doing. The young businessman, the chemist,
the lawyer, can respond to all this and to his good fortune and wife,
and children, and friends. What young woman could fail to sense
for a moment her closeness to the President's wife whose life and
private dreams were surrendered to the public demands of her hus
band's office who bore him a child who did not live, and who this
morning held in her lap her husband's bleeding body — while he
died? What older man or woman did not see in him some of their
own fleeting dreams and wistful memories — and then, at least once,
wish him godspeed in his life and in his youth?
TO OTHERS of us he meant even more. He reminded us all that
wc are children or grandchildren of working people children of
city laborers, children of Catholics, children of Jews, children of Ne
groes — children of any people who chose to be Americans, and in
choosing made America their own. As those children, who among
us did not see in John P. Kennedy the fact and the hope that at last,
after 170 years, all of us may see in the Presidency the symbol of
our own acceptance — not acceptance for what we are, but accept
ance because we are because we exist? With this man we can
truly identify ourselves, and so his death is our personal tragedy
and on this, all of us, friend or foes of the President will find it
easy 1o unite in the way we think about him.
But I wonder if it is enough to think about him in this way?
When we mourn the death of John F. Kennedy, the intelligent young i
person who is so particularly our own president we pay him but :
part of the tribute we should be paying. Arc we willing also to re- |
member the things he truly stood for? In days to come, you may be
sure, public figures will remind us of his work, maybe even his
martyrdom, in the cause of a free world — they will proclaim, per
haps. the realistic liberalism of his foreign policy, his courage in
acknowledging responsibility for disaster off Cuba in 1%1 his far
greater courage off Cuba in October 1962 in weighing risk against
risk, in choosing to risk one kind ol security in order to win a greater
kind of security. We will be reminded of his efforts to persuade the
Nation and the Congress to face up to the Government's new and
inescapable responsibilities to secure economic vitality, to think
about economic problems in new ways, to find new national great
ness in new knowledge, and to support the social services of health
and welfare on which we all depend. Wc will be reminded above all
of his efforts to commit the National Government to an active part
in winning equal rights and opportunities for all Negroes.
IT IS YYEM. that we think of these things in remembering Mr.
Kennedy. A few Americans will remember these things with eon-1
tempt a few with bitterness and fear. Others may prefer to scorn
his career as that of a man who put politics ahead of principle, am- :
bit ion ahead of leadership. Hut 1 want tonight to remember some
thing else about John F. Kennedy, and to hope that in remembering 1
it one may be able to say to those who feared or scorned him or
deplored him - "your views are I
irrelevant to what was truly sig
nificant about the man."
What I prefer to remember
about him — beyond the obvious
i things - was his intelligence
| and courage in being a politician.
He chose to be a politician in a
day when few men who combine
his ability with his social stand
ing ever choose to be one. Har
vard and Yale Seniors — and
Stanford seniors — usually be
come lawyers, doctors, invest
. ment bankers, editors, oil refin
ers, civil servants, engineers, pro
fessors, advisers to politicians —
but not politicians. Mr. Kennedy
furthermore chose to be a profes
sional politician — not just the
part-time amateur, serving on the
I School Board or in the foreign
service, or helping the party by
winning a one-shot elective office.
He committed himself to politics
as a way of life, and he faced the
consequences — and whenever
that happens, the nation is th e
gainer. And that is especially how
I want to remember him.
IS THIS SO very special a vir
tue in our life? I believe it is,
and I am certain that, it always
was. It is special because of what
it asks an intelligent and courage
ous man to do. He must want to
run for office — he must angle
for it, speak for it, make deals
for it. He must compromise his
ideals under conditions so am
biguous that his idealistic friends
will never fully understand him—
and will probably desert him. He
must seem warm when he is cold,
and cold when he is deeply
moved. He must want power,
and, getting power, he must be
willing to hurt people as well as
to help people. He must s t a n d
suspected of wanting to hurt
people when he does not want to.
He must put party ahead of prin
ciple often enough to be certain
he has a party strong enough to
act for principle. A politician
must remain silent when other
more righteous men are free to
speak, free to run up banners, or
free to charge the enemy. He
must seem to follow while lead
ing and must seem to lead while
listening. Above all, he must
compromise. What does this
mean in politics? It means that
he must usually be willing to set
tle for the possible — plus 10 per
cent. He must do so day in and
day out — and yet he must never
allow his ability to stand for
principle become rusty from dis
use — for in perhaps one deci
sion out of every five or ten, he
must have the intelligence and
courage to decide wholly on the
basis of principle. This is why
the good and truly professional
politician must be a man of rare
virtue. That is why they are so
rare.
THIS WAS the distinction of
I Abraham Lincoln. To the dispair
of Ihe radicals, Lincoln compro
mised on slavery. To the anger
j of the conservatives he issued
! the Proclamation ending slavery.
He was derided for playing party
politics, deplored for not seeming
i to lead, criticized for seeming all
: things to all men. But in most
; ways that counted and still count,
j hp was right, and his critics were
i wrong. He was a professional
I politician - he continually set
| tied for the possible — plus 10
j per cent. What he preserved for
us — and gained for us — is a
| nation.
And this is what I would most
like to remember about John F.
Kennedy. In our time and for
our needs he became the politi
cian of good and rare virtue. He
made it possible — as all profes
sional and good politicians have
done before him — for men to
continue to talk to one another
and to deal with one another in
a nation of divided — and some
times bitter — men. And because
he did this — because of his ex
cellence as a politician, even more
than because of his belief in cer
tain priciples — he became o u r
President, and he became a good
one. And because he was Presi
dent, a man who sought to gain

| something by killing the Presi-
I dent, killed him.
By SAN FORI) IK)UNBUSCH
The sudden death of our Presi
dent is particularly poignant be
cause he was so young. In a
academic community, full of stu
dents, where youth is king, death
is for old people. Death is for
those who have lived their lives
and achieved their goals. Now
we have a sudden reminder that
in the midst of death, we live.
President Kennedy was unpre
pared for death, but we are all
unprepared. Men and women
cling to life long after the young
expect them to await the grave
yard with anticipation. Nobody is
prepared.
IF WE were able to specify the
hour of our death, we would bo
unhappy. It is the very uncer
tainty of the amount of time re
maining to us which gives each
hour a special potential for bliss.
We can all rejoice that President
Kennedy had many a happy hour.
EACH OF US knows that he
can be replaced. Each of us re
sents that perception, wanting to
feel that his contributions are
unique and irreplaceable. In an
other sense, however, this is an
appropriate symbol of our inter
connectedness. We live in a bu
reaucratic world, and the proc
esses of bureaucracy keep fools
from disaster and great men
from glory.
This pressure towards the mid
dle is at least in part balanced
by the ability of the society and
organization to continue long
after the great leader has passed
on. Continuity of leadership is
assured, a part of the system. We
will have that continuity.
All of us know that as Ameri
cans we share a common destiny.
This degrading violence has pre
sented us all with a crisis. Under
these circumstances, we feel close
to one another; we want to re
assure each other that our efforts
will be joined. When we change
leaders, the voices of opposition
are, for a brief time, stilled. Then
the croak of dissension will again
be heard. Some will object, but
our democratic processes require
freedom to disagree with any
leader or any successor. No bar
rier to free discussion and con
troversy is faithful to the mem
ory of President Kennedy.
IN THE MIDST of our grief,
we may ask why we are shocked.
Would we be shocked were Presi
dent Kennedy to have died after
a long illness, or as shocked if
he beeamc an additional victim
for the automobile? I doubt it.
The shock is the product of the
violation of the rule of law and
the normative standards of fair
play which are basic to our politi
cal system. These assumptions
must not be violated, and our
shock reflects the fact that vio
lence has been done to our as
sumptions.
John F. Kennedy lived a full
life, cramming it full of good
things. Although his death cut
short his opportunity for making
more than a down payment on
his ideals, he was able to lead
us a little way towards the solu
tion of the three great problems
of our day. We are a little closer
towards peace and the satisfac
tion of the revolution of rising
expectations. We have made
measurable progress in the area
of civil rights and liberties. For
our minority group citizens, the
recent progress is irreversible.
Our current ethnic tension is
merely a product of swift change.
The developments that have
made peace and the decline of
ethnocentrism a little more likely
had also better be irreversible,
for our lives are the stakes in the
game.
Politics used to be considered
either the superstructure over
an economic foundation or else
the playing field for cheap poli
ticians. Today politics is far too
important to each of us to be
left to ward heelers. John F. Ken
nedy was a politician with ideas,
combining ideals with knowledge

of iho possible. Hp never left the
polities to someone else, for he
knew that statesmanship requires
a political base. We can emulate
his example in part, for each of
us has a mandate to be socially
concerned and politically potent.
To do otherwise is to be unfaith
ful to our duty to ourselves and
to our society.
I AM, of course, already speak
to us, the living, the only possible
audience. For us, there is one
further injunction. Tomorrow,
and probably for the rest of our
lives, there will be many oppor
tunities for each of us to stand
firm for the rule of law and
against the appeal to violence.
Today's tragedy is an example of
the loss of constraint, as are
this evening's screams for ven
geance and retribution. Life in
society demands that we often
bridle our passions. We must not
only control ourselves, but we
must also speak and act in oppo
sition to those who would sub
vert the rule of law, even with
the best of intentions. It is easy
to be opposed lo violence when
the rights of persons like our
selves are threatened. Jt is hard
er, and more important, to take
as the primary value the sur
vival of the system itself, especi
ally when our impulse is for ac
tion against some person, group,
or nation. That is the nobler
stance, and a proper heritage
from the life of John F. Kennedy.
By CHARLES DREKMEIER
I find it still very hard to com
prehend what happened this
morning, what happened 1o all
of us. I'd like to return to the
question with which Mr. Stras
burg began, "What does this
mean for us?" and to the ques
tion asked by Mr. Dornbuseh, "We
are stunned, and why is this?"
We pride ourselves in being a
mature people, without the need
for an inspirational leader. We
pride ourselves in the continuity
of our political institutions. This
is what we must be most thankful
for in this hour: because the
Presidency is not dead.
We are deeply, deeply dis
turbed for many reasons and we
have to see ourselves now in a
somewhat different light, o u r
selves as a people and as individ
uals. Because we have been an
example to the world. It is true
that we are not as popular in the
world as we once were, but this
has always been the great coun
try of security and safety, and
order. The despair is revealed
in the statement by a spokesman
of the government of Brazil, "How
can you Americans allow your
President to bo killed? Your two
presidents who fought for eman
cipation are both dead at th e
hand of an assassin."
THIS MONTH began with an
assassination in the far off city
of Saigon. We find it easy lo ex
cuse in other parts of the world,

but we don't expect these things
to happen in America.
The study of political order be
gins with the great question,
"How is order possible when we
know that one man is capable of
immense damage, but no one man
can do very much good?"
We wonder about the way wo
have institutionalized power.
We've given tremendous respon
sihilil ies to one man to make it
possible for one man to do much
good if he wishes. And yet, this
is still a man, of vulnerable flesh,
who, because ho lives in this kind
of state and is elected by the
people, who wished to ride in an
open car, not protected by bullet
proof glass. And he is the one
official who represents all th e
people. This President, this par
ticular President, wished to rep
resent all people, regardless of
color.
WE AMERICANS take politi
cal life, take politics, take this
often unwieldy struggle for
granted. We have to take politics
for granted, or I suppose it won't
really function very well. We
tend too often to see only selfish
motives in politicians. But I sus
pect for all of us here the office
of the Presidency will never be
the same again. It has acquired
a new meaning for us and, I hope,
a new appreciation for the politi
cal.

POLITICS exist because con
flirt exists, because there are
many interests among tlie people,
and it exists because men prefer
peaceful means of resolving these
conflicts.
Yet there is violence, perhaps
always there will he violence. And
the President may some times
have to draw the fire.
None of us know yet the mo
lives of the man who assassinated
President Kennedy. But whether
or not it was related to the civil
rights issue, we know that in
some indirect sense, at least, it
is. We know that the Governor
of Texas was extremely worried
about this trip. If it wasn't this
instance, it coidd have been the
next.
Sometimes we worry because
civil rights has been reduced 10
political techniques, to compro
mise, to give and take, to this
kind of prosaic experience. And
yet now we know that it must
be kept a political problem as we
know what the alternatives are.
We know in a very dramatic way.
I, MYSELF, worry about the
consequences of this for our
country in the nevt few years.
It is possible that terrible re
strictions on free debate may re
sult. It is true that these demo
cratic institutions go on, but they
don't always go on so smoothly,
and we may be in for a very hard
time. And yet free debate is ab
solutely crucial. Without it, there
is no political process.
President Kennedy, speaking
this morning, had said that we
live in a very complex world, and
there aren't any simple solutions.
That bullet seems perhaps to
make a mockery of his statement,
but, of course, nothing is solved
in this kind of action.
We've all seen ourselves in a
new light today. I know that
when I first heard this news this
morning, my reaction, my im
mediate reaction, was one of ha
tred, for people of the city, some
of those citizens a few weeks ago
could spit in the face of Adlai
Stevenson. And I am very
ashamed of myself for this ha
tred, the one resource we have
when we are at a complete loss.
There are many people who do
hate, who hate all the time. These
people have killed Medgar Evars,
Birmingham Sunday School girls,
perhaps also President Kennedy.
There have been many killings
in the last few months. . . .
I don't know anything else to
say. I would hope that perhaps
we could sit quietly together for
a minute and then go home.
