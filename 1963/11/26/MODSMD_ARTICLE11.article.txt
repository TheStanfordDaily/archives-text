# Students, faculty Express Sentiments on President's Death

### PAUL STRASBURG 
No American who understands himself to be a part of the greater
force of humanity can remain unmoved by the death of President
Kennedy. In addition to fears that the continuity of the government
structure may have been drastically impaired; in addition to our
opinions of the character of the New Frontier; in addition to doubts
about the future of our loreign prestige, our foreign policy, our
internal affairs; in addition to all such considerations that may
weigh upon us at this time of sorrow, we should grieve for the
tragedy of a man who sought to make his life meaningful.
It is rare in the history of any nation that men of humane purpose i
and great energy enter the positions which enable them to uplift I
significantly the lives of their fellow men. It is rarer still that these
men have the force of character to rise above the institutions which
brought them to these heights. Perhaps John F. Kennedy was not
such a man. but he gave indications of being so. The tragedy which
should pierce us all is that one of those rare people who had traits of
energy a n d genuine concern for the lives of all men was not per
mitted to let these traits pursue their course.
And this should force the deferment of the political, sociologi
cal and historical questions that surround the loss of President Ken
nedy to the one question what does the loss mean for me - does
it tell me anything about my own endeavors among men?

It is difficult and probably undesirable to eulogize a man only
a few short hours after his death, and this is not our purpose this
evening. As inadequate as such an event makes men feel, we still
feel a need to do something postive. It is hoped that the reflections
of these men will add more meaning to our own deliberations.
The speaking order will be Mr. Wedin, Mr. Pease, Mr. Dornbush,
and finally Mr. Drckmcier.

John Fitzgerald Kennedy, perhaps more than any other president
of the United Slates, held a vitality and meaning for the American
student that is truly amazing. There was something about the man
that virtually forced an identification with him, something that rep
resented ideals and purposes that were finely atuned with those of
America's students. The great identification that perhaps I or
great numbers of American students felt toward John Kennedy can
not be attributed to his youth alone. The youngest president of the
United States, il was yet the spirit that accompanied this youth which
was so encompassing. There have been many young and impressive
figures in American history in whom we could find no meaning;
here was one in whom we could.
In an age that is faced with more complexities and subtleties than
we have ever seen before, to think of tackling them is often depress
ing. Yet this is what American college students are thinking of
doing; they are looking without themselves to the world; they are
asking where they can wipe out inequality and where they can elimi
nate disease; they are working in Mississippi, in Asia, in Africa, and
in Latin America; and they are fighting against fear and prejudice
here in America.
THIS IS the spirit of idealism and empathy that aeled as the
common element between John Kennedy and the students of Ameri
ca. But perhaps the greatest achievement that Mr. Kennedy will be
remembered for is the fact that this was a latent idealism which was
during his term transformed into an active idealism. But this is only
one part of the paradox that he presented: the paradox of present
ing both an answer and a challenge. Or perhaps it was an answer
in the form of a challenge. Civil rights, the Peace Corps, the Na
tional Service Corps, world peace were such challenges. The fad
that the American student answered them speaks enough for the
skill and sensitivity of John Kennedy. His appreciation for the great
potential and ability of America's students could not help but be
answered by a similar feeling. This alone has made John Kennedy
a unique figure in the eyes of history.
There was also a common bond between John Kennedy and the
American student in the vision he foresaw, both of America and of
the world .He seldom narrowed his vision to the nation alone, but
saw its role in leading the world to peace and unity. In short, he
could not define America as a single nation, but rather only in vela
lion to the rest of mankind. I need not dwell on how encouraging
most of us found that vision.
ANYONE who has listened to his unbounded phrases and sen
sible idealism cannot help but see the identification I have outlined.
Yet some say this is the myth of John Kennedy, that the politician
underllying it is far different. But is seems quite obvious that myths
are built only around men who adapt themselves to the need for
particular myth in society. Truly, then, if about John Kennedy there
was a myth, it was one our society needed. If on the other hand,
John Kennedy was a politician, then I praise him for daring to be
a politician, for committing himself to a task that often strips men
of their empathv and idealism, a task that could not do <n to him.

It strikes me as singular that he was able to do both and to do them
so well.
To return briefly to what 1 called the myth surrounding John
Kennedy: It was not his myth, but ours. And not so much our myth
of him, but more our myth of a new American purpose, of a new na
tional concern and orientation, of a new direction in which to turn.
This was how he was elected and how he served, and in so serving
it began to become a reality, a reality that I hope will continue after
him.
WITH THE DEATH ol John Kennedy. I am reminded of an ex
perience I was once told: Years ago a close friend paid a visit to the
! Arlington National Cemetary; it was a beautiful spring day with
j light, clouds in the sky and blossoms on the cherry trees. Yet as he
; gazed serenly upon the rows of white crosses honoring the thousands
of dead American heroes, he was untouched, for death had no mean
ing for him.
Yet this is not so today, for the deatli of John Kennedy comes as
a shock to all of us. And one reason is that with his death seem also
to die many of the values and ideas we held with him. Particularly
as students, is it more than the death of a man or a political leader;
it is the death of someone who represented so much of what we
value and held to be good.
Yet. still, do we have the opportunity to move onward. John Ken
nedy will no longer be with us in this march, but his inspiration and
guide will always be manifest.

It is easy to see the death of John F. Kennedy as a personal trag
edy. We knew him as a man of intelligence, energy, and charm
and above all we knew him as a young man. More than any other
President in recent memory, many of us can identify ourselves with
him. Young men in professional life note his university degree, his
ability to use words that take us out of ourselves and remind us of
what we ought to be doing. The young businessman, the chemist,
the lawyer, can respond to all this and to his good fortune and wife,
and children, and friends. What young woman could fail to sense
for a moment her closeness to the President's wife whose life and
private dreams were surrendered to the public demands of her hus
band's office who bore him a child who did not live, and who this
morning held in her lap her husband's bleeding body — while he
died? What older man or woman did not see in him some of their
own fleeting dreams and wistful memories — and then, at least once,
wish him godspeed in his life and in his youth?
TO OTHERS of us he meant even more. He reminded us all that
wc are children or grandchildren of working people children of
city laborers, children of Catholics, children of Jews, children of Ne
groes — children of any people who chose to be Americans, and in
choosing made America their own. As those children, who among
us did not see in John P. Kennedy the fact and the hope that at last,
after 170 years, all of us may see in the Presidency the symbol of
our own acceptance — not acceptance for what we are, but accept
ance because we are because we exist? With this man we can
truly identify ourselves, and so his death is our personal tragedy
and on this, all of us, friend or foes of the President will find it
easy 1o unite in the way we think about him.
But I wonder if it is enough to think about him in this way?
When we mourn the death of John F. Kennedy, the intelligent young i
person who is so particularly our own president we pay him but :
part of the tribute we should be paying. Arc we willing also to re- |
member the things he truly stood for? In days to come, you may be
sure, public figures will remind us of his work, maybe even his
martyrdom, in the cause of a free world — they will proclaim, per
haps. the realistic liberalism of his foreign policy, his courage in
acknowledging responsibility for disaster off Cuba in 1%1 his far
greater courage off Cuba in October 1962 in weighing risk against
risk, in choosing to risk one kind ol security in order to win a greater
kind of security. We will be reminded of his efforts to persuade the
Nation and the Congress to face up to the Government's new and
inescapable responsibilities to secure economic vitality, to think
about economic problems in new ways, to find new national great
ness in new knowledge, and to support the social services of health
and welfare on which we all depend. Wc will be reminded above all
of his efforts to commit the National Government to an active part
in winning equal rights and opportunities for all Negroes.
IT IS YYEM. that we think of these things in remembering Mr.
Kennedy. A few Americans will remember these things with eon-1
tempt a few with bitterness and fear. Others may prefer to scorn
his career as that of a man who put politics ahead of principle, am- :
bit ion ahead of leadership. Hut 1 want tonight to remember some
thing else about John F. Kennedy, and to hope that in remembering 1
it one may be able to say to those who feared or scorned him or
