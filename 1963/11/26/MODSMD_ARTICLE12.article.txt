# Solemn Students Gather to Hear Memorial Speeches
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
Nine hours after the President's death, an estimated 4,000 mem
bers of the Stanford community gathered in and around Dinkelspiel
auditorium and in Memorial Auditorium. Bud Wedin, Otis Pease.
Sanford Dornbuseh, and Charles Drekmeier addressed the gathering
from Dinkelspiel; their remarks were introduced by Paul Strasburg.

There were many themes and*
many words delivered before the
totally silent audience. And there
were recurrent expressions of
shame, of thankfulness for our
ability to continue, of a new
meaning of the political as epito
mized by the late President.
The tenor was set by Paul
Strasburg, who stated that the
purpose of the evening was not
to eulogize, but ". . . that the re
flections of these men will add
more meaning to our own deliber
ations."
THE GREAT identification of
the American student with the
late President was noted by Bud
Wedin. He spoke of the Ameri
can college students who are
"looking without," working in
Mississippi, in Asia, in the Peace
Corps, whose "latent idealism
was brought to the surface dur
ing his administration."
The national identification with

►
the late President was captured
by the words of Otis Pease:
"Young men in professional life
note his university degree, hi s
ability to use words that take us
out of ourselves. . . . What young
woman could fail to sense for a
moment her closeness to the
President's wife whose life a n d
private dreams were surrendered
to the public demands of her hus
band's office — who bore him a
child who did not live, and who
this morning held in her lap her
husband's bleeding body — while
he died? . . . what older man or
woman did not see in him some
of their own fleeting dreams and
wistful memories. . . ."
PEASE EMPHASIZED, "What
1 prefer to remember about him
. . . was his intelligence and cour
age in being a politician ... in
a day when few men who com
bine his ability with his social
standing ever choose to be one."
Pease outlined the constant neces
sity for compromise, for pragma
tism. for seeming inattention to
principle on the part of the politi
cian, yet ". . . in perhaps one deci
sion out of every five or ten, he
must have the intelligence and
courage to decide wholly on the
basis of principle. This is why
the good and truly professional
politician must be a man of rare
virtue." And this, said Pease, is
what John Fitzgerald Kennedy
was.
Sanford Dornbuseh expressed
his belief in the continuity of our
system. "We live in a bureau-

cratie world, and the processes of
bureaucracy keep fools from dis
aster and great men from glory."
He said that soon the croak of
dissension and partisanship
would be heard again, but to bar
this would be unfaithful to the
late President. What we must
bar is the impulse to action over
ruling the rule of law."
LESS THAN fifteen hours after
Dornbusch's appeal to the rule
of law, the suspected assassin of
the President was himself dead
of an assassin's bullet.
Charles Drekmeier pose d
a classic question: "How is order
possible when we know that one
man is capable of immense dam
age, but no one man can do very
much good?" He expressed the
feeling that "the office of th e
Presidency will never be the
same again. Il has acquired a
new meaning for us ... a new
meaning for ihe political."
THE ASSASSINATION was at
least indirectly related to what
Kennedy tried to do in the field
of civil rights, stated Drekmeier,
a man who voiced his personal
concern for the possible conse
pences of the assassination, t he
possibility of terrible restrictions
on free debate.
And Charles Drekmeier spoke
i of being ashamed, of the many
who hate, of the many killings
in the last few months.
At the close of Drekmeier's
words, the audience sat together
j in silence for a moment before
leaving.

what John Fitzgerald Kennedy
was.
Sanford Dornbuseh expressed
his belief in the continuity of our

He said that soon the croak of
dissension and partisanship
would be heard again, but to bar
this would be unfaithful to the
late President. What we must
bar is the impulse to action over
ruling the rule of law."
LESS THAN fifteen hours after
Dornbusch's appeal to the rule
of law, the suspected assassin of
the President was himself dead
of an assassin's bullet.
Charles Drekmeier pose d
a classic question: "How is order
possible when we know that one
man is capable of immense dam
age, but no one man can do very
much good?" He expressed the
feeling that "the office of th e
Presidency will never be the
same again. Il has acquired a
new meaning for us ... a new
meaning for ihe political."
THE ASSASSINATION was at
least indirectly related to what
Kennedy tried to do in the field
of civil rights, stated Drekmeier,
a man who voiced his personal
concern for the possible conse
pences of the assassination, t he
possibility of terrible restrictions
on free debate.
And Charles Drekmeier spoke
i of being ashamed, of the many
who hate, of the many killings
in the last few months.
At the close of Drekmeier's
words, the audience sat together
j in silence for a moment before
leaving.
Nine hours after the President's death, an estimated 4,000 mem
bers of the Stanford community gathered in and around Dinkelspiel
auditorium and in Memorial Auditorium. Bud Wedin, Otis Pease.
Sanford Dornbuseh, and Charles Drekmeier addressed the gathering
from Dinkelspiel; their remarks were introduced by Paul Strasburg.

There were many themes and*
many words delivered before the
totally silent audience. And there
were recurrent expressions of
shame, of thankfulness for our
ability to continue, of a new
meaning of the political as epito
mized by the late President.
The tenor was set by Paul
Strasburg, who stated that the
purpose of the evening was not
to eulogize, but ". . . that the re
flections of these men will add
more meaning to our own deliber
ations."
THE GREAT identification of
the American student with the
late President was noted by Bud
Wedin. He spoke of the Ameri
can college students who are
"looking without," working in
Mississippi, in Asia, in the Peace
Corps, whose "latent idealism
was brought to the surface dur
ing his administration."
The national identification with

►
the late President was captured
by the words of Otis Pease:
"Young men in professional life
note his university degree, hi s
ability to use words that take us
out of ourselves. . . . What young
woman could fail to sense for a
moment her closeness to the
President's wife whose life a n d
private dreams were surrendered
to the public demands of her hus
band's office — who bore him a
child who did not live, and who
this morning held in her lap her
husband's bleeding body — while
he died? . . . what older man or
woman did not see in him some
of their own fleeting dreams and
wistful memories. . . ."
PEASE EMPHASIZED, "What
1 prefer to remember about him
. . . was his intelligence and cour
age in being a politician ... in
a day when few men who com
bine his ability with his social
standing ever choose to be one."
Pease outlined the constant neces
sity for compromise, for pragma
tism. for seeming inattention to
principle on the part of the politi
cian, yet ". . . in perhaps one deci

must have the intelligence and

many words delivered before the
totally silent audience. And there
were recurrent expressions of
shame, of thankfulness for our
ability to continue, of a new
meaning of the political as epito
mized by the late President.
The tenor was set by Paul
Strasburg, who stated that the
purpose of the evening was not
to eulogize, but ". . . that the re
flections of these men will add
more meaning to our own deliber
ations."
THE GREAT identification of
the American student with the
late President was noted by Bud
Wedin. He spoke of the Ameri
can college students who are
"looking without," working in
Mississippi, in Asia, in the Peace
Corps, whose "latent idealism
was brought to the surface dur
ing his administration."
The national identification with

►
the late President was captured
by the words of Otis Pease:
"Young men in professional life
note his university degree, hi s
ability to use words that take us
out of ourselves. . . . What young
woman could fail to sense for a
moment her closeness to the
President's wife whose life a n d
private dreams were surrendered
to the public demands of her hus
band's office — who bore him a
child who did not live, and who
this morning held in her lap her
husband's bleeding body — while
he died? . . . what older man or
woman did not see in him some
of their own fleeting dreams and
wistful memories. . . ."
PEASE EMPHASIZED, "What
1 prefer to remember about him
. . . was his intelligence and cour
age in being a politician ... in
a day when few men who com
bine his ability with his social
standing ever choose to be one."
Pease outlined the constant neces
sity for compromise, for pragma
tism. for seeming inattention to
principle on the part of the politi
cian, yet ". . . in perhaps one deci
sion out of every five or ten, he
must have the intelligence and
courage to decide wholly on the
basis of principle. This is why
the good and truly professional
politician must be a man of rare
virtue." And this, said Pease, is
what John Fitzgerald Kennedy
was.
Sanford Dornbuseh expressed
his belief in the continuity of our
system. "We live in a bureau-

cratie world, and the processes of
bureaucracy keep fools from dis
aster and great men from glory."
He said that soon the croak of
dissension and partisanship
would be heard again, but to bar
this would be unfaithful to the
late President. What we must
bar is the impulse to action over
ruling the rule of law."
LESS THAN fifteen hours after
Dornbusch's appeal to the rule
of law, the suspected assassin of
the President was himself dead
of an assassin's bullet.
Charles Drekmeier pose d
a classic question: "How is order
possible when we know that one
man is capable of immense dam
age, but no one man can do very
much good?" He expressed the
feeling that "the office of th e
Presidency will never be the
same again. Il has acquired a
new meaning for us ... a new
meaning for ihe political."
THE ASSASSINATION was at
least indirectly related to what
Kennedy tried to do in the field
of civil rights, stated Drekmeier,
a man who voiced his personal
concern for the possible conse
pences of the assassination, t he
possibility of terrible restrictions
on free debate.
And Charles Drekmeier spoke
i of being ashamed, of the many
who hate, of the many killings
in the last few months.
At the close of Drekmeier's
words, the audience sat together
j in silence for a moment before
leaving.
Nine hours after the President's death, an estimated 4,000 mem
bers of the Stanford community gathered in and around Dinkelspiel
auditorium and in Memorial Auditorium. Bud Wedin, Otis Pease.
