"Let us not be petty when our cause is so groat. . . .
"Let use not quarrel amongst ourselves when our nation's
future is at stake. Let us stand together with renewed confi
dence in our cause — united in our heritage of the past and
our hopes for the future — and determined that this land we
love shall lead all mankind into new frontiers of peace and
abundance. . . .
"We in this country, in this generation, are — by destiny
rather than choice — the watchmen on the walls of world
freedom. We ask, therefore, that we may be worthy of our
power and responsibility — that we may exercise our strength
with wisdom and restraint — and that we may achieve in our
time and for all time the ancient vision of 'peace on earth,
good will toward men.' That must always be our goal — and
the righteousness of our cause must always underlie our
strength. For as was written long ago: 'except the Lord keep
the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.'"
