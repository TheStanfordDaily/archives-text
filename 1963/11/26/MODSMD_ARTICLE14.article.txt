# Torch Has Been Passed
## 
### BILL SMITH Co-Associate Editor 
A man died a little after one
o'clock in the afternoon (CST)
on Friday, November 22, in Dal
las, Texas, of gunshot wounds.
That is fact. From this
point, whatever emotions or
thoughts motivate men will be
expressed, by those capable of
their expression and those not
so capable. And this is just and
right in a democracy where
people must know the available
alternatives.
That the man John Kennedy is
dead demands expression of sor
row and sympathy to his family;
that he died in the circumstances
and at the age he did re-inforce
this sorrow.
THAT THE LEADER John
Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead eli
cits grave concern; that he died
in the circumstances he did deep
ens this concern and raises ques
tions about the future courses of
the people and the country Ken
nedy loved so well.
There is, or was, a belief in
America that "it can't happen
here." Coups, assassinations,
Juntas, military take-overs, are
all things that are found in the
banana republics of Latin Amer
ica or in the middle east or in
Africa — but not here, and most
of all, not in the twentieth cen
tury. We had assassinations in
the past, deporable incidents, but
we've outgrown them; now that
we are the most developed na
tion, now that we are the leader
of the world — those things don't
happen here. But John F. Ken
nedy is dead, and we must cast
about for new stereotypes and
we must invent new criteria for
assuming that, as individual
people, we are superior to any
one else in the world.
Somebody said to me, "They
caught the communist who did
't" And somebody else said,
"His civil right bill hasn't even
passed!" Let s rush out and lynch
-ome K r>dv rirrht away — that'll
solve the problem. Or as a second

alternative, let's choose a group
as whipping boy awl then pass
out the whips — maybe the right
wing, or the segregationists, or
the communists, or maybe it was
a Russian agent.
IF BLAME MUST be placed,
let's put it where it belongs: on
the present generation, on past
generations, on history, on the
whites and the Negroes, on those
who preach civil disobedience
without preaching civil respon
sibility, on the irresponsible part
of the right and on the same part
of the left, on the average "Joe
Blow" who hates cops and trys
everything he thinks he can get
away with — who doesn't give a
damn about the rights of his fel
low man, who preaches the doc
trine "The hell with you buddy,
I got mine"—in short, the blame
must be put on every American,
perhaps not equally, but that is
where the blame must be put.
One man pulled the trigger, but
in a larger sense, we all loaded
the rifle.
In the coming days, and weeks,
the politicians, journalists and
the people will begin to try to de
termine the courses to be fol
lowed — try to determine what of
the Kennedy program can be sal
vaged. try to determine what of
the Kennedy hopes can be saved.
That is not my purpose here.
Rather, I ask that the man not
be ignored when looking at the
leader, nor the leader, when look
ing at the man. That the faults
be openly admitted as well as the
virtues. But that above all, the
hopes and the spirit of John F.
Kennedy, which he himself, best
expressed, be preserved and ex
tended.
"LET THE WORD go forth
from this time and place, to
friend and foe alike, that the
torch has been passed to a new
generation of Americans—born
in this century, tempered by war,
disciplined by a cold and bitter
peace."
It is up to us of this new gen
eration to demand that Kennedy's
voice still bo heard.
