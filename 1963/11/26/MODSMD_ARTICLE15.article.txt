IN MEMORIAM
(EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing 1 statement was issued
011 behalf of the Stanford
Young Democrats by SYD
President Bob Konka.)
Editor, The Daily:
Wo, as Democrats, have lost a
great leader. We, as Americans,
have lost a great President. We,
as citizens of the world have lost
*\ great statesman. And we, as
numan beings, have lost a rare
individual, a man of warmth, in
telligence and courage, a man
who believed that he was justi
fied in his ideals only to the ex
tent that he acted upon them.
President Kennedy ascribed to
the definition of happiness form
ulated by the ancient Greeks: the
opportunity to develop one's capa
bilities to their fullest extent
along lines of excellence. F or
the President, happiness was the
spirit of a good fight, the strug
gle for a worthy cause; it was
meeting a challenge with courage
and grace and confidence. And
so we need not feel sorry for
President Kennedy — he lived a
happy life. Rather, our sorrow
and our sympathy goes out to
the First Lady, to the Kennedy
family, and finally to our country
and ourselves. We have lost a
true friend.
The President was harangued
by extremists from the right as
well as the left. Yet, the same
cries of "radical" or "opportun
ist" which were leveled at the
President were also heard in the
times of Abrahnm Lincoln and
Franklin Roosevelt.
It has been said that greatness
is a potential quality which may
only bo tested during times of
national crisis. In the Cuban con
frontation and tho successful ne
gotiation of a self-enforcing nu
clear test ban treaty, President
Kennedy exhibited those qualities
which differentiate a statesman

i
| from a politician, although he
! was both. The President sym
bolized for us tho political man
he practiced politics as the art
of the possible.
Some have said that President
Kennedy drew his own profile in
courage when he placed his politi
cal reputation directly on the
line by initiating the most sweep
ing Civil Rights legislation since
the administration of Lincoln.
That he will not now have to face
the consequences of this great
committment in November of
1964 is irrelevant. He chcrished
the ideal of human dignity and
freedom — and he acted upon it.
It is for us — the new genera
tion of Americans to whom he
has passed the torch — to resume
with courage his great struggle
for peace with justice and the
freedom of man.
—808 KONKA, President
Stanford Young Democrats
Editor, The Daily:
Let us give thanks, friends, for
we are truly the chosen ones, a
paragon among the peoples, a
conscience to the world, a nation
among nations. Let us raise up
our voices in a unison of self
praise and despise those who turn
not to follow us, for we are good;
we hold the truth; we are the liv
ing virtue.
Rut wait. Before we once more
carol forth our song of adulation,
let us pause in hymn of rem
brance for a fellow, shot by an
assassin bullet, killed by his coun-
Irymen, pulled from his position
at the front of our ranks.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy, 34th
President of the United States,
is dead today. Let us mourn his
passing. Then may we once more
stoop to our appointed task —to I
save the world in all humility,
of course, we who cannot save
ourselves.
-—OAKY A. PATTON
