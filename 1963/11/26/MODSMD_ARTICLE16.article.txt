### REFLECTIONS ON THE ASSASSINATION 
We are shocked because we are
ordinarily so successful in re
pressing awareness of our own
mortality, and of the frailty of
all human life that the truth
leaves us stunned in blasting its
way into our consciousness . . .
We are shocked because today's
world is a perilous place and the
death of a world leader cannot
but threaten the tenuous security
to which we cling. The cold
breath of death flickers the thin
candle flame by which we peer
hopefully into the future, and
we are afraid . . .
We are shocked because the
viciousness and inhumanity of
the act spotlights the dark side
of human nature, reminds us of
the animal that lurks in each
man, frightens us with memories
of moments when we have
hated . . .
But we are saddened, too. Some
one we knew and respected has
died; friend or foe, that is always
sad. And one of us, a fellow hu

man being, killed him, and so hu
manity suffers two blows in the
single event.
Whatever his age, or his politi
cal persuasions, the President is a
father to us all. We may oppose
him, criticize him, but he is still
a torch we hold up to the world,
a symbol of our aspirations to
govern ourselves with justice and
maturity, a man upon whose
strength and wisdom we rely.
And he was a human being,
warm, youthful, vigorous — a
husband, a father, a son, a
brother . . . He need not have
served us; he could have lived
happily for himself and his own.
But he tried to do his part—and
more—for a nation and a world
sorely in need of help.
Now he is dead, and we are all
touched by guilt. After all, we
chose him to be a target. But
more than that: he was killed by
meanness, hatred, bitterness . . .
and none of us has done enough
to banish these from human per
sonality, our own or our neigh
bor's, with love and compassion.

sad. And one of us, a fellow hu

man being, killed him, and so hu
manity suffers two blows in the
single event.
Whatever his age, or his politi
cal persuasions, the President is a
father to us all. We may oppose
him, criticize him, but he is still
a torch we hold up to the world,
a symbol of our aspirations to
govern ourselves with justice and
maturity, a man upon whose
strength and wisdom we rely.
And he was a human being,
warm, youthful, vigorous — a
husband, a father, a son, a
brother . . . He need not have
served us; he could have lived
happily for himself and his own.
But he tried to do his part—and
more—for a nation and a world
sorely in need of help.
Now he is dead, and we are all
touched by guilt. After all, we
chose him to be a target. But
more than that: he was killed by
meanness, hatred, bitterness . . .
and none of us has done enough
to banish these from human per
sonality, our own or our neigh
bor's, with love and compassion.
—JOHN 1). BLACK
We are shocked because we are
ordinarily so successful in re
pressing awareness of our own
mortality, and of the frailty of
all human life that the truth
leaves us stunned in blasting its
way into our consciousness . . .
We are shocked because today's
world is a perilous place and the
death of a world leader cannot
but threaten the tenuous security
to which we cling. The cold
breath of death flickers the thin
candle flame by which we peer
hopefully into the future, and
we are afraid . . .
We are shocked because the
viciousness and inhumanity of
the act spotlights the dark side
of human nature, reminds us of
the animal that lurks in each
man, frightens us with memories
of moments when we have
hated . . .
But we are saddened, too. Some
one we knew and respected has
died; friend or foe, that is always
sad. And one of us, a fellow hu

man being, killed him, and so hu
manity suffers two blows in the
single event.
