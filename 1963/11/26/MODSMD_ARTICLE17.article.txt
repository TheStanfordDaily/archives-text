# A 						Writer's Notebook

The assassination of the Presi
dent — every writer's field day.
The cynic can amuse himself
picking out the evidences of hu
man pettiness and stupid senti
mentality which stand in special
relief at a time when most of our
cruder impulses are subdued by
a sense of common disaster. The
existentialist can describe the na
tion in crisis, the nation instan
taneously thrown out of orbit,
robbed of stability, facing the
void. The pragmatic humanitar
ian worries about the future; the
sentimentalist feeds the cynic.
And the young writer-student,
not sure of which category she
belongs to and somewhat
knocked out of orbit herself, ob
serves, takes notes, tries to draw
conclusions.
There were rare intensity, fear,
speechlessness, and confusion to
be seen in various corners of the
Stanford campus Friday. People
avoided looking at each other in
the first hour. Later they stared
stonily at television screens in
the Union, gathered in nervous
knots for discussion, or wandered
off in distraction or contempla
tion, according to their disposi
tions. Late Friday night a couple
was sitting close together on a
curb near Engineering Corner,
and the girl was reaching up and
brushing a tear from her com
panion's face.
TIIE WRITER OBSERVER was
secretly glad that it happened to
be Big Game weekend when this
thunderbolt fell. Professor Spei
gelberg, who used to teach In
dian philosophy here, once said
in a book that, it is sometimes
necessary to fall sick and be
forced to lie still in bed in order
to recognize how dispensable are
most of the "necessities" of our
daily lives, how quickly our furi
ous rounds of activity can shrink
into insignificance. Big Game
week is a time when Stanford
prepares to make the loudest
noise of which it is capable, and
Friday's silence intensified the
horror.
Some students were surprised
and confused to see that both
university and community closed
up shop because of the assassina
tion. "Why were the bonfire and
game called off?" one girl kept
asking. She could only conclude
that the suspension of the ordi
nary routine of life was some ana
chronism left over from old
country protocol. "You might ex
pect this to happen where there
were kings and emperors. But
here in America. . . she trailed
off.
"But no one is indispensable,"
she pursued. "Life will go on, the
government will go on too."
Yes, life will go on, but for the
moment that is beside the point.

The point now is that it is not
likely to go on in exactly the
same way that it has been going.
The death of John Kennedy is
likely to have serious effects in
the nation and the world — and
in the lives of all of us who
planned to be cheering in the sta
dium Saturday afternoon.
THE DEATH OF John Ken
nedy has caused one young writer
at Stanford to ponder immediate
responsibilities, to consider
whether it may be necessary to
divert the attention for a t i m e
away from studying poetry, and
into action for certain practical
principles which are very impor
tant and very much in danger.
Studying and writing may still
appear to be the most difficult
and significant of all human en
deavors. But sometimes even a
writer must make the connection
between the private struggles
over intellectual and spiritual
problems, and the public strug
gles over the power to control
the destinies of nations. The af
fairs of the world are messy and
frustrating, complicated by many
men's visions and many men's
responsibilities. But it. is only in
the world that the values of the
intellect and spirit are made
manifest.
This nation had been steadily
sinking away from its greatness
when Kennedy took office. I
don't know if he could finally
have salvaged it, but he initiated
a Renaissance. His leadership in
international relations and civil
rights were informed by a com
bination of intelligence, political
astuteness, and moral enlighten
ment which are rare in men of
powerful position, and which were
needfid if we were even to hope
for a Renaissance in America.
As it was, material security and
the selfish complacency which it
always engenders were so deeply
ensconced in the American spirit
that the New Frontier aroused a
vehement conservative reaction
such as this country has not seen
for many years.
IT MIGHT HAVE been pos
sible that shock and sympathy at
Kennedy's murder would have
set a favorable stage for the ad
vancement of his policies. But the
fact that the probably killer was
a young Marxist is an evil omen.
If' the public is allowed to make
the communists scapegoats for
this disaster—if in our panic to
avoid facing ourselves we turn
the responsibility away from our
own consciences and our violently
immature political atmosphere—
then all the progress Kennedy
made toward international under
standing, domestic justice, and
the reduction of the threat of nu
lear war—all these wil be de
stroyed.
With them will be destroyed
America's chances for greatness.
