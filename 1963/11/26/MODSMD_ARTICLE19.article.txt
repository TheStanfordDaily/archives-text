# WALTER LIPPMANN
## Western European Politics Analyzed 
### 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter Lippmunn has just
returned from a lengthy fact-finding tour of
Europe. Below is the third in a series of three
columns he wrote on the basis of his tour.)
I talked about Eastern Europe in the two preced
ing articles. My main point was that the change of
generations coincides with the realization that ther
monuclear war has to be and probably will be
avoided and that this is weakening the discipline
which binds Eastern Europe together under the
authority of the Soviet Union.
In the West I visited Rome, Paris and London—
omitting Bonn, where it seemed to me too early
to get any clear view of what is to come after-
Adenauer.
THERE IS NO DOUBT, I soon realized, that in
Western Europe today President De Gaulle is the
pivoted figure. The initiative is in his hands.
There is little reason to think that the initiative
will pass to London or to Bonn. This is not be
cause General De Gaulle is universally loved, or
even admired. It is, so I venture to think, because
he has seen more of the future than most of his
contemporaries, and so much that happens seems
to bear him out.
Let us begin with domestic politics in the west
ern continent. Nobody whom I saw in Paris pre
tended to believe that General De Gaulle has set
up a government which could be made to work
without General De Gaulle.
France today is a free country in which repre
sentative democratic government has in fact been
suspended. Yet no one who has visited Eastern
Europe would think of France as a totalitarian
dictatorship. It is rather an enlightened monarchy,
and there is in France little of the fear which
would make the general's opponents, of whom
there are plenty, drop their voices and talk in a
kind of code language for fear of being overheard.
So far as I could make out, the general's chief
instrument to retain his power, apart from his
enormous personal prestige, is that he has seized
for himself a monopoly of radio and television.
His opponents, including the Communist Party,
are free to print and to talk. But they are cut off
from a mass audience by the government's mon
opoly of broadcasting.
THE GAULLIST VIEW is, I think, that repre
sentative government with its parties and its fac
tions is no longer workable. In the modern age it
is unable to provide good government with suffi
cient authority and independence. Representative
government with its parties did not work in post
war France. It has not worked in postwar Italy.
Probably it will not work in post-Adenauer Ger
many. What will come next the Gaullists do not
profess to know. But they insist that it must be
something which overrides parties and factions
and establishes a continuous national authority.
The central political tendency in Italy constitutes
J a tacit acceptance of the Gaullist finding. The
parliamentary system with the two-party govern
j ment, as it comes down to us from the 19th
I century is, say the Gaullists, now unworkable. It
led to Mussolini and to Hitler and might then have
led to Stalin.
The Italians are trying to work out what is in
reality a suspension of the two-party system. They
are trying to form a coalition of all the parties
and factions which believe in democracy, or more
accurately in personal freedom. This in the inward
ness of the so-called "opening to the left."
The Italian center-left coalition is intended to
comprise the Catholic Party insofar as it is pro
gressive and liberal and the Socialists insofar as
they are not Communists and totalitarian. I do
not know whether such an Italian coalition can be
formed successfully. But I have yet to talk to an
Italian who had any plausible idea of an acceptable
and workable alternative.
A POPULAR FRONT government would bo un
acceptable, and a center-right government would
be unworkable. If what is wanted is a strong gov
ernment which is also democratic, then there can
be no popular front with the Communists. Nor
can there be a front with the rightists, who in
clude what is left of fascism.
In the field of theory and doctrine, moreover,
the Italian attempt anticipates correctly, I venture
to think, the main tendency among the masses of
the people on the Western European continent.
The Democratic Socialists are abandoning their
Marxist ideology, particularly of the class strug
| gle, and the Christian Democrats are moving away
from their former close collaboration with the
feudal remnants and the plutocratic lobbies.
As the Socialist parties in Western Europe are
ceasing to be Marxist and as the religious parties
are becoming more Christian, there is a prospect
that such a coalition in Italy, and after the 1965
elections perhaps in Germany, will provide an
alternative to the kind of personal rule practiced
by General De Gaulle. But is will not be a revival
of representative democracy as it comes down
from the 19th century.
Turning now to international affairs, the main
fact is that General De Gaulle got the jump on
all his partners and allies because he was the first

to realize and act upon the fact that the postwar
era is ending. Early in the day, he saw that, be
cause nuclear war had ceased to be an instrument
of Soviet expansionary policy, it had become safe
to turn away from the postwar arrangements. In
the Gaullist view, this is not due to any change
of heart in Moscow, but to the decisive American
superiority in nuclear weapons. This estimate, they
say, was confirmed in the Cuban affair.
IF WE ARE to understand the real calculation
behind the general's insistence on creating a
French nuclear striking force, we must begin
with the Gaullist conviction that, because of Amer
ican power, the Soviet Union cannot launch a suc
cessful aggressive surprise attack.
No Frenchman pretends to believe that France
can afford to match Soviet or American nuclear
power. The candid Gaullists with whom I have
talked regard their small striking force as "inde
pendent" in a special and peculiar sense. Shock
ing though it may sound to Americans, they ex
pect this small force to give France the ability,
on its own initiative, to press the trigger that
would compel the United States to go into an
all-out war.
Strictly speaking, what France is seeking to
create is not an independent French nuclear force,
but an independent detonator of the American
nuclear force.
In these matters of the life and death of nations
and of civilization itself, we can allow no such
dangerous illusion to persist. However, I am not
sure how seriously the whole business is to be
taken. Thus, when I pressed the matter, pointing
out that the United States would not surrender
its independence to Paris and that we have many
ways of asserting our independence, a Gaullist
official with whom I was taking admitted quickly
enough that France had no intention of pressing
its trigger.
The French are just as much afraid of a nuclear
holocaust as are the rest of us. The purpose of
creating the trigger, he assured me, is not to pull
it—ever—but to negotiate with the United States
and the Soviet on the basis that France possesses
such a trigger and has a finger on it.
I DON'T THINK this is going to deceive any
body very much, and there is no need, I con
clude, to be too much excited in Washington over
the French nuclear deterrent, or over the British.
They are not military instruments. They are polit
ical instruments. Their main purpose is to give
weight to French and British diplomacy in all the
steps that will lead up to an eventual accommoda
tion. Though the accommodation is not yet in
sight, it is believed to be not too far below the
horizon.
In the meantime, the security which results
from the existing balance of nuclear power is so
great that General De Gaulle feels quite free to
dismantle the postwar structure. He does believe
in the alliance between Western Europe and the
United States—in the commitment to go to war
together if war breaks out—and he insists that
he proved it in the Cuban crisis. But he does not
believe in the NATO establishment which General
Eisenhower once commanded. He regards it as j
obsolete and as an undesirable prolongation of :
American hegemony in Western Europe.
He does not believe in the ideology of the Com- <
mon Market and in the political aspirations toward |
European union which accompanied its birth. And
so he may break up the Common Market if Chan
cellor Erhard does not sacrifice the German farm
bloc to the French farm bloc.
Ho does not believe in the United Nations as a
peace-keeping organization, and he has little re
spect for it as a debating forum, because it con
tains so many new and weak governments.
He does not believe in negotiating with the So
viet Union now, because he does not think any
thing will be lost if we do not negotiate.
MOREOVER, THERE is a profound difference
between his views of West Germany and the cur
rent American view. We tend to think of Germany
as purged and recovered and as the leading power
of Western Europe. The real Gaullist view, so
I have come to realize, is that West Germany,
after the criminal orgy of Nazism, after the shock
of defeat and with the open wounds of partition,
is a big, deeply-perturbed invalid who must be
nursed, guarded and tranquilized lest he relapse
into his old illusions.
That is why the general thinks that our attitude
toward West Germany is simple-minded and
dangerous.
General De Gaulle is not very kind about it all,
and he does nothing to make it easier to come to
an understanding—to agree, let us say, on the
idea that the postwar structure was the salvation
of Europe, but that it has served its purpose and
must be radically transformed before we shall
begin to see the permanent shape of European-
American relations.
But however lacerated our feelings, the evidence
is, I think, unmistakable that the Europeans have
turned a corner and that the postwar era is over.
Seen from Europe, our own efforts to revive the
Western alliance as it was in the 1950s tend to
sound like the old soldier fighting all over again
the battles of the wars he went to stop. And our
speeches often sound like those of the old actor
who is playing a return engagement in a role
which once made him famous.

The central political tendency in Italy constitutes
J a tacit acceptance of the Gaullist finding. The
parliamentary system with the two-party govern
j ment, as it comes down to us from the 19th
I century is, say the Gaullists, now unworkable. It
led to Mussolini and to Hitler and might then have
led to Stalin.
The Italians are trying to work out what is in
reality a suspension of the two-party system. They
are trying to form a coalition of all the parties
and factions which believe in democracy, or more
accurately in personal freedom. This in the inward
ness of the so-called "opening to the left."
The Italian center-left coalition is intended to
comprise the Catholic Party insofar as it is pro
gressive and liberal and the Socialists insofar as
they are not Communists and totalitarian. I do
not know whether such an Italian coalition can be
formed successfully. But I have yet to talk to an
Italian who had any plausible idea of an acceptable
and workable alternative.
A POPULAR FRONT government would bo un
acceptable, and a center-right government would
be unworkable. If what is wanted is a strong gov
ernment which is also democratic, then there can
be no popular front with the Communists. Nor
can there be a front with the rightists, who in
clude what is left of fascism.
In the field of theory and doctrine, moreover,
the Italian attempt anticipates correctly, I venture
to think, the main tendency among the masses of
the people on the Western European continent.
The Democratic Socialists are abandoning their
Marxist ideology, particularly of the class strug
| gle, and the Christian Democrats are moving away
from their former close collaboration with the
feudal remnants and the plutocratic lobbies.
As the Socialist parties in Western Europe are
ceasing to be Marxist and as the religious parties
are becoming more Christian, there is a prospect
that such a coalition in Italy, and after the 1965
elections perhaps in Germany, will provide an
alternative to the kind of personal rule practiced
by General De Gaulle. But is will not be a revival
of representative democracy as it comes down
from the 19th century.
Turning now to international affairs, the main
fact is that General De Gaulle got the jump on
all his partners and allies because he was the first

to realize and act upon the fact that the postwar
era is ending. Early in the day, he saw that, be
cause nuclear war had ceased to be an instrument
of Soviet expansionary policy, it had become safe
to turn away from the postwar arrangements. In
the Gaullist view, this is not due to any change
of heart in Moscow, but to the decisive American
superiority in nuclear weapons. This estimate, they
say, was confirmed in the Cuban affair.
IF WE ARE to understand the real calculation
behind the general's insistence on creating a
French nuclear striking force, we must begin
with the Gaullist conviction that, because of Amer
ican power, the Soviet Union cannot launch a suc
cessful aggressive surprise attack.
No Frenchman pretends to believe that France
can afford to match Soviet or American nuclear
power. The candid Gaullists with whom I have
talked regard their small striking force as "inde
pendent" in a special and peculiar sense. Shock
ing though it may sound to Americans, they ex
pect this small force to give France the ability,
on its own initiative, to press the trigger that
would compel the United States to go into an
all-out war.
Strictly speaking, what France is seeking to
create is not an independent French nuclear force,
but an independent detonator of the American
nuclear force.
In these matters of the life and death of nations
and of civilization itself, we can allow no such
dangerous illusion to persist. However, I am not
sure how seriously the whole business is to be
taken. Thus, when I pressed the matter, pointing
out that the United States would not surrender
its independence to Paris and that we have many
ways of asserting our independence, a Gaullist
official with whom I was taking admitted quickly
enough that France had no intention of pressing
its trigger.
The French are just as much afraid of a nuclear
holocaust as are the rest of us. The purpose of
creating the trigger, he assured me, is not to pull
it—ever—but to negotiate with the United States
and the Soviet on the basis that France possesses
such a trigger and has a finger on it.
I DON'T THINK this is going to deceive any
body very much, and there is no need, I con
clude, to be too much excited in Washington over
the French nuclear deterrent, or over the British.
They are not military instruments. They are polit
ical instruments. Their main purpose is to give
weight to French and British diplomacy in all the
steps that will lead up to an eventual accommoda
tion. Though the accommodation is not yet in
sight, it is believed to be not too far below the
horizon.
In the meantime, the security which results
from the existing balance of nuclear power is so
great that General De Gaulle feels quite free to
dismantle the postwar structure. He does believe
in the alliance between Western Europe and the
United States—in the commitment to go to war
together if war breaks out—and he insists that
he proved it in the Cuban crisis. But he does not
believe in the NATO establishment which General
Eisenhower once commanded. He regards it as j
obsolete and as an undesirable prolongation of :
American hegemony in Western Europe.
He does not believe in the ideology of the Com- <
mon Market and in the political aspirations toward |
European union which accompanied its birth. And
so he may break up the Common Market if Chan
cellor Erhard does not sacrifice the German farm
bloc to the French farm bloc.
Ho does not believe in the United Nations as a
peace-keeping organization, and he has little re
spect for it as a debating forum, because it con
tains so many new and weak governments.
He does not believe in negotiating with the So
viet Union now, because he does not think any
thing will be lost if we do not negotiate.
MOREOVER, THERE is a profound difference
between his views of West Germany and the cur
rent American view. We tend to think of Germany
as purged and recovered and as the leading power
of Western Europe. The real Gaullist view, so
I have come to realize, is that West Germany,
after the criminal orgy of Nazism, after the shock
of defeat and with the open wounds of partition,
is a big, deeply-perturbed invalid who must be
nursed, guarded and tranquilized lest he relapse
into his old illusions.
That is why the general thinks that our attitude
toward West Germany is simple-minded and
dangerous.
General De Gaulle is not very kind about it all,
and he does nothing to make it easier to come to
an understanding—to agree, let us say, on the
idea that the postwar structure was the salvation
of Europe, but that it has served its purpose and
must be radically transformed before we shall
begin to see the permanent shape of European-
American relations.
But however lacerated our feelings, the evidence
is, I think, unmistakable that the Europeans have
turned a corner and that the postwar era is over.
Seen from Europe, our own efforts to revive the
Western alliance as it was in the 1950s tend to
sound like the old soldier fighting all over again
the battles of the wars he went to stop. And our
speeches often sound like those of the old actor
who is playing a return engagement in a role
which once made him famous.
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter Lippmunn has just
returned from a lengthy fact-finding tour of
Europe. Below is the third in a series of three
columns he wrote on the basis of his tour.)
I talked about Eastern Europe in the two preced
ing articles. My main point was that the change of
generations coincides with the realization that ther
monuclear war has to be and probably will be
avoided and that this is weakening the discipline
which binds Eastern Europe together under the
authority of the Soviet Union.
In the West I visited Rome, Paris and London—
omitting Bonn, where it seemed to me too early
to get any clear view of what is to come after-
Adenauer.
THERE IS NO DOUBT, I soon realized, that in
Western Europe today President De Gaulle is the
pivoted figure. The initiative is in his hands.
There is little reason to think that the initiative
will pass to London or to Bonn. This is not be
cause General De Gaulle is universally loved, or
even admired. It is, so I venture to think, because
he has seen more of the future than most of his
contemporaries, and so much that happens seems
to bear him out.
Let us begin with domestic politics in the west
ern continent. Nobody whom I saw in Paris pre
tended to believe that General De Gaulle has set
up a government which could be made to work
without General De Gaulle.
France today is a free country in which repre
sentative democratic government has in fact been
suspended. Yet no one who has visited Eastern
Europe would think of France as a totalitarian
dictatorship. It is rather an enlightened monarchy,
and there is in France little of the fear which
would make the general's opponents, of whom
there are plenty, drop their voices and talk in a
kind of code language for fear of being overheard.
So far as I could make out, the general's chief
instrument to retain his power, apart from his
enormous personal prestige, is that he has seized
for himself a monopoly of radio and television.
His opponents, including the Communist Party,
are free to print and to talk. But they are cut off
from a mass audience by the government's mon
opoly of broadcasting.
THE GAULLIST VIEW is, I think, that repre
sentative government with its parties and its fac
tions is no longer workable. In the modern age it
is unable to provide good government with suffi
cient authority and independence. Representative
government with its parties did not work in post
war France. It has not worked in postwar Italy.
Probably it will not work in post-Adenauer Ger
many. What will come next the Gaullists do not
profess to know. But they insist that it must be
something which overrides parties and factions
and establishes a continuous national authority.
The central political tendency in Italy constitutes
J a tacit acceptance of the Gaullist finding. The
parliamentary system with the two-party govern
j ment, as it comes down to us from the 19th

behind the general's insistence on creating a
French nuclear striking force, we must begin
with the Gaullist conviction that, because of Amer
ican power, the Soviet Union cannot launch a suc
cessful aggressive surprise attack.
No Frenchman pretends to believe that France
can afford to match Soviet or American nuclear
power. The candid Gaullists with whom I have
talked regard their small striking force as "inde
pendent" in a special and peculiar sense. Shock
ing though it may sound to Americans, they ex
pect this small force to give France the ability,
on its own initiative, to press the trigger that
would compel the United States to go into an
all-out war.
Strictly speaking, what France is seeking to
create is not an independent French nuclear force,
but an independent detonator of the American
nuclear force.
In these matters of the life and death of nations
and of civilization itself, we can allow no such
dangerous illusion to persist. However, I am not
sure how seriously the whole business is to be
taken. Thus, when I pressed the matter, pointing
out that the United States would not surrender
its independence to Paris and that we have many
ways of asserting our independence, a Gaullist
official with whom I was taking admitted quickly
enough that France had no intention of pressing
its trigger.
The French are just as much afraid of a nuclear
holocaust as are the rest of us. The purpose of
creating the trigger, he assured me, is not to pull
it—ever—but to negotiate with the United States
and the Soviet on the basis that France possesses
such a trigger and has a finger on it.
I DON'T THINK this is going to deceive any
body very much, and there is no need, I con
clude, to be too much excited in Washington over
the French nuclear deterrent, or over the British.
They are not military instruments. They are polit
ical instruments. Their main purpose is to give
weight to French and British diplomacy in all the
steps that will lead up to an eventual accommoda
tion. Though the accommodation is not yet in
sight, it is believed to be not too far below the
horizon.
In the meantime, the security which results
from the existing balance of nuclear power is so
great that General De Gaulle feels quite free to
dismantle the postwar structure. He does believe
in the alliance between Western Europe and the
United States—in the commitment to go to war
together if war breaks out—and he insists that
he proved it in the Cuban crisis. But he does not
believe in the NATO establishment which General
Eisenhower once commanded. He regards it as j
obsolete and as an undesirable prolongation of :
American hegemony in Western Europe.
He does not believe in the ideology of the Com- <
mon Market and in the political aspirations toward |
European union which accompanied its birth. And
so he may break up the Common Market if Chan
cellor Erhard does not sacrifice the German farm
bloc to the French farm bloc.
Ho does not believe in the United Nations as a
peace-keeping organization, and he has little re
spect for it as a debating forum, because it con
tains so many new and weak governments.
He does not believe in negotiating with the So
viet Union now, because he does not think any
thing will be lost if we do not negotiate.
MOREOVER, THERE is a profound difference
between his views of West Germany and the cur
rent American view. We tend to think of Germany
as purged and recovered and as the leading power
of Western Europe. The real Gaullist view, so
I have come to realize, is that West Germany,
after the criminal orgy of Nazism, after the shock
of defeat and with the open wounds of partition,
is a big, deeply-perturbed invalid who must be
nursed, guarded and tranquilized lest he relapse
into his old illusions.
That is why the general thinks that our attitude
toward West Germany is simple-minded and
dangerous.
General De Gaulle is not very kind about it all,
and he does nothing to make it easier to come to
an understanding—to agree, let us say, on the
idea that the postwar structure was the salvation
of Europe, but that it has served its purpose and
must be radically transformed before we shall
begin to see the permanent shape of European-
American relations.
But however lacerated our feelings, the evidence
is, I think, unmistakable that the Europeans have
turned a corner and that the postwar era is over.
Seen from Europe, our own efforts to revive the
Western alliance as it was in the 1950s tend to
sound like the old soldier fighting all over again
the battles of the wars he went to stop. And our
speeches often sound like those of the old actor
who is playing a return engagement in a role
which once made him famous.
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter Lippmunn has just
returned from a lengthy fact-finding tour of
Europe. Below is the third in a series of three
columns he wrote on the basis of his tour.)
I talked about Eastern Europe in the two preced
ing articles. My main point was that the change of
generations coincides with the realization that ther
monuclear war has to be and probably will be
avoided and that this is weakening the discipline
which binds Eastern Europe together under the
authority of the Soviet Union.
In the West I visited Rome, Paris and London—
omitting Bonn, where it seemed to me too early
to get any clear view of what is to come after-
Adenauer.
THERE IS NO DOUBT, I soon realized, that in
Western Europe today President De Gaulle is the
pivoted figure. The initiative is in his hands.
There is little reason to think that the initiative
will pass to London or to Bonn. This is not be
cause General De Gaulle is universally loved, or
even admired. It is, so I venture to think, because
he has seen more of the future than most of his
contemporaries, and so much that happens seems
to bear him out.
Let us begin with domestic politics in the west
ern continent. Nobody whom I saw in Paris pre
tended to believe that General De Gaulle has set
up a government which could be made to work
without General De Gaulle.
France today is a free country in which repre
sentative democratic government has in fact been
suspended. Yet no one who has visited Eastern
Europe would think of France as a totalitarian
dictatorship. It is rather an enlightened monarchy,
and there is in France little of the fear which
would make the general's opponents, of whom
there are plenty, drop their voices and talk in a
kind of code language for fear of being overheard.
So far as I could make out, the general's chief
instrument to retain his power, apart from his
enormous personal prestige, is that he has seized
for himself a monopoly of radio and television.
His opponents, including the Communist Party,
are free to print and to talk. But they are cut off
from a mass audience by the government's mon
opoly of broadcasting.
THE GAULLIST VIEW is, I think, that repre
sentative government with its parties and its fac
tions is no longer workable. In the modern age it
is unable to provide good government with suffi
cient authority and independence. Representative
government with its parties did not work in post
war France. It has not worked in postwar Italy.
Probably it will not work in post-Adenauer Ger
many. What will come next the Gaullists do not
profess to know. But they insist that it must be
something which overrides parties and factions
and establishes a continuous national authority.
The central political tendency in Italy constitutes
J a tacit acceptance of the Gaullist finding. The
parliamentary system with the two-party govern
j ment, as it comes down to us from the 19th
I century is, say the Gaullists, now unworkable. It
led to Mussolini and to Hitler and might then have
led to Stalin.
The Italians are trying to work out what is in
reality a suspension of the two-party system. They
are trying to form a coalition of all the parties
and factions which believe in democracy, or more
accurately in personal freedom. This in the inward
ness of the so-called "opening to the left."
The Italian center-left coalition is intended to
comprise the Catholic Party insofar as it is pro
gressive and liberal and the Socialists insofar as
they are not Communists and totalitarian. I do
not know whether such an Italian coalition can be
formed successfully. But I have yet to talk to an
Italian who had any plausible idea of an acceptable
and workable alternative.
A POPULAR FRONT government would bo un
acceptable, and a center-right government would
be unworkable. If what is wanted is a strong gov
ernment which is also democratic, then there can
be no popular front with the Communists. Nor
can there be a front with the rightists, who in
clude what is left of fascism.
In the field of theory and doctrine, moreover,
the Italian attempt anticipates correctly, I venture
to think, the main tendency among the masses of
the people on the Western European continent.
The Democratic Socialists are abandoning their
Marxist ideology, particularly of the class strug
| gle, and the Christian Democrats are moving away
from their former close collaboration with the
feudal remnants and the plutocratic lobbies.
As the Socialist parties in Western Europe are
ceasing to be Marxist and as the religious parties
are becoming more Christian, there is a prospect
that such a coalition in Italy, and after the 1965
elections perhaps in Germany, will provide an
alternative to the kind of personal rule practiced
by General De Gaulle. But is will not be a revival
of representative democracy as it comes down
from the 19th century.
Turning now to international affairs, the main
fact is that General De Gaulle got the jump on
all his partners and allies because he was the first

to realize and act upon the fact that the postwar
era is ending. Early in the day, he saw that, be
cause nuclear war had ceased to be an instrument
of Soviet expansionary policy, it had become safe
to turn away from the postwar arrangements. In
the Gaullist view, this is not due to any change
of heart in Moscow, but to the decisive American
superiority in nuclear weapons. This estimate, they
say, was confirmed in the Cuban affair.
IF WE ARE to understand the real calculation
behind the general's insistence on creating a
French nuclear striking force, we must begin
with the Gaullist conviction that, because of Amer
ican power, the Soviet Union cannot launch a suc

European union which accompanied its birth. And
so he may break up the Common Market if Chan
cellor Erhard does not sacrifice the German farm
bloc to the French farm bloc.
Ho does not believe in the United Nations as a
peace-keeping organization, and he has little re
spect for it as a debating forum, because it con
tains so many new and weak governments.
He does not believe in negotiating with the So
viet Union now, because he does not think any
thing will be lost if we do not negotiate.
MOREOVER, THERE is a profound difference
between his views of West Germany and the cur
rent American view. We tend to think of Germany
as purged and recovered and as the leading power
of Western Europe. The real Gaullist view, so
I have come to realize, is that West Germany,
after the criminal orgy of Nazism, after the shock
of defeat and with the open wounds of partition,
is a big, deeply-perturbed invalid who must be
nursed, guarded and tranquilized lest he relapse
into his old illusions.
That is why the general thinks that our attitude
toward West Germany is simple-minded and
dangerous.
General De Gaulle is not very kind about it all,
and he does nothing to make it easier to come to
an understanding—to agree, let us say, on the
idea that the postwar structure was the salvation
of Europe, but that it has served its purpose and
must be radically transformed before we shall
begin to see the permanent shape of European-
American relations.
But however lacerated our feelings, the evidence
is, I think, unmistakable that the Europeans have
turned a corner and that the postwar era is over.
Seen from Europe, our own efforts to revive the
Western alliance as it was in the 1950s tend to
sound like the old soldier fighting all over again
the battles of the wars he went to stop. And our
speeches often sound like those of the old actor
who is playing a return engagement in a role
which once made him famous.
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter Lippmunn has just
returned from a lengthy fact-finding tour of
Europe. Below is the third in a series of three
columns he wrote on the basis of his tour.)
I talked about Eastern Europe in the two preced
ing articles. My main point was that the change of
generations coincides with the realization that ther
monuclear war has to be and probably will be
avoided and that this is weakening the discipline
which binds Eastern Europe together under the
authority of the Soviet Union.
In the West I visited Rome, Paris and London—
omitting Bonn, where it seemed to me too early
to get any clear view of what is to come after-
Adenauer.
THERE IS NO DOUBT, I soon realized, that in
Western Europe today President De Gaulle is the
pivoted figure. The initiative is in his hands.
There is little reason to think that the initiative
will pass to London or to Bonn. This is not be
cause General De Gaulle is universally loved, or
even admired. It is, so I venture to think, because
he has seen more of the future than most of his
contemporaries, and so much that happens seems
to bear him out.
Let us begin with domestic politics in the west
ern continent. Nobody whom I saw in Paris pre
tended to believe that General De Gaulle has set
up a government which could be made to work
without General De Gaulle.
France today is a free country in which repre
sentative democratic government has in fact been
suspended. Yet no one who has visited Eastern
Europe would think of France as a totalitarian
dictatorship. It is rather an enlightened monarchy,
and there is in France little of the fear which
would make the general's opponents, of whom
there are plenty, drop their voices and talk in a
kind of code language for fear of being overheard.
So far as I could make out, the general's chief
instrument to retain his power, apart from his
enormous personal prestige, is that he has seized
for himself a monopoly of radio and television.
His opponents, including the Communist Party,
are free to print and to talk. But they are cut off
from a mass audience by the government's mon
opoly of broadcasting.
THE GAULLIST VIEW is, I think, that repre
sentative government with its parties and its fac
tions is no longer workable. In the modern age it
is unable to provide good government with suffi
cient authority and independence. Representative
government with its parties did not work in post
war France. It has not worked in postwar Italy.
Probably it will not work in post-Adenauer Ger
many. What will come next the Gaullists do not
profess to know. But they insist that it must be
something which overrides parties and factions
and establishes a continuous national authority.
The central political tendency in Italy constitutes
J a tacit acceptance of the Gaullist finding. The
parliamentary system with the two-party govern
j ment, as it comes down to us from the 19th
I century is, say the Gaullists, now unworkable. It
led to Mussolini and to Hitler and might then have
led to Stalin.
The Italians are trying to work out what is in
reality a suspension of the two-party system. They
are trying to form a coalition of all the parties
and factions which believe in democracy, or more
accurately in personal freedom. This in the inward
ness of the so-called "opening to the left."
The Italian center-left coalition is intended to
comprise the Catholic Party insofar as it is pro
gressive and liberal and the Socialists insofar as
they are not Communists and totalitarian. I do
not know whether such an Italian coalition can be
formed successfully. But I have yet to talk to an
Italian who had any plausible idea of an acceptable
and workable alternative.
A POPULAR FRONT government would bo un
acceptable, and a center-right government would
be unworkable. If what is wanted is a strong gov
ernment which is also democratic, then there can
be no popular front with the Communists. Nor
can there be a front with the rightists, who in
clude what is left of fascism.
In the field of theory and doctrine, moreover,
the Italian attempt anticipates correctly, I venture
to think, the main tendency among the masses of
the people on the Western European continent.
The Democratic Socialists are abandoning their
Marxist ideology, particularly of the class strug
| gle, and the Christian Democrats are moving away
from their former close collaboration with the
feudal remnants and the plutocratic lobbies.
As the Socialist parties in Western Europe are
ceasing to be Marxist and as the religious parties
are becoming more Christian, there is a prospect
that such a coalition in Italy, and after the 1965
elections perhaps in Germany, will provide an
alternative to the kind of personal rule practiced
by General De Gaulle. But is will not be a revival
of representative democracy as it comes down
from the 19th century.
Turning now to international affairs, the main
fact is that General De Gaulle got the jump on
all his partners and allies because he was the first

to realize and act upon the fact that the postwar
era is ending. Early in the day, he saw that, be
cause nuclear war had ceased to be an instrument
of Soviet expansionary policy, it had become safe
to turn away from the postwar arrangements. In
the Gaullist view, this is not due to any change
of heart in Moscow, but to the decisive American
superiority in nuclear weapons. This estimate, they
say, was confirmed in the Cuban affair.
IF WE ARE to understand the real calculation
behind the general's insistence on creating a
French nuclear striking force, we must begin
with the Gaullist conviction that, because of Amer
ican power, the Soviet Union cannot launch a suc
cessful aggressive surprise attack.
No Frenchman pretends to believe that France
can afford to match Soviet or American nuclear
power. The candid Gaullists with whom I have
talked regard their small striking force as "inde
pendent" in a special and peculiar sense. Shock
ing though it may sound to Americans, they ex
pect this small force to give France the ability,
on its own initiative, to press the trigger that
would compel the United States to go into an
all-out war.
Strictly speaking, what France is seeking to
create is not an independent French nuclear force,
but an independent detonator of the American
nuclear force.
In these matters of the life and death of nations
and of civilization itself, we can allow no such
dangerous illusion to persist. However, I am not
sure how seriously the whole business is to be
taken. Thus, when I pressed the matter, pointing
out that the United States would not surrender
its independence to Paris and that we have many
ways of asserting our independence, a Gaullist
official with whom I was taking admitted quickly
enough that France had no intention of pressing
its trigger.
The French are just as much afraid of a nuclear
holocaust as are the rest of us. The purpose of
creating the trigger, he assured me, is not to pull
it—ever—but to negotiate with the United States
and the Soviet on the basis that France possesses
such a trigger and has a finger on it.
I DON'T THINK this is going to deceive any
body very much, and there is no need, I con
clude, to be too much excited in Washington over
the French nuclear deterrent, or over the British.
They are not military instruments. They are polit
ical instruments. Their main purpose is to give
weight to French and British diplomacy in all the
steps that will lead up to an eventual accommoda
tion. Though the accommodation is not yet in
sight, it is believed to be not too far below the
horizon.
In the meantime, the security which results
from the existing balance of nuclear power is so
great that General De Gaulle feels quite free to
dismantle the postwar structure. He does believe
in the alliance between Western Europe and the
United States—in the commitment to go to war
together if war breaks out—and he insists that
he proved it in the Cuban crisis. But he does not
believe in the NATO establishment which General
Eisenhower once commanded. He regards it as j
obsolete and as an undesirable prolongation of :
American hegemony in Western Europe.
He does not believe in the ideology of the Com- <
mon Market and in the political aspirations toward |
European union which accompanied its birth. And
so he may break up the Common Market if Chan
cellor Erhard does not sacrifice the German farm
bloc to the French farm bloc.
Ho does not believe in the United Nations as a
peace-keeping organization, and he has little re

Western Europe today President De Gaulle is the
pivoted figure. The initiative is in his hands.
There is little reason to think that the initiative
will pass to London or to Bonn. This is not be
cause General De Gaulle is universally loved, or
even admired. It is, so I venture to think, because
he has seen more of the future than most of his
contemporaries, and so much that happens seems
to bear him out.
Let us begin with domestic politics in the west
ern continent. Nobody whom I saw in Paris pre
tended to believe that General De Gaulle has set
up a government which could be made to work
without General De Gaulle.
France today is a free country in which repre
sentative democratic government has in fact been
suspended. Yet no one who has visited Eastern
Europe would think of France as a totalitarian
dictatorship. It is rather an enlightened monarchy,
and there is in France little of the fear which
would make the general's opponents, of whom
there are plenty, drop their voices and talk in a
kind of code language for fear of being overheard.
So far as I could make out, the general's chief
instrument to retain his power, apart from his
enormous personal prestige, is that he has seized
for himself a monopoly of radio and television.
His opponents, including the Communist Party,
are free to print and to talk. But they are cut off
from a mass audience by the government's mon
opoly of broadcasting.
THE GAULLIST VIEW is, I think, that repre
sentative government with its parties and its fac
tions is no longer workable. In the modern age it
is unable to provide good government with suffi
cient authority and independence. Representative
government with its parties did not work in post
war France. It has not worked in postwar Italy.
Probably it will not work in post-Adenauer Ger
many. What will come next the Gaullists do not
profess to know. But they insist that it must be
something which overrides parties and factions
and establishes a continuous national authority.
The central political tendency in Italy constitutes
J a tacit acceptance of the Gaullist finding. The
parliamentary system with the two-party govern
j ment, as it comes down to us from the 19th
I century is, say the Gaullists, now unworkable. It
led to Mussolini and to Hitler and might then have
led to Stalin.
The Italians are trying to work out what is in
reality a suspension of the two-party system. They
are trying to form a coalition of all the parties
and factions which believe in democracy, or more
accurately in personal freedom. This in the inward
ness of the so-called "opening to the left."
The Italian center-left coalition is intended to
comprise the Catholic Party insofar as it is pro
gressive and liberal and the Socialists insofar as
they are not Communists and totalitarian. I do
not know whether such an Italian coalition can be
formed successfully. But I have yet to talk to an
Italian who had any plausible idea of an acceptable
and workable alternative.
A POPULAR FRONT government would bo un
acceptable, and a center-right government would
be unworkable. If what is wanted is a strong gov
ernment which is also democratic, then there can
be no popular front with the Communists. Nor
can there be a front with the rightists, who in
clude what is left of fascism.
In the field of theory and doctrine, moreover,
the Italian attempt anticipates correctly, I venture
to think, the main tendency among the masses of
the people on the Western European continent.
The Democratic Socialists are abandoning their
Marxist ideology, particularly of the class strug
| gle, and the Christian Democrats are moving away
from their former close collaboration with the
feudal remnants and the plutocratic lobbies.
As the Socialist parties in Western Europe are
ceasing to be Marxist and as the religious parties
are becoming more Christian, there is a prospect
that such a coalition in Italy, and after the 1965
elections perhaps in Germany, will provide an
alternative to the kind of personal rule practiced
by General De Gaulle. But is will not be a revival
of representative democracy as it comes down
from the 19th century.
Turning now to international affairs, the main
fact is that General De Gaulle got the jump on
all his partners and allies because he was the first

to realize and act upon the fact that the postwar
era is ending. Early in the day, he saw that, be
cause nuclear war had ceased to be an instrument
of Soviet expansionary policy, it had become safe
to turn away from the postwar arrangements. In
the Gaullist view, this is not due to any change
of heart in Moscow, but to the decisive American
superiority in nuclear weapons. This estimate, they
say, was confirmed in the Cuban affair.
IF WE ARE to understand the real calculation
behind the general's insistence on creating a
French nuclear striking force, we must begin
with the Gaullist conviction that, because of Amer
ican power, the Soviet Union cannot launch a suc
cessful aggressive surprise attack.
No Frenchman pretends to believe that France
can afford to match Soviet or American nuclear
power. The candid Gaullists with whom I have
talked regard their small striking force as "inde
pendent" in a special and peculiar sense. Shock
ing though it may sound to Americans, they ex
pect this small force to give France the ability,
on its own initiative, to press the trigger that
would compel the United States to go into an
all-out war.
Strictly speaking, what France is seeking to
create is not an independent French nuclear force,
but an independent detonator of the American
nuclear force.
In these matters of the life and death of nations
and of civilization itself, we can allow no such
dangerous illusion to persist. However, I am not
sure how seriously the whole business is to be
taken. Thus, when I pressed the matter, pointing
out that the United States would not surrender
its independence to Paris and that we have many
ways of asserting our independence, a Gaullist
official with whom I was taking admitted quickly
enough that France had no intention of pressing
its trigger.
The French are just as much afraid of a nuclear
holocaust as are the rest of us. The purpose of
creating the trigger, he assured me, is not to pull
it—ever—but to negotiate with the United States
and the Soviet on the basis that France possesses
such a trigger and has a finger on it.
I DON'T THINK this is going to deceive any
body very much, and there is no need, I con
clude, to be too much excited in Washington over
the French nuclear deterrent, or over the British.
They are not military instruments. They are polit
ical instruments. Their main purpose is to give
weight to French and British diplomacy in all the
steps that will lead up to an eventual accommoda
tion. Though the accommodation is not yet in
sight, it is believed to be not too far below the
horizon.
In the meantime, the security which results
from the existing balance of nuclear power is so
great that General De Gaulle feels quite free to
dismantle the postwar structure. He does believe
in the alliance between Western Europe and the
United States—in the commitment to go to war
together if war breaks out—and he insists that
he proved it in the Cuban crisis. But he does not
believe in the NATO establishment which General
Eisenhower once commanded. He regards it as j
obsolete and as an undesirable prolongation of :
American hegemony in Western Europe.
He does not believe in the ideology of the Com- <
mon Market and in the political aspirations toward |
European union which accompanied its birth. And
so he may break up the Common Market if Chan
cellor Erhard does not sacrifice the German farm
bloc to the French farm bloc.
Ho does not believe in the United Nations as a
peace-keeping organization, and he has little re
spect for it as a debating forum, because it con
tains so many new and weak governments.
He does not believe in negotiating with the So
viet Union now, because he does not think any
thing will be lost if we do not negotiate.
MOREOVER, THERE is a profound difference
between his views of West Germany and the cur
rent American view. We tend to think of Germany
as purged and recovered and as the leading power
of Western Europe. The real Gaullist view, so
I have come to realize, is that West Germany,
after the criminal orgy of Nazism, after the shock
of defeat and with the open wounds of partition,
is a big, deeply-perturbed invalid who must be
nursed, guarded and tranquilized lest he relapse
into his old illusions.
That is why the general thinks that our attitude
toward West Germany is simple-minded and
dangerous.
General De Gaulle is not very kind about it all,
and he does nothing to make it easier to come to
an understanding—to agree, let us say, on the
idea that the postwar structure was the salvation
of Europe, but that it has served its purpose and
must be radically transformed before we shall
begin to see the permanent shape of European-
American relations.
But however lacerated our feelings, the evidence
is, I think, unmistakable that the Europeans have
turned a corner and that the postwar era is over.
Seen from Europe, our own efforts to revive the
Western alliance as it was in the 1950s tend to
sound like the old soldier fighting all over again
the battles of the wars he went to stop. And our
speeches often sound like those of the old actor
who is playing a return engagement in a role
which once made him famous.
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter Lippmunn has just
returned from a lengthy fact-finding tour of
Europe. Below is the third in a series of three
columns he wrote on the basis of his tour.)
I talked about Eastern Europe in the two preced
ing articles. My main point was that the change of
generations coincides with the realization that ther
monuclear war has to be and probably will be
avoided and that this is weakening the discipline
which binds Eastern Europe together under the
authority of the Soviet Union.
In the West I visited Rome, Paris and London—
omitting Bonn, where it seemed to me too early
to get any clear view of what is to come after-
Adenauer.

gressive and liberal and the Socialists insofar as
they are not Communists and totalitarian. I do
not know whether such an Italian coalition can be
formed successfully. But I have yet to talk to an
Italian who had any plausible idea of an acceptable
and workable alternative.
A POPULAR FRONT government would bo un
acceptable, and a center-right government would
be unworkable. If what is wanted is a strong gov
ernment which is also democratic, then there can
be no popular front with the Communists. Nor
can there be a front with the rightists, who in
clude what is left of fascism.
In the field of theory and doctrine, moreover,
the Italian attempt anticipates correctly, I venture
to think, the main tendency among the masses of
the people on the Western European continent.
The Democratic Socialists are abandoning their
Marxist ideology, particularly of the class strug
| gle, and the Christian Democrats are moving away
from their former close collaboration with the
feudal remnants and the plutocratic lobbies.
As the Socialist parties in Western Europe are
ceasing to be Marxist and as the religious parties
are becoming more Christian, there is a prospect
that such a coalition in Italy, and after the 1965
elections perhaps in Germany, will provide an
alternative to the kind of personal rule practiced
by General De Gaulle. But is will not be a revival
of representative democracy as it comes down
from the 19th century.
Turning now to international affairs, the main
fact is that General De Gaulle got the jump on
all his partners and allies because he was the first

to realize and act upon the fact that the postwar
era is ending. Early in the day, he saw that, be
cause nuclear war had ceased to be an instrument
of Soviet expansionary policy, it had become safe
to turn away from the postwar arrangements. In
the Gaullist view, this is not due to any change
of heart in Moscow, but to the decisive American
superiority in nuclear weapons. This estimate, they
say, was confirmed in the Cuban affair.
IF WE ARE to understand the real calculation
behind the general's insistence on creating a
French nuclear striking force, we must begin
with the Gaullist conviction that, because of Amer
ican power, the Soviet Union cannot launch a suc
cessful aggressive surprise attack.
No Frenchman pretends to believe that France
can afford to match Soviet or American nuclear
power. The candid Gaullists with whom I have
talked regard their small striking force as "inde
pendent" in a special and peculiar sense. Shock
ing though it may sound to Americans, they ex
pect this small force to give France the ability,
on its own initiative, to press the trigger that
would compel the United States to go into an
all-out war.
Strictly speaking, what France is seeking to
create is not an independent French nuclear force,
but an independent detonator of the American
nuclear force.
In these matters of the life and death of nations
and of civilization itself, we can allow no such
dangerous illusion to persist. However, I am not
sure how seriously the whole business is to be
taken. Thus, when I pressed the matter, pointing
out that the United States would not surrender
its independence to Paris and that we have many
ways of asserting our independence, a Gaullist
official with whom I was taking admitted quickly
enough that France had no intention of pressing
its trigger.
The French are just as much afraid of a nuclear
holocaust as are the rest of us. The purpose of
creating the trigger, he assured me, is not to pull
it—ever—but to negotiate with the United States
and the Soviet on the basis that France possesses
such a trigger and has a finger on it.
I DON'T THINK this is going to deceive any
body very much, and there is no need, I con
clude, to be too much excited in Washington over
the French nuclear deterrent, or over the British.
They are not military instruments. They are polit
ical instruments. Their main purpose is to give
weight to French and British diplomacy in all the
steps that will lead up to an eventual accommoda
tion. Though the accommodation is not yet in
sight, it is believed to be not too far below the
horizon.
In the meantime, the security which results
from the existing balance of nuclear power is so
great that General De Gaulle feels quite free to
dismantle the postwar structure. He does believe
in the alliance between Western Europe and the
United States—in the commitment to go to war
together if war breaks out—and he insists that
he proved it in the Cuban crisis. But he does not
believe in the NATO establishment which General
Eisenhower once commanded. He regards it as j
obsolete and as an undesirable prolongation of :
American hegemony in Western Europe.
He does not believe in the ideology of the Com- <
mon Market and in the political aspirations toward |
European union which accompanied its birth. And
so he may break up the Common Market if Chan
cellor Erhard does not sacrifice the German farm
bloc to the French farm bloc.
Ho does not believe in the United Nations as a
peace-keeping organization, and he has little re
spect for it as a debating forum, because it con
tains so many new and weak governments.
He does not believe in negotiating with the So
viet Union now, because he does not think any
thing will be lost if we do not negotiate.
MOREOVER, THERE is a profound difference
between his views of West Germany and the cur
rent American view. We tend to think of Germany
as purged and recovered and as the leading power
of Western Europe. The real Gaullist view, so
I have come to realize, is that West Germany,
after the criminal orgy of Nazism, after the shock
of defeat and with the open wounds of partition,
is a big, deeply-perturbed invalid who must be
nursed, guarded and tranquilized lest he relapse
into his old illusions.
That is why the general thinks that our attitude
toward West Germany is simple-minded and
dangerous.
General De Gaulle is not very kind about it all,
and he does nothing to make it easier to come to
an understanding—to agree, let us say, on the
idea that the postwar structure was the salvation
of Europe, but that it has served its purpose and
must be radically transformed before we shall
begin to see the permanent shape of European-
American relations.
But however lacerated our feelings, the evidence
is, I think, unmistakable that the Europeans have
turned a corner and that the postwar era is over.
Seen from Europe, our own efforts to revive the
Western alliance as it was in the 1950s tend to
sound like the old soldier fighting all over again
the battles of the wars he went to stop. And our
speeches often sound like those of the old actor
who is playing a return engagement in a role
which once made him famous.
