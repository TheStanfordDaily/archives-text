## 'TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY 
### Author of "Rally Round the Flag. Boys Barefoot Boy With Cheek 
If you have been reading this column—and I hope you have; I
mean I genuinely hope so; I mean it does not profit me one
penny whether you read this column or not; I mean I am paid
every week by the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes and my
emolument is not affected in any way by the number of people
who read or fail to read this column—an act of generosity
perfectly characteristic of the makers of Marlboro, you would
say if you knew them as 1 do; I mean here arc tobacconists gray
at the temples and full of honors who approach their art as
eagerly, as dewy-eyed as the youngest of practitioners; I mean
the purpose of the Marlboro makers is simply to put the best of
all possible filters behind the best of all possible tobaccos and
then go, heads high, into the market place with their wares,
confident that the inborn sense of right and wrong, of good and
bad, of worthy and unworthy, which is the natural instinct of
every American, will result in a modest return to themselves
for their long hours and dedicated labors—not, let me hasten to
add, that money is of first importance to the makers of Marlboro;
all these simple men require is plain, wholesome food, plenty of
Marlboros, and the knowledge that they have scattered a bit of
sunshine into the lives of smokers everywhere; if, I say, you
have been reading this column, you may remember that last
week we started to discuss Christmas gifts.

We agreed, of course, to give cartons of Marlboro to all our
friends and also to as many total strangers as possible. Today
let us look into some other welcome gifts.
Do you know someone who is interested in American history?
If so, he will surely appreciate a statuette of Millard Fillmore
with a clock in the stomach. (Mr. Fillmore, incidentally, was
the only American president with a clock in the stomach.
James K. Polk had a stem-winder in his head, and William
Henry Harrison chimed the quarter-hour, but only Mr. Fillmore,
of all our chief executives, had a clock in the stomach. Franklin
Pierce had a sweep second hand and Zachary Taylor had
seventeen jewels, but, I repeat, Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Fillmore
alone had a clock in the stomach. Some say that Mr. Fillmore
was also the first president with power steering, but most
historians assign this distinction to Chester A. Arthur. How
ever, it has been established beyond doubt that Mr. Fillmore
was the first president with a thermostat. Small wonder they
called him Old Hickory 1)
But I digress. To get back to welcome and unusual Christmas
gifts, here's one that's sure to please—a gift certificate from the
American Chiropractic Society. Accompanying each certificate
is this winsome little poem:
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year,
Joyous sacro-iliac!
May your spine fonver shine,
Blessings on your aching bach.
May your lumbar ne'er grow number,
May your backbone ne'er dislodge,
May your caudal never dawdle,
Joycux Noel! Heureux massage!

If you have been reading this column—and I hope you have; I
mean I genuinely hope so; I mean it does not profit me one
penny whether you read this column or not; I mean I am paid
every week by the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes and my
emolument is not affected in any way by the number of people
who read or fail to read this column—an act of generosity
perfectly characteristic of the makers of Marlboro, you would
say if you knew them as 1 do; I mean here arc tobacconists gray
at the temples and full of honors who approach their art as
eagerly, as dewy-eyed as the youngest of practitioners; I mean
the purpose of the Marlboro makers is simply to put the best of
all possible filters behind the best of all possible tobaccos and
then go, heads high, into the market place with their wares,
confident that the inborn sense of right and wrong, of good and
bad, of worthy and unworthy, which is the natural instinct of
every American, will result in a modest return to themselves
for their long hours and dedicated labors—not, let me hasten to
add, that money is of first importance to the makers of Marlboro;
all these simple men require is plain, wholesome food, plenty of
Marlboros, and the knowledge that they have scattered a bit of
sunshine into the lives of smokers everywhere; if, I say, you
have been reading this column, you may remember that last
week we started to discuss Christmas gifts.

We agreed, of course, to give cartons of Marlboro to all our
friends and also to as many total strangers as possible. Today
let us look into some other welcome gifts.
Do you know someone who is interested in American history?
If so, he will surely appreciate a statuette of Millard Fillmore
with a clock in the stomach. (Mr. Fillmore, incidentally, was
the only American president with a clock in the stomach.
James K. Polk had a stem-winder in his head, and William
Henry Harrison chimed the quarter-hour, but only Mr. Fillmore,
of all our chief executives, had a clock in the stomach. Franklin
Pierce had a sweep second hand and Zachary Taylor had
seventeen jewels, but, I repeat, Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Fillmore
alone had a clock in the stomach. Some say that Mr. Fillmore
was also the first president with power steering, but most
historians assign this distinction to Chester A. Arthur. How
ever, it has been established beyond doubt that Mr. Fillmore
was the first president with a thermostat. Small wonder they
called him Old Hickory 1)
But I digress. To get back to welcome and unusual Christmas
gifts, here's one that's sure to please—a gift certificate from the
American Chiropractic Society. Accompanying each certificate
is this winsome little poem:
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year,
Joyous sacro-iliac!
May your spine fonver shine,
Blessings on your aching bach.
May your lumbar ne'er grow number,
May your backbone ne'er dislodge,
May your caudal never dawdle,
Joycux Noel! Heureux massage!
