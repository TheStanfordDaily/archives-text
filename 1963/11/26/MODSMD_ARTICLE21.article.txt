"And do not fear these who kill the body but not the soul; rather fear him
who ran destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for
a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's
will. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore;
you are of more value than many sparrows. So every one who acknowledges
me before men, I will also acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven,
but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who
is in heaven, but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before
my Father who is in heaven. Do you think that I have come to bring peace
on earth; 1 have not come to bring peace, but a sword." Mall. 10:28-34 K.I.
"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God,
to them who are called according to his purpose."' Rom. 8:28 K.I.
"Do not set your hearts on the godless world or anything in it. Anyone
who lives the world is a stranger to the Father's love. Everything the world
affords, all that panders to the appetites, or entices the eyes, all the glamour
of its life, springs not from the Father but from the godless world. And that
world is passing away with all its allurements, but he who does God's will
stands for evermore." I John 2:15-17 NE.
"Cod is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore
will not we fear, though the earth be removed, ami though the mountains
be carried into the midst of the sea: Though the waters thereof roar and be
troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. There is
a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place
of the tabernacles of the most High. God is in the midst of her: she shall
not be moved: God shall help her and that right early. The heathen raged,
the kingdoms were moved: he uttered hi> voice, the earth melted. I lie Eord
of hosts is with us; the Gr>d of Jacob is our refuge. Come, behold the
works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth. He maketh !
wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he brcaketh the bow, and rutlcth I
the spear iu sunder; he burnetii the chariot in the fire. Be still, and know
that I atn God: 1 will be exalted among the heathen. I will be exalted in
the earth. The Lord of hosts with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.'
