# Tutors Organized By Eating Clubs

### RICK ALLSTETTER 
The Stanford Eating Clubs
have organized a tutorial program
for freshmen who suddenly find
themselves in need of help in any
one or several of their courses.
The Eating Clubs, as a group,
have consistently had the highest
men's grade point average on
campus, and thus are well quali
fied for the tutorial task. The
program, under the direction of
Roger Cowan, has already been
met with enthusiasm by many
freshmen to whom exams seem
terribly close, and also terribly
frightening. On one corridor in
Branner a third of the girls have
asked for help.
THE REACTION to the pro
gram in the Eating Clubs was
very gratifying Cowan said.
There are now 40 tutors in 20
different subjects. Sponsors on
the freshmen corridors have been
given lists of courses and tutors
so that they can talk to those
people who might want to get in
voked in the program. Unlike
previous efforts, the Eating Club
program is getting to the student
through his sponsor so that the
student will not have to hunt
around the campus for help.
Meetings with the freshmen are
held once or twice a week. There
are no definite hours or days, and
this convenience is one of the
program's assets.
I) WIGHT CLARK, Dean of
Freshmen Men, feels that the pro
gram will be of help in three
ways. Aside from the obvious aid
in scholastics, it will bring upper
classmen and freshmen together,
; groups that are otherwise split up
' because of the nature of student
| housing. It will also provide a
i way in which Stanford as a schol-
I astic community, "can begin to
see our obligations to the people
around us."
