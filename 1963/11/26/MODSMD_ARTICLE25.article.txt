# Stanford Contests Postponed; Few Sports Events Held
## 
### 
Few athletic contests were
played across the country this
weekend. Most colleges canceled
or postponed their games, and in
the professionals, only the Na
tional Football League played
scheduled games.
At Stanford, Big Game was
postponed until this coming week
end and a soccer NCAA semifinal
game l>etween Stanford and USE
was postponed also. No new date
has been set for the game, al
though it will certainly be this
week.
THE POSTPONEMENT of Big
Game until Nov. 30 may also
cause the delaying of the Stan
ford basketball opener against
Oregon a few days. The game
was originally scheduled for Nov.
30, but will very likely be moved
to either Monday or Tuesday of
the following week.
The new date for Big Game
probably greatly increases the
Indians chances. The star half
back Steve Thurlow has an in
jured leg that was to have kept
him from starting Saturday. The
extra week many allow it to heal.
Clark Weaver, Stanford's start
ing quarterback earlier in the sea
son, had only last week begun to
work out following an injury that
has kept him out for most of the
season. He had not been expected
to bo of much value to the In
dians in Big Game, but now may
be able to see some action at
quarterback.
ONLY A HANDFUL of major
college football games were
played. In the most important
one, Nebraska upset Oklahoma
29-20 to win their first Big Eight
football crown. The game also
snapped a 16-game conference
winning streak for the Sooners.
The game earned the Cornhusk
ers an Orange Bowl bid.
Only one other bowl bid was
made Saturday. Western Ken

lucky, 50-0 conquerors of Murray
State, decided to play in the Tan
gerine Bowl.
In other major college games
Utah boat Utah State 25-23, Ar
kansas boat Texas Tech 27-20,
LSU beat Tulane 20-0, Auburn
heat Florida State 21-15, Tennes
see beat Kentucky 19-0, and Flor
ida beat Miami (Fla.) 27-21.
IN THE NFL the St. Louis
Cardinals upset the New York
Giants 24-17, to turn the Eastern
Division race into a three-way
tie. The Browns, who beat Dal
las 27-17. are now tied with the
Giants and Cards, all of whom
have K-3 records.
In the West, the Bears tied
Pittsburgh 17-17, to maintain a
narrow margin over the defend
ing champion Green Bay Pack
ers. The Packers beat the 49ers
28-10.

IN THE NFL the St. Louis
Cardinals upset the New York
Giants 24-17, to turn the Eastern
Division race into a three-way
tie. The Browns, who beat Dal
las 27-17. are now tied with the
Giants and Cards, all of whom
have K-3 records.
In the West, the Bears tied
Pittsburgh 17-17, to maintain a
narrow margin over the defend
ing champion Green Bay Pack
ers. The Packers beat the 49ers
28-10.
Few athletic contests were
played across the country this
weekend. Most colleges canceled
or postponed their games, and in
the professionals, only the Na
tional Football League played
scheduled games.
At Stanford, Big Game was
postponed until this coming week
end and a soccer NCAA semifinal
game l>etween Stanford and USE
was postponed also. No new date
has been set for the game, al
though it will certainly be this
week.
THE POSTPONEMENT of Big
Game until Nov. 30 may also
cause the delaying of the Stan
ford basketball opener against
Oregon a few days. The game
was originally scheduled for Nov.
30, but will very likely be moved
to either Monday or Tuesday of
the following week.
The new date for Big Game
probably greatly increases the
Indians chances. The star half
back Steve Thurlow has an in
jured leg that was to have kept
him from starting Saturday. The
extra week many allow it to heal.
Clark Weaver, Stanford's start
ing quarterback earlier in the sea
son, had only last week begun to
work out following an injury that
has kept him out for most of the
season. He had not been expected
to bo of much value to the In
dians in Big Game, but now may
be able to see some action at
quarterback.
ONLY A HANDFUL of major
college football games were
played. In the most important
one, Nebraska upset Oklahoma
29-20 to win their first Big Eight
football crown. The game also
snapped a 16-game conference
winning streak for the Sooners.
The game earned the Cornhusk
ers an Orange Bowl bid.
Only one other bowl bid was
made Saturday. Western Ken

State, decided to play in the Tan
