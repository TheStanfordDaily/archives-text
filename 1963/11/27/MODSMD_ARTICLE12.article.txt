Every American is now involved in the world. "The tragic events
of . . . turmoil through which wc have just passed have made us
citizens of the world," said Woodrow Wilson. For a time we tried
to dodge this new responsibility, but the world depression, World
War 11, and the Cold War have finally conveyed his message: "There
can be no turning back. Our own fortunes as a nation are involved—
whether we would have it so no not."
The emphasis in recent months, as our educational crisis becomes
clearer, has been on educating more scientists and engineers, to de
velop better weapons, to fight bigger wars. We are concerned, too,
about language training for our diplomats, about future military
leaders, about competing with the Russians in physics and ocean
ography and a host of similar vital subjects. All this is important
But arms and science alone will not save us.
In our concern for the future of America, wc dare not neglect the
education of its politicians.
I realize that most Americans are not concerned about the educa
tion of politicians. No education is considered necessary for political
success, except how to find your way around a smoke-filled room.
Those of you who are graduating this spring are urged to follow any
number of other careers. But few, if any, will urge you to become
politicians. Mothers may still want their sons to grow up to be
President, but, according to a famous Gallup poll of some years ago,
some 73 per cent do not want them to become politicians in the
process.
Successful politicians, according to Walter Lippmann, are "in
secure and intimidated men," who "advance politically only as they
placate, appease, bribe, seduce, bamboozle, or otherwise manage to
manipulate" the views and votes of the people who elect them. Years
ago the humorist Artemus Ward declared: "1 am not a politician,
and my other habits are good also."
Politics, in short, has become one of our most neglected, our most
abused, and our most ignored professions. Unfortunately, this dis
dain for the political profession is not only shared but intensified in
our academic institutions. For both teachers and students find it
difficult to accept the differences between the laboratory and the
legislature. In the former, the goal is truth, pure and simple, without
regard to changing currents of public opinion; in the latter, compro
mises and majorities and procedural customs and rights affect the
ultimate decision as to what is right or just or good.
And when they realize the difference, most intellectuals consider
their chief function to be that of the critic — and politicians are
sensitive to critics (posibly because we have so many of themi.
Of course, the intellectual's attitude is party defensive for he
has been regarded with so much suspicion and hostility by political
figures and their constituents that a recent survey of American
intellectuals by a national magazine elicited from one of our fore
most literary figures the guarded response, "I ain't no intellectual."
And so the worlds of practical politics and academic scholarship
have drifted apart. "Don't teach my boy poetry," a mother recently
wrote the headmaster of Eton; "don't teach my boy poetry, he's
going to stand for Parliament."
But this mutual suspicion was not always the case and I would
ask those of you who look with disdain and disfavor upon the pos
sibilities of a political career to remember that our nation's first
great politicians were traditionally our ablest, most respected, most
talented leaders, men who moved from one field to another with
amazing versatility and vitality. A contemporary described Thomas
Jefferson as "a gentleman of 32, who could calculate an eclipse, sur
vey an estate, tie an artery, plan an edifice, try a cause, break a
horse, dance a minuet, and play the violin."
John Quincy Adams, after being summarily dismissed from the
Senate for a notable display of independence, could become Boyls
ton Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard and then become
a great Secretary of State. (Those were the happy days when Har
vard professors had no difficulty getting Senate confirmation.)
Daniel Webster could throw thunderbolts at Hayne on the Senate
floor and then stroll a few steps down the corridor and dominate the
Supreme Court as the foremost lawyer of his time.
This link between American scholarship and the American politi
cian remained for more than a century. A little more than one hun
dred years ago, in the Presidential campaign of 1856, the Republicans
sent three brilliant orators around the campaign circuit: William
Cullen Bryant, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Ralph Waldo
Emerson. (In those times, apparently, the "eggheads" were all Re
publicans.)
It is clear, in any event, that these were men of talent — that in
former times our foremost scholars were interested in becoming our
foremost politicians.
I would urge therefore that each of you, regardless of your chosen
occupation, consider entering the field of politics at some stage in
your career. It is not necesary that you be famous, that you effect
radical changes in the government or that you are acclaimed by the
public for your efforts. It is not even necessary that you be success
ful.
I ask only that you offer to the political arena, and to the critical
problems of our society which are decided therein, the benefit of the
talents which society has helped to develop in you. I ask you to de
cide, as Goethe put it, whether you will be an anvil — or a hammer.
The formal phases of the "anvil" stage are now completed for many
of you, though hopefully you will continue to absorb still more in
the years ahead. The question now is whether you are to be a ham
mer—whether you are to give to the world in which you were reared
and educated the broadest benefits of that education.
It is not enough to lend your talents to merely discussing the
issues and deploring their solutions. But "Would you have counted
him a friend of Ancient Greece." as George William Curtis asked
a century ago during the Kansas-Nebraska Controversy, "who quietly
discussed the theory of patriotism on that Greek summer day
through whose hopeless and immortal hours Leonidas and his three
hundred stood at Thermopylae for liberty? Was John Milton to con
jugate Greek verbs in his library, or talk of the liberty of the ancient
Shunammites, when the liberty of Englishmen was imperilled?" No,
the duty of the scholar — particulaxly in a republic such as ours —
is to contribute his objective views and his sense of liberty to the
affairs of his state and nation.
If you are to be among the rulers of our land, from precinct cap
tain to President, if you are willing to.enter the abused and neglected
profession of politics, then let me tell you that we stolid in serious
need of the fruits of your education. We do not need political scholars
whoso education has been so specialized as to exclude them from
participation in current events. What we need axe men who can ride
easily broad fields of knowledge and recognize the mutual depend
ence of the two worlds of politics and scholarship.
We want from you not the sneers of the cynics nor the despair
of the fainthearted. We ask of you enlightenment, vision, illumina
tion.

sent three brilliant orators around the campaign circuit: William
Cullen Bryant, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Ralph Waldo
Emerson. (In those times, apparently, the "eggheads" were all Re
publicans.)
It is clear, in any event, that these were men of talent — that in
former times our foremost scholars were interested in becoming our
foremost politicians.
I would urge therefore that each of you, regardless of your chosen
occupation, consider entering the field of politics at some stage in
your career. It is not necesary that you be famous, that you effect
radical changes in the government or that you are acclaimed by the
public for your efforts. It is not even necessary that you be success
ful.
I ask only that you offer to the political arena, and to the critical
problems of our society which are decided therein, the benefit of the
talents which society has helped to develop in you. I ask you to de
cide, as Goethe put it, whether you will be an anvil — or a hammer.
The formal phases of the "anvil" stage are now completed for many
of you, though hopefully you will continue to absorb still more in
the years ahead. The question now is whether you are to be a ham
mer—whether you are to give to the world in which you were reared
and educated the broadest benefits of that education.
It is not enough to lend your talents to merely discussing the
issues and deploring their solutions. But "Would you have counted
him a friend of Ancient Greece." as George William Curtis asked
a century ago during the Kansas-Nebraska Controversy, "who quietly
discussed the theory of patriotism on that Greek summer day
through whose hopeless and immortal hours Leonidas and his three
hundred stood at Thermopylae for liberty? Was John Milton to con
jugate Greek verbs in his library, or talk of the liberty of the ancient
Shunammites, when the liberty of Englishmen was imperilled?" No,
the duty of the scholar — particulaxly in a republic such as ours —
is to contribute his objective views and his sense of liberty to the
affairs of his state and nation.
If you are to be among the rulers of our land, from precinct cap
tain to President, if you are willing to.enter the abused and neglected
profession of politics, then let me tell you that we stolid in serious
need of the fruits of your education. We do not need political scholars
whoso education has been so specialized as to exclude them from
participation in current events. What we need axe men who can ride
easily broad fields of knowledge and recognize the mutual depend
ence of the two worlds of politics and scholarship.
We want from you not the sneers of the cynics nor the despair
of the fainthearted. We ask of you enlightenment, vision, illumina
tion.

Every American is now involved in the world. "The tragic events
of . . . turmoil through which wc have just passed have made us
citizens of the world," said Woodrow Wilson. For a time we tried
to dodge this new responsibility, but the world depression, World
War 11, and the Cold War have finally conveyed his message: "There
can be no turning back. Our own fortunes as a nation are involved—
whether we would have it so no not."
The emphasis in recent months, as our educational crisis becomes
clearer, has been on educating more scientists and engineers, to de
velop better weapons, to fight bigger wars. We are concerned, too,
about language training for our diplomats, about future military
leaders, about competing with the Russians in physics and ocean
ography and a host of similar vital subjects. All this is important
But arms and science alone will not save us.
In our concern for the future of America, wc dare not neglect the
education of its politicians.
I realize that most Americans are not concerned about the educa
tion of politicians. No education is considered necessary for political
success, except how to find your way around a smoke-filled room.
Those of you who are graduating this spring are urged to follow any
number of other careers. But few, if any, will urge you to become
politicians. Mothers may still want their sons to grow up to be
President, but, according to a famous Gallup poll of some years ago,
some 73 per cent do not want them to become politicians in the
process.
Successful politicians, according to Walter Lippmann, are "in
secure and intimidated men," who "advance politically only as they
placate, appease, bribe, seduce, bamboozle, or otherwise manage to
manipulate" the views and votes of the people who elect them. Years
ago the humorist Artemus Ward declared: "1 am not a politician,
and my other habits are good also."
Politics, in short, has become one of our most neglected, our most
abused, and our most ignored professions. Unfortunately, this dis
dain for the political profession is not only shared but intensified in
our academic institutions. For both teachers and students find it
difficult to accept the differences between the laboratory and the
legislature. In the former, the goal is truth, pure and simple, without
regard to changing currents of public opinion; in the latter, compro
mises and majorities and procedural customs and rights affect the
ultimate decision as to what is right or just or good.
And when they realize the difference, most intellectuals consider
their chief function to be that of the critic — and politicians are
sensitive to critics (posibly because we have so many of themi.
Of course, the intellectual's attitude is party defensive for he
has been regarded with so much suspicion and hostility by political
figures and their constituents that a recent survey of American
intellectuals by a national magazine elicited from one of our fore
most literary figures the guarded response, "I ain't no intellectual."
And so the worlds of practical politics and academic scholarship
have drifted apart. "Don't teach my boy poetry," a mother recently
wrote the headmaster of Eton; "don't teach my boy poetry, he's
going to stand for Parliament."
But this mutual suspicion was not always the case and I would
ask those of you who look with disdain and disfavor upon the pos
sibilities of a political career to remember that our nation's first
great politicians were traditionally our ablest, most respected, most
talented leaders, men who moved from one field to another with
amazing versatility and vitality. A contemporary described Thomas
Jefferson as "a gentleman of 32, who could calculate an eclipse, sur
vey an estate, tie an artery, plan an edifice, try a cause, break a
horse, dance a minuet, and play the violin."
John Quincy Adams, after being summarily dismissed from the
Senate for a notable display of independence, could become Boyls
ton Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard and then become
a great Secretary of State. (Those were the happy days when Har
vard professors had no difficulty getting Senate confirmation.)
Daniel Webster could throw thunderbolts at Hayne on the Senate
floor and then stroll a few steps down the corridor and dominate the
Supreme Court as the foremost lawyer of his time.
This link between American scholarship and the American politi
cian remained for more than a century. A little more than one hun

placate, appease, bribe, seduce, bamboozle, or otherwise manage to
manipulate" the views and votes of the people who elect them. Years
ago the humorist Artemus Ward declared: "1 am not a politician,
and my other habits are good also."
Politics, in short, has become one of our most neglected, our most
abused, and our most ignored professions. Unfortunately, this dis
dain for the political profession is not only shared but intensified in
our academic institutions. For both teachers and students find it
difficult to accept the differences between the laboratory and the
legislature. In the former, the goal is truth, pure and simple, without
regard to changing currents of public opinion; in the latter, compro
mises and majorities and procedural customs and rights affect the
ultimate decision as to what is right or just or good.
And when they realize the difference, most intellectuals consider
their chief function to be that of the critic — and politicians are
sensitive to critics (posibly because we have so many of themi.
Of course, the intellectual's attitude is party defensive for he
has been regarded with so much suspicion and hostility by political
figures and their constituents that a recent survey of American
intellectuals by a national magazine elicited from one of our fore
most literary figures the guarded response, "I ain't no intellectual."
And so the worlds of practical politics and academic scholarship
have drifted apart. "Don't teach my boy poetry," a mother recently
wrote the headmaster of Eton; "don't teach my boy poetry, he's
going to stand for Parliament."
But this mutual suspicion was not always the case and I would
ask those of you who look with disdain and disfavor upon the pos
sibilities of a political career to remember that our nation's first
great politicians were traditionally our ablest, most respected, most
talented leaders, men who moved from one field to another with
amazing versatility and vitality. A contemporary described Thomas
Jefferson as "a gentleman of 32, who could calculate an eclipse, sur
vey an estate, tie an artery, plan an edifice, try a cause, break a
horse, dance a minuet, and play the violin."
John Quincy Adams, after being summarily dismissed from the
Senate for a notable display of independence, could become Boyls
ton Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard and then become
a great Secretary of State. (Those were the happy days when Har
vard professors had no difficulty getting Senate confirmation.)
Daniel Webster could throw thunderbolts at Hayne on the Senate
floor and then stroll a few steps down the corridor and dominate the
Supreme Court as the foremost lawyer of his time.
This link between American scholarship and the American politi
cian remained for more than a century. A little more than one hun
dred years ago, in the Presidential campaign of 1856, the Republicans
sent three brilliant orators around the campaign circuit: William
Cullen Bryant, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Ralph Waldo
Emerson. (In those times, apparently, the "eggheads" were all Re
publicans.)
It is clear, in any event, that these were men of talent — that in
former times our foremost scholars were interested in becoming our
foremost politicians.
I would urge therefore that each of you, regardless of your chosen
occupation, consider entering the field of politics at some stage in
your career. It is not necesary that you be famous, that you effect
radical changes in the government or that you are acclaimed by the
public for your efforts. It is not even necessary that you be success
ful.
I ask only that you offer to the political arena, and to the critical
problems of our society which are decided therein, the benefit of the
talents which society has helped to develop in you. I ask you to de
cide, as Goethe put it, whether you will be an anvil — or a hammer.
The formal phases of the "anvil" stage are now completed for many
of you, though hopefully you will continue to absorb still more in
the years ahead. The question now is whether you are to be a ham
mer—whether you are to give to the world in which you were reared
and educated the broadest benefits of that education.
It is not enough to lend your talents to merely discussing the
issues and deploring their solutions. But "Would you have counted
him a friend of Ancient Greece." as George William Curtis asked
a century ago during the Kansas-Nebraska Controversy, "who quietly
discussed the theory of patriotism on that Greek summer day
through whose hopeless and immortal hours Leonidas and his three
hundred stood at Thermopylae for liberty? Was John Milton to con
jugate Greek verbs in his library, or talk of the liberty of the ancient
Shunammites, when the liberty of Englishmen was imperilled?" No,
the duty of the scholar — particulaxly in a republic such as ours —
is to contribute his objective views and his sense of liberty to the
affairs of his state and nation.
If you are to be among the rulers of our land, from precinct cap
tain to President, if you are willing to.enter the abused and neglected
profession of politics, then let me tell you that we stolid in serious
need of the fruits of your education. We do not need political scholars
whoso education has been so specialized as to exclude them from
participation in current events. What we need axe men who can ride
easily broad fields of knowledge and recognize the mutual depend
ence of the two worlds of politics and scholarship.
We want from you not the sneers of the cynics nor the despair
of the fainthearted. We ask of you enlightenment, vision, illumina
tion.

Every American is now involved in the world. "The tragic events
of . . . turmoil through which wc have just passed have made us
citizens of the world," said Woodrow Wilson. For a time we tried
to dodge this new responsibility, but the world depression, World
War 11, and the Cold War have finally conveyed his message: "There
can be no turning back. Our own fortunes as a nation are involved—
whether we would have it so no not."
The emphasis in recent months, as our educational crisis becomes
clearer, has been on educating more scientists and engineers, to de
velop better weapons, to fight bigger wars. We are concerned, too,
about language training for our diplomats, about future military
leaders, about competing with the Russians in physics and ocean
ography and a host of similar vital subjects. All this is important
But arms and science alone will not save us.
In our concern for the future of America, wc dare not neglect the
education of its politicians.
I realize that most Americans are not concerned about the educa
tion of politicians. No education is considered necessary for political
success, except how to find your way around a smoke-filled room.
Those of you who are graduating this spring are urged to follow any
number of other careers. But few, if any, will urge you to become
politicians. Mothers may still want their sons to grow up to be
President, but, according to a famous Gallup poll of some years ago,
some 73 per cent do not want them to become politicians in the
process.

the duty of the scholar — particulaxly in a republic such as ours —
is to contribute his objective views and his sense of liberty to the
affairs of his state and nation.
If you are to be among the rulers of our land, from precinct cap
tain to President, if you are willing to.enter the abused and neglected
profession of politics, then let me tell you that we stolid in serious
need of the fruits of your education. We do not need political scholars
whoso education has been so specialized as to exclude them from
participation in current events. What we need axe men who can ride
easily broad fields of knowledge and recognize the mutual depend
ence of the two worlds of politics and scholarship.
We want from you not the sneers of the cynics nor the despair
of the fainthearted. We ask of you enlightenment, vision, illumina
tion.

Every American is now involved in the world. "The tragic events
of . . . turmoil through which wc have just passed have made us
citizens of the world," said Woodrow Wilson. For a time we tried
to dodge this new responsibility, but the world depression, World
War 11, and the Cold War have finally conveyed his message: "There
can be no turning back. Our own fortunes as a nation are involved—
whether we would have it so no not."
The emphasis in recent months, as our educational crisis becomes
clearer, has been on educating more scientists and engineers, to de
velop better weapons, to fight bigger wars. We are concerned, too,
about language training for our diplomats, about future military
leaders, about competing with the Russians in physics and ocean
ography and a host of similar vital subjects. All this is important
But arms and science alone will not save us.
In our concern for the future of America, wc dare not neglect the
education of its politicians.
I realize that most Americans are not concerned about the educa
tion of politicians. No education is considered necessary for political
success, except how to find your way around a smoke-filled room.
Those of you who are graduating this spring are urged to follow any
number of other careers. But few, if any, will urge you to become
politicians. Mothers may still want their sons to grow up to be
President, but, according to a famous Gallup poll of some years ago,
some 73 per cent do not want them to become politicians in the
process.
Successful politicians, according to Walter Lippmann, are "in
secure and intimidated men," who "advance politically only as they
placate, appease, bribe, seduce, bamboozle, or otherwise manage to
manipulate" the views and votes of the people who elect them. Years
ago the humorist Artemus Ward declared: "1 am not a politician,
and my other habits are good also."
Politics, in short, has become one of our most neglected, our most
abused, and our most ignored professions. Unfortunately, this dis
dain for the political profession is not only shared but intensified in
our academic institutions. For both teachers and students find it
difficult to accept the differences between the laboratory and the
legislature. In the former, the goal is truth, pure and simple, without
regard to changing currents of public opinion; in the latter, compro
mises and majorities and procedural customs and rights affect the
ultimate decision as to what is right or just or good.
And when they realize the difference, most intellectuals consider
their chief function to be that of the critic — and politicians are
sensitive to critics (posibly because we have so many of themi.
Of course, the intellectual's attitude is party defensive for he
has been regarded with so much suspicion and hostility by political
figures and their constituents that a recent survey of American
intellectuals by a national magazine elicited from one of our fore
most literary figures the guarded response, "I ain't no intellectual."
And so the worlds of practical politics and academic scholarship
have drifted apart. "Don't teach my boy poetry," a mother recently
wrote the headmaster of Eton; "don't teach my boy poetry, he's
going to stand for Parliament."
But this mutual suspicion was not always the case and I would
ask those of you who look with disdain and disfavor upon the pos
sibilities of a political career to remember that our nation's first
great politicians were traditionally our ablest, most respected, most
talented leaders, men who moved from one field to another with
amazing versatility and vitality. A contemporary described Thomas
Jefferson as "a gentleman of 32, who could calculate an eclipse, sur
vey an estate, tie an artery, plan an edifice, try a cause, break a
horse, dance a minuet, and play the violin."
John Quincy Adams, after being summarily dismissed from the
Senate for a notable display of independence, could become Boyls
ton Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard and then become
a great Secretary of State. (Those were the happy days when Har
vard professors had no difficulty getting Senate confirmation.)
Daniel Webster could throw thunderbolts at Hayne on the Senate
floor and then stroll a few steps down the corridor and dominate the
Supreme Court as the foremost lawyer of his time.
This link between American scholarship and the American politi
cian remained for more than a century. A little more than one hun
dred years ago, in the Presidential campaign of 1856, the Republicans
sent three brilliant orators around the campaign circuit: William
Cullen Bryant, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Ralph Waldo
Emerson. (In those times, apparently, the "eggheads" were all Re
publicans.)
It is clear, in any event, that these were men of talent — that in
former times our foremost scholars were interested in becoming our
foremost politicians.
I would urge therefore that each of you, regardless of your chosen
occupation, consider entering the field of politics at some stage in
your career. It is not necesary that you be famous, that you effect
radical changes in the government or that you are acclaimed by the
public for your efforts. It is not even necessary that you be success
ful.
I ask only that you offer to the political arena, and to the critical
problems of our society which are decided therein, the benefit of the
talents which society has helped to develop in you. I ask you to de
cide, as Goethe put it, whether you will be an anvil — or a hammer.
The formal phases of the "anvil" stage are now completed for many
of you, though hopefully you will continue to absorb still more in
the years ahead. The question now is whether you are to be a ham
mer—whether you are to give to the world in which you were reared
and educated the broadest benefits of that education.
It is not enough to lend your talents to merely discussing the
issues and deploring their solutions. But "Would you have counted
him a friend of Ancient Greece." as George William Curtis asked
a century ago during the Kansas-Nebraska Controversy, "who quietly
discussed the theory of patriotism on that Greek summer day
through whose hopeless and immortal hours Leonidas and his three
hundred stood at Thermopylae for liberty? Was John Milton to con
jugate Greek verbs in his library, or talk of the liberty of the ancient
Shunammites, when the liberty of Englishmen was imperilled?" No,
the duty of the scholar — particulaxly in a republic such as ours —
is to contribute his objective views and his sense of liberty to the
affairs of his state and nation.
