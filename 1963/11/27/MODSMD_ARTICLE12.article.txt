Every American is now involved in the world. "The tragic events
of . . . turmoil through which wc have just passed have made us
citizens of the world," said Woodrow Wilson. For a time we tried
to dodge this new responsibility, but the world depression, World
War 11, and the Cold War have finally conveyed his message: "There
can be no turning back. Our own fortunes as a nation are involved—
whether we would have it so no not."
The emphasis in recent months, as our educational crisis becomes
clearer, has been on educating more scientists and engineers, to de
velop better weapons, to fight bigger wars. We are concerned, too,
about language training for our diplomats, about future military
leaders, about competing with the Russians in physics and ocean
ography and a host of similar vital subjects. All this is important
But arms and science alone will not save us.
In our concern for the future of America, wc dare not neglect the
education of its politicians.
I realize that most Americans are not concerned about the educa
tion of politicians. No education is considered necessary for political
success, except how to find your way around a smoke-filled room.
Those of you who are graduating this spring are urged to follow any
number of other careers. But few, if any, will urge you to become
politicians. Mothers may still want their sons to grow up to be
President, but, according to a famous Gallup poll of some years ago,
some 73 per cent do not want them to become politicians in the
process.
Successful politicians, according to Walter Lippmann, are "in
secure and intimidated men," who "advance politically only as they
placate, appease, bribe, seduce, bamboozle, or otherwise manage to
manipulate" the views and votes of the people who elect them. Years
ago the humorist Artemus Ward declared: "1 am not a politician,
and my other habits are good also."
Politics, in short, has become one of our most neglected, our most
abused, and our most ignored professions. Unfortunately, this dis
dain for the political profession is not only shared but intensified in
our academic institutions. For both teachers and students find it
difficult to accept the differences between the laboratory and the
legislature. In the former, the goal is truth, pure and simple, without
regard to changing currents of public opinion; in the latter, compro
mises and majorities and procedural customs and rights affect the
ultimate decision as to what is right or just or good.
And when they realize the difference, most intellectuals consider
their chief function to be that of the critic — and politicians are
sensitive to critics (posibly because we have so many of themi.
Of course, the intellectual's attitude is party defensive for he
has been regarded with so much suspicion and hostility by political
figures and their constituents that a recent survey of American
intellectuals by a national magazine elicited from one of our fore
most literary figures the guarded response, "I ain't no intellectual."
And so the worlds of practical politics and academic scholarship
have drifted apart. "Don't teach my boy poetry," a mother recently
wrote the headmaster of Eton; "don't teach my boy poetry, he's
going to stand for Parliament."
But this mutual suspicion was not always the case and I would
ask those of you who look with disdain and disfavor upon the pos
