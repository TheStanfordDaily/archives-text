# New Kennedy Memorial To Aid Scholar-Politician
## 
### ILENE H. STIRELITZ Editor 
The establishment of a John
Fitzgerald Kennedy memorial
fund to encourage and facilitate
training in professional politics
is being planned to enlarge such
programs as the Stanford-in-
Washington internship.
The idea for the fund was the
product of the large number of
phone calls and visits received by

student leaders over the long
weekend following the President's
assassination, all urging the con
tribution of funds to some pur
pose relating to the loss suffered
by the nation Friday.
PLANNING IS in process to
have a benefit concert next
quarter, featuring a widely
known vocalist or vocal group,
in order to establish the memo

rial.
As a senator in 1958, John
Kennedy stated to the students
of the University of Wisconsin:
"Politics . . . has become one
of our most neglected, our most
abused, and our most ignored
professions. Unfortunately, this
disdain for the political profes
sion is not only shared but inten
sified in our academic institutions
... in former times our foremost
scholars were interested in be
coming our foremost politicians.
"I ASK ONLY that you offer
to the political arena, and to the
critical problems of our society
which are decided therein, the
benefit of the talents which so
ciety has helped to develop in
you . . . we stand in serious need
of the fruits of your education."
(The full text of the speech is
reprinted below.)
It is the connection between
academic and politics that Ken
nedy speaks of, and which Pro
fessor Otis Pease cited Friday
night as the thing he would most
like to remember about the late
President, that the fund would
foster.
Planning for the fund includes
investigating the possibility of a
benefit concert each year on or
about the 22 of November, the
day of the President's death, and
a lecture at that time on the sub
ject of the academician an d
politics.
LAST SUMMER 14 Stanford
students worked on Capitol Hill
through the Stanford-in-Washing
ton program. This year the stu
dent-faculty group which or
ganizes the internship plans to
send a larger number.
Last summer's interns were en
gaged in many tasks: researching
and analyzing legislative issues
for their employers, compiling in
formation and preparing speeches,
committee testimony, press re
leases, and statements for the
Congressional Record. Several
students had iong-'erm assign
ments; one, on the staff of the
Senate Commerce Committee,
prepared all final transcripts of
the hearings on the Public Ac
commodations bill. Another cov
ered civil rights legislation in
three major committees.

A meeting will be held at
3:15 this afternoon in the large
lounge of Tresidder for all stu
dents interested in applying for
positions with Congressmen,
lobbyists and executive offices
through the Stanford-in-Wash
ington summer internship pro

As a senator in 1958, John
Kennedy stated to the students
of the University of Wisconsin:
"Politics . . . has become one
of our most neglected, our most
abused, and our most ignored
professions. Unfortunately, this
disdain for the political profes
sion is not only shared but inten
sified in our academic institutions
... in former times our foremost
scholars were interested in be
coming our foremost politicians.
"I ASK ONLY that you offer
to the political arena, and to the
critical problems of our society
which are decided therein, the
benefit of the talents which so
ciety has helped to develop in
you . . . we stand in serious need
of the fruits of your education."

It is the connection between
academic and politics that Ken
nedy speaks of, and which Pro
fessor Otis Pease cited Friday
night as the thing he would most
like to remember about the late
President, that the fund would
foster.
Planning for the fund includes
investigating the possibility of a
benefit concert each year on or
about the 22 of November, the
day of the President's death, and
a lecture at that time on the sub
ject of the academician an d
politics.
LAST SUMMER 14 Stanford
students worked on Capitol Hill
through the Stanford-in-Washing
ton program. This year the stu
dent-faculty group which or
ganizes the internship plans to
send a larger number.
Last summer's interns were en
gaged in many tasks: researching
and analyzing legislative issues
for their employers, compiling in
formation and preparing speeches,
committee testimony, press re
leases, and statements for the
Congressional Record. Several
students had iong-'erm assign
ments; one, on the staff of the
Senate Commerce Committee,
prepared all final transcripts of
the hearings on the Public Ac
commodations bill. Another cov
ered civil rights legislation in
three major committees.

A meeting will be held at
3:15 this afternoon in the large
lounge of Tresidder for all stu
dents interested in applying for
positions with Congressmen,
lobbyists and executive offices
through the Stanford-in-Wash
ington summer internship pro
gram.
The establishment of a John
Fitzgerald Kennedy memorial
fund to encourage and facilitate
training in professional politics
is being planned to enlarge such
programs as the Stanford-in-
Washington internship.
The idea for the fund was the
product of the large number of
phone calls and visits received by

student leaders over the long
weekend following the President's
assassination, all urging the con
tribution of funds to some pur
pose relating to the loss suffered
by the nation Friday.
