# The 						Kennedy Vision
## 
### 
John Fitzgerald Kennedy was a man with a vision. His
vision encompassed a commitment to the application of man's
learning to political endeavor. He was a man who concerned
himself with the support of artists, with sending out high
school counsellors over the summer to encourage drop-outs
to complete high school, with mobilizing America's youth to
serve in underdeveloped lands.
At the University of Minnesota in 195S the then Senator
Kennedy made an eloquent plea for the educated man to
enter the political arena, to directly apply the learning the
society had given him to the strengthening and broadening of
that society.
It was this commitment to all that the minds of men make
their province that characterized the personal philosophy of
our late President; this was the driving vision of the man and
the new frontier that he set. And it is this vision that must
continue to live.
Tt is most appropriate, then, that the Stanford community
will inaugurate a memorial which will send young academi
cians to the heart of the American political process. It is
most appropriate that on Monday night a group of students
gathered, after almost four days of the inaction of stunned
disbelief, to organize to perpetuate in our modest way the
intelligence, learning, and decency that John Fitzgerald
Kennedy epitomized in the area of professional politics. It
befits the spirit our President left with ns.
