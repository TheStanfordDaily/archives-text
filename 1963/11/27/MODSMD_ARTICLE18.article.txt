THE BELL TOLLS
Editor, The Daily:
Will man open his eyes and see.
"Perchance hee for whom this
Bell tolls, may be so ill, as that
he knowes not it tolls for him;
And perchance I may thinke my
selfe so much better than I am,
as that they who are about mee.
and see my state, may have
caused it to toll for mee, and I
know not that. . . . "Who bends
not his eare to any bell, which
upon any occasion rings? but
who can remove it from that
bell, which is passing a peece of
himselfe out of this world? No
man is an Island, intire of it
selfe; every man is a peece of
the Continent, a part of the
maine; if a Clod bee washed away
by the sea, Europe is the lesse,
as well as if a Promontorie were,
as well as if a Mannor of thy
friends or of thine owne were;
any mans death diminishes me,
because I am involved in Man
kinde; And therefore never send
to know tor whom the bell tolls;
It tolls for thee."
(John Donne. Devotions Upon
Emergent Occasions. Meditation
XVII.)
Civilization has been set back.
You and I have lost. Man has
lost a right to his place in the
sun. The knot in every man's
stomach must cry out in anguish
for a love that will lead us to un
derstanding and peace — a love
that will make us whole and
worthy of the sun which warms
our faces.
If this is not so; if all men's
stomachs are full and satisfied,
then man remains a beast to live
by the sword forever.

AMERICANS NEED FAITH
Editor, The Daily:
The irresponsibility of taking
and not giving is dangerous at
any time, and the doom of those
who will not yield self-interest to
a community spirit is already
visible. A country's surest de
fense is the loyal brotherliness
of all its people and their respon
sible faith in serving one another.
In witnessing the events of the
past week-end, I wonder if Amer
ica will not ruin itself by carrying
to excess the principles of liberty
and equality? It gives me the im
pression that America has trained
her citizens in such fashion that
they look upon insolence as
democracy, lawlessness as liberty,
impudence of speech as equality,
and license to do what they
please as happiness.
Liberty not joined with faith
is already half dead. Americans
have for the most part not had
faith enough in themselves to de
mand a decisive share in the work
of democracy. You have shirked
your responsibility, and faith,
the most friendly force, you have
left to preachers and invalids
when it should have been com
municated throughout society.
Too few Americans are mind
ful of democracy's future. Too
little do they realize or teach that
democracy is thought-brain pow
er applied to daily living and di
rected toward the safe-guarding
of every human right. Otherwise
it could not be the brotherhood
which enhalos Lincoln's brow.
The present crisis and dies irae,
I believe, will cause a spiritual
reawakening in the self-examina
tion and check the decadence
sweeping over this country. Leav
ing our freeman's heritage un
defended you have imposed upon
yourselves an implicable Must
that brooks no choice or denial.
It is only natural that lovers
of liberty the world over should
center their hopes about the
United States of America. For it
was here that democracy was
first attempted on a large scale.
It was America that originated
the first practical union of free
states, each working ils own des
tiny while submitting to a federal
government policies of national
scope. To be sure, American
democracy is far from what it
should be. but it would be a griev
ous calamity if its faith was lost
to mankind.
But this will not happen if

America places faith at the fore
front of its endeavors. There
are qualities in American people
which inspire my confidence.
Naturally emotional affection in
these trying days for them has a
part in my judgment, but from
the time this great republic was
established down to the last Fri
day's tragedy Americans have
blazed up in generous fury for
the disinherited, the victim of
cruelty and neglect. Their world
embracing crusades against pov
erty and ignorance reveal a heroic
temper such as only faith can
forge. Their colossal gifts toward
the rebuilding of war-ruined
areas on the other continents
need no comment. When the gov
ernment has not acted, countless
individual Americans have made
the cause of the oppressed their
own in other lands. For a people
to be of great heart is a priceless
cornerstone for a worthier civili
zation.
Moved by these thoughts I
plead with the American people
to take back into their lives the
faith which has piloted them
through three changeful centur
ies.
Let us go back to keep alive the
gleam,
To cherish the immortal, godlike
dream,
Not as poor cravens flying from
the fight,
But as sad children seeking the
clean light.
It was the faith of your Fathers
that brought its unique heritage
to this nation. Democracy is com
pound of faith embodied in fel
lowship, knowledge and action.
These cannot be sundered with
out incalculable violence to per
sonal liberty and people's wel
fare. Democracy is a searching
test of charcter, and no respon
sibility is more fateful than its
maintenance.
How can you be weaklings
when you look at Europe who for
thousands of years have fore
seen disaster past imagining and
yet have kept on living danger
ously, calmly, producing splendid
literatures, magnificent works of
art and philosophies that you
have not overtaken? How could
they have done it without faith
as irresistable as hunger or the
first cry of a child? Surely it is
not in you to falter as you wit
ness the faith which has sus
tained humanity in ages past.
Cynical doubt and irresponsi
bility gnaw at their roots when
faith grows cold. The world be
comes a chaos which is seized
upon by lawless minds ruthlessly
perverted to purposes alien to the
dignity of man. It is my sincere
hope that Americans will "never
let themselves be trodden upon
mentally or morally as stepping
stones to despotism. Keep always
open a refuge for the unfettered
intellect and the hand that tears
away the yoke of ignorance! Con
secrate with your lives and if
need be your blood the heritage
you have wrought out of earth's
best races and ideals! That is the
holiest memorial—the only ac
ceptable onc--you can dedicate
to the Old World whose strug
gling impulses Godward and fruit
ful scholarship and passion for
beauty throb through the New."
