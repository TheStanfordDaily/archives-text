## Purge Hatred, Venom; Seek Consensus 
### 
The first need of the country is to take to heart the nature of this
unspeakable crime. There is no public crisis at home or abroad which
demands such instant attention that it cannot wait until we have col
lected ourselves and can proceed deliberately. But there is a searing
internal crisis within the American spirit which we have first to rea
lize and then to resolve.
The American future depends on it and our capacity to govern
ourselves. What we have to realize is that, though speech and gossip
and rumor are free, the safety of the republic is at stake when ex
tremists go unrestrained. Extremists may profess any ideology. But
what they all have in common is that they treat opponents as ene
mies, as outside the laws and the community of their fellow men.
WHAT HAPPENED IN Dallas could, to be sure, have happened
in another city. But it must be said that the murder of the President
was not the first act of political violence in that city, but one in a
series. The man who is now the President of the United States was
manhandled by his fellow Texans. The man who represents the
United States at the United Nations was spat upon.
In this atmosphere of political violence lived the President's
murderer, himself addicted to the fascination of violence in his fu
tile and lonely and brooding existence. The salient fact about him
was his alienation from humanity, from country, family and friends.
Nothing within him, it would seem, bound him to the President or
to the gover nor as human beings. No human feeling stayed his hand.
In his alienation, Lee Oswald turned to the left. But that was in
cidental. Those who assaulted Lyndon Johnson and Adlai Stevenson
had turned to the right. The common characteristic of all of them
was their alienation, the loss of their ties, the rupture of the com
munity.
AN EXTREMIST IS an outsider. For him, the government in
Washington is a hated foreign power, and the President in Washing
ton is an invading conqueror. There is no limit, therefore, to his
hatred which feeds upon the venom of malice, slander and hallucina
tion. In Dallas today there is much searching of conscience, and well
there should be. For Dallas has long been conspicuous for its toler
ance of extremists and for the inability of its decent citizens, un
doubtedly the great majority, to restrain the extremists and restore
a condition of honest and temperate and reasonable discussion.
It was comforting, therefore, to read on Sunday that the mayor
of Dallas, Earle Cabell, had said that "each of us, in prayerful reflec

tion, must search his heart and determine if, through intemperate
word or deed, we might have contributed in some fashion to the
movement of this mind across the brink of insanity."
We must all follow the mayor of Dallas in that prayerful reflec
tion. For it is only too easy to forget that in a free country there
must be not only liberty and equality, but also fraternity.
THE ONLY solace for the nation's shame and grief can come
from a purge or at least the reduction of the hatred and venom which
lie so close to the surface of our national life. We have allowed the
community of the American people to be rent with enmity. Only if
and as we can find our way back into the American community will
we find our way back to confidence in the American destiny.
We must stop the flow of the poison that when men differ, say
abotit taxes or civil rights or Russia, they cannot be reconciled by
persuasion and debate and that those who take the other view are
implacable enemies. In the light of this monstrous crime, we can
see that in a free country, which we are and intend to be, unre
strained speech and thought are inherently subversive. Democracy
can be made to work only when the bounds of the community are in
violate and stronger than all the parties and factions and interests
and sects.
I wish I felt certain that the self-realization into which grief has
shocked us will endure when we go back about our business. The
divisive forces of hatred and ungovernability are strong among us,
and the habit of intemperate speech and thought has become deeply
ingrained. It is deepened by the strains of war and the frustrations
of this revolutionary age, by the exploitation of violence and cruelty
in the mass media, by the profusion of weapons and by the presence
of so many who know how to use them.
BUT I I)() have much hope in the healing arts of Lyndon John
son. We can turn to him with confidence. For his great gift is in
finding the consensus without which the American system of gov
ernment with its states and regions, its checks and balances is un
workable.
To find the consensus among our divided and angry people is his
historic opportunity. To restore the internal peace of the United
States is his unique mission.
That done, all else will be manageable.
