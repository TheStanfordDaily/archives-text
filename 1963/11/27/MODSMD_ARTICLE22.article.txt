FITTING 31 ON U >1E N T
Editor, The Daily:
Few people have the chance to

become at all emotional about
the current and historical events
that will alter the lives of their
progeny. Few people can claim
they have a direct personal stake
in the happenings of and to an
other person, thousands of miles
away, whom they have never met.
That the death of John F. Ken
nedy has affected and effected
such unparalleled numbers, is of
course related to his office, pres
tige and power, is beyond ques
tion. That millions grieve at his
horrendous loss, is a tribute not
simply to some position in gov
ernment, but to the loss of a
very great man.
Today the heart of the nation
has a weaker pulse. The step of
a great army of humanity is
slowed. The head of a great coun
try is dead. The heads of a
mighty people are bowed in
silence, in shock, in disbelief, and
in agony. For few events occur
in the lives of a world populace
that have such drama, sorrow
and poignancy as the brutal slay
ing of the President of the United
States of America.
The Ger man mauser owned by
a hate-filled, demented fanatic
has changed world history. It
has also served as the basis for
the novels, songs, murals, pas
sion plays and sad memories that
will grow out of this tragedy.
This dreadful demise is the cul
mination of a tragedy having so
many of the classic elements of
the violent deaths of the Christ,
Caesar, Lincoln and Mahatma
Gandi: the electric expectation in
the air, the crowds screaming,
and the presence of a great man
surrounded by friends, lovers,
guards, and enemies. The hopes,
the dreams, the hatred, the past
and promising brilliant future of
a man — who by his unique abil
ity to galvanize emotions has
risen above the humanity from
which he came — meet death
with a visage contorted with the
agony and despair of those few

moments that transcend history.
Then enter the unmitigated
emotions of the mass: the grief,
the impotence, the indignation
and the anger. But these will
hardly bring him back again. He
is gone, but must we only respect
his memory? Of course, the
memory of the person will re
main, will be exalted. But what
of those things in which he be
lieved, for which he fought? The
attempt to bring equal opportun
ity and franchise to all citizens.
The never fearing to negotiate,
but never out of fear. The ask
ing what we can do for the na
tion, instead of demanding serv
ices from it. The desire to reform
our outmolded, penalizing ta x
system. What of them anyway?
If we continue to hold to these
aims, ideals, and credos as some
thing legitimate, if we fight for
their fruition and achieve it. then
we have created a memorial to
John F. Kennedy far more fitting
and enduring than any heroic
publications or gigantic marble
monuments. If not, something
will have died within us also on
the streets of Dallas.

BOYS' CLUB
Editor, Tire Daily:
The Boys' Club of Menlo Park
has received some valuable assist
ance from students of Stanford.
This assistance took the form of
labor at the Boys' Club site in
East Menlo Park.
When it is completed the Club
will serve boys in Palo Alto, Men
lo Park, and the surrounding
area. We are pleased that stu
dents at Stanford agree with
local citizens that this is a worth
while project.
I want to thank particularly
the men of Wilbur Hall, Alpha
Delta Phi, and Theta Delta Chi
for their help. Special apprecia
tion is also due Don Haider for
helping to generate interest on
the campus.
May I say "thank you" for the
Board of Directors of the Boys'
Club of Menlo Park. We hope you
will continue to support the Club.
Sincerely,
—TEI) TANNER
