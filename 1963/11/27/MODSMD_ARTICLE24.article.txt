# DRAMA REVIEW
## Mussel Play Confused, Weakly Acted But Fun 
### MANUEL FREEDMAN 
A private audience saw the dress rehearsal of Musset's "No
Trifling With Love," performed by the Stanford Players Monday
night. Applaud those who appreciated it: not from ihe production
end entirely — for Mussel, oh, Musset. The playwright got himself
into an old trap. The first act was a sparkling farce. The second act

was a philosophical debate. - 1
So he needed a terribly tedious
third act to work out the compli
cations of the debate and mould
the farce with it for the ultimate
tragedy it becomes. In the second
act, he drives his characters to
the edge of a cliff, they are about
to fall . . . when, 10, some god out
of the blue builds a bridge for
them to the other side of the
gulf. No doubt a tricky thing.
THE WOMAN (Camille) has
returned from a nunnery to ren
le/.vous with her uncle's son (Per
dican), who has just completed
no less than four doctorates. The
Woman of the Cloister brings her
ideas of love against those of the
Man of the World. Perdican liter
ally devastates the monastic sys
tem and we libertines in the au
dience cheer. The nun, who does
not want to trifle with a deceit
ful love, who only wants a love
that is "the real thing," is then
seemingly convinced that the
whole monastic system is im
moral!
The rest is complex. Camille
tried to deceive Perdican in order
to test him. He discovers what
she is doing, so he deceives her
by deceiving her deception. He
makes love (with mere words,
readers) to Camille's foster sis
ter in front of Camille and pro
poses. The foster sister falls in
love. Camille has flunked the test.
She rescinds in a trembling em
brace before the altar of a church.
The foster sister sees who Perdi
can really loves and dies. Camille
says farewell to him, his mouth
falls open in horror, and the cur
tain falls.
HJIM. Musset pulls the old
O'Henry twist and seems to say
that even when you don't trifle
with love, it's useless anyway. Is
that true?
Now: Director Michael Addi
son was as confused as I was in
trying to see whether it was-a
farce or tragedy. But look what
Musset gave him. Dale Wilson
as Perdican is faced with a role
that first makes him out to be a
nimcompoop philanderer, then
the all-knowing savant of th e
world. Perdican is kind of a self
contained ping pong match. In
between is Mr. Wilson trying to
decide how to act him.
Jane House plays Camille very
tragically, as indeed Musset did

not write her. It's known as "en
larging one's role." It's not Miss
House's fault. Her dilemmas are
silly to begin with. The death of
the foster sister is the result of
her own deeeitfulncss. But she
blames everything on Perdican
anyway. Miss House dominates
the scenes with Wilson, partly
because Masset's Perdican is so
confused, and partly because Mr.
Wilson's is too.
I BELIEVE, however, that
when one cries on stage, one
makes them real tears. Anna
Munro as the shy foster sister
Rosette is delicate, but so much
so that it's hard to hear her some
times, even in the Little Theatre.
Linda Bishop as Dame Plunche is
very farcical. She shrieks an d
squeaks well enough, but I won
der really why Musset put her
in the play.
Lee Projector was a strange
chorus. He did not do it too well
nor was it written very well for
him. Bruce Salvatore as the Tu
tor and Larry Madison as the
Priest are good examples of
French farce. Musset skillfully
satirizes the clergy with them.
But again play and player di d
not come together. Salvatore is
still Osric of two weeks ago.
Madison is very good, but occa
sionally loses all contact with
the audience, very vital for an
actor.
CONRAD BISHOP as Perdi
ean's father the Baron is dynamic.
He shakes with old age very
rhythmically and hypnotizes you
very well with it. He has some
brilliant (some not so) moments
and I recommend his performance
along with Madison. Lars Kamp
mann with his ten lines enlarges
his part to the nth degree . . .
and he does it well.
The light cues designed by
Peter Young were not always co
ordinated and on time. The sets
by Terry Alsa befitted the pur
pose of the Little Theatre: em
phasis on acting. But, as I say.
this was dress rehearsal. A lot
always happens from then to per
formance. Go see it. It's fun.
But hurry: it closes tonight.
The final performance of "No
Trifling With Love," will be to
night at 8:30 in the Little Thea
tre. Tickets will be sold at the
door, $1.00 general admission and
75 cents for students.

not want to trifle with a deceit
ful love, who only wants a love
that is "the real thing," is then
seemingly convinced that the
whole monastic system is im
moral!
The rest is complex. Camille
tried to deceive Perdican in order
to test him. He discovers what
she is doing, so he deceives her
by deceiving her deception. He
makes love (with mere words,
readers) to Camille's foster sis
ter in front of Camille and pro
poses. The foster sister falls in
love. Camille has flunked the test.
She rescinds in a trembling em
brace before the altar of a church.
The foster sister sees who Perdi
can really loves and dies. Camille
says farewell to him, his mouth
falls open in horror, and the cur
tain falls.
HJIM. Musset pulls the old
O'Henry twist and seems to say
that even when you don't trifle
with love, it's useless anyway. Is
that true?
Now: Director Michael Addi
son was as confused as I was in
trying to see whether it was-a
farce or tragedy. But look what
Musset gave him. Dale Wilson
as Perdican is faced with a role
that first makes him out to be a
nimcompoop philanderer, then
the all-knowing savant of th e
world. Perdican is kind of a self
contained ping pong match. In
between is Mr. Wilson trying to
decide how to act him.
Jane House plays Camille very
tragically, as indeed Musset did

not write her. It's known as "en
larging one's role." It's not Miss
House's fault. Her dilemmas are
silly to begin with. The death of
the foster sister is the result of
her own deeeitfulncss. But she
blames everything on Perdican
anyway. Miss House dominates
the scenes with Wilson, partly
because Masset's Perdican is so
confused, and partly because Mr.
Wilson's is too.
I BELIEVE, however, that
when one cries on stage, one
makes them real tears. Anna
Munro as the shy foster sister
Rosette is delicate, but so much
so that it's hard to hear her some
times, even in the Little Theatre.
Linda Bishop as Dame Plunche is
very farcical. She shrieks an d
squeaks well enough, but I won
der really why Musset put her
in the play.
Lee Projector was a strange
chorus. He did not do it too well
nor was it written very well for
him. Bruce Salvatore as the Tu
tor and Larry Madison as the
Priest are good examples of
French farce. Musset skillfully
satirizes the clergy with them.
But again play and player di d
not come together. Salvatore is
still Osric of two weeks ago.
Madison is very good, but occa
sionally loses all contact with
the audience, very vital for an
actor.
CONRAD BISHOP as Perdi
ean's father the Baron is dynamic.
He shakes with old age very
rhythmically and hypnotizes you
very well with it. He has some
brilliant (some not so) moments
and I recommend his performance
along with Madison. Lars Kamp
mann with his ten lines enlarges
his part to the nth degree . . .
and he does it well.
The light cues designed by
Peter Young were not always co
ordinated and on time. The sets
by Terry Alsa befitted the pur
pose of the Little Theatre: em
phasis on acting. But, as I say.
this was dress rehearsal. A lot
always happens from then to per
formance. Go see it. It's fun.
But hurry: it closes tonight.
The final performance of "No
Trifling With Love," will be to
night at 8:30 in the Little Thea
tre. Tickets will be sold at the
door, $1.00 general admission and
75 cents for students.
A private audience saw the dress rehearsal of Musset's "No
Trifling With Love," performed by the Stanford Players Monday
night. Applaud those who appreciated it: not from ihe production
end entirely — for Mussel, oh, Musset. The playwright got himself
into an old trap. The first act was a sparkling farce. The second act

was a philosophical debate. - 1
So he needed a terribly tedious
third act to work out the compli
cations of the debate and mould
the farce with it for the ultimate
tragedy it becomes. In the second
act, he drives his characters to
the edge of a cliff, they are about
to fall . . . when, 10, some god out
of the blue builds a bridge for
them to the other side of the
gulf. No doubt a tricky thing.
THE WOMAN (Camille) has
returned from a nunnery to ren
le/.vous with her uncle's son (Per
dican), who has just completed
no less than four doctorates. The
Woman of the Cloister brings her
ideas of love against those of the
Man of the World. Perdican liter
ally devastates the monastic sys
tem and we libertines in the au
dience cheer. The nun, who does
not want to trifle with a deceit

nimcompoop philanderer, then
the all-knowing savant of th e
world. Perdican is kind of a self
contained ping pong match. In
between is Mr. Wilson trying to
decide how to act him.
Jane House plays Camille very
tragically, as indeed Musset did

not write her. It's known as "en
larging one's role." It's not Miss
House's fault. Her dilemmas are
silly to begin with. The death of
the foster sister is the result of
her own deeeitfulncss. But she
blames everything on Perdican
anyway. Miss House dominates
the scenes with Wilson, partly
because Masset's Perdican is so
confused, and partly because Mr.
Wilson's is too.
I BELIEVE, however, that
when one cries on stage, one
makes them real tears. Anna
Munro as the shy foster sister
Rosette is delicate, but so much
so that it's hard to hear her some
times, even in the Little Theatre.
Linda Bishop as Dame Plunche is
very farcical. She shrieks an d
squeaks well enough, but I won
der really why Musset put her
in the play.
Lee Projector was a strange
chorus. He did not do it too well
nor was it written very well for
him. Bruce Salvatore as the Tu
tor and Larry Madison as the
Priest are good examples of
French farce. Musset skillfully
satirizes the clergy with them.
But again play and player di d
not come together. Salvatore is
still Osric of two weeks ago.
Madison is very good, but occa
sionally loses all contact with
the audience, very vital for an
actor.
CONRAD BISHOP as Perdi
ean's father the Baron is dynamic.
He shakes with old age very
rhythmically and hypnotizes you
very well with it. He has some
brilliant (some not so) moments
and I recommend his performance
along with Madison. Lars Kamp
mann with his ten lines enlarges
his part to the nth degree . . .
and he does it well.
The light cues designed by
Peter Young were not always co
ordinated and on time. The sets
by Terry Alsa befitted the pur
pose of the Little Theatre: em
phasis on acting. But, as I say.
this was dress rehearsal. A lot
always happens from then to per
formance. Go see it. It's fun.
But hurry: it closes tonight.
The final performance of "No
Trifling With Love," will be to
night at 8:30 in the Little Thea
tre. Tickets will be sold at the
door, $1.00 general admission and
75 cents for students.
A private audience saw the dress rehearsal of Musset's "No
Trifling With Love," performed by the Stanford Players Monday
night. Applaud those who appreciated it: not from ihe production
end entirely — for Mussel, oh, Musset. The playwright got himself
into an old trap. The first act was a sparkling farce. The second act

was a philosophical debate. - 1
So he needed a terribly tedious
third act to work out the compli
cations of the debate and mould
the farce with it for the ultimate
tragedy it becomes. In the second
act, he drives his characters to
the edge of a cliff, they are about
to fall . . . when, 10, some god out
of the blue builds a bridge for
them to the other side of the
gulf. No doubt a tricky thing.
THE WOMAN (Camille) has
returned from a nunnery to ren
le/.vous with her uncle's son (Per
dican), who has just completed
no less than four doctorates. The
Woman of the Cloister brings her
ideas of love against those of the
Man of the World. Perdican liter
ally devastates the monastic sys
tem and we libertines in the au
dience cheer. The nun, who does
not want to trifle with a deceit
ful love, who only wants a love
that is "the real thing," is then
seemingly convinced that the
whole monastic system is im
moral!
The rest is complex. Camille
tried to deceive Perdican in order
to test him. He discovers what
she is doing, so he deceives her
by deceiving her deception. He
makes love (with mere words,
readers) to Camille's foster sis
ter in front of Camille and pro
poses. The foster sister falls in
love. Camille has flunked the test.
She rescinds in a trembling em
brace before the altar of a church.
The foster sister sees who Perdi
can really loves and dies. Camille
says farewell to him, his mouth
falls open in horror, and the cur
tain falls.
HJIM. Musset pulls the old
O'Henry twist and seems to say
that even when you don't trifle
with love, it's useless anyway. Is
that true?
Now: Director Michael Addi
son was as confused as I was in
trying to see whether it was-a
farce or tragedy. But look what
Musset gave him. Dale Wilson
as Perdican is faced with a role
that first makes him out to be a

world. Perdican is kind of a self
