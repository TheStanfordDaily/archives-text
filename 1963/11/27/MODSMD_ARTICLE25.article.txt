# Dummett Says U.S. Education More Liberal than England's
## 
### NORM HIRSCH 
According to Professor Michael
Dummett, visiting professor in
philosophy for the autumn quar
ter from All Souls College at Ox
ford. English secondary school
students are better prepared for
college, but American college
students work harder.
Dummett is teaching a course
this quarter on realism and a
seminar on Frege. He is a fel
low at AH Souls College and a
reader there in the philosophy of
mathematics.
IN COMPARING American to
Critish students in an interview
with TliÂ«' Daily, Dummett said
British students are very reserved
in class, and he enjoys the liveli
ness of American students in dis
cussion.
In one sense Dummett prefers
the educational system of Stan
ford to that of Oxford because it
is so much more liberal. There is
little room for change in Ihe Ox
ford curriculum: the instructors
are forced to teach toward th e
set University examinations. Any
change in the course material
must first be approved by th e

whole department.
Although Oxford is divided into
some thirty colleges, the whole
University must institute a new
course. Seldom can enough inter
est be generated in any small col
lege to bring about a major
change. Thus, there was no psy
chology department at Oxford un
til 1920; a sociology department
there is just beginning.
ACCORDING TO Dummett,
however, our educational system
often does not stimulate enough
creativity. Students at Oxford
write more papers, and the
straight tutorial system stimu
lates thought. It is assumed in
England that high school stu
dents acquire an adequate factual
knowledge.
But Dummett explained that
this system can be disadvantage
ous. Few lectures are given, and
few students attend them because
they are considered only an extra
part of the course. These lectures
are important, for Dummett feels
Ihat students do not have an ade
quate factual knowledge. He sug
gests that the tutorial system
should be integrated with the lec
ture system, much like it is in
the Stanford philosophy depart
ment.
