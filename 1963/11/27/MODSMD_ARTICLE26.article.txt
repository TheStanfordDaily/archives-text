# Dartmouth, Yale Hurt NSA Prestige By Resignation
## 
### CARLETON W. STERLING 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a reprint from the
Columbia Spectator of Novem
ber 15. This is the second in
their series; dealing with Na
tional Student Association.)
Two Ivy League schools, Yale
and Dartmouth, dropped their
affiliations with the National
student Association this week.
This is not necessarily a trend,
since NSA's history has been
marked by student governments
constantly dropping out of the
national organization and rejoin
ing at a later time. The loss of
Yale and Dartmouth in one week,
however, does hurt NSA's pres
tige.
One reason advanced by the
Yale Senior Advisory Board for
disafilliation was NSA's failure
"top do anything for Yale." The
"failure" of NSA to contribute
anything to a campus, however,
is susually the result of anemic
student government activity on
that campus. Vigorous student
governments, however, generally
avail themselves of NSA services.
NSA, through its regional or
ganizations, also sponsor confer
ences on various subjects of stu
dent interest. In this area, a con
ference to discuss the problems
of Negro ghettos in the North
will be held today and tomorrow
at Manhattan College.
One of the recurring arguments
for schools to remain affiliated
is that NSA is Ihc "voice" of
American students. To disaffiliate
would cause a school to lose its
right to help decide how NSA
speaks.
When Yale student government
voted to disaffiliate they argued
that NSA's claim as spokesman
for all American students was
"erroneous." Yale's position is
basically fallacious. It is true that
more than half of all American
colleges and universities are not
affiliated with NSA, but most of
the major institutions are. It is
also a tenable argument to de
clare that NSA ought not to claim
to speak for American students,
but it now does. Therefore, dis
afilliation merely bars a student
government from advancing its
views on how NSA should oper
ate.
No one seriously believes that
what NSA proclaims as policy is
necessarily the opinion of all
American students or even most
of them. Nevertheless, NSA is
called on to speak as the body
most representative of American
students.

however, does hurt NSA's pres
tige.
One reason advanced by the
Yale Senior Advisory Board for
disafilliation was NSA's failure
"top do anything for Yale." The
"failure" of NSA to contribute
anything to a campus, however,
is susually the result of anemic
student government activity on
that campus. Vigorous student
governments, however, generally
avail themselves of NSA services.
NSA, through its regional or
ganizations, also sponsor confer
ences on various subjects of stu
dent interest. In this area, a con
ference to discuss the problems
of Negro ghettos in the North
will be held today and tomorrow
at Manhattan College.
One of the recurring arguments
for schools to remain affiliated
is that NSA is Ihc "voice" of
American students. To disaffiliate
would cause a school to lose its
right to help decide how NSA
speaks.
When Yale student government
voted to disaffiliate they argued
that NSA's claim as spokesman
for all American students was
"erroneous." Yale's position is
basically fallacious. It is true that
more than half of all American
colleges and universities are not
affiliated with NSA, but most of
the major institutions are. It is
also a tenable argument to de
clare that NSA ought not to claim
to speak for American students,
but it now does. Therefore, dis
afilliation merely bars a student
government from advancing its
views on how NSA should oper
ate.
No one seriously believes that
what NSA proclaims as policy is
necessarily the opinion of all
American students or even most
of them. Nevertheless, NSA is
called on to speak as the body
most representative of American
students.

Two Ivy League schools, Yale
and Dartmouth, dropped their
affiliations with the National
student Association this week.
This is not necessarily a trend,
since NSA's history has been
marked by student governments
constantly dropping out of the
national organization and rejoin
ing at a later time. The loss of
Yale and Dartmouth in one week,
however, does hurt NSA's pres
tige.
