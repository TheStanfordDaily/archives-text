### JUSTIN BECK Sports Editor 
That one week postponement in
Big Game probably is going to
make a big difference in this
year's clash wit h California.
Hopefully last week's ailing In
dians will bo healthy by Satur
day's season finale in the Stan
ford Stadium.
Halfback Steve Thurlow, the
Tribe's principal offensive weap
on, was injured against Washing
ton State and wasn't expected to
start against Cal. But with that

KZSU, at MO, will broadcast
the play-by-play of the Big
Game between Stanford and Cal
beginning at 1:15 p.m. Satur
day. Neil Ornmnd will do the
play-by-play.

extra week to recover from his
leg injury, he figures to be a cer
tain starter, yesterday playing in
a full speed scrimmage for the
first time since his injury.
CLARK WEAVER, the Big
Game's hero last year in direct
ing a 30-13 win, was also -con
sidered not recovered from an
operation for a knee injury that
had sidelined him for almost two
months.
While he still hasn't seen any
action in practice, it's possible
that he may get more than a
token shot at the quarterback

spot Saturday.
OTHERWISE the Indians figure
to he unchanged from the ball
club that was favored by one
point last week, except that Ibis
week they're two point favorites.
But with Thurlow healthy, and
Weaver possibly available for
part-time duty, Stanford's chances
figure to have improved some
thing more than that.
