# THE 						FAITH WHICH SAVES
## 
### 
Christian faith is not the acceptance of certain historical facts and doctrines, but
trusting in a Person, and that Person is Jesus Christ. Faith is abandoning all re
liance on nwn's one resources and casting oneself without reservation on the mercy
of (lod. To have faith is to lay hold of tin- promises of Cod in Christ, relying on
the finished work of Cod in Christ for salvation and the power of the indwelling
Hoi) Spirit for daily strength. I'aith implies complete reliance on Cod and obedience
to Him. Christian faith is as relevant to Cod's world of the twentieth century as
it was to His World of two thousand years ago.
Man has many substitutes for faith. Everyone believes in something, and puts
his trust, conscious!) or unconsciously, in the "laws" of nature, his own resources,
or the philosophies of his contemporaries. Helicfs which are centered in the wisdom
of men always leave one wondering if there i- something more to life a plan, a
prupose, an intelligence greater than our own at work behind the scenes. Questions
of our own uniqueness, the mystery of birth and the fear of death linger in our
minds unless we are anchored to a faith in the living Cod. When trouble strikes,
man's bravado vanishes in a moment and he quickly reveals how helpless he is
without God.
"Cursed he the man that trustcth in man, and maketh flesh his arm. and whose heart
departeth from the Lord." Jer. 17:5.
''He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool; hut who so walketh wisely, he shall
be delivered." I'rov. 2N:2(>.
Many think of Christian faith as a philosophy of living which needs constant revision
and up-dating, They fail to reali2e that faith is a process whereby any sinful, way
ward man can become reconciled to His Creator, and transformed into His image.
After being saved by faith, the Christian then grows ami lives by faith, experienc
ing when he docs so an increasing closeness to Cod.
"The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my Cod, my strength, in
whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and mv high tower."
Ps. 18:2.
One acquires faith by learning about Cod, His promises. His conditions and His
ways from the Holy Scriptures and then acting on the promises of Cod which are
declared:
"We conclude that faith is awakened by the message, and the message that awakens
it comes through the word of Christ." Rom. 10:17. When Christian faith is put
to the test it invariably "works!"
When a person puts his trust, in sincere humility, in Jesus Christ, God always
responds in a real and unmistakable way:
"Atid you too. when you had heard the message of truth, the good news of your
salvation, and had believed it, became incorporated in Christ and received the seal
of the promised Holy Spirit; and that Spirit is the pledge that we shall enter upon
our heritage, when God has redeemed what i- his own. to his praise and glory."
Eph. 1:13 XE.
To call on the name of William Shakespeare or Ralph Waldo Emerson for help and
salvation is of no avail; to trust and depend on the "faith of our fathers" without
a decision for Christ is empt) faith, to rely on the wisdom of theologians is to
have misplaced faith which never works. To trust in Christ, to accept Him and to
call on Hi-- name is to draw from the very source springs of life itself.
"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. the first and the last . . .
And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take of the water
of life freely." Rev. 22:1.1, 17. NK.
"There is no salvation in anyone else at all. for there is no other name under heaven
granted to men, by which we may receive salvation." Acts 4:12.
Is your faith properly placed in the Person of Jesus Christ, the living God? If it is
you'll have no doubts about His reality and your own destiny. If not, consider the
claims of Christ and his promises offered free of charge to all who come to Him.
Test" Christian faith and see for yourself. You'll'never be sorry.

of (lod. To have faith is to lay hold of tin- promises of Cod in Christ, relying on
the finished work of Cod in Christ for salvation and the power of the indwelling

to Him. Christian faith is as relevant to Cod's world of the twentieth century as
it was to His World of two thousand years ago.
Man has many substitutes for faith. Everyone believes in something, and puts
his trust, conscious!) or unconsciously, in the "laws" of nature, his own resources,
or the philosophies of his contemporaries. Helicfs which are centered in the wisdom
of men always leave one wondering if there i- something more to life a plan, a
prupose, an intelligence greater than our own at work behind the scenes. Questions
of our own uniqueness, the mystery of birth and the fear of death linger in our
minds unless we are anchored to a faith in the living Cod. When trouble strikes,
man's bravado vanishes in a moment and he quickly reveals how helpless he is
without God.

Christian faith is not the acceptance of certain historical facts and doctrines, but
trusting in a Person, and that Person is Jesus Christ. Faith is abandoning all re
liance on nwn's one resources and casting oneself without reservation on the mercy
of (lod. To have faith is to lay hold of tin- promises of Cod in Christ, relying on
the finished work of Cod in Christ for salvation and the power of the indwelling
Hoi) Spirit for daily strength. I'aith implies complete reliance on Cod and obedience
to Him. Christian faith is as relevant to Cod's world of the twentieth century as
it was to His World of two thousand years ago.
Man has many substitutes for faith. Everyone believes in something, and puts
his trust, conscious!) or unconsciously, in the "laws" of nature, his own resources,
or the philosophies of his contemporaries. Helicfs which are centered in the wisdom
of men always leave one wondering if there i- something more to life a plan, a
prupose, an intelligence greater than our own at work behind the scenes. Questions
of our own uniqueness, the mystery of birth and the fear of death linger in our
minds unless we are anchored to a faith in the living Cod. When trouble strikes,
man's bravado vanishes in a moment and he quickly reveals how helpless he is
without God.
"Cursed he the man that trustcth in man, and maketh flesh his arm. and whose heart
departeth from the Lord." Jer. 17:5.
''He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool; hut who so walketh wisely, he shall
be delivered." I'rov. 2N:2(>.
Many think of Christian faith as a philosophy of living which needs constant revision
and up-dating, They fail to reali2e that faith is a process whereby any sinful, way
ward man can become reconciled to His Creator, and transformed into His image.
After being saved by faith, the Christian then grows ami lives by faith, experienc
ing when he docs so an increasing closeness to Cod.
"The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my Cod, my strength, in
whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and mv high tower."
Ps. 18:2.
One acquires faith by learning about Cod, His promises. His conditions and His
ways from the Holy Scriptures and then acting on the promises of Cod which are
declared:

it comes through the word of Christ." Rom. 10:17. When Christian faith is put
