The aims of I he? newly formed
Student Faculty Liason Commit
tee were described to the school*
of-engineering faculty yesterday
at the quarterly faculty meeting.
The committee, which consists of
four professors and four stu
dents, attended a two week Fac
ulty-Student Conference on Engi
neering Education held at Bethel,
Maine, last June.
The objectives of the Confer
ence, which was also attended by
representatives from Case, Dart
month, and MIT, were the devel
opment of an understanding of
relationships between faculty and
students, and the application of
this understanding to ihe im
provement of engineering educa
tion.
Till; COMMITTEE will try to
apply the knowledge gained at
the conference to the situation on
the Stanford campus. During the
academic year the committee con
venes as needed and carries out
its functions through discussion
involving the free interchange of
ideas and feelings among its
members, with faculty and stu
dents on an equal basis.
It will encourage and evaluate
teaching-learning innovations; im
prove student and faculty moti
vation; consider specific recom
mendations, complaints, or com
mendations received from engi
neering students or faculty mem
bers; and recommend improve
ments when appropriate.
All interested persons are uryed
to contact one of the committee
members, who are: Civil Engi
neering—Professor John K. Ven
nard, and Lawrence B. Gooch;
Mechanical Engineering Assist
ant Professor Joel Ferziger and
Jesse Robinson, Jr.; Materials
Science Assistant Professor Wil
liam D. Nix and Tom A. Taylor;
