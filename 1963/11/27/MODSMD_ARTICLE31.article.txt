### TOM ELIAS 
The nation's cross-country sea
son came to an end yesterday in
East Lansing, Michigan, as San
Jose Slate's Spartans ran off with
their second straight NCAA
crown, scoring only 53 points to
Oregon's 6<S.
Stanford was to have sent two
men to compete in that meet,
Weym Kirkland and Harry Mc-
Calla, but the confusion of the
last weekend led to the cancella
tion of their trip.
STANFORD C OACH .Payton
Jordan indicated yesterday after
noon that he felt that had they
made the trip, Kirkland and Mc-
Calla, outstanding performers for
the Tribe all fall, could have
made a good showing, perhaps
finishing in the top ten.
But Jordan was not despondent
over Stanford's lack of represen
tation, saying, "We'll just have
to go all out next spring to make
up for it."
AS FAR AS this season was
concerned, Jordan was partic
ularly pleased that ihe Indians
had made their bcM showings fin
the last three meets of the sea
son.
These, he said, show that the
team utilized its potential effec
tively. He continued to laud the
squad's constant good spirit and
effort all through the season.
Individually, McCalla was the
leader all through the season.
Kirkland, after a slow start (he
did not even run in the first
meet) came on very strong to
challenge McCalla for the team
leadership, beating him in the
final two meets of the year.
