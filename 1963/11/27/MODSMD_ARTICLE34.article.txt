# OUT OF NCAP PLAYOFFS
## Surprise Ruling Stuns Soccer Squad 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
The strong Stanford soccer
, team's hopes for NCAA compe
-1 tion were smashed abruptly over
the weekend in a series of quick
! unexpected and somewhat bizarre
i rulings which totally surprised
I the soÂ« cermen, and disqualified
] ihem from further action this
year.
The Indians had been sched
uled to meet the San Francisco
Rangers in the NCAA regionals
last Saturday, but, as most other
| contests over the weekend, it was
postponed to Tuesday, Nov. 2(5.
i However, the Far Western Soccer
| Selection Committee board mem
j bers got together during this span
and decided that three of the
Card's players were ineligible
depriving the Stanford team of
ja right to participate in iho
NCAA competition.
THE RULINC; seemed to stem
1 from the difference in eligibility
| requirements between the Ama
; teur Athletic Association of West
ern Universities (AAWU) and the
National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation (NCAA) concerning for
| eign students. The Tribe players
declared ineligible were A 1 Nnoli,
| Larry Chuckwedebe, and Kammel
i Kadi.
In the past, the Nor-Cal soccer
conference has abided by AAWU
rules which are somewhat more
liberal than those of the NCAA.
When, then, it came time for a
j Nor-Cal conference member to
I participate in the N'CAA eompe
! tition, the players regarded as
j ineligible, according to NCAA,
would be dropped. Thus, Cal has
been allowed in years past to en
ter the quarterfinals even though
they have won the championship
with "ineligibles."
SOMETIME after Saturday and
before Monday of last weekend,
the board reversed this precedent.
Thus, the play-off will be in
: stead between San Jose and the
' University of San Francisco, both
I of which have been beaten by the
| Indians in league competition.

The Far Western Select ion
Committee decided after a week
end of conference that perhaps
Stanford would not have beaten
the other contenders without the
players regarded by NCAA rules
as ineligible. And so decided that
they should change their minds
arbitrarily and rule out the con
ference champion Indians.
The ruling came as a shock to
the players when they reported
to practice Monday. There had
been some optimism about the
Tribe's chances in national play
this year, even though they knew
that some of the foreign starters

would ho ineligible.
TIIIS WAS an added blow be
cause the squad didn't originally
think they would have to even
play in the regional* againsl USF.
Usually tho team which wins the
Nor-Cal crown is assured nf a
berth in the quarterfinals.
This year, however, things were
arranged differently because the
Air Force dropped out of the
tourney, leaving a vacancy which
western soccer officials decided
to resolve by the playoff system
which was conceived, and event
ually changed to exclude Stanford
titlists.
