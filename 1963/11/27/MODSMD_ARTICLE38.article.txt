# I-Center to Lead Vacation Activity
## 
### 
The Bechtel International Cen
ter hopes to become tlie focus of
campus attention during the
Christmas holidays. All students
who will be left behind during
vacation are invited to use the
center's facilities, day and eve
ning. An extensive program of
daily events has been planned,
and it is hoped that anyone with
ideas for ihe three week period
will call the Center. Mrs. Warren,
ext. 4182. will receive any calls.
The International Center is also
sponsoring a program for finding
homes for foreign students dur
ing the holidays. The Christmas
holidays are often a lonely time
for our foreign students, and any
help will be gratefully appreci
ated. Any students living in the
Palo Alto area especially are
asked for cooperation.
