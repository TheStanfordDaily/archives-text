# TUES. EVE. SERIES:
## Organization of Medical Care Necessary in Modern Times 
### ELIZABETH FREEMAN 
With the modern concepts of men of dignity and equality of
rights, widespread and equitable health provisions are today ex
pected, said Dr. Cecil Shops, Visiting Professor at the Stanford Medi
cal School, in his Tuesday Evening Series speech on "Meeting the
Health Service Needs of Tomorrow."
Recent widespread scrutiny of medical care in the United States
has loft many satisfied with medi-f-

cal technology, but concerned
with the practical application of
this knowledge and provisions
for the distribution of medical
care, stated Dr. Sheps.
THE RECENT EXPLOSION of
knowledge in the medical field
lias caused changes and upsets
in the medical world, and in
creased specialization of medical
people, he said; organization is a
necessary correlary to specializa
tion.
Because of earlier medical pro
gress, chronic diseases are now
the big problem. Care of the
chronically ill involves a form of
treatment different from earlier
days, when patients generally
either died or had acute illnesses.
The extended care of chronic dis
eases requires additional team
members as well as the physi
cian, such as nurses and social
workers.
PHYSICIANS are increasingly
becoming part of organized medi
cal groups, he said - the "lone
rugged individual physician" is
decreasing. Medical expenditures
can best be faced with the pooled
and flexible resources of the gov
ernment, he felt, since sudden
medical costs often hit the in
dividual in an uneven and irregu
lar manner.
Research in the field of medical
care is important, he concluded,
although the institution of new
methods of care and management
is often a difficult process.
Today the community must be
come responsible for personal
health services, he said.
