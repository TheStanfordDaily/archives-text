# Cal Sororities Ignore Clause
## 
### 
Only six out of the University
of California's 21 Sororities have
signed the non-discrimination
clause proposed by the President's
Office, reports UC President
Clark Kerr, who admits that the
situation is "starting to get diffi
cult."
By contrast, only eight of tho
forty-eight fraternities have failed
to comply with the requirement,
which must be fulfilled by next
September. Sororities who do not
meet the deadline will lose ap
proved housing status.
That the Board of Regents is
adamant in its decision not to
extend the deadline was empha
sized by Kerr who noted that non
complying groups will be denied
the use of the University name
which he terms "a pretty pre
cious possession which we don't
want used in any form of discrim
ination."
Kerr, who feels that national
headquarters of the fraternities
and sororities are exerting the
greatest pressure against the
pledge, stressed that alumni can
continue to help select members
as long as they do not attempt to
impose discrimination. University
policy would not restrict free
choice of new members except in
consideration of race or religion.
It was noted that some Univer
sity chapters have succeeded in
changing national policies at the
national conventions while others
have been granted local option,
allowing them to sign the pledge.
