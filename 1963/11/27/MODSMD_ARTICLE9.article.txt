WASHINGTON A presidential arbitration board ruled yester
day that 90 per cent of the firemen's jobs on freight trains and yard
engines eventually should be eliminated because their duties can be
handled by other members of the crew. But tho board made clear
that its attrition plan would work gradually and displace only a
"comparatively small" number of the 40,000 railroad firemen during
the two years it will be binding on carriers and unions. Two unions
immediately announced they would fight the decision in federal
court on grounds that the seven-man panel exceeded its authority
I under the arbitration law rushed through Congress last August.
I The ruling takes effect Jan. 23 unless modified by the courts.
