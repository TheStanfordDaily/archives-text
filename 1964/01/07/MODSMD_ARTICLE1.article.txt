# Moser Replaces Whitaker As English Executive Head
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD 
Thomas Moser, 40-year-old asso
ciate professor of English, is the
new executive head of the English
Department, President Wallace
S t erli n g announced yesteday.
Moser succeeds Professor Virgil
K. Whitaker, who last month was
named associate provost and dean
of the Graduate Division after
serving as executive head of the
English Department since 19151.
Moser came to Stanford in
1956 after taking his doctorate at
Harvard University and teaching
at Wellesley College. "Although
I found teaching all girl classes
enjoyable, 1 prefer teaching mixed
classes and graduate courses and
neither of those opportunities was
offered at Wellesley," he ex
plained.
AT "THE FARM," Moser served
as director of Freshman English
for three years, as faculty ad-

viser to "Sequoia," the campus
literary magazine, and as a reg
ular member on various Univer
sity and departmental committees.
Moser has just returned to the
campus after an absence of 18
months. In 1962, he taught French
and English fiction at the over
seas campus in Tours, France, to
both France V and VI. He spent
the rest of last year in England,
on an American Council of
Learned Societies fellowship,
studying Ford Madox Ford. Cur
rently, he is writing a book, a
critical study of Ford's works.
THE BOOK on Ford will be
Moser's third. Previously, he has
published numerous articles on
his special field — English and
American fiction of the 19th and
20th centuries—as well as two
books — W r ut h eri ng Heights:
Texts, Sources, Criticism, and
Joseph Conrad: Achievement and
Decline.
When faced with the inevitable
question of the conflict between
an administrative post and acad
emic work, Moser commented,

"Does it take time? Does it pre
vent one from publishing? It
does." Why did he accept the po
sition? "I did it because people
i I admire in the Department asked
> me to do it, and because I knew
the job had to be done."
