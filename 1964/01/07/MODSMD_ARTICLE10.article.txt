# Bars Prosper but Don't Swing as in Past

Whether the migration begins
with a throaty " 'dolf's down," or
an " 'O' call" reverberating
through the stairwell of a frater
nity, or simply with a "let's kiss
off and grab a beer"from a rest
less roommate, numerous Stan
ford students put their books
aside between the hours of 11 and
12 p.m. to find their way to one
of four or five drinking estab
lishments in the area.
The phenomenon, which is per
haps best described as an alcoholic
coffee break, has become so wide
spread among undergraduate and
graduate students alike that the
"O," the "B." "Zotts," "Rat's,"
and "'dolf's" are as much a part
of tlie Stanford experience as are
"Mem Chu," "Dink Aud," and
"Fun Stan."
FOR i;\A>irij;, George Souza
in his fourteen years as owner
of "Rat's" figures he has served
students from every Stanford liv
ing group. "The 'Rat's'," says
George, "even gets some girls
from them girl fraternities."
Bernic Tougus, part owner of
the "Oasis," which is more often
called the "O," describes the pop
ularity of his place in numbers:
three hundred-odd hamburgers
sold daily, four full-time and five
narl-time barlenclors employed lo

keep up with the business. In
addition lo having a large student
clientele, the "O," unlike other
places frequented by students, at
tracts several faculty members.
Bernie likes to tell how he used
to serve Alexander Kerensky,
leader of the March 1917 Russian
Revolution. "He and that Polish
Count friend of his would come
in every day and order two dark
and two burgers."
ALTHOUGH the idea of mix
ing students and alcohol might
seem to many a potentially vola
tile situation perpetrating con
siderable disorder, bartenders are
the first to admit that they have i
had remarkably little trouble with |
students. John Alexander, part j
owner of the Alpine Beer Garden
(popularly known as "Zott's") re
minisces with something ap
proaching a tone of melancholy
in his voice, "We haven't had a
good fight around here in years."
George Sou/a of the "Rat's"
puts it another way: "The boys
have always had respect for me
and I've always had respect for
them. I like to think that this
business is more than sellin'
booze; it's a personal thing with
me. These guys are my friends."
IN ADDITION to being friends,
most of the local publicans find j
that students are also business I
assets. As Sou/a points out, "Stu
dents are happier; they don't com- !
' plain. People like bavin' 'em 1

around." Thus, unknowingly, stu
dents serve as drawing cards for
the places they frequent.
The result has been that by
American standards the bars have
witnessed unusual conglomera
tions of people. An admirer of the
"Oasis" once labelled it a "joint
for beatniks and bankers." Al
though the dichotomy may be a
bit extreme, there is a live pos
sibility that a beat and a banker
may have had beer drawn from
the same keg.
STUDENT BEHAVIOR isn't
the only change that bartenders
have noticed recently in Stanford
students. "They book more," says
the "Rat's" Sou/a whose sentences
are just as broken as the nose
smudged down the middle of his
face. Further, George and bis fel
low publicans agree that because
students "book more," they have
become more conservative drink
ers.
For the most part, the days of
the twelve-hour drinking bout are
gone. A beer break has become
just that a break before getting
back to tin? books or turning in.
A more serious attitude among
this generation of students may
go a long way in explaining an
inscription that has been gouged
in the paneling of the "O" 's well
whittled woodwork. It reads:
"This place don't swing like it
used to, An Old Grad."
ALTHOUGH the grad is prob

ably light, students still manage
to "swing," often with chaotic
irregularity. Harry Alfinito, one
of four brothers who own "Ru
dolfo's" Cdolf's), notes that his
student business picks up mark
edly during "dead week." Harry,
whose place is named after the
Rudolfo in Puccini's La Boheme,
attributes the increase to the stu
dents' need to relax after periods
of harder and longer studying; a
fad that might also explain why
student business often "peaks" in
the middle of the week.
It would seem that what a stu
dent looks for in a drinking place
is distraction, something to take
his mind off his studies. 11' noth
ing else, the Stanford drinking es
tablishments brim with distract
tion. Pin-ball machines, television
machines, jukebox machines, and
of course, people: all combine to
sponge the last thoughts of
studies from the corners of the
student's mind.
NKVKKTIIKLESS, there are
those few who try to buck the
system, the rare species that show
up with book in hand hoping to
squeeze Plato, Weber, or Kafka
between a burger and a beer. Per
haps they are pointing the way
for future generations of Stan
ford students and perhaps one
day an "Old Grad of '64 will reach
into his pocket for his jaekknife
i with thoughts of "this place don't
l m\\ im r like il use to."
