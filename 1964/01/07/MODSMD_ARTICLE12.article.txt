# New Undergrad Post Promising, Secretive
## 
### 
The formation of the post of Dean of Undergraduate Edu
cation and the appointment of Robert Wert to fill it is a prom
ising event. Dr. Wert is a man with a long and high-level asso
ciation with the Stanford administration. Presumably this will
mean that he will be granted a good degree of independence
in his new post, that he will be able to give definitive answers
to questions dealing with the vast area under him, that he
will be free to experiment with the ideas that are certain to
be a product of the creation of an office dealing solely with
undergraduate education.
One can only speculate upon the Dean's role, however,
not only because the post is a new one but more importantly
because its arrival was preceded by a total lack of public
information. Since the beginning of the school year ASSU
officers and members of the Daily Staff have been asking
questions about this new position, having gathered last year
that its formation was imminent. At all points, the students
were told that the plans were most tentative, that it would
not be presented to the Trustees for quite a while. Over a
two year period a committee which included some of our
finest faculty members worked on plans for the new position.
Few people—perhaps not even the committee members them
selves—know how much of their report has been adopted as
operating principle. When the committee disbanded last quar
ter it was said that plans were still quite tentative. And six
hours before the final Daily of last quarter came off the press,
the position was announced, in full existence as of the begin
ning of this quarter.
It would seem, given the nature of an academic commu
nity, that public discussion as plans were being made would
have been profitable, discussion that would have permitted a
broad range of faculty and students to add to the creative
process.
The procedure here is not surprising; it is the expected
mode of Stanford operation. And this is what is regrettable.
