# Moser Selection Hailed
## 
### 
Professor Thomas Moser is heartily welcomed into his new
position of Executive Head of the English Department. Be
yond his high level of scholarly work, Dr. Moser comes to his
position with an approach and commitment to teaching that
any student can be cheered by in a man in an administrative
role.
Two years ago the English Department initiated a bold
and creative honors program for elected majors which, among
other advantages, permits them to have a full quarter senior
year for reading without classwork. This program was the
product of several of the outstanding professors who char
acterized the Department, but the chairman can certainly
be a strong influence in sparking such ideas and putting them
into practice. Take a faculty of the academic quality of the
English Department who can evolve something such as the
English Honors program, top it off with Thomas Moser as
department head, and one can forsee nothing but good for
Stanford.
