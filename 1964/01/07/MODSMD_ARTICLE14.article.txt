BIG GAME
Editor, The Daily:
For the second time this fall I
am writing to extend my con
gratulations and compliments to
the student body. This time on
th e i r performance at the Big
Game of November 30th.
The behavior of the rooters was
extraordinary and the card stunts
excellent and enthusiastically
common ted on by all those who
saw them. My only wish was that
all 85,000 people in the Stadium
could have seen this magnificent
display. The performance of the
Stanford Band — pre-game and at
half time was again outstanding.
On that day t he Big Game w a s
won not only by the Stanford
team but also by the students,
rooters and the Band whose pre
sentation of the National An
them's new arrangement was
even more impressive at the Big
Game than at the Notre Dame
game.
Knowing full well the difficult
circumstances under which all
these preparations were made,
the many uncertainties and trying

moments that faced all the man
agers and program organizers, it
. seems to me they responded with
thoughtfulness, courtesy, intelli
gently and in good taste. It was
1 a job well done.
Again all of us in th e Athletic
Department wish to express our
sincere thanks and appreciation
; to Mike McCardle, the Band Man
-1 ager, Jim Smith, the Student Di
rector, Art Barnes, Band Director.
1 and all band members for their
wonderful cooperation. Congratu
lations also to Ed Kaiser and his
committees'for the organization
' of the card stunts and wonderful
display. The yell leaders, pompon
girls and Timm Williams also
; deserve a tremendous pat on the
back.
There is no question that the
Stanford student body and rooters
on Big Game day established
themselves as the finest support
group that the Athletic Depart
ment or any athletic team could
desire. They truly exemplified
the real Stanford spirit.
