SOUTH AFRIC AN
GOVERNMENT vs. THE DAILY
Editor, The Daily:
Permit me to refer to the re
port "South African Government
Increases Prosecution of Stu
dents" in your isue of Novem
ber 22nd, 1963.
The article gives a distinct im
pression that the National Union
of South African Students is rep
resentative of student opinion in
South Africa. This, of course, is
not the case and the views of
NUSAS and of its President, John
Driver, is at best only a sectional
view. There is another major stu
dent organization in South Africa
(Die Afrikaanse Studentebond)
which represents more students
than NUSAS. For the record I
think your readers should know
that they hold opposite views to
that of NUSAS; support the Gov
ernment's policy and will prob
ably refute any allegation that
the Government is prosecuting
students simply because they, dis
agree with State policy. The bulk
of South African newspapers
could also be labled as "dissent
ers" and the entire opposition
United Party are dissenters in
fact. To be consistent, the Gov
ernment should therefore "prose
cute" all these dissenters!
If students were actually ar
rested for "acts of terror" then I
do not believe any person will ob
ject to their prosecution under the
law of the country. I do not wish
to attempt a detailed analysis of
your report which presents an
image of South Africa which is
not only misleading but also in
accurate. Permit me 1o make use
of only one example.
According to you the clause in
the General Law Amendment Act
of 19G2, headed "Sabotage" reads:
"to further or encourage the
achievement of any political aim,
including the bringing about of
any social or economic change in
the Republic."
This is of course correct but,
you have omitted the most perti
nent part of the Act which reads
as follows:
"No person shall be convicted
of an offence under Sub-section 1
of the Act if he proves that the
commission of the alleged offence,
objectively regarded, was not
calculated and that such offence
was not committed with the in
tent to . . ."
Here the Act lists several objec
tives, including the clause which
you quoted.
It is .therefore, clear that "Sub
section 1" governs the clause
quoted. Your report ignored this
fact. Sub-section 1 states, inter
alia, that any person who com
mits an act whereby he injures,
damages, destroys, contaminates,
etc., the health of the public (e.g..
water supplies), the movement, of
traffic, the supply of water, the
safety of the public, etc., etc.,
"shall be guilty of the offence of
sabotage . .
It is a simple matter to con
clude from this section that a per
son who,,for example, dynamites
a school or post office, poisons
the water supply of a city, etc., is
guilty of an act of sabotage. Thus,
you are forbidden by law to "fur
ther or encourage the achieve
ment of any political aim . .
by such means as dynamiting of
schools, derailment of trains,
blowing up of dams, poisoning of
water, etc. This we know is the
rule of law in any civilized coun
try.
An act of State cannot be
judged by any single clause such
its you have done. To do so is mis
leading in the extreme. The only
people who fear this Act are the
terrorists, murderers of innocent
women and children, the commu
nists and their henchmen — the
saboteurs - who carry out their
objective which, as you know, is
to create chaos and disorder in a
stable capitalist society.
I wish to recommend, there
fore, that Mr. Bud Wedin, Presi
dent of the ASSU, should not
base his comments only on the
views of NUSAS but, also obtain
the opinion of other organizations
in South Africa. His statement
that NUSAS had been the one in
stitution opposing the Govern
ment is inaccurate. As in any
counlry with a two-party system,
there are many organizations and
institutions opposing the policy of
of the Government in power, in
the same way as I here are many
institutions opposing the policy
porting the Government in power.

SYRACUSE ADMINISTRATION
Editor, The Daily:
A couple of weeks ago, before
our attention was so tragically
diverted to less local matters, a
column appeared in the Daily
which chonicled the actions of
the Syracuse University admin
istration following the participa
tion of students and faculty in a
CORE demonstration. Apparently
based upon extracts from a letter
written by an ex-Stanford under

graduate who had transferred to
Syracuse, this piece included the
startling information that the
Syracuse administration ha d
"taken action" against faculty
members who had participated in
the demonstration, and also indi
cated that the deans there had
gone back on their word in plac
ing participating students on dis
ciplinary probation after their
arrest by city police. The accounl
concluded lhat though we have
occasional complaints against the
policies of the Stanford adminis
tration, we are at least well off
compared to those in other insti
tutions.
As a former member of the
Syracuse faculty, I naturally felt
some alarm over the apparent
fate of my old friends and col
leagues. Immediately, therefore,
I clipped this little epic of self
congratulation and mailed it to
a fellow biologist at Syracuse
who, it turns out, was an active
participant in the demonstrations.
His reply—far from being a plea
for funds or job offers— sug
gests the presence of some inac
curacies in the Daily's account.
Let me correct these:
(1). Approximately fifty stu
dents were arrested in the demon
strations. No action was taken
against them by the University;
they were not put on any sort of
probation. Apparently disturbed
by the level of civil difficulty the
students were getting into, the
University subsequently an
nounced that any further arrests
woidd result in disciplinary pro
bation for the student involved.
One student was subsequently ar
rested (the demonstrations were
on the decline for other reasons),
and he was put on disciplinary
probation. It should be noted that
this action, at Syracuse, is a pre
liminary one and does not imply
additional penalties. There was
strong faculty protest, and the
Chancellor met this in a forth
right way in a meeting with the
faculty. After the furor died
down, the probation was removed.
I think there were undeniable
errors in this procedure; but they
owed more to lack of coordina
tion within the administration
than to a repressive policy.
(2). The Chancellor stated pub
licly that he welcomed the increas
ing concern of the involved stu
dents with social issues.
(3). No action has been taken
against any faculty member who
participated in CORE demonstra
tions.
While this account hardly indi
cates that we should eulogize the
Syracuse administration for its
liberalism, it does not suggest
that we need shower their captive
students and professors with sym
pathy, either. Invidious compari
sons are in any case a singularly
unprofitable use of literary en
ergy—especially when they are
unadorned with fact.

Young Americans for Freedom
is the most responsible, effective,
energic conservative youth group
in the United States. The vital
work that these young people are
doing is without a doubt the most
encouraging sign on the American
political scene today.
At the present time Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF)
has over 300 chapters and 25,000
members. Last year YAF reached
over 400,000 young people through
the sponsorship of lectures, de
bates, rallies, films, chapter meet
ings, artd activities. , >
.Recently the National Board of
Directors in a two-day meeting in
Washington, D.C., set a goal of
starting YAF chapters on 1,000
college and university campuses
by November 1964.
The prospect of patriotic anti
communist youth groups on 1,000
college campuses is truly an in
spiring and heart-warming
thought. I am convinced that if
we are to be successful in defeat
ing atheistic communion it will
have to be done by the young
people. A YAF chapter will pre
pare a young man or woman for
the struggle ahead with liberal
ism, socialism, and communism.
In making addresses on various
campuses across the country I
have been impressed with the de
cided difference in the atmosphere
where YAF chapters are in exis
tence.
YAF is in urgent need of imme
diate financial support. If each
person receiving this letter were
to send these young people a con
tribution, it would enable them to
establish chapters on not 1.000
campuses but on every college
and university campus (over
2,000) in the country and in thous
ands of high schools. The cause
of freedom will be strengthened
by your support of this great or
ganization which has such worthy
goals.

I wish to recommend, there

base his comments only on the
views of NUSAS but, also obtain
the opinion of other organizations
in South Africa. His statement
that NUSAS had been the one in

there are many organizations and

institutions opposing the policy
porting the Government in power.

SYRACUSE ADMINISTRATION
Editor, The Daily:
A couple of weeks ago, before
our attention was so tragically
diverted to less local matters, a
column appeared in the Daily
which chonicled the actions of
the Syracuse University admin
istration following the participa
tion of students and faculty in a
CORE demonstration. Apparently
based upon extracts from a letter
written by an ex-Stanford under

graduate who had transferred to
Syracuse, this piece included the
startling information that the
Syracuse administration ha d
"taken action" against faculty
members who had participated in
the demonstration, and also indi
cated that the deans there had
gone back on their word in plac
ing participating students on dis
ciplinary probation after their
arrest by city police. The accounl
concluded lhat though we have
occasional complaints against the
policies of the Stanford adminis
tration, we are at least well off
compared to those in other insti
tutions.
As a former member of the
Syracuse faculty, I naturally felt
some alarm over the apparent
fate of my old friends and col
leagues. Immediately, therefore,
I clipped this little epic of self
congratulation and mailed it to
a fellow biologist at Syracuse
who, it turns out, was an active
participant in the demonstrations.
His reply—far from being a plea
for funds or job offers— sug
gests the presence of some inac
curacies in the Daily's account.
Let me correct these:
(1). Approximately fifty stu
dents were arrested in the demon
strations. No action was taken
against them by the University;
they were not put on any sort of
probation. Apparently disturbed
by the level of civil difficulty the
students were getting into, the
University subsequently an
nounced that any further arrests
woidd result in disciplinary pro
bation for the student involved.
One student was subsequently ar
rested (the demonstrations were
on the decline for other reasons),
and he was put on disciplinary
probation. It should be noted that
this action, at Syracuse, is a pre
liminary one and does not imply
additional penalties. There was
strong faculty protest, and the
Chancellor met this in a forth
right way in a meeting with the
faculty. After the furor died
down, the probation was removed.
I think there were undeniable
errors in this procedure; but they
owed more to lack of coordina
tion within the administration
than to a repressive policy.
(2). The Chancellor stated pub
licly that he welcomed the increas
ing concern of the involved stu
dents with social issues.
(3). No action has been taken
against any faculty member who
participated in CORE demonstra
tions.
While this account hardly indi
cates that we should eulogize the
Syracuse administration for its
liberalism, it does not suggest
that we need shower their captive
students and professors with sym
pathy, either. Invidious compari
sons are in any case a singularly
unprofitable use of literary en
ergy—especially when they are
unadorned with fact.

Young Americans for Freedom
is the most responsible, effective,
energic conservative youth group
in the United States. The vital
work that these young people are
doing is without a doubt the most
encouraging sign on the American
political scene today.
At the present time Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF)
has over 300 chapters and 25,000
members. Last year YAF reached
over 400,000 young people through
the sponsorship of lectures, de
bates, rallies, films, chapter meet
ings, artd activities. , >
.Recently the National Board of
Directors in a two-day meeting in
Washington, D.C., set a goal of
starting YAF chapters on 1,000
college and university campuses
by November 1964.
The prospect of patriotic anti
communist youth groups on 1,000
college campuses is truly an in
spiring and heart-warming
thought. I am convinced that if
we are to be successful in defeat
ing atheistic communion it will
have to be done by the young
people. A YAF chapter will pre
pare a young man or woman for
the struggle ahead with liberal
ism, socialism, and communism.
In making addresses on various
campuses across the country I
have been impressed with the de
cided difference in the atmosphere
where YAF chapters are in exis
tence.
YAF is in urgent need of imme
diate financial support. If each
person receiving this letter were
to send these young people a con
tribution, it would enable them to
establish chapters on not 1.000
campuses but on every college
and university campus (over
2,000) in the country and in thous
ands of high schools. The cause
of freedom will be strengthened
by your support of this great or

SOUTH AFRIC AN
GOVERNMENT vs. THE DAILY
Editor, The Daily:
Permit me to refer to the re
port "South African Government
Increases Prosecution of Stu
dents" in your isue of Novem
ber 22nd, 1963.
The article gives a distinct im
pression that the National Union
of South African Students is rep
resentative of student opinion in
South Africa. This, of course, is
not the case and the views of
NUSAS and of its President, John
Driver, is at best only a sectional
view. There is another major stu
dent organization in South Africa
(Die Afrikaanse Studentebond)
which represents more students
than NUSAS. For the record I
think your readers should know
that they hold opposite views to
that of NUSAS; support the Gov
ernment's policy and will prob
ably refute any allegation that
the Government is prosecuting
students simply because they, dis
agree with State policy. The bulk
of South African newspapers
could also be labled as "dissent
ers" and the entire opposition
United Party are dissenters in
fact. To be consistent, the Gov
ernment should therefore "prose
cute" all these dissenters!
If students were actually ar
rested for "acts of terror" then I
do not believe any person will ob
ject to their prosecution under the
law of the country. I do not wish
to attempt a detailed analysis of
your report which presents an
image of South Africa which is
not only misleading but also in
accurate. Permit me 1o make use
of only one example.
According to you the clause in
the General Law Amendment Act
of 19G2, headed "Sabotage" reads:
"to further or encourage the
achievement of any political aim,
including the bringing about of
any social or economic change in
the Republic."
This is of course correct but,
you have omitted the most perti
nent part of the Act which reads
as follows:
"No person shall be convicted
of an offence under Sub-section 1
of the Act if he proves that the
commission of the alleged offence,
objectively regarded, was not
calculated and that such offence
was not committed with the in
tent to . . ."
Here the Act lists several objec
tives, including the clause which
you quoted.
It is .therefore, clear that "Sub
section 1" governs the clause
quoted. Your report ignored this
fact. Sub-section 1 states, inter
alia, that any person who com
mits an act whereby he injures,
damages, destroys, contaminates,
etc., the health of the public (e.g..
water supplies), the movement, of
traffic, the supply of water, the
safety of the public, etc., etc.,
"shall be guilty of the offence of
sabotage . .
It is a simple matter to con
clude from this section that a per
son who,,for example, dynamites
a school or post office, poisons
the water supply of a city, etc., is
guilty of an act of sabotage. Thus,
you are forbidden by law to "fur
ther or encourage the achieve
ment of any political aim . .
by such means as dynamiting of
schools, derailment of trains,
blowing up of dams, poisoning of
water, etc. This we know is the
rule of law in any civilized coun
try.
An act of State cannot be
judged by any single clause such
its you have done. To do so is mis
leading in the extreme. The only
people who fear this Act are the
terrorists, murderers of innocent
women and children, the commu
nists and their henchmen — the
saboteurs - who carry out their
objective which, as you know, is
to create chaos and disorder in a
stable capitalist society.
I wish to recommend, there

Young Americans for Freedom
is the most responsible, effective,
energic conservative youth group
in the United States. The vital
work that these young people are
doing is without a doubt the most
encouraging sign on the American
political scene today.
At the present time Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF)
has over 300 chapters and 25,000
members. Last year YAF reached
over 400,000 young people through
the sponsorship of lectures, de
bates, rallies, films, chapter meet
ings, artd activities. , >
.Recently the National Board of
Directors in a two-day meeting in
Washington, D.C., set a goal of
starting YAF chapters on 1,000
college and university campuses
by November 1964.
The prospect of patriotic anti
communist youth groups on 1,000
college campuses is truly an in
spiring and heart-warming
thought. I am convinced that if
we are to be successful in defeat
ing atheistic communion it will
have to be done by the young
people. A YAF chapter will pre
pare a young man or woman for
the struggle ahead with liberal
ism, socialism, and communism.
In making addresses on various
campuses across the country I
have been impressed with the de
cided difference in the atmosphere
where YAF chapters are in exis
tence.
YAF is in urgent need of imme
diate financial support. If each
person receiving this letter were
to send these young people a con
tribution, it would enable them to
establish chapters on not 1.000
campuses but on every college
and university campus (over
2,000) in the country and in thous
ands of high schools. The cause
of freedom will be strengthened
by your support of this great or
ganization which has such worthy
goals.

SOUTH AFRIC AN
GOVERNMENT vs. THE DAILY
Editor, The Daily:
Permit me to refer to the re
port "South African Government
Increases Prosecution of Stu
dents" in your isue of Novem
ber 22nd, 1963.
The article gives a distinct im
pression that the National Union
of South African Students is rep
resentative of student opinion in
South Africa. This, of course, is
not the case and the views of
NUSAS and of its President, John
Driver, is at best only a sectional
view. There is another major stu
dent organization in South Africa
(Die Afrikaanse Studentebond)
which represents more students
than NUSAS. For the record I
think your readers should know
that they hold opposite views to
that of NUSAS; support the Gov
ernment's policy and will prob
ably refute any allegation that
the Government is prosecuting
students simply because they, dis
agree with State policy. The bulk
of South African newspapers
could also be labled as "dissent
ers" and the entire opposition
United Party are dissenters in
fact. To be consistent, the Gov
ernment should therefore "prose
cute" all these dissenters!
If students were actually ar
rested for "acts of terror" then I
do not believe any person will ob
ject to their prosecution under the
law of the country. I do not wish
to attempt a detailed analysis of
your report which presents an
image of South Africa which is
not only misleading but also in
accurate. Permit me 1o make use
of only one example.
According to you the clause in
the General Law Amendment Act
of 19G2, headed "Sabotage" reads:
"to further or encourage the
achievement of any political aim,
including the bringing about of
any social or economic change in
the Republic."
This is of course correct but,
you have omitted the most perti
nent part of the Act which reads
as follows:
"No person shall be convicted
of an offence under Sub-section 1
of the Act if he proves that the
commission of the alleged offence,
objectively regarded, was not
calculated and that such offence
was not committed with the in
tent to . . ."
Here the Act lists several objec
tives, including the clause which
you quoted.
It is .therefore, clear that "Sub
section 1" governs the clause
quoted. Your report ignored this
fact. Sub-section 1 states, inter
alia, that any person who com
mits an act whereby he injures,
damages, destroys, contaminates,
etc., the health of the public (e.g..
water supplies), the movement, of
traffic, the supply of water, the
safety of the public, etc., etc.,
"shall be guilty of the offence of
sabotage . .
It is a simple matter to con
clude from this section that a per
son who,,for example, dynamites
a school or post office, poisons
the water supply of a city, etc., is
guilty of an act of sabotage. Thus,
you are forbidden by law to "fur
ther or encourage the achieve
ment of any political aim . .
by such means as dynamiting of
schools, derailment of trains,
blowing up of dams, poisoning of
water, etc. This we know is the
rule of law in any civilized coun
try.
An act of State cannot be
judged by any single clause such
its you have done. To do so is mis
leading in the extreme. The only
people who fear this Act are the
terrorists, murderers of innocent
women and children, the commu
nists and their henchmen — the
saboteurs - who carry out their
objective which, as you know, is
to create chaos and disorder in a
stable capitalist society.
I wish to recommend, there
fore, that Mr. Bud Wedin, Presi
dent of the ASSU, should not
base his comments only on the
views of NUSAS but, also obtain
the opinion of other organizations
in South Africa. His statement
that NUSAS had been the one in
stitution opposing the Govern
ment is inaccurate. As in any
counlry with a two-party system,
there are many organizations and
institutions opposing the policy of
of the Government in power, in
the same way as I here are many
institutions opposing the policy
porting the Government in power.

SYRACUSE ADMINISTRATION
Editor, The Daily:
A couple of weeks ago, before
our attention was so tragically
diverted to less local matters, a
column appeared in the Daily
which chonicled the actions of
the Syracuse University admin
istration following the participa
tion of students and faculty in a
CORE demonstration. Apparently
based upon extracts from a letter
written by an ex-Stanford under

graduate who had transferred to
Syracuse, this piece included the
startling information that the
Syracuse administration ha d
"taken action" against faculty
members who had participated in
the demonstration, and also indi
cated that the deans there had
gone back on their word in plac
ing participating students on dis
ciplinary probation after their
arrest by city police. The accounl
concluded lhat though we have
occasional complaints against the
policies of the Stanford adminis
tration, we are at least well off
compared to those in other insti
tutions.
As a former member of the
Syracuse faculty, I naturally felt
some alarm over the apparent
fate of my old friends and col
leagues. Immediately, therefore,
I clipped this little epic of self
congratulation and mailed it to
a fellow biologist at Syracuse
who, it turns out, was an active
participant in the demonstrations.
His reply—far from being a plea
for funds or job offers— sug
gests the presence of some inac
curacies in the Daily's account.
Let me correct these:
(1). Approximately fifty stu
dents were arrested in the demon
strations. No action was taken
against them by the University;
they were not put on any sort of
probation. Apparently disturbed
by the level of civil difficulty the
students were getting into, the
University subsequently an
nounced that any further arrests
woidd result in disciplinary pro
bation for the student involved.
One student was subsequently ar
rested (the demonstrations were
on the decline for other reasons),
and he was put on disciplinary
probation. It should be noted that
this action, at Syracuse, is a pre
liminary one and does not imply
additional penalties. There was
strong faculty protest, and the
Chancellor met this in a forth
right way in a meeting with the
faculty. After the furor died
down, the probation was removed.
I think there were undeniable
errors in this procedure; but they
owed more to lack of coordina
tion within the administration
than to a repressive policy.
(2). The Chancellor stated pub
licly that he welcomed the increas
ing concern of the involved stu
dents with social issues.
(3). No action has been taken
against any faculty member who
participated in CORE demonstra
tions.
While this account hardly indi
cates that we should eulogize the
Syracuse administration for its
liberalism, it does not suggest
that we need shower their captive
students and professors with sym
pathy, either. Invidious compari
sons are in any case a singularly

ject to their prosecution under the
law of the country. I do not wish
to attempt a detailed analysis of
your report which presents an
image of South Africa which is
not only misleading but also in
accurate. Permit me 1o make use
of only one example.
According to you the clause in
the General Law Amendment Act
of 19G2, headed "Sabotage" reads:
"to further or encourage the
achievement of any political aim,
including the bringing about of
any social or economic change in
the Republic."
This is of course correct but,
you have omitted the most perti
nent part of the Act which reads
as follows:
"No person shall be convicted
of an offence under Sub-section 1
of the Act if he proves that the
commission of the alleged offence,
objectively regarded, was not
calculated and that such offence
was not committed with the in
tent to . . ."
Here the Act lists several objec
tives, including the clause which
you quoted.
It is .therefore, clear that "Sub
section 1" governs the clause
quoted. Your report ignored this
fact. Sub-section 1 states, inter
alia, that any person who com
mits an act whereby he injures,
damages, destroys, contaminates,
etc., the health of the public (e.g..
water supplies), the movement, of
traffic, the supply of water, the
safety of the public, etc., etc.,
"shall be guilty of the offence of
sabotage . .
It is a simple matter to con
clude from this section that a per
son who,,for example, dynamites
a school or post office, poisons
the water supply of a city, etc., is
guilty of an act of sabotage. Thus,
you are forbidden by law to "fur
ther or encourage the achieve
ment of any political aim . .
by such means as dynamiting of
schools, derailment of trains,
blowing up of dams, poisoning of
water, etc. This we know is the
rule of law in any civilized coun
try.
An act of State cannot be
judged by any single clause such
its you have done. To do so is mis
leading in the extreme. The only
people who fear this Act are the
terrorists, murderers of innocent
women and children, the commu
nists and their henchmen — the
saboteurs - who carry out their
objective which, as you know, is
to create chaos and disorder in a
stable capitalist society.
I wish to recommend, there
fore, that Mr. Bud Wedin, Presi
dent of the ASSU, should not
base his comments only on the
views of NUSAS but, also obtain
the opinion of other organizations
in South Africa. His statement
that NUSAS had been the one in
stitution opposing the Govern
ment is inaccurate. As in any
counlry with a two-party system,
there are many organizations and
institutions opposing the policy of
of the Government in power, in
the same way as I here are many
institutions opposing the policy
porting the Government in power.

SYRACUSE ADMINISTRATION
Editor, The Daily:
A couple of weeks ago, before
our attention was so tragically
diverted to less local matters, a
column appeared in the Daily
which chonicled the actions of
the Syracuse University admin
istration following the participa
tion of students and faculty in a
CORE demonstration. Apparently
based upon extracts from a letter
written by an ex-Stanford under

graduate who had transferred to
Syracuse, this piece included the
startling information that the
Syracuse administration ha d
"taken action" against faculty
members who had participated in
the demonstration, and also indi
cated that the deans there had
gone back on their word in plac
ing participating students on dis
ciplinary probation after their
arrest by city police. The accounl
concluded lhat though we have
occasional complaints against the
policies of the Stanford adminis
tration, we are at least well off
compared to those in other insti
tutions.
As a former member of the
Syracuse faculty, I naturally felt
some alarm over the apparent
fate of my old friends and col
leagues. Immediately, therefore,
I clipped this little epic of self
congratulation and mailed it to
a fellow biologist at Syracuse
who, it turns out, was an active
participant in the demonstrations.
His reply—far from being a plea
for funds or job offers— sug
gests the presence of some inac
curacies in the Daily's account.
Let me correct these:
(1). Approximately fifty stu
dents were arrested in the demon
strations. No action was taken
against them by the University;
they were not put on any sort of
probation. Apparently disturbed
by the level of civil difficulty the
students were getting into, the
University subsequently an
nounced that any further arrests
woidd result in disciplinary pro
bation for the student involved.
One student was subsequently ar
rested (the demonstrations were
on the decline for other reasons),
and he was put on disciplinary
probation. It should be noted that
this action, at Syracuse, is a pre
liminary one and does not imply
additional penalties. There was
strong faculty protest, and the
Chancellor met this in a forth
right way in a meeting with the
faculty. After the furor died
down, the probation was removed.
I think there were undeniable
errors in this procedure; but they
owed more to lack of coordina
tion within the administration
than to a repressive policy.
(2). The Chancellor stated pub
licly that he welcomed the increas
ing concern of the involved stu
dents with social issues.
(3). No action has been taken
against any faculty member who
participated in CORE demonstra
tions.
While this account hardly indi
cates that we should eulogize the
Syracuse administration for its
liberalism, it does not suggest
that we need shower their captive
students and professors with sym
pathy, either. Invidious compari
sons are in any case a singularly
unprofitable use of literary en
ergy—especially when they are
unadorned with fact.

Young Americans for Freedom
is the most responsible, effective,
energic conservative youth group
in the United States. The vital
work that these young people are
doing is without a doubt the most
encouraging sign on the American
political scene today.
At the present time Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF)
has over 300 chapters and 25,000
members. Last year YAF reached
over 400,000 young people through
the sponsorship of lectures, de
bates, rallies, films, chapter meet
ings, artd activities. , >
.Recently the National Board of
Directors in a two-day meeting in
Washington, D.C., set a goal of
starting YAF chapters on 1,000
college and university campuses
by November 1964.
The prospect of patriotic anti
communist youth groups on 1,000
college campuses is truly an in
spiring and heart-warming
thought. I am convinced that if
we are to be successful in defeat
ing atheistic communion it will
have to be done by the young
people. A YAF chapter will pre
pare a young man or woman for
the struggle ahead with liberal
ism, socialism, and communism.
In making addresses on various
campuses across the country I
have been impressed with the de
cided difference in the atmosphere
where YAF chapters are in exis
tence.
YAF is in urgent need of imme
diate financial support. If each
person receiving this letter were
to send these young people a con
tribution, it would enable them to
establish chapters on not 1.000
campuses but on every college
and university campus (over

of freedom will be strengthened
by your support of this great or

SOUTH AFRIC AN
GOVERNMENT vs. THE DAILY
Editor, The Daily:
Permit me to refer to the re
port "South African Government
Increases Prosecution of Stu
dents" in your isue of Novem
ber 22nd, 1963.
The article gives a distinct im
pression that the National Union
of South African Students is rep
resentative of student opinion in
South Africa. This, of course, is
not the case and the views of
NUSAS and of its President, John
Driver, is at best only a sectional
view. There is another major stu
dent organization in South Africa
(Die Afrikaanse Studentebond)
which represents more students
than NUSAS. For the record I
think your readers should know
that they hold opposite views to
that of NUSAS; support the Gov
ernment's policy and will prob
ably refute any allegation that
the Government is prosecuting
students simply because they, dis
agree with State policy. The bulk
of South African newspapers
could also be labled as "dissent
ers" and the entire opposition
United Party are dissenters in
fact. To be consistent, the Gov
ernment should therefore "prose
cute" all these dissenters!
If students were actually ar
rested for "acts of terror" then I
do not believe any person will ob
ject to their prosecution under the
law of the country. I do not wish
to attempt a detailed analysis of

startling information that the
Syracuse administration ha d
"taken action" against faculty
members who had participated in
the demonstration, and also indi
cated that the deans there had
gone back on their word in plac
ing participating students on dis
ciplinary probation after their
arrest by city police. The accounl
concluded lhat though we have
occasional complaints against the
policies of the Stanford adminis
tration, we are at least well off
compared to those in other insti
tutions.
As a former member of the
Syracuse faculty, I naturally felt
some alarm over the apparent
fate of my old friends and col
leagues. Immediately, therefore,
I clipped this little epic of self
congratulation and mailed it to
a fellow biologist at Syracuse
who, it turns out, was an active
participant in the demonstrations.
His reply—far from being a plea
for funds or job offers— sug
gests the presence of some inac
curacies in the Daily's account.
Let me correct these:
(1). Approximately fifty stu
dents were arrested in the demon
strations. No action was taken
against them by the University;
they were not put on any sort of
probation. Apparently disturbed
by the level of civil difficulty the
students were getting into, the
University subsequently an
nounced that any further arrests
woidd result in disciplinary pro
bation for the student involved.
One student was subsequently ar
rested (the demonstrations were
on the decline for other reasons),
and he was put on disciplinary
probation. It should be noted that
this action, at Syracuse, is a pre
liminary one and does not imply
additional penalties. There was
strong faculty protest, and the
Chancellor met this in a forth
right way in a meeting with the
faculty. After the furor died
down, the probation was removed.
I think there were undeniable
errors in this procedure; but they
owed more to lack of coordina
tion within the administration
than to a repressive policy.
(2). The Chancellor stated pub
licly that he welcomed the increas
ing concern of the involved stu
dents with social issues.
(3). No action has been taken
against any faculty member who
participated in CORE demonstra
tions.
While this account hardly indi
cates that we should eulogize the
Syracuse administration for its
liberalism, it does not suggest
that we need shower their captive
students and professors with sym
pathy, either. Invidious compari
sons are in any case a singularly
unprofitable use of literary en
ergy—especially when they are
unadorned with fact.

Young Americans for Freedom
is the most responsible, effective,
energic conservative youth group
in the United States. The vital
work that these young people are
doing is without a doubt the most
encouraging sign on the American
political scene today.
At the present time Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF)
has over 300 chapters and 25,000
members. Last year YAF reached
over 400,000 young people through
the sponsorship of lectures, de
bates, rallies, films, chapter meet
ings, artd activities. , >
.Recently the National Board of
Directors in a two-day meeting in
Washington, D.C., set a goal of
starting YAF chapters on 1,000
college and university campuses
by November 1964.
The prospect of patriotic anti
communist youth groups on 1,000
college campuses is truly an in
spiring and heart-warming
thought. I am convinced that if
we are to be successful in defeat
ing atheistic communion it will
have to be done by the young
people. A YAF chapter will pre
pare a young man or woman for
the struggle ahead with liberal
ism, socialism, and communism.
In making addresses on various
campuses across the country I
have been impressed with the de
cided difference in the atmosphere
where YAF chapters are in exis
tence.
YAF is in urgent need of imme
diate financial support. If each
person receiving this letter were
to send these young people a con
tribution, it would enable them to
establish chapters on not 1.000
campuses but on every college
and university campus (over
2,000) in the country and in thous
ands of high schools. The cause
of freedom will be strengthened
by your support of this great or
ganization which has such worthy
goals.

SOUTH AFRIC AN
GOVERNMENT vs. THE DAILY
Editor, The Daily:
Permit me to refer to the re
port "South African Government
Increases Prosecution of Stu
dents" in your isue of Novem
ber 22nd, 1963.
The article gives a distinct im
pression that the National Union
of South African Students is rep
resentative of student opinion in
South Africa. This, of course, is
not the case and the views of
NUSAS and of its President, John
Driver, is at best only a sectional
view. There is another major stu
dent organization in South Africa
(Die Afrikaanse Studentebond)
which represents more students
than NUSAS. For the record I
think your readers should know
that they hold opposite views to
that of NUSAS; support the Gov
ernment's policy and will prob
ably refute any allegation that
the Government is prosecuting
students simply because they, dis
agree with State policy. The bulk
of South African newspapers
could also be labled as "dissent
ers" and the entire opposition
United Party are dissenters in
fact. To be consistent, the Gov
ernment should therefore "prose
cute" all these dissenters!
If students were actually ar
rested for "acts of terror" then I
do not believe any person will ob
ject to their prosecution under the
law of the country. I do not wish
to attempt a detailed analysis of
your report which presents an
image of South Africa which is
not only misleading but also in
accurate. Permit me 1o make use
of only one example.
According to you the clause in
the General Law Amendment Act
of 19G2, headed "Sabotage" reads:
"to further or encourage the
achievement of any political aim,
including the bringing about of
any social or economic change in
the Republic."
This is of course correct but,
you have omitted the most perti
nent part of the Act which reads
as follows:
"No person shall be convicted
of an offence under Sub-section 1
of the Act if he proves that the
commission of the alleged offence,
objectively regarded, was not
calculated and that such offence
was not committed with the in
tent to . . ."
Here the Act lists several objec
tives, including the clause which
you quoted.
It is .therefore, clear that "Sub
section 1" governs the clause
quoted. Your report ignored this
fact. Sub-section 1 states, inter
alia, that any person who com
mits an act whereby he injures,
damages, destroys, contaminates,
etc., the health of the public (e.g..
water supplies), the movement, of
traffic, the supply of water, the
safety of the public, etc., etc.,
"shall be guilty of the offence of
sabotage . .
It is a simple matter to con
clude from this section that a per
son who,,for example, dynamites
a school or post office, poisons
the water supply of a city, etc., is
guilty of an act of sabotage. Thus,
you are forbidden by law to "fur
ther or encourage the achieve
ment of any political aim . .
by such means as dynamiting of
schools, derailment of trains,
blowing up of dams, poisoning of
water, etc. This we know is the
rule of law in any civilized coun
try.
An act of State cannot be
judged by any single clause such
its you have done. To do so is mis
leading in the extreme. The only
people who fear this Act are the
terrorists, murderers of innocent
women and children, the commu
nists and their henchmen — the
saboteurs - who carry out their
objective which, as you know, is
to create chaos and disorder in a
stable capitalist society.
I wish to recommend, there
fore, that Mr. Bud Wedin, Presi
dent of the ASSU, should not
base his comments only on the
views of NUSAS but, also obtain
the opinion of other organizations
in South Africa. His statement
that NUSAS had been the one in
stitution opposing the Govern
ment is inaccurate. As in any
counlry with a two-party system,
there are many organizations and
institutions opposing the policy of
of the Government in power, in
the same way as I here are many
institutions opposing the policy
porting the Government in power.

SYRACUSE ADMINISTRATION
Editor, The Daily:
A couple of weeks ago, before
our attention was so tragically
diverted to less local matters, a
column appeared in the Daily
which chonicled the actions of
the Syracuse University admin
istration following the participa
tion of students and faculty in a
CORE demonstration. Apparently
based upon extracts from a letter
written by an ex-Stanford under

graduate who had transferred to
Syracuse, this piece included the
startling information that the
Syracuse administration ha d
"taken action" against faculty
members who had participated in
the demonstration, and also indi
cated that the deans there had
gone back on their word in plac
ing participating students on dis
ciplinary probation after their
