1964: YEAR OF DECISION
ell >ir, here we go into 1904, which shows every sign of being
quite a distinguished year. First off, it is the only year since
19f>4 which cuds with the Figure 4. Of course, when it comes
to Figure 4's, 1904, though distinguished, can hardly compare
with t f44 which, most people agree, had not just one, not just
two, hut three Figure 4's! This, I'll wager, is a record that will
stand for at least a thousand years!
1 144 was, incidentally, notable for many other things. It
was, for example, the year in which the New York (Hants
played the Philadelphia Athletics in the World Scries. As we
all know, the New York (Jiants have since moved to San Fran
cisco and the Philadelphia Athletics to Kansas City. There is
a movement afoot at present to move Chicago to Phoenix—
the city, not the baseball team. Phoenix, in turn, would of
course move to Chicago. It is felt that the change would be
broadening for residents of both cities. Many Chicago folks,
for example, have never seen an iguana. Many Phoenix folks,
on the other hand, have never seen a frostbite.

There are, of course, certain difficulties connected with a
municipal shift of this size. For instance, to move Chicago
you also have to move L:ike Michigan. This, in itself, presents
no great problem, what with modern scientific advances like
electronics and the French cuff. But if you will look at your
map, you will find Lake Michigan is attached to all the other
(Ireat Lakes, which in turn are attached to the St. Lawrence
Seaway, which in turn is attached to the Atlantic Ocean. You
start dragging Lake Michigan to Phoenix and, willy-nilly, you'll
be dragging all that other stuff too. This would make our
British allies terribly cross, and I can't say as 1 blame them.
Put yourself in tlieir place. What if, for example, you were a
Mritish costerinonger who had been saving and scrimping ;ill
year for a summer holiday at Brighton Beach, and then when
you got to Brighton Beach there wasn't any ocean? There you'd
be with your inner tube and snorkel and nothing to do all day
but dance the Lambeth Walk. This, you must agree, would not
help make you NATO-minded!
I appeal most earnestly to the residents of Chicago and
Phoenix to reconsider. 1 know it's no bowl of cherries going
through life without ever seeing an iguana or a frostbite, but
I a-k you—Cliicagoans, Phoenicians—is it too big a price to
pay for preserving the unity of the free world?
I feel ,-ure that if you search your hearts, you will make the
rinlit decision, for all of us—whether we live in frostbitten

1964: YEAR OF DECISION
ell >ir, here we go into 1904, which shows every sign of being
quite a distinguished year. First off, it is the only year since
19f>4 which cuds with the Figure 4. Of course, when it comes
to Figure 4's, 1904, though distinguished, can hardly compare
with t f44 which, most people agree, had not just one, not just
two, hut three Figure 4's! This, I'll wager, is a record that will
stand for at least a thousand years!
1 144 was, incidentally, notable for many other things. It
was, for example, the year in which the New York (Hants
played the Philadelphia Athletics in the World Scries. As we
all know, the New York (Jiants have since moved to San Fran
cisco and the Philadelphia Athletics to Kansas City. There is
a movement afoot at present to move Chicago to Phoenix—
the city, not the baseball team. Phoenix, in turn, would of
course move to Chicago. It is felt that the change would be
broadening for residents of both cities. Many Chicago folks,
for example, have never seen an iguana. Many Phoenix folks,
on the other hand, have never seen a frostbite.

There are, of course, certain difficulties connected with a
municipal shift of this size. For instance, to move Chicago
you also have to move L:ike Michigan. This, in itself, presents
no great problem, what with modern scientific advances like
electronics and the French cuff. But if you will look at your
map, you will find Lake Michigan is attached to all the other
(Ireat Lakes, which in turn are attached to the St. Lawrence
Seaway, which in turn is attached to the Atlantic Ocean. You
start dragging Lake Michigan to Phoenix and, willy-nilly, you'll
be dragging all that other stuff too. This would make our
British allies terribly cross, and I can't say as 1 blame them.
Put yourself in tlieir place. What if, for example, you were a
Mritish costerinonger who had been saving and scrimping ;ill
year for a summer holiday at Brighton Beach, and then when
you got to Brighton Beach there wasn't any ocean? There you'd
be with your inner tube and snorkel and nothing to do all day
but dance the Lambeth Walk. This, you must agree, would not
help make you NATO-minded!
I appeal most earnestly to the residents of Chicago and
Phoenix to reconsider. 1 know it's no bowl of cherries going
through life without ever seeing an iguana or a frostbite, but
I a-k you—Cliicagoans, Phoenicians—is it too big a price to
pay for preserving the unity of the free world?
I feel ,-ure that if you search your hearts, you will make the
rinlit decision, for all of us—whether we live in frostbitten
