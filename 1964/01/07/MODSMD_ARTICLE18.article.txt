# South African Government Renews Attacks on Students
## 
### 
(IIYA) The National Union of
South African Students (NUSAS)
has been under heavy attack for
the last three months from the
South African Government, its
| security police, and even tlie Gov
ernment-controlled South African
I Broadcasting Corporation.
NUSAS has been attacked by
the Government many times be
fore. The student union's policies
of non-discrimination, its accep
tance of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, and its opposi
tion to discriminatory and oppres
sive legislation enforced by the
white minority Government, have
been a thorn in the side of the
forces of apartheid. These attacks
have become even more vicious
during the last two months. Some
observers have seen in them a
prelude to the outright banning
of NUSAS.
The Minister of Justice, Johan
nes Balthazar Vorster, began the
attacks in lato August when he
threatened direct action against
NUSAS. He followed this up in
mid-September with a statement
in which lie said: "NUSAS has
become the mouthpiece of liberal
ists in South Africa and the
mouthpiece of Communists."
"I don't say that every member
of NUSAS is a Communist, but
every Communist has been a
member of NUSAS. ... It is time
that something must be done . . .
(NUSAS is) a cancer in the life
of South Africa which must be
cut out."
This was followed by further
i attacks on NUSAS by the Sou th

African Broadcasting Corporation
and the pro-apartheid press.
NUSAS fought hack with a series
of public statements in which it
asked Vorster to furnish proof
that NUSAS was controlled by
Communists.
The statements insisted that
NUSAS was neither Communist
nor anti-Communisl, but that Vor
ster branded every anti-apartheid
movement "Communist
VORSTER once again charged
that NUSAS was "unpatriotic, d
cidedly left, and tainted with com
munism." He said that the charge
was "conclusively proved" by
seven "facts."
These were < 1» that certain
known Communists had been
members of NUSAS in the past ;
(2) that NUSAS had "persistently
protested against all action taken
against Communists in South
Africa"; (3) that it had cooper
ated with other African national
unions of students such as those
in "Ghana, Algeria, Ethiopia, in
fact all Addis Ababa Conference
countries"; (4) that it had cooper
ated with UFHS i the United Fed
erations of Hungarian Students,
comprising students exiled since
the 1956 revolt > and PKPPTM
(National Union of Malayan Stu
dents); (5) that it subscribed to
the doctrine of "one man one
vote"; (6) that NUSAS had been
a member of the. International
Union of Students i'IUS) from
1945 to 1954; (7) that it had
elected Chief Albert Luthuli
Honorary President. This last
"charge" was meant to show that
NUSAS was "closely" associated
with the banned African National
Congress of which Chief Luthuli
had been President.
Vorster called on NUSAS mem
bers to resign and to "eradicate
the cancer" by isolating its sup
posedly leftish leadership. The
press and the broadcasting cor
poration widely publicized the
Justice Minister's statement, but
few media mentioned the point
by-point rebuttal from NUSAS.

The radio refused the students
the right to broadcast their reply.
No more than 335 out of 18,500
members have obeyed the Min

ister's call (o resign.
AFT Kit IT HI;( \>li; obvious
that the verbal attack ha'l not
succeeded, Vorster sent the secur
ity police to raid the offices of
NUSAS in Cape Town. In th e
presence ot the General Secretary
and the President, the police
searched the NUSAS offices for
evidence of suspected connections
with banned African political par
ties.
However, the police found
nothing and merely took away
eight documents which they sus
pected of being "Communist" lit -
eral lire.
NUSAS issued urgent appeals
to national unions of students
through the Coordinating Secre
tariat of National Unions of Stu
dents (COSEC) after both the
Vorster attacks and the security
police raid. A number of national
unions have already responded to
NUSAS' call for international stu
dent solidarity.

South African Students (NUSAS)
has been under heavy attack for
the last three months from the
South African Government, its
| security police, and even tlie Gov
ernment-controlled South African
I Broadcasting Corporation.
NUSAS has been attacked by
the Government many times be
fore. The student union's policies
of non-discrimination, its accep
tance of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, and its opposi
tion to discriminatory and oppres
sive legislation enforced by the
white minority Government, have
been a thorn in the side of the
forces of apartheid. These attacks
have become even more vicious
during the last two months. Some
observers have seen in them a
prelude to the outright banning
of NUSAS.
The Minister of Justice, Johan
nes Balthazar Vorster, began the
attacks in lato August when he
threatened direct action against
NUSAS. He followed this up in
mid-September with a statement
in which lie said: "NUSAS has
become the mouthpiece of liberal
ists in South Africa and the
mouthpiece of Communists."
"I don't say that every member
of NUSAS is a Communist, but
every Communist has been a
member of NUSAS. ... It is time
that something must be done . . .
(NUSAS is) a cancer in the life
of South Africa which must be
cut out."
This was followed by further
i attacks on NUSAS by the Sou th

African Broadcasting Corporation
and the pro-apartheid press.
NUSAS fought hack with a series
of public statements in which it
asked Vorster to furnish proof
that NUSAS was controlled by
Communists.
The statements insisted that
NUSAS was neither Communist
nor anti-Communisl, but that Vor
ster branded every anti-apartheid
movement "Communist
VORSTER once again charged
that NUSAS was "unpatriotic, d
cidedly left, and tainted with com
munism." He said that the charge
was "conclusively proved" by
seven "facts."
These were < 1» that certain
known Communists had been
members of NUSAS in the past ;
(2) that NUSAS had "persistently
protested against all action taken
against Communists in South
Africa"; (3) that it had cooper
ated with other African national
unions of students such as those
in "Ghana, Algeria, Ethiopia, in
fact all Addis Ababa Conference
countries"; (4) that it had cooper
ated with UFHS i the United Fed
erations of Hungarian Students,
comprising students exiled since
the 1956 revolt > and PKPPTM
(National Union of Malayan Stu
dents); (5) that it subscribed to
the doctrine of "one man one
vote"; (6) that NUSAS had been
a member of the. International
Union of Students i'IUS) from
1945 to 1954; (7) that it had
elected Chief Albert Luthuli
Honorary President. This last
"charge" was meant to show that
NUSAS was "closely" associated
with the banned African National
Congress of which Chief Luthuli
had been President.
Vorster called on NUSAS mem
bers to resign and to "eradicate
the cancer" by isolating its sup
posedly leftish leadership. The
press and the broadcasting cor
poration widely publicized the
Justice Minister's statement, but
few media mentioned the point
by-point rebuttal from NUSAS.

The radio refused the students
the right to broadcast their reply.
No more than 335 out of 18,500
members have obeyed the Min

ister's call (o resign.
AFT Kit IT HI;( \>li; obvious
that the verbal attack ha'l not
succeeded, Vorster sent the secur
ity police to raid the offices of
NUSAS in Cape Town. In th e
presence ot the General Secretary
and the President, the police
searched the NUSAS offices for
evidence of suspected connections
with banned African political par
ties.
However, the police found
nothing and merely took away
eight documents which they sus
pected of being "Communist" lit -
eral lire.
NUSAS issued urgent appeals
to national unions of students
through the Coordinating Secre
tariat of National Unions of Stu
dents (COSEC) after both the
Vorster attacks and the security
police raid. A number of national
unions have already responded to
NUSAS' call for international stu
dent solidarity.

has been under heavy attack for
the last three months from the
South African Government, its
| security police, and even tlie Gov
ernment-controlled South African
I Broadcasting Corporation.
NUSAS has been attacked by
the Government many times be
fore. The student union's policies
of non-discrimination, its accep
tance of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, and its opposi
tion to discriminatory and oppres
sive legislation enforced by the
white minority Government, have
been a thorn in the side of the
forces of apartheid. These attacks
have become even more vicious
during the last two months. Some
observers have seen in them a
prelude to the outright banning
of NUSAS.
The Minister of Justice, Johan
nes Balthazar Vorster, began the
attacks in lato August when he
threatened direct action against
NUSAS. He followed this up in
mid-September with a statement
in which lie said: "NUSAS has
become the mouthpiece of liberal
ists in South Africa and the
mouthpiece of Communists."
"I don't say that every member
of NUSAS is a Communist, but
every Communist has been a
member of NUSAS. ... It is time
that something must be done . . .
(NUSAS is) a cancer in the life
of South Africa which must be
cut out."
This was followed by further
i attacks on NUSAS by the Sou th

African Broadcasting Corporation
and the pro-apartheid press.
NUSAS fought hack with a series
of public statements in which it
asked Vorster to furnish proof
that NUSAS was controlled by
Communists.
The statements insisted that
NUSAS was neither Communist
nor anti-Communisl, but that Vor
ster branded every anti-apartheid
movement "Communist
VORSTER once again charged
that NUSAS was "unpatriotic, d
cidedly left, and tainted with com
munism." He said that the charge
was "conclusively proved" by
seven "facts."
These were < 1» that certain
known Communists had been
members of NUSAS in the past ;
(2) that NUSAS had "persistently
protested against all action taken
against Communists in South
Africa"; (3) that it had cooper
ated with other African national
unions of students such as those
in "Ghana, Algeria, Ethiopia, in
fact all Addis Ababa Conference
countries"; (4) that it had cooper
ated with UFHS i the United Fed
erations of Hungarian Students,
comprising students exiled since
the 1956 revolt > and PKPPTM
(National Union of Malayan Stu
dents); (5) that it subscribed to
the doctrine of "one man one
vote"; (6) that NUSAS had been
a member of the. International
Union of Students i'IUS) from
1945 to 1954; (7) that it had
elected Chief Albert Luthuli
Honorary President. This last
"charge" was meant to show that
NUSAS was "closely" associated
with the banned African National
Congress of which Chief Luthuli
had been President.
Vorster called on NUSAS mem
bers to resign and to "eradicate
the cancer" by isolating its sup
posedly leftish leadership. The
press and the broadcasting cor
poration widely publicized the
Justice Minister's statement, but
few media mentioned the point
by-point rebuttal from NUSAS.

The radio refused the students
the right to broadcast their reply.
No more than 335 out of 18,500
members have obeyed the Min

ister's call (o resign.
AFT Kit IT HI;( \>li; obvious
that the verbal attack ha'l not
succeeded, Vorster sent the secur
ity police to raid the offices of
NUSAS in Cape Town. In th e
presence ot the General Secretary
and the President, the police
searched the NUSAS offices for
evidence of suspected connections
with banned African political par
ties.
However, the police found
nothing and merely took away
eight documents which they sus
pected of being "Communist" lit -
eral lire.
NUSAS issued urgent appeals
to national unions of students
through the Coordinating Secre
tariat of National Unions of Stu
dents (COSEC) after both the
Vorster attacks and the security
police raid. A number of national
unions have already responded to
NUSAS' call for international stu
dent solidarity.
