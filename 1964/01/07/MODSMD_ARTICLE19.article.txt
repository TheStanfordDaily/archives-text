# Schism Prevented In Canadian Union
## 
### 
(IILA) A compromise agree
ment between English-speaking
and French-speaking members ot
the National Federation of Cana
dian Unive r si t y Students
(NFCUSi prevented a threatened
schism during the 27th National
Congress that met in Edmonton
from September 29 through Octo
ber 5, 1903.
Many French Canadians feel
that their linguistic and cultural
identity is not given the proper
recognition or opportunity to de
velop in a Canada largely domi
nated by its English population.
This problem of "biculturalism"
has caused French Canadian stu
dents to demand separate English
and French student organizations
with only a single national "super
structure."
To give substance to its "affir
mation of the cultural and ethnic
duality" of Canada, NFCUS al
tered its basic organizational
structure. New resolutions pro
vide for "the establishment of two
equal groups, with internal sov
ereignty on questions within their
exclusive jurisdiction, within the
new Canadian union of students."
One resolution calls for the elec
tion of two equal vice-presidents,
one by a caucus of French-speak
ing delegates and the other by a
caucus of English-speaking dele
gates. Each of these officers will
be concerned with the internal
reorganization of his respective
group, as well as with other duties
not yet outlined. Equal votes will
be given to the French and Eng
lish groups.
According to NFCUS President
Dave Jenkins, the problem of bi
culturalism, which the students
successfully faced up to during
their 27th Congress, is one that
Canada will be increasingly con
cerned with during the current
decade.
