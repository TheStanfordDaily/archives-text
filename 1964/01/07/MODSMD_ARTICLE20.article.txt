Six student representatives of
South African universities in Oc
tober handed over to the daily
press a declaration in which they
defended the National Union of
South African Students (NUSAS)
against the attacks by the Minis
ter of Justice.
TIIK DFUUAHATIOX does not
go into the individual accusa
tions by the Minister; it claims
that the real problem is whether
a National Union ought to be
open to all students in the coun
try or not. The democratic char
acter ol NUSAS is emphasized;
in addition it is stressed that the
support which NUSAS enjoys

South African attitude.
The existence ot the Rhodes
University iu Grahamstown is
threatened by the South African
government's decision to set up

University for cultivating in an
"iiii-S<mi<li African atmosphere"
"liberal ideas" which were di

dustry and has to rely mainly on
subsidies from the government,
it would be a simple matter to
strangle it financially.

Six student representatives of
South African universities in Oc
tober handed over to the daily
press a declaration in which they
defended the National Union of
South African Students (NUSAS)
against the attacks by the Minis
ter of Justice.
TIIK DFUUAHATIOX does not
go into the individual accusa
tions by the Minister; it claims
that the real problem is whether
a National Union ought to be
open to all students in the coun
try or not. The democratic char
acter ol NUSAS is emphasized;
in addition it is stressed that the
support which NUSAS enjoys
among student organizations out
side of South Africa does not
mean that NUSAS has an anti-
South African attitude.
The existence ot the Rhodes
University iu Grahamstown is
threatened by the South African
government's decision to set up
a university in Port Elizabeth in
dependent of the Rhodes Univer
sity. It is impossible for two
"white" universities to exist in
eastern C'apeland on account of
the lack of lecturers and students.
in this connection, a Hector
from Port lOlizabeth, Mr. Kngel
breeht, reproached tiie Rhodes
University for cultivating in an
"iiii-S<mi<li African atmosphere"
"liberal ideas" which were di
rected against the "C'alvinistic
philosophy of life of the Afri
kaans-speaking section of the pop
ulation." As the Rhodes Univer
sity enjoys little support from in
dustry and has to rely mainly on
subsidies from the government,
it would be a simple matter to
strangle it financially.
