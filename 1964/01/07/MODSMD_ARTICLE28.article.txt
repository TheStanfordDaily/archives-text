# Two Points Mar Indian Mark

### PETER EAKLAND 
The Indian cagers have bounced
their way to a good early season
7-2 record both setbacks of the
heartbreaking one-point variety—
mainly because of the sharp eye
and grasping tentacles of Tom
Dose. Guard Kent Hinckley and
forwards Bob Bedell and Clayton
Raaka have proved invaluable in j
balancing the offense.
STANFORD streaked to six
straight wins before falling be-1
fore Arizona State at Tempe. Ore-1
gon was the first victim, falling
59-51 and 83-65 on successive i
nights. The team had a slight case
of the dead week doldrums and
looked impressive in the first i
giimc. only in streaks. Soph Bo- j
dell carried most of the load as j
most vets seemed overcautious
and cold from the floor. Dose was ;
in form the second night and so
w a s Stanford.
San Jose and St. Marys, twoj
neighborhood opponents, were!
toyed with by the Indians before
going on a holiday tour. Balanced |
scoring kept opponents from key
ing on any one player anrl the
Cards added two more victories
56-50 and 72-37. In the St. Marys
fray five Cards broke into double
figures—Dose, Bedell, Hinckley,
Raaka, and Moore.
WHILE TIIE TEAM Stanford
has to beat to win the AAVVU
crown, UCLA, was running to
three straight victories in the LA
Classic, Stanford was barnstorm
ing in the mid and southwest. In
the first two games against Kan
sas and Southern Methodist, Dose
came through with the two best,
point outputs of an Indian this
season, 28 and 27 points respec
tively. Up to this point, Stanford
had limited its opponents to an
average of 50 points a game, one
of the best defensive averages in
the country. This percentage was
dented somewhat, but the offense
didn't fade and Stanford added
two more notches by 69-64 and
30-70 counts.
The Cards moved on to Arizona
St. but without the services of
Tom Dose, who sat on the bench
with a bruised knee. Ken Hinck
ley, with the patented jumper
from the free-throw line area,
pumped 20 points through the
hoops and Clayton Raaka, the de
fensive whiz in the forward spot,
put on an offensive show and tal
lied 18. Having led all the way,
Joe Caldwell, Arizona's St.'s po
tential AU-American, tipped goal
ward a shot in the closing seconds
that rolled in at the buzzer and
gave the home team a 61-60 theft
that left its long winning streak
at home intact.
Stanford then came home and,
in a scheduling quirk that has
left all mystified, played two im
portant games with IJSC just be
fore school opened. Improved
somewhat, Dose was back in the
lineup; but he could operate at
only 80 percent efficiency accord

ing to Coach Howie Dallmar.
Eighty percent efficiency pro
duced a nifty two-day total of 30
rebounds, 16 points, and two good
defensive efforts.
FRIDAY NIGHT.In the confer
ence opener for both teams, Stan
ford streaked to an early lead
and then proceeded to lose most
of it as the Trojans caught fire.

Neither team could mount an ad-:
vantage in the second half. Tom '
Dose's free throw sent the game ;
into an overtime period in which
Stanford led until a USC jump
shot found the mark and left the
Indians on the short end of a
75-74 score. The team avenged
the defeat the next night, winning
I>V 16 points, 62-46.

San Jose and St. Marys, twoj
neighborhood opponents, were!
toyed with by the Indians before
going on a holiday tour. Balanced |
scoring kept opponents from key
ing on any one player anrl the
Cards added two more victories
56-50 and 72-37. In the St. Marys
fray five Cards broke into double
figures—Dose, Bedell, Hinckley,
Raaka, and Moore.
WHILE TIIE TEAM Stanford
has to beat to win the AAVVU
crown, UCLA, was running to
three straight victories in the LA
Classic, Stanford was barnstorm
ing in the mid and southwest. In
the first two games against Kan
sas and Southern Methodist, Dose
came through with the two best,
point outputs of an Indian this
season, 28 and 27 points respec
tively. Up to this point, Stanford
had limited its opponents to an
average of 50 points a game, one
of the best defensive averages in
the country. This percentage was
dented somewhat, but the offense
didn't fade and Stanford added
two more notches by 69-64 and
30-70 counts.
The Cards moved on to Arizona
St. but without the services of
Tom Dose, who sat on the bench
with a bruised knee. Ken Hinck
ley, with the patented jumper
from the free-throw line area,
pumped 20 points through the
hoops and Clayton Raaka, the de
fensive whiz in the forward spot,
put on an offensive show and tal
lied 18. Having led all the way,
Joe Caldwell, Arizona's St.'s po
tential AU-American, tipped goal
ward a shot in the closing seconds
that rolled in at the buzzer and
gave the home team a 61-60 theft
that left its long winning streak
at home intact.
Stanford then came home and,
in a scheduling quirk that has
left all mystified, played two im
portant games with IJSC just be
fore school opened. Improved
somewhat, Dose was back in the
lineup; but he could operate at
only 80 percent efficiency accord

ing to Coach Howie Dallmar.
Eighty percent efficiency pro
duced a nifty two-day total of 30
rebounds, 16 points, and two good
defensive efforts.
FRIDAY NIGHT.In the confer
ence opener for both teams, Stan
ford streaked to an early lead
and then proceeded to lose most
of it as the Trojans caught fire.

Neither team could mount an ad-:
vantage in the second half. Tom '
Dose's free throw sent the game ;
into an overtime period in which
Stanford led until a USC jump
shot found the mark and left the
Indians on the short end of a
75-74 score. The team avenged
the defeat the next night, winning
I>V 16 points, 62-46.
