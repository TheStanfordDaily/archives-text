# Soph QB's Seen As Keys In Grid Wars
## 
### TOM ELIAS 
Stanford football partisans who
suffered through a rather dismal
season this fall were rewarded
with a stirring come-from-behind
victory in the Tribe's final game
of the season, a belated Big Game
before SO,OOO roaring fans.
Stanford's eomebaek from a
leficit which reached eight points,
it 17 lo 9, to a 28 to 17 victory
was a marked reversal of ihe
form which earlier had seen the
r ndians repeatedly blow early
eads in the final period.
THIS HAPPENED against
'JCLA when a late pass misfired
md was run back for the decisive
-core, against Southern Cal when
he Tribe led by 11 at the half,
only to lose by ten points, and at
Rice in Houston where ihey also
3lew a half time lead.
Much of this failure to main
ain the advantages they had
gained is probably due to the fact
hat after first string quarterback
31ark Weaver injured his knee
igainst UCLA, Coach John Ral
>ton had the option of using in
experienced sophomores Dick
Berg, Mike Connelly and Don
Cook or shifting one of his con
certed-quarterback half b a c k s,
>teve Thurlow or Dick Ragsdale
>ack under center.
SINCE THE HALFBACK op
ion, generally very well executed
>y Thurlow, was the heart of the
Tribe offense, Ralston felt he had
0 go with ihe sophomores. It is
1 tribute to his fine coaching
sense that Ralston stuck with
sophomore Berg despite his dis
astrous interception against
UCLA.
Ralston brought Berg along so
well that he was able to engineei
;he crunching ground game which
defeated Notre Dame, and later
the fine comeback in Big Game.
Place kicker Braden Beck's out
standing performance in Big
Game, with three field goals from
near or further out than 40 yards
was also a vindication of the faith
that Ralston had had in him all
season. Beck finished among the
top ten field goal kickers in the
nation, with 8 succesful three
pointers in IS attempts.
