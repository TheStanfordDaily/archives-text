### 
MEMPHIS (CPS) The Uni
versity of Mississippi has passed
(he last test in its recovery from
the integration crisis last fall. It
is also once again all white.
The Southern Association of
Colleges and Schools last month
lifted its surveillance of the Uni
versity and other Mississippi in
stitutions of higher learning. The
schools will retain all accredita
tion. The Association had been
studying the University since
Governor Ross Barnett clashed
with its administration over the
admission of Negro James Mere
dith last year.
With the graduation of Mere
dith and the withdrawal of Cleve
McDowell, the University now has
no Negro students.
The Association's Commission
on Colleges reported at a meeting
in Memphis (hat "no overt viola
tion of the principles under scru
tiny have occurred since (he last
annual meeting." Governor Bar
nett had been accused of interfer
ing politically with the schools.
