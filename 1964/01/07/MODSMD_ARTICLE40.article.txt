The 16,000-volume collection will

The late President attended
Stanford for a time during the
fall quarter of 1940 as a graduate
student. Under a special arrange

classes of his own choosing, with
out academic credit.
Negotiations for the library
had been under way for several
months between USIS, Tours, and
Stanford officials when Mr. Ken
nedy's tragic death motivated the
naming of the library in his
honor.
