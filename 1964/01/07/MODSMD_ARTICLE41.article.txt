# Shriver Reveals Peace Corps Plan
## 
### 
Sargent Shriver, director of the
Peace Corps, announced a new
Senior Year Program, at Colum
bia, University which will enable
junior to enroll for special sum
mer training prior to graduation.
Shriver said. "In the past, the
Peace Corp has come to colleges
and universities primarily to taik
to graduating seniors and gradu
ate students. Through the Senior
Year Program, we hope to make a
particular appeal to juniors as
well. "The Senior Year Program
represents a major effort on our
part to increase the quality of
Peace Corps training programs,"
he added.
THIS SPRING, a selected num
ber of college juniors who have
applied for the special program
will be invited to participate in a
summer training program at one
of six colleges or universities to
be selected within the next few
weeks. After summer training,
the students will return to their
colleges to complete their senior
year. They will continue th e i r
foreign language and area studies
on an individual basis and will
receive assignments in the spring
of their senior year.
The program will be expanded
in 1963 if it fulfills current ex
pectations.
Shriver outlined the advantages
of such a program. He said that
applicants would be able to revise
senior year schedules "to reflect
an interest" in a particular aspect
of Peace Corps work. They will
also have the chance to get free
career-related training with pos
sible college crcdit. The Peace
Corps will have more time to
choose assignments appropriate
to the applicant's talents.
