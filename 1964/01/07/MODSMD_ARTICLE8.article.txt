# Frosh Dolly Saves 'Cleopatra' Chappie
## 
### ELLINGTON K. FARTHINGDALE 
j The Stanford Chaparrel pre
sented its November, 19(53, issue
| to the campus yesterday, January
j6, 1964. Despite the extra time ob
viously expended on this issue, it
is not up to the standards of ex
cellence and taste that Stanford
students have come to know as
the hallmark of Chaparrel pub
j lications.
This time, the Chaparrel, blat
antly defying University policy,
focussed its attention on the for
bidden domain outside the campus
walls, hut came up with a loser.
The Chaparrel, onetime incisive
social critic, has become the
! Photoplay of the West. Yes,
friends, the Chappie has discov
ered the cinema. This November
issue is devoted almost exclu
sively to the colossal movie spec
tacle Cleopatra and its wayward
stars Elizabeth Taylor and Rich
ard Burton. The subject is ap
pealing, but it has suffered, in the
months between the Chappie's in
tended publication date and today,
from overexposure.
THE FIRST ARTICLE, entitles
"Cleopatra Reviewed," vacillates
between a spoof, a review, and a
failure. Retelling the movie in
jaunty terms ("The emperor of
Rome was not to be made in a
day"), the Old Boy strains for a
few laughs. But for humor he has
to rely on unimaginative puns.
The Old Boy leaves the reader
guessing as to whether he has
written a genuine criticism, a
satire, or an attack on Liz Taylor's
weight problem.
After the tedious humor of
"Cleopatra .Reviewed," the reader
is treated to a series of photos of

| attractive Branner freshman Kris
! Jones who, the Old Boy feels,
j makes a more acceptably slender
I Cleopatra. If the captions in this
I section fail, the photographs do
not; and here the Old Boy offers
some real entertainment.
THE NEXT outstanding article,
1 "An Interview with Richard Bird
j in' " succeeds slightly better be-
I cause it maintains a single, base
approach to the celebrated affair
j between the movie's two hop at
tractions. But again, the Old Boy
strains with crude puns. "Well,"
j the Chappie suggests, "let's get
off Miss and stagger on
to something broader." Luckily
Miss Taylor has not lost weight
since November. "Acting is all I
do," purrs Birdin. "It's just a
matter of finding the right parts."
If not sparkling, ( the puns are at
least funny, but the Old Boy goes
too far when he refers to an old
"Tin Lizzie." There, he mistakes
the humorous for the grotesque.
Perhaps the most telling criticism
of the "Interview" is that it lacks
subtlety.
There follows a series of movie
review parodies, the best of which
concerns an Army training film
about flies, disease, and yours;
and the worst of which is a poig
nant review of Cleopatra by Eddie
Fishie. Here we sympathize with
Mr. Fishie, whose emotional div
orce from reality makes him in
articulate. We can still hope,
however, for Mr. Fishie's eventual
success.
THE LAST ARTICLE concerns
two aspiring actors, Beth and
Freddie. Stangely enough, Beth,
not Freddie, climbs the "pinnacle
of success, "is seduced by one
"Rick" and is subsequently dis-

I carded by him. Clever, witty,
and lightly done, 1 his article, with
a little polish would be perfectly
acceptable to the Daily.
The Old Boy dug through the
files for some old jokes as filler
material. By contrast, the adver-
I tisements are hilariously spacious.
For speed-readers, we recom
mend twice over for the follow
ing: Beth and Freddie, the car
toons, which are some of the best
the Chaparrel has done recently,
and most of all Kris, who doesn't
I even require reading.
