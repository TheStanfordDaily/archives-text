# Unsigned Loyalty Oath Keeps Soph from Stuttgart
## 
### VIVI BOZMAN 
Because of his conviction that
the right to travel should not
subject to governmental restric
tion, Jeffrey Shurtieff, a soph
omore scheduled to leave in De
cember to attend the Stanford in
Germany campus, refused to sign
the loyalty oath necessary to ob
tain a passport for travel outside
the United States.
Shurleff's decision to act accord
ing to his principles means that,
even though accepted for the
Germany campus by the univer
sity, the opportunity to study
and travel in Europe is closed
to him.
In an interview with a Daily
reporter, Shurtieff stated that he

feared what could happen in a
society where the government
feels it has the privilege to dele
gate certain rights and restrict
others.
He noted that the required
loyalty oath is the result of a
ruling, not by the elected officials
of the people, but by the ap
pointed members of the state de
partment.
In asking a citizen to sign a
loyalty oath, the government,
Shurtleff believes, is asking him
to affirm something about which
he is really uninformed. "Until
one can know something different
he cannot really know his own
system," Shurtleff stated.
Shurtleff is not in school this
quarter, but had planned in De
cember to spend some time living
in Mexico, i A passport is not re
quired to travel to Mexico.)
Shurtleff had planned to travel
to India after completing the
session in Stuttgart.
