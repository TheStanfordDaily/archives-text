## Major Bay Area Earthquakes Described by Cal Seismologist 
### MARTY MASKALL 
Earthquakes in the Bay Area
have resulted mainly from two
major faults, one on each side of
the bay, according to Professor
Don Tocher, the first of the Tues
day Evening Series speakers dur
ing Winter quarter.
Professor Tocher, who is Asso
ciate Research Seismologist at
the University of California at
Berkeley, spoke to a capacity
Dinkelspiel crowd on "Major
Earthquakes in the San Francisco
Bay Area."
A major portion of the lecture
was devoted to explaining dia
grams and photographs of the

effects of local earthquakes.
Tocher showed several pictures of
ihe damage to Stanford in the
1906 earthquake.
THE 190(5 Earthquake in San
Francisco was a result of horizon
tal displacement of the San An
dreas fault. At that time, seis
mological instruments to measure
magnitude of theshock had not
been developed. Tocher showed a
picture of a road which had been
displaced 21 feet to the right.
Earthquakes are very difficult
to predict, according to Tocher,
and about the best way to tell is
that the "longer ago the last one
was, the closer the next one will
be."
THE MAGNITUDE of an earth
quake is measured on a logarith
mic scale, so that a magnitude of
2 is ten times as great as a mag
nitude of 1. Tocher stressed that
earthquakes can weaken build
ings so that the next shock, even
though it may be smaller, can
severely damage the structure.
Tocher rescribed two types of
faults, vertical and horizontal.
The vertical type, which can be
found in Nevada earthquakes to
day. is worn away less rapidly by
the effects of weathering.
More common in California is
the horizontal fault, "which can
be leveled by one or two plow
ings," Tocher said. Of this type
arc both the San Andreas fault,
which runs along the coastal re
gion, and the Hayward fault,
stretching in the East Bay Area.
The two faults intersect south of
San Jose in a region of high seis
mological disturbance.
