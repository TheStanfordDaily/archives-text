### 
WASHINGTON < CPS Iâ€”A civil
rights squabble injected into the
midst of a plan for radical
change in college and university
Reserve Officer Training Corps
(ROTO programs dimmed hopes
for congressional approval of the
plan.
The House bill to change ROTC
programs for colleges as well as
high schools missed its chance
for passage when the measure
brought was up under suspension
of House rules.
Rep. Otis Pike, D-N.Y., led the
move to reject the bill because
it lacked a ban on racial segrega
tion in schools receiving funds
for ROTC programs.
THE HOUSE refused passage
after Pike said the bill was an
attempt to leave the chamber
"bilked, trimmed, jobbed, lum
bered, clipped and swindled."
Pike claimed Rep. F. Edward
Hebert, D-La., had brought the
bill to the floor under suspension
of rules, making it. impossible for
members to amend it.
Pike wanted an amendment that
would halt ROTC funds to any
school that refused admission to
students because of their race or
color.
The bill as entered would ex
pand junior ROTC from 254 to
a maximum of 2,000 high schools.
It would continue the present
four-year ROTC program in col
leges, but allow a two-year ROTC
program in those colleges wish
ing one. The college-level pro
gram would be primarily volun
tary.
The program would receive schol
arships during their four years
of college, provided they serve
four years active duty once com
missioned. The bill would also in
crease monthly retainer pay tor
all ROTC students from $27 to
$50 a month.
Many U.S. colleges and univer
sities have already started a cut
back in ROTC programs in anti
cipation of the new plans.
Informed sources predicted,
however, that the new ROTC leg
j lslation will be renewed early
I next year, with hopes of passage
bolstered by the House .Rules
