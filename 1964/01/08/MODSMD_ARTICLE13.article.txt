# Construction in Progress On New Main Libe Stack
## 
### MARTY MASKALL 
Construction of a basement stack in Main Library is now in
progress. The new stack, which will enlarge the book capacity of
the library by approximately 350,000 volumes, was begun just after
the close of school before Christmas. A white fence surrounds the
main construction area, which is located on the north side of the
library near Hoover Tower.
In an effort to avoid as much noise and inconvenience as possible,

the most serious noise-producing - *
activities are to be closed down at
1:30 p.m. Heavy demolition work
will ,so far as possible, be p e in
formed between 11 p.m. and 7
a.m. by a night crew.
THE NOISIEST part of the
work — the breaking of the con
crete floors in the light wells —
was substantially completed by
the time that classes began this
week.
The area beneath the present
main stairway, reading rooms and
other public areas of the Main
Library are being excavated to

per mit the installation of the new
stack, which will be approxi
mately equal to two of the present
stack floors — an increase of
nearly a third, with stairway and
elevator access from the present
stacks.
With the completion of the
planned new undergraduate li
brary, a part of the PACE pro
gram. Main Library will become
a supplementary library for spe
cial studies and thesis work. The
new library will be more general
and will be designed for the needs
of undergraduate students.
Included in the plans for the
new stack of Main Library are
a new air-conditioned microtext
and newspaper reading room with
twenty reading stations, fort y
eight additional study carrels,
and a projection room for p re
viewing films to be used in
classes.
IT IS ESTIMATED that the en
tire project should be finished by
next July, to permit expansion
of the present collections into this
new area before the fall quarter
begins.
This addition to the library's
book capacity is of critical impor
tance, since the book space is now
about 90 percent filled. The col
lections being built up for the
Undergraduate Library, the; ex
panding Division of Special Col
lections. and other library activi
ties are badly in need of space.
The microtext collection are also
increasing very rapidly, and they
require more suitable storage and
use facilities.
The new undergraduate library,
initially high on the PACE prefer
ence list, is now only 5 percent fi
nanced. but there have been assur
ances that it will be constructed
eventually.
The new library would contain
mostly study rooms and the few
books there would be for immedi
ate reference, like the books in
the present Reserve Book Room.
The old library would continue to
house the stacks.

IT IS ESTIMATED that the en
tire project should be finished by
next July, to permit expansion
of the present collections into this
new area before the fall quarter
begins.
This addition to the library's
book capacity is of critical impor
tance, since the book space is now
about 90 percent filled. The col
lections being built up for the
Undergraduate Library, the; ex
panding Division of Special Col
lections. and other library activi
ties are badly in need of space.
The microtext collection are also
increasing very rapidly, and they
require more suitable storage and
use facilities.
The new undergraduate library,
initially high on the PACE prefer
ence list, is now only 5 percent fi
nanced. but there have been assur
ances that it will be constructed
eventually.
The new library would contain
mostly study rooms and the few
books there would be for immedi
ate reference, like the books in
the present Reserve Book Room.
The old library would continue to
house the stacks.
Construction of a basement stack in Main Library is now in
progress. The new stack, which will enlarge the book capacity of
the library by approximately 350,000 volumes, was begun just after
the close of school before Christmas. A white fence surrounds the
main construction area, which is located on the north side of the
library near Hoover Tower.
In an effort to avoid as much noise and inconvenience as possible,

the most serious noise-producing - *
activities are to be closed down at
1:30 p.m. Heavy demolition work
will ,so far as possible, be p e in
formed between 11 p.m. and 7
a.m. by a night crew.
THE NOISIEST part of the
work — the breaking of the con
crete floors in the light wells —
was substantially completed by
the time that classes began this
week.
The area beneath the present
main stairway, reading rooms and
other public areas of the Main
Library are being excavated to

per mit the installation of the new
stack, which will be approxi
mately equal to two of the present
stack floors — an increase of
nearly a third, with stairway and
elevator access from the present
stacks.
With the completion of the
planned new undergraduate li
brary, a part of the PACE pro
gram. Main Library will become
a supplementary library for spe
cial studies and thesis work. The
new library will be more general
and will be designed for the needs
of undergraduate students.
Included in the plans for the
new stack of Main Library are
a new air-conditioned microtext
and newspaper reading room with
twenty reading stations, fort y
eight additional study carrels,
and a projection room for p re
viewing films to be used in
classes.
