Gunner Myrdal is one of the
world's most respected and influ
ential social scientists. His many
books have had both a unique
influence in the United States—
witness his portrayal of the pre
war position of the American Ne
gro in An American Dilemma —
and general significance for social
problems throughout the world—
as in Rich Lands and Poor and
An International Economy. Hi s
knowledge of economics, sociol
ogy, and political science enables
him to grasp many problems that
might elude scholars specializing
more narrowly. Indeed, it is this
talent that gives his writings both
technical and popular appeal. This
reviewer will be confined to com
menting primarily on economic
problems which are at the root of
the issues on the current state of
American society raised in Chal
lenge to Affluence.
To Professor Myrdal, the most
salient and historically unique
characteristic of modern America
is that the upper two-thirds of
the population live in affluence of
a kind which can potentially lead
to satisfaction of long-held liberal
and even Utopian ideals. Access to
leadership positions in the society
and economic security are now
potentially in the grasp of every
one in this affluent majority. Both
the need for and availability of
educational facilities have con
tributed to the equalization of op
portunities within this fortunate
group. This development has been
associated with increasing cul
tural homogeneity as exemplified
by the proliferation of comfort
able suburban communities. By
contrast, Myrdal views the in
creasing education and skill re
quirements to have contributed
to the relative worsening of the
position of Ihe bottom one-third
who are uneducated and unskilled
and whose children likely do not
have adequate educational oppor
tunity in poor living areas depen
dent upon locally financed schools.
The virtually destitute bottom 8
percent or 9 percent, in which
minority groups and the aged are
disproportionately heavily repre
sented, have been particularly
hard hit in recent years by the
increased unemployment result
ing from the inadequate growth
performance of the economy. Myr
dal fools that this unfortunate un
organized bottom third is grad
ually becoming submerged with
out effective political representa
tion and its morale is being de
stroyed. Cut *ent racial problems
are being g/eatly aggravated by
this economic separation.
SOME RECENT evidence pre
sented in the September 1963
issue of Fortune by Charles Sil
berman in "The Businessman and
Negro" supports Myrdal's thesis.
In 1939, the end year of a period
of heavy and sustained unemploy

mont, the average income level of
the non-white families was 37 per
cent of the income of white fami
lies. By 1952, the end year of a
period of very tight employment
and rising incomes due to the
stimulus of two war efforts, this
figure had risen remarkably to 57
percent. Since 1952, and particu
larly after 1957, the unemploy
ment levels have risen again, and
by 1962 the income level of an
average non-white family had
dropped to 53 percent of its white
equivalent even though during
this period many overt discrimi
natory practices were relaxed.
Myrdal examines the social and
economic implications of an un
employment rate of SV» percent
which the U.S. has had since 1957.
Does it mean, for example, that
only 5% percent of the popula
tion is affected adversely? Myr
dal thinks that about as many
more workers are on short time
or on the margin of being unem
ployed with very lit lie income se
curity. In addition, one might sug
gest that after a period of sus
stained unemployment, many
marginal workers simply leave
the labor force in the sense that
they do not actively look for work
and thus are not officially counted
in the s'L> percent. He views wel
fare payments to be an inadequate
ego destroying substitute for
work opportunities. The implica
tions for the racial problem are
also clear. In a tight labor market
where the level of wages is such
that the supply of workers is
about equal to employers' demand
for their services with no great
mismatching of available skills
and needs, employers have rela
tively limited scope for practicing
discrimination. By contrast, in a
slack labor market where there
is an excess supply of workers at
the current wage level, employers
have much more scope for picking
and choosing or catering to what
they allege to be their customers'
prejudices.
ECONOMISTS NOW know that
in a highly organized capitalist
economy (unlike those which are
underdeveloped or war shattered)
it is fairly easy to increase pro
duction, given the existence of un
employed resources, by taking
steps to increase the final demand
for goods and services. Now the
U.S. can use fiscal policy fairly
freely to achieve this end either
by increasing government ex
penditures for goods and services
directly or by reducing taxes to
put more purchasing power in the
hands of consumers and business
firms. Thus, this stimulus to pro
duction would in turn increase the
demand for the services of labor.
Unfortunately, the most dramatic
example of the effectiveness of
this kind of fiscal policy is the
increased government expendi
tures for armaments at the begin
ning of World War 11. At that
time, the very heavy unemploy
ment of the 1930's—which some
people thought had become per
manent —quickly disappeared and
total production rose very quick

ly. There is 110 economic reason
why a full employment fiscal pol
icy cannot take a peaceful form,
such as ihe current tax reduction
bill before Congress, although
politically this has been almost
impossible to effect in the past.
Myrdal examines two related
difficulties in relying solely on
this policy of increasing aggre
gate demand: (1) many unskilled
and uneducated workers or ones
with obsolete skills may in their
present state be unemployable no
matter what stimulation is given
to the final demand for goods and
services; (2) inflationary pres
sure on both prices and wages
will increase before full employ
ment is reached. Problem (1)
above, the mismatching of skills
and job opportunities, is often
referred to as "structural" unem
ployment to separate ii from that
due to deficient aggregate de
mand as occurred in the Great
Depression of the 1930'5. Myrdal
is at, variance with many contem-.
porary economists in emphasizing
these structural problems and
feels that turning on the tap of
aggregate demand will only cure
a fraction of present unemploy
ment although this is still a neces
sary condition for improving the
lot of ihe remainder. Job skill
requirements are increasing as
time passes and the experience
of being unemployed for a sub
stantial period has a very debili
tating influence on the individuals
concerned. Thus he suggests there
is a need for much mure compre
hensive "planning" in education,
job retraining, resettlement, and
rehabilitation. This reviewer
would tend to reverse Myrdal's
emphasis and suggest that rela
tively very simple steps taken to
increase effective demand so as
to make a really "tight" labor
market would eliminate most,
though probably not all, outright
unemployment. In any event, it
would then be possible to see
what the structural problems
really were. When people became
used to the high levels of unem
ployment in the 1930'5, there was
similar talk of structural unem
ployment and the existence of un
employables. Fortunately this
thesis was definitely proven
wrong in World War II by the
fast elimination of unemployment
accompanied by increased labor
force participation. This is not
to deny the tremendous payoff,
both economically and culturally,
of educational investments in the
submerged minority whose chil
dren are now effectively denied
educational opportunities. How
ever, I believe the narrower prob
lem of unemployment can he
largely solved fairly quickly with
out the comprehensive kind of
planning that Myrdal envisages.
PROBLEM (2) ABOVE, th e
maintenance of stable prices as
demand and output are increased,
is treated in a rather fuzzy way
by Myrdal. He talks about the?
possibility of price and wage con
trols and/or more complete or
ganization of consumer, producer,
and workers' groups to balance
their bargaining powers, as m the
Swedish case. The alternatives
available to a small culturally
homogenous country like Sweden
are very different to those of the
large American economy. The
many political stalemates between
the President and Congress are
particularly ill-suited to the dire'l
administration of economic regu
lations by the Federal govern
ment—witness the administrative
chaos in existing federal regula
tory agencies such as the Federal
Power Commission and the Inter
state Commerce Commission. Per
mitting worker, producer, and
consumer groups to organize and
bargain in large units to act as
countervailing forces need not
lead to peaceful and efficient de
cision making in the U.S. as it
does in Sweden. Myrdal eschews
outright reliance on competitive
market forces and asks if the
American government "should not
now be prepared to tone down
its rather fruitless fight against
monopoly but instead ask for a
share in controlling administered
prices . . . ?" To this the reviewer
disagrees and suggests that the
American economy is sufficiently
large, unlike Sweden, to support
many competing business firms
of an economically viable size. In
an appropriate legal environment
with vigorously enforced anti
trust laws, effective competition
among business firms would be
ensured. Monopoly economic and
political power given to previously
underdog groups has been abused,
e.g., farmers and craft unions.
Groups having concentrated pow
er to set wages and prices do
make full employment without in
flation harder to achieve, and thus
attempts to achieve full employ-
