# Peruvian President Lessens Leftist Parties' Importance
## 
### STUART RAWLINGS 
(Editor'* Note: This is the
first of a series of four articles
written on Peru by Stuart Rawl
ings. Mr. Rawlinffs has just re
turned from five months in
Peru, and he now lives in the
Latin American House of Stern
Hall. An undergraduate in eco
nomics, he is Chairman of the
Latin American Desk of the lIK,
ami he works on the Cuban Sec
tion of the Hispanic American
Report.)
There are three principal par
ties on Peru's radical left, The
Partido Comnnista Peruan o
(PCP) is Peru's communist party,
and it reportedly takes orders
from Moscow. It also publishes a
bi-monthly paper called "Unidad,"
and it supports Peru's newly
elected President, Belaunde Terry.
The Frente Izquierdista Revolu
cionaria (FIR) is the Trotskiist
Party (perhaps influenced by Pe
king) that the guerilla leader-
Hugo Blanco led before he was
caught last May. This party ad
vocates revolution right now, and
it does not get along with the
communist party. Finally, the
Movimiento Izquierdista Revolu
cionaria (MIR) is a party, quite
popular with students which also
advocates revolution but not right
now. This last party doesn't seem
to have any foreign affiliations,
and it maintains friendly relations
with both the PCP and the FIR.
All three parlies are active inside
unions and student government,
and at the moment they are en
couraging the Indians to invade
and settle on private property.
Aside from major differences
over relations with Russia and
Red China, the parties disagree
on two issues. 1.) To what extent
should there be nationalization?
Should all companies be expro
priated or just the large ones of
the American ones or the ones
who have evaded taxes? Will there
be any compensation for these
companies, and should foreign in
vestment be discouraged? 2.)
What agricultural system is best?
Should the new cooperatives be
state-owned, or should each one
be autonomous, or should each
Indian family be allowed to keep
part of his land, and will he be
compensated for the land he lost.
UNTIL RECENTLY leftist par
ties have had little influence in
Peru. The first leftist party was
the APRA party formed by Vic
tor Raul Hay a de la Torre in
1921, but forty years of repression
and recent compromise politics
have converted this party to con
servatism. The communist party,
started ten years ago, was banned
until last year; and the MIR and
FIR are only about three years
old. Actually neither of these lat
ter three parties is in itself very
powerful, but they all are trying
to represent the potentially strong
lower classes in Peru.
Belaunde Terry is the most left
ist President Peru has had in a
long time. He is carrying out an
aggressive agrarian reform pro
gram and is forcing one of the
largest American companies( an
affiliate of Standard Oil of New
Jersey) to pay forty years worth
of back taxes. Although only ac
cepted by the first of Peru's left
st parties, he seems to be bridging
the gap between conservative and
leftist elements in Peru. 'With

There are three principal par
ties on Peru's radical left, The
Partido Comnnista Peruan o
(PCP) is Peru's communist party,
and it reportedly takes orders
from Moscow. It also publishes a
bi-monthly paper called "Unidad,"
and it supports Peru's newly
elected President, Belaunde Terry.
The Frente Izquierdista Revolu
cionaria (FIR) is the Trotskiist
Party (perhaps influenced by Pe
king) that the guerilla leader-
Hugo Blanco led before he was
caught last May. This party ad
vocates revolution right now, and
it does not get along with the
communist party. Finally, the
Movimiento Izquierdista Revolu
cionaria (MIR) is a party, quite
popular with students which also
advocates revolution but not right
now. This last party doesn't seem
to have any foreign affiliations,
and it maintains friendly relations
with both the PCP and the FIR.

unions and student government,
and at the moment they are en
couraging the Indians to invade
and settle on private property.
Aside from major differences
over relations with Russia and
Red China, the parties disagree
on two issues. 1.) To what extent
should there be nationalization?
Should all companies be expro
priated or just the large ones of
the American ones or the ones
who have evaded taxes? Will there
be any compensation for these
companies, and should foreign in
vestment be discouraged? 2.)
What agricultural system is best?
Should the new cooperatives be
state-owned, or should each one
be autonomous, or should each
Indian family be allowed to keep
part of his land, and will he be
compensated for the land he lost.

ties have had little influence in
Peru. The first leftist party was
the APRA party formed by Vic

lower classes in Peru.

The Frente Izquierdista Revolu
cionaria (FIR) is the Trotskiist
Party (perhaps influenced by Pe
king) that the guerilla leader-
Hugo Blanco led before he was
caught last May. This party ad
vocates revolution right now, and
it does not get along with the
communist party. Finally, the
Movimiento Izquierdista Revolu
cionaria (MIR) is a party, quite
popular with students which also
advocates revolution but not right
now. This last party doesn't seem
to have any foreign affiliations,
and it maintains friendly relations
with both the PCP and the FIR.
All three parlies are active inside
unions and student government,
and at the moment they are en
couraging the Indians to invade
and settle on private property.
Aside from major differences
over relations with Russia and
Red China, the parties disagree
on two issues. 1.) To what extent
should there be nationalization?
Should all companies be expro
priated or just the large ones of
the American ones or the ones
who have evaded taxes? Will there
be any compensation for these
companies, and should foreign in
vestment be discouraged? 2.)
What agricultural system is best?
Should the new cooperatives be
state-owned, or should each one
be autonomous, or should each
Indian family be allowed to keep
part of his land, and will he be
compensated for the land he lost.
UNTIL RECENTLY leftist par
ties have had little influence in
Peru. The first leftist party was
the APRA party formed by Vic
tor Raul Hay a de la Torre in
1921, but forty years of repression
and recent compromise politics
have converted this party to con
servatism. The communist party,
started ten years ago, was banned
until last year; and the MIR and
FIR are only about three years
old. Actually neither of these lat
ter three parties is in itself very
powerful, but they all are trying
to represent the potentially strong
lower classes in Peru.
Belaunde Terry is the most left
ist President Peru has had in a
long time. He is carrying out an
aggressive agrarian reform pro
gram and is forcing one of the
largest American companies( an
affiliate of Standard Oil of New
Jersey) to pay forty years worth
of back taxes. Although only ac
cepted by the first of Peru's left
st parties, he seems to be bridging
the gap between conservative and
leftist elements in Peru. 'With

the natural sciences, would agree
with this.
Myrdal touches on many issues
I have not discussed, including
foreign policy problems. But his
main effort is directed at describ

peculiarly upside down to a Marx

of the latter.

and FIR have diminished in im

overdue revolution seems to be
arriving peacefully.
