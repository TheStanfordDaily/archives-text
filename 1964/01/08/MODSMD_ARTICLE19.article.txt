# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## As UCLA Goes So Doesn't Stanford 
### 
— —_______ Justin Beck
UCLA announced some weeks ago that a new five million dollar
gym, called in a press release, "a spectular new 13,500-seat multi
purpose Memorial Activities Center," is going to be built on their
campus by the 1965 basketball season. While their Memorial Activi
ties Center is coming too late to house UCLA's spectacular basket
ball team of this year, no doubt the Bruins will find more good ball
players to fill their new precast concrete palace in the future.
Like UCLA, this school is planning a new Pavilion, although on
a slightly less ambitious scale. Stanford's plans call for a modest
building seating 6-8,000 and costing $1,750,000, lacking frills like
UCLA's handball courts, wrestling room and athletic offices. There
is one other major difference between the two schools' plans. UCLA
has its money and is planning on starting construction this year.
Stanford's athletic department hasn't gotten its money yet. and so,
as might be expected in this cold, commercial world, the men's Ath
letic Pavilion is still a figment of some architect's imagination. There
isn't even a PACE sign up yet to mark the spot where the modest
new Pavilion will eventually be built.
ATHLETIC' DEPARTMENT NEEDS PHILANTHROPIST
Until PACE gives the Athletic Department the money or some
body with a million dollars or so to give away decides that Stanford
really needs a decent place to play basketball, Tribe cagers, good,
bad or indifferent, are going to have to play their spori in the cur
rent cozy, timeworn Pavilion.
Not that the Pavilion is all bad. It is big enough to squeeze a
couple of basketball teams, some coaches, several sports writers, ice
cream vendors, cheerleaders and other assorted odds and ends into
the building along with a handful of cash customers.
There is even space enough for a basketball court. It is a very
comforting place to play basketball. Playing before a crowd might

tend to make a person nervous, and no halfway decent crowd could
ever squeeze into Stanford's 40 year old Pavilion.
CAN'T DRAW NATION'S COOI) TEAMS
It is true that some pretentiously affuent hifih schools in this
country do have bigger gyms, as,do most colleges. Bui if they wish
to show off second rate teams in first rate showcases ihat is their
business. Stanford prefers to Have a first rate team in a second rate
showcase.
It is also true that the Pavilion's small capacity makes basketball
a financial hardship case at Stanford. A full slate of capacity home
crowds brings in hardly enough money to keep the team in basket
balls. While it's ihe cagers that win the games, it's the football team,
pa lying in the pleasant 90.000 seat football stadium, that brings in
the gravy. And, unfortunately Coach Howie Dallmar, unlike Charles
O. Finley, owner of the Kansas City (Louisville) Athletics, cannot
threaten to move his team to Louisville. Cincinnati, or even San
Mateo it the planned Pavilion is not soon built.
But if the Stanford basketball team has to play in the Pavilion,
nobody else has to, and few top teams have shown any interest in
even traveling across the street, much less across the country for
the privilege of playing basketball in a cigar box. Not that they have
anything against Stanford's private cigar box; the fact that it is
uglv and outdated could not affect them in the least.
What does trouble them is the crowd in the aforementioned cigar
box. It numbers 2,500 persons and in comparison to UCLA's hoped
for 13,000, Illinois' 15,000, and Podunk U's 10,000, it is a rather slen
der crowd, as slender as an athletic director's bank account if he had
to depend upon such crowds to pay his salary.
UCLA'S NEW PLANT IS "AUDITORIUM"
One doesn't even have to be a basketball fan to envy UCLA and
their air-conditioned marvel. Their Chancellor, Franklin' Murphy, ex
plained why UCLA needed the place without even mentioning basket
ball. which it is granted is sort of like describing the Roman Colis
sium without mentioning gladiators. Said Dr. Murphy. "The new
Memorial Center will provide a long-needed, multi-purpose activities
area Which will accommodate large numbers of students for the
University's many academic and recreational functions," Not bad. and
for only five million.
If UCLA's gym can be called an auditorium and be user! for "Com
mencement and Charter Day, guest speakers, student forums, and
many other related University-sponsored activities," so could Stan
ford's. And not only is the planned Pavilion just as versatile, it's
also a lot cheaper. The only problem is that everybody has been call
ing it an Athletic Pavilion, while it is actually an Activities Center.
After Commencement, and the guest speakers, the basketball team
would be lucky to sneak in for a half-hour practice.
TERRIBLE ACOUSTICS NECESSITATE NEW "CENTER"
Since the last guest speaker to brave the acoustics of our cramped
Pavilion, a Mr. Buckley, left the University feeling more like a vic
tim than a guest, it seems that Stanford does need an Activities
Cenler, especially one that seats 6-8,000, can be used for basketball,
and is some distance from the band shack.
But the Stanford Men's Athletic Pavilion does not seat 6,000 or
five, or even four thousand. It is a small, ugly, 40 year old build
ing, that seats 2,500 people in a university of 10.000. It provides a
decent place to hold registration, but, that, sadly enough, even that
meager assignment taxes the buildings scanty facilities. It is not
nearly enough for basketball games, guest speakers, or other Uni
versity activities. Maybe it once was, in the 1930'5; but now it js
so outdated that it can serve as a center of campus life only
three days of the year on Registration Day. In this kind of situation I
a new Pavilion at any price would be a bargain.

comforting place to play basketball. Playing before a crowd might

tend to make a person nervous, and no halfway decent crowd could
ever squeeze into Stanford's 40 year old Pavilion.
CAN'T DRAW NATION'S COOI) TEAMS
It is true that some pretentiously affuent hifih schools in this
country do have bigger gyms, as,do most colleges. Bui if they wish
to show off second rate teams in first rate showcases ihat is their
business. Stanford prefers to Have a first rate team in a second rate
showcase.
It is also true that the Pavilion's small capacity makes basketball
a financial hardship case at Stanford. A full slate of capacity home
crowds brings in hardly enough money to keep the team in basket
balls. While it's ihe cagers that win the games, it's the football team,
pa lying in the pleasant 90.000 seat football stadium, that brings in
the gravy. And, unfortunately Coach Howie Dallmar, unlike Charles
O. Finley, owner of the Kansas City (Louisville) Athletics, cannot
threaten to move his team to Louisville. Cincinnati, or even San
Mateo it the planned Pavilion is not soon built.
But if the Stanford basketball team has to play in the Pavilion,
nobody else has to, and few top teams have shown any interest in
even traveling across the street, much less across the country for
the privilege of playing basketball in a cigar box. Not that they have
anything against Stanford's private cigar box; the fact that it is
uglv and outdated could not affect them in the least.
What does trouble them is the crowd in the aforementioned cigar
box. It numbers 2,500 persons and in comparison to UCLA's hoped
for 13,000, Illinois' 15,000, and Podunk U's 10,000, it is a rather slen
der crowd, as slender as an athletic director's bank account if he had
to depend upon such crowds to pay his salary.
UCLA'S NEW PLANT IS "AUDITORIUM"
One doesn't even have to be a basketball fan to envy UCLA and
their air-conditioned marvel. Their Chancellor, Franklin' Murphy, ex
plained why UCLA needed the place without even mentioning basket
ball. which it is granted is sort of like describing the Roman Colis
sium without mentioning gladiators. Said Dr. Murphy. "The new
Memorial Center will provide a long-needed, multi-purpose activities
area Which will accommodate large numbers of students for the
University's many academic and recreational functions," Not bad. and
for only five million.
If UCLA's gym can be called an auditorium and be user! for "Com
mencement and Charter Day, guest speakers, student forums, and
many other related University-sponsored activities," so could Stan
ford's. And not only is the planned Pavilion just as versatile, it's
also a lot cheaper. The only problem is that everybody has been call
ing it an Athletic Pavilion, while it is actually an Activities Center.
After Commencement, and the guest speakers, the basketball team
would be lucky to sneak in for a half-hour practice.
TERRIBLE ACOUSTICS NECESSITATE NEW "CENTER"
Since the last guest speaker to brave the acoustics of our cramped
Pavilion, a Mr. Buckley, left the University feeling more like a vic
tim than a guest, it seems that Stanford does need an Activities
Cenler, especially one that seats 6-8,000, can be used for basketball,
and is some distance from the band shack.
But the Stanford Men's Athletic Pavilion does not seat 6,000 or
five, or even four thousand. It is a small, ugly, 40 year old build
ing, that seats 2,500 people in a university of 10.000. It provides a
decent place to hold registration, but, that, sadly enough, even that
meager assignment taxes the buildings scanty facilities. It is not
nearly enough for basketball games, guest speakers, or other Uni
versity activities. Maybe it once was, in the 1930'5; but now it js
so outdated that it can serve as a center of campus life only
three days of the year on Registration Day. In this kind of situation I
a new Pavilion at any price would be a bargain.

UCLA announced some weeks ago that a new five million dollar
gym, called in a press release, "a spectular new 13,500-seat multi
purpose Memorial Activities Center," is going to be built on their
campus by the 1965 basketball season. While their Memorial Activi
ties Center is coming too late to house UCLA's spectacular basket
ball team of this year, no doubt the Bruins will find more good ball
players to fill their new precast concrete palace in the future.
Like UCLA, this school is planning a new Pavilion, although on
a slightly less ambitious scale. Stanford's plans call for a modest
building seating 6-8,000 and costing $1,750,000, lacking frills like
UCLA's handball courts, wrestling room and athletic offices. There
is one other major difference between the two schools' plans. UCLA
has its money and is planning on starting construction this year.
Stanford's athletic department hasn't gotten its money yet. and so,
as might be expected in this cold, commercial world, the men's Ath
letic Pavilion is still a figment of some architect's imagination. There
isn't even a PACE sign up yet to mark the spot where the modest
new Pavilion will eventually be built.
ATHLETIC' DEPARTMENT NEEDS PHILANTHROPIST
Until PACE gives the Athletic Department the money or some
body with a million dollars or so to give away decides that Stanford
really needs a decent place to play basketball, Tribe cagers, good,
bad or indifferent, are going to have to play their spori in the cur
rent cozy, timeworn Pavilion.
Not that the Pavilion is all bad. It is big enough to squeeze a
couple of basketball teams, some coaches, several sports writers, ice
cream vendors, cheerleaders and other assorted odds and ends into
the building along with a handful of cash customers.
There is even space enough for a basketball court. It is a very

to depend upon such crowds to pay his salary.
UCLA'S NEW PLANT IS "AUDITORIUM"
One doesn't even have to be a basketball fan to envy UCLA and
their air-conditioned marvel. Their Chancellor, Franklin' Murphy, ex
plained why UCLA needed the place without even mentioning basket
ball. which it is granted is sort of like describing the Roman Colis
sium without mentioning gladiators. Said Dr. Murphy. "The new
Memorial Center will provide a long-needed, multi-purpose activities
area Which will accommodate large numbers of students for the
University's many academic and recreational functions," Not bad. and
for only five million.
If UCLA's gym can be called an auditorium and be user! for "Com
mencement and Charter Day, guest speakers, student forums, and
many other related University-sponsored activities," so could Stan
ford's. And not only is the planned Pavilion just as versatile, it's
also a lot cheaper. The only problem is that everybody has been call
ing it an Athletic Pavilion, while it is actually an Activities Center.
After Commencement, and the guest speakers, the basketball team
would be lucky to sneak in for a half-hour practice.
TERRIBLE ACOUSTICS NECESSITATE NEW "CENTER"
Since the last guest speaker to brave the acoustics of our cramped
Pavilion, a Mr. Buckley, left the University feeling more like a vic
tim than a guest, it seems that Stanford does need an Activities
Cenler, especially one that seats 6-8,000, can be used for basketball,
and is some distance from the band shack.
But the Stanford Men's Athletic Pavilion does not seat 6,000 or
five, or even four thousand. It is a small, ugly, 40 year old build
ing, that seats 2,500 people in a university of 10.000. It provides a
decent place to hold registration, but, that, sadly enough, even that
meager assignment taxes the buildings scanty facilities. It is not
nearly enough for basketball games, guest speakers, or other Uni
versity activities. Maybe it once was, in the 1930'5; but now it js
so outdated that it can serve as a center of campus life only
three days of the year on Registration Day. In this kind of situation I
a new Pavilion at any price would be a bargain.

UCLA announced some weeks ago that a new five million dollar
gym, called in a press release, "a spectular new 13,500-seat multi
purpose Memorial Activities Center," is going to be built on their
campus by the 1965 basketball season. While their Memorial Activi
ties Center is coming too late to house UCLA's spectacular basket
ball team of this year, no doubt the Bruins will find more good ball
players to fill their new precast concrete palace in the future.
Like UCLA, this school is planning a new Pavilion, although on
a slightly less ambitious scale. Stanford's plans call for a modest
building seating 6-8,000 and costing $1,750,000, lacking frills like
UCLA's handball courts, wrestling room and athletic offices. There
is one other major difference between the two schools' plans. UCLA
has its money and is planning on starting construction this year.
Stanford's athletic department hasn't gotten its money yet. and so,
as might be expected in this cold, commercial world, the men's Ath
letic Pavilion is still a figment of some architect's imagination. There
isn't even a PACE sign up yet to mark the spot where the modest
new Pavilion will eventually be built.
ATHLETIC' DEPARTMENT NEEDS PHILANTHROPIST
Until PACE gives the Athletic Department the money or some
body with a million dollars or so to give away decides that Stanford
really needs a decent place to play basketball, Tribe cagers, good,
bad or indifferent, are going to have to play their spori in the cur
rent cozy, timeworn Pavilion.
Not that the Pavilion is all bad. It is big enough to squeeze a
couple of basketball teams, some coaches, several sports writers, ice
cream vendors, cheerleaders and other assorted odds and ends into
the building along with a handful of cash customers.
There is even space enough for a basketball court. It is a very
comforting place to play basketball. Playing before a crowd might

tend to make a person nervous, and no halfway decent crowd could
ever squeeze into Stanford's 40 year old Pavilion.
CAN'T DRAW NATION'S COOI) TEAMS
It is true that some pretentiously affuent hifih schools in this
country do have bigger gyms, as,do most colleges. Bui if they wish
to show off second rate teams in first rate showcases ihat is their
business. Stanford prefers to Have a first rate team in a second rate
showcase.
It is also true that the Pavilion's small capacity makes basketball
a financial hardship case at Stanford. A full slate of capacity home
crowds brings in hardly enough money to keep the team in basket
balls. While it's ihe cagers that win the games, it's the football team,
pa lying in the pleasant 90.000 seat football stadium, that brings in
the gravy. And, unfortunately Coach Howie Dallmar, unlike Charles
O. Finley, owner of the Kansas City (Louisville) Athletics, cannot
threaten to move his team to Louisville. Cincinnati, or even San
Mateo it the planned Pavilion is not soon built.
But if the Stanford basketball team has to play in the Pavilion,
nobody else has to, and few top teams have shown any interest in
even traveling across the street, much less across the country for
the privilege of playing basketball in a cigar box. Not that they have
anything against Stanford's private cigar box; the fact that it is
uglv and outdated could not affect them in the least.
What does trouble them is the crowd in the aforementioned cigar
box. It numbers 2,500 persons and in comparison to UCLA's hoped
for 13,000, Illinois' 15,000, and Podunk U's 10,000, it is a rather slen
der crowd, as slender as an athletic director's bank account if he had
