# Machine Evaluates Student Progress
## 
### 
A classroom machine with feed
back enables the instructor to de
t ermine how he is "getting
j through" to his students and also
grades the examinations as they
I are being given, the University of
California Clip Sheet imports.
Dr. Charles Bridgeman uses
the machine in his anatomy
classes at the UCLA Medical
School. He designed and developed
the device while at the University
of Kansas Medical Center.
Students are provided with five
position response switches which
are connected to a panel resembl
ing a vertically elongated switch
board. Each student is repre
sented on the panel by five lights
and a counter for correct answers.
Multiple choice questions pro
jected from slifles may be inter
spersed throughout the lecture.
The student indicates his answer
by flipping his switch to one of
the five positions. This lights up
one of the five lights by each
student's place on the 4 panel The
panel, of course, can be seen only
by the instructor.
The instructor can tell at a
glance the approximate number
of correct responses, and a read
out meter gives him a precise per
centage of right and wrong an
swers. Thus he is able to evaluate
absorbtion of subject matter by
his students.
During an examination, coun
ters at each student's place on
the panel keep a running count
of correct responses. By the end
of the examination each student's
score is posted.
