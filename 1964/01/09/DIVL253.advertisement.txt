Don't put this article aside just yet, for the writers are talking
not just about you, but about themselves, too, and all the rest of
our fellow men. In contrast to the statements made by many lib
eral churchmen today, the Bible says that not every man is a child
of God, but only those who have been born-again (Rom. 8:14).
Neither is every man righteous, for this is awarded to man only
through his faith in Christ (2 Cor. 5:21). God sees the world much
differently than many people see it. Yet we can believe what He
says about man not only because what the Bible is invariably
accurate (any challenge to this statement welcomed), but also be
cause a careful look at the world, and at oneself leaves no other
alternative but to conclude that man is truly sinful not only by
behavior, but by his very nature.
"Because they have not seen fit to acknowledge God, he has given
them up to their own depraved reason. This leads them to break
all rules of conduct. They are filled with every kind of injustice,
mischief, rapacity, and malice; they are one mass of mischief,
they show no loyalty to parents, no conscience, no fidelity to their
plighted word; they are without natural affection and without
pity. They know well enough the just decree of God, that those
who behave like this deserve to die, and yet they do it; not only
so, they actually applaud such practices . . . There is no just man,
not one; no one who understands, no one who seeks God. All have
swerved aside, all alike have become debased; There is no one to
show kindness; no, not one. Their throat is an open grave, they
use their tongues for treachery, adders' venom is on their lips,
and their mouth is full or bitter curses. Their feet hasten to shed
blood, ruin and misery lie along their paths, they are strangers to
the high-road of peace, and reverance of God does not enter their
thoughts . . . For all alike have sinned and are deprived of the
divine splendor, and all are justified by God's free grace alone,
through his act of liberation alone in the person of Christ Jesus.
For God designed Him to be the means of expiating sin by His
sacrificial death, effective through faith. God meant by this to
demonstrate his justice now in the present, showing that he is
both himself just and justifies any man who puts his faith in
Jesus." Romans 1:28-32, 3:11-18, 3:23-16.
Some people are not quite prepared to believe in the fall of man,
but they must surely be willing to admit that everyone has sinned
and is capable of great evil. Some claim that sin is just human
nature, the remedy for which is love and forgiveness. Christians
agree, but emphasize that the forgiveness and love which are
needed are God's forgiveness and love, for all sin is against God:
"Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindness:
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity and
cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions,
and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, and thee only, have
I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be
justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest."
Ps. 51:1-4.
Unless we meet God in Christ Jesus on His terms of justice our
sins will cost us an eternity in hell, for that is just what death is
all about!
"For sin pays a wage, and the wage is death, but God gives freely,
and his gift is eternal life, in union with Christ Jesus our Lord."
Rom. 6:23 NE.

cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions,
and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, and thee only, have
I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be
justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest."
Ps. 51:1-4.
Unless we meet God in Christ Jesus on His terms of justice our
sins will cost us an eternity in hell, for that is just what death is
all about!
"For sin pays a wage, and the wage is death, but God gives freely,
and his gift is eternal life, in union with Christ Jesus our Lord."
Rom. 6:23 NE.

Don't put this article aside just yet, for the writers are talking
not just about you, but about themselves, too, and all the rest of
our fellow men. In contrast to the statements made by many lib
eral churchmen today, the Bible says that not every man is a child
of God, but only those who have been born-again (Rom. 8:14).
Neither is every man righteous, for this is awarded to man only
through his faith in Christ (2 Cor. 5:21). God sees the world much
differently than many people see it. Yet we can believe what He
says about man not only because what the Bible is invariably
accurate (any challenge to this statement welcomed), but also be
cause a careful look at the world, and at oneself leaves no other
alternative but to conclude that man is truly sinful not only by
behavior, but by his very nature.
"Because they have not seen fit to acknowledge God, he has given
them up to their own depraved reason. This leads them to break
all rules of conduct. They are filled with every kind of injustice,
mischief, rapacity, and malice; they are one mass of mischief,
they show no loyalty to parents, no conscience, no fidelity to their
plighted word; they are without natural affection and without
pity. They know well enough the just decree of God, that those
who behave like this deserve to die, and yet they do it; not only
so, they actually applaud such practices . . . There is no just man,
not one; no one who understands, no one who seeks God. All have
swerved aside, all alike have become debased; There is no one to
show kindness; no, not one. Their throat is an open grave, they
use their tongues for treachery, adders' venom is on their lips,
and their mouth is full or bitter curses. Their feet hasten to shed
blood, ruin and misery lie along their paths, they are strangers to
the high-road of peace, and reverance of God does not enter their
thoughts . . . For all alike have sinned and are deprived of the
divine splendor, and all are justified by God's free grace alone,
through his act of liberation alone in the person of Christ Jesus.
For God designed Him to be the means of expiating sin by His
sacrificial death, effective through faith. God meant by this to
demonstrate his justice now in the present, showing that he is
both himself just and justifies any man who puts his faith in
Jesus." Romans 1:28-32, 3:11-18, 3:23-16.
Some people are not quite prepared to believe in the fall of man,
but they must surely be willing to admit that everyone has sinned
and is capable of great evil. Some claim that sin is just human
nature, the remedy for which is love and forgiveness. Christians
agree, but emphasize that the forgiveness and love which are
needed are God's forgiveness and love, for all sin is against God:
"Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindness:
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity and
cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions,
and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, and thee only, have
I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be
justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest."

sacrificial death, effective through faith. God meant by this to
demonstrate his justice now in the present, showing that he is
both himself just and justifies any man who puts his faith in
Jesus." Romans 1:28-32, 3:11-18, 3:23-16.
Some people are not quite prepared to believe in the fall of man,
but they must surely be willing to admit that everyone has sinned
and is capable of great evil. Some claim that sin is just human
nature, the remedy for which is love and forgiveness. Christians
agree, but emphasize that the forgiveness and love which are
needed are God's forgiveness and love, for all sin is against God:
"Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindness:
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity and
cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions,
and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, and thee only, have
I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be
justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest."
Ps. 51:1-4.
Unless we meet God in Christ Jesus on His terms of justice our
sins will cost us an eternity in hell, for that is just what death is
all about!
"For sin pays a wage, and the wage is death, but God gives freely,
and his gift is eternal life, in union with Christ Jesus our Lord."
Rom. 6:23 NE.

SINNERS ALL
Don't put this article aside just yet, for the writers are talking
not just about you, but about themselves, too, and all the rest of
our fellow men. In contrast to the statements made by many lib
eral churchmen today, the Bible says that not every man is a child
of God, but only those who have been born-again (Rom. 8:14).
Neither is every man righteous, for this is awarded to man only
through his faith in Christ (2 Cor. 5:21). God sees the world much
differently than many people see it. Yet we can believe what He
says about man not only because what the Bible is invariably
accurate (any challenge to this statement welcomed), but also be
cause a careful look at the world, and at oneself leaves no other
alternative but to conclude that man is truly sinful not only by
behavior, but by his very nature.
"Because they have not seen fit to acknowledge God, he has given
them up to their own depraved reason. This leads them to break
all rules of conduct. They are filled with every kind of injustice,
mischief, rapacity, and malice; they are one mass of mischief,
they show no loyalty to parents, no conscience, no fidelity to their
plighted word; they are without natural affection and without
pity. They know well enough the just decree of God, that those
who behave like this deserve to die, and yet they do it; not only
so, they actually applaud such practices . . . There is no just man,
not one; no one who understands, no one who seeks God. All have
swerved aside, all alike have become debased; There is no one to
show kindness; no, not one. Their throat is an open grave, they
use their tongues for treachery, adders' venom is on their lips,
and their mouth is full or bitter curses. Their feet hasten to shed
blood, ruin and misery lie along their paths, they are strangers to
the high-road of peace, and reverance of God does not enter their
thoughts . . . For all alike have sinned and are deprived of the
divine splendor, and all are justified by God's free grace alone,
through his act of liberation alone in the person of Christ Jesus.
For God designed Him to be the means of expiating sin by His
sacrificial death, effective through faith. God meant by this to
demonstrate his justice now in the present, showing that he is
both himself just and justifies any man who puts his faith in
Jesus." Romans 1:28-32, 3:11-18, 3:23-16.
