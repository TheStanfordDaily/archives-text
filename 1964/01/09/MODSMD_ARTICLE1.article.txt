# How Can Stanford Eliminate Religious Restrictions?
## 
### CHERYL OSHER BILL MOORE (First in a Series of 13 Articles) 
Is there a "religion issue" at Stanford?
In the Sept. 23 Daily last quarter a freshman wrote a
letter asking: "Is the school policy to bar all but one estab
lished church? Is Memorial Church truly non-denomina
tional? Where on campus are the Moslem, Buddhist and
Jewish services?"

This series has been prepared, in cooj>eratioii with
the LASSIJ Committee on Religion, by a five-man
team of DAILY staffers — including Bruce Campbell,
Jim Ilorne, Hill Moore (chairman), Cheryl Osher and
Mike Roster.

THF FRESHMAN SAID she was particularly concerned
about "the inconsistency between 'Stanford Handbook'
statements that Memorial Church 'has no denominational

ties whatever' and the fact that the church is definitely
Protestant in nature."
By October the Daily was asking on its editorial page:
Why was Stanford a university "without freedom of re
ligion?" And why aren't non-Protestant religious groups
allowed on campus?
ASSU President Bud Weclin, writing in the "Faculty-
Staff Newsletter," stated, "Not only here, but all through
the United States as well, there is a rising interest among
sudents about such vital questions as religion."
AND SO LASSIJ appointed a committee to study in
cooperation with a committee from the Daily — the Uni
versity's religious program.
Said Weclin:
"It is generally felt among students, 1 believe, that the
religious character of the University is quite poorly de
fined. Although it could bo argued that Stanford purports
to have no religious character and that therefore it should
remain ill defined, it is perhaps of value to note that Mrs.
Stanford doubtless intended the University to remain non
sectarian within the Protestant sect. So. in fact, is the
case now. Perhaps, however, we should move to a more

consistent interpretation that would reflect better the
multi-religious community that we really are.
"Insofar as any i-eligious character is imparted to the
campus, it is done by Memorial Church. This of course
raises the alternatives of changing the nature of the church
to achieve such consistency, defining a religious character
to the campus, or creating an atmosphere in which there
can be a fulfilment of what is purported to be Stanford's
'non-sectarian' nature.
"THE LATTER ALTERNATIVE, which is plainly the
more feasible, suggests that some alteration in the regula
tion regarding worship by religious groups on campus
might be desired. This does not imply that the construction
of great numbers of buildings would be necessary to achieve
such an end. Rather, it suggests that there may be no
inherent justification for the restrictions now imposed on
religious groups. It is this latter question to which the
committee will bo devoting a good share of its time both
because of its long-term importance and because of the
recent instances relating directly to it."
There arc a number of people on campus, however, who
question the issue's importance. Chaplain Robert Minto

summed up this view:
"I'M NOT IN FAVOR of the change advocated by some.
I don't see a need for it. The major problem is that most
students don't care for religion. ... At present, with the
growth of cooperation through CRA (Committee on Religi
ous Affairs) and the council (in which Minto meets with
Stanford area ministers), there are infinite possibilities of
development under the existing system.
"I'm not inflexible. . . . We're exploring new ways of
religious cooperation on campus."
The Daily, too, will be exploring new ways of coopera
tion — and will bring to its readers the results of the joint
LASSU Daily committees' research on the role of religion
at Stanford.
IX PARTICULAR, these points will be covered:
• A brief history of religion at the University, with
special emphasis on the meaning and intent of "non-sec
tarian" in Stanford documents.
• The opinions of faculty, students and clergy on the
present policy.
• A comparison of Stanford policy with that of other
universities around the country.

"It is generally felt among students, 1 believe, that the
religious character of the University is quite poorly de
fined. Although it could bo argued that Stanford purports
to have no religious character and that therefore it should
remain ill defined, it is perhaps of value to note that Mrs.
Stanford doubtless intended the University to remain non
sectarian within the Protestant sect. So. in fact, is the
case now. Perhaps, however, we should move to a more

consistent interpretation that would reflect better the
multi-religious community that we really are.
"Insofar as any i-eligious character is imparted to the
campus, it is done by Memorial Church. This of course
raises the alternatives of changing the nature of the church
to achieve such consistency, defining a religious character
to the campus, or creating an atmosphere in which there
can be a fulfilment of what is purported to be Stanford's
'non-sectarian' nature.
"THE LATTER ALTERNATIVE, which is plainly the
more feasible, suggests that some alteration in the regula
tion regarding worship by religious groups on campus
might be desired. This does not imply that the construction
of great numbers of buildings would be necessary to achieve
such an end. Rather, it suggests that there may be no
inherent justification for the restrictions now imposed on
religious groups. It is this latter question to which the
committee will bo devoting a good share of its time both
because of its long-term importance and because of the
recent instances relating directly to it."
There arc a number of people on campus, however, who
question the issue's importance. Chaplain Robert Minto

summed up this view:
"I'M NOT IN FAVOR of the change advocated by some.
I don't see a need for it. The major problem is that most
students don't care for religion. ... At present, with the
growth of cooperation through CRA (Committee on Religi
ous Affairs) and the council (in which Minto meets with
Stanford area ministers), there are infinite possibilities of
development under the existing system.
"I'm not inflexible. . . . We're exploring new ways of
religious cooperation on campus."
The Daily, too, will be exploring new ways of coopera
tion — and will bring to its readers the results of the joint
LASSU Daily committees' research on the role of religion
at Stanford.
IX PARTICULAR, these points will be covered:
• A brief history of religion at the University, with
special emphasis on the meaning and intent of "non-sec
tarian" in Stanford documents.
• The opinions of faculty, students and clergy on the
present policy.
• A comparison of Stanford policy with that of other
universities around the country.
Is there a "religion issue" at Stanford?
In the Sept. 23 Daily last quarter a freshman wrote a
letter asking: "Is the school policy to bar all but one estab
lished church? Is Memorial Church truly non-denomina
tional? Where on campus are the Moslem, Buddhist and
Jewish services?"

This series has been prepared, in cooj>eratioii with
the LASSIJ Committee on Religion, by a five-man
team of DAILY staffers — including Bruce Campbell,
Jim Ilorne, Hill Moore (chairman), Cheryl Osher and
Mike Roster.

THF FRESHMAN SAID she was particularly concerned
about "the inconsistency between 'Stanford Handbook'
statements that Memorial Church 'has no denominational

ties whatever' and the fact that the church is definitely
Protestant in nature."
By October the Daily was asking on its editorial page:
Why was Stanford a university "without freedom of re
ligion?" And why aren't non-Protestant religious groups
allowed on campus?
ASSU President Bud Weclin, writing in the "Faculty-
Staff Newsletter," stated, "Not only here, but all through
the United States as well, there is a rising interest among
sudents about such vital questions as religion."
