# Permission Granted to Hillel For Controversial 'Meetings'
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
The Stanford Hillel Foundation,
after more than three months of
discussion, has been granted per
mission to hold "closed meetings"
on campus on topics which
were rejected in early October
when Hiey were referred to as
"courses."
When Hillel director Dr. Harry
i May applied for classrooms in
September for "courses" in Jew
ish History, Modern Conversa
tional Hebrew, and Recorder, his
request was rejected. May filed
his request under the Board of
Trustees ruling of last March per
mitting religious groups to hold
closed meetings in University fa
cilities. His request was denied
under another ruling, that formal
instruction on the campus may
be given only by those holding
University appointments.
HILLEL AS AN organization
as opposed to its director as an
individual then submitted a clar
ifying request for closed meet
ings on the same topics, which
has been approved.
A fourth "meeting topic," Is
raeli Folkdance, was requested
at that lime, but the President's
Committee on Student Affairs
and Services felt that this "did
not quite fit the context of the
original discussion," according to
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler. Presumably, this would
mean that the purpose of last
year's policy revision was broad
ening of "academic" as opposed
to "social" meetings. Winbigler

noted that the folk dance would
be acceptable as an open meeting
if it were sponsored by the I-Cen
ter, where the Hi 1 lei Foundation
had proposed to hold it.
When the Student Affairs and
Services Committee approved the
Hillel request at their November
14 meeting, they indicated that
the Student Committee on Reli
gious Affairs (CRA) should bo
consulted.
IT IS THROUGH the (JKA that
all open meetings of religious
groups must be processed, which
Winbigler feels is analogous to
Political Union's sponsorship of
all-campus political events. Dur
ing the closing days of dead week,
CRA stated their approval of the
campus Hillel meetings, which
are scheduled as of this week.
A "closed meeting" is defined
by Trustees policy as "... meet
ings which are limited to mem
bers of the group and to specific
ally invited guests . . Previous
to the March, 1963 Trustee ruling,
the religious groups could not
use university facilities for this
type of meeting. The general
University policy prohibits reli
gious worship services on the
campus other than those in
Memorial Church.
