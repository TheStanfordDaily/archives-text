# Sears Roebuck in Peru

### 
(This is the second of four articles on Peru written by Stuart
Rawlings, an undergraduate who lias just returned from five
months in Peru.)
Sears, Roebuck and Company opened its first Latin American
store in Havana. Cuba in 1952; and today it has 59 retail stores in
nine latin countries, having recently lost its seven in Cuba. The first
Peruvian store opened in 1955 with 350 employees; and today about
600 employees work in two stores, both in Lima.
Sears is a pioneer in Peru in many ways. First, all goods bear a
reasonable fixed price which cannot be lowered by bargaining.
Secondly, the buildings themselves are large, well lighted, and
efficiently organized; and thirdly almost all the articles are left
uncovered on the counters 窶馬ot behind glass. A large staff of sales
men guards the goods, and no more is stolen there than in U.S.
stores. Finally, Sears employees are paid according to how well they
work, and the ones who slack are fired.
In 1956, 90% of Sears' articles were imported into Peru; today
90% are bought from some 500 Peruvian companies which Sears
helps with advice and money. Although Sears sells a wide variety
of goods, furniture and hand tools are seldom bought in Peru. The
reason for a poor hand-tool market is that unlike Americans, Peru
vians of all classes generally dislike working with their hands.
SEARS' LABOR RELATIONS are so good that today Sears is
the only large company in Peru whose employees don't want a union.
In 1956 the company organized the "Asociacion Social de Personnel
Sears" to which all employees belong free of charge. This organiza
tion, backed by company funds, has built a recreation room, library,
parking lot and soccer and volleyball fields next to the store, and the
S Americans in the organization teach English twice a week to those
who want to learn. A credit cooperative was started in 1956 to which
60% of the employees now belong.
Perhaps most important of all is Sears' new profit-sharing plan.
Peruvian law did not recognize such a plan until Sears pushed its
plan through the Peruvian Congress last June. This plan enables
any employee to invest five percent of his salary in company stock,
and when he leaves the company the value of the stock will be re
turned. After two months of operation, the Sears Profit-Sharing
Plan had 99% of the employees owning 2% of the stock.
Sears is never open Sundays, and employees get another half day
off during the rest of the week. The minimum wage of $1 a day is
usually quadrupled in the first two years.
LAST FEBRUARY AN AFL-CIO labor man came to Sears in Peru
with the idea of starting a union for the company. But the Sears
employees unanimously refused because there is no work that a
union could do. and dues would be wasted. Throughout my whole
visit to Peru I heard nothing but compliments for Sears, and discus
sions with some thirty employees convinced me that Sears in Peru
is doing a tremendous job.

months in Peru.)
Sears, Roebuck and Company opened its first Latin American
store in Havana. Cuba in 1952; and today it has 59 retail stores in
nine latin countries, having recently lost its seven in Cuba. The first
Peruvian store opened in 1955 with 350 employees; and today about
600 employees work in two stores, both in Lima.
Sears is a pioneer in Peru in many ways. First, all goods bear a
reasonable fixed price which cannot be lowered by bargaining.
Secondly, the buildings themselves are large, well lighted, and
efficiently organized; and thirdly almost all the articles are left
uncovered on the counters 窶馬ot behind glass. A large staff of sales
men guards the goods, and no more is stolen there than in U.S.
stores. Finally, Sears employees are paid according to how well they
work, and the ones who slack are fired.
In 1956, 90% of Sears' articles were imported into Peru; today
90% are bought from some 500 Peruvian companies which Sears
helps with advice and money. Although Sears sells a wide variety
of goods, furniture and hand tools are seldom bought in Peru. The
reason for a poor hand-tool market is that unlike Americans, Peru
vians of all classes generally dislike working with their hands.
SEARS' LABOR RELATIONS are so good that today Sears is
the only large company in Peru whose employees don't want a union.
In 1956 the company organized the "Asociacion Social de Personnel
Sears" to which all employees belong free of charge. This organiza
tion, backed by company funds, has built a recreation room, library,
parking lot and soccer and volleyball fields next to the store, and the
S Americans in the organization teach English twice a week to those
who want to learn. A credit cooperative was started in 1956 to which
60% of the employees now belong.
Perhaps most important of all is Sears' new profit-sharing plan.
Peruvian law did not recognize such a plan until Sears pushed its
plan through the Peruvian Congress last June. This plan enables
any employee to invest five percent of his salary in company stock,
and when he leaves the company the value of the stock will be re
turned. After two months of operation, the Sears Profit-Sharing
Plan had 99% of the employees owning 2% of the stock.
Sears is never open Sundays, and employees get another half day
off during the rest of the week. The minimum wage of $1 a day is
usually quadrupled in the first two years.
LAST FEBRUARY AN AFL-CIO labor man came to Sears in Peru
with the idea of starting a union for the company. But the Sears
employees unanimously refused because there is no work that a
union could do. and dues would be wasted. Throughout my whole
visit to Peru I heard nothing but compliments for Sears, and discus
sions with some thirty employees convinced me that Sears in Peru
is doing a tremendous job.
