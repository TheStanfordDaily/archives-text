# STAFF OPINION
## Overseas Campi Rewarding, But Inadequate for Some 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR 
The eleventh session of Stan
ford in Germany which ended in
December was, with some reserva
tions, a tremendous success.
Nevertheless, it is apparent that
the present overseas program is
inadequate and requires supple
mentation.
Ninety pei'cent of the students
in Group XI count their six-month
stay on the Burg as "extremely
rewarding." Almost every phase
of the program was well planned
to make the very best use of the
valuable time spent in Europe.
Field trips to Rome, Czechoslo
vakia, Berlin and Bonn were well
prepared for and, for the most
part, well co-ordinated.
THE SUBJECT MATTER of
the courses offered at the German
campus was organized best to
prepare the students for their
experience and to utilize the en
vironment to further course in
struction. With a course in Ger
man history the first quarter and
in German political institutions
the second quarter, students were
well prepared to appreciate the
trip to Bonn, which fell during
the week that Konrad Adenauer
stepped down as Chancellor. The
Music 1 course first quarter en
abled students better to appreci
ate the tremendous cultural op
portunities of Europe while the
course in the history of the Eng
lish and German languages second
quarter gave the study of German
much greater meaning.
Finally, the relationship of the
Burg students to the village of
Beutelsbach and to students at
nearby colleges was very good
and provided a broad exposure to
the surrounding society.
Why, then, is the present pro
gram inadequate? Because in pro
viding an excellent program for
the greater number of students
it neglects and limits the oppor
tunities for the few who are cap
able of making much better use of
six months in Europe .
The Stanford Overseas Program
is unique among U.S. university
programs for overseas study be
cause it successfully gives almost
one third of the undergraduate
student body the opportunity to
spend six months in Europe, re
gardless of major. By taking the
minimum language requirement
even the physics major may at
tend one of the Stanford "trans
plants," losing no time or credits
and broadening his education and
outlook through exposure to an
other wav of life, another people.

THE PROGRAMS OF other
universities usually send the stu
dent directly to a foreign univer
sity for a semester or more of
study, often on an exchange pro
gram of some sort. But complica
tions often arise as to the validity
of credits and courses toward an
American degree. And such high
proficiency in the foreign lan
guage is required that usually
only the language major can take
advantage of the opportunity.
But in overcoming these dis
advantages of the direct exchange
setup, Stanford also loses the ad
vantages. Though the idea of giv
ing the many a better opportunity
is noble enough and ought cer
tainly to be continued, there are
nevertheless students who have
the proficiency in a language who
would gain much more from their
European experience if totally
immersed in the culture. But when
they are forced to live in a group
of students whose proficiency is
much lower, cut off to a certain
extent from the foreign culture—
to the extent, by the way, that
the campus is a "transplant" —
these students are severely
limited.
Furthermore, there is in every
overseas group a number of stu
dents who acquire a very high
proficiency after two or three
months and are ready to move into
a more concentrated atmosphere
—perhaps to begin then a semes
ter at a European university.
IT IS A POINT of fact that
most of the student criticism of
the Overseas Program has been
from the element that was not
adequately challenged at an over
seas campus and felt that much
better use could have been made
of the six months abroad. The
reaction to this criticism has in
the past been unfair, usually ig
noring any possibility that there
were valid grounds.
The Stanford Overseas Program
is very likely the best such pr o
gram in the country. But the
praise it has receiver! has tended
to drown the just criticism.
A study should be made of the
possibilities of supplementing the
present program with opportuni
ties for those who want to and
can make the effort to excel, to
go beyond what most students
can achieve. This may be done
through an exchange program or
through a combination of the pres
ent setup and the exchange idea.
As good as the present overseas
Program is, there is plenty of
room for improvement along these
lines.

vironment to further course in
struction. With a course in Ger
man history the first quarter and
in German political institutions
the second quarter, students were
well prepared to appreciate the
trip to Bonn, which fell during
the week that Konrad Adenauer
stepped down as Chancellor. The
Music 1 course first quarter en
abled students better to appreci
ate the tremendous cultural op
portunities of Europe while the
course in the history of the Eng
lish and German languages second
quarter gave the study of German
much greater meaning.
Finally, the relationship of the
Burg students to the village of
Beutelsbach and to students at
nearby colleges was very good
and provided a broad exposure to
the surrounding society.
Why, then, is the present pro
gram inadequate? Because in pro
viding an excellent program for
the greater number of students
it neglects and limits the oppor
tunities for the few who are cap
able of making much better use of
six months in Europe .
The Stanford Overseas Program
is unique among U.S. university
programs for overseas study be
cause it successfully gives almost
one third of the undergraduate
student body the opportunity to
spend six months in Europe, re
gardless of major. By taking the
minimum language requirement
even the physics major may at
tend one of the Stanford "trans
plants," losing no time or credits
and broadening his education and
outlook through exposure to an
other wav of life, another people.

THE PROGRAMS OF other
universities usually send the stu
dent directly to a foreign univer
sity for a semester or more of
study, often on an exchange pro
gram of some sort. But complica
tions often arise as to the validity
of credits and courses toward an
American degree. And such high
proficiency in the foreign lan
guage is required that usually
only the language major can take
advantage of the opportunity.
But in overcoming these dis
advantages of the direct exchange
setup, Stanford also loses the ad
vantages. Though the idea of giv
ing the many a better opportunity
is noble enough and ought cer
tainly to be continued, there are
nevertheless students who have
the proficiency in a language who
would gain much more from their
European experience if totally
immersed in the culture. But when
they are forced to live in a group
of students whose proficiency is
much lower, cut off to a certain
extent from the foreign culture—
to the extent, by the way, that
the campus is a "transplant" —
these students are severely
limited.
Furthermore, there is in every
overseas group a number of stu
dents who acquire a very high
proficiency after two or three
months and are ready to move into
a more concentrated atmosphere
—perhaps to begin then a semes
ter at a European university.
IT IS A POINT of fact that
most of the student criticism of
the Overseas Program has been
from the element that was not
adequately challenged at an over
seas campus and felt that much
better use could have been made
of the six months abroad. The
reaction to this criticism has in
the past been unfair, usually ig
noring any possibility that there
were valid grounds.
The Stanford Overseas Program
is very likely the best such pr o
gram in the country. But the
praise it has receiver! has tended
to drown the just criticism.
A study should be made of the
possibilities of supplementing the
present program with opportuni
ties for those who want to and
can make the effort to excel, to
go beyond what most students
can achieve. This may be done
through an exchange program or
through a combination of the pres
ent setup and the exchange idea.
As good as the present overseas
Program is, there is plenty of
room for improvement along these
lines.
The eleventh session of Stan
ford in Germany which ended in
December was, with some reserva
tions, a tremendous success.
Nevertheless, it is apparent that
the present overseas program is
inadequate and requires supple
mentation.
Ninety pei'cent of the students
in Group XI count their six-month
stay on the Burg as "extremely
rewarding." Almost every phase
of the program was well planned
to make the very best use of the
valuable time spent in Europe.
Field trips to Rome, Czechoslo
vakia, Berlin and Bonn were well
prepared for and, for the most
part, well co-ordinated.

viding an excellent program for
the greater number of students
it neglects and limits the oppor
tunities for the few who are cap
able of making much better use of
six months in Europe .
The Stanford Overseas Program
is unique among U.S. university
programs for overseas study be
cause it successfully gives almost
one third of the undergraduate
student body the opportunity to
spend six months in Europe, re
gardless of major. By taking the
minimum language requirement
even the physics major may at
tend one of the Stanford "trans
plants," losing no time or credits
and broadening his education and
outlook through exposure to an
other wav of life, another people.

THE PROGRAMS OF other
universities usually send the stu
dent directly to a foreign univer
sity for a semester or more of
study, often on an exchange pro
gram of some sort. But complica
tions often arise as to the validity
of credits and courses toward an
American degree. And such high
proficiency in the foreign lan
guage is required that usually
only the language major can take
advantage of the opportunity.
But in overcoming these dis
advantages of the direct exchange
setup, Stanford also loses the ad
vantages. Though the idea of giv
ing the many a better opportunity
is noble enough and ought cer
tainly to be continued, there are
nevertheless students who have
the proficiency in a language who
would gain much more from their
European experience if totally
immersed in the culture. But when
they are forced to live in a group
of students whose proficiency is
much lower, cut off to a certain
extent from the foreign culture—
to the extent, by the way, that
the campus is a "transplant" —
these students are severely
limited.
Furthermore, there is in every
overseas group a number of stu
dents who acquire a very high
proficiency after two or three
months and are ready to move into
a more concentrated atmosphere
—perhaps to begin then a semes
ter at a European university.
IT IS A POINT of fact that
most of the student criticism of
the Overseas Program has been
from the element that was not
adequately challenged at an over
seas campus and felt that much
better use could have been made
of the six months abroad. The
reaction to this criticism has in
the past been unfair, usually ig
noring any possibility that there
were valid grounds.
The Stanford Overseas Program
is very likely the best such pr o
gram in the country. But the
praise it has receiver! has tended
to drown the just criticism.
A study should be made of the
possibilities of supplementing the
present program with opportuni
ties for those who want to and
can make the effort to excel, to
go beyond what most students
can achieve. This may be done
through an exchange program or
through a combination of the pres
ent setup and the exchange idea.
As good as the present overseas
Program is, there is plenty of
room for improvement along these
lines.
