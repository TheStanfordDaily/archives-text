# Stanford Moscow Concert Meets Deserved Praise
## 
### ARTHUR TOLLEFSON 
During a recent tour of Great
Britain tho Moscow Chamber Or
chestra was acclaimed as "one of
the finest chamber ensembles in
existence." Such unbounded praise
is, to be sure, loo often rendered
upon musical groups whose cali
bre of performance warrants a
more reserved degree of enthusi
asm. Yet, to judge from this or
chestra's December 5 concert at
Memorial Auditorium, the Eng
lish press has attached a just and
well-deserved label to the Moscow
Chamber Orchestra.
These twenty-four young instru
mentalists were conducted by Ru
dolf Barshai, a performer whose
style ranges from disciplinarian
precision to an ultra-musicality
reminiscent of a more well-known
European, Herbert van Karajan.
In works of Handel and Mozart
he highlighted section after sec
tion in a manner that lightened
an otherwise incomprehensible
polyphonic maze. Both terrace
and graded dynamics were em
ployed with utmost taste in tho
Baroque numbers.
THE CONCERTO FOR Cham
ber Orchestra (1961) by a young
Estonian composer, Jan Riaats,
was a pleasant premiere. Written
in five movements the composi
tion utilizes soloistic treatment
of various strings .heavily synco
pated folk rhythms, and the de
vice of thematic recurrence.

It is a common musician's joke
that Vivaldi, reported to have
written five hundred concerti, ac
tually wrote the same concerto
five hundred times. Thus, it was
with foreboding that many anti
cipated the all-Vivaldi second half
of the concert. Much to our sur
prise, however, the chosen selec
tions, a Concerto Grosso, a Con
certo for Two Violins, and a Con
certo for Oboe.proved to be ex
tremely well-varied, impeccably
performed, and were a sheer de
light to the entire audience.
My only criticism of the eve
ning lies not with the performance
itself but with the program and
its annotations. The second num
ber on the program was listed as
the Symphony No. 11 by Mozart;
yet this was not the composition
performed. The keyboard instru
ment on stage was listed as a
"clavichord"; thank heavens it
was not, for I doubt that the per
former himself could have heard
such a tiny sound. It was, of
course, the more sonorous "harp
sichord."
THIS PAST YEAR has seen the
first American tour of the young
Moscow Chamber Orchestra. On
the basis of the reception given
this group at Stanford, in San
Francisco (a half-hour standing
ovation!), and throughout their
tour a return engagement will
probably be demanded before
long. Such an event will be eagerly
anticipated.

anticipated.
During a recent tour of Great
Britain tho Moscow Chamber Or
chestra was acclaimed as "one of
the finest chamber ensembles in
existence." Such unbounded praise
is, to be sure, loo often rendered
upon musical groups whose cali
bre of performance warrants a
more reserved degree of enthusi
asm. Yet, to judge from this or
chestra's December 5 concert at
Memorial Auditorium, the Eng
lish press has attached a just and
well-deserved label to the Moscow
Chamber Orchestra.
These twenty-four young instru
mentalists were conducted by Ru
dolf Barshai, a performer whose
style ranges from disciplinarian
precision to an ultra-musicality
reminiscent of a more well-known
European, Herbert van Karajan.
In works of Handel and Mozart
he highlighted section after sec
tion in a manner that lightened
an otherwise incomprehensible
polyphonic maze. Both terrace
and graded dynamics were em
ployed with utmost taste in tho
Baroque numbers.
THE CONCERTO FOR Cham
ber Orchestra (1961) by a young
Estonian composer, Jan Riaats,
was a pleasant premiere. Written
in five movements the composi
tion utilizes soloistic treatment
of various strings .heavily synco
pated folk rhythms, and the de
vice of thematic recurrence.

It is a common musician's joke
that Vivaldi, reported to have
written five hundred concerti, ac
tually wrote the same concerto
five hundred times. Thus, it was
with foreboding that many anti
cipated the all-Vivaldi second half
of the concert. Much to our sur
prise, however, the chosen selec
tions, a Concerto Grosso, a Con
certo for Two Violins, and a Con
certo for Oboe.proved to be ex
tremely well-varied, impeccably
performed, and were a sheer de
light to the entire audience.
My only criticism of the eve
ning lies not with the performance
itself but with the program and
its annotations. The second num
ber on the program was listed as
the Symphony No. 11 by Mozart;
yet this was not the composition
performed. The keyboard instru
ment on stage was listed as a
"clavichord"; thank heavens it
was not, for I doubt that the per
former himself could have heard
such a tiny sound. It was, of
course, the more sonorous "harp
sichord."
THIS PAST YEAR has seen the
first American tour of the young
Moscow Chamber Orchestra. On
the basis of the reception given
this group at Stanford, in San
Francisco (a half-hour standing
ovation!), and throughout their
tour a return engagement will
probably be demanded before
long. Such an event will be eagerly
anticipated.
