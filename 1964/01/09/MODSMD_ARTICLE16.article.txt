## Goldwater Doesn't Really Expect the Presidency 
### 
The diffidence with which Senator Goldwater announced that he
would run revealed how little he enjoys what is ahead of him.
He is forced to go through a grueling series of primary campaigns
in which his main objective is not to defeat Lyndon Johnson and
become President of the United States, but to capture control of the
machinery of the Republican Party. Although he often says that ho
does not wish to fight Republicans, he is in fact engaged in what
promises to be a fierce struggle with Republicans.
In order to dominate the Republican convention, he is taking the
line that the rival Republican candidates, beginning but not ending
with Governor Rockefeller, are not Republicans at all, but Democrats.
He won't debate with them. He dismisses them as outsiders. The
established Republican leadership, which is now grouped around
General Eisenhower, is to be ousted and purged, and the Goldwater
faction, which is a minority within a minority party, are to be in
vested as the only true Republicans.
THE AUDACITY OF this claim will become increasingly evident
as the primary campaign unfolds. In his press conference at Phoenix,
for example, he put General Eisenhower aside with a sneering refer
ence to the fact that this man, the only Republican elected to the
Presidency for a generation, has been traveling in a private railroad
car.
Mr. Rockefeller, the only Republican elected governor of New
York since Thomas Dewey, is dismissed as a mere Democrat. Thus,
Senator Goldwater is trapped in a commit ment to argue that he alone
is a true Republican and that he alone is qualified to speak for the
party.
There is every prospect, therefore, that in the Republican pri
maries the issues which divide the party will become sharper as time
goes on. It was plain enough in the senator's appearance on Sunday
on "Meet the Press" that he is cast in a role which he does not alto
gether relish. For by insisting on purging the other Republicans, he
knows quite well that he is left with extreme positions which are
political liabilities.
His normal political instinct is to fudge these issues in order to
allow his less extreme supporters to say that he never really meant
them. But it will be remarkable if the Republicans, whose political
lives are mortally challenged, and the Democrats, who are not care
less in these matters, allow Senator Goldwater to weasel his way
out of the absurdities he has uttered—on the income tax, our rela
tions with Russia, Social Security, the Tennessee Valley and the racial
question. If he tries to retreat to a more moderate position, he will
mar his one greatest political asset—the image of himself as a no
nonsense, put-up-or-shut-up, roughriding he-man.
HE MADE ONE ATTEMPT on "Meet the Press" to extricate him
self from the position that we should withdraw recognition from the
Soviet Union.
First he explained that he wanted to use the the threat of non
recognition as "a bargaining tool," and then in a wild attempt to get
back off the limb onto which ho had crawled, he made the extra
ordinary and altogether untrue statement that if he were President,
he alone could not withdraw recognition: "We have to keep in mind,
though, this would take an action of the Senate of the United States."
This remark shows how little he understands the Constitutional
powers of the office for which he is now an avowed candidate.
The essential Goldwater theme is the claim that he speaks the
true and fundamental principles of the party of Washington and
Hamilton, of Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and of Eisenhower. To
anyone brought up in a Republican tradition, this is a preposterous
claim.
Senator Goldwater would transform the party of Hamilton into
an Anti-Federal Party. He would transform the party of Lincoln into
the party of white supremacists. He would transform the party of
Theodore Roosevelt into an Anti-Progressive Party of uncontrolled
and unregulated businessmen, each man for himself and the devil
take the hindmost.
BY ALL THE historic and traditional considerations of the Eng
lish-speaking world, by the precedents that come from Burke and
Hamilton, from Disraeli and from Lincoln, Barry Goldwater is not
a conservative at all. He appears to be totally without the essential
conservative respect and concern for the social order as a living body.
He is a radical reactionary who would, if we are to believe what
he says, dismantle the modern state. His political philosophy does
not have its roots in the conservative tradition, but in the crude and
primitive capitalism of the Manchester School. It is the philosophy
not of the conservators of the social order, but of the newly rich
on the make.
If he is able to capture the Republican Party organization by
getting himself nominated, the condition of the party will be a
shambles. For the Republicans, the question in 1964 would then be
not how to beat Lyndon Johnson, but how to survive the assault and
the challenge of the Goldwater faction.

not how to beat Lyndon Johnson, but how to survive the assault and
the challenge of the Goldwater faction.

The diffidence with which Senator Goldwater announced that he
would run revealed how little he enjoys what is ahead of him.
He is forced to go through a grueling series of primary campaigns
in which his main objective is not to defeat Lyndon Johnson and
become President of the United States, but to capture control of the
machinery of the Republican Party. Although he often says that ho
does not wish to fight Republicans, he is in fact engaged in what
promises to be a fierce struggle with Republicans.
In order to dominate the Republican convention, he is taking the
line that the rival Republican candidates, beginning but not ending
with Governor Rockefeller, are not Republicans at all, but Democrats.
He won't debate with them. He dismisses them as outsiders. The
established Republican leadership, which is now grouped around
General Eisenhower, is to be ousted and purged, and the Goldwater
faction, which is a minority within a minority party, are to be in
vested as the only true Republicans.
THE AUDACITY OF this claim will become increasingly evident
as the primary campaign unfolds. In his press conference at Phoenix,
for example, he put General Eisenhower aside with a sneering refer
ence to the fact that this man, the only Republican elected to the
Presidency for a generation, has been traveling in a private railroad
car.
Mr. Rockefeller, the only Republican elected governor of New
York since Thomas Dewey, is dismissed as a mere Democrat. Thus,
Senator Goldwater is trapped in a commit ment to argue that he alone
is a true Republican and that he alone is qualified to speak for the
party.
There is every prospect, therefore, that in the Republican pri
maries the issues which divide the party will become sharper as time
goes on. It was plain enough in the senator's appearance on Sunday
on "Meet the Press" that he is cast in a role which he does not alto
gether relish. For by insisting on purging the other Republicans, he
knows quite well that he is left with extreme positions which are
political liabilities.
His normal political instinct is to fudge these issues in order to
allow his less extreme supporters to say that he never really meant
them. But it will be remarkable if the Republicans, whose political
lives are mortally challenged, and the Democrats, who are not care
less in these matters, allow Senator Goldwater to weasel his way
out of the absurdities he has uttered—on the income tax, our rela
tions with Russia, Social Security, the Tennessee Valley and the racial
question. If he tries to retreat to a more moderate position, he will
mar his one greatest political asset—the image of himself as a no
nonsense, put-up-or-shut-up, roughriding he-man.
HE MADE ONE ATTEMPT on "Meet the Press" to extricate him
self from the position that we should withdraw recognition from the
Soviet Union.
First he explained that he wanted to use the the threat of non
recognition as "a bargaining tool," and then in a wild attempt to get
back off the limb onto which ho had crawled, he made the extra
ordinary and altogether untrue statement that if he were President,
he alone could not withdraw recognition: "We have to keep in mind,
though, this would take an action of the Senate of the United States."
This remark shows how little he understands the Constitutional
powers of the office for which he is now an avowed candidate.
The essential Goldwater theme is the claim that he speaks the
true and fundamental principles of the party of Washington and
Hamilton, of Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and of Eisenhower. To
anyone brought up in a Republican tradition, this is a preposterous
claim.
Senator Goldwater would transform the party of Hamilton into
an Anti-Federal Party. He would transform the party of Lincoln into
the party of white supremacists. He would transform the party of
Theodore Roosevelt into an Anti-Progressive Party of uncontrolled
and unregulated businessmen, each man for himself and the devil
take the hindmost.
BY ALL THE historic and traditional considerations of the Eng
lish-speaking world, by the precedents that come from Burke and
Hamilton, from Disraeli and from Lincoln, Barry Goldwater is not
a conservative at all. He appears to be totally without the essential
conservative respect and concern for the social order as a living body.
He is a radical reactionary who would, if we are to believe what
he says, dismantle the modern state. His political philosophy does
not have its roots in the conservative tradition, but in the crude and
primitive capitalism of the Manchester School. It is the philosophy
not of the conservators of the social order, but of the newly rich
on the make.
If he is able to capture the Republican Party organization by
getting himself nominated, the condition of the party will be a
shambles. For the Republicans, the question in 1964 would then be
not how to beat Lyndon Johnson, but how to survive the assault and
the challenge of the Goldwater faction.

not have its roots in the conservative tradition, but in the crude and
primitive capitalism of the Manchester School. It is the philosophy
not of the conservators of the social order, but of the newly rich
on the make.
If he is able to capture the Republican Party organization by
getting himself nominated, the condition of the party will be a
shambles. For the Republicans, the question in 1964 would then be
not how to beat Lyndon Johnson, but how to survive the assault and
the challenge of the Goldwater faction.

The diffidence with which Senator Goldwater announced that he
would run revealed how little he enjoys what is ahead of him.
He is forced to go through a grueling series of primary campaigns
in which his main objective is not to defeat Lyndon Johnson and
become President of the United States, but to capture control of the
machinery of the Republican Party. Although he often says that ho
does not wish to fight Republicans, he is in fact engaged in what
promises to be a fierce struggle with Republicans.
In order to dominate the Republican convention, he is taking the
line that the rival Republican candidates, beginning but not ending
with Governor Rockefeller, are not Republicans at all, but Democrats.
He won't debate with them. He dismisses them as outsiders. The
established Republican leadership, which is now grouped around
General Eisenhower, is to be ousted and purged, and the Goldwater
faction, which is a minority within a minority party, are to be in
vested as the only true Republicans.
THE AUDACITY OF this claim will become increasingly evident
as the primary campaign unfolds. In his press conference at Phoenix,
for example, he put General Eisenhower aside with a sneering refer
ence to the fact that this man, the only Republican elected to the
Presidency for a generation, has been traveling in a private railroad
car.
Mr. Rockefeller, the only Republican elected governor of New
York since Thomas Dewey, is dismissed as a mere Democrat. Thus,
Senator Goldwater is trapped in a commit ment to argue that he alone
is a true Republican and that he alone is qualified to speak for the
party.
There is every prospect, therefore, that in the Republican pri
maries the issues which divide the party will become sharper as time
goes on. It was plain enough in the senator's appearance on Sunday
on "Meet the Press" that he is cast in a role which he does not alto
gether relish. For by insisting on purging the other Republicans, he
knows quite well that he is left with extreme positions which are
political liabilities.
His normal political instinct is to fudge these issues in order to
allow his less extreme supporters to say that he never really meant
them. But it will be remarkable if the Republicans, whose political
lives are mortally challenged, and the Democrats, who are not care
less in these matters, allow Senator Goldwater to weasel his way
out of the absurdities he has uttered—on the income tax, our rela
tions with Russia, Social Security, the Tennessee Valley and the racial
question. If he tries to retreat to a more moderate position, he will
mar his one greatest political asset—the image of himself as a no
nonsense, put-up-or-shut-up, roughriding he-man.
HE MADE ONE ATTEMPT on "Meet the Press" to extricate him
self from the position that we should withdraw recognition from the
Soviet Union.
First he explained that he wanted to use the the threat of non
recognition as "a bargaining tool," and then in a wild attempt to get
back off the limb onto which ho had crawled, he made the extra
ordinary and altogether untrue statement that if he were President,
he alone could not withdraw recognition: "We have to keep in mind,
though, this would take an action of the Senate of the United States."
This remark shows how little he understands the Constitutional
powers of the office for which he is now an avowed candidate.
The essential Goldwater theme is the claim that he speaks the
true and fundamental principles of the party of Washington and
Hamilton, of Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and of Eisenhower. To
anyone brought up in a Republican tradition, this is a preposterous
claim.
Senator Goldwater would transform the party of Hamilton into
an Anti-Federal Party. He would transform the party of Lincoln into
the party of white supremacists. He would transform the party of
Theodore Roosevelt into an Anti-Progressive Party of uncontrolled
and unregulated businessmen, each man for himself and the devil
take the hindmost.
BY ALL THE historic and traditional considerations of the Eng
lish-speaking world, by the precedents that come from Burke and
Hamilton, from Disraeli and from Lincoln, Barry Goldwater is not
a conservative at all. He appears to be totally without the essential
conservative respect and concern for the social order as a living body.
He is a radical reactionary who would, if we are to believe what
he says, dismantle the modern state. His political philosophy does
not have its roots in the conservative tradition, but in the crude and
primitive capitalism of the Manchester School. It is the philosophy
not of the conservators of the social order, but of the newly rich
on the make.
If he is able to capture the Republican Party organization by
getting himself nominated, the condition of the party will be a
shambles. For the Republicans, the question in 1964 would then be
not how to beat Lyndon Johnson, but how to survive the assault and
the challenge of the Goldwater faction.
