# Nation's Writers Pick Big Upsets
## 
### 
When Iho underdog Los Ange
les Dodgers stormed lo victory
in four straight games over the
mighty New York Yankees in the
1963 World Series, it was both
tho upset of (he Year and the
Thrill of ihe Year to (he nation's
sports writers and broadcasters.
It became impossible lo sep
arate Ihose two categories in the
annual Associated Press year-end
poll because thn voting revolved
about, that one climatic series al
most to the exclusion of every
thing else.
A TOTAL of 115 writers and
voters cast: 1-2-3 ballots for the
Upset of the Year and of these
92 put the Dodger sweep first, 21
put it second and eight put it
third. Only 125 listed Iheir great
est thrill, but 47 said it was the
Dodgers' four-game victory and
25 others listed Sandy Koiifax's
pitching in the opening game,
when he set a World Series rec
ord by striking out 15.
In the upset voting, the Los
Angeles sweep drew 332 points
on the usual 3-2-1 basis for first,
second and third place votes. The
No. 2 upset in the experts' opin
ion was Southern Methodist's
football victory over Navy â€” the
only regular season game the
Midshipmen lost. That was worth
65 points.
