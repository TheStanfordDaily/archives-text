# HOT LINE TO THE SIDELINEâ€” Wolverines Could Be
## N.C.A.A. Champions 
### TOM ELIAS 
Right: now things look pretty good for West Coast basketball
buffs. UCLA is ranked first in both polls and Oregon State has been
in the top ton all season, while Stanford has been knocking on the
door. But the question in most observers' minds is "will it last?"
Some think it will. UCLA's quick little Bruins, lerl by high scor
ing guards Walt Hazzard and Gail Goodrich and dependable center
Fred Slaughter have beaten everyone they have come up against
with remarkable ease. Victories include easy wins over powerful
Kansas and Kansas State and Crcighton on Ihe road and over a line
Michigan team favored to win the Big Ten title.
Oregon State, despite the loss of Terry Baker from its 1963
team, which was fourth in the nation, still has skyscraper Mel Counts,
and has scored impressive wins over Big Ten powerhouse Indiana
and the strong Cincinnati team which went lo ihe NCAA finals before
it lost last season.
STANFORD LOOKS GOOD
Stanford, too. has been impressive with seven victories in nine
starts, and the Tribe's only losses were both by one point when Helm's
All-American center Tom Dose was sitting on the sideline nursing
a knee injury or playing at less than full strength due to the same
injury.
But how long can this last? West Coast teams have a longstand
ing record of posting impressive season records and even impressive
wins in tho Far West regional of the NCAA and then going to Louis
ville for the finals and getting creamed. This very thing happened
to Oregon State's Beavers last season when they lost only two games
in what remained in the season after getting Terry Baker back from
the football team. Slats Gill's men then proceeded to mow down
all their opposition in the Far West Regional. Then they went east
and were slaughtered twice, by Cincinnati in the semi-finals and later
by Duke in the consolation game. Maybe that won't happen this
season, but there's a good chance it could.
College basketball around the country is stronger this year than
it. has been in a good many. Every team that either wins its way
into the NCAA tourney or is invited in, as was Loyola of Chicago,
last year's champs, will have a good chance to lake all the marbles.
MANY GOOD TEAMS
In fact, there are so many good teams around this year that the

NCAA will have trouble deciding
whom to invito to which regional.
The Mid-East Regional to be hold
at East Lansing, Mich, is a good
example. Tho Big Ten and South
east Conference winners will get
automatic berths. But there are
many good teams in that area
that deserve bids and probably
won't get them because of their
geographical location, if for no
other reason.
Loyola of Chicago and DePaul
of Chicago are prime examples
of this unfortunate circumstance.
Loyola, the defending champ, has
lost only one game this season,
while romping to eleven wins;
meanwhile DePaul, only a few
blocks away, has won eleven with
out defeat. Surely both these
teams will deserve tournament
bids if their early season records
hold up, but since the NCAA
won't invite two Chicago schools,

ono will have to got a raw deal. Chances are the unlucky team will
be DePaul, as the NCAA can't avoid inviting its defending champ if
its record merits an invitation as the Ramblers' mark assuredly will.
BIG TEN AND SOUTHEAST WILL BE STRONG
But even if they make it into the tourney. Loyola will have a
tough time getting past the Big Ton and Southeastern champs, prob
ably Michigan and Kentucky, both of which have been ranked among
the top five all season.
The East, too, is tough. Despite a series of early season upsets,
NYU, with its fine duo of Barry Kramer and Happy Hairston, will
! almost undoubtedly get a bid. The Violets should be joined by un
: beaten Davidson of the Southern Conference, currently ranked fifth
in the nation, and eighth-ranked Duke, if the Blue Devils can get
out of the tough Atlantic Coast Conference playoffs at the end of
the season.
The Mid-West regional at Kansas City, producer of the national
champ two of the last three years, will be a little weaker this season
than usual. The Missouri Valley Conference, whose champion plays
in this regional, has not been as strong as in recent years. Still, this
regional will boast the winner of the strong Big Eight and the rela
tively weak Southwest Conference winner. Oklahoma City, tallest
team in the country, will also play here.
MICHIGAN TO WIN NCAA TOURNEY
So everywhere we look 1 his season, there are myriads of tall and
talented behemoths running around with basketballs. Picking the top
one at the end of the season is pretty tough, before any of the con
ference races really get; started, but I think I'll go out on a limb
anyway and pick Michigan to win the Big Ten and go to the NCAA
crown.
Sure, the Wolverines were beaten handily by UCLA in the LA
Classic, but remember that they start three sophomores and two
juniors and have more height than anyone they're liable to come up
against. Center Bill Buntin has never been stopped in two years of
varsity play, and 6-5 sophomore guard Ca/.zie Russell is too big to
be stopped by anyone as good as he is. and too good to be stopped by
any guard as big as he is. With these two leading the way, Michigan
will be hard to stop any time, harder still to stop when its fine trio
of sophs gets a little more experience in the rugged Big Ten. But
don't bet the grocery money on it! ...

Right: now things look pretty good for West Coast basketball
buffs. UCLA is ranked first in both polls and Oregon State has been
in the top ton all season, while Stanford has been knocking on the
door. But the question in most observers' minds is "will it last?"
Some think it will. UCLA's quick little Bruins, lerl by high scor
ing guards Walt Hazzard and Gail Goodrich and dependable center
Fred Slaughter have beaten everyone they have come up against
with remarkable ease. Victories include easy wins over powerful
Kansas and Kansas State and Crcighton on Ihe road and over a line
Michigan team favored to win the Big Ten title.
Oregon State, despite the loss of Terry Baker from its 1963
team, which was fourth in the nation, still has skyscraper Mel Counts,
and has scored impressive wins over Big Ten powerhouse Indiana
and the strong Cincinnati team which went lo ihe NCAA finals before
it lost last season.
STANFORD LOOKS GOOD
Stanford, too. has been impressive with seven victories in nine
starts, and the Tribe's only losses were both by one point when Helm's
All-American center Tom Dose was sitting on the sideline nursing
a knee injury or playing at less than full strength due to the same
injury.
But how long can this last? West Coast teams have a longstand
ing record of posting impressive season records and even impressive
wins in tho Far West regional of the NCAA and then going to Louis
ville for the finals and getting creamed. This very thing happened
to Oregon State's Beavers last season when they lost only two games
in what remained in the season after getting Terry Baker back from
the football team. Slats Gill's men then proceeded to mow down
all their opposition in the Far West Regional. Then they went east
and were slaughtered twice, by Cincinnati in the semi-finals and later
by Duke in the consolation game. Maybe that won't happen this
season, but there's a good chance it could.
College basketball around the country is stronger this year than
it. has been in a good many. Every team that either wins its way
into the NCAA tourney or is invited in, as was Loyola of Chicago,
last year's champs, will have a good chance to lake all the marbles.
MANY GOOD TEAMS
In fact, there are so many good teams around this year that the

NCAA will have trouble deciding
whom to invito to which regional.
The Mid-East Regional to be hold
at East Lansing, Mich, is a good
example. Tho Big Ten and South
east Conference winners will get
automatic berths. But there are
many good teams in that area
that deserve bids and probably
won't get them because of their
geographical location, if for no
other reason.
Loyola of Chicago and DePaul
of Chicago are prime examples
of this unfortunate circumstance.
Loyola, the defending champ, has
lost only one game this season,
while romping to eleven wins;
meanwhile DePaul, only a few
blocks away, has won eleven with
out defeat. Surely both these
teams will deserve tournament
bids if their early season records
hold up, but since the NCAA
won't invite two Chicago schools,

ono will have to got a raw deal. Chances are the unlucky team will
be DePaul, as the NCAA can't avoid inviting its defending champ if
its record merits an invitation as the Ramblers' mark assuredly will.
BIG TEN AND SOUTHEAST WILL BE STRONG
But even if they make it into the tourney. Loyola will have a
tough time getting past the Big Ton and Southeastern champs, prob
ably Michigan and Kentucky, both of which have been ranked among
the top five all season.
The East, too, is tough. Despite a series of early season upsets,
NYU, with its fine duo of Barry Kramer and Happy Hairston, will
! almost undoubtedly get a bid. The Violets should be joined by un
: beaten Davidson of the Southern Conference, currently ranked fifth
in the nation, and eighth-ranked Duke, if the Blue Devils can get
out of the tough Atlantic Coast Conference playoffs at the end of
the season.
The Mid-West regional at Kansas City, producer of the national
champ two of the last three years, will be a little weaker this season
than usual. The Missouri Valley Conference, whose champion plays
in this regional, has not been as strong as in recent years. Still, this
regional will boast the winner of the strong Big Eight and the rela
tively weak Southwest Conference winner. Oklahoma City, tallest
team in the country, will also play here.
MICHIGAN TO WIN NCAA TOURNEY
So everywhere we look 1 his season, there are myriads of tall and
talented behemoths running around with basketballs. Picking the top
one at the end of the season is pretty tough, before any of the con
ference races really get; started, but I think I'll go out on a limb
anyway and pick Michigan to win the Big Ten and go to the NCAA
crown.
Sure, the Wolverines were beaten handily by UCLA in the LA
Classic, but remember that they start three sophomores and two
juniors and have more height than anyone they're liable to come up
against. Center Bill Buntin has never been stopped in two years of
varsity play, and 6-5 sophomore guard Ca/.zie Russell is too big to
be stopped by anyone as good as he is. and too good to be stopped by
any guard as big as he is. With these two leading the way, Michigan
will be hard to stop any time, harder still to stop when its fine trio
of sophs gets a little more experience in the rugged Big Ten. But
don't bet the grocery money on it! ...

don't bet the grocery money on it! ...

Right: now things look pretty good for West Coast basketball
buffs. UCLA is ranked first in both polls and Oregon State has been
in the top ton all season, while Stanford has been knocking on the
door. But the question in most observers' minds is "will it last?"
Some think it will. UCLA's quick little Bruins, lerl by high scor
ing guards Walt Hazzard and Gail Goodrich and dependable center
Fred Slaughter have beaten everyone they have come up against
with remarkable ease. Victories include easy wins over powerful
Kansas and Kansas State and Crcighton on Ihe road and over a line
Michigan team favored to win the Big Ten title.
Oregon State, despite the loss of Terry Baker from its 1963
team, which was fourth in the nation, still has skyscraper Mel Counts,
and has scored impressive wins over Big Ten powerhouse Indiana
and the strong Cincinnati team which went lo ihe NCAA finals before
it lost last season.
STANFORD LOOKS GOOD
Stanford, too. has been impressive with seven victories in nine
starts, and the Tribe's only losses were both by one point when Helm's
All-American center Tom Dose was sitting on the sideline nursing
a knee injury or playing at less than full strength due to the same
injury.
But how long can this last? West Coast teams have a longstand
ing record of posting impressive season records and even impressive
wins in tho Far West regional of the NCAA and then going to Louis
ville for the finals and getting creamed. This very thing happened
to Oregon State's Beavers last season when they lost only two games
in what remained in the season after getting Terry Baker back from
the football team. Slats Gill's men then proceeded to mow down
all their opposition in the Far West Regional. Then they went east
and were slaughtered twice, by Cincinnati in the semi-finals and later
by Duke in the consolation game. Maybe that won't happen this
season, but there's a good chance it could.
College basketball around the country is stronger this year than
it. has been in a good many. Every team that either wins its way
into the NCAA tourney or is invited in, as was Loyola of Chicago,
last year's champs, will have a good chance to lake all the marbles.
MANY GOOD TEAMS
In fact, there are so many good teams around this year that the

NCAA will have trouble deciding
whom to invito to which regional.
The Mid-East Regional to be hold
at East Lansing, Mich, is a good
example. Tho Big Ten and South
east Conference winners will get
automatic berths. But there are
many good teams in that area
that deserve bids and probably
won't get them because of their
geographical location, if for no
other reason.
Loyola of Chicago and DePaul
of Chicago are prime examples
of this unfortunate circumstance.
Loyola, the defending champ, has
lost only one game this season,
while romping to eleven wins;
meanwhile DePaul, only a few
blocks away, has won eleven with
out defeat. Surely both these
teams will deserve tournament
bids if their early season records
hold up, but since the NCAA
won't invite two Chicago schools,

ono will have to got a raw deal. Chances are the unlucky team will
be DePaul, as the NCAA can't avoid inviting its defending champ if
its record merits an invitation as the Ramblers' mark assuredly will.
BIG TEN AND SOUTHEAST WILL BE STRONG
But even if they make it into the tourney. Loyola will have a
tough time getting past the Big Ton and Southeastern champs, prob
ably Michigan and Kentucky, both of which have been ranked among
the top five all season.
The East, too, is tough. Despite a series of early season upsets,
NYU, with its fine duo of Barry Kramer and Happy Hairston, will
! almost undoubtedly get a bid. The Violets should be joined by un
: beaten Davidson of the Southern Conference, currently ranked fifth
in the nation, and eighth-ranked Duke, if the Blue Devils can get
out of the tough Atlantic Coast Conference playoffs at the end of
the season.
The Mid-West regional at Kansas City, producer of the national
champ two of the last three years, will be a little weaker this season
than usual. The Missouri Valley Conference, whose champion plays
in this regional, has not been as strong as in recent years. Still, this
regional will boast the winner of the strong Big Eight and the rela
tively weak Southwest Conference winner. Oklahoma City, tallest
team in the country, will also play here.
MICHIGAN TO WIN NCAA TOURNEY
So everywhere we look 1 his season, there are myriads of tall and
talented behemoths running around with basketballs. Picking the top
one at the end of the season is pretty tough, before any of the con
ference races really get; started, but I think I'll go out on a limb
anyway and pick Michigan to win the Big Ten and go to the NCAA
crown.
Sure, the Wolverines were beaten handily by UCLA in the LA
Classic, but remember that they start three sophomores and two
juniors and have more height than anyone they're liable to come up
against. Center Bill Buntin has never been stopped in two years of
varsity play, and 6-5 sophomore guard Ca/.zie Russell is too big to
be stopped by anyone as good as he is. and too good to be stopped by
any guard as big as he is. With these two leading the way, Michigan
will be hard to stop any time, harder still to stop when its fine trio
of sophs gets a little more experience in the rugged Big Ten. But
don't bet the grocery money on it! ...
