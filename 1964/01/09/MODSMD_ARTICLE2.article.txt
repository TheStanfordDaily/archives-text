# Manuel to Discuss Theories Of History in Lecture Series
## 
### ROBERT W. NAVLOR 
Dr. Frank E. Manuel, professor of History at Brandeis University,
will open a series of seven lectures Friday on "Shapes of Philosophi
cal History." The series, the last three of which will compose the
1964 Harry Camp Lectures, will last until January 23.
The philosophies of history of the Western world during the past

2000 years contain "extraordinary
psychological truths of their
epochs," says Manuel. In every
age "man must ask the total ques
tion: where does he fit into the
whole of the universe?" He asks
what is really a mythic question
that has no concrete answer.
"Till; PHILOSOPHICAL his
torian," say Manuel, is the "great
myth-maker" of his age. "The
myth is a poetic truth" which tells
what the attitudes of an historical
epoch really are. For example.
"The conceptions of Toynbee per
meate most historical writing. His
'myth' has had a tremendous in
fluence."
One of two basic themes appear
in every theory of history, says
Manuel: "circularity," repetitive
cvHes such as the growth and de
cline of civilizations, and "linear
progression." Though theories of
history assume a variety of forms,
Ihe.se "enduring themes" prevail.
"They are the two ways man has
of looking at history," Manuel
concludes.
THE SLlillvS OF lectures is
simply to be "a study in the his
tory of ideas," says Manuel. "It
is not a narrative, but a critical
evaluation of the philosophies of
history of the Western world. I
am posing problems with respect
to these theories," ho continues.
"I will be speptical, but apprecia
tive and open."
The first lecture, entitled "The
Wicked Dance in Circles: Early
Christians Against the Pagans,"
will deal with the Greek and Ro
man cyclical theories as attacked
by the rising Christianity.
VARIATIONS on Christian li
nearity will be the subject of the
second lecture, "Ascending Ja
cob's Ladder: The Way of Saint
Augustine or of the Abbot Joa
chim." The revival of the circular
theory during the Rennaissance
will compose the third talk, with
a discussion of the topic "Man Is
a Crooked Stick: Kant and the
Debate on Moral Destiny" making
up the fourth.
The fifth and sixth lectures, en
titled "Taming the Future: the
French Idea of Perfectibility" and
"Leaps Into Free Consciousness:
Resonances from the German
Academy" respectively, will dis
cuss the two main attitudes rising
out of 18th century philosophy.
THIO LAST of the series, en

titled "An Uneasy Concensus: the
Twentieth-Century Prospect," will
deal with Toynbee and Spongier,
as well as several biological, re
ligious, and neo-Marxist theories.
The discussion will center on the
thread of agreement which runs
through all these theories, that
the "end of the sensate man" is
near and that a "new spirt ualiza
tion" will take place.

Manuel: "circularity," repetitive
cvHes such as the growth and de
cline of civilizations, and "linear
progression." Though theories of
history assume a variety of forms,
Ihe.se "enduring themes" prevail.
"They are the two ways man has
of looking at history," Manuel
concludes.
THE SLlillvS OF lectures is
simply to be "a study in the his
tory of ideas," says Manuel. "It
is not a narrative, but a critical
evaluation of the philosophies of
history of the Western world. I
am posing problems with respect
to these theories," ho continues.
"I will be speptical, but apprecia
tive and open."
The first lecture, entitled "The
Wicked Dance in Circles: Early
Christians Against the Pagans,"
will deal with the Greek and Ro
man cyclical theories as attacked
by the rising Christianity.
VARIATIONS on Christian li
nearity will be the subject of the
second lecture, "Ascending Ja
cob's Ladder: The Way of Saint
Augustine or of the Abbot Joa
chim." The revival of the circular
theory during the Rennaissance
will compose the third talk, with
a discussion of the topic "Man Is
a Crooked Stick: Kant and the
Debate on Moral Destiny" making
up the fourth.
The fifth and sixth lectures, en
titled "Taming the Future: the
French Idea of Perfectibility" and
"Leaps Into Free Consciousness:
Resonances from the German
Academy" respectively, will dis
cuss the two main attitudes rising
out of 18th century philosophy.
THIO LAST of the series, en

titled "An Uneasy Concensus: the
Twentieth-Century Prospect," will
deal with Toynbee and Spongier,
as well as several biological, re
ligious, and neo-Marxist theories.
The discussion will center on the
thread of agreement which runs
through all these theories, that
the "end of the sensate man" is
near and that a "new spirt ualiza
tion" will take place.


DR. FRANK E. MANUEL
Dr. Frank E. Manuel, professor of History at Brandeis University,
will open a series of seven lectures Friday on "Shapes of Philosophi
cal History." The series, the last three of which will compose the
1964 Harry Camp Lectures, will last until January 23.
The philosophies of history of the Western world during the past

2000 years contain "extraordinary
psychological truths of their
epochs," says Manuel. In every
age "man must ask the total ques
tion: where does he fit into the
whole of the universe?" He asks
what is really a mythic question
that has no concrete answer.
"Till; PHILOSOPHICAL his
torian," say Manuel, is the "great
myth-maker" of his age. "The
myth is a poetic truth" which tells
what the attitudes of an historical
epoch really are. For example.
"The conceptions of Toynbee per
meate most historical writing. His
'myth' has had a tremendous in
fluence."
One of two basic themes appear
in every theory of history, says
Manuel: "circularity," repetitive
cvHes such as the growth and de
cline of civilizations, and "linear
progression." Though theories of
history assume a variety of forms,
Ihe.se "enduring themes" prevail.
