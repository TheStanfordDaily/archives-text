# Matmen to Lack Depth, Experience
## 
### BILL PRACHER 
Stanford's varsity wrestling
team opens its 19f>4 season on
January 15 against Mare Island
and Moffet Field NASA. The
match, which is at home will be
the first of an eleven contest slate.
The Indian matmen will be di
rected this year by Coach Bill
Leland. This will bo Leland's first
coaching assignment, lie is a
graduate of Amherst, where he
competed in intercollegiate wrest
ling. Leland presently is enrolled
in graduate work in Psychology
at Stanford. Ho hopes to improve
on last year's four win and six
loss record.
LELAND SEES lack of depth
as the greatest problem facing
this year's matmen. With only
one to three participants at. each
weight there will be no room for
let-downs. Inexperience will also
hamper Ihe Card wrestlers. Jon
Kay and Phil Kendall are the only
two year lottermen on the squad.
There are six other returning
lettermen and eight men with
little previous varsity experience.
Stanford, however, has fairly
good material and after the men
have a few matches under their
belts, should have a good team.
Jon Kay, who should wrestle in
the 147 lb. class is one of the
team's better wrestlers. Leland
feels that Kay will be hard to
beat. Junior Tom Allen had a
good season last year and will
be counted on to produce victories
in the 177 lb. weight bracket. Jon
Trachta is also a strong wrestler
and will give the 177 lb. class
great depth. Don Buehler (also
an Ail-American water polo play
er) is a tough, aggressive
wrestler who will hold down the
191 lb. spot on the team.
rillL KENDALL is Stanford's
best wrestler. Kendall, grappling
at 157 lbs., is one of the team's
co-captains, the other captain is
Buehler. There are four sophs on
the squad; Rich Odom, Steve
Sehaum, Joel Kay, and Dick An
derson.
Anderson led the Frosh squad
last year and could capture the
123 lb. berth from lettermen
George Musser. Barring any in
juries, and presuming that Ihe
team comes along as Coach Le
land hopes, the Indian matmen
will improve on last year's record.
