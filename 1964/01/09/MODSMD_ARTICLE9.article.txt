# Glee Club Plans Variety of Concerts
## 
### HILDA KOSSOFF HOPE SELBY 
Music from Bach to Broadway
will highlight performances by
the Men's Glee Club this quarter.
The club plans to sing this quar
j tor at an informal concert in Tre
| sidder and at other social events,
i But the big events are reserved
for the spring, when the club will
give a formal concert in Dinkel
spiol and sing at the well-known
Sunday Salon series. Talented per
formers from throughout the Bay
Area are invited to sing at the
series, hold in San Francisco.
THE ( LI B was reorganized
last quarter under president Leon
Lack. More members were added,
and more officers elected. At this
time Robert MacKinnon joined
the group as director on a per
manent basis. MacKinnon received
his master's degree in music at
Yale University and is currently
Director of Music at the Comedia
Theater in Menlo Park. Among
his arrangements are an alumni
pleasing medley of the Stanford
hymn, "Come Join the Band," and
"Sons of Iho Stanford Red." and
a now arrangement of "Autumn
iLeaves." In the past, grad stu
j dents directed the club on a vol
unteer basis.
The club meets three hours a
week to prepare its repertoire,
! which includes chants from I h e
1 middle ages, pieces from Bach
: and Handed, and music from Gil
j bort and Sullivan operettas and
Broadway shows. Activity credit
is available to members.
GLEE ( LI B SELECTIONS will

. forty members. Tryouts for new
j members will be held today from
•1 to 6 p.m. and Monday from 8 to
9:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel rehearsal
hall. Tenors especially are needed.
Most, of the campus hoard the
club last quarter during dead
week when the group sang carols
in the dorms and entertained stu
dents cramming in the library.
Despite the singer's hoarse voices,

many students took a study break
to hear them.
The club had an opportunity to
test its scope last spring. Down in
the Watsonville area on a one
day road trip, they sang in several
places and were treated to a mag
nificent dinner before a final con
cert at Hardnell College.
The club was in a merry mood
until the men saw the audience

filing in. "They were coming in
off their artichoke farms in dark
suits and white ties, and we began
to realize that these people ex
pected a serious concert," Tatum
remembers. The forced mood
held — with great sucess till the
intermission. Then it was de
serted; they sang rollicking bal
lads and comic opera songs for
the rest of Ihe evening. Much lo
Ihe club's relief, the audience
liked these as well.
This quarter an informal
concert in Tresidder is planned;
the big events are reserved for
next spring an invitational
performance at San Francisco's
plush Sunday Salon Series and a
formal concert in DinkelspieJ. Al
so scheduled for this quarter,
however, are a dinner party fol
lowed by a dance in the Museum
and several informal gatherings
in members' apartments.
LAST QUAKTHIt the club alsu
sang at the Krug wineries in Napa
for Stanford alumni of the Napa
Valley area. The club entertained
at a luncheon held in the middle
of a warehouse. It was the only
time in the club's history that
the group sang surrounded by
cases of wine. A tour of the win
ery and wine "tasting" followed.
"It was an amazing trip back,"
publicity chairman John Tatum
recalls.
None ol the members arc seri
ous music students even th e
accompanist studies engineering.
They are just "men who like to
sing and sing well," says club
president Lack.
Academic as well as activity
credit is available for members,
since the club has been adopted
by the music department. But
