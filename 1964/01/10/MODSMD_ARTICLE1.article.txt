## Peace Corps Lists 4 Steps to Service Abroad 
### BONNIE MARSH of the Minnesota Daily 
In the Peace Corps Washington
offices — where there seems to be
more bustle than around a cata
logue mail order desk — it appears
impossible that prospective Volun
teers could receive individual atten
tion. But they do.

Some say that it is this emphasis
on the individual that keeps the
Peace Corps alive and growing, and
forestalls the bureaucracy which
plagues other government agencies.
With up to 7,000 requests for
information coming in each week
and 3,600 Questionnaires a month,
how does the Peace Corps even
begin to place a person in a pro

gram and see that he stays happy
and effective while on the job? In
other words, how does a person
who is interested in working for
the Peace Corps overseas go about
getting there?
Application
The answer is simple, in the words
of one staff member: "Apply."
To do this, an applicant must fill

out a Questionnaire, available at his
local post office. This is not a test,
but a probe into such things as
citizenship and marital status, medi
cal information, and especially into
skills and schooling. It also asks for
farm, trade, foreign travel and
teaching experience, and in addition
lists 201 skills from which the ap
plicant is to choose three as his

major interests. College students
indicate how many credits they
have in certain areas.
Applicants are given a page to
answer the question, "What do you
hope to accomplish by serving with
the Peace Corps?" This answer is
regarded as important because it
indicates the motivation of the
applicant.
