university professors in Ciudad Bol
ivar, Venezuela. They are Robert
Amove, who holds a B.A. from the
University of Michigan and an M.A.

Seely, a graduate of Dartmouth.)
Our role as English teachers
abroad has been tempered by the
fact that we are Peace Corps Vol
unteers representing a new concept
in U.S. diplomacy in a politically
very sensitive and revolutionary
area, the Latin American univer
sity. As English teachers we can
donate a technical skill needed by
the university. As Peace Corps
Volunteers, we must also partici
pate in a much wider circle of ideas
and social relationships which are
compatible with the philosophy of
the Alliance for Progress.
The English class and the role
of teaching, we maintain, must be
viewed within a far more embrac
ing perspective. While here to teach
the English language and maintain
the highest professional standards
in doing so, we have also found our
selves serving other, if not higher,
purposes.
In the university we can serve a
useful role by exacting discipline
and honesty in examinations, incul
cating habits of study and research,
pointing up the use of a library,
and counseling the students outside
of class. In the evening classes we
have used the classroom as an in
strument for cutting across what
ever class lines may exist, bringing
people together from all social
strata without discrimination. We
have used the classroom as a me
dium in which to elucidate issues
and expand the outlook of our stu
dents.
