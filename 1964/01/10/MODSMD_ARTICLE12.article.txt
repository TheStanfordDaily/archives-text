The U.S. public school systems
temporary loss of teachers to the
Peace Corps is actually an invest
ment in better teachers, according
to Wayne O. Reed, U.S. Deputy
Director of Education.
"We must set a precedent on how
we husband our time," Reed said.
"Education is a most important fac
tor in our foreign relations pro
gram. Teachers that have an oppor
tunity to see people in a society
th;U is underdeveloped can return
to the States more valuable than
when they left."
Reed agreed that one of the most
valuable investments we can make
in our own future is to boost our
foreign teacher exchange program
"The Peace Corps is a tremen
dous idea . . . all reports I have
received have been very positive.
It has a definite service aspect."
Reed believes that by sending
Volunteers to other countries to
teach the people, they will return
to the classrooms of the United
States with a better understanding
of foreign economies and societies
than any textbook could ever hope
to explain.
"It's a two way street." Reed
said. "No country can build a wall
of sophistication around itself. I
believe that the future of this coun
try lies in the classroom. The
nation will bend and change ac
cording to the way the children
arc taught."
