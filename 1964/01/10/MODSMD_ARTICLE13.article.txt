# After the Peace Corps: A New Self-Knowledge
## 
### STEVEN V. ROBERTS of the Harvard Crimson 
Reticence is not a trait particularly
characteristic of most Peace Corps Vol
unteers. Words are hardly ever a scarce
commodity, even when a Volunteer is
500 miles of dirt road away from the
nearest supply of cement or textbooks.
One evening Georgianna Shine, a Volun
teer teaching English in Ghana, was talk
ing to the watchman at her school com
pound. They discussed their families,
their villages ("His village is Ougadou
gou. Upper Volta; my village is New
Britain, Conn., with 85,000 people."),
their work, their education.
Mumoonev, the watchman, said to the
American girl who had recently taught
him English, "This be best way to know
ing how world be. You travel, you see
other man's way, other tribes, see white
man's way, see other people and how they
live. Then you go think what the best way
for you and your people. You go back
your village, talk to the children, you tell
them other man's way. Then they know
how world be, then they be better
people."
Educational Adventure
These words, simple as they are, come
close to describing what happens to a
Volunteer during his term of service. The
Peace Corps is a profound educational
adventure, an extension of the indi
vidual's sphere of experience in ways
hardly possible at home. Having seen
"other man's way" for two years, 700
Peace Corps Volunteers will return by
the end of December. They will come
back to their "villages," and "talk to the
children." What these Volunteers have
learned, and what others will learn from
them, could, as their numbers grow, have
a significant effect on how Americans
view the world and themselves.
After talking to several of these return
ing Volunteers it is clear few fail to learn
from their Peace Corps experience, or
avoid being changed by it. Many of the
changes are obvious. Georgianna Shine
wanted to study English in graduate
school, and will now most likely under
take African studies. George Kroon. a
community developer in Colombia, will
study that subject in London next year
although he majored in business admin
istration. Eugene Schreiber received an
engineering degree from Purdue; now,
after teaching surveying and English in
Tanganyika, he will enter the foreign
service. Other engineers and geologists
returning from Tanganyika will enter law
schools, African studies programs, and
graduate schools of philosophy.
And as one would expect, most Volun
teers learned a great deal about the coun
try and the people with whom they
worked.
The Volunteers were instructed to stay
out of local politics, but sometimes they
could not help getting involved, as when
a local chief attempted to thwart a build
ing project in Colombia. But just in the
normal course of existence the oppor
tunities were limitless for gaining insights
into the social, political, and religious
attitudes of the people.
The value to the Volunteers of living
in another country was not limited to a
deep understanding of that society. In
their separation from the United States,
and in their immersion in a different cul
ture, they gained a new perspective on
their own country anil a new sense ol
objectivity.
George Kroon said "We don't want to
fall back in the same rut," and Ralph
Thomas expressed the hope that "1 won't
join the ulcer brigade." Returning Corps

men manifest a critical understanding of
both domestic political affairs and such
programs as foreign aid. It is not sur
prising that many will enter government
service immediately or after further study.
If the Volunteers are able to make
more reasoned and objective judgments,
many have also returned with a renewed
appreciation of the United States and its
policies. Perhaps this is because many of
their basic precepts about American life
for the first time withstood severe
scrutiny. Kroon added that one "is more
sensitive to the things that can harm
America, and trends within the society
that aren't very healthy."
Dr. Joe Colmcn, Peace Corps research
director, said that returning Corpsmen
tend to be more tolerant of opposing
ideas, and this too was corroborated by
the Volunteers. Georgianna Shine said
"You learn to accept things without tak
ing them on yourself, although some
times that's not so easy."
The most significant element in the
education of a Volunteer, however, is the
changes wrought in his own personality.
Simply, the Volunteer learns to do things
for himself. Most Corpsmen were placed
in a position where there was little or no
structure to their operations. "You had
to carve out your own niche" George
Kroon remarked. And there was hardly
any "expert" advice or supervision. "No
one told me what to do or how to do it."
In addition. Volunteers were often
given tremendous responsibilities from
the beginning, since they were often the
most educated people in the area. A
teacher in Nigeria was made headmaster
of his school. Gene Schreiber said a sur
veyor in Tanganyika could find himself
in charge of 200 men. "We were com
pletely on our own, with responsibility
we would not have for another seven or
ten years, if we were in the States."
High-Level Responsibility
While some Volunteers felt they had
had the opportunity to be on their own
in college, all noted that the intensity of
their Peace Corps experience was in
comparable with any other. In a Ques
tionnaire answered by returning Corps
men the question "What did you like best
about your service" most often drew the
following general answer: "Discharging
a high level of responsibility with a great
deal of freedom and initiative."
Dr. Colmen, who is currently com
piling the results of the tests administered
to returning Volunteers, said that the in
dividual Corpsman was subjected to far

more severe challenges than he had faced
in college, or that a person of his age
would meet in the United States. The
result of all this is that the average Vol
unteer grows up very quickly, develops
a poise and self-reliance seldom found
in people of his age.
But it is a quiet self-confidence, that
does not manifest itself in bravado. Many
Volunteers are actually embarrassed by
press coverage which makes them out to
be a collection of geniuses or supermen.
"Sometimes 1 feel like a phony when 1
read stories about us," Georgianna Shine
said. Their attitude is best described as
self-assurance tempered by a humility
built up after two years of almost unre
mitting frustration. The challenges of
their job were so severe, that after two
years many feel they can handle just
about anything that comes along. But
they also understand, as Ralph Thomas
points out, that everything cannot be
done at once, or ever, and that one has to
learn to settle for the possible. Everyone
has grand visions when they set out, but
for most, like Miss Shine, "success be

comes making your students understand
the past tense."
Perhaps education is, in the end, get
ting to know oneself. And this, above
all, happens to Peace Corps Volunteers.
In facing the tests and challenges of their
jobs they come to know their own capa
bilities and limitations, and from this self
knowledge springs their self-confidence.
And it is this opportunity for self-knowl
edge that most of them found lacking in
their college careers. "College is a shell,
a half-life" says Georgianna Shine, be
cause one only knows things intellectu
ally, not through experience.
The Peace Corps Volunteers now re
turning have, like Mumooney the watch
man, been learning the "other man's
way," and thus have come to understand
themselves and their country with deeper
insight. Thus too, they will be better
teachers of their children, and better citi
zens of a wiser and more humane nation.
