## PEACE CORPS: A Woman's World? 
### BONNIE MARSH of The Minnesota Daily 
Is it really a woman's world —
as they say?
Women in the Peace Corps have
had a unique opportunity to test
the worldwide aspect of this Ameri
can adage, and they report that
women do, indeed, wield even more
influence around the world than is
commonly suspected.
This makes the woman in the
Peace Corps more important than
is commonly suspected, according
to Nan McEvoy, deputy director of
Africa programs and one of the
Corps' "'leading ladies."
Almost one-third of the Volun
teers in most projects are women,
she explained, "because women
round out the picture" on a project.
For example, women can bring
hygienic practices into the home,
where they are most important. A
man Volunteer can teach classes in
how to bury garbage, but a woman
can go into homes and teach how
to care for and feed babies health
fully, or how to wash dishes.
In short, women seem to have a
unique role abroad, a role second
ary to their regular assignments,
which can he summed up as combi
nation home economics teacher
4-H Club leader — hygiene consul
tant — interior decorator — child
care consultant — dietitian.

The Peace Corps needs qualified
women, "in fact. I would say that
if every qualified woman in the
United States were to apply to the
Peace Corps, we could use her,"
Mrs. McEvoy said.
But what does "qualified" mean?
Here, as in all Peace Corps selec
tion criteria, complexities enter.
One country may ask for 15 regis
tered nurses w ho speak French, for
example, and this limits the field.
However, on projects such as com
munity development, qualifications
may be less limiting, and this is the
opportunity for a woman with no
particular skill.
"A little knowledge about many
things is obviously useful," Mrs.
McEvoy said. The key word in
Volunteer selection is "attitude,"
and the adventurous, versatile
woman can be an asset in situations
that require imagination and a host
of ideas.
Some women arc especially
trained by the Peace Corps to teach

nutrition or hygiene. But on the
other hand, spontaneous cases may
arise where a Volunteer has an op
portunity to teach a Saturday class
in home decorating. It is here that
a woman has a unique opportunity
to tap her knowledge as a woman.
American women are brought up
with sound attitudes about cleanli
ness, nutrition, cooking, and home
decorating skills. Although they
may not know it. they are often
equipped by this exposure alone to
teach and to set an example.
Charlotte Hough, a Volunteer
who has recently returned from a
teaching assignment in the Philip
pines, tells this anecdote about set
ting an example. The women in
the settlement where she lived had
no furniture in their homes -
simply bare floors.
When Miss Hough arrived, she
arranged her home as attractively
as she could while still maintaining
the Peace Corps ideal of simple,
modest living. She planted flowers
around her house, furnished it in
bamboo, and then built a fence
around it. A bamboo bed cost her
$1 (American money) in a furni
ture store in a nearby village.
The Filipino women were curi
ous. of course, about her home.
After Miss Hough became ac
quainted in the community, they
began to visit her. One woman,
after many visits, came one day
and asked how much the bed had
cost. "Five pesos." So the woman
pulled out five pesos and asked Miss
Hough to buy a bed the next time
she went to the village on the bus.
Soon all the women in town
wanted beds, anil Miss Hough had
to use a Peace Corps truck to carry

all the beds back to the settlement.
It is difficult for men to establish
this kind of rapport with women.
Miss Hough said. American women
arc prepared by their experience to
set examples of clean homes, per
sonal cleanliness and creativity.
Although the people in the com
munity accused her of "working
like a man," actually the men did
not resent her bringing these new
ideas to their women. Miss Hough
said. The women arc often very
powerful in the Philippines because
they control the purse strings and
run (he household while the men
fish. Therefore, the men welcome
devices which make their women
more efficient.
Ingenuity Hot Tool
In teaching this efficiency, in
genuity is the best tool of the
woman Volunteer, Miss Hough
said.
In the Philippines, living condi
tions were no problem for the
women, but what about other parts
of the world? Generally women
Volunteers are not sent to places
where it would be too difficult for
them to live, but on the other hand.
Volunteers arc not usually excluded
anywhere on the basis of sex alone.
Janet Boegli. who served two
years on a Chile community devel
opment project, said living condi
tions are the least of the problems
a woman Volunteer has to face.
She cooked on a wood stove and
had no refrigerator, but said she
adjusted with no difficulty. The
nationals are used to living without
these conveniences, she said, and it
is surprising how quickly an out
sider can learn to do without.
Women do encounter a special

problem in Chile, however. Miss
boegli said — a problem not un
common in other parts of the world.
"A nice woman is not seen alone
on the streets," she said, "and this
often limits a Volunteer. However,
the men Volunteers and Chilean
co-workers "adopted" her and
would "escort" her in town.
Apparently, then, the stereotype
of a woman Volunteer living in a
mud hut surrounded by natives is
false.
In the first place, women are
sent only where there are jobs for
them to do — and jobs do not in
clude clearing the jungle.
Secondly, most societies are very
protective toward women. The
classic example is the community
that became so worried about the
safety of a woman Volunteer (in
their opinion neglected by the «
Peace Corps) that they posted two '

24-hour-a-day guards by her house
so no guests could get in without
her permission. "Guests" included
the Volunteer's own visitors.
In Africa, where most job re
quests are for teachers, the govern
ments are eager to provide good
housing for all their teachers, and
Peace Corps Volunteers therefore
have quite adequate facilities, with
few exceptions.
It is evident from the fact that
only one-third of the Peace Corps
Volunteers arc women that the
Peace Corps is not a woman's
world. It is evident, too, that there
arc ninny places the Peace Corps
goes and many things it docs that
women simply cannot help with.
Hut there is a new realization of the
importance of American women
abroad in Volunteer capacities, and
it is this realization which leads the
Corps to seek qualified, versatile
women for overseas duty.


PEACE CORPS WOMEN have proven their ability to adapt. Malinda

as a public health nurse on St. Lucia.
