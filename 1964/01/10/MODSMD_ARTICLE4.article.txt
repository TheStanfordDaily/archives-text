# Peace Corps' Future Bright, Shriver Says
## Sees Challenge For New PCVs 
### ROGER EBERT of the Daily Illini 
The fundamental challenge fac
ing the Peace Corps at the start of
its third year, according to Director
R. Sargent Shrivcr, can be stated
simply:
"As young Americans realize
how unglamorous and unromantic
the work of developing nations can
he, will they be tricked into believ
ing it is also unimportant?"
Shriver said in an interview that
new waves of Peace Corps Volun
teers will he called upon to remain
"persevering and determined —
despite the fact that service is not
quite as romantic as it first appeared
to be."
He said Volunteers actually have
harder jobs now, and are faced
with more meaningful challenges.
"The first Volunteers could afford
to make mistakes, simply because

they were the first," Shriver said.
! "But now the work is mapped out
for us and we have a fine tradition
of two years of service which we
must maintain."
According to Shriver, the first
two years of the Peace Corps ex
perience have provided a clear-cut
answer for cynics who asked, "How
j can you expect to accomplish any
i thing when even experts have
failed?"
"As the first returns from Peace
Corps projects are studied," he said,
! "we are becoming more and more
aware that Americans of 23, 24. 25
and 26 years of age not only can
match the work of the experts —
[ but arc, in fact, often better."
Shriver said experts require ex
tensive equipment and often are
capable of working only in sharply
limited areas. On the other hand,
young people who are creative and
| adaptable, and who can work with
the tools at hand, can often achieve
better results in an underdeveloped
society.
"The Bolivian ambassador re
cently warned us, in fact, not to
'select* ourselves out of business,"
the Peace Corps director said. "He
pointed out that most of the people
Volunteers work with do not have
extensive educations, and can often
i he reached most effectively by Vol
unteers who are capable of con
sistent. determined elfort over long
periods of time — regardless of
| education."
Another challenge facing the
Peace Corps, Shriver said, is the
need to recognize that progress is
often slow and discouraging in
I developing nations.

"Volunteers sometimes grow dis
couraged when, so to speak, they
succeed in moving the ball only
from the 50-yard line to the 49-
yard line," Shriver said. "They fail
to realize that, in many cases, it
may be the first time the ball has
ever moved at all."

"As the first returns from Peace
Corps projects are studied," he said,
! "we are becoming more and more
aware that Americans of 23, 24. 25
and 26 years of age not only can
match the work of the experts —
[ but arc, in fact, often better."
Shriver said experts require ex
tensive equipment and often are
capable of working only in sharply
limited areas. On the other hand,
young people who are creative and

the tools at hand, can often achieve
better results in an underdeveloped
society.
"The Bolivian ambassador re
cently warned us, in fact, not to
'select* ourselves out of business,"
the Peace Corps director said. "He
pointed out that most of the people
Volunteers work with do not have
extensive educations, and can often

unteers who are capable of con
sistent. determined elfort over long
periods of time — regardless of

Another challenge facing the
Peace Corps, Shriver said, is the
need to recognize that progress is
often slow and discouraging in
I developing nations.

"Volunteers sometimes grow dis
couraged when, so to speak, they
succeed in moving the ball only
from the 50-yard line to the 49-
yard line," Shriver said. "They fail
to realize that, in many cases, it
may be the first time the ball has
ever moved at all."


PEACE CORPS DIRECTOR Sargent Shriver sees a challenge — and a
promise —in the Peace Corps future. Shriver discusses the Peace
Corps program in Honduras with a group of Volunteers and nationals.
The fundamental challenge fac
ing the Peace Corps at the start of
its third year, according to Director
R. Sargent Shrivcr, can be stated
simply:
"As young Americans realize
how unglamorous and unromantic
the work of developing nations can
he, will they be tricked into believ
ing it is also unimportant?"
Shriver said in an interview that
new waves of Peace Corps Volun
teers will he called upon to remain
"persevering and determined —
despite the fact that service is not
quite as romantic as it first appeared
to be."
He said Volunteers actually have
harder jobs now, and are faced
with more meaningful challenges.
"The first Volunteers could afford
to make mistakes, simply because

they were the first," Shriver said.
! "But now the work is mapped out
for us and we have a fine tradition
of two years of service which we
must maintain."
According to Shriver, the first
two years of the Peace Corps ex
perience have provided a clear-cut
answer for cynics who asked, "How
j can you expect to accomplish any
i thing when even experts have
failed?"
