# Coffin Says Volunteers Complement AID Work
## 
### RICHARD SIMMONS of The Western Washington State Collegian 
Taxpayers have leveled criticism
at the Peace Corps and the Agency
for International Development for
duplicating each other in United
States foreign service projects in
other countries.
But Frank Coffin, Deputy Direc
tor of AID, which spends about
$4 billion annually on 2,700 proj
ects throughout the world, feels
that the two organizations comple
ment rather than duplicate each
other's work.
"AID tries to give technical
training assistance," Coffin said,
"while the Peace Corps Volunteer
goes in and works on an individual '
level with the people."
Often the Peace Corps does the
first technical work of surveying
for schools or hospitals and then
AID comes in with the funds to
construct the buildings and set up
training programs, he said.
"When we can't afford to put the
individual into the field to work
with the people, the Peace Corps
has come through very well with
Volunteers," Coffin noted. "We,

hope to set up a training program
in our own organization so that
returning Volunteers can continue
their foreign service work with
AID after they finish with the
Corps."
AID receives more money than
the Peace Corps but its work in
volves more construction projects
and longer range investments in
foreign assistance.
"AID may be criticized for build
ing a dam and the Peace Corps
complimented for teaching natives,"
Coffin said, "but what good can
the educated native do without the
facilities supplied by the power
from the dam?"
In answer to the question of
whether a foreign service agency
should attempt to recruit as many
Volunteers as possible at the ex
pense of some quality. Coffin noted
that an agency should always seek
the best people and develop them
in the best possible manner.
"The American people must real
ize that there is a long road ahead
for the Peace Corps and for AID.
We can't move too fast and we
can't afford to overstep our organi
zational limits," Coffin said. "They
must realize that we must stick
with projects like the Peace Corps."
