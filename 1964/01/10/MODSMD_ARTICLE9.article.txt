# Steps to Service...

The applicant is then asked to
furnish at least six references, and
preferably ten or twelve. For col
lege students at least three of these
should be professors or administra
j tive staff members. In addition,
applicants are asked to indicate the
name and address of the one person
who knows them best. It may be
; a relative.
Selection
This is one of the indefinite areas
in the Peace Corps. When a per-
I son applies, he has noway of know
| ing if he will be accepted. Only
one person in six is accepted for
training, but these statistics do not
give a fair picture, especially to col
lege students. For instance, after a
recruiting program at the Univer
! sity of Wisconsin one out of two
applicants was finally selected. The
Peace Corps cannot be definite
about selection procedures, for it is
dealing with abstracts such as atti
tude and motivation, skill and
j dedication.
The wceding-out process starts
I as soon as the Questionnaires get to
the Washington office. Information
from applicants passing' a citizen
ship, health and marital status
j r
check is coded and put on IBM
j cards. Skills and experience are
, coded ready for grouping.
At the same time references are
! being checked. Reference forms
| arc sent to the persons the appli

cant has mentioned asking him to
rate the applicant on job compe
tence, emotional stability and rela
tions with other people.
One bad reference cannot exclude
a candidate.
All this information, together
with any further medical informa
tion required, is put in a folder,
the applicant's permanent record.
Then when a request comes in from
a country for a group of Volunteers
with certain qualifications, the IBM
cards are run through until all the
persons who could teach geology
are sorted out, for example.
Selection for training is done by
checking the Questionnaire and
comparing such things as all-round
experience and motivation.
Training
Selection is not complete until a
Volunteer has finally been chosen
to go overseas. During training the
applicant is in a goldfish bowl. He
' is observed by faculty members at
the university where he is training,
I and by Peace Corps representatives.
Training is devoted to providing
each trainee with skills necessary
overseas, and understanding of the
U. S. and contemporary affairs.
Twice during training a selection
board views all the information
about a trainee and recommends
whether or not he should be sent
overseas. A background check by
the Civil Service Commission and
a psychological assessment is also
made.

The Division of Volunteer Sup
port is responsible for physical
support of the Volunteer once he
begins training, and for moral
support once he is overseas.
T he liaison branch of the division
looks after the Volunteer as an indi
vidual. This is a new branch of the
organization which handles any re
quests or suggestions from the field
and any problems that may arise.
In short, the Volunteer is more
than a number to the Peace Corps.
There is time amid the bustle for
individual attention to requests and
applications. The Volunteer and
prospective Volunteer are the core
! of the organization.
