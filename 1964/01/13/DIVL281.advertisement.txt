THE ESSENCE

"Now let me remind you, brothers, of what the Gospel really is, for it
has not changed— it is the same Good News 1 preached to you before.
You welcomed it and still do, for your faith is squarely built upon this
wonderful message; and it is this Good News that saves you if you still
firmly believe it, unless of course, you never really believed it in the
first place. I passed on to you right from the first what had been told to
me, that Christ died for our sius just as the Seriptures said He would,
and that He was buried, and that on the third day afterwards He arose
from the grave, again just as the Bible foretold. lie was seen by Peter
and later on by the rest of 'The Twelve'. After that he was seen by more
than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom are still alive
though some are dead. Then James saw Him and later all the apostles.
Last of all I saw Him too . . .
"Hut tell me this! Since you believe what we preach, that Christ rose
from the dead, why are some of you saying that there is no such thing
as a resurrection day coming when all will come back to life again? For
if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ must still be dead.
And if He is still dead, then all our preaching is useless and your trust
in God is empty, worthless, hopeless; and we apostles are all liars be
cause we have said that God raised Christ from the grave, and of course,
that isn't true if the dead do not come back to life again. If they don't,
then Christ is still dead, and you are very foolish to keep on trusting
God to have you. and you are still under condemnation tor your sins;
In that ease all Christians who have died are lost! And if being a Chris
tian is only of value to tis now in this life, we are the most miserable
of creatures. But the fact is that Christ did actually rise from the dead,
and has become the first of millions now dead who will come back to
life again some day.
Death came into the world because of what one man (Adam) did, and
it is because of what this other man (Christ) has done that now there is
the resurrection from the dead. Everyone dies because all of us are
related to Adam, being members of his sinful race, and wherever there
is sin, death results. But all who are related to Christ will rise again.
Each, however, in his own turn: Christ rose first; then when Christ comes
back, all His people will become alive again. After that the end will
come when He will turn the Kingdom over to God the 112 ather, having
put down all enemies of every kind. For Christ will be King until He
lias destroyed all His enemies, including the last enemy—death. This too
must be destroyed and ended. For the rule and authority over all things
has been given to Christ by His Father, except, of course, Christ does
not ride over the Father Himself, Who gave Him this power. When
Christ has finally won the battle against all His enemies, then He, the
Son of God, will put Himself also under His Father's orders, so that
God Who has given Him the victory over everything else will be utterly
supreme . . .
"... If we will never live again after we die, then we might as well
Co out and have ourselves a good time: let us eat, drink, and be merry.
What's the difference? For tomorrow we die, and that ends everything!
Don't be fooled by those who say such things. II you listen to them
you will start acting like them. Wake up up from your drunken dreams
and return to your right minds and stop sinning. For to your shame I
say it, some of you are not even Christians at all and have never really
known God." 1 Cor. 15 L.L.
Every Christian is a person who once did not believe the Gospel, but
who know rejoices with the certain of his salvation, sure beyond doubt
of the truth of the above passages because he has met Jesus Clirist on
a personal basis as Lord and Saviour.

You welcomed it and still do, for your faith is squarely built upon this
wonderful message; and it is this Good News that saves you if you still

me, that Christ died for our sius just as the Seriptures said He would,
and that He was buried, and that on the third day afterwards He arose
from the grave, again just as the Bible foretold. lie was seen by Peter

"Hut tell me this! Since you believe what we preach, that Christ rose
from the dead, why are some of you saying that there is no such thing
as a resurrection day coming when all will come back to life again? For
if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ must still be dead.
And if He is still dead, then all our preaching is useless and your trust
in God is empty, worthless, hopeless; and we apostles are all liars be
cause we have said that God raised Christ from the grave, and of course,
that isn't true if the dead do not come back to life again. If they don't,
then Christ is still dead, and you are very foolish to keep on trusting
God to have you. and you are still under condemnation tor your sins;
In that ease all Christians who have died are lost! And if being a Chris
tian is only of value to tis now in this life, we are the most miserable
of creatures. But the fact is that Christ did actually rise from the dead,
and has become the first of millions now dead who will come back to
life again some day.
Death came into the world because of what one man (Adam) did, and
it is because of what this other man (Christ) has done that now there is
the resurrection from the dead. Everyone dies because all of us are
related to Adam, being members of his sinful race, and wherever there
is sin, death results. But all who are related to Christ will rise again.
Each, however, in his own turn: Christ rose first; then when Christ comes
back, all His people will become alive again. After that the end will
come when He will turn the Kingdom over to God the 112 ather, having
put down all enemies of every kind. For Christ will be King until He
lias destroyed all His enemies, including the last enemy—death. This too
must be destroyed and ended. For the rule and authority over all things
has been given to Christ by His Father, except, of course, Christ does
not ride over the Father Himself, Who gave Him this power. When
Christ has finally won the battle against all His enemies, then He, the
Son of God, will put Himself also under His Father's orders, so that
God Who has given Him the victory over everything else will be utterly
supreme . . .
"... If we will never live again after we die, then we might as well
Co out and have ourselves a good time: let us eat, drink, and be merry.
What's the difference? For tomorrow we die, and that ends everything!
Don't be fooled by those who say such things. II you listen to them
you will start acting like them. Wake up up from your drunken dreams
and return to your right minds and stop sinning. For to your shame I
say it, some of you are not even Christians at all and have never really
known God." 1 Cor. 15 L.L.
Every Christian is a person who once did not believe the Gospel, but
who know rejoices with the certain of his salvation, sure beyond doubt
of the truth of the above passages because he has met Jesus Clirist on
a personal basis as Lord and Saviour.
