## Brandeis Prof Describes Early Christian Theories 
### MALCOLM MACKENZIE 
Does history repeat itself in regular, unending cycles, or is it
moving in a straight line toward a definite goal? These questions
were (he bases of an examination of the theories of early Christians
and their pagan contemporaries made Friday afternoon by Dr. Frank
C. Manuel, professor of history at Brandeis University.

The lecture, "The Wicked Dance
in Circles: Early Christians
against the Pagans," was the first
in a series of seven on "Shapes
of Philosophical History," which
Manuel will be delivering through
Thursday.
According to Manuel, any phi
losophy of history must lean to
wards what he consider one of
the two basic ways of looking at
movement. Either history follows
a cyclical course with no end or
permanent advancement where
the same types of events regu
larly reoccur, or else events build
on one another until they arrive
at a definite, purposeful climax.
All historical writings of the
ancient Graeco-Roman world ad
hered to t lie so-called cyclical
theory, Manuel said. Such men as
the Roman historian Polybius and
the Greek philosophers Plato and
Aristotle felt that history was a
perpetual cycle.
Manuel explained that the ad
vent of Christianity introduced a
new element. For the first time
men felt the progression of his
tory to be leading towards an
end — specifically a last judg
ment.
To challenge the ideas of pagan
historians, first century Chris
tians had to explain just where
and how this "end" that they
foresaw to history was coming.
Manuel mentioned four resulting
historical systems.
One, based on the Book of Dan
iel in the Bible, sees the epochs

of succeeding history as compris
ing four earthly kingdoms three
unknown -at the end of which
man will be judged.
The triad view looks to three
divisions, and, what Manuel calls
"sabbatical millenarianism" fore
sees seven earthly millenia be
fore die last judgment, the seven
millenia corresponding to the
classic seven days of creation.
The fourth early Christian phi
losophy of history that of Au
gustine—will be the topic of Ma
nuel's second lecture, which will
be delivered this afternoon at 4:15
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

and how this "end" that they
foresaw to history was coming.
Manuel mentioned four resulting
historical systems.
One, based on the Book of Dan
iel in the Bible, sees the epochs

of succeeding history as compris
ing four earthly kingdoms three
unknown -at the end of which
man will be judged.
The triad view looks to three
divisions, and, what Manuel calls
"sabbatical millenarianism" fore
sees seven earthly millenia be
fore die last judgment, the seven
millenia corresponding to the
classic seven days of creation.
The fourth early Christian phi
losophy of history that of Au
gustine—will be the topic of Ma
nuel's second lecture, which will
be delivered this afternoon at 4:15
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
