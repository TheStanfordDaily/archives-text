# Yale Chaplain Will Be Guest in Frosh Dorm
## 
### 
The Reverend William Sloane Coffin, Chaplain al Yale Univer
sity, will be guest-in-residence at Wilbur Hall this week.
Coffin was one of the first Freedom Riders and was arrested
in connection with that movement in 1961. His case is now pending
before the Supreme Court.
In addition, Coffin has been very active in the Crossroads Africa
program, recently led a group to-*- — ——

Guinea for a year. He will end his
stay at Stanford on Thursday,
January 16, with a speech in
Dinkspiel Auditorium at 4 p.m.
entitled "A Christian's View of
Civil Rights."
The guest-in-residence program
seeks to provide students with a
fuller knowledge of important
people and their ideas than could
be achieved through a formal
speaking situation. Guests are
brought into close contact with
the students.
In the past, guests-in-residence
at Wilbur have included Dr. Eric
Fromm; Reverend James H. Rob
inson, founder and now director
of the Crossroads Africa Pro
gram; and Paul Goodman, social
critics and author. Future guests
include Senator Frank Church
(D.-Idaho) in February and Eu
gene Burdick. It is hoped that a
group of four Congressmen will
visit Wilbur later this year.
