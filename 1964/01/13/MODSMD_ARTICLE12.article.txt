In his first political speech since the assassination of President
Kennedy, Rep. Robert Wilson of San Diego, chairman of the Repub
lican National Congressional Campaign Committee, lashed out Fri
day afternoon at the lale Chief Executive's successor, Lyndon B.
Johnson, for his "strongarm tactics" and "two-faced stands."

Young Republicans that he and
his follow members of the GOP
intend to make this "a very poli
tical year," Wilson launched his
address by stating that the oppo
sition's "enforced honeymoon"
with President Johnson is over,
having been killed by the Presi
dent's forcing the House of Rep
resentatives to remain in session
until Christmas Eve in order to
pass the bill permitting the sale
of wheat to the Soviet Union.
Rep. Wilson went on to blast:
Johnson's State of the Union mes
sage as containing "promises
that can't be kept, if the budget
is to be cut, as President Johnson
claims." Continuing his partisan
tirade, Wilson next called the
President "two-faced" for his
"Conservative" stands in the
South and "Liberal" positions 011
the same issues, when speaking
in the Northern industrial states.
CONGRESSMAN WILSON at
tempted to enumerate what he
considers to be the differences be
tween the Democratic and Repub
lican Parlies, as typified by the
Republicans in the House and the
D e m o c r a t i c "White House
Crowd," said to include such fig
ures as Robert Kennedy, Arthur
Sehlesinger Jr., Adam Yarmolin
ski. Water Heller, Chester Bowles
and G. Mention Williams.
foremost among the differ
ences, Wilson says, is that the
Republicans trust and respect the
individual American, while the
"White House Crowd" says the
Federal Government "knows
best." Hence, says Wilson, the Re
publicans have a distrust for "Big
Government" while the "W bite
House Crowd," being in favor of
Big Government, "sneers at the
Constitution."
BRANDING the extension of

sale of wheat a "gift," Wilson
proceeded to call the foreign poli
cies of the "White House Crowd"
both "inconsistent" and evidence
of "wishful thinking."
Concluding his exposition of
campaign issues with a blanket
condemnation of Federal aid to
farmers and federal farm price
supports, Wilson went on to con
sider Republican chances in 1961.
THE REPUBLICANS made
gains in the House in 1960 and
1962, Wilson said, and he feels
that they can increase these in
1964, in addition to cutting into
the Democratic preponderance in
the Senate.
