# From Whence Cometh Our Religious Policy?
## 
### 
Tlit* most overwhelming trend evident to the reader of the
history of Stanford's religious policies is that over the years
we have narrowed as the times have pushed for broadening,
retrogressed as the cry has been for progress. And in a fashion
that would be inimical to Arnold Toynbee, the results do not
seem to be the product of specific planning or purpose on
anyone's part, but merely the result of the passing of passive,
directionless time.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford took a bold step for the 1890's
in establishing a university without denominational tics, and
Stanford was charged with being "a Godless University."
Mrs. Stanford herself was a woman whose denominational
ties varied from year to year, but whose commitment to reli
gion was strong. It is almost irrelevant to the current dis
cussion that the founders used the term "non-sectarian" in
days when the Protestant Ethic was the only religious orienta
tion considered. It would seem safe to say that were Mrs.
Stanford pacing Inner Quad today she would advocate oppor
tunity for worship on the campus for students of any faith.
Before Memorial Church was built, an informal chapel
was located on the spot that now houses the offices of the
Dean of Students and the deans of men and women. Alumni
recall services of all types there, and that one of the most
frequent speakers was a San Francisco rabbi. We are faced
with the fact that Memorial Church is definitely Protestant
in its irremovable accounterments, and this had made it diffi
cult for us to enlarge the scope of campus religious activity
in pace with the changes in the scope of American thought.
This fact should not close discussion, however, and need not
lower the discussion to consideration of erecting more build
ings. If our indefinite policy were set down boldly, it would
be the task of the various religious groups to do with their
freedom what they would.
This is not a policy which can be confined to student con
sideration. The students must look for discussion and action
to the Chaplain, the faculty, the deans, President, trustees—
the policy makers. Students do not operate in a vacuum, and
the very presence of their strong concern in this area is the
response to stimulus given by these people.
