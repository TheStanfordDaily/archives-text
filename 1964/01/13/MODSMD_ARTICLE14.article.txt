# Lyman Appointment Beneficial Stimulus
## 
### 
A benevolent star is watching over the fate of the Stanford
student and has pointed the way to the appointment to high
administrative position of men clearly empathetic with the
university student. Professor Richard Lyman's assumption of
the post of Associate Dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences cannot help but stimulate further concern by a large
body of students with the nature of their education. The
effects upon a student of knowing that a person of Dr. Lyman's
calibre is in a position of direct academic influence are subtle
but beneficial to the entire academic process. Dr. Lyman is
known to a great number of students as a man devoted to the
broadening of the individual student and not to the manipu
lation of an amorphous mass far below him. His own scholar
ship as evidenced by his classroom lectures reveals a man who
finds academics lively and relevant. It is to our great profit
that he has consented to accept his new post.
