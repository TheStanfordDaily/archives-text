# Effect of Peru's Co-ops Not Astounding, But Hopeful

Peru's first Credit Cooperative
was started in the small town of
Puno on the shores of Lake Titi
caca in 1955. An American Mis
sionary, Father Daniel McClel
lan, founded it with the purpose
of assisting the lower classes in
and around Puno in their eco
nomic situation. Starting with a
capital of 6,000 soles ($230) lent
by 100 people, the Coop invited
Indians to save five or ten soles
(20c or 30c) a month and receive
annual dividends of 6 r / ( on their
money. After three months of sav
ing the Indians could take out
loans up to twice their savings as
long as the rest of the loan was
covered by the savings of another
acceptable member. This other
member signed a guarantee to in
sure the rest of (he loan should
anything go wrong.
If a debtor didn't pay his loan,
the money from his and his
guarantor's accounts would sim
ply be transferred to the Coop;
and thus the system should be
foolproof. Interest rates of 1%
per month were charged, and
since the loans were almost all
very short term, this rate w a s
easier to pay than the banks' S r / (
yearly interest on loans. The
maximum loan the Coop could
make was 15,000 soles ($555), but
most Indians borrowed about
5,000 soles at a time and we r e
regular with their payments.
THE PUNO COOPERATIVE
has acquired in seven years a
capita] of 5,000,000 soles ($200,-
000) and it has made 8.500 loans

worth 38,000,000 soles ($1,500,-
000). It has done this entirely
without the help of any national
government, and only with the
advisory help of American mis
sionaries.
After this Coop started in Puno
the idea caught fire all over the
country, and now Peru has over
330 similar Coops. One of the
greatest problems for almost all
Ihese Coops is a lack of trained
personnel. Some 100 of Peru's
Coops have no trained economist,
and the new Federation of Co
operatives only has a handful to
help them. Other problems center
around Coop leaders who abscond
with the funds or extend large
loans to undeserving friends.
The effect of these cooperatives
upon the Peruvian Indian ha s
not been astounding, but it has
been significant. Many of the In
dians have developed a great in
terest and confidence in the coops,
and in so doing they are adjusting
to the pressures of the modern
world. The idea of saving and
earning interest on money is hard
to grasp, as is the concept of bor
rowing on interest. But many In
dians now are beginning to under
stand and benefit from these prin
ciples through the Coops.
ALSO, THE ECONOMIC im
pact of these Coops on Peru as a
whole must not be exaggerated.
The sums involved are so small i
that they don't appreciably affect i
either market prices or bank in
terest rates.
But generally Peru's booming |
Cooperative movement has been
a great success. Several other La- j
tin American countries are trying
to follow Peru's example, and
thus on this movement as a
glimpse of hope on the Latin
American scene.

rowing on interest. But many In

Peru's first Credit Cooperative
was started in the small town of
Puno on the shores of Lake Titi
caca in 1955. An American Mis
sionary, Father Daniel McClel
lan, founded it with the purpose
of assisting the lower classes in
and around Puno in their eco
nomic situation. Starting with a
capital of 6,000 soles ($230) lent
by 100 people, the Coop invited
Indians to save five or ten soles
(20c or 30c) a month and receive
annual dividends of 6 r / ( on their
money. After three months of sav
ing the Indians could take out
loans up to twice their savings as
long as the rest of the loan was
covered by the savings of another
acceptable member. This other
member signed a guarantee to in
sure the rest of (he loan should
anything go wrong.
If a debtor didn't pay his loan,
the money from his and his
guarantor's accounts would sim
ply be transferred to the Coop;
and thus the system should be
foolproof. Interest rates of 1%
per month were charged, and
since the loans were almost all
very short term, this rate w a s
easier to pay than the banks' S r / (
yearly interest on loans. The
maximum loan the Coop could
make was 15,000 soles ($555), but
most Indians borrowed about
5,000 soles at a time and we r e
regular with their payments.
THE PUNO COOPERATIVE
has acquired in seven years a
capita] of 5,000,000 soles ($200,-
000) and it has made 8.500 loans

worth 38,000,000 soles ($1,500,-
000). It has done this entirely
without the help of any national
government, and only with the
advisory help of American mis
sionaries.
After this Coop started in Puno
the idea caught fire all over the
country, and now Peru has over
330 similar Coops. One of the
greatest problems for almost all
Ihese Coops is a lack of trained
personnel. Some 100 of Peru's
Coops have no trained economist,
and the new Federation of Co
operatives only has a handful to
help them. Other problems center
around Coop leaders who abscond
with the funds or extend large
loans to undeserving friends.
The effect of these cooperatives
upon the Peruvian Indian ha s
not been astounding, but it has
been significant. Many of the In
dians have developed a great in
terest and confidence in the coops,
and in so doing they are adjusting
to the pressures of the modern
