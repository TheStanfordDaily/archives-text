BRANNER FOOD
Editor, The Daily:
We, as representatives of Bran
ner Hall, send our sincere sym
pathies to the deprived individ
uals who subsist on the sub
standard food offered at other
Stanford establishments.
There are four areas in which
other campus dining programs
are deficient. The first is their
variety in meals, which forces the
stomach to continually readapt.
Secondly, their undercooking, in
creases the probability of trich
inosis, and moreover, charcoal is
one of the best natural tooth
pastes. Thirdly, imagination is
lacking in developing all the in
herent resources. In the vegetable
category, there are unlimited pos
sibilities, such as left-over-broc
colli soup, the cucumber-celery
tomato-raisen-pea-egg-lettuce sal
ad, and our favorite entree: last
night's squash shells filled with

meatballs and draped with tomato
sauce. In the meat division, for
protein, Branner uses their fresh
silverfish in the vegetable soup.
And lastly, with sorrow, we have
observed the ever-increasing num
ber of muscle-bound jaws, de
veloped hy the rhewing of exces
sive quantities of meat. Th is
malady is undeniably absent in
Branner.
In the interest of the Stanford
community, we, as nutritional hu
manitarians, humbly propose a
system of rotation, which would
allow everyone to benefit from
the Branner cuisine. We would
willingly relinquish our privileges
for the greater good.
