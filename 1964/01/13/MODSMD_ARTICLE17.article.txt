# PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH SEMINAR
## Caffeine Yields Varied Extent of Wakefulness 
### RUTH ARNON 
"Caffeine unquestionably in
duces wakefulness in everyone,
but the extent of this wakefulness
may vary dramatically from per
son to person. His constitution
may also determine the degree to
which he craves coffee; he may
feel a strong need for coffee or
no need whatsoever.
This was one of the findings
which Dr. Avram Goldstein, Pro
fessor of Pharmacology, Stanford
School of Medicine, presented re
cently in his Psychiatry Depart
ment Research Seminar, "Studies
on Behavioral Effects of Caffeine
in humans." While stressing the
impossibility of a definitive pre
sentation, he summarized indica
tive rsults of his investigations
with caffeine.
That people vary enormously in
their sensitivity to coffee may be
attributed to two factors — hered
ity and coffee-drinking habits;
neither excludes the other. If
caffeine sensitivity is linked with
heredity, then a person's innate
constitution will determine his
sensitivity to coffee; he may have
to drink twice as much coffee as
another person to get a compar
able body reaction. Recent Italian
studies with twins substantiate
this last hypothesis; the coffee
drinking habits of monozygous
(identical) twins, living away
from each other, tended to be
much more similar than those of
dizygous (fraternal) twins, also
separated.
The other interpretation links
coffee sensitivity with habitual
coffee intake. The more coffee a
person accustoms himself to, ac
cording to this interpretation, the
greater becomes his tolerance of
it. Moderate doses gradually af
fect him loss; he increases his
intake to recapture the old level
of stimulation. Dr. Goldstein's in
vestigations bear this out: For
instance, Escondido Village house
wives, habitual non-coffee-drink
crs, felt jittery, even sick to their
stomachs, after an unaccustomed
morning cup of coffee. In strong
contrast, those housewives who
were habitual coffee-drinkers re
ported feeling stimulated and
more awake after a morning cup;
when they were unknowingly
given "coffee" without caffeine,
they reported a headache. The
headache they felt is the equiva
lent of a dope addict's withdrawal
symptoms. The coffee drinker,
then, develops a mild physical de-

I pendence on caffeine.
The rate and extent of caffeine
| absorption into the blood plasma
is the same for everyone, regard
less of their sensitivity or normal
J coffee intake; so too is the rate
of caffeine disappearance from
the bloodstream. And we may ad
judge that caffeine is absorbed
into its ultimate target, the brain,
at the same rate for everyone.
Here, by forestalling fatigue, it
may improve the mental perform
ance of a tired person. It cannot,
however, improve his basic per
formance. Peak level of brain
stimulation comes within one-half
hour after drinking coffee; with
in three and a half hours, the body
has metabolized one half of the
caffeine away, eventually all the
caffeine undergoes complete me
tabolism. Caffeine is a tri-methy
lated purine molecule; it is just
possible that the intermediary
compounds formed as these caf
feine molecules decompose may be
the significant .stimulating agents,
rather than the caffeine per so.
Dr. Golstein, with his collabo
rators Dr. Richard Warren, Eliza
beth Slabach, and Sophia Kaizer,
has been investigating caffeine
effects since 1954, conducting
most of his research here at the
Stanford Medical School. He has
striven for well-designed experi
ments with a minimum of vari
ables; as an experimental control,
he developed, first of all, a special
non-caffeinated coffee that could
fool even the most sophisticated
coffee-drinker ("It was a pretty
bitter, lousy cup of coffee! But
at any rate, no one could distin
guish it from the real thing.") He
designed his experiments to con
trast the effects of this "placebo"
with those of real coffee, using
subjects who were unenlightened
as to which was which. A random
group of Escondido Village house
wives and several classes of male
Stanford medical students we re
his subjects. Dr. Goldstein, inci
dentally, is enthusiastic over this
latter group. "Excellent subjects
indeed! Their being here for four
to five years insures continuity—
one can investigate, for example,
(he stability of caffeine responses
over time. Apart from being medi
cal students, they embody a non
selective group. Most important,
one may have confidence in the,
validity of what they report. As
medical students, they have a pro
fessional stake in furthering medi
cal research."
