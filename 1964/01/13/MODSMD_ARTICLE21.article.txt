# Frosh Five Gains Weekend 'Split'
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's freshmen basketball
team missed capturing two victor
ies last weekend by literally one
foot. As it was the frosh split, a
pair of games. They defeated Mon
terey J.C. Friday night, 81-68, and
Saturday night they lost to San!
Jose Stale's frosh, 39-36.
Against Monterey Stanford put
up a good defense which forced
the Lobos to take too much time
in getting a good shot, and al
though Monterey had a good
shooting percentage, 52% in the
first half, they didn't shoot
enough.
STANFORD REACTED well to
Monterey's shifting defenses —
from a zone to a zone press to a
man on man—and controlled the
defensive backboards to win go
ing away. Big men on the boards
for Stanford were Bill Kelson and
5'9" Tom Nisbet.
Lowell Whitten, Monterey's 30
point per game scorer was held
to 17 points while the Stanford
guards Tom Nisbet and Mike
Natkins were putting in 21 points
and 18 points respectively.
Saturday night the tables were
turned and Stanford only man
aged to attempt 22 shots in the
first half and fell behind, 25-20,
at the half. The "five little In
dians" came back in the second
half and with five minutes left
to play they took a 32-31 lead.
Stanford accomplished this while
shooting a miserable 17% from
the floor, but San Jose was shoot
ing an almost as miserable 17', .
AS THE percentages indicate
this contest was not basketball
at its best. The second half was
dotted with bad passes, traveling
violations, walking violations,
shuffling violations, and all the
other different names the referee
could think up to call bad ball
handling.
Of course, in all fairness, it
must be said that San Jose put
on a full court press with five
minutes left to play.
Despite the numerous errors
and (he fact that Tom "20.3 points
per game" Nisbet had an off night
and tallied only 7 points, the frosh
team nevertheless held a 36-35
lead with a little over a minute
to go when the fatal foot arrived.
STANFORD TOOK the ball
out of bounds in their own fore
court, and then as a player leaped
up and caught the ball his right
foot came down one foot into the
backcourt.
San Jose took over the ball and
jumping jack, Tom Smith w ho
had given Stanfoi'd fits on the
boards, produced two points with
a lay-up. San Jose scored again
with 49 seconds to go.
San Jose took a rebound and the
situation looked bad until, with
19 seconds to go, Stanford stole
the ball. Stanford called time out.
Then with 7 seconds left guard
Tom Nesbit tried a layup with
two players guarding him.
JOE LEINONEN took the re
bound and missed a 12' fall-away
jump-shot. San Jose got. the re
bound as the game ended.
A factor in the ball game be
sides the sloppy ball handling was
the fouling out of Stanford's Bill
Kelson. The husky forward did a
good job on the boards, but he
fouled out with more than four
minutes left to play.

AS THE percentages indicate
this contest was not basketball
at its best. The second half was
dotted with bad passes, traveling
violations, walking violations,
shuffling violations, and all the
other different names the referee
could think up to call bad ball
handling.
Of course, in all fairness, it
must be said that San Jose put
on a full court press with five
minutes left to play.
Despite the numerous errors
and (he fact that Tom "20.3 points
per game" Nisbet had an off night
and tallied only 7 points, the frosh
team nevertheless held a 36-35
lead with a little over a minute
to go when the fatal foot arrived.
STANFORD TOOK the ball
out of bounds in their own fore
court, and then as a player leaped
up and caught the ball his right
foot came down one foot into the
backcourt.
San Jose took over the ball and
jumping jack, Tom Smith w ho
had given Stanfoi'd fits on the
boards, produced two points with
a lay-up. San Jose scored again
with 49 seconds to go.
San Jose took a rebound and the
situation looked bad until, with
19 seconds to go, Stanford stole
the ball. Stanford called time out.
Then with 7 seconds left guard
Tom Nesbit tried a layup with
two players guarding him.
JOE LEINONEN took the re
bound and missed a 12' fall-away
jump-shot. San Jose got. the re
bound as the game ended.
A factor in the ball game be
sides the sloppy ball handling was
the fouling out of Stanford's Bill
Kelson. The husky forward did a
good job on the boards, but he
fouled out with more than four
minutes left to play.
Stanford's freshmen basketball
team missed capturing two victor
ies last weekend by literally one
foot. As it was the frosh split, a
pair of games. They defeated Mon
terey J.C. Friday night, 81-68, and
Saturday night they lost to San!
Jose Stale's frosh, 39-36.
Against Monterey Stanford put
up a good defense which forced
the Lobos to take too much time
in getting a good shot, and al
though Monterey had a good
shooting percentage, 52% in the
first half, they didn't shoot
enough.
STANFORD REACTED well to
Monterey's shifting defenses —
from a zone to a zone press to a
man on man—and controlled the
defensive backboards to win go
ing away. Big men on the boards
for Stanford were Bill Kelson and
5'9" Tom Nisbet.
Lowell Whitten, Monterey's 30
point per game scorer was held
to 17 points while the Stanford
guards Tom Nisbet and Mike
Natkins were putting in 21 points
and 18 points respectively.
Saturday night the tables were
turned and Stanford only man
aged to attempt 22 shots in the
first half and fell behind, 25-20,
at the half. The "five little In
dians" came back in the second
half and with five minutes left
to play they took a 32-31 lead.
Stanford accomplished this while
shooting a miserable 17% from
the floor, but San Jose was shoot
ing an almost as miserable 17', .
