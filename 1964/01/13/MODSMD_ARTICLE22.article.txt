# Card Quint Wallops Huskies
## 
### JUSTICE BECK Sports Editor 
A troop of traveling Huskies
came to town Friday for a pair
of wepkpnd ball games. Bui not
oven ihp always dplightful per*
formancp of lovable Charlio Hart
could savp Washington's basket
hall host from being pretty bad.
The Huskies lost both games 7.1-
52 and 64-47 in what might bp hpst
Iprmpd as a Stanford tune up for
noxt wppk's UCLA games.
THE FIRST game was no con
test; Hinckley opened the scoring
with a three point play and half
a minute later Bedell scored. A
pair of baskets by 6-0 Clint Peo
ples made it close again. 5-4, but
that was Washington's best ol the
evening as Stanford openpd up
an pver bigger margin, reaching
18-7 midway through the first

half.
The second half was much like
the first except the reserves
played more, and Stanford's Hol
lis Moore surprised everybody,
probably himself included, by go
ing on his biggest scoring binge
of the year.
The second game was much the
same, although a little closer.
Washington jumped to a lead
with a basket and a pair of free
throws by Peeples. Forward
Bruce Briekner added a pair of
baskets and with six minutes
gone in the game the Huskies
held a S-T lead.
Then Kent Hinckley, Tom Dose, i

! Bob Bod oil twice, and Hinckley
I again all scored, Doso adding a
i frpp throw for good measure, and
: (hp Tribp was on top by nine,
j After that the pom-pom girls
were the center of attraction.
ACTUALLY Washington con
; tinned to make a game of it, with
Peoples containing Doso every -
! where but at the free throw line,
and forward Stovo Wilson bag
i ging his day's total of seven
points in the next ten minutes.
But Moore and Bedell scored
! often enough in that period to
keep Stanford safe at the half,
3621.
The second half was marked
only by the continued hot shoot
ing of Bedell, who hit nine of 11
shots in the evening, and the ap
pearance of Stanford's second
team a little earlier than the night
before.

After the second team came in,
with about five minutes to go
and the Tribe enjoying a 20 point
margin, 6141, scoring for iho
night practically ceased.
Washington scored at only a
slightly faster rate in the last five
minutes, throe points by Pooplos,
and Ihrce points by his comrades
closed the gap to a final 64-47,
closer, but not by much, than in
Washington's first try.
