# Africa Program Has Three Phases

The typical Operation Cross
roads Africa program has th roe
phases: an on-the-spot orientation
after arrival, with the opportun
ity to meet and talk with govern
ment officials, statesmen, part y
leaders and diplomats from other
nations; a work-camp project;
and more extensive travel within
the one country or if possible to
other nearby countries as well.
THE ORDER in which these
three stages occur varies from
project to project. During the
work-camp phase, each gr o up
attempts a construction project,
arranged by the country's govern
ment or by a church agency. Such
a project can be the building of a
school compound or individual
family home, a community center
building or a dispensary, a school
dormitory or a police barracks.
The philosophy behind bringing
Crossroaders to work on any con
struction is that of "self-help,"
and a whole-hearted attempt is
made successfully to encourage
many of the people in the area to
pitch in and work.
Besides the people in the sur
rounding area, most Crossroads
groups have as an important part
a group of African high school or
university students who work, live
and travel with them most of the
sum mer.
LAST SI M>| i;k Stanford Cross
roaders built school classrooms

and dormitories in Northern Rho
desia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and
Sierra Leone; thatched roofs of
huts in Kenya; and built a bar
racks for the women's police aux
iliary in Somalia.
Each of these projects provided
an opportunity for Crossroaders
to get to know Africans on a
grass-roots level, to study customs
and everyday life first-hand, and
to see how community develop
ment programs arc affecting so
cial change.
A frequent impression received
by American Crossroaders is one
of the tremendous diversity with
in Africa, and the fact that other
groups in different areas had very
different experiences and obser
vations. At the end of the sum
mer, all the groups meet in a

major city of East or West Africa
and hold a final evaluation session
for several days.
CROSSROADS is not an ordi
nary exchange program, nor does
it feature living with a foreign
family or traveling through many
countries on a tour. Its unique
ness lies in its work-camp project,
in its group of Americans w i th
varied backgrounds, and in the
relations established with the Afri
can counterparts who work along
side.
In a developing continent such
as Africa, with the complications
of animosity toward non-Africans
and colonialism of all kinds,
Operation Crossroads' uniqueness
also make it unusually effective
in strengthening African-Ameri
can communication.
