# Appealing Topics and Profs Result in Crowded Classes
## 
### NORM GREENBERG 
A number of courses offered this quarter have been a bit crowded,
as the plums of the liberal arts curriculum have been inundated with
students.
Robert MacAfee Brown, who has just returned from the Ecu
menical Council in Rome is aghast. Charles Drekmeier could scarcely

weave his way through the
crowds of students which spilled
out into the corridor from the
classroom in which he was initi
ally scheduled. Over three hun
dred students flocked to David
Potter's "History of the South
Since Reconstruction." Gordon
Craig and Gordon Wright arc lec
turing to capacity audiences.
THE EXPLANATION for the
concentrations of students prob

ably lies in a convergence of a
popular professor and an appeal
ing topic; interest arises and an
impetus develops such that a giv
en course becomes the fashion.
The Scratch Sheet of last spring
plays no small part in all this.
Dr. Harvey Hall, University
Registrar, says that the phe
nomenon is perennial. Occasion
ally in the past, he says, profes
sors have built up a following on
the campus; for example, stu
dents crowded the classroom of
H. Stuart Hughes before he left
St anlord.
THE CROWDED classes evi
dence widespread student interest
in such areas of concern us th e
South, religion, and modern Ger
many and also indicates the stu
dents' discrimination in the qual
ity of education.
But this enthusiasm introduces
I difficulties. The opportunity for
student-teacher interaction is cur-
I tailed, and term papers and finals
cannot be adequately handled. Dr.
Hall says that the professor has
j the option to limit the enrollment
I of his classes.
Robert MacAfee Brown, w ho
definitely intends to exercise that
option next year, opened his lee-
I tilling on "Theology and Contem
porary Literature" with a nota-
I lion he found on his lectern which
' he called "an example of clear and
precise writing which should be
lan inspiration to many of you in
this course." The note read, "I'm
I going to drop this class; there are
j jirt too many people."
