# Union to Sponsor Art Show And Existentialism Lectures
## 
### 
Dr. Kurt F. Reinhardt, Professor of German (emeritus), will de
liver the first lecture in Tresidder Union's "Existentialism Series"
this evening at 8 p.m. in the Tresidder main lounge. Dr. Reinhardt's
topic will be "The Main Themes of the Philosophy of Existence."
Tresidder Union is also sponsoring an exhibit of paintings bv

William Monte Anderson, which
opened to the public yesterday
and will run through January 31.
WILLIAM ANDERSON is not
regarded as a representational
painter, yet his work is neither
abstract nor non-objective. His
paintings are termed "strong and
honest, exciting in their color and
movement and intent, and new in
form."
Monte held his first -one-man
show eight months ago. at The
Larky Galleries in Carmel, Cali
fornia, where he sells his work
exclusively. His exhibition of 27
oils was a complete sell-out.
To escape from the pressures
which inevitably accompany suc
cess, Monte will take his family,
which now resides in Salt Lake
City, to Spain, where he will
establish residence for two years.
In Spain he hopes to "reflect,
deepen, and work."
Dr. Reinhardt explains the
"philosophy of existence" as "an

attempt to restore philosophy to
its place at the center of educa
tion by concentrating upon mat
ters of vital concern to every per
son." As distinguished from much
of philosophy, the philosophy of
I existence deals with the concrete
i problems of man in his individ
i ual place in history.
Dr. Reinhardt will discuss such
i issues as estrangement, existence
and God, existence and death, and
I existential thinking, while devel
oping his topic tonight.
