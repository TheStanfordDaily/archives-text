## 
### JIM HORNE (Third in a series) 
Hugh Moran, a member of the
class of 1905, recalled in a 1947
issue of the Alumni Review that
"during the life of the founders,
voluntary religious meetings were
held in the various buildings
about the campus."
In addition to the regular Sun
day morning chapel, he attended
a Sunday evening service to which
the undergraduates invited speak
ers from the faculty and from the
Bay Area.
"WE HAD midweek student
religious meetings in one of the
smaller classrooms at south end
of the Quad," said Moran. "For
larger meetings ... the Assembly
Hall was available." In addition,
a Sunday School for campus
cooks was held on Sunday after
noons in the Classics Department.
"We were used to much liberty
of asembly on the Stanford cam

ing founder," explained Moran.
Tiie early years of financial in
security prevented immediate con
struction of the church and it was
dedicated 12 years after the Uni
versity opened.
"To Mrs. Stanford," said Dr.
Branner in his Founders' Day ad
dress in 1917, "the church stood
for high-mindedness, uprightness,
unselfishness, gentleness, and for
what arc known as the Christian
virtues and il was as the teacher
of these virtues that she wanted
to pass it and its influence on to
the members of the community
living and yet to live."
DURING TIIK construction of
the building itself. Mrs. Stanford
searched carefully for a man
qualified to fill the pulpit. She
admonished the Trustees to "help
me find a man who will be strong
enough and broad enough to fill
the demands of any creed, all
creeds or no creed ... a simple
follower of Christ."
"To 11 >n idor t hi important ub

ject in connection with the Uni
versity," Mrs. Stanford told the
Trustees, "you must regard it im
personally, and take into consid
eration the diversity of affinities
for the various creeds or churches
found among the students and
also take into consideration the
young minds without any religi
ous preference."
DR. IIKBHK NEWTON, dis
tinguished writer and clergyman
in the All Souls Church in New
York City, served as Memorial
Church's first pastor, while David

Al ( to preacher, was named to
serve as chaplain and Newton's
assistant.
When Newton resigned six
months later, the Trustees were
perplexed and failed to act until

pastor and turned its duties and
responsibilities over to Chaplain
