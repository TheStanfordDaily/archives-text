# Chief Justice Earl Warren Will Speak At Commencement Exercises in June

### STEVE LEOPOLD 
| Earl Warren, Chief Justice of
the United States Supreme Court,
i will speak at Stanford's 73rd
Commencement exercises, June
14, President Wallace Sterling an
nounced last week.
Warren, who has served as
Chief Justice sine 1953, has be
come a controversial figure due
the divergent, and sometimes
violent, reactions of many Amer
j icans to the decisions of the
"Warren Court" in the last de
] cade. These decisions, ranging
' from the epic desegregation order
j of 1954 to the outlawing of pray
ers in public schools last year,
i have pleased many, while moving
I others lo protest vigorously.
Among the more reputable de
| tractors (not including erstwhile
I candy m a n u fact u re r Robert
I Welch and his drive lo impeach
Warren i is David Lawrence of
; U.S. News and World He port Who
complains that "In case after
case, the court has deprived the
j states of their basic and original

rights. To paraphrase the late
Justice Cardozo—this is 'usurpa
tion run riot.'"
THE APPOINTMENT as Chief
Justice marked the end of War
ren's official political career.
Born in 1891 in Los Angeles, he
had received his law degree in
1914 at the University of Califor
nia, and had quickly become a
successful prosecuting attorney
in Bay area. Later he became At
torney General, and, in 1943 was
elected Governor of the state.
Undoubtedly the highlight of
Warren's political career came in
1951, when, after two terms as
Governor, he was elected to an
unprecedented third term. Not
only was the election itself im
pressive, but the manner by
which he achieved this feat was
even more astounding. Under
California's cross-filing system,
lie was able to win the nomina
tion of both major parties in the
primaries.
Quickly, Warren, who had been
the GOP's nominee for Vice Pres-

ident in 1948, was catapulted into
the national spotlight as a serious
contender for the 1952 Republican
Presidential nomination. It was
his support, along with that of
Governor Dewey of New York,
that proved decisive in Eisen
however's win over Taft at that
convention.
INDEED, it was this invaluable
aid, or so many of his critics
assert, that moved Eisenhower to
appoint Warren, who had no pre
vious judicial experience to the
Supreme Court.
The immediate effect of War
ren's takeover, as Bern a r d
Schwartz noted in a 1957 article
in the New York Times Mag
azine, "was a lessening of enmi
ties among the members of the
Court. Before Warren, Ihe domin
ant theme in the high bench was
discord. . . . Sharp divisions still
exist, but these differences are no
longer, as they all too often were
before Warren, reflections of per
sonal antagonisms. Intellectual
issues have once again come to
be dealt with as such."
It is primarily for this reason
that Schwartz wrote, "The pres
ent court will bear unmistakably
the hallmark of Earl Warren."
But, of course, an even more en
during remembrance will be the
1954 decision outlawing segre
gation in public schools. The de
cision was unanimous—there was
not a single concurring voice to
detract or supplement Warren's
written opinion.
ITiOM THIS BASE, the "War
ren Court" has ventured even fur
ther into controversial fields. As
liberal pundit James Reston re
marked last year, "The actual
holdings in recent decisions are
not nearly so extreme as the re
action they have aroused. What is
true, nevertheless, is that the
court's language in these cases
has been much broader and less
restrained than the bare decisions
themselves."
An example of this type of "un
restrained" language comes from
Warren himself. Making no secret
of the fact that he, and a majority
of his fellow justices, had a
strong predisposition in favor of
the individual, he once said,
"When the generation of 1980 re
ceives from us Ihe Bill of Rights,
the document will not have ex
actly the same meaning it: had
when we received it from our
fathers.

had received his law degree in
1914 at the University of Califor
nia, and had quickly become a
successful prosecuting attorney
in Bay area. Later he became At
torney General, and, in 1943 was
elected Governor of the state.
Undoubtedly the highlight of
Warren's political career came in
1951, when, after two terms as
Governor, he was elected to an
unprecedented third term. Not
only was the election itself im
pressive, but the manner by
which he achieved this feat was
even more astounding. Under
California's cross-filing system,
lie was able to win the nomina
tion of both major parties in the
primaries.
Quickly, Warren, who had been
the GOP's nominee for Vice Pres-

ident in 1948, was catapulted into
the national spotlight as a serious
contender for the 1952 Republican
Presidential nomination. It was
his support, along with that of
Governor Dewey of New York,
that proved decisive in Eisen
however's win over Taft at that
convention.
INDEED, it was this invaluable
aid, or so many of his critics
assert, that moved Eisenhower to
appoint Warren, who had no pre
vious judicial experience to the
Supreme Court.
The immediate effect of War
ren's takeover, as Bern a r d
Schwartz noted in a 1957 article
in the New York Times Mag
azine, "was a lessening of enmi
ties among the members of the
Court. Before Warren, Ihe domin
ant theme in the high bench was
discord. . . . Sharp divisions still
exist, but these differences are no
longer, as they all too often were
before Warren, reflections of per
sonal antagonisms. Intellectual
issues have once again come to
be dealt with as such."
It is primarily for this reason
that Schwartz wrote, "The pres
ent court will bear unmistakably
the hallmark of Earl Warren."
But, of course, an even more en
during remembrance will be the
1954 decision outlawing segre
gation in public schools. The de
cision was unanimous—there was
not a single concurring voice to
detract or supplement Warren's
written opinion.
ITiOM THIS BASE, the "War
ren Court" has ventured even fur
ther into controversial fields. As
liberal pundit James Reston re
marked last year, "The actual
holdings in recent decisions are
not nearly so extreme as the re
action they have aroused. What is
true, nevertheless, is that the
court's language in these cases
has been much broader and less
restrained than the bare decisions
themselves."
An example of this type of "un
restrained" language comes from
Warren himself. Making no secret
of the fact that he, and a majority
of his fellow justices, had a
strong predisposition in favor of
the individual, he once said,
"When the generation of 1980 re
ceives from us Ihe Bill of Rights,
the document will not have ex

in the New York Times Mag
azine, "was a lessening of enmi
ties among the members of the
Court. Before Warren, Ihe domin
ant theme in the high bench was
discord. . . . Sharp divisions still
exist, but these differences are no
longer, as they all too often were
before Warren, reflections of per
sonal antagonisms. Intellectual
issues have once again come to
be dealt with as such."
It is primarily for this reason
that Schwartz wrote, "The pres
ent court will bear unmistakably
the hallmark of Earl Warren."
But, of course, an even more en
during remembrance will be the
1954 decision outlawing segre
gation in public schools. The de
cision was unanimous—there was
not a single concurring voice to
detract or supplement Warren's
written opinion.
ITiOM THIS BASE, the "War
ren Court" has ventured even fur
ther into controversial fields. As
liberal pundit James Reston re
marked last year, "The actual
holdings in recent decisions are
not nearly so extreme as the re
action they have aroused. What is
true, nevertheless, is that the
court's language in these cases
has been much broader and less
restrained than the bare decisions
themselves."
An example of this type of "un
restrained" language comes from
Warren himself. Making no secret
of the fact that he, and a majority
of his fellow justices, had a
strong predisposition in favor of
the individual, he once said,
"When the generation of 1980 re
ceives from us Ihe Bill of Rights,
the document will not have ex
actly the same meaning it: had
when we received it from our
fathers.
