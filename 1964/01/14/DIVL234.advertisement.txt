DO YOU HAVE AN ANCHOR
IN LIFE?
We .ill have goals. ambitions, hopes desires, and plans for nut lives. Hut the future
is uncertain, and there is always the knowledge that death awaits us in the end,
and the end could come at any time.Everyoiu needs .511 anchor, a refuge, a retreat
and a solid foundation on which to build his life.
If you are tired of being tossed about like a leaf on lhe sea of life or clinging to
the lashed up rafts of 1 lit- philosophies of men, why nr# consider what Jesus Christ
has to offer? In Christ Cod became man in order that fie might redeem man from
a lost world.
"To wit, that Cod was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing
their trepasses unto them." J Cor. 5:19.
Christ rose from the dead, ascended on high, and lives today. This Christ is an
active aprticipant in the affairs of men. IK shares their burdens and suffering, and
deals with them in love and understanding. His Spirit is omnipresent, and llis power
is not limited by time and understanding.
It is impossible to be a complete human being unless your spirit is in fellowship
with Cod through Christ. A life built on any other foundation will ultimately fail!
"So every one who hears these words of Mine and acts upon them olx'ying them —
will be like a sensible man who built his bouse on the rock; And tin: rain fell and
the floods came, and the winds blew ;md beat against that bouse, but it did not fall,
because it had been founded on tile rock. And every oiw who hears these words of
Mine ,iud does not do them will be like a stupid man who built his house upon the
sand; And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against
that house, and it fell; and great and complete was the fall of it." Mat. 7:2-1-27 Ampl.
Jesus Christ is real, and you too can experience His love and power. May we help
you to find Him ?

and a solid foundation on which to build his life.
If you are tired of being tossed about like a leaf on lhe sea of life or clinging to
the lashed up rafts of 1 lit- philosophies of men, why nr# consider what Jesus Christ
has to offer? In Christ Cod became man in order that fie might redeem man from
a lost world.
"To wit, that Cod was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing
their trepasses unto them." J Cor. 5:19.
Christ rose from the dead, ascended on high, and lives today. This Christ is an
active aprticipant in the affairs of men. IK shares their burdens and suffering, and
deals with them in love and understanding. His Spirit is omnipresent, and llis power
is not limited by time and understanding.
It is impossible to be a complete human being unless your spirit is in fellowship
with Cod through Christ. A life built on any other foundation will ultimately fail!
"So every one who hears these words of Mine and acts upon them olx'ying them —
will be like a sensible man who built his bouse on the rock; And tin: rain fell and
the floods came, and the winds blew ;md beat against that bouse, but it did not fall,
because it had been founded on tile rock. And every oiw who hears these words of
Mine ,iud does not do them will be like a stupid man who built his house upon the
sand; And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against
that house, and it fell; and great and complete was the fall of it." Mat. 7:2-1-27 Ampl.
Jesus Christ is real, and you too can experience His love and power. May we help
you to find Him ?
