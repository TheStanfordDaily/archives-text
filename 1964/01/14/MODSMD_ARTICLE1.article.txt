# General Policy Toward Religion Has Changed Little
## 
### MIKE ROSTER (Fourth in a series of 13 articles) 
Once the general policy toward religion evolved during
the early years of Stanford's existence, few changes were
made.
In areas of worship, Memorial Church has remained
the only official University institution which may conduct
worship services in the University. Most of Memorial
Church's activities are organized and administered by the
Chaplain, the Rev. Robert M. Minto, who is an ordained
minister of the Church of Scotland and has been hired by
the University to serve as a non-denominational minister.
An assistant chaplain and the student-run Memorial
Church Committee assist in the church's functions.
IN CURRICULAR fields of religious study, the Univer
sity lacked any formal classes until within the last 15
years. Mrs, Stanford had once proposed a course in Bibli
cal history, but her intentions were never realized. In

1951, however, Dr. Alexander Miller was appointed lec
turer in (and later, professor of) religion. Miller immedi
ately initiated the Curriculum in Religious Studies, an
"undergraduate curriculum in theology." In response to
student interest in the religious studies program, Miller
helped raise funds to add two additional faculty members
and to expand the course offerings.
Following Miller's death in 1960, the University ap
pointed Robert McAfee Brown, one of the most distin
guished theologians in America today, as professor of reli
gion. While Dr. Brown specializes generally in contempo
rary Christian theology and ethics, Associate Professor Ed
win M. Good teaches biblical studies and classical Hebrew
and Assistant Professor 11. Jackson Forstman teaches his
tory of Christian thought. According to Good, there is
presently a need for faculty members in Roman Catholic,
Jewish, and world religions studies, plus extensive library
requirements for the entire Curriculum in Religious Stud
ies program.
IN ADDITION to Memorial Church and the Curriculum
in Religious Studies, other religious activities have been

organized on campus. The Stanford Handbook, published
by ASSU, lists 15 active religious groups. Such groups all
have advisers who may spend much time on campus. How
ever, no groups may conduct organized worship or classes,
a policy established by the Board of Trustees based on the
various founding documents of the University.
Although these various religious activities are all avail
able, many students have been criticizing the University
in recent years in its attitude toward religious activities.
In 1963, the Committee on Students Affairs and Services
took up discussion of this problem based on four major
points in the discussion outline, "Sectarian Religion at
Stanford." The four main questions this committee has
raised are:
1. Is there any current problem with regard to sectarian
religious activities on campus?
2. What is the meaning of the provisions of the found
ing grant with regard to religion?
3. Would it be desirable to hold sectarian religious ac
tivities on campus?
4. Would it be practical to permit sectarian activities

on campus?
Many of the problems are based on interpretation of the
founding grant. Is there a difference between on-denomi
national and non-sectarian? And what about students of
non-Protestant background? It is basically a matter of
what the university may legally do and then what it should
do to make the religious program as beneficial as possible
to the university and its students.
In Alexander Miller's book, "Faith and Learning." the
full effect of the various complicated issues involved in
maintaining a "non-denominational" university are dis
cussed.
The problem "is simply there," said Millc-r "One may
console oneself with the thought that 'this is America,' and
America has its own tumultuous way of disrupting every
tidy history pattern: and I myself sometimes take comfort
from Richard Baxter's great saying, 'It is better to be dis
orderly saved than orderly damned.' To deal with the
situation constructively, without losing anything vital, will
take all the patience and long-suffering concern that church
and universiy statesmen can bring to it."
