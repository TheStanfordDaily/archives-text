# 'Role of Law' in South Africa Analyzed

### MARK ACUFF International Affairs Vice-President United States Student Press Association 
(EXCLUSIVE TO CPS)—Approximately one out of every 32
adult South Africans is in jail today. It is possible, under existing
law in the Republic of South Africa, to arrest a citizen with no charge
whatsoever and hold that person incommunicado for 90 days, at the
end of which he may be ordered held for another 90 day period, ad
infinitum. The only person such a prisoner may see during the 90
day period is the federal minister of justice, who most likely signed
the order to put him away.
In the Republic of South Africa it is a crime punishable by death
1o paint a poster or make a speech advocating any change whatsoever
in the social or economic system of the country. The law does not
spell out what sort of change is to be prohibited from public utter
ance—this is left to the government to define.
The South African government may declare a state of national
emergency at any time, throwing the country into martial law and
giving the government power to rule by decree. Certain areas of the
country, such as the Transkei, have in fact been ruled in such a man
ner for extended periods of time.
ANY PERSON IN South Africa not of the white race must carry
on his person at all times a complicated set of identification papers
and a pass to be in the area where he works and perhaps lives. This
pass must bear the signatures and up-to-date authorizations of his
tribal authorities, his employer", the local and national police agencies,
and numerous other officials. Any African may be arrested and
jailed for up to 48 hours for simple failure to produce the pass on
request — and who is to say whether or not he had a pass on him
except the police who arrested him?
In the Republic of South Africa, the Communist Party has been
banned since 1950. The African Nalional Congress, the Pan-African
Congress, and all other vehicles of native expression have been
banned in the last decade. The opposition Liberal party, though not
banned, is constantly harrassed, and the editor of its fortnightly
paper has been arrested. The only sizeable multi-racial organization
in the country, the National Union of South African Students
(NUSAS) was recently raided by the government police and it ap
pears that the government plans to ban NUSAS as well.
Some 4,000 books have been banned by the Republic government
as unfit for the eyes of South Africans, white or black. Among the
authors on the banned list, are: Peter Abrahams, Richard Wright,
James Baldwin, Nicholas VTonserrat, D. H. Lawrence, Emile Zola,
Francoise Sagan, Ernest jiemingway, Tennessee Williams, Robert
Graves, and John Steinbeck.
Most Americans, though not familiar with the details of the South
African situation, are at least acquainted with the word "apartheid"
and the philosophy it represents—complete separation of the races
and dominance by the white minority in South Africa. In the words
of the leaders of the Arikaner Nationalist Party, the government
party, apartheid is the means to "save white civilization in South
Africa." The Nationalists are frighteningly correct — for they have
painted themselves into a corner with the paint of repressive social
legislation, and it appears that there is no way out of the corner for
South Africa short of violence.
THE VVORI) "APARTHEID" was first coined for use in the 1948
South African elections, when Dr. Daniel Malan, Nationalist leader
of the time correctly surmised that the more extreme the call to
racism, the more likely a victory at the polls in South Africa. The
Afriganer Nationalists won that election, and have steadily increased
their majority in parliament since that time. The Nationalists have
been in control of the country for more than a decade now, and have
ensured their control by cutting those few "coloureds" on the voting
rolls and adding in their place the votes of the white citizens of
Southwest Africa, a League of Nations mandate to South Africa.
Faced with increasing African unrest during the last decade as
a result of government apai'theid policies, the Nationalists have
passed a series of laws, which in the words of the International Com
mission of Jurists, "... surpass the bounds of civilized jurispru
dence."
The first important legislative moves of the Afrikaner Nationalists
were the Mixed Marriage and Immorality Act, the intent of which
should be obvious from the title, and the Population Registration
Act, classifying the population by racial origin. Both acts were passed
in 1950.
In 1958 the Strijdom administration eliminated the Cape Coloureds
from the voting rolls, and secured passage of the Bantu Education
Act, which totally segregated all schools in the nation and placed
the control of education of native Africans completely in the hands
of the government. Strijdom also originated the Criminal Law
Amendment Act, which virtually outlawed non-violent and peaceful
demonstrations against the government.
11. F. VERWOERD succeeded Strijdom, and continues in office to

this day. He immediately launched the government on a course of
repressive legislation without equal in the world, including dictator
ships of the left, and the right.
Most important of these items of legislation are the Sabotage
Act and the General Laws Amendment Act, which together have
turned South Africa into a small scale repilca of Nazi Germany.
The Sabotage Act makes it a crime punishable by not less than
5 years with a maximum penalty of death to disrupt any public
facility or service, commit burglary or trespass, or strike for higher
wages, and a great many other things, if the accused cannot prove
his act was not intended to, among other things: a) cause or promote
general dislocation, disturbance or disorder, b) further or encourage
any political aim designed to bring about change in the economic or
social structure of the Republic, and c) embarass the administration
of the affairs of state. The other "incidental" matters referred to
in the Act make it in effect illegal to protest the policies of the gov
ernment in any public manner.
Under the Suppression of Communism Act, all newspapers in the
country are required to deposit about $30,000 with the government,
which is automatically forfeited if the government decides that the
newspaper is furthering the "aims of Communism."
Other acts passed by the Nationalists are suggestive enough by
their titles: the Public Safety Act, the Criminal Procedure Act, the
Riotous Assemblies Act, and the Unlawful Organizations Act, among
others.
THE AFRIKANER RESPONSE to charges that South Africa has
become a fascist police state is that the government is in the process
of assuring self-government and economic progress for the African
through the creation of autonomous "Bantustans" throughout the
country, to be infused with massive amounts of government aid. In
fact, these Bantustans are and obviously will remain under the direct
control of the national police. Together, the Bantustans, which are
located in some of the worst geographical areas of the nation, con
stitute only 13 per ccrit of the land area of South Africa, on which
about 75 per cent of the population is expected to live.
The two leading African organizations in opposition to the govern
ment are the African National Congress, headed by Nobel Prize
winner Albert Luthuli, who is now under house arrest with all citi
zens prohibited from conversing with him or publishing his writings
under pain of imprisonment; and the Pan-African Congress, a more
activist and violent group, headed by Robert Sobuke, who is cur
rently serving a three-year term in jail.
The only organized white opposition is found in the Liberal Party,
headed by Alan Patton and others. The Liberals have never succeeded
in electing a candidate to parliament. The national union of students,
NUSAS, has also played an important role of opposition, and it; ap
pears that the government is planning to ban NUSAS as well. NUSAS
is opposed by a government front union, the Afriganse Studcnte
bonde.
In other words, the situation in South Africa is such that it is
Jotally impossible to follow a road of peaceful and non-violent pro
test against the government policy of apartheid. The only road open
to the African majority is now through violence and civil war. The
violent answer has been steadily gaining among the Africans, wit
ness the ANC's losing ground inexorably to the PAC over the past
tew years.
THE INDEPENDENT nations of Africa have begun to send as
sistance to rebels and violent elements in South Africa, and a civil
'var, a war that will probably surpass Algeria's in bloodshed, can
oe expected to erupt within a year or two. Given the fact that a civil
war is already underway in neighboring Angola, a civil war in
preparation in Mozambique, and rumblings of violence in Southern
Rhodesia, the entire Southern portion of the African continent is
likely to erupt into violence of the worst sort shortly. The League
of Nations mandate of Southwest Africa is currently under review
by the International Court of Justice at The Hague, and it seems
obvious that the mandate will be returned to the United Nations,
where the Afro-Asian bloc will most certainly push for action to
take the territory from South Africa, by military force if necessary.
The South African government is preparing for war. All males
in the country from elementary school age up are currently receiving
military training, and the government is even considering the draft
ing of women into the army. Production of arms has tripled in the
past three years.
The United States with some billion dollars invested in South
Africa, has to date refused to vote for strong action against South
Africa in the United Nations. It would appear reasonable to assume
that the U.S., along with Britain will be forced to "put up or shut
up" on the South African question within the next year, and it is
necessary that all American students study the problem and com
municate their views to their Congressmen •— for it may soon be
too late in South Africa for Ihe U.S. to do anything about the situa
tion there.

should be obvious from the title, and the Population Registration
Act, classifying the population by racial origin. Both acts were passed
in 1950.
In 1958 the Strijdom administration eliminated the Cape Coloureds
from the voting rolls, and secured passage of the Bantu Education
Act, which totally segregated all schools in the nation and placed
the control of education of native Africans completely in the hands
of the government. Strijdom also originated the Criminal Law
Amendment Act, which virtually outlawed non-violent and peaceful
demonstrations against the government.
11. F. VERWOERD succeeded Strijdom, and continues in office to

this day. He immediately launched the government on a course of
repressive legislation without equal in the world, including dictator
ships of the left, and the right.
Most important of these items of legislation are the Sabotage
Act and the General Laws Amendment Act, which together have
turned South Africa into a small scale repilca of Nazi Germany.
The Sabotage Act makes it a crime punishable by not less than
5 years with a maximum penalty of death to disrupt any public
facility or service, commit burglary or trespass, or strike for higher
wages, and a great many other things, if the accused cannot prove
his act was not intended to, among other things: a) cause or promote
general dislocation, disturbance or disorder, b) further or encourage
any political aim designed to bring about change in the economic or
social structure of the Republic, and c) embarass the administration
of the affairs of state. The other "incidental" matters referred to
in the Act make it in effect illegal to protest the policies of the gov
ernment in any public manner.
Under the Suppression of Communism Act, all newspapers in the
country are required to deposit about $30,000 with the government,
which is automatically forfeited if the government decides that the
newspaper is furthering the "aims of Communism."
Other acts passed by the Nationalists are suggestive enough by
their titles: the Public Safety Act, the Criminal Procedure Act, the
Riotous Assemblies Act, and the Unlawful Organizations Act, among
others.
THE AFRIKANER RESPONSE to charges that South Africa has
become a fascist police state is that the government is in the process
of assuring self-government and economic progress for the African
through the creation of autonomous "Bantustans" throughout the
country, to be infused with massive amounts of government aid. In
fact, these Bantustans are and obviously will remain under the direct
control of the national police. Together, the Bantustans, which are
located in some of the worst geographical areas of the nation, con
stitute only 13 per ccrit of the land area of South Africa, on which
about 75 per cent of the population is expected to live.
The two leading African organizations in opposition to the govern
ment are the African National Congress, headed by Nobel Prize
winner Albert Luthuli, who is now under house arrest with all citi
zens prohibited from conversing with him or publishing his writings
under pain of imprisonment; and the Pan-African Congress, a more
activist and violent group, headed by Robert Sobuke, who is cur
rently serving a three-year term in jail.
The only organized white opposition is found in the Liberal Party,
headed by Alan Patton and others. The Liberals have never succeeded
in electing a candidate to parliament. The national union of students,
NUSAS, has also played an important role of opposition, and it; ap
pears that the government is planning to ban NUSAS as well. NUSAS
is opposed by a government front union, the Afriganse Studcnte
bonde.
In other words, the situation in South Africa is such that it is
Jotally impossible to follow a road of peaceful and non-violent pro
test against the government policy of apartheid. The only road open
to the African majority is now through violence and civil war. The
violent answer has been steadily gaining among the Africans, wit
ness the ANC's losing ground inexorably to the PAC over the past
tew years.
THE INDEPENDENT nations of Africa have begun to send as
sistance to rebels and violent elements in South Africa, and a civil
'var, a war that will probably surpass Algeria's in bloodshed, can
oe expected to erupt within a year or two. Given the fact that a civil
war is already underway in neighboring Angola, a civil war in
preparation in Mozambique, and rumblings of violence in Southern
Rhodesia, the entire Southern portion of the African continent is
likely to erupt into violence of the worst sort shortly. The League
of Nations mandate of Southwest Africa is currently under review
by the International Court of Justice at The Hague, and it seems
obvious that the mandate will be returned to the United Nations,
where the Afro-Asian bloc will most certainly push for action to
take the territory from South Africa, by military force if necessary.
The South African government is preparing for war. All males
in the country from elementary school age up are currently receiving
military training, and the government is even considering the draft
ing of women into the army. Production of arms has tripled in the
past three years.
The United States with some billion dollars invested in South
Africa, has to date refused to vote for strong action against South
Africa in the United Nations. It would appear reasonable to assume
that the U.S., along with Britain will be forced to "put up or shut
up" on the South African question within the next year, and it is
necessary that all American students study the problem and com
municate their views to their Congressmen •— for it may soon be
too late in South Africa for Ihe U.S. to do anything about the situa
tion there.
(EXCLUSIVE TO CPS)—Approximately one out of every 32
adult South Africans is in jail today. It is possible, under existing
law in the Republic of South Africa, to arrest a citizen with no charge
whatsoever and hold that person incommunicado for 90 days, at the
end of which he may be ordered held for another 90 day period, ad
infinitum. The only person such a prisoner may see during the 90
day period is the federal minister of justice, who most likely signed
the order to put him away.
In the Republic of South Africa it is a crime punishable by death
1o paint a poster or make a speech advocating any change whatsoever
in the social or economic system of the country. The law does not
spell out what sort of change is to be prohibited from public utter
ance—this is left to the government to define.
The South African government may declare a state of national
emergency at any time, throwing the country into martial law and
giving the government power to rule by decree. Certain areas of the
country, such as the Transkei, have in fact been ruled in such a man
ner for extended periods of time.
ANY PERSON IN South Africa not of the white race must carry
on his person at all times a complicated set of identification papers
and a pass to be in the area where he works and perhaps lives. This
pass must bear the signatures and up-to-date authorizations of his
tribal authorities, his employer", the local and national police agencies,
and numerous other officials. Any African may be arrested and
jailed for up to 48 hours for simple failure to produce the pass on
request — and who is to say whether or not he had a pass on him
except the police who arrested him?
In the Republic of South Africa, the Communist Party has been
banned since 1950. The African Nalional Congress, the Pan-African
Congress, and all other vehicles of native expression have been
banned in the last decade. The opposition Liberal party, though not
banned, is constantly harrassed, and the editor of its fortnightly
paper has been arrested. The only sizeable multi-racial organization
in the country, the National Union of South African Students
(NUSAS) was recently raided by the government police and it ap
pears that the government plans to ban NUSAS as well.
Some 4,000 books have been banned by the Republic government
as unfit for the eyes of South Africans, white or black. Among the
authors on the banned list, are: Peter Abrahams, Richard Wright,
James Baldwin, Nicholas VTonserrat, D. H. Lawrence, Emile Zola,
Francoise Sagan, Ernest jiemingway, Tennessee Williams, Robert
Graves, and John Steinbeck.
Most Americans, though not familiar with the details of the South
African situation, are at least acquainted with the word "apartheid"
and the philosophy it represents—complete separation of the races
and dominance by the white minority in South Africa. In the words
of the leaders of the Arikaner Nationalist Party, the government
party, apartheid is the means to "save white civilization in South
Africa." The Nationalists are frighteningly correct — for they have
painted themselves into a corner with the paint of repressive social
legislation, and it appears that there is no way out of the corner for
South Africa short of violence.
THE VVORI) "APARTHEID" was first coined for use in the 1948
South African elections, when Dr. Daniel Malan, Nationalist leader
of the time correctly surmised that the more extreme the call to
racism, the more likely a victory at the polls in South Africa. The
Afriganer Nationalists won that election, and have steadily increased
their majority in parliament since that time. The Nationalists have
been in control of the country for more than a decade now, and have
ensured their control by cutting those few "coloureds" on the voting
rolls and adding in their place the votes of the white citizens of
Southwest Africa, a League of Nations mandate to South Africa.
Faced with increasing African unrest during the last decade as
a result of government apai'theid policies, the Nationalists have
passed a series of laws, which in the words of the International Com
mission of Jurists, "... surpass the bounds of civilized jurispru
dence."
The first important legislative moves of the Afrikaner Nationalists
were the Mixed Marriage and Immorality Act, the intent of which

preparation in Mozambique, and rumblings of violence in Southern
Rhodesia, the entire Southern portion of the African continent is
likely to erupt into violence of the worst sort shortly. The League
of Nations mandate of Southwest Africa is currently under review
by the International Court of Justice at The Hague, and it seems
obvious that the mandate will be returned to the United Nations,
where the Afro-Asian bloc will most certainly push for action to
take the territory from South Africa, by military force if necessary.
The South African government is preparing for war. All males
in the country from elementary school age up are currently receiving
military training, and the government is even considering the draft
ing of women into the army. Production of arms has tripled in the
past three years.
The United States with some billion dollars invested in South
Africa, has to date refused to vote for strong action against South
Africa in the United Nations. It would appear reasonable to assume
that the U.S., along with Britain will be forced to "put up or shut
up" on the South African question within the next year, and it is
necessary that all American students study the problem and com
municate their views to their Congressmen •— for it may soon be
too late in South Africa for Ihe U.S. to do anything about the situa
tion there.
(EXCLUSIVE TO CPS)—Approximately one out of every 32
adult South Africans is in jail today. It is possible, under existing
law in the Republic of South Africa, to arrest a citizen with no charge
whatsoever and hold that person incommunicado for 90 days, at the
end of which he may be ordered held for another 90 day period, ad
infinitum. The only person such a prisoner may see during the 90
day period is the federal minister of justice, who most likely signed
the order to put him away.
In the Republic of South Africa it is a crime punishable by death
1o paint a poster or make a speech advocating any change whatsoever
in the social or economic system of the country. The law does not
spell out what sort of change is to be prohibited from public utter
ance—this is left to the government to define.
The South African government may declare a state of national
emergency at any time, throwing the country into martial law and
giving the government power to rule by decree. Certain areas of the
country, such as the Transkei, have in fact been ruled in such a man
ner for extended periods of time.
ANY PERSON IN South Africa not of the white race must carry
on his person at all times a complicated set of identification papers
and a pass to be in the area where he works and perhaps lives. This
pass must bear the signatures and up-to-date authorizations of his
tribal authorities, his employer", the local and national police agencies,
and numerous other officials. Any African may be arrested and
jailed for up to 48 hours for simple failure to produce the pass on
request — and who is to say whether or not he had a pass on him
except the police who arrested him?
In the Republic of South Africa, the Communist Party has been
banned since 1950. The African Nalional Congress, the Pan-African
Congress, and all other vehicles of native expression have been
banned in the last decade. The opposition Liberal party, though not
banned, is constantly harrassed, and the editor of its fortnightly
paper has been arrested. The only sizeable multi-racial organization
in the country, the National Union of South African Students
(NUSAS) was recently raided by the government police and it ap
pears that the government plans to ban NUSAS as well.
Some 4,000 books have been banned by the Republic government
as unfit for the eyes of South Africans, white or black. Among the
authors on the banned list, are: Peter Abrahams, Richard Wright,
James Baldwin, Nicholas VTonserrat, D. H. Lawrence, Emile Zola,
Francoise Sagan, Ernest jiemingway, Tennessee Williams, Robert
Graves, and John Steinbeck.
Most Americans, though not familiar with the details of the South
African situation, are at least acquainted with the word "apartheid"
and the philosophy it represents—complete separation of the races
and dominance by the white minority in South Africa. In the words
of the leaders of the Arikaner Nationalist Party, the government
party, apartheid is the means to "save white civilization in South
Africa." The Nationalists are frighteningly correct — for they have
painted themselves into a corner with the paint of repressive social
legislation, and it appears that there is no way out of the corner for
South Africa short of violence.
THE VVORI) "APARTHEID" was first coined for use in the 1948
South African elections, when Dr. Daniel Malan, Nationalist leader
of the time correctly surmised that the more extreme the call to
racism, the more likely a victory at the polls in South Africa. The
Afriganer Nationalists won that election, and have steadily increased
their majority in parliament since that time. The Nationalists have
been in control of the country for more than a decade now, and have
ensured their control by cutting those few "coloureds" on the voting
rolls and adding in their place the votes of the white citizens of
Southwest Africa, a League of Nations mandate to South Africa.
Faced with increasing African unrest during the last decade as
a result of government apai'theid policies, the Nationalists have
passed a series of laws, which in the words of the International Com
mission of Jurists, "... surpass the bounds of civilized jurispru
dence."
The first important legislative moves of the Afrikaner Nationalists
were the Mixed Marriage and Immorality Act, the intent of which
should be obvious from the title, and the Population Registration
Act, classifying the population by racial origin. Both acts were passed
in 1950.
In 1958 the Strijdom administration eliminated the Cape Coloureds
from the voting rolls, and secured passage of the Bantu Education
Act, which totally segregated all schools in the nation and placed
the control of education of native Africans completely in the hands
of the government. Strijdom also originated the Criminal Law
Amendment Act, which virtually outlawed non-violent and peaceful
demonstrations against the government.
11. F. VERWOERD succeeded Strijdom, and continues in office to

this day. He immediately launched the government on a course of
repressive legislation without equal in the world, including dictator
ships of the left, and the right.
Most important of these items of legislation are the Sabotage
Act and the General Laws Amendment Act, which together have
turned South Africa into a small scale repilca of Nazi Germany.
The Sabotage Act makes it a crime punishable by not less than
5 years with a maximum penalty of death to disrupt any public
facility or service, commit burglary or trespass, or strike for higher
wages, and a great many other things, if the accused cannot prove
his act was not intended to, among other things: a) cause or promote
general dislocation, disturbance or disorder, b) further or encourage
any political aim designed to bring about change in the economic or
social structure of the Republic, and c) embarass the administration
of the affairs of state. The other "incidental" matters referred to
in the Act make it in effect illegal to protest the policies of the gov
ernment in any public manner.
Under the Suppression of Communism Act, all newspapers in the
country are required to deposit about $30,000 with the government,
which is automatically forfeited if the government decides that the
newspaper is furthering the "aims of Communism."
Other acts passed by the Nationalists are suggestive enough by
their titles: the Public Safety Act, the Criminal Procedure Act, the
Riotous Assemblies Act, and the Unlawful Organizations Act, among
others.
THE AFRIKANER RESPONSE to charges that South Africa has
become a fascist police state is that the government is in the process
of assuring self-government and economic progress for the African
through the creation of autonomous "Bantustans" throughout the
country, to be infused with massive amounts of government aid. In
fact, these Bantustans are and obviously will remain under the direct
control of the national police. Together, the Bantustans, which are
located in some of the worst geographical areas of the nation, con
stitute only 13 per ccrit of the land area of South Africa, on which
about 75 per cent of the population is expected to live.
The two leading African organizations in opposition to the govern
ment are the African National Congress, headed by Nobel Prize
winner Albert Luthuli, who is now under house arrest with all citi
zens prohibited from conversing with him or publishing his writings
under pain of imprisonment; and the Pan-African Congress, a more
activist and violent group, headed by Robert Sobuke, who is cur
rently serving a three-year term in jail.
The only organized white opposition is found in the Liberal Party,
headed by Alan Patton and others. The Liberals have never succeeded
in electing a candidate to parliament. The national union of students,
NUSAS, has also played an important role of opposition, and it; ap
pears that the government is planning to ban NUSAS as well. NUSAS
is opposed by a government front union, the Afriganse Studcnte
bonde.
In other words, the situation in South Africa is such that it is
Jotally impossible to follow a road of peaceful and non-violent pro
test against the government policy of apartheid. The only road open
to the African majority is now through violence and civil war. The
violent answer has been steadily gaining among the Africans, wit
ness the ANC's losing ground inexorably to the PAC over the past
tew years.
THE INDEPENDENT nations of Africa have begun to send as
sistance to rebels and violent elements in South Africa, and a civil
'var, a war that will probably surpass Algeria's in bloodshed, can
oe expected to erupt within a year or two. Given the fact that a civil
war is already underway in neighboring Angola, a civil war in
preparation in Mozambique, and rumblings of violence in Southern
Rhodesia, the entire Southern portion of the African continent is

Africa." The Nationalists are frighteningly correct — for they have
painted themselves into a corner with the paint of repressive social
legislation, and it appears that there is no way out of the corner for
South Africa short of violence.
THE VVORI) "APARTHEID" was first coined for use in the 1948
South African elections, when Dr. Daniel Malan, Nationalist leader
of the time correctly surmised that the more extreme the call to
racism, the more likely a victory at the polls in South Africa. The
Afriganer Nationalists won that election, and have steadily increased
their majority in parliament since that time. The Nationalists have
been in control of the country for more than a decade now, and have
ensured their control by cutting those few "coloureds" on the voting
rolls and adding in their place the votes of the white citizens of
Southwest Africa, a League of Nations mandate to South Africa.
Faced with increasing African unrest during the last decade as
a result of government apai'theid policies, the Nationalists have
passed a series of laws, which in the words of the International Com
mission of Jurists, "... surpass the bounds of civilized jurispru
dence."
The first important legislative moves of the Afrikaner Nationalists
were the Mixed Marriage and Immorality Act, the intent of which
should be obvious from the title, and the Population Registration
Act, classifying the population by racial origin. Both acts were passed
in 1950.
In 1958 the Strijdom administration eliminated the Cape Coloureds
from the voting rolls, and secured passage of the Bantu Education
Act, which totally segregated all schools in the nation and placed
the control of education of native Africans completely in the hands
of the government. Strijdom also originated the Criminal Law
Amendment Act, which virtually outlawed non-violent and peaceful
demonstrations against the government.
11. F. VERWOERD succeeded Strijdom, and continues in office to

this day. He immediately launched the government on a course of
repressive legislation without equal in the world, including dictator
ships of the left, and the right.
Most important of these items of legislation are the Sabotage
Act and the General Laws Amendment Act, which together have
turned South Africa into a small scale repilca of Nazi Germany.
The Sabotage Act makes it a crime punishable by not less than
5 years with a maximum penalty of death to disrupt any public
facility or service, commit burglary or trespass, or strike for higher
wages, and a great many other things, if the accused cannot prove
his act was not intended to, among other things: a) cause or promote
general dislocation, disturbance or disorder, b) further or encourage
any political aim designed to bring about change in the economic or
social structure of the Republic, and c) embarass the administration
of the affairs of state. The other "incidental" matters referred to
in the Act make it in effect illegal to protest the policies of the gov
ernment in any public manner.
Under the Suppression of Communism Act, all newspapers in the
country are required to deposit about $30,000 with the government,
which is automatically forfeited if the government decides that the
newspaper is furthering the "aims of Communism."
Other acts passed by the Nationalists are suggestive enough by
their titles: the Public Safety Act, the Criminal Procedure Act, the
Riotous Assemblies Act, and the Unlawful Organizations Act, among
others.
THE AFRIKANER RESPONSE to charges that South Africa has
become a fascist police state is that the government is in the process
of assuring self-government and economic progress for the African
through the creation of autonomous "Bantustans" throughout the
country, to be infused with massive amounts of government aid. In
fact, these Bantustans are and obviously will remain under the direct
control of the national police. Together, the Bantustans, which are
located in some of the worst geographical areas of the nation, con
stitute only 13 per ccrit of the land area of South Africa, on which
about 75 per cent of the population is expected to live.
The two leading African organizations in opposition to the govern
ment are the African National Congress, headed by Nobel Prize
winner Albert Luthuli, who is now under house arrest with all citi
zens prohibited from conversing with him or publishing his writings
under pain of imprisonment; and the Pan-African Congress, a more
activist and violent group, headed by Robert Sobuke, who is cur
rently serving a three-year term in jail.
The only organized white opposition is found in the Liberal Party,
headed by Alan Patton and others. The Liberals have never succeeded
in electing a candidate to parliament. The national union of students,
NUSAS, has also played an important role of opposition, and it; ap
pears that the government is planning to ban NUSAS as well. NUSAS
is opposed by a government front union, the Afriganse Studcnte
bonde.
In other words, the situation in South Africa is such that it is
Jotally impossible to follow a road of peaceful and non-violent pro
test against the government policy of apartheid. The only road open
to the African majority is now through violence and civil war. The
violent answer has been steadily gaining among the Africans, wit
ness the ANC's losing ground inexorably to the PAC over the past
tew years.
THE INDEPENDENT nations of Africa have begun to send as
sistance to rebels and violent elements in South Africa, and a civil
'var, a war that will probably surpass Algeria's in bloodshed, can
oe expected to erupt within a year or two. Given the fact that a civil
war is already underway in neighboring Angola, a civil war in
preparation in Mozambique, and rumblings of violence in Southern
Rhodesia, the entire Southern portion of the African continent is
likely to erupt into violence of the worst sort shortly. The League
of Nations mandate of Southwest Africa is currently under review
by the International Court of Justice at The Hague, and it seems
obvious that the mandate will be returned to the United Nations,
where the Afro-Asian bloc will most certainly push for action to
take the territory from South Africa, by military force if necessary.
The South African government is preparing for war. All males
in the country from elementary school age up are currently receiving
military training, and the government is even considering the draft
ing of women into the army. Production of arms has tripled in the
past three years.
The United States with some billion dollars invested in South
Africa, has to date refused to vote for strong action against South
Africa in the United Nations. It would appear reasonable to assume
that the U.S., along with Britain will be forced to "put up or shut
up" on the South African question within the next year, and it is
necessary that all American students study the problem and com
municate their views to their Congressmen •— for it may soon be
too late in South Africa for Ihe U.S. to do anything about the situa
tion there.
(EXCLUSIVE TO CPS)—Approximately one out of every 32
adult South Africans is in jail today. It is possible, under existing
law in the Republic of South Africa, to arrest a citizen with no charge
whatsoever and hold that person incommunicado for 90 days, at the
end of which he may be ordered held for another 90 day period, ad
infinitum. The only person such a prisoner may see during the 90
day period is the federal minister of justice, who most likely signed
the order to put him away.
In the Republic of South Africa it is a crime punishable by death
1o paint a poster or make a speech advocating any change whatsoever
in the social or economic system of the country. The law does not
spell out what sort of change is to be prohibited from public utter
ance—this is left to the government to define.
The South African government may declare a state of national
emergency at any time, throwing the country into martial law and
giving the government power to rule by decree. Certain areas of the
country, such as the Transkei, have in fact been ruled in such a man
ner for extended periods of time.
ANY PERSON IN South Africa not of the white race must carry
on his person at all times a complicated set of identification papers
and a pass to be in the area where he works and perhaps lives. This
pass must bear the signatures and up-to-date authorizations of his
tribal authorities, his employer", the local and national police agencies,
and numerous other officials. Any African may be arrested and
jailed for up to 48 hours for simple failure to produce the pass on
request — and who is to say whether or not he had a pass on him
except the police who arrested him?
In the Republic of South Africa, the Communist Party has been
banned since 1950. The African Nalional Congress, the Pan-African
Congress, and all other vehicles of native expression have been
banned in the last decade. The opposition Liberal party, though not
banned, is constantly harrassed, and the editor of its fortnightly
paper has been arrested. The only sizeable multi-racial organization
in the country, the National Union of South African Students
(NUSAS) was recently raided by the government police and it ap
pears that the government plans to ban NUSAS as well.
Some 4,000 books have been banned by the Republic government
as unfit for the eyes of South Africans, white or black. Among the
authors on the banned list, are: Peter Abrahams, Richard Wright,
James Baldwin, Nicholas VTonserrat, D. H. Lawrence, Emile Zola,
Francoise Sagan, Ernest jiemingway, Tennessee Williams, Robert
Graves, and John Steinbeck.
Most Americans, though not familiar with the details of the South
African situation, are at least acquainted with the word "apartheid"
and the philosophy it represents—complete separation of the races
and dominance by the white minority in South Africa. In the words
of the leaders of the Arikaner Nationalist Party, the government
party, apartheid is the means to "save white civilization in South
Africa." The Nationalists are frighteningly correct — for they have

activist and violent group, headed by Robert Sobuke, who is cur
rently serving a three-year term in jail.
The only organized white opposition is found in the Liberal Party,
headed by Alan Patton and others. The Liberals have never succeeded
in electing a candidate to parliament. The national union of students,
NUSAS, has also played an important role of opposition, and it; ap
pears that the government is planning to ban NUSAS as well. NUSAS
is opposed by a government front union, the Afriganse Studcnte
bonde.
In other words, the situation in South Africa is such that it is
Jotally impossible to follow a road of peaceful and non-violent pro
test against the government policy of apartheid. The only road open
to the African majority is now through violence and civil war. The
violent answer has been steadily gaining among the Africans, wit
ness the ANC's losing ground inexorably to the PAC over the past
tew years.
THE INDEPENDENT nations of Africa have begun to send as
sistance to rebels and violent elements in South Africa, and a civil
'var, a war that will probably surpass Algeria's in bloodshed, can
oe expected to erupt within a year or two. Given the fact that a civil
war is already underway in neighboring Angola, a civil war in
preparation in Mozambique, and rumblings of violence in Southern
Rhodesia, the entire Southern portion of the African continent is
likely to erupt into violence of the worst sort shortly. The League
of Nations mandate of Southwest Africa is currently under review
by the International Court of Justice at The Hague, and it seems
obvious that the mandate will be returned to the United Nations,
where the Afro-Asian bloc will most certainly push for action to
take the territory from South Africa, by military force if necessary.
The South African government is preparing for war. All males
in the country from elementary school age up are currently receiving
military training, and the government is even considering the draft
ing of women into the army. Production of arms has tripled in the
past three years.
The United States with some billion dollars invested in South
Africa, has to date refused to vote for strong action against South
Africa in the United Nations. It would appear reasonable to assume
that the U.S., along with Britain will be forced to "put up or shut
up" on the South African question within the next year, and it is
necessary that all American students study the problem and com
municate their views to their Congressmen •— for it may soon be
too late in South Africa for Ihe U.S. to do anything about the situa
tion there.
(EXCLUSIVE TO CPS)—Approximately one out of every 32
adult South Africans is in jail today. It is possible, under existing
law in the Republic of South Africa, to arrest a citizen with no charge
whatsoever and hold that person incommunicado for 90 days, at the
end of which he may be ordered held for another 90 day period, ad
infinitum. The only person such a prisoner may see during the 90
day period is the federal minister of justice, who most likely signed
the order to put him away.
In the Republic of South Africa it is a crime punishable by death
1o paint a poster or make a speech advocating any change whatsoever
in the social or economic system of the country. The law does not
spell out what sort of change is to be prohibited from public utter
ance—this is left to the government to define.
The South African government may declare a state of national
emergency at any time, throwing the country into martial law and
giving the government power to rule by decree. Certain areas of the
country, such as the Transkei, have in fact been ruled in such a man
ner for extended periods of time.
ANY PERSON IN South Africa not of the white race must carry
on his person at all times a complicated set of identification papers
and a pass to be in the area where he works and perhaps lives. This
pass must bear the signatures and up-to-date authorizations of his
tribal authorities, his employer", the local and national police agencies,
and numerous other officials. Any African may be arrested and
jailed for up to 48 hours for simple failure to produce the pass on
request — and who is to say whether or not he had a pass on him
except the police who arrested him?
In the Republic of South Africa, the Communist Party has been
banned since 1950. The African Nalional Congress, the Pan-African
Congress, and all other vehicles of native expression have been
banned in the last decade. The opposition Liberal party, though not
banned, is constantly harrassed, and the editor of its fortnightly
paper has been arrested. The only sizeable multi-racial organization
in the country, the National Union of South African Students
(NUSAS) was recently raided by the government police and it ap
pears that the government plans to ban NUSAS as well.
Some 4,000 books have been banned by the Republic government
as unfit for the eyes of South Africans, white or black. Among the
authors on the banned list, are: Peter Abrahams, Richard Wright,
James Baldwin, Nicholas VTonserrat, D. H. Lawrence, Emile Zola,
Francoise Sagan, Ernest jiemingway, Tennessee Williams, Robert
Graves, and John Steinbeck.
Most Americans, though not familiar with the details of the South
African situation, are at least acquainted with the word "apartheid"
and the philosophy it represents—complete separation of the races
and dominance by the white minority in South Africa. In the words
of the leaders of the Arikaner Nationalist Party, the government
party, apartheid is the means to "save white civilization in South
Africa." The Nationalists are frighteningly correct — for they have
painted themselves into a corner with the paint of repressive social
legislation, and it appears that there is no way out of the corner for
South Africa short of violence.
THE VVORI) "APARTHEID" was first coined for use in the 1948
South African elections, when Dr. Daniel Malan, Nationalist leader
of the time correctly surmised that the more extreme the call to
racism, the more likely a victory at the polls in South Africa. The
Afriganer Nationalists won that election, and have steadily increased
their majority in parliament since that time. The Nationalists have
been in control of the country for more than a decade now, and have
ensured their control by cutting those few "coloureds" on the voting
rolls and adding in their place the votes of the white citizens of
Southwest Africa, a League of Nations mandate to South Africa.
Faced with increasing African unrest during the last decade as
a result of government apai'theid policies, the Nationalists have
passed a series of laws, which in the words of the International Com
mission of Jurists, "... surpass the bounds of civilized jurispru
dence."
The first important legislative moves of the Afrikaner Nationalists
were the Mixed Marriage and Immorality Act, the intent of which
should be obvious from the title, and the Population Registration
Act, classifying the population by racial origin. Both acts were passed
in 1950.
In 1958 the Strijdom administration eliminated the Cape Coloureds
from the voting rolls, and secured passage of the Bantu Education
Act, which totally segregated all schools in the nation and placed
the control of education of native Africans completely in the hands
of the government. Strijdom also originated the Criminal Law
Amendment Act, which virtually outlawed non-violent and peaceful
demonstrations against the government.
11. F. VERWOERD succeeded Strijdom, and continues in office to

this day. He immediately launched the government on a course of
repressive legislation without equal in the world, including dictator
ships of the left, and the right.
Most important of these items of legislation are the Sabotage
Act and the General Laws Amendment Act, which together have
turned South Africa into a small scale repilca of Nazi Germany.
The Sabotage Act makes it a crime punishable by not less than
5 years with a maximum penalty of death to disrupt any public
facility or service, commit burglary or trespass, or strike for higher
wages, and a great many other things, if the accused cannot prove
his act was not intended to, among other things: a) cause or promote
general dislocation, disturbance or disorder, b) further or encourage
any political aim designed to bring about change in the economic or
social structure of the Republic, and c) embarass the administration
of the affairs of state. The other "incidental" matters referred to
in the Act make it in effect illegal to protest the policies of the gov
ernment in any public manner.
Under the Suppression of Communism Act, all newspapers in the
country are required to deposit about $30,000 with the government,
which is automatically forfeited if the government decides that the
newspaper is furthering the "aims of Communism."
Other acts passed by the Nationalists are suggestive enough by
their titles: the Public Safety Act, the Criminal Procedure Act, the
Riotous Assemblies Act, and the Unlawful Organizations Act, among
others.
THE AFRIKANER RESPONSE to charges that South Africa has
become a fascist police state is that the government is in the process
of assuring self-government and economic progress for the African
through the creation of autonomous "Bantustans" throughout the
country, to be infused with massive amounts of government aid. In
fact, these Bantustans are and obviously will remain under the direct
control of the national police. Together, the Bantustans, which are
located in some of the worst geographical areas of the nation, con
stitute only 13 per ccrit of the land area of South Africa, on which
about 75 per cent of the population is expected to live.
The two leading African organizations in opposition to the govern
ment are the African National Congress, headed by Nobel Prize
winner Albert Luthuli, who is now under house arrest with all citi
zens prohibited from conversing with him or publishing his writings
under pain of imprisonment; and the Pan-African Congress, a more
activist and violent group, headed by Robert Sobuke, who is cur
rently serving a three-year term in jail.
The only organized white opposition is found in the Liberal Party,
headed by Alan Patton and others. The Liberals have never succeeded
in electing a candidate to parliament. The national union of students,
