KENNEDY
Editor, The Daily:
After the public breast-beating
and blood-letting, one should ask,
Was the assassination a tragedy?
Was it a crime against society?
as it a sympton of an American
disease?
The assassination was .not a
tragedy: in exact terms, a trag
edy is the self-caused doom of a
hero with a flaw, affected by the
flaw. Kennedy's ardent adherents
imply ho was a hero; will they
explain his flaw? I have heard no
Liberal do soâ€”that would require
a more rigorous discussion of
American constitutional prin
ciples and the nature of man than
any modern Liberal wishes to at
tempt. In the limited context of
the day of the assassination, the
apparent flaw was Lee Oswald's.
Do the Liberals therefore imply
that Kennedy's flaw was to op
pose the likes of Oswald, that in
order to save his life he should
have conciliated Marxism? Or,
were the Liberals simply trying
to eat their rhetorical cake and
have it too?
No, they were not just talking;
a person's speech indicates hi s
view of reality.
The assassination was not a
crime against society: in exact
terms, a society is a relation be
tween men, formed by mutual
agreement; a crime is a violation
of someone's inalienable rights.
Not to distinguish between an in
animate abstraction and a con
crete individual is to be confused;
to confuse such a floating abstrac
tion as "the good of the Whole"
with the good of an individual is
to be a Liberal. To suggest that
the murder committed by Lee Os
wald against John Kennedy was
a crime against every other in
dividual is to be any of a number
of Liberal hair-tearers and ash
heapers.
No, the Liberals were not just
baring their feeling; they were
immolating thought on the altar
of their feeling.
The assassination was not the
symptom of a disease originated
in America. The assassin was not
a conservative, as Liberals de

voutly hoped, but a Marxist. He
was not one who upheld the
American constitution and in
dividual inalienable rights, but
one who discarded his citizenship
and violated Kennedy's right to
live. He was not one who believed
that thought is man's basic tool
of survival, but one who chose
physical force as his basic tool.
He was not an atheist, but: one
who had merely switched his
superraturalism from Omnipo
tent God to Omnipotent Society.
No, it was not just Hate, but
rather the unreasonable hate of
an irrational man that effected
the murder.
But the subsequent wailing and
gnashing of teeth is a symptom
of an American disease, Social
Metaphysics.* In exact terms,
one'j? metaphysics is one's view of
the nature of reality; to a Social
Metaphysician, reality is people.
A Social Metaphysician asks not
"what is true?" but "What do
others say is true?" The number
of persons who traded tears after
the assassination, saying "I don't
know what to think" and asking
"What shall we do?" is much
smaller than the number of pei*-
sons who just listened to and ac
cepted the public confessional,
not bothering to identify the
issues, not willing to make their
own judgment. The sum of those
numbers is the number of Social
Metaphysicians. It is the major
ity of the American voting public.

SHURTLEFF PASSPORT
Editor, The Daily:
The recent Daily article con
cerning Jeff Shurtleff and his re
fusal to sign a loyalty oath seems
to have received very little atten
tion among the student body. The
normal student, ostensibly con
cerned with civil liberties, has be
came so acclimatized to the idea
that the government may demand
statements of political innocence
from its citizens that Mr. Shurt
leff's action is either casually dis
missed or ridiculed.
When scientific research estab
lishments began to function for
"national interests," it was to be
expected that only the politically
pure should be allowed access to
knowledge, and at the time only

a few stood up against the secur
ity clearance and the loyalty oath.
From here Iho progression has
been quite logical; one must now
sign oaths of "non-affiliation" to
teach, to get an NDEA loan, to
work at a plant which has gov
ernment contracts, or to do any
thing for the State of California,
and few will stand up or speak
out. When IvPFA was Under se
cret investigation by the Senate,
many in the student body ex
pressed outrage, but now that it
is having difficulties over loyalty
oaths, few seem very excited. I
must agree with Professor Joseph

Tussman, of the University of
California, who spoke recently of
"a nation of oath takers, of asso
ciation disclaimers, and of seek
ers after the clean dossier."
Last year the government de
cided that American citizens
ought to declare their political
affiliations, or lack of them, in
order to travel outside the United
States. Jeff Shnrtleff seems to
havei felt it more important to re
tain his autonomy as an individ
ual than to comply for the sake
of a passport. It is unfortunate
that he must stand alone.
