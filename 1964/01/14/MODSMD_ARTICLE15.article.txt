# ACCENT ON SPORTS
## Athletics in Good Hands 
### PETE EAKLAND 
In tho summer of 1963, Ino university elevated Charles (Chuck)
Taylor from the position of assistant athletic director to athletic
director, a post left vacant by the stepping 1 down of A 1 Masters.
Asked to perform many and varied duties during his long associa
tion with the Stanford athletic department spread over almost 25
years, Chuck not. only has produced good results, hui outstanding
ones. Entrusted now with the leadership of the department, he faces
several challenges, besides winning games, the biggest of which is
the improvement of Stanford's indoor sports facilities. Willing 1o
work hard, endowed with an effervescence ihat makes him likable
and popular, and a good organizer, he is as capable an atheletic
director ;is can he found in the country.
Chuck Taylor entered Stanford in 1939 after attending high school
in San Jose. At a time when many high school students did not
consider college, he had little intention of pursuing his studies. Re
ceiving some sound advice from his football coach, Walt: Williams,

he spent an extra year in high
school acquiring the necessary
credits for admission to Stanford.
Because of the high respect which
he held for his coach and because
of his great love of sports, Chuck
Taylor from his earliest days at
the Farm aspired to be a coach.
I'LAYKI) FOR INDIANS
Fortunately, his arrival on Ihe
varsity squad coincided with the
arrival at Stanford of one of the
country's greatest football men
tors, Clark Shaughnessy, ihe per
son responsible for the introduc
tion of the T-formation. Having
previously played quarterback in
the single wing. Chuck became
stationed in tho middle of the
line at guard.

In throe years of varsity play, he won all-Coast honors each sea
son, played on ihe Stanford Rose Bowl team of 1941, and added extra
! lustre to a great career in his senior year when he was named Ail-
American.
Before pursuing the coaching profession, Chuck served three
years in the navy. He then returned to Stanford and served a brief
stint as freshman football coach. Next year, there was no freshman
team and he played professionally with Ihe Miami Seahawks. He
was freshman coach again the next year and the year after was line
coach of the '49ers.
Squeezed between his football activities, Chuck found time to
holster several inadequacies in the Stanford athletic area. When a
team was minus a coach or when a program was sagging. Chuck !
Taylor was one of the lirsi approached and was always willing to
lend what assistance he could. With slim credentials, he took on the!
positions of head wrestling and rugby coaches. Also, he lent his en- j
thusiasm for sports to the intramural program and it soon became a !
vital cog in students' lives at Stanford. The credentials were now
accumulating.
A* HEAD FOOTBALL C OACH
In 1951, he was appointed head football coach, the youngest coach
of any major college at that time. He justified Ihe athletic depart
ment's confidence in his coaching ability by achieving what all ex
ports thought impossible â€” the Pacific Coast Conference champion
ship. Powerful Illinois disposed of Taylor's Indians in the Rose Bowl,
but Coach of the Year selectors did not pass him by, and he became
the youngest ever to receive the honor. The previous Stanford coach
so honored was Shaughnessy in 1940, the year Taylor began his!
varsity career.
Heading the West coaching staff in the 1953 East-West game, he
coached his team to a stunning victory over highly favored East,
31-7. The year later, he was a member of the collegiate All-Star
coaching staff.
FOOTBALL BIST SPORT TO COACH
Chuck Taylor finds football the most intriguing and most chal
lenging of all sports from the coaching point of view. In 19f54, the
new position of Assistant Athletic director was created and he de
cided to accept it. Several things influenced his decision. He realized
the extraordinary competitiveness of coaching and also wanted to
be able to devote more time to his growing family.
A 1 Masters, because of health reasons, retired as athletic director!
last year, and with no qualms whatsoever, the university selected
Chuck Taylor 1o take over the reins. As alhlotio director, he is
responsible for the operation, finance, and budgeting of the athletic
department.
Looking ahead to Stanford's athletic future, Chuck Taylor sees
four major areas where improvements are necessary. The most
pressing problem is the condition of the indoor plant. He says that j
it is probably the most inadequate that exists in any of the nation's
major colleges. The projected basketball pavilion, which will also ;
serve as a much needed student activities center, is at: the lop of '
coming improvements. If the money is marie available this year,
Stanford's cagers two years hence will be playing their games in it. j
Directly opposite to the condition of the indoor plant, Stanford's
outdoor plant which includes a top-notch football stadium, playing
fields, tennis courts, the Sunken baseball diamond, and two fine
tracks.
IMPROVE INTRAMURAL PROGRAM
Improvement of the intramural program is another facet of forth
coming changes. At present, there is jack of equipment and lack of
space. When the new pavilion is completed, space in the old pavilion

will bo remodeled so that it can j
he used for such things as weight '
training and wrestling.
To put into effect: Ihe modern
izations that are necessary to ef
fectively service the needs of the
entire Stanford community, an in
crease in Ihe income of the athle
tic department is a must. The
additional funds will he used to
support the sports that at present
are more or less forgotten by the
department because of insuffi-j
cent money, such as lacrosse and !
crew.
