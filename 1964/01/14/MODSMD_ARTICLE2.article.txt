# Mendicants Prepare Concerts Featuring Seven New Songs
## 
### HOPE SELBY 
An old eastern college tradi
tion came to the West coast when
the Stanford Mendicants began
giving concerts of songs ranging
from "Baby Talk" to the Alma
Mater.
The group, which until now has
included fourteen members, will
add two members this quarter.
Tryouts will be held through Fri
day of tliis week from 5 to 6
p.m. in Bowman Alumni house.
All parts, especially first tenors
and second basses, may try out.
SEVEN NEW arrangements
will be featured in concerts later
this quarter, to add to such al
ready well known sogns as "Tear
It Down," "Lovely Way to Spend
an Evening," and "A Fellow
Needs a Girl." Names of the new
songs are being kept secret until
the group lecls they are ready
for performance.
Concert plans are still indefin
ite, but the group has been in
vited to give alumni concerts in
Fresno and Los Angeles, and con
sidering joint concerts with other
colleges in the Bay Area. Infor
mal concerts in women's dorms
are also planned. The group has
also been asked to form the nu
cleus of the male chorus in the
Ram's Head spring production of

I "Guys and Dolls."
Also under consideration are
plans for a spring concert tour
and a repetition of summer sing
ing in Southern California. The
group hopes eventually to sing in
Hawaii.
Fewer concerts than usual were
given last quarter because the
group was rehearsing for the rec
ord featuring nineteen of their
arrangements. The record is be
ing sold in living groups at a
cost of $4. Record sales were
were higher than expected, busi
ness manager Jay Oberdorf said.
IN ADDITION to the concerts
at social events and in living
groups, the group also gives what
it terms "sweetheart serenades,"
sung when a member of the
group or someone close to the
group becomes pinned or engaged,
i These serenades always include
! the song "You're My Girl," and
the girl being honored is given
flowers.
The group was formed last
spring under the leadership of
arranger Hank Adams, then a ju
nior who had sung at Yale with
the Augmented Seven, one of the
many campus singing groups
there.
They have been asked for many
encores, but were forced to give
one at spring sing last year
which has since become one of
their most popular numbers.
When things got bogged down
during the intermission, the Men
dicants had to keep on singing,
even though they had exhausted
their repertoire. One of the mem
bers started singing a rock and
roll background, another soloed,
the rest of the group provided ad
lib harmony, and the mendicant's
arrangement of "Baby Talk"
came into being. Since then, the
song lias been featured at almost
every concert.
PERHAPS IT IS on-the-spot ar
j rangements like this one, or per
haps it is the old favorites that
have given the Mendicants such a
following that they can talk about
"raging battles with depraved
Stanford women" on the back of
their record.

ready well known sogns as "Tear
It Down," "Lovely Way to Spend
an Evening," and "A Fellow
Needs a Girl." Names of the new
songs are being kept secret until
the group lecls they are ready
for performance.
Concert plans are still indefin
ite, but the group has been in
vited to give alumni concerts in
Fresno and Los Angeles, and con
sidering joint concerts with other
colleges in the Bay Area. Infor
mal concerts in women's dorms
are also planned. The group has
also been asked to form the nu
cleus of the male chorus in the
Ram's Head spring production of

I "Guys and Dolls."
Also under consideration are
plans for a spring concert tour
and a repetition of summer sing
ing in Southern California. The
group hopes eventually to sing in
Hawaii.
Fewer concerts than usual were
given last quarter because the
group was rehearsing for the rec
ord featuring nineteen of their
arrangements. The record is be
ing sold in living groups at a
cost of $4. Record sales were
were higher than expected, busi
ness manager Jay Oberdorf said.
IN ADDITION to the concerts
at social events and in living
groups, the group also gives what
it terms "sweetheart serenades,"
sung when a member of the
group or someone close to the
group becomes pinned or engaged,
i These serenades always include
! the song "You're My Girl," and
the girl being honored is given
flowers.
The group was formed last
spring under the leadership of
arranger Hank Adams, then a ju
nior who had sung at Yale with
the Augmented Seven, one of the
many campus singing groups
there.
They have been asked for many
encores, but were forced to give
one at spring sing last year
which has since become one of
their most popular numbers.
When things got bogged down
during the intermission, the Men
dicants had to keep on singing,
even though they had exhausted
their repertoire. One of the mem
bers started singing a rock and
roll background, another soloed,
the rest of the group provided ad
lib harmony, and the mendicant's
arrangement of "Baby Talk"
came into being. Since then, the
song lias been featured at almost
every concert.
PERHAPS IT IS on-the-spot ar
j rangements like this one, or per
haps it is the old favorites that
have given the Mendicants such a
following that they can talk about
"raging battles with depraved
Stanford women" on the back of
their record.
An old eastern college tradi
tion came to the West coast when
the Stanford Mendicants began
giving concerts of songs ranging
from "Baby Talk" to the Alma
Mater.
The group, which until now has
included fourteen members, will
add two members this quarter.
Tryouts will be held through Fri
day of tliis week from 5 to 6
p.m. in Bowman Alumni house.
All parts, especially first tenors
and second basses, may try out.
