# Stanford Players to Present Twin Bill; O'Neill, Cocteau Plavs to Open Jan. 22
## 
### 
Joan Cocteau's "The Eagle With
Two Heads" and Eugene O'Neill's
"Long Day's Journey Into Night"
will be the next two Stanford
Players productions.
The two plays run concurrently
from January 22nd through tho
25th. "The Eagle With Two
Heads" will play in the Little
Theatre while "Long Day's Jour
ney Into Nighl" is scheduled for
the new Nightery Theatre.
THIS DOUBLING-UP of plays
was made possible when Stanford
Players refurnished the old Stu
dent Union Building's lounge and
opened the Nightery Theatre.
Two plays could hardly have
been chosen to contrast more
strikingly than the flamboyant
"The Eagle With Two Heads"
and the introspective "Long Day's
Journey Into Night," according
to Stanford Players' Thomas
Price. To see the two dramas suc
cessively would bo a swing from
A to Z through theatrical styles.
"The Eagle With Two Heads"
was a timely choice. The "enfant
terrible" of French letters died
only last month. This production
acknowledges Cocteau's theatri
cal genius. At one time or an
other, Cocteau worked with
Diaghlcv on stage movement,
with Picasso on theatrical decor,
and with Stravinski on sound ef
fects.
"The Eagle With Two Heads"
seems to have been written with
all three in mind. The trouble with
modern plays, Cocteau said, was
that they had degenerated into
talkathons. Theatre is not a lec
ture hall for sociologists and it is

not a household furnishings dis
play for Peeping Toms. So Coc
teau wrote "The Eagle With Two
Heads" flagarantly theatrical.
ON THE OTHER side of the
coin, O'Neill's "Long Day's Jour
ney Into Night" is a private and
introspective drama. O'Neill made
the stipulation that the play must
never be performed while he was
alive. Consequently the play was
withheld for some fifteen years
until Carlotta Monteray, his wife,
decided to release the script be
cause it had generated such curi
osity.
The two plays, coming from
opposite poles of theatre, make
an unusual double entry on the
Stanford campus. They may be
compared by seeing Cocteau's
"The Eagle With Two Heads" in
the Little Theatre and O'Neill's
"Long Day's Journey Into Night"
iii the Nightery Theatre. But ac
commodation is very limited, for,
although the Little Theatre seats
200, there are only fifty seats in
the Nightery.
O'Neill put all the family, in
cluding himself, into the play
without any attempt to disguise
their identity or to hide their
weaknesses. These were enough.
