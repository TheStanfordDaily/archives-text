# Vale Freshman Rights' Defendant
## 
### 
NEW HAVEN, Conn. (CPS)
A Yale University freshman has
volunteered to be a defendant in
a civil rights test case in Clarks
dale, Miss., next spring.
Richard L. Van Wagenen ol'
Washington, D.C., was arrested
last October in Clarksdale for
"littering." Van Wagenen was
passing out leaflets for the mock
election of Aaron Henry at the
time of the arrest.
Also arrested at the same time
were four local Negro workers.
They were convicted, but Van
Wagenen had to return to New
Haven before his trial came up.
Van Wagenen said his defense
was being provided by the legal
fund of the NAACP. The NACCP
has agreed to use Van Wagenen's
trial as a test case because of
certain irregularities regarding
his arrest, the Yale freshman
said.
His expenses down to Missis
sippi are being provided by the
Democratic Central Committee of
the District of Columbia.
Van Wagegen said that his case
will be appealed if he is found
guilty. There is no jail sentence
for littering.
