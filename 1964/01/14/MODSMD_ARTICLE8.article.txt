# REINHARDT:
## World Best Test In Self-Realization 
### JANET ROSS Associate Editor 
"For existentialist thinkers, the
world is the best testing ground
in self-realization," Dr. Kurt Rein
hardt, emeritus Professor of Ger
man emphasized last night in the
first of Tresidder Union's "Ex
istent alism Series."
More than 600 eager listeners
overflowed Tresidder's ma in
lounge, and filled two additional
rooms in order to hear Reinhardt
explain "The Main Themes of the
Philosophy of Existence."
Existentialism, he said, is con
cerned with the mysteries and re
sources of man's own self. It in
volves "a type of speculation not
only related 4o the concerns of
actual, every day life but to the
essentials of every day action."
AC C ORDING TO ' Reinhardt,
J "The philosophy of existence
j claims to be the philosophy of
: I. rather than the philosophy of
jit." He outlined nine main themes
j of this philosophy including:
• Subjective truth."It is the
j common conviction of all existen
tial philosophy that no knowl
edge is independent of the know-
I ing subject."
• Anxiety. Anxiety results
trom experiencing nothingless. It
arouses man from everyday life
and relases him for existential
life.
• Existence and others. Au
i thentic existence can only be rea
j lized by solitary existence.
• Situation and Limit of Situ
ation. Man is thrown into a situ
ation which he has not chosen
and which is threatened by a hos
tile environment.
• Temporality and Historicity,
i Because man must take account
of his heritage he is never abso
lutely free in existential choice.
• Existence and Death. An au
thentically existing person lives
in awareness of death so his
everyday life remains meaning
ful.
• Existence and Cod. Chris
tianity is the relationship between
existence of man and God "The
Christian thinker is always the
existential thin ke r. otherwise
there is no Christian thinker."
