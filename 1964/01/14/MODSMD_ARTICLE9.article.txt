# STANFORD:
## Snazzeroos Under the Palm Fronds 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
In the pages of this month's Show magazine,
sandwiched unobtrusively between some sweaty
color photos of Richard Burton, et al, and an illus
trated survey of Viennese pastry, is a relevant
report of singularly refreshing iconoclasm. It
might easily be missed by the careless reader con
cerned with the intricacies of Mr. Burton's physi
ognomy. and that would be unfortunate; for it
bears the incredible title: "Stanford University:
Snazzeroos Under The Palm Fronds."
The genetic characteristics constituting a snaz
zeroo remain somewhat obscure to the last, but
Show reporter Richard Atcheson's thesis is as clear
and delicious as nectar: Stanford University has
come of age. Apparently the word has finally fil
tered up to the stratospheric regions of big time
.journalism — and what's more, somebody up there
likes us. In their introduction to the article (the
second in a two-part series entitled "An Inquiry
Into College Culture") the editors of Show casu
ally refer to Stanford as "... a Pacific commu
nity of singular, untrammeled students." To at
least one, only slightly trammeled student, weary
of bland journalistic smiles at the academic and
cultural virility of the Alma Mater, such a state
ment is manna from heaven indeed.
REPORT UK ATC HESON has obviously done
some extensive, grass roots research in prepara
tion for his article. The result is Iho most frank
and perceptive analysis of Stanford yet published.
Gone is the 'great country club in the sun.' This
is the 'new Stanford.' and its image fairly glistens
with possibility.
Atcheson begins by quoting a recruiter for a
New York publishing firm to the effect that all is
fun and frolic in this "lotus pad of academe." In
the remainder of his report, Atcheson compiles a
detailed document which renders such a dismissal
patently impossible.
"... There is a broad belt of middling under
graduates who seek little more from Stanford
than the shade of the palm fronds, a little gin and
a handful of coeds . . " Atcheson admits. "But
beyond the middle belt." he continues, "is plenty
of room for dedicated scholars, political fanatics
and the beard and sandals set Even among
the tanned, lithe, beautiful people who pose, im
; peccably sweatered and slacked, in the sun on the
terrace of the student union are those who study
J harder than they would like their friends to know
I and who believe more ardently in causes than most
Princeton students dare."
ATCHESON TURNS to a description of the
| campus and its much-vaunted assets. He makes
passing comment on the übiquitous PACE pro
gram. the "Barbary Coast Byzantine mood" of
i Memorial Church, and linear accelerator, the for
eign campuses, and "a faculty of brilliant accom
plishment. incandescent fame and high salary."
The embryonic development of our little 'Athens
I of the Fir Wcf apparently fvrimte~ reporter

Atcheson. Ho conscientiously recounts the univer
sity's "raw and vital origins," incidentally imply
ing that none were more 'raw and vital' than Lc
land Stanford himself.
At one point in his chronicle, self-appointed
historian Atcheson makes an extremely interesting
comparison between Stanford in the time of David
Starr Jordan and Stanford 1964. He notes that in
those "pastoral days," before PACE and the zip
code, it was quite natural for President Jordan to
casually drop in on the nightly bull sessions in the
men's dorm. "Nothing so simple could happen at
Stanford today," Atcheson understates. He com
ments, "J. E. Wallace Sterling. . . . could hardly
risk an evening stroll for fear of inducing a stu
dent demonstration." Then, as if to prove his point,
he goes on to give a blow by blow account of the
'fallout shelter crisis' of last spring, during which,
according to reporter Atcheson's version, Presi
dent Sterling was "made captive behind the gates
of his house by students picketing against his
decision. . . ."
IN HIS PROFILE of the Stanford student body,
Atcheson gives apathy its due. but his knowledge
able analysis of the internal politics of the com
munity emphasizes active concern. Even more op
timistic than his apparent sources of information,
Atcheson finds an ac tivist sentiment at the core of
student life. In "Charmin' Armin' Rosencranz'
term of office as ASSU President, he sees the
seeds of revolution.
Why all this ferment? Atcheson has an opin
ion: "It relates to something in the California air,
perhaps, and something unusually human about
the official attitudes of a university so vast. Con
sciously or not, the university is exceptionally in
dulgent of individual quirks and demands within
the student mass."
In the last section of his analysis, Atcheson
seizes upon the Creative Writing Center, under the
direction of Wallace E. Stegncr, as a symbol of the
vital non-conformity that he finds at the core of
Stanford's intellectual climate. He describes an
English 203 session at Stegner's home and counters
Irving Howe's contention that there is no place for
a bohemia in the Stanford sun with a description
of the Pery Lane section in Menlo Park.
For Atcheson. the enthusiastic, determined
"watch me" attitude of one Creative Writing fel
low is the essence of Stanford's promise. "It is
an intangible quality," he concludes, "too often
lost in the thickening tangle of organizational
regulations, but it is that characteristic of Stan
ford which distinguishes it from many other insti
tutions."
By the time this issue of the Daily g«»cs to
press, it is quite possible that all copies of the
January 1064 volume of Show magazine will be
gone from the union store. Such an unhappy
scarcity should he no deterrent. This is an issue
well worth some trouble to obtain. Even if nothing
more than a souvenir for an activist's hope chest,
