We're just beginning to realize
how true it is that a man's think
ing determines his life. Yet it
was many years ago when the
Bible proverb was written, "As
he thinketh in his heart, so ie
he." This is one reason why
prayer is so important. Prayer
helps to bring our thoughts
under the controlling power of
God — to give us "the mind of
Christ." You're invited to hear a
one-hour public lecture on this
subject by William Milford

Board of Lectureship. Title:
"Your Thinking Determines
Your Experience." Everyone is
welcome to come and listen.
