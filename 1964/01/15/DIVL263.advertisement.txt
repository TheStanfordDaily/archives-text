[Eagle Shirtmakers Proudly Announces]
NO. CALDWELL, N. J. MAN or a MISS LAUREN
WINS COVETED AFFLERBACH FELLOWSHIP!
AFTER what is possibly the world's record rumination over who won a color-naming competition
/Vwe have reached a decision. If you can remember that far back, more than a year ago we de
plored the uninspired names given to colors (light green, dark blue, etc.) as well as the sheer flights
of fancy that conveyed nothing at all (Kumquat Blossom Time, December Showers, Teaneck, etc.).
We asked your assistance in conjuring up new, evocative names for shirt colors, but names that
also had some connection with reality; such as Whizzer White, Well Red, Navel Orange, and so on.
★ To make the enterprise more tempting we dangled a Grand Prize of a Traveling Afflerbach
Fellowship: a glamorous weekend at Quakertown, Pa., our HQ (with a free sightseeing trip into
romantic Philadelphia), or a dozen Eagle Shirts, Additionally, there were 9 Stationary Afflerbachs
of 1/2 dozen Eagle Shirts offered as second prizes. * Well, here it is: The winner is none other
than either W. R. Goodwin of No. Caldwell, N. J. or Janet Lauren of New York, N. Y.! They were
so close, which is what held us up, that they both win the grand prize. Second prize winners will be
notified by mail. Congratulations, all! * Among the thousands and thousands of splendid names
submitted—some of which we shall surely use—were the following:

WINS COVETED AFFLERBACH FELLOWSHIP!
AFTER what is possibly the world's record rumination over who won a color-naming competition
/Vwe have reached a decision. If you can remember that far back, more than a year ago we de
plored the uninspired names given to colors (light green, dark blue, etc.) as well as the sheer flights
of fancy that conveyed nothing at all (Kumquat Blossom Time, December Showers, Teaneck, etc.).
We asked your assistance in conjuring up new, evocative names for shirt colors, but names that
also had some connection with reality; such as Whizzer White, Well Red, Navel Orange, and so on.
★ To make the enterprise more tempting we dangled a Grand Prize of a Traveling Afflerbach
Fellowship: a glamorous weekend at Quakertown, Pa., our HQ (with a free sightseeing trip into
romantic Philadelphia), or a dozen Eagle Shirts, Additionally, there were 9 Stationary Afflerbachs
of 1/2 dozen Eagle Shirts offered as second prizes. * Well, here it is: The winner is none other
than either W. R. Goodwin of No. Caldwell, N. J. or Janet Lauren of New York, N. Y.! They were
