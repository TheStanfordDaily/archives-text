ARE YOU A CHILD OF GOD?
It is often asserted that all men are children of God. While racial equality and
complete freedom for all are vital issues of our time ,it is incorrect to state fhat
all of us are children of God. A child of God is any individual, (of any race),
who has acceped Jesus Christ as personal Saviour, and who has thereby been
born into God's family.
"For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus." Gal. 3:26.
"While you have the Light, believe in the Light—have faith in it, hold to it,
rely on it—that you may become sons of the Light and be filled with light.
Jesus said these things ..." John 12:36 (Ampl.)
Those who are God's children have no doubts that they are His, for they have
received the inner light of the Holy Spirit who dwells in them permanently:
"The Spirit Himself testifies to our own spirit, that we are the children of God."
Rom. 8:16 (Ampl.)
If only a few are children of God, what of the rest of mankind? "He who com
mits sins is of the devil—takes his character from the evil one; for the devil
has sinned from the beginning. The reason the Son of Man was manifest was
to undo the works of the devil. No one born of God habitually practices sin,
for God's nature abides in him—his principle of life, the divine sperm, remains
permanently within him—and he cannot practice sinning because he is born
of God. By this it is made clear who take their nature from God and are His
children, and who take their nature from the devil and are his children: no
one who does not practice righteousness—who does not conform to God's will
in purpose, thought and action —is of God; neither is anyone who does not
love his brother.' I John 3:8-10 (Ampl.)
If you are not a child of God, you are missing out on love, peace, and joy
as well as eternal life. Your acceptance of, trust in, and reliance upon Jesus
Christ is all that is required. God does all the rest!

ARE YOU A CHILD OF GOD?
It is often asserted that all men are children of God. While racial equality and
complete freedom for all are vital issues of our time ,it is incorrect to state fhat
all of us are children of God. A child of God is any individual, (of any race),
who has acceped Jesus Christ as personal Saviour, and who has thereby been
born into God's family.
"For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus." Gal. 3:26.
"While you have the Light, believe in the Light—have faith in it, hold to it,
rely on it—that you may become sons of the Light and be filled with light.
Jesus said these things ..." John 12:36 (Ampl.)
Those who are God's children have no doubts that they are His, for they have
received the inner light of the Holy Spirit who dwells in them permanently:
"The Spirit Himself testifies to our own spirit, that we are the children of God."
Rom. 8:16 (Ampl.)
If only a few are children of God, what of the rest of mankind? "He who com
mits sins is of the devil—takes his character from the evil one; for the devil
has sinned from the beginning. The reason the Son of Man was manifest was
to undo the works of the devil. No one born of God habitually practices sin,
for God's nature abides in him—his principle of life, the divine sperm, remains
permanently within him—and he cannot practice sinning because he is born
of God. By this it is made clear who take their nature from God and are His
children, and who take their nature from the devil and are his children: no
one who does not practice righteousness—who does not conform to God's will
in purpose, thought and action —is of God; neither is anyone who does not
love his brother.' I John 3:8-10 (Ampl.)
If you are not a child of God, you are missing out on love, peace, and joy
as well as eternal life. Your acceptance of, trust in, and reliance upon Jesus
Christ is all that is required. God does all the rest!
