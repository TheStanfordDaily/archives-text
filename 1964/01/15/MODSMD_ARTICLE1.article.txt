# Anti-Nazi Resistance Discussed by Dedijer
## 
### LYNN SUSAG 
"Resistance is possible even against a state such as Nazi Germany,
hut spontaneous resistance is not enough. It withers away unless
it becomes organized," Vladimer Dedijer said last night to a capa
city crowd at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Audience participation in
questions and comments followed the Tuesday Evening lecture on

"Could the Jews Have Resisted
More in the Second World War?"
Dedijer, presently touring Cali
fornia before returning to Har
vard as a visiting professor,
served in the guerilla army of his
native country, Yugoslavia, din
ing Nazi ocupation. Following the
war he represented Yugoslavia
at Unit ed Nations conferences,
but in 19"i9 migrated to England.
The author of three books deal
ing with Yugoslavia, Dedijer is
now writing a history of the Euro
pean resistance movements of
World War IT.
DEDIJER concentrated his re
marks to five main problems: the
different European resistance
movements and their relation to
Jewish resistance, the concept of
right to resistance and Jewry's
contribution to it, the possibility
of resistance to a totalitarian
system, collaboration, and the ele
ments of sacrifice and martyrdom
in the persecution of European
Jewry.
Because the war and Nazi ag
gression in each country took
specific turns according to the
differing social institutions and
relative importance of the various
theaters of war to Hitler, resist
ance movements in each country
evolved differently, Dedijer as
serted. Similarities existed be
tween many Jewish movements,
but there were far more dissimi
larities because of their peculiar
situation in each country and the
varying attitudes of the popula
tions toward them.
The idea of the right of resist
ance was revived in Europe fol

lowing the war. This concept was
embedded in Old Testament
thought as well as medieval
church thought and other philoso
phies in Europe, but had declined
in Germany as a result of 19th
century thought. Partly because
j of this mental atmosphere, "We
, did not see in Germany itself any
inmportant phenomenon of re
sistance to Nazism until almost
the end of the Hitler rule," Dedi
jer said.
THE LINK between collabora
tion and resistance is hard to de
termine, Dedijer said in discuss-
I ing theses that Jews went to their
j deaths voluntarily policed by their
; own leaders. In considering this,
one must take into account so
cial, historical, and political
! forces, Dedijer said. Compromises
J had to be made in many cases in
j order to survive. The Jewish
councils were compelled to make j
' some concessions to superior
i force, but preserved their ow 11 j
; religious entity. Their cooperation i
was much milder compared with
other European cooperation.
Dedijer said sacrifices of life by |
individual Jews had a rational I
implication. They went to death !
with a kind of inner peace and !
j spiritual sacrifice of consecration j
j for God's name. Although their
I deaths did nothing to deter the
i Nazi aggression at the time, they
played a part in the long run
I emancipation of the Jews and the
building of the state of Israel, he
said.
Jewish resistance manifested
itself in the ways and methods
of other resistance, but also in
cluded religious and moral as
pects. They were handicapped by
a multitude of factors, however:
' lack of unified reaction, lack of
common leadership, lack of stra
tegic bases, and lack of outside
support. Dedijer said it was ab
surd to expect resistance from
middle class Jewry in Germany
when strong European states
were collopsing around them and
Germany's reputation was one of
a "Rechtsstaat."
