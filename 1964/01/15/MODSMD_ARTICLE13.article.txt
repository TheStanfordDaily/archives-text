# The 						Moral Dilemma of An Honorable Brown
## 
### 
As youth of a nation which saw an accused assasin slain on
television less than two months ago, there is something we
should recall in the political history of the dynamic governor
addressing us today.
Edmund G. Brown occupied the California Governor's
chair when the flames of hysteria, fanned by the editorial
crusading of the "Los Angeles Times," enveloped the judicial
proceedings surrounding Caryl Chessman. The Governor was
reported to have remarked at that time, "I've never seen so
many people want a person killed."
At the start of his administration, Brown declared his oppo
sition to capital punishment, commuted the sentences of four
murderers and several prisoners jailed under the same cir
cuitous law as Chessman. When the State Department was
warning the Governor that Eisenhower would be ill-received
on lu's South American tour if Chessman were not executed,
Brown posed questions of morality and went on to note the
length of time already served by Chessman in contrast with
the average murder sentence served. Browns stand on capital
punishment remained unmoved whether he was stating it
as Attorney General of California or as a political leader in
a time of emotional crisis, despite the fact that as one man
against the forces of public and press he could not stop the
Chessman execution for more consideration.
The evening after Kennedy's assasination, three students
and one of Stanford's finest administrators sat down to discuss
the fate of Lee Oswald. The administrator and one of the stu
dents proposed to the other two the possibility of the Stan
ford community voicing the conviction that this was the time
to renounce hate and violence, to turn from the traditional
response of execution, and to commit Oswald to the psychia
tric care needed by a man who could commit so senseless an
act. The reluctance of the two students took on tones of moral
indignation. For many of us, the process of elimination of hate
and vengeance is excruciating. Mere hours after the conversa
tion Oswald was shot. It is much easier to discuss the purging
of animal instinct after the soothing passage of time.
Whatever Governor Brown says to us today, we stand to
learn much. We will have before us an honorable man.
