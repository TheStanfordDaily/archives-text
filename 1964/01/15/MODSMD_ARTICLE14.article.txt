# Existence to Essense In Rhinehardt Lecture
## 
### 
The birthplace of the ideas so masterfully recounted and
interpreted by Professor Kurt Rhinehardt Monday evening
was in a lecture series audience at a German university.
Schilling had come to deliver what was to lie a classic body
of addresses. Kierkegaard—and Engels, among others—was in
the audience; he had come in search of elucidation of portions
of Hegel. The impact of Schilling's words upon the Kierke
gaard who was to give so much to the development of existen
sial thought was dynamic.
An estimated one thousand students packed the Tresidder
lounge and rooms equipped with speakers to hear the Rhine
hardt speech Monday, and their mood was one of academic
excitement and intensity. No one was being graded, no one
accorded units, but at least a few young romantics could not
help but stray from the professor's words for a moment, as
he recounted the role of the Schilling lectures, to view analog
ously the audience of which they themselves were a part and
the one before which Schilling stood. The crowds and atmos
phere gathering about Kurt Rhinehardt and Frank Manuel this
week—and the thought of the young Kierkegaard in the au
dience—somehow make palpable all that Stanford is about.
In days when Jaques Barzun lias touched off a national
controversy over the "crisis in the humanities," there is some
thing subtle and worthy of note in the effects of "after class
hours" lecture and discussion series. There is somthing to take
note of in the effects of the erection of a building like Tresid
der Memorial Union that is put to the proper uses. And there
is something to muse about in what the undergraduate library
could mean.
Perhaps the subtle presence was merely that of the normal
university processes of education. Perhaps it was something
coming to fruition in a changing Stanford student body or
a changing generation. And perhaps it was Professor Rhine
hardt. In any case, as we begin another morning of IBM class
cards, grade points and mimeographed syllabi, an esoteric
glance of gratitude is cast toward Professor Rhinehardt and
the Tresidder programmers who brought him out of retire
ment and before us again. Sartre himself would have been
proud of the visible process from the idea to the concrete, the
existence to the essense sparked by the Monday evening lec
ture.
