UNDERGKAD LIBE
Editor, The Daily:
According to your reporter
Marty Maskall in her article on
the construction work now in
progress in the Main Library, the
planned undergraduate library
"would contain mostly study
rooms and the few books there
would be for immediate reference,
like the hooks in the present Re
serve Book Room." Let me correct
this somewhat misleading state
ment:
While it is true that the Under
graduate Library will provide
space for readers generously •—
1,500 seats are planned — it will
also contain more than a few
books of what now constitutes
the permanent collection in ihe
Reserve Book Room. The building
will have a capacity of at least
150,000 volumes in open stacks.
This strength will be reached

gradually by building on an ini
tial collection of oa. 50 000 vol
umes with which we plan to open.
The collection will not only pro
vide the required and recom
mended reading for undergradu
ates as does the Reserve Book
Room now, but on all subjects—
books with which a student
should become familiar during
his undergraduate years, i.e., be
fore he specializes in graduate or
professional school. The new li
brary will, it is hoped, become
the intellectual home of general
ists on Campus—for there is no
such thing as an "undergraduate
book"—while the Main Library,
though it will never be closed to
the inquiring undergraduate, will
increasingly serve as the research
library of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences.
