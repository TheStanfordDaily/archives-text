(Editor's Note: The following
presentation was made to the
Board ol' Trustees at their De

Clifford Grobstein, Executive
Head of the Department of Bio
logical Sciences. Due to the

will be presented in several

1. FERMENT IN BIOLOGY
In the popular image biology is
the study of plants and animals,
particularly their variety, habits
and evolution. In fact, the study
of plants and animals for them
selves is now a minor part of biol
ogy — and evolution is only one,
albeit a major one, of a number
of important problems under in
vestigation. The current popular
image of biology actually stems
from its major activities of the
late nineteenth century rather
than of the present. Even by the
time of Stanford's beginnings
these activities already were
changing, although this was not
then yet obvious. During the first
half of the twentieth century ma
jor attention shifted from the di
versity of organisms to the nature
of organisms themselves, and par
ticularly to their constituent cells.
If the emphasis cf this period
were to be characterized in one
word, it would be "physiology."
In the past two decades new
shifts have been occurring. The
glamour of physiology has passed
to biochemistry, genetics and bio
engineering. The biology of today
is not a new science, but it is a
transformed one. The biologist of
today might even go unrecognized
by his colleagues of fifty years
ago. Some biologists at work in
their laboratories nowadays are
hard to distinguish from mathe
maticians or physicists, others
from chemists or psychologists.
The scope of biology ranges from
virus to society, and its concepts
and instruments range from those
appropriate to the molecule to
those appropriate to the study of
complex behavior. With these
changes and widened scope have
come new techniques and new
attitudes, and new requirements
have been placed on facilities, in
strumentation and training.
2. THE C ENTRAL STATUS OF
BIOLOGY IN HUMAN
KNOWLEDGE
Today we equate science with
verifiable knowledge. Knowledge
ranges from the infinitely small
particles of the nuclear physicist,
to the seemingly infinitely large
galaxies and supergalaxies of the
astronomer. In this dimensional
range biology occupies a middle,
and hence central, position. It is
central, too, in the levels of com
plexity of matter. Physics deals
particularly with particles and
energy, chemistry with atoms and
molecules. Biology begins with
molecules and ranges, through
organisms, to the interactions of
organisms with each other and
with what we call the biosphere
—the thin shell of the earth which
life inhabits. Physics and chemis
try underlie biology and biology
underlies the sciences of man and
his organizations — the social
sciences. Biology is thus central
among the sciences, affording a
bridge between the materialistic
reference of the physical sciences
and the humanistic reference of
the medical and social sciences. If
science and the humanities con
stitute two cultures, then biology
stands with its foot in one and its

head in the other. If the concept
of two cultures can be rejected,
it is because there are individuals
and disciplines which have alli
ance with both the sciences and
the humanities. Biology, which
reaches up from its consideration
of the simplest organisms and
seeks to apply its knowledge to
the most complex—human beings
functioning in human cultures—
is in its very nature a discipline
which bridges between the values
and aspirations of the students
of the physical and the cultural.
This becomes increasingly clear
as society faces the impact of
advancing physical knowledge
and technology on its own struc
ture and operations. More and
more, we are aware that social
considerations require un
derstanding of the biological ef
fects of advancing technology.
We are less aware that biology, in
its own advance, is raising social
problems and opportunities that
we are only now beginning to
discern.
In all of these ways biology is
central to the life of the univer
sity, and to the training of its
students. For the latter biology
is central in yet another way, and
this certainly not least of all in
importance. The subject matter
of biology is central in the educa
tional process because the sub
ject is, in part, the student him
self.
3. IMPLICATIONS FOR
STANFORD
Both the changes in biology and
its central status are reflected in
it history at Stanford. The focus
and interest of biology in the late
nineteenth century was expressed
architecturally in Jordan Hall.
This distinguished and tradition
laden building was conceived to
permit the very latest kind of
biological investigation of the
nineteenth century. Its huge cen
tral rotunda and surrounding
balconies are said to have been
designed to allow installation of
massive reconstructions of pre
historic animals. The building has
remained the home of biology
ever since — though with passing
years it decreasingly has met the
requirements of the newer biol
ogy. In recent years it has become
an anachronism, symbolized by
the fact that much of the research
activities of its inhabitants go on
not in the building itself, but be
neath it, among the foundations
and footings.
Though physically deprived and
confined, Stanford biology reacted
intellectually and administratively
to the changing times. During the
thirties, a School of Biological
Sciences was established and cur
ricula were revised to give expres
sion to the newer interests in cells
and organismal physiology. Stan
ford was among the first to recog
nize the need to weld botany,
zoology an d other taxonomic
groupings into a single adminis
trative structure — a need which
now is widely recognized. None
theless, as biology expanded in its
personnel and increased in its
specialization, the School was dis
sociated by new lines of cleavage.
What emerged was a single De
partment of Biological Sciences
within the School of Humanities
and Sciences, and various special
ized Departments in ot her
Schools, particularly the Medical
School. For example, biochem
istry, anatomy, genetics, physiol
ogy are now each a separate ad
ministrative unit.

virus to society, and its concepts
and instruments range from those
appropriate to the molecule to
those appropriate to the study of

2. THE C ENTRAL STATUS OF
BIOLOGY IN HUMAN
KNOWLEDGE
Today we equate science with
verifiable knowledge. Knowledge
ranges from the infinitely small
particles of the nuclear physicist,
to the seemingly infinitely large
galaxies and supergalaxies of the
astronomer. In this dimensional
range biology occupies a middle,
and hence central, position. It is
central, too, in the levels of com
plexity of matter. Physics deals
particularly with particles and
energy, chemistry with atoms and
molecules. Biology begins with
molecules and ranges, through
organisms, to the interactions of
organisms with each other and
with what we call the biosphere
—the thin shell of the earth which
life inhabits. Physics and chemis
try underlie biology and biology
underlies the sciences of man and
his organizations — the social
sciences. Biology is thus central
among the sciences, affording a
bridge between the materialistic
reference of the physical sciences
and the humanistic reference of
the medical and social sciences. If
science and the humanities con
stitute two cultures, then biology
stands with its foot in one and its

head in the other. If the concept
of two cultures can be rejected,
it is because there are individuals
and disciplines which have alli
ance with both the sciences and
the humanities. Biology, which
reaches up from its consideration
of the simplest organisms and
seeks to apply its knowledge to
the most complex—human beings
functioning in human cultures—
is in its very nature a discipline
which bridges between the values
and aspirations of the students
of the physical and the cultural.
This becomes increasingly clear
as society faces the impact of
advancing physical knowledge
and technology on its own struc
ture and operations. More and
more, we are aware that social
considerations require un
derstanding of the biological ef
fects of advancing technology.
We are less aware that biology, in
its own advance, is raising social
problems and opportunities that
we are only now beginning to
discern.
In all of these ways biology is
central to the life of the univer
sity, and to the training of its
students. For the latter biology
is central in yet another way, and
this certainly not least of all in
importance. The subject matter
of biology is central in the educa
tional process because the sub
ject is, in part, the student him
self.
3. IMPLICATIONS FOR
STANFORD
Both the changes in biology and
its central status are reflected in
it history at Stanford. The focus
and interest of biology in the late
nineteenth century was expressed
architecturally in Jordan Hall.
This distinguished and tradition
laden building was conceived to
permit the very latest kind of
biological investigation of the
nineteenth century. Its huge cen
tral rotunda and surrounding
balconies are said to have been
designed to allow installation of
massive reconstructions of pre
historic animals. The building has
remained the home of biology
ever since — though with passing
years it decreasingly has met the
requirements of the newer biol
ogy. In recent years it has become
an anachronism, symbolized by
the fact that much of the research
activities of its inhabitants go on
not in the building itself, but be
neath it, among the foundations
and footings.
Though physically deprived and
confined, Stanford biology reacted
intellectually and administratively
to the changing times. During the
thirties, a School of Biological
Sciences was established and cur
ricula were revised to give expres
sion to the newer interests in cells
and organismal physiology. Stan
ford was among the first to recog
nize the need to weld botany,
zoology an d other taxonomic
groupings into a single adminis
trative structure — a need which
now is widely recognized. None
theless, as biology expanded in its
personnel and increased in its
specialization, the School was dis
sociated by new lines of cleavage.
What emerged was a single De
partment of Biological Sciences
within the School of Humanities
and Sciences, and various special
ized Departments in ot her
Schools, particularly the Medical
School. For example, biochem
istry, anatomy, genetics, physiol
ogy are now each a separate ad
ministrative unit.

presentation was made to the

1. FERMENT IN BIOLOGY
In the popular image biology is
the study of plants and animals,
particularly their variety, habits
and evolution. In fact, the study
of plants and animals for them
selves is now a minor part of biol
ogy — and evolution is only one,
albeit a major one, of a number
of important problems under in
vestigation. The current popular
image of biology actually stems
from its major activities of the
late nineteenth century rather
than of the present. Even by the
time of Stanford's beginnings
these activities already were
changing, although this was not
then yet obvious. During the first
half of the twentieth century ma
jor attention shifted from the di
versity of organisms to the nature
of organisms themselves, and par
ticularly to their constituent cells.
If the emphasis cf this period
were to be characterized in one
word, it would be "physiology."
In the past two decades new
shifts have been occurring. The
glamour of physiology has passed
to biochemistry, genetics and bio
engineering. The biology of today
is not a new science, but it is a
transformed one. The biologist of
today might even go unrecognized
by his colleagues of fifty years
ago. Some biologists at work in
their laboratories nowadays are
hard to distinguish from mathe
maticians or physicists, others
from chemists or psychologists.

functioning in human cultures—
is in its very nature a discipline
which bridges between the values
and aspirations of the students
of the physical and the cultural.
This becomes increasingly clear
as society faces the impact of
advancing physical knowledge
and technology on its own struc
ture and operations. More and
more, we are aware that social
considerations require un
derstanding of the biological ef
fects of advancing technology.
We are less aware that biology, in
its own advance, is raising social
problems and opportunities that
we are only now beginning to
discern.
In all of these ways biology is
central to the life of the univer
sity, and to the training of its
students. For the latter biology
is central in yet another way, and
this certainly not least of all in
importance. The subject matter
of biology is central in the educa
tional process because the sub
ject is, in part, the student him
self.
3. IMPLICATIONS FOR
STANFORD
Both the changes in biology and
its central status are reflected in
it history at Stanford. The focus
and interest of biology in the late
nineteenth century was expressed
architecturally in Jordan Hall.
This distinguished and tradition
laden building was conceived to
permit the very latest kind of
biological investigation of the
nineteenth century. Its huge cen
tral rotunda and surrounding
balconies are said to have been
designed to allow installation of
massive reconstructions of pre
historic animals. The building has
remained the home of biology
ever since — though with passing
years it decreasingly has met the
requirements of the newer biol
ogy. In recent years it has become
an anachronism, symbolized by
the fact that much of the research
activities of its inhabitants go on
not in the building itself, but be
neath it, among the foundations
and footings.
Though physically deprived and
confined, Stanford biology reacted
intellectually and administratively
to the changing times. During the
thirties, a School of Biological
Sciences was established and cur
ricula were revised to give expres
sion to the newer interests in cells
and organismal physiology. Stan
ford was among the first to recog
nize the need to weld botany,
zoology an d other taxonomic
groupings into a single adminis
trative structure — a need which
now is widely recognized. None
theless, as biology expanded in its
personnel and increased in its
specialization, the School was dis
sociated by new lines of cleavage.
What emerged was a single De
partment of Biological Sciences
within the School of Humanities
and Sciences, and various special
ized Departments in ot her
Schools, particularly the Medical
School. For example, biochem
istry, anatomy, genetics, physiol
ogy are now each a separate ad
ministrative unit.

presentation was made to the

1. FERMENT IN BIOLOGY
In the popular image biology is
the study of plants and animals,
particularly their variety, habits
and evolution. In fact, the study
of plants and animals for them
selves is now a minor part of biol
ogy — and evolution is only one,
albeit a major one, of a number
of important problems under in
vestigation. The current popular
image of biology actually stems
from its major activities of the
late nineteenth century rather
than of the present. Even by the
time of Stanford's beginnings
these activities already were
changing, although this was not
then yet obvious. During the first
half of the twentieth century ma
jor attention shifted from the di
versity of organisms to the nature
of organisms themselves, and par
ticularly to their constituent cells.
If the emphasis cf this period
were to be characterized in one
word, it would be "physiology."
In the past two decades new
shifts have been occurring. The
glamour of physiology has passed
to biochemistry, genetics and bio
engineering. The biology of today
is not a new science, but it is a
transformed one. The biologist of
today might even go unrecognized
by his colleagues of fifty years
ago. Some biologists at work in
their laboratories nowadays are
hard to distinguish from mathe
maticians or physicists, others
from chemists or psychologists.
The scope of biology ranges from
virus to society, and its concepts
and instruments range from those
appropriate to the molecule to
those appropriate to the study of
complex behavior. With these
changes and widened scope have
come new techniques and new
attitudes, and new requirements
have been placed on facilities, in
strumentation and training.
2. THE C ENTRAL STATUS OF
BIOLOGY IN HUMAN
KNOWLEDGE
Today we equate science with
verifiable knowledge. Knowledge
ranges from the infinitely small
particles of the nuclear physicist,
to the seemingly infinitely large
galaxies and supergalaxies of the
astronomer. In this dimensional
range biology occupies a middle,
and hence central, position. It is
central, too, in the levels of com
plexity of matter. Physics deals
particularly with particles and
energy, chemistry with atoms and
molecules. Biology begins with
molecules and ranges, through
organisms, to the interactions of
organisms with each other and
with what we call the biosphere
—the thin shell of the earth which
life inhabits. Physics and chemis
try underlie biology and biology
underlies the sciences of man and
his organizations — the social
sciences. Biology is thus central
among the sciences, affording a
bridge between the materialistic
reference of the physical sciences
and the humanistic reference of
the medical and social sciences. If
science and the humanities con
stitute two cultures, then biology
stands with its foot in one and its

head in the other. If the concept
of two cultures can be rejected,
it is because there are individuals
and disciplines which have alli
ance with both the sciences and
the humanities. Biology, which
reaches up from its consideration
of the simplest organisms and
seeks to apply its knowledge to
the most complex—human beings
functioning in human cultures—
is in its very nature a discipline
which bridges between the values
and aspirations of the students
of the physical and the cultural.
This becomes increasingly clear
as society faces the impact of
advancing physical knowledge
and technology on its own struc
