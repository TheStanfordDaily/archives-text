# HOT LINE TO THE SIDELINE
## Supporting a Few Is Just Not Enough 
### TOM ELIAS 
Stanford people, sports fans in particular, have a habit of going
bark to Iheir homes all over tbo world, and bragging about the
wonderful coaching staff we have here. The funny thing is that
these same people are the very ones who slay away from sports
events in droves.
This is not to say that Stanford Stadium does not have a sub
stantial student contingent in evidence at each home football game,
or that our famed old campus landmark, the Pavilion, is not filled
to overflowing at all home games. It only means that the cross
country team, coached by the best track mentor in the world, Pay
ton Jordan, and boasting at least two of the top twenty harriers in
college today in Weym Kirkland and Harry McCalla runs before a
gallery of about twenty people mostly the runners' parents and
girl friends.
It means that the national championship water polo team has
to depend on a rather mediocre football team to support it. It means
that a swimming team with at least two Ail-Americans and maybe
a few more has to perform before a half-filled grandstand.
It means that the wrestling team has a part-time coach, doing
a job normally done by a full-time well-paid man. It means that a
rugby team coached by Pete Kmetovic one of the best players ever
in the U.S., has 1o go begging for spectators, even when a new
grandstand and P.A. system has been set up.
SMALL TEAMS NEED MONEY
Lack of attendance at these so-called minor sports would not be
such a crying shame if most of the teams weren't so good. Rut they
are good, and the few that are not could be if they could get the
money they need to hire the type of coaches the other sports have.
Men like Jordan, Howie Dallmar and John Ralston are among the
best in their fields, and they must be paid commensurately. Jim
Gaughran is also one of the best, as is Kmetovic, but their status
doesn't approximate that of the better known coaches.
Stanford people also talk about getting a new Pavilion, so top
teams from all over the country can be enticed to play on the Farm.
But since so few people attend matches and games in minor sports,
much oi the money that could be used to start a building fund has
to be given to the support of those minor sports.
Sympathy is no reason for any sports fan to watch his team in
action. That may be good enough for Mets' fans but not for Stanford
people. The reason we should support all our teams is that they are
not deserving of sympathy- they're to good to feel sorry for.
POLOISTS BEST IN NATION
Take the water polo team for example. This squad drew a capa
city crowd just twice this season as it finished 21-2, beating oppo
nents by such margins as 32 to 2 and 2fi to 7. While winning them
selves a national championship, the only one at Stanford in some
years in any sport, such poloists as goalie George Stransky, defense
man Don Buehler, and forwards Marty Hull and Pete Pettigrew were
named All-Americans. Sympathy is no motivation for watching them
— but an interest in seeing the very best team in the country should
be.
Other sports like lacrosse, volleyball and crew, some of which
don't have a coach or even official sponsorship by the Athletic De
partment, are hurting even worse from the sorry lack of support.
The list could go on and on with sports that need support, and rea
sons for supporting them.
The main one, though, is that Stanford people are hurting them
selves if they don't turn out to see some of the best athletes in the
country, if not the world, compete. They're hurting themselves also,
in that the lack of coaching in some sports, brought on by lack of sup
port, causes the whole University to make a poor impression on
those who do come out and on their opponents.
Sure, we support our competitors in the major sports, because
football and basketball are name sports which seem to have much
more appeal than Stanford's other sports. But the only way to make
ihe "minor" sports solvent and to guarantee uniform excellence on
a par with that in the rest of the university is to support everyone,
to make certain no representative of Stanford University lacks sup
port .

Sure, we support our competitors in the major sports, because
football and basketball are name sports which seem to have much
more appeal than Stanford's other sports. But the only way to make
ihe "minor" sports solvent and to guarantee uniform excellence on

to make certain no representative of Stanford University lacks sup

Stanford people, sports fans in particular, have a habit of going
bark to Iheir homes all over tbo world, and bragging about the
wonderful coaching staff we have here. The funny thing is that
these same people are the very ones who slay away from sports
events in droves.
This is not to say that Stanford Stadium does not have a sub
stantial student contingent in evidence at each home football game,
or that our famed old campus landmark, the Pavilion, is not filled
to overflowing at all home games. It only means that the cross
country team, coached by the best track mentor in the world, Pay
ton Jordan, and boasting at least two of the top twenty harriers in
college today in Weym Kirkland and Harry McCalla runs before a
gallery of about twenty people mostly the runners' parents and
girl friends.
It means that the national championship water polo team has
to depend on a rather mediocre football team to support it. It means
that a swimming team with at least two Ail-Americans and maybe
a few more has to perform before a half-filled grandstand.
It means that the wrestling team has a part-time coach, doing
a job normally done by a full-time well-paid man. It means that a
rugby team coached by Pete Kmetovic one of the best players ever
in the U.S., has 1o go begging for spectators, even when a new
grandstand and P.A. system has been set up.
SMALL TEAMS NEED MONEY
Lack of attendance at these so-called minor sports would not be
such a crying shame if most of the teams weren't so good. Rut they
are good, and the few that are not could be if they could get the
money they need to hire the type of coaches the other sports have.
Men like Jordan, Howie Dallmar and John Ralston are among the
best in their fields, and they must be paid commensurately. Jim
Gaughran is also one of the best, as is Kmetovic, but their status
doesn't approximate that of the better known coaches.
Stanford people also talk about getting a new Pavilion, so top
teams from all over the country can be enticed to play on the Farm.
But since so few people attend matches and games in minor sports,
much oi the money that could be used to start a building fund has
to be given to the support of those minor sports.
Sympathy is no reason for any sports fan to watch his team in
action. That may be good enough for Mets' fans but not for Stanford
people. The reason we should support all our teams is that they are
not deserving of sympathy- they're to good to feel sorry for.
POLOISTS BEST IN NATION
Take the water polo team for example. This squad drew a capa
city crowd just twice this season as it finished 21-2, beating oppo
nents by such margins as 32 to 2 and 2fi to 7. While winning them
selves a national championship, the only one at Stanford in some
years in any sport, such poloists as goalie George Stransky, defense
man Don Buehler, and forwards Marty Hull and Pete Pettigrew were
named All-Americans. Sympathy is no motivation for watching them
— but an interest in seeing the very best team in the country should
be.
Other sports like lacrosse, volleyball and crew, some of which
don't have a coach or even official sponsorship by the Athletic De
partment, are hurting even worse from the sorry lack of support.
The list could go on and on with sports that need support, and rea
sons for supporting them.
The main one, though, is that Stanford people are hurting them
selves if they don't turn out to see some of the best athletes in the
