# Rugby Out to Defend Coast Supremacy
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
.With many key holdovers from
the Stanford rugby team which
reigned supreme on the Coast last
year with a 13-1 record, Coach
Pete Kmetovic expects ihe team
to fare equally well this cam
paign. Stanford this year plays a
sixteen game schedule, the open
er this Saturday at 1:30 against
the Olympic Club.
The eligibility requirements for
rugby are only that a player is
an amateur and he enrolled at
Stanford either as on under
graduate or a graduate student.
Most of the players are graduate
students but undergraduates, in
cluding freshmen, help make up
the 85 players out for rugby:

I Kmetovic approves of this ar
rangement because an all under
graduate team would not have Ihe
experience to play a good game of
rugby.
Star player and last year's scor
ing leader with 25 points is
Gordon Waddell, a second year
student in the Business School
who is one of the best rugby
players in ihe world. From Scot
land, he captained Cambridge and
has played for the Scottish In
ternational team. He plays in the
backfield at first 5/8, and is not
only a good runner but a good
lateral passer and kicker. Slightly
injured, he may he on the side
lines for the first game but def
initely will return to action soon

after that.
Joining Waddell on the injured
list are Dick Ragsdale and Glenn
Myers. Ragsdale Kmetovic con
siders the finest fullback on the
coast hut he is presently recover
ing from an operation as is Myers
who lettered last season as a
freshman.
The varsity squad will contain
20 members, 15 starters and five
reserves. Stanford's strong scrum
includes Ron Fraboni, a Dart
mouth graduate; Randy Vahan;
Tom Fortmann; Dick Leeuven
berg; and Jon Brandon.
Rob Price, with four rugby let
ters at Stanford already to his
credit, leads the backfield attack
along with Waddell. Clark Weav
er, Hank Mac Queen, Steve Van
North Dick Shaw, F*hil Neal, and
Brad Freeman are other capable
backfield players.
Tim Hansel, Frank Patitucci,
Bob Burke, and Dave Moreland
will be employed in the break
away slots. Hansel will play full
back until Ragsdale returns to
the lineup.
If a weakness exists, it is a
lack of a consistent kicker. As
a penalty kick counts as much as
a try (three points), an accurate
kicker is essential to Stanford's
success. Jon Brandon and Bob
Burke are two possibilities.

rangement because an all under
graduate team would not have Ihe
experience to play a good game of
rugby.
Star player and last year's scor
ing leader with 25 points is
Gordon Waddell, a second year
student in the Business School
who is one of the best rugby
players in ihe world. From Scot
land, he captained Cambridge and
has played for the Scottish In
ternational team. He plays in the
backfield at first 5/8, and is not
only a good runner but a good
lateral passer and kicker. Slightly
injured, he may he on the side
lines for the first game but def
initely will return to action soon

after that.
Joining Waddell on the injured
list are Dick Ragsdale and Glenn
Myers. Ragsdale Kmetovic con
siders the finest fullback on the
coast hut he is presently recover
ing from an operation as is Myers
who lettered last season as a
freshman.
The varsity squad will contain
20 members, 15 starters and five
reserves. Stanford's strong scrum
includes Ron Fraboni, a Dart
mouth graduate; Randy Vahan;
Tom Fortmann; Dick Leeuven
berg; and Jon Brandon.
Rob Price, with four rugby let
ters at Stanford already to his
credit, leads the backfield attack
along with Waddell. Clark Weav
er, Hank Mac Queen, Steve Van
North Dick Shaw, F*hil Neal, and
Brad Freeman are other capable
backfield players.
Tim Hansel, Frank Patitucci,
Bob Burke, and Dave Moreland
will be employed in the break
away slots. Hansel will play full
back until Ragsdale returns to
the lineup.
If a weakness exists, it is a
lack of a consistent kicker. As
a penalty kick counts as much as
a try (three points), an accurate
kicker is essential to Stanford's
success. Jon Brandon and Bob
Burke are two possibilities.
.With many key holdovers from
the Stanford rugby team which
reigned supreme on the Coast last
year with a 13-1 record, Coach
Pete Kmetovic expects ihe team
to fare equally well this cam
paign. Stanford this year plays a
sixteen game schedule, the open
er this Saturday at 1:30 against
the Olympic Club.
The eligibility requirements for
rugby are only that a player is
an amateur and he enrolled at
Stanford either as on under
graduate or a graduate student.
Most of the players are graduate
students but undergraduates, in
cluding freshmen, help make up
the 85 players out for rugby:
