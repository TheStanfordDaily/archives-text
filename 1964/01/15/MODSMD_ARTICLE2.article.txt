# Students Petition To Maintain Sibley
## 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN 
A petition supporting "the right
of Professor Mulford Sibley . . .
to hold and express his personal
political views without endanger
ing his position as a member of
the faculty" is being circulated
at the University of Minnesota,
where Sibley teaches, by the Min
nesota Student Association Sen
ate, the Minnesota Daily reported.
Sibley, a political science pro
fessor and a Quaker pacifist and
socialist, was a visiting professor
at Stanford in 19.18. His nomina
tion by the political science de
partment for a permanent ap
pointment was refused. The nomi
nation was stopped at the pro
vost's office.
Stanford student supporters of
Sibley also circulated a petition
in his behalf and met with Presi
dent Wallace Sterling, seeking to
know why Sibley, called a "fabu
lous" teacher by a Stanford pro
fessor and one of the most popu
lar professors among students,
was not appointed. They charged
at the time that his controversial
political beliefs were the cause
of the university's refusal. The
university denied the validity of
any such charges.
Some Minnesota student legis
lators opposed the petition in fa
vor of a more scholarly statement
on academic freedom. Phil Raup
Jr., originator of the petition,
stated that the issue was "not
scholarly, hut political," and that
there is a move to have Sibley
fired.
