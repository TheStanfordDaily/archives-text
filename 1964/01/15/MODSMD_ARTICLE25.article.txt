# Library Flash: It's Front Door Only
## 
### 
The University Library office
has closed the rear entrance to
the Library for approximately
three weeks to allow the contrac
tor to complete the new stairs
and entranceway. A sketch of the
project has been posted on the
staff room bulletin board.
During the construction period,
staff and students will be able
to enter the building only through
the front doors. The mail room
will be available as a fire exit.
