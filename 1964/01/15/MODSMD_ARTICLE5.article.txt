# Dr. Teller Talks on NATO; Offers Solution to Problems
## 
### PERRY ANDERSON 
Speaking, as he said, not as a
scientist but as a citizen, Dr. Ed
ward Teller, the noted physicist,
commented on the problems pro
ducing tensions between the na
tions of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and offered a gen
eral solution to these problems.
At a talk in the Muir Lounge at
Stern, Dr. Teller described the de
velopment of the unity between
European nations, a unity re
flected by the success of the Com
mon Market, as a miracle. Yet this
very miracle, Ihe uniting of Ger
man and French efforts, is, he
said, threatening NATO.
AMERICANS WERE cautioned,
however, against blaming the ten-
Gaulle alone. "We must," he de-

I dared, "Listen to what De Gaulle
is saying not because he's right,
but because he's partly right, not
because we're wrong, but because
we're partly wrong."
Above all, he stated, Americans
must realize that there are two
sides to the difficult question fac
ing both de Gaulle and the United
States. De Gaulle demands the
right to test nuclear weapons from
fear that the United States, to
save itself, might be willing to
give Europe to the Communists.
But Teller believes that there is
at least one solution to the prob
lems facing the security of
Free World. Such a solution, he
believes, might result from a more
compact alliance of Western na
tions which might be described as
a "loose federal union of advanced
democracies."
SUCH A UNION, though it
would not destroy the identity of
each member nation, would yet
allow greater cooperation between
democracies on problems of de
fense.
Through close cooperation and
unified testing of nuclear weap
ons. Teller believes, an efficient
defense might be developed even
against long-range missiles. Nor
could such defensive weapons be
used to trigger an offensive war,
were they properly designed, as
they could be.
"In my opinion a federal union
of democracies will be a stepping
stone to combating everything, at
the one end, and at the other end
to providing peace." Such a union
would give to its members, Teller
feels, not only increased strength,
but a broader point of view in
solving the problems of its mem
bers.
DR. TI'iLLKK, however, stated
that he did not know the precise
means by which such a union
could be formed. That such action
is necessary he cannot doubt. "We
must find the best solutions at the
moment, within our limited
means." Such a union appears to
Teller to be the solution required
' by the problems of this moment.

AMERICANS WERE cautioned,
however, against blaming the ten-
Gaulle alone. "We must," he de-

I dared, "Listen to what De Gaulle
is saying not because he's right,
but because he's partly right, not
because we're wrong, but because
we're partly wrong."
Above all, he stated, Americans
must realize that there are two
sides to the difficult question fac
ing both de Gaulle and the United
States. De Gaulle demands the
right to test nuclear weapons from
fear that the United States, to
save itself, might be willing to
give Europe to the Communists.
But Teller believes that there is
at least one solution to the prob
lems facing the security of
Free World. Such a solution, he
believes, might result from a more
compact alliance of Western na
tions which might be described as
a "loose federal union of advanced
democracies."
SUCH A UNION, though it
would not destroy the identity of
each member nation, would yet
allow greater cooperation between
democracies on problems of de
fense.
Through close cooperation and
unified testing of nuclear weap
ons. Teller believes, an efficient
defense might be developed even
against long-range missiles. Nor
could such defensive weapons be
used to trigger an offensive war,
were they properly designed, as
they could be.
"In my opinion a federal union
of democracies will be a stepping
stone to combating everything, at
the one end, and at the other end
to providing peace." Such a union
would give to its members, Teller
feels, not only increased strength,
but a broader point of view in
solving the problems of its mem
bers.
DR. TI'iLLKK, however, stated
that he did not know the precise
means by which such a union
could be formed. That such action
is necessary he cannot doubt. "We
must find the best solutions at the
moment, within our limited
means." Such a union appears to
Teller to be the solution required
' by the problems of this moment.
Speaking, as he said, not as a
scientist but as a citizen, Dr. Ed
ward Teller, the noted physicist,
commented on the problems pro
ducing tensions between the na
tions of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and offered a gen
eral solution to these problems.
At a talk in the Muir Lounge at
Stern, Dr. Teller described the de
velopment of the unity between
European nations, a unity re
flected by the success of the Com
mon Market, as a miracle. Yet this
very miracle, Ihe uniting of Ger
man and French efforts, is, he
said, threatening NATO.
