racy." A closed reception for members only will be held by the
Stanford Young Democrats at 3:15 in Tresidder's large lounge pre
ceding the Governor's speech.
Governor Brown will explain the translating of ideas into action

in a free society with an emphasis
on t he joint responsibility of a free
government and the individual
citizen to see that these actions
will be taken.
THE GOVERNOR'S political
career is indicative of tihs respon
sibility. In his first term as gov
ernor, Brown implemented the
California Water Development
System which had been ten years
in planning but was blocked by
North - South legislative rivalries.
He effected a compromise which
placed a Ivi billion dollar bond
issue before the voters in 1960
which after extensive campaign
ing was carried by 150,000 votes.
Other major programs initiated
in Brown's first term include a
Fair Employment Practices Com
mission to insure equal work op
portunity for all Californians, the
Office of Consumer Counsel was
created to inhibit unethical prac
tices among small groups of busi
nessmen, and a Coordinating
Council for Higher Education was
appointed to eliminate waste and
duplication among the state's
mushrooming institutions of high
er learning.
In 1962, Bl own defeated former
Vice President Richard M. Nixon
in one of the most intense guber
natorial campaigns in the state's
history. By 1963 the elements of
Brown's program enacted included
the Hum ford Fair Housing Act
which prohibits discrimination in
most private and publically assist
ed housing, a Mental Retardation
Commission to study problems of
mental health and a one-million
dollar program to assist them in
the education of retarded children,
increased consumer protection
laws, and increased social welfare
legislation.
AFTER RECEIVING a degree
in 1927, earned by attending night
school at the San Francisco Col
lege of Law, Brown's first success
ful political venture was in 1943
when he was elected District At
torney of San Francisco. He in
herited a city replete with war
time problems of massive troop
movements, festering juvenile de
linquency, racial tension, and sub
standard housing racketeers.
He appointed the first Negro to
serve as assistant district attorney
in San Francisco and encouraged
citizen groups to work at ways to
relieve interracial tensions; he or
ganized a juvenile crime preven
tion program including summer
camps for underprivileged boys
and widely distributed literature;
he pressed enforcement of laws
against gambling, graft, family
desertion, abortion and other
crimes; and he strove to expedite
trials and achieve speedier justice.
In 1950, he was elected attorney
general of California, the only
Democrat to win a statewide office
that year. Serving the next eight
years as head of one of the big
gest and most active law offices in
the United States, he continued his
fight against crime, established
closer cooperation among local
law officials, and generally im
proved law enforcement standards
throughout the state through,
stringent enforcement and vigor- j
ous investigation.
GOVERNOR BROWN is widely

â–º
traveled including a 1955 visit to
Israel in an exchange public serv
ant program, a 1954 venture to
Latin America for the Inter-Amcr
ican Congress of Public Law Ad
ministrators, and other trips to
Europe and the Caribbean.
Governor Brown's youngest
daughter, Kathy, is a freshman at
Stanford.
