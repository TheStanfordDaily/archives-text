# Johnson Calls for New Youth Corps
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS)â€”Presi
dent Johnson last week renewed
support for one of the late Presi
dent Kennedy's pet projects to
create a volunteer youth corps
aimed at helping that part of the
nation "on the outskirts of hope."
In his State of the Union mes
sage, the Texan cracked the whip
for the second session of the 88th
Congress in declaring "here and
now, an unconditional war on
poverty."
JOHNSON said: "We must
create a National Service Corps
to help the economically handi
capped of our own country as the
Peace Corps now helps those
abroad."
The National Service Corps
(NSC), which last year won the
strong support of the U.S. Na
tional Student Association
(USNSA), was formulated in
Kennedy's New Frontier but may
become a reality under the shrewd
guidance of the new President.
As proposed by the late presi
dent, the Corps would enlist men
and women 18 and older for terms
of one year to work with patients
in hospitals and mental institu-
I tions, as well as Indians, migrant
! laborers and other deprived
; groups.
CORPSMEN woidd start work
j only at the request of state and
| local officials. They would get up
to $75 a month at the end of their
enlistments.
The Senate pased a stripped
down version of the bill last Aug
ust, imposing a ceiling of $5 mil
lion the first year and $10 million
j the second year. It would limit
; the corps to 2,000 volunteers in
j stead of Ihe 5,000 proposed by the
; Administration.
Even in its modified form, the
bill barely squeaked through the
: more liberally-inclined Senate by
| a 47-44 vote, with only three Re
publicans voting for it.
