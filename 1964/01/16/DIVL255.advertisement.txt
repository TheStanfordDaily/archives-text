CREATION:
BY GOD OR BY CHANCE?
"In the beginning Clod created the heaven ami the earth." (Jen. I.I.
'"And Christ Himself is the Creator Who made «. \er>thiin heaven and earth,
tin things we eaii see and the things we can't; the spirit world with it> kings and
kingdoms, its rulers and authorities: all were made by Christ for I lis own use and
glory. He was before all else began, and it is His power that holds everything to
gether." Col. 1:1 o-17, LL.
The Word of God begins with a declaration of the existence of Cod. the I icator
who brought the "universe into being out of nothingness (the Hebrew word tor
"create" implies that Cod did not mold the worlds out of primordial clay or out of a
part of Himself).
The liible docs not say when the universe was created nor does it say how. I he
"when" and "how" are matters of scientific speculation. Scientific knowledge is sub
ject to constant revision and change, and many such changes have been made in
recent years concerning man's picture of cosmology. L'ntil recently, there were two
main opposing theories of creation: the "big-bang" hypothesis of the Abbe Lcinaitre
and Ccorge Caniow. and the theory of "continuous creation" advanced by lloylc.
Uondi. and Child, This latter theory siigge-ts that there never was a beginning. How
ever. it is now falling out of favor because very recent radio star data anil rocket
probe measurements support the- theory of a definite' beginning sonic billions of years
ago.
In 1929 llubhh and Humasoit discovered that spectral light Irom distant galaxies
was shifted towards the red. This "red shift" seems to indicate that the galaxies arc
receding from one another at velocities which approach the velocity of light at the
outermost limits of the universe. Such evidence points towards the origin of the
universe in tin- explosion of a "primeval atom." Scientists theorize that in the be
ginning' all the stars, tile interstellar dust, and the interconnecting electromagnetic
energy may have been contained within a very small space. It i- staggering to the
imagination to realize that a billion nebulae ovei a distance- of billions oi light year?
may. at emc time, have 1 been compressed into one small ball. I treatise- scientists love
to make calculations, they can reconstruct what the early history of such a primeval
atom might have been like- as it began its outward expansion. When stub a universe
was one' second old, it may have been 186,000 miles in diameter and 15 billion
degrees K; at one- year it may have been .> million degrees K and aftei a million
years, o thousand degrees K. "Heaven" only knows how hot it was at earlier times,
or how small the primeval atom was "in the- beginning." While it i- mathematically
possible for tlie- universe- tei have originated in a point source' <ir to have had a pre
vious history before t = 0, the physical interpretation of eternity past and the in
finitely small i- an impossible task.
Albert Einstein established the- equivalence of mass and ncrgy. His lanieius E — mc2
e xpre sses tin- relationship he discovered between mas-, energy, and the velocity of
light. This elisceivcry made- the- thermonuclear bomb possible-, anel le-el scientists to
study the physics of high temperature thermonuclear re-actions where' ma-s can be
converted into energy. This new physics was then applied to the study eif the' hypo
thetical. expanding, primeval atom. It can be' shown that at the- high temperatures
which must have existed in the prime val atom, solid matter could not exist. All
matter would be entirely converted into energy: powerful x rays, radio waves, light,
and radiation. Or, if you prefer, the universe may have begun with one gigantic burst
of light!
In this connection, we ne>t< that the Geispel ed John make - re t' tciice to Je-us ( hrist
as the "Light of the' World." The brilliance- of the hypothetical primeval atom sug
gests the splendor of Jlis presence shining iutei the darkin s of the void which "com
prehended it not"!
The elaborate and elojueiit. "big hang" theory of the origin ol the' universe' does not
in any way disagree with the Biblical picture of creation. However, we must remem
ber that all of man's theories of the origin of the unive-i e are speculative;.
Unbelievers may prefer to think that this remarkable universe and it- miiaculous
origin came into being by "chance ' rather than by the hand ot an almighty C reator.
How such perfect order, and later, how conscious, rational man could come about
"by chance" makes a very farfetched story, especially when compared to the- clear
re velations of the reality of God given tei man in the Holy Scriptures and in the
l'erson of the Lord Jesus Christ. An acceptance of Cod ( icator leads not only
to a reverence and respect for the magnitieclit intelligence behind creation, but to
a much more logical and reasonable picture of "reality !
Even more marvelous is the knowledge which Christians have that thi- Coel of
creation is interested in individuals and niters into thru live - m a personal way.
God in Christ sulVered anel died for maiikiuel in onle i that we might spend an etern
ity with lliiu. This Christ of the Crots and Ced ot Creation can be known personally
by anyone!
Many scientists know Jcsiis Christ on a pel .otial basi and with other Chii-tian- can
reverently say:
''Holy. holy, holy, is < ■< >el the sove-i e-iguing Lord of all. who was anel i- to conic
. . . 'l'liou are worthy, <> Lord our Cud. to rece ive glory and honor anil power, be'
cause tholl didst create all things, by thy will they were created, anel have their being.'
Re v. 4:8, 11.
Have ye>u met the Holy God of Creation. Volt eaii ii you'll claim .le.-iis t hrist as
your pcrsenial Lord and Saviour.
