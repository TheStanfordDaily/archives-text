# McAfee Brown Urges Adjustment to Pluralistic Culture

### JIM HORNE (Sixth in a series) 
While the non-sectarian aspects of the University's
Founding Grant may have been meaningful in the pre
dominantly Protestant culture of the late nineteenth cen
tury, "a new manner of approach is called for today,"
according to Dr. Robert McAfee Brown, Professof of Reli
gion and one of America's most distinguished theologians.
In Jane Stanford's era, "an American was regarded as
a Pi'otestant, and members of other religions were regarded
as deviating from ihe norm," said. Brown in a Daily inter
view this week. "We now live in a pluralistic culture with
Catholicism, Judaism, and Mohammedism representing real
options for Americans. This fact should be reflected within
the University community," said Brown.
In regard to the obstacle presented by the Founding
Grant and its amendments, which said the University was
"to prohibit sectarian instruction" and "be forever main
tained upon a strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian basis,"
Brown explained that "like all documents today, it must
be subjected iti increasing interpretation."
The importance lies "not in what Mrs. Stanford envis
aged for the 1890'5," said the theologian, "but an applica
tion of her intentions in the realities of the twentieth cen
tury." While recognizing the great number of religions
existing in this age, Brown suggests that "we should avoid
sectarianism by allowing all groups the opportunity for
expression. Other religions are not to be just tolerated if
the University is going to minister to the culture. If the
University is to have concern for the religious life of its

students il must not do it .solely on Protestant terms."
Although an early amendment to the Founding Grant
directed that "no ground shall ever be leased for a board
ing house, school, or residence of any sort which shall be
held for the benefit of any religious sect or denomination,"
Brown believes that Memorial Church is, in fact, violating
this principle. "The Church is now being used for the ad
vantage of one sect- Protestantism," said the Professor of
Religion.
Brown asserts that campus facilities should be avail
able to the various religious groups, which, by a March,
1963 Board of Trustee's decision, are prohibited from either
holding classes or engaging in worship on campus. "We
should not have academic freedom at the University for
the discussion and investigation of all areas except reli
gion," said Brown. "Students should have the right to be
exposed to all creeds, and while such opportunity is pro
vided in academic courses, students should be able to ex
plore these areas on their own in other than a classroom
situation."
"Ways must be found," stated Brown, "to permit groups
to engage in corporate worship on campus. Worship must
not be restricted to just one small segment of the campus
community."
Brown gave examples in which opportunities for other
religions might be provided, including a Friday night serv
ice in Memorial Church for Jews and a Mass on Sunday
morning delivered by a Catholic chaplain. "We must reach
out to recognize the wider needs of the other religious
groups on campus," said Brown.

As a member of the faculty, Brown's principal concerns
rest with the religious studies curriculum. He specializes
in contemporary Christian theology and ethics.
The University is attempting to expand its religious
studies program, explains Brown, and "right now we are
trying to bring to the University instructors in both Catho
licism and Judaism, and after that possibly other world
religions. "Our first job, of course, is to do justice to the
heritage of Western man and provide for Jewish and Catho
lic instruction."
"Of course," he explained, "I could lecture about Catho
licism, but I could iiot give the feeling of the religion that
a Catholic can."
Brown recalled the appearance of Rabbi Heschcl on cam
pus last spring as one who made this point clear with
reference to Judaism. "His one lecture," explained Dr.
Brown, "was a more powerful communication of the basic
Jewish tenets than I could have given in five lectures. It
is certainly no betrayal to academic freedom to have these
various religions taught by men committed to the faith."
In regard to the Berry Grant which will provide nearly
$55,000 each year for "student, religious activities," Brown
suggested several ways in which the money might be used
to good advantage.
His suggestions included:
• A substantial increase in the holdings of the Vestry
Library in the Memorial Church building.
• A "student exchange program" in which the "hori
zons (if the students might be enlarged." As an example,
proposed Dr. Brown, we could exchange several students

with a Southern Negro university. In this way we would
be exposing ourselves to unfamiliar cultural patterns and
would be able to become more sensitive to the plight of
follow men."
• Aiding poverty-stricken citizens in East Palo Alto.
"A number of local churches are beginning to cooperate
in meeting the needs of these human beings, and some
money could be used in that and similar situations."
• Summer work projects in Europe with the coopera
tion of the various church groups.
• Inviting distinguished theologians to speak on cam
pus. "The grant would permit us to enrich the students
through exposure to many great religious thinkers," said
Brown. "Nearly any important religious figure could be
brought to campus, whether through the guest-in-residenee
program or for an individual speech or lecture series. I
would avoid, however, the tendency to rely strictly on this
forum approach. We must use these speakers and guests
to prime our spiritual pump and then balance it with our
own campus spiritual life."
• Increased emphasis on religion in the graduate pro
gram, "which is not being touched by our limited sources
of manpower."
• Additional personnel on the staff of Memorial
Church. "We have need for more than a chaplain and an
assistant chaplain. For example, a chaplain for the medi
cal school, especially one concerned with medical ethics,
would be a valuable addition. There are some very fright
ening moral decisions faced by doctors and these could be
explained by a person with special training."
