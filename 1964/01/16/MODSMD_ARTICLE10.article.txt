# Activism, Civil Rights Top Governor’s Demands Here
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
With a presentation that revealed not a brilliant orator but a
straightforward and dedicated man of politics, Governor Edmond
Brown addressed a Memorial Auditorium audience yesterday on the
commitment to action in a democracy.
The Governor's expectations from the student and the citizen

were made clear by his response-*
to concrete examples: enthusiasm
for Stanford students' participa
tion in CORE, NAACP, tutoring
programs, the Mississippi Mock
Election; indignation at the "cur
rent effort to sabotage the Fair
Housing Law; commitment to
the political process which he
characterized by the prospective
Stanford memorial to President
Kennedy providing funds for stu
dent activity in politics.
THE GOVERNOR'S statements
on civil rights were strong, clear,
and not confined to condemnation
of other regions of the country:
"In the South, denial of the Ne
gro's rights is backed up by open
and often brutal force— clubs,
guns, dogs and the law. Elsewhere
in the nation, the challenge of
the m in or i t y ' s constitutional
rights is more furtive than sav
age, but its impact is no less real.
The three largest Negro ghettos
in the nation arc in the north, not
the south."
Brown lashed out at the Cali
fornia Real Estate Association in
illustrating his statement, "...
we have not solved the problem i
even in a state which we like to j
call enlightened." The proposed j
initiative to remove the Califor
nia Fair Housing Law meets "em
phatic" opposition from Brown
who stated that the law has not
yet been given a fair trial and is j
a "humane and just law which j
. . . does not put anyone's prop-1
erty rights in jeopardy. It places
no other restriction upon owners
in the disposal or use of property
than a restraint against discrimi
nation."
The Governor approached five !
general points education, equal-!
ity under the law, poverty, elimi- j
nation of bigotry, and broad poli-!
tical participation and turned !
them into a forthright statement ,
of a liberal's creed:
• Brown sees the university as ,
"the center of independent criti-1
cism and thought," not existing'
merely to meet "the immediate
needs of a country, or by getting
for it gold and glory."
The Governor sees a need for j
education in quantity, and showed :
a readiness to meet criticism on
taxes and bond issues squarely.
"Our system has become a |
model," noted Brown, "because j
we believe that every Califorian -
is entitled not to as much educa
tion as he wants, but rather to as J
much education as he can assimi- j
late and put to good purpose." i
• The California leader's oppo-'
sition to the initiative against the
Fair Housing law was repeated I
on several different planes. Be- j
yond his defense of the content
of the Law, Brown feels the initia- !
five on the ballot "will generate a j
public debate which will divide j
our people, not unify us. . . . will j
increase personal bitterness and j
hate, rather than understanding !
and cooperation."
• New programs of social wel- i
fare and further opportunities for j
California unemployed through
opposition to the continued im
jit > 11 it it 'U oi i\ii 11 in ii it ion 11

form the basis of the Governor's
attack on poverty.
Brown also emphasized the com
mitment of California to the in
ternational problem of poverty
through our co-operative program
with Chile. Despite his forceful
statement during the question
and-answer session that no one
"campaigns" for the vice-presi
dency, the Governor's emphasis of
his international experience a n d
travel within his duties as state
chief proves convenient for a man
being considered for national
office.
• In his attack on "bigotry and
rigidity of thought" Brown indi
cated that he does not consider
Barry Goldwater an example of
an extremist, "but both the leader
and his supporters should not be
tempted by political expediency
to appeal to the extremists in
their party."
THE GOVERNOR warmed lo
the task of fielding pointed ques
tions from the audience by toss
ing back pointed replies. He de
fended California's policy of giv
ing birth control information to
those who request it and not tak
ing a more "aggressive" approach
to what he regards as an individ
ual moral question. He analyzed
Assemblyman Phillip Burton
questioned as an "extremist"
as a man whose forcefulness often
proves "repugnant" to his fellow
legislators, but a man with a thor
ough knowledge of social welfare
and a "solid" legislator.
In reply to a query on Senator
Engel's plans for the coming elec
tion, Brown expressed approval
of the state Democratic leader
ship's request for a medical re
port of the ailing Senator's condi
tion. Brown stated that at his
most recent visit to Engcl, "he
spoke rather haltingly, but
whether or not he'll improve is
something only the doctors
know."

than a restraint against discrimi
nation."
The Governor approached five !
general points education, equal-!
ity under the law, poverty, elimi- j
nation of bigotry, and broad poli-!
tical participation and turned !
them into a forthright statement ,
of a liberal's creed:
• Brown sees the university as ,
"the center of independent criti-1
cism and thought," not existing'
merely to meet "the immediate
needs of a country, or by getting
for it gold and glory."
The Governor sees a need for j
education in quantity, and showed :
a readiness to meet criticism on
taxes and bond issues squarely.
"Our system has become a |
model," noted Brown, "because j
we believe that every Califorian -
is entitled not to as much educa
tion as he wants, but rather to as J
much education as he can assimi- j
late and put to good purpose." i
• The California leader's oppo-'
sition to the initiative against the
Fair Housing law was repeated I
on several different planes. Be- j
yond his defense of the content
of the Law, Brown feels the initia- !
five on the ballot "will generate a j
public debate which will divide j
our people, not unify us. . . . will j
increase personal bitterness and j
hate, rather than understanding !
and cooperation."
• New programs of social wel- i
fare and further opportunities for j
California unemployed through
opposition to the continued im
jit > 11 it it 'U oi i\ii 11 in ii it ion 11

form the basis of the Governor's
attack on poverty.
Brown also emphasized the com
mitment of California to the in
ternational problem of poverty
through our co-operative program
with Chile. Despite his forceful
statement during the question
and-answer session that no one
"campaigns" for the vice-presi
dency, the Governor's emphasis of
his international experience a n d
travel within his duties as state
chief proves convenient for a man
being considered for national
office.
• In his attack on "bigotry and
rigidity of thought" Brown indi
cated that he does not consider
Barry Goldwater an example of
an extremist, "but both the leader
and his supporters should not be
tempted by political expediency
to appeal to the extremists in
their party."
THE GOVERNOR warmed lo
the task of fielding pointed ques
tions from the audience by toss
ing back pointed replies. He de
fended California's policy of giv
ing birth control information to
those who request it and not tak
ing a more "aggressive" approach
to what he regards as an individ
ual moral question. He analyzed
Assemblyman Phillip Burton
questioned as an "extremist"
as a man whose forcefulness often
proves "repugnant" to his fellow
legislators, but a man with a thor
ough knowledge of social welfare
and a "solid" legislator.
In reply to a query on Senator
Engel's plans for the coming elec
tion, Brown expressed approval
of the state Democratic leader
ship's request for a medical re
port of the ailing Senator's condi
tion. Brown stated that at his
most recent visit to Engcl, "he
spoke rather haltingly, but
whether or not he'll improve is
something only the doctors
know."
With a presentation that revealed not a brilliant orator but a
straightforward and dedicated man of politics, Governor Edmond
Brown addressed a Memorial Auditorium audience yesterday on the
commitment to action in a democracy.
The Governor's expectations from the student and the citizen

were made clear by his response-*
to concrete examples: enthusiasm
for Stanford students' participa
tion in CORE, NAACP, tutoring
programs, the Mississippi Mock
Election; indignation at the "cur
rent effort to sabotage the Fair
Housing Law; commitment to
the political process which he
characterized by the prospective
Stanford memorial to President
Kennedy providing funds for stu
dent activity in politics.
THE GOVERNOR'S statements
on civil rights were strong, clear,
and not confined to condemnation
of other regions of the country:
"In the South, denial of the Ne
gro's rights is backed up by open
and often brutal force— clubs,
guns, dogs and the law. Elsewhere
in the nation, the challenge of
the m in or i t y ' s constitutional
rights is more furtive than sav
age, but its impact is no less real.
The three largest Negro ghettos
in the nation arc in the north, not
the south."
Brown lashed out at the Cali
fornia Real Estate Association in
illustrating his statement, "...
we have not solved the problem i
even in a state which we like to j
call enlightened." The proposed j
initiative to remove the Califor
nia Fair Housing Law meets "em
phatic" opposition from Brown
who stated that the law has not
yet been given a fair trial and is j
a "humane and just law which j
. . . does not put anyone's prop-1
erty rights in jeopardy. It places
no other restriction upon owners
in the disposal or use of property

ternational problem of poverty
through our co-operative program
with Chile. Despite his forceful
statement during the question
and-answer session that no one
"campaigns" for the vice-presi
dency, the Governor's emphasis of
his international experience a n d
travel within his duties as state
chief proves convenient for a man
being considered for national
office.
• In his attack on "bigotry and
rigidity of thought" Brown indi
cated that he does not consider
Barry Goldwater an example of
an extremist, "but both the leader
and his supporters should not be
tempted by political expediency
to appeal to the extremists in
their party."
THE GOVERNOR warmed lo
the task of fielding pointed ques
tions from the audience by toss
ing back pointed replies. He de
fended California's policy of giv
ing birth control information to
those who request it and not tak
ing a more "aggressive" approach
to what he regards as an individ
ual moral question. He analyzed
Assemblyman Phillip Burton
questioned as an "extremist"
as a man whose forcefulness often
proves "repugnant" to his fellow
legislators, but a man with a thor
ough knowledge of social welfare
and a "solid" legislator.
In reply to a query on Senator
Engel's plans for the coming elec
tion, Brown expressed approval
of the state Democratic leader
ship's request for a medical re
port of the ailing Senator's condi
tion. Brown stated that at his
most recent visit to Engcl, "he
spoke rather haltingly, but
whether or not he'll improve is
something only the doctors
know."
With a presentation that revealed not a brilliant orator but a
straightforward and dedicated man of politics, Governor Edmond
Brown addressed a Memorial Auditorium audience yesterday on the
commitment to action in a democracy.
The Governor's expectations from the student and the citizen

were made clear by his response-*
to concrete examples: enthusiasm
for Stanford students' participa
tion in CORE, NAACP, tutoring
programs, the Mississippi Mock
Election; indignation at the "cur
rent effort to sabotage the Fair
Housing Law; commitment to
the political process which he
characterized by the prospective
Stanford memorial to President
Kennedy providing funds for stu
dent activity in politics.
THE GOVERNOR'S statements
on civil rights were strong, clear,
and not confined to condemnation
of other regions of the country:
"In the South, denial of the Ne
gro's rights is backed up by open
and often brutal force— clubs,
guns, dogs and the law. Elsewhere
in the nation, the challenge of
the m in or i t y ' s constitutional
rights is more furtive than sav
age, but its impact is no less real.
The three largest Negro ghettos
in the nation arc in the north, not
the south."
Brown lashed out at the Cali
fornia Real Estate Association in
illustrating his statement, "...
we have not solved the problem i
even in a state which we like to j
call enlightened." The proposed j
initiative to remove the Califor
nia Fair Housing Law meets "em
phatic" opposition from Brown
who stated that the law has not
yet been given a fair trial and is j
a "humane and just law which j
. . . does not put anyone's prop-1
erty rights in jeopardy. It places
no other restriction upon owners
in the disposal or use of property
than a restraint against discrimi
nation."
The Governor approached five !
general points education, equal-!
ity under the law, poverty, elimi- j
nation of bigotry, and broad poli-!
tical participation and turned !
them into a forthright statement ,
of a liberal's creed:
• Brown sees the university as ,
"the center of independent criti-1
cism and thought," not existing'
merely to meet "the immediate
needs of a country, or by getting
for it gold and glory."
The Governor sees a need for j
education in quantity, and showed :
a readiness to meet criticism on
taxes and bond issues squarely.
"Our system has become a |
model," noted Brown, "because j
we believe that every Califorian -
is entitled not to as much educa
tion as he wants, but rather to as J
much education as he can assimi- j
late and put to good purpose." i
• The California leader's oppo-'
sition to the initiative against the
Fair Housing law was repeated I
on several different planes. Be- j
yond his defense of the content
of the Law, Brown feels the initia- !
five on the ballot "will generate a j
public debate which will divide j
our people, not unify us. . . . will j
increase personal bitterness and j
hate, rather than understanding !
and cooperation."
• New programs of social wel- i
fare and further opportunities for j
California unemployed through
opposition to the continued im
jit > 11 it it 'U oi i\ii 11 in ii it ion 11

form the basis of the Governor's
attack on poverty.
