The biological community at
Stanford thus is much larger than
the Biology Department, and the
Department must bo thought of
in relation to this larger commu
nity. This situation reflects a
strong central discipline, while
at the same time giving scope
for growth and development of
the specialized parts. If the en
lire biological community at Stan
ford were organized into a single
department it would be so large
as to be administratively un
wieldy. On the other hand, if the
several departments operated
completely without interaction
and integration there clearly
would be no central discipline at
all. In this situation it seems es
sential that the Biology Depart
ment should have as one of its
functions the provision of a center
of gravity — by maintaining a
continuing concern with the over
all discipline of biology. This fol
lows of course — if it did not in
other ways —■ from the nearly
exclusive responsibility of the
Department for undergraduate
education in biology, both for gen
eral studies and for majors. Re
gardless of their special objective,
students must meet biology
through the Department.
Aware of this, the Department
in the last couple of years has
been giving particular thought to
its curriculum. I would like to
spend just a few moments on our
new undergraduate curriculum
for majors, because it illustrates
both the difficulties and the chal
lenge of teaching biology during
this period of rapid flux. I may
say that, nationally, growing con
cern over how best to convey the
new orientation of biology to stu
dents is indicated by the recent
establishment of a Commission
for Undergraduate Education in
the Biological Sciences—on which
two of our faculty members serve.
Even as the Commission was get
ting organized Stanford already
had launched a new curriculum,
which is attracting interest as a
possible model for other institu
tions. Because we are a unified
Department, encompassing all of
biology, we have been able to
move more promptly and effec
tively than some other institu
tions where biology is cleaved
into several administrative units
without centrai integration.
This past quarter over 100 Stan
ford undergraduates were intro
duced to biology by a new course
—the first of a sequence of six—
which included a series of 40 lec
tures ranging from the origin of
life to the role of intelligence in

guiding human evolution. In be
tween, they saw life dissected con
ceptually from populations down
to molecules. They traced the
aggregation of living organization
from hereditary material to poly
organisms. They heard lecturers
of specialized competence in bio
chemistry, genetics, neurophysi
ology, embryology, systematics
and evolution. Among the lect
turers, incidentally, were Stan
ford's two Nobel prize winners in
biology.
These students, having been
shown the forest of biological
phenomena, will begin their more
concentrated and detailed study
in the new year. Winter quarter
will be spent on plants as organ
isms, spring quarter on animals
as organisms. Next fall most will
enroll in the Department's new
course in molecular biology. Hav
ing by then completed a year of
training in chemistry, they will be
ready to look at life as the bio
chemist and biophysicist see it.
The following quarter they will
examine cells in depth, particu
larly their dynamic and functional
aspects. Then, the following
spring they will be found in an
other new course, population biol
ogy, where their attention will be
focused on organisms in aggre
gates — behaving, interacting,
adapting, evolving as life has for
countless generations to people
the earth and now to reach out
beyond.
This, in brief, is the Depart
ment's new core curiculum, de
signed to give to the student the
common knowledge and tech
niques which underlie the multi
plicity of specialized biological
phenomena. All biologists need to
know the significance of major
macromolecular types, of mole
cular and cellular replication, of
the parts of cells. All need to
understand the general features
of living organization, of develop
ment, of living aggregates. The
revolution of biological teaching
which now is beginning, stems
from the revolution of biological
thinking which has occurred and
is continuing. The reoriented
teaching will place the general be
fore the detail, it will emphasize
the rule and provide only the best
example. This can be done now
and could not be done a quarter
century ago, because biology has
achieved new generalizations —
and will continue to . This is its
great fascination and challenge
today.
The concentration points in our
Department stem partly from
tradition, and partly from the new
biology. First, systematics and
evolution have been strong at
Stanford since David Starr Jor
dan. Their modern version is
population biology, with its com
bination of field and statistical
approaches, its implications for
human population problems, and
its affinity with the social
sciences. We are fortunate in hav

ing forceful representatives of the
field in the Department, and our
plans are to supplement them
further. When progress can be
based on tradition, the happy op
portunity should be seized.
Second, the unprecedently fer
tile fusion of biochemistry and
genetics began in the basement
catacombs of Jordan Hall, and
the product continues to grow and
expand as one of the major break
throughs of twentieth-century
science. Having rationalized
heredity, the productive wave is
lapping at the enigma of develop
ment. Here, biochemistry, genet
ics, cell physiology and embryol
ogy are co-mingled. Here, too, the
Department has acknowledged
leaders, and through their judi
cial supplementation can fur
ther strengthen an already im
pressive concentration.
Third, a new concentration
point is neded — in the rapidly
advancing area of molecular bi
ology which has been under-rep
resented in the Department in the
past. The relationship of biologi
cal structure at its several levels
—anatomical, histological, mole
cular — is one of the pregnant
issues of the future. The structure
and shape of large biological
molecules clearly is a key to this,
and the field is only barely open
ing. As a physical problem in
volving biological objectives, and
hence needing biological orienta
tion, this area is sometimes re
ferred to as biophysics. However
labelled, it gives all the adminis
trative problems — and high po
tential yield — of all transitional
zones between two major disci
plines. By anchoring the mole
cular biology wing of the Depart
ment in this area, to balance
population biology at the oppo
site end, coverage of the full ga
mut of biology will be assured.
In addition to its teaching and
research responsibilities the De
partment has played, and must
continue to play, another role in
the University. It must administer
such general biological programs
and facilities as cut across usual
departmental lines, and hence are
not suitably located in a more
s p e c ia 1 i z e d department. Bio
physics already has been men
tioned and is a good example. An
other is the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion. Providing almost unique ac
cess to the marine environment,
the Station affords opportunity to
investigators and students in a
number of areas, both within Biol
ogy and in some of the specialized
departments. The availability of
the Hopkins Marine Station is
one of the major strengths of
Stanford biology, both in teaching
and research. Last spring quarter
the two functions were combined,
when 25 undergraduates spent 10
weeks studying the ecology, bio
chemistry, physiology, develop
ment and behavior of a marine
snail. The project was so success
ful that what students and staff
jointly learned will be published
as part of the scientific literature.
This is scientific education at its
best — and there are few institu

tions so fortunately endowed as
to provide it!
4. THE ESSENTIAL NEED
I have been attempting to
sketch, briefly what Stanford biol
ogy is and what its future pattern
might be. The central conception
is of a core department broadly
responsible for its discipline, and
interacting with and integrating
administratively other units in
specialized areas. Sine qua non is
a vigorous, central Department—
and fundamental to this are ade
quate physical facilities. Provi
sion of these has been too long
delayed. The new core curriculum
for majors, for example, cannot
be really properly given until wo
are in a new building. Beginning
of construction of the new Biol
ogy Center, appropriately placed
in one axis between Physics and
Chemistry, and the other axis be
tween the Medical School and the
Behavioral Sciences Center and
Mathematics, will symbolize the
central importance of biology
within the sciences and within the
University. The first two pro
jected units will allow most of
the existing Department on the
campus to be relocated in mod
ern facilities. This is a minimum
step to release the Department
from confinement and to allow it
to think constructively of the fu
ture. We must keep in mind that
though the Stanford biological
community is a distinguished one,
it is still incomplete in a number
of ways. It requires, for example,
fortification in biophysics, in ani
mal behavior, and in developmen
tal biology — the latter increas
ingly recognized on a national
scale as a high-priority area for
the immediate future. Additional
appointments are needed in these
areas, some of them in Biology,
some in specialized departments.
Wherever they are to be made
administratively, they will require
new physical facilities which meet
elevated modern standards. This
must be taken into account in
planning the Biology Center, since
it would seem most advantageous
to group specialized facilities
around the home of the Biology
Department as core. A develop
mental biology, or population
biology laboratory, for example,
might house research facilities
for a number of investigators
having common interest in these
areas — while allowing them to
participate academically in the
Biology Department or in one of
the specialized departments ap
propriate to their primary disci
pline. It is not too early to be
thinking in these terms. The Stan
ford biological community—like
the University generally—already
is outstanding. It will take only a
little more drive and commitment
to make it second to none in the
world. We have reached a point
in the history of Stanford biology
at which we cannot stand still.
We either find the wherewithal
to go forward—or we will slip
back. Given this choice I have
little doubt what the decision will
be.

in the history of Stanford biology
at which we cannot stand still.
We either find the wherewithal

be.

The biological community at
Stanford thus is much larger than
the Biology Department, and the
Department must bo thought of
in relation to this larger commu
nity. This situation reflects a
strong central discipline, while
at the same time giving scope
for growth and development of
the specialized parts. If the en
lire biological community at Stan
ford were organized into a single
department it would be so large
as to be administratively un
wieldy. On the other hand, if the
several departments operated
completely without interaction
and integration there clearly
would be no central discipline at
all. In this situation it seems es
sential that the Biology Depart
ment should have as one of its
functions the provision of a center
of gravity — by maintaining a
continuing concern with the over
all discipline of biology. This fol
lows of course — if it did not in
other ways —■ from the nearly
exclusive responsibility of the
Department for undergraduate
education in biology, both for gen
eral studies and for majors. Re
gardless of their special objective,
students must meet biology
through the Department.
Aware of this, the Department
in the last couple of years has
been giving particular thought to
its curriculum. I would like to
spend just a few moments on our
new undergraduate curriculum
for majors, because it illustrates
both the difficulties and the chal
lenge of teaching biology during
this period of rapid flux. I may
say that, nationally, growing con
cern over how best to convey the
new orientation of biology to stu
dents is indicated by the recent
establishment of a Commission
for Undergraduate Education in
the Biological Sciences—on which
two of our faculty members serve.
Even as the Commission was get
ting organized Stanford already
had launched a new curriculum,
which is attracting interest as a
possible model for other institu
tions. Because we are a unified
Department, encompassing all of
biology, we have been able to
move more promptly and effec
tively than some other institu
tions where biology is cleaved
into several administrative units
without centrai integration.
This past quarter over 100 Stan
ford undergraduates were intro
duced to biology by a new course
—the first of a sequence of six—
which included a series of 40 lec
tures ranging from the origin of
life to the role of intelligence in

guiding human evolution. In be
tween, they saw life dissected con
ceptually from populations down
to molecules. They traced the
aggregation of living organization
from hereditary material to poly
organisms. They heard lecturers
of specialized competence in bio
chemistry, genetics, neurophysi
ology, embryology, systematics
and evolution. Among the lect
turers, incidentally, were Stan
ford's two Nobel prize winners in
biology.
These students, having been
shown the forest of biological
phenomena, will begin their more
concentrated and detailed study
in the new year. Winter quarter
will be spent on plants as organ
isms, spring quarter on animals
as organisms. Next fall most will
enroll in the Department's new
course in molecular biology. Hav
ing by then completed a year of
training in chemistry, they will be
ready to look at life as the bio
chemist and biophysicist see it.
The following quarter they will
examine cells in depth, particu
larly their dynamic and functional
aspects. Then, the following
spring they will be found in an
other new course, population biol
ogy, where their attention will be
focused on organisms in aggre
gates — behaving, interacting,
adapting, evolving as life has for
countless generations to people
the earth and now to reach out
beyond.
This, in brief, is the Depart
ment's new core curiculum, de
signed to give to the student the
common knowledge and tech
niques which underlie the multi
plicity of specialized biological
phenomena. All biologists need to
know the significance of major
macromolecular types, of mole
cular and cellular replication, of
the parts of cells. All need to
understand the general features
of living organization, of develop
ment, of living aggregates. The
revolution of biological teaching
which now is beginning, stems
from the revolution of biological
thinking which has occurred and
is continuing. The reoriented
teaching will place the general be
fore the detail, it will emphasize
the rule and provide only the best
example. This can be done now
and could not be done a quarter
century ago, because biology has
achieved new generalizations —
and will continue to . This is its
great fascination and challenge
today.
The concentration points in our
Department stem partly from
tradition, and partly from the new
biology. First, systematics and
evolution have been strong at
Stanford since David Starr Jor
dan. Their modern version is
population biology, with its com
bination of field and statistical
approaches, its implications for
human population problems, and
its affinity with the social
sciences. We are fortunate in hav

ing forceful representatives of the
field in the Department, and our
plans are to supplement them
further. When progress can be
based on tradition, the happy op
portunity should be seized.
Second, the unprecedently fer
tile fusion of biochemistry and
genetics began in the basement
catacombs of Jordan Hall, and
the product continues to grow and
expand as one of the major break
throughs of twentieth-century
science. Having rationalized
heredity, the productive wave is
lapping at the enigma of develop
ment. Here, biochemistry, genet
ics, cell physiology and embryol
ogy are co-mingled. Here, too, the
Department has acknowledged
leaders, and through their judi
cial supplementation can fur
ther strengthen an already im
pressive concentration.
Third, a new concentration
point is neded — in the rapidly
advancing area of molecular bi
ology which has been under-rep
resented in the Department in the
past. The relationship of biologi
cal structure at its several levels
—anatomical, histological, mole
cular — is one of the pregnant
issues of the future. The structure
and shape of large biological
molecules clearly is a key to this,
and the field is only barely open
ing. As a physical problem in
volving biological objectives, and
hence needing biological orienta
tion, this area is sometimes re
ferred to as biophysics. However
labelled, it gives all the adminis
trative problems — and high po
tential yield — of all transitional
zones between two major disci
plines. By anchoring the mole
cular biology wing of the Depart
ment in this area, to balance
population biology at the oppo
site end, coverage of the full ga
mut of biology will be assured.
In addition to its teaching and
research responsibilities the De
partment has played, and must
continue to play, another role in
the University. It must administer
such general biological programs
and facilities as cut across usual
departmental lines, and hence are
not suitably located in a more
s p e c ia 1 i z e d department. Bio
physics already has been men
tioned and is a good example. An
other is the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion. Providing almost unique ac
cess to the marine environment,
the Station affords opportunity to
investigators and students in a
number of areas, both within Biol
ogy and in some of the specialized
departments. The availability of
the Hopkins Marine Station is
one of the major strengths of
Stanford biology, both in teaching
and research. Last spring quarter
the two functions were combined,
when 25 undergraduates spent 10
weeks studying the ecology, bio
chemistry, physiology, develop
ment and behavior of a marine
snail. The project was so success
ful that what students and staff
jointly learned will be published
as part of the scientific literature.
This is scientific education at its
best — and there are few institu

tions so fortunately endowed as
to provide it!
4. THE ESSENTIAL NEED
I have been attempting to
sketch, briefly what Stanford biol
ogy is and what its future pattern
might be. The central conception
is of a core department broadly
responsible for its discipline, and
interacting with and integrating
administratively other units in
specialized areas. Sine qua non is
a vigorous, central Department—
and fundamental to this are ade
quate physical facilities. Provi
sion of these has been too long
delayed. The new core curriculum
for majors, for example, cannot
be really properly given until wo
are in a new building. Beginning
of construction of the new Biol
ogy Center, appropriately placed
in one axis between Physics and
Chemistry, and the other axis be
tween the Medical School and the
Behavioral Sciences Center and
Mathematics, will symbolize the
central importance of biology
within the sciences and within the
University. The first two pro
jected units will allow most of
the existing Department on the
campus to be relocated in mod
ern facilities. This is a minimum
step to release the Department
from confinement and to allow it
to think constructively of the fu
ture. We must keep in mind that
though the Stanford biological
community is a distinguished one,
it is still incomplete in a number
of ways. It requires, for example,
fortification in biophysics, in ani
mal behavior, and in developmen
tal biology — the latter increas
ingly recognized on a national
scale as a high-priority area for
the immediate future. Additional
appointments are needed in these
areas, some of them in Biology,
some in specialized departments.
Wherever they are to be made
administratively, they will require
new physical facilities which meet
elevated modern standards. This
must be taken into account in
planning the Biology Center, since
it would seem most advantageous
to group specialized facilities
around the home of the Biology
Department as core. A develop
mental biology, or population
biology laboratory, for example,
might house research facilities
for a number of investigators
having common interest in these
areas — while allowing them to
participate academically in the
Biology Department or in one of
the specialized departments ap
propriate to their primary disci
pline. It is not too early to be
thinking in these terms. The Stan
ford biological community—like
the University generally—already
is outstanding. It will take only a
little more drive and commitment
to make it second to none in the
world. We have reached a point
in the history of Stanford biology
at which we cannot stand still.
We either find the wherewithal
to go forward—or we will slip
back. Given this choice I have
little doubt what the decision will
be.

ford biological community—like
the University generally—already
is outstanding. It will take only a
little more drive and commitment
to make it second to none in the
world. We have reached a point
in the history of Stanford biology
at which we cannot stand still.
We either find the wherewithal
to go forward—or we will slip
back. Given this choice I have
little doubt what the decision will
be.

The biological community at
Stanford thus is much larger than
the Biology Department, and the
Department must bo thought of
in relation to this larger commu
nity. This situation reflects a
strong central discipline, while
at the same time giving scope
for growth and development of
the specialized parts. If the en
lire biological community at Stan
ford were organized into a single
department it would be so large
as to be administratively un
wieldy. On the other hand, if the
several departments operated
completely without interaction
and integration there clearly
would be no central discipline at
all. In this situation it seems es
sential that the Biology Depart
ment should have as one of its
functions the provision of a center
of gravity — by maintaining a
continuing concern with the over
all discipline of biology. This fol
lows of course — if it did not in
other ways —■ from the nearly
exclusive responsibility of the
Department for undergraduate
education in biology, both for gen
eral studies and for majors. Re
gardless of their special objective,
students must meet biology
through the Department.
Aware of this, the Department
in the last couple of years has
been giving particular thought to
its curriculum. I would like to
spend just a few moments on our
new undergraduate curriculum
for majors, because it illustrates
both the difficulties and the chal
lenge of teaching biology during
this period of rapid flux. I may
say that, nationally, growing con
cern over how best to convey the
new orientation of biology to stu
dents is indicated by the recent
establishment of a Commission
for Undergraduate Education in
the Biological Sciences—on which
two of our faculty members serve.
Even as the Commission was get
ting organized Stanford already
had launched a new curriculum,
which is attracting interest as a
possible model for other institu
tions. Because we are a unified
Department, encompassing all of
biology, we have been able to
move more promptly and effec
tively than some other institu
tions where biology is cleaved
into several administrative units
without centrai integration.
This past quarter over 100 Stan
ford undergraduates were intro
duced to biology by a new course
—the first of a sequence of six—
which included a series of 40 lec
tures ranging from the origin of
life to the role of intelligence in

guiding human evolution. In be
tween, they saw life dissected con
ceptually from populations down
to molecules. They traced the
aggregation of living organization
from hereditary material to poly
organisms. They heard lecturers
of specialized competence in bio
chemistry, genetics, neurophysi
ology, embryology, systematics
and evolution. Among the lect
turers, incidentally, were Stan
ford's two Nobel prize winners in
biology.
These students, having been
shown the forest of biological
phenomena, will begin their more
concentrated and detailed study
in the new year. Winter quarter
will be spent on plants as organ
isms, spring quarter on animals
as organisms. Next fall most will
enroll in the Department's new
course in molecular biology. Hav
ing by then completed a year of
training in chemistry, they will be
ready to look at life as the bio
chemist and biophysicist see it.
The following quarter they will
examine cells in depth, particu
larly their dynamic and functional
aspects. Then, the following
spring they will be found in an
other new course, population biol
ogy, where their attention will be
focused on organisms in aggre
gates — behaving, interacting,
adapting, evolving as life has for
countless generations to people
the earth and now to reach out
beyond.
This, in brief, is the Depart
ment's new core curiculum, de
signed to give to the student the
common knowledge and tech
niques which underlie the multi
plicity of specialized biological
phenomena. All biologists need to
know the significance of major
macromolecular types, of mole
cular and cellular replication, of
the parts of cells. All need to
understand the general features
of living organization, of develop
ment, of living aggregates. The
revolution of biological teaching
which now is beginning, stems
from the revolution of biological
thinking which has occurred and
is continuing. The reoriented
teaching will place the general be
fore the detail, it will emphasize
the rule and provide only the best
example. This can be done now
and could not be done a quarter
century ago, because biology has
achieved new generalizations —
and will continue to . This is its
great fascination and challenge
today.
The concentration points in our
Department stem partly from
tradition, and partly from the new
biology. First, systematics and
evolution have been strong at
Stanford since David Starr Jor
dan. Their modern version is
population biology, with its com
bination of field and statistical
approaches, its implications for
human population problems, and
its affinity with the social
sciences. We are fortunate in hav

ing forceful representatives of the
field in the Department, and our
plans are to supplement them
further. When progress can be
based on tradition, the happy op
portunity should be seized.
Second, the unprecedently fer
tile fusion of biochemistry and
genetics began in the basement
catacombs of Jordan Hall, and
the product continues to grow and
expand as one of the major break
throughs of twentieth-century
science. Having rationalized
heredity, the productive wave is
lapping at the enigma of develop
ment. Here, biochemistry, genet
ics, cell physiology and embryol
ogy are co-mingled. Here, too, the
Department has acknowledged
leaders, and through their judi
cial supplementation can fur
ther strengthen an already im
pressive concentration.
Third, a new concentration
point is neded — in the rapidly
advancing area of molecular bi
ology which has been under-rep
resented in the Department in the
past. The relationship of biologi
cal structure at its several levels
—anatomical, histological, mole
cular — is one of the pregnant
issues of the future. The structure
and shape of large biological
molecules clearly is a key to this,
and the field is only barely open
ing. As a physical problem in
volving biological objectives, and
hence needing biological orienta
tion, this area is sometimes re
ferred to as biophysics. However
labelled, it gives all the adminis
trative problems — and high po
tential yield — of all transitional
zones between two major disci
plines. By anchoring the mole
cular biology wing of the Depart
ment in this area, to balance
population biology at the oppo
site end, coverage of the full ga
mut of biology will be assured.
In addition to its teaching and
research responsibilities the De
partment has played, and must
continue to play, another role in
the University. It must administer
such general biological programs
and facilities as cut across usual
departmental lines, and hence are
not suitably located in a more
s p e c ia 1 i z e d department. Bio
physics already has been men
tioned and is a good example. An
other is the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion. Providing almost unique ac
cess to the marine environment,
the Station affords opportunity to
investigators and students in a
number of areas, both within Biol
ogy and in some of the specialized
departments. The availability of
the Hopkins Marine Station is
one of the major strengths of
Stanford biology, both in teaching
and research. Last spring quarter
the two functions were combined,
when 25 undergraduates spent 10
weeks studying the ecology, bio
chemistry, physiology, develop
ment and behavior of a marine
snail. The project was so success
ful that what students and staff
jointly learned will be published
as part of the scientific literature.
This is scientific education at its
best — and there are few institu

tions so fortunately endowed as
to provide it!
4. THE ESSENTIAL NEED
I have been attempting to
sketch, briefly what Stanford biol
ogy is and what its future pattern
might be. The central conception
is of a core department broadly
responsible for its discipline, and
interacting with and integrating
administratively other units in
specialized areas. Sine qua non is
a vigorous, central Department—
and fundamental to this are ade
quate physical facilities. Provi
sion of these has been too long
delayed. The new core curriculum
for majors, for example, cannot
be really properly given until wo
are in a new building. Beginning
of construction of the new Biol
ogy Center, appropriately placed
in one axis between Physics and
Chemistry, and the other axis be
tween the Medical School and the
Behavioral Sciences Center and
Mathematics, will symbolize the
central importance of biology
within the sciences and within the
University. The first two pro
jected units will allow most of
the existing Department on the
campus to be relocated in mod
ern facilities. This is a minimum
step to release the Department
from confinement and to allow it
to think constructively of the fu
ture. We must keep in mind that
though the Stanford biological
community is a distinguished one,
it is still incomplete in a number
of ways. It requires, for example,
fortification in biophysics, in ani
mal behavior, and in developmen
tal biology — the latter increas
ingly recognized on a national
scale as a high-priority area for
the immediate future. Additional
appointments are needed in these
areas, some of them in Biology,
some in specialized departments.
Wherever they are to be made
administratively, they will require
new physical facilities which meet
elevated modern standards. This
must be taken into account in
planning the Biology Center, since
it would seem most advantageous
to group specialized facilities
around the home of the Biology
Department as core. A develop
mental biology, or population
biology laboratory, for example,
might house research facilities
for a number of investigators
having common interest in these
areas — while allowing them to
participate academically in the
Biology Department or in one of
the specialized departments ap
propriate to their primary disci
pline. It is not too early to be
thinking in these terms. The Stan
ford biological community—like
the University generally—already
is outstanding. It will take only a
little more drive and commitment
to make it second to none in the
world. We have reached a point

areas — while allowing them to
participate academically in the
Biology Department or in one of
the specialized departments ap
propriate to their primary disci
pline. It is not too early to be
thinking in these terms. The Stan
ford biological community—like
the University generally—already
is outstanding. It will take only a
little more drive and commitment
to make it second to none in the
world. We have reached a point
in the history of Stanford biology
at which we cannot stand still.
We either find the wherewithal
to go forward—or we will slip

little doubt what the decision will

The biological community at
Stanford thus is much larger than
the Biology Department, and the
Department must bo thought of
in relation to this larger commu
nity. This situation reflects a
strong central discipline, while
at the same time giving scope
for growth and development of
the specialized parts. If the en
lire biological community at Stan
ford were organized into a single
department it would be so large
as to be administratively un
wieldy. On the other hand, if the
several departments operated
completely without interaction
and integration there clearly
would be no central discipline at
all. In this situation it seems es
sential that the Biology Depart
ment should have as one of its
functions the provision of a center
of gravity — by maintaining a
continuing concern with the over
all discipline of biology. This fol
lows of course — if it did not in
other ways —■ from the nearly
exclusive responsibility of the
Department for undergraduate
education in biology, both for gen
eral studies and for majors. Re
gardless of their special objective,
students must meet biology
through the Department.
Aware of this, the Department
in the last couple of years has
been giving particular thought to
its curriculum. I would like to
spend just a few moments on our
new undergraduate curriculum
for majors, because it illustrates
both the difficulties and the chal
lenge of teaching biology during
this period of rapid flux. I may
say that, nationally, growing con
cern over how best to convey the
new orientation of biology to stu
dents is indicated by the recent
establishment of a Commission
for Undergraduate Education in
the Biological Sciences—on which
two of our faculty members serve.
Even as the Commission was get
ting organized Stanford already
had launched a new curriculum,
which is attracting interest as a
possible model for other institu
tions. Because we are a unified
Department, encompassing all of
biology, we have been able to
move more promptly and effec
tively than some other institu
tions where biology is cleaved
into several administrative units
without centrai integration.
This past quarter over 100 Stan
ford undergraduates were intro
duced to biology by a new course
—the first of a sequence of six—
which included a series of 40 lec
tures ranging from the origin of
life to the role of intelligence in

guiding human evolution. In be
tween, they saw life dissected con
ceptually from populations down
to molecules. They traced the
aggregation of living organization
from hereditary material to poly
organisms. They heard lecturers
of specialized competence in bio
chemistry, genetics, neurophysi
ology, embryology, systematics
and evolution. Among the lect
turers, incidentally, were Stan
ford's two Nobel prize winners in
biology.
These students, having been
shown the forest of biological
phenomena, will begin their more
concentrated and detailed study
in the new year. Winter quarter
will be spent on plants as organ
isms, spring quarter on animals
as organisms. Next fall most will
enroll in the Department's new
course in molecular biology. Hav
ing by then completed a year of
training in chemistry, they will be
ready to look at life as the bio
chemist and biophysicist see it.
The following quarter they will
examine cells in depth, particu
larly their dynamic and functional
aspects. Then, the following
spring they will be found in an
other new course, population biol
ogy, where their attention will be
focused on organisms in aggre
gates — behaving, interacting,
adapting, evolving as life has for
countless generations to people
the earth and now to reach out
beyond.
This, in brief, is the Depart
ment's new core curiculum, de
signed to give to the student the
common knowledge and tech
niques which underlie the multi
plicity of specialized biological
phenomena. All biologists need to
know the significance of major
macromolecular types, of mole
cular and cellular replication, of
the parts of cells. All need to
understand the general features
of living organization, of develop
ment, of living aggregates. The
revolution of biological teaching
which now is beginning, stems
from the revolution of biological
thinking which has occurred and
is continuing. The reoriented
teaching will place the general be
fore the detail, it will emphasize
the rule and provide only the best
example. This can be done now
and could not be done a quarter
century ago, because biology has
achieved new generalizations —
and will continue to . This is its
great fascination and challenge
today.
The concentration points in our
Department stem partly from
tradition, and partly from the new
biology. First, systematics and
evolution have been strong at
Stanford since David Starr Jor
dan. Their modern version is
population biology, with its com
bination of field and statistical
approaches, its implications for
human population problems, and
its affinity with the social
sciences. We are fortunate in hav

ing forceful representatives of the
field in the Department, and our
plans are to supplement them
further. When progress can be
based on tradition, the happy op
portunity should be seized.
Second, the unprecedently fer
tile fusion of biochemistry and
genetics began in the basement
catacombs of Jordan Hall, and
the product continues to grow and
expand as one of the major break
throughs of twentieth-century
science. Having rationalized
heredity, the productive wave is
lapping at the enigma of develop
ment. Here, biochemistry, genet
ics, cell physiology and embryol
ogy are co-mingled. Here, too, the
Department has acknowledged
leaders, and through their judi
cial supplementation can fur
ther strengthen an already im
pressive concentration.
Third, a new concentration
point is neded — in the rapidly
advancing area of molecular bi
ology which has been under-rep
resented in the Department in the
past. The relationship of biologi
cal structure at its several levels
—anatomical, histological, mole
cular — is one of the pregnant
issues of the future. The structure
and shape of large biological
molecules clearly is a key to this,
and the field is only barely open
ing. As a physical problem in
volving biological objectives, and
hence needing biological orienta
tion, this area is sometimes re
ferred to as biophysics. However
labelled, it gives all the adminis
trative problems — and high po
tential yield — of all transitional
zones between two major disci
plines. By anchoring the mole
cular biology wing of the Depart
ment in this area, to balance
population biology at the oppo
site end, coverage of the full ga
mut of biology will be assured.
In addition to its teaching and
research responsibilities the De
partment has played, and must
continue to play, another role in
the University. It must administer
such general biological programs
and facilities as cut across usual
departmental lines, and hence are
not suitably located in a more
s p e c ia 1 i z e d department. Bio
physics already has been men
tioned and is a good example. An
other is the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion. Providing almost unique ac
cess to the marine environment,
the Station affords opportunity to
investigators and students in a
number of areas, both within Biol
ogy and in some of the specialized
departments. The availability of
the Hopkins Marine Station is
one of the major strengths of
Stanford biology, both in teaching
and research. Last spring quarter
the two functions were combined,
when 25 undergraduates spent 10
weeks studying the ecology, bio
chemistry, physiology, develop
ment and behavior of a marine
snail. The project was so success
ful that what students and staff
jointly learned will be published
as part of the scientific literature.
This is scientific education at its
best — and there are few institu

tions so fortunately endowed as
to provide it!
4. THE ESSENTIAL NEED
I have been attempting to
sketch, briefly what Stanford biol
ogy is and what its future pattern
might be. The central conception
is of a core department broadly
responsible for its discipline, and
interacting with and integrating
administratively other units in
specialized areas. Sine qua non is
a vigorous, central Department—
and fundamental to this are ade
quate physical facilities. Provi
sion of these has been too long
delayed. The new core curriculum
for majors, for example, cannot
be really properly given until wo
are in a new building. Beginning
of construction of the new Biol
ogy Center, appropriately placed
in one axis between Physics and
Chemistry, and the other axis be
tween the Medical School and the
Behavioral Sciences Center and
Mathematics, will symbolize the
central importance of biology
within the sciences and within the
University. The first two pro
jected units will allow most of
the existing Department on the
campus to be relocated in mod
ern facilities. This is a minimum
step to release the Department
from confinement and to allow it
to think constructively of the fu
ture. We must keep in mind that
though the Stanford biological
community is a distinguished one,
it is still incomplete in a number
of ways. It requires, for example,
fortification in biophysics, in ani
mal behavior, and in developmen
tal biology — the latter increas
ingly recognized on a national
scale as a high-priority area for
the immediate future. Additional
appointments are needed in these
areas, some of them in Biology,
some in specialized departments.
Wherever they are to be made
administratively, they will require
new physical facilities which meet
elevated modern standards. This
must be taken into account in
planning the Biology Center, since
it would seem most advantageous
to group specialized facilities
around the home of the Biology
Department as core. A develop
mental biology, or population
biology laboratory, for example,
might house research facilities
for a number of investigators
having common interest in these
areas — while allowing them to
participate academically in the
Biology Department or in one of
the specialized departments ap
propriate to their primary disci
pline. It is not too early to be
thinking in these terms. The Stan
ford biological community—like
the University generally—already

around the home of the Biology
Department as core. A develop
mental biology, or population
biology laboratory, for example,
might house research facilities
for a number of investigators
having common interest in these
areas — while allowing them to
participate academically in the
Biology Department or in one of
the specialized departments ap
propriate to their primary disci
pline. It is not too early to be
thinking in these terms. The Stan
ford biological community—like
the University generally—already
is outstanding. It will take only a
little more drive and commitment
to make it second to none in the
world. We have reached a point
in the history of Stanford biology
at which we cannot stand still.
We either find the wherewithal
to go forward—or we will slip
back. Given this choice I have
little doubt what the decision will
be.

The biological community at
Stanford thus is much larger than
the Biology Department, and the
Department must bo thought of
in relation to this larger commu
nity. This situation reflects a
strong central discipline, while
at the same time giving scope
for growth and development of
the specialized parts. If the en
lire biological community at Stan
ford were organized into a single
department it would be so large
as to be administratively un
wieldy. On the other hand, if the
several departments operated
completely without interaction
and integration there clearly
would be no central discipline at
all. In this situation it seems es
sential that the Biology Depart
ment should have as one of its
functions the provision of a center
of gravity — by maintaining a
continuing concern with the over
all discipline of biology. This fol
lows of course — if it did not in
other ways —■ from the nearly
exclusive responsibility of the
Department for undergraduate
education in biology, both for gen
eral studies and for majors. Re
gardless of their special objective,
students must meet biology
through the Department.
Aware of this, the Department
in the last couple of years has
been giving particular thought to
its curriculum. I would like to
spend just a few moments on our
new undergraduate curriculum
for majors, because it illustrates
both the difficulties and the chal
lenge of teaching biology during
this period of rapid flux. I may
say that, nationally, growing con
cern over how best to convey the
new orientation of biology to stu
dents is indicated by the recent
establishment of a Commission
for Undergraduate Education in
the Biological Sciences—on which
two of our faculty members serve.
Even as the Commission was get
ting organized Stanford already
had launched a new curriculum,
which is attracting interest as a
possible model for other institu
tions. Because we are a unified
Department, encompassing all of
biology, we have been able to
move more promptly and effec
tively than some other institu
tions where biology is cleaved
into several administrative units
without centrai integration.
This past quarter over 100 Stan
ford undergraduates were intro
duced to biology by a new course
—the first of a sequence of six—
which included a series of 40 lec
tures ranging from the origin of
life to the role of intelligence in

guiding human evolution. In be
tween, they saw life dissected con
ceptually from populations down
to molecules. They traced the
aggregation of living organization
from hereditary material to poly
organisms. They heard lecturers
of specialized competence in bio
chemistry, genetics, neurophysi
ology, embryology, systematics
and evolution. Among the lect
turers, incidentally, were Stan
ford's two Nobel prize winners in
biology.
These students, having been
shown the forest of biological
phenomena, will begin their more
concentrated and detailed study
in the new year. Winter quarter
will be spent on plants as organ
isms, spring quarter on animals
as organisms. Next fall most will
enroll in the Department's new
course in molecular biology. Hav
ing by then completed a year of
training in chemistry, they will be
ready to look at life as the bio
chemist and biophysicist see it.
The following quarter they will
examine cells in depth, particu
larly their dynamic and functional
aspects. Then, the following
spring they will be found in an
other new course, population biol
ogy, where their attention will be
focused on organisms in aggre
gates — behaving, interacting,
adapting, evolving as life has for
countless generations to people
the earth and now to reach out
beyond.
This, in brief, is the Depart
ment's new core curiculum, de
signed to give to the student the
common knowledge and tech
niques which underlie the multi
plicity of specialized biological
phenomena. All biologists need to
know the significance of major
macromolecular types, of mole
cular and cellular replication, of
the parts of cells. All need to
understand the general features
of living organization, of develop
ment, of living aggregates. The
revolution of biological teaching
which now is beginning, stems
from the revolution of biological
thinking which has occurred and
is continuing. The reoriented
teaching will place the general be
fore the detail, it will emphasize
the rule and provide only the best
example. This can be done now
and could not be done a quarter
century ago, because biology has
achieved new generalizations —
and will continue to . This is its
great fascination and challenge
today.
The concentration points in our
Department stem partly from
tradition, and partly from the new
biology. First, systematics and
evolution have been strong at
Stanford since David Starr Jor
dan. Their modern version is
population biology, with its com
bination of field and statistical
approaches, its implications for
human population problems, and
its affinity with the social
sciences. We are fortunate in hav

ing forceful representatives of the
field in the Department, and our
plans are to supplement them
further. When progress can be
based on tradition, the happy op
portunity should be seized.
Second, the unprecedently fer
tile fusion of biochemistry and
genetics began in the basement
catacombs of Jordan Hall, and
the product continues to grow and
expand as one of the major break
throughs of twentieth-century
science. Having rationalized
heredity, the productive wave is
lapping at the enigma of develop
ment. Here, biochemistry, genet
ics, cell physiology and embryol
ogy are co-mingled. Here, too, the
Department has acknowledged
leaders, and through their judi
cial supplementation can fur
ther strengthen an already im
pressive concentration.
Third, a new concentration
point is neded — in the rapidly
advancing area of molecular bi
ology which has been under-rep
resented in the Department in the
past. The relationship of biologi
cal structure at its several levels
—anatomical, histological, mole
cular — is one of the pregnant
issues of the future. The structure
and shape of large biological
molecules clearly is a key to this,
and the field is only barely open
ing. As a physical problem in
volving biological objectives, and
hence needing biological orienta
tion, this area is sometimes re
ferred to as biophysics. However
labelled, it gives all the adminis
trative problems — and high po
tential yield — of all transitional
zones between two major disci
plines. By anchoring the mole
cular biology wing of the Depart
ment in this area, to balance
population biology at the oppo
site end, coverage of the full ga
mut of biology will be assured.
In addition to its teaching and
research responsibilities the De
partment has played, and must
continue to play, another role in
the University. It must administer
such general biological programs
and facilities as cut across usual
departmental lines, and hence are
not suitably located in a more
s p e c ia 1 i z e d department. Bio
physics already has been men
tioned and is a good example. An
other is the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion. Providing almost unique ac
cess to the marine environment,
the Station affords opportunity to
investigators and students in a
number of areas, both within Biol
ogy and in some of the specialized
departments. The availability of
the Hopkins Marine Station is
one of the major strengths of
Stanford biology, both in teaching
and research. Last spring quarter
the two functions were combined,
when 25 undergraduates spent 10
weeks studying the ecology, bio
chemistry, physiology, develop
ment and behavior of a marine
snail. The project was so success
ful that what students and staff
jointly learned will be published
as part of the scientific literature.
This is scientific education at its
best — and there are few institu

tions so fortunately endowed as
to provide it!
4. THE ESSENTIAL NEED
I have been attempting to
sketch, briefly what Stanford biol
ogy is and what its future pattern
might be. The central conception
is of a core department broadly
responsible for its discipline, and
interacting with and integrating
administratively other units in
specialized areas. Sine qua non is
a vigorous, central Department—
and fundamental to this are ade
quate physical facilities. Provi
sion of these has been too long
delayed. The new core curriculum
for majors, for example, cannot
be really properly given until wo
are in a new building. Beginning
of construction of the new Biol
ogy Center, appropriately placed
in one axis between Physics and
Chemistry, and the other axis be
tween the Medical School and the
Behavioral Sciences Center and
Mathematics, will symbolize the
central importance of biology
within the sciences and within the
University. The first two pro
jected units will allow most of
the existing Department on the
campus to be relocated in mod
ern facilities. This is a minimum
step to release the Department
from confinement and to allow it
to think constructively of the fu
ture. We must keep in mind that
though the Stanford biological
community is a distinguished one,
it is still incomplete in a number
of ways. It requires, for example,
fortification in biophysics, in ani
mal behavior, and in developmen
tal biology — the latter increas
ingly recognized on a national
scale as a high-priority area for
the immediate future. Additional
appointments are needed in these
areas, some of them in Biology,
some in specialized departments.
Wherever they are to be made
administratively, they will require
new physical facilities which meet
elevated modern standards. This
must be taken into account in
planning the Biology Center, since
it would seem most advantageous
to group specialized facilities
around the home of the Biology
Department as core. A develop
mental biology, or population
biology laboratory, for example,
might house research facilities
for a number of investigators

new physical facilities which meet
elevated modern standards. This
must be taken into account in
planning the Biology Center, since
it would seem most advantageous
to group specialized facilities
around the home of the Biology
Department as core. A develop
mental biology, or population
biology laboratory, for example,
might house research facilities
for a number of investigators
having common interest in these
areas — while allowing them to
participate academically in the
Biology Department or in one of
the specialized departments ap
propriate to their primary disci
pline. It is not too early to be
thinking in these terms. The Stan
ford biological community—like
the University generally—already
is outstanding. It will take only a
little more drive and commitment
to make it second to none in the
world. We have reached a point
in the history of Stanford biology
at which we cannot stand still.
We either find the wherewithal
to go forward—or we will slip
back. Given this choice I have
little doubt what the decision will
be.
