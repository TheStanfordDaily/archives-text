VALUES OF EDUCATION
Editor, The Daily:
During the present academic
year a group of faculty and staff
members has been meeting for
regular lunch time discussions in
the Union Dining Room. The main
topic of our discussions has been
the role of values in education
and of the ways in which faculty
and staff can help students to find
lasting standards of values that
will be of permanent help in their
lives.
We believe that we could profit
by having students take part in
our informal discussions, and to
that end we are hereby extending
an invitation to students inter
ested in these problems to join us
for lunch on alternate Tuesdays,
beginning on Tuesday, January
21st.
Because of limited accommoda
tion, it will be necessary to re
strict the number of students to
about six, and invitations are off
ered on a first-come first-served
basis. Interested students may in
dicate their wish to attend by call
ing Professor Walter Meyerhof,
extension 435-1. Students partici
pating in this lunch group will
attend as guests of the group at
no expense to themselves.

KENNEDY
Editor, The Daily:
A Mr. Hawley, self-righteously
conservative, declared pompously
in a letter to the editor Tuesday
that the assassination of Presi
dent Kennedy was neither a "tra
gedy" nor a "crime against so
ciety." And he concluded by as
serting that "the majority of the
American voting public" felt no
real grief at his death, being only
capable of imitating the mourn
ing posture of others. The fan
tastic resumption of his state
mcnts and the galling smugness
of his tone, besides being highly
annoying, are insulting to the in
telligence and humanity of hi s
audience. However, to validly
criticize Mr. Hawley, one must
demonstrate the falsehood of his
argument. This is difficult simply
because of the great quantity of
inaccurate definitions and false
conclusions upon which his argu
ment rests. It is hard to know
where to begin, but the insidious!

implications of Mr. Hawley's ar
gument demand an attempt at
refutation.
First, President Kennedy's as
sassination was, for me at least,
a ti'agedy. Tragedy is not, "in i
exact terms, ... the self-caused
loom of a hero with a flaw," as
Mr. Hawley confidently asserts.
The above abstract definition may
have had some classic literary
utility, however it does not de
scibe the reality of my experience
of tragedy. When we speak of an
"airplane tragedy" (a plane falls
and more than a hundred are
killed) no one would assert that
this sudden and shattering de
struction was "self-caused" by the
"fatal-flaws" of the passengers.
Yet it is nevertheless a tragedy
and we all feel, to a degree, a
loss. Kennedy's sudden wea.h was
purposeless. It was a personal loss
and a tragedy. But it was more.
Kennedy was elected by the people
of this country to fulfill the capa
city of chief executive, the source
of law and order. Oswald was not
striking at Kennedy, the person,
but at the whole concept of law
and order. The tragedy stems
from the fact that Kennedy, the
human being, through no fault of
his own and to no purpose what
ever, was slain because of what he
symbolized.
In this light it can also be ar
gued that his assassination was
most definitely a crime against
society. Oswald's criminal act was
directed toward the "society" in
which we all participate. Hawley's
confusion arose from his distorted
definition of "society." "Society"
in not an "inanimate abstraction*'
which has no real existence, as
he asserts. There is an essential
difference between a number of
individuals occupying a certain
space, and a number of human
beings living together. The former
is a "category," the latter is a "so
ciety." By murdering President
Kennedy, the elected symbol of
our "social covenant," Oswald has
threatened every individual in so
ciety and the very existence of
society itself.
I have space for but one more
comment, What was the purpose
of your letter, Mr. Hawley? You
assert that Kennedy's assassina
tion was not such-and-such. But
you do not oven attempt to con
tribute anything positive to our
understanding of the event. You
only succeed in patting yourself
on the back and in insulting a
great number of people.
