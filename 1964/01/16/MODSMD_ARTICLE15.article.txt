# Matmen Top Mare Island, Moffett
## 
### RODGER MAGNUSON 
With throe matches yet to ho
decided in a meet last night in
Enoina Gym, Stanford's wrestlers
led Moffott Field 2fi to 3 and
Mare Island 22 to 5. By holding
such large margins with so few
matches remaining Stanford ap
peared to have cinched twin vic
tories in the triangular moot.
This was Stanford's first meet
of the season and their first moot
under I he tutelage of new Coach

Rill Leland. Thofr record last year
was 1-6, including a loss to Mof
fett. Field. Last night's action
gives Ihe Tribe a 2-0 mark in Ihe
infant season.
OUTSTANDING performers for
the matmen were Tim Davis at
130 pounds, who posted two vic
tories on falls, Hap Klopp, at 117
pounds, who won one match by a
3 to 0 count and pinned his other
opponent. All competitors in the
meet wrestled two matches, one

against a representative of each
of the other teams.
Phil Kendall, 1."57, star of last
year's team won both his matches
on points, providing six points
toward the substantial Stanford
totals. Kendall's Mare Island op
ponent gave him one of the tough
est matches of the season, being
slightly faster than Ihe more ex
perienced Stanford veteran. Ken
dall got a takedown and an es
cape on his man to win 4 to 0.
Other Stanford men who won
on pins were Dick Anderson, star
of last year's frosh, at 123 pounds,
Steve Schaum at 107 against his
Moffett Field opponent, heavy
weight; Duncan Ross also pinned
his Moffett Field opponent.
STANFORD co-coptain Don
Buehler, an All - American in
water water, and one of the
team's most consistent perform
ers last season, won both his
matches at 191 pounds on points.
Buehler so wore down his Mof
fett Field opponent by banging
his head on the gym floor, that
the match had to be delayer! for
about 3 minutes while the in
capacitated sailor regained his
wits.
Tom Allen, at 177 pounds, de
cisioned his Mare Island oppon
ent, and won his Moffett Field
encounter on a forfeit.
In their first encounter the In
dians looked much tougher than
last year, a tribute to the efforl
put forth by Coach Bill Leland
in his first year.
