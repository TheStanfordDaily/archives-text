## 
### 
Reverend William Sloane Coffin, Chaplain of Yale University
and Guest-In-Residence at Wilbur Hall, will speak today in Dinkel
spiel at 4:15 p.m.
Coffin's talk is entitled "A Christian's View on Civil Rights."
Coffin was arrested during the 1961 Freedom Rides in Alabama

his case is now up before the Su--*
preme Court—and has been con
stantly active in the United States
civil lights movement.
WHITING in the "Saturday K<'-
view," Mr. Coffin has said: "From
any religious or moral point of]
view integration is the only ac
ceptable goal, for the brotherhood I
of man is a farce if it is not fin-1
ally a matter of heart. Moreover,!
in an explosive world, integration I
may well be an absolute necessity.
But the fact that a thing is right j
and necessary still does not make
it possible; . . . For racial dis
crimination, or prejudice, is
deeply rooted in a sense of in
dividual insecurity which is
why it is at once so universal and
so ineradicable."
While at Wilbur for the last
three days, the Yale Chaplain has ;
captivated audiences in overflow-1
ing lounges and in crowded semi-!
nar groups. Dwight Clark, Dean
of Freshmen men, has said, "The
response to Mr. Coffin has been
tremendous here in Wilbur. To
hear him is quite an experience." I
Reverend Coffin has discussed i
isues from sex to civil rights in
small seminars, in informal pri
vate discussions, and in several
talks. He has also dined in several
of the Freshmen houses.
THIS afternoon's speech will be
the last chance for interested stu-'
dents to hear Mr. Coffin.
