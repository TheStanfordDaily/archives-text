A GUIDE FOR THE GLIDERS
One of the most interesting academic theories advanced in
many a long year has recently been advanced by that interest
ing academic theorist, E. Pluribus Ewbank, Ph. ]). who holds
the chair of Interesting Academic Theories at the St. Louis
('ollegc of Footwear and Educational Philosophy. Dr. Ewbank
said in the last issue of the learned journal, the Mount Rushnore
Guide to Scholastic Advancement and Presidents' Heads, that we
might be approaching the whole problem of student guidance
from the wrong direction.
Dr. Ewbank, a highly respected pedagogue and a lifelong
smoker of Marlboro Cigarettes, (I mention Marlboros for two
reasons: first, to indicate the scope of Dr. Ewbank's brainpower.
(hit of all the dozens of brands of cigarettes available today,
Dr. Ewbank lias had the wit and taste to pick the one with the
most flavorful flavor, the most filtracious filter, the most soft
soft pack, the most flip top Flip Top box: I refer, of course, to
Marlboro. The second reason I mention Marlboro is that I get
paid to mention Marlboro in this column, and the laborer, you
will agree, is worthy of his hire.)
But I digress. To return to Dr. Ewbank's interesting theory,
lie contends that most college guidance counselors are inclined
to take the easy way out. That is to say, if a student's aptitude
tests show a talent for, let us say, math, the student is encour
aged to major in math. If his tests show an aptitude for poetry,
he is directed toward poetry. And so forth.

All wrong, says Dr. Ewbank. The great breakthroughs, the
startling innovations in, let us say, math, are likely to be made
not by mathematicians—whose thinking, after all, is constrained
by rigid rules and principles—but by mavericks, by noncon
formists, by intuitors who refuse to fall into the rut of reason.
For instance, set a poet to studying math. He will bring a fresh,
unfettered mind to the subject, just as a mathematician will
bring the same kind of approach to poetry.
By way of evidence, Dr. Ewbank cites the case of Cipher
Binary, a youth who entered college with brilliant test scores in
physics, chemistry, and the calculus. But Dr. Ewbank forced
young Cipher to major in poetry.
The results were astonishing, llere, for example, is young
Cipher's latest poem, a love lyric of such originality that Lord
Byron springs to mind, i quote:
lie was her logarithm,
was his cusine.
Taking their dog with 'cm.
They hastened to go sign
Marriage vows which they joyfully shared,
And wooed and wed and pi r squared.
Similarly, when a freshman girl named Elizabeth Barrett
►Sigafoos came to Dr. Ewbank to seek guidance, he ignored the
fact that she had won the Pulitzer prize for poetry when she
was eight, and insisted she major in mathematics. Again the
results were startling. Miss Higafoos has set the entire math
department agog by flatly refusing to believe that six times
nine is 54. If Miss Sigafoos is correct, we will have to re-tliink
the entire science of numbers and—who knows?—possibly opeu
up vistas as yet undreamed of in mathematics.
Dr. Ewbank's unorthodox approach to student guidance has
.so impressed his employers that he was tired last week, lie is
currently selling beaded moccasins at Mount Itusluuore.

A GUIDE FOR THE GLIDERS
One of the most interesting academic theories advanced in
many a long year has recently been advanced by that interest
ing academic theorist, E. Pluribus Ewbank, Ph. ]). who holds
the chair of Interesting Academic Theories at the St. Louis
('ollegc of Footwear and Educational Philosophy. Dr. Ewbank
said in the last issue of the learned journal, the Mount Rushnore
Guide to Scholastic Advancement and Presidents' Heads, that we
might be approaching the whole problem of student guidance
from the wrong direction.
Dr. Ewbank, a highly respected pedagogue and a lifelong
smoker of Marlboro Cigarettes, (I mention Marlboros for two
reasons: first, to indicate the scope of Dr. Ewbank's brainpower.
(hit of all the dozens of brands of cigarettes available today,
Dr. Ewbank lias had the wit and taste to pick the one with the
most flavorful flavor, the most filtracious filter, the most soft
soft pack, the most flip top Flip Top box: I refer, of course, to
Marlboro. The second reason I mention Marlboro is that I get
paid to mention Marlboro in this column, and the laborer, you
will agree, is worthy of his hire.)
But I digress. To return to Dr. Ewbank's interesting theory,
lie contends that most college guidance counselors are inclined
to take the easy way out. That is to say, if a student's aptitude
tests show a talent for, let us say, math, the student is encour
aged to major in math. If his tests show an aptitude for poetry,
he is directed toward poetry. And so forth.

All wrong, says Dr. Ewbank. The great breakthroughs, the
startling innovations in, let us say, math, are likely to be made
not by mathematicians—whose thinking, after all, is constrained
by rigid rules and principles—but by mavericks, by noncon
formists, by intuitors who refuse to fall into the rut of reason.
For instance, set a poet to studying math. He will bring a fresh,
unfettered mind to the subject, just as a mathematician will
bring the same kind of approach to poetry.
By way of evidence, Dr. Ewbank cites the case of Cipher
Binary, a youth who entered college with brilliant test scores in
physics, chemistry, and the calculus. But Dr. Ewbank forced
young Cipher to major in poetry.
The results were astonishing, llere, for example, is young
Cipher's latest poem, a love lyric of such originality that Lord
Byron springs to mind, i quote:
lie was her logarithm,
was his cusine.
Taking their dog with 'cm.
They hastened to go sign
Marriage vows which they joyfully shared,
And wooed and wed and pi r squared.
Similarly, when a freshman girl named Elizabeth Barrett
►Sigafoos came to Dr. Ewbank to seek guidance, he ignored the
fact that she had won the Pulitzer prize for poetry when she
was eight, and insisted she major in mathematics. Again the
results were startling. Miss Higafoos has set the entire math
department agog by flatly refusing to believe that six times
nine is 54. If Miss Sigafoos is correct, we will have to re-tliink
the entire science of numbers and—who knows?—possibly opeu
