# Freedom Guides Berlin Univ. Life
## 
### BRUCE SIEVERS Berlin Scholarship Committee Chairman 
As the only returning student
from last year's exchange with
the Free University of Berlin, I
have been requested to recount
some of my experiences in the
program and to describe what it
means to be a student in Berlin.
I could begin by saying that the
experience was "terrific" or "in
valuable" or (truthfully) "the
most important one of my life,"
but such expressions about for
eign study seem to fill the campus
air these days, and, because of
their abundancy, no longer have
meaning for anyone except the
tellers. What might be of more
interest would be to try to convey
how studying in a foreign univer
sity is a unique experience. Such
is the purpose of this article and
of those which will follow.
STUDENT life in Berlin is
guided by one all-important prin
ciple: freedom. "Die Luft dcr Frei
heit weht" is an actuality at the
Free University. Personal and aca
demic liberty is valued as is
nothing else, as it well might be.
for il is the founding ideal of the
university.
What courses a student takes,
how much work he does, where
he lives, and with whom he asso
ciates are matters of his own
choice. Student government has
a real meaning - it has a power
ful hand in the formulation and
execution of university policy.
Courses are attended according
to the quality of the professor
a poor lecturer often finds him
self alone in the lecture hall.
No mid-terms or finals hold
whip-hand over the students -
degree-seekers stand or fall by a
final all-inclusive examination.
Student living is determined by
personal choice no Dean, House
Mother, or organization decrees
the conditions of his or her pri
vate life. Freedom, in every
aspect, is more than an object of
discussion, it is a principle to be
lived.
VET EKEEDO.M here as any
where presupposes the ability to
use it; education and maturity
must form the basis for its intelli
gent enjoyment. The Free Uni
versity. in order to operate under
these conditions, assumes a funda
mental maturity in the character
of those who enjoy its benefits.
The result of a combination of
freedom and maturity is what
might be expected: in academic
life high quality courses taught
and studied on an advanced level
rewarding for anyone who has
the chance to participate. In pri
vate life it is independence a n d
association with students who are
extremely interested in their work
and in the position in which they
