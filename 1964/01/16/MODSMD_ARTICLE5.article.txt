"Ixiin's Wheel: The Renais
j sance Ponders the Vicissitudes,"
I the third in the series of lectures
' by Professor Frank C. Manuel of
Brandeis University, attracted a
| large crowd yesterday, described
, by Professor Lewis Spitz as "the
| passive Republicans and the in
-1 tellectually elite Democrats," de
spite competition with Governor
j Brown.
In the Renaissance. Manuel con
tended, historical writing shifted
i ils focus from the City of God to
the city of man. Rather than con-
I fronting Augustine, the pagan
cyclism reborn circuited it, deal
ing with secular history.
THE HISTORIANS, now free
1 to unite all of the multiplicity of
states and communities into a
i single phiosophical schema, chose
! to rely "almost slavishly" on an-
I cient theories. The richness of his-
J torical material brought to bear
j upon the ancient theories de
manded profound ingenuity.
Manuel demonstrated that Ari
i stotle and Polybian were th e
I theoretical sources of the Renais
! sance historians. Theories derived
from Aristotle emphasize "the
| internal cycles of revolution." Hu
man nature is constant through
, time but is subjected to the vicis
| situdes of the human situation.
Polybrian fathers the school of
j thought emphasizing "the exter
nal power of the state.'' The no
tion that the life of the state is
cut short by the "hubrous of over
extension" has found its later day
| adherents in such men as Robe-
I spiere and Toynbee. Toynbee in
! herits another theme from the
Renaissance, i.e., that the decay of
external dominion corresponds to
the internal dissolution of the
j aristocracy.
ACCORDING to this latter
i theory, the rise of a state to great
j power and wealth induces "a great
rivalry among the potentates,"
I which leads to the downfall of the
state.
The cyclism of the historians
! reconciled itself to the scientific
progress of the late Renaissance
either l>y projecting the time of
! decay far into the future, becom
ing "optimistic by implication" or
iby drawing the distinction be
! tween scientific and moral prog
ress. Man remained, they thought,
subject to the inner vicissitudes.
Perhaps it should be added that
| Professor Manuel gives to his
thinking Ihe force and beauty of
fine oratory and illustrates in his
I lectures, as did Rabbi Heschel last
spring, the limitations of the vvrit
| ten word.
