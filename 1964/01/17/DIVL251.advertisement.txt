THE FIRE AND THE FLOOD
The Bible and the geologic record testify 1o a world-wide flood
in ancient times. This flood was the result of God's judgment
upon a world corrupt and sinful:
"Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was
filled with violence, and God saw the earth, and behold il was
corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earlh.
And God said to Noah. I have determined to make an end to all
flesh; for the earth is filled with violence through them." Gen.
6:11-13.
Many people today think the Old Testament story of Noah and
the flood is a myth of liltle importance. They would do well to
consider ihe New Testament Scriptures which warn of judg
ment 1o come judgmcnl which God's holiness demands upon
the present sinful and corrupt world of men who have forgotten
God and ignored God's atonement for their sins in Jesus Christ.
God promised Noah that the earth would never again he de
stroyed by the waters of a Hood, but Ihis does not mean that,
man's sins will go unjudged.
"Note this first: in the last days there will come men who scoff
at religion and live self-indulgent lives, and they will say 'Where
now is the promise of his coming? Our fathers have been laid to
their rest, but still everything continues exactly as it has always
been since the world began.' In taking this view, they lose sight
of the fact that there were heavens and earth long ago, created
out of God's Word and out of water and with water; and by
water that first world was destroyed, the water of the deluge.
And the present heavens and earth, again by God's Word, have
been kept in store for burning; they are being reserved unlil the
day of judgment when the godless will be destroyed.
And here is one point, my friends, which you must not lose sight
of: with the Lord one day is like a thousand years and a thou
sand years like one day. It is not that the Lord is slow in fulfill
ing his promise, as some suppose, but that he is very patient with
you. because it is not his will for any to be lost, but for all to
come to repentance. But the Day of the Lord will come; it will
come unexpected as a thief. On that day the heavens will dis
appear with a great rushing sound, the elements will disin
tegrate in flames, and the earth with all that is in it will be laid
bare. Since the whole universe is to break up in this way, think
what sort of people you ought to be, what devout and dedicated
lives you should live! Look eagerly for the coming of ihe Day
of Gorl and work to hasten it on; that day will set the heavens
ablaze until they fall aparl and will melt the elements in flames.
But we have his promise, and look forward 1o new heavens and
a new earth, Ihe home of justice... With this to look forward to.
do your utmost to be found at peace with him. unblemished
and above reproach in his sight.." II Peter 3:3-11, N.E].
The Christians who prepare these ads will he happj to personalty answer your ques
tions by mail or to meet you in order that you might he secure, through faith in
Christ, against certain wrath and judgment to come. lio\ 11791, l'alo Alto.
