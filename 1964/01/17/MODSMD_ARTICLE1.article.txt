# PACE Sets New Record, Nets Over $109 Million
## 
### DAVID BARNUM BILL SMITH 
"Two years and nine months after the PACE campaign was
launched, total gilts and pledges and Ford matching funds amount
to $109,235,101," University President Wallace Sterling announced
at a San Francisco press conference yesterday.
"To the best of our knowledge the $109 million total is a new high

for a single university capital"
campaign," Sterling said. "The
program was on target for all
areas except for buildings and
here the aim was for $41 million
ol" which only $15.2 million is in
hand."
A new undergraduate library,
as yet only partially financed,
holds top priority for continued
support. Kenneth Cuthbertson,
vice president for finance an d
PACE program manager, told the
Daily that completion of the plans
and breaking of the ground for
the new library will take place
"during the coming summer or
next fall."
"ENOUGH undesignated funds
are available and could be allo
cated to the library for its con
struction," Sterling said, "but the
trustees would prefer to finance
the library from major gifts spe-1
cifically earmarked for this pur
pose."
The trustees believe that major
gifts will be forthcoming during
the final two months of the PACE j
drive which will "add a substan- j
tial amount to the total." Presum-!
ably some of these funds will be
used for library construction and
other planned projects.
"THE PACE drive has added
about $30 million in endowment
to the University, bringing the
total market value of the endow
ment to $194-195 million," Ster
ling said. "Stanford ranks about
10th among American univer
sities in total endowment, but
only about 30th or 40th in the rela
tion ol dollar value of endowment
to number of students."
Morris M. Doyle, president of
the Board of Trustees, announced
at the press conference yesterday
the receipt of the second largest
gift to come to the University
since its founding. The benefac
tion, which pushed the PACE
campaign over its goal of $100
million, and which in itself totals
more than $5 million, stems from
a trust that Mr. William F. Her
rin established in 1922. Mr. Her
ri n. who died in 1927, was a San
Francisco attorney and friend of
Senator Leland Stanford.
STANFORD'S fund raising goal
for the entire decade of the 6()'s,
Sterling said, is $346 million, of
which the PACE campaign funds
constitute a substantial part. Ken
neth Cuthbertson noted that con

tributions to Stanford have "risen
steadily and steeply, peaking with
the PACE campaign." He hopes
that contributions henceforth
will come in at the new higher
level.
Sterling concluded his statement
to the press conference this way:
"1 should like to note, as I have
on many previous occasions, our
great indebtedness and gratitude
to the Ford Foundation, and the
Ford family who established it,
for their generous role in help
ing to make these accomplish
ments possible.
"We are the benfieiaries of their
foresight and enterprise in mak
ing this grant and other grants
for pioneering projects and pro
grams. We hope to prove oursel
ves worthy ol' this confidence."

Francisco attorney and friend of
Senator Leland Stanford.
STANFORD'S fund raising goal
for the entire decade of the 6()'s,
Sterling said, is $346 million, of
which the PACE campaign funds
constitute a substantial part. Ken
neth Cuthbertson noted that con

tributions to Stanford have "risen
steadily and steeply, peaking with
the PACE campaign." He hopes
that contributions henceforth
will come in at the new higher
level.
Sterling concluded his statement
to the press conference this way:
"1 should like to note, as I have
on many previous occasions, our
great indebtedness and gratitude
to the Ford Foundation, and the
Ford family who established it,
for their generous role in help
ing to make these accomplish
ments possible.
"We are the benfieiaries of their
foresight and enterprise in mak
ing this grant and other grants
for pioneering projects and pro
grams. We hope to prove oursel
ves worthy ol' this confidence."
"Two years and nine months after the PACE campaign was
launched, total gilts and pledges and Ford matching funds amount
to $109,235,101," University President Wallace Sterling announced
at a San Francisco press conference yesterday.
"To the best of our knowledge the $109 million total is a new high

for a single university capital"
campaign," Sterling said. "The
program was on target for all
areas except for buildings and
here the aim was for $41 million
ol" which only $15.2 million is in
hand."
A new undergraduate library,
as yet only partially financed,
holds top priority for continued
support. Kenneth Cuthbertson,
vice president for finance an d
PACE program manager, told the
Daily that completion of the plans
and breaking of the ground for
the new library will take place
"during the coming summer or
next fall."
"ENOUGH undesignated funds
are available and could be allo
cated to the library for its con
struction," Sterling said, "but the
trustees would prefer to finance
the library from major gifts spe-1
cifically earmarked for this pur
pose."
The trustees believe that major
gifts will be forthcoming during
the final two months of the PACE j
drive which will "add a substan- j
tial amount to the total." Presum-!
ably some of these funds will be
used for library construction and
other planned projects.
"THE PACE drive has added
about $30 million in endowment
to the University, bringing the
total market value of the endow
ment to $194-195 million," Ster
ling said. "Stanford ranks about
10th among American univer
sities in total endowment, but
only about 30th or 40th in the rela
tion ol dollar value of endowment
to number of students."
Morris M. Doyle, president of
the Board of Trustees, announced
at the press conference yesterday
the receipt of the second largest
gift to come to the University
since its founding. The benefac
tion, which pushed the PACE
campaign over its goal of $100
million, and which in itself totals
more than $5 million, stems from
a trust that Mr. William F. Her
rin established in 1922. Mr. Her
ri n. who died in 1927, was a San
Francisco attorney and friend of
Senator Leland Stanford.
