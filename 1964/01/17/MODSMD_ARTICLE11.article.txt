Stanford has "about the? best
religious cooperation on any
campus today,'' Chaplain Robert
Minto told the Daily recently.
"1 meet with (Protestant and
Catholic) clergymen from the
area every week," continued
Minto. "I act as a type of chair
man ul a board that coordinates
religious activities. They give
part of their time to the Univer
sity chaplain to help him."
THK (JKOIJI* which is called
the Stanford Christian Council
and hasn't, says Minto, reached
"the stage of official decisions"
deals with such areas as race
relations work, discussion pro
grams, Sunday night Vesper ser
vices and other religious activ
ities."
"Hi < 'I! A (fY.mmii 100 on Reli

gious Affairs) that represents
everyone -Catholics, Protestants,
Jews, Moslems and Bahai," Minto
explained. "We don't want to take
up all of CRA's time with the
things about which the Christian
Council concerns itself."
MINTO STAT 10 D that he's op
posed to suggestions that non-
Protestant religious groups be
allowed to worship on campus.
"I don't see a need for it,"he
explained. "The major problem is
that most students don't care for
religion ... At present, with the
growth of cooperation through
CRA and the Council, there are
infinite possibilities of develop
ment under the existing system.
I'll be ready if there's any
change."
MINTO pointed out that, due
to stipulations in the Founding
Grant, the "only responsibility
the University has as far as reli
gious exercises go" is a Protes
tant, ii<>M rlcnnmin il ioi m I l\I(-n111

rial Church.
He added: "The University's
hands were tied by the Grant.
The opportunity for worship is
not a prime problem here ... I
don't know what changes may
come, but I won't come out in
demand for private places on
campus."
Asked to define "non-sectarian,"
Minto said he was "not concerned
about some precise definition of
'non-sectarian.' "
"I'M (ONtIORNKD with the
religious life o! students," lie ex
plained. "I never want to be
pontificaling. I'm chaplain, not an
administrative officer. I'm some
where between the faculty and
the students, and I don't want to
have to interpret some official de
cision."
Minto said, however, that ho
didn't thin k "non-sotcarian"
meant including all religions. "We
can't incorporate everything in
MerrtoTi tl Cluirrh Iterroi e 4lit>n

we wouldn't have anything," he
stated.
IN REGARD to expanding the
chaplain's staff 1o include non-
Protestant clergy, Minto said he
saw no "need for this develop
ment." He pointed out t hat if "we
expanded t ho staff that much, we
would have to extend the entire
staff for all the Protestant de
nominations."
At present there are two mem
bers of the stuff Minlo and Ast.
Chaplain John Tirrell.
MINTO said he sees his position
as one of encouraging religion at
the University. "But," he added,
"I'm not responsible for all reli
gion at Stanford. ... I have a
double function. One is associated
with this building (Memorial
Church>, and the other is asso
ciated with pastoral activities
such as funerals and dealing with
people associated with Stanford.
