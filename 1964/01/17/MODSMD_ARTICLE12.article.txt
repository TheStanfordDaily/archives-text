### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
The Zeta Psi fraternity has been suspended from Stanford for
three years, President Wallace Sterling announced yesterday.
The action was prompted by a series of incidents that have taken
place sincc the house was placed on "general probation" in October
of last quarter. According to Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler,

Stanford police found in the Zete-
House $300 to $400 worth of fur
niture belonging to the I-Center;
the burned remains of three old
cars which had been shot at were
found on the grounds surround
ing I he house, and four pistols,
two rifles, a double-barrelled shot
gun. empty shels, and a quantity
of ammunition were found inside.
Possession of firearms is pro
hibited on I he Stanford campus.
ALSO LOCATED at the Zeta
Psi house were three fire extin
guishers not the property of the
house, one of which belonged to
a Palo Alto fire truck.
On Thursday evening of last
week, the Inter-fraternity Board
recommended acceptance of a
Zeta Psi plan for self improve
ment. While confusion exists as
to the intent of the original plan,
the Zete house subsequently de
cided not to answer the charges
th rough disciplinary action
against individual members,
thereby not meeting the condi
tions of IFB's approval.
Letters sent to the Zete Presi
dent and to all Zeta Psi alumni
state that the house, located in
the new cluster is to be vacated
; by tomorrow. All members of the
chapter as of last quarter have
been placed on "general proba
tion," according to the letters.
According to the Dean, who
signed both letters, no time limit
has been put on the probation
! provision. He stated last night
that tiie probation will be re
viewed and will "present no prob
lem" to any except those who
"plan to continue living on t he
fringes." General probation is not
recorded on a student's transcript,
but is placed in a confidential file.
THE ZETE HOUSE will be used
j for "housing other Stanford stu
dents." according to the letters;
no more detailed information was
available last night. It is the re
sponsibility of the alumni to start
the chapter again; they were en
couraged to do so for the aca
demic year 1966-67. If the chapter
is brought back into existence at
that time, the current Zete house
will be available for them.
The Zete members must file
their new addresses wit h t he Dean
of Students; not more than three
of the members may live in the
same residence without the Dean's
permission.
The probation of last October
was prompted by damage to the
Alpha Kappa Lambda house by
the Zetes and the injury of an
AKL active. According to Win
bigler's letter to the alumni, "To
date, full restitution has not been
made, nor were the guilty mem
j bers disciplined."
The October probation required
payment for damages, medical
treatment, discipline of those re
sponsible, and proof "to the sat
isfaction of the Interfraternity
Board" that the Zete house was
"capable of governing its own
members and operation."
Winbigler's letter to the 600
alumni stated, "We are taking
this action because Zeta Psi has
persisted in conducting itself in
a manner contrary to the educa
tional objectives and standards
of the University. Mu Chapter
has been either on probation or

under suspension in five of the
past seven years."
The Zete President stated to the
Daily: "The Zete house has made
a valuable contribution to Stan
ford in the past. Because of the
accumulation of unfortunate in
cidents in recent years, the Zete
house has been suspended from
Stanford. We regret this. We
look forward to reactivating the
Zete house in 1966."
