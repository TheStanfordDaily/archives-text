# Religion, Civil Rights Demand Action Here
## 
### 
Yale's Chaplain William Coffin has told the student body
he senses a great awakening of student awareness and acti
vism at Stanford. Twenty-four hours before, the Governor
of this state told the student body that Stanford students have
begun expressing themselves through effective and direct
political action and that the whole idea excites him. And
Stanford's activities in the fields of civil rights and religion
have become the deep concern of broad segments of the
campus population.
It is precisely the revolution of broadening horizons and
deepening commitments cited by Coffin and Brown that
accounts for the presence and nature of the discussion of civil
rights and of religion here, and the frequent intertwining of
the two issues.
That there is strong interest in religion at Stanford is a
fact; without even turning to the more subtle proofs, one
merely can check the enrollment statistics in religion courses
—and the weakest of David Riesman's hypothetical other
directed radar antennas can sense that the traditional colle
giate pressure for defection from religion has been turned off.
That there is a strong interest in civil rights is a fact;
$5,000, 14 students in Mississippi, and the waiting lists for
tutorial projects are only the more obvious proofs.
It is only when searching for a cause and effect explana
tion of the whole phenomenon of today's Stanford student
that fact is difficult to find. Perhaps the demand by the forces
of history for confrontation of the issues of human dignity
and right has led to the intellectual demand for deep analysis
of ethical questions, the religious issue. Perhaps the ecu
menical movement and the spirit of human unity—growing
out of a world that can create a future of total prosperity or
total destruction with the forces it currently controls—has led
to consideration of man's relation to man, the civil rights issue.
Perhaps a young leader who could create a peace corps has
changed the nature of the times, and perhaps the times created
the young leader.
Certainly the discussions of religion and of civil liberties
are not related for all students, but one finds a piece of com
mon ground in searching for the origin of both discussions.
In any case, the facts demand action. The need is un
questioned for co-operation by all parts of the Stanford com
munity to facilitate religious worship and religious leadership
in dealing with the ethical questions that produce the politi
cal action. The need is unquestioned for organization and
information to facilitate student aid in solving the problems
of manpower training and a truly universal suffrage in all
parts of the nation.
That the issues are real ones which must be confronted
immediately is not in question. And it is not in question that
both are directly relevant to the academic community. The
only question to be solved in the coming days and weeks is
the action to be taken through the co-operative efforts of
the students, the faculty, the administrators.

deepening commitments cited by Coffin and Brown that
accounts for the presence and nature of the discussion of civil
rights and of religion here, and the frequent intertwining of
the two issues.
That there is strong interest in religion at Stanford is a
fact; without even turning to the more subtle proofs, one
merely can check the enrollment statistics in religion courses
—and the weakest of David Riesman's hypothetical other
directed radar antennas can sense that the traditional colle
giate pressure for defection from religion has been turned off.
That there is a strong interest in civil rights is a fact;
$5,000, 14 students in Mississippi, and the waiting lists for
tutorial projects are only the more obvious proofs.
It is only when searching for a cause and effect explana
tion of the whole phenomenon of today's Stanford student
that fact is difficult to find. Perhaps the demand by the forces
of history for confrontation of the issues of human dignity
and right has led to the intellectual demand for deep analysis
of ethical questions, the religious issue. Perhaps the ecu
menical movement and the spirit of human unity—growing
out of a world that can create a future of total prosperity or
total destruction with the forces it currently controls—has led
to consideration of man's relation to man, the civil rights issue.
Perhaps a young leader who could create a peace corps has
changed the nature of the times, and perhaps the times created
the young leader.
Certainly the discussions of religion and of civil liberties
are not related for all students, but one finds a piece of com
mon ground in searching for the origin of both discussions.
In any case, the facts demand action. The need is un
questioned for co-operation by all parts of the Stanford com
munity to facilitate religious worship and religious leadership
in dealing with the ethical questions that produce the politi
cal action. The need is unquestioned for organization and
information to facilitate student aid in solving the problems
of manpower training and a truly universal suffrage in all
parts of the nation.
That the issues are real ones which must be confronted
immediately is not in question. And it is not in question that
both are directly relevant to the academic community. The
only question to be solved in the coming days and weeks is
the action to be taken through the co-operative efforts of
the students, the faculty, the administrators.
Yale's Chaplain William Coffin has told the student body
he senses a great awakening of student awareness and acti
vism at Stanford. Twenty-four hours before, the Governor
of this state told the student body that Stanford students have
begun expressing themselves through effective and direct
political action and that the whole idea excites him. And
Stanford's activities in the fields of civil rights and religion
have become the deep concern of broad segments of the
campus population.
It is precisely the revolution of broadening horizons and
deepening commitments cited by Coffin and Brown that
accounts for the presence and nature of the discussion of civil
rights and of religion here, and the frequent intertwining of
the two issues.
