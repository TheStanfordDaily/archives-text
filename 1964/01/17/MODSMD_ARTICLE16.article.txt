# '8Â½ Does for Screen What Ulysses Did for Literature'
## 
### FOSTER HIRSCH Drama Editor 
Caught in a traffic jam, a man
sits restlessly in his car. When he
discovers that he is locked in, he
pounds frantically on the win
dows as people around him pas
sively regard his mounting hor
ror. As the man begins to suffo
cate, he is released from his im
prisonment and soars freely in
the air above the crowded human
ity below. At the zenith of hi s
flight, a string attached to his
foot is cut and he falls into an
ocean.
Here, in a flow of pregnant
symbols. Federieo Fellini intro
duces the substance of his auto
biographical film, "S'/i," which
explores a period of crisis in the
life of a famous director in search
of a theme for his next film. In
deed, "BV6" is among the most,
intensely personal films ever
made. Like Proust, Fellini has
made a religion of his pesonal
life; as viewers, we must enter
properly into the spirit of the film
by bringing to it our own private
universes. If we keep at a dis
tance, Guido's experience will
seem merely disorganized and
arbitrary. Further, an attitude
of aloofness, in failing to meet the
demands which the film makes,
may betray one into carelessly
dismissing it as a satire of avant
garde films or a ridicule of film
goers eager to unravel its sym
bols. To be sure, "8%" is at times
quite amusing, but it is not sa
tiric.
THE SERIOUSNESS which in
forms Fellini's work is evidenced
in the depth with which the film
probes Guido's consciousness as
his thoughts shift from present
to past, from reality to illusion.
The film's external level is an
account of Guido's stay at a
health spa which he hopes will re
lax his mind and enrich his
thoughts, and the arrival at the
spa of his shallow, effervescent
mistress, his rigid wife, and his
insistent producers who demand a
new film. Guido remains preoc
cupied throughout these events.
In deference to his producers, ho
builds as a set for a proposed
film a giant space-launching pad
which stretches into the sky like
a beason of hope. He imposes ap
pearance on reality in trying to
select from a group of actors the
proper ones to portray real people
from his life. At a frantic press
conference, after a symbolic sui
cide which rids him of his frus
tration and empties him of his
ideals about his art, he accepts
the terms of his life and its limita
tions. He dances in large circle
with all the people he has known
and thus becomes a member of
the herd. Presumably, ho will go

on to make easy, commercial
films like "Charade" instead of
difficult materpieces like
Threaded throughout Guido's
external environment are his
memories and private fancies. All
told these flashbacks suggest a
vast panorama of Guido's child
hood and early adult life. The
varying moods of these episodes,
which range from sentimental to
droll to profound, are all informed
by Guido's point of view as he
searches among them for possible
material for his film. At a ceme
tery, his father turns away from
him. As a little boy. he runs to
the beach with his friends to see
a fat prostitute dance; he plays a
treasure-chest game in a da r k
bc-droom buried deep in his child
hood. In a steam bath, he goes to
see a Pope who spouts turgid doc
trine at him. In his harem, he
rules with a whip all the women
)f his life. Throughout he sees
Claudia, a vision in white, a sym
bol for him of that purity and
understanding which he will never
attain. Ironically, it is she who is
a chief instrument in bringing
home to him the realization that
he is, after all, an ordinary man
with nothing really crucial to say.
Athough our acquaintance with
Guido is deep and personal, Fel
lini's film has more universal ap
plications than the personal his
tory of one artist. His film, in
fact, encompasses no less a sub
ject than the crisis of Art in a
faithless age. Indeed, the bravura
technique with which the audi
ence is presented summarizes
practically everything successful
which has been done in cinema
before, and goes beyond this to
offer a new synthesis. The exqui
site chiaroscuro photography has
a rich, sharp texture; almost
every frame, in its beauty of bal
ance and composition, would make
stunning still shots. Fellini's cam
era, in addition to capturing the
larger material environment of
which ti. Q action is a part, has
a real sense of movement. The
pace skillfully alternates between
graceful, leisurely sequences to
fast, hectic action in which mo
mentum is achieved by vigorous
cutting.
IN BOTH THE content and
form of his film, Fellnin has al
lowed himself enormous flexibil
ity. The construction of the film
itself min-ors the gropings and
confusions of Guido's mind. It
is in fact the film's purposive ab
straction and ambiguity which
makes it triumphant.
In the final analysis, "BV3" does
for the screen what Ulysses has
done for literature: it introduces
a new language, a new dimen
sion of feeling, and when seen
against it, other films appear
jthin and synthetic.
