# Assessment of Christian Unity -Student Ecumenical Council
## 
### DAVID SWEENEY 
(Editor's Note: Mr. Sweeney
was one of the 'i'i Stanford stu
dent delegates to the 19th Ecu
menical Student Conference
held at Atlie ns, Oliio over
Christmas vacation.)

In a time of world-wide concern
for Christian unity, as manifested
by Vatican 11, the Pope's recent
visit to the Holy Land, interde
nominational Protestant negotia
tions (result of Blake Proposal)
going on in our own country, and
the Church of South India; the
gathering of 3,200 students as the
19th Ecumenical Student Confer
ence provides an opportunity for
measuring the success of efforts
for union to date, and indicates,
quite pointedly, the direction in
which we must go. But, more
over, any ecumenical gathering
at this moment in church history
has a dual responsibility of wit
nessing both to the reality of the
divided Church in the world to
day, a reality which was unmis
takeable in the representation of
over 50 denominations in Protest
ant Christendom, and observers
from the Roman Catholic Church;
and to the power of the Lord aid
ing us in our stumbling steps to
ward the goal of an organic union
of Christians in His church. The
conference was a remarkable suc
cess at fulfilling both responsibili
ties.
TO MEET its first responsibil
ity, that of presenting a realistic
representation of the brokenness
of the Church, the planning com
mittee scheduled denominational
worship and Communion services
on three days of the conference,
all located on or near the Ohio
University campus. The planning
committee also allowed time for
services of the Eastern Orthodox
Divine Liturgy, and scheduled
Friends Meetings in eight loca
tions during free time.
The second, and more difficult,
responsibility was confronted in
a variety of ways, ranging from
interdenominational (as well as
international and interracial) Liv
ing Unit Groups, which met every
evening of the conference; to the
Service of Holy Communion ac
cording to the Apostalic Tradition
of Hyppolytus which was over
whelmingly regarded as the apo
gee of the life of worship at
Athens.
By using this particular Holy
Communion Service, written by
Saint Hippolytus in Rome about
200 A.D., the delegates were taken

back in history beyond all pres
ent divisions, and participated in
a simple, reasonable, and biblical
service which centered on the
proclamation of the Word and the
action of Holy Communion. This
order united the main elements
of Christian faith in a single act
of corporate worship. Indeed, this
service of Intercommunion set a
precedent for ecumenical gather
ings of this size, and succeeded in
being nearly all-inclusive at pre
cisely the point where such con
ferences in the past have failed,
that of Communion. The service
was a much more radical depar
ture from tradition than anything
the World Council of Churches
has attempted since its founding.
THE SERVICE left a number of
indelible impressions on every
participant, and the life of the
conference can be summed up in
a symbolic interpretation of that
short hour and one-half. The mere
fact that 3,000 delegates c o u 1 d
receive bread and wine from over
40 deacons and presbyters in an
orderly and worshipful fashion
makes one more optimistic about
Christian r-eunion. No communi
cant will forget the centrality of
the conference theme "For the
Life of the World" symbolized by
the banquet table draped in white
linen in the front of the audito
rium, flanked by ministers of
many denominations, which,
coupled with the element of wine
brought to the table in syrup
pitchers, provided a needful re
minder of the sustaining nature
of the Lord's Supper. Nor will we
soon forget the offering being
taken up in "Hum-Dinger" milk
shake cups, which, when placed
on the Communion table beside
the wine, summarized the confer
ence message of the real sacra
mental character of that which
we regard as secular. We were
never allowed to forget that the
usual distinction between that
which is holy and that which is
unholy, or between those things
of God's creation and those of
man's, is biblically untenable.
And for those of us who were
in sight of a girl, who. when the
time came for her celebration of
Communion, could not conscion
ably partake, and began to cry;
unbridled optimism was not al
lowed to sweep away the hard
fact of the sinfulness of our di
vided Church which was so poig
nantly manifested in this sepa
rated brethren who could not ex
press her desire for unity in
Christ around His table.

of the Lord's Supper. Nor will we
soon forget the offering being
taken up in "Hum-Dinger" milk
shake cups, which, when placed
on the Communion table beside
the wine, summarized the confer
ence message of the real sacra
mental character of that which
we regard as secular. We were
never allowed to forget that the
usual distinction between that
which is holy and that which is
unholy, or between those things
of God's creation and those of
man's, is biblically untenable.
And for those of us who were
in sight of a girl, who. when the
time came for her celebration of
Communion, could not conscion
ably partake, and began to cry;
unbridled optimism was not al
lowed to sweep away the hard
fact of the sinfulness of our di
vided Church which was so poig

press her desire for unity in
Christ around His table.

was one of the 'i'i Stanford stu

held at Atlie ns, Oliio over
Christmas vacation.)

In a time of world-wide concern
for Christian unity, as manifested
by Vatican 11, the Pope's recent
visit to the Holy Land, interde
nominational Protestant negotia
tions (result of Blake Proposal)
going on in our own country, and
the Church of South India; the
gathering of 3,200 students as the
19th Ecumenical Student Confer
ence provides an opportunity for
measuring the success of efforts
for union to date, and indicates,
quite pointedly, the direction in
which we must go. But, more
over, any ecumenical gathering
at this moment in church history
has a dual responsibility of wit
nessing both to the reality of the
divided Church in the world to
day, a reality which was unmis
takeable in the representation of
over 50 denominations in Protest
ant Christendom, and observers
from the Roman Catholic Church;
and to the power of the Lord aid
ing us in our stumbling steps to
ward the goal of an organic union
of Christians in His church. The
conference was a remarkable suc
cess at fulfilling both responsibili
ties.
TO MEET its first responsibil
ity, that of presenting a realistic
representation of the brokenness
of the Church, the planning com
mittee scheduled denominational
worship and Communion services
on three days of the conference,
all located on or near the Ohio
University campus. The planning
committee also allowed time for
services of the Eastern Orthodox
Divine Liturgy, and scheduled
Friends Meetings in eight loca
tions during free time.
The second, and more difficult,
responsibility was confronted in
a variety of ways, ranging from
interdenominational (as well as
international and interracial) Liv
ing Unit Groups, which met every
evening of the conference; to the
Service of Holy Communion ac
cording to the Apostalic Tradition
of Hyppolytus which was over
whelmingly regarded as the apo
gee of the life of worship at
Athens.
By using this particular Holy
Communion Service, written by
Saint Hippolytus in Rome about
200 A.D., the delegates were taken

back in history beyond all pres
ent divisions, and participated in
a simple, reasonable, and biblical
service which centered on the
proclamation of the Word and the
action of Holy Communion. This
order united the main elements
of Christian faith in a single act
of corporate worship. Indeed, this
service of Intercommunion set a
precedent for ecumenical gather
ings of this size, and succeeded in
being nearly all-inclusive at pre
cisely the point where such con
ferences in the past have failed,
that of Communion. The service
was a much more radical depar
ture from tradition than anything
the World Council of Churches
has attempted since its founding.
THE SERVICE left a number of
indelible impressions on every
participant, and the life of the
conference can be summed up in
a symbolic interpretation of that
short hour and one-half. The mere
fact that 3,000 delegates c o u 1 d
receive bread and wine from over
40 deacons and presbyters in an
orderly and worshipful fashion
makes one more optimistic about
Christian r-eunion. No communi
cant will forget the centrality of
the conference theme "For the
Life of the World" symbolized by
the banquet table draped in white
linen in the front of the audito
rium, flanked by ministers of
many denominations, which,
coupled with the element of wine
brought to the table in syrup
pitchers, provided a needful re
minder of the sustaining nature
of the Lord's Supper. Nor will we

ings of this size, and succeeded in
being nearly all-inclusive at pre
cisely the point where such con
ferences in the past have failed,
that of Communion. The service
was a much more radical depar
ture from tradition than anything
the World Council of Churches
has attempted since its founding.
THE SERVICE left a number of
indelible impressions on every
participant, and the life of the
conference can be summed up in
a symbolic interpretation of that
short hour and one-half. The mere
fact that 3,000 delegates c o u 1 d
receive bread and wine from over
40 deacons and presbyters in an
orderly and worshipful fashion
makes one more optimistic about
Christian r-eunion. No communi
cant will forget the centrality of
the conference theme "For the
Life of the World" symbolized by
the banquet table draped in white
linen in the front of the audito
rium, flanked by ministers of
many denominations, which,
coupled with the element of wine
brought to the table in syrup
pitchers, provided a needful re
minder of the sustaining nature
of the Lord's Supper. Nor will we
soon forget the offering being
taken up in "Hum-Dinger" milk
shake cups, which, when placed
on the Communion table beside
the wine, summarized the confer
ence message of the real sacra
mental character of that which
we regard as secular. We were
never allowed to forget that the
usual distinction between that
which is holy and that which is
unholy, or between those things
of God's creation and those of
man's, is biblically untenable.
And for those of us who were
in sight of a girl, who. when the
time came for her celebration of
Communion, could not conscion
ably partake, and began to cry;
unbridled optimism was not al
lowed to sweep away the hard
fact of the sinfulness of our di
vided Church which was so poig
nantly manifested in this sepa
rated brethren who could not ex
press her desire for unity in
Christ around His table.

was one of the 'i'i Stanford stu
dent delegates to the 19th Ecu
menical Student Conference
held at Atlie ns, Oliio over
Christmas vacation.)

In a time of world-wide concern
for Christian unity, as manifested
by Vatican 11, the Pope's recent
visit to the Holy Land, interde
nominational Protestant negotia
tions (result of Blake Proposal)
going on in our own country, and
the Church of South India; the
gathering of 3,200 students as the
19th Ecumenical Student Confer
ence provides an opportunity for
measuring the success of efforts
for union to date, and indicates,
quite pointedly, the direction in
which we must go. But, more
over, any ecumenical gathering
at this moment in church history
has a dual responsibility of wit
nessing both to the reality of the
divided Church in the world to
day, a reality which was unmis
takeable in the representation of
over 50 denominations in Protest
ant Christendom, and observers
from the Roman Catholic Church;
and to the power of the Lord aid
ing us in our stumbling steps to
ward the goal of an organic union
of Christians in His church. The
conference was a remarkable suc
cess at fulfilling both responsibili
ties.
TO MEET its first responsibil
ity, that of presenting a realistic
representation of the brokenness
of the Church, the planning com
mittee scheduled denominational
worship and Communion services
on three days of the conference,
all located on or near the Ohio
University campus. The planning
committee also allowed time for
services of the Eastern Orthodox
Divine Liturgy, and scheduled
Friends Meetings in eight loca
tions during free time.
The second, and more difficult,
responsibility was confronted in
a variety of ways, ranging from
interdenominational (as well as
international and interracial) Liv
ing Unit Groups, which met every
evening of the conference; to the
Service of Holy Communion ac
cording to the Apostalic Tradition
of Hyppolytus which was over
whelmingly regarded as the apo
gee of the life of worship at
Athens.
By using this particular Holy
Communion Service, written by
Saint Hippolytus in Rome about
200 A.D., the delegates were taken

back in history beyond all pres
ent divisions, and participated in
a simple, reasonable, and biblical
service which centered on the
proclamation of the Word and the
action of Holy Communion. This
order united the main elements
of Christian faith in a single act
of corporate worship. Indeed, this
service of Intercommunion set a
precedent for ecumenical gather
ings of this size, and succeeded in
being nearly all-inclusive at pre
cisely the point where such con
ferences in the past have failed,
that of Communion. The service
was a much more radical depar
ture from tradition than anything
the World Council of Churches
has attempted since its founding.
