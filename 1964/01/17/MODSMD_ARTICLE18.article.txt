SEQUOIA
Editor, The Daily:
While rooting through the
"girlie" section of the newsrack
in the San Francisco bus station
I ran across a copy of the Sequoia.
Naturally being an impression
able Stanford Freshman, I im
mediately realized that this maga
zine does not belong among all
those substandard periodicals be
cause its contents are written by
the cream of our literary crop,
one of which is Ihe editor. There
fore I indignantly informed the
clerk that the Sequoia, being Stan
ford's literary magazine, does not
belong on the same smutty shel
ves with all the other dirty books.
I pointed out to him that the
cover is arty and very appealing
to the intellectual set whereas
the inferior magazines expose
their contents in a more blunt and
vivid way. I added that no one
would feel ashamed to read the
Sequoia in a public place because
of its arty facade. Following the

intellectual format of the maga
zine it sometimes employs foreign
words and phrases such as Sun
derzergen, which modesty pre
vents me to translate. Then by
summation, I shook my finger at
him as I remarked lhat to put a
college publication with its ma
turity and sophistication guaran
teed by its editor-author in th e
middle of the other pornographic
material is a crime. As I finished,
I spied next to me the suitable
place to display Stanford's repre
sentative literary effort. Flinging
it into the receptacle, and staring
coldly at the clerk, I walked off.
