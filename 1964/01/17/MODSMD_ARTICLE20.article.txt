# Stanford Invades Bruin Lair
## 
### TOM ELIAS 
Stanford's basketeers head into
their most important weekend of
i the season tonight when they
tangle with the Bruins of the Uni
versity of California at Los An
geles at Ihe Sports Arena in
Smogsville.
The Tribe of Coach Howie
Dallmar heads into the crucial
I weekend with a record of nine
wins against two losses, and
needs at least one win to stay
i alive in the Big Six race. Right
j now, chances do not look too
I good for a win.
UCLA IS UNBEATEN in both
overall and confernece play and
almost a unanimous choice by
voters in both polls for the pre
mier spot in the national rank
ings. Meanwhile, Stanford man
ia ges to place a distant 18th in
'one and an honorable mention in
I the other.
UCLA on paper was not sup-
I posed to have much of a ball club
| this season, even though they had
j every regular back from last
year's AAWU co-champs who
beat the Cards in a playoff for
I the NCAA tournament spot.
But thanks to their great team
| speed and balance, the Uclans
i have staved off all threats. When
ever an opponent seems to threat
en, Coach Johnny Wooden throws
his boys into the most effective
full-court press the Coast has
seen in a long time.
IT'S A STUANCJE sight to see.
that Bruin press, but it sure does
work. Fred Slaughter, the 6-5
center who scores a deceptive 7.2
points per game, plays on the
head end of the alignment. At
midcourt are the quick and high
scoring guards, Gail Goodrich and
Walt Hazzard, with Jack Hirsh
and Keith Erickson, the for
wards, backing them up.
Without a really good ball
handling guard, its almosl impos
sible to get the ball down court
against the Bruins. And since this
is just exactly where Stanford is
the weakest, it could be a bleak
weekend for the Tribe.
But Stanford has its own strong
points. To counter the flashy
Uclan offense, which has aver
aged 91.8 points per game, Stan
ford can boast a defense that has

hold opponents to a 5.1.3 average
[while the Tribe has managed a
68.5 average on offense.
BALANCK IS THE long suit of
I both teams. All the nruin rog
, ulars have broken the 15 point
barrier al least once. The Guards,
I Goodrich and Hazzard, are the
leading point getters with 21.6
land 18.5 averages. Hirsh is next
i with 15.1, while Erickson, Slaugh
ter and sub Kenny Washington
are all grouped between (> and 9
! points.
Meanwhile, Stanford will sport
! a healthy height advantage at
every position. Dose will have
three inches on his man, Slaugh
ter, while everyone else has at
least a two ineh edge.
This means that if UCLA
shoots anywhere near the 27 per
cent it hit in the second half last
Saturday night against Southern
Cal, it should get beaten oi'f the
backboards and thus in Hie ball
; game.
IN ACTION LAST weekend,
1 UCLA blasted SC's Trojans by
179-59 and 7S-71 counts. In the
Saturday night affair, UCLA held
an 18 point lead just into the sec
ond half, and managed to hang
1 on despite a furious Trojan rally
j that at one point had SC within
i three points and almost turned
| t he tide.
Stanford in the meantime was
: boring two capacity crowds at the
antiquated Pavilion, beating
Washington's Huskies twice by
substantial margins.
The old saw that a bad team
can make a good team look ter
rible. even while taking a pasting

from it, certainly applies here.
The Huskies were outclassed
from the start in both games, and
despite the antics of lovable
Charlie Hart, and two good ef
forts by center Clint Popples,
they succeeded in putting both
crowds to sleep.
DESPITE THE apparent ad
vantages that UCLA holds as the
two teams meet in their long
awaited and much-heralded work
end series, it is best not to count,
Stanford out too soon.
Sure, UCLA beat Kansas by
twenty at K.U. while Stanford
squeaked by the .layhawkors in
overtime at ihe Pavilion. Sure
UCLA has beaten everyone it has
faced, including such highly re
garded teams as Michigan, Illi
nois, Creighton and Kansas Slate.
Since, the Tribe lost to SC in the
sweet and homey confines of the
campus antique while the Bruins
beat the Trojans decisively twice.
Sure, Stanford has beaten
UCLA in Los Angeles only twice
in 32 attempts under Howie Dan
man. Sure, UCLA has never lost
at Santa Monica C.C., where Sat
urday night's game will be
played.
ALE THIS MAY well be true,
but it isn't enough to count the
Indians out before they even
walk on the court. Stanford will
not only be fighting to win the
AAVVU crown that hangs in the
balance this weekend, but also
for the national recognition that
will automatically come from
beating ihe nation's number one
team in its own lair.
And remember that Stanford's
only losses have come when Tom
Dose was either out with a knee
injury or immobilized by it, and
these only by one point each.
Stanford is nobody's pushover,
and with all the Tribe has to
gain from a victory, it should
put forth its finest effort of the
season.
So keep your ear glued to Don
Klein's soothing voice on KCBS at
8 tonight, if you can't go South,
and you may got a pleasant sur
prise.

IN ACTION LAST weekend,
1 UCLA blasted SC's Trojans by
179-59 and 7S-71 counts. In the
Saturday night affair, UCLA held
an 18 point lead just into the sec

1 on despite a furious Trojan rally
j that at one point had SC within
i three points and almost turned
| t he tide.
Stanford in the meantime was
: boring two capacity crowds at the
antiquated Pavilion, beating
Washington's Huskies twice by
substantial margins.
The old saw that a bad team
can make a good team look ter
rible. even while taking a pasting

from it, certainly applies here.
The Huskies were outclassed
from the start in both games, and
despite the antics of lovable
Charlie Hart, and two good ef
forts by center Clint Popples,
they succeeded in putting both
crowds to sleep.
DESPITE THE apparent ad
vantages that UCLA holds as the
two teams meet in their long
awaited and much-heralded work
end series, it is best not to count,
Stanford out too soon.
Sure, UCLA beat Kansas by
twenty at K.U. while Stanford
squeaked by the .layhawkors in
overtime at ihe Pavilion. Sure
UCLA has beaten everyone it has
faced, including such highly re
garded teams as Michigan, Illi
nois, Creighton and Kansas Slate.
Since, the Tribe lost to SC in the
sweet and homey confines of the
campus antique while the Bruins
beat the Trojans decisively twice.
Sure, Stanford has beaten
UCLA in Los Angeles only twice
in 32 attempts under Howie Dan
man. Sure, UCLA has never lost
at Santa Monica C.C., where Sat
urday night's game will be
played.
ALE THIS MAY well be true,
but it isn't enough to count the
Indians out before they even
walk on the court. Stanford will
not only be fighting to win the
AAVVU crown that hangs in the
balance this weekend, but also
for the national recognition that
will automatically come from
beating ihe nation's number one
team in its own lair.
And remember that Stanford's
only losses have come when Tom
Dose was either out with a knee
injury or immobilized by it, and
these only by one point each.
Stanford is nobody's pushover,
and with all the Tribe has to
gain from a victory, it should
put forth its finest effort of the
season.

Stanford's basketeers head into
their most important weekend of
i the season tonight when they
tangle with the Bruins of the Uni
versity of California at Los An
geles at Ihe Sports Arena in
Smogsville.
The Tribe of Coach Howie
Dallmar heads into the crucial
I weekend with a record of nine
wins against two losses, and
needs at least one win to stay
i alive in the Big Six race. Right
j now, chances do not look too
I good for a win.
UCLA IS UNBEATEN in both
overall and confernece play and
almost a unanimous choice by
voters in both polls for the pre
mier spot in the national rank
ings. Meanwhile, Stanford man
ia ges to place a distant 18th in
'one and an honorable mention in
I the other.
UCLA on paper was not sup-
I posed to have much of a ball club
| this season, even though they had
j every regular back from last
year's AAWU co-champs who
beat the Cards in a playoff for
I the NCAA tournament spot.
But thanks to their great team
| speed and balance, the Uclans
i have staved off all threats. When
ever an opponent seems to threat
en, Coach Johnny Wooden throws
his boys into the most effective
full-court press the Coast has
seen in a long time.
IT'S A STUANCJE sight to see.
that Bruin press, but it sure does
work. Fred Slaughter, the 6-5
center who scores a deceptive 7.2
points per game, plays on the
head end of the alignment. At
midcourt are the quick and high
scoring guards, Gail Goodrich and
Walt Hazzard, with Jack Hirsh
and Keith Erickson, the for
wards, backing them up.
Without a really good ball
handling guard, its almosl impos
sible to get the ball down court
against the Bruins. And since this
is just exactly where Stanford is
the weakest, it could be a bleak
weekend for the Tribe.
But Stanford has its own strong
points. To counter the flashy
Uclan offense, which has aver
aged 91.8 points per game, Stan
ford can boast a defense that has

hold opponents to a 5.1.3 average
[while the Tribe has managed a
68.5 average on offense.
BALANCK IS THE long suit of
I both teams. All the nruin rog
, ulars have broken the 15 point
barrier al least once. The Guards,
I Goodrich and Hazzard, are the
leading point getters with 21.6
land 18.5 averages. Hirsh is next
i with 15.1, while Erickson, Slaugh
ter and sub Kenny Washington
are all grouped between (> and 9
! points.
Meanwhile, Stanford will sport
! a healthy height advantage at
every position. Dose will have
three inches on his man, Slaugh
ter, while everyone else has at
least a two ineh edge.
This means that if UCLA
shoots anywhere near the 27 per
cent it hit in the second half last
Saturday night against Southern
Cal, it should get beaten oi'f the
backboards and thus in Hie ball
; game.
IN ACTION LAST weekend,
1 UCLA blasted SC's Trojans by
179-59 and 7S-71 counts. In the
Saturday night affair, UCLA held
an 18 point lead just into the sec
ond half, and managed to hang
1 on despite a furious Trojan rally
j that at one point had SC within
i three points and almost turned
| t he tide.
Stanford in the meantime was
: boring two capacity crowds at the
antiquated Pavilion, beating
Washington's Huskies twice by
substantial margins.
The old saw that a bad team
can make a good team look ter
rible. even while taking a pasting

from it, certainly applies here.
The Huskies were outclassed
from the start in both games, and
despite the antics of lovable
Charlie Hart, and two good ef
forts by center Clint Popples,
they succeeded in putting both
crowds to sleep.
DESPITE THE apparent ad
vantages that UCLA holds as the
two teams meet in their long
awaited and much-heralded work
end series, it is best not to count,
Stanford out too soon.
Sure, UCLA beat Kansas by
twenty at K.U. while Stanford
squeaked by the .layhawkors in
overtime at ihe Pavilion. Sure
UCLA has beaten everyone it has
faced, including such highly re
garded teams as Michigan, Illi
nois, Creighton and Kansas Slate.
Since, the Tribe lost to SC in the
sweet and homey confines of the
campus antique while the Bruins
beat the Trojans decisively twice.
Sure, Stanford has beaten
UCLA in Los Angeles only twice
in 32 attempts under Howie Dan
man. Sure, UCLA has never lost
at Santa Monica C.C., where Sat
urday night's game will be
played.
ALE THIS MAY well be true,
but it isn't enough to count the
Indians out before they even
walk on the court. Stanford will
not only be fighting to win the
AAVVU crown that hangs in the
balance this weekend, but also
for the national recognition that
will automatically come from
beating ihe nation's number one
team in its own lair.
And remember that Stanford's
only losses have come when Tom
Dose was either out with a knee
injury or immobilized by it, and
