# Berlin School Offers Active Student Life

(Second ol' a Series)
A student protest movement
and an unsual house in West Ber
lin formed the meager beginnings
of what is today a leading Ger
man university. This phenomenal
growth of the Free University in
the past 16 years is an indication
of the energy and active partic
ipation which characterizes all of
Berlin student life. The spirit
makes itself felt on the newly ar
! rived exchange student.
Tin: STUDENTENDOUF (stu
dent village) where he lives
I houses a collection of people
! whose only common character
| istic is that they are all students.
They are purposely selected from
different national backgrounds:
20 per cent foreign, 30 per cent
East German (refugees), and 50
per cent West German and West
Berlin. On my floor alone were
an Indian, an Ethopian, a Span
iard, two Greeks, an Austrian,
two Berliners, three West Ger
mans, and four East Germans.
In the common kitchen one
must not only attempt to digest
his own strange cooking but for
eign ideas as well. When he eats
he must be prepared for battle
contradicting moral ideas, politic
al beliefs, and academics are
daily expressed in uncertain Ger
j man. A typical starting point
| might be a cynical comment by
the Indian or the African about
our racial situation: "Your great
! land which is supposed to stand
for democracy and protection of
! the individual doesn't even follow
i its own precepts." And so on into
i the night.
STUDENTS FLOCK to hear nu
! mcrous outstanding professors:
Lowenthal, Stammer, von de
: Gablent/., Gollwitzer, de Boor.
Markshies are some of the inter-
I nationally known names. The new
j East Europe and Otto Suhr (po
litical science) Institutes are
i unique in Germany and high re
; putations in academic circles
j throughout the world. Courses
vary from "Theory of the Com
! munist State and Law" to "Mod
! ern German Drama" to "Philos
j ophical Problems of Quantum
| Mechanics."
ASIDE FROM the Studenten
! dorf and the University just "liv
j ing" in Berlin is an experience in
! itself. On many occasion we stood
all night for tickets to the opera,
j theater, or philharmonic (all
among the best in Germany) or
visited newly discovered friends
â–  on the Eastern side of the Wall.
I Taking medicine, western books,
nylon hose, or simply oneself
I across to the "other side" of the
city helps to lighten some of the
j lives of people who have little
else to hope for. Experiences and
conversations like these not only
i make the life of a Berlin ex
change student fascinating but
gives it a real meaning.
