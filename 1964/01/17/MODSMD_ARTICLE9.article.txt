# Coffin Discusses 'Christian View Of Civil Rights'
## 
### TONY TUFT 
It is now one minute to mid
night in the South with respect
to civil rights." Thus began an
urgent appeal yesterday by Wil
liam Sloane, controversial Yale
University chaplain, for "A Chris
tian View of Civil Rights."
A deep contradiction has existed
in American ideals since this na
tion's inception, stated the Yale
i chaplain. "We have always de
clared that men were created
equal, but have not always recog
nized that Negroes were men."
Coffin stressed that he did not
mean to suggest here that all men
were alike, but to emphasize the
fact that those characteristics
that distinguish an individual are
not those that determine the value
of human life to God.
HUMAN BROTHERHOOD, con
tinued Coffin, is divinely ordained.
It is not therefore achieved, but
received and recognized by men.
The chaplain went on to discuss
effects of discrimination. "Prop
erty rights," he said, "cannot be !
allowed to obscure the more
fundamental need for human
rights." The former should be
used to "reflect and not to reject"
the latter.
"Racial discrimination in fra
jternities or country clubs," con
â€¢ tended Coffin, "is contrary to
; Christian principles. A single act
of discrimination ... is just as
; wrong here as it is on a larger
I scale in housing and education."
"THE QUESTION involved in
J civil rights," he later added "is
not whether they will be attained,
but whether they can be attained
with or without violence."
Although Coffin agrees with
former President Eisenhower on
the futility of legislating morals,
the chaplain added that he consid
ered it possible to legislate th e
conditions "most conducive to a
!flourishing morality."
IN ANSWER to the charge that
i civil rights were a political issue
! with which the churches have no
right to meddle, Coffin stated
"these were probably the words
of the Pharaoh to Moses. A Chris- 1
tlan must always be concerned
with justice; and even if Chris
tianity does not pretend to pro
vide blueprints for attaining jus
tice, it offers insights that can
! define and illuminate the prob
| lems involved."
