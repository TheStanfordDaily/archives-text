# Art Professor Explains Program to Aid Negro Art
## 
### BILL SMITH Feature Editor 
The speaker is Dr. Albert Elsen, visiting professor of
art and art history from Indiana University, and the sub
ject is art in Negro colleges in the South, and the emphasis
is on good will and on doing something:
"THERE IS A large source of creative talent (among
Negroes) . . . which is not receiving encouragement, recog
nition and training.'We feel that Negroes should have the
opportunity to find out if they can be painters or sculptors.
Full equality, intellectually and creatively speaking, de
mands more development in the visual arts. It occurred to
me that the art world was rich enough and had a large
enough group of people and enough good will to do some
thing."
In an interview with The Daily, Elsen described the
development of a program of aid to Negro colleges in the
South. The program, operating through The Committee
On Art In Negro Colleges, is designed to give all possible
support to the emergence of art departments in southern
Negro colleges.
Opportunities for the development of individual talents
are not available to Negroes attending all-Negro colleges
in the South. A portion of a letter written to Elsen by the

chairman of the art department of a southern Negro col
lege amply illustrates the deficiencies:
"PRESENTLY OUR department consists of approxi
mately forty majors and minors of which at least thirty
have financial problems of meeting the art materials re
quirement. In art history, we have one small slide pro
jector, fifty color slides and a painted masonite screen.
In ceramics, we have one kiln with a storage cabinet and
a few stilts. In painting we have five easels, two of which
are table easels. In sculpture, we have one modeling table,
one set of stone carving tools, one bush hammer, clay and
one set of modeling tools ..."
As a comparison, Stanford this year will buy over
10,000 new slides. They will add 1,000 books and periodi
cals to the library and several projectors. Easels, paints,
canvas, paper, clay and all the other necessities of an art
student are within the reach of Stanford students.
Elsen's interest in the problems of the art departments
of southern Negro colleges began several years ago. "I
noticed that at the national professional meetings of art
instructors, there were no Negroes and no Negro colleges
represented," Elsen said. "I rarely encountered a Negro
art student, and then I began to hear, here and there, of
Negro students who went north to Columbia and Harvard.

"THIS FALL, a Negro came to my office at Stanford
to talk about enrolling for Winter Quarter. The student
had a master of fine arts from the University of lowa and
wanted advanced work in art history. He hoped to return
to the South to teach," Elsen said.
"I expressed surprise, since salaries were appallingly
low, that he would want to go South. He said simply that
there was a need and a lot oi students and that the depart
ments were badly staffed." And Elsen decided to find out
about the problem and see if he could help.
"A series of telephone calls to various Negro colleges
in the South indicated that the impression conveyed by the
student who came to my office was correct. The need in
the South was great," Elsen said. "And I determined to
write to several important and influential men in the art
world to see what could be done."
THE RESULT was a bi-racial committee, The Commit
tee For The Development Of Art In Negro Colleges, to aid
art. The committee is divided into two groups, those who
determine the needs and the priorities of the colleges to
receive the aid, and the second group which will try to
obtain materials to fill the needs. Elsen is the co-chairman
of the group concentrating on the second area and Jack
Jordan, chairman of the art department of Southern Uni

versity in New Orleans, is the other co-chairman in charge
of the first area.
The committe has definite ideas on what it wants. "Wo
don't want a one shot aid program that goes for a while
and then dies out. The problem is to get a sustaining pro
gram," Elsen said.
"WE DON'T WANT to start something and get up the
hopes of the Negroes and then let the program fizzle. So
we are trying to build something which will work over the
years. And yet we don't want to take on the obligation of
supporting a department. This is the responsibility of the
college administrations.
"We want to stimulate tiie action of the colleges in this
area by showing how important art is," Elsen said.
One of the most significant and hopeful developments
growing out of the activities of the committee is the awak
ening interest in men in other fields, history, chemistry,
psychology, etc., in the activities of the Elsen committee.
"The interest for a similar program is particularly high
in the psychology departments," Ellen said. "But we hope
these men are slower organizing that we are, because we
need to get to the foundations and get some help first. Art
is always at the bottom of the budget in most colleges and
we don't want to miss out here too."

the South was great," Elsen said. "And I determined to
write to several important and influential men in the art
world to see what could be done."
THE RESULT was a bi-racial committee, The Commit
tee For The Development Of Art In Negro Colleges, to aid
art. The committee is divided into two groups, those who
determine the needs and the priorities of the colleges to
receive the aid, and the second group which will try to
obtain materials to fill the needs. Elsen is the co-chairman
of the group concentrating on the second area and Jack
Jordan, chairman of the art department of Southern Uni

versity in New Orleans, is the other co-chairman in charge
of the first area.
The committe has definite ideas on what it wants. "Wo
don't want a one shot aid program that goes for a while
and then dies out. The problem is to get a sustaining pro
gram," Elsen said.
"WE DON'T WANT to start something and get up the
hopes of the Negroes and then let the program fizzle. So
we are trying to build something which will work over the
years. And yet we don't want to take on the obligation of
supporting a department. This is the responsibility of the
college administrations.
"We want to stimulate tiie action of the colleges in this
area by showing how important art is," Elsen said.
One of the most significant and hopeful developments
growing out of the activities of the committee is the awak
ening interest in men in other fields, history, chemistry,
psychology, etc., in the activities of the Elsen committee.
"The interest for a similar program is particularly high
in the psychology departments," Ellen said. "But we hope
these men are slower organizing that we are, because we
need to get to the foundations and get some help first. Art
is always at the bottom of the budget in most colleges and
we don't want to miss out here too."
The speaker is Dr. Albert Elsen, visiting professor of
art and art history from Indiana University, and the sub
ject is art in Negro colleges in the South, and the emphasis
is on good will and on doing something:
"THERE IS A large source of creative talent (among
Negroes) . . . which is not receiving encouragement, recog
nition and training.'We feel that Negroes should have the
opportunity to find out if they can be painters or sculptors.
Full equality, intellectually and creatively speaking, de
mands more development in the visual arts. It occurred to
me that the art world was rich enough and had a large
enough group of people and enough good will to do some
thing."
In an interview with The Daily, Elsen described the
development of a program of aid to Negro colleges in the
South. The program, operating through The Committee
On Art In Negro Colleges, is designed to give all possible
support to the emergence of art departments in southern
Negro colleges.
Opportunities for the development of individual talents
are not available to Negroes attending all-Negro colleges
in the South. A portion of a letter written to Elsen by the

chairman of the art department of a southern Negro col
lege amply illustrates the deficiencies:
"PRESENTLY OUR department consists of approxi
mately forty majors and minors of which at least thirty
have financial problems of meeting the art materials re
quirement. In art history, we have one small slide pro
jector, fifty color slides and a painted masonite screen.
In ceramics, we have one kiln with a storage cabinet and
a few stilts. In painting we have five easels, two of which
are table easels. In sculpture, we have one modeling table,
one set of stone carving tools, one bush hammer, clay and
one set of modeling tools ..."
As a comparison, Stanford this year will buy over
10,000 new slides. They will add 1,000 books and periodi
cals to the library and several projectors. Easels, paints,
canvas, paper, clay and all the other necessities of an art
student are within the reach of Stanford students.
Elsen's interest in the problems of the art departments
of southern Negro colleges began several years ago. "I
noticed that at the national professional meetings of art
instructors, there were no Negroes and no Negro colleges
represented," Elsen said. "I rarely encountered a Negro
art student, and then I began to hear, here and there, of
Negro students who went north to Columbia and Harvard.

"THIS FALL, a Negro came to my office at Stanford
to talk about enrolling for Winter Quarter. The student
had a master of fine arts from the University of lowa and
wanted advanced work in art history. He hoped to return
to the South to teach," Elsen said.
"I expressed surprise, since salaries were appallingly
low, that he would want to go South. He said simply that
there was a need and a lot oi students and that the depart
ments were badly staffed." And Elsen decided to find out
about the problem and see if he could help.
"A series of telephone calls to various Negro colleges
in the South indicated that the impression conveyed by the
student who came to my office was correct. The need in
the South was great," Elsen said. "And I determined to
write to several important and influential men in the art
world to see what could be done."

mately forty majors and minors of which at least thirty
have financial problems of meeting the art materials re
quirement. In art history, we have one small slide pro
jector, fifty color slides and a painted masonite screen.
In ceramics, we have one kiln with a storage cabinet and
a few stilts. In painting we have five easels, two of which
are table easels. In sculpture, we have one modeling table,
one set of stone carving tools, one bush hammer, clay and
one set of modeling tools ..."
As a comparison, Stanford this year will buy over
10,000 new slides. They will add 1,000 books and periodi
cals to the library and several projectors. Easels, paints,
canvas, paper, clay and all the other necessities of an art
student are within the reach of Stanford students.
Elsen's interest in the problems of the art departments
of southern Negro colleges began several years ago. "I
noticed that at the national professional meetings of art
instructors, there were no Negroes and no Negro colleges
represented," Elsen said. "I rarely encountered a Negro
art student, and then I began to hear, here and there, of
Negro students who went north to Columbia and Harvard.

"THIS FALL, a Negro came to my office at Stanford
to talk about enrolling for Winter Quarter. The student
had a master of fine arts from the University of lowa and
wanted advanced work in art history. He hoped to return
to the South to teach," Elsen said.
"I expressed surprise, since salaries were appallingly
low, that he would want to go South. He said simply that
there was a need and a lot oi students and that the depart
ments were badly staffed." And Elsen decided to find out
about the problem and see if he could help.
"A series of telephone calls to various Negro colleges
in the South indicated that the impression conveyed by the
student who came to my office was correct. The need in
the South was great," Elsen said. "And I determined to
write to several important and influential men in the art
world to see what could be done."
THE RESULT was a bi-racial committee, The Commit
tee For The Development Of Art In Negro Colleges, to aid
art. The committee is divided into two groups, those who
determine the needs and the priorities of the colleges to
receive the aid, and the second group which will try to
obtain materials to fill the needs. Elsen is the co-chairman
of the group concentrating on the second area and Jack
Jordan, chairman of the art department of Southern Uni

versity in New Orleans, is the other co-chairman in charge
of the first area.
The committe has definite ideas on what it wants. "Wo
don't want a one shot aid program that goes for a while
and then dies out. The problem is to get a sustaining pro
gram," Elsen said.
"WE DON'T WANT to start something and get up the
hopes of the Negroes and then let the program fizzle. So
we are trying to build something which will work over the
years. And yet we don't want to take on the obligation of
supporting a department. This is the responsibility of the
college administrations.
"We want to stimulate tiie action of the colleges in this
area by showing how important art is," Elsen said.
One of the most significant and hopeful developments
growing out of the activities of the committee is the awak
ening interest in men in other fields, history, chemistry,
psychology, etc., in the activities of the Elsen committee.
"The interest for a similar program is particularly high
in the psychology departments," Ellen said. "But we hope
these men are slower organizing that we are, because we
need to get to the foundations and get some help first. Art
is always at the bottom of the budget in most colleges and
we don't want to miss out here too."
The speaker is Dr. Albert Elsen, visiting professor of
art and art history from Indiana University, and the sub
ject is art in Negro colleges in the South, and the emphasis
is on good will and on doing something:
"THERE IS A large source of creative talent (among
Negroes) . . . which is not receiving encouragement, recog
nition and training.'We feel that Negroes should have the
opportunity to find out if they can be painters or sculptors.
Full equality, intellectually and creatively speaking, de
mands more development in the visual arts. It occurred to
me that the art world was rich enough and had a large
enough group of people and enough good will to do some
thing."
In an interview with The Daily, Elsen described the
development of a program of aid to Negro colleges in the
South. The program, operating through The Committee
On Art In Negro Colleges, is designed to give all possible
support to the emergence of art departments in southern
Negro colleges.
Opportunities for the development of individual talents
are not available to Negroes attending all-Negro colleges
in the South. A portion of a letter written to Elsen by the

chairman of the art department of a southern Negro col
lege amply illustrates the deficiencies:
"PRESENTLY OUR department consists of approxi
