# PACE Has Just Begun

### 
The PACE program's most exciting phase is yet to come.
Perhaps those most intimately connected with the technical
aspects of the fund-raising saw the program's peak reached
in the progression from the wooing of the Ford Foundation,
through the forming of a national network of dedicated alumni
and the receipt of the first rash of major gifts, to the final
weeks of concentrated appeals to bring the drive to its goal.
For those outside the small cadre of professional fund
raisers, the PACE program is not exciting in the form of $109
million dollars. It is exciting in the form of a ticket to ex
perimentation.
One cannot think of the seminars, the speechs, the dia
logues that Tresidder has added to the campus without realiz
ing what the construction of the Undergraduate Libary can
mean to the deepening of Stanford's intellectual life. When
the University of Michigan constructed an undergraduate
library, the number of books checked in and out increased
dramatically. Meeting groups, displays, study facilities were
outgrowths of the building's construction; in essense, students
were reading and thinking of things they would not have read
and thought of before the construction of the library.
There are those who were offended by a university that
could prepare dossiers of wealthy friends and alumni, analyz
ing their every like, dislike and intimate personal quirk in
order to most efficiently approach them for support. It was
easy to become offended, for the whole process appeared cold,
inhuman, and detached from the meaning of the academic
community. Rut these are times when political campaigns
are analyzed and plotted on computers, not on soapboxes,
times when the greatest minds are applying themselves to the
problem of preserving human dignity as machines make man's
skills anachronisms. The question of academic meaning and
offended sensibilities comes not during this initial stage of
acquisition but during the phase upon which we now enter:
application.
The undergraduate library is an exciting prospect, but it
is obvious as a use for PACE money. Stanford is now one of
the few institutions of private learning with the financial abil
ity to encourage the off-beat idea, the new seminar or tutorial
program, the experiment in campus living arrangements, the
pet educational project of the idealistic professor.
It is a grave responsibility to be a member of the univer
sity community that has executed the largest money-making
venture of any institution of its type. Sister institutions are
less envious than they are encouraged by our success. We
are being watched. If our new-found riches are deployed
merely to perpetuate the existing, then indeed we deserve the
ostracisim of the academic who cannot bear to see the univer
sity adopt the corporation's tactics. The imaginative — even
daring and reckless — channelling of our funds can demon
strate that whatever our tactics, our values are those of the
scholar. And to those who watch, we can affirm the nature
and worth of the truly modern university. This is the chal
lenge of PACE; far from having concluded last Thursday, it
has just begun.
