# Stegner Poses Dilemma Of Creative Westerner
## 
### DICK ASTLE 
("Born a Square —The West
erner's Dilemma" by Wallace
Sterner, Jan. issue The Atlantic
Monthly.)
"From |the Westerner's! point
of view, the double with Moiern
Man, as he reads about him in
fiction, is that Modern Man has
quit." This is Wallace Stegner,
Professor of English and Direc
tor of the Creative Writing De
partment at Stanford, writing in
the current issue of The Alia, tic
Monthly, "Born a Square — The
Westerner's Dilemma."
The article purports to consider
the problems of the young West
ern writer in light of Mr. Steg
ner's experience, and it does that.
But, as is evident from the quota
tion above, it does more. "Some
part of our most advertised re
cent fiction," says Professor Steg
ner, "is sick, out of its mind, and
out of the moral world. . . . An
other part is simply the corrupt
answer to a corrupt demand . . .
I speak of a necrophilic playing
with despair, which is nothing
to be played with." The problem,
on the other hand, of the West
ern writer is that he is not sick
or corrupt, not oppressed, not "a
Negro of the Jewish faith [who|
picks up a living as a hustler in
a homosexual joint." These two
problems, that of the writer and
that of the writing, are curiously
opposite to each other. The article
presents a possible cure for both
of these problems simultaneously.
THE WESTERNER IS a sort
of majority product," middle-class
and provincial, "he still half be
lieves in the American Dream."
But Modern American fiction, as
serts Stegner — and who will
deny it? — "is being written
mainly by members of minority
groups either wronged by his sort

of middle-class world or angrily
at odds with it, contemptuous of
its limitations." The young West
ern writer finds this out very
early on, and realizes that, as he
is, basically a "square," he is "so
unfashionable as to be practically
voiceless." What can he do? It is
tempting to imitate, but "that
temptation is fatal," he is not,
for example, a Jew — if he is
Stegner is not talking about him
—"he knows he is no Jew, doesn't
think like one, and can't feel like
one, has neither the cultural stam
ina nor the special humor nor
the special masochism." Basically,
you can't write about something
you know nothing about, all your
successful characters must be ex
tensions of yourself.
So the Western writer must
write about himself, about his
own country, but this has always
failed him. He has tried history,
but history is dead. "The celebra
tion of the heroic and mythic
frontier" is no longer sufficient,
if indeed it ever was. On the other
hand, the West does not seem to
have a present. It does not have
"a common conscience, a common
guilt," etc., or, if it has these
things, they are still to be dis
covered.
WHAT IS TIIE answer then?
The Westerner must bo himself in
his own "rootless, culturally half
baked" society, must remember
this weakness of his society but
also this strength, that the West
"is the New World's last chance
to be something better, the only
American Society still malleable
enough to be formed." He must
remember also that he "Still half
believes in the American Dream,"
and that "There is no reason to
turn misery, perversion, over
sexed hostility, and hatred of life
into a rule of the universe, the
norm of human experience."

for example, a Jew — if he is
Stegner is not talking about him
—"he knows he is no Jew, doesn't
think like one, and can't feel like
one, has neither the cultural stam
ina nor the special humor nor
the special masochism." Basically,
you can't write about something
you know nothing about, all your
successful characters must be ex
tensions of yourself.
So the Western writer must
write about himself, about his
own country, but this has always
failed him. He has tried history,
but history is dead. "The celebra
tion of the heroic and mythic
frontier" is no longer sufficient,
if indeed it ever was. On the other
hand, the West does not seem to
have a present. It does not have
"a common conscience, a common
guilt," etc., or, if it has these
things, they are still to be dis
covered.
WHAT IS TIIE answer then?
The Westerner must bo himself in
his own "rootless, culturally half
baked" society, must remember
this weakness of his society but
also this strength, that the West
"is the New World's last chance
to be something better, the only
American Society still malleable
enough to be formed." He must
remember also that he "Still half
believes in the American Dream,"
and that "There is no reason to
turn misery, perversion, over
sexed hostility, and hatred of life
into a rule of the universe, the
norm of human experience."
("Born a Square —The West
erner's Dilemma" by Wallace
Sterner, Jan. issue The Atlantic
Monthly.)
"From |the Westerner's! point
of view, the double with Moiern
Man, as he reads about him in
fiction, is that Modern Man has
quit." This is Wallace Stegner,
Professor of English and Direc
tor of the Creative Writing De
partment at Stanford, writing in
the current issue of The Alia, tic
Monthly, "Born a Square — The
Westerner's Dilemma."
The article purports to consider
the problems of the young West
ern writer in light of Mr. Steg
ner's experience, and it does that.
But, as is evident from the quota
tion above, it does more. "Some
part of our most advertised re
cent fiction," says Professor Steg
ner, "is sick, out of its mind, and
out of the moral world. . . . An
other part is simply the corrupt
answer to a corrupt demand . . .
I speak of a necrophilic playing
with despair, which is nothing
to be played with." The problem,
on the other hand, of the West
ern writer is that he is not sick
or corrupt, not oppressed, not "a
Negro of the Jewish faith [who|
picks up a living as a hustler in
a homosexual joint." These two
problems, that of the writer and
that of the writing, are curiously
opposite to each other. The article
presents a possible cure for both
of these problems simultaneously.
THE WESTERNER IS a sort
of majority product," middle-class
and provincial, "he still half be
lieves in the American Dream."
But Modern American fiction, as
serts Stegner — and who will
deny it? — "is being written
mainly by members of minority
groups either wronged by his sort

of middle-class world or angrily
at odds with it, contemptuous of
its limitations." The young West
ern writer finds this out very
early on, and realizes that, as he
is, basically a "square," he is "so
unfashionable as to be practically
voiceless." What can he do? It is
tempting to imitate, but "that
temptation is fatal," he is not,
for example, a Jew — if he is
Stegner is not talking about him
—"he knows he is no Jew, doesn't
think like one, and can't feel like
one, has neither the cultural stam
ina nor the special humor nor
