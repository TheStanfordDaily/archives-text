PROF. BROWN CLARIFIES
Editor, The Daily:
May I correct one misunder
standing in the otherwise very
fair account of an interview with
me published in Thursday's
Daily? I am quoted as saying that
"We now live in a pluralistic cul
ture with Catholicism, Judaism
and Mohammedanism represent
ing real options for Americans."
What I said, or at least meant to
say, was "Catholicism, Judaism
and Protestantism."
When, on other occasions, I
have made this point about Amer
ican religious puralism, I have
often been accused of harboring
a secret "Protestant death wish."
If that is so (and I don't know
it), I would at least like to assure
your readers that it is not as ex
plicit as the quotation attributed
to me would suggest.

ON ARCHITECT GOFF
Editor, The Daily:
We were privileged to have on
campus one week ago Wednesday
one of the great architects of this
or indeed of any century, Bruce
Goff. I have been moved by the
two 'News' articles concerning
his visit to write in Ihe hope of
clarifying certain misleading sug
gestions contained in those arti
cles.
First, what can it mean to say
that Goff designs "in the style of
Wright?" As well might one say
that Beethoven composed in the
style of Bach! I submit that analy
sis of Ihe works of the architects
themselves reveals two distinct
creative minds at work, each pro
claiming a unique message in the
power of art surpassingly rend
ered.
Second, in speaking to the as
sembled audience in the Museum,
Mr. Goff's remarks inveighed
principally against "Commonism,"
not communism. He noted the
strangling presence of 'common
ism' in our day, and pointed out
that the transition from 'common
ism' to 'communism' is slight in
deed. Our salvation in the West,
he maintains, is in a society of
un-common, self-reliant individ
uals. Our destruction will follow
swiftly on the heels of a modu
lated, conforming, colorless so
ciety.
Third, what possibly can News
correspondent Warnick mean by
saying that Mr. Goff's design of
the Price home (a masterwork) is
"gaudy and involved?" By what
standard are we to measure? If
the Price home is "gaudy," what
epithets will Mr. Warnick hurl at
nature when the acacia, or the
tulips, or the poppies step forth
to bloom in Ihe full measure of
their glory? And shall we dismiss
the B Minor Mass, or the N in th
Symphony, or Chartes, or Fall
ingwater, or Roncliamp on the
grounds that they are 'involved'?
Out of respect for Mr. Goff,
may it be said here that his work
conveys a beauty and joy and se
renity that speak of some higher
Kingdom. And he beckons, in the
spirit of another master — "O
Freunde, nicht diese Tone! Son
dern last uns angenehemere an
stimmen. und freudenvollere." —
O Friends, not these tones. Let
us sing a more joyful song!

SEQUOIA
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Sharon Cobb is to be con
gratulated for her vigorous con
tribution to the new Sequoia.
"Do You Always Drink Dead
Flies in Your Coffee" is an im
portant contribution to American
toilet art, and it should be wel
comed thirstily by all those who
are tired of bad printing on the
world's walls and stalls.
Dirtier than Miller, more im
aginative than Mailer, Miss Cobb
roams the pores and private parts
of her characters with biological
enthusiasm and an entertaining
dash of mental illness. Mailer, for
example, would never have been
able to carry through the startling
pimple imagery, and not even the
great Lawrence would have
thought of, "We sow in hopeless
ness and reap in pimples!" (Is
this supposed to be cosmic pro
fundity? Does the author have
a skin problem?)
I haven't any idea who Miss
Cobb is; but her avant-garbage
production is probably the silliest
piece of writing that has ever
leaked off the Sequoia's press.
Literature has its good "dirt,"
and its bad "dirt," bul Cobb's dirt
is just pointless. There is nothing
serious or real in the story, just
a lot of giggling in the bathroom
with some depressing sick-joke
sidelights. Her world of roman
candles and breasts without nip
ples is pretty hard to locate; and
if the author is attempting the
subtle point that this world lurks

secretly within each smutty one
of us, well, then maybe I've just
never lived.
Cobb's garbage reads like a
mammoth dirty joke, and as such
it can't help being funny. But Ihe
dirtiest joke of all is that the
Sequoia can pass this .stuff off
as creative art.

OSWALD
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Eugene Hunn lays claim
to sharing remorse with the
American people over Ihe tragedy
of Mr. Kennedy's death. Whether
"tragic" is the appropriate word
and whether Mr. Hunn is attuned
to this higher sentiment, he obvi
ously does share with a great
many people a presumption in
the guilt of an accused individual,
in this case that of L. H. Oswald.
In the face of conflicting re
ports and machinations between
at least the Dallas police, FBI,
and Secret Service, Mr. Hunn
might have been presumed to
withhold judgment, particularly
with respect to a "tragedy" of
such magnitude. Consider, for ex
ample, that the famous palm
print on the rifle has been denied
by the FBI; a man who has eaten
fried chicken with out leaving
grease impressions anywhere in
sight might be given the benefit
of at least temporary presump
tion of innocence; let us recall
that Gov. Connally and his wife
both agree that the shots were
fired after they had passed the
building — now consider that the
examining physicians claimed (at
least intially) that the wound in
Kennedy's throat was an entrance
wound; might we not wonder how
bullets fired from behind the car
came to enter from the front;
the cabbie who picked up Oswald
after the latter left the building
has Oswald logged in at 12:30
(shooting at 12:31); has anyone
heard of a ballistical confirma
tion that the bullets found in the
body were in fact discharged from
the alleged murder rifle; is it
strange that Oswald, an "ordi
nary marksman" could fire three
shots in five seconds with remark
able accuracy, when purported
experts have since been unable
to duplicate this feat with a simi
lar rifle and under much less
tense circumstances; does it ar
rest Mr. Hunn's attention that the
clincher of the "murder map" has
also been repudiated by the FBI?
Now all of this information has
been available in the public media,
and has recently been gathered to
gether by one Mark Lane in the
Dec. 19 issue of the National
Guardian, which in turn was spe
cifically discussed in the N.Y.
Times. Could Mr. Hunn and the
fellow sharers of his high moral
tone be expected to indulge them
selves in a sordid examination of
purported facts before subjecting
us to transports of indignation?

SPEAKING SPACE
Editor, The Daily:
On Tuesday evening Professor
Edward Teller, "noted atomic
physicist and 'father of the H
bomb,' " spoke in the Muir lounge
on "The Nuclear Debate in the
Atlantic Alliances." Over two hun
dred students were interested
enough to postpone their work
to hear him. As it turned out,
hear him was all that many could
do; and this through five or six
layers of "audience." Students
were forced to stand in the corri
dor and overflow onto the patio.
At the same time Reverend
Coffin, Chaplain of Yale Univer
sity, spoke in the Soto lounge on
sex and religion. As is the case
with most guest speakers at Stern
and Wilbur, there was standing
room only for latecomers.
A busy man who goes out of
his way to speak at Stanford
should be allowed the courtesy of
a room appropriate to the size of
the audience he may attract. Is
it just red tape that prevents
these gentlemen from using one
of Stanford's many fine audito
riums and lecture halls that lie
vacant nearly every night?
