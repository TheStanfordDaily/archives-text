# Kidnap of Moroccan Student Typical of Government
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
One sunny summer afternoon,
! three men in civilian dress walked
I into the offices of the National
Union of Moroccan Students
(UNEM) and asked to see the
president, Hamid Berada, claim
ing to be his friends. When he
appeared, they seized him sud
denly, forced him into their grey,
unmarked jeep, and drove off.
The next day, the government
controlled Moroccan radio c o in
firmed the 'arrest' of one Hamid
Berada. His trial, for alleged "sub
versive activities," would follow
shortly, the communique prom
ised. All this took place nearly
five months ago.
Soon after Berada's unortho
dox 'arrest,' the Moroccan govern
ment issued a series of circuitous
denials and ambiguous assur
ances, but these have gradually
dribbled off into nothingness.
There has been no trial. There has
been no news. What remains is
silence. Berada has, in effect, dis
appeared from the face of the
earth.
Berada's mysterious disappear
ance is by no means unique, and
this fact alone gives if a kind of
awful symbolic significance. Be
rada, according to all reliable
sources, was neither a conspira
tor nor an assassin. He was, how
ever, a vigorous opponent of the
policies and practices of the cur
rent regime. His crime was that
he said so all too publically, and
his fate bears eloquent witness
to the fact that political opposi
tion of any sort is a deadly occu
pation in Morocco today.
HASSEN II is king, and while
he rules, terror reigns — this
is the gist of the reports of in
vestigators in Morocco. The king's
democratic-facade of a govern
ment, unable to win at the polls
despite the crudest sort of fraud
and chicanery, has discovered and
implimented an elementary and
ancient formula for political suc
cess: The only good opposition
is a silent opposition. The demo
cratic processes of this alleged
constitutional monarchy have ap
parently been reduced to the level
of farce.
On December 7, 1962, the gov
ernment's constitutional referen
dum, boycotted by the UNEM and
the major opposition parties,
failed by more than a million
votes, despite strong official pres
sures. The UNEM continued its
program of strikes and political
opposition well into the next year.
Then, on May 17, 1963, the gov
ernment tried again, this time
in the national legislative elec
tions. Every conceivable pressure
was brought to bear. Opposition
candidates were arrested as they
went to the polls to vote. Never
theless, at th e final count, the
government's party, the Front
for the Defence of Constitutional
Institutions (FDIC), received only
thirty-five percent of the vote.
Hassen ll's regime did the only
thing possible from its point of
view; it simply invalidated a suf
ficient number of the opposition's
electees, and announced to the
country that the FDIC had at

tained a majority in the elective
assembly.
Two months later, during th e
municipal elections, the polling
places were deserted in protest.
Nevertheless, the Moroccan gov
vernment announced that more
than seventy percent of the elig
ible voters had gone to the polls.
In the meantime, Hassen's regime
had moved to silence protest in
a much more active manner. On
July 16, 1963, government spokes
men announced the discovery of
a 'plot' to assassinate Hassen and
arrested more than one hundred
of the leaders of the major oppo
sition party, The National Union
of Popular Forces (UNFP), at an
open UNFP meeting at the
party's national headquarters in
Casablanca.
SINCE THIS INITIAL mass
roundup of its opponents, Has
sen's special police, operating os
tensibly under the emergency con
ditions necessitated by the 'plot,'
have arrested and kidnapped lit
erally thousands of progressives,
including many students whose

political activities never went be
yond concerns of the UNEM. Re
ports from Morocco indicate that
prisoners are often subjected to
the most primative of torture
methods and are consistently be
ing denied the right to communi
cate with their families and law
yers. The total count of those
arrested and jailed in this lengthy
purge now reaches well over
5,000.
During this systematic cam
paign of terror, president Berada
and the UNEM remained adamant
in their stand against the govern
ment. As repression mounted,
their criticisms sharpened. In
April of 1963, on the eve of the
legislative elections, the UNEM
Council came to the point with

this declaration: "... The Moroc
can citizen, aware of his respon
sibilities, face to face with this
situation, has the right to feel
apprehensive about the establish
ment of a fascist regime in Moroc
co."
A wave of arrests of UNEM
members followed. There were
more incidents of torture and sev
eral reports of death.
The Eighth UNEM Congress,
which met in Casablanca on July
30 and 31 and August 1 and 2 of
last year, was all too aware of
the tense political situation exist
ing. Seventy-five delegates were
unable to attend, because they
were either missing or under ar
rest. At this time the UNEM de
clared: "that abolition of this re
gime is the first condition for
this country to emerge from the
open or latent crisis in which it
has constantly been floundering
ever since it became independent.
. . . Inspired by the best Nazi
traditions, the royal regime is
thus trying to justify itself by
spreading the outworn myth
about this 'conspiracy,' hoping
that the real plot which it is con
tinually drumming up against
progressive and national forces,
will be passed over in silence."
LESS THAN ONE week after
the Congress, president Berada
was arrested at his home by a
member of Hassen's special po
lice force. He was held for three
days without charge or warrent,
questioned intensively, and then
mysteriously released. Nearly
three weeks later, on August 28,
1963, Berada held a press confer
ence folowing a meeting of the
Secretariate of the Confederation
of Maghreb Students. His state
ment was open sedition: " . . .
while setting out on the same
path of violence as French colon
ialism and in having recourse to
the same methods, such as mass
arrest, kidnapping, torture and
murder, the monarchical regime
in Morocco should be denounced
and combated by the peoples of
the Maghreb and by all demo
crats throughout the world."
These were Berada's last words.
Only a few hours after his press
conference, he disappeared — per
haps forever.
Several months later, the Morac
can Security authorities moved
against the Executive Committee
of the UNEM, forcing it to go
underground. The decimated lead
ership of the UNEM went into
hiding. The opposition, for the
moment at least, was silent.
Was Berada a "subversive" as
the Moroccan government m a i n
tained? Perhaps — but if so, he
was a subversive by necessity,
propelled toward an extreme posi

tion by repressive forces entirely
in the hands of Hassen's regime.
Several weeks before his final
'arrest,' Berada explained hi s
position in a taped interview with
a represenative of the Coordinat
ing Secretariate of the National
Unions of Students (COSEC).
(This interview appeared in the
July-August isue of COSEC's pub
lication, The Student. ) His predic
tion for the future of Moroccan
stability was dark indeed: "Up to
now we have been living in un
certainty. On the one hand we
knew that any reform in the set
up of the royalist regime was im
possible, but on the other hand
we did not cease to use ordinary
political means to attempt to rea
lize the radical transformations
necessary since the declaration
of independence. But I think this
contradiction . . . will disappear
in the new phase. It is the regime
which is going to force the oppo
sition to resort to new measures.
. . . Violence will almost certainly
be the order of the day for the
coming months. . . ."
BERADA spoke bitterly of the
betrayed hopes of Ihe Moroccan
people: "In their fight a g a in s t
colonialism the Moroccan people
have not had as their aim the dis
appearance of foreigners, but
rather an increase in their stand-

ard of living and also the achieve
ment of a society where dignity
has a place, where education
exists, where a national culture
exists. . . . After independence,
the people as a whole were ready
to mobilize, were ready to make
grave sacrifices, to see their
aspirations realized. What ha p
pened? Absolutely nothing hap
pened. Independence was simply
the replacement of colonialist
masters by feudal masters. Ex
ploitation was Moroccanized."
To those who questioned the
motives behind his political oppo
sition Berada explained, "We are
fighting against the regime not
out of some sort of romanticism,
not because of some kind of mod
ernism, not because monarchy is
archaic. It is not very pleasant
to see a monarchy where <ne men
kiss the hand of the king but
I believe that the struggle of the
Moroccan students goes somewhat
beyond these annoying and super
ficial things. For let it be said
that Moroccan students would not
mind kissing the hand of the king
if the king would undertake
agrarian reform. We know very
well that the king whose hand
people kiss is a king who is in
capable of undertaking agrarian
reform."
Berada's final words contained
a plea before the court of world
opinion — a plea to end the myth
of "Morocco the Democracy." Not
knowing that he himself would
soon be abducted, Berada re
counted a series of brutal inci
dents involving students arrests,
tortures, deaths. He concluded,
"We know that when crimes such
as these occured in Algeria under
colonialist domination they stirred
the emotions of the whole world,
galvanizing what one could call
the universal conscience. Well?
We are scandalized that the
events should pass in silence in
the press and before outside opin
ion. Under these condtions, the
role of the Moroccan students is
to do all in their power to see
that this mystification comes to
an end."

appeared, they seized him sud
denly, forced him into their grey,
unmarked jeep, and drove off.
The next day, the government
controlled Moroccan radio c o in
firmed the 'arrest' of one Hamid
Berada. His trial, for alleged "sub
versive activities," would follow
shortly, the communique prom
ised. All this took place nearly
five months ago.
Soon after Berada's unortho
dox 'arrest,' the Moroccan govern
ment issued a series of circuitous
denials and ambiguous assur
ances, but these have gradually
dribbled off into nothingness.
There has been no trial. There has
been no news. What remains is
silence. Berada has, in effect, dis
appeared from the face of the
earth.
Berada's mysterious disappear
ance is by no means unique, and
this fact alone gives if a kind of
awful symbolic significance. Be
rada, according to all reliable
sources, was neither a conspira
tor nor an assassin. He was, how
ever, a vigorous opponent of the
policies and practices of the cur
rent regime. His crime was that
he said so all too publically, and
his fate bears eloquent witness
to the fact that political opposi
tion of any sort is a deadly occu
pation in Morocco today.
HASSEN II is king, and while
he rules, terror reigns — this
is the gist of the reports of in
vestigators in Morocco. The king's
democratic-facade of a govern
ment, unable to win at the polls
despite the crudest sort of fraud
and chicanery, has discovered and
implimented an elementary and
ancient formula for political suc
cess: The only good opposition
is a silent opposition. The demo
cratic processes of this alleged
constitutional monarchy have ap
parently been reduced to the level
of farce.
On December 7, 1962, the gov
ernment's constitutional referen
dum, boycotted by the UNEM and
the major opposition parties,
failed by more than a million
votes, despite strong official pres
sures. The UNEM continued its
program of strikes and political
opposition well into the next year.
Then, on May 17, 1963, the gov
ernment tried again, this time
in the national legislative elec
tions. Every conceivable pressure
was brought to bear. Opposition
candidates were arrested as they
went to the polls to vote. Never
theless, at th e final count, the
government's party, the Front
for the Defence of Constitutional
Institutions (FDIC), received only
thirty-five percent of the vote.
Hassen ll's regime did the only
thing possible from its point of
view; it simply invalidated a suf
ficient number of the opposition's
electees, and announced to the
country that the FDIC had at

tained a majority in the elective
assembly.
Two months later, during th e
municipal elections, the polling
places were deserted in protest.
Nevertheless, the Moroccan gov
vernment announced that more
than seventy percent of the elig
ible voters had gone to the polls.
In the meantime, Hassen's regime
had moved to silence protest in
a much more active manner. On
July 16, 1963, government spokes
men announced the discovery of
a 'plot' to assassinate Hassen and
arrested more than one hundred
of the leaders of the major oppo
sition party, The National Union
of Popular Forces (UNFP), at an
open UNFP meeting at the
party's national headquarters in
Casablanca.
SINCE THIS INITIAL mass
roundup of its opponents, Has
sen's special police, operating os
tensibly under the emergency con
ditions necessitated by the 'plot,'
have arrested and kidnapped lit
erally thousands of progressives,
including many students whose

political activities never went be
yond concerns of the UNEM. Re
ports from Morocco indicate that
prisoners are often subjected to
the most primative of torture
methods and are consistently be
ing denied the right to communi
cate with their families and law
yers. The total count of those
arrested and jailed in this lengthy
purge now reaches well over
5,000.
During this systematic cam
paign of terror, president Berada
and the UNEM remained adamant
in their stand against the govern
ment. As repression mounted,
their criticisms sharpened. In
April of 1963, on the eve of the
legislative elections, the UNEM
Council came to the point with

this declaration: "... The Moroc
can citizen, aware of his respon
sibilities, face to face with this
situation, has the right to feel
apprehensive about the establish
ment of a fascist regime in Moroc
co."
A wave of arrests of UNEM
members followed. There were
more incidents of torture and sev
eral reports of death.
The Eighth UNEM Congress,
which met in Casablanca on July
30 and 31 and August 1 and 2 of
last year, was all too aware of
the tense political situation exist
ing. Seventy-five delegates were
unable to attend, because they
were either missing or under ar
rest. At this time the UNEM de
clared: "that abolition of this re
gime is the first condition for
this country to emerge from the
open or latent crisis in which it
has constantly been floundering
ever since it became independent.
. . . Inspired by the best Nazi
traditions, the royal regime is
thus trying to justify itself by
spreading the outworn myth
about this 'conspiracy,' hoping
that the real plot which it is con
tinually drumming up against
progressive and national forces,
will be passed over in silence."
LESS THAN ONE week after
the Congress, president Berada
was arrested at his home by a
member of Hassen's special po
lice force. He was held for three
days without charge or warrent,
questioned intensively, and then
mysteriously released. Nearly
three weeks later, on August 28,
1963, Berada held a press confer
ence folowing a meeting of the
Secretariate of the Confederation
of Maghreb Students. His state
ment was open sedition: " . . .
while setting out on the same
path of violence as French colon
ialism and in having recourse to
the same methods, such as mass
arrest, kidnapping, torture and
murder, the monarchical regime
in Morocco should be denounced
and combated by the peoples of
the Maghreb and by all demo
crats throughout the world."
These were Berada's last words.
Only a few hours after his press
conference, he disappeared — per
haps forever.
Several months later, the Morac
can Security authorities moved
against the Executive Committee
of the UNEM, forcing it to go
underground. The decimated lead
ership of the UNEM went into
hiding. The opposition, for the
moment at least, was silent.
Was Berada a "subversive" as
the Moroccan government m a i n
tained? Perhaps — but if so, he
was a subversive by necessity,
propelled toward an extreme posi

tion by repressive forces entirely
in the hands of Hassen's regime.
Several weeks before his final
'arrest,' Berada explained hi s
position in a taped interview with
a represenative of the Coordinat
ing Secretariate of the National
Unions of Students (COSEC).
(This interview appeared in the
July-August isue of COSEC's pub
lication, The Student. ) His predic
tion for the future of Moroccan
stability was dark indeed: "Up to
now we have been living in un
certainty. On the one hand we
knew that any reform in the set
up of the royalist regime was im
possible, but on the other hand
we did not cease to use ordinary
political means to attempt to rea
lize the radical transformations
necessary since the declaration
of independence. But I think this
contradiction . . . will disappear
in the new phase. It is the regime
which is going to force the oppo
sition to resort to new measures.
. . . Violence will almost certainly
be the order of the day for the
coming months. . . ."
BERADA spoke bitterly of the
betrayed hopes of Ihe Moroccan
people: "In their fight a g a in s t
colonialism the Moroccan people
have not had as their aim the dis
appearance of foreigners, but
rather an increase in their stand-

ard of living and also the achieve
ment of a society where dignity
has a place, where education
exists, where a national culture
exists. . . . After independence,
the people as a whole were ready
to mobilize, were ready to make
grave sacrifices, to see their
aspirations realized. What ha p
pened? Absolutely nothing hap
pened. Independence was simply
the replacement of colonialist
masters by feudal masters. Ex
ploitation was Moroccanized."
To those who questioned the
motives behind his political oppo
sition Berada explained, "We are
fighting against the regime not
out of some sort of romanticism,
not because of some kind of mod
ernism, not because monarchy is
archaic. It is not very pleasant
to see a monarchy where <ne men
kiss the hand of the king but
I believe that the struggle of the
Moroccan students goes somewhat
beyond these annoying and super
ficial things. For let it be said
that Moroccan students would not
mind kissing the hand of the king
if the king would undertake
agrarian reform. We know very
well that the king whose hand
people kiss is a king who is in
capable of undertaking agrarian
reform."
Berada's final words contained
a plea before the court of world
opinion — a plea to end the myth
of "Morocco the Democracy." Not
knowing that he himself would
soon be abducted, Berada re
counted a series of brutal inci
dents involving students arrests,
tortures, deaths. He concluded,
"We know that when crimes such
as these occured in Algeria under
colonialist domination they stirred
the emotions of the whole world,
galvanizing what one could call
the universal conscience. Well?
We are scandalized that the
events should pass in silence in
the press and before outside opin
ion. Under these condtions, the
role of the Moroccan students is
to do all in their power to see
that this mystification comes to
an end."

versive activities," would follow
shortly, the communique prom
ised. All this took place nearly
five months ago.
Soon after Berada's unortho
dox 'arrest,' the Moroccan govern
ment issued a series of circuitous
denials and ambiguous assur
ances, but these have gradually
dribbled off into nothingness.
There has been no trial. There has
been no news. What remains is
silence. Berada has, in effect, dis
appeared from the face of the
earth.
Berada's mysterious disappear
ance is by no means unique, and
this fact alone gives if a kind of
awful symbolic significance. Be
rada, according to all reliable
sources, was neither a conspira
tor nor an assassin. He was, how
ever, a vigorous opponent of the
policies and practices of the cur
rent regime. His crime was that
he said so all too publically, and
his fate bears eloquent witness
to the fact that political opposi
tion of any sort is a deadly occu
pation in Morocco today.
HASSEN II is king, and while
he rules, terror reigns — this
is the gist of the reports of in
vestigators in Morocco. The king's
democratic-facade of a govern
ment, unable to win at the polls
despite the crudest sort of fraud
and chicanery, has discovered and
implimented an elementary and
ancient formula for political suc
cess: The only good opposition
is a silent opposition. The demo
cratic processes of this alleged
constitutional monarchy have ap
parently been reduced to the level
of farce.
On December 7, 1962, the gov
ernment's constitutional referen
dum, boycotted by the UNEM and
the major opposition parties,
failed by more than a million
votes, despite strong official pres
sures. The UNEM continued its
program of strikes and political
opposition well into the next year.
Then, on May 17, 1963, the gov
ernment tried again, this time
in the national legislative elec
tions. Every conceivable pressure
was brought to bear. Opposition
candidates were arrested as they
went to the polls to vote. Never
theless, at th e final count, the
government's party, the Front
for the Defence of Constitutional
Institutions (FDIC), received only
thirty-five percent of the vote.
Hassen ll's regime did the only
thing possible from its point of
view; it simply invalidated a suf
ficient number of the opposition's
electees, and announced to the
country that the FDIC had at

tained a majority in the elective
assembly.
Two months later, during th e
municipal elections, the polling
places were deserted in protest.
Nevertheless, the Moroccan gov
vernment announced that more
than seventy percent of the elig
ible voters had gone to the polls.
In the meantime, Hassen's regime
had moved to silence protest in
a much more active manner. On
July 16, 1963, government spokes
men announced the discovery of
a 'plot' to assassinate Hassen and
arrested more than one hundred
of the leaders of the major oppo
sition party, The National Union
of Popular Forces (UNFP), at an
open UNFP meeting at the
party's national headquarters in
Casablanca.
SINCE THIS INITIAL mass
roundup of its opponents, Has
sen's special police, operating os
tensibly under the emergency con
ditions necessitated by the 'plot,'
have arrested and kidnapped lit
erally thousands of progressives,
including many students whose

political activities never went be
yond concerns of the UNEM. Re
ports from Morocco indicate that
prisoners are often subjected to
the most primative of torture
methods and are consistently be
ing denied the right to communi
cate with their families and law
yers. The total count of those
arrested and jailed in this lengthy
purge now reaches well over
5,000.
During this systematic cam
paign of terror, president Berada
and the UNEM remained adamant
in their stand against the govern
ment. As repression mounted,
their criticisms sharpened. In
April of 1963, on the eve of the
legislative elections, the UNEM
Council came to the point with

this declaration: "... The Moroc
can citizen, aware of his respon
sibilities, face to face with this
situation, has the right to feel
apprehensive about the establish
ment of a fascist regime in Moroc
co."
A wave of arrests of UNEM
members followed. There were
more incidents of torture and sev
eral reports of death.
The Eighth UNEM Congress,
which met in Casablanca on July
30 and 31 and August 1 and 2 of
last year, was all too aware of
the tense political situation exist
ing. Seventy-five delegates were
unable to attend, because they
were either missing or under ar
rest. At this time the UNEM de
clared: "that abolition of this re
gime is the first condition for
this country to emerge from the
open or latent crisis in which it
has constantly been floundering
ever since it became independent.
. . . Inspired by the best Nazi
traditions, the royal regime is
thus trying to justify itself by
spreading the outworn myth
about this 'conspiracy,' hoping
that the real plot which it is con
tinually drumming up against
progressive and national forces,
will be passed over in silence."
LESS THAN ONE week after
the Congress, president Berada
was arrested at his home by a
member of Hassen's special po
lice force. He was held for three
days without charge or warrent,
questioned intensively, and then
mysteriously released. Nearly
three weeks later, on August 28,
1963, Berada held a press confer
ence folowing a meeting of the
Secretariate of the Confederation
of Maghreb Students. His state
ment was open sedition: " . . .
while setting out on the same
path of violence as French colon
ialism and in having recourse to
the same methods, such as mass
arrest, kidnapping, torture and
murder, the monarchical regime
in Morocco should be denounced
and combated by the peoples of
the Maghreb and by all demo
crats throughout the world."
These were Berada's last words.
Only a few hours after his press
conference, he disappeared — per
haps forever.
Several months later, the Morac
can Security authorities moved
against the Executive Committee
of the UNEM, forcing it to go
underground. The decimated lead
ership of the UNEM went into
hiding. The opposition, for the
moment at least, was silent.
Was Berada a "subversive" as
the Moroccan government m a i n
tained? Perhaps — but if so, he
was a subversive by necessity,
propelled toward an extreme posi

tion by repressive forces entirely
in the hands of Hassen's regime.
Several weeks before his final
'arrest,' Berada explained hi s
position in a taped interview with
a represenative of the Coordinat
ing Secretariate of the National
Unions of Students (COSEC).
(This interview appeared in the
July-August isue of COSEC's pub
lication, The Student. ) His predic
tion for the future of Moroccan
stability was dark indeed: "Up to
now we have been living in un
certainty. On the one hand we
knew that any reform in the set
up of the royalist regime was im
possible, but on the other hand
we did not cease to use ordinary
political means to attempt to rea
lize the radical transformations
necessary since the declaration
of independence. But I think this
contradiction . . . will disappear
in the new phase. It is the regime
which is going to force the oppo
sition to resort to new measures.
. . . Violence will almost certainly
be the order of the day for the
coming months. . . ."
BERADA spoke bitterly of the
betrayed hopes of Ihe Moroccan
people: "In their fight a g a in s t
colonialism the Moroccan people
have not had as their aim the dis
appearance of foreigners, but
rather an increase in their stand-

ard of living and also the achieve
ment of a society where dignity
has a place, where education
exists, where a national culture
exists. . . . After independence,
the people as a whole were ready
to mobilize, were ready to make
grave sacrifices, to see their
aspirations realized. What ha p
pened? Absolutely nothing hap
pened. Independence was simply
the replacement of colonialist
masters by feudal masters. Ex
ploitation was Moroccanized."
To those who questioned the
motives behind his political oppo
sition Berada explained, "We are
fighting against the regime not
out of some sort of romanticism,
not because of some kind of mod
ernism, not because monarchy is
archaic. It is not very pleasant
to see a monarchy where <ne men
kiss the hand of the king but
I believe that the struggle of the
Moroccan students goes somewhat
beyond these annoying and super
ficial things. For let it be said
that Moroccan students would not
mind kissing the hand of the king
if the king would undertake
agrarian reform. We know very
well that the king whose hand
people kiss is a king who is in
capable of undertaking agrarian
reform."
Berada's final words contained
a plea before the court of world
opinion — a plea to end the myth
of "Morocco the Democracy." Not
knowing that he himself would
soon be abducted, Berada re
counted a series of brutal inci
dents involving students arrests,
tortures, deaths. He concluded,
"We know that when crimes such
as these occured in Algeria under
colonialist domination they stirred
the emotions of the whole world,
galvanizing what one could call
the universal conscience. Well?
We are scandalized that the
events should pass in silence in
the press and before outside opin
ion. Under these condtions, the
role of the Moroccan students is
to do all in their power to see
that this mystification comes to
an end."

KING HASSEN II
One sunny summer afternoon,

I into the offices of the National

denials and ambiguous assur
ances, but these have gradually
dribbled off into nothingness.
There has been no trial. There has
been no news. What remains is
silence. Berada has, in effect, dis
appeared from the face of the
earth.
Berada's mysterious disappear
ance is by no means unique, and
this fact alone gives if a kind of
awful symbolic significance. Be
rada, according to all reliable
sources, was neither a conspira
tor nor an assassin. He was, how
ever, a vigorous opponent of the
policies and practices of the cur
rent regime. His crime was that
he said so all too publically, and
his fate bears eloquent witness
to the fact that political opposi
tion of any sort is a deadly occu
pation in Morocco today.
HASSEN II is king, and while
he rules, terror reigns — this
is the gist of the reports of in
vestigators in Morocco. The king's
democratic-facade of a govern
ment, unable to win at the polls
despite the crudest sort of fraud
and chicanery, has discovered and
implimented an elementary and
ancient formula for political suc
cess: The only good opposition
is a silent opposition. The demo
cratic processes of this alleged
constitutional monarchy have ap
parently been reduced to the level
of farce.
On December 7, 1962, the gov
ernment's constitutional referen
dum, boycotted by the UNEM and
the major opposition parties,
failed by more than a million
votes, despite strong official pres
sures. The UNEM continued its
program of strikes and political
opposition well into the next year.
Then, on May 17, 1963, the gov
ernment tried again, this time
in the national legislative elec
tions. Every conceivable pressure
was brought to bear. Opposition
candidates were arrested as they
went to the polls to vote. Never
theless, at th e final count, the
government's party, the Front
for the Defence of Constitutional
Institutions (FDIC), received only
thirty-five percent of the vote.
Hassen ll's regime did the only
thing possible from its point of
view; it simply invalidated a suf
ficient number of the opposition's
electees, and announced to the
country that the FDIC had at

tained a majority in the elective
assembly.
Two months later, during th e
municipal elections, the polling
places were deserted in protest.
Nevertheless, the Moroccan gov
vernment announced that more
than seventy percent of the elig
ible voters had gone to the polls.
In the meantime, Hassen's regime
had moved to silence protest in
a much more active manner. On
July 16, 1963, government spokes
men announced the discovery of
a 'plot' to assassinate Hassen and
arrested more than one hundred
of the leaders of the major oppo
sition party, The National Union
of Popular Forces (UNFP), at an
open UNFP meeting at the
party's national headquarters in
Casablanca.
SINCE THIS INITIAL mass
roundup of its opponents, Has
sen's special police, operating os
tensibly under the emergency con
ditions necessitated by the 'plot,'
have arrested and kidnapped lit
erally thousands of progressives,
including many students whose

political activities never went be
yond concerns of the UNEM. Re
ports from Morocco indicate that
prisoners are often subjected to
the most primative of torture
methods and are consistently be
ing denied the right to communi
cate with their families and law
yers. The total count of those
arrested and jailed in this lengthy
purge now reaches well over
5,000.
During this systematic cam
paign of terror, president Berada
and the UNEM remained adamant
in their stand against the govern
ment. As repression mounted,
their criticisms sharpened. In
April of 1963, on the eve of the
legislative elections, the UNEM
Council came to the point with

this declaration: "... The Moroc
can citizen, aware of his respon
sibilities, face to face with this
situation, has the right to feel
apprehensive about the establish
ment of a fascist regime in Moroc
co."
A wave of arrests of UNEM
members followed. There were
more incidents of torture and sev
eral reports of death.
The Eighth UNEM Congress,
which met in Casablanca on July
30 and 31 and August 1 and 2 of
last year, was all too aware of
the tense political situation exist
ing. Seventy-five delegates were
unable to attend, because they
were either missing or under ar
rest. At this time the UNEM de
clared: "that abolition of this re
gime is the first condition for
this country to emerge from the
open or latent crisis in which it
has constantly been floundering
ever since it became independent.
. . . Inspired by the best Nazi
traditions, the royal regime is
thus trying to justify itself by
spreading the outworn myth
about this 'conspiracy,' hoping
that the real plot which it is con
tinually drumming up against
progressive and national forces,
will be passed over in silence."
LESS THAN ONE week after
the Congress, president Berada
was arrested at his home by a
member of Hassen's special po
lice force. He was held for three
days without charge or warrent,
questioned intensively, and then
mysteriously released. Nearly
three weeks later, on August 28,
1963, Berada held a press confer
ence folowing a meeting of the
Secretariate of the Confederation
of Maghreb Students. His state
ment was open sedition: " . . .
while setting out on the same
path of violence as French colon
ialism and in having recourse to
the same methods, such as mass
arrest, kidnapping, torture and
murder, the monarchical regime
in Morocco should be denounced
and combated by the peoples of
the Maghreb and by all demo
crats throughout the world."
These were Berada's last words.
Only a few hours after his press
conference, he disappeared — per
haps forever.
Several months later, the Morac
can Security authorities moved
against the Executive Committee
of the UNEM, forcing it to go
underground. The decimated lead
ership of the UNEM went into
hiding. The opposition, for the
moment at least, was silent.
Was Berada a "subversive" as
the Moroccan government m a i n
tained? Perhaps — but if so, he
was a subversive by necessity,
propelled toward an extreme posi

tion by repressive forces entirely
in the hands of Hassen's regime.
Several weeks before his final
'arrest,' Berada explained hi s
position in a taped interview with
a represenative of the Coordinat
ing Secretariate of the National
Unions of Students (COSEC).
(This interview appeared in the
July-August isue of COSEC's pub
lication, The Student. ) His predic
tion for the future of Moroccan
stability was dark indeed: "Up to
now we have been living in un
certainty. On the one hand we
knew that any reform in the set
up of the royalist regime was im
possible, but on the other hand
we did not cease to use ordinary
political means to attempt to rea
lize the radical transformations
necessary since the declaration
of independence. But I think this
contradiction . . . will disappear
in the new phase. It is the regime
which is going to force the oppo
sition to resort to new measures.
. . . Violence will almost certainly
be the order of the day for the
coming months. . . ."
BERADA spoke bitterly of the
betrayed hopes of Ihe Moroccan
people: "In their fight a g a in s t
colonialism the Moroccan people
have not had as their aim the dis
appearance of foreigners, but
rather an increase in their stand-

ard of living and also the achieve
ment of a society where dignity
has a place, where education
exists, where a national culture
exists. . . . After independence,
the people as a whole were ready
to mobilize, were ready to make
grave sacrifices, to see their
aspirations realized. What ha p
pened? Absolutely nothing hap
pened. Independence was simply
the replacement of colonialist
masters by feudal masters. Ex
ploitation was Moroccanized."
To those who questioned the
motives behind his political oppo
sition Berada explained, "We are
fighting against the regime not
out of some sort of romanticism,
not because of some kind of mod
ernism, not because monarchy is
archaic. It is not very pleasant
to see a monarchy where <ne men
kiss the hand of the king but
I believe that the struggle of the
Moroccan students goes somewhat
beyond these annoying and super
ficial things. For let it be said
that Moroccan students would not
mind kissing the hand of the king
if the king would undertake
agrarian reform. We know very
well that the king whose hand
people kiss is a king who is in
capable of undertaking agrarian
reform."
Berada's final words contained
a plea before the court of world
opinion — a plea to end the myth
of "Morocco the Democracy." Not
knowing that he himself would
soon be abducted, Berada re
counted a series of brutal inci
dents involving students arrests,
tortures, deaths. He concluded,
"We know that when crimes such
as these occured in Algeria under
colonialist domination they stirred
the emotions of the whole world,
galvanizing what one could call
the universal conscience. Well?
We are scandalized that the
events should pass in silence in
the press and before outside opin
ion. Under these condtions, the
role of the Moroccan students is
to do all in their power to see
that this mystification comes to
an end."


HAMID BERADA


KING HASSEN II
One sunny summer afternoon,
! three men in civilian dress walked
I into the offices of the National
Union of Moroccan Students
(UNEM) and asked to see the
president, Hamid Berada, claim
ing to be his friends. When he
appeared, they seized him sud
denly, forced him into their grey,
unmarked jeep, and drove off.
The next day, the government
controlled Moroccan radio c o in

Berada. His trial, for alleged "sub

Berada's mysterious disappear
ance is by no means unique, and
this fact alone gives if a kind of
awful symbolic significance. Be
rada, according to all reliable
sources, was neither a conspira
tor nor an assassin. He was, how
ever, a vigorous opponent of the
policies and practices of the cur
rent regime. His crime was that
he said so all too publically, and
his fate bears eloquent witness
to the fact that political opposi
tion of any sort is a deadly occu
pation in Morocco today.
HASSEN II is king, and while
he rules, terror reigns — this
is the gist of the reports of in
vestigators in Morocco. The king's
democratic-facade of a govern
ment, unable to win at the polls
despite the crudest sort of fraud
and chicanery, has discovered and
implimented an elementary and
ancient formula for political suc
cess: The only good opposition
is a silent opposition. The demo
cratic processes of this alleged
constitutional monarchy have ap
parently been reduced to the level
of farce.
On December 7, 1962, the gov
ernment's constitutional referen
dum, boycotted by the UNEM and
the major opposition parties,
failed by more than a million
votes, despite strong official pres
sures. The UNEM continued its
program of strikes and political
opposition well into the next year.
Then, on May 17, 1963, the gov
ernment tried again, this time
in the national legislative elec
tions. Every conceivable pressure
was brought to bear. Opposition
candidates were arrested as they
went to the polls to vote. Never
theless, at th e final count, the
government's party, the Front
for the Defence of Constitutional
Institutions (FDIC), received only
thirty-five percent of the vote.
Hassen ll's regime did the only
thing possible from its point of
view; it simply invalidated a suf
ficient number of the opposition's
electees, and announced to the
country that the FDIC had at

tained a majority in the elective
assembly.
Two months later, during th e
municipal elections, the polling
places were deserted in protest.
Nevertheless, the Moroccan gov
vernment announced that more
than seventy percent of the elig
ible voters had gone to the polls.
In the meantime, Hassen's regime
had moved to silence protest in
a much more active manner. On
July 16, 1963, government spokes
men announced the discovery of
a 'plot' to assassinate Hassen and
arrested more than one hundred
of the leaders of the major oppo
sition party, The National Union
of Popular Forces (UNFP), at an
open UNFP meeting at the
party's national headquarters in
Casablanca.
SINCE THIS INITIAL mass
roundup of its opponents, Has
sen's special police, operating os
tensibly under the emergency con
ditions necessitated by the 'plot,'
have arrested and kidnapped lit
erally thousands of progressives,
including many students whose

political activities never went be
yond concerns of the UNEM. Re
ports from Morocco indicate that
prisoners are often subjected to
the most primative of torture
methods and are consistently be
ing denied the right to communi
cate with their families and law
yers. The total count of those
arrested and jailed in this lengthy
purge now reaches well over
5,000.
During this systematic cam
paign of terror, president Berada
and the UNEM remained adamant
in their stand against the govern
ment. As repression mounted,
their criticisms sharpened. In
April of 1963, on the eve of the
legislative elections, the UNEM
Council came to the point with

this declaration: "... The Moroc
can citizen, aware of his respon
sibilities, face to face with this
situation, has the right to feel
apprehensive about the establish
ment of a fascist regime in Moroc
co."
A wave of arrests of UNEM
members followed. There were
more incidents of torture and sev
eral reports of death.
The Eighth UNEM Congress,
which met in Casablanca on July
30 and 31 and August 1 and 2 of
last year, was all too aware of
the tense political situation exist
ing. Seventy-five delegates were
unable to attend, because they
were either missing or under ar
rest. At this time the UNEM de
clared: "that abolition of this re
gime is the first condition for
this country to emerge from the
open or latent crisis in which it
has constantly been floundering
ever since it became independent.
. . . Inspired by the best Nazi
traditions, the royal regime is
thus trying to justify itself by
spreading the outworn myth
about this 'conspiracy,' hoping
that the real plot which it is con
tinually drumming up against
progressive and national forces,
will be passed over in silence."
LESS THAN ONE week after
the Congress, president Berada
was arrested at his home by a
member of Hassen's special po
lice force. He was held for three
days without charge or warrent,
questioned intensively, and then
mysteriously released. Nearly
three weeks later, on August 28,
1963, Berada held a press confer
ence folowing a meeting of the
Secretariate of the Confederation
of Maghreb Students. His state
ment was open sedition: " . . .
while setting out on the same
path of violence as French colon
ialism and in having recourse to
the same methods, such as mass
arrest, kidnapping, torture and
murder, the monarchical regime
in Morocco should be denounced
and combated by the peoples of
the Maghreb and by all demo
crats throughout the world."
These were Berada's last words.
Only a few hours after his press
conference, he disappeared — per
haps forever.
Several months later, the Morac
can Security authorities moved
against the Executive Committee
of the UNEM, forcing it to go
underground. The decimated lead
ership of the UNEM went into
hiding. The opposition, for the
moment at least, was silent.
Was Berada a "subversive" as
the Moroccan government m a i n
tained? Perhaps — but if so, he
was a subversive by necessity,
propelled toward an extreme posi

tion by repressive forces entirely
in the hands of Hassen's regime.
Several weeks before his final
'arrest,' Berada explained hi s
position in a taped interview with
a represenative of the Coordinat
ing Secretariate of the National
Unions of Students (COSEC).
(This interview appeared in the
July-August isue of COSEC's pub
lication, The Student. ) His predic
tion for the future of Moroccan
stability was dark indeed: "Up to
now we have been living in un
certainty. On the one hand we
knew that any reform in the set
up of the royalist regime was im
possible, but on the other hand
we did not cease to use ordinary
political means to attempt to rea
lize the radical transformations
necessary since the declaration
of independence. But I think this
contradiction . . . will disappear
in the new phase. It is the regime
which is going to force the oppo
sition to resort to new measures.
. . . Violence will almost certainly
be the order of the day for the
coming months. . . ."
BERADA spoke bitterly of the
betrayed hopes of Ihe Moroccan
people: "In their fight a g a in s t
colonialism the Moroccan people
have not had as their aim the dis
appearance of foreigners, but
rather an increase in their stand-

ard of living and also the achieve
ment of a society where dignity
has a place, where education
exists, where a national culture
exists. . . . After independence,
the people as a whole were ready
to mobilize, were ready to make
grave sacrifices, to see their
aspirations realized. What ha p
pened? Absolutely nothing hap
pened. Independence was simply
the replacement of colonialist
masters by feudal masters. Ex
ploitation was Moroccanized."
To those who questioned the
motives behind his political oppo
sition Berada explained, "We are
fighting against the regime not
out of some sort of romanticism,
not because of some kind of mod
ernism, not because monarchy is
archaic. It is not very pleasant
to see a monarchy where <ne men
kiss the hand of the king but
I believe that the struggle of the
Moroccan students goes somewhat
beyond these annoying and super
ficial things. For let it be said
that Moroccan students would not
mind kissing the hand of the king
if the king would undertake
agrarian reform. We know very
well that the king whose hand
people kiss is a king who is in
capable of undertaking agrarian
reform."
Berada's final words contained
a plea before the court of world
opinion — a plea to end the myth
of "Morocco the Democracy." Not
knowing that he himself would
soon be abducted, Berada re
counted a series of brutal inci
dents involving students arrests,
tortures, deaths. He concluded,
"We know that when crimes such
as these occured in Algeria under
colonialist domination they stirred
the emotions of the whole world,
galvanizing what one could call
the universal conscience. Well?
We are scandalized that the
events should pass in silence in
the press and before outside opin
ion. Under these condtions, the
role of the Moroccan students is
to do all in their power to see
that this mystification comes to
an end."


HAMID BERADA


KING HASSEN II
One sunny summer afternoon,
! three men in civilian dress walked
I into the offices of the National
Union of Moroccan Students
(UNEM) and asked to see the
president, Hamid Berada, claim
ing to be his friends. When he
appeared, they seized him sud
denly, forced him into their grey,
unmarked jeep, and drove off.
The next day, the government
controlled Moroccan radio c o in
firmed the 'arrest' of one Hamid
Berada. His trial, for alleged "sub
versive activities," would follow
shortly, the communique prom
ised. All this took place nearly
five months ago.
Soon after Berada's unortho
dox 'arrest,' the Moroccan govern
ment issued a series of circuitous
denials and ambiguous assur
ances, but these have gradually
dribbled off into nothingness.
There has been no trial. There has
been no news. What remains is
silence. Berada has, in effect, dis
appeared from the face of the
earth.
