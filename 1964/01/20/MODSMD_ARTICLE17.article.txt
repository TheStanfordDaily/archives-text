# Harpsichord Concert Here 'Transcends Limitations'
## 
### JOHN T. STUDEBAKER 
Ralph Kirkpatrick, internation
ally renowned harpsichordist, last
Friday evening brought to Stan
ford a brilliant program of Sona
tum Unlimited. Before a full capa
city Dinkelspiel audience, the pro
tege of Wanda Landowska demon
strated a sensitive, mature ap
proach to the late Baroque and
Classic clavier literature of Hay
dn, assorted sons Bach, and Scar
latti.
Though the dynamic and tonal
expressiveness of the harpsichord
is limited by its very delicate
physiology in comparison with the
piano, Mr. Kirkpatrick trans
cended these difficulties with
subtle and appropriate variations
of touch, register, and tempo. It
is just this kind of approach that
justifies the resurrection of the
harpsichord from the musty, dark
corner of the museum.
THROUGHOUT THE concert,
Mr. Kirkpatrick maintained great
control over the music, not giving
way to the extremes of mechani
cal or flamboyant style cncounted
in performers like Waleha and
Valenti.
Mr. Kirkpatrick had some diffi
culty at the beginning of the pro
gram with technical faults which
cause him to wince ever so
slightly. Even so, his treatment of

Haydn's Sonata No. 33, in D ma
jor (especially the andante) was
noteworthy for its nuances in
phrasing. That the sonatas of Carl
Philipp Emanuel, Johann Chris
tian, and Wilhelm Friedemann
Bach lacked profundity was some
thing decided not Friday evening
but over two hundred years ago.
Saving the best for the last, Mr.
Kirkpatrick closed the program
with seven sonatas by Scarlatti.
He wove his way through the ex
tremely demanding contrapuntal
passage with great ease. In the
last sonata his immaculate han
dling, as it were, of the second
part counter rhythmic patterns
was astounding.
FOR HIS ENCORE, Mr. Kirk
Patrick played a stirring inter
pretation of the first movement
of the Italian Concerto in F for
Harpsicord by not the son, the
brother, or cousin, but by Bach
himself. One would have hoped to
hear more Bach, especially in
light of the compositions of his
progeny offered in the program.
But Mr. Kirkpatrick evidently
felt that the audience should be
exposed to lesser known compo
sitions. Indeed, one may listen to
Mr. Kirkpatrick's Archive Pro
duction recordings of the great
'war horses' such as the Italian
Concerto.
It was most refreshing to be
in the presence of a great artist
who in no way sacrifices musi
cianship with theatrics. Unlike
some performers who before an
audience manifest near orgiastic
suffering through a variety of
torso gyrations and facial contor
tions, Mr. Kirkpatrick channeled
his energies into his hand and
heart.
