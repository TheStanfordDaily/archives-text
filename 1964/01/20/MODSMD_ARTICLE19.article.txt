"Roots of National Socialism"
is the topic of the History Depart
ment sponsored Panel to be held
tonight at 8:00 in room 270 of
Tresidder Union.
Participating in the panel are
Dr. Gordon Craig and Heinz
Eulau of the Stanford History De
partment, and visitors Dr. George
Mosse from the University of
Wisconsin and Dr. Hugh Seton-
Watson from the University of
London.
The panel is an offshoot of a
program ol' seminars held last
fall which Dr. Craig calls "A
whole new departure for the His
tory Department." After receiv
ing financial support from the
Committee in International Af
fairs, Dr. Craig last fall invited
Dr. Mosse, a noted historian and
author, to come to Stanford and
lead a series of 8 or 10 seminars
open to 30 members of the His
tory, Political Science, and Hu
manities Department and guests
from the Ford Center for Be
haviorial Research, San Francisco
Stale and San Jose State.
The weekly seminars consisted
of about one-half hour of lecture
by Mosse concerning material
for his forthcoming book on the
History of Voelkisch Thought,
and one and one-half hours of in
formal discussion.
Besides leading these seminars.
Mosse taught an undergraduate
course in Intellectual History.
"Dr. Mosse is an enormously pop
ular lecturer," reports Dr. Craig.
He has participated in youth
hostels and has quite a following
among the undergraduates.
Mosse is also popular with the
Graduates' History Club who will
be co-sponsors of the panel. Many
of these students were anxious to
attend the fall seminar series,
however, attendance was by in
vitation only.
Tonight's program is open to
the public and Dr. Craig hopes to
include the audience in the dis
cussion.
