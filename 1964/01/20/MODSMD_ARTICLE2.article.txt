# First Of Camp Lectures Is On French Philosophical History

### JON ROISE 
The eighteenth- and nineteenth-century French development of
philosophical history as a progression towards climactic perfeetabil
ity was the subject of Dr. Frank Manuel's lecture in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium yesterday. His talk, "Taming the Future: The French
Idea of Perfection," was the fifth in his current series on the Phil-

osophy of History, and was the'
first of three composing the 1964
Harry Camp Lecture Series.
DR. MANUEL related the
launching of philosophical history
as a discipline in its own right
with the pseudonymous publica
tion by Voltaire in 1765 of a vol
ume titled simply "Philosophy of
History."
Early French philosophers,
such as Baron d'Holbach and the
Marquis do Condorcet believed
that the accumulative effect of
scientific knowledge made the
idea of regression impossible, Dr.
Manuel said. History was a con
tinuous progression to the pres
ent, which would always be the
highest state.
To these men, particularly to
Condorcet, history was a story of
struggle against nature. Tech
nological progress for the better
ment of mankind was so urgent
and important that free inquiry
and liberty would have to bo sub
ordinated to it. Organization and
co-ordination would be quicker
and more efficient than a group
of free-wheling individuals. This
forward thrust thus became a
new factor in history.
PROFESSOR MANUEL went
on to describe the later French
philosophers, particularly Saint-
Simon and Auguste Comte, who
also saw history as a progression
towards perfectability, but in a
more gradual and less periodized
light.
They looked upon not just as
the growth of rationality, but
as the growth of four elements
of man: intelligence, activity,
emotion, and conscience. It was
the product of the whole man,
and therefore would have to be
considered as the sum of the
whole. To emphasize technologi
cal activity at the expense of the
rest of man, as Condorcet advo
cated, would disturb the balance
of steady progress among the ele
ments.
This theory, however, was left
with one unresolved problem: If
history were to culminate in a
state of perfection, as the French
naturally assumed, which element
of man would rule in the final
world?

launching of philosophical history
as a discipline in its own right
with the pseudonymous publica
tion by Voltaire in 1765 of a vol
ume titled simply "Philosophy of
History."
Early French philosophers,
such as Baron d'Holbach and the
Marquis do Condorcet believed
that the accumulative effect of
scientific knowledge made the
idea of regression impossible, Dr.
Manuel said. History was a con
tinuous progression to the pres
ent, which would always be the
highest state.
To these men, particularly to
Condorcet, history was a story of
struggle against nature. Tech
nological progress for the better
ment of mankind was so urgent
and important that free inquiry
and liberty would have to bo sub
ordinated to it. Organization and
co-ordination would be quicker
and more efficient than a group
of free-wheling individuals. This
forward thrust thus became a
new factor in history.
PROFESSOR MANUEL went
on to describe the later French
philosophers, particularly Saint-
Simon and Auguste Comte, who
also saw history as a progression
towards perfectability, but in a
more gradual and less periodized
light.
They looked upon not just as
the growth of rationality, but
as the growth of four elements
of man: intelligence, activity,
emotion, and conscience. It was
the product of the whole man,
and therefore would have to be
considered as the sum of the
whole. To emphasize technologi
cal activity at the expense of the
rest of man, as Condorcet advo
cated, would disturb the balance
of steady progress among the ele
ments.
This theory, however, was left
with one unresolved problem: If
history were to culminate in a
state of perfection, as the French
naturally assumed, which element
of man would rule in the final
world?
