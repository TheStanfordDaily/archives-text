# Xavier Administration Bans Barnett Speech
## 
### 
Students at Xavier University, Cincinnati, Ohio, were up in arms
last week over their administration's veto of an invitation extended
by Student Council members to Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett
to address the student body.
ACCORDING TO the Xavier News, the cancellation was met with

calm but resolute student opposi
tion marked by closed-door coun
cil sessions, public protests, the
appearance of swastika on a park
ing attendant's shack, reports of
an incendiary explosion on the
lawn of the Dean of Men's resi
dence, and a chanting picket dem
onstration.
Speaking for the administra
tion, Rev. Patrick W. Ratterman,
Dean of Men, rejected the pro
posed address when approached
by Student Council President Ru
dolph Hasl, who had invited Bar
nett during a 30-minute interview
with the governor while studying
with other council members racial
practices at Tougaloo Southern
Christian College near Jackson in
December.
In a news release, Father .Rat
terman stated; "Freedom of
speech is not the precise problem
in the present circumstances.
What might be termed 'freedom
of place' is actually the point at
issue. By not approving the in
vitation to Governor Barnett, the
University is not saying that the
Governor has no right to express
his views on racial segregation,
states rights, or whatever else lie
likes."
"BUT WHETHER or not he
should express his views in per
son on the Xavier campus at: this
time is within our right to deter
mine . . ."
"Xavier is a university with a
public-ally stated commitment
a commitment to Christian ideas
and Christian ideals. One of these
ideals is the equality of all men
and the respect for the dignity
of all men. This ideal is, of course,
American as well as Christian.
"Governor Barnett's stand on
segregation contradicts these . . .
ideals and is, we feel, basically
immoral."
In rebuttal, Student Council
President Hasl stated that the ad
ministrations position was "in
consistent" with the university's
declaration on convocation policy
and "imprudent" because it re
affirms speaker bans existing in
the South.
Some 200 students, waving
pickets reading: "Wouldn't Pat
rick Henry Be Proud," "We Shall
Overcome," and"He May Be Ab
surd But Let Him Be Heard,"
conducted an orderly mar c h
through the campus in protest of
the decision.

cil sessions, public protests, the
appearance of swastika on a park
ing attendant's shack, reports of
an incendiary explosion on the
lawn of the Dean of Men's resi
dence, and a chanting picket dem
onstration.
Speaking for the administra
tion, Rev. Patrick W. Ratterman,
Dean of Men, rejected the pro
posed address when approached
by Student Council President Ru
dolph Hasl, who had invited Bar
nett during a 30-minute interview
with the governor while studying
with other council members racial
practices at Tougaloo Southern
Christian College near Jackson in
December.
In a news release, Father .Rat
terman stated; "Freedom of
speech is not the precise problem
in the present circumstances.
What might be termed 'freedom
of place' is actually the point at
issue. By not approving the in
vitation to Governor Barnett, the
University is not saying that the
Governor has no right to express
his views on racial segregation,
states rights, or whatever else lie
likes."
"BUT WHETHER or not he
should express his views in per
son on the Xavier campus at: this
time is within our right to deter
mine . . ."
"Xavier is a university with a
public-ally stated commitment
a commitment to Christian ideas
and Christian ideals. One of these
ideals is the equality of all men
and the respect for the dignity
of all men. This ideal is, of course,
American as well as Christian.
"Governor Barnett's stand on
segregation contradicts these . . .
ideals and is, we feel, basically
immoral."
In rebuttal, Student Council
President Hasl stated that the ad
ministrations position was "in
consistent" with the university's
declaration on convocation policy
and "imprudent" because it re
affirms speaker bans existing in
the South.
Some 200 students, waving
pickets reading: "Wouldn't Pat
rick Henry Be Proud," "We Shall
Overcome," and"He May Be Ab
surd But Let Him Be Heard,"
conducted an orderly mar c h
through the campus in protest of
the decision.
Students at Xavier University, Cincinnati, Ohio, were up in arms
last week over their administration's veto of an invitation extended

ACCORDING TO the Xavier News, the cancellation was met with

calm but resolute student opposi
tion marked by closed-door coun
cil sessions, public protests, the
appearance of swastika on a park
ing attendant's shack, reports of
an incendiary explosion on the
