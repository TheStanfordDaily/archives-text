### SHEILA RICKETTS 
"I shall put them together as
the sheep ... in the midst of
their fold." Taking his text from
the second chapter of Micah, Dr.
Robert McAfee Brown opened the
"Week of Prayer for Christian
Unity" with a .sermon yesterday
morning in Memorial Church.
BROWN, WHO recently re
turned from th e Ecumenical
Council in Rome, spoke of the
three levels of Christian unity—
"unity in action, unity in afflic
tion, and unity in affirmation."
As an example of unity in ac
tion, he described the struggle of
the Southern Negro students who
have been willing to risk every
thing and who have found a rea
son for existence in the current
slruggle for civil rights.
Brown said that he had had
"frequent occasion to comment
on their courage and unity of ac
tion" this summer in Rome. "You
can imagine the thrill it gave me
1o discover that some Stanford
students had gotten into the bat
tle too."
BROWN MENTIONED several
examples of unity in affliction.
The "most poignant" example
was "the one you all experienced
on November 22." In the days
of intense national grief, people
were drawn together and all sorts
of barriers came down.
The third and deepest level is,
according to Brown, unity in af
firmation. "Christian faith is not
just unity in a common human
ity, but unity in Jesus Christ."
It is Brown's hope that "the
unity we share at this deepest
level can help heal divisions and
overcome differences."
