"For it is by his grace you are saved, through trusting him; it is
not your own doing. It is God's gilt, not a reward work done. Then;
is nothing for anyone to boast of.' Eph. 2:8, 9, NE.
One of the most important truths of the Bible, and the one that
proud and sinful men try constantly to deny, is that salvation is
entirely the work of God, unmerited and undeserved. Man can do
nothing to earn favor with God, nor live a life pleasing to God
without being born-again and empowered by the Holy Spirit. Man
is saved by faith in Jesus Christ alone, but even thi ssaving faith is
God-given.
"For we ourselves were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived,
serving (livers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful
and hating one another. But after that the kindness and love of
God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteous
ness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us,
by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour
that being justified by grace, we should be made heirs according
to the hope of eternal life." Titus 3:3-7 ,KJ.
Keeping the commandments or doing good deed apart Irom Christ
cannot and does not bring a person into a saving relationship with
God.
"For all alike have sinned, and are deprived of the divine splendor,
and all are justified by Cod s free grace alone, through his act ot
liberation in the person of Christ Jesus. For God designed him to
be the means of expiating sin by his sacrifiieial death, effective
through faith. God meant bv this to demonstrate his justice, be
cause in his forbearance he had overlooked the sins of the past—
to demonstrate his justice now in the present, showing that he is
both himself just and justifies any man who puts his faith in Jesus.
(Rom. 3:23-28) E.O.
A free gift can not be earned, but must be accepted to be effective.
God's free gift of eternal life to all who trust in Christ is undeserved
bv sinful man who is totally depraved in the sight of God.
"There is no just man, no one, no one who understands, no one who
seeks Cod. All have swerved aside, all alike have become debased;
there is no one to show kindness; no not one. Their throat is an open
grave, they use their tongues for treachery, adder's venom is on
their lips, and their mouth is full of bitter curses. There feet hasten
to shed blood, ruin and misery lie along their paths, they are strang
ers to the high-road of peace, and reverence for God does not enter
their thoughts. Now all the words of the law are addressed, as we
know, to those who are within the pale of the law, so that no one
may have anything to say in self-defense, but the whole world may
be exposed to the judgment of God." Rom. 3:1 1-19, NE.
Each and every one of us has sinned, we are all gone astray, and
"The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life
through jesus Christ our Lord." Rom. 6:23. If you have been try
ing to please God by good works, or to live a moral life without
His help—on your own strength, won't you turn your life over to
Jesus today and be born-again? "Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
except a man be born again he can not see the kingdom of Cod.
John 3:3.
