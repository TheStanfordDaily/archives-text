# UCLANS SWEEP PAIR
## Top Ranked Trojans Trounce Indian Five 
### TOM ELIAS 
Yes, Virginia, the number one
team in the country does play
on the Coast. But its name is not
Stanford. It's UCLA.
The Bruins were out to prove
just that this weekend at the
Sports Arena on Friday night in
Los Angeles, and at Santa Mo
nica C.C. Saturday. It took Walt
Hazzard, (Jail Goodrich & Co. a
while to get around to proving
their point. But when they did,
there was no question of which
team was truly better.
THROUGHOUT THE first half
of the Friday evening conlest,
the Uclan's vaunted press did not
bother the Tribe, as the farthest
behind they ever were was seven
points. This deficit was wiped out
quickly by five points by Bob
Bedell and a Mollis Moore bucket,
and Stanford went off the floor
at the half looking pretty good,
down only one point at 41-40.
They looked even better two
minutes into the second half, as
they quickly grabbed a three
point lead at 46-43. But the Bruins
kept pecking away and regained
the lead at 51-49 a few moments
later. UCLA had added one more
point to its lead and with 9:30
to go in the ball game led by onlv
three at 63-60.
Then the roof fell in on Howie
Dallmar's valiant Tribe. First
Goodrich sank a shot for 65-60.
Then he followed with two free
throws. Then Fred Slaughter
banged one in. then Jack Hirsch

and Slaughter again, following
with a free throw for a three
point play that put the Bruins in
front 74-60 and put Tom Dose
out of the game on fouls. Hazzard
followed, stealing the inbounds
pass and laying it in to give
UCLA a 16 point margin before
Dose's substitute, Craig Cordes,
put one in for the Indians to end
the Stanford drought. Stanford's
subs and UCLA's managed to
play about evenly the rest of the
way, and the final seore read
UCLA 84, Stanford 71.
Till] FOLLOWING night saw
the same story all over again,
only earlier. At Santa Monica
C.C., where the Bruins have lost
no games in twelve tries, Stan
ford was beaten from the moment
it stepped onto the court.
UCLA came out pressing, and
this time didn't delay the kill.
They jumped out to a quick 10 to
0 lead, and though the Indians
cut the margin to a mere six at
10-4 on Clayton Raaka and Kent
Hinckley two-pointers, they were
never in the game.
The story of the second game
was told at the guard positions,
whore the two Ail-American
Bruins, Goodrich and Hazzard be
tween them put in 53 of the
UCLA points in Ihe SO 1o 61 Stan
ford debacle.
THE STORY of Ihe first game
had been told in the inability of
the Indian guards to score or re
bound. Stanford also failed to es
tablish the clear supremacy on

the backboards it needed to even
come close in their game.
The twin losses dropped Stan
ford's league record to three wins
and three losses and leaves the
Tribe in third place in the Big
Six with almost no chance to edge
the unbeaten Uclans for the con
ference title. About all Stanford
rooters have to look forward to
is a February 22 meeting with
UCLA in the Pavilion.
This week the Indians continue
on the road with a Friday con
test with Mel Counts and his Ore
gon State buddies at Oill Coli
seum in Corvallis.
