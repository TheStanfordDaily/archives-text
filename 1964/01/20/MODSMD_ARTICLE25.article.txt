# Rugby Prevails, 13-3 As Van Nort Tallies 7
## 
### PETE EAKLAND 
The Indian rugby squad de
buted successfully on a soggy
field Saturday by piling up 13
points in the first half and then
playing the Oylmpic ruggers even
in the second half to defeat them
13-3.
Steve Van North, a recent great
at Amherst, played first % in
place of injured Gordon Waddell
and triple-threated his way to 7
points. Besides broken-field run
ning about 30 yards for a try
(equivalent of a touchdown), he
added two out of three extra
point attempts for four points.
Furthermore, his lateral passing
was consistently on the mark.
Next week, he will be back in
! his regular 2nd % position.
WITH THREE first-stringers
i missing, Clark Weaver, Dick
i Ragsdale, and Gordon Waddell,
i Coach Kmetovic said the relative
' ly sloppy game was not a true
| indication of the team's strength.
Early in the first half Stanford
I threatened. Van North made a
j good rush down the sideline. Then
two Olympics offsides gave the
Cards two penalty kicks and
Stanford was even in better posi
tions.
Seconds latei\ a threat became
a try as a scramble for the ball
took place in the end zone and

Randy Vahan, waiting on the
periphery of Iho struggle,
pounced on the ball whon it
emerged. Van North converted
and the score was 5-0.
AFTER SOME action in the
middle of the field, Stanford
again invaded Olympian soil. Van
North made the greatest play of
the afternoon when after taking
a lateral pass from Bill Price
turned upfield on the left, then
cut back into the middle before
crossing the goal and touching
the ball down for the score. Mov
ing the ball oul from the point
where the ball was touched down,
Van North had a good angle and
made good his kicks to put Stan
ford in the lead by 10 points.
Stanford finished its scoring
when Fraboni fell on a loose ball
in the end zone.
STANFORD MADE one serious
threat in the second half. A
beautiful kick by Hansel found
touch on the Olympic five yard
line. A series of lineouts and
scrums took the ball still closer
until an offsides stalled the drive.
The Stanford junior varsity, al
though never ahead, came back
twice on a placement by Heider
and a try by Bob Rath to emerge
with a tie 6-6. As the game end
ed, Stanford has boon stopped but
feet short of a game-winning
score several times by the "A"
team of the Olympic Club.

RON FRABONI (50) pushes 2nd rowman Dick Leeuwenberg (79) upward in attempt to snare in- j
bounds pass resulting from a lineout. The Olympic Club prevailed on this play but Stanford won
13-3 on tries by Steve Van North, Randy Vahan, and Ron Frabroni on two Van Nort extra point
kicks.
