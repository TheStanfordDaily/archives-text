# Zete, IFC Prexy Comment on Frat Ruling

### FRANK DUBOFSKY 
Editor's Nolc: In the state
ments which follow, IFC Presi
dent Don Haider and /eta Psi
member Frank Dubot'sky com
ment on the University's deci
sion to suspend the Zete House
from the Stanford campus for
a period of three years.

The Zete House was suspended
from Stanford last Thursday.
The house aeeepted full respon
sibility for it actions. There can
be no doubt the members should
bear the major share of guilt.
Can the Zete house, however, be
blamed entirely? Is it not part
of a bigger society (Stanford)
which is also responsible? Are
the Zetes only a representative
of a greater malaise which is to
be found in many fraternities?
CERTAINLY NO individual,
group, or school can be under
stood if not placed within the con
text of society, hi an American
society which has largely fallen
into moral irresponsibility, a ma
jor role of a university must be
to inspire its students to come to
terms with this problem. It must
strive to inspire the intellectual
curiosity and seriousness of mind
in students so they may under
stand and control those tendencies
which prevent man from truly
realizing himself. Stanford has
not done its part in bringing
about this altitude in enough stu
dents.
In the January edition of Show
magazine, Richard Atcheson
writes, "The Stanford undergrad
uates simply are not serious."
How can he be serious in a fra

ternity atmosphere that largely
asks only that he be a "good
guy"; that he tolerate and par
ticipate in Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Friday nights at the Rat's,
j the "Bee," or the Oasis; that he
also join in the gambling, wild
parties, drinking, and stealing
(euphemistically called 'con
ning'); that, he gets adequate
grades but slops short of inter
nalizing and expressing his knowl
edge to such an extent that he
might be called an intellectual?
Stanford's administration has a
duty to combat this if it is to
bring the University into line with
j the high educational goals it has
| set up.
THE ADMINISTRATION large

ly sees its role as a negative one.
They feel that once students are
here they should be left alone
as long as they do not go too far.
Once they go too far, then deal
with them. The Zete house is a
good case in point. The house has
been on probation for five of the
last seven years, and the adminis
tration's role in dealing with the
house has only been chastisement.
Not once in my three years has
the University brought positive
and helpful pressure to the house.
Gone are the days when Stan
ford can be a refuge for sons of
the wealthy to spend four care
free, irresponsible years. T h e
school has a responsibility to in
spire this new student body—one
of the best—in meeting new aca-
It has failed with the Zete house
and it is failing in many other
places.
By DON HAIDER
The first reaction to the Uni
versity's decision to suspend the
Zeta Psi fraternity from the Stan
ford campus until July 2, 1966,
engendered the near unanimous
approval of the Stanford commu
nity, both fraternity and n o n
fraternity men, faculty of both
pro- and anti-fraternity feelings.
It seemed that everyone around
campus had received the "inside
word" from a passing Zete ac
quaintance (though not everyone
had a chance to talk to Ed Snate)
on what had gone on in the Zete
house, and we were all quick to
condemn the group. Yesterday, I
had an opportunity to discuss
with John Rosencranz, the Zete
