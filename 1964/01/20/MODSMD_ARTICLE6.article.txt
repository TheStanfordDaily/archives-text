# Zete, IFC Prexy Comment on Frat Ruling
## 
### FRANK DUBOFSKY 
Editor's Nolc: In the state
ments which follow, IFC Presi
dent Don Haider and /eta Psi
member Frank Dubot'sky com
ment on the University's deci
sion to suspend the Zete House
from the Stanford campus for
a period of three years.

The Zete House was suspended
from Stanford last Thursday.
The house aeeepted full respon
sibility for it actions. There can
be no doubt the members should
bear the major share of guilt.
Can the Zete house, however, be
blamed entirely? Is it not part
of a bigger society (Stanford)
which is also responsible? Are
the Zetes only a representative
of a greater malaise which is to
be found in many fraternities?
CERTAINLY NO individual,
group, or school can be under
stood if not placed within the con
text of society, hi an American
society which has largely fallen
into moral irresponsibility, a ma
jor role of a university must be
to inspire its students to come to
terms with this problem. It must
strive to inspire the intellectual
curiosity and seriousness of mind
in students so they may under
stand and control those tendencies
which prevent man from truly
realizing himself. Stanford has
not done its part in bringing
about this altitude in enough stu
dents.
In the January edition of Show
magazine, Richard Atcheson
writes, "The Stanford undergrad
uates simply are not serious."
How can he be serious in a fra

ternity atmosphere that largely
asks only that he be a "good
guy"; that he tolerate and par
ticipate in Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Friday nights at the Rat's,
j the "Bee," or the Oasis; that he
also join in the gambling, wild
parties, drinking, and stealing
(euphemistically called 'con
ning'); that, he gets adequate
grades but slops short of inter
nalizing and expressing his knowl
edge to such an extent that he
might be called an intellectual?
Stanford's administration has a
duty to combat this if it is to
bring the University into line with
j the high educational goals it has
| set up.
THE ADMINISTRATION large

ly sees its role as a negative one.
They feel that once students are
here they should be left alone
as long as they do not go too far.
Once they go too far, then deal
with them. The Zete house is a
good case in point. The house has
been on probation for five of the
last seven years, and the adminis
tration's role in dealing with the
house has only been chastisement.
Not once in my three years has
the University brought positive
and helpful pressure to the house.
Gone are the days when Stan
ford can be a refuge for sons of
the wealthy to spend four care
free, irresponsible years. T h e

of the best—in meeting new aca-
It has failed with the Zete house
and it is failing in many other
places.
By DON HAIDER
The first reaction to the Uni
versity's decision to suspend the
Zeta Psi fraternity from the Stan
ford campus until July 2, 1966,
engendered the near unanimous
approval of the Stanford commu
nity, both fraternity and n o n
fraternity men, faculty of both
pro- and anti-fraternity feelings.
It seemed that everyone around
campus had received the "inside
word" from a passing Zete ac
quaintance (though not everyone
had a chance to talk to Ed Snate)
on what had gone on in the Zete
house, and we were all quick to
condemn the group. Yesterday, I
had an opportunity to discuss
with John Rosencranz, the Zete
Alumni President, his read ion to
I he decision t hat was made. Mr.
Rosecranz stood 100 percent bo
hind the University's decision, but
remained in a complete state of
quandary as to what the future
held for the fraternity. Mr. Rosen
cranz's alleged remark to a meet
ing with President Sterling went
like 1 this: "What assurance, Dr.
Sterling, do we have that the same
situation and incidents will not
occur again when we return to
the campus to reactivate the chap
ter?" This is the dilemma to
which I address myself. Has the
University done everything in its
power to fulfill its obligation to
the Zetes, or for that matter, to
any one of the other fraternities
in enabling them to change with
the ever-changing academic life
and atmosphere of this campus?
Stanford University has always
had a strong commitment to the
residence idea as a part of the
intellectual life of the campus.
The essential conviction behind

the Stanford House Plan is that
living and learning, social and
intellectual life, should not be
separate, but together. Professor
Dornbusch has characterized the
student in the Stanford eommu
nnity in this way: "To the student
there is no limit to his learning.
He may learn more about himself
from his peers than from his pro
fessors, more in the dormitories
than in 1 he classrooms, more from
novels than from textbooks. But
learn he will." The residence pro
gram was given such verbal em
phasis because il was believed
that such a program would lead
in some way to the social, cul
tural, and intellectual develop
ment of each and every individual.
University residences were to be
much more than the means for
providing food and lodging for
students at economical rates and
culturally acceptable conditions.
In a decade, Stanford Univer
sity grew as no other comparable
educational institution of its size.
Academically, t:he standards and

goals of the University became
greally expanded and with this
fantastic growth came an in
creased academic burden on the
individual. This great change
caught the fraternities unpre
pared to change, for they were not
adaptable from the start. The
proportionality in the change of
Stanford as an academic institu
tion in contrast to fraternities as
a residence providing an academic
atmosphere grew increasingly
farther apart.
Former Stanford Dean William
Craig perceived this dilemma and
unsuccessfully attempted to awak
en an indifferent community to
the problems that lay just ahead.
Craig, speaking to the Daily, com
mented, "The traditional 'Culture'
of the fraternity (with its em
phasis on social life, de-emphasis
on intellectual pursuits, accent
on collective spirit, etc.), is in con
flict with the newly emerging
'culture' of some institutions of
higher learning. If mature and
responsible students and faculty

can perceive those problems in a I
common frame of reference, it is
likely that the codes of the fra-1
ternity can he moved in the di- j
rections of greater concern with, I
and reward for, those behaviors j
which more directly contribute
to educational goals without los
ing in the process their primary
group function — which are im
portant both for individuals and
the institutions in which they are
located."
Dean Craig foresaw the future
of fraternities on the Stanford
campus could only be found in a
close relationship between frater
nity leaders, faculty, and the Uni
versity administration. Unfortun
ately, the three entities never got
together. When t he question
arises today concerning fraternity
scholastic standing, group behav
ior, social conduct, etc., the fra
ternities are given the clenched
fist, and asked, "What are you
going to do about it?"
From my own experience, the
answer to this dilemma is that
fraternities are incapable of
change without the external aid
of the faculty and the adminis
tration. (My apologies to those
houses, though few you may be,
who have so responsibly lived up
your purposes in the academic
community). Fraternities are
judged on this campus by the
lowest common denominator, i.e.,
which seems to be the Zetes.
What went on in the Zete House,
the atmosphere which was gen
erated there, is indicative of what
exists in other houses. Anachron
istic "hell weeks" are still preva
lent in half a dozen houses or so.
Furthermore, I'd be willing to
wager that half of the fraterni
ties don't have a professor to din
ner more than once a quarter. It

is an accepted fact that more than
half of the houses don't even have
an active faculty advisor. One
exasperated house president re
marked to me, "Why should I in
vite a member of the faculty to
dinner when the members of the
house show the man little of the
respect that is due him?" Five
minutes after dinner is served
the dining hall is empty. I'll be
darned if I'll expose any member
of the faculty to such a situation.
"A fraternity doesn't assume this
type of atmosphere overnight. On
the same level, what happened
to the Zetes is not a culmination
of what went on over the four
month period of the 1963-61 aca
demic year.
It's relatively easy for a fra
ternity to decline, but extremely
hard to work its way back up to
the standards of the university
community. When I see the prob
lems within individual fraternity
nouses, the great turnover in
house officers, the break-down in
communications between the IFC,
the faculty and administrators, I
become disheartened to the point
where I realize lhat even a multi
million dollar fraternity house
building project will not alleviate
the problems faced by the fra
ternity system on this campus. It
most urgently needs direction
and an open hand, not a repri
mand and a clenched fist. Dean
Craig once wisely remarked, "Be
fore the University is eligible to
criticize the fraternities for their
present position in higher educa
tion, it should state clearly what
is expected of them and provide
assistance and counsel to gain the
desired ends.
When Ihe University commu
nity finally comes to grips with
this problem, the answer to Mr.
Rosecranz's question will be giv
en. If this great University de
sires to create an atmosphere at
the primary group level, one's
University living group, where
David Riesman calls, "The rela
tion of education to later life" a
dialectic and critical one," it must
take greater role in creating such
an atmosphere.
There is a basic need for closer
ties between the University and
the fraternities to be made. Na
tional officers, University offi
cials, interested faculty, key
alumni, and fraternity leaders
must sit down and re-define for
this campus the particular role
the fraternity plays at Stanford.
Particular attention must be given
to the role fraternties fulfill in
the context of the entire Univer
sity community, especially as one
of three options for on-campus
living.
There are numerous other ques
tions that can be posed here,
which should be given careful con
sideration:
(1) The feasibility of placing
faculty members on a permanent
basis in as many houses as pos
sible. This could mean either (a)
retired faculty member who still
have a desire to be active in the
educational process or (b) young
graduate students, especially se
lected and trained, with the desire
to work within a group such as
a fraternity. A small stipend
could be set aside in an attempt
to attract such men as would ac
tively take part in a house's ac
tivities.
(2) Assigned faculty advisors
to each fraternity where the fac
ulty person would take more than
passive role in the fraternity's
development. Opportunities for
academic advising and counseling
would also be available.
(3) A study by the Stanford
administration of other campuses
where the University has been
forced to come to grips with the
fraternities.
(4) University funds should
provide a special fund for a small
library to be made available to
each living group. The groups
would he held accountable for
their books at the end of each aca
demic year.

By DON HAIDER
The first reaction to the Uni
versity's decision to suspend the
Zeta Psi fraternity from the Stan
ford campus until July 2, 1966,
engendered the near unanimous
approval of the Stanford commu
nity, both fraternity and n o n
fraternity men, faculty of both
pro- and anti-fraternity feelings.
It seemed that everyone around
campus had received the "inside
word" from a passing Zete ac
quaintance (though not everyone
had a chance to talk to Ed Snate)
on what had gone on in the Zete
house, and we were all quick to
condemn the group. Yesterday, I
had an opportunity to discuss
with John Rosencranz, the Zete
Alumni President, his read ion to
I he decision t hat was made. Mr.
Rosecranz stood 100 percent bo
hind the University's decision, but
remained in a complete state of
quandary as to what the future
held for the fraternity. Mr. Rosen
cranz's alleged remark to a meet
ing with President Sterling went
like 1 this: "What assurance, Dr.
Sterling, do we have that the same
situation and incidents will not
occur again when we return to
the campus to reactivate the chap
ter?" This is the dilemma to
which I address myself. Has the
University done everything in its
power to fulfill its obligation to
the Zetes, or for that matter, to
any one of the other fraternities
in enabling them to change with
the ever-changing academic life
and atmosphere of this campus?
Stanford University has always
had a strong commitment to the
residence idea as a part of the
intellectual life of the campus.
The essential conviction behind

the Stanford House Plan is that
living and learning, social and
intellectual life, should not be
separate, but together. Professor
Dornbusch has characterized the
student in the Stanford eommu
nnity in this way: "To the student
there is no limit to his learning.
He may learn more about himself
from his peers than from his pro
fessors, more in the dormitories
than in 1 he classrooms, more from
novels than from textbooks. But
learn he will." The residence pro
gram was given such verbal em
phasis because il was believed
that such a program would lead
in some way to the social, cul
tural, and intellectual develop
ment of each and every individual.
University residences were to be
much more than the means for
providing food and lodging for
students at economical rates and
culturally acceptable conditions.
In a decade, Stanford Univer
sity grew as no other comparable
educational institution of its size.
Academically, t:he standards and

goals of the University became
greally expanded and with this
fantastic growth came an in
creased academic burden on the
individual. This great change
caught the fraternities unpre
pared to change, for they were not
adaptable from the start. The
proportionality in the change of
Stanford as an academic institu
tion in contrast to fraternities as
a residence providing an academic
atmosphere grew increasingly
farther apart.
Former Stanford Dean William
Craig perceived this dilemma and
unsuccessfully attempted to awak
en an indifferent community to
the problems that lay just ahead.
Craig, speaking to the Daily, com
mented, "The traditional 'Culture'
of the fraternity (with its em
phasis on social life, de-emphasis
on intellectual pursuits, accent
on collective spirit, etc.), is in con
flict with the newly emerging
'culture' of some institutions of
higher learning. If mature and
responsible students and faculty

can perceive those problems in a I
common frame of reference, it is
likely that the codes of the fra-1
ternity can he moved in the di- j
rections of greater concern with, I
and reward for, those behaviors j
which more directly contribute
to educational goals without los
ing in the process their primary
group function — which are im
portant both for individuals and
the institutions in which they are
located."
Dean Craig foresaw the future
of fraternities on the Stanford
campus could only be found in a
close relationship between frater
nity leaders, faculty, and the Uni
versity administration. Unfortun
ately, the three entities never got
together. When t he question
arises today concerning fraternity
scholastic standing, group behav
ior, social conduct, etc., the fra
ternities are given the clenched
fist, and asked, "What are you
going to do about it?"
From my own experience, the
answer to this dilemma is that
fraternities are incapable of
change without the external aid
of the faculty and the adminis
tration. (My apologies to those
houses, though few you may be,
who have so responsibly lived up
your purposes in the academic
community). Fraternities are
judged on this campus by the
lowest common denominator, i.e.,
which seems to be the Zetes.
What went on in the Zete House,
the atmosphere which was gen
erated there, is indicative of what
exists in other houses. Anachron
istic "hell weeks" are still preva

remained in a complete state of
quandary as to what the future
held for the fraternity. Mr. Rosen
cranz's alleged remark to a meet
ing with President Sterling went
like 1 this: "What assurance, Dr.
Sterling, do we have that the same
situation and incidents will not
occur again when we return to

which I address myself. Has the
University done everything in its
power to fulfill its obligation to
the Zetes, or for that matter, to
any one of the other fraternities
in enabling them to change with
the ever-changing academic life
and atmosphere of this campus?
Stanford University has always
had a strong commitment to the
residence idea as a part of the
intellectual life of the campus.
The essential conviction behind

the Stanford House Plan is that
living and learning, social and
intellectual life, should not be
separate, but together. Professor
Dornbusch has characterized the
student in the Stanford eommu
nnity in this way: "To the student
there is no limit to his learning.
He may learn more about himself
from his peers than from his pro
fessors, more in the dormitories
than in 1 he classrooms, more from
novels than from textbooks. But
learn he will." The residence pro
gram was given such verbal em
phasis because il was believed
that such a program would lead
in some way to the social, cul
tural, and intellectual develop
ment of each and every individual.
University residences were to be
much more than the means for
providing food and lodging for
students at economical rates and
culturally acceptable conditions.
In a decade, Stanford Univer
sity grew as no other comparable
educational institution of its size.
Academically, t:he standards and

goals of the University became
greally expanded and with this
fantastic growth came an in
creased academic burden on the
individual. This great change
caught the fraternities unpre
pared to change, for they were not
adaptable from the start. The
proportionality in the change of
Stanford as an academic institu
tion in contrast to fraternities as
a residence providing an academic
atmosphere grew increasingly
farther apart.
Former Stanford Dean William
Craig perceived this dilemma and
unsuccessfully attempted to awak
en an indifferent community to
the problems that lay just ahead.
Craig, speaking to the Daily, com
mented, "The traditional 'Culture'
of the fraternity (with its em
phasis on social life, de-emphasis
on intellectual pursuits, accent
on collective spirit, etc.), is in con
flict with the newly emerging
'culture' of some institutions of
higher learning. If mature and
responsible students and faculty

can perceive those problems in a I
common frame of reference, it is
likely that the codes of the fra-1
ternity can he moved in the di- j
rections of greater concern with, I
and reward for, those behaviors j
which more directly contribute
to educational goals without los
ing in the process their primary
group function — which are im
portant both for individuals and
the institutions in which they are
located."
Dean Craig foresaw the future
of fraternities on the Stanford
campus could only be found in a
close relationship between frater
nity leaders, faculty, and the Uni
versity administration. Unfortun
ately, the three entities never got
together. When t he question
arises today concerning fraternity
scholastic standing, group behav
ior, social conduct, etc., the fra
ternities are given the clenched
fist, and asked, "What are you
going to do about it?"
From my own experience, the
answer to this dilemma is that
fraternities are incapable of
change without the external aid
of the faculty and the adminis
tration. (My apologies to those
houses, though few you may be,
who have so responsibly lived up
your purposes in the academic
community). Fraternities are
judged on this campus by the
lowest common denominator, i.e.,
which seems to be the Zetes.
What went on in the Zete House,
the atmosphere which was gen
erated there, is indicative of what
exists in other houses. Anachron
istic "hell weeks" are still preva
lent in half a dozen houses or so.
Furthermore, I'd be willing to
wager that half of the fraterni
ties don't have a professor to din
ner more than once a quarter. It

is an accepted fact that more than
half of the houses don't even have
an active faculty advisor. One
exasperated house president re
marked to me, "Why should I in
vite a member of the faculty to
dinner when the members of the
house show the man little of the
respect that is due him?" Five
minutes after dinner is served
the dining hall is empty. I'll be
darned if I'll expose any member
of the faculty to such a situation.
"A fraternity doesn't assume this
type of atmosphere overnight. On
the same level, what happened
to the Zetes is not a culmination
of what went on over the four
month period of the 1963-61 aca
demic year.
It's relatively easy for a fra
ternity to decline, but extremely
hard to work its way back up to
the standards of the university
community. When I see the prob
lems within individual fraternity
nouses, the great turnover in
house officers, the break-down in
communications between the IFC,
the faculty and administrators, I
become disheartened to the point
where I realize lhat even a multi
million dollar fraternity house
building project will not alleviate
the problems faced by the fra
ternity system on this campus. It
most urgently needs direction
and an open hand, not a repri

Craig once wisely remarked, "Be

tion, it should state clearly what
is expected of them and provide
assistance and counsel to gain the

When Ihe University commu

this problem, the answer to Mr.
Rosecranz's question will be giv

sires to create an atmosphere at
the primary group level, one's
University living group, where
David Riesman calls, "The rela
tion of education to later life" a
dialectic and critical one," it must
take greater role in creating such
an atmosphere.
There is a basic need for closer
ties between the University and
the fraternities to be made. Na

alumni, and fraternity leaders
must sit down and re-define for
this campus the particular role
the fraternity plays at Stanford.
Particular attention must be given
to the role fraternties fulfill in
the context of the entire Univer
sity community, especially as one
of three options for on-campus
living.
There are numerous other ques
tions that can be posed here,
which should be given careful con
sideration:
(1) The feasibility of placing
faculty members on a permanent
basis in as many houses as pos
sible. This could mean either (a)
retired faculty member who still
have a desire to be active in the
educational process or (b) young
graduate students, especially se
lected and trained, with the desire
to work within a group such as
a fraternity. A small stipend
could be set aside in an attempt
to attract such men as would ac
tively take part in a house's ac
tivities.
(2) Assigned faculty advisors
to each fraternity where the fac

passive role in the fraternity's
development. Opportunities for
academic advising and counseling
would also be available.

Editor's Nolc: In the state
ments which follow, IFC Presi
dent Don Haider and /eta Psi
member Frank Dubot'sky com
ment on the University's deci
sion to suspend the Zete House
from the Stanford campus for
a period of three years.

The Zete House was suspended
from Stanford last Thursday.
The house aeeepted full respon
sibility for it actions. There can
be no doubt the members should
bear the major share of guilt.
Can the Zete house, however, be
blamed entirely? Is it not part
of a bigger society (Stanford)
which is also responsible? Are
the Zetes only a representative
of a greater malaise which is to
be found in many fraternities?
CERTAINLY NO individual,
group, or school can be under
stood if not placed within the con
text of society, hi an American
society which has largely fallen
into moral irresponsibility, a ma
jor role of a university must be
to inspire its students to come to
terms with this problem. It must
strive to inspire the intellectual
curiosity and seriousness of mind
in students so they may under
stand and control those tendencies
which prevent man from truly
realizing himself. Stanford has
not done its part in bringing
about this altitude in enough stu
dents.
In the January edition of Show
magazine, Richard Atcheson
writes, "The Stanford undergrad
uates simply are not serious."
How can he be serious in a fra

ternity atmosphere that largely
asks only that he be a "good
guy"; that he tolerate and par
ticipate in Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Friday nights at the Rat's,
j the "Bee," or the Oasis; that he
also join in the gambling, wild
parties, drinking, and stealing
(euphemistically called 'con
ning'); that, he gets adequate
grades but slops short of inter
nalizing and expressing his knowl
edge to such an extent that he
might be called an intellectual?
Stanford's administration has a
duty to combat this if it is to
bring the University into line with
j the high educational goals it has
| set up.
THE ADMINISTRATION large

ly sees its role as a negative one.
They feel that once students are
here they should be left alone
as long as they do not go too far.
Once they go too far, then deal
with them. The Zete house is a
good case in point. The house has
been on probation for five of the
last seven years, and the adminis
tration's role in dealing with the
house has only been chastisement.
Not once in my three years has
the University brought positive
and helpful pressure to the house.
Gone are the days when Stan
ford can be a refuge for sons of
the wealthy to spend four care
free, irresponsible years. T h e

It has failed with the Zete house
and it is failing in many other
places.
By DON HAIDER
The first reaction to the Uni
versity's decision to suspend the
Zeta Psi fraternity from the Stan
ford campus until July 2, 1966,
engendered the near unanimous
approval of the Stanford commu
nity, both fraternity and n o n
fraternity men, faculty of both
pro- and anti-fraternity feelings.
It seemed that everyone around
campus had received the "inside
word" from a passing Zete ac
quaintance (though not everyone
had a chance to talk to Ed Snate)
on what had gone on in the Zete
house, and we were all quick to
condemn the group. Yesterday, I
had an opportunity to discuss
with John Rosencranz, the Zete
Alumni President, his read ion to
I he decision t hat was made. Mr.
Rosecranz stood 100 percent bo

the Zetes only a representative

society which has largely fallen

strive to inspire the intellectual
curiosity and seriousness of mind

which prevent man from truly
realizing himself. Stanford has
not done its part in bringing

on what had gone on in the Zete
house, and we were all quick to
condemn the group. Yesterday, I
had an opportunity to discuss
with John Rosencranz, the Zete
Alumni President, his read ion to
I he decision t hat was made. Mr.
Rosecranz stood 100 percent bo
hind the University's decision, but
remained in a complete state of
quandary as to what the future
held for the fraternity. Mr. Rosen
cranz's alleged remark to a meet
ing with President Sterling went
like 1 this: "What assurance, Dr.
Sterling, do we have that the same
situation and incidents will not
occur again when we return to
the campus to reactivate the chap
ter?" This is the dilemma to
which I address myself. Has the
University done everything in its
power to fulfill its obligation to
the Zetes, or for that matter, to
any one of the other fraternities
in enabling them to change with
the ever-changing academic life
and atmosphere of this campus?
Stanford University has always
had a strong commitment to the
residence idea as a part of the
intellectual life of the campus.
The essential conviction behind

the Stanford House Plan is that
living and learning, social and
intellectual life, should not be
separate, but together. Professor
Dornbusch has characterized the
student in the Stanford eommu
nnity in this way: "To the student
there is no limit to his learning.
He may learn more about himself
from his peers than from his pro
fessors, more in the dormitories
than in 1 he classrooms, more from
novels than from textbooks. But
learn he will." The residence pro
gram was given such verbal em
phasis because il was believed
that such a program would lead
in some way to the social, cul
tural, and intellectual develop
ment of each and every individual.
University residences were to be
much more than the means for
providing food and lodging for
students at economical rates and
culturally acceptable conditions.
In a decade, Stanford Univer
sity grew as no other comparable
educational institution of its size.
Academically, t:he standards and

goals of the University became
greally expanded and with this
fantastic growth came an in
creased academic burden on the
individual. This great change
caught the fraternities unpre
pared to change, for they were not
adaptable from the start. The
proportionality in the change of
Stanford as an academic institu
tion in contrast to fraternities as
a residence providing an academic
atmosphere grew increasingly
farther apart.
Former Stanford Dean William
Craig perceived this dilemma and
unsuccessfully attempted to awak
en an indifferent community to
the problems that lay just ahead.
Craig, speaking to the Daily, com
mented, "The traditional 'Culture'
of the fraternity (with its em
phasis on social life, de-emphasis
on intellectual pursuits, accent
on collective spirit, etc.), is in con
flict with the newly emerging
'culture' of some institutions of
higher learning. If mature and
responsible students and faculty

can perceive those problems in a I
common frame of reference, it is
likely that the codes of the fra-1
ternity can he moved in the di- j
rections of greater concern with, I
and reward for, those behaviors j
which more directly contribute
to educational goals without los
ing in the process their primary
group function — which are im
portant both for individuals and
the institutions in which they are
located."
Dean Craig foresaw the future
of fraternities on the Stanford
campus could only be found in a
close relationship between frater
nity leaders, faculty, and the Uni
versity administration. Unfortun
ately, the three entities never got
together. When t he question
arises today concerning fraternity
scholastic standing, group behav
ior, social conduct, etc., the fra
ternities are given the clenched
fist, and asked, "What are you
going to do about it?"
From my own experience, the
answer to this dilemma is that
fraternities are incapable of
change without the external aid
of the faculty and the adminis
tration. (My apologies to those
houses, though few you may be,
who have so responsibly lived up
your purposes in the academic
community). Fraternities are
judged on this campus by the
lowest common denominator, i.e.,
which seems to be the Zetes.
What went on in the Zete House,
the atmosphere which was gen
erated there, is indicative of what
exists in other houses. Anachron
istic "hell weeks" are still preva
lent in half a dozen houses or so.
Furthermore, I'd be willing to
wager that half of the fraterni
ties don't have a professor to din
ner more than once a quarter. It

is an accepted fact that more than
half of the houses don't even have
an active faculty advisor. One
exasperated house president re
marked to me, "Why should I in
vite a member of the faculty to
dinner when the members of the
house show the man little of the
respect that is due him?" Five
minutes after dinner is served
the dining hall is empty. I'll be
darned if I'll expose any member
of the faculty to such a situation.
"A fraternity doesn't assume this
type of atmosphere overnight. On
the same level, what happened
to the Zetes is not a culmination
of what went on over the four
month period of the 1963-61 aca
demic year.
It's relatively easy for a fra
ternity to decline, but extremely
hard to work its way back up to
the standards of the university
community. When I see the prob
lems within individual fraternity
nouses, the great turnover in
house officers, the break-down in
communications between the IFC,
the faculty and administrators, I
become disheartened to the point
where I realize lhat even a multi
million dollar fraternity house
building project will not alleviate
the problems faced by the fra
ternity system on this campus. It
most urgently needs direction
and an open hand, not a repri
mand and a clenched fist. Dean
Craig once wisely remarked, "Be
fore the University is eligible to
criticize the fraternities for their
present position in higher educa
tion, it should state clearly what
is expected of them and provide
assistance and counsel to gain the
desired ends.
When Ihe University commu
nity finally comes to grips with
this problem, the answer to Mr.
Rosecranz's question will be giv
en. If this great University de
sires to create an atmosphere at
the primary group level, one's
University living group, where
David Riesman calls, "The rela
tion of education to later life" a
dialectic and critical one," it must
take greater role in creating such
an atmosphere.
There is a basic need for closer
ties between the University and
the fraternities to be made. Na
tional officers, University offi
cials, interested faculty, key
alumni, and fraternity leaders
must sit down and re-define for
this campus the particular role
the fraternity plays at Stanford.
Particular attention must be given
to the role fraternties fulfill in
the context of the entire Univer
sity community, especially as one
of three options for on-campus
living.
There are numerous other ques
tions that can be posed here,
which should be given careful con
sideration:
(1) The feasibility of placing
faculty members on a permanent
basis in as many houses as pos
sible. This could mean either (a)
retired faculty member who still
have a desire to be active in the
educational process or (b) young
graduate students, especially se
lected and trained, with the desire
to work within a group such as
a fraternity. A small stipend
could be set aside in an attempt
to attract such men as would ac
tively take part in a house's ac
tivities.
(2) Assigned faculty advisors
to each fraternity where the fac
ulty person would take more than
passive role in the fraternity's
development. Opportunities for
academic advising and counseling
would also be available.
(3) A study by the Stanford
administration of other campuses
where the University has been
forced to come to grips with the
fraternities.

By DON HAIDER
The first reaction to the Uni
versity's decision to suspend the
Zeta Psi fraternity from the Stan
ford campus until July 2, 1966,
engendered the near unanimous
approval of the Stanford commu
nity, both fraternity and n o n
fraternity men, faculty of both
pro- and anti-fraternity feelings.
It seemed that everyone around
campus had received the "inside
word" from a passing Zete ac
quaintance (though not everyone
had a chance to talk to Ed Snate)
on what had gone on in the Zete
house, and we were all quick to
condemn the group. Yesterday, I
had an opportunity to discuss
with John Rosencranz, the Zete
Alumni President, his read ion to
I he decision t hat was made. Mr.
Rosecranz stood 100 percent bo
hind the University's decision, but
remained in a complete state of
quandary as to what the future
held for the fraternity. Mr. Rosen
cranz's alleged remark to a meet
ing with President Sterling went
like 1 this: "What assurance, Dr.
Sterling, do we have that the same
situation and incidents will not
occur again when we return to
the campus to reactivate the chap
ter?" This is the dilemma to
which I address myself. Has the
University done everything in its
power to fulfill its obligation to
the Zetes, or for that matter, to
any one of the other fraternities
in enabling them to change with
the ever-changing academic life
and atmosphere of this campus?
Stanford University has always
had a strong commitment to the
residence idea as a part of the
intellectual life of the campus.
The essential conviction behind

the Stanford House Plan is that
living and learning, social and
intellectual life, should not be
separate, but together. Professor
Dornbusch has characterized the
student in the Stanford eommu
nnity in this way: "To the student
there is no limit to his learning.
He may learn more about himself
from his peers than from his pro
fessors, more in the dormitories
than in 1 he classrooms, more from
novels than from textbooks. But
learn he will." The residence pro
gram was given such verbal em
phasis because il was believed
that such a program would lead
in some way to the social, cul
tural, and intellectual develop
ment of each and every individual.
University residences were to be
much more than the means for
providing food and lodging for
students at economical rates and
culturally acceptable conditions.
In a decade, Stanford Univer
sity grew as no other comparable
educational institution of its size.
Academically, t:he standards and

goals of the University became
greally expanded and with this
fantastic growth came an in
creased academic burden on the
individual. This great change
caught the fraternities unpre
pared to change, for they were not
adaptable from the start. The
proportionality in the change of
Stanford as an academic institu
tion in contrast to fraternities as
a residence providing an academic
atmosphere grew increasingly
farther apart.
Former Stanford Dean William
Craig perceived this dilemma and
unsuccessfully attempted to awak
en an indifferent community to
the problems that lay just ahead.
Craig, speaking to the Daily, com
mented, "The traditional 'Culture'
of the fraternity (with its em
phasis on social life, de-emphasis
on intellectual pursuits, accent
on collective spirit, etc.), is in con
flict with the newly emerging
'culture' of some institutions of
higher learning. If mature and
responsible students and faculty

can perceive those problems in a I
common frame of reference, it is
likely that the codes of the fra-1
ternity can he moved in the di- j
rections of greater concern with, I
and reward for, those behaviors j
which more directly contribute
to educational goals without los
ing in the process their primary
group function — which are im
portant both for individuals and
the institutions in which they are
located."
Dean Craig foresaw the future
of fraternities on the Stanford
campus could only be found in a
close relationship between frater
nity leaders, faculty, and the Uni
versity administration. Unfortun
ately, the three entities never got
together. When t he question
arises today concerning fraternity
scholastic standing, group behav
ior, social conduct, etc., the fra
ternities are given the clenched
fist, and asked, "What are you
going to do about it?"
From my own experience, the
answer to this dilemma is that
fraternities are incapable of
change without the external aid
of the faculty and the adminis
tration. (My apologies to those
houses, though few you may be,
who have so responsibly lived up
your purposes in the academic
community). Fraternities are
judged on this campus by the
lowest common denominator, i.e.,
which seems to be the Zetes.
What went on in the Zete House,
the atmosphere which was gen
erated there, is indicative of what

I he decision t hat was made. Mr.
Rosecranz stood 100 percent bo
hind the University's decision, but
remained in a complete state of
quandary as to what the future
held for the fraternity. Mr. Rosen
cranz's alleged remark to a meet
ing with President Sterling went
like 1 this: "What assurance, Dr.
Sterling, do we have that the same
situation and incidents will not
occur again when we return to
the campus to reactivate the chap
ter?" This is the dilemma to
which I address myself. Has the
University done everything in its
power to fulfill its obligation to
the Zetes, or for that matter, to
any one of the other fraternities
in enabling them to change with
the ever-changing academic life
and atmosphere of this campus?
Stanford University has always
had a strong commitment to the
residence idea as a part of the
intellectual life of the campus.
The essential conviction behind

the Stanford House Plan is that
living and learning, social and
intellectual life, should not be
separate, but together. Professor
Dornbusch has characterized the
student in the Stanford eommu
nnity in this way: "To the student
there is no limit to his learning.
He may learn more about himself
from his peers than from his pro
fessors, more in the dormitories
than in 1 he classrooms, more from
novels than from textbooks. But
learn he will." The residence pro
gram was given such verbal em
phasis because il was believed
that such a program would lead
in some way to the social, cul
tural, and intellectual develop
ment of each and every individual.
University residences were to be
much more than the means for
providing food and lodging for
students at economical rates and
culturally acceptable conditions.
In a decade, Stanford Univer
sity grew as no other comparable
educational institution of its size.
Academically, t:he standards and

goals of the University became
greally expanded and with this
fantastic growth came an in
creased academic burden on the
individual. This great change
caught the fraternities unpre
pared to change, for they were not
adaptable from the start. The
proportionality in the change of
Stanford as an academic institu
tion in contrast to fraternities as
a residence providing an academic
atmosphere grew increasingly
farther apart.
Former Stanford Dean William
Craig perceived this dilemma and
unsuccessfully attempted to awak
en an indifferent community to
the problems that lay just ahead.
Craig, speaking to the Daily, com
mented, "The traditional 'Culture'
of the fraternity (with its em
phasis on social life, de-emphasis
on intellectual pursuits, accent
on collective spirit, etc.), is in con
flict with the newly emerging
'culture' of some institutions of
higher learning. If mature and
responsible students and faculty

can perceive those problems in a I
common frame of reference, it is
likely that the codes of the fra-1
ternity can he moved in the di- j
rections of greater concern with, I
and reward for, those behaviors j
which more directly contribute
to educational goals without los
ing in the process their primary
group function — which are im
portant both for individuals and
the institutions in which they are
located."
Dean Craig foresaw the future
of fraternities on the Stanford
campus could only be found in a
close relationship between frater
nity leaders, faculty, and the Uni
versity administration. Unfortun
ately, the three entities never got
together. When t he question
arises today concerning fraternity
scholastic standing, group behav
ior, social conduct, etc., the fra
ternities are given the clenched
fist, and asked, "What are you
going to do about it?"
From my own experience, the
answer to this dilemma is that
fraternities are incapable of
change without the external aid
of the faculty and the adminis
tration. (My apologies to those
houses, though few you may be,
who have so responsibly lived up
your purposes in the academic
community). Fraternities are
judged on this campus by the
lowest common denominator, i.e.,
which seems to be the Zetes.
What went on in the Zete House,
the atmosphere which was gen
erated there, is indicative of what
exists in other houses. Anachron
istic "hell weeks" are still preva
lent in half a dozen houses or so.
Furthermore, I'd be willing to
wager that half of the fraterni
ties don't have a professor to din
ner more than once a quarter. It

is an accepted fact that more than
half of the houses don't even have
an active faculty advisor. One
exasperated house president re
marked to me, "Why should I in
vite a member of the faculty to
dinner when the members of the
house show the man little of the
respect that is due him?" Five
minutes after dinner is served
the dining hall is empty. I'll be
darned if I'll expose any member
of the faculty to such a situation.
"A fraternity doesn't assume this
type of atmosphere overnight. On
the same level, what happened
to the Zetes is not a culmination
of what went on over the four
month period of the 1963-61 aca
demic year.
It's relatively easy for a fra
ternity to decline, but extremely
hard to work its way back up to
the standards of the university
community. When I see the prob
lems within individual fraternity
nouses, the great turnover in
house officers, the break-down in
communications between the IFC,
the faculty and administrators, I
become disheartened to the point
where I realize lhat even a multi
million dollar fraternity house
building project will not alleviate
the problems faced by the fra
ternity system on this campus. It
most urgently needs direction
and an open hand, not a repri
mand and a clenched fist. Dean
Craig once wisely remarked, "Be
fore the University is eligible to
criticize the fraternities for their
present position in higher educa
tion, it should state clearly what
is expected of them and provide
assistance and counsel to gain the
desired ends.
When Ihe University commu
nity finally comes to grips with
this problem, the answer to Mr.
Rosecranz's question will be giv
en. If this great University de
sires to create an atmosphere at
the primary group level, one's
University living group, where
David Riesman calls, "The rela
tion of education to later life" a
dialectic and critical one," it must
take greater role in creating such
an atmosphere.
There is a basic need for closer
ties between the University and
the fraternities to be made. Na
tional officers, University offi
cials, interested faculty, key
alumni, and fraternity leaders
must sit down and re-define for
this campus the particular role
the fraternity plays at Stanford.
Particular attention must be given
to the role fraternties fulfill in
the context of the entire Univer
sity community, especially as one
of three options for on-campus
living.
There are numerous other ques
tions that can be posed here,
which should be given careful con
sideration:
(1) The feasibility of placing
faculty members on a permanent
basis in as many houses as pos
sible. This could mean either (a)
retired faculty member who still
have a desire to be active in the
educational process or (b) young
graduate students, especially se
lected and trained, with the desire
to work within a group such as
a fraternity. A small stipend
could be set aside in an attempt
to attract such men as would ac
tively take part in a house's ac
tivities.
(2) Assigned faculty advisors
to each fraternity where the fac
ulty person would take more than
passive role in the fraternity's
development. Opportunities for
academic advising and counseling
would also be available.
(3) A study by the Stanford
administration of other campuses
where the University has been
forced to come to grips with the
fraternities.
(4) University funds should
provide a special fund for a small
library to be made available to
each living group. The groups
would he held accountable for
their books at the end of each aca
demic year.
Editor's Nolc: In the state
ments which follow, IFC Presi
dent Don Haider and /eta Psi
member Frank Dubot'sky com
ment on the University's deci
sion to suspend the Zete House
from the Stanford campus for
a period of three years.

The Zete House was suspended
from Stanford last Thursday.
The house aeeepted full respon
sibility for it actions. There can
be no doubt the members should
bear the major share of guilt.
Can the Zete house, however, be
blamed entirely? Is it not part
of a bigger society (Stanford)
which is also responsible? Are
the Zetes only a representative
of a greater malaise which is to
be found in many fraternities?
CERTAINLY NO individual,
group, or school can be under
stood if not placed within the con
text of society, hi an American
society which has largely fallen
into moral irresponsibility, a ma
jor role of a university must be
to inspire its students to come to
terms with this problem. It must
strive to inspire the intellectual
curiosity and seriousness of mind
in students so they may under
stand and control those tendencies
which prevent man from truly
realizing himself. Stanford has
not done its part in bringing
about this altitude in enough stu
dents.
In the January edition of Show
magazine, Richard Atcheson
writes, "The Stanford undergrad
uates simply are not serious."
How can he be serious in a fra

ternity atmosphere that largely
asks only that he be a "good
guy"; that he tolerate and par
ticipate in Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Friday nights at the Rat's,
j the "Bee," or the Oasis; that he
also join in the gambling, wild
parties, drinking, and stealing
(euphemistically called 'con
ning'); that, he gets adequate
grades but slops short of inter
nalizing and expressing his knowl
edge to such an extent that he
might be called an intellectual?
Stanford's administration has a
duty to combat this if it is to
bring the University into line with
j the high educational goals it has
| set up.
THE ADMINISTRATION large

ly sees its role as a negative one.
They feel that once students are
here they should be left alone
as long as they do not go too far.
Once they go too far, then deal
with them. The Zete house is a
good case in point. The house has
been on probation for five of the
last seven years, and the adminis
tration's role in dealing with the
house has only been chastisement.
Not once in my three years has
the University brought positive
and helpful pressure to the house.
Gone are the days when Stan
ford can be a refuge for sons of
the wealthy to spend four care
free, irresponsible years. T h e
school has a responsibility to in
spire this new student body—one
of the best—in meeting new aca-
It has failed with the Zete house
and it is failing in many other
places.
By DON HAIDER
The first reaction to the Uni
versity's decision to suspend the
Zeta Psi fraternity from the Stan
ford campus until July 2, 1966,
engendered the near unanimous
approval of the Stanford commu
nity, both fraternity and n o n
fraternity men, faculty of both
pro- and anti-fraternity feelings.
It seemed that everyone around
campus had received the "inside
word" from a passing Zete ac
quaintance (though not everyone
had a chance to talk to Ed Snate)
on what had gone on in the Zete
house, and we were all quick to
condemn the group. Yesterday, I
had an opportunity to discuss
with John Rosencranz, the Zete
Alumni President, his read ion to
I he decision t hat was made. Mr.
Rosecranz stood 100 percent bo
hind the University's decision, but
remained in a complete state of
