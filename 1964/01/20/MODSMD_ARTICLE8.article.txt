# Good Recommends Facilities for All Faiths

"It seems that there's every
reason to make every effort to
permit the whole gamut of reli
gious activities here . . . The
.situation will remain anomalous
until Catholics and Jews are per
mitted on campus."
That's the opinion of Dr. Edwin
M. Good, associate professor of
religion. And to solve the prob
lem. he recommends:
• That Stanford build "a litlle
synagogue and a little Catholic
chapel" on University property
that it would permit the groups
to use but not to own or lease.
• That "there should bo some
way in which various denominn

tion members could be full mem
bers of the chaplain's staff."
BUT GOOD ADDKI): "Given the
facts of life and that Memorial
Church could never be anything
other than a Protestant Church,
I don't think Memorial Church
will be anything but Protestant."
The Religious Studies professor
praised the Committee 011 Reli
gious Activities (CRA)— but rec
ommended that it have faculty
members as advisors.
"The specific, distinctive view
points of individual groups should
be put into the University," Good
continued. "There should be de
bate under the sponsorship of
CRA. There are problems with
the accessibility of religious meet
ings. And there's an obvious
limitation of worship: li enn't h«<

done here."
GOOD POINTED out that Mrs.
Stanford never intell d e d for
Memorial Church to be anything
but Protestant because she pro
vided for the celebration of com
munion. But. he added, she in
structed the University to "get
me a man (for chaplain» who is
acceptable to any creeds, all
creeds or no creeds."
And that, said Good, is fatuous.
"She was in a period where
there was much denominational
bickering," he explained. "She
didn't see much chance of a
Catholic-Protestant rapport. She
was a child of her age, Victorian,
where everybody should agree.
She didn't want anything to div
ide, reflecting the assumptions of
her ;r'r,"

GOOD ASKKRTKD that this at
tilude "doesn't represent the facts
of life" because it bypasses the
many issues that do divide people
and it bypasses Protestant-
Catholic rappvoachment.
"When she insisted the Univer
sity should have no sectarian ties,
that was the thing uppermost in
her mind," said Good. "She had
seen the public and church-related
schools of her time, and that, too,
was the thing uppermost in her
mind. The only university that
had no relations to any church
at the time was Cornell.
"A University, she thought,
shouldn't be the agent of any
religious body."
Concluded Good: "We are non
sectarian but that has to be
clarified again."
