# KZSU Given Permission To Establish FM Station
## 
### BILL SMITH Feature Editor 
The Board of Trustees at their meeting in San Francisco last
week approved the petition of Stanford radio station, KZSU, for FM
broadcast facilities.
THE PETITION now goes before the Federal Communications
Commission for action which takes, normally, from six weeks to

six months. We hope that the*
FCC action will be complete in
time for us to begin FM broad
cast by the opening weeks of
Spring Quarter." Harold Wil
liams, KZSU station manager,
said.
KZSU, presently the second
largest all-student organization
on campus, with more than 120
staff members, operates an AM
carrier current system at 880 kilo
cycles which will be continued
even if FCC approval of the FM
system is forthcoming.
The new FM system would dif
fer from the present carrier cur
rent set-up since the 10 watt FM
transmitter would broadcast into
the air instead of into wires and
the signal would be available in
faculty homes and all university
residences. Additional coverage
would include Menlo Park. Palo
Alto, Atherton or a potential
audience of about 95,000, Wil
liams said.
THE PROPOSAL that KZSU in
j corporate an FM system into its
j operation was first made by John
Witherspoon, KZSU station man
ager in 1959. Consideration was
made by the Board of Trustees
but the plan was rejected due, in
part, to inadequate planning. The
idea was revived about 1961 and
discussion and planning have
been underway since that date.
The proposal which was approved
by the board last Thursday has
been under consideration for
about two months.
One of the weak points in the
Witherspoon proposal four years i
ago was a request for a specific |
amount of university financial ;
support for the organization and ;
the operation of the station. The
present plan calls for KZSU to :
bear the costs of the development
and operation of the station.'
Kenneth Cuthbertson. Univer- '
|sity vice president for Finance, j
said. "We hope they (KZSU) are!
able, as in the past, to attract
: sufficient income to cover their i
I needs."
II A L WILLIAMS expressed
confidence that KZSU will be able
to cover its needs. "Two years j
ago we had $31 in our account."
j Williams, said, "and today we
have enough to cover the cost of
installation and operation of an
FM system."
"Additionally during that time,
we have bought more than $500
worth of new records, improved
the facilities and invested in the
general appearance of the plant,"
Williams said. "We hope, also,
with the I'M set-up. to increase
our advertizing revenues."
AN EDUCATIONAL FM outlet
[ does not allow for commercial
messages, but the FCC requires
identification of program spon
| sors,

The continuation of the FM
system will allow commercial
messages, Williams said, since no
FCC commercial restrictions af
fect that system.
Williams expressed the view of
the station in a statement for the
Daily:
"FM was a distant dream from
our dusty hang-loose corner of
Memorial Hall two and a half
years ago. From our written pro
gram submitted last fall to the
Department of Communication,
the idea has become a near re
ality in less than three months.
We are very excited.
"YET OUR EXCITEMENT is a
sober one. We have undertaken
a solid responsibility to the Uni
versity community which we
shall serve. Even more, we feel
an obligation to those persons in
the Department of Communica
tion, in the administrative offiecs
and on the Board of Trustees
whose interest and confidence in
our enterprise has made the FM
a reality."
Lyle Nelson, director of Uni
versity Relations, when contacted
by The Daily, said, "Personally,
I am delighted about KZSU-FM,
and I think that it will provide
a worthwhile service to the Uni
versity community.
"While I speak personally, I
feel sure that 1 am expressing
the general view of the Univer
sity administration."
