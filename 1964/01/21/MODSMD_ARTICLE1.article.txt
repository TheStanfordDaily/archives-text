# History Seminar Analyzes Birth of National Socialism
## 
### JIM HAUSER 
The roots of National Socialism lie in its historical traditions
responsible for conditioning Germans to an "Attitude of Mind." This
caused them to choose National Socialism rather than existing
alternatives.
Professor George Mosse, visiting professor of history from Wis-

consin University, defended this
thesis against a panel of three
other scholars in discussing "The
Hoots of National Socialism" in
Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Panel members were, Professors
Gordon Craig and Heinz; Eulau,
both of the Stanford History de
partment. and Dr. Hugh Solon
Watson of the University of Lon
don.
DISCUSSING P R O F E S S O K
Mosse's "attitude of mind," Dr.
Seton-Watson admitted, "You
must look to the past." But the
crucial years of the two World
Wars and the 1929 Depression
were needed to activate the ten
dancies toward National Social
ism. He described the movement
as "a wider part of the
world than just Germany." Hit
ler's National Socialism contained
elements in common with the
world revolution of the early 20th
century: "Emphasis on the na
tion." "Virtues of the peasant."
"a traditionalist outlook," and
"the techniques of mass mobiliza
tion."
IN SPITE OF the strong his
torical tendencies toward Na
tional Socialism, Professor Eulau
maintained that more caused the
revolution than just the ideol
ogical roots in the German atti
tude of mind. "I've always had
the feeling that man can take his
fate in his own hands." There
were alternatives to National So
cialism in 1933.
Mosse maintained that the Ger
man tradition did "condition the
German intellectual elite. I think
people are preconditioned."
