# Pravda Judges U.S. Civil Rights
## 
### 
o
The Soviet Communist Party
newspaper "Pravda" has departed
from its traditional interpreta
tions of the United States recent
ly to present a lengthy article
showing whites joining Negroes
in the civil rights struggle.
The article, written by Pravda's
deputy managing editor, de
scribed the United States as com
plex, diversified, and sometimes
contradictory, a description which
departs from the paper's previous
"black and white" interpretations.
