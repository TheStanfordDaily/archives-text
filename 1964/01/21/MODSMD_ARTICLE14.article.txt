Keith Boyle's current exhibition
of paintings and drawings at the
Stanford Art Gallery is an excit
ing collection of work. The paint
ings are a selection of his most
months, have attracted great at
tention in the Bay Area as well
as across the nation.
His paintings are relevant to
our time, whether we want to
recognize this fact or not. He uses
vibrating luminous acrylic resin
colors. influorescent shocking
pinks and chartreuses which seem
to emit their own light. Next to
them a red brilliant if seen alone,
takes on the character of a dull
brown.
ONK OF Tllli main qualities
of his drawing and painting is con
trast: Bright reds are placed next
to depp blues, and raw canvas is
exposed next to sharply deline
ated forms, which are countered
by forms which end in a seem
ingly unfinished raw edge. His
black and white drawings s u p
port his love of contrast. Deep
matte black areas suround light
forms, and hard edges define geo
metric shapes, which contrast
with bizarre and unusual human
figures.
Boyle's paintings are strong,
dynamic creations, existing on
their own power. They are syn
thetic rather than analytic. They
do not .suggest, or hint, or imply.
