# Sterling, Seminars May Answer Questions
## 
### 
President Sterlings speech this morning and the "Stanford
Today and Tomorrow" seminars this evening present the pos
sibility of answering some long-posed questions. Observa
tions have come frequently from outside speakers this year
that the Stanford student body has become increasingly aware,
concerned, active, is undergoing fast-moving and significant
change. One is certain that the President and the policy
makers around him are aware of this change, but few know
their feelings about it.
It is undeniable that over this past year student discussion
lias been broad and philosophical on questions of student in
volvement in civil rights, religion at Stanford, the role of
fraternities, the student's role in university decision-making.
Yet there lias been a lack of statements from university admin
istrators indicating their feelings in these discussions, their
beliefs as to the role of the student and the nature of educa
tion.
Tlie President will not lie discussing the technical opera
tions of the University and its financing, and this is both a
departure from precedent and an exciting thing to see. Pre
sumably, this morning's address will give a strong indication
of the President's views of why this university is in existence
and why we are within it. And logically, this evening's semi
nars will bring forth questions and commentary on subjects
ranging from Memorial Church to Mississippi, admissions
policy to fraternities. The prospects for the day are promising.
