# Christian Church Must Face Problems of Poor, Oppressed

manieal Conference held in Athens, Ohio during Christmas vaca

If the Christian Church really is "for the life of the world," as
the iheme of the Conference implied, then one of the pressing ques
tions it must face is how it is going to respond to the anguish of
the poor and the oppressed. One of the key speakers on this ques
tion, a Brazilian Presbyterian pastor, Rev. Reubem Alves, rejected
the all too common attitude among Christians that the status quo
is what it is because such is the will of God, and to try to change it
would be to violate His will.
Alves comes from a country in which seven million out of twelve
and a half million children have no schools, in which more than
100,000 human beings die of tuberculosis every year, in which 75
percent of the producing lands belong to 7 percent of the landholders.
In one of the districts of the City of Recife, 500 out of every 1,000
babies die in or shortly after birth. Alves also comes from a conti
nent whose countries are able to match these grim statistics with
a disturbing regularity.
WE WOULD NOT find these conditions so appalling if we knew
that something was being done to change them, but in fact they
coexist with an indifference on the part of those who have power
to change them. In Brazil, since 1946, 250 agrarian reform projects
have been considered without action. The patience of the people is
wearing thin and the channels of parliamentary change are either
clogged or have been tried without success. If the dicotomy is to be
one of evolution or revolution, in Brazil the latter path of action is
the <»:;e which is emerging as the more relevant and positive answer.
IN A SITUATION such as this, how is the Christian Church to
respond? It has tended to be irrelevant, a palliative in a society in
need of social change; at times one is led to believe that through its
silence and inactivity it has betrayed its mission. Christians have
been discouraged from getting involved in situations involving great
risk, in which the forces of good and evil are so closely intertwined.
Christians do not realize that it is precisely in such situations that
Ihey are most urgently needed and called to serve.
Under such social, economic and political conditions the diver
sion of the totality of one's energies to a fight against Marxism is
an evasion of the problem, an evasion of the problem of the dehuman
izing character of the social environment. Christians may well have
something to learn from the Marxists; Bishop Sheen once pointed
out that the Western Marxists have taken Christ off the cross and
carried away the cross, while the Western Christians have taken
Christ and left the cross. However, at the same time a Christian
makes these claims he must also make it clear that revolution has
no inherent redemptive power; to make such a claim would be rele
gating the penultimate to the ultimate.
HOW THEN IN TIIE CHURCH to respond? A group of Protes
tant Brazilian students pointed one way with a declaration they pre
pared during Holy Week in 1962: "... we, as Christians, placed
by God in this part of Brazil [the Northeast J, recognize that we
must choose between two paths: either participate actively in the
revolutionary process and thus be on the side of 'Brazilian man'
especially the man of the Northeast, or by our omission, by our
individualism and opportunism, betray the revolution and the father
land, put ourselves on the side of the dominant and oppressing
groups, strengthen the status quo and thus be responsible for hunger
and death. We decide for the first path because we are Christians."
In our country the word revolution has acquired such a terrifying
and bloodied name that we tend to automatically shrink away from
it and relegate it to that list of things we would rather forget and
be unconcerned about. This is unfortunate, for today we are not
only called and challenged to concern ourselves with foreign revolu
tions but also with one which is coming on in our own country—
and the Civil Rights movement is only one of the batallions compris
ing the forces of this revolution.
In his book "Call to Christian Action," D. R. Sharpe has delineated
the dimensions of the revolutionary mission of the Christian Church:
t he Kingdom of God suggests a much more powerful dynamic
than either the reactionary right or the Marxist left. It predicates
social and racial goodwill, economic justice, job security, equality of
opportunity, universal peace. Its law is love; its method, forgiveness;
its spirit, unselfishness; its power, truth; and its goal, 'the abundant
life' for all God's children. Under the impulsion of the Kingdom-of-
God ethic the Church is challenged to be infinitely more radical for
infinitely higher reasons than the Marxist left. The Kingdom of God
is the most revolutionary concept in History."

life' for all God's children. Under the impulsion of the Kingdom-of-
God ethic the Church is challenged to be infinitely more radical for
infinitely higher reasons than the Marxist left. The Kingdom of God
is the most revolutionary concept in History."

tion.)
If the Christian Church really is "for the life of the world," as
the iheme of the Conference implied, then one of the pressing ques
tions it must face is how it is going to respond to the anguish of
the poor and the oppressed. One of the key speakers on this ques
tion, a Brazilian Presbyterian pastor, Rev. Reubem Alves, rejected
the all too common attitude among Christians that the status quo
is what it is because such is the will of God, and to try to change it
would be to violate His will.
Alves comes from a country in which seven million out of twelve
and a half million children have no schools, in which more than
100,000 human beings die of tuberculosis every year, in which 75
percent of the producing lands belong to 7 percent of the landholders.
In one of the districts of the City of Recife, 500 out of every 1,000
babies die in or shortly after birth. Alves also comes from a conti
nent whose countries are able to match these grim statistics with
a disturbing regularity.
WE WOULD NOT find these conditions so appalling if we knew
that something was being done to change them, but in fact they
coexist with an indifference on the part of those who have power
to change them. In Brazil, since 1946, 250 agrarian reform projects
have been considered without action. The patience of the people is
wearing thin and the channels of parliamentary change are either
clogged or have been tried without success. If the dicotomy is to be
one of evolution or revolution, in Brazil the latter path of action is
the <»:;e which is emerging as the more relevant and positive answer.
IN A SITUATION such as this, how is the Christian Church to
respond? It has tended to be irrelevant, a palliative in a society in
need of social change; at times one is led to believe that through its
silence and inactivity it has betrayed its mission. Christians have
been discouraged from getting involved in situations involving great
risk, in which the forces of good and evil are so closely intertwined.
Christians do not realize that it is precisely in such situations that
Ihey are most urgently needed and called to serve.
Under such social, economic and political conditions the diver
sion of the totality of one's energies to a fight against Marxism is
an evasion of the problem, an evasion of the problem of the dehuman
izing character of the social environment. Christians may well have
something to learn from the Marxists; Bishop Sheen once pointed
out that the Western Marxists have taken Christ off the cross and
carried away the cross, while the Western Christians have taken
Christ and left the cross. However, at the same time a Christian
makes these claims he must also make it clear that revolution has
no inherent redemptive power; to make such a claim would be rele
gating the penultimate to the ultimate.
HOW THEN IN TIIE CHURCH to respond? A group of Protes
tant Brazilian students pointed one way with a declaration they pre
pared during Holy Week in 1962: "... we, as Christians, placed
by God in this part of Brazil [the Northeast J, recognize that we
must choose between two paths: either participate actively in the
revolutionary process and thus be on the side of 'Brazilian man'
especially the man of the Northeast, or by our omission, by our
individualism and opportunism, betray the revolution and the father
land, put ourselves on the side of the dominant and oppressing
groups, strengthen the status quo and thus be responsible for hunger
and death. We decide for the first path because we are Christians."
In our country the word revolution has acquired such a terrifying
and bloodied name that we tend to automatically shrink away from
it and relegate it to that list of things we would rather forget and
be unconcerned about. This is unfortunate, for today we are not
only called and challenged to concern ourselves with foreign revolu
tions but also with one which is coming on in our own country—
and the Civil Rights movement is only one of the batallions compris
ing the forces of this revolution.
In his book "Call to Christian Action," D. R. Sharpe has delineated
the dimensions of the revolutionary mission of the Christian Church:
t he Kingdom of God suggests a much more powerful dynamic
than either the reactionary right or the Marxist left. It predicates
social and racial goodwill, economic justice, job security, equality of
opportunity, universal peace. Its law is love; its method, forgiveness;
its spirit, unselfishness; its power, truth; and its goal, 'the abundant
life' for all God's children. Under the impulsion of the Kingdom-of-
God ethic the Church is challenged to be infinitely more radical for

t he Kingdom of God suggests a much more powerful dynamic
than either the reactionary right or the Marxist left. It predicates
social and racial goodwill, economic justice, job security, equality of
opportunity, universal peace. Its law is love; its method, forgiveness;
its spirit, unselfishness; its power, truth; and its goal, 'the abundant
life' for all God's children. Under the impulsion of the Kingdom-of-
God ethic the Church is challenged to be infinitely more radical for
infinitely higher reasons than the Marxist left. The Kingdom of God
is the most revolutionary concept in History."

written by students who attended the 19th World Student Ecu
manieal Conference held in Athens, Ohio during Christmas vaca
tion.)
If the Christian Church really is "for the life of the world," as
the iheme of the Conference implied, then one of the pressing ques
tions it must face is how it is going to respond to the anguish of
the poor and the oppressed. One of the key speakers on this ques
tion, a Brazilian Presbyterian pastor, Rev. Reubem Alves, rejected
the all too common attitude among Christians that the status quo
is what it is because such is the will of God, and to try to change it
would be to violate His will.
Alves comes from a country in which seven million out of twelve
and a half million children have no schools, in which more than
100,000 human beings die of tuberculosis every year, in which 75
percent of the producing lands belong to 7 percent of the landholders.
In one of the districts of the City of Recife, 500 out of every 1,000
babies die in or shortly after birth. Alves also comes from a conti
nent whose countries are able to match these grim statistics with
a disturbing regularity.
WE WOULD NOT find these conditions so appalling if we knew
that something was being done to change them, but in fact they
coexist with an indifference on the part of those who have power
to change them. In Brazil, since 1946, 250 agrarian reform projects
have been considered without action. The patience of the people is
wearing thin and the channels of parliamentary change are either
clogged or have been tried without success. If the dicotomy is to be
one of evolution or revolution, in Brazil the latter path of action is
the <»:;e which is emerging as the more relevant and positive answer.
IN A SITUATION such as this, how is the Christian Church to
respond? It has tended to be irrelevant, a palliative in a society in
need of social change; at times one is led to believe that through its
silence and inactivity it has betrayed its mission. Christians have
been discouraged from getting involved in situations involving great
risk, in which the forces of good and evil are so closely intertwined.
Christians do not realize that it is precisely in such situations that
Ihey are most urgently needed and called to serve.
Under such social, economic and political conditions the diver
sion of the totality of one's energies to a fight against Marxism is
an evasion of the problem, an evasion of the problem of the dehuman
izing character of the social environment. Christians may well have
something to learn from the Marxists; Bishop Sheen once pointed
out that the Western Marxists have taken Christ off the cross and
carried away the cross, while the Western Christians have taken
Christ and left the cross. However, at the same time a Christian
makes these claims he must also make it clear that revolution has
no inherent redemptive power; to make such a claim would be rele
gating the penultimate to the ultimate.
HOW THEN IN TIIE CHURCH to respond? A group of Protes
tant Brazilian students pointed one way with a declaration they pre
pared during Holy Week in 1962: "... we, as Christians, placed
by God in this part of Brazil [the Northeast J, recognize that we
must choose between two paths: either participate actively in the
revolutionary process and thus be on the side of 'Brazilian man'
especially the man of the Northeast, or by our omission, by our
individualism and opportunism, betray the revolution and the father
land, put ourselves on the side of the dominant and oppressing
groups, strengthen the status quo and thus be responsible for hunger
and death. We decide for the first path because we are Christians."
In our country the word revolution has acquired such a terrifying
and bloodied name that we tend to automatically shrink away from
it and relegate it to that list of things we would rather forget and
be unconcerned about. This is unfortunate, for today we are not
only called and challenged to concern ourselves with foreign revolu
tions but also with one which is coming on in our own country—
and the Civil Rights movement is only one of the batallions compris
ing the forces of this revolution.
