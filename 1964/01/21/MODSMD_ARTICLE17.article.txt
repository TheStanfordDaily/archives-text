KENNEDY— I TRAGIC FLAW?
Editor, The Daily:
Fred Hawley, writing in th e
Daily on January 14, darod lib
erals to come forth to explain the
tragic flaw leading to the death
of our lale President , John F.
Kennedy. What weakness did this
man have that brought his down
fall?
The "tragic" flaw in the char
acter of John F. Kennedy was his
overwhelming love of the people
he served. Time and again in the
North, in the South, on college
campuses, on foreign soil, John

Kennedy would leave his guards
to walk and talk among th (
people. He trusted the Americar
nation implicitly; perhaps he hac
regard for us far exceeding oui
merits. Nonetheless, John Ken
ncdy believed that the Americar
President should be able to walli
freely over the land, to listen tr
the people, to know them. It was
this belief which led him to sit
unshielded, in the gunsights o]
an assassin.
I believe that this is not a flaw
but is a vital aspect of the char
acter of a great President.
