TRUSTEE MORALITY
Editor, The Daily:
On Friday, Jan. 17, the front
page of The Stanford Daily car
ried two major headlines. One
read: "PACE Sets New Record,
Nets Over $109 Million." The
other announced: "Zotes Sus
pended As Police Find Guns, Stol
en Goods."
The ironie concurrence of these
two events marks the culmina
tion of four years of unvarnished
hypocrisy and falsehood on 1 h e
part of our Administration and
Board of Trustees. We of the class
of 1964 are also the class of
PACE, and, as such, have been the
victims of almost four years of
administrative browbeatings and
cover ups.
The degradation of Zeta Psi
cannot be properly understood un
less it is realized that it has gone
hand in hand with the vitiation
of morals among the highest offi
cials of our Administration and
Board of Trustees.
We of the class of '64 remember
how the Administration kicked
the Chaparral and its editor off
campus in 1961 for the alleged
violation of a non-existent code of
decency. The truth was that
PACE was just underway and the
Administration feared adverse re
percussions to their coffers.
We remember Ron Rapoport's
exposure of how the Administra
tion failed to defend Professor
Paul Baran's right to hold con
troversial opinions on the grounds
of academic freedom. When ultra
right but wealthy alumni de
manded his dismissal the Admin
istration evaded making a declar
ation for academic freedom by
pointing out that Baran had ten
ure.
We remember how the Admin
istration torpedoed the Forum for
the Discussion of Non-Violent Al
ternatives to War in 1962 (on the
eve of the visit to this campus of
Erich Fromn, who was invited by
the Forum) in spite of the fact
that the Forum's constitution had
been specially revised before be
ing approved by LASSU.
We remember how the Admin
istration resorted to the most
transparent subterfuges in order
to defeat the liquor referendum
in 1962 (a referendum to legalize
the consumption of alcohol on
campus by those twenty-one years
of age and older — a proposal
not at variance with state law).
We remember that even President
Sterling said it was illegal for
twenty-one year olds to drink on
campus, though it was later dem
onstrated that he knew better by
virtue of his work a few years
earlier to lower the California
drinking age. We recall how the
Board of Trustees pussyfooted
with the referendum for some
months and then vetoed it during
the summer vacation so as to
avoid student protest demonstra
tions.
We remember how Dean Craig
and A 1 Lowenstein were given
the boot after they had spoken
in favor of the liquor referendum
and in other ways had demon
strated their understanding of the
needs and desires of students.
We remember the cowardly
manner in which fallout shelters
were installed on campus during
the spring break in 1963 without
prior announcement to the stu
dents. We recall how members of
the Peace Caucus were threat
ened with expulsion when they
protested the presence of the fall
out shelters and asked for a pub
lic hearing on the matter. We
were treated with the contrast
of President Kennedy serving re
freshments to peace-men and
President Sterling having the
police intimidate Stanford stu
lents at the behest of PACE-men.
Stanford was founded by one
of the most ruthless robber bar
ons in American history. Its most
famous graduate played politics

with food in Eastern Europe.
This tradition of unrestrained
avarice has not been repudiated
by our Administration and Board
of Trustees. Their outright viola
tions of faculty and student rights
serve as one testament of tlm
lengths to which they have gone
to appease the wealthy and influ
ential. Another testament is pro
vided by The Daily editorial of
January 20. from which we learn
that PACE officials have prepared
"dossiers of wealthy friends and
alumni, analyzing their every
like, dislike and intimate personal
quirks in order to most efficiently
approach them for support."
The Daily condoned the "cold,
inhuman" tactics of the PACE
men on the grounds that the ends
to which PACE money will be
put will justify the means used
to acquire it. ("The imaginative—
even daring and reckless—chan
nelling of our funds can demon
strate that whatever our tactics,
our values are those of the
scholar.")
One cannot help but disagree
with The Daily, for it is this deifi
cation of ends to justify squalid
means that has in large part
created the "malaise" of which
Frank Dubofsky wrote in the Jan.
20 issue of Tlx* Daily. How can
students be expected to abide by
a Fundamental Standard when
the highest academic officials un
ashamedly pratice a double stan
dard of morality? Is the one to be
punished and the other to be con
doned because the stakes are $109
million in the latter and $400 in
the former? If the Zetes have
been properly punished then jus
tice demands that the Adminis
tration and Board of Trustees also
be indicted. They are the vipers
who ought to be scotched.

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. David Steinhart has never
lived. Not because the world he
imagines as Miss Sharon Cobb's
does not live within his "smutty"
self, but rather because lie does
not recognize what Miss Cobb is
really talking about. She is not
being dirty; she is not being sexy.
She is simply being honest, giv
ing an honest picture of an hon
est nineteen year-old college girl.
Grace in "Do You Always Drink
Dead Flies in Your Coffee" is
a sensitive girl—sensitive, that is,
in the good sense of the word.
She is open to everything, sees
the world with the eyes of a child.
No prejudices, no false moral
standards. She worries primarily
about herself, because to her, her
problem is the only problem that
matters. She lives for Matt. But
Matt is gone. And so Grace
searches. Very simple, very nor
mal. Dirty? Hardly.
As a matter of fact, I found
Grace somewhat of a prude,
now and then. When she reaches
for Ted's sex organ, she reaches
for the muscle "in question."
Simple reaction? Probably simple
embarassment. But much more
important than her prudery,
which, after all, is not of great
magnitude, is her openness. Grace
realizes, agonizingly, that her
problem is not Matt, but rather
herself, and she admits it. Beau
tifully. she faces facts and re
turns from the woods, rather than
locking herself in the average
clean-cut American escape capsule
of puritan bosch. She is a refresh
ing girl becoming sexually aware
a year after her body did so. I'm
sure the majority o£ young ladies
take much longer time to catch
up with iheir bodies, but then
they haven't the excitedness' of
Grace.
I hope some more people will
read Miss Cobb's story now.
rather than simply trying to find
smut. The story's clean; and good
to boot. Rare combination nowa
days.

twenty-one year olds to drink on
campus, though it was later dem
onstrated that he knew better by
virtue of his work a few years
earlier to lower the California
drinking age. We recall how the
Board of Trustees pussyfooted
with the referendum for some
months and then vetoed it during
the summer vacation so as to
avoid student protest demonstra
tions.
We remember how Dean Craig
and A 1 Lowenstein were given
the boot after they had spoken
in favor of the liquor referendum
and in other ways had demon
strated their understanding of the
needs and desires of students.
We remember the cowardly
manner in which fallout shelters
were installed on campus during
the spring break in 1963 without
prior announcement to the stu
dents. We recall how members of
the Peace Caucus were threat
ened with expulsion when they
protested the presence of the fall
out shelters and asked for a pub
lic hearing on the matter. We
were treated with the contrast
of President Kennedy serving re
freshments to peace-men and
President Sterling having the
police intimidate Stanford stu
lents at the behest of PACE-men.
Stanford was founded by one
of the most ruthless robber bar
ons in American history. Its most
famous graduate played politics

with food in Eastern Europe.
This tradition of unrestrained
avarice has not been repudiated
by our Administration and Board
of Trustees. Their outright viola
tions of faculty and student rights
serve as one testament of tlm
lengths to which they have gone
to appease the wealthy and influ
ential. Another testament is pro
vided by The Daily editorial of
January 20. from which we learn
that PACE officials have prepared
"dossiers of wealthy friends and
alumni, analyzing their every
like, dislike and intimate personal
quirks in order to most efficiently
approach them for support."
The Daily condoned the "cold,
inhuman" tactics of the PACE
men on the grounds that the ends
to which PACE money will be
put will justify the means used
to acquire it. ("The imaginative—
even daring and reckless—chan
nelling of our funds can demon
strate that whatever our tactics,
our values are those of the
scholar.")
One cannot help but disagree
with The Daily, for it is this deifi
cation of ends to justify squalid
means that has in large part
created the "malaise" of which
Frank Dubofsky wrote in the Jan.
20 issue of Tlx* Daily. How can
students be expected to abide by
a Fundamental Standard when
the highest academic officials un
ashamedly pratice a double stan
dard of morality? Is the one to be
punished and the other to be con

million in the latter and $400 in
the former? If the Zetes have
been properly punished then jus

who ought to be scotched.

Mr. David Steinhart has never
lived. Not because the world he
imagines as Miss Sharon Cobb's
does not live within his "smutty"
self, but rather because lie does
not recognize what Miss Cobb is
really talking about. She is not
being dirty; she is not being sexy.
She is simply being honest, giv
ing an honest picture of an hon
est nineteen year-old college girl.
Grace in "Do You Always Drink
Dead Flies in Your Coffee" is
a sensitive girl—sensitive, that is,
in the good sense of the word.
She is open to everything, sees
the world with the eyes of a child.
No prejudices, no false moral
standards. She worries primarily
about herself, because to her, her
problem is the only problem that
matters. She lives for Matt. But
Matt is gone. And so Grace
searches. Very simple, very nor
mal. Dirty? Hardly.
As a matter of fact, I found
Grace somewhat of a prude,
now and then. When she reaches
for Ted's sex organ, she reaches
for the muscle "in question."
Simple reaction? Probably simple
embarassment. But much more
important than her prudery,
which, after all, is not of great
magnitude, is her openness. Grace
realizes, agonizingly, that her
problem is not Matt, but rather
herself, and she admits it. Beau
tifully. she faces facts and re
turns from the woods, rather than
locking herself in the average
clean-cut American escape capsule
of puritan bosch. She is a refresh
ing girl becoming sexually aware
a year after her body did so. I'm
sure the majority o£ young ladies
take much longer time to catch
up with iheir bodies, but then
they haven't the excitedness' of
Grace.
I hope some more people will
read Miss Cobb's story now.
rather than simply trying to find
smut. The story's clean; and good
to boot. Rare combination nowa

TRUSTEE MORALITY
Editor, The Daily:
On Friday, Jan. 17, the front
page of The Stanford Daily car
ried two major headlines. One
read: "PACE Sets New Record,
Nets Over $109 Million." The
other announced: "Zotes Sus
pended As Police Find Guns, Stol
en Goods."
The ironie concurrence of these
two events marks the culmina
tion of four years of unvarnished
hypocrisy and falsehood on 1 h e
part of our Administration and
Board of Trustees. We of the class
of 1964 are also the class of
PACE, and, as such, have been the
victims of almost four years of
administrative browbeatings and
cover ups.
The degradation of Zeta Psi
cannot be properly understood un
less it is realized that it has gone
hand in hand with the vitiation
of morals among the highest offi
cials of our Administration and
Board of Trustees.
We of the class of '64 remember
how the Administration kicked
the Chaparral and its editor off
campus in 1961 for the alleged
violation of a non-existent code of
decency. The truth was that
PACE was just underway and the
Administration feared adverse re
percussions to their coffers.
We remember Ron Rapoport's
exposure of how the Administra
tion failed to defend Professor
Paul Baran's right to hold con
troversial opinions on the grounds
of academic freedom. When ultra
right but wealthy alumni de
manded his dismissal the Admin
istration evaded making a declar
ation for academic freedom by
pointing out that Baran had ten
ure.
We remember how the Admin
istration torpedoed the Forum for
the Discussion of Non-Violent Al
ternatives to War in 1962 (on the
eve of the visit to this campus of
Erich Fromn, who was invited by
the Forum) in spite of the fact
that the Forum's constitution had
been specially revised before be
ing approved by LASSU.
We remember how the Admin
istration resorted to the most
transparent subterfuges in order
to defeat the liquor referendum
in 1962 (a referendum to legalize
the consumption of alcohol on
campus by those twenty-one years
of age and older — a proposal
not at variance with state law).

Mr. David Steinhart has never
lived. Not because the world he
imagines as Miss Sharon Cobb's
does not live within his "smutty"
self, but rather because lie does
not recognize what Miss Cobb is
really talking about. She is not
being dirty; she is not being sexy.
She is simply being honest, giv
ing an honest picture of an hon
est nineteen year-old college girl.
Grace in "Do You Always Drink
Dead Flies in Your Coffee" is
a sensitive girl—sensitive, that is,
in the good sense of the word.
She is open to everything, sees
the world with the eyes of a child.
No prejudices, no false moral
standards. She worries primarily
about herself, because to her, her
problem is the only problem that
matters. She lives for Matt. But
Matt is gone. And so Grace
searches. Very simple, very nor
mal. Dirty? Hardly.
As a matter of fact, I found
Grace somewhat of a prude,
now and then. When she reaches
for Ted's sex organ, she reaches
for the muscle "in question."
Simple reaction? Probably simple
embarassment. But much more
important than her prudery,
which, after all, is not of great
magnitude, is her openness. Grace
realizes, agonizingly, that her
problem is not Matt, but rather
herself, and she admits it. Beau
tifully. she faces facts and re
turns from the woods, rather than
locking herself in the average
clean-cut American escape capsule
of puritan bosch. She is a refresh
ing girl becoming sexually aware
a year after her body did so. I'm
sure the majority o£ young ladies
take much longer time to catch
up with iheir bodies, but then
they haven't the excitedness' of
Grace.
I hope some more people will
read Miss Cobb's story now.

smut. The story's clean; and good

TRUSTEE MORALITY
Editor, The Daily:
On Friday, Jan. 17, the front
page of The Stanford Daily car
ried two major headlines. One
read: "PACE Sets New Record,
Nets Over $109 Million." The
other announced: "Zotes Sus
pended As Police Find Guns, Stol
en Goods."
The ironie concurrence of these
two events marks the culmina
tion of four years of unvarnished
hypocrisy and falsehood on 1 h e
part of our Administration and
Board of Trustees. We of the class
of 1964 are also the class of
PACE, and, as such, have been the
victims of almost four years of
administrative browbeatings and
cover ups.
The degradation of Zeta Psi
cannot be properly understood un
less it is realized that it has gone
hand in hand with the vitiation
of morals among the highest offi
cials of our Administration and
Board of Trustees.
We of the class of '64 remember
how the Administration kicked
the Chaparral and its editor off
campus in 1961 for the alleged
violation of a non-existent code of
decency. The truth was that
PACE was just underway and the
Administration feared adverse re
percussions to their coffers.
We remember Ron Rapoport's
exposure of how the Administra
tion failed to defend Professor
Paul Baran's right to hold con
troversial opinions on the grounds
of academic freedom. When ultra
right but wealthy alumni de
manded his dismissal the Admin
istration evaded making a declar
ation for academic freedom by
pointing out that Baran had ten
ure.
We remember how the Admin
istration torpedoed the Forum for
the Discussion of Non-Violent Al
ternatives to War in 1962 (on the
eve of the visit to this campus of
Erich Fromn, who was invited by
the Forum) in spite of the fact
that the Forum's constitution had
been specially revised before be
ing approved by LASSU.
We remember how the Admin
istration resorted to the most
transparent subterfuges in order
to defeat the liquor referendum
in 1962 (a referendum to legalize
the consumption of alcohol on
campus by those twenty-one years
of age and older — a proposal
not at variance with state law).
We remember that even President
Sterling said it was illegal for
twenty-one year olds to drink on
campus, though it was later dem
onstrated that he knew better by
virtue of his work a few years
earlier to lower the California
drinking age. We recall how the
Board of Trustees pussyfooted
with the referendum for some
months and then vetoed it during
the summer vacation so as to
avoid student protest demonstra
tions.
We remember how Dean Craig
and A 1 Lowenstein were given
the boot after they had spoken
in favor of the liquor referendum
and in other ways had demon
strated their understanding of the
needs and desires of students.
We remember the cowardly
manner in which fallout shelters
were installed on campus during
the spring break in 1963 without
prior announcement to the stu
dents. We recall how members of
the Peace Caucus were threat
ened with expulsion when they
protested the presence of the fall
out shelters and asked for a pub
lic hearing on the matter. We
were treated with the contrast
of President Kennedy serving re
freshments to peace-men and
President Sterling having the
police intimidate Stanford stu
lents at the behest of PACE-men.
Stanford was founded by one
of the most ruthless robber bar
ons in American history. Its most
famous graduate played politics

with food in Eastern Europe.
This tradition of unrestrained
avarice has not been repudiated
by our Administration and Board
of Trustees. Their outright viola
tions of faculty and student rights
serve as one testament of tlm
lengths to which they have gone
to appease the wealthy and influ
ential. Another testament is pro
vided by The Daily editorial of
January 20. from which we learn
that PACE officials have prepared
"dossiers of wealthy friends and
alumni, analyzing their every
like, dislike and intimate personal
quirks in order to most efficiently
approach them for support."
The Daily condoned the "cold,
inhuman" tactics of the PACE
men on the grounds that the ends
to which PACE money will be
put will justify the means used
to acquire it. ("The imaginative—
even daring and reckless—chan
nelling of our funds can demon
strate that whatever our tactics,
our values are those of the
scholar.")
One cannot help but disagree
with The Daily, for it is this deifi
cation of ends to justify squalid
means that has in large part
created the "malaise" of which

TRUSTEE MORALITY
Editor, The Daily:
On Friday, Jan. 17, the front
page of The Stanford Daily car
ried two major headlines. One
read: "PACE Sets New Record,
Nets Over $109 Million." The
other announced: "Zotes Sus
pended As Police Find Guns, Stol
en Goods."
The ironie concurrence of these
two events marks the culmina
tion of four years of unvarnished
hypocrisy and falsehood on 1 h e
part of our Administration and
Board of Trustees. We of the class
of 1964 are also the class of
PACE, and, as such, have been the
victims of almost four years of
administrative browbeatings and
cover ups.
The degradation of Zeta Psi
cannot be properly understood un
less it is realized that it has gone
hand in hand with the vitiation
of morals among the highest offi
cials of our Administration and
Board of Trustees.
We of the class of '64 remember
how the Administration kicked
the Chaparral and its editor off
campus in 1961 for the alleged
violation of a non-existent code of
decency. The truth was that
PACE was just underway and the
Administration feared adverse re
percussions to their coffers.
We remember Ron Rapoport's
exposure of how the Administra
tion failed to defend Professor
Paul Baran's right to hold con
troversial opinions on the grounds
of academic freedom. When ultra
right but wealthy alumni de
manded his dismissal the Admin
istration evaded making a declar
ation for academic freedom by
pointing out that Baran had ten
ure.
We remember how the Admin
istration torpedoed the Forum for
the Discussion of Non-Violent Al
ternatives to War in 1962 (on the
eve of the visit to this campus of
Erich Fromn, who was invited by
the Forum) in spite of the fact
that the Forum's constitution had
been specially revised before be
ing approved by LASSU.
We remember how the Admin
istration resorted to the most
transparent subterfuges in order
to defeat the liquor referendum
in 1962 (a referendum to legalize
the consumption of alcohol on
campus by those twenty-one years
of age and older — a proposal
not at variance with state law).
We remember that even President
Sterling said it was illegal for
twenty-one year olds to drink on
campus, though it was later dem
onstrated that he knew better by
virtue of his work a few years
earlier to lower the California
drinking age. We recall how the
Board of Trustees pussyfooted
with the referendum for some
months and then vetoed it during
the summer vacation so as to
avoid student protest demonstra
tions.
We remember how Dean Craig
and A 1 Lowenstein were given
the boot after they had spoken
in favor of the liquor referendum
and in other ways had demon
strated their understanding of the
needs and desires of students.
We remember the cowardly
manner in which fallout shelters
were installed on campus during
the spring break in 1963 without
prior announcement to the stu
dents. We recall how members of
the Peace Caucus were threat
ened with expulsion when they
protested the presence of the fall
out shelters and asked for a pub
lic hearing on the matter. We
were treated with the contrast
of President Kennedy serving re
freshments to peace-men and
President Sterling having the
police intimidate Stanford stu
lents at the behest of PACE-men.
Stanford was founded by one
of the most ruthless robber bar
ons in American history. Its most
famous graduate played politics

with food in Eastern Europe.
This tradition of unrestrained
avarice has not been repudiated
by our Administration and Board
of Trustees. Their outright viola
tions of faculty and student rights
serve as one testament of tlm
lengths to which they have gone
to appease the wealthy and influ
ential. Another testament is pro
vided by The Daily editorial of
January 20. from which we learn
that PACE officials have prepared
"dossiers of wealthy friends and
alumni, analyzing their every
like, dislike and intimate personal
quirks in order to most efficiently
approach them for support."
The Daily condoned the "cold,
inhuman" tactics of the PACE
men on the grounds that the ends
to which PACE money will be
put will justify the means used
to acquire it. ("The imaginative—
even daring and reckless—chan
nelling of our funds can demon
strate that whatever our tactics,
our values are those of the
scholar.")
One cannot help but disagree
with The Daily, for it is this deifi
cation of ends to justify squalid
means that has in large part
created the "malaise" of which
Frank Dubofsky wrote in the Jan.
20 issue of Tlx* Daily. How can
students be expected to abide by
a Fundamental Standard when
the highest academic officials un
ashamedly pratice a double stan
dard of morality? Is the one to be
punished and the other to be con
doned because the stakes are $109
million in the latter and $400 in
the former? If the Zetes have
been properly punished then jus
tice demands that the Adminis
tration and Board of Trustees also
be indicted. They are the vipers
who ought to be scotched.

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. David Steinhart has never
lived. Not because the world he
imagines as Miss Sharon Cobb's
does not live within his "smutty"
self, but rather because lie does
not recognize what Miss Cobb is
really talking about. She is not
being dirty; she is not being sexy.
She is simply being honest, giv
ing an honest picture of an hon
est nineteen year-old college girl.
Grace in "Do You Always Drink
Dead Flies in Your Coffee" is
a sensitive girl—sensitive, that is,
in the good sense of the word.
She is open to everything, sees
the world with the eyes of a child.
No prejudices, no false moral
standards. She worries primarily
about herself, because to her, her
problem is the only problem that
matters. She lives for Matt. But
Matt is gone. And so Grace
searches. Very simple, very nor
mal. Dirty? Hardly.
As a matter of fact, I found
Grace somewhat of a prude,
now and then. When she reaches
for Ted's sex organ, she reaches
for the muscle "in question."
Simple reaction? Probably simple
embarassment. But much more
important than her prudery,
which, after all, is not of great
magnitude, is her openness. Grace
realizes, agonizingly, that her
problem is not Matt, but rather
herself, and she admits it. Beau
tifully. she faces facts and re
turns from the woods, rather than
locking herself in the average
clean-cut American escape capsule
of puritan bosch. She is a refresh
ing girl becoming sexually aware
a year after her body did so. I'm
sure the majority o£ young ladies
take much longer time to catch
up with iheir bodies, but then
they haven't the excitedness' of
Grace.
I hope some more people will
read Miss Cobb's story now.
