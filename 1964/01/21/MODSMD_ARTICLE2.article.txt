# Holloman Cites Social Challenge To Engineers
## 
### BANNING GARRETT 
The engineering problems of
going lo the moon are easy com
pared to "the elimination of
slums, techniques of disarm
ament, and solving transportation
problems," stated Dr. J. Herbert
Holloman, Assistant Secretary of
Commerce for Research and De
velopment yesterday.
In the third annual Simon
Ramo Lecture presented by the
School of Engineering, Dr. Hollo
man said that the ultilization of
technology and science must cor
relate with social wealth and
needs. "Engineers should be con
cerned with national policy and
have a conscience for the proper
use of engineering," in- said.
"ENGINEERS SHOULD under
stand and be involved in political
action to insure that resources
are not wasted, but are respon
sibly used. Our survival will prob
ably depend on how we can use
our technology."
"Our future use of technology
and science depends on our young
engineers," he added. We arc
faced with a problem in our ed
ucation of engineers. "Good en
gineering cannot be taught at the
undergraduate level. Graduate
level education for engineers
should be as normal as graduate
work in law and medicine."
Engineers should be educated
in the political problems of engi
neering as well as the technical
problems. Dr. Holloman suggest
ed an internship for graduate en
gineers in the offices of con
gressmen.
