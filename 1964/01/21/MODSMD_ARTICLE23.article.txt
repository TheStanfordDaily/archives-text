# THE
						LAST CHURCH ON EARTH
## 
### 
Local professing churches have not always been loyal and faithful to the
Gospel of Jesus Clirist and the warnings of the Bible to neither add to
nor subtract from any portion oi Scripture ( Rev. 22:19). Apostasy in the.
professing church is apparent today as never before, and few are the
faithful in Christ. This situation is in direct accord with the prophecies
of Scripture. In fact the Hook of Revelation gives a warning to the last
church on earth before Clirist returns:
"These are the words of the Amen, Jesus Christ, the faithful and true
witness, the prime source of all God s creation: I know all your ways; you
are neither hot nor cold. Ifow 112 wish you were either hot or cold! But be
cause you arc lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my
mouth. You say, "Mow rich I am! And how well I have done! I have
everything I want in the world". In fact, though you do not know it, you
are the most pitiful wretch, poor, blind and naked. So I advise you to
buy from me gold refined in the (ire, to make you truly rich, and white
clothes to put 011 to hide the shame of your nakedness; and ointment for
your eyes that you may see. All whom I love I reprove and discipline.
Re on your mettle therefore and repent. Here I stand knocking at the
door; if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and
sit down to supper with him and he with me. To him that is victorious
1 will grant a place on my throne, as I myself was victorious and sat
down with my father on his throne. Hear, you that have ears to hear,
what the Spirit says to tin- churches!" Rev. 3:14-22, N.K.
The last church on earth will be lukewarm lor Jesus Christ, concerned
with world affairs and man's attempts to solve his own problems. If God
is mentioned at all, it is assumed that he is on man's side all the way.
But the last church is warned to repent and return to the Gospel of Jesus
Christ. This church is rich in material goods, and in gifted and talented
members, but spiritually dead. Gold speaks of the Deity of (.hrist, white
clothes of his righteousness, imputed by faith to all who believe. Oint
ment refers to the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit who indwells
every believer. Jesus Christ is not only the sovereign God of creation,
but the head of the church. It is His will and His ways wliich present
day churches should seek. On every side can he seen the anostasy aud
lukcw axmness for Christ which Biblical prophecy has foretold.
Are you as an individual faithful to the Lord Jesus Christ.'' Are you, seek
ing to serve Him in all that you do? Is your church faithful to the
Gospel of h sns Christ or is if the lukewarm church ol the end-time:'
