# Ruotolo Defines Existential Crises
## 
### LYNN SUSAG 
Although quipping that "prob
ably tho best existentialist pos
ture for tonight is at home in
front of the radiator," Professor
Lucio P. Ruotolo of the English
department braved the "flash
floods of Palm Drive" and the tor
rents of students overflowing the
large lounge of Tresidder Union
to speak on "Existentialism: The
Paradox of Re-entry," last night
in the second speech of TMU's
present series on Existentialism.
Ruotolo's purpose was to clar
ify and examine in detail the "ex
istentialist crisis" or "encounter
with nothingness" and show how
this has been handled in 191 hand
20th Century literature. "As long
as there are individuals who re
turn after this sort of an experi
ence, man has hope. History is
finished when all are members of
the tribe," Ruotolo concluded.
The existentialist crisis may be
described as that which tears to
shreds or shakes the foundations
of that which one believes. It in
volves the frightening experience
of meaninglessness, estrangement,
and doubt. Ruotolo described the
existentialist crises in works of
Kirkegaard. Joyce, and Sartre
and showed how in Sartre the self
was confirmed in the crisis when
the hero realized that it takes
something to perceive nothing
ness.
Ruotolo distinguished between
the "beatnik" experience and the
true existentialist crisis: "In
choosing bohemian life one knows
there is a back door. Despair
grasps when one can't get out
and faces the loss that is without
remedy."
A basic resistance to the ask
ing of existential questions exists
in modern man. Resistance some
times takes tho form of with
drawal or "sanctification of rou
tine or tradition. A great amount
of contemporary writing is aware
of this withdrawal," Ruotolo said.
