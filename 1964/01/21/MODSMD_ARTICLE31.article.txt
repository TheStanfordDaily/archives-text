# Horn to Lecture On Gothic Origins
## 
### 
Resuming the regular series of
Wednesday evening lectures on
art, the Department of Art and
Architecture announces that a lec
ture will be given on January 22
at 8:00 p.m. in Room 320 of the
Geology Building by the Univer
sity of California's Professor
Walter Horn. Horn, one of the
country's most distinguished his
torians of architecture, is partic
ularly interested in medieval ar
chitecture. On Wednesday he will
give an illustrated lecture on the
possible origins of Gothic stone
vaulting and bay structure in the
timber constructions of the earli
er Romanesque style.
Since surviving examples of
the transition from the very per
ishable timber architecture to
stone construction are very
scarce, Horn has had to dig deep
ly into the subject; he has found
exciting and unusual examples of
medieval architecture in-out-of
the-way places. His lecture should
attract the special interest of both
the architect and the art histor
ian. All students are welcome.
