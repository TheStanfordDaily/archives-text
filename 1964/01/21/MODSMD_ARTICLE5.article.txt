# Stanford Players Present O'Neill's 'Long Day's Journey Into Night'
## 
### 
Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's
Journey Into Night," tho first
Stanford Players' production of
the quarter, begins a four day run
tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in the
Nightery Theatre.
Tickets will be available only
at the door of the theatre, lo
cated in the lounge of the former
Student Union across from the
bookstore.
DICK WHITMORF, playing the
role of O'Neill: Mark Hammer,
acting th e part of O'Neill's
father; and Ruth Hunt, playing
the part of Mary Cavan, O'Neill's
mother, hold the lead roles.
Thomas Price and Victor Mitch
ell, publicity chairmen for the
production, explain that Mrs.
Hunt's part involves the problems
of life with a dope addict. Her
previous theatrical experience
well qualifies her for "type roles"
such as this.
Mrs. Hunt has played Blanche
in a "Streetcar Named Desire,"
and Julie in the Stridenberg play
al the Yale School of Drama.
"The method by which one acts
the scenes in which the poor
woman is under the influence of
morphine has been written into
the part by Eugene O'Neill," said
Mrs. Hunt. "The problem is to dig

| it out."
THE PROBLEMS facing Ham-
I mer, playing the part of her hus
; band, are of a different type, ac
j cording to publicity agents Price
J and Mitchell. "H is tori c ally,
O'Neill senior had been a
! success, artistically and finan-
I dally, playing ihe Count of Monte
j Cristo all over the United States.
Consequently, although he want
ed to be one with the family, he
continually retreated into his own
theatrical world. When Ralph
! Richardson played the role in the
I cinema, one saw the theatricality;
i when Frederick March played it
j on Broadway one saw the family
j man."
"I hope to unite these concepts
: in one complete character," said
Hammer. His experience includes
i roles in Summer Repertory on
j the East Coast and at Stanford.
He played Boss Finley in "Sweet
j Bird of Youth," and Monsieur in
i"The Hostage."
OTIIEK MEMBERS of the cast
; includes James, a jealous carous
. inÂ£ brother of O'Neill, played by
i Bill Louis; and Cathleen, played
j by Carole Wiese.
I The publicity chairmen report
I that the Nightery Theatre will
: seat only 50 each night and that
j "Long Day's Journey" will play
j tomorrow night "through Satur
day evening.
