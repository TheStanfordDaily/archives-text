# Forstman Questions Sectarianism

### BILL MOORE Staff Editor (Eighth in a Series) 
Stanford's religious policy is
"not in harmony with what I'd
understand as non-sectarianism,"
Assistant Professor Henry J.
Forstman told the Daily.
"Witohut saying this in criti
cism of the present situation, it
is a fact that what we have is
Protestant worship, which is sec
tarian." said Forstman. who is a
member of the Religious Studies
faculty. "It is sectarian in the
overall sense of religion in Amer
ica, which is basically Catholic,
Protestant, and Jewish."
Forstman added: "I'd be more
at ease, as a Protestant, if at
least Jewish and Catholic wor
ship were permitted in the chapel
of the University."
FORSTMAN SAID much of the
c u r re nt religious controversy
hinges on the way the Stanford
charter is read.
"It does seem to me that the
charter needs to be balanced
against the direct aims of the
University," he said. "Although
the charter may be an absolute
block, it hasn't been demonstrated
to me."
Forstman recommended I h a t.
Memorial Church be open to all
faiths. "If this were done," he ex
plained, "the chaplain could be
more of an executive officer, not
even necessarily a Protestant."
Hut Forstman pointed out that
if the University "opened the
door for some, you'd have to open
I he Hood cate entirely." And this,

he said, might lead to "disrup
tive groups."
"THIS IS WHAT many consider
to be the crux of the problem."
continued Forstman. "Properly
speaking, we ought not. do some
thing beea us e uncomfortable
things might develop. We should
deal with them as they occur."
He cited an incident at Prince
ton several years ago, where a
clergyman created trouble by con
tinually rousing the students
against the administration. "The
university officials there dealt
with it by simply requesting him
to leave," said Forstman. "That
shows that an administration can
deal with these problems."
I Forstman admitted that Stan
ford because it is one of the
few "non-sectarian, private insti
tutions in the country" - is a
situation in its own right.
"BUT I THINK it has within
its own campus the minds to solve
this problem, without necessarily
copying the solutions other uni
versities have arrived at."
Forstman said he thought Stan
ford was "in character" a non
sectarian university, hut added:
"I see only one fly in the oint
ment, and that's the prohibition
of non-Protestant worship on
campus."
"Mrs. Stanford lived at a time
I when she really thought it would
i be pan-sectarian to have this type
of a church (Protestanl Memorial
Church)," he said. "I guess she
I conceived that worship in that
| building would be attractive to
I any more or less educated, open
i minded student."

"The tri-partite of Catholics,
Jews and Protestants has comeâ€”
since her day."
While the founding grant made
clear that the university and
church were to be "non-sectar
ian." Mrs.t Stanford expanded on
the subject in the "general Revi
sion of the University Trusts of
1902," where she said "The uni
versity must be forever main
tained on a strictly non-partisan
and non-sectarian basis. It must
never become an instrument in
the hands of any political party
or any religious sect or organiza
tion. I believe the moral and re
ligious development of the Uni
versity will be better accom
plished if entirely free from all
denominational alliances, how
ever slight the bond may be."
In an earlier amendment. Mrs.
Stanford had directed that "no
ground shall ever be leased for a
boarding house, school, or resid
ence of any sort which shall be
held for the benefit of any reli
gious sect or denomination."
Mrs. Stanford also made a per
sonal request in a report to the
Trustees I hat the church be used
solely for religious purposes and
that the chapel be used "as it
has been in the past for lectures
and for such prayer meetings and
preaching as the Young Men's
and Young Women's Christian
Associations may wish."
"I have always felt these asso
ciations have hallowed this build
ing," she continued, "1 would ever
preserve this chapel for purposes
above and beyond the ordinary
class recitation."
