## 
### 
Monsoon-like rain deluged the
Stanford campus yesterday, turn
ing the campus into a mass of

las, and soaked textbooks.
Water measured four inches
deep in front of the Daily shack

in front of the Western Civ lib
rary. Flooding was reported on
Palm Drive. Water leaking
through the roof of the Theta Chi
house was reported flooding the
kitchen and the basement.
The fire department reported j
the usual calls of basement flood
ing and downed wires but termed
it "normal conditions."
The rain did not lower attend
ance at the Existentialism lec
tures and the History seminar
presented last night, however.
Robert Funk, program coordina
tor for Tresidder, said students
had to be turned away from the
Existentialism lecture and that
the seminar had to be moved to
Cubberley auditorium.
Although he did not have spec
ific figures, Funk said he thought
eating at the union had slacked
off because of the loss of open
eating areas. Although the crowd
inside was average, he said busi
ness slacked off because people
could not eat outside.
According to the Associated
Press, the storm caused power
blackouts and minor damage
throughout the Bay area. A re
port circulated that the Golden
Gate Bridge was swaying and
be closed, but bridge authorities
said there was nothing to it.
