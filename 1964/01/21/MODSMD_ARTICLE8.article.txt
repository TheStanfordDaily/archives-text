Offering proposals for alter
natives to military service and
ear lying posters reading, "Wars
will cease when men refuse mili
tary service," members of Stan
ford's peace caucus of the Poli
tical Union began picketing the
Naval ROTC recruiting van
yesteday and will continue picket
ing throughout the week.
A mimeographed sheets dis
tributed along with literature for
conscientious objectors by the
peace pickets reads, "The mili
tary forces of the United States,
represented by this Navy recruit
ing van, arc threatening the life
of every human being on earth.
Their inescapable duty, killing
people, can now be executed so
effectively and so efficiently that
no recognizable remnant of the
human race can be expected to
survive another major war. . . .
This death machine purports to
prevent war, preserve peace, and
secure the American way of life."
BUT THE ONLY WAY to pre
serve peace is by peaceful means,
the statement goes on. "Each of
us must, in the most practical
and political way possible, say no
to war in all its guises. We must
refuse military service; we must
refuse paying the taxes that sup
port the military machine; we
must refuse working for defense
industries. As the only alternative
we must learn the ways to or
ganize our society nonviolently."
The three naval recruitment of
ficers in charge of the van were
all in agreement that the pickets
had every right to be there. Com
mander Butler stated, "It's a free
world. They can be out there as
well as we can." Chief Lindy ad
ded, "We like them. They bring
business."
Chief Delaney called the dem
onstration "very interesting . . .
to say the least," and recalled a
demonstration by pacifists at
Stanford three years ago. The
demonstration then, however, had
over twenty participants, while
fewer pickets are taking part in
today's demonstration. Remem
bering the previous demonstra
tion, Chief Delaney said it was
the only time there was a real
showing. The officers recalled
that one pacifist picket wore an
Air Force ROTC uniform.
Tin; OFFICERS lIAYE also en
countered pickets at San Jose
State and San Francisco State.
They noted that the pamphlet be
ing passed out at Stanford is the
same as the one passed out at San
•lose.
Commander Butler commented,
"Our purpose here is to he avail
able tor information as to how
students can receive a commis
sion from the navy."

demonstration then, however, had
over twenty participants, while
fewer pickets are taking part in
today's demonstration. Remem
bering the previous demonstra
tion, Chief Delaney said it was
the only time there was a real
showing. The officers recalled
that one pacifist picket wore an
Air Force ROTC uniform.
Tin; OFFICERS lIAYE also en
countered pickets at San Jose
State and San Francisco State.
They noted that the pamphlet be
ing passed out at Stanford is the
same as the one passed out at San

Commander Butler commented,
"Our purpose here is to he avail
able tor information as to how
students can receive a commis

Offering proposals for alter
natives to military service and
ear lying posters reading, "Wars
will cease when men refuse mili
tary service," members of Stan
ford's peace caucus of the Poli
tical Union began picketing the
Naval ROTC recruiting van
yesteday and will continue picket
ing throughout the week.
A mimeographed sheets dis
tributed along with literature for
conscientious objectors by the
peace pickets reads, "The mili
tary forces of the United States,
represented by this Navy recruit
ing van, arc threatening the life
of every human being on earth.
Their inescapable duty, killing
people, can now be executed so
effectively and so efficiently that
no recognizable remnant of the
human race can be expected to
survive another major war. . . .
This death machine purports to
prevent war, preserve peace, and
secure the American way of life."
BUT THE ONLY WAY to pre
serve peace is by peaceful means,
the statement goes on. "Each of
us must, in the most practical
and political way possible, say no
to war in all its guises. We must
refuse military service; we must
refuse paying the taxes that sup
port the military machine; we
must refuse working for defense
industries. As the only alternative
we must learn the ways to or
ganize our society nonviolently."
The three naval recruitment of
ficers in charge of the van were
all in agreement that the pickets
had every right to be there. Com
mander Butler stated, "It's a free
world. They can be out there as
well as we can." Chief Lindy ad
ded, "We like them. They bring
business."
Chief Delaney called the dem
onstration "very interesting . . .
to say the least," and recalled a
demonstration by pacifists at
Stanford three years ago. The
demonstration then, however, had
over twenty participants, while
fewer pickets are taking part in
today's demonstration. Remem
