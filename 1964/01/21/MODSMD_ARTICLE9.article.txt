President Sterling's annual convocation address in Memorial
Auditorium today "will discuss the role of the University in modern
society, the pressures brought against it, and in this context, the
role of the Stanford student—both undergraduate and graduate,"
the Daily was told yesterday by the President's Executive assistant,

►Frederick Glover.
Glover said that it "will not be
a balance sheet of the University
or a report of the University's fi
nances."

and faculty members may attend
the President's state of the Uni

a day of questions, opinions, and
criticisms to the Administration.
