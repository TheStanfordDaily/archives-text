OPEN DAILY AND EVENINGS
Dark Days Ahead
To many people today, man is his own Coil. It is claimed that man himself has the j
j power to control his destiny and cultural evolution. Many naively believe that man
I will be able to bring about world peace by his own endeavors. Christians arc ccr
i j.iinly among those who hope for world peace on earth; however, they know that
I this can never come about by man's efforts apart from God. .Man's depraved nature
I must be changed, regenerated by God before he has the ability to live a moral rinht-
I eons life. The problems in the world today are all the result of sin and man'- basic
' nature is sinful. This is why God never reworks the old nature of a person who
j becomes a Christian, but instead gives this person an entirely new nntnre:
"Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed
away; behold all things are become new." II (\>r. 5:17.
i As world leaders renew their efforts for world peace and strive for Christian unity,
I the prophetic portions of Scripture should be kept clearly in mind.for the last days
I on earth will be very dark indeed, before the I.ord Jesus Christ returns to bring about
I his Ion;: -ought reign of peace and righteousness.
I "When he (Jesus) was sitting on the Mount of Olives the disciples came to speak
| t,i him privately. 'Tell us,' they said, 'when will this happen? And what will be the
-inal for your coining and the end of the ag< . Jesus repicld: 'lake care that no
1 one misleads you. For many will come claiming my name and saying, "I am the
j Messiah," and many will be misled by them. The time is coming when you will hear
the noise oi battle near at hand and the news of battles far away; s, e that you are
| not alarmed Such things arc bound to happen; but the end is still to come. For
: nation will t'ise up against nation, kingdom against kingdom; there will be famines
and eathqu.-ik- s in many places. With all these things the birth pangs of the new
age begin. You will then be handed over for punishment and execution; and men
of ill nations will hate you for your allegiance to me. Many will lose their faith;
they will betray one another and hate one another. Many false prophets will arise
and will mislead many, and as lawlessness spreads, men's love for one another
w ill grow eold. Hut the man who holds out to the end will be saved. And this Gospel
of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the rcath as a testimony to all nations;
and then tin end w ill come . . .
"It will be a time of great distress, such as has never been from the beginning of
the world until now, and will never be again. If that time oi troubles were not
cut short, no living thing could survive, hut for the sake of God's chosen it will be
cut short. ... As s.Kin ;is the distress of those days is passed, the sun will be
darkened, the moon will not give her light, the stars will fall from the sky, the
celestial powers will be shaken_ Then will appear in heaven the sign that heralds
the Son of Man. All the peoples of the world will make lamentation, and they «ill
see tlie Son of Man coining on the clouds of heaven with great power and glory.
With a trumpet blast lie will send out his an > Is, nnd th< - will irather hi- chosen
! from the four winds, from the farthest bounds of heaven on every side. ... He
! will sit in state on his throne, with all the nation . gathered before him. lie will
j separate men into two groups, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats,
he will place the sheep on his right hand and the goats on hi 1< ft. I hen the king
