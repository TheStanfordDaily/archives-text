# Manuel Views 19th Century Philosophies of History
## 
### MIRIAM BETENSKY 
Tiie difference in style and temper between the French and Ger
man schools of philosophy in the nineteenth century was the topic
of Dr. Frank Manuel's Tuesday lecture last night.
"Leaps into Free Consciousness; Resonances from the German
Academy" was Manuel's topic lor the sixth in the Harry Camp lec-

ture series. Manuel is Professor
of History at Brandeis Univer
sity.
HEGEL FELT that all world
history is really the history of a
few rare periods of perfection, a
few "chosen moments in chosen

societies." All the rest is "in
choate barbarism or decay." Op
posed to this is ihe optomistic
i French view of progress toward
| a more perfect society.
Manuel explained that the
j French concentrated on novelties,
i material conquests, "le bonheur
Ide l'existance." The Germans
were interested in the education
of the human race and had a
! sense of "the pain and anguish of
| growth."
Hegelianism dominated Marx,
Manuel explained, but he really
had a hybrid philosophy of his
tory derived from the time he was
Jan expat riot in France. From the
i French he derived a sense of ihe
I directing force of technical ino
' vat ion, utilitarianism, and ma
| terialism, and learned to appre
: date the working class problems
j in the Paris of 1810.
FURTHER CONTRASTING the
two philosophies, Manuel said
that the French felt that men ob
tain the society they seek, and
programs may be accelerated
through reform. Hegel, on the
other hand, felt that a free society
is achieved in spite of human ele
ments. It is spirit, not man. that
lays down the rules of human
destiny.
According to Hegel, the Ger
mans had a higher form of spirit
than other philosophers because
of a pure race. Miscegenation,
the mixture of German and Latin
blood, in the French and others
caused them to "fail to achieve
innerness" and be "mongrel and
polluted." Manuel commented that
such a philosophy that tends to
regard any mixture as fatal is
itself fatal. The French looked
on cross-fertilization as a high
good, while the Germans viewed
it as "destructive of values, stylo,
identity, structure, and growth."
Manuel emphasized that, the
essential difference between the
' two philosophies is that the
i French regarded progress as con
tinuous and subject to rapid
change, while the Germans felt
progess was discontinuous and
beyond human will to alter.

regard any mixture as fatal is
itself fatal. The French looked
on cross-fertilization as a high
good, while the Germans viewed
it as "destructive of values, stylo,
identity, structure, and growth."
Manuel emphasized that, the
essential difference between the
' two philosophies is that the
i French regarded progress as con
tinuous and subject to rapid
change, while the Germans felt
progess was discontinuous and
beyond human will to alter.
Tiie difference in style and temper between the French and Ger
man schools of philosophy in the nineteenth century was the topic
of Dr. Frank Manuel's Tuesday lecture last night.
"Leaps into Free Consciousness; Resonances from the German
Academy" was Manuel's topic lor the sixth in the Harry Camp lec-

ture series. Manuel is Professor
of History at Brandeis Univer
sity.
HEGEL FELT that all world
history is really the history of a
few rare periods of perfection, a
few "chosen moments in chosen

societies." All the rest is "in
choate barbarism or decay." Op
posed to this is ihe optomistic
i French view of progress toward
| a more perfect society.
Manuel explained that the
j French concentrated on novelties,
i material conquests, "le bonheur
Ide l'existance." The Germans
were interested in the education
of the human race and had a
! sense of "the pain and anguish of
| growth."
Hegelianism dominated Marx,
Manuel explained, but he really
had a hybrid philosophy of his
tory derived from the time he was
Jan expat riot in France. From the
i French he derived a sense of ihe
I directing force of technical ino
' vat ion, utilitarianism, and ma
| terialism, and learned to appre
: date the working class problems
j in the Paris of 1810.
FURTHER CONTRASTING the
two philosophies, Manuel said
that the French felt that men ob
tain the society they seek, and
programs may be accelerated
through reform. Hegel, on the
other hand, felt that a free society
is achieved in spite of human ele
ments. It is spirit, not man. that
lays down the rules of human
destiny.
According to Hegel, the Ger
mans had a higher form of spirit
than other philosophers because
of a pure race. Miscegenation,
the mixture of German and Latin
blood, in the French and others
caused them to "fail to achieve
innerness" and be "mongrel and
polluted." Manuel commented that
such a philosophy that tends to
regard any mixture as fatal is
itself fatal. The French looked
on cross-fertilization as a high
good, while the Germans viewed
it as "destructive of values, stylo,
identity, structure, and growth."
