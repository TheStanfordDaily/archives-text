# HUTCHINSON'S GOAL
## More Chaplains, One Church 
### BILL MOORE Staff Editor (Tenth in a Series) 
Stanford should enlarge t li e j
chaplain's staff and establish a
"multi-purpose church." Profes
sor Eric Hutchinson, chairman of
the Student Affairs and Services
Committee, told the Daily.
"We definitely could use more
chaplains," said Hutchinson, j
There should be at least four or:
five on the staff. It's nearly aj
fulltime job just to visit the Stan-!
ford Hospital. Chaplain Minto j
does a manful job, but he needs j
help on this."
HUTCHINSON, a member of
the Chemistry faculty, said Me
morial Church won't be "turned

| into an Air Force chapel" — with
a revolving altar — in the next
five years. "But I have no objec
tion to this," lie added. "This is
what I'd do."
Hutchinson said he was opposed
to suggestions that the Univer
sity build a small Catholic chapel
and Jewish synagogue on campus.
"The next thing you know every
body else will want in," he ex-
I plained. "The best thing is to have
| all worship in one single building.
;. . . I don't see what would be
| offensive to anyone — including
Jews — to have services in Me
morial Church."
ACCORDING TO Hutchinson,
there are "a lot of people who
don't worship who demand free
dom of religion. With them, this
is a manufactured issue. They're
thinking of a freedom they have
no intention of using."
The chemistry professor pointed
oul that any religious group can
hold closed meetings on campus,
under the sponsorship of ihe Com
mittee on Religious Activities. "As
a matter of fact, they're even let
ting Billy Graham come here in
two years," he said.
Hutchinson also noted that
"it's not that difficult" to worship
in off-campus churches — since
car rides are offered students by
i many churches in the area.
"PALO ALTO churches do ex
tend warm welcomes to our stu
dents, and I don't think it's bad
to worship with denominations in
the community. If students just
worship with other students on
campus, we will become narrow,
little sects.
"There will develop precious,
trim little groups, which can fall
into the Christian sin of selfish
pride. That's why students should
join off-campus groups."
Hutchinson said he has ob
served an increasing student in
terest in religion recently.
"More and more students come
! to me now who would rather talk
about religion than chemistry.
I It's not tho same as commitment,
but students are inquiring more.
, "And this concern could spill over
into commitment."
