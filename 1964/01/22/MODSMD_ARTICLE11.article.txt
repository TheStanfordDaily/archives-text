will lecture tonight on the pre
got hie timber architecture of the
middle ages. A part of Ihe Art
and Architecture Department's
regular series, the speech will he

Most buildings of this type have
been lost to fire and rot over the

reconstructed from old records.
Professor Horn has hunted out
these survivals, finding in them
clues to the still undiscovered
origins of got hie masonry.
