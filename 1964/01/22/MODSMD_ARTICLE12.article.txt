# Sterling Defines Dilemma Facing Modern University
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
"I believe that the university cannot and should not avoid en
tanglement with its society, and cannot avoid responding to the
changing expedients and pressures of the world beyond the campus
I also believe that the university -— what John Gardner calls 'thu
inner city of the university' — can and should be above the storms
which these expedients and pres-+

sures blow up."
THESE WERE the paradoxical
tenns in which Stanford Presi
dent Wallace Sterling character
ized the philosophical and moral
dilemma facing the American
university in a modern and in
creasingly complex society. Ster
ling addressed the student body
yesterday morning during the
Stanford Today and Tomorrow
convocation.
In the body of his address Ster
ling attempted a definition of the
changing nature of society's de
mands upon the university and
the university's response to these
demands. His approach was gen
eral, often historical, but during
the course of his remarks, he

touched upon several issues which
find specific embodiment in cur
rent Stanford debates — the ques
tion of academic freedom and aca
demic responsibility, the ideal na
ture of a general studies approach
to education, the value of extra
curricular activities, and the
"rebel" and his place in the aca
demic community.
According to Sterling, the single
most pressing, most difficult
challenge facing modern society,
and the modern university within
that society, involves the effec
tive harnessing of complexity—
a complexity which tends to over
whelm and stereotype human ef
forts. The modern, "multiversity"
is crucially involved in a "contest
between individualism and organi
zation."
"ORDER AND PURPOSE re
quire discipline." said Sterling.
"Life, growth, and adaptation re
quire continuous renewal. The
individual is the key to order and
discipline on t ho one hand, and
to the vitality of renewal on the
other."
He continued, "Similarly an in
stitution depends on the individ
ual for renewal and revitiliza
tion." The President concluded by
suggesting that each student mea
sure ihe value and success of his
own education in terms of his
capacity and accomplishments in
self-discipline and self renewal.
Sterling began his address by
reminding his audience that "we
live in an exciting and uncertain
period of history." He emphasized
that since World War I.the speed
of change — both technological
and social has increased at an
almost geometric rate. Accord
ingly, society's demands upon
higher education have increased
' in scope and intensity.
FIRST, Sterling spoke of the
quantitative, physical means by
which the universities are at
tempting to respond to these new
demands. He concluded. "Th e
arithmetic oL' higher education's
response to society's demands,
then, is to multiply the number
of colleges, universities, and in
stitutes, to expand student enroll
ment. to enlarge faculty and staff,
to provide larger and improved
! physical facilities and resources,
and to finance all this by attract
ing more gift and particularly
more tax support." But Sterling
saw more than arithmetic in the
challenge to a modern university.
Sterling initially divided this
"non-arithmetic" response of the
university to its society into cur
ricular and extra-curricular char
acteristics. Speaking of the cur
ricular response, he stressed the
value of a flexible and varied
, program of general studies for
the undergraduate. In courses at
la more advanced level, the avoid
ance of both obsolence of knowl
edge and th proliferation of ex
= trcmely specialized course is es-
I sential, Sterling suggested.
Although emphasizing the stu
dent's academic record as para
mount, Sterling granted that
extra-curricular activity, and the
emergence of naturally endowed
J leaders, is both necessary and de
sirable in the context of the uni-
I versity microcosm.
Turning once again to the aca
demic profile of the university,
| Sterling cautioned against undue
I emphasis on academic freedom
at the expense of integrity and
; objective judgment: "Academic
I freedom must be more than a
Inirn of security behind whoso

protection random observations
can pass for scholarship, and the
tawdry and the commonplace for
the beautiful and the good. The
ledui n in the classroom is there
for subject matter teaching. It
is not a writing desk from which
a would-be Lord Chesterfield ad
dresses letters to his son. . . ."
IS THERE a place for the 'rebel'
and 'maverick' at Stanford? Ster
ling apparently thinks so "I
have a vivid memory of quite a
number" —- although he treated
the whole subject of rebellion
somewhat lightly. He queried, "1
continually ponder what it is that
the rebel proposes to rebel
against."
Sterling categorized, and then
dismissed, another kind of non
conformist those "who seem to
be disposed to create test cases."
He noted, "They do this by seeing
how little studying they can do
and still survive academically, or
by seeing how far they can go
in flaunting standards of personal
conduct and good taste and still
stay in school. . . ."
Sterling did not deprecate re
bellion which expresses itself in
constructive criticism, however.
He commented, "There are others
who may choose to consider ! hem
selves as rebels, whom I consider
not to be rebels at all. They are
merely critics. And like most
critics, they find it more blesesd
to give than to receive. . . . The
merit of criticism may be meas
ured by the care with which the
critic collects and weighs evi
dence. But criticism there should
be."
IN CONCLUSION, Sterling
turned again to the dilemma of
galloping complexity which be
sets the university community to
day. His emphasis was essentially
on the individual — his respon
sibility and discipline. He re
minded his audience that the two
key words for modern higher edu
cation — freedom and excellence
—"have no operative reality uti
les they are embodied in an in
dividual."
He concluded. "The University
does not prescribe what choices
you shall make or what vain e
you shall establish for yourself.
It affords you opportunity to seek
counsel about the choices and the
values, and it sets standards of
performance and conduct, below
which you may not fall. . . . Bui
above this level the ultimate
choice is yours. And this is as it
should be. Life is an exercise in
making choices and value judg
ments, and, in this context, life
I does not begin at forty, but much,
I much earlier."
