# Analysis Called for by President's Address
## 
### 
Several points made by President Sterling in his address
yesterday merit consideration and discussion, for in liis words
placed in a theoretical context may well lie the first steps to
ward concrete actions.
In speaking of the responsibilities of the university to the
society, President Sterling mentioned the "... tendency for
courses to proliferate, and for knowledge to bo presented in
fragments." He urged, "that every department provide . . .
an up-to-date and regular offering of courses central to the
discipline before it indulges in the proliferation of specialities
... which so often express the particular interest of the faculty
member rather than his attention to the best-balanced curric
ulum for the student." The President has often commented
critically upon the number and nature of course offerings.
There is certainly a principle upon which departments choose
course offerings, and undoubtedly there are those who agree as
well as disagree with President Sterling as to what constitutes
a "specialty." Hopefully his statement will elicit others.
On the subject of academic freedom, the President stated
that this freedom "must be more than a form of security behind
whose protection random observations can pass for scholar
ship. . . . The lectern in the classroom is there for subject
matter teaching. It is not a writing desk from which a would
be Lord Chesterfield addresses letters to his son." The Presi
dent must have a firm idea of what he means by "subject
matter teaching," just as others must have strong feelings of
what in addition to subject matter is communicated from pro
fessor to students in the classroom, and what relation this has
to academic freedom and the "random observations" of an
academician.
The President's words will not be the source of great aca
demic controversy, but much of what he said reveals the atti
tudes and values of a man who is a strong leader of a major
university. It is in these attitudes and values that can be found
the source of his actions and thereby much of the direction
taken by Stanford.
Whatever is revealed by what was said and what was not
said in yesterday's address, most can unite in a feeling of
appreciation that the President overcame what must have
been a great desire to speak of the University's technical and
financial aspects that have been so exciting in recent weeks.
This in itself was rewarding.
