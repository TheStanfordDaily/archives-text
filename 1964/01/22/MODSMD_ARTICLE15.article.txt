### 
For instance, the two great wars
of this century have intensified
and brought more sophistication
to studies of the causes of war.
The great depression of the 1930's
launched new and more far-reach
ing studies concerning economic
stability and adjustment. Tech
nological change, including auto
mation, together with a popula
tion increase, which is abetted by
improved medical science, have
produced problems of employ
ment, which in turn affect eco
nomic growth, all of which are
subjects of study. The Russian
Revolution of 1917 launched upon
the world a sovereign national
state with a political and eco
nomic system markedly different
from those then existing, and set
off a continuing competition and
conflict now symbolized by th e
phrase "Cold War." These deep
seated changes, as well as those
relating to the emergence of new
nations, have all been reflected
in our universities. The physical
and the biological scientist, the
engineer, the geologist, the social
scientist, the, humanist, have
necessarily felt the impact of and
the need to respond to these
changes, and have done so in
many ways. One needs only to
compare today's curricula of this
or any other major university
with the curircula of thirty years
ago to note the difference.
Universities, not least of all
those of this country, have been
affected also by increased demand
for their services. One such de
mand comes from an increasing
number of young men and wom
en. A greater percentage of col
lege-age population has chosen to
attend college. This choice found
expression first in this country,
and was making itself felt as this
century began. In the ensuing 60
years and more, it has produced
in the United States more educa
tional opportunity for a higher
percentage of population than
has been produced elsewhere.
But this sort of change or trend
is now increasingly evident in
other nations. The Soviet Union
has made education a major na
tional enterprise. The United
Kingdom has seen the enrollment
and the number of its chartered
universities increase dramatically
since the end of World War 11,
and, based on recommendations
of a recent Commission on Higher
Education, the British Govern
ment proposes further and more
rapid increase in the next decade.
Germany, France, Japan, Aus
tralia, and other nations are mov
ing in the same direction, as are
the newer nations of Asia and
Africa.
Demands other than the accom
modation of increased enrollments
are also made on universities.
National governments are in
creasingly the source of extra de
mands. In countries like Great
Britain, where about 80 per cent
of the financing of higher educa
tion comes from tax funds pro
vided by the British Treasury,
there is a heavy expenditure of
university staff time made in fi
nancial negotiations with the
Government. In this country,
there is also an increasing expen
diture of faculty and staff time
devoted to legislation affecting

education and taxes. And as gov
ernment itself has become more
complex, so has government
turned increasingly to university
personnel for service as techni
cal experts, counselors, and ad
visers. Just as our Federal Gov
ernment, concerned to lend assist
ance to developing countries, has
turned to students for service in
the Peace Corps, so has it been
turning to university faculties
for a wide range of services in
programs of assistance to these
same developing countries. Ex
amples such as these can readily
be multiplied. The fact is that the
demands on universities from so
ciety at large have never before
been so great, and they are in
creasing.
. . . How have universities at
tempted to respond to increased
demand for their services? To
accommodate larger enrollments,
colleges and universities have in
creased in number and size. In
crease in number and in size re
quires greater capital expenditure
for buildings, laboratory equip
ment, and library resources. It
also requires more faculty person
nel. These requirements should be
self-evident. How are the require
ments met? . . .
The need for increase of facul
ties is common to both the public
an d the private sectors of higher
education in this country, and to
universities in other countries as
well. The means of meeting this
need, as well as other urgent
needs, are to be found in graduate
and professional education. Here
is the source of the advanced
training with which to equip
young men and women who will
staff not only our colleges and
universities but also other pro
fessions such as law, medicine,
business, and government, and
who will make their careers in
private or publicly supported re
search.
Undergraduate students, with
their appropriate, understandable,
and immediate concern with the
nature and quality of undergrad
uate education, are often unaware
of the urgent and appropriate de
mand for more and better gradu
ate training. And this undergrad
uate unawareness exists even
though up to 80 per cent of under
graduates at universities like
Stanford will themselves eventu
ally go on to do graduate work.
THE ARITHMETIC of higher
education's response to society's
demands, then, is to multiply the
number of colleges, universities,
and institutes, to expand student
enrollment, to enlarge faculty
and staff, to provide larger and
improved physical facilities and
resources, and to finance all this
by attracting more gift and par
ticularly more tax support.
But surely there is more to this
response than the arithmetic of
personnel, square feet, and dol
lars! Certainly there had better
be! And this other response will
differ from institution to institu
tion — from junior college to lib
eral arts college, to university.
And this difference, insofar as it
bespeaks diversity and variety,
will be useful and healthy.
What might be some of the
characteristics of this other type,

this non-arithmetical type of re
sponse? One characteristic, I
should think, would certainly be
curricular. Colleges and univer
sities will vary in their require
ments for general education or
general studies. But I strongly
believe in the value of such re
quirements so that students may
have at least an introduction to
those areas of learning which
concern themselves with the
physical and life sciences, with
the social sciences which deal
with the history, structure, and
behavior of society, and with the
humanities which deal with man's
expressions of himself in lan
guage and literature, philosophy,
music, and art. And given the dif
ferences in individual students
for college, I would argue for
flexibility in applying the require
ments of general studies or gen
eral education, so that the more
gifted and better prepared s t u
dents should receive recognition
and credit — advanced place
ment it is called — appropriate
to their attainments.
In the more advanced courses

which students take in connection
with their major, it is important
to avoid obsolescence. This may
bo especially critical in the
sciences and in engineering,
where the rapid rate at which
new knowledge is being accumu
lated would seem to justify em
phasis on basic principles an d
methods. But knowledge in other
fields does not stand still — and
as it grows and accumulates
there seems to bo a tendency for
courses to proliferate, and for
knowledge to .be presented in
fragments. It is important to fac
ulty and student alike that oppor
tunity for intensive study of a
specialty be provided, but I would
urge that every department in
the university provide as its first
responsibility an up-to-date and
regular offering of courses cen
tral to the discipline before it in
dulges in the proliferation of spe
cialties — specialties which so
often express the particular inter
est of the faculty member leather
than his attention to the best
balanced curriculum for the stu
dent. . . .
