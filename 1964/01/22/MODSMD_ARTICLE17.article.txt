GOVERNOR BROWN
Editor, The Daily:
If Governor Brown's defense of
the present state birth control
policy is to be compelling, he must
show more clearly how a birth
control program (e.g., voluntary
instruction in public high schools
or junior colleges) would differ
in principle from present we 1-
fare programs. Surely a govern
ment combatting overpopulation
no more trespasses on the public
morality than a government com
batting unemployment, ignorance,
or discrimination.
If the present state welfare
policy does point to an employed,
educated, fairly-treated citizenry,
what greater long-run obstacle
does it face than the population
explosion ?
ALLEN DULL
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the Daily's highly
complimentary article on the re
cent pep talk given by California's
own Governor Brown, I feel com
pelled to offer an analysis in a
somewhat more critical vein.
From the viewpoint of a
staunch Democrat who was inter
ested in hearing a Figure of Im
portance repeat the tenets of his
faith by rote this was of course
an entertaining and morally up
lifting lecture — but for the aver
age politically-interested student
who goes to hear a man such as
Brown speak in hopes of hearing
some challenging new ideas it
was a profitless afternoon.

In his talk the Governor did
the following: He praised democ
racy, Kennedy, and the Constitu
tion. He praised the "especially
privileged" (ever heard that
phrase?) students of Stanford
and told us we had a great future.
He praised the role of public ser
vants (presumably including gov
ernors). the great, state of Cali
fornia, and some good, safe prin
ciples of American democracy.
He also quoted Abraham Lincoln,
Thomas Jefferson, and John F.
Kennedy. I guess he forgot
motherhood.
It was a well thought-out and
moderately eloquent statement of
a liberal policy, much of which I
personally agree with; but what
did it offer to the Stanford stu
dent that he couldn't find in a
Democratic Party leaflet? In
speaking to an audience that
thirsts for new ideas, for intellec
tual stimulation and maybe some
inspiration, Governor Brown
spoke in rather uninspiring plati
tudes. Shall we assume that he
underestimated his audience, or
that this speech represents th e
farthest reaches of his imagina
tion? Whatever the answer, I
suggest that anyone who has
heard a truly stimulating speaker
like the Reverend Coffin and has
contrasted him with Governor
Brown will have come to the con
clusion that in Brown we have a
rather unoriginal and certainly
unexciting speaker. I wonder if
his political worth corresponds
to his speaking ability.

dent that he couldn't find in a
Democratic Party leaflet? In
speaking to an audience that
thirsts for new ideas, for intellec
tual stimulation and maybe some
inspiration, Governor Brown
spoke in rather uninspiring plati
tudes. Shall we assume that he
underestimated his audience, or
that this speech represents th e
farthest reaches of his imagina
tion? Whatever the answer, I
suggest that anyone who has
heard a truly stimulating speaker
like the Reverend Coffin and has
contrasted him with Governor
Brown will have come to the con
clusion that in Brown we have a
rather unoriginal and certainly
unexciting speaker. I wonder if
his political worth corresponds
to his speaking ability.

GOVERNOR BROWN
Editor, The Daily:
If Governor Brown's defense of
the present state birth control
policy is to be compelling, he must
show more clearly how a birth
control program (e.g., voluntary
instruction in public high schools
or junior colleges) would differ
in principle from present we 1-
fare programs. Surely a govern
ment combatting overpopulation
no more trespasses on the public
morality than a government com
batting unemployment, ignorance,
or discrimination.
If the present state welfare
policy does point to an employed,
educated, fairly-treated citizenry,
what greater long-run obstacle
does it face than the population
explosion ?
ALLEN DULL
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the Daily's highly
complimentary article on the re
cent pep talk given by California's
own Governor Brown, I feel com
pelled to offer an analysis in a
somewhat more critical vein.
From the viewpoint of a
staunch Democrat who was inter
ested in hearing a Figure of Im
portance repeat the tenets of his
faith by rote this was of course
an entertaining and morally up
lifting lecture — but for the aver
age politically-interested student
who goes to hear a man such as
Brown speak in hopes of hearing
some challenging new ideas it
was a profitless afternoon.

In his talk the Governor did
the following: He praised democ
racy, Kennedy, and the Constitu
tion. He praised the "especially
privileged" (ever heard that
phrase?) students of Stanford
and told us we had a great future.
He praised the role of public ser
vants (presumably including gov
ernors). the great, state of Cali
fornia, and some good, safe prin
ciples of American democracy.
He also quoted Abraham Lincoln,
Thomas Jefferson, and John F.
Kennedy. I guess he forgot
motherhood.
It was a well thought-out and
moderately eloquent statement of
a liberal policy, much of which I
personally agree with; but what
did it offer to the Stanford stu
dent that he couldn't find in a
Democratic Party leaflet? In
speaking to an audience that
thirsts for new ideas, for intellec
tual stimulation and maybe some
inspiration, Governor Brown
spoke in rather uninspiring plati
tudes. Shall we assume that he
underestimated his audience, or
