ence will speak Thursday after

of "Eros ancl Social Thought."
The talk, which will be given in
Tresidder, .Room 267-8, is the sec
ond in a series of five programs
scheduled by Tresidder on th e
general subject of contemporary
social thought.
Professor Drekmeier plans to
focus his talk on Greek social
thought, particularly on that of
Plato. "I'm interested in the cre
ative element in social change,"
he says. "In discussing Plato, I
want to sec what light social sci
ence can throw on the Classics,
and also what insight we can gain
from the theories that have come
out of different types of social
structure and different ways of
symbolizing experience." Eros, in
Plato's thought, is seen by Drek
meier as a symbol of the unity of
experience.

to 2.">. Sign-ups will be taken and
