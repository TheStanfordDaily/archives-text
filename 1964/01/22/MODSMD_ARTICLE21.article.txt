# HOT LINE TO THE SIDELINE
## Girls in Sports? Not Yet, Anyway! 
### TOM ELIAS 
"Illinois Tennis Team Walks Off Courts" read the banner head
! line in the Chicago sports page last spring. Why? Because Wash
ington of St. Louis had dared to use a girl tennis player against
them. The Fighting Illini wore too chlvalric to fight (er play against)
women.
The St. Louis school's use of girl players was not contrary 1o a
recent NCAA ruling which permitted girls to compete with and
against men in certain sports. This was the ruling that allowed
i Tulane's swimmers lo have a girl as their top freestyler during the
second half of the season. It was the same rule that allowed the
i University of Alabama, still opposed to the use of Negroes, to have
j a girl as its "first man" in tennis.
The topic came up again during a recent conversation with Stan
ford athletic director Chuc! x'aylor. Somehow, the drift of talk
i turned to the AAWU tennis meet to he held on the Farm later this
spring. Taylor mentioned that the Big Six girls' tennis champion
ship will be held here also, in conjunction v\ith the men's tourney.
MAW PROBLEMS ARISE IN GIRLS' SPORTS
Asked if it wouldn't: be possible lo have separate girls' teams
I competing around the conference and country, just as the men's
squad does, Taylor brought up the manifold problems thai would
accrue from having girls traveling either together with men or
separately. These include such thorny dilemmas as housing and
chaperoning, to say nothing of cost.
The housing problem could be fairly easily solved by having a
separate hotel for men's and women's teams, or by putting them in
j separate wings of the same hotel. Chaperoning of the girls might
| be more difficult, as women's physical education instructors are not
nearly so plentiful as men's coaches. Surely, though, this could also
1 be solved by having men chaperone ihe girls.
Money, though is a bit more difficult problem to solve. Running
ihe intramural and regular physical education programs for men
takes about $250,000 dollars per year. This, on lop of the expenses
entailed by intercollegiate athletics. Currently the athletic depart
ment receives only about $70,000 dollars per year from the Univer
sity. The remainder of Ihe operating expenses are covered by re
ceipts from intercollegiate sports.
ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT HARD PUT ALREADY
These big-time athletics were making a tidy profit, mainly from
football attendance, up until about four years ago. In fact, a fat $650,-
000 dollars was what the athletic department had on the books when
the New York Giants moved to San Francisco. Their arrival together
with a drop in the teams' quality has cut so deeply into football
attendance during the early season that now only a bit over $200
j thousand of those original $650 thousand remains.
Intercollegiate athletics still break even, but the astronomical
operating expenses cut deeply into whatever they clear. Therefore
the men's athletic department has no money to finance the trans
portation and accommodations of women or any other additional
travelers. And the women's athletic department also lacks adequate
funds.
But, as Taylor says, if the men's athletic department is given
the funds, it will take on anything, even this.
WHO WANTS TO PLAY?
A more serious question is whether the girls would want to com
pete at all. This would not be too much of a problem if they were
only to compete against other girls. But what girl would want to
compete against men? As was pointed out by a previous subject of
this column, Julie Heldman, a Stanford sophomore and national girls
singles tennis champ, to beat a man at his own game is something
no girl in her right mind would do. And to make any men's loam,
she would have to do just that.
So, as far as Stanford goes at any rate, things w ill remain pretty
much the same with girls' sports. Whether they should or not is
a question for the higher authorities (the one's at the purse strings),
to decide.


STANFORD'S second leading scorer in conference games is guard
Kent Hinckley who has averaged 12.2 points over six games in
which the Indians are 3-3.

women.
The St. Louis school's use of girl players was not contrary 1o a
recent NCAA ruling which permitted girls to compete with and
against men in certain sports. This was the ruling that allowed
i Tulane's swimmers lo have a girl as their top freestyler during the
second half of the season. It was the same rule that allowed the
i University of Alabama, still opposed to the use of Negroes, to have
j a girl as its "first man" in tennis.
The topic came up again during a recent conversation with Stan
ford athletic director Chuc! x'aylor. Somehow, the drift of talk
i turned to the AAWU tennis meet to he held on the Farm later this
spring. Taylor mentioned that the Big Six girls' tennis champion
ship will be held here also, in conjunction v\ith the men's tourney.
MAW PROBLEMS ARISE IN GIRLS' SPORTS
Asked if it wouldn't: be possible lo have separate girls' teams
I competing around the conference and country, just as the men's
squad does, Taylor brought up the manifold problems thai would
accrue from having girls traveling either together with men or
separately. These include such thorny dilemmas as housing and
chaperoning, to say nothing of cost.
The housing problem could be fairly easily solved by having a
separate hotel for men's and women's teams, or by putting them in
j separate wings of the same hotel. Chaperoning of the girls might
| be more difficult, as women's physical education instructors are not
nearly so plentiful as men's coaches. Surely, though, this could also
1 be solved by having men chaperone ihe girls.
Money, though is a bit more difficult problem to solve. Running
ihe intramural and regular physical education programs for men
takes about $250,000 dollars per year. This, on lop of the expenses
entailed by intercollegiate athletics. Currently the athletic depart
ment receives only about $70,000 dollars per year from the Univer
sity. The remainder of Ihe operating expenses are covered by re
ceipts from intercollegiate sports.
ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT HARD PUT ALREADY
These big-time athletics were making a tidy profit, mainly from
football attendance, up until about four years ago. In fact, a fat $650,-
000 dollars was what the athletic department had on the books when
the New York Giants moved to San Francisco. Their arrival together
with a drop in the teams' quality has cut so deeply into football
attendance during the early season that now only a bit over $200
j thousand of those original $650 thousand remains.
Intercollegiate athletics still break even, but the astronomical
operating expenses cut deeply into whatever they clear. Therefore
the men's athletic department has no money to finance the trans
portation and accommodations of women or any other additional
travelers. And the women's athletic department also lacks adequate
funds.
But, as Taylor says, if the men's athletic department is given
the funds, it will take on anything, even this.
WHO WANTS TO PLAY?
A more serious question is whether the girls would want to com
pete at all. This would not be too much of a problem if they were
only to compete against other girls. But what girl would want to
compete against men? As was pointed out by a previous subject of
this column, Julie Heldman, a Stanford sophomore and national girls
singles tennis champ, to beat a man at his own game is something
no girl in her right mind would do. And to make any men's loam,
she would have to do just that.
So, as far as Stanford goes at any rate, things w ill remain pretty
much the same with girls' sports. Whether they should or not is
a question for the higher authorities (the one's at the purse strings),
to decide.


STANFORD'S second leading scorer in conference games is guard
