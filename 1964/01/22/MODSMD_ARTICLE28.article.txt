# Encina Seeks Artistic Touch

### JIM HAUSSER 
Eneina Hall has become an art
gallery in its own small way; it
would like to become one in its
own larger way.
Mr. Joseph Jedd (Student Ac.
counts Supervisor as the bu
reacracy calls him) has a taste
for modern art. He has hung
eleven a b s t r a c t compositions
along the walls oJ' Eneina Hall.
The compositions are a painful
change for many of the workers.
Formerly the gray monotony
was broken only by "pretty" pas
tel landscapes. Though students
paid bills in Eneina for years, few
noticed or commented on the
paintings. It's too late now. The
hazy renderings of Alpine coun
tryside are gone, and in their
place hang stark abstracts.
Reaction to the substitution has
been as strong as the new compo
sitions themselves. Though stu
dents seem very much in favor
of the change, t he sore-eyed clerks
would like to see the Alpine land
scapes back.
The original plan for the change
was to give Stanford students a
place to exhibit their works. The
idea, though generous, has en
countered several setbacks. Mr.
Jedd contacted the Stanford art
department, but the enthusiastic
department somehow failed to
produce any works for exhibit.
After several unsuccessful at
tempts, Mr. Jedd turned to cam
pus talent, calling on Ali Jabri,
foreign student from Saudi Ara
bia. Jabri contracted d o u b 1 e
pneumonia before he could com
plete anything. Jedd then de
cided to go to the "outside
world." He persuaded Mrs. Ralph ;
Dicker, a noted Palo Alto artist, ;

lo contribute the paintings. She
agreed lo lend the works for two
months without charge.
Warning no one, Jedd strode
into the Office of the Cashier
shortly after 5:00 last Monday
with four of Mrs. Dicker's paint
ings under his arm. Down came
the pastorals and up went the
abstracts in spite of protests by
the people still on duty.
One of tlie pieces is a wild
composition in wood. A rectangle
of jutting borders separates mul
ticolored panels—oranges, reds,
purples, and flourescent pinks ca
vort on a yellow background. It
is entitled "Triptych to Essence
of Being."
To the right of "Triptych" and
just above the neat, Roman
capital signs, "Checks Cashed,"
"Chemistry Deposit," and "Mis
cellaneous," hangs an orange and
black protozoan form swimming
on a green backdrop.
After this exhibit the walls of i
Encina will be open for contribu
tions from students. Jedd will I
hang works in whatever way and
with whatever frame the artist
designates including pricetags.

opened his office, 144 Encina, to
students who would like to have
some of their works exhibited.

some of their works exhibited.
Eneina Hall has become an art
gallery in its own small way; it
would like to become one in its
own larger way.
Mr. Joseph Jedd (Student Ac.
counts Supervisor as the bu
reacracy calls him) has a taste
for modern art. He has hung
eleven a b s t r a c t compositions
along the walls oJ' Eneina Hall.
The compositions are a painful
change for many of the workers.
Formerly the gray monotony
was broken only by "pretty" pas
tel landscapes. Though students
paid bills in Eneina for years, few
noticed or commented on the
paintings. It's too late now. The
hazy renderings of Alpine coun
tryside are gone, and in their
place hang stark abstracts.
Reaction to the substitution has
been as strong as the new compo
sitions themselves. Though stu
dents seem very much in favor
of the change, t he sore-eyed clerks
would like to see the Alpine land
scapes back.
The original plan for the change
was to give Stanford students a
place to exhibit their works. The
idea, though generous, has en
countered several setbacks. Mr.
Jedd contacted the Stanford art
department, but the enthusiastic
department somehow failed to
produce any works for exhibit.
After several unsuccessful at
tempts, Mr. Jedd turned to cam
pus talent, calling on Ali Jabri,
foreign student from Saudi Ara
bia. Jabri contracted d o u b 1 e
pneumonia before he could com
plete anything. Jedd then de
cided to go to the "outside
world." He persuaded Mrs. Ralph ;
Dicker, a noted Palo Alto artist, ;

lo contribute the paintings. She
agreed lo lend the works for two
months without charge.
Warning no one, Jedd strode
into the Office of the Cashier
shortly after 5:00 last Monday
with four of Mrs. Dicker's paint
ings under his arm. Down came
the pastorals and up went the
abstracts in spite of protests by
the people still on duty.
One of tlie pieces is a wild
composition in wood. A rectangle
of jutting borders separates mul
ticolored panels—oranges, reds,
purples, and flourescent pinks ca
vort on a yellow background. It
is entitled "Triptych to Essence
of Being."
To the right of "Triptych" and
just above the neat, Roman
capital signs, "Checks Cashed,"
"Chemistry Deposit," and "Mis
cellaneous," hangs an orange and
black protozoan form swimming
on a green backdrop.
After this exhibit the walls of i
Encina will be open for contribu
tions from students. Jedd will I
hang works in whatever way and
with whatever frame the artist
designates including pricetags.
