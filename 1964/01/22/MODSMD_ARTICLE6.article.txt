Additional housing for under
graduate women is in the offing,
as well as plans for new under
graduate men's residences, accord
ing to Dr. Robert Wert, Vice-
Provost and Dean of Undergradu
ate Education.
Plans for a residence to house
345 women, located adjacent to
Florence Moore Hall and the first
fraternity cluster, were discussed
at the Board of Trustees meeting
on December 19. The plans will
now go to the Buildings and
Grounds Committee and the Com
mittee on Finances.
The total budget for the dorm
will be $4 million, Wert predicts,
and it is hoped a portion of this
amount can be obtained from the
FHA. However, there will be
about $3 million left to be raised
from private sources.
The proposed dorm will include
five separate houses and a central
dining room and kitchen. There
will be 6<S students and one Resi
dent Assistant in each house, with
22 singles and 23 doubles planned.
Plans aalso in progress for
a companion building to Roble
Hall which, together with Roble,
will house the freshman women.
These plans have only been re
ported to the trustees in a general
fashion.
Attention is also being focused
on men's residences. Wert ex
plained that while it would be de
sirable to have all undergraduates
living on campus, a third of the
undergraduate men must now
seek off-campus housing.
Part of the funds are available
for the "Knoll cluster" of men's
houses provided for in the Flor
ence Moore will. Two of the four
dorms are in the design stage.
Each residence will house 65 men.
Stern House lounges are also
due for renovation, hopefully this
summer, Wert said.
