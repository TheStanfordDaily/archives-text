# Berliner Reveals Student Life
## 
### WERNER MEISSNER Berlin Graduate Exchange Student 
Thai is the slogan of the Ber
lin tourist officc: "Berlin is worth
a trip." And there are many tour
ists around there from West Ger
many or from abroad who come
there and sightsee and for whom
the wall is just another attrac
tion. Maybe you will have the
same tourist's feeling when you
arrive in Berlin as an exchange
student on a warm autumn day
of this year. (The deadline for
applications for one of those fel
lowships is Jan. 21th. )
There is one thing more which
adds to this comfortable feeling:
You will not have to worry about
looking for a room or an apart
ment, a problem every German
student has to cope with because
the housing situation is still
pretty bad in Berlin, and that is
without doubt a very effective
way to get both feet on the
ground and to get acquainted
with people and places in a more
or less pleasant way. You will
have a room in the students' vil
lage. It is a nice little community,
the living rules of which you will
surely appreciate.
IT WILL take time to lose the
tourist's feeling. But there are
certain things which will work in
this direct ion:

• People will ask you for your
I opinion about the American pol
icy towards Berlin. So you will
; have to take a look at the recent
! history of that town. A good way
to lose your tourist's point of
view.
• There will be the dilemma of
whether to go to a lecture (there
will surely be some worth your
attendance) or whether to have
a coffee at one of those places
on the sidewalk of the Kurfuer
stendamm or whether to line up
for a ticket for the next theater
premiere or whether to make off
to have a swim in Wannsce lake.
Nobody tells you what to do and
nobody will blame you if you cut
a class. But when you know how
to balance your intentions to do
a good study .job (for which there
are excellent opportunities at Ber
lin University) and your wish to
do at least some of those many
things which this city has to offer,
you become a Berlin student.
• If you cross the wall more
than once or twice, not just in
older to see what is happening
"on the other side" (which is, of
course, a striking experience)
but to meet the people, you know
they are delighted to see you and
: have a chance to talk to you;
| then you've traded your tourist's
(opinion of Berlin for the opinion
10l a Berliner.

• Maybe you'll find the mensa
l food lousy. You will be amazed
j or amused about the different re-
I lationship between a student and
; his professor at a German uni
versity. Either you will like the
I aggressive sense of humor and
| the fast tongue of the Berliners
jor not. Probably you will join
one of those stirring rallies on
the Kennedy-Plat/ in front of the
city hall and most probably you
will be aware of the special situa
tion of this town you live in that
causes political excitement. This,
together with the cultural offer
| ings and the more relaxed atmos
phere of studies (il is called acad
emic freedom but Hi is has been
a big issue under discussion for
a long time and you will have
j something to contribute to these
! discussions > will make you feel
bad somehow when you have to
leave Berlin where you have lived
for one .scar.
Berlin has been featured in the
! headlines of the world press ever
i since the end of World War 11.
I This has not been the wish of the
| Berliners who would have pre-
I ferred to live a normal and more
; peaceful existence. You will find
j out what they are like. And I
I wish that you will find the same
: friendliness and hospitality which
I for a Berliner is the most, strik
ing fentlire of the Californians.
