TWO RESURRECTIONS
The Bible speaks of two resurrections (Rev. 20:4-6). For the believer
(who lias been made righteous through faith in Christ) the first resurree
tion is the time his spirit and soul will be given a new corruptible body:
"We want you not to remain ignorant, brothers, about those who slsep
in death; you should not grieve like the rest of men who have no hope.
We believe that Jesus died and rose again; and so it will be for those
who died ;is Christians; Cod will bring them to life with Jesus. For this
we tell you as the Lord's Word: we who are left alive until the Lord
comes shall not forestall those who have died; because at the word of
command, at the sound of (lie archangel's voice and Cods trumpet-call,
the Lord Himself will descend from heaven; first the Christian dead will
rise, then we who are alive shall join them, caught lip in clouds to meet
the Lord in the air. Thus, we shall always be with the Lord. Console one
another, then, with these words." 1 Thess. 4:13-17. \F.
The second resurrection is the raising of the unrighteous dead for
judgment. These dead are those who have rejected (Christ and refused
Cod's free gift of eternal life with Him.
"And 1 saw a great white throne, and the One (Christ) who sat upon it:
from his presence earth and heaven vanished, and no place was left lor
them. I could see the dead, great and small, standing before the throne;
and tlu' books were opened. Then another book was opened, the roll of
the living, 112 rom what was written in these books the dead were judged
upon the record of their deeds. The sea gave up its dead, and Death
and Hades gave up the dead in their keeping; they were judged, each
man on the record of his deeds. Then, Death and Hades were flung into
the Lake of Fire. The lake of fire is the second death; and into it were
Hung anv whose names were not to be found in the roll of the living.'
Rev. 20:11-15.
Is you name written in the Book of Life, the roll of the living? Or are
you among the lost? Cod is ever-faithful and unchanging. His Word
declares that the wicked dead w ill be cast into the Lake of Fire a place
of eternal conscious torment. None of us is without sin (Rom. 3:10).
However, Cod is not willing that any should be lost (2 Peter 3:9), and
Jesus Christ "is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto
Cod by Him, seeing he ever livcth to make intercession for them. ' Heb.
7:25. If you belong to Christ, you'll have no doubts about which group
you are in today. Cod is very, very real, and will not leave you in doubt
about your safety if you'll cominitt your life to Him.

TWO RESURRECTIONS
The Bible speaks of two resurrections (Rev. 20:4-6). For the believer
(who lias been made righteous through faith in Christ) the first resurree
tion is the time his spirit and soul will be given a new corruptible body:
"We want you not to remain ignorant, brothers, about those who slsep
in death; you should not grieve like the rest of men who have no hope.
We believe that Jesus died and rose again; and so it will be for those
who died ;is Christians; Cod will bring them to life with Jesus. For this
we tell you as the Lord's Word: we who are left alive until the Lord
comes shall not forestall those who have died; because at the word of
command, at the sound of (lie archangel's voice and Cods trumpet-call,
the Lord Himself will descend from heaven; first the Christian dead will
rise, then we who are alive shall join them, caught lip in clouds to meet
the Lord in the air. Thus, we shall always be with the Lord. Console one
another, then, with these words." 1 Thess. 4:13-17. \F.
The second resurrection is the raising of the unrighteous dead for
judgment. These dead are those who have rejected (Christ and refused
Cod's free gift of eternal life with Him.
"And 1 saw a great white throne, and the One (Christ) who sat upon it:
from his presence earth and heaven vanished, and no place was left lor
them. I could see the dead, great and small, standing before the throne;
and tlu' books were opened. Then another book was opened, the roll of
the living, 112 rom what was written in these books the dead were judged
upon the record of their deeds. The sea gave up its dead, and Death
and Hades gave up the dead in their keeping; they were judged, each
man on the record of his deeds. Then, Death and Hades were flung into
the Lake of Fire. The lake of fire is the second death; and into it were
Hung anv whose names were not to be found in the roll of the living.'
Rev. 20:11-15.
Is you name written in the Book of Life, the roll of the living? Or are
you among the lost? Cod is ever-faithful and unchanging. His Word
declares that the wicked dead w ill be cast into the Lake of Fire a place
of eternal conscious torment. None of us is without sin (Rom. 3:10).
However, Cod is not willing that any should be lost (2 Peter 3:9), and
Jesus Christ "is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto
Cod by Him, seeing he ever livcth to make intercession for them. ' Heb.
7:25. If you belong to Christ, you'll have no doubts about which group
you are in today. Cod is very, very real, and will not leave you in doubt
about your safety if you'll cominitt your life to Him.
