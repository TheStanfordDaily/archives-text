# CRA, Ministers Stress Ecumenism, Faster Progress
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Eleventh in a Series 
Ecumenism and a feeling of progress are the two parts
of the Stanford religious situation seen in the activities
and stressed by the denominational "campus ministers"
and the students of the Committee on Religious Affairs.
The ecumenical movement at Stanford has taken the
form of cooperation in the CRA and between the Chap
lain's office and the local denominational ministers. The
progress as the result of last spring's trustee decision now
allows for the first time open meetings on campus of
specific religious groups.
Ken Stevens. CRA chairman, states that "ideally every
student should ho very close to a place where ho could
worship freely. In the strictest sense, we don't have free
dom of worship."
"BUT VVE ARE fortunate that now everything but de
nominational worship is allowed on campus. Much that

now goes on would have been inconceivable two years
ago."
CRA—a student-run interfaith committee with repre
sentatives from all fifteen campus religious groups is in
charge of much "that, now goes on." The committee co
ordinates special speaking programs and arranges study
and discussion groups.
And, as a result of its members attending the Athens
Ecumenical Conference, the Committee is now trying to
become a forum for campus religious discussion. Its aim
is to bring religious involvement into other than strictly
religious activities; and this end, it will back this spring
the NSA Western States Civil Rights Conference.
The Trustee decision, according to Chairman Stevens,
gave the Committee greater responsibility and freedom in
tlie presentation of programs. It also has resulted in a
warmer liberal atmosphere among groups; "there is no
longer denominational bickering at Committee meetings
.and there is a trend to unified action, to wanting to under

stand other groups."
The Committee is under no immediate, constant juris
diction, but its power comes from the Chaplain.
TH E CAMPUS unity movement is summarized by
Father John Duryea, Roman Catholic priest for Stanford,
who says,"I feel more in common with the campus min
isters than with some priests. Many old priests object to
changes, are paternalistic and authoritarian and reject lay
involvement. The campus ministers now talk about any
thing with frankness and cordiality."
The fifteen ministers meet each Tuesday morning with
Chaplin Minto. The chaplain states: "We (the campus
religious leaders) are completely in touch and discuss our
joint programs and problems in an atmosphere of unity."
The Rev. John W. Duddington, chaplain of the Epis
copal center, Canterbury House, feels the recent changes
are encouraging and is pleased with the university chap
lain's willingness and desire to accept the cooperation of
the campus ministers.

ALL THE ministers talk of wanting at least counseling
and meeting space on campus, and this is in the long
range University plans. A church house, to l>e called
Gardiner Hall after first University chaplain, is to be
built behind Memorial Church. As of now, it has not been
financed.
Several of the ministers, however, wish to go farther
than merely a church house. Father Duryea hopes for
something like an army base chapel arrangement, where
one Mass a week could be said.
Hillel Director Dr. Harry May feels the ideal set up
would be "one large building on the campus where a stu
dent could find every denomination of his choice and where
all types of religious services were held."
Both trends, ecumenism and progress, are summed up
by Father Duryea: "There is now a greater intensity of
religious involvement on campus, and the University ad
ministration is moving in the right direction, even if it is
not moving as fast as we would like."

gave the Committee greater responsibility and freedom in
tlie presentation of programs. It also has resulted in a
warmer liberal atmosphere among groups; "there is no
longer denominational bickering at Committee meetings
.and there is a trend to unified action, to wanting to under

stand other groups."
The Committee is under no immediate, constant juris
diction, but its power comes from the Chaplain.
TH E CAMPUS unity movement is summarized by
Father John Duryea, Roman Catholic priest for Stanford,
who says,"I feel more in common with the campus min
isters than with some priests. Many old priests object to
changes, are paternalistic and authoritarian and reject lay
involvement. The campus ministers now talk about any
thing with frankness and cordiality."
The fifteen ministers meet each Tuesday morning with
Chaplin Minto. The chaplain states: "We (the campus
religious leaders) are completely in touch and discuss our
joint programs and problems in an atmosphere of unity."
The Rev. John W. Duddington, chaplain of the Epis
copal center, Canterbury House, feels the recent changes
are encouraging and is pleased with the university chap
lain's willingness and desire to accept the cooperation of
the campus ministers.

ALL THE ministers talk of wanting at least counseling
and meeting space on campus, and this is in the long
range University plans. A church house, to l>e called
Gardiner Hall after first University chaplain, is to be
built behind Memorial Church. As of now, it has not been
financed.
Several of the ministers, however, wish to go farther
than merely a church house. Father Duryea hopes for
something like an army base chapel arrangement, where
one Mass a week could be said.
Hillel Director Dr. Harry May feels the ideal set up
would be "one large building on the campus where a stu
dent could find every denomination of his choice and where
all types of religious services were held."
Both trends, ecumenism and progress, are summed up
by Father Duryea: "There is now a greater intensity of
religious involvement on campus, and the University ad
ministration is moving in the right direction, even if it is
not moving as fast as we would like."
Ecumenism and a feeling of progress are the two parts
of the Stanford religious situation seen in the activities
and stressed by the denominational "campus ministers"
and the students of the Committee on Religious Affairs.
The ecumenical movement at Stanford has taken the
form of cooperation in the CRA and between the Chap
lain's office and the local denominational ministers. The
progress as the result of last spring's trustee decision now
allows for the first time open meetings on campus of
specific religious groups.
Ken Stevens. CRA chairman, states that "ideally every
student should ho very close to a place where ho could
worship freely. In the strictest sense, we don't have free
dom of worship."
"BUT VVE ARE fortunate that now everything but de
nominational worship is allowed on campus. Much that

now goes on would have been inconceivable two years
ago."
CRA—a student-run interfaith committee with repre
sentatives from all fifteen campus religious groups is in
charge of much "that, now goes on." The committee co
ordinates special speaking programs and arranges study
and discussion groups.
And, as a result of its members attending the Athens
Ecumenical Conference, the Committee is now trying to
become a forum for campus religious discussion. Its aim
is to bring religious involvement into other than strictly
religious activities; and this end, it will back this spring
the NSA Western States Civil Rights Conference.
