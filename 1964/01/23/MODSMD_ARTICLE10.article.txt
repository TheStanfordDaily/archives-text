# Chaplain Calls Christians To Form United Council
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
The Committee for a Stanford Christian Council, meeting last
night in the Memorial Church Choir Room at the request of Chap
lain Minto, sought to find their common points of agreement and
their sense of future direction.
They agreed on their unity in Christ and to have a further meet-

ing next week. ♦
Chaplain Minto opened the
meeting by remarking that "we
serve a wide community; we
serve everybody in general a n d
nobody in particular. But all can
be done that needs to be done."
1110 CALLED for unity—bring
ing together students, faculty,
and denominational ministers
so that "we may combine on the
things that we now need to do
together."
The Chaplain called communi
cation among groups and from
the Christian community to the
whole University community one
of the greatest problems of Me
morial Church, and also cited the
need for a campus religious cen
ter. a united program for Lent,
and a regular public lecture ser
ies on religion.
The evening's discussion cen
tered on the attempt to define the
nature and purpose of the pro
posed Christian Council. Ques
tions raised were: what would be
unique about such a council; what
is the function of denominational
groups in the University commu
nity; what is the Christian mis
sion in a university; what can we
do as Christians to make an im
pact on the campus.
They felt Christians are not
relevant and have not been reach
ing people, which was Christ's
mission.
CHAPLAIN MINTO concluded
the meeting by saying that
"nothing has been more gratify
ing and encouraging than the re
cent meetings; never have we had
so many constructive ideas. The
question now is in what order do
we move toward our goals."
Last night's meeting was the
second of its type in the last two
weeks. On January 13, most of
the students who went to the
Athens Ecumenical Student Con
ference, many members of the
Memorial Church Committee,
three of the denominational min
isters, Chaplain Minto. and Assis
tant Chaplain John Tirrell met to

discuss the role of Memorial
Church in campus life.
THE STUDENTS from Athens
reported that the Conference had
crystalized their ideas of what
should be done at Stanford; that
they felt obligated to express
their commitment in more re
sponsible, meaningful ways than
they had in the past; and that
there is a need for Christian in
volvment and relevant activism.
With the premise that honest
questioning and re-evaluation is
healthy, the students stated:
(1) Memorial Church does not
reflect an active Christian at
titude of leadership toward the
whole community. Geographically
and symbolical! y, Memorial
Church is in a natural place to
exert this leadership.
(21 The role of Memorial
Church in campus life should be
more than just the conducting of
worship services. The Church has
not been involved in the commu
nity. There is a need for the de
velopment of a social awareness,
concern and involvement with the
life of the community.
(3) More guest preachers in res
idence would help to develop this
social awareness, as would com
munity service projects, such as
aid for East Palo Alto.
(4) A Christian commitment
means the willingness to be con
troversial and to question the
status quo. The prime example
is Christ.
CHAPLAIN MINTO said he
felt there was general agreement
and that renewal is needed. He
expressed a desire to work for
change when he sees what the
community wants and needs. He
was pleased that the questions
were raised in an open atmos
phere.
The role of the Committee on
Religious Affairs ( the student
run interfaith group) in the cur
rent examination of religion at
Stanford also underwent scrutiny
last week.
Meeting two days after (lit?
Athens group-Minto discussion,
the CRA (with many of its mem
bers from the Athens group* ap
proved unanimously a proposal
to form a committee which will
look into the existing situation
regarding worship on campus and
will make recommendations to
the University on changes in the
religious policy.
"Through this new Committee
for Religious Change," reports
Chairman Ken Stevens, "It is
hoped that a clearer picture of
the wishes and problems of the
various religious groups in the
area of worship will be reached."
"THERE WAS a general con
sensus of dissatisfaction with the
present situation which does not
permit any on-campus worship
other than that in Memorial
Church. Many groups cannot wor
ship there now, and many t hat
can prefer the denominational
services of Palo Alto churches."
The Committee, to publish its
report in about three weeks, be
gan working Tuesday by prepar
ing a questionnaire to be sent to
the fifteen religious groups rep
resented on CRA.

velopment of a social awareness,

life of the community.

CHAPLAIN MINTO said he
felt there was general agreement
and that renewal is needed. He
expressed a desire to work for
change when he sees what the
community wants and needs. He
was pleased that the questions
were raised in an open atmos
phere.
The role of the Committee on
Religious Affairs ( the student
run interfaith group) in the cur
rent examination of religion at
Stanford also underwent scrutiny
last week.
Meeting two days after (lit?
Athens group-Minto discussion,
the CRA (with many of its mem
bers from the Athens group* ap
proved unanimously a proposal
to form a committee which will
look into the existing situation
regarding worship on campus and
will make recommendations to
the University on changes in the
religious policy.
"Through this new Committee
for Religious Change," reports
Chairman Ken Stevens, "It is
hoped that a clearer picture of
the wishes and problems of the
various religious groups in the
area of worship will be reached."
"THERE WAS a general con
sensus of dissatisfaction with the
present situation which does not
permit any on-campus worship
other than that in Memorial
Church. Many groups cannot wor
ship there now, and many t hat
can prefer the denominational
services of Palo Alto churches."
The Committee, to publish its
report in about three weeks, be
gan working Tuesday by prepar
ing a questionnaire to be sent to
the fifteen religious groups rep
resented on CRA.
The Committee for a Stanford Christian Council, meeting last
night in the Memorial Church Choir Room at the request of Chap
lain Minto, sought to find their common points of agreement and
their sense of future direction.
They agreed on their unity in Christ and to have a further meet-

ing next week. ♦
Chaplain Minto opened the
meeting by remarking that "we
serve a wide community; we
serve everybody in general a n d
nobody in particular. But all can
be done that needs to be done."
1110 CALLED for unity—bring
ing together students, faculty,
and denominational ministers
so that "we may combine on the
things that we now need to do
together."
The Chaplain called communi
cation among groups and from
the Christian community to the
whole University community one
of the greatest problems of Me
morial Church, and also cited the
need for a campus religious cen
ter. a united program for Lent,
and a regular public lecture ser
ies on religion.
The evening's discussion cen
tered on the attempt to define the
nature and purpose of the pro
posed Christian Council. Ques
tions raised were: what would be
unique about such a council; what
is the function of denominational
groups in the University commu
nity; what is the Christian mis
sion in a university; what can we
do as Christians to make an im
pact on the campus.
They felt Christians are not
relevant and have not been reach
ing people, which was Christ's
mission.
CHAPLAIN MINTO concluded
the meeting by saying that
"nothing has been more gratify
ing and encouraging than the re
cent meetings; never have we had
so many constructive ideas. The
question now is in what order do
we move toward our goals."
Last night's meeting was the
second of its type in the last two
weeks. On January 13, most of
the students who went to the
Athens Ecumenical Student Con
ference, many members of the
Memorial Church Committee,
three of the denominational min
isters, Chaplain Minto. and Assis
tant Chaplain John Tirrell met to

discuss the role of Memorial
Church in campus life.
THE STUDENTS from Athens
reported that the Conference had
crystalized their ideas of what
should be done at Stanford; that
they felt obligated to express
their commitment in more re
sponsible, meaningful ways than
they had in the past; and that
there is a need for Christian in
volvment and relevant activism.
With the premise that honest
questioning and re-evaluation is
healthy, the students stated:
(1) Memorial Church does not
reflect an active Christian at
titude of leadership toward the
whole community. Geographically
and symbolical! y, Memorial
Church is in a natural place to
exert this leadership.
(21 The role of Memorial
Church in campus life should be
more than just the conducting of
worship services. The Church has
not been involved in the commu
nity. There is a need for the de
velopment of a social awareness,
concern and involvement with the
life of the community.

posed Christian Council. Ques
tions raised were: what would be
unique about such a council; what
is the function of denominational
groups in the University commu
nity; what is the Christian mis
sion in a university; what can we
do as Christians to make an im
pact on the campus.
They felt Christians are not
relevant and have not been reach
ing people, which was Christ's
mission.
CHAPLAIN MINTO concluded
the meeting by saying that
"nothing has been more gratify
ing and encouraging than the re
cent meetings; never have we had
so many constructive ideas. The
question now is in what order do
we move toward our goals."
Last night's meeting was the
second of its type in the last two
weeks. On January 13, most of
the students who went to the
Athens Ecumenical Student Con
ference, many members of the
Memorial Church Committee,
three of the denominational min
isters, Chaplain Minto. and Assis
tant Chaplain John Tirrell met to

discuss the role of Memorial
Church in campus life.
THE STUDENTS from Athens
reported that the Conference had
crystalized their ideas of what
should be done at Stanford; that
they felt obligated to express
their commitment in more re
sponsible, meaningful ways than
they had in the past; and that
there is a need for Christian in
volvment and relevant activism.
With the premise that honest
questioning and re-evaluation is
healthy, the students stated:
(1) Memorial Church does not
reflect an active Christian at
titude of leadership toward the
whole community. Geographically
and symbolical! y, Memorial
Church is in a natural place to
exert this leadership.
(21 The role of Memorial
Church in campus life should be
more than just the conducting of
worship services. The Church has
not been involved in the commu
nity. There is a need for the de
velopment of a social awareness,
concern and involvement with the
life of the community.
(3) More guest preachers in res
idence would help to develop this
social awareness, as would com
munity service projects, such as
aid for East Palo Alto.
(4) A Christian commitment
means the willingness to be con
troversial and to question the
status quo. The prime example
is Christ.
CHAPLAIN MINTO said he
felt there was general agreement
and that renewal is needed. He
expressed a desire to work for
change when he sees what the
community wants and needs. He
was pleased that the questions
were raised in an open atmos
phere.
The role of the Committee on
Religious Affairs ( the student
run interfaith group) in the cur
rent examination of religion at
Stanford also underwent scrutiny
last week.
Meeting two days after (lit?
Athens group-Minto discussion,
the CRA (with many of its mem
bers from the Athens group* ap
proved unanimously a proposal
to form a committee which will
look into the existing situation
regarding worship on campus and
will make recommendations to
the University on changes in the
religious policy.
"Through this new Committee
for Religious Change," reports
Chairman Ken Stevens, "It is
hoped that a clearer picture of
the wishes and problems of the
various religious groups in the
area of worship will be reached."
"THERE WAS a general con
sensus of dissatisfaction with the
present situation which does not
permit any on-campus worship
other than that in Memorial
Church. Many groups cannot wor
ship there now, and many t hat
can prefer the denominational
services of Palo Alto churches."
The Committee, to publish its
report in about three weeks, be
gan working Tuesday by prepar
ing a questionnaire to be sent to
the fifteen religious groups rep
resented on CRA.
The Committee for a Stanford Christian Council, meeting last
night in the Memorial Church Choir Room at the request of Chap
lain Minto, sought to find their common points of agreement and
their sense of future direction.
They agreed on their unity in Christ and to have a further meet-

ing next week. ♦
Chaplain Minto opened the
meeting by remarking that "we
serve a wide community; we
serve everybody in general a n d
nobody in particular. But all can
be done that needs to be done."
1110 CALLED for unity—bring
ing together students, faculty,
and denominational ministers
so that "we may combine on the
things that we now need to do
together."
The Chaplain called communi
cation among groups and from
the Christian community to the
whole University community one
of the greatest problems of Me
morial Church, and also cited the
need for a campus religious cen
ter. a united program for Lent,
and a regular public lecture ser
ies on religion.
The evening's discussion cen
tered on the attempt to define the
nature and purpose of the pro
posed Christian Council. Ques
tions raised were: what would be
unique about such a council; what
