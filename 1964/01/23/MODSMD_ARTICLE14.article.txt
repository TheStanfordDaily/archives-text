# Case of Mulford Sibley Still Open for Debate; Raises Question of Academic Freedom
## 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN Editorial Page Editor 
(Editor's Note: Professor Mulford Q. Sib
ley, one time member of the Stanford political
science department, is currently embroiled in
an academic freedom controversy at the Uni
versity of Minnesota. The debate there has
gone so far as to elicit statements from the
Lieutenant Governor of that state, ami a
lengthy statement on academic freedom from
the Minnesota Trustees which lias been inter
preted as supporting Sibley. Sibley 's departure
from Stanford was engulfed in another storm
of winds of academic freedom, the story of
which has come down to the current student
generation in the myth and fact of passing
conversation Tlds is the first of a series of
articles on Sibley and his career here.)

The case of Mulford Sibley, a political science
professor, pacifist, and socialist, denied appoint
ment to Stanford in 1958, is closed as far as the
University is concerned, a statement of President
J. E. Wallace Sterling made on May 9, 1958, reads.
And, yet, the case of the non-appointment, of
Mulford Sibley remains open as long as students
and academicians have the desire and make the
effort to inquire into the existence of academic
freedom and the provisions made by the univer
sity administration to give students the opportun
ity to learn from the best teachers, not merely
from the best researchers, the men who bring
prestige to the university and spend their free
time writing books instead of expressing political
opinions.
Although the question of who shall teach in
our universities is far from limited to Stanford,
it has special significance for all such universities
singlemindedly hacking their way up the cliff to
ward that edge of greatness. And Mulford Sibley,
a Quaker pacifist, a socialist, is a controversial
man, a man who forces the question of who shall
teach to the forefront. Even now Sibley is in
trouble at the University of Minnesota, not so
much for holding his controversial views, but for
expressing them. And, again, at Minnesota, as at
Stanford in 1958, it is the students who are the
defenders of Sibley.
AT THE UNIVERSITY of Minnesota today, at
Stanford in the 1958 Sibley case, in Mississippi—
it is the student who acts as agitator, the student
who is the intruder, the one who will not wait for
the slow and not necessarily inevitable processes
of reform to take place. Perhaps, inherently, con
cern when voiced by those outside the regular
channels of power means activism and imprudence.
When it is the student who is active, the effect on
the university administration is mild irritation;
in the case of the professor, the irritation can be
come an extremely distressing sore point. Yet, in
a non-authoritarian society, decisions must remain
open to question; the agitator cannot be silenced.
Thus, for the concerned student, the case of Mul
ford Sibley remains open.
The consideration of Dr. Sibley, at the time a
visiting professor at Stanford, for permanent ap
pointment began in the customary manner: the
recommendation stemming from joint action of the
political science department and the dean of the
school was placed with the President's Office for
approval, where it remained for about two months.
Daily accounts of the nomination and professors
interviewed by this reporter (who asked that their
names not be used) say the Sibley nomination was
unanimous; a statement issued by Dr. Sterling
says the recommendation was not "unanimous or
without reservation."
During the time that Sibley's case was under
consideration, about 300 students signed a petition
urging the appointment of Dr. Sibley. The peti
tion was not officially given to the president for
fear it might be detrimental to Sibley while his
appointment was still under consideration. How
ever, the president was aware of strong student
support for Sibley. A professor, again asking that
his name not be used, commented to this reporter
that no one had considered the possibility of a
permanent appointment for Sibley until he turned
out to be "such a fabulous teacher."
THE SIBLEY NOMINATION reached a dead
end when Provost Frederick E. Terman, former
dean of engineering, after receiving the original
recommendation and another from a faculty com
mittee assigned in a routine process, vetoed the
nomination of Sibley and recommended to Presi
dent Sterling that Sibley not be hired, a recom
mendation with which Sterling concurred. A fac
ulty member who asked that his name not be used
stated that action by the provost is considered in
the name of the president.
The nomination of Mulford Sibley was dead
as dead can be at this point. According to univer
sity regulations, the Advisory Board, a committee
elected from the faculty, "may, by a vote of five
of its members appeal to the trustees any differ
ences between the president and itself," but it is
no small thing for the faculty committee to begin

an open dispute with the provost and president
of the University. And the president is under no
legal obligation to provide the Advisory Board
with confidential information and details necessary
for the formation of intelligent opinion.
A dead end for Mulford at Stanford, but a be
ginning for students, a beginning of open ques
tioning, of asking, who shall teach at the univer
sity and who shall decide and on what basis?
STUDENTS IMMEDIATELY began circulating
a petition demanding that Sterling announce the
reason for non-appointment of Sibley. William
Broder, a graduate student in English, writing in
the Daily, charged that Sibley, an alternate dele
gate to the Socialist Party's national executive
committe and member of the pacifist Fellowship
of Reconciliation, "was dismissed because of his
active and outspoken political life," something
"not in keeping with the traditions of Stanford or
its present character."
Typical of Sibley's activities were those in the
month prior to the refusal of his nomination when,
at a Palo Alto rally, he assailed U.S. 11-bomb tests
in the Pacific as "a violation of international law."
Later he signed a petition pledging to share any
punishment inflicted on the four protesters aboard
the ketch "Golden Rule," halted by the government
as it sailed into the Pacific bomb test area.
STERLING DENIED any connection between
Sibley's political views and his non-appointment.
"If Mr. Sibley's political views were a factor they
would have been considered when he was invited
here. The division of political views among Stan
ford's present faculty and the university record
in defending freedom of inquiry confirm the fact
that political beliefs are not an issue in this case,"
the President stated.
Sibley himself was not: certain whether his
political activities were the cause of his non-ap
pointment. He said he had heard unofficially that
he was refused because his research was some
how not up to par.
Sibley is the author of throe volumes on politi
cal science; co-author of a volume of selected read
ings for students in the social sciences, and was
awarded the American Political Science Associa
tion prize for the "best contribution to Govern
ment and human welfare" in 1953 for his treatise,
"Conscription of Conscience." Since his Stanford
experience, he has edited a volume on pacifism,
"The Quiet Battle."
STUDENT REACTION to the Sibley case re
mained high. The legislature voted to seek recon
sideration of Dr. Sibley's case, also asking for an
official explanation of the university's reasons for
not hiring Sibley.
In response to student protest, Dr. Sterling met
with five student leaders on the matter, but did
not release the contents of this meeting. Soon
after the meeting Dr. Sterling issued his state
ment saying that the Sibley case was closed.
Dr. Sterling declared that Stanford "has the
highest respect" for Dr. Sibley and that he has
done "extremely well" as visiting professor.
Soon after the Sibley case Professor James T.
Watkins IV was discharged from his post as head
of the Political Science Department. Robert E.
Freelen, a former student body president, charged
that Watkins was removed "because he vigorously
expressed to the administration the department's
unanimous conviction that Mr. Sibley was the
best man for the available position." The Univer
sity made no response to the charge.
THE REFUSAL of the university to give any
concrete reason for Sibley's non-appointment
leaves the administration open to such charges
as political bias. Because of the secrecy involved,
this charge can be made without proof but simply
by inducing political bias from the administration's
secrecy in the light of Sibley's acknowledged ex
cellence as a teacher, and awards for scholarly
writing. When asked if he thought political bias
was involved in the university's decision, Sibley's
response could only be, "This is the sort of thing
you just don't know about."
The secrecy involved in the Sibley decision
leaves several disturbing questions open—Can a
man who not only holds controversial views, but
openly expreses them, receive a permanent ap
pointment at Stanford? Does the final decision
for appointments lie in the hands of a single man?
How much voice do faculty members have in the
choice of new appointees? Is student opinion
simply to be disregarded on the basis of a belief
that a student is really no judge of the quality
of his professor's teaching?
THESE ARE QUESTIONS that will be decided
on the basis of the individual's personal preju
dices so long as the university refuses to make
its basis of decision public. Such a situation en
ables the student, who is not known for his ap
proval of administration policies, to make what is
possibly an unfair judgment in respect to the rea
sons for appointment or dismissal of a professor.
However, this state of affairs has relevance only
so long as the university has respect for the opin
ions of its students and considers them worth
listening to, an attitude which is not prominant
in the university today.
