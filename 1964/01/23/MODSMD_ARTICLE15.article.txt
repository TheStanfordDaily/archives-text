# Sibley Defends Academic Rights
## 
### DAVID BARNUM Contributing Editor 
Stanford has no corner on con
troversies over freedom of acad
emic expression. They crop up
from time to time on campuses
all across the country. In a recent
and unusually ferocious one at
the University of Minnesota, poli
tical science professor Mulford
Q. Sibley matched wits and in
vective with St. Paul city commis
sioner Milton Rosen. It was ob
vious to the student audience of
1,500 that Sibley's forte was wits
w hi 1 e Rosen's was invective.
Sibley received a standing ova
tion at the end of his presentation.
Professor Sibley is a contro
versial man in himself. He is an
admitted pacifist and socialist and
outspoken champion of free acad
emic expression. Rosen would like
to see him fired for these sundry
heresies.
PARTICULARLY objectionable
to Rosen was a letter which Sibley
wrote to the Minnesota Daily, in
which he said in the interest of
academic freedom he would like
to see professors, individuals or
clubs advocating communism, nu

dism, free love, and atheism.
Rosen, convinced that "social
ism is a password for all these
pinks," took the list of causes
included in Sibley's letter to be in
dicative of its author's political
and moral inclinations. In their
debate, Sibley clarified his posi
tion. Far from advocating the
views raised in his letter, he said,
he was merely citing them as ex
amples. The Christian faith and
celibacy should likewise have
their audible advocates, he said.
Provided he is academically
competent and not propa
gandize in the classroom, Sibley
said, no professor should be fired.
Rosen countered that any college
student is too impressionable to
be exposed, even academically, to
such things as communism.
Their debate touched on a final
important issue, relevant alike to
Minnesota and Stanford: Whether
a university is more independent
if it is private or tax-supported.
The former is answerable to its
alumni, the latter to the legisla
ture from which its funds eman
ate.
Rosen inferred in the debate
that a tax-supported institution
should assume the preponderant
views of the taxpayers and there
fore cannot permit its faculty
much leeway of expression. Sibley
answered simply that he found
such a proposition "astounding."
