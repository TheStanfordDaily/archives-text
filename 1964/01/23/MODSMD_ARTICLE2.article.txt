### STEPHEN JACOBS 
"Liberalism and Socialism: the Solution to America's Socio-Eeo
nomic Crisis" was debated by Dr. Lorie Tarshis, Stanford Economics
Professor, and Bogden Denitch. spokesman for the Socialist Party
U.S.A.. last night at Tresidder Memorial Union. Both Tarshis. a
Stanford professor since 1942, and Denitch. an active trade unionist,

felt that the present state of the"
American economy is appalling.
Tarshis defined his ideal for lib
eral capitalism as a system in
which "most production is carried
out by private concerns but they
must be influenced by govern
ment policy in one way or an-1
other."
Tarshis stated that all econo
mics faced three problems, unem- i
ployment, unequal income distri
bution, and control of the compo
sition of the output of the econ
omy. He felt that a liberal capital
ist society could, but does not in
the United States, face and con
quer all three problems. "Il
liberal" capitalism has never ex
isted and probably cannot exist."
Tarshis cited England and the
Scandinavian countries as exam
ples of liberal capitalist econo
mies that are in a fairly good
state.
Denitch showed immediate sur
prise at Tarshis' choice of the
Scandinavian countries, countries
which he knew to be under social
ist domination. "Socialism," he
asserted, "has nothing to do with
the encroachment of bureau
cracy." The socialist view on eco
nomics is that democracy must
control the economy.
Denitch showed a plan for the
government to eliminate political
power in the hands of a few and
have a government take over the
i m portant companies in the
United States.
