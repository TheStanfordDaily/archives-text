## Winter Games Stalled; Torch Doesn't Burn 
### 
INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -
They'll have In lurn tho gas down
under Ihe Olympic I lame.
Tho flame was tested at an
Olympic rehearsal Tuesday, and
it shot up big black clouds of
smoke and enough fire to melt
what little snow there is in Inns
bruck.
Then llioy are going to have
to sharpen up the timing of the
opening ceremony. Otherwise, the
Olympics will be over before they
get started.
The first ragged rehearsal for
the opening of the Games on Jan.
29 was held Tuesday in tho ski
jumping stadium. It was late
long and cold.
Some 1,300 high school stu
dents pitched in to help, imitat
ing the athletes and marching
behind the flags of the 3.1 nations
entered in the Winter Olympics.
While officials fiddled with
microphones and seating charts,
the students were strung out in
a long line through the pine trees,
shivering and arguing about
which country they were going
to represent.
A few wanted to march for Ihe
United States, or the "000-Ess-
Ah," as it is pronounced. None
seemed to want to be Russians.
Most wanted to march for Aus
tria, which seemed reasonable.
Eventually, a man blew a bugle,
and a lot of soldiers strolled into
position. Then the official hos
tesses, cute Aust r i a n lasses
dressed in red capes, black ski
pants, white boots and white
fuzzy hats took their positions
around the stadium.
They stamped their little feet
to stay warm. It was so cold their

baby blue eyes watered, and it
| was all a follow could do lo keep
J from rushing over to comfort
; ihem.
By this lime the students were
I chanting: "Lugger, help. Lugger,
â€¢ help."
Alois Lugger is the burgomeie
ster of Innsbruck, but he might
not be when the students gel old
enough to vote.
Eventually all were in place.
I There were cannon shots, and
then the Olympic torch was car
j ried in, unlit.
That was a mistake, so the
young lady carrying it had to go
back and start over. A cigarette
lighter was located, and the torch
set afire.
It was carried to the lop of the
I stadium, and the Olympic flame
was lit. "Whoosh," went the
i flame and a gread cloud of smoke
1 shot up.
The students, who were getting
restless, hid their eyes from the
holocaust and made rule remarks.
Then they straggled out, and
(the Olympics went back to the
i planning board.
