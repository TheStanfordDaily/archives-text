and classroom and laboratory
facilities. The emphasis, however,
will be on their effect on the un
j dergraduate educational program,
Page said.
Asked about possible future
i student participation on the Coin
| mittee. Page replied that although
"we haven't crossed that bridge
yet. the Committee will eventually
involve itself in so many fields
that advice will be sought in
many quarters."

A new seven-man faculty Com-
I mittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion has been appointed by the
Executive Committee of the Acad
emic Council to study all phases
of the undergraduate educational
i program and to advise Professor
| Robert J. Wert, University vice
provost and newly-named Dean
of Undergraduate Education.
THE ACTION was taken to
meet a long existing need for "a
faculty arm" to deal with under
graduate education, said Profes
sor Benjamin M. Page, Chairman
of the Executive Committee. For
many years the faculty has been
concerned with this area, Page
continued, but there has been no
faculty organ comparable to the 1
Committee on the Graduate Divi
sion, only an annually appointed
Presidential Committee.
According to Page, the new
committee will be concerned with
instruction and curriculum in
volving departmental, interdepart
mental, or special programs for
undergraduate majors, including
honors programs.
Till; COMMITTEE will also
deal with admissions, housing,
health, religious life, student ac
tivities and organizations, dis
cipline and conduct, athletics (in
cluding intra-murals), d e p art
mental advising, the undergrad
uate library and library facilities,
and classroom and laboratory
facilities. The emphasis, however,
will be on their effect on the un
j dergraduate educational program,
Page said.
Asked about possible future
i student participation on the Coin
| mittee. Page replied that although
"we haven't crossed that bridge
yet. the Committee will eventually
involve itself in so many fields
that advice will be sought in
many quarters."
THE MEMBERS of the com
mittee will include: Prof. Robert
A. Walker, director of General
Studies and director of Overseas
Campuses; Prof. Eric Hutchinson
of the Chemistry Department;
