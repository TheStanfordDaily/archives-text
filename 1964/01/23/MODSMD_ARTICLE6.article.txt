# Ecumenical Council Urges Involvement

### MARLI SCHENCK CAROLYN EGAN 
"The Church as an institutional
body has no strength, no function
and no meaningful existence in
itself. . . . Our Christian existence
begins outside the Church build
ing," emphasized Rev. Milan Opo
chensky from the University of
Prague, Czechoslovakia in a Dec.
30th address to the 19th Ecumeni
cal Conference in At hen, Ohio,
attended by a delegation of 22
Stanford students.
At the same conference on Dec.
29. Vincent Harding, head of the
NAACP in Georgia said about
the Civil Rights Movement: "The
question is not shall we partici
pate. The fact is God is participat
ing. The question is where do we
act? How do we begin?
BOTH >li;N stressed the need
for the Church to become vitally
concerned with current political
and social problems. The Church
must stimulate its members to
become active participants in the
tight against injustice.
Opochensky sees the Czechosol
vakian socialist revolution of 194S
J as the natural outcome of history.
He pointed out that, in his coun
try. liberal governments and at
tempts at democracy had failed
to meet the social, political and
economic needs of the people, and
that the Church itself had made
many blunders.
Opochensky points out, how
ever, in Czechoslovakia today, hu
man problems remain unsolved
and only the Church can attack
! the sources of tension ever pres
ent. "The main problem of the
Christian in my country is to
make his presence felt in his
whole life. ... in areas where the
j State has proved inadequate. We
I must witness, we must engage
I ourselves, and confront our Marx
list friends and partners with the
j realities which an 1 going beyond
their usual categories and pre
i conceived ideas."
• IF VOI T \\ ISII to overcome the
Marxist atheists, you must under
stand his strengths, as well as his
| weaknesses," he continued.
Harding, speaking about the
j Civil Rights Movement, similarly
j felt a "Christian imperative for
our involvement in this revolu
'tiou." lie added: "the inadequacy

and inability of the Church to re
spond has revealed how little the
Church answers the problems of
our times.
How can we stand back an d
say, "You must become worthy
before I can help you . . . you
must become middle class, you
must become like me, you must
become white." Even where the
Churches have announced they
are open to all, no one is taking
his brother by the hand to invite
him inside- "the Church is be
coming the last bastion of "our
kind of society!" We can no long
er have any barriers. We must
all be prepared to love radically
and to lose all. But now we a re
unwilling to lose ourselves for the
oppressed."
THROUGH Till: Freedom Move
ment something is being said
about the 1 inadequacy of our politi
cal structure, he commented.
When the Justice Dept. refuses
to intervene to U.S. citizens in
Mississippi and Alabama because
"you wouldn't want a national
police force, would you?" Harding
pointed to the innate hypocrisy of
political channels. "I believe any
administration which commits
itself to the Civil Mrights struggle
must be willing to be defeated,"
he said.
An attitude of uncertainty has
been engendered by the whole
method of maneuvering around
the Civil Rights Bill in Congress.
If we can do nothing about such
injustices with things as they
are, "then things as they are, are
wrong," Harding said.
He questions: "Is our system
really self-adjusting? Has private
property become more important
than human right? Isn't some
thing wrong when maintaining
political power has become more
important than doing right?
