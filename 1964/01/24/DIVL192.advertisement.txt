HEAVENLY BODIES
The Russian Cosmonauts boasted that they did not liucl Cod or Heaven
up in the skv. Some say that 111i>. is only because they did not go hiirh
enough. But Christians know that Clod will never be found by searching
the cosmos in a space ship; tor Cod is Spirit, and I lis truth fruHsci'tiilx
the physical realm ol existence. God can be known personally by any
individual right here on Karth, through faith in the finished work of
|csiis Christ and by Coil's Holy Spirit.
When a Christian dies, his soul goes immediately to be with Christ in
Heaven. At the first resurrection of the dead, Christians ol all ages will
be resurrected and given new, incorruptible, and glorified bodies.

but .i naked grain, perhaps ol wheat, or of some other kind; and God
clothes it with the body of his choice, each seed with its own particular
body. All flesh is not the same flesh: there is llesh of men, llesh ol beasts,
of birds, and of fishes—all different. There are heavenly bodies and
earthly bodies; anil the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one thing, the.
splendor of the earthly another. The sun has a splendor of its own, the
moon another splendor, and the stars another, for star differs from star
in brightness. So it is with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown
in the earth as a perishable thing is raised imperishable. Sown in humilia
tion, it is raised in glory; sown in weakness it is raised in power; sown as
in animal hodv, it is raised as a spiritual body. It is in this sense that
Scripture says, 'the first man, Adam, became an inanimate being,' where
as the last Adam has become a life-growing spirit. Observe the spiritual
does not come first; the animal body comes first, and then the spiritual.
The first man w.is made of the dust of the earth : Ihe second man is
from heaven. The man made of dust is the pattern of all men ol dust,
and the heavenly man is the pattern of all the heavenly. As we have
worn the likeness of the man of dust, so we shall wear the likeness of
the heavenly man. W hat I mean, my brothers, is this: flesh and blood
can never possess the kingdom of God. and the perishable cannot possess
immortality. Listen! I will unfold a mystery: we shall not all die. but
we sh.ill all be changed in a Hash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trumpet-call. I or the trumpet will sound, and the dead will rise im
mortal, and we shall be changed. This perishable being must be clothed
with the imperishable, and what is mortal must be clothed with im
mortality; then the saying of Scripture will come true: 'Death is swal
lowed up; victory is won! O Death, where is your victor)'? O Death,
where is your sting?' The sting of death is sin, and sin gains its power
from the law: but God be praised, he gives us the victory through our
Lord |csus Christ. 1 Cor. 15 >5-.>7. \K.
II iven does not automatically follow earthly life. The resurrection de
scribed above does not include the unrighteous dead who have rejected
Christ, including those who have ncv t" made a definite commitment to
Him. If you are. not a Christian, you have the opportunity of becoming
one today. I hose who walk w it.h lesus know with certainty that all of His
promises, as recorded in the Bible, will be fulfilled.

HEAVENLY BODIES
The Russian Cosmonauts boasted that they did not liucl Cod or Heaven
up in the skv. Some say that 111i>. is only because they did not go hiirh
enough. But Christians know that Clod will never be found by searching
the cosmos in a space ship; tor Cod is Spirit, and I lis truth fruHsci'tiilx
the physical realm ol existence. God can be known personally by any
individual right here on Karth, through faith in the finished work of
|csiis Christ and by Coil's Holy Spirit.
When a Christian dies, his soul goes immediately to be with Christ in
Heaven. At the first resurrection of the dead, Christians ol all ages will
be resurrected and given new, incorruptible, and glorified bodies.

but .i naked grain, perhaps ol wheat, or of some other kind; and God
clothes it with the body of his choice, each seed with its own particular
body. All flesh is not the same flesh: there is llesh of men, llesh ol beasts,
of birds, and of fishes—all different. There are heavenly bodies and
earthly bodies; anil the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one thing, the.
splendor of the earthly another. The sun has a splendor of its own, the
moon another splendor, and the stars another, for star differs from star
in brightness. So it is with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown
in the earth as a perishable thing is raised imperishable. Sown in humilia
tion, it is raised in glory; sown in weakness it is raised in power; sown as
in animal hodv, it is raised as a spiritual body. It is in this sense that
Scripture says, 'the first man, Adam, became an inanimate being,' where
as the last Adam has become a life-growing spirit. Observe the spiritual
does not come first; the animal body comes first, and then the spiritual.
The first man w.is made of the dust of the earth : Ihe second man is
from heaven. The man made of dust is the pattern of all men ol dust,
and the heavenly man is the pattern of all the heavenly. As we have
worn the likeness of the man of dust, so we shall wear the likeness of
the heavenly man. W hat I mean, my brothers, is this: flesh and blood
can never possess the kingdom of God. and the perishable cannot possess
immortality. Listen! I will unfold a mystery: we shall not all die. but
we sh.ill all be changed in a Hash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trumpet-call. I or the trumpet will sound, and the dead will rise im
mortal, and we shall be changed. This perishable being must be clothed
with the imperishable, and what is mortal must be clothed with im
mortality; then the saying of Scripture will come true: 'Death is swal
lowed up; victory is won! O Death, where is your victor)'? O Death,
where is your sting?' The sting of death is sin, and sin gains its power
from the law: but God be praised, he gives us the victory through our
Lord |csus Christ. 1 Cor. 15 >5-.>7. \K.
II iven does not automatically follow earthly life. The resurrection de
scribed above does not include the unrighteous dead who have rejected
Christ, including those who have ncv t" made a definite commitment to
Him. If you are. not a Christian, you have the opportunity of becoming
one today. I hose who walk w it.h lesus know with certainty that all of His
promises, as recorded in the Bible, will be fulfilled.

HEAVENLY BODIES
The Russian Cosmonauts boasted that they did not liucl Cod or Heaven
up in the skv. Some say that 111i>. is only because they did not go hiirh
enough. But Christians know that Clod will never be found by searching
the cosmos in a space ship; tor Cod is Spirit, and I lis truth fruHsci'tiilx
the physical realm ol existence. God can be known personally by any
individual right here on Karth, through faith in the finished work of
|csiis Christ and by Coil's Holy Spirit.
When a Christian dies, his soul goes immediately to be with Christ in
Heaven. At the first resurrection of the dead, Christians ol all ages will
be resurrected and given new, incorruptible, and glorified bodies.

A senseless question! The seed which you sow does not come to life
unless it first has died; and what von sow is not the both that shall 1 ><■.
but .i naked grain, perhaps ol wheat, or of some other kind; and God
clothes it with the body of his choice, each seed with its own particular
body. All flesh is not the same flesh: there is llesh of men, llesh ol beasts,
of birds, and of fishes—all different. There are heavenly bodies and
earthly bodies; anil the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one thing, the.
splendor of the earthly another. The sun has a splendor of its own, the
moon another splendor, and the stars another, for star differs from star
in brightness. So it is with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown
in the earth as a perishable thing is raised imperishable. Sown in humilia
tion, it is raised in glory; sown in weakness it is raised in power; sown as
in animal hodv, it is raised as a spiritual body. It is in this sense that
Scripture says, 'the first man, Adam, became an inanimate being,' where
as the last Adam has become a life-growing spirit. Observe the spiritual
does not come first; the animal body comes first, and then the spiritual.
The first man w.is made of the dust of the earth : Ihe second man is
from heaven. The man made of dust is the pattern of all men ol dust,
and the heavenly man is the pattern of all the heavenly. As we have
worn the likeness of the man of dust, so we shall wear the likeness of
the heavenly man. W hat I mean, my brothers, is this: flesh and blood
can never possess the kingdom of God. and the perishable cannot possess
immortality. Listen! I will unfold a mystery: we shall not all die. but
we sh.ill all be changed in a Hash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trumpet-call. I or the trumpet will sound, and the dead will rise im
mortal, and we shall be changed. This perishable being must be clothed
with the imperishable, and what is mortal must be clothed with im
mortality; then the saying of Scripture will come true: 'Death is swal
lowed up; victory is won! O Death, where is your victor)'? O Death,
where is your sting?' The sting of death is sin, and sin gains its power
from the law: but God be praised, he gives us the victory through our
Lord |csus Christ. 1 Cor. 15 >5-.>7. \K.
II iven does not automatically follow earthly life. The resurrection de
scribed above does not include the unrighteous dead who have rejected
Christ, including those who have ncv t" made a definite commitment to
Him. If you are. not a Christian, you have the opportunity of becoming
one today. I hose who walk w it.h lesus know with certainty that all of His
promises, as recorded in the Bible, will be fulfilled.
