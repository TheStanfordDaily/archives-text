# Precedents Exist for Sectarian Services on Campus
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Twelfth in a Series 
Historical precedents exist both for holding sectarian
worship on campus and for re-interpretations of the Found
ing Grant.
These opinions were expressed by Cassius L. Kirk, Uni
versity Staff Counsel for Business Affairs, in an interview
with the Daily this week.
The presumed University policy, given the present re
strictions on sectarian worship, is that it cannot act to
change the policy on religion because of the Founding
Grant, which states that "the University must forever be
maintained upon a strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian
basis."
HOWEVER, there is evidence that before Memorial
Church was built there were sectarian services held on the
Stanford campus, and the present services in Memorial
Church may be considered "sectarian," Kirk stated.

"lf these sectarian services were held with the knowl
edge of Mrs. Stanford, this would be persuasive evidence
that Mrs. Stanford did not, through the Founding Grant,
intend to prohibit sectarian worship on campus. Presum
ably, the services had her approval because Memorial
Church was built in 1903 and she did not die until 1905."
"The fact that earlier administrations have permitted
sectarian services is at least evidence that they did not
consider such services in conflict with the prohibitions of
the Founding Grant."
Agreeing with the statements of Dr. Robert MacAfee
Brown and others that the services in Memorial Church arc
Protestant sectarian, Kirk feels that "the intent of Mrs.
Stanford, as expressed in the Founding Grant, might be
better served by permitting other sects to conduct worship
services on the campus."
A LEGAL PRECEDENT that the Founding Grant can
be re-evaluated is the 1954 court case in which the Univer

sity petitioned Santa Clara County to modify the Founding
Grant, allowing the number of Trustees to increase from
sixteen to twenty-three. The court upheld the petition, and
"authorized modification of the Trust |the Founding
Grant ]."
"There is leeway for expanding a trust," explained
Kirk, "unless the wording is very explicit. The wording of
the Founding Grant would appear to leave some leeway
with regard to religion on campus."
If the Board were satisfied that the Founding Grant
does not prohibit sectarian services on campus, could Uni
versity facilities, such as an interfaith chapel, be used for
denominational worship? "If they were made available on
a non-discriminatory basis, the facilities could probably be
used for that. It appears that Mrs. Stanford was concerned
with preventing a formal alliance with any group."
THE BUILDING of an inter-faith chapel "would be just
like the building of a library or any other University build

in«, once the Trustees felt they had satisfied the Founding
Grant."
While Mrs. Stanford made specific provisions that the
services in Memorial Church be Protestant, there is no
provision in the Founding Grant that the University chap
lain be Protestant. Further, "if it is done on a non-dis
criminatory basis," Kirk believes, "there could be assistant
chaplains from specific denominations." Non-discrimina
tion would mean not favoring or opposing any particular
group.
For denominational services to be held on campus, the
Board of Trustees would have to change its present policy
on religion. "If they were satisfied that the Founding
Grant does not prohibit or prevent them from authorizing
the holding of sectarian services, they could adopt an ap
propriate policy, authorizing President Sterling to arrange
with the various faiths for the conducting of religious
services on the campus."

lain be Protestant. Further, "if it is done on a non-dis
criminatory basis," Kirk believes, "there could be assistant
chaplains from specific denominations." Non-discrimina
tion would mean not favoring or opposing any particular
group.
For denominational services to be held on campus, the
Board of Trustees would have to change its present policy
on religion. "If they were satisfied that the Founding
Grant does not prohibit or prevent them from authorizing
the holding of sectarian services, they could adopt an ap
propriate policy, authorizing President Sterling to arrange
with the various faiths for the conducting of religious
services on the campus."
Historical precedents exist both for holding sectarian
worship on campus and for re-interpretations of the Found
ing Grant.
These opinions were expressed by Cassius L. Kirk, Uni
versity Staff Counsel for Business Affairs, in an interview
with the Daily this week.
The presumed University policy, given the present re
strictions on sectarian worship, is that it cannot act to
change the policy on religion because of the Founding
Grant, which states that "the University must forever be
maintained upon a strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian
basis."
HOWEVER, there is evidence that before Memorial
Church was built there were sectarian services held on the
Stanford campus, and the present services in Memorial
Church may be considered "sectarian," Kirk stated.

"lf these sectarian services were held with the knowl
edge of Mrs. Stanford, this would be persuasive evidence
that Mrs. Stanford did not, through the Founding Grant,
intend to prohibit sectarian worship on campus. Presum
ably, the services had her approval because Memorial
Church was built in 1903 and she did not die until 1905."
"The fact that earlier administrations have permitted
sectarian services is at least evidence that they did not
consider such services in conflict with the prohibitions of
the Founding Grant."
Agreeing with the statements of Dr. Robert MacAfee
Brown and others that the services in Memorial Church arc
Protestant sectarian, Kirk feels that "the intent of Mrs.
Stanford, as expressed in the Founding Grant, might be
better served by permitting other sects to conduct worship
services on the campus."
A LEGAL PRECEDENT that the Founding Grant can
be re-evaluated is the 1954 court case in which the Univer

sity petitioned Santa Clara County to modify the Founding
Grant, allowing the number of Trustees to increase from
sixteen to twenty-three. The court upheld the petition, and
"authorized modification of the Trust |the Founding
Grant ]."
"There is leeway for expanding a trust," explained
Kirk, "unless the wording is very explicit. The wording of
the Founding Grant would appear to leave some leeway
with regard to religion on campus."
If the Board were satisfied that the Founding Grant
does not prohibit sectarian services on campus, could Uni
versity facilities, such as an interfaith chapel, be used for
denominational worship? "If they were made available on
a non-discriminatory basis, the facilities could probably be
used for that. It appears that Mrs. Stanford was concerned
with preventing a formal alliance with any group."
THE BUILDING of an inter-faith chapel "would be just
like the building of a library or any other University build

in«, once the Trustees felt they had satisfied the Founding
Grant."
While Mrs. Stanford made specific provisions that the
services in Memorial Church be Protestant, there is no
provision in the Founding Grant that the University chap
lain be Protestant. Further, "if it is done on a non-dis
criminatory basis," Kirk believes, "there could be assistant
chaplains from specific denominations." Non-discrimina
