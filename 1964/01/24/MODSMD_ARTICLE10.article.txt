KZSU last night. The remain

It is a common error for those
i of us in student government to
I assume that there is only one
valid viewpoint in the university,
or to assume that student govern
ment is knowledgeable enough to
run the university. This assump
tion, of course, neither I nor those
in student government at Stan
ford hold. Bui there is an equally
common error among many stu
dent governments that is even
more dangerous. This is the as
sumption that student govern
ment. has no real voice in the uni
versity, that it is granted exist
ence and must therefore not pre
sume to argue o" differ with its
creator, and that its only role is
that of a "civic training ground."
UNDERLYING this altitude
are several revealing assump
tions. First there is the assump
tion that the student is throwing
j decorum to the winds if lie acts in
J protest, criticism or suggestion of
jsome question. Second, such a
j view seems to imply that stu
dents are incapable of making
I lasting and fundamental contri
butions to the university. If this
| is not the case, then the assump
| tion must be that student govern
i merit does not have the power to
influence or to change.
To this view also do neither 1
I nor those in student government
■ at Stanford adhere. What then is
;the view we hold of student gov
ernment and what have been the
! manifestations of that view this
| year? And underlying this view
is the fact that student govern
ment. particularly in the last
i three years, has made substantial
contributions to life at Stanford,
i and I see no reason to expect it
not to continue to do so.
I WANT TO SPEAK today of
| the progress made in student gov-
I ernment at Stanford this year. In
doing so. 1 would first like to
make a few remarks about the
I Stanford community. The Stan
ford community is indeed a re
| markablc society. It is the home
of one of the nation's most learn
learned and capable faculties, of
jsome of the most intelligent and
talented students in America, and
of an administration that has
j brought Stanford great strides
along the pathway to greatness.
Within this community each of
| these parties has a responsibility
to the total community, to each
of the other parties, and to itself.
1 A great deal has and will be said
i about the responsibilities and ob
ligations of the first two parties.
I3ul all too often, 100 little is said
about the student as a member of
this community. To this role and
particularly to the role of student
j government iti the Stanford com
munity I would like In speak.

sue II A DISCUSSION might
prove to be misleading if I failed
at the outset to clarify a common
place myth about student "rights"
in the university. Simply stated,
we have very few. On September
19, 1963, the Board of Trustees
dispelled any contrary notions,
emphatically pointing out that
"Attendance al the University is
a privilege, not a right," and went
on to specify that any student
may be removed "who fails to
abide by University regulation,
or whose social conduct, personal
habits or moral character are
deemed detrimental by the Uni
versity.''
Aside from a rather noticeable
flexibility, the statement places
the student in a tenuous position
in the university. Since he has no
"rights" of permanent member
ship. he cannot use this basis for
the claims that students and stu
dent government arc wont to
make.
WHAT DOES, however, serve
as this basis are the obligations
and responsibilities inherent in
the concept of the student.
Among them is the obligation t<>
learn, and learning is a process
which cannot go on without a
spirit of critical inquiry, without
a desire to question the assump
tions that lie at the base of
knowledge, without the freedom
to speak, to write, and to argue,
and without the freedom to de
velop and tost personal ethics,
codes, and ideas. There is often
added to this a certain obligation
| to seek out ways of improving
and contributing to the univer
sity.
I Both of these obligations must
also be present in student govern
ment, if it is to play its full part
in the university community. But
