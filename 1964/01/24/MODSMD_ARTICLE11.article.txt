# Sibley Case Question: 'Publish or Perish,' A University Code?

### VIVIAN BOZMAN editorial page editor 
(Editor's note. This is the last in a series of two articles.)
Apart from the many questions on academic freedom that the
Sibley case raises and leaves unanswered within the realm of offi
cialdom, the case does seem to point to a cardinal principle in the
academic marketplace of large and intellectually and financially pros
perous universities: Publish or perish.
A professor stated simply, "No books—no appointment." And
Professor William McCord, who stated that his name could be used,
noted, "If a person were a brilliant teacher and never published any
thing, he wouldn't be promoted. . . . This is consistent with the
announced policy."
A faculty member and former administrator, who asked that his
name not be used, stated that a man is judged for appointment or
promotion on the basis of his intellectual acumen, and this is judged
through published works. Books come first, he said, because the
quality of a book is easily judged, whereas the quality of classroom
teaching is much more intangible. "Students may be starry-eyed, but
they may not be learning anything," he commented.
A professor stated that the dean's policy today on increases in
salary is oriented to provide the higher salary increases for those
professors who spend more time on research and less time with
students. Professors who are told to publish or not be promoted will
feel no loyalty to Stanford, as Stanford feels no loyalty to them, he
warned.
The same professor told the reporter that reforms within the
structure of appointments and promotions must begin with the fac
ulty, not with the students. He also warned that a sensaional article
in the Daily might make the problem worse for professors.
TRYING TO PROVIDE some justification for a "publish or per
ish" policy, a professor explained Stanford's preoccupation with
books by noting, "We haven't arrived yet; we're not secure; that's
why we're worried about these things."
Professor McCord noted the difficulty of evaluating the value
and effectiveness of one man's teaching. He called the Stanford
system "about as fair as you can get," but added, "it doesn't put any
premium on undergraduate teaching." Ho cited experiments at Co
lumbia University and the University of Chicago, both of which tried
having two faculties, one for the college with the emphasis on teach
ing, and one for the university with the main emphasis on research.
However, this program did not. work well, for members of the college
faculty were made to feel like second-class citizens.
THE DECISION FOR appointments seems to lie along a vague
line of outstanding scholarship and competent teaching with some
consideration for a man's outstanding teaching ability and competent
scholarship. When the judgment of the department conflicts with
the judgment of the dean, politics may very well be the deciding
point. Remarking on the possibilities of this being the case, a pro
lessor noted that the university administration would, of course,
deny the charge.
The promotion policy for the School of Humanities and Sciences
is clcarly stated in a mimeographed bulletin of June, 1963. "Faculty
rank should reflect not only ability but also academic experience,"
the statement reads. "Various honors and responsibiities which are
attached to the upper ranks assume long familiarity with University
problems and procedures. As between rank and salary, the former
therefore will tend to reflect seniority, the latter performance as a
teacher and scholar. The salaries of young faculty members who
make outstanding contributions to the University through their
teaching and research should reflect this achievement. Hence, it is
inevitable that the University will have some faculty at the lower
ranks earning substantially more than the minimum salaries at the
next higher level."
IT IS INTERESTING to speculate on how the university deter
mines teaching ability when considering salary increases for young
faculty members and to then propose that the same criteria could
be used to evalue the teaching capabilities of prospective appointees.
Professor Sanford Dornbusch, in a prepared statement of defense
for promotion and appointment policies at Stanford, noted, "I have
often disagreed with particular decisions concerning faculty appoint
ments and promotions. Sometimes, I have been furious. But, I am
convinced that Stanford has a fine system of evaluation, and that no
school does a better job."
Commenting on the charge that "publish or perish" is reducing
the quality of teaching at Stanford. Professor Dornbusch replied.
"Nonsense! When I ask students to name their favorite professors,
■they almost always name outstanding scholars. Right after graduate
school, it is easy to be a fine teacher. The young professor can vomit
back to his students the pap he so recently learned. But as the years
move on, the non-scholar teacher gets more out of touch with his
developing field, more bored, and less effective as a teacher. The
active researcher keeps his zest and his competence."
IT IS PERHAPS relevant to ask if the man who publishes is the
only one who does research. It is not impossible for a professor to
cointinue active research and interest in his subject and to convey
the knowledge directly to students, rather than through books. The
question then is, if the professor would prefer to lecture, hold semi
nars, and meet with students, does university pressure require him
to publish? This does not imply a condemnation of the researcher,
but only a condemnation of a policy which forces a man to publish,
not allowing him to make his own free choice.
Professor Dornbusch's statement also includes an answer to the
charge that the reasons for non-promotion are not publicly stated.
"Faculty not promoted would be even more unhappy if the Stan
ford Daily announced that they were found to be weak in scholar
ship. inept as teachers, or forward in homosexual advances to stu
dents. Faculty do not die when they leave Stanford, and they will
not be helped in their careers by such misplaced helpfulness," the
statement reads.
It is interesting to note that criticism against the non-appoint
ment of Sibley condemned the university for implying by its secrecy
lhat it rejected Sibley because of some dark secret in his past. It is
possible also that university announcement of the reason for an ap
pointment or non-appointment could prove embarrassing to the uni
versity. No one says that Stanford administrators are not men of
integrity, and Stanford administrators do not call Mulford Sibley
names. But secrecy, which has no real place in a democratic society,
invites speculation, often irresponsible, but not disproved.
Dornbusch also denied the charge lhat political activists are not
appointed or promoted and defended the idea of having administra
tors check faculty decisions, noting, "At Stanford, we have been for
iunate in having administrators who could say 'no' making possible
a. new level of aspiration for the University and creating a school 'on
•he make' intellectually."
COMMENTING ON TIIE "academic marketplace." he noted, "Ac
ademic freedom is enhanced by developing professors who can spit
in the Dean's eye, secure in the knowledge that they can go else
where at an equal salary."
It would be comforting indeed to be able to agree with Dr. Dorn
busch. But the student's view is a view from the outside, the view
of one who sees the university as primarily a place of intellectual
stimulation, with teachers who can convey inspiration and excite
ment in a subject, with teachers who are not afraid to say something
that might send Herbert Hoover scampering for the telephone. The
student lacks understanding of the pressures and intricacies in
volved in the administration of the university.
BUT THE STUDENT has no desire to see the university as sim
ply a place of dogmatic dictums: Publish or perish, think what you
like, but think it quietly. The picture of the methods of university
administration seems bleak and, oh so very practical, with idealism
relegated to the naive sludont.
One is thankful for the professors who voice their opinions. One
would like to hear the opinions of more professors, for there is an
ether shadowy fear which lurks, a fear expressed by C. Wright Mills
in an essay on "The Social Role of the Intellectual: "The deepest
problem of freedom for teachers is not the occasional ousting of a
professor," Mills writes, "but a vague general fear—sometimes po
litely known as 'discretion,' 'good taste,' or 'balanced judgment.' It
is a fear which leads to self-intimidation and finally becomes so ha
bitual that the scholar is unaware of it."
From the student's point of view, thank heaven for the indiscreet.

name not be used, stated that a man is judged for appointment or
promotion on the basis of his intellectual acumen, and this is judged
through published works. Books come first, he said, because the
quality of a book is easily judged, whereas the quality of classroom
teaching is much more intangible. "Students may be starry-eyed, but
they may not be learning anything," he commented.
A professor stated that the dean's policy today on increases in
salary is oriented to provide the higher salary increases for those
professors who spend more time on research and less time with
students. Professors who are told to publish or not be promoted will
feel no loyalty to Stanford, as Stanford feels no loyalty to them, he
warned.
The same professor told the reporter that reforms within the
structure of appointments and promotions must begin with the fac
ulty, not with the students. He also warned that a sensaional article
in the Daily might make the problem worse for professors.
TRYING TO PROVIDE some justification for a "publish or per
ish" policy, a professor explained Stanford's preoccupation with
books by noting, "We haven't arrived yet; we're not secure; that's
why we're worried about these things."
Professor McCord noted the difficulty of evaluating the value
and effectiveness of one man's teaching. He called the Stanford
system "about as fair as you can get," but added, "it doesn't put any
premium on undergraduate teaching." Ho cited experiments at Co
lumbia University and the University of Chicago, both of which tried
having two faculties, one for the college with the emphasis on teach
ing, and one for the university with the main emphasis on research.
However, this program did not. work well, for members of the college
faculty were made to feel like second-class citizens.
THE DECISION FOR appointments seems to lie along a vague
line of outstanding scholarship and competent teaching with some
consideration for a man's outstanding teaching ability and competent
scholarship. When the judgment of the department conflicts with
the judgment of the dean, politics may very well be the deciding
point. Remarking on the possibilities of this being the case, a pro
lessor noted that the university administration would, of course,
deny the charge.
The promotion policy for the School of Humanities and Sciences
is clcarly stated in a mimeographed bulletin of June, 1963. "Faculty
rank should reflect not only ability but also academic experience,"
the statement reads. "Various honors and responsibiities which are
attached to the upper ranks assume long familiarity with University
problems and procedures. As between rank and salary, the former
therefore will tend to reflect seniority, the latter performance as a
teacher and scholar. The salaries of young faculty members who
make outstanding contributions to the University through their
teaching and research should reflect this achievement. Hence, it is
inevitable that the University will have some faculty at the lower
ranks earning substantially more than the minimum salaries at the
next higher level."
IT IS INTERESTING to speculate on how the university deter
mines teaching ability when considering salary increases for young
faculty members and to then propose that the same criteria could
be used to evalue the teaching capabilities of prospective appointees.
Professor Sanford Dornbusch, in a prepared statement of defense
for promotion and appointment policies at Stanford, noted, "I have
often disagreed with particular decisions concerning faculty appoint
ments and promotions. Sometimes, I have been furious. But, I am
convinced that Stanford has a fine system of evaluation, and that no
school does a better job."
Commenting on the charge that "publish or perish" is reducing
the quality of teaching at Stanford. Professor Dornbusch replied.
"Nonsense! When I ask students to name their favorite professors,
■they almost always name outstanding scholars. Right after graduate
school, it is easy to be a fine teacher. The young professor can vomit
back to his students the pap he so recently learned. But as the years
move on, the non-scholar teacher gets more out of touch with his
developing field, more bored, and less effective as a teacher. The
active researcher keeps his zest and his competence."
IT IS PERHAPS relevant to ask if the man who publishes is the
only one who does research. It is not impossible for a professor to
cointinue active research and interest in his subject and to convey
the knowledge directly to students, rather than through books. The
question then is, if the professor would prefer to lecture, hold semi
nars, and meet with students, does university pressure require him
to publish? This does not imply a condemnation of the researcher,
but only a condemnation of a policy which forces a man to publish,
not allowing him to make his own free choice.
Professor Dornbusch's statement also includes an answer to the
charge that the reasons for non-promotion are not publicly stated.
"Faculty not promoted would be even more unhappy if the Stan
ford Daily announced that they were found to be weak in scholar
ship. inept as teachers, or forward in homosexual advances to stu
dents. Faculty do not die when they leave Stanford, and they will
not be helped in their careers by such misplaced helpfulness," the
statement reads.
It is interesting to note that criticism against the non-appoint
ment of Sibley condemned the university for implying by its secrecy
lhat it rejected Sibley because of some dark secret in his past. It is
possible also that university announcement of the reason for an ap
pointment or non-appointment could prove embarrassing to the uni
versity. No one says that Stanford administrators are not men of
integrity, and Stanford administrators do not call Mulford Sibley
names. But secrecy, which has no real place in a democratic society,
invites speculation, often irresponsible, but not disproved.
Dornbusch also denied the charge lhat political activists are not
appointed or promoted and defended the idea of having administra
tors check faculty decisions, noting, "At Stanford, we have been for
iunate in having administrators who could say 'no' making possible
a. new level of aspiration for the University and creating a school 'on
•he make' intellectually."
COMMENTING ON TIIE "academic marketplace." he noted, "Ac
ademic freedom is enhanced by developing professors who can spit
in the Dean's eye, secure in the knowledge that they can go else
where at an equal salary."
It would be comforting indeed to be able to agree with Dr. Dorn
busch. But the student's view is a view from the outside, the view
of one who sees the university as primarily a place of intellectual
stimulation, with teachers who can convey inspiration and excite
ment in a subject, with teachers who are not afraid to say something
that might send Herbert Hoover scampering for the telephone. The
student lacks understanding of the pressures and intricacies in
volved in the administration of the university.
BUT THE STUDENT has no desire to see the university as sim
ply a place of dogmatic dictums: Publish or perish, think what you
like, but think it quietly. The picture of the methods of university
administration seems bleak and, oh so very practical, with idealism
relegated to the naive sludont.
One is thankful for the professors who voice their opinions. One
would like to hear the opinions of more professors, for there is an
ether shadowy fear which lurks, a fear expressed by C. Wright Mills
in an essay on "The Social Role of the Intellectual: "The deepest
problem of freedom for teachers is not the occasional ousting of a
professor," Mills writes, "but a vague general fear—sometimes po
litely known as 'discretion,' 'good taste,' or 'balanced judgment.' It
is a fear which leads to self-intimidation and finally becomes so ha
bitual that the scholar is unaware of it."
From the student's point of view, thank heaven for the indiscreet.

Apart from the many questions on academic freedom that the
Sibley case raises and leaves unanswered within the realm of offi
cialdom, the case does seem to point to a cardinal principle in the
academic marketplace of large and intellectually and financially pros
perous universities: Publish or perish.

in the Daily might make the problem worse for professors.
TRYING TO PROVIDE some justification for a "publish or per
ish" policy, a professor explained Stanford's preoccupation with
books by noting, "We haven't arrived yet; we're not secure; that's
why we're worried about these things."
Professor McCord noted the difficulty of evaluating the value
and effectiveness of one man's teaching. He called the Stanford
system "about as fair as you can get," but added, "it doesn't put any
premium on undergraduate teaching." Ho cited experiments at Co
lumbia University and the University of Chicago, both of which tried
having two faculties, one for the college with the emphasis on teach
ing, and one for the university with the main emphasis on research.
However, this program did not. work well, for members of the college
faculty were made to feel like second-class citizens.
THE DECISION FOR appointments seems to lie along a vague
line of outstanding scholarship and competent teaching with some
consideration for a man's outstanding teaching ability and competent
scholarship. When the judgment of the department conflicts with
the judgment of the dean, politics may very well be the deciding
point. Remarking on the possibilities of this being the case, a pro
lessor noted that the university administration would, of course,
deny the charge.
The promotion policy for the School of Humanities and Sciences
is clcarly stated in a mimeographed bulletin of June, 1963. "Faculty
rank should reflect not only ability but also academic experience,"
the statement reads. "Various honors and responsibiities which are
attached to the upper ranks assume long familiarity with University
problems and procedures. As between rank and salary, the former
therefore will tend to reflect seniority, the latter performance as a
teacher and scholar. The salaries of young faculty members who
make outstanding contributions to the University through their
teaching and research should reflect this achievement. Hence, it is
inevitable that the University will have some faculty at the lower
ranks earning substantially more than the minimum salaries at the
next higher level."
IT IS INTERESTING to speculate on how the university deter
mines teaching ability when considering salary increases for young
faculty members and to then propose that the same criteria could
be used to evalue the teaching capabilities of prospective appointees.
Professor Sanford Dornbusch, in a prepared statement of defense
for promotion and appointment policies at Stanford, noted, "I have
often disagreed with particular decisions concerning faculty appoint
ments and promotions. Sometimes, I have been furious. But, I am
convinced that Stanford has a fine system of evaluation, and that no
school does a better job."
Commenting on the charge that "publish or perish" is reducing
the quality of teaching at Stanford. Professor Dornbusch replied.
"Nonsense! When I ask students to name their favorite professors,
■they almost always name outstanding scholars. Right after graduate
school, it is easy to be a fine teacher. The young professor can vomit
back to his students the pap he so recently learned. But as the years
move on, the non-scholar teacher gets more out of touch with his
developing field, more bored, and less effective as a teacher. The
active researcher keeps his zest and his competence."
IT IS PERHAPS relevant to ask if the man who publishes is the
only one who does research. It is not impossible for a professor to
cointinue active research and interest in his subject and to convey
the knowledge directly to students, rather than through books. The
question then is, if the professor would prefer to lecture, hold semi
nars, and meet with students, does university pressure require him
to publish? This does not imply a condemnation of the researcher,
but only a condemnation of a policy which forces a man to publish,
not allowing him to make his own free choice.
Professor Dornbusch's statement also includes an answer to the
charge that the reasons for non-promotion are not publicly stated.
"Faculty not promoted would be even more unhappy if the Stan
ford Daily announced that they were found to be weak in scholar
ship. inept as teachers, or forward in homosexual advances to stu
dents. Faculty do not die when they leave Stanford, and they will
not be helped in their careers by such misplaced helpfulness," the
statement reads.
It is interesting to note that criticism against the non-appoint
ment of Sibley condemned the university for implying by its secrecy
lhat it rejected Sibley because of some dark secret in his past. It is
possible also that university announcement of the reason for an ap
pointment or non-appointment could prove embarrassing to the uni
versity. No one says that Stanford administrators are not men of
integrity, and Stanford administrators do not call Mulford Sibley
names. But secrecy, which has no real place in a democratic society,
invites speculation, often irresponsible, but not disproved.
Dornbusch also denied the charge lhat political activists are not
appointed or promoted and defended the idea of having administra
tors check faculty decisions, noting, "At Stanford, we have been for
iunate in having administrators who could say 'no' making possible
a. new level of aspiration for the University and creating a school 'on
•he make' intellectually."
COMMENTING ON TIIE "academic marketplace." he noted, "Ac
ademic freedom is enhanced by developing professors who can spit
in the Dean's eye, secure in the knowledge that they can go else
where at an equal salary."
It would be comforting indeed to be able to agree with Dr. Dorn
busch. But the student's view is a view from the outside, the view
of one who sees the university as primarily a place of intellectual
stimulation, with teachers who can convey inspiration and excite
ment in a subject, with teachers who are not afraid to say something
that might send Herbert Hoover scampering for the telephone. The
student lacks understanding of the pressures and intricacies in
volved in the administration of the university.
BUT THE STUDENT has no desire to see the university as sim
ply a place of dogmatic dictums: Publish or perish, think what you
like, but think it quietly. The picture of the methods of university
administration seems bleak and, oh so very practical, with idealism
relegated to the naive sludont.
One is thankful for the professors who voice their opinions. One
would like to hear the opinions of more professors, for there is an
ether shadowy fear which lurks, a fear expressed by C. Wright Mills
in an essay on "The Social Role of the Intellectual: "The deepest
problem of freedom for teachers is not the occasional ousting of a
professor," Mills writes, "but a vague general fear—sometimes po
litely known as 'discretion,' 'good taste,' or 'balanced judgment.' It
is a fear which leads to self-intimidation and finally becomes so ha
bitual that the scholar is unaware of it."
From the student's point of view, thank heaven for the indiscreet.

Apart from the many questions on academic freedom that the
Sibley case raises and leaves unanswered within the realm of offi
cialdom, the case does seem to point to a cardinal principle in the
academic marketplace of large and intellectually and financially pros
perous universities: Publish or perish.
A professor stated simply, "No books—no appointment." And
Professor William McCord, who stated that his name could be used,
noted, "If a person were a brilliant teacher and never published any
thing, he wouldn't be promoted. . . . This is consistent with the
announced policy."
A faculty member and former administrator, who asked that his
name not be used, stated that a man is judged for appointment or
promotion on the basis of his intellectual acumen, and this is judged
through published works. Books come first, he said, because the
quality of a book is easily judged, whereas the quality of classroom
teaching is much more intangible. "Students may be starry-eyed, but
they may not be learning anything," he commented.
A professor stated that the dean's policy today on increases in
salary is oriented to provide the higher salary increases for those
professors who spend more time on research and less time with
students. Professors who are told to publish or not be promoted will
feel no loyalty to Stanford, as Stanford feels no loyalty to them, he
warned.

ing, and one for the university with the main emphasis on research.
However, this program did not. work well, for members of the college
faculty were made to feel like second-class citizens.
THE DECISION FOR appointments seems to lie along a vague
line of outstanding scholarship and competent teaching with some
consideration for a man's outstanding teaching ability and competent
scholarship. When the judgment of the department conflicts with
the judgment of the dean, politics may very well be the deciding
point. Remarking on the possibilities of this being the case, a pro
lessor noted that the university administration would, of course,
deny the charge.
The promotion policy for the School of Humanities and Sciences
is clcarly stated in a mimeographed bulletin of June, 1963. "Faculty
rank should reflect not only ability but also academic experience,"
the statement reads. "Various honors and responsibiities which are
attached to the upper ranks assume long familiarity with University
problems and procedures. As between rank and salary, the former
therefore will tend to reflect seniority, the latter performance as a
teacher and scholar. The salaries of young faculty members who
make outstanding contributions to the University through their
teaching and research should reflect this achievement. Hence, it is
inevitable that the University will have some faculty at the lower
ranks earning substantially more than the minimum salaries at the
next higher level."
IT IS INTERESTING to speculate on how the university deter
mines teaching ability when considering salary increases for young
faculty members and to then propose that the same criteria could
be used to evalue the teaching capabilities of prospective appointees.
Professor Sanford Dornbusch, in a prepared statement of defense
for promotion and appointment policies at Stanford, noted, "I have
often disagreed with particular decisions concerning faculty appoint
ments and promotions. Sometimes, I have been furious. But, I am
convinced that Stanford has a fine system of evaluation, and that no
school does a better job."
Commenting on the charge that "publish or perish" is reducing
the quality of teaching at Stanford. Professor Dornbusch replied.
"Nonsense! When I ask students to name their favorite professors,
■they almost always name outstanding scholars. Right after graduate
school, it is easy to be a fine teacher. The young professor can vomit
back to his students the pap he so recently learned. But as the years
move on, the non-scholar teacher gets more out of touch with his
developing field, more bored, and less effective as a teacher. The
active researcher keeps his zest and his competence."
IT IS PERHAPS relevant to ask if the man who publishes is the
only one who does research. It is not impossible for a professor to
cointinue active research and interest in his subject and to convey
the knowledge directly to students, rather than through books. The
question then is, if the professor would prefer to lecture, hold semi
nars, and meet with students, does university pressure require him
to publish? This does not imply a condemnation of the researcher,
but only a condemnation of a policy which forces a man to publish,
not allowing him to make his own free choice.
Professor Dornbusch's statement also includes an answer to the
charge that the reasons for non-promotion are not publicly stated.
"Faculty not promoted would be even more unhappy if the Stan
ford Daily announced that they were found to be weak in scholar
ship. inept as teachers, or forward in homosexual advances to stu
dents. Faculty do not die when they leave Stanford, and they will
not be helped in their careers by such misplaced helpfulness," the
statement reads.
It is interesting to note that criticism against the non-appoint
ment of Sibley condemned the university for implying by its secrecy
lhat it rejected Sibley because of some dark secret in his past. It is
possible also that university announcement of the reason for an ap
pointment or non-appointment could prove embarrassing to the uni
versity. No one says that Stanford administrators are not men of
integrity, and Stanford administrators do not call Mulford Sibley
names. But secrecy, which has no real place in a democratic society,
invites speculation, often irresponsible, but not disproved.
Dornbusch also denied the charge lhat political activists are not
appointed or promoted and defended the idea of having administra
tors check faculty decisions, noting, "At Stanford, we have been for
iunate in having administrators who could say 'no' making possible
a. new level of aspiration for the University and creating a school 'on
•he make' intellectually."
COMMENTING ON TIIE "academic marketplace." he noted, "Ac
ademic freedom is enhanced by developing professors who can spit
in the Dean's eye, secure in the knowledge that they can go else
where at an equal salary."
It would be comforting indeed to be able to agree with Dr. Dorn
busch. But the student's view is a view from the outside, the view
of one who sees the university as primarily a place of intellectual
stimulation, with teachers who can convey inspiration and excite
ment in a subject, with teachers who are not afraid to say something
that might send Herbert Hoover scampering for the telephone. The
student lacks understanding of the pressures and intricacies in
volved in the administration of the university.
BUT THE STUDENT has no desire to see the university as sim
ply a place of dogmatic dictums: Publish or perish, think what you
like, but think it quietly. The picture of the methods of university
administration seems bleak and, oh so very practical, with idealism
relegated to the naive sludont.
One is thankful for the professors who voice their opinions. One
would like to hear the opinions of more professors, for there is an
ether shadowy fear which lurks, a fear expressed by C. Wright Mills
in an essay on "The Social Role of the Intellectual: "The deepest
problem of freedom for teachers is not the occasional ousting of a
professor," Mills writes, "but a vague general fear—sometimes po
litely known as 'discretion,' 'good taste,' or 'balanced judgment.' It
is a fear which leads to self-intimidation and finally becomes so ha
bitual that the scholar is unaware of it."
From the student's point of view, thank heaven for the indiscreet.

Apart from the many questions on academic freedom that the
Sibley case raises and leaves unanswered within the realm of offi
cialdom, the case does seem to point to a cardinal principle in the
academic marketplace of large and intellectually and financially pros
perous universities: Publish or perish.
A professor stated simply, "No books—no appointment." And
Professor William McCord, who stated that his name could be used,
noted, "If a person were a brilliant teacher and never published any
thing, he wouldn't be promoted. . . . This is consistent with the
announced policy."
A faculty member and former administrator, who asked that his
name not be used, stated that a man is judged for appointment or
promotion on the basis of his intellectual acumen, and this is judged
through published works. Books come first, he said, because the
quality of a book is easily judged, whereas the quality of classroom
teaching is much more intangible. "Students may be starry-eyed, but
they may not be learning anything," he commented.
A professor stated that the dean's policy today on increases in
salary is oriented to provide the higher salary increases for those
professors who spend more time on research and less time with
students. Professors who are told to publish or not be promoted will
feel no loyalty to Stanford, as Stanford feels no loyalty to them, he
warned.
The same professor told the reporter that reforms within the
structure of appointments and promotions must begin with the fac
ulty, not with the students. He also warned that a sensaional article
in the Daily might make the problem worse for professors.
TRYING TO PROVIDE some justification for a "publish or per
ish" policy, a professor explained Stanford's preoccupation with
books by noting, "We haven't arrived yet; we're not secure; that's
why we're worried about these things."
Professor McCord noted the difficulty of evaluating the value
and effectiveness of one man's teaching. He called the Stanford
system "about as fair as you can get," but added, "it doesn't put any
premium on undergraduate teaching." Ho cited experiments at Co
lumbia University and the University of Chicago, both of which tried
having two faculties, one for the college with the emphasis on teach
ing, and one for the university with the main emphasis on research.
