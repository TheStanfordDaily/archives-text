### VIVIAN BOZMAN 
The academic freedom contro
versy at the University of Min
nesota began on Nov. 21, when,
after Professor Mulford Sibley
spoke at an Anoka county library
lecture series in Spring Lake
Park, a member of the audience
complained about Sibley's "leftist
leanings" to the Anoka County
Board of Commissioners, the Min
nesota Daily reported,
Milton Rosen, St. Paul public
works commissioner, .joined the
argument and since then has be
come one of the leaders of the at
tack on both Sibley and the idea
of complete academic freedom.
THE MOST IMMEDIATE dis
agreement with Rosen, who has
demanded that the Regents fire
Sibley, came from Lieutenant-
Governor A. M. Keith, who ar
gued that academic freedm can
not be limited.
On Dec. 2 the Anoka Board of
Commissioners ordered an inves
tigation of Sibley and Arnold
Rose, Minnesota representative
and sociology professor, who also
spoke in the lecture series.
The Regents, after a three-hour
closed executive session eDc. 14,
released a statement on academic
freedom which was widely inter
preted to be in support of Sibley,
although it does not specifically
mention him.
GOVERNOR KARL ROLVAAG
praised the Regents' statement,
calling it an "original, thoughtful
and coherent statement on the
absolute necessity for academic
freedom in our educational sys
tem."
Rosen called the report of the
Regents "a disgrace to all the
God-fearing people of our state."
Other supporters of Sibley's

and/or tho Regents' positions in
clude the Minneapolis and St.
Paul newspapers, the Rochester
Post - Bulletin, Charles H. Mc-
Laughlin, head of the University's
Political Scionce Department, the
Minnesota chapter of the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union, and
Minnesota Representative Rod
ney Searle, chairman of the Uni
versity Committee of the House.
THE REGENTS' STATEMENT
reads, in part, "A university must
cherish freedom or be untrue to
its own nature. Equally it cher
ishes responsibility, the natural
corollary of freedom. In this con
nection the Regents endorse the
following statement adopted by
the Association of American Uni
versities in 1953 and reprinted in
1962: 'Historically the word uni
versity is a guarantee of stand
ards. It implies endorsement not
of its members' views, but of
their capability and integrity. Ev
ery scholar has an obligation to
maintain this reputation. . . . He
bears a heavy responsibility to
weigh the validity of his opinions
and the manner in which they are
expressed.'"
The statement further empha
sizes that the student and profes
sor "must live in an atmosphere
where questioning is encouraged,
where every alternative can be
explored, where their free minds
may be allowed to test the valid
ity of cach idea, and where they
may feel free to follow wherever
truth may lead. . . . The most
American activity of them all is
to think, to speak, and to inquire
freely. The un-American activity
is to deny such freedom."
The statement closes by reaf
firming the faith of the Regents
in the University and in the effi
ciency of freedom.
