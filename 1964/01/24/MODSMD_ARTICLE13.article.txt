Editor:
Walter Lippmann has appar
ently calmed his abiding fear of
what would happen if Senator
Goldwater won the presidency by
deciding that the Senator isn't
really trying to win that office.
But in Goldwater's supposed goal
to capture control of the Repub
lican Party Lippmann still man
ages to find cause for alarm suf
ficient to warrant a flight from
reason and reality in yet another
column.
Despite the fact that recent
polls have shown that Goldwater
is the overwhelming favorite of
Republican leaders across the
country, for example, Lippmann
can nonchalantly drop in the re
mark that the Goldwater "fac
tion" is a minority within a mi
nority party. To continue on to
say that Goldwater, who until
now has been campaigning for all
Republican candidates as chair
man of the Republican Senatorial
Campaign Committee, has sud
denly turned on his fellows,
called his rivals for the nomina
tion Democrats, and is attempt
ing to purge the leadership of
the Republican Party, is patently
ridiculous.
Lippmann probably reaches his
high point when he says that
Goldwater would turn his party
into that of white supremacists
and unregulated and uncontrolled
businessmen. This demonstrates
a total ignorance of the Senator's
views and record of active sup
port of integration, and legitimate
governmental control of com
merce. Despite this apparent ig
norance, Lippmann can come to
the conclusion that Goldwater
isn't actually a conservative at
all. But Lippmann has long pre
viously abdicated the realm of
reason.
Apparently not yet sure that

his perceptive logic has convinced
everyone (which it hasn't), Lipp
mann tosses in a few adjectives
designed at least to give comfort
to those who agree with him, if
not to convince anyone else. Gold
water, he says, made a "sneering"
remark about General Eisen
hower; Goldwater is a "radical
reactionary"; Goldwater demon
strates the "crude and primitive
capitalism" of "the newly rich on
the make."
This seems to be typical of the
increasing number of attacks on
the Senator from Arizona, which
decline to discuss the substantive
issues, but readily engage in vi
tuperative personal attacks. And
more, I predict, can be expected.
I ask if this is the best Lipp
mann can do. Is this the column
ist Professor Heinz Eulau refer
red to as "a great newspaperman
and a brilliant political essayist?"
I say he is strictly a busher. I
also say it's lime we heard more
from the other side.

STERLING
Editor, The Daily:
It has come lo our attention
that there may be certain aspects
of the University Administration
which have not been entirely rc
vealed to the University Commu
nity; specifically; that President
Sterling is a robot. We wish to
make it clear that we do not urfe
the term "robot" in any meta
phorical sense; rather, we are re
ferring to the scientific evidence
that he is literally an actual elec
tronic mechanism; specifically,
an 1.8.M. 191. If this is true, it is
a sad day for Stanford.
