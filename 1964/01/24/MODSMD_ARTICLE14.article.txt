Stanford s wandering basket
ball loam lakes to ihp air again j
this weekend for its longest trip
of the season. The Tribe will play
three games in four flays- two
over the weekend in Corvallis
against t lie Beavers of Oregon 1
State University and one more on
Monday night in Salt Lake City
! against Jack Gardner's Utah Red
skins.
Stanford's Tom Dose, si ill
i handicapped by Ihe knee he I
bruised in Dallas against South-1
ern Methodist over the holidays,!
! w ill need every one of his six feet j
eight inches to cope with the i
seven feet of hone and muscle 1
that is Mel Counts.
SHOOTING FROM the outside
more than from in close last sea
son. Counts managed io average
20 points per game. Slats Gill
! moved him inside this year, and
Mho versatile big man is liilting
at a lorrid 27 ppg pace, lie has
i also stepped up his rebounding
average from 12 to 17 as a result
i of the change.
The rest of the Heaven lineup,;
; fortunately for Stanford, is not
quite as imposing on or off the
court as big Mel.
Only one possible starter is
i more than 6-3, and even at (5-7.

no oiip fears 1 lie shooting eye
of Jim Kraus loo much. More of
a problem will he I ho speedy little
trio that (Jill can field along with
these two in the fieldhouso that
hears his name.
Till; TWO (il AliDS, Jim Jar-
Vis and Rick Whelan are both ex
cellent ballhandlers and dribblers.
This makes ii almost impossible
to press against the Beavers.
Frank Peters, a t! 2 man listed as
both a guard and a forward is
a dead shot from outside, bill is
ai a distinct disadvantage when
hiiting the hack hoards with the 1
hi cj boys.

Oregon Stnto has had rather an
up and down season thus far. The
Beavers startled former national
champ Cincinnati on the downhill
track by splitting: with Ihem in a
series at Corvallis and have heat
on Indiana twice. Their only
losses include the one to Cincin
nati. a split at Berkeley and a
loss last weekend to the Univor-1
sity of Oregon in ;t traditional
grudge match.
The Utah squad thai Howie
Dallmar's hoys face Monday is
one of a growing lists that has |
hen ton Ed .Picker's Cincinnati
Bearcats. The ITtos have lost but
twice, lo Utah Stale and last :
weekend to the University of
