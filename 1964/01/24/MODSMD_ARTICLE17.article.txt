The Peninsula Ramblers will :
furnish Stanford's rugby team '
with their second opponent tomor-!
row afternoon at. 1:30 and will
prov ide some of the toughest, com-1
petition of the season.
Two starters who missed last

ner and leader has recovered from
a charley horse and Clark Weaver
has returned from an unexepeeted
absence.
The Ramblers last week de
feated the University's Club,
perennially the strongest team in
Southern California, 9-0. Stanford
lost to the University's Club last j
year in its only defeat.
Peninsula player's to watch in
clude Allie Lopez, a good penalty
kicker; Jess Bayliss, an experi
enced Englishman; and Jerry
Collet to, the team's best runner. |
Bayliss will play opposite Stan- j
ford's Waddell in a new English I

Due to the week's monsoons,
Stanford has only managed to j
work out once in the outdoors!
and the players have been run
ning on their own.
No injuries were incurred in !
last week's game, so the Tribe i
will be at almost full strength,
and this will be the top rugby
game of the season in the coun
try. so try to see it.
