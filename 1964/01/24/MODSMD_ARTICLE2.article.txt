## 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN Editorial Page Editor 
Bruce Gordon, SNCC field secretary, will speak today at -4:15 p.m.
in Room 282. Tresidder, on student involvement in the civil rights
movement.
Gordon joined the civil rights movement about a year ago. This
summer he spent two months in jail in Savannah, Georgia. He was

♦■arrested for his part in a massive
voter registration drive. His bond
was sot at §13,000, and it was for
this reason that he stayed in jail
for two months.
THE UNIQUE ASPECT of
! Gordon's stay in jail was that,
while a prisoner, he organized the
'other demonstrators who were
j also jailed. They held daily ex
ercises, Bible study, mathematics,
j reading and writing classes. Sev
| eral of the young demonstrators,
I who were illiterate when they
i were imprisoned, left jail with
I some knowledge of the funda
j mentals of reading and writing,
j "You don't stop struggling just
| because you're in jail," Gordon
I commented.
Often referred to as one of
I SNCC's troubleshooters because
i he travels to any area in need of
j additional assistance, Gordon was
; sent to Selma. Alabama, later in
1 the summer because of a crisis
I there. Ho was instructed to set
up a SNCC office in the town,
| because most of the local staff
was in jail and a new supply of
workers was needed. He suc
-1 ceeded in his task, installing a
SNCC office across the street
J from the city jail.
GORDON ALSO ASSISTED in
j Mississippi's Freedom Vote, the
Imo e k election sponsored by
COFO (Council of Federated Or
' gani/at ions, in c 1 u ding SNCC,
! CORE, SCLC and NAACP). in
! which several Stanford students
I participated.
Gordon will probably wear his
' field work "uniform" when he
| speaks today. The uniform con
sists of blue jeans, blue work
shirt and a jean jacket. SNCC
: workers usually adopt this dress
, because the people with whom
: they work dress this way, and
it makes communication easier.
It O K N I N II A II Ii E M , New

| street gang while a teen-ager. He
I spent three years in the army as
!a paratrooper, and spent a year

Bruce Gordon, SNCC field secretary, will speak today at -4:15 p.m.
in Room 282. Tresidder, on student involvement in the civil rights
movement.
Gordon joined the civil rights movement about a year ago. This
summer he spent two months in jail in Savannah, Georgia. He was

♦■arrested for his part in a massive
voter registration drive. His bond
was sot at §13,000, and it was for
this reason that he stayed in jail
for two months.
THE UNIQUE ASPECT of
! Gordon's stay in jail was that,
while a prisoner, he organized the
'other demonstrators who were
j also jailed. They held daily ex
ercises, Bible study, mathematics,
j reading and writing classes. Sev
| eral of the young demonstrators,
I who were illiterate when they
i were imprisoned, left jail with
I some knowledge of the funda
j mentals of reading and writing,
j "You don't stop struggling just
| because you're in jail," Gordon
I commented.
Often referred to as one of
I SNCC's troubleshooters because
i he travels to any area in need of
j additional assistance, Gordon was
; sent to Selma. Alabama, later in
1 the summer because of a crisis
I there. Ho was instructed to set
up a SNCC office in the town,
| because most of the local staff
was in jail and a new supply of
workers was needed. He suc
-1 ceeded in his task, installing a
SNCC office across the street
J from the city jail.
GORDON ALSO ASSISTED in
j Mississippi's Freedom Vote, the
Imo e k election sponsored by
COFO (Council of Federated Or
' gani/at ions, in c 1 u ding SNCC,
! CORE, SCLC and NAACP). in
! which several Stanford students
I participated.
Gordon will probably wear his
' field work "uniform" when he
| speaks today. The uniform con
sists of blue jeans, blue work
shirt and a jean jacket. SNCC
: workers usually adopt this dress
, because the people with whom
: they work dress this way, and
it makes communication easier.
