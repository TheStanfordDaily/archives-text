# SF Opera Group Presents 'Mikado'
## 
### 
The Mikado, one of Gilbert and
Sullivan's most popular produc
tions, will be performed by the
Lamplighters at 2:30 Sunday
afternoon in Memorial Audito
rium. The Lamplighters, a San
Francisco Opera Company, have
earned critical praise for their
past productions.
A characteristically Victorian
satire. The Mikado puts standard
romance into a Japanese setting,
and exploits the inevitable frus
trations as an occasion for veiled
satire.
Proceeds from this perform
ance will benefit the scholarship
fund of Stanford's Institute of In
ternational Relations. Tickets are
$2.50, $2.00, $1.50, and $1.00, and
may be purchased at the Tresid
der Box Office.
