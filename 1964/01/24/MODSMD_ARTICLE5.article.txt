# Jean Cocteau's Play Is 'Much too Slow'
## 
### POSTER HIRSCH 
Drama Editor
Jean Cocleau's "Testament of
Orpheus," presented by the Film
Forum two weeks ago, betrayed
an almost total ignorance of cin
ema. It was, to get it over with,
a stagnant, egocentric bore in
which people who resembled ro
bots spouted overblown, esoteric
diet urns.
IN Ills PLAY, "Eagle with Two
Heads," which the Stanford Play
ers have unfortunately selected to
perform. Cocteau reveals almost
as vigorous an ignorance of the
theater. Again, his people are
mere mechanisms, his dialogue is
only slightly less pretentious, and
the situation is considerably more
tedious.
The story (which in embryo has
some genuine possibilities) con
cerns the rejuvenation of a queen
who has retreated from the world
since the assassination of the
king. An anarchist poet who re
sembles her lamented husband is
the force who hriiifTS her to life

again only to be the instrument
of her death.
WITH THIS as his skeletal out
line. Cocteau liberally introduce
a number of grandiose thoughts
on revolution, royally, politics,
courage and love. He is unsuc
cessful in integrating his diverse
themes into a cohesive whole.
That the queen willfully engi
neers her own death at the end
makes nonsense of this sugges
tion. Yet it is not clear why she
wants death rather than life; it
may be that she cannot live with
out her dead king or perhaps,
given her anarchical leanings, she
cannot face a life of restrictive
political ceremony.
IN Sl >l, then, Cocleau's mes
sage, if Indeed there is one. is ob
scured. To be sure, the situation
itself is not without dramatic in
terest. but what appeal there may
be suoeates under the excesses ol
a long, grim, repetitive script.
Further. Cocteau is uncertain
as to the genre in which he is
work in" Hi- st\|e progresses

from hints of surrealistic avant
garde in the beginning to neo neo
classical to sentimental romance
to grand opera at the end.
IT IS 15Y NOW clear that the
playwright himself is overwhelm
ingly responsible for the show's
failure. In choosing their own
poison, however, the Stanford
Players do not escape entirely un
scathed. Graduate student Cary
Clasz has directed in slow motion
and with a singularly heavy hand
At any rate, the blocking is con
sistently stiff and the actors talk
over, rather than energize each
other.
Susan Leieh, although she is
not old enough, plays the queen
with assurance and conviction,
aided by her lovely voice and
commanding presence.
lIER TECHNIQUE is skillful,
and hopefully in the future she
will be able to use il on more de
serving material.
Sean Cunningham as the poet
has (lie most difficult role; he
must listen in silence to peeche*

of inordinate length delivered by
the queen and at I lie same time
maintain a semblance of his char
acter. He, in fact, does reason
ably well until he is called upon
to speak, al which some foolish
lines and mechanical movements
get the best of him.
BRIM 10 SAI/V ATORK, who has
done well in the past, fails utterly
as Felix, a lord-in-waiting. His
voice smacks of artificiality and
the mincing gait which he uses is
ineffectual.
Margaret Lamont as the queen's
reader is jarring; she doesn't ap
pear to listen to a word she is
saying, and her one dramatic de
vice. which she uses in each of
her entrances and exits, is to look
snobbish.
I,KK PROJECTOR tares little
better with his perfectly flat chief
of police. He, too, suffers from an
affectedly theatrical voice. Terry
Asia's deaf-mute is weakened be
cause his gestures, like almost ev
erything in the play, are much
too slow.
