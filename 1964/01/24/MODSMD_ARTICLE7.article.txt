# Brandeis Prof Ends Series; Looks at Modern Philosophies
## 
### 
By MALCOLM MacKENZIK
The world is about to undergo
a great rebirth of spirituality and
a movement away from personal
desire for power.
This surprising idea was ad
vanced by Dr. Frank A. Manuel,
professor of history at Brandeis
University, as the single principle
which unifies all twentieth cen
tury historical philosophies, when
he spoke yesterday afternoon on
"An Uneasy Consensus: The
Twentieth Century." The talk
concluded a series of seven lec
tures.
According to Manuel, this con
cept of reawakening spirituality
is common to all modern histori
cal philosophies; although a great
number of profound differences
do exist among them.
The modern Christian thinkers
generally feel that the goal and
purpose of history lies beyond
human understanding, and that a
commitment to continual upward
progression is but "a new idola
try."
Very much within the progres
sive camp are two modern

i schools, one of which is most
often associated with the Roman
Catholic priest, Father Teillard
jdu Chardin. Father Teii lard's
view says that physical evolution
being complete, a moral evolution
is under way which will gradu
ally bring about a spiritual up
lifting of the human race. More
reasonable, though loss attractive,
is Marxism. However, according
to Dr. Manuel, any new Marxist
ideas are unlikely because of a
general overcommitment to the
outdated "Das Kapital."
On the other side, the twentieth
j century has brought a rebirth of
interest in cyclical thought, due
! mainly to Oswald Speng 1 e r ,
j whose regimented system refused
to admit to any connections at all
between cultures. Even the well
known cyclist, Arnold Toynbee.
lonly watered down and refined
| Spengler's uncompromising dog
! mas. says Dr. Manuel.
In this stream of philosophical
i ideas, which one. if any, is right?
Dr. Manuel is not sure. As he
put it,"I come to bear witness to
the tide. not to swell it."
