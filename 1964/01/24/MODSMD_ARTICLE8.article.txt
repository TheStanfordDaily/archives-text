## ASSU President Bud Wedin Describes Role of Student Government at Stanford 
### STEVE LEOPOLD 
ASSU President Bud Wedin
I gave a "stale of the student body"
address last night on KZSU in
! which he discussed Stanford's
; eternal triangle students, stu
government, and the Administra
tion and pledged that "we will
I continue to make our contribu
' tions to the Stanford community."
Wedin noted that many con
sider student government lo be
only a "civic training ground."
And in the words of the Trustees'
recent edict, "Attendance at the
University is a privilege, not a
right." Thus the student is in a
rather tenous position regarding
his rights and must find his ra
] tionale for effective student gov-
I ernment elsewhere.
j To Wedin, the basis for any
I student government includes the
two factors inherent in the con
j cept of the student himselfâ€”the
obligation to learn and to view
all things "with a spirit of critical
inquiry," and the obligation to
seek out ways of improving and
i contributing to the University. In
return the student government
has a responsibility "to provide
for the needs and desires of the
student body."
STANFORD'S student govern
ment meets this responsibility in
two ways, Wedin declared. First,
j the government acts as a "canopy
I under which fall a great number
! of student activities." In this ca
, pacity, ASSU has established a
j new Travel Service, a Foreign
! Student Housing Commission, and

plans to establish an Investment
League "to distribute some $."5000
to students who are interested in
gaining the experience of invest
ment in stocks and bonds."
THE SECOND role, however, is
"more profound and more com
plex." It includes involvement in
policy decisions, curriculum, eva
luation, teacher promotion, admis
sions policies, and social regula
tions, among others. In many of
these areas, Wedin asserted, the

student government has begun to
act. In the area of religion, a com
mittee of the Legislature is com
piling a study of religion at Stan
ford.
In another field, which Wedin
described as "social conscious
ness," the government is backing
two projects. One is the establish
ment of a Kennedy Memorial
Fund; the second, and more con
troversial project is in the civil
rights field.
