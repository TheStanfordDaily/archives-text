# Vatican Council Analyzed at 'Ecumenical Banquet'
## 
### 
The successes and the failures ol the Vatican Council
and the image and the reality of the Catholic Church were
analyzed at an "Ecumenical Banquet" here Saturday night
by three who attended the Council.
Stanford professor and Protestant Robert McAfee
Brown, Roman Catholic Fr. Daniel O'Hanlon and Russian
Orthodox Fr. Alex Schmcmann offered their contrasting
views to a crowd of several hundred at the Old Union
Dining Room.
O'Hanlon stated that Pope John announced he would
call a Council five years ago "in (he interest of the unity
of all Christians," as well as for "reformation and renewal
within the Catholic Church." Me viewed the invitation of
delegate observers from other churches as somewhat of a
self-fulfilling prophesy: "a symbol of the Council's pur
pose of Christian unity and a very effective means of bring
ing this unity about."
The greatest accomplishment of the Council, the Catho
lic priest felt, was "letting in some fresh air . . . opening

of windows within the Church and to the outside." The
Council demonstrated "that the Catholic Church is not a
monarchical church. Even apart from anything decided,
the coming ol Catholics from all over to take part in the
decision-making was significant."
O'Hanlon labelled as the most significant decisions of
the Council those that stressed the participation of the
laity and those that are leading to the defining of col
legiality, i.e., the influence of the Bishops in reference to
the Pope and Church policy.
An inequitable distribution of power was the greatest
problem at the Council, stated the priest. "There was no
place to raise a point of order; the chairmen had great
influence on what was said. There was not a fair repre
sentation of the sentiment of the Bishops as a whole on
influential committees, and things were not brought up
that most wanted discussed."
Orthodox Alexander Schmeman felt that the greatest
"tragedy" of the Vatican Council was that "one felt yet
the pressure of the theological structure ... no room 10
move within it." As a representative of the Eastern

Church, Schmemann was searching for an approach at
Rome that indicated that the Vatican recognized the schism
within the Church, and that Rome represents "only 50
percent."
The East-West split within the Church in the sixteenth
century is where "catholicity, unity were broken. From
the beginning West and East knew each was only 50 pel - :
cent of the whole; then each 50 percent somehow feit it
had become 100 percent. This part becoming the whole is
the essense of the split," stated Schmemann. And the Vati
can Council to date "has remained tremendously Latin in
its theological thought forms. The mention of the Pope
was always defensive, apologetic, and this precludes
change."
With the quickness of humor and phrase that mark his
classroom lectures, Professor Robert McAfee Brown spoke
of the "significant kind of interplay" afforded by the non-
Catholic observers in Rome. He described the Tuesday
afternoon meetings of the observers; "We were given a
background of the doctrine under discussion, followed by
approximately two hours to indicate where we felt there

were creative possibilities, where we felt there were prob
lems. We felt our feelings were transmitted very quiekly
to those on the Council floor who could best make use of
them."
Brown listed what he felt were the significant issues of
ecumenicism at the Council. Among these was the colle
yiality of the Bishops: "this will help to shatter the image
all non-Catholics have had ... an extremely monarchistic,
papalistic view of the Church."
Brown's greatest disappointment came in the area of
religious liberty. "For making the ecumenical spirit, there
is nothing more important than a forthright stand on re
ligious liberty for all, not just the Catholics, in order to
erase the historical fears that the Catholic Church abuses
its majority status. The Council at the end was presented
with a very good and clear statement, but for some reason
they backed away from it."
The banquet was sponsored by the Committee on Re
ligious Affairs, and was chaired by CRA head Ken Stevens
with introductory remarks by University Chaplain Robert
Minto.
