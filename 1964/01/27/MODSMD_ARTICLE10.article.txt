# Where is Leadership In This University?
## 
### 
The discussion of religion at Stanford could soon become
embarassing. It is a verified fact that virtually no one is
satisfied with existing conditions. From the student Com
mittee on Religious Affairs to the campus Chaplins, from the
professors of Religious Studies to the students who attend
Memorial Church — all have voiced discontent and asked
for change. And from the Chaplain to the University's legal
council, no one has been able to demonstrate that change
is either undesirable or even difficult. Yet there has been
precisely no public indication that anyone is considering any
action on this issue. The Daily has been running an investi
gatory series on Stanford's religious policy seemingly forever.
Thursday night the ASSU Committee will present a lengthy
report on religion to the Legislature. Eveiy possible student
group is handling the question; every conceivable person and
source has been consulted. Now what?
In his address to the University last week, President Ster
ling characterized the student critic's attitude as "more
blessed to give than to receive." The President, perhaps un
beknownst to himself, touched upon a very meaningful point
here. It is certainly true that student criticism of the Univer
sity is plentiful, and that a good portion of criticism levelled
against student undertakings is rejected as meaningless. The
current discussion of religious policy has much to say about
the criticism from both sides.
Student criticism has consistently been in the direction
of action: change the liquor policy to acknowledge reality
and perhaps result in more sanity in student drinking habits;
institute co-educational housing/dining as a step toward a
residence system that develops rather than negates the work
of the academic community; give the student all possible
opportunity for political and social involvement to meet the
responsibilities of society's well-educated; permit freedom of
religion on campus to enable the the student to confront
intellectually the role of religion in his life and time; the list
can go on. The criticism levelled at the student is consist
ently in the direction of inaction: don't step beyond the class
room, don't speak out, and above all don't hold the lectures
in the classroom and the words in the text as relevant to the
broad issues of controversy facing your generation. This is
an odd reversal of roles.
The student should be criticized. The President, in deal
ing with the role of the student last week, should have de
manded more confrontation by the student of the respon
sibility of the educated to the society. His words should be
a constant barrage of criticism for unawareness, ignorance of
"the world outside," lack of application of talents, the need
for the university to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
The deans of students should be demanding why students
have not brought more seminars, lectures, guests into the resi
dences, why there are not more campus groups and publica
tions confrontating social and academic questions, why there
are not more student proposals for summer political work,
academic experimentation, fine arts workshops. It is the role
of leadership to criticize and demand action, to pose the
questions not to prohibit them. The students wait for a
leader to rise up before them.
The discussion of religion can easily conclude by taking
a place in the embarassing annals of reserved roles. It is sad
that the students are demanding permission to confront the
question of religion rather than the university demanding that
ethical statements should be confronted — for acceptance or
rejection — by them. It is sad that the CRA and the dele
gates from the Athens Conference are demanding that the
words coming from Memorial Church become relevant to the
decisions they face in pledging fraternities, in deciding to
work in Mississippi. But the greatest sadness will come if
nothing is done, for the President, the deans, the Chaplain
are leaders, no matter how they construe that role. And it
will be sad if the students are led into passive, uncaring com
mitments to stagnation.

words coming from Memorial Church become relevant to the
decisions they face in pledging fraternities, in deciding to
work in Mississippi. But the greatest sadness will come if
nothing is done, for the President, the deans, the Chaplain
are leaders, no matter how they construe that role. And it
will be sad if the students are led into passive, uncaring com
mitments to stagnation.
The discussion of religion at Stanford could soon become
embarassing. It is a verified fact that virtually no one is
satisfied with existing conditions. From the student Com
mittee on Religious Affairs to the campus Chaplins, from the
professors of Religious Studies to the students who attend
Memorial Church — all have voiced discontent and asked
for change. And from the Chaplain to the University's legal
council, no one has been able to demonstrate that change
is either undesirable or even difficult. Yet there has been
precisely no public indication that anyone is considering any
action on this issue. The Daily has been running an investi
gatory series on Stanford's religious policy seemingly forever.
Thursday night the ASSU Committee will present a lengthy
report on religion to the Legislature. Eveiy possible student
group is handling the question; every conceivable person and
source has been consulted. Now what?
In his address to the University last week, President Ster
ling characterized the student critic's attitude as "more
blessed to give than to receive." The President, perhaps un
beknownst to himself, touched upon a very meaningful point
here. It is certainly true that student criticism of the Univer
sity is plentiful, and that a good portion of criticism levelled
against student undertakings is rejected as meaningless. The
current discussion of religious policy has much to say about
the criticism from both sides.
Student criticism has consistently been in the direction
of action: change the liquor policy to acknowledge reality
and perhaps result in more sanity in student drinking habits;
institute co-educational housing/dining as a step toward a
residence system that develops rather than negates the work
of the academic community; give the student all possible
opportunity for political and social involvement to meet the
responsibilities of society's well-educated; permit freedom of
religion on campus to enable the the student to confront
intellectually the role of religion in his life and time; the list
can go on. The criticism levelled at the student is consist
ently in the direction of inaction: don't step beyond the class
room, don't speak out, and above all don't hold the lectures
in the classroom and the words in the text as relevant to the
broad issues of controversy facing your generation. This is
an odd reversal of roles.
The student should be criticized. The President, in deal
ing with the role of the student last week, should have de
manded more confrontation by the student of the respon
sibility of the educated to the society. His words should be
a constant barrage of criticism for unawareness, ignorance of
"the world outside," lack of application of talents, the need
for the university to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
The deans of students should be demanding why students
have not brought more seminars, lectures, guests into the resi
dences, why there are not more campus groups and publica
tions confrontating social and academic questions, why there
are not more student proposals for summer political work,
academic experimentation, fine arts workshops. It is the role
of leadership to criticize and demand action, to pose the
questions not to prohibit them. The students wait for a
leader to rise up before them.
The discussion of religion can easily conclude by taking
a place in the embarassing annals of reserved roles. It is sad
that the students are demanding permission to confront the
question of religion rather than the university demanding that
ethical statements should be confronted — for acceptance or
rejection — by them. It is sad that the CRA and the dele
gates from the Athens Conference are demanding that the
words coming from Memorial Church become relevant to the
decisions they face in pledging fraternities, in deciding to
work in Mississippi. But the greatest sadness will come if
nothing is done, for the President, the deans, the Chaplain
are leaders, no matter how they construe that role. And it
