# Players' Finest Performance Given in O'Neill's 'Journey'
## 
### MANUEL FREEDMAN 
Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's
Journey Into Night" serves as
one of an uncompleted cycle of
plays about the misbegotten Ty
rone family. "Journey" was not
his final statement; but it is cri
tically agreed there was no
greater.
The Stanford Players' Nitery
opened Wednesday with their pro
duction of it, directed by Rach
mael Ben Avram. Mr. Ben Av
ram made a few opening re
marks, which deceptively served
to justify his own interpretation
of the play. He denies that "Jour
ney" is O'Neill's auto-biography
and he asks his audience to ne
glect any similarities between the
fictional Tyrones and any actual
people. In short, wo are to clear
our minds so as not to disagree
with the suicide at the play's last
moment. This critic disagrees
with tho suicide. Moreover, he
questions the meaning of the play
once he accepts the suicide. "In
spite of everything I love you,"
and "We've lived through it be
fore. We can do it again." be
como meaningless. The power of
the Tyrones to accept the hope
less hope in spite of every de
spair and disguest is part of the
dramatic experience of the play,
disregarding auto-biography. Al
so, technically, the gun shot ab
solutely destroys Mary's final
speech and throws Tyrone far
beyond pity into contempt. As it
stands, all four of them should
have killed themselves if the sub
mission to guilt is suicide.
RET 11 HUNT'S performance as
Mary is the finest of tho Stan
ford season. Clinging to her last
shadow of femininity, Mrs. Hunt
seemed at moments to open her
so'f up and perhaps allow us to
see what O'Neill saw as he wrote.
Great demands are fulfilled by

the actress —violent nervousness,
row, desperate love and pity; the
portrait of a fading woman, poeti
cally painted by Mrs. Hunt.
"Give me three planks and a
passion and I'll give you a play."
With those planks and that pas
sion. Mark Hammer gives us
James Tyrone, actor, father, fail
ure (and unfortunately suicide).
O'Neill always strode to create
his plays as music. Through Ham
mer one senses the intricate and
melodic rhythm with which this
play was composed.
Bill Louis plays the defeated,
drunken, piteous James Jr. Louis'
best scene is his drunken one,
though otherwise he comes off as
a sentimental old wastrel, making
his fourth act look incongruous
with the first two. The love and
the hope he has for his family
is not a pussyfooted childish con
cern.
RICHARD WHITMORE plays
Edmund, the younger son. He is
undeniably the weakest of the
four and the farthest from giv
ing any insight whatever into the
meaning of the character. Hi s
fourth act was lost to his boyish
whining. He lacked the quality
of the young hardened man, the
struggling sensitive soul search
ing for peace, for the sense of
belonging to humanity, to the
world, to God. He looked, sounded
and acted young but that runs
the gamut of his performance.
The long evening's journey into
Nitery is an important trip to
take. There are moments when it
can be "recognized as being
deeply" O'Neill's play. There are
moments when "defeated, envi
ous, inferior" critics must recog
nize basic and partly insulting
weaknesses. Above all, however,
it is O'Neill's masterpiece and
one should not pass over the op
portunity to see this production
of it.

meaning of the character. Hi s
fourth act was lost to his boyish
whining. He lacked the quality
of the young hardened man, the
struggling sensitive soul search
ing for peace, for the sense of
belonging to humanity, to the
world, to God. He looked, sounded
and acted young but that runs
the gamut of his performance.
The long evening's journey into
Nitery is an important trip to
take. There are moments when it
can be "recognized as being
deeply" O'Neill's play. There are
moments when "defeated, envi
ous, inferior" critics must recog
nize basic and partly insulting
weaknesses. Above all, however,
it is O'Neill's masterpiece and
one should not pass over the op
portunity to see this production
of it.
Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's
Journey Into Night" serves as
one of an uncompleted cycle of
plays about the misbegotten Ty
rone family. "Journey" was not
his final statement; but it is cri
tically agreed there was no
greater.
The Stanford Players' Nitery
opened Wednesday with their pro
duction of it, directed by Rach
mael Ben Avram. Mr. Ben Av
ram made a few opening re
marks, which deceptively served
to justify his own interpretation
of the play. He denies that "Jour
ney" is O'Neill's auto-biography
and he asks his audience to ne
glect any similarities between the
fictional Tyrones and any actual
people. In short, wo are to clear
our minds so as not to disagree
with the suicide at the play's last
moment. This critic disagrees
with tho suicide. Moreover, he
questions the meaning of the play
once he accepts the suicide. "In
spite of everything I love you,"
and "We've lived through it be
fore. We can do it again." be
como meaningless. The power of
the Tyrones to accept the hope
less hope in spite of every de
spair and disguest is part of the
dramatic experience of the play,
disregarding auto-biography. Al
so, technically, the gun shot ab
solutely destroys Mary's final
speech and throws Tyrone far
beyond pity into contempt. As it
stands, all four of them should
have killed themselves if the sub
mission to guilt is suicide.
RET 11 HUNT'S performance as
Mary is the finest of tho Stan
ford season. Clinging to her last
shadow of femininity, Mrs. Hunt
seemed at moments to open her
so'f up and perhaps allow us to
see what O'Neill saw as he wrote.
Great demands are fulfilled by

the actress —violent nervousness,
row, desperate love and pity; the
portrait of a fading woman, poeti
cally painted by Mrs. Hunt.
"Give me three planks and a
passion and I'll give you a play."
With those planks and that pas
sion. Mark Hammer gives us
James Tyrone, actor, father, fail
ure (and unfortunately suicide).
O'Neill always strode to create
his plays as music. Through Ham
mer one senses the intricate and
melodic rhythm with which this
play was composed.
Bill Louis plays the defeated,
drunken, piteous James Jr. Louis'
best scene is his drunken one,
though otherwise he comes off as
a sentimental old wastrel, making
his fourth act look incongruous
with the first two. The love and
the hope he has for his family
is not a pussyfooted childish con
cern.
RICHARD WHITMORE plays
Edmund, the younger son. He is
undeniably the weakest of the
four and the farthest from giv
ing any insight whatever into the
meaning of the character. Hi s

whining. He lacked the quality
