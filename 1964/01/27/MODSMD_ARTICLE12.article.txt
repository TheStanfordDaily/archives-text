DAILY MORALITY
Editor, The* Daily:
In your issue dated Jan. 21st
appears two lotters to the Editor;
in that department.
May I quote this Jim Kloins
contribution of which we aro
sorely ashamed. (In part of
course.)
"... Stanford was founded by
one of the most ruthless robber
barons in American history—lts
most famous graduate played
politics with food in Eastern Eu
rope. . . ."
Maybe someone should "investi
gate" this writer.
Then, on the same page, is an
other letter to the Editor by a
Lars Kampmann. (In part.)
"... When she reaches for
Ted's sex organ, she is—reaching
for the muscle "in question" . . .
She is a refreshing girl, becom
ing sexually aware a year after
her body did so. . . ."
Now, what sort of "education."
is this?
We who were BORN in this
area, as I was away back in May
1895, grew up with Stanford and
its environment but since the ex
change student business grew;
where Stanford now is one eighth
foreign exchange of the total stu
dent. population, it is over grow
ing native born students, with
their arrogance and flaunting of
morality and non-responsible
political references.
When a student becomes out of
line, in this FREE speech enter
prise they indulge in, he becomes
an unlicensed nuisance to us who
love Stanford and what it once
stood for — and we hope it. will
continue even in the face of such
dastardly attacks on people and
morality as has appeared in your
letters to the Editor columns
from time to time. Let us have
morality and respectability even
in this column.

PICKETS SENSELESS
Editor, The Daily:
Having lived and studied some
years in the nation's capital, I've
encountered some pretty simp.e
minded and even some
organizations picketing this, that,
and what-have you. I've seen tho
valted esieein ox iviomw
pitted against the immorality of
Caroline's naked ponies, I've seen
the bearded "Ban the Bomber's"
shivering in bedsheets and new
sandals, and I've seen the innum
erable banners of Layfette Square
mourning the loss of man's "In
dividuality." All in all, these
people looked pretty silly, but
since our soeiety, protected by
its governmental system, encour
ages freedom of speech, (and how
few such countries there are)
who is to say they should or
shouldn't be there.
But here on Stanford's campus,
cases of such senselessness aro
really disgusting, not necessarily
because of the particular protests
represented, but because of the
so called "learnedness" associated
with the University. Actually I
use this last term with a great
deal of reserve since attending
Stanford obviously teaches some
people little that is in anyway
useful.
It's difficult to figure out just
why some of these nonsensical
"Individuals" do as they do un
less perhaps it is simply that,
they are still going through the
Junior High School Rebellion
Stage. With others, it is probably
just a matter of showing off
when they are away from
home . . . "Look at me, I believe
in the freedom of man" . . . "they
stifle the atmosphere of learning"
. . . and so on and on. (Whatever
all this means.)« However, about
all this I care little, for if some
people want to make asses of
Lhemselves, it is their privilege
and who am I to halt their fun—

after all, it is a free country.
But lei us take a closer look at
a more recent example of which
I speak — namely the group
Picketing of the NROTC Van by
the so called "Stanford Peace
Caucus." No one will dispute with
these people that war is Hell and
that there is no glory in suffer
ing and death, but who is argu
ing the point? The remainder of
their campaign is sheer hypocrisy.
After all, where and how do these
people think they obtained the
right to spout off? Did it not
come from the dying of men who
fought for what they believed—
in the freedom which some people
think is some sort of gift. Believe
me, Democracy and Freedom are
not just gifts, they are occupa
tion. Occupations in which we are
workers! For as long as one hu
man being has something that an
other hasn't, or that another
wants, and that will be as long
as there are two or more people
on the eai'th, these so called
"higher organisms" are going to
devise ways and means of taking
what they want away from one
another. The United States was
the first modern nation on earth
whei-e a truly humane social ef
fort has been made to halt this
seemingly congenital human de
fect. True, we have a long way
to go, but we have gone a long
way.
However, we are only one na
tion among many — there are
others who envy what we have,
and rightly so. for we are a most
blessed and endowed people. And
as long as nations exist which
threaten our way of life and what
we stand for, we cannot rest un
armed.
The freedom of this country
exists only because we have had
a strong means of protecting it.
Men have hurt, sweated, cried,
toiled, and die so that we can be
here at Stanford studying as we
do; so that some can spout off
their "individuality." Go ahead
and "Refuse military service,"
"Refuse paying Taxes that sup
port the military machine," and
"Refuse to work for the defense
industries." But also refuse your
self the privileges and rights
guaranteed you by these same
anterprises!

ZETES
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to take issue with
the statements of Frank Dubof
sky and Don Haider in the Daily
of Monday, January 20. The ma
jor difference between a frater
nity and a dormitory is the great
er degree of autonomy which the
fraternity has in choosing i t s
members and governing its af
fairs. If the proposals of Messrs.
Dubofsky and Haider are carried
out little difference between fra
ternities and dormitories will
exist. If fraternities are to remain
fraternities they should be al
lowed to operate as they see fit
as long as they obey the laws of
the land and the rules of Stan
ford. It is only human to try to
place the blame for one's failing
on somebody else, but the fact
remains that there are frater
nities at Stanford whi c h have
avoided the trouble which Zeta
Psi has had.
Even more important than the
local consequences of their rea
soning are the implications of it.
Is it true as they imply that the
purpose of a governing body is
to force moral behavior by the
majority or is it more reason
able to assume the purpose of a
governing body is to protect the
majority from the behavior of
the minority who choose to be
have immorally? Is the guilt for
a wrongful act society's, as the
modern liberal would have us be
lieve, or is it that of the individ
uals who commit the act?
