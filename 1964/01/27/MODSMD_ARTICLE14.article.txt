"In the beginning Clod c reated the heaven and the earth. And the earth
was (became) without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face
of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved (hovered, brooded) upon the
face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was
light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the
light from the darkness. And God called the light Day and the darkness
Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day (not neces
sarily calendar days). And God said, Let there be a firmament in the
midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And
God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the
firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was
so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second day. And God said, Let the waters under the
heaven be gathered together in one place, and let the dry land appear:
and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering to
gether of the waters he called Seas: and God saw that it was good. And
God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb (Greek: botanc)
yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit (karpos) after his kind
(genos), whose seed (sperma) is in itself, upon the earth (Ge): and it
was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after
his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his
kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning
were the third day. And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament
of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs,
and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in
the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was
so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God
set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and
to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from
the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the
morning were the fourth day. And God said. Let the waters bring forth
abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly
above the reath in the open firmament of heaven. And God created
great whales and every living creature that moveth, which the waters
brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after
his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God blessed them saying,
be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the water in the seas, and let fowl
multiply in the earth. And the evening and the morning were the fifth
day. And God said. Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
his kind, cattle and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind:
and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and
cattle after their kind, and every thing that crcepeth upon the earth
after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God said. Let us
(Trinity) make man in our image, after ourlikeness: and let them have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over
the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that
crcepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the
image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And
God blessed them, and God said unto them, be fruitful and multiply,
and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish
of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that
moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every
herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every
tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be
for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
and to every thing that crcepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life,
I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw
every thing that he had made, and. behold, it was very good. And the
evening and the morning were the sixth day. Gen: 1.
The Christian has no difficulty in accepting the Genesis account of Crea
tion, trusting the Holy Spirit to illumine the beautiful portions of Scrip
ture which tell of God's creation of the world and of man. Clear from
these passages is the original sinJessness and p< rfection of creation. Chris
tians are ever-thankful that despite the awful fall of man which followed,
full provision for the atonement of all man's sins was made bv God in
Christ Jesus. God's gift is effective through faith and persona) trust in

dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over
the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that
crcepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the

God blessed them, and God said unto them, be fruitful and multiply,
and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish
of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that
moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every
herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every
tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be
for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,

and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering to
gether of the waters he called Seas: and God saw that it was good. And
God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb (Greek: botanc)
yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit (karpos) after his kind
(genos), whose seed (sperma) is in itself, upon the earth (Ge): and it
was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after
his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his
kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning
were the third day. And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament
of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs,
and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in
the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was
so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God
set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and
to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from
the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the
morning were the fourth day. And God said. Let the waters bring forth
abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly
above the reath in the open firmament of heaven. And God created
great whales and every living creature that moveth, which the waters
brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after
his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God blessed them saying,
be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the water in the seas, and let fowl
multiply in the earth. And the evening and the morning were the fifth
day. And God said. Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
his kind, cattle and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind:
and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and
cattle after their kind, and every thing that crcepeth upon the earth
after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God said. Let us
(Trinity) make man in our image, after ourlikeness: and let them have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over
the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that
crcepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the
image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And
God blessed them, and God said unto them, be fruitful and multiply,
and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish
of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that
moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every
herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every
tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be
for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
and to every thing that crcepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life,
I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw
every thing that he had made, and. behold, it was very good. And the
evening and the morning were the sixth day. Gen: 1.
The Christian has no difficulty in accepting the Genesis account of Crea
tion, trusting the Holy Spirit to illumine the beautiful portions of Scrip
ture which tell of God's creation of the world and of man. Clear from
these passages is the original sinJessness and p< rfection of creation. Chris
tians are ever-thankful that despite the awful fall of man which followed,
full provision for the atonement of all man's sins was made bv God in
Christ Jesus. God's gift is effective through faith and persona) trust in

"In the beginning Clod c reated the heaven and the earth. And the earth
was (became) without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face
of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved (hovered, brooded) upon the
face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was
light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the
light from the darkness. And God called the light Day and the darkness
Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day (not neces
sarily calendar days). And God said, Let there be a firmament in the
midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And
God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the
firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was
so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second day. And God said, Let the waters under the
heaven be gathered together in one place, and let the dry land appear:
and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering to
