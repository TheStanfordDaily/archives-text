vailed over the Peninsula Ram
blers, 19-8, Saturday.
Intact for the first lime I his
year, Stanford's first-string rush
ing backs gave the crowd a dem
onstration of fine running and
passing. Many times five or six
passes were marie and thirty
yards covered before the Ram
blers could slop the play.
GORDON WADDELL, out of
the first g;ime with a leg injury,
passed well all afternoon, did his
usual fine job of running, and

penalty kick from the left. Stan
ford's first of the year.
Two penalty kicks put Stan
ford deep in Rambler territory.
Tim Hansel and Steve Van Nort
carried to the two, but Stanford
could not score. Soon after, at
about the 25 in the middle Stan
ford controlled the scrum and
rushed left.
Van Nort cut upfield and lat
era led to "Fargo" Freeman just
before he was tackled. Freeman
did likewise and Clark Weaver
received the ball and crossed the
goalline before being tackled.
SCRUM HALF Bob Price only
moments later started another
successful rush in Rambler terri
tory. He passed outside to Dick
Shaw, a wing, who carried along
the left sideline to the five at
which point he passed blindly
over his head to Price.
Price ran into the goal area I
and touched it down in the middle
of the field. Bob Burke converted,
and Stanford had a lead of 8-0.
The Ramblers could find no
answer to Ihe Stanford rush and
it soon scored again. Winning the

fake and then was off and run
ning. The ball went from Weaver
to Van Nort to Shaw. Shaw faked
the last defender and left him on
the ground as he crossed the
goaline.
IN THIS SECOND half, the

Ramblers at least were in the
game. They had not so much as
threatened in the first half. Mike
Ruiz tried three penalty kicks and
made a 35-yarder.
The finishing touch Stanford
inflicted on a beautiful 50-yard
rush. Van Nort passed outside to
Burke who then passed inside to
Purcell and Steve legged the re
maining distance.

in the game as several touch
kicks and short rushes covered
the necessary distance, and the
score was 19-8.
WITH RON FRABONI doing a
good job of hooking, Stanford
controlled most of the scrums.
The Ramblers made few long
rushes and seemed to base their
offense more on the kicking
game.
Coach Kmetovic thought the
first half was a good one for his
Indians, but he was concerned
about the letdown in the second
half and thinks better condition
ing tho only answer. A similar
letdown occurred in last week's
game.
