## 
### Robert W. Naylor 
'•Don't come South with all your theories, your foggy notions or
your fuzzy political labels- liberal, conservative, Democrat, .Republi
can. Stay home, we don't need you. First we need human beings."
THUS IMI'LOBLI) Bruce Gordon, Field Secretary and "trouble
shooter" for the Student Non-Violent Co-ordinating Committee, to an

overflow crowd at a meeting of
the Stanford Student Congress
Friday in the Small Lounge of
Tresidder.
"This summer we're really go
ing lo hit it hard. But if you're a
bee-bop baby, a real hip chick; if
you think you're going to hop in
your Volkswagen with' a guitar
and take a vacation South to help
the Negro, don't come. You'll
cause more trouble than you're
worth. California is a breeding
ground for nuts; stay in your
breeding ground."
Outlining the SNCC campaign
for this summer, Gordon listed
votei" registration, voter educa
tion, pressure on public accommo
dations. unionization and educa
tion of Negro labor forces, well
planned demonst rations and work
co-operatives. Georgia, Alabama
and Mississippi will be the target
states with supplemental opera
tions all over the South.
riUMlit'TS NOW being planned
call for teams of workers in ev
ery town, village and hamlet of
the South, Gordon said. Emphasis
in Georgia will lie placed on ob
taining "meaningful legislation,
not laws like the Rumford Act
which cannot be enforced but look
real nice."
"We need our best people in
Mississippi. It's going to be tough.
We want to flood them, to get in
there and get really close lo those
people. We have got to make it
a crisis issue, to get those Negroes
on the books, to mobilize white
sentiment wherever it exists. We
don't necessarily want the Presi
dential election, but wait till Sen
ator Eastland comes home! 'Hi,
there. Senator. Long time no
see.' "
Gordon emphasized that this is
"a real revolution." But, he con
tinued, "I want you to become to
tally committed to non-violence.
What about self-defense? There
is no place for it. It just fans the
fires of hatred. We become no
better than the people we're try
ing to change. We have got to
eliminate the need for violence.
You can't fight fire with fire,
you've got to use water. With
violence you might get integra
tion, but what good is that with
out human interaction?"
In answer to questions, the blue
jean-clad Negro said that ISi'on-
Violent Training Camps are being
organized in Berkeley and Port

[ land. People seriously interested
! in working in the South for a min
imum of thirty days will spend a
| week in one of these schools
I learning everything from how to
! write a press release to organiza
| tion of local village projects.
GORDON EMPHASIZED again
the need for "blood and guts"
people. "It's not a vacation, it's a
work project. You can get killed
down there. It will be rough and
hard, not romantic — I'm sorry.
We don't want to give Governor
Wallace a moment's rest. . . .
Don't worrk about going to jail
space for all.
"I don't need to tell you why we
are doing this. But don't come
down with any high-minded no
tions. SNCC has no place for
white liberals. When you come,
come to help yourself, not the
Negro. This is a pact between
your conscience and yourself, and
this is a chance for you to find
yourself, to learh what the prob
lem really is."
Gordon then pointed out that
those who do not come can "do
plenty right here in California.
Those who go will need money,
books, CARE packages (yes, it's
a foreign country down there)."
After Gordon's talk, Dennis
Sweeney led the group in singing,
after some difficulty in finding
an appropriate tunc everybody
knew. Said Gordon, "If my free
dom depended on your singing,
we'd be back in chains."
