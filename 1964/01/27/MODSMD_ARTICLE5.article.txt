# Students Find Memorial Church Unsatisfactory

### BRUCE CAMPBELL (Last in a Series) 
Students are generally dissatis
-1 fied with Memorial Church. The
| University should mako a thor
: ough .study of the religious situa
j tion at Stanford; religion cannot
I be non-sectarian.
The first statement was the con
' sensus of replies to two student
surveys conducted by the LASSU-
Daily Commit too on Religion; the
second is a recommendation made
by Dr. Hubert C. Noble. General
Director of the Commission on
Higher Education of the National
Council of the Churches of Christ.
THK FIRST survey, taken last
I quarter, was handled through the
! Legislature. Each representative
was asked to give the question
naire to two or three people in
his house who were especially in
terested in religion.
The second survey, conducted
I two weeks ago at the Registrar's
Office while students filed class
I cards, was designed to get th e
opinions of a random sampling of
students. Almost two hundred
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents (two percent of the student
body) filled out the survey.
I The survey revealed that:
• While two-thirds of Stanford
students have atended Memorial
I Church ill least once, only 3 per
cent attend regularly and 1(> per
cent occasionally;
• Of those who do not attend
Memorial Church regularly. 16
j percent think the services have
no relevance to their religious be-
I liefs and II percent believe the
services are relevant but not sat
isfying;
• Mans who attend Memorial
| Church indicated they attended
only tlie r.Midlelivhl . ivice- <ii nl

tended the regular Sunday serv
ices only to hear the music;
• Only 10 percent of the people
who do not now attend Memorial
Church go to off-campus services,
but 37 percent indicated they
would attend services of their
affiliation if those services were
held on campus.

DR. NOBLE, a nationally-known
expert on campus ministry, sug
j gested that the University should
assess the effect of the current
'policy and should examine situa-
J tions al other American colleges
i where cooperative and united
| campus ministers are being car
; ried on.
He thought Stanford's Institute
on Human Problems, under the
| direction of Nevitt Sanford, could
handle th e responsibility of an
! assessment as to what is happen
ing; that is, what is the present
I policy doing to student and fae
| ulty, and to the university in gen
eral.
Dr. Noble also raised the ques
tion: "Is there such a thing as
; non-sectarian religion? To assume
| the reality of non-sectarian reli
gion would be like having politics
[without political parties. Students
| who are religious come from par
! ticular churches, not religion in
i general."
"In a situation like that of Stan
ford where local churches arc so
j remote from the campus itself,
j particular questions of respon
sibility are raised; does the uni
versity have an obligation to re
spect the convictions of the stu
j dents and faculty who make up
j its community and thus make it
! possible to continue their reli
gious activity while members of
the university community?"
"If Memorial Church is expect
| cd to be the religious center of the
[University without relation to the
existing denominations, then
Memorial Church is a sect itself.''
In conclusion, Dr. Noble stated:
"Basically, of course, the Stan
ford administration needs to make
up its mind as to what it con
ceives 1o be the relation of faith
and learning and what this means
