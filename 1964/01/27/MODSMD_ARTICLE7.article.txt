# ASSU Travel Service to Open Today
## 
### BILL SMITH Feature Editor 
Plans for an Associated Stu-
I dents-sponsored Travel Service
! have been approved by President
I Wallace Sterling, The Daily
| learned yesterday. The Service is
i scheduled to open today.
ASSU LEGISLATURE ap
I proved the formation of the Tra-
I vel Service at its meeting last
j Thursday.
Ed Shaw, student Financial
' Manager, said, "The purpose of
the Service is to regulate student
j group and charter flights and to
I assist students in originating
flights of I heir own." Dick Falk,
co-sponsor of the Service and
Daily Business Manager, de
scribed the function of the Travel
Service saying it was "to provide
(students with the best possible
| travel arrangements at the low
i est possible prices and to be a
j regulatory body for everyone
! forming and selling travel ar-
{ rangements on campus."
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler gave The Daily a state
ment on the University's reasons
lor approving the Service. "The
University has authorized the
j ASSU to provide this service and
to regulate travel. We think there
is a need for an orderly provision
for travel for the University com
munity. Secondly, the CAB (Civil
(Aeronautics Board) regulations
are such that it is essential to
have some central group plan
travel so students aren't at: the
mercy of ill conceived schemes."
THE SERVICE is expected to
j prevent the stranding of students
j in Europe or New York as was
i the case this past summer. "Any
j one selling travel arrangements
I on campus will have to do so
through the ASSU Travel Office."

Falk said. The Service will be lo
cated on the second floor of Tre
sidder Union in the ASSU Offices.
The idea for the service began
last Spring Quarter during th e
trouble with a local travel agency.
Ed Shaw and Dick Falk talked
over the possibility of The Daily

organizing Christmas charters set
that everything would be legiti
mate.
At the same time proposals
from the agencies and airlines
were given to the University for
an agency to be responsible for
the major modes of campus I ra
vel. "So we've been working this
fall toward this type of service."
Falk said.
FALK OlITLINKI) some of the
plans the Service now has, among
which are "to initiate group
flights, charters, and tours to Eu
rope at Christmas and similar
tours to Hawaii or Mexico in the
Spring, though such trips will not
be possible this spring.
"This summer we will be initi
ating group flights to Europe and
we have 300 round trip seats
booked on Pan American, Trans
World Airlines and BOAC. These
seats will be available to a group
rate of about 38 percent saving."
Falk said.
Some examples of tentative
fares: San Francisco to Frank
fort, Germany, $530 (approx.)
roundtrip on TWA Jet; New York
to Paris, $330 (approx.) round
trip on Pan American; New York
to London, $310 (approx.) round
trip on BOAC.
"GROUP FARE flights arc
open to all students, staff and
faculty who have been members
of Stanford University for (i
months and the immediate fami
lies of traveling staff, faculty or
students," Falk said.
Future plans of the Travel Serv -
ice intend on making opportuni
ties available for travel in Cali
fornia, opportunities for students
to participate together like the
Ski Weekend. "Since we don't
want to make money, we are non
profit, we can do some of these
things that the agencies can't af
ford to do," Falk said.
"It is eventually hoped to offer
a complete travel package and
several tours are now available.
Interested students should con
tact the service in Tresiddcr,"
Falk said.
