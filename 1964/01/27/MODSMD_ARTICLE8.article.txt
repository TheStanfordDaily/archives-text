# Wedin Explains ASSU Functions

### 
(Editor's Note: The following 1
is the final portion of ASSU
President Bud YVedin's "State
of the Student Body" speech
given Thursday night 011 KZSU.
The first part of the text was
published in Friday's Daily.)
The subcommittee on the course
evaluation program intends to
[ give a more valid and broader
base to the Scratch Sheet pub
lished last year, in addition to
serving as a statistical basis for
the studies of tho General Studies
Program and Senior Colloquia.
These studies will be based on
the philosophy of each program
as a part of Stanford Education.
Recommendations coming from
these subcommittees and ideas
that have transpired in discus
sions with Faculty and Adminis
trators are not expected or in
| tended to lie accepted carte
blanche but will serve to act as
j a student commentary on changes
j and improvements and as a con
1 tributory source, if changes do
| come.
i In our commitment to pursuing
this second role of student gov
1 ernment, we have moved into still
another area of the university—
! the area of religion. And this
| time we have not moved alone,
I for ihe Stanford Daily and I he
I Committee 011 Religious Affairs
1 have also answered the call to
; meet this area of need and con
cern. A committee of the Legisla
ture, chaired by Daniel Schwartz,
i will report (within two weeks)
on tho findings of their study on
1 religion at Stanford. Moving into
i the questions such as present re
ligious policy and the relevance
of Memorial Church to campus
life, the report will present the
; most comprehensive study of the
'problem ever compiled by stu
| dents.
INITIAL INDIC ATIONS of the
| impact of this student concern
are quite encouraging and point
I toward definite change. The com
mittee report will also offer sug
| gestions for the use of the annual
multi-thousand doll a r income
from the recent Berry gift to Me-
I morial Church.
Certainly, it would be unrealis
tic to make specific predictions
about the future of religion at
Stanford, but the concern that
i students have voiced will un
doubtedly move it into a new di
rection and focus it in a keener
j light.
Perhaps the greatest contribu
tions made thus far by student
government and student leaders
! center on the term "Social Con
! sciousness.*' And it is at this point
that the question of values en
j tors, for, although no one would
presume to speak against an in
creased awareness and commit
1 merit in this general area, the sub-
Ijective judgment of what is the
I right area, and the philosophical
question of whether or not stu
dent government has any busi
ness in such areas become para
! mount.
In this context I would like to
1 speak to two points, the first
briefly and the second at greater
length. The establishment of the
: Kennedy Memorial Fund is for
! the very purpose of securing
