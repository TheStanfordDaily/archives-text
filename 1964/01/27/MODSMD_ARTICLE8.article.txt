# Wedin Explains ASSU Functions

### 
(Editor's Note: The following 1
is the final portion of ASSU
President Bud YVedin's "State
of the Student Body" speech
given Thursday night 011 KZSU.
The first part of the text was
published in Friday's Daily.)
The subcommittee on the course
evaluation program intends to
[ give a more valid and broader
base to the Scratch Sheet pub
lished last year, in addition to
serving as a statistical basis for
the studies of tho General Studies
Program and Senior Colloquia.
These studies will be based on
the philosophy of each program
as a part of Stanford Education.
Recommendations coming from
these subcommittees and ideas
that have transpired in discus
sions with Faculty and Adminis
trators are not expected or in
| tended to lie accepted carte
blanche but will serve to act as
j a student commentary on changes
j and improvements and as a con
1 tributory source, if changes do
| come.
i In our commitment to pursuing
this second role of student gov
1 ernment, we have moved into still
another area of the university—
! the area of religion. And this
| time we have not moved alone,
I for ihe Stanford Daily and I he
I Committee 011 Religious Affairs
1 have also answered the call to
; meet this area of need and con
cern. A committee of the Legisla
ture, chaired by Daniel Schwartz,
i will report (within two weeks)
on tho findings of their study on
1 religion at Stanford. Moving into
i the questions such as present re
ligious policy and the relevance
of Memorial Church to campus
life, the report will present the
; most comprehensive study of the
'problem ever compiled by stu
| dents.
INITIAL INDIC ATIONS of the
| impact of this student concern
are quite encouraging and point
I toward definite change. The com
mittee report will also offer sug
| gestions for the use of the annual
multi-thousand doll a r income
from the recent Berry gift to Me-
I morial Church.
Certainly, it would be unrealis
tic to make specific predictions
about the future of religion at
Stanford, but the concern that
i students have voiced will un
doubtedly move it into a new di
rection and focus it in a keener
j light.
Perhaps the greatest contribu
tions made thus far by student
government and student leaders
! center on the term "Social Con
! sciousness.*' And it is at this point
that the question of values en
j tors, for, although no one would
presume to speak against an in
creased awareness and commit
1 merit in this general area, the sub-
Ijective judgment of what is the
I right area, and the philosophical
question of whether or not stu
dent government has any busi
ness in such areas become para
! mount.
In this context I would like to
1 speak to two points, the first
briefly and the second at greater
length. The establishment of the
: Kennedy Memorial Fund is for
! the very purpose of securing
funds to aid projects that encour
age social and political conscious
ness. Mention of the commitment
to and worth of such a project
is hardly necessary; but the ques
tion of student government in
volvement in less neutral areas is
more controversial.

THK ACTIVITY with which
student leaders accepted the chal
lenge of civil l ights in Mississippi
speaks clearly for kind of deci
sion they made. Student leaders
talked at U. of Calif., Mills Col
lege and U. of P.; they contacted
the Governor's office to assure
maximum protection and secured

legal assistance. Perhaps one of
the obligations student govern
ment can never retreat from is
that of deciding its position on
all questions relevant to Stan
ford and then acting upon that
decision. At many points disagree
ment and even controversy may
be the result of an action, b u t
this in itself serves the purpose
of engendering an attitude of
awareness and questioning. To
retreat from this is, of course, to
retreat from the vital spirit of a
university. Thus, it does not ap
pear involvement in questions of
social and political consciousness
will abate in the months ahead;
in fact, the proposed Spring Civil
Rights Conference coupled with
the institution of a summer work
project in the South would indi
cate otherwise. This seems a fit
ting complement to the exchange
with a Negro college which the
university is presently discussing.
In this second role, a role which
imparts to student government
a critical voice in the wider ram
ifications of student concern, stu
dent government has been seri
ously hampered by a university
imposed restriction on social and
political involvement. Thus, we
could not speak out as the gov
ernment of the student commu
nity when fourteen of our mem
bers were facing a crisis in the
South. In contrast to this, the
University of the Pacific passed
a resolution supporting the mock
vote and the efforts of our stu
dents.
IT OCCURS TO ME that if a
government cannot serve to meet
the needs of its members, it be
comes irrelevant and operates in
effectively. The present restric
tion on student government does
just that in this area of student
concern. And it seems fair to con
jecture that Stanford might be
able to uncover at least as many
responsive students as can th e
University of the Pacific, students
responsive enough to act w h en
there is a need. There was a need
and we at Stanford could not act.
Our answer thus far has been
to operate with maximum flexibil
ity within the present restrictions.

The legislature's passage of a
resolution protesting tlie Ameri
can Legion's position on the Na
tional Student Association speaks
for such a flexibility.
But to consider many other
relevant and meaningful q ue s
tions, even a maximum of flexibil
ity falls short. I anticipate some
movement to go beyond the limi
tations of existing policy and only
hope it comes from a change in
that policy.
I expect the pattern to continue
and perhaps even to intensify.
And in this we will continue to
make our contributions to the
Stanford community.

1 religion at Stanford. Moving into
i the questions such as present re
ligious policy and the relevance
of Memorial Church to campus
life, the report will present the
; most comprehensive study of the
'problem ever compiled by stu
| dents.
INITIAL INDIC ATIONS of the
| impact of this student concern
are quite encouraging and point
I toward definite change. The com
mittee report will also offer sug
| gestions for the use of the annual
multi-thousand doll a r income
from the recent Berry gift to Me-
I morial Church.
Certainly, it would be unrealis
tic to make specific predictions
about the future of religion at
Stanford, but the concern that
i students have voiced will un
doubtedly move it into a new di
rection and focus it in a keener
j light.
Perhaps the greatest contribu
tions made thus far by student
government and student leaders
! center on the term "Social Con
! sciousness.*' And it is at this point
that the question of values en
j tors, for, although no one would
presume to speak against an in
creased awareness and commit
1 merit in this general area, the sub-
Ijective judgment of what is the
I right area, and the philosophical
question of whether or not stu
dent government has any busi
ness in such areas become para
! mount.
In this context I would like to
1 speak to two points, the first
briefly and the second at greater
length. The establishment of the
: Kennedy Memorial Fund is for
! the very purpose of securing
funds to aid projects that encour
age social and political conscious
ness. Mention of the commitment
to and worth of such a project
is hardly necessary; but the ques
tion of student government in
volvement in less neutral areas is
more controversial.

THK ACTIVITY with which
student leaders accepted the chal
lenge of civil l ights in Mississippi
speaks clearly for kind of deci
sion they made. Student leaders
talked at U. of Calif., Mills Col
lege and U. of P.; they contacted
the Governor's office to assure
maximum protection and secured

legal assistance. Perhaps one of
the obligations student govern
ment can never retreat from is
that of deciding its position on
all questions relevant to Stan
ford and then acting upon that
decision. At many points disagree
ment and even controversy may
be the result of an action, b u t
this in itself serves the purpose
of engendering an attitude of
awareness and questioning. To
retreat from this is, of course, to
retreat from the vital spirit of a
university. Thus, it does not ap
pear involvement in questions of
social and political consciousness
will abate in the months ahead;
in fact, the proposed Spring Civil
Rights Conference coupled with
the institution of a summer work
project in the South would indi
cate otherwise. This seems a fit
ting complement to the exchange
with a Negro college which the
university is presently discussing.
In this second role, a role which
imparts to student government
a critical voice in the wider ram
ifications of student concern, stu
dent government has been seri
ously hampered by a university
imposed restriction on social and
political involvement. Thus, we
could not speak out as the gov
ernment of the student commu
nity when fourteen of our mem
bers were facing a crisis in the
South. In contrast to this, the
University of the Pacific passed
a resolution supporting the mock
vote and the efforts of our stu
dents.
IT OCCURS TO ME that if a
government cannot serve to meet
the needs of its members, it be
comes irrelevant and operates in
effectively. The present restric
tion on student government does
just that in this area of student
concern. And it seems fair to con
jecture that Stanford might be
able to uncover at least as many
responsive students as can th e
University of the Pacific, students
responsive enough to act w h en
there is a need. There was a need
and we at Stanford could not act.
Our answer thus far has been
to operate with maximum flexibil
ity within the present restrictions.

The legislature's passage of a
resolution protesting tlie Ameri
can Legion's position on the Na
tional Student Association speaks
for such a flexibility.
But to consider many other
relevant and meaningful q ue s
tions, even a maximum of flexibil
ity falls short. I anticipate some
movement to go beyond the limi
tations of existing policy and only
hope it comes from a change in
that policy.
I expect the pattern to continue
and perhaps even to intensify.
And in this we will continue to
make our contributions to the

: Kennedy Memorial Fund is for
! the very purpose of securing
funds to aid projects that encour
age social and political conscious
ness. Mention of the commitment
to and worth of such a project
is hardly necessary; but the ques
tion of student government in
volvement in less neutral areas is
more controversial.

THK ACTIVITY with which
student leaders accepted the chal
lenge of civil l ights in Mississippi
speaks clearly for kind of deci
sion they made. Student leaders
talked at U. of Calif., Mills Col
lege and U. of P.; they contacted
the Governor's office to assure
maximum protection and secured

legal assistance. Perhaps one of
the obligations student govern
ment can never retreat from is
that of deciding its position on
all questions relevant to Stan
ford and then acting upon that
decision. At many points disagree
ment and even controversy may
be the result of an action, b u t
this in itself serves the purpose
of engendering an attitude of
awareness and questioning. To
retreat from this is, of course, to
retreat from the vital spirit of a
university. Thus, it does not ap
pear involvement in questions of
social and political consciousness
will abate in the months ahead;
in fact, the proposed Spring Civil
Rights Conference coupled with
the institution of a summer work
project in the South would indi
cate otherwise. This seems a fit
ting complement to the exchange
with a Negro college which the
university is presently discussing.
In this second role, a role which
imparts to student government
a critical voice in the wider ram
ifications of student concern, stu
dent government has been seri
ously hampered by a university
imposed restriction on social and
political involvement. Thus, we
could not speak out as the gov
ernment of the student commu
nity when fourteen of our mem
bers were facing a crisis in the
South. In contrast to this, the
University of the Pacific passed
a resolution supporting the mock
vote and the efforts of our stu
dents.
IT OCCURS TO ME that if a
government cannot serve to meet
the needs of its members, it be
comes irrelevant and operates in
effectively. The present restric
tion on student government does
just that in this area of student
concern. And it seems fair to con
jecture that Stanford might be
able to uncover at least as many
responsive students as can th e
University of the Pacific, students
responsive enough to act w h en
there is a need. There was a need
and we at Stanford could not act.
Our answer thus far has been
to operate with maximum flexibil
ity within the present restrictions.

The legislature's passage of a
resolution protesting tlie Ameri
can Legion's position on the Na
tional Student Association speaks
for such a flexibility.
But to consider many other
relevant and meaningful q ue s
tions, even a maximum of flexibil
ity falls short. I anticipate some
movement to go beyond the limi
tations of existing policy and only
hope it comes from a change in
that policy.
I expect the pattern to continue
and perhaps even to intensify.
And in this we will continue to
make our contributions to the
Stanford community.

The subcommittee on the course
evaluation program intends to
[ give a more valid and broader
base to the Scratch Sheet pub
lished last year, in addition to
serving as a statistical basis for
the studies of tho General Studies
Program and Senior Colloquia.
These studies will be based on
the philosophy of each program

j and improvements and as a con
1 tributory source, if changes do
| come.
i In our commitment to pursuing
this second role of student gov
1 ernment, we have moved into still
another area of the university—
! the area of religion. And this
| time we have not moved alone,
I for ihe Stanford Daily and I he
I Committee 011 Religious Affairs
1 have also answered the call to
; meet this area of need and con
cern. A committee of the Legisla
ture, chaired by Daniel Schwartz,
i will report (within two weeks)
on tho findings of their study on
1 religion at Stanford. Moving into
i the questions such as present re
ligious policy and the relevance
of Memorial Church to campus
life, the report will present the
; most comprehensive study of the
'problem ever compiled by stu
| dents.
INITIAL INDIC ATIONS of the
| impact of this student concern
are quite encouraging and point
I toward definite change. The com
mittee report will also offer sug
| gestions for the use of the annual
multi-thousand doll a r income
from the recent Berry gift to Me-
I morial Church.
Certainly, it would be unrealis
tic to make specific predictions
about the future of religion at
Stanford, but the concern that
i students have voiced will un
doubtedly move it into a new di
rection and focus it in a keener
j light.
Perhaps the greatest contribu
tions made thus far by student
government and student leaders
! center on the term "Social Con
! sciousness.*' And it is at this point
that the question of values en
j tors, for, although no one would
presume to speak against an in
creased awareness and commit

Ijective judgment of what is the
I right area, and the philosophical
question of whether or not stu
