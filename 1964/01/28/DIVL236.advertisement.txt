ABOUT EVOLUTION
"Involution is :i humanly devised theory which has no truly scientific basis or
evidence upon which to rest, hut is all the same believed by college and university
professors and in general the intellectual class. No thoughtful person can avoid the
problem of the origin of all things, and the evolutionary theory is perhaps the best
theory that unregnerate man can conceive. The unsaved cannot taki (lod and llis
revelation into their thoughts. lie certainly is not in all their thoughts (I's. 10:4)
The divine, seeming so unreal to them, the concept of deity has not provided a rea
sonable enough basis for their minds when it is declared that tiod did anything.
Therefore, being unable to believe the (iencsis account of creation and not having
any ability to believe (1 Cor. 2) that there is a (Jod who created all things, they
have devised the best theory they can, but still with great inconsistency. As avowedly
scientific men. they must refuse to accept anything which i- unproved; yet in this
theory of evolution they accept every word of testimony regardless of a lack of
proof, and of course no effectual line of proof has been constructed or discovered.
Such men in their unrcgenerate limitation are to be pitied. No Spirit-taught person
will have trouble with the (ienesis account of creation. Having nothing to put in
its place, however, the evolutionist must devise the best theory that he can with
which to satisfy the mind on the vexing problem of origins." Lewis Sperry Chafer,
Systematic Thcoloiiy, Dallas Theological Seminary, 194 X.
It is not necessary for you to have unanswered questions in your heart concerning
the origin of man. and your own origin and destiny. The (lod of creation regenerates
any individual who puts his trust in Jesus, and thereafter His Holy Spirit brings all
believer* into certain heart-knowledge (as well as intellectual understanding) of
His living reality and purpose. Don't be mislead by the lust, regardless of their
learning and education!
