# Hottel Notes Shortage Of Educated Wives
## 
### 
Men still outnumber women two
to one in the colleges of the coun
try and there is a shortage of the
kind of educated wives modern
men are seeking, Dr. Althea K.
Hottel of Bryn Mawr, Pa., told
Stanford women students yester
day afternoon.
Keynoting the AWS program on
"The Educated Woman," Dr.
Hottel outlined the growing im
portance of education in the lives
of women both in their homes and
communities. She cited the vital
function of education in develop
ing a sense of values upon which
"the quality of civilization de
pends."
WHAT DISTURBS most of us
is that only one fourth of the
women capable of profiting from
higher education in the United
States are in college a waste of
talent this country can ill afford,"
said the former dean of women
at the University of Pennsylva
nia.
"Another disconcerting fact is
that a higher proportion of

women drop out of college before
completing their degrees than
men.
"I would be reluctant to think
that girls just do not have the
persistence to attain their goals,
or that having attained oiu> goal,
a husband, their goals for per
sonal development other than the
biological no longer seem impor
tant. It would seem that now
women are free to take some form
of higher education, they appar
ently are not so eager after all
to put the effort into it.
"AND NOW that the university
men appear to prefer better ed
ucated women for wives, there
are about one half enough avail
able.
"It is a well known fact that
when men are being considered
for important promotions in their
jobs, their wives are considered
very carefully by management.
Their education, social poise, abil
ity to mix well in educated circles,
and their qualities that will stim
ulate the best development of
their husbands are evaluated.
"Our real concern is not whether
women will use their education,
but whether women will acquire
the level of education they will
need before they marry in order
to live successfully and with satis
faction in the kind of world we
inhabit."
1)I{. HOTTEL, who has served
her country on the Social Com
mission of tho United Nations
Economic and Social Council,
cited an estimate that there are
some 700 million people in the
world who are illiterate, "and the
majority of these are women."
She discussed the multiple roles
of women in modern American so
ciety as individual, wife, profes
sional worker, mother, and citi
zen and the importance of ed
ucation in all of them. She em
phasized the need to develop
standards of quality and to learn
how to find such standards in
fields in which one cannot be an
authority.
