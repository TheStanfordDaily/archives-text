# Old Problem for New Library
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD 
The mutilation of books and
especially periodicals is a con
stant problem for any library,
and this problem has not by
passed Stanford Fundamental
Standard or no Fundamental
Standard.
The dilemma was delineated re
cently by David Weber, assistant
director of the Library .in the Li
brary Bulletin: "Tight controls
defeat the educational process by
separating students from books,
and they are ethically odious and
mechanically difficult to impose.
Easy access, on the other hand,
permits a minority to practice
mischievous, annoying, and some
times vandalous acts. Here is a
library dilemma born of twentieth
century mass education."
At a time when the University
is planning an Undergraduate Li
brary "with all reasonable speed,"
this problem becomes much more
than an academic nuisance. The
planners must determine what
controls, it' any, wil be built into
the new library.
Unfortunately, however, mutil
ation of the type described above
is not <»nly easy to commit,
especially in a relatively "open"
room such as the Humanities and
Sciences reading room, it is also
"virtually impossible to dis
cover," explained Joseph Belloli,
chief librarian of the Humanities
and Social Science division. Hold
ing up an expensive economics
book which had 22 pages missing,
he continued, "We usually don't
discover a mutilation such as this
until another interested student
si arts to use the text, or until we
, f.,1 tti. n.iol iii the bindery."

| The cost of repairing such mu
itilations varies. If, as is usual,
• the damaged article is a periodi
cal, either a new issue is bought
at a minimal price, or, if the
issue is in a bound volume, the
j whole thing must be rebound for
a not so minimal price. In some
cases, where only one page has
j been mutilated, a copy can be
I made by a Xerox machine a n d
[tipped into the volume for about
I $1.
If the damage is done to an en-
I cyclopedia or other series, the
j costs can be prohibitive. It is nor
j mally impossible to buy a single
j volume of, say the "Britannica"
J and rebinding costs are high.
| Books that are not part of a ser
! ies can usually be replaced; some
I times if they are old classics
by pocket copies. Or. in some
leases, the University of Califor
nia or some other library will
send a photostat lo be inserted
in place of the missing page(s).
Just how extensive is this type
j of mutilation and what is being
I done to combat it ?
According to Elmer Grieder.
I Acting Director of Libraries, t he
problem here is not serious as
elsewhere, especially in large ur
ban libraries, "but even one inci
| dent is one too many." While not
|ing that there have been "very
| few" serious violations delected
| lately and that "there seems to
| be an increasing sense of respon
sibility among students," Grieder
also added that the problem lends
| to go in cycles.
"A few years ago," he ex
! plained, "we had a wave of van
j dalism. Wo even had the police
in. We never did find out who
diil ii I"!iil lfler tliit the mob

lem lessened, or perhaps we just
didn't discover any more mutila
tions."
Aside from spot checks and in
ventory, which serve only to dis
cover violations and cannot pre
vent them, the Library also takes
more positive actions. According
to Grieder. the new library will
have some kind of inspection desk
and specific exit lanes (from two
to eight i which will make it easy
to get in and out of rooms while
insuring quick service and ade
quate surveillance. "Bui we have
not yet decided to use exit turn
stiles as many libraries do." con
cluded Grieder.
Along with control, the Library
hies to prevent mutilation by
offering other palliatives such as
more copies of heavily-used ma
terials. But the most important
and the cheapest way to alleviate
the problem is to expand the
copying services. Presently, the
Xerox machine in the Newspaper
Room will copy one page for 10
cents. Perhaps more machines,
cheaper prices, and more conveni
ent hours will be instituted at
Ihe new library.
The final, and least popular,
answer to the problem is punish
ment. Violations such as deliber
ate removal of non-circulating
books, false signatures, and mu
tilations are brought before Men's
Council and Dean 11. Donald Win
bigler as violations ol the Funda
mental Standard. And. according
to Weber, it is the Fundamental
Standard, which "encourages
standards of social responsibility"
that is "the only real guarantee
that all members of the Univer
sity will have a reasonable chance
