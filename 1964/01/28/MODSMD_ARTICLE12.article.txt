# Freshmen State Upperclass Living Preferences in Poll
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR MICHAEL COHEN 
With the pre-rush period about
to begin, a Daily poll of 611 fresh
men men living in both Stern
and Wilbur reveals that the qual
ity of associates is the
most important factor in consid
ering the alternatives of upper
class living.
Study conditions and living fa
cilities ranked second and th ird
respectively of eleven criteria
listed. On the other hand, social
prestige ranked eighth and the
cultural and extracurricular
sports programs ranked last. The
folowing are the exact percent
ages of criteria selected as most
important:
MOST IMPORTANT C RITERIA
1. Quality of People 24.2%
2. Study Conditions 16.6%
3. Living Facilities 18.2%
4. Social Program 10.6%
5. Intellectual Atmosphere 9.2%
(J. Quality of Food 8.6%
7. Rules and Regulations 4.2%
8. Social Prestige 3.8%
9. Recreational Facilities 3.2%
10. Cultural Program 2.8%
11. Extracui'icular Sports
Program 1.6%
Other 2.0%
IN RANDOM interviews fresh
men emphasized repeatedly their
lack of information about Stern,
fraternities, and eating clubs. Said
one, "It's good to know what
you're rejecting as well as what
you're accepting." Said another
more cynically, "I don't have too
much to compare with, but any
thing would be better than this."
Most of those polled, however,
had al least some idea though
sometimes inaccurate, of what
the various alternatives had to
offer. "The Eating Club is a good
way to maintain contact with the
University while living off cam
pus" was the conclusion of one.
"Stern is all booking and no play
and J'rats are all play and no
booking," was another's com
ment.
There was a good deal of com

ment on fraternity life with ref
erence to the recent expulsion of
Zeta Psi. "Opportunities lo carry
guns and burn cars" was penciled
in as a top criterion on one poll.
A CORRELATION was made
between choice of criteria and
choice of living group, showing
thai those people who are look
ing for a social program choose
fraternities, while whose who lisi
intellectual atmosphere as most
important prefer Stern Hall. For
men to whom absence of rules
and regulations was most impor
tant, off campus living seemed to
be first choice.
A surprise was that eating
clubs ranked low among those
who considered Ihe quality of
food to be an important criterion.
Those who chose "quality of
people" overwhelmingly preferred
fraternity living, probably re
flecting the advertised opportun
ity to choose those with whom
one will live in the future.
After the rush season is over
late in Spring Quarter, the Daily
will run a second poll of frosh
men to determine any shifts in
attitude that may take place as
a result of open houses and in
formation programs.
