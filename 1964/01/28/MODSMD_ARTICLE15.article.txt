NAVY RECRUITING
Editor, The Daily:
The following letter is being
sent to the commanding officer,
Alameda Naval Air Station:
Dear Sir:
That the Navy has been allowed
to place a van on the property of
Stanford University for the pur
pose of inducing students into
its service seems to me quite
clearly to imply—if we add the
familiar premise that one ought
to do unto others, etc.—that stu
dents can rightfully claim a simi
lar privilege—that of being al
lowed to station themselves on a
central portion of naval property
for the purpose of inducing mem
bers of the Navy to desert (or,
if you prefer, to mutiny)—or, at
least, not to re-enlist.
I know that there are reasons
—bad ones, I think—for men to
affiliate themselves with the
Navy; there are also reasons—
good ones, I think—for men not
to affiliate themselves with the
Navy. The Navy has been allowed
a favorable situation to present
its side ol' the argument to the
members of the University, I
merely ask that—in return—stu
dents be allowed favorable cir
cumstances under which to pre
sent their side of the argument
to the members of the Navy.
If you are prepared to recog
nize the very basic obligation
which you have incurred (and I
fear that you will be involved in
severe inconsistencies if you are
prepared to reciprocate for the
privilege which has been granted
you, then I shall be pleased to
appear at the Naval Air Station
with posters and pamphlets (I
got no van, man), encouraging
your subordinates to dissociate
themselves from the Navy.
If you do not fulfill your obli
gation, then I must make a plea
for consistency on your part and
ask that you withdraw your re
cruitment van and not return it
until you have recognized the
mutuality of our claims to propa
gandize each other.

DAILY TAMPERS
Editor, The Daily:
A name and, ergo, history have
once again been tampered with
by the Daily. But, as Friedrich
Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, men
tor of Kierkegaard and Engels,
said: "Arbitrariness is . . . the
Goddess of History" (System des
transcendentalen Idealismus, 1800,
Works, 111, p. 589).

KEANE ART
Editor, The Daily:
There is probably nothing quite
so disconcerting as finding that
a person whose work you think
mediocre, commercial, and per
haps insincere, has been invited
to speak at your university. It
happened to me Thursday. I saw
Margaret Keane's picture on page
one and read the copy. I laughed.
It was ludicrous, but it wasn't
funny. Oh, Stanford, here we go
again.
I don't know much about Mar
garet Keane or her work; I've
never seen much reason to. Once,
broke, I wandered into the Keane
gallery (on Broadway in San
Francisco, open evenings to catch
the theater crowd) and spent an
hour there looking at the pic
tures. I won't say I wasn't inter
ested: Mrs. Keane paints pretty
women of a wildy melancholic
sort which in my more romantic
adolescence I sought as one seeks
the Grail: vainly. Her husband
paints pretty pictures, too: tat
tered little girls with big eyes,
clutching their little dogs, a n d
looking tearfully out at the cruel
world. I believe they colloborate
on these. They also put out
Christmas cards with them on—
a whole bunch of kids, all differ
ent colors, all with the big eyes.
And the publicity they manage
to get is voluminous — they have
papered a whole room in their
gallery with press clippings and
photographs, in which you are
shown the big names that buy
their work: socialites, movie
stars.
Now, Margaret Keane may be
a perfectly reasonable woman.
She looks as if she is: clean, at
tractive, productive. But it seems
to me that the AWS do themsel
ves and all of us a disfavor by
asking her to talk on art — be
cause it does not seem to me that
her work is art. I'm afraid that
the AWS measured her by her
success and measured that in dol
lars, cents, and column inches,
rather than by the respect and
admiration of artists and are
critics for her work, the criteria
by which those of us who do not
know art well ought to judge
artists. Surely the Art Depart
ment has not put its name to her,
nor would, but they might well
have been able to suggest some
one more qualified to talk on
"art" as they use the term, some
one to whom we could have lis
tened with respect and not with
tongue in cheek.
But we won't have that some

one, we'll have Margaret Keane.
And if she is honest and sincere,
she will discuss her work as
"art," and if she is insincere she'll
discuss it as "art." And the know
ing will leer, and the ignorant be
misled, and Stanford will plod its i
way toward mediocrity.
DAVID RANSOM
NSA
Editor, The Daily:
A cheer is in order for the in
dependent Antioch students fol
lowing their decision to dissolve
the chapter of the National Stu
dent Organization on their cam
pus. The NSA claims incorrectly
to bo the political voice of Amer
ican students. Certainly it cannot
be denied that the NSA is cap
able of doing many beneficial acts
such as bringing speakers to a
campus and organizing seminars
on world problems.
The NSA and other large inter
est groups of a political nature
encourage political apathy and in
souciance. They say "join in and
sign, and while you sit back I'll
fight your cause, I'll speak for
you." the oft restated liberal
Lockian ideals of freedom as for
fredom from restraint has been
changed by the NSA to freedom
as freedom from obligation. As
each campus joins, all the stu
dents of that campus are deliver
ing their political voice to the
national policy making hoard of
the NSA; by this action each stu
dent also is released of his re
sponsibility (so claims the NSA)
to take political action or express
himself on an issue of national
interest.
As much as the philosopher
considers philosophy an activity,
so also do most political scientists
consider the political an activity
where participation is needed. We
are intelligent, educated people
able to speak and write here at
Stanford. Political freedom in a
state demands responsibility, edu
cation, and participation. Joining
the NSA encourages at an early
stage in a students' intellectual
development, political irresponsi
bility and apathy; and as a result
it discourages the use of a stu
dent's abilities to express himself
politically. Why shirk our respon
sibility? Why not independent
political activity? Why join NSA?

STANFORD BIOLOGY
Editor, The Daily:
There has been an insistent
trend in biology at Stanford Uni
versity in recent years to aban
don the study of systematics and
ecology for newer frontiers in
molecular biology. There is no
question of the extreme impor
tance of the recent spectacular
discoveries in physiology, b i o
chemistry and genetics; but with
out an understanding of natural
history, of the evolution and in
teraction of plants and animals
outside the confines of the labora
tory, the study of biology will
continue to lose its integration.
Natural history and systematic
studies are located in the Division
of Systematic Biology, with head
quarters in a musty wing of the
Museum, separated from little
Leland's treasures by a thin, slid
ing door. Even the biology library
is divided between Jordan Hall
on Quad and the Museum. This
unique arrangement further ex
emplifies the present trends iso
lating the study of evolution and
environment from the study of
cells and tissues. This is an arti
ficial dichotomy.
One must realize that the study
of phylogenetic relationships,
while dating from the nineteenth
century and men like Darwin and
Jordan, are as vital to a compre
hensive understanding of life on
earth as is the ultra-structure of
DNA.
The biologist of today must be

aware of tho breadth of his field
so that he may better integrate
his speciality with the whole. Ho
must not lose the roll for th o
molecule, the tissue for the cell,
the organism for the tissue, tho
forest for the trees.

ZETES
Editor, The Daily:
Prior to Mr. Dubofsky's expose
in Monday's Daily we were de
liberately led to believe that the
blame for the recent Zete house
expulsion lay with the house and
its members. But now the truth
has been revealed — the real cul
prit , hiding behind the thin ve
neer of San Francisco Chronicle
headlines in none other than you.
Mr. University. How could you?
Turning those 50 blameless
youths into case-hardened crimi
nals.
We can't hope to rid ourselves
of the malaise and moral irre
sponsibility which our society
finds itself embroiled. BUT Mr.
University, we think it's high
time you ended that "negative"
attitude of yours — that "do
nothing" attitude which you use
as an excuse to keep out of stu
dent's affairs if at all possible.
How could you? Please, Mr. Uni
versity, enter into student affairs
and protect all of us. Keep us
from those places of sin—The O
and the B; prevent us from in
dulging in those terrible wild
gambling and drinking parties.
As for your unfair chastize
ment of the Zetes over five of
these last seven years — why
don't you place the blame where
it lies — on yourself for letting
individualism run rampant over
the campus; with society for
lapsing morally; and on the
AKL's who obviously incited the
normally mLld-mannored Zetes
into action last fall.
Personally, we feel you owe Mr.
Dubofsky a great deal for open
ing peoples' eyes to your failure
in the Zete house and "many
other places." How could you?

DAILY ERROR
Editor, The Daily:
Thanks to the perception and
action of Mr. Stevenson of the
School of Law, some misunder
standings concerning architect
Bruce Goff that appeared in the
venerable, but inaccurate, Daily
were corrected.
Indeed, Mr. Goff's remarks
spoke of "eommonism" — not
"communism" — with regards to
the strangulation of individual
expression it imposes upon archi
tecture, and subsequently, all
of life.
The Daily had made a typo
graphical error.
Further, as meritorious as Mr.
Goff may be — and may well he
be — for being a singularly in
dividualistic expressor of archi
tectural works, the original Daily
article had meant to suggest a
possible criticism. That is, need
one be flamboyant and involved
to create an individualistic ex
pression? Cannot reserved taste
and subtleties be expressed in a
similarly peculiar and individual
manner?
But the original Daily reader
could not get this far. for t. h °
article had 'been cut off; upon
this point. It was left for a per
ceptive reader such as Mr. Steven
son to call attention to the mis
spelled and slashed commentary
on Mr. Goff, as originally printed.
