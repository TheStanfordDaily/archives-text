# West German Students Term Neutrality Key to Reunification
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Stanford-in-Germany XI 
A neutral Germany, without foreign troops and without close
ties with either the East or the West, is seen by a large portion
of West German university student opinion as the way toward
German reunification.
Students in the Federal Republic are speaking increasingly of
the need for reunification and the need to act soon to bring it about.
There is a feeling that just waiting and hoping only decreases the
chances of reunification's ever taking place.
In talking with students about the problem of a divided Ger
many, one finds little opposition to these views among the politically
interested. But the intensity with which the need for a reunited Ger
man people is expressed is much greater among the younger than
among the older generations.
AS WILLY BRANDT, mayor of West Berlin, expressed in his
book The Ordeal of Coexistance, "the younger generation in Ger
many, not identifying itself with the failings and sins of their
fathers and grandfathers, certainly will press for the right of self
determination with less constraint and greater forcefulness than has
been done in past years."
The present failure to take positive steps toward reunification,
so the thinking goes, is grounded on a refusal to find sufficiently
significant compromises or negotiable points with which to bring
about Soviet and East German acquiescence to an "acceptable"
reunified Germany.
Those areas in which West Germany can yield are said to be
the following: (1) withdrawal of Western armed forces from West
Germany; (2) withdrawal of the Federal Republic from the Euro
pean Common Market and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization;
(3) closer relations with East Germany, economic and political; and
(4) closer trade ties with the Soviet Union and East European satel
lites. The one unnegotiable point is the necessity for non-Commu
nist and democratic institutions in the reunified Germany.
The ramifications of such proposals are considerable. For the
sake of reunification, students are willing to scrap the results of
fourteen years of Adenauer's efforts toward a united Europe and
a strong Atlantic Alliance, because, it is thought, these policies have
only resulted in a more permanent division of Germany.
FURTHERMORE, THIS line of thought places a great deal of
trust in the integrity of the Soviet Union by placing the whole of
Germany at the mercy of Soviet forces, which might not be with
drawn from the German Democratic Republic in response to large
scale Western concessions. Ignored is the undoubted reluctance of
Communism to retreat from any ground once gained, as well as the
Russian and East European fears of the potential power of a re
united Germany.
These neutralist opinions, although apparently widespread among
students, find little support within any of the three major political
parties of West Germany. The Christian Democratic Union, still
under the strong influence of Adenauer, would at most favor an
increase in East-West trade under the Chancellorship of Ludwig
Erhard. At the same time the CDU would favor even closer West
ern unity.
The Free Democrats, presently in close coalition with the CDU,
go further in advocating strong ties with the East and willingness
to compromise, but no FDP politician would consider a withdrawal
from major ties with the West.
The Democratic Socialist Party, having opposed in its early years
and even until 1959 any ties with the West as being contrary to
possible steps toward reunification, has accepted these ties under
the leadership of Brandt and now advocates a strong Western com
munity organized around NATO and the EEC. The SPD, however,
remains the hope of many students. Its new pro-Western stand,
it is said, will change when it gains power and sees the futility .of
present policies with regard to reunification.
