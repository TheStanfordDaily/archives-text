# Laser Co-Inventor To Talk of Uses
## 
### 
Professor Arthur L. Schawlow
of the Stanford Physics Depart
ment will speak on the laser to
day at 4:15 p.m. in Room 274 of
Tresidder Union. The speech is
first of the "Science at Stanford
Series," sponsored by Tresidder,
and will be illustrated by slides
and the laser instrument.
Schawlow is co-inventor of the
laser with C. H. Townes. The
laser is a device which produces
intense and pure beams of light.
The potential uses of the laser
have yet to bo completely
fathomed. The Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospital lias developed eye sur
gery techniques using the laser.
Accurate measurements of th o
distance of the moon and clouds
are further applications.
Schawlow has received the
Stuart Ballantine Medal and the
Thomas Young Medal and Prize
for his work with the laser.
