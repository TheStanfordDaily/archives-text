## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's J.V. team held off
an almost brilliant second-half
comeback by the Frosh team to
win a squeaky (53-59 overtime
thriller. The game was played
Friday afternoon in the Pavilion.
The first four minutes gave a
good indication of what the game
was to be like as the lead changed
hands with each bucket, but with
4:30 gone J.V. guard Skip Hutch
inson came off the bench to spark
his team to a si/able half-time
lead.
WITH THE arrival of guard
Hutchinson the J.V.'s turned two
errant passes into easy buckets,
and Hutchinson dropped in two
long jumpers. The Braves con
tinued their' scoring ways for ihe
rest of the half, aided by Bob
Evans 14 points and outpointing
the Frosh 21-4 in the last five
minutes to take a 38-22 lead at
the intermission.
The Frosh weren't willing to go
down that easily though and with
the aid of a tenacious full court
press the Frosh rolled up 15
points compared to the Brave's
4 in the first four minutes of the
| second half.
Then with 9:44 left to play
j Frosh forward Kent Borchard
dropped in a jump-shot from the
side to narrow the J.V, lead to
two points, 48-46. The teams

traded buckets, and with 6:37 to
go a shot by forward Bill Kelso
gave the Frosh the lead, 54-53.
The score was 57-55 in favor of
the Frosh with a minute left to
play when ihe Braves popped in
a big two points.
THE FROSH attempted a shot
with 8 seconds left, but it was
| blocked and the Braves called
' time with 2 seconds remaining on
the clock. The Braves never got
the shot off and the regulation
game ended in a 57-57 tie.
In the second half, the F r os h
j defense held the Brave shooters
I to 19 points and a cool 20 percent
I average, while the Frosh offense
| was clicking for 35 points and a
j fair 11 percent shooting ability.
In the overtime period neither
defense would allow the other
team a shbt, but with 2 minutes
to go the Frosh paid the price of
a pressure defense. They fouled
deadeye Skip Hutchinson who
calmly sank two free throws.
Kent Borchard, with 1 minute
left, made his fifth buckel of the
half to put Ihe Frosh within strik
ing range again.
The Braves began to stall.
With 12 seconds To go the Frosh
fouled Hutchinson in an attempt
to get the ball. He sank both
charity tosses to ice the game for
the Braves.
