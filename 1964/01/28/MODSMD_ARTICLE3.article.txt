# 'Stanford Seen' At Art Gallery
## 
### 
Leo M. Holub, artist, photog
rapher and graphic coordinator in
the Planning Office, will have a
one-man exhibit of his photo
graphs of Stanford in the Univer
sity Art Gallery today through
Feb. 16.
More than 100 photographs will
be displayed under the title,
"Stanford Seen." While the scenes
are all Stanford background,
there is a universal quality in
each. For example, there is one
showing Stanford students en
grossed in a discussion with Peace
Corps Director Sargent Shriver.
While specific, yet, the faces with
their intensity of interest are to
be seen wherever or whenever
students draw together in deep
interest.
Holub's photographic interest
dates from the birth of his first
child 21 years ago when he found
the impulse to buy a camera irre
sistible. A next step was his own
darkroom.
Before coming to work at Stan
ford in the summer of 1960, Holub
worked for various Bay Area de
signers, ad agencies and print
shops, as well as with the San
Francisco Housing Authority, the
Redevelopment Agency and the
Department of City Planning, and
the Kaiser Company in Oakland.
At Stanford, Holub is respon
sible for the graphic materials
used in coordinating the Univer
sity's building plans for the fu
tureâ€”blueprints. sketches, mod
els, posters, charts, linear delina
tion. Stanford's Planning Director
Harry Sanders recently spoke of
his professional stature, "He's a
genius in his profession and in
human relationships. No wonder
he can catch these pictures of
people. Expert in whatever he
floes, lie brings to photography his
great love of people and the result
is art."
