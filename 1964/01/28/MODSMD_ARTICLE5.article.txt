# 'Why Am I a Mormon?' Asks Elder Tanner
## 
### NORM GREENBURG 
Elder Nathan E. Tanner, one
of the three members of the presi
dency of the Mormon Church, de
fended his religion last night as
a clarification attuned to the
"latter days" of the Word of God
on Earth.
Protestantism, he maintained,
arose to correct the malpractices
of the Catholic Church under the
leadership of men not claiming
divine revelation. Joseph Smith,
on the other hand, who founded
the Church of the Latter Day
Saints in the 1820's, did claim di
rect revelation and Divine au
thority: "I saw a pillar of light
which descended upon me. . . ."
Tanner pointed to the prophecies
of Ezekial, Isaiah, Paul, and John
the Revelator of a later day revel
ation. "If the Bible is true, the
Book of Mormons is true," he
said, emphasizing that the two
are complementary. The Book of
Mormon, is a translation of gold
en tablets given to the ancient
inhabitants of America by Christ
and revealed to Smith.
Tanner asks why skeptics re
fuse to accept this latter day
revelation: "Is it because they

I feel that they have no need for
I a phrophet, or that God cannot
reveal Himself; or that God does
not work on Earth today; or that
God does not love people enough
to speak to I hem today?" Tanner
adds, "If Smith's claims are false,
he is the greatest fraud ever to
have lived and his church th e
greatest hoax;" Smith's sincerity
is more a plausible hypothesis to
Elder Tanner.
The doctrine of the M or m a n
Church, which now numbers two
million adherents, includes belief
in the baptism, continuous revela
tion. the existence of Jesus Christ
and God in material bodies, a
priesthood, and celestial mariage
(marital union fulfills the individ
ual). Welfare work, athletics, and
missionary activity are integral
activities of the Church, he ex
plained.
