GOD'S VIEW OF MARRIAGE
In California today half of all marriages end in divorce. In Los Angeles
the fraction is six out ol ten. Those who shrug their shoulders at these
harsh facts may claim that man has freed himself from Victorian moral
codes, and as master of his own destiny, has the right to marry and
divorce as he desires.
From a Christian viewpoint, the liigh divorce rate is a result of man's
turning away from God into sin and selfishness. God's moral laws are un
changing; God has neither evolved nor changed His mind. He lias in
tended that a mail and wife live together lor life, and departure from this
plan is sin in God's sight. Jesus Himself, during 1 lis earthly ministry, pre
sented the Facts of I,ile from God's point of view in unmistakable terms:
"... from the begining of the creation God made theui male and female.
For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his
wife; and they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain,
but one flesh. What God hath joined together let no man put asunder
. . . \\ hosocver shall put away his wife, and marry another, eonnnittcth
adultery against her. And il a woman shall put away her husband, and be
married to another she committeth adultery." Mark 10:6-12.
"But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for
the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery; and whosoever
shall many her that is divorced committeth adultery." Mat. 5:32.
I he Christian marriage is Christ-centered, and the husband is the divine
ly-instituted head of this home:
"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the
church: and lie is the saviour of the body. Therefore, as the church is
subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every
thing. Husbands love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,
and gave himself for it . . . so ought men to love their wives as their own
bodies. lie that loveth his wife loveth himself." Fph. 5:22-2S.
Christians should never marry unbelievers:
"Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then
take the members of Christ and make them members of an harlot? God
forbid, What? Know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one
body? For two, saith he, shall be one flesh . . . Know ye not that your
body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have of
God, and ye arc not your own? For ye are bought with a price, therefore,
glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which arc God's." I Cor.
6: 15-20.
Should a person become a Christian after marriage, it is not necessary
after conversion to depart from the unbelieving partner, but rather, it is
desirable for the sake of the children and the possible conversion of the
partner, to remain married. (I Cor. 7:10-16).
Christian marriages are made in heaven. They rarely fail and usually
are blessed wonderfully with children who become Christians at an early
age Nothing is more wonderful and sacred than a home with Christ at
the center, and nothing more tragic than a family living apart from God.
Becoming a Christian is never a matter of shaping up and putting on good
behaviour, it is always the fresh start of regeneration by the Holy Spirit.
Likewise in Christian marriage it is God who unites man and wife to
make of them "one flesh." Marriages built on any other basis are on
shaky grounds! No wonder they fail!
