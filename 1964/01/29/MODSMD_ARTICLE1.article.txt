# Mrs. Keane Letcures on Art; Speech Interrupted by Rats
## 
### 
Citing the importance of paint
ing as a medium for expression,
artist Margaret Keane addressed
the Associated Women Students
yesterday.
The talk interrupted several
times by disturbances in the au
dience including the release of
eight rats among the liseners.
(See Letter to the Editor, page 2.)
"Most painters," Mrs. Keane
pointed out, "prefer to do their
talking with a paint brush. If I
had any sense I would do the
same. Throughout my life words
have never come easy. Only
through my paintings and draw
ings have I been able to express
my deepest feelings and
thoughts."
MRS. KEANE pointed out that
art is generally acknowledged to
be a man's world. "Those of us
women who dare enter," she
stated, "do so with an awareness
thai the challenge and the com
petition is extremely keen. Yet I
am certain for those of us who
have trespassed, it lias never been
with the intention to compete, but
rather to express." She expressed
the view that art should be more
natural to women than to men.
However, it was pointed out,
women have oftentimes in the
past been too tied down to their
daily chores to engage in th e
arts. Today this is no longer so
true.
Mrs. Keane commented, "To
day, in America, we have enough
lady painters to redaub the Gold
en Gate Bridge twice daily and
four times on Sunday. But
amongst the hundred outstanding
living artists, only a handful are
women."
TIIE SPEAKER outlined brief
ly the careers of several outstand
ing woman artists. She described
Mary Cassett as the first really
outstanding American woman art
ist. 'This artist's sensitive draw
ings of mother and children have
rarely been equaled," she com
mented. Another was the French
painter Suzanne Valadon, "a
powerful and original artist and
a legend in her lifetime." "If we
had to single out any woman who
has in this age achieved the most
recognition in fine art, it would
have to be "The Grand Old Lady
of American Art', " she continued,
referring, of course, to Grandma
Moses.
Turning to the case she knows
best, she began, "Margaret and
Walter Keane were compelled,
driven to trudge down Broadway
in San Francisco's North beach,
lugging a ladder, a gallon can of
wallpaper paste, a staple gun and

a stack of posters advertising the
newly opened Keane gallery . .
"EVERY WEEKEND these two
poor artists made the scene up
and down San Francisco hills glu
ing and tacking these handbills—
sometimes only a block ahead of
a trailing policeman who ob
jected." The Keane posters kept
disappearing, until one day the
snatchers came to the gallery ask
ing for clean editions. II was then
that Walter Keane decided to
charge a small price for his prod
uct. "This," Mrs. Keane stated,
"was the beginning of the Keane
lithograph phenomena."
Mrs. Keane moved then on to
the offerings of art. "'What,'
somebody once asked Gertrude
Stein, Ms your attitude toward
art.' She answered, "I like to
look at it.\ It was Duncan Phil
lips who said, 'The power to see
beautiful is all there is worth
bothering about in art.' "Per
haps," Mrs. Keane proposed, "in
these two simple statements is
the definition of art's most basic
offering for all of us."
DISCUSSING HER WORKS,
the artist came finally to that of
"Dust to Dust." "As you may
have noticed, the girl is not wear
ing a dress. Her body is the con
tinuation of the rich rolling hills
of California that nurtured her.
This painting of a girl, part flesh,
part earth is a way in which 1
have tried to extend art's mes
sage. You have to be taught there
is life and there is death, other
wise how would you know this
tree is alive, the other dead."
Mrs. Keane concluded, 'It (art)
can, as I so devoutly believe,
break through our ignorance and
let us perceive tomorrow's truth
. . . There must be a more posi
tive recognition of the world we
live in."

newly opened Keane gallery . .
"EVERY WEEKEND these two
poor artists made the scene up
and down San Francisco hills glu
ing and tacking these handbills—
sometimes only a block ahead of
a trailing policeman who ob
jected." The Keane posters kept
disappearing, until one day the
snatchers came to the gallery ask
ing for clean editions. II was then
that Walter Keane decided to
charge a small price for his prod
uct. "This," Mrs. Keane stated,
"was the beginning of the Keane
lithograph phenomena."
Mrs. Keane moved then on to
the offerings of art. "'What,'
somebody once asked Gertrude
Stein, Ms your attitude toward
art.' She answered, "I like to
look at it.\ It was Duncan Phil
lips who said, 'The power to see
beautiful is all there is worth
bothering about in art.' "Per
haps," Mrs. Keane proposed, "in
these two simple statements is
the definition of art's most basic
offering for all of us."
DISCUSSING HER WORKS,
the artist came finally to that of
"Dust to Dust." "As you may
have noticed, the girl is not wear
ing a dress. Her body is the con
tinuation of the rich rolling hills
of California that nurtured her.
This painting of a girl, part flesh,
part earth is a way in which 1
have tried to extend art's mes
sage. You have to be taught there
is life and there is death, other
wise how would you know this
tree is alive, the other dead."
Mrs. Keane concluded, 'It (art)
can, as I so devoutly believe,
break through our ignorance and
let us perceive tomorrow's truth
. . . There must be a more posi
tive recognition of the world we
live in."
Citing the importance of paint
ing as a medium for expression,
artist Margaret Keane addressed
the Associated Women Students
yesterday.
The talk interrupted several
times by disturbances in the au
dience including the release of
eight rats among the liseners.
(See Letter to the Editor, page 2.)
"Most painters," Mrs. Keane
pointed out, "prefer to do their
talking with a paint brush. If I
had any sense I would do the
same. Throughout my life words
have never come easy. Only
through my paintings and draw
ings have I been able to express
my deepest feelings and
thoughts."
MRS. KEANE pointed out that
art is generally acknowledged to
be a man's world. "Those of us
women who dare enter," she
stated, "do so with an awareness
thai the challenge and the com
petition is extremely keen. Yet I
am certain for those of us who
have trespassed, it lias never been
with the intention to compete, but
rather to express." She expressed
the view that art should be more
natural to women than to men.
However, it was pointed out,
women have oftentimes in the
past been too tied down to their
daily chores to engage in th e
arts. Today this is no longer so
true.
Mrs. Keane commented, "To
day, in America, we have enough
lady painters to redaub the Gold
en Gate Bridge twice daily and
four times on Sunday. But
amongst the hundred outstanding
living artists, only a handful are
women."
TIIE SPEAKER outlined brief
ly the careers of several outstand
ing woman artists. She described
Mary Cassett as the first really
outstanding American woman art
ist. 'This artist's sensitive draw
ings of mother and children have
rarely been equaled," she com
mented. Another was the French
painter Suzanne Valadon, "a
powerful and original artist and
a legend in her lifetime." "If we
had to single out any woman who
has in this age achieved the most
recognition in fine art, it would
have to be "The Grand Old Lady
of American Art', " she continued,
referring, of course, to Grandma
Moses.
Turning to the case she knows
best, she began, "Margaret and
Walter Keane were compelled,
driven to trudge down Broadway
in San Francisco's North beach,
lugging a ladder, a gallon can of
wallpaper paste, a staple gun and

a stack of posters advertising the
newly opened Keane gallery . .
