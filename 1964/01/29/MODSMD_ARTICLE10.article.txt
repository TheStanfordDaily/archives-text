# Opening Speech by Brooks Attracts Overflow Crowd
## 
### LINDA HESS 
Are Americans really innocent?
That is the question to which Cleanth Brooks, literary critic,
scholar, and professor at Yale University, addressed himself in last
evening's Tuesday Evening Series lecture to an overflow crowd at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Americans have traditionally tended to think that they are young

an d innocent, said Professor-
Brooks, and have tried in various
ways to define how these qualities
distinguish them from Europeans.
OUR "INNOCENCE" shows it
self in our propensity for ideal
ism and in our insistence—almost
as if it were one of those self
evident truths mentioned in the
Declaration of Independence —•
that all problems are soluble.
Brooks proposed to take up
the theme of innocence in three
American novels: Henry James's
The American, F. Scott r!tzg..'r
aid's The Great Gatsby, and V'il
liam Faulkner's Absalom! Ansa
loin! The novels cover a time span
of 60 years and emerge from
three separate regions of the
United States: East, Midwest, and
South.
THE HEROES of all three
novels begin life with nothing and
strike out alone to make their
way in the world. Although their
formal education is limited, all
achieve a high degree of verbal
sophistication through "self-edu
cation in the school of experi
ence." All achieve material suc
cess through their own resource
fulness and determination: but
they are "self-made men" in a
more important sense: they have
created themselves, through 1 he
discipline of striving to fulfill a
dream.
SUTPEN, Faulkner's protagon
ist, is bent on "succeeding" in life
according to a rigid, detailed de
sign. He lives by schedule, acts by
calculation, and expects every
thing to work out as planned
provided the plans are careful
enough: "If you mix up the right
recipe for cakes and pies, then
nothing but pics and cakes can
come out of the oven."
Newman, hero of The Amer
ican, starts out with an obsession
to make money. Achieving that,
he sets himself the task of get
ting a beautiful wife, "the finest
article on the market," as a cul
mination to his career. His motto:
a man can do anything if he has
wit and will, and will try.
ALL THREE men regard real
ity with a vision that could hardly
be termed "realistic." The pres
sures of society cause both
Gatsby and Newman to lose the
women of their dreams; but there
is strong doubt that they would
have been as happy in the realiza
tion as in the anticipation.
Sutpen's "innocence" is an in
ability to understand what sin is:
life is a mechanism which can be
managed if one has the courage
to carry one's plans through.
There are no sins, he affirms,
only mistakes.
IN CONCLUSION the speaker
questioned whether "innocence"
must be considered a wholly neg
ative quality.

"I am perfectly willing to end
this talk on a positive note," he
offered agreeably. He cited \V. B.
Yeats' poem, "A Prayer for My
Daughter," a celebration of a par
ticular kind of innocence. Writing
in the aftermath of World War I,
Yeats looks forward to the do
st ruction that is to come up out
of the "murderous innocence of
the sea," and prays that his
daughter may withstand ii
through a "racial innocence"
not the amoral innocence of na
ture, but a cultivated human in
nocence.
"For how but in custom and
ceremonies are innocence and
beauty born?" Innocence and
beauty are not the chance gilts
of blind and capricious nature,
but arise from the discipline and
refinement of civilization.

ALL THREE men regard real
ity with a vision that could hardly
be termed "realistic." The pres
sures of society cause both
Gatsby and Newman to lose the
women of their dreams; but there
is strong doubt that they would
have been as happy in the realiza
tion as in the anticipation.
Sutpen's "innocence" is an in
ability to understand what sin is:
life is a mechanism which can be
managed if one has the courage
to carry one's plans through.
There are no sins, he affirms,
only mistakes.
IN CONCLUSION the speaker
questioned whether "innocence"
must be considered a wholly neg
ative quality.

"I am perfectly willing to end
this talk on a positive note," he
offered agreeably. He cited \V. B.
Yeats' poem, "A Prayer for My
Daughter," a celebration of a par
ticular kind of innocence. Writing
in the aftermath of World War I,
Yeats looks forward to the do
st ruction that is to come up out
of the "murderous innocence of
the sea," and prays that his
daughter may withstand ii
through a "racial innocence"
not the amoral innocence of na
ture, but a cultivated human in
nocence.
"For how but in custom and
ceremonies are innocence and
beauty born?" Innocence and
beauty are not the chance gilts
of blind and capricious nature,
but arise from the discipline and
refinement of civilization.
Are Americans really innocent?
That is the question to which Cleanth Brooks, literary critic,
scholar, and professor at Yale University, addressed himself in last
evening's Tuesday Evening Series lecture to an overflow crowd at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Americans have traditionally tended to think that they are young

an d innocent, said Professor-
Brooks, and have tried in various
ways to define how these qualities
distinguish them from Europeans.
OUR "INNOCENCE" shows it
self in our propensity for ideal
ism and in our insistence—almost
as if it were one of those self
evident truths mentioned in the
Declaration of Independence —•
that all problems are soluble.
Brooks proposed to take up
the theme of innocence in three
American novels: Henry James's
The American, F. Scott r!tzg..'r
aid's The Great Gatsby, and V'il
liam Faulkner's Absalom! Ansa
loin! The novels cover a time span
of 60 years and emerge from
three separate regions of the
United States: East, Midwest, and
South.
THE HEROES of all three
novels begin life with nothing and
strike out alone to make their
way in the world. Although their
formal education is limited, all
achieve a high degree of verbal
sophistication through "self-edu
cation in the school of experi
ence." All achieve material suc
cess through their own resource
fulness and determination: but
they are "self-made men" in a
more important sense: they have
created themselves, through 1 he
discipline of striving to fulfill a
dream.
SUTPEN, Faulkner's protagon
ist, is bent on "succeeding" in life
according to a rigid, detailed de
sign. He lives by schedule, acts by
calculation, and expects every
thing to work out as planned
provided the plans are careful
enough: "If you mix up the right
recipe for cakes and pies, then
nothing but pics and cakes can
come out of the oven."
Newman, hero of The Amer
ican, starts out with an obsession
to make money. Achieving that,
he sets himself the task of get
ting a beautiful wife, "the finest
article on the market," as a cul
mination to his career. His motto:
a man can do anything if he has
wit and will, and will try.
