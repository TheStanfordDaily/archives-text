# Ex-Stanford Student Describes Tragedy in Louisiana
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Assistant to the Editor 
When he speaks it is there, in his hands, in his eyes, and somehow
you know — that CORE field worker Ed Vickery has seen too much
searing brutality and ugliness in his twenty-six years. You know,
too, that he has just returned from the jails of Louisiana, and that
soon he will go back again, and your questions are embarrassed and
guilty and inadequate. But it doesn't matter. Ed Vickery doesn't
want to talk about himself.
"People are very impressed by the fact that you were beaten,
that you're out on bond, that you were charged with inciting to
anarchy. But the thing to remember is that there are people who
never get out on bond, people who are jailed and never charged,
people who are beaten that you never hear about. . . ."
Vickery continued with increasing intensity, an apparently habit
ual control holding his emotions, possibly his bitterness, in check:
"The people who are truly courageous are those individual
Negroes who, in fear, do go to register, and keep coming back. It
is those sixteen and seventeen year-old children who march, knowing
that physical reprisals will be taken, not only against themselves
but against their families . . . That takes some considerable courage."
FOR OVER SIX months now, Vickery, a man of some consider
able courage himself, has been involved in one of the most brutal,
and least publicized civil rights struggles in the South. In June,
of last year, Vickery, then a junior at Stanford, participated in the
fair-housing sit-in in Sacramento. One month later, he left for the
troubled backlands of Louisiana as one of three whites working with
CORE'S voter registration campaign.
CORE concentrated its efforts on eight parishes in Louisiana's
sixth congressional district. Vickery described the situation facing
The workers in one parish: "In West Feliciana, Louisiana, no Negro
had registered to vote since 1897, . . . and West Feliciana is better
than 72 percent Negro by percentage population. There people
living there in conditions, social and economic, which are perhaps
worse than they were under slavery. And things are getting worse
all the time. . . . You know, one of the first questions they asked us?
'Can women vote too?' — because they had never been told. . . .
'Niggers just don't have the right to vote.' . . ."
There are now eighty-nine Negroes registered to vote in West
Feliciana, but even the most pitiful progress was painfully slow and
difficult in coming. "In August," Vickery recounts, "two courageous
preachers agreed to attempt to register in West Feliciana. One,
Reverend Joseph Carter, was immediately jailed for 'disturbing the
peace'; the other was simply thrown out of the courthouse. Carter,
however, filed suit for damages in federal court, and hope was re
newed. Several months later, the first breakthrough occurred: On
October 17, 1963, Reverend Carter emerged from the St. Francisville
courthouse waving his voter registration certificate. A victory, but
a small one.
With every little success, the climate grow worse. Soon after
Carter's registration, the CORE workers attempted to register a
group of thirty willing Negroes. Vickery recalls, "... as a result,
(here were numerous beatings; . . . hundreds of crosses were burned
by the Klu Klux Klan; . . . people lost their jobs and couldn't even
feed their children."
CORE WAS MET by frustration at every turn. "One place we
trained 230 people to fill out extremely complex voter x'egistration
forms," Vickery commented. "They passed them to our complete
satisfaction, . . . and yet, out of 230 people, only one was registered.
. . . In the Iberville parish it took us three months to register an
additional 300 Negroes to vote, . . . and to get that additional 300,
we had to have more than 2,000 just attempt to register. . . ."
The results of that registration of 300 Negroes, however, reveal
one slim ray of hope in the dark chaos: when the elections were held
two weeks ago, Vickery reported, the state representative was de
feated by fifty votes; the local sheriff (who had only a few years
until retirement) was defeated by twenty-five votes; and the clerk
of the courts by one vote. "The significant thing here," Vickery ex

plains, " is that Iho Negro vote is not the majority in the parish.
. . . Thus, a sufficient number of whites voted with the Negroes to
make the difference."
Even such small gains have a heavy human price attached. The
local police forces have brutality down to a science, and the CORE
worker himself is a constant target. The job has very little romance
involved: "You work seven days a week, 36 hours a day, or at least
it seems that long. . . . You know, we always carry a tooth brush
with us, because you never know when you're going to be arrested.
Once I was arrested while walking down a totally deserted street
on the charge of 'illegal gathering.' . . . And after all, the Southern
police force is the most effieienr in the world. They have the fewest
number of unsolved crimes on record. When a crime is committed,
they simply arrest a Negro — case closed."
Vickery did not dwell on his own privations, but it was apparent
ho had endured much. He mentioned that he was free only on $18,-
000 bond and was due back in Louisiana soon to face trial on some
thirty-five counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor (in
curred during mass demonstrations), many counts of contempt of
court, criminal anarchy, inciting to riot, and a myriad of others
which ho couldn't remember at the moment. He commented, almost
In passing, that during his arrest, he had spent sixty-eight days in
solitary confinement, was beaten, humiliated, and generally abused.
He lost forty pounds during his stay in Louisiana.
CONTINUALLY, VICKERY emphasized that the response of the
Louisiana Negro to the efforts of the CORE workers had been over
whelming. At the same time, as the movement began to gain mo
mentum, the white establishment intensified its opposition ten fold.
However, opposition has tended to expand rather than destroy the
Negroes' enthusiasm. Vickery summarized the situation: "The reac
tion by the white power structure to voter registration has been so
severe that a real movement, going beyond voter's rights, has de
veloped among the Negroes. ... And after all, a Negro in Louisiana
can't try to register to vote without taking up the whole cam
paign. ..."
One of the most forbidding twists the intensified program of white
l-esistence has taken is the resurgence of the Klu Klux Klan. The
Klan, once seemingly dormant, has reorganized in wake of the recent
rights efforts and conducts extensive campaigns of reprisal and
cross-burning after every new demonstration of Negro activism.
Vickery emphasized that increasing violence is unavoidable in this
context.
Moreover. Vickery stressed that the sword of violence is potenti
ally double-edged. He recalled, "Once, the Klan caught a Negro as
he rushed to put out a cross that they were burning on his front
lawn. But instead of beating him, they took him aside and threatened
him with whole-sale violence should he continue his fight. Now, ten
or fifteen years ago, such an act would have had relative success
in intimidating the Negro — but not today. . . . The Negroes reacted
by buying up all the shot-gun shells in the parish. . . . The days in
which you could expect the Negro community to stand idly by while
its men were beaten, emasculated, its women and children raped,
are long gone. . . ."
Vickery concluded, "As far as we are concerned, the crucial ques
tion is whether we can keep the struggle non-violent. . . . We think
we can — but only if we have the resources — and by resources I
simply mean money. As it. is, we have no autos now; we borrow
cars or hitch rides, and money needed for food must often go for
gas. . . . We need voter registration materials. Often we are reduced
to scrounging just for pencils and the like. . . ."
OBVIOUSLY, ALL FINANCIAL and moral support from the
white community must come from outside Louisiana. Vickery and
the others encountered active opposition to even the most bland of
suggestions. He recalled that "... twelve people respectfully sub
mitted a petition calling for the establishment of a bi-racial com
mittee in their area. All twelve were arrested, jailed on $2,000 bond,
on the charge of 'conspiracy to commit public intimidation.' The
officials involved claimed that they were threatened. . . . And this,
after all. is America. . .
In this context, it would seem both incredible and shameful that
the Negro's plight in southestern Louisiana has received virtually
no national publicity. Vickery maintained that he was not bitter,
but his story was filled with the constant, sharpedged reminder:
"So little news gets out here. . . . You know so little." He described
a succession of outrages perpetrated in virtual anonimity: "You
know,"he recalled, "three people were killed across the border in
Mississippi a little while ago. Their bodies were found in their car,
on a deserted road. They were riddled with gun-shot wounds, and
yet, the coroner ruled that death was caused by carbon monoxide
poisoning. . . . The families are too afraid to demand that the bodies
be exhumed. Apparently the three wore planning to ask CORE to
come into their area. . .
Vickery's bitterness began to over-flow when he was asked why
the national news media had failed to publicize the situation in
Louisiana: "No wire service will touch it. You know how it is
'What did you learn in school today, Johnny?' — 'America, the land
of the free, the home of the brave.' . . . Bitter? We're only bitter
that so many people don't see, that so many people tolerate, that
so many people refuse to take a stand. . . . Because, we know there
is no justice in the South. . . ."
FOR THE LOUISIANA Negro, the political processes we take
for granted are precious indeed. Vickery explained, "Their church
centered community results in an extremely democratic ordering
of their lives. Their pastors are all elected democratically . . . They
appreciate the political processes as only those who have suffered
the worst can. . . ." Their patience and fortitude in the face of the
most brutal sort of frustration is virtually incredible: "They go, and
they go again when they fail, and again when they fail, and again
and again. . . . They have an ability to forgive that is probably
Christian in the true sense, and a real lack of hate."
Vickery let there be no doubt as to the extraordinary quality
of this Christian charity, in a society where fear and cruelty'are
commonplace. He spoke with great, inward agitation of the "worst
police brutality I have ever seen." "... small children attempting
to do nothing more than to walk down the sidewalk and pray are
herded like animals with electric cattle prods. Horses are ridden
into the churches. Stained glass windows are smashed by teargas
grenades. . . . And, of course, there are the fire hoses. . . . Ten,
eleven, and twelve year-old children are run down in the streets by
hoses. One evening, the lynch mob — called the police force in Iber
ville, Louisiana — went through house after house, teargassing,
terrorizing, burning crosses. . . ."
And after all this, there came the naive question from the Daily
reporter: "And was all this for no reason?" And Vickery, with only
a trace of a smile, replied, "Well, they were black. . . ."
When he speaks it is there, in his hands, in his eyes, and somehow
you know — that CORE field worker Ed Vickery has seen too much
searing brutality and ugliness in his twenty-six years. You know,
too, that he has just returned from the jails of Louisiana, and that

centered community results in an extremely democratic ordering
of their lives. Their pastors are all elected democratically . . . They
appreciate the political processes as only those who have suffered
the worst can. . . ." Their patience and fortitude in the face of the
most brutal sort of frustration is virtually incredible: "They go, and
they go again when they fail, and again when they fail, and again
and again. . . . They have an ability to forgive that is probably
Christian in the true sense, and a real lack of hate."
Vickery let there be no doubt as to the extraordinary quality
of this Christian charity, in a society where fear and cruelty'are
commonplace. He spoke with great, inward agitation of the "worst
police brutality I have ever seen." "... small children attempting
to do nothing more than to walk down the sidewalk and pray are
herded like animals with electric cattle prods. Horses are ridden
into the churches. Stained glass windows are smashed by teargas
grenades. . . . And, of course, there are the fire hoses. . . . Ten,
eleven, and twelve year-old children are run down in the streets by
hoses. One evening, the lynch mob — called the police force in Iber
ville, Louisiana — went through house after house, teargassing,
terrorizing, burning crosses. . . ."
And after all this, there came the naive question from the Daily
reporter: "And was all this for no reason?" And Vickery, with only
a trace of a smile, replied, "Well, they were black. . . ."
When he speaks it is there, in his hands, in his eyes, and somehow
you know — that CORE field worker Ed Vickery has seen too much
searing brutality and ugliness in his twenty-six years. You know,
too, that he has just returned from the jails of Louisiana, and that
soon he will go back again, and your questions are embarrassed and
guilty and inadequate. But it doesn't matter. Ed Vickery doesn't
want to talk about himself.
"People are very impressed by the fact that you were beaten,
that you're out on bond, that you were charged with inciting to
anarchy. But the thing to remember is that there are people who
never get out on bond, people who are jailed and never charged,
people who are beaten that you never hear about. . . ."
Vickery continued with increasing intensity, an apparently habit
ual control holding his emotions, possibly his bitterness, in check:
"The people who are truly courageous are those individual
Negroes who, in fear, do go to register, and keep coming back. It
is those sixteen and seventeen year-old children who march, knowing
that physical reprisals will be taken, not only against themselves
but against their families . . . That takes some considerable courage."
FOR OVER SIX months now, Vickery, a man of some consider
able courage himself, has been involved in one of the most brutal,
and least publicized civil rights struggles in the South. In June,
of last year, Vickery, then a junior at Stanford, participated in the
fair-housing sit-in in Sacramento. One month later, he left for the
troubled backlands of Louisiana as one of three whites working with
CORE'S voter registration campaign.
CORE concentrated its efforts on eight parishes in Louisiana's
sixth congressional district. Vickery described the situation facing
The workers in one parish: "In West Feliciana, Louisiana, no Negro
had registered to vote since 1897, . . . and West Feliciana is better
than 72 percent Negro by percentage population. There people
living there in conditions, social and economic, which are perhaps
worse than they were under slavery. And things are getting worse
all the time. . . . You know, one of the first questions they asked us?
'Can women vote too?' — because they had never been told. . . .
'Niggers just don't have the right to vote.' . . ."
There are now eighty-nine Negroes registered to vote in West
Feliciana, but even the most pitiful progress was painfully slow and
difficult in coming. "In August," Vickery recounts, "two courageous
preachers agreed to attempt to register in West Feliciana. One,
Reverend Joseph Carter, was immediately jailed for 'disturbing the
peace'; the other was simply thrown out of the courthouse. Carter,
however, filed suit for damages in federal court, and hope was re
newed. Several months later, the first breakthrough occurred: On
October 17, 1963, Reverend Carter emerged from the St. Francisville
courthouse waving his voter registration certificate. A victory, but
a small one.
With every little success, the climate grow worse. Soon after
Carter's registration, the CORE workers attempted to register a
group of thirty willing Negroes. Vickery recalls, "... as a result,
(here were numerous beatings; . . . hundreds of crosses were burned
by the Klu Klux Klan; . . . people lost their jobs and couldn't even
feed their children."
CORE WAS MET by frustration at every turn. "One place we
trained 230 people to fill out extremely complex voter x'egistration
forms," Vickery commented. "They passed them to our complete
satisfaction, . . . and yet, out of 230 people, only one was registered.
. . . In the Iberville parish it took us three months to register an
additional 300 Negroes to vote, . . . and to get that additional 300,
we had to have more than 2,000 just attempt to register. . . ."
The results of that registration of 300 Negroes, however, reveal
one slim ray of hope in the dark chaos: when the elections were held
two weeks ago, Vickery reported, the state representative was de
feated by fifty votes; the local sheriff (who had only a few years
until retirement) was defeated by twenty-five votes; and the clerk
of the courts by one vote. "The significant thing here," Vickery ex

plains, " is that Iho Negro vote is not the majority in the parish.
. . . Thus, a sufficient number of whites voted with the Negroes to
make the difference."
Even such small gains have a heavy human price attached. The
local police forces have brutality down to a science, and the CORE
worker himself is a constant target. The job has very little romance
involved: "You work seven days a week, 36 hours a day, or at least
it seems that long. . . . You know, we always carry a tooth brush
with us, because you never know when you're going to be arrested.
Once I was arrested while walking down a totally deserted street
on the charge of 'illegal gathering.' . . . And after all, the Southern
police force is the most effieienr in the world. They have the fewest
number of unsolved crimes on record. When a crime is committed,
they simply arrest a Negro — case closed."
Vickery did not dwell on his own privations, but it was apparent
ho had endured much. He mentioned that he was free only on $18,-
000 bond and was due back in Louisiana soon to face trial on some
thirty-five counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor (in
curred during mass demonstrations), many counts of contempt of
court, criminal anarchy, inciting to riot, and a myriad of others
which ho couldn't remember at the moment. He commented, almost
In passing, that during his arrest, he had spent sixty-eight days in
solitary confinement, was beaten, humiliated, and generally abused.
He lost forty pounds during his stay in Louisiana.
CONTINUALLY, VICKERY emphasized that the response of the
Louisiana Negro to the efforts of the CORE workers had been over
whelming. At the same time, as the movement began to gain mo
mentum, the white establishment intensified its opposition ten fold.
However, opposition has tended to expand rather than destroy the
Negroes' enthusiasm. Vickery summarized the situation: "The reac
tion by the white power structure to voter registration has been so
severe that a real movement, going beyond voter's rights, has de
veloped among the Negroes. ... And after all, a Negro in Louisiana
can't try to register to vote without taking up the whole cam
paign. ..."
One of the most forbidding twists the intensified program of white
l-esistence has taken is the resurgence of the Klu Klux Klan. The
Klan, once seemingly dormant, has reorganized in wake of the recent
rights efforts and conducts extensive campaigns of reprisal and
cross-burning after every new demonstration of Negro activism.
Vickery emphasized that increasing violence is unavoidable in this
context.
Moreover. Vickery stressed that the sword of violence is potenti
ally double-edged. He recalled, "Once, the Klan caught a Negro as
he rushed to put out a cross that they were burning on his front
lawn. But instead of beating him, they took him aside and threatened
him with whole-sale violence should he continue his fight. Now, ten
or fifteen years ago, such an act would have had relative success
in intimidating the Negro — but not today. . . . The Negroes reacted
by buying up all the shot-gun shells in the parish. . . . The days in
which you could expect the Negro community to stand idly by while
its men were beaten, emasculated, its women and children raped,
are long gone. . . ."
Vickery concluded, "As far as we are concerned, the crucial ques
tion is whether we can keep the struggle non-violent. . . . We think
we can — but only if we have the resources — and by resources I
simply mean money. As it. is, we have no autos now; we borrow
cars or hitch rides, and money needed for food must often go for
gas. . . . We need voter registration materials. Often we are reduced
to scrounging just for pencils and the like. . . ."
OBVIOUSLY, ALL FINANCIAL and moral support from the
white community must come from outside Louisiana. Vickery and
the others encountered active opposition to even the most bland of
suggestions. He recalled that "... twelve people respectfully sub
mitted a petition calling for the establishment of a bi-racial com
mittee in their area. All twelve were arrested, jailed on $2,000 bond,
on the charge of 'conspiracy to commit public intimidation.' The
officials involved claimed that they were threatened. . . . And this,
after all. is America. . .
In this context, it would seem both incredible and shameful that
the Negro's plight in southestern Louisiana has received virtually
no national publicity. Vickery maintained that he was not bitter,
but his story was filled with the constant, sharpedged reminder:
"So little news gets out here. . . . You know so little." He described
a succession of outrages perpetrated in virtual anonimity: "You
know,"he recalled, "three people were killed across the border in
Mississippi a little while ago. Their bodies were found in their car,
on a deserted road. They were riddled with gun-shot wounds, and
yet, the coroner ruled that death was caused by carbon monoxide
poisoning. . . . The families are too afraid to demand that the bodies
be exhumed. Apparently the three wore planning to ask CORE to
come into their area. . .
Vickery's bitterness began to over-flow when he was asked why
the national news media had failed to publicize the situation in
Louisiana: "No wire service will touch it. You know how it is
'What did you learn in school today, Johnny?' — 'America, the land
of the free, the home of the brave.' . . . Bitter? We're only bitter
that so many people don't see, that so many people tolerate, that
so many people refuse to take a stand. . . . Because, we know there
is no justice in the South. . . ."

In this context, it would seem both incredible and shameful that
the Negro's plight in southestern Louisiana has received virtually
no national publicity. Vickery maintained that he was not bitter,
but his story was filled with the constant, sharpedged reminder:
"So little news gets out here. . . . You know so little." He described
a succession of outrages perpetrated in virtual anonimity: "You
know,"he recalled, "three people were killed across the border in
Mississippi a little while ago. Their bodies were found in their car,
on a deserted road. They were riddled with gun-shot wounds, and
yet, the coroner ruled that death was caused by carbon monoxide
poisoning. . . . The families are too afraid to demand that the bodies
be exhumed. Apparently the three wore planning to ask CORE to
come into their area. . .
Vickery's bitterness began to over-flow when he was asked why
the national news media had failed to publicize the situation in
Louisiana: "No wire service will touch it. You know how it is
'What did you learn in school today, Johnny?' — 'America, the land
of the free, the home of the brave.' . . . Bitter? We're only bitter
that so many people don't see, that so many people tolerate, that
so many people refuse to take a stand. . . . Because, we know there
is no justice in the South. . . ."
FOR THE LOUISIANA Negro, the political processes we take
for granted are precious indeed. Vickery explained, "Their church
centered community results in an extremely democratic ordering
of their lives. Their pastors are all elected democratically . . . They
appreciate the political processes as only those who have suffered
the worst can. . . ." Their patience and fortitude in the face of the
most brutal sort of frustration is virtually incredible: "They go, and
they go again when they fail, and again when they fail, and again
and again. . . . They have an ability to forgive that is probably
Christian in the true sense, and a real lack of hate."
Vickery let there be no doubt as to the extraordinary quality
of this Christian charity, in a society where fear and cruelty'are
commonplace. He spoke with great, inward agitation of the "worst
police brutality I have ever seen." "... small children attempting
to do nothing more than to walk down the sidewalk and pray are
herded like animals with electric cattle prods. Horses are ridden
into the churches. Stained glass windows are smashed by teargas
grenades. . . . And, of course, there are the fire hoses. . . . Ten,
eleven, and twelve year-old children are run down in the streets by
hoses. One evening, the lynch mob — called the police force in Iber
ville, Louisiana — went through house after house, teargassing,
terrorizing, burning crosses. . . ."
And after all this, there came the naive question from the Daily
reporter: "And was all this for no reason?" And Vickery, with only
a trace of a smile, replied, "Well, they were black. . . ."
When he speaks it is there, in his hands, in his eyes, and somehow
you know — that CORE field worker Ed Vickery has seen too much
searing brutality and ugliness in his twenty-six years. You know,
too, that he has just returned from the jails of Louisiana, and that
soon he will go back again, and your questions are embarrassed and
guilty and inadequate. But it doesn't matter. Ed Vickery doesn't
want to talk about himself.
"People are very impressed by the fact that you were beaten,
that you're out on bond, that you were charged with inciting to
anarchy. But the thing to remember is that there are people who
never get out on bond, people who are jailed and never charged,
people who are beaten that you never hear about. . . ."
Vickery continued with increasing intensity, an apparently habit
ual control holding his emotions, possibly his bitterness, in check:
"The people who are truly courageous are those individual
Negroes who, in fear, do go to register, and keep coming back. It
is those sixteen and seventeen year-old children who march, knowing
that physical reprisals will be taken, not only against themselves
but against their families . . . That takes some considerable courage."
FOR OVER SIX months now, Vickery, a man of some consider
able courage himself, has been involved in one of the most brutal,
and least publicized civil rights struggles in the South. In June,
of last year, Vickery, then a junior at Stanford, participated in the
fair-housing sit-in in Sacramento. One month later, he left for the
troubled backlands of Louisiana as one of three whites working with
CORE'S voter registration campaign.
CORE concentrated its efforts on eight parishes in Louisiana's
sixth congressional district. Vickery described the situation facing
The workers in one parish: "In West Feliciana, Louisiana, no Negro
had registered to vote since 1897, . . . and West Feliciana is better
than 72 percent Negro by percentage population. There people
living there in conditions, social and economic, which are perhaps
worse than they were under slavery. And things are getting worse
all the time. . . . You know, one of the first questions they asked us?
'Can women vote too?' — because they had never been told. . . .
'Niggers just don't have the right to vote.' . . ."
There are now eighty-nine Negroes registered to vote in West
Feliciana, but even the most pitiful progress was painfully slow and
difficult in coming. "In August," Vickery recounts, "two courageous
preachers agreed to attempt to register in West Feliciana. One,
Reverend Joseph Carter, was immediately jailed for 'disturbing the
peace'; the other was simply thrown out of the courthouse. Carter,
however, filed suit for damages in federal court, and hope was re
newed. Several months later, the first breakthrough occurred: On
October 17, 1963, Reverend Carter emerged from the St. Francisville
courthouse waving his voter registration certificate. A victory, but
a small one.
With every little success, the climate grow worse. Soon after
Carter's registration, the CORE workers attempted to register a
group of thirty willing Negroes. Vickery recalls, "... as a result,
(here were numerous beatings; . . . hundreds of crosses were burned
by the Klu Klux Klan; . . . people lost their jobs and couldn't even
feed their children."
CORE WAS MET by frustration at every turn. "One place we
trained 230 people to fill out extremely complex voter x'egistration
forms," Vickery commented. "They passed them to our complete
satisfaction, . . . and yet, out of 230 people, only one was registered.
. . . In the Iberville parish it took us three months to register an
additional 300 Negroes to vote, . . . and to get that additional 300,
we had to have more than 2,000 just attempt to register. . . ."
The results of that registration of 300 Negroes, however, reveal
one slim ray of hope in the dark chaos: when the elections were held
two weeks ago, Vickery reported, the state representative was de
feated by fifty votes; the local sheriff (who had only a few years
until retirement) was defeated by twenty-five votes; and the clerk
of the courts by one vote. "The significant thing here," Vickery ex

plains, " is that Iho Negro vote is not the majority in the parish.
. . . Thus, a sufficient number of whites voted with the Negroes to
make the difference."
Even such small gains have a heavy human price attached. The
local police forces have brutality down to a science, and the CORE
worker himself is a constant target. The job has very little romance
involved: "You work seven days a week, 36 hours a day, or at least
it seems that long. . . . You know, we always carry a tooth brush
with us, because you never know when you're going to be arrested.
Once I was arrested while walking down a totally deserted street
on the charge of 'illegal gathering.' . . . And after all, the Southern
police force is the most effieienr in the world. They have the fewest
number of unsolved crimes on record. When a crime is committed,
they simply arrest a Negro — case closed."
Vickery did not dwell on his own privations, but it was apparent
ho had endured much. He mentioned that he was free only on $18,-
000 bond and was due back in Louisiana soon to face trial on some
thirty-five counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor (in
curred during mass demonstrations), many counts of contempt of
court, criminal anarchy, inciting to riot, and a myriad of others
which ho couldn't remember at the moment. He commented, almost
In passing, that during his arrest, he had spent sixty-eight days in
solitary confinement, was beaten, humiliated, and generally abused.
He lost forty pounds during his stay in Louisiana.
CONTINUALLY, VICKERY emphasized that the response of the
Louisiana Negro to the efforts of the CORE workers had been over
whelming. At the same time, as the movement began to gain mo
mentum, the white establishment intensified its opposition ten fold.
However, opposition has tended to expand rather than destroy the
Negroes' enthusiasm. Vickery summarized the situation: "The reac
tion by the white power structure to voter registration has been so
severe that a real movement, going beyond voter's rights, has de
veloped among the Negroes. ... And after all, a Negro in Louisiana
can't try to register to vote without taking up the whole cam
paign. ..."
One of the most forbidding twists the intensified program of white
l-esistence has taken is the resurgence of the Klu Klux Klan. The
Klan, once seemingly dormant, has reorganized in wake of the recent
rights efforts and conducts extensive campaigns of reprisal and
cross-burning after every new demonstration of Negro activism.
Vickery emphasized that increasing violence is unavoidable in this
context.
Moreover. Vickery stressed that the sword of violence is potenti
ally double-edged. He recalled, "Once, the Klan caught a Negro as
he rushed to put out a cross that they were burning on his front
lawn. But instead of beating him, they took him aside and threatened
him with whole-sale violence should he continue his fight. Now, ten
or fifteen years ago, such an act would have had relative success
in intimidating the Negro — but not today. . . . The Negroes reacted
by buying up all the shot-gun shells in the parish. . . . The days in
which you could expect the Negro community to stand idly by while
its men were beaten, emasculated, its women and children raped,
are long gone. . . ."
Vickery concluded, "As far as we are concerned, the crucial ques
tion is whether we can keep the struggle non-violent. . . . We think
we can — but only if we have the resources — and by resources I
simply mean money. As it. is, we have no autos now; we borrow
cars or hitch rides, and money needed for food must often go for
gas. . . . We need voter registration materials. Often we are reduced
to scrounging just for pencils and the like. . . ."
OBVIOUSLY, ALL FINANCIAL and moral support from the
white community must come from outside Louisiana. Vickery and
the others encountered active opposition to even the most bland of
suggestions. He recalled that "... twelve people respectfully sub
mitted a petition calling for the establishment of a bi-racial com
mittee in their area. All twelve were arrested, jailed on $2,000 bond,
on the charge of 'conspiracy to commit public intimidation.' The
officials involved claimed that they were threatened. . . . And this,
after all. is America. . .

him with whole-sale violence should he continue his fight. Now, ten
or fifteen years ago, such an act would have had relative success
in intimidating the Negro — but not today. . . . The Negroes reacted
by buying up all the shot-gun shells in the parish. . . . The days in
which you could expect the Negro community to stand idly by while
its men were beaten, emasculated, its women and children raped,
are long gone. . . ."
Vickery concluded, "As far as we are concerned, the crucial ques
tion is whether we can keep the struggle non-violent. . . . We think
we can — but only if we have the resources — and by resources I
simply mean money. As it. is, we have no autos now; we borrow
cars or hitch rides, and money needed for food must often go for
gas. . . . We need voter registration materials. Often we are reduced
to scrounging just for pencils and the like. . . ."
OBVIOUSLY, ALL FINANCIAL and moral support from the
white community must come from outside Louisiana. Vickery and
the others encountered active opposition to even the most bland of
suggestions. He recalled that "... twelve people respectfully sub
mitted a petition calling for the establishment of a bi-racial com
mittee in their area. All twelve were arrested, jailed on $2,000 bond,
on the charge of 'conspiracy to commit public intimidation.' The
officials involved claimed that they were threatened. . . . And this,
after all. is America. . .
In this context, it would seem both incredible and shameful that
the Negro's plight in southestern Louisiana has received virtually
no national publicity. Vickery maintained that he was not bitter,
but his story was filled with the constant, sharpedged reminder:
"So little news gets out here. . . . You know so little." He described
a succession of outrages perpetrated in virtual anonimity: "You
know,"he recalled, "three people were killed across the border in
Mississippi a little while ago. Their bodies were found in their car,
on a deserted road. They were riddled with gun-shot wounds, and
yet, the coroner ruled that death was caused by carbon monoxide
poisoning. . . . The families are too afraid to demand that the bodies
be exhumed. Apparently the three wore planning to ask CORE to
come into their area. . .
Vickery's bitterness began to over-flow when he was asked why
the national news media had failed to publicize the situation in
Louisiana: "No wire service will touch it. You know how it is
'What did you learn in school today, Johnny?' — 'America, the land
of the free, the home of the brave.' . . . Bitter? We're only bitter
that so many people don't see, that so many people tolerate, that
so many people refuse to take a stand. . . . Because, we know there
is no justice in the South. . . ."
FOR THE LOUISIANA Negro, the political processes we take
for granted are precious indeed. Vickery explained, "Their church
centered community results in an extremely democratic ordering
of their lives. Their pastors are all elected democratically . . . They
appreciate the political processes as only those who have suffered
the worst can. . . ." Their patience and fortitude in the face of the
most brutal sort of frustration is virtually incredible: "They go, and
they go again when they fail, and again when they fail, and again
and again. . . . They have an ability to forgive that is probably
Christian in the true sense, and a real lack of hate."
Vickery let there be no doubt as to the extraordinary quality
of this Christian charity, in a society where fear and cruelty'are
commonplace. He spoke with great, inward agitation of the "worst
police brutality I have ever seen." "... small children attempting
to do nothing more than to walk down the sidewalk and pray are
herded like animals with electric cattle prods. Horses are ridden
into the churches. Stained glass windows are smashed by teargas
grenades. . . . And, of course, there are the fire hoses. . . . Ten,
eleven, and twelve year-old children are run down in the streets by
hoses. One evening, the lynch mob — called the police force in Iber
ville, Louisiana — went through house after house, teargassing,
terrorizing, burning crosses. . . ."
And after all this, there came the naive question from the Daily
reporter: "And was all this for no reason?" And Vickery, with only
a trace of a smile, replied, "Well, they were black. . . ."
When he speaks it is there, in his hands, in his eyes, and somehow
you know — that CORE field worker Ed Vickery has seen too much
searing brutality and ugliness in his twenty-six years. You know,
too, that he has just returned from the jails of Louisiana, and that
soon he will go back again, and your questions are embarrassed and
guilty and inadequate. But it doesn't matter. Ed Vickery doesn't
want to talk about himself.
"People are very impressed by the fact that you were beaten,
that you're out on bond, that you were charged with inciting to
anarchy. But the thing to remember is that there are people who
never get out on bond, people who are jailed and never charged,
people who are beaten that you never hear about. . . ."
Vickery continued with increasing intensity, an apparently habit
ual control holding his emotions, possibly his bitterness, in check:
"The people who are truly courageous are those individual
Negroes who, in fear, do go to register, and keep coming back. It
is those sixteen and seventeen year-old children who march, knowing
that physical reprisals will be taken, not only against themselves
but against their families . . . That takes some considerable courage."
FOR OVER SIX months now, Vickery, a man of some consider
able courage himself, has been involved in one of the most brutal,
and least publicized civil rights struggles in the South. In June,
of last year, Vickery, then a junior at Stanford, participated in the
fair-housing sit-in in Sacramento. One month later, he left for the
troubled backlands of Louisiana as one of three whites working with
CORE'S voter registration campaign.
CORE concentrated its efforts on eight parishes in Louisiana's
sixth congressional district. Vickery described the situation facing
The workers in one parish: "In West Feliciana, Louisiana, no Negro
had registered to vote since 1897, . . . and West Feliciana is better
than 72 percent Negro by percentage population. There people
living there in conditions, social and economic, which are perhaps
worse than they were under slavery. And things are getting worse
all the time. . . . You know, one of the first questions they asked us?
'Can women vote too?' — because they had never been told. . . .
'Niggers just don't have the right to vote.' . . ."
There are now eighty-nine Negroes registered to vote in West
Feliciana, but even the most pitiful progress was painfully slow and
difficult in coming. "In August," Vickery recounts, "two courageous
preachers agreed to attempt to register in West Feliciana. One,
Reverend Joseph Carter, was immediately jailed for 'disturbing the
peace'; the other was simply thrown out of the courthouse. Carter,
however, filed suit for damages in federal court, and hope was re
newed. Several months later, the first breakthrough occurred: On
October 17, 1963, Reverend Carter emerged from the St. Francisville
courthouse waving his voter registration certificate. A victory, but
a small one.
With every little success, the climate grow worse. Soon after
Carter's registration, the CORE workers attempted to register a
group of thirty willing Negroes. Vickery recalls, "... as a result,
(here were numerous beatings; . . . hundreds of crosses were burned
by the Klu Klux Klan; . . . people lost their jobs and couldn't even
feed their children."
CORE WAS MET by frustration at every turn. "One place we
trained 230 people to fill out extremely complex voter x'egistration
forms," Vickery commented. "They passed them to our complete
satisfaction, . . . and yet, out of 230 people, only one was registered.
. . . In the Iberville parish it took us three months to register an
additional 300 Negroes to vote, . . . and to get that additional 300,
we had to have more than 2,000 just attempt to register. . . ."
The results of that registration of 300 Negroes, however, reveal
one slim ray of hope in the dark chaos: when the elections were held
two weeks ago, Vickery reported, the state representative was de
feated by fifty votes; the local sheriff (who had only a few years
until retirement) was defeated by twenty-five votes; and the clerk
of the courts by one vote. "The significant thing here," Vickery ex

plains, " is that Iho Negro vote is not the majority in the parish.
. . . Thus, a sufficient number of whites voted with the Negroes to
make the difference."
Even such small gains have a heavy human price attached. The
local police forces have brutality down to a science, and the CORE
worker himself is a constant target. The job has very little romance
involved: "You work seven days a week, 36 hours a day, or at least
it seems that long. . . . You know, we always carry a tooth brush
with us, because you never know when you're going to be arrested.
Once I was arrested while walking down a totally deserted street
on the charge of 'illegal gathering.' . . . And after all, the Southern
police force is the most effieienr in the world. They have the fewest
number of unsolved crimes on record. When a crime is committed,
they simply arrest a Negro — case closed."
Vickery did not dwell on his own privations, but it was apparent
ho had endured much. He mentioned that he was free only on $18,-
000 bond and was due back in Louisiana soon to face trial on some
thirty-five counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor (in
curred during mass demonstrations), many counts of contempt of
court, criminal anarchy, inciting to riot, and a myriad of others
which ho couldn't remember at the moment. He commented, almost
In passing, that during his arrest, he had spent sixty-eight days in
solitary confinement, was beaten, humiliated, and generally abused.
He lost forty pounds during his stay in Louisiana.
CONTINUALLY, VICKERY emphasized that the response of the
Louisiana Negro to the efforts of the CORE workers had been over
whelming. At the same time, as the movement began to gain mo
mentum, the white establishment intensified its opposition ten fold.
However, opposition has tended to expand rather than destroy the
Negroes' enthusiasm. Vickery summarized the situation: "The reac
tion by the white power structure to voter registration has been so
severe that a real movement, going beyond voter's rights, has de
veloped among the Negroes. ... And after all, a Negro in Louisiana
can't try to register to vote without taking up the whole cam
paign. ..."
One of the most forbidding twists the intensified program of white
l-esistence has taken is the resurgence of the Klu Klux Klan. The
Klan, once seemingly dormant, has reorganized in wake of the recent
rights efforts and conducts extensive campaigns of reprisal and
cross-burning after every new demonstration of Negro activism.
Vickery emphasized that increasing violence is unavoidable in this
context.
Moreover. Vickery stressed that the sword of violence is potenti
ally double-edged. He recalled, "Once, the Klan caught a Negro as
he rushed to put out a cross that they were burning on his front
lawn. But instead of beating him, they took him aside and threatened
him with whole-sale violence should he continue his fight. Now, ten
or fifteen years ago, such an act would have had relative success

which ho couldn't remember at the moment. He commented, almost
In passing, that during his arrest, he had spent sixty-eight days in
solitary confinement, was beaten, humiliated, and generally abused.
He lost forty pounds during his stay in Louisiana.
CONTINUALLY, VICKERY emphasized that the response of the
Louisiana Negro to the efforts of the CORE workers had been over
whelming. At the same time, as the movement began to gain mo
mentum, the white establishment intensified its opposition ten fold.
However, opposition has tended to expand rather than destroy the
Negroes' enthusiasm. Vickery summarized the situation: "The reac
tion by the white power structure to voter registration has been so
severe that a real movement, going beyond voter's rights, has de
veloped among the Negroes. ... And after all, a Negro in Louisiana
can't try to register to vote without taking up the whole cam
paign. ..."
One of the most forbidding twists the intensified program of white
l-esistence has taken is the resurgence of the Klu Klux Klan. The
Klan, once seemingly dormant, has reorganized in wake of the recent
rights efforts and conducts extensive campaigns of reprisal and
cross-burning after every new demonstration of Negro activism.
Vickery emphasized that increasing violence is unavoidable in this
context.
Moreover. Vickery stressed that the sword of violence is potenti
ally double-edged. He recalled, "Once, the Klan caught a Negro as
he rushed to put out a cross that they were burning on his front
lawn. But instead of beating him, they took him aside and threatened
him with whole-sale violence should he continue his fight. Now, ten
or fifteen years ago, such an act would have had relative success
in intimidating the Negro — but not today. . . . The Negroes reacted
by buying up all the shot-gun shells in the parish. . . . The days in
which you could expect the Negro community to stand idly by while
its men were beaten, emasculated, its women and children raped,
are long gone. . . ."
Vickery concluded, "As far as we are concerned, the crucial ques
tion is whether we can keep the struggle non-violent. . . . We think
we can — but only if we have the resources — and by resources I
simply mean money. As it. is, we have no autos now; we borrow
cars or hitch rides, and money needed for food must often go for
gas. . . . We need voter registration materials. Often we are reduced
to scrounging just for pencils and the like. . . ."
OBVIOUSLY, ALL FINANCIAL and moral support from the
white community must come from outside Louisiana. Vickery and
the others encountered active opposition to even the most bland of
suggestions. He recalled that "... twelve people respectfully sub
mitted a petition calling for the establishment of a bi-racial com
mittee in their area. All twelve were arrested, jailed on $2,000 bond,
on the charge of 'conspiracy to commit public intimidation.' The
officials involved claimed that they were threatened. . . . And this,
after all. is America. . .
In this context, it would seem both incredible and shameful that
the Negro's plight in southestern Louisiana has received virtually
no national publicity. Vickery maintained that he was not bitter,
but his story was filled with the constant, sharpedged reminder:
"So little news gets out here. . . . You know so little." He described
a succession of outrages perpetrated in virtual anonimity: "You
know,"he recalled, "three people were killed across the border in
Mississippi a little while ago. Their bodies were found in their car,
on a deserted road. They were riddled with gun-shot wounds, and
yet, the coroner ruled that death was caused by carbon monoxide
poisoning. . . . The families are too afraid to demand that the bodies
be exhumed. Apparently the three wore planning to ask CORE to
come into their area. . .
Vickery's bitterness began to over-flow when he was asked why
the national news media had failed to publicize the situation in
Louisiana: "No wire service will touch it. You know how it is
'What did you learn in school today, Johnny?' — 'America, the land
of the free, the home of the brave.' . . . Bitter? We're only bitter
that so many people don't see, that so many people tolerate, that
so many people refuse to take a stand. . . . Because, we know there
is no justice in the South. . . ."
FOR THE LOUISIANA Negro, the political processes we take
for granted are precious indeed. Vickery explained, "Their church
centered community results in an extremely democratic ordering
of their lives. Their pastors are all elected democratically . . . They
appreciate the political processes as only those who have suffered
the worst can. . . ." Their patience and fortitude in the face of the
most brutal sort of frustration is virtually incredible: "They go, and
they go again when they fail, and again when they fail, and again
and again. . . . They have an ability to forgive that is probably
Christian in the true sense, and a real lack of hate."
Vickery let there be no doubt as to the extraordinary quality
of this Christian charity, in a society where fear and cruelty'are
commonplace. He spoke with great, inward agitation of the "worst
police brutality I have ever seen." "... small children attempting
to do nothing more than to walk down the sidewalk and pray are
herded like animals with electric cattle prods. Horses are ridden
into the churches. Stained glass windows are smashed by teargas
grenades. . . . And, of course, there are the fire hoses. . . . Ten,
eleven, and twelve year-old children are run down in the streets by
hoses. One evening, the lynch mob — called the police force in Iber
ville, Louisiana — went through house after house, teargassing,
terrorizing, burning crosses. . . ."
And after all this, there came the naive question from the Daily
reporter: "And was all this for no reason?" And Vickery, with only
a trace of a smile, replied, "Well, they were black. . . ."
When he speaks it is there, in his hands, in his eyes, and somehow
you know — that CORE field worker Ed Vickery has seen too much
searing brutality and ugliness in his twenty-six years. You know,
too, that he has just returned from the jails of Louisiana, and that
soon he will go back again, and your questions are embarrassed and
guilty and inadequate. But it doesn't matter. Ed Vickery doesn't
want to talk about himself.
"People are very impressed by the fact that you were beaten,
that you're out on bond, that you were charged with inciting to
anarchy. But the thing to remember is that there are people who
never get out on bond, people who are jailed and never charged,
people who are beaten that you never hear about. . . ."
Vickery continued with increasing intensity, an apparently habit
ual control holding his emotions, possibly his bitterness, in check:
"The people who are truly courageous are those individual
Negroes who, in fear, do go to register, and keep coming back. It
is those sixteen and seventeen year-old children who march, knowing
that physical reprisals will be taken, not only against themselves
but against their families . . . That takes some considerable courage."
FOR OVER SIX months now, Vickery, a man of some consider
able courage himself, has been involved in one of the most brutal,
and least publicized civil rights struggles in the South. In June,
of last year, Vickery, then a junior at Stanford, participated in the
fair-housing sit-in in Sacramento. One month later, he left for the
troubled backlands of Louisiana as one of three whites working with
CORE'S voter registration campaign.
CORE concentrated its efforts on eight parishes in Louisiana's
sixth congressional district. Vickery described the situation facing
The workers in one parish: "In West Feliciana, Louisiana, no Negro
had registered to vote since 1897, . . . and West Feliciana is better
than 72 percent Negro by percentage population. There people
living there in conditions, social and economic, which are perhaps
worse than they were under slavery. And things are getting worse
all the time. . . . You know, one of the first questions they asked us?
'Can women vote too?' — because they had never been told. . . .
'Niggers just don't have the right to vote.' . . ."
There are now eighty-nine Negroes registered to vote in West
Feliciana, but even the most pitiful progress was painfully slow and
difficult in coming. "In August," Vickery recounts, "two courageous
preachers agreed to attempt to register in West Feliciana. One,
Reverend Joseph Carter, was immediately jailed for 'disturbing the
peace'; the other was simply thrown out of the courthouse. Carter,
however, filed suit for damages in federal court, and hope was re
newed. Several months later, the first breakthrough occurred: On
October 17, 1963, Reverend Carter emerged from the St. Francisville
courthouse waving his voter registration certificate. A victory, but
a small one.
With every little success, the climate grow worse. Soon after
Carter's registration, the CORE workers attempted to register a
group of thirty willing Negroes. Vickery recalls, "... as a result,
(here were numerous beatings; . . . hundreds of crosses were burned
by the Klu Klux Klan; . . . people lost their jobs and couldn't even
feed their children."
CORE WAS MET by frustration at every turn. "One place we
trained 230 people to fill out extremely complex voter x'egistration
forms," Vickery commented. "They passed them to our complete
satisfaction, . . . and yet, out of 230 people, only one was registered.
. . . In the Iberville parish it took us three months to register an
additional 300 Negroes to vote, . . . and to get that additional 300,
we had to have more than 2,000 just attempt to register. . . ."
The results of that registration of 300 Negroes, however, reveal
one slim ray of hope in the dark chaos: when the elections were held
two weeks ago, Vickery reported, the state representative was de
feated by fifty votes; the local sheriff (who had only a few years
until retirement) was defeated by twenty-five votes; and the clerk
of the courts by one vote. "The significant thing here," Vickery ex

plains, " is that Iho Negro vote is not the majority in the parish.
. . . Thus, a sufficient number of whites voted with the Negroes to
make the difference."
Even such small gains have a heavy human price attached. The
local police forces have brutality down to a science, and the CORE
worker himself is a constant target. The job has very little romance
involved: "You work seven days a week, 36 hours a day, or at least
it seems that long. . . . You know, we always carry a tooth brush
with us, because you never know when you're going to be arrested.
Once I was arrested while walking down a totally deserted street
on the charge of 'illegal gathering.' . . . And after all, the Southern
police force is the most effieienr in the world. They have the fewest
number of unsolved crimes on record. When a crime is committed,
they simply arrest a Negro — case closed."
Vickery did not dwell on his own privations, but it was apparent
ho had endured much. He mentioned that he was free only on $18,-
000 bond and was due back in Louisiana soon to face trial on some
thirty-five counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor (in
curred during mass demonstrations), many counts of contempt of
court, criminal anarchy, inciting to riot, and a myriad of others
which ho couldn't remember at the moment. He commented, almost
In passing, that during his arrest, he had spent sixty-eight days in
solitary confinement, was beaten, humiliated, and generally abused.

until retirement) was defeated by twenty-five votes; and the clerk
of the courts by one vote. "The significant thing here," Vickery ex

plains, " is that Iho Negro vote is not the majority in the parish.
. . . Thus, a sufficient number of whites voted with the Negroes to
make the difference."
Even such small gains have a heavy human price attached. The
local police forces have brutality down to a science, and the CORE
worker himself is a constant target. The job has very little romance
involved: "You work seven days a week, 36 hours a day, or at least
it seems that long. . . . You know, we always carry a tooth brush
with us, because you never know when you're going to be arrested.
Once I was arrested while walking down a totally deserted street
on the charge of 'illegal gathering.' . . . And after all, the Southern
police force is the most effieienr in the world. They have the fewest
number of unsolved crimes on record. When a crime is committed,
they simply arrest a Negro — case closed."
Vickery did not dwell on his own privations, but it was apparent
ho had endured much. He mentioned that he was free only on $18,-
000 bond and was due back in Louisiana soon to face trial on some
thirty-five counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor (in
curred during mass demonstrations), many counts of contempt of
court, criminal anarchy, inciting to riot, and a myriad of others
which ho couldn't remember at the moment. He commented, almost
In passing, that during his arrest, he had spent sixty-eight days in
solitary confinement, was beaten, humiliated, and generally abused.
He lost forty pounds during his stay in Louisiana.
CONTINUALLY, VICKERY emphasized that the response of the
Louisiana Negro to the efforts of the CORE workers had been over
whelming. At the same time, as the movement began to gain mo
mentum, the white establishment intensified its opposition ten fold.
However, opposition has tended to expand rather than destroy the
Negroes' enthusiasm. Vickery summarized the situation: "The reac
tion by the white power structure to voter registration has been so
severe that a real movement, going beyond voter's rights, has de
veloped among the Negroes. ... And after all, a Negro in Louisiana
can't try to register to vote without taking up the whole cam
paign. ..."
One of the most forbidding twists the intensified program of white
l-esistence has taken is the resurgence of the Klu Klux Klan. The
Klan, once seemingly dormant, has reorganized in wake of the recent
rights efforts and conducts extensive campaigns of reprisal and
cross-burning after every new demonstration of Negro activism.
Vickery emphasized that increasing violence is unavoidable in this
context.
Moreover. Vickery stressed that the sword of violence is potenti
ally double-edged. He recalled, "Once, the Klan caught a Negro as
he rushed to put out a cross that they were burning on his front
lawn. But instead of beating him, they took him aside and threatened
him with whole-sale violence should he continue his fight. Now, ten
or fifteen years ago, such an act would have had relative success
in intimidating the Negro — but not today. . . . The Negroes reacted
by buying up all the shot-gun shells in the parish. . . . The days in
which you could expect the Negro community to stand idly by while
its men were beaten, emasculated, its women and children raped,
are long gone. . . ."
Vickery concluded, "As far as we are concerned, the crucial ques
tion is whether we can keep the struggle non-violent. . . . We think
we can — but only if we have the resources — and by resources I
simply mean money. As it. is, we have no autos now; we borrow
cars or hitch rides, and money needed for food must often go for
gas. . . . We need voter registration materials. Often we are reduced
to scrounging just for pencils and the like. . . ."
OBVIOUSLY, ALL FINANCIAL and moral support from the
white community must come from outside Louisiana. Vickery and
the others encountered active opposition to even the most bland of
suggestions. He recalled that "... twelve people respectfully sub
mitted a petition calling for the establishment of a bi-racial com
mittee in their area. All twelve were arrested, jailed on $2,000 bond,
on the charge of 'conspiracy to commit public intimidation.' The
officials involved claimed that they were threatened. . . . And this,
after all. is America. . .
In this context, it would seem both incredible and shameful that
the Negro's plight in southestern Louisiana has received virtually
no national publicity. Vickery maintained that he was not bitter,
but his story was filled with the constant, sharpedged reminder:
"So little news gets out here. . . . You know so little." He described
a succession of outrages perpetrated in virtual anonimity: "You
know,"he recalled, "three people were killed across the border in
Mississippi a little while ago. Their bodies were found in their car,
on a deserted road. They were riddled with gun-shot wounds, and
yet, the coroner ruled that death was caused by carbon monoxide
poisoning. . . . The families are too afraid to demand that the bodies
be exhumed. Apparently the three wore planning to ask CORE to
come into their area. . .
Vickery's bitterness began to over-flow when he was asked why
the national news media had failed to publicize the situation in
Louisiana: "No wire service will touch it. You know how it is
'What did you learn in school today, Johnny?' — 'America, the land
of the free, the home of the brave.' . . . Bitter? We're only bitter
that so many people don't see, that so many people tolerate, that
so many people refuse to take a stand. . . . Because, we know there
is no justice in the South. . . ."
FOR THE LOUISIANA Negro, the political processes we take
for granted are precious indeed. Vickery explained, "Their church
centered community results in an extremely democratic ordering
of their lives. Their pastors are all elected democratically . . . They
appreciate the political processes as only those who have suffered
the worst can. . . ." Their patience and fortitude in the face of the
most brutal sort of frustration is virtually incredible: "They go, and
they go again when they fail, and again when they fail, and again
and again. . . . They have an ability to forgive that is probably
Christian in the true sense, and a real lack of hate."
Vickery let there be no doubt as to the extraordinary quality
of this Christian charity, in a society where fear and cruelty'are
commonplace. He spoke with great, inward agitation of the "worst
police brutality I have ever seen." "... small children attempting
to do nothing more than to walk down the sidewalk and pray are
herded like animals with electric cattle prods. Horses are ridden
into the churches. Stained glass windows are smashed by teargas
grenades. . . . And, of course, there are the fire hoses. . . . Ten,
eleven, and twelve year-old children are run down in the streets by
hoses. One evening, the lynch mob — called the police force in Iber
ville, Louisiana — went through house after house, teargassing,
terrorizing, burning crosses. . . ."
And after all this, there came the naive question from the Daily
reporter: "And was all this for no reason?" And Vickery, with only
a trace of a smile, replied, "Well, they were black. . . ."
