STANFORD BIOLOGY
Editor .The Daily:
To those of us who hope to see
a world free from the threat of
war, biologist R. 11. Smith's crude
arguments in the January 27
Daily possess an obnoxious qual
ity indeed. Apart from the ex
treme arrogance and self
righteous tenor of his assertions
the biologist's arguments demon
strate a vulgar patriotic senti
mentalism coupled with a mani
fest absence of human values.
For example, the biologist pr o
claims: "There are others who
envy what we have . . . And as
long as nations exist which
threaten our way of life and what
we stand for, we cannot rest
unarmed." But is this paranoid
and tribalistic attitude the best
way to cope with a world whose
many subdued peoples are striv
ing to achieve the full and mean
ingful life which is due them,
as us, as human beings?
The biologist's central argu
ment — that war (though "hell"
as he so magnanimously admits)
is just and inevitable — amounts
to a glorification of military con
quest as the instrument of human
progress. (After all, wasn't that
most perfect of all societies.
American democracy, born out of
the tooth and claw struggle of
man against man, nation against
nation?) In other words, out of
bloodshed, rapine, and crime (for
that is what war is) are to come
mankind's highest values! Such
crude moral pathos might con
ceivably had had some persuasive
force in the era of Darwin, Treit
schke, or Admiral Mahan, but to
day, with the chastising experi
ence of two world wars and the
dreadful fear of a third, none but
the utterly foolish or insensate
could entertain such pernicious
doctrines.
Yet by far the most deplorable
facet of the biologist's smug little
tirade against the pacifists is the
image of man which he holds up
for emulation: "As long as one
human being has something that
another hasn't, or that another
wants, and that will be as long
as Ihere are two or more people
on the earth, these so-called 'high
er organisms' arc going to devise
ways and means of taking what
they want away from one an
other." But whom does this argu
ment convince? It only reveals
the ugly ethical nihilism lurking
behind the biologist's tawdry
phrases about "fredom" and
"democracy." It reveals only his
own perverted conviction that the
end justifies the means, that force
is the rightful arbiter in all dis
putes, and that man — that 'high
er organism' as Biology sees him
- is nothing more than a boast
with a will to power.
Yet against this biologist Smith
I would argue with the phychia
trist Viktor Frankl that nihilism
has too long held up to our eyes
this grotesque and distorted im
age of man. The effect has been
for man to view himself as

"nothing but" the product of his
heredity and environment (his
"blood and soil") and his beastly
instincts. In this image, man,
viewing himself as a beast, be
eomes a beast, and respect for
the inviolable sanctity of human
life evaporates into thin air.
The great relevance of pacifism
to our age is that it confirms the
innate worth of man as a morally
responsible agent in the world.
Man is not the tool of heredity
and environment or of those "vast
impersonal forces" of the uni
verse, but is fre, within limits, to
create for himself a better world,
even if he will never see the City
of God descend to this mortal
dust.
Peace, moreover, is not a wild
dream or a pathological hallucina
tion, but a concrete ideal which
mankind can approach only in
striving each day to realize it. To
have peace, we must first want it.
We must believe man is capable
of it. Then we must work for it.
By peace I do not mean Utopia,
but that which man can achieve
through world law. This, if you
will, is not idealism. It is realism
—the kind which Goethe meant
when he said : "When we take
man as he is, we make him worse;
but when we take man as if he
were already what he should be,
we promote him to what he can
be."

KEANE LECTURE
Editor, the Daily:
Margaret Keane's lecture
yesterday on the role of the ed
ucated woman in a career in art
was interrupted several times by
disturbances in the audience.
Soon after Mrs. Keane began
speaking, rats were dispersed
throughout the audience. Con
cerning these disturbances,
Michael Moore of the Art Dept.
has these words to say:
"Amusing as the hurling of in
nocent rats into a lecture room
full of women may be, it results
at best in mere chaos, and accom
plishes little as a protestation
against the speaker. In realization
of this and the inhospitable air
created by the rat incident and
other minor disturbances at Mar
garet Keane's lecture, I would
like, as the organizer of these
minor infamies, to apologize for
them. Such acts accomplish little
and lend a bad odor to their mo
tivitation, however just.
"I would also like to apologize
to Fred Nelson for my insulting
behavior at the close of the lec
ture."
The motivation to which Mr.
Moore was referring was the
widespread feeling among those
who are educated in art that "art"
possessing such definite evidence
of commerciality as Mrs. Keane's
work should not be represented
as sincere fine art. There is more
to art than what is on Mrs,
Keane's canvas and there should
l)e wide recognition of this fact.

"blood and soil") and his beastly
instincts. In this image, man,
viewing himself as a beast, be
eomes a beast, and respect for
the inviolable sanctity of human
life evaporates into thin air.
The great relevance of pacifism
to our age is that it confirms the
innate worth of man as a morally
responsible agent in the world.
Man is not the tool of heredity
and environment or of those "vast
impersonal forces" of the uni
verse, but is fre, within limits, to
create for himself a better world,
even if he will never see the City
of God descend to this mortal
dust.
Peace, moreover, is not a wild
dream or a pathological hallucina
tion, but a concrete ideal which
mankind can approach only in
striving each day to realize it. To
have peace, we must first want it.
We must believe man is capable
of it. Then we must work for it.
By peace I do not mean Utopia,
but that which man can achieve
through world law. This, if you
will, is not idealism. It is realism
—the kind which Goethe meant
when he said : "When we take
man as he is, we make him worse;
but when we take man as if he
were already what he should be,
we promote him to what he can
be."

KEANE LECTURE
Editor, the Daily:
Margaret Keane's lecture
yesterday on the role of the ed
ucated woman in a career in art
was interrupted several times by
disturbances in the audience.
Soon after Mrs. Keane began
speaking, rats were dispersed
throughout the audience. Con
cerning these disturbances,
Michael Moore of the Art Dept.
has these words to say:
"Amusing as the hurling of in
nocent rats into a lecture room
full of women may be, it results
at best in mere chaos, and accom
plishes little as a protestation
against the speaker. In realization
of this and the inhospitable air
created by the rat incident and
other minor disturbances at Mar
garet Keane's lecture, I would
like, as the organizer of these
minor infamies, to apologize for
them. Such acts accomplish little
and lend a bad odor to their mo
tivitation, however just.
"I would also like to apologize
to Fred Nelson for my insulting
behavior at the close of the lec
ture."
The motivation to which Mr.
Moore was referring was the
widespread feeling among those
who are educated in art that "art"
possessing such definite evidence
of commerciality as Mrs. Keane's
work should not be represented
as sincere fine art. There is more
to art than what is on Mrs,
Keane's canvas and there should
l)e wide recognition of this fact.

To those of us who hope to see
a world free from the threat of
war, biologist R. 11. Smith's crude
arguments in the January 27
Daily possess an obnoxious qual
ity indeed. Apart from the ex
treme arrogance and self
righteous tenor of his assertions
the biologist's arguments demon
strate a vulgar patriotic senti
mentalism coupled with a mani
fest absence of human values.
For example, the biologist pr o
claims: "There are others who
envy what we have . . . And as
long as nations exist which
threaten our way of life and what
we stand for, we cannot rest
unarmed." But is this paranoid
and tribalistic attitude the best
way to cope with a world whose
many subdued peoples are striv
ing to achieve the full and mean
ingful life which is due them,
as us, as human beings?
The biologist's central argu
ment — that war (though "hell"
as he so magnanimously admits)
is just and inevitable — amounts
to a glorification of military con
quest as the instrument of human
progress. (After all, wasn't that
most perfect of all societies.
American democracy, born out of
the tooth and claw struggle of
man against man, nation against
nation?) In other words, out of
bloodshed, rapine, and crime (for
that is what war is) are to come
mankind's highest values! Such
crude moral pathos might con
ceivably had had some persuasive
force in the era of Darwin, Treit
schke, or Admiral Mahan, but to
day, with the chastising experi
ence of two world wars and the
dreadful fear of a third, none but
the utterly foolish or insensate
could entertain such pernicious
doctrines.
Yet by far the most deplorable
facet of the biologist's smug little
tirade against the pacifists is the
image of man which he holds up
for emulation: "As long as one
human being has something that
another hasn't, or that another
wants, and that will be as long
as Ihere are two or more people
on the earth, these so-called 'high
er organisms' arc going to devise
ways and means of taking what
they want away from one an
other." But whom does this argu
ment convince? It only reveals
the ugly ethical nihilism lurking
behind the biologist's tawdry
phrases about "fredom" and
"democracy." It reveals only his
own perverted conviction that the
end justifies the means, that force
is the rightful arbiter in all dis
putes, and that man — that 'high
er organism' as Biology sees him
- is nothing more than a boast
with a will to power.
Yet against this biologist Smith
I would argue with the phychia
trist Viktor Frankl that nihilism
has too long held up to our eyes
this grotesque and distorted im
age of man. The effect has been
for man to view himself as

"nothing but" the product of his
heredity and environment (his

Daily possess an obnoxious qual
ity indeed. Apart from the ex
treme arrogance and self
righteous tenor of his assertions
the biologist's arguments demon
strate a vulgar patriotic senti
mentalism coupled with a mani
fest absence of human values.
For example, the biologist pr o
claims: "There are others who
envy what we have . . . And as
long as nations exist which
threaten our way of life and what
we stand for, we cannot rest
unarmed." But is this paranoid
and tribalistic attitude the best
way to cope with a world whose
many subdued peoples are striv
ing to achieve the full and mean
ingful life which is due them,
as us, as human beings?
The biologist's central argu
ment — that war (though "hell"
as he so magnanimously admits)
is just and inevitable — amounts
to a glorification of military con
quest as the instrument of human
progress. (After all, wasn't that
most perfect of all societies.
American democracy, born out of
the tooth and claw struggle of
man against man, nation against
nation?) In other words, out of
bloodshed, rapine, and crime (for
that is what war is) are to come
mankind's highest values! Such
crude moral pathos might con
ceivably had had some persuasive
force in the era of Darwin, Treit
schke, or Admiral Mahan, but to
day, with the chastising experi
ence of two world wars and the
dreadful fear of a third, none but
the utterly foolish or insensate
could entertain such pernicious
doctrines.
Yet by far the most deplorable
facet of the biologist's smug little
tirade against the pacifists is the
image of man which he holds up
for emulation: "As long as one
human being has something that
another hasn't, or that another
wants, and that will be as long
as Ihere are two or more people
on the earth, these so-called 'high
er organisms' arc going to devise
ways and means of taking what
they want away from one an
other." But whom does this argu
ment convince? It only reveals
the ugly ethical nihilism lurking
behind the biologist's tawdry
phrases about "fredom" and
"democracy." It reveals only his
own perverted conviction that the
end justifies the means, that force
is the rightful arbiter in all dis
putes, and that man — that 'high
er organism' as Biology sees him
- is nothing more than a boast
with a will to power.
Yet against this biologist Smith
I would argue with the phychia
trist Viktor Frankl that nihilism
has too long held up to our eyes
this grotesque and distorted im
age of man. The effect has been
for man to view himself as

"nothing but" the product of his
heredity and environment (his
"blood and soil") and his beastly
instincts. In this image, man,
viewing himself as a beast, be
eomes a beast, and respect for
the inviolable sanctity of human
life evaporates into thin air.
The great relevance of pacifism
to our age is that it confirms the
innate worth of man as a morally
responsible agent in the world.
Man is not the tool of heredity
and environment or of those "vast
impersonal forces" of the uni
verse, but is fre, within limits, to
create for himself a better world,
even if he will never see the City
of God descend to this mortal
dust.
Peace, moreover, is not a wild
dream or a pathological hallucina
tion, but a concrete ideal which
mankind can approach only in
striving each day to realize it. To
have peace, we must first want it.
We must believe man is capable
of it. Then we must work for it.
By peace I do not mean Utopia,
but that which man can achieve
through world law. This, if you
will, is not idealism. It is realism
—the kind which Goethe meant
when he said : "When we take
man as he is, we make him worse;
but when we take man as if he
were already what he should be,
we promote him to what he can
be."

KEANE LECTURE
Editor, the Daily:
Margaret Keane's lecture
yesterday on the role of the ed
ucated woman in a career in art
was interrupted several times by
disturbances in the audience.
Soon after Mrs. Keane began
speaking, rats were dispersed
throughout the audience. Con
cerning these disturbances,
Michael Moore of the Art Dept.
has these words to say:
"Amusing as the hurling of in
nocent rats into a lecture room
full of women may be, it results
at best in mere chaos, and accom
plishes little as a protestation
against the speaker. In realization
of this and the inhospitable air
created by the rat incident and
other minor disturbances at Mar
garet Keane's lecture, I would
like, as the organizer of these
minor infamies, to apologize for
them. Such acts accomplish little
and lend a bad odor to their mo
tivitation, however just.
"I would also like to apologize
to Fred Nelson for my insulting
behavior at the close of the lec
ture."
The motivation to which Mr.
Moore was referring was the
widespread feeling among those
who are educated in art that "art"
possessing such definite evidence
of commerciality as Mrs. Keane's
work should not be represented
as sincere fine art. There is more
to art than what is on Mrs,
Keane's canvas and there should
l)e wide recognition of this fact.
