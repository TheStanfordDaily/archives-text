# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## Underdog Frosh Nipped But Rematch doming Up 
### 
Justin Beck

America's favorite animal is the underrlog, that mysterious organ
ism like the New York Mots, Floyd Patterson, Studebaker, and
Richard M. Nixon, whose only rare victories conic in the form of
upsets.
Last Friday, Stanford's most favorite underdog, the Frosh basket
ball team, came within a hairsbreath of such an upset, forcing their
bigger, more experienced elders, the Junior-varsity into overtime
before succumbing 63-59.
It wasn't a game that attracted too much campus attention.
People who cared about, basketball and underdogs were more con
cerned with the varsity and their weekend games with Oregon State,
the nation's tenth ranked team.
So, the Pavilion was practically empty Friday afternoon except
lor a handful of students who wandered in, apparently little more
than curious about how big the Braves winning margin would be.
An oddsmaker picking the morning line on the game would have
noted the following tilings: a Freshman squad with a 2-3 record miss
ing two starters, Brock Gowdy, the team's leading rebounder, and
guard Mike Matkins; and a junior-varsity having lost only one game
with at least an inch advantage al every position and quite possibly
a similar edge in talent. And then he would have picked the Braves
by twenty.
FROSH UNVEIL NEW STRATEGY
Coach Bill Turner, it was true, had been planning some surprises
for the Braves. During the week he had kept his team under tight
wraps and when asked about his strategy would only promise some
changes for the freshmen.
And that's exactly what the Frosh got, a new offense, a new

defense, and in the second half
a brand new zone press, similar in
form if not in quality, to that used
so effectively by UCLA.
But the biggest surprise in
store for the Braves was not Ihe
plays, but rather the players they
were facing. The freshmen played
the hardest they had played all
year, and even when the score
reached 36-1 <S against them they
did not give up.
But the Braves had desire too,
and talent to go with ft. A shooter
and part-time varsity performer
named Skip Hutchinson, Sigma
Chi's top ' guard, Rod Young,
loaned to the J-V's for more sea
soning, and Bob Evans, a 6-5 for
ward.
BRAVES GO INTO LEAD
For a while the game was on
fairly even terms until the Braves

found a quick pass to Hutchison
that left him open for a shot. Two long jump shots and the Frosh
were back in their usual defense and behind by four points.
For the rest of the first half the score increased steadily on the
Braves half of the scoreboard while the Frosh seemed hard pressed
to even hold the score thoy already had. Everybody and in paricu
lar Evans found ways to score in the next few minutes and by half
time Coach Turner's young men found themselves 16 points down
with twenty more long trying minutes left in the game.
The second half opened with another quick Brave score, with
that and even the most courageous Frosh supporters in the stands
began looking a little green. If any records were to be broken in
the game, it seemed certain that the Frosh were not going to he
doing the breaking.
Then the underdogs showed their teelh, a full court press and
suddenly the Brave margin began to diminish. Walt Hazzard, Fred
Slaughter, and Gail Goodrich weren't out on (he court, but lesser

names like Tom Nisbet, Bill Kel
so, Bob Odell, Kent Borchard, and
Barry Rapp were doing j us t as
effective a .job.
The bigger, more polished
Braves began looking smaller,
and less experienced than th e
hustling freshmen. When they
broke the press and came down
for the easy basket, Nisbet and
his teammates were there ahead
of them. And when they tried to
set up an offense, their experi
enced guards Hutchison, Young,
and Jim Pandell began throwing
the ball away.
UNDERDOG PULLS AHEAD
Finally with five minutes left
in the game, the Frosh pulled
ahead by one, and started looking
for the easy shot. Rapp, a guard
starting his first freshman game,
couldn't find that easy shot, so
he took a fifteen foot jumper. II
went in and the Frosh lead was
three.
But their lead suffered the same
fate as the junior varsity's, al
though on a smaller scale. Trying
to slow down the game, the Frosh
threw the ball onto the scorer's
table, and threw the game inlo a
tie.
That was their high point. The
game went into overtime, and the
Frosh made the mistake of foul
ing Hutchison twice too many
times. And a game they tried
hard to win, and a game they de
served to win, was lost by four
points 63-59.
Friday, the same two teams
playing at the same time in the
same place will face each o th e r
again. Coach Turner has again
promised some changes will be
made.

Chi's top ' guard, Rod Young,
loaned to the J-V's for more sea
soning, and Bob Evans, a 6-5 for
ward.
BRAVES GO INTO LEAD
For a while the game was on
fairly even terms until the Braves

found a quick pass to Hutchison
that left him open for a shot. Two long jump shots and the Frosh
were back in their usual defense and behind by four points.
For the rest of the first half the score increased steadily on the
Braves half of the scoreboard while the Frosh seemed hard pressed
to even hold the score thoy already had. Everybody and in paricu
lar Evans found ways to score in the next few minutes and by half
time Coach Turner's young men found themselves 16 points down
with twenty more long trying minutes left in the game.
The second half opened with another quick Brave score, with
that and even the most courageous Frosh supporters in the stands
began looking a little green. If any records were to be broken in
the game, it seemed certain that the Frosh were not going to he
doing the breaking.
Then the underdogs showed their teelh, a full court press and
suddenly the Brave margin began to diminish. Walt Hazzard, Fred
Slaughter, and Gail Goodrich weren't out on (he court, but lesser

names like Tom Nisbet, Bill Kel
so, Bob Odell, Kent Borchard, and
Barry Rapp were doing j us t as
effective a .job.
The bigger, more polished
Braves began looking smaller,
and less experienced than th e
hustling freshmen. When they
broke the press and came down
for the easy basket, Nisbet and
his teammates were there ahead
of them. And when they tried to
set up an offense, their experi
enced guards Hutchison, Young,
and Jim Pandell began throwing
the ball away.
UNDERDOG PULLS AHEAD
Finally with five minutes left
in the game, the Frosh pulled
ahead by one, and started looking
for the easy shot. Rapp, a guard
starting his first freshman game,
couldn't find that easy shot, so
he took a fifteen foot jumper. II
went in and the Frosh lead was
three.
But their lead suffered the same
fate as the junior varsity's, al
though on a smaller scale. Trying
to slow down the game, the Frosh
threw the ball onto the scorer's
table, and threw the game inlo a
tie.
That was their high point. The
game went into overtime, and the
Frosh made the mistake of foul
ing Hutchison twice too many
times. And a game they tried
hard to win, and a game they de
served to win, was lost by four
points 63-59.
Friday, the same two teams
playing at the same time in the
same place will face each o th e r
again. Coach Turner has again
promised some changes will be
made.

America's favorite animal is the underrlog, that mysterious organ
ism like the New York Mots, Floyd Patterson, Studebaker, and
Richard M. Nixon, whose only rare victories conic in the form of
upsets.
Last Friday, Stanford's most favorite underdog, the Frosh basket
ball team, came within a hairsbreath of such an upset, forcing their
bigger, more experienced elders, the Junior-varsity into overtime
before succumbing 63-59.
It wasn't a game that attracted too much campus attention.
People who cared about, basketball and underdogs were more con
cerned with the varsity and their weekend games with Oregon State,
the nation's tenth ranked team.
So, the Pavilion was practically empty Friday afternoon except
lor a handful of students who wandered in, apparently little more
than curious about how big the Braves winning margin would be.
An oddsmaker picking the morning line on the game would have
noted the following tilings: a Freshman squad with a 2-3 record miss
ing two starters, Brock Gowdy, the team's leading rebounder, and
guard Mike Matkins; and a junior-varsity having lost only one game
with at least an inch advantage al every position and quite possibly
a similar edge in talent. And then he would have picked the Braves
by twenty.
FROSH UNVEIL NEW STRATEGY
Coach Bill Turner, it was true, had been planning some surprises
for the Braves. During the week he had kept his team under tight
wraps and when asked about his strategy would only promise some
changes for the freshmen.
And that's exactly what the Frosh got, a new offense, a new

defense, and in the second half
a brand new zone press, similar in
form if not in quality, to that used
so effectively by UCLA.
But the biggest surprise in
store for the Braves was not Ihe
plays, but rather the players they
were facing. The freshmen played
the hardest they had played all
year, and even when the score
reached 36-1 <S against them they
did not give up.
But the Braves had desire too,
and talent to go with ft. A shooter

fate as the junior varsity's, al
though on a smaller scale. Trying
to slow down the game, the Frosh
threw the ball onto the scorer's
table, and threw the game inlo a
tie.
That was their high point. The
game went into overtime, and the
Frosh made the mistake of foul
ing Hutchison twice too many
times. And a game they tried
hard to win, and a game they de
served to win, was lost by four
points 63-59.
Friday, the same two teams
playing at the same time in the
same place will face each o th e r
again. Coach Turner has again
promised some changes will be
made.

America's favorite animal is the underrlog, that mysterious organ
ism like the New York Mots, Floyd Patterson, Studebaker, and
Richard M. Nixon, whose only rare victories conic in the form of
upsets.
Last Friday, Stanford's most favorite underdog, the Frosh basket
ball team, came within a hairsbreath of such an upset, forcing their
bigger, more experienced elders, the Junior-varsity into overtime
before succumbing 63-59.
It wasn't a game that attracted too much campus attention.
People who cared about, basketball and underdogs were more con
cerned with the varsity and their weekend games with Oregon State,
the nation's tenth ranked team.
So, the Pavilion was practically empty Friday afternoon except
lor a handful of students who wandered in, apparently little more
than curious about how big the Braves winning margin would be.
An oddsmaker picking the morning line on the game would have
noted the following tilings: a Freshman squad with a 2-3 record miss
ing two starters, Brock Gowdy, the team's leading rebounder, and
guard Mike Matkins; and a junior-varsity having lost only one game
with at least an inch advantage al every position and quite possibly
a similar edge in talent. And then he would have picked the Braves
by twenty.
FROSH UNVEIL NEW STRATEGY
Coach Bill Turner, it was true, had been planning some surprises
for the Braves. During the week he had kept his team under tight
wraps and when asked about his strategy would only promise some
changes for the freshmen.
And that's exactly what the Frosh got, a new offense, a new

defense, and in the second half
a brand new zone press, similar in
form if not in quality, to that used
so effectively by UCLA.
But the biggest surprise in
store for the Braves was not Ihe
plays, but rather the players they
were facing. The freshmen played
the hardest they had played all
year, and even when the score
reached 36-1 <S against them they
did not give up.
But the Braves had desire too,
and talent to go with ft. A shooter
and part-time varsity performer
named Skip Hutchinson, Sigma
Chi's top ' guard, Rod Young,
loaned to the J-V's for more sea
soning, and Bob Evans, a 6-5 for
ward.
BRAVES GO INTO LEAD
For a while the game was on
fairly even terms until the Braves

found a quick pass to Hutchison
that left him open for a shot. Two long jump shots and the Frosh
were back in their usual defense and behind by four points.
For the rest of the first half the score increased steadily on the
Braves half of the scoreboard while the Frosh seemed hard pressed
to even hold the score thoy already had. Everybody and in paricu
lar Evans found ways to score in the next few minutes and by half
time Coach Turner's young men found themselves 16 points down
with twenty more long trying minutes left in the game.
The second half opened with another quick Brave score, with
that and even the most courageous Frosh supporters in the stands
began looking a little green. If any records were to be broken in
the game, it seemed certain that the Frosh were not going to he
doing the breaking.
Then the underdogs showed their teelh, a full court press and
suddenly the Brave margin began to diminish. Walt Hazzard, Fred
Slaughter, and Gail Goodrich weren't out on (he court, but lesser

names like Tom Nisbet, Bill Kel
so, Bob Odell, Kent Borchard, and
Barry Rapp were doing j us t as
effective a .job.
The bigger, more polished
Braves began looking smaller,
and less experienced than th e
hustling freshmen. When they
broke the press and came down
for the easy basket, Nisbet and
his teammates were there ahead
of them. And when they tried to
set up an offense, their experi
enced guards Hutchison, Young,
and Jim Pandell began throwing
the ball away.
UNDERDOG PULLS AHEAD
Finally with five minutes left
in the game, the Frosh pulled
ahead by one, and started looking
for the easy shot. Rapp, a guard
starting his first freshman game,
couldn't find that easy shot, so
he took a fifteen foot jumper. II
went in and the Frosh lead was
three.
But their lead suffered the same
fate as the junior varsity's, al
though on a smaller scale. Trying
