and Michigan State last week for
a 14-1 mark.
Davidson, undefeated in 15
games, including last week's 105-
73 walloping of Wofford, ad
vanced one place to third. The
Wildcats polled the other two first
place votes.
Kentucky and Villanova also
advanced one place. Kentucky
moved to fourth on the strength
of a 79-62 conquest of Georgia
Tech while Villanova advanced
to sixth with victories over West
Chester and Penn.

to fifth although it was not
scheduled last week. The Com

held the No. 8 followed by un
beaten DePaul and Loyola of
Chicago. Loyola collected 63
points, only four more than Ore
gon State which deadlocked

iAP> Tho unbeaten UCLA
Bruins remained in first place in
the Associated Press' major-Col
lege basketball poll Monday. But
the seven-place tumble experi
enced by Loyola of Chicago, last,
seasons' NCAA champion, was a
real shocker.
Loyola, in third place a week
ago, slumped to 10th alter losing
its second and third games of ihe
campaign, 83-65 to Memphis State
and 80-70 to the Wichita Shock
ers. Loyola has won 11.

14th against three setbacks, lifted
them three notches to seventh
place.
UCLA, idle last week, collected
33 votes for first place and 392

with a 115-0 record, return to ac
tion this weekend with hack-to
back games against California,
Santa Barbara.
Michigan remained in second
place with 345 points, including
five votes for the No. 1 spot. The
Wolverines downed Minnesota
and Michigan State last week for
a 14-1 mark.
Davidson, undefeated in 15
games, including last week's 105-
73 walloping of Wofford, ad
vanced one place to third. The
Wildcats polled the other two first
place votes.
Kentucky and Villanova also
advanced one place. Kentucky
moved to fourth on the strength
of a 79-62 conquest of Georgia
Tech while Villanova advanced
to sixth with victories over West
Chester and Penn.
