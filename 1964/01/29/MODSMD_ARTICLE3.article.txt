# Dead Week Isn't Dying; It's Always Been Dead
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR 
Is there really a Dead Week?
Though finals are still two
months away, many students are
seriously raising this question as
they find their courses fully
scheduled right into the weekend
before that first examination.
And Dead Week lectures are often
themselves overshadowed by a
term paper due or even by a mid
term exam or take-home final.
THE CUBKKNT c on 1' us i on
stems from two myths about the
nature of Dead Week that have
long run unchecked in student
and faculty circles. Students,
especially the less-hardened fresh
men, often labor under the mis
conception that no classes are
meant to bo scheduled during the
seven days before finals. In point
of fact, Dead Week classes have
always been standard policy.
Otic of the reasons for the mis
conception is probably that the
term "Dead Week" calls up false
visions of silent dormitories, late
hours, and an empty Quad. Sec
ondly, many professors and some
departments do make the effort
to leave Dead Week free of
classes.
SOME PROFESSORS, on the
other hand, think that Dead Week
is just when the Daily stops pub
lishing and activities are can
celed. The week is therefore an
appropriate lime to make papers
due and increase work loads.
Many feel, at least, that the week
ought not to be "wasted."
To eliminate the uncertainty
which has long prevailed, th e
Schedule and Examinations Sub
committee of the Registrar's Ad
visory Committee has issued a
detailed policy statement. The
official concept of Dead Week,
outlined by the Subcommittee, is
as "a period for assimilation and
review" in which there should be
no increase in work load, no
exams, and no papers due.
OR. lIARVEY IIAI-L, Registrar,
points out that Dead Week is not
meant .just "to save students from
themselves, hut to keep certain
courses from making undue de
mands" lo the disadvantage of
others.
Faculty members have been re
quested by llie Subcommittee on
Schedule and Examinations to ob
serve the following general rules
which have been approved by the
Executive Committee of the Aca
demic Council:
• In general, classes are con
tinued during Dead Week and pro
lessors should make special ef
forts to be available for student
i consultal ion.
• Tin-iv hould be no qui^'o"

or examinations during Dead
Week.
• T a k e • ho m e examinations
should be handed out to the stu
dents no later than one week
prior to the beginning of Dead
Week and they should be of such
a nature that there is no increase
in student work-load during Dead j
Week.
• Instructors should avoid ex
tra or special assignments during
Dead Week. Customary weekly
assignments may be given.
• Faculty should be encouraged
lo assign term papers early in the
quarter, to be due no later- than
the beginning of Dead Week.
• No classes should be held on
the day before finals, when finals
start on Friday (Spring Quarter).
Dr. Joseph Franzini, Professor
of Civil Engineering and Chair
man of the Subcommittee, has
a>ked that students cooperate by
discontinuing their extracurricu
lar activities during Dead Week,
and I he Public Exercises Commit
tee will schedule no speakers ex
cept by special request and under i
unusual circumstances.

Faculty members have been re
quested by llie Subcommittee on
Schedule and Examinations to ob
serve the following general rules
which have been approved by the
Executive Committee of the Aca
demic Council:
• In general, classes are con
tinued during Dead Week and pro
lessors should make special ef
forts to be available for student
i consultal ion.
• Tin-iv hould be no qui^'o"

or examinations during Dead
Week.
• T a k e • ho m e examinations
should be handed out to the stu
dents no later than one week
prior to the beginning of Dead
Week and they should be of such
a nature that there is no increase
in student work-load during Dead j
Week.
• Instructors should avoid ex
tra or special assignments during
Dead Week. Customary weekly
assignments may be given.
• Faculty should be encouraged
lo assign term papers early in the
quarter, to be due no later- than
the beginning of Dead Week.
• No classes should be held on
the day before finals, when finals
start on Friday (Spring Quarter).
Dr. Joseph Franzini, Professor
of Civil Engineering and Chair

unusual circumstances.
Is there really a Dead Week?
Though finals are still two
months away, many students are
seriously raising this question as
they find their courses fully
scheduled right into the weekend
before that first examination.
And Dead Week lectures are often
themselves overshadowed by a
term paper due or even by a mid
term exam or take-home final.
THE CUBKKNT c on 1' us i on
stems from two myths about the
nature of Dead Week that have
long run unchecked in student
and faculty circles. Students,
especially the less-hardened fresh
men, often labor under the mis
conception that no classes are
meant to bo scheduled during the
seven days before finals. In point
of fact, Dead Week classes have
always been standard policy.
Otic of the reasons for the mis
conception is probably that the
term "Dead Week" calls up false
visions of silent dormitories, late
hours, and an empty Quad. Sec
ondly, many professors and some
departments do make the effort
to leave Dead Week free of
classes.
SOME PROFESSORS, on the
other hand, think that Dead Week
is just when the Daily stops pub
lishing and activities are can
celed. The week is therefore an
appropriate lime to make papers
due and increase work loads.
Many feel, at least, that the week
ought not to be "wasted."
To eliminate the uncertainty
which has long prevailed, th e
Schedule and Examinations Sub
committee of the Registrar's Ad
