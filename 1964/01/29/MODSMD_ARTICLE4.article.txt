### 
The highest honor his colleagues
can bestow upon a U.S. mathe
matical analyst has been awarded
to Stanford University Prof. Paul
J. Cohen by the American Mathe
matical Society at their annual
meeting.
The Bocher Memorial Prize,
awarded only once every five
years for the most notable re
search paper in analysis published
during the preceding period, was
presented to the 29-year-old Stan
ford mathematician in a special
ceremony at the University of
Miami. Past winners include some
of the most famous names in
American mathematics.
Cohen's paper. "On a Conjec
ture of Littlevvood and Idempo
tent Measures," was published in
the American Journal of Mathe
matics of April 1960. II dealt with
problems in Fourier analysis, a
branch of mathematics used in
nearly all areas of science a n d
engineering. The author describes
il as "concerning estimates for ex
ponential sums and related prob
lems on locally compact Abelian
groups."
Prof. Cohen will be honored
again Thursday in New York for
highly original work he did in
1903. He will share the $10,01)0
Research Corp. Award for 1903
with Prof. Ueisuke Hironaka of
Mi mdei Univet its.
