# Volunteers Urged to Join Overseas Work(?) Camps
## 
### JACQUES M. CALMA 
Crossroads Africa enthusiasts
should bo interested in the volun
tary workcamps programs of the
American Friends Service C o in
mittee. Every summer the Friends
send more than a hundred Amer
ican college students to overseas
workcamps, most of them located
in Europe and sponsored by Eu
ropean organizations.
VOLUNTEERS IN Europe usu
ally attend two camps of about
3-1 weeks duration and have addi
tional time for their own forays.
Last year's camps ranged from
Scotland to Yugoslavia and from
Norway to Spain.
Last summer 1 attended a single
workcamp organized by the AFSC
outside Port Hareourt, East Ni
geria. Nigerian, European, and
American students constructed a
dormitory and school for orphans
and delinquents. We were occa
sionally visited by political figures
and often invited into the social
life of the town.
Nigerians received us with ex
inonlin irv friendlirir' irdrrct

and generosity. We were also re
ceived with suspicion: even some
fellow volunteers believed we
were being paid by the American
government; and most literate
Nigerians demonstrated acute
awareness of racial incidents in
the South. Volunteers need not be
authorities on race relations
(most questions can be answered
simply), but they should be pre
pared to face accusations of "dis
crimination" or romantic attach
ments of African students.
THE Fill ENDS ask volunteers
to pay $600 ($B5O for volunteers
to Africa) toward the cost of the
program, of which enough is re
turned to cover living expenses
in Europe. Requests for camps
in specific countries are usually
honored.
It is my impression that a Stan
ford applicant has an excellent
chance of acceptance provided
that he or she shares the Friends'
egalitarian, pacifistic bias. Inter
ested students can obtain applica
tions from the AFSC, 2160 Lake
Street. " l\
