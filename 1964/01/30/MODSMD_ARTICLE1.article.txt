# 'Key to the Future Is Responsibility,' States Tompkins
## 
### MIKE WAGGONER Associate Editor 
"You represent the affluent so
ciety and are enrolled in one of
America's most prestigious insti
tutions. These facts can give you
a sense of social responsibility, or
they can make you complacent
boors, concerned only with 'th e
luxury problems of a privileged
class'," Dr. Pauline Tompkins of
the American Association of Uni
versity Women told a very respon
sive audience yesterday afternoon
in Tresidder.
She stated that this situation
is a reflection of our society. This
is a world of affluence, which
saps our imagination and waters
our ideals, and of revolution,
which encourages insecurity and
conservatism. Responsibility is
the key word to meeting this
double challenge of revolution
and affluence.
THE WORLD IS rapidly chang
ing. Those in it are quite inse
cure. This insecurity induces in
some a desire for homey reaction:
return woman 1o the home and
the roles biology has determined
for her; stop her competition with
man before he is deprived of his
masculinity; let her new role*, if
she needs one, be that of seduc
tive mistress, wife and mother,
rather than wife and partner in
family raising- and career.
This homey reaction, according
to Dr. Tompkins, is impossible.
The revolution in the role of wom
en is as irrestible as the political
and economic revolutions of our
time. Having discovered that she
has a mind, woman must live
with this mind or with dishonesty.
Women can and do compete
with men in almost all careers,
including even nomination-seek
ing for the Presidency of the U.S.
Dr. Tompkins showed the lengths
to which this can go in a quote
from Chritabel Pankhurst, "You
must pray to God. and She will
help you."
I)R. TOMPKINS proudly a n d
enthusiastically told of the many
areas where women are compet
ing with men, and told of the
AAWU's efforts both to encour
age more women to seek careers
and to lower the barriers to wom
en seeking careers.
The career woman, as opposed
to the feminine woman, is not the
ideal of Dr. Tompkins. Rather,
she wants a synthesis of the two.
It is through this synthesis that
woman can make her greatest
contribution. She must strive to
bring the traditional values of the
home into agreement with the
values of the market place. She
must do this largely by changing
the values of the market place.
She must do this lest the double
standard of home and market de
stroy the home, and with it much
of our values and culture.
It is now easier to combine
wifedom and carcordom. People
live longer and have children
over fewer years, so the two roles
can be filled consecutively. Better
still, according to Dr. Tompkins,
would be doing both at the same
time, the wife becoming a partner
in career, the husband a partner
in family-raising. This partner
wife, not the home wife, is the
good wife.
Copies of Tompkin's speech will
be available at the AWS sympo
sium today.
