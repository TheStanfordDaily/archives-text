# 'Tom Jones' Looks at Life With Humor
## 
### JIM HAUSER 
If you are in the movie mood
Sunday night, "Tom Jones"|is just
what you are looking for. Now
in San Francisco, the film not
only provides an excellent excuse
to see the city al least once before
mid-terms but also boasts a qual
ity comic plot.
The humor is not farcical. Farce
relies on the separation of reality
and screen for its effect. Tom
Jones has empathy and sympathy
for life. He does not open it to
attack, he enjoys without malice
the incongruities of its situations.
The humor evaluates human expe
rience in the Falstaff tradition
and avoids the sunny but shallow
humor of Oscar Wilde.
IT IS RARE enough for an
author to caplitre this quality of
mirth as Henry Fielding has done
in "Tom Jones," but rarer still for
the movie medium to capture so
well the tone, mood, and spirit of
a novel.
The success justifies the $2 ad
mission. Another argument for
seeing the film THIS Sunday is
thai the 1-Center is arranging a
Movie Party. Departure time
from the 1-Center is G: 15 p.m.
The party will return to campus
shortly after 11 p.m. The I-Center
states that deadlines for sign-ups
is Saturday noon. Car pools will
provide transportation. Those
signing up will tie telephoned Sat
urday afternoon to confirm nr
