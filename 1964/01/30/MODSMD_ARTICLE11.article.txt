Participants in the panel are

The panel discussion is the sec
ond recent program sponsored by
the Student Congress on civil
rights. Bruce Gordon, SNCC field
secretary, spoke last Friday, out
lining plans for SNCC's summer
campaign to send students to the
south to work in various areas of
civil rights action with emphasis
on voter registration and educa
tion.
Brown, a graduate of Amherst
College and Union Theological
Seminary, expressed one of his
goals as a theologian and educa
tor as that of making theology
relevant to contemporary social
problems. He is especially con
cerned with pursuing Christian
conviction into action. Brown
spent 24 hours in a Florida jail
in July, 1960, for taking part in
a freedom ride.
McDONOUGH, chairman of the
California Law Revision Commis
sion, expects that students will
be interested in the legal aspects
of going south for civil rights ac
tivity, such as the possible con
sequences for a student who plans
to go to law school if he is arrest
ed and jailed for civil rights ac
tivity.
Dornbusch, who received his
PhD. at the University of Chic
ago, is now serving- as President
of Ihe Pacific Sociological Asso
ciation, and served as Associate
Dean of Humanities and Sciences.
