## Republican Candidate to Win Must Use 'Me-Too' Platform 
### 
While no one can suppose that the polls measuring Pi*esident
Johnson's popularity predict exactly what is going to happen next
November, they do say that as of now the Republican Party is in
very bad shape indeed.
When one remembers that a candidate who gets 60% of the votes
on election day wins by a large landslide in the Electoral College,
these current figures rating President Johnson at 75 or even 80',
seem to say there is some kind of convulsion within the Republican
Party. For while President Johnson will almost certainly not get
the votes of all the people who are for him now, I believe the polls
are telling an important story.
It turns on the argument about me-tooism among Republicans,
as illustrated by Goldwater and Rockefeller.
SENATOR GOLDWATER is saying that the Republican Party
can win only if it offers the voters "a choice and not an echo." His
theory is that the Republicans must differ radically from the Demo
crats.
Governor Rockefeller, on the other hand, not only agrees with the
main aims of the Democrats, but knows that a large majority of the
people agree with them, also. So he is driven to take the position
that the Republican Party with him as leader would achieve the
common aims better than the Democrats can achieve them. This is
what Senator Goldwater calls me-tooism, in his mind a recipe for
defeat.
If we take a close look at me-tooism, we have to ask ourselves
whether, in fact, the kind of radically different alternative exists
which Senator Goldwater talks about. No Republican Presidential
candidate since the Roosevelt landslides of the 1930s has thought
that there was such an alternative. Willkie, Dewey, Eisenhower and
Nixon all practiced what Senator Goldwater calls me-tooism.
Why? Not because they did not wish to win. Not because they
did not wish to offer the voters a choice between themselves and the
Democratic candidates. They practiced me-tooism because in a nation
wide election there was no choice.
The Democratic Party under Franklin Roosevelt, Truman, Steven
son and Kennedy has pre-empted and occupied all the central posi
tions in national and international policy. There are no other national
postions to bo occupied. The fact that this is so is being demon
strated by the complete failure of Senator Goldwater himself to pro
duce any kind of coherent and defensible program.
HISTORICALLY, THE present plight of the Republican Party
dates from the split in 1912 between the Progessive Nationalists,
who were for Theodore Roosevelt, and the Parochial Stand-Patters,
who were for William Howard Taft. Only twice in the half-century
since that schism has the Republican Party been returned to power.
But both times it was after a great war, in the backwash of the
excitements and the sacrifices, when the people wore war-weary and
angry at the disappointing peace which followed the war.
Neither in the 1920s under Harding, Coolidge and Hoover, nor in
the 1950s under Eisenhower did the Republican Party return to power
with a radically different policy. Herbert Hoover, though he chose
to be a Republican, was in international affairs a Wilsonian Demo
crat. And Dwight D. Eisenhower, when he finally decided to be a
Republican, had nevertheless made his career and acquired his views
of policy under Roosevelt and Truman.
The me-tooism of the national Republicans is the consequence of
the historic fact that in the split of 1912 the Parochial Stand-Patters
ousted the Progressive Nationalists from the control of the party
organization. This is still the condition of the party.
That is why in Congress the Republican Party based on local
organizations is predominantly parochial and stand-pat and why,
when the national election comes along, the candidate who expects
to win has no choice but some kind of me-tooism. For when the
party split in 1912, it surrendered to the Democrats the initiative in
the selection and formulation of issues in domestic and international
affairs. By surrendering the initiative, the party organization sur
rendered the vital center of American politics to the Democrats.
LYNDON JOHNSON, who for 30 years has seen all this from the
inside, is exploiting the fact that all the central positions have been
surrendered to the Democrats. That is why the Democrats, who were
the minority party in the 19th century, have become the majority
party in this century. They now have the initiative as the Republi
cans had it when they were identified with great issues — the Union,
emancipation, the opening of the West and the recognition, with the
building of the Panama Canal, of the coming role of America as a
world power.
By an interesting and not mysterious turn of affairs, this tradi
tion of national leadership passed from Theodore Roosevelt, after
his defat in 1912, to his distant cousin and disciple, Franklin Roose
velt, who happened to be a Democrat.
Until the Republicans recover the national leadership, which they
might have done but did not do under President Eisenhower, they
are not likely V> have any alternative to me-tooism.

crat. And Dwight D. Eisenhower, when he finally decided to be a
Republican, had nevertheless made his career and acquired his views
of policy under Roosevelt and Truman.
The me-tooism of the national Republicans is the consequence of
the historic fact that in the split of 1912 the Parochial Stand-Patters
ousted the Progressive Nationalists from the control of the party
organization. This is still the condition of the party.
That is why in Congress the Republican Party based on local
organizations is predominantly parochial and stand-pat and why,
when the national election comes along, the candidate who expects
to win has no choice but some kind of me-tooism. For when the
party split in 1912, it surrendered to the Democrats the initiative in
the selection and formulation of issues in domestic and international
affairs. By surrendering the initiative, the party organization sur
rendered the vital center of American politics to the Democrats.
LYNDON JOHNSON, who for 30 years has seen all this from the
inside, is exploiting the fact that all the central positions have been
surrendered to the Democrats. That is why the Democrats, who were
the minority party in the 19th century, have become the majority
party in this century. They now have the initiative as the Republi
cans had it when they were identified with great issues — the Union,
emancipation, the opening of the West and the recognition, with the
building of the Panama Canal, of the coming role of America as a
world power.
By an interesting and not mysterious turn of affairs, this tradi
tion of national leadership passed from Theodore Roosevelt, after
his defat in 1912, to his distant cousin and disciple, Franklin Roose
velt, who happened to be a Democrat.
Until the Republicans recover the national leadership, which they
might have done but did not do under President Eisenhower, they
are not likely V> have any alternative to me-tooism.

While no one can suppose that the polls measuring Pi*esident
Johnson's popularity predict exactly what is going to happen next
November, they do say that as of now the Republican Party is in
very bad shape indeed.
When one remembers that a candidate who gets 60% of the votes
on election day wins by a large landslide in the Electoral College,
these current figures rating President Johnson at 75 or even 80',
seem to say there is some kind of convulsion within the Republican
Party. For while President Johnson will almost certainly not get
the votes of all the people who are for him now, I believe the polls
are telling an important story.
It turns on the argument about me-tooism among Republicans,
as illustrated by Goldwater and Rockefeller.
SENATOR GOLDWATER is saying that the Republican Party
can win only if it offers the voters "a choice and not an echo." His
theory is that the Republicans must differ radically from the Demo
crats.
Governor Rockefeller, on the other hand, not only agrees with the
main aims of the Democrats, but knows that a large majority of the
people agree with them, also. So he is driven to take the position
that the Republican Party with him as leader would achieve the
common aims better than the Democrats can achieve them. This is
what Senator Goldwater calls me-tooism, in his mind a recipe for
defeat.
If we take a close look at me-tooism, we have to ask ourselves
whether, in fact, the kind of radically different alternative exists
which Senator Goldwater talks about. No Republican Presidential
candidate since the Roosevelt landslides of the 1930s has thought
that there was such an alternative. Willkie, Dewey, Eisenhower and
Nixon all practiced what Senator Goldwater calls me-tooism.
Why? Not because they did not wish to win. Not because they
did not wish to offer the voters a choice between themselves and the
Democratic candidates. They practiced me-tooism because in a nation
wide election there was no choice.
The Democratic Party under Franklin Roosevelt, Truman, Steven
son and Kennedy has pre-empted and occupied all the central posi
tions in national and international policy. There are no other national
postions to bo occupied. The fact that this is so is being demon
strated by the complete failure of Senator Goldwater himself to pro
duce any kind of coherent and defensible program.
HISTORICALLY, THE present plight of the Republican Party
dates from the split in 1912 between the Progessive Nationalists,
who were for Theodore Roosevelt, and the Parochial Stand-Patters,
who were for William Howard Taft. Only twice in the half-century
since that schism has the Republican Party been returned to power.
But both times it was after a great war, in the backwash of the
excitements and the sacrifices, when the people wore war-weary and
angry at the disappointing peace which followed the war.
Neither in the 1920s under Harding, Coolidge and Hoover, nor in
the 1950s under Eisenhower did the Republican Party return to power
with a radically different policy. Herbert Hoover, though he chose
to be a Republican, was in international affairs a Wilsonian Demo
crat. And Dwight D. Eisenhower, when he finally decided to be a

that the Republican Party with him as leader would achieve the
common aims better than the Democrats can achieve them. This is
what Senator Goldwater calls me-tooism, in his mind a recipe for
defeat.
If we take a close look at me-tooism, we have to ask ourselves
whether, in fact, the kind of radically different alternative exists
which Senator Goldwater talks about. No Republican Presidential
candidate since the Roosevelt landslides of the 1930s has thought
that there was such an alternative. Willkie, Dewey, Eisenhower and
Nixon all practiced what Senator Goldwater calls me-tooism.
Why? Not because they did not wish to win. Not because they
did not wish to offer the voters a choice between themselves and the
Democratic candidates. They practiced me-tooism because in a nation
wide election there was no choice.
The Democratic Party under Franklin Roosevelt, Truman, Steven
son and Kennedy has pre-empted and occupied all the central posi
tions in national and international policy. There are no other national
postions to bo occupied. The fact that this is so is being demon
strated by the complete failure of Senator Goldwater himself to pro
duce any kind of coherent and defensible program.
HISTORICALLY, THE present plight of the Republican Party
dates from the split in 1912 between the Progessive Nationalists,
who were for Theodore Roosevelt, and the Parochial Stand-Patters,
who were for William Howard Taft. Only twice in the half-century
since that schism has the Republican Party been returned to power.
But both times it was after a great war, in the backwash of the
excitements and the sacrifices, when the people wore war-weary and
angry at the disappointing peace which followed the war.
Neither in the 1920s under Harding, Coolidge and Hoover, nor in
the 1950s under Eisenhower did the Republican Party return to power
with a radically different policy. Herbert Hoover, though he chose
to be a Republican, was in international affairs a Wilsonian Demo
crat. And Dwight D. Eisenhower, when he finally decided to be a
Republican, had nevertheless made his career and acquired his views
of policy under Roosevelt and Truman.
The me-tooism of the national Republicans is the consequence of
the historic fact that in the split of 1912 the Parochial Stand-Patters
ousted the Progressive Nationalists from the control of the party
organization. This is still the condition of the party.
That is why in Congress the Republican Party based on local
organizations is predominantly parochial and stand-pat and why,
when the national election comes along, the candidate who expects
to win has no choice but some kind of me-tooism. For when the
party split in 1912, it surrendered to the Democrats the initiative in
the selection and formulation of issues in domestic and international
affairs. By surrendering the initiative, the party organization sur
rendered the vital center of American politics to the Democrats.
LYNDON JOHNSON, who for 30 years has seen all this from the
inside, is exploiting the fact that all the central positions have been
surrendered to the Democrats. That is why the Democrats, who were
the minority party in the 19th century, have become the majority
party in this century. They now have the initiative as the Republi
cans had it when they were identified with great issues — the Union,
emancipation, the opening of the West and the recognition, with the
building of the Panama Canal, of the coming role of America as a
world power.
By an interesting and not mysterious turn of affairs, this tradi
tion of national leadership passed from Theodore Roosevelt, after
his defat in 1912, to his distant cousin and disciple, Franklin Roose
velt, who happened to be a Democrat.
Until the Republicans recover the national leadership, which they
might have done but did not do under President Eisenhower, they
are not likely V> have any alternative to me-tooism.

While no one can suppose that the polls measuring Pi*esident
Johnson's popularity predict exactly what is going to happen next
November, they do say that as of now the Republican Party is in
very bad shape indeed.
When one remembers that a candidate who gets 60% of the votes
on election day wins by a large landslide in the Electoral College,
these current figures rating President Johnson at 75 or even 80',
seem to say there is some kind of convulsion within the Republican
Party. For while President Johnson will almost certainly not get
the votes of all the people who are for him now, I believe the polls
are telling an important story.
It turns on the argument about me-tooism among Republicans,
as illustrated by Goldwater and Rockefeller.
SENATOR GOLDWATER is saying that the Republican Party
can win only if it offers the voters "a choice and not an echo." His
theory is that the Republicans must differ radically from the Demo
crats.
Governor Rockefeller, on the other hand, not only agrees with the
main aims of the Democrats, but knows that a large majority of the
people agree with them, also. So he is driven to take the position
that the Republican Party with him as leader would achieve the
common aims better than the Democrats can achieve them. This is
what Senator Goldwater calls me-tooism, in his mind a recipe for
defeat.
