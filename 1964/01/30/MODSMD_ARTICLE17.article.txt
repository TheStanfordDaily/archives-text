ANTI FAIR HOUSING
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to ask every Cali
fornia registered voter who has
received the petition being dis
tributed by the "Property Own
ers Protective Committee" to con
sider a couple of facts.
In 1911 an amendment to the
Constitution of the State of Cali
fornia was proposed to extend
the right to initiative and refer
endum to the voters of this state.
The amendment was strongly
backed by "the Progessive reform
movement" (the liberals of the
times) and was adopted into law.
According to Joseph P. Harris in
California Polities (3rd Edition,
Stanford University Press, 1961),
"Despite some exceptions, voters
of the state have usually exer
cised the power of direct legisla
tion wisely and with discrimina
tion." Around 500 times since then
this method of legislation has
been used to obtain the will of
the voters, and both liberal and
conservative interests have placed
issues before the people.
There is much talk in liberal
circles today of fervent opposition
to the petition described above,
and many attempts are currently
being made to subdue this at
tempt by one interest group to
use constitutionally guaranteed
rights of the initiative. Even the
governor of our state has stated
his opposition to the placement
of this initiative before the people.
Regardless of one's beliefs re
garding the matter of discrimina
tory practices in the sale, lease,
or rental of residential property,
il is important for every voter to
understand the following: by sign
ing the petition in question, no
person is voting to repeal th e
Rum ford Act or any other piece
of existing legislation. But, rather,
the signee only states: . . . "(I)
present to the Secretary of State
this petition and hereby propose
("1. to put forth for consideration
or acceptance" — Webster] an
amendment to the Constitution
. . . and petition that the same be
submitted to the electors of the
State of California for their adop
tion or rejection. . .

DAILY
Editor, The Daily:
The university, if it is a good
one, is an institutionalized thorn
in the side of society. The student
newspaper, if it is a good one, is
an institutionalized thorn in the
side of the university. (And we
suppose the Letters column is the
thorn in the newspaper's rib.)
Ideally there is a kind of "natural
balance" in the social world that
helps discourage pomposity and
frivolity and irresponsibility. But
actually the mechanism is always
threatened, the balance always
precarious. We get KPFA, we lose
our Now York Times. Let us hope
that Miss Strelitz' successor will
carry on in the gadfly spirit. This
has been a good edition of the
Daily, an edition commensurate
with the standards to which our
university aspires. We cannot af
ford a Silent Spring.

TOM DOSE
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to know by what
authority the Sports page of the
Daily keeps referring to Tom
Dose as an Ail-American. Dose is
a fine center by Stanford's tradi
tional center standards, scores
often, and in undoubtedly kind to
old ladies. However, it is both un
fair to him and to those who are
lured out to watch an "All-Ameri
man" in play to dub him as such
without authority. An All-Ameri
can center is the best in the coun
try: and the best can surely jump,
move with coordination, and play
good defense— which Dose can
not.
I am sure Dose himself does
not seek this billing. It is unfair
to submit him to criticism from
fans when he does not, obviously,
live up to it. He is a fine center
and consistent scorer; let's leave
it at that, without getting ridicu
lous.
