KEANE ART
Editor, The Daily:
Next to the man who paints the
pictures of philosophical tramps
which can be bought in the furni
ture sections of department stores,
Mrs. Keane is my favorite mod
ern artist. I really like her por
traits of undernourished children
with dilated, wise eyes. Thanks,
from all of us art-lovers, to the
people who brought Mrs. Keane
to Stanford!
Now that this good start has
been made, let us do something
for the music-lovers, too. Could
we not get Liberace to give a
talk at Tresidder Union? I know
that he is not really in high
fashion just now. But why give
in to the culture snobs? Let's be
bold! Let us show the world that
we genuinely love art at S t a n
ford, and that we know what art
is genuine.

Editor, The Daily:
This letter will probably go un
read by those to whom it is di
rected, since they seem not to
have attained the mentality of
the average first-grader. I refer
to the intellectual and cultural
giants who saw fit to loose mice
in the midst of a group of women
assembled to hear Margaret
Keane, a representative contempo
rary painter, speak on "Women in
Art."
To you, it seems, the precious
"freedom" you extol is a one-way
word: YOU are free to express,
even to deride; but others—whose
expressive vocabulary differs
from yours — are not granted
this privilege, and must be pub
licly humiliated. Where, I wonder,
do you derive your all-powerful
authority? The civilized ways of
expressing disagreement you ob
viously haw not heard of.

It is to ho hoped that whatever
artistic attempts you produce
meet wilh the tolerance and cour
tesy you were not generous
enough to extend to someone else,
sincerely trying to express herself
in her own way. Your actions are
disgusting, which no doubt de
lights you immeasurably. The de
structive minority has once again
reared its ugly head.

Editor, The I>aily:
Stanford has finally achieved
the distinction "unique among
American universities." Here foot
ball fans park their cars among
eucalyptus trees on acres of free
growing grass. Simultaneously,
however, the University is build
ing a central plaza (I refer to
the entire landscaping project)
covered with so much asphalt and
so little grass that it will be better
used as a parking lot than as
anything else. . . . T modify that
statement: it will also do nicely
if Dr. Sterling ever decides to
sing an Administrative Mass
from the Tresidder balcony to the
humbled but cheering masses of
the Stanford Community. But I
always thought parks were green
and parking lots black, instead
of the other way around.
Is this another example of the
University meaning well, but be
coming slightly confused in the
implementation of their plans?
Did they mistakenly order the
paving of the wrong part of our
campus? Or does someone in the
planning office actually think
that asphalt is prettier than
grass? In the long run.the as
phalt is probably easier to main
tain than is grass, but if I were
paying $250,000 for a new back
yard, I would want a lot more
than easy sweeping.

This letter will probably go un
read by those to whom it is di
rected, since they seem not to
have attained the mentality of
the average first-grader. I refer
to the intellectual and cultural
giants who saw fit to loose mice
in the midst of a group of women
assembled to hear Margaret
Keane, a representative contempo
rary painter, speak on "Women in
Art."
To you, it seems, the precious
"freedom" you extol is a one-way
word: YOU are free to express,
even to deride; but others—whose
expressive vocabulary differs
from yours — are not granted
this privilege, and must be pub
licly humiliated. Where, I wonder,
do you derive your all-powerful
authority? The civilized ways of
expressing disagreement you ob
viously haw not heard of.

It is to ho hoped that whatever
artistic attempts you produce
meet wilh the tolerance and cour
tesy you were not generous
enough to extend to someone else,
sincerely trying to express herself
in her own way. Your actions are
disgusting, which no doubt de
lights you immeasurably. The de
structive minority has once again
reared its ugly head.

Stanford has finally achieved
the distinction "unique among
American universities." Here foot
ball fans park their cars among
eucalyptus trees on acres of free
growing grass. Simultaneously,
however, the University is build
ing a central plaza (I refer to
the entire landscaping project)
covered with so much asphalt and
so little grass that it will be better
used as a parking lot than as
anything else. . . . T modify that
statement: it will also do nicely
if Dr. Sterling ever decides to
sing an Administrative Mass
from the Tresidder balcony to the
humbled but cheering masses of
the Stanford Community. But I
always thought parks were green
and parking lots black, instead
of the other way around.
Is this another example of the
University meaning well, but be
coming slightly confused in the
implementation of their plans?
Did they mistakenly order the
paving of the wrong part of our
campus? Or does someone in the
planning office actually think
that asphalt is prettier than
grass? In the long run.the as
phalt is probably easier to main
tain than is grass, but if I were
paying $250,000 for a new back
yard, I would want a lot more
than easy sweeping.

Next to the man who paints the
pictures of philosophical tramps
which can be bought in the furni
ture sections of department stores,
Mrs. Keane is my favorite mod
ern artist. I really like her por
traits of undernourished children
with dilated, wise eyes. Thanks,
from all of us art-lovers, to the
people who brought Mrs. Keane
to Stanford!
Now that this good start has
been made, let us do something
for the music-lovers, too. Could
we not get Liberace to give a
talk at Tresidder Union? I know
that he is not really in high
fashion just now. But why give
in to the culture snobs? Let's be
bold! Let us show the world that
we genuinely love art at S t a n
