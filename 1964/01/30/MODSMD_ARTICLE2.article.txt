At the LASSU meeting tomor

man of the LASSU Committee on I
Religion, will deliver a religious
report prepared by his commit
tee*. The meeting, to be held at ;
7:30 in the Small Lounge of Tres- I
idder, will not include a discus
sion of this report; a discussion;
will, however, be held next week, j
Commenting on the Commitee's |
report, Schwartz stated: "The in- j
formation gathered by the LASSU ,
Committee on Religion shows'
one clear point: the current reli
gion policy at Stanford does not !
meet the needs or desires of the
current Stanford community. It ;
seems apparent that changes in !
the religious policy and in the!
entire spirit and relevance of the j
religious program are very badly J
needed and wanted."
SEVERAL OTHER matters are j
included in the LASSU agenda |
this week. Plans will be presented j
for an ASSU Investment League, i
which will provide $5000 for in
vestment by students to gain in
vestment experience.
Final consideration will be giv
en for the ASSU Foreign Student
Housing Commission, and funds
will be appropriated for affilia
tions programs with three foreign
colleges: Keio, Japan; Merkerey,
Uganda; and the Free University
of Berlin.
