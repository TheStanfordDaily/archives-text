# Dose's Knee Improving
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
Stanford's basketball team this
year admittedly is not the quick
est nor the fastest imaginable.
| Its forte is tall players. The big
! gest and the best is 6'S" center
| Tom Dose.
As a much sought after high
school player from Glendale, Tom
decided to attend Stanford with-
I out aid. Neither Stanford nor he
has regretted his decision. Ever
j since Dose arrived on the varsity,
; the offense fashioned by C o a c h
, Howie Da 11 mar has been built
around him. Averaging 17.0 and
20.8 points for his first two sea
sons. he compiled 9(52 points. Last
year he was at the helm of the
offense that carried the Indians
to the AAWU co-championship,
and he received recognition as a
Helm's All-American. This year
should be his greatest campaign.
COACH DALLMAR considers
Dose's touch with a basketball
the finest he has seen while a
mentor at Stanford. His soft, un
usual touch that puts a minimal
spin on the ball produces baskets
from the inside when not facing
the basket and from the outside
when facing it. The possessor of
good, quick hands, his shooting
and rebounding abilities are un
questioned. However, some do
question his speed and aggres
sivenes. In many games, he finds
himself in foul trouble, that stems
from unnecessary fouls.
Dose got off to a good start
this season, and so did Stanford.
The SMU victory was Stanford's |
sixth of the season against no I
losses. In this game, which Dall
mar considers Dose's finest g;ime j
of the season along with the re
cent Utah fray, he scored 27 J
points, but a badly bruised knee I
inflicted by a SMU player in a
joust under the basket oversha- i
dowed this superlative effort. The i
injury kept him out of the next j
game against Arizona State and I
has allowed him to operate at ap
proximately 20'; below maximum
efficiency ever since. A tumble to j
the floor in the second half of the
first UCLA game 1 after an offen
sive foul reinjured the knee.
After the SMU encounter Dose
scored better than 20 three)
successive times. The next six
games, he fell well below the 20 |
mark. This decrease in scoring
Dutput was a combination of sev-!
?ral factors. The taped knee has j

lessened his maneuverability
around the low post, his favorite
scoring area. Also. Clayton Raaka
and Hollis Moore were making
their offensive abilities felt more.
Dallmar says that the scoring bal
ance on this year's team is the
best he's had in several years.
THK INJURY, according to the
Indians' head medicine man, Con
nie Jarvis, presently does not
seriously affect Dose's playing
and is a nuisance rather than a
problem. The knee has been taped
for every game more as protec
tion against further injury and
as an assurance that Dose will not
hestitate to put full weight on it
than as a means of necessary im
mobilization. Jarvis has been giv-

; ing the knee heat and whirlpool
treatments and expects that the
tape will be gradually removed.
Sinee most other schools ait? on
vacation this week, Stanford is
also taking a vacation from work
outs this week and will begin
practicing for its Feb. 7 encounter
| with Washington State next week.
This lay-off gives the injured knee
i a good chance to fully recover.
Dose says his injury is much
beter. It had little chance to im
prove under a constant barrage
of games, but he thinks a week of
rest will do the trick.
ON THE SUBJECT of players
faced this year, he considers Mel
Counts the top foe. Working more
inside this year, ho said the Ore
gon State great was considerably
tougher to stop offensively.
Several days ago, Stanford
played highly-rated Utah on even

I terms until Dose fouled out with
seven minules remaining. In ihe
time ho played, ho scored 23
points, shooting nine of eleven
i from the floor and live of five
from the charity strip. Dallmar
i thinks he eoidd have easily topped
thirty if fouls h;ul not caught up
with him
If the showing against Utah is
an indication, Stanford can look
forward to l'aircr weather. Dose
is ready. The supporting cast of
Hinckley, Bedell, Raaka, and
Moore has been scoring with regu
larity. The team will be rested.
And Washington State a week
from this Friday will hopefully
be the first of a series of future
victims.
