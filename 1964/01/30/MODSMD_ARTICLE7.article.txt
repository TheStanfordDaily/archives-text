# I-Center Exhibits Art Of Grad Student Klein
## 
### ALEC VAN SINDEREN 
This coming Sunday, February
2, from 4 to 6 p.m., the liCenter
will hold a reception for gradu
ate student artist. Irina Klein.
Miss Klein's works are on exhibit
at the I-Center now and will be
up for a week after this Sunday.
This exhibit is the first in a series
at the I-Center.
Miss Klein's use of color might
be defined as somewhat unin
hibited. Although her colors usu
ally stay within their bounds, they
tend to be exaggerated in brilli
ance. Miss Klein often employs a
bright orange or red to make the
top of her paintings stand out
more than the lower portions
especially in her mountain-by-the
sea landscapes, in which she
wants the mountains to appear to
push out and then down in a
dominating fashion.
NIIE FURTHER .justifies her
use of vivid colors by saying that
"otherwise her paintings would
all look a dull blown."
The major portions of her paint
ings are concerned with either
mountain- the <-;i. or a cofnbinn

tion of the two; however, occa
sionally a painting will deal with
a completely unrelated subject.
Miss Klein has given all her
paintings short titles that begin
to explain her topic. She said that
she has tried to be "explanatory
without writing whole para
graphs."
THE EXHIBIT contains not
only some of her recent paintings,
which she has done in her pres
ent quest for a Master's Degree
in Art, but also some of her earl
ier sketches. In this field she has
done many still-lifes and quite a
few scenes concerned with a Mexi
can village. These sketches are
fully true-to-life and not exag
gerated. Again there are a few
scenes which are unrelated to any
of her other sketches. She has
even ventured as far as to make
a sketch of Stanford with Hoover
Tower standing in full glory.
Whether one is looking for
photographically accurate, or
slightly exaggerated, or com
pletely wild art, he will find them
all well represented in Miss
Klein's exhibit.
