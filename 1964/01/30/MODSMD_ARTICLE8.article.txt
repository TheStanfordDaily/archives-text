# LSD Experimenter To Debate at Muir
## 
### 
Dr. Charles Savage, experi
menter with and user of LSD,
will discuss the advisability of
frequent use of the drug on hu
mans with Dr. Leo Holister of
the Veterans Administration Hos
pital. The debate will take place
in the Muir House Lounge, Stern,
at 7 p.m. tonight.
Savage had originally been
scheduled to speak alone. When
the administration discovered
that the user of LSD was to ap
pear on campus advocating the
use of the drug, it insisted that
a partner speaker uphold the op
posing view.
AFTER SOME difficulty, Dan
Prono, Muir House Cultural
Chairman, arranged to have
Holister oppose Savage.
The Debate topic is the title
of the original speach prepared
by Savage, "Idealism and Psy
chopharmocology." After the two
men present their views, there
will be a question and answer
period.
