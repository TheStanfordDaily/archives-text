ALL ABOUT SEX
Within the hounds of Holy Matrimony, sexual relationships between
man and wife are saered, and se\ becomes a unifying and edifying ex
pression of love between two of God's creatures. God lias not intended
that man find sexual expression outside of marriage, and all such sexual
expression is sin in God s sight. Like any other kind of sin, illicit sex
provides pleasure only for a season. Guilt, remorse, and loss of the
ability to give and to love invariably follow.
"Sexual freedom" is a hoax perpetrated on the human race by those
who insist on dragging others along the paths of their own lustiul pur
suits. The fact that sexual expression before marriage (fornication) is
commonplace today, in no way changes God's view of such offenses,
and does not alter the fact that all such sins will be justly and right
eously judged by the Holy God of Creation. The Holy Spirit, through
the Apostle Paul, warns that man's sins have separated him from God,
making it necessary that Christ, the sinless Son of God, suller and die
for them to satisfy God's unswerving terms of justice and holiness. Set
free from the bonds of sin, believers are to always keep in mind that
they have escaped death and Hell:
"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of
God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
nor effeminate (homosexuals), nor abusers of themselves with mankind.
And such were some of you (before you became Christians), but ye
are washed, hut ye are sanctified, but ye are justified, in the name ol
the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God. 1 Cor. 6:9, 1 1.
There is no one in the world who has not sinned. Few are the xirgins
and the chaste who have not committed one or more sexual sins. I he
fact that "All have sinned and come short of the glory ol God sets the
stage for grace. God has made lull provision for each of ns in the
atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ:
"To wit that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto him
self, not imputing their trespasses unto them . . . I ''or he hath made
him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him. II Cor. 5:19, 21.
Condemned by our sins, we are set free by Christ when we commit
our lives to Him. Freed thenceforth from the penalty of sin (death),
we are also enabled by the Holy Spirit to live a moral life thereafter.
Daily victory over lust is possible only through yielding to Christ.
"For God sent not his Son into tin' world to condemn the world;
but that the world through Him might he saved. He that believeth
on Him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is condi inned
already, because he hath not believed on the name ol the only be
gotten Son of God." John 3:17-18.
"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that l>«'-
lievcth not the Son shall not sic life; but the wrath ol Cod abidcth on
him." John 3:36.

expression is sin in God s sight. Like any other kind of sin, illicit sex
provides pleasure only for a season. Guilt, remorse, and loss of the
ability to give and to love invariably follow.
"Sexual freedom" is a hoax perpetrated on the human race by those
who insist on dragging others along the paths of their own lustiul pur
suits. The fact that sexual expression before marriage (fornication) is
commonplace today, in no way changes God's view of such offenses,
and does not alter the fact that all such sins will be justly and right
eously judged by the Holy God of Creation. The Holy Spirit, through
the Apostle Paul, warns that man's sins have separated him from God,
making it necessary that Christ, the sinless Son of God, suller and die
for them to satisfy God's unswerving terms of justice and holiness. Set
free from the bonds of sin, believers are to always keep in mind that
they have escaped death and Hell:
"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of
God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
nor effeminate (homosexuals), nor abusers of themselves with mankind.
And such were some of you (before you became Christians), but ye
are washed, hut ye are sanctified, but ye are justified, in the name ol
the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God. 1 Cor. 6:9, 1 1.
There is no one in the world who has not sinned. Few are the xirgins
and the chaste who have not committed one or more sexual sins. I he
fact that "All have sinned and come short of the glory ol God sets the

atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ:
"To wit that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto him
self, not imputing their trespasses unto them . . . I ''or he hath made
him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him. II Cor. 5:19, 21.
Condemned by our sins, we are set free by Christ when we commit
our lives to Him. Freed thenceforth from the penalty of sin (death),
we are also enabled by the Holy Spirit to live a moral life thereafter.
Daily victory over lust is possible only through yielding to Christ.
"For God sent not his Son into tin' world to condemn the world;
but that the world through Him might he saved. He that believeth
on Him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is condi inned
already, because he hath not believed on the name ol the only be
