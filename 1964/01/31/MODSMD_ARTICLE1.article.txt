# LASSU RELIGION COMMITTEE SUGGESTS:
## 'Sectarian Services Should Be Allowed on Campus' 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
"II is apparent that religion at Stanford is not now meet
ing student needs. Both the opportunity |for| changes and
increases in the entire religious program and policy are
very much in order."
This is i he conclusion of the report of the LASSU Com
mittee on Religion submitted to the Legislature last night.
The report will be discussed and resolutions on it voted
upon at a special meeting of the Legislature next week.
That religious worship for all denominations be allowed
on campus was the prime recommendation of the Com
mittee.
TIIE COMMITTEE also urged the University to con
tinue "it's excellent work in the creation of the Religious
Studies program and in the efforts to expand it,"and sug
gested that the money given to Memorial Church last spring
"be used to expand the staff and programs of Memorial
Church and make them more relevant to the specific needs
of the students."
The report cited two questions which it felt summarized
the religious problem at Stanford:
(It Is the present University policy of prevention of
religious worship on campus, other than those services held
in Memorial Church, consistent with the original desires
of Mrs. Stanford in establishing the "non-denominational"
community?
(2) Does the religious program as a whole satisfy the
needs of the student body?
On the fii'st part, the Committee believes "if the Uni
versity is to have concern for the religious life of its stu
dents, it must do more than simply provide for only one
small segment of the community."
"HAVING ACCESS to religious services off campus is
not enough: the students often feel a lack of relevance to
their own problems and feelings in the older congregations
of off-campus churches, and the access is not an easy one
but involves a heavy expense of time and trouble."

A Committee questionnaire showed a "widespread feel
ing that the religious activities and policies of the Univer
sity were inadequate and unsuited to the present circum
stances."
"That religious services for all faiths are not allowed
(in campus is the most widely expressed student dissatis
faction with religion at Stanford," the report said.
According to the questionnaires, Hie University policy
"not only provides little opportunity for religion, but serves
to stifle much of the interest held by many of the students."
THE HEASONS given for allowing all sects to hold
services on campus were: (1Â» Protestant sectarian services
are now held on campus (the services in Memorial Church),
and CM such a policy would better fulfill the "non-denom
inational" requirements of the Founding Grant.
The report stated: 'the present interpretation does not
seem to be in the spirit intended by Mrs. Stanford. She and
Governor Stanford were extremely religious people. Leland
Stanford often expressed the belief thai 'religion should
be as central to the University as life itself.' "
"Mrs. Stanford," the report admits, "intended Memorial
Church to be Protestant. Yet the spirit was one of revolu
tion and toleration. At the time, all the great private uni
versities except Cornell had religious ties, but she thought
thai a university should not be the agent of any religious
denomination."
THE HIOI'OKT quotes Professor of Religious Studies
Dr. Henry J. Forstman: "Mrs. Stanford lived at a time
when she really thought it would be pan-sectarian lo have
this type of church."
Dr. Robert MacAfee Brown, Professor of Religion, states
that in Mrs. Stanford's era, "an American was regarded
as a Protestant, and members of other religions were re
garded as deviating from the norm. We are now in plurastie
culture with Catholic, Judaism, and Protestantism repre
senting real options for Americans. This fact should be
reflected within the University community."

The Committee feels "the tri-partite of Catholicism,
.Judaism, and Protestantism has come since Mrs. Stanford's
day, and the definition of "non-sectarian" must be reinter
preted within the spirit of the Grant to provide oppor
tunity for religious worship for all students."
"Such a reinterpretation would necessarily allow for
other worship services to be held on the campus."
A University lawyer, Cassius L. Kirk, has expressed the
opinion that the Founding Grant can be reinterpreted to
allow other "sects" to worship on campus.
Till; SKCOND PRO BI ..KM raised in the report was the
relevance of the general religious program to the needs of
the students.
The Stanford students who attended the Ecumenical
Conference at Athens, Ohio last December came back feel
ing the need "for Christian involvement and relevant activ
ism." Ken Stevens, a member of the Athens group and the
head of the student-run interfaith group the Committee on
Religious affairs stated the need for this spirit by the fol
lowing four points:
11 > Memorial Church does not reflect an active Chris
tian attitude of leadership toward the whole community.
Geographically and sybolically, Memorial Church is in a
natural place to exert this leadership.
(2) The role of Memorial Church in campus life should
be more than just the conducting of worship services. The
Church has not been itrvolved in the community. There is a
need for the development of a social awareness: concern
and involvement with the life of the community.
(3> More quest preacher's in residence would help to
develop this social awareness, as would community service
projects, such as aid for East. Palo Alto.
(4) A Christian commitment means the willingness to
be controversial and to question the status quo. The prime
example is Christ.
The repent also stated suggestions for the use of the
Berry money, saying it feels 'Stanford now has a unique

opportunity to correct the deficiencies in its religious pro
gram."
TIIK MONKV, $1.2 million from Mr. and Mrs. Lowell
Berry, was given last spring to strengthen religious pro
grams at Memorial Church. Starting next year, the money
will provide $20-40,000 working income yearly.
The Committee suggested that the money be used:
<li "to provide additional personnel, . . . badly needed
for the Memorial Church staff. The overwhelming demands
on I lie time of the Chaplain and Assistant Chaplain do not
allow them to perform their duties to the extent that they
consider necessary. Additional counseling personnel, for
example, is needed. Chaplains of a number of different
faiths could be added to the staff."
<2> "to support a carefully worked out program of
stimulating guest speakers for Memorial Church. The
speakers might be able to participate in the dormitory
'Guests-in-Residence' programs."
(3) "to finance the acquisition of books for an enlarged
Vestry Library."
(4) "to underwrite a vast number of programs to in
volves the students in problems of the society in which
they live." Such programs, a suggestion of Dr. Robert Mac-
Afee Brown, "should be organized under the leadership of
Memorial Church."
"In order to executive such activities, Memorial Church
needs someone who could devote all of his time to the or
ganization of these programs. Such a person should be
specifically qualified to work with college students in the
administration of programs meant to satisfy their unique
needs."
An appendix to the report, containing a full background
information and the complete results of the Committee sur
vey, will be published soon.
Committee members are: Daniel Schwartz, chairman.
Nancy Coil, Norma Graham, Jim Morgens, and Susan
Evans, secretary.
