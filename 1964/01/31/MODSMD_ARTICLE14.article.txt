# Undefeated Tribe Tests Strong; Club In Weekend Tilt
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
The Stanford rugby team goes
for its third victory agains; club
competition in as many tries
when it plays the Universities
Club of Los Angeles here Satur
day at 1:30 p.m. The Indian rush
ing attack, so impressive last
week, especially in the first half,
should be as effective this week.
Where Stanford falls down scor
ing-wise is in penalty kicks. Al
though Gordon Waddell and Bob
Burke are marksmen at short dis
tances, their ranges are limited.
Coach Pete Kmetovic thinks the
game will be the toughest to date.
The Southerners have disposed of
their two opponents quite hand
ily. USC fell 9-0 and Pomona did
likewise by a 20-6 score. Realizing
his team will have to play two
good halfs of rugby to win, not
just one as it did in its first two
outings Coach Kmetovic has
been working hard on condition
ing this week.
DICK SIIAW and Gordon Wad
dell returned to ihe lineup last
week. This week Dick Ragsdale,
counted on to perform heavy
duties in the fullback position,
has recovered from an operation
and brings the squad to maxi
mum strength for the first time
this year.
Colds in varying degrees have
hindered the effectiveness of
some players, but all apparently
will see action.
The LA ruggers are long on
experience, both foreign and na
tive. From New Zealand, a hot
bed of rugby, comes Ken Allen,
air outstanding scrum half who
directs the rushing attack. Ron
Nisbet. who hails from the other
side of t lie globe in Scotland, bol
ster's the second row.
AMERICAN VETERANS in
clude John Schoethler, who
played second row for Stanford
last year; Fred Shean, a football
and rugby player at UCLA; Barry
Stompe, a first % from Dart
mouth; and John McDonald, a
wing who played for Santa Clara.
Three games will be played Sat
urday. Running simultaneously
with the varsity game will be a
contest between the second JV's
and the second team of the Uni
versities Club of Berkeley. At
3:30 p.m., the first JV squad,
which boasts a win and a tie so
far will match their skill against
Berkeley's first squad.

The Stanford rugby team goes
for its third victory agains; club
competition in as many tries
when it plays the Universities
Club of Los Angeles here Satur
day at 1:30 p.m. The Indian rush
ing attack, so impressive last
week, especially in the first half,
should be as effective this week.
Where Stanford falls down scor
ing-wise is in penalty kicks. Al
though Gordon Waddell and Bob
Burke are marksmen at short dis
tances, their ranges are limited.
Coach Pete Kmetovic thinks the
game will be the toughest to date.
The Southerners have disposed of
their two opponents quite hand
ily. USC fell 9-0 and Pomona did
likewise by a 20-6 score. Realizing
his team will have to play two
good halfs of rugby to win, not
just one as it did in its first two
outings Coach Kmetovic has
been working hard on condition
ing this week.
DICK SIIAW and Gordon Wad
dell returned to ihe lineup last
week. This week Dick Ragsdale,
counted on to perform heavy
duties in the fullback position,
has recovered from an operation
and brings the squad to maxi
mum strength for the first time
this year.
Colds in varying degrees have
hindered the effectiveness of
some players, but all apparently
will see action.
The LA ruggers are long on
experience, both foreign and na
tive. From New Zealand, a hot
bed of rugby, comes Ken Allen,
air outstanding scrum half who
directs the rushing attack. Ron
Nisbet. who hails from the other
side of t lie globe in Scotland, bol
ster's the second row.
AMERICAN VETERANS in
clude John Schoethler, who
played second row for Stanford
last year; Fred Shean, a football
and rugby player at UCLA; Barry
Stompe, a first % from Dart
mouth; and John McDonald, a
