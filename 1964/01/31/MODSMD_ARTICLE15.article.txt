# FROSH JV'S SQUARE OFF AGAIN
## 
### 
This afternoon at 3:30 p.m. in
tho Pavilion tho Stanford Fresh
man team will get their rematch
with the Stanford J.V.'s. Last
Friday the Braves edged the
Frosh 63.19 in overtime.
Last week for the Braves Skip
Hutchison was hitting with
monotonous regularity from tho
outside and Boh Evans poured 18

points through the net in the first
half.
The Frosh aren't going to let
this happen again if they can pos
sibly help it. Coach Turner said
he planned to put constant pres
sure on guards Young and Hutch
inson and also to keep the hall
away from (i' 9" Boh Evans and
thus prevent some of the easy
lay-ins he scored last week.
