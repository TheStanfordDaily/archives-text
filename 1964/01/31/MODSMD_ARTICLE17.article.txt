THE INNER MAN
C ollege is fun and frolic and fulfillment—except for one
melancholy omission: wo don't get to enjoy Mom's home
cooking. (In my own undergraduate days, curiously enough, I
did not undergo this deprivation: my mother, a noted cross
country runner, was never home long enough to cook a meal
until her legs gave out last Arlx>r Day.)
Hut most of us arrive at college with fond gastric memories of
Mom's nourishing delicacies, and we are inclined now and then
to heave great racking sighs a.s we contemplate the steam
tables in the campus cafeteria. Take, for an extreme example,
the case of Finster Sigafoos.
Finstor, a freshman at one of our great Eastern universities
(Oregon State) came to college accustomed to home cooking of
a kind and quantity enjoyed by very few. Until entering
college, Finster had lived all his life in Europe, where his father
was an eminent fugitive from justice. Finster's mother, a
natural horn cook, was mistress of the haute cuisine of a dozen
countries, and Finster grew up living and eating in the Con
tinental manner.
He arose each morning at ten and breakfasted lightly on figs,

hot chocolate, and brioche. (It, is interesting b> note, inciden
tnlly, that brioche was named after its inventor, perhaps tlie
greatest of all French bakers, Jean-Claude Brioche (I1 <>21).
M. Brioche, as we all know, also invented croissants, French
toast, and—in a curious departure—the electric raaor. Other
immortal names in the history of bread stuffs arc the German,
Otto l'umpernickel (1509-1848) who invented pumpernickel
and thus became known to posterity as The Iron Chancellor;
the two Americans, William Cullen Kaisin (Idfid-lNpi) and
Walter liye (1931-1932) who collaborated on the invention oi
raisin rye; and, of course, Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875)
who invented Danish pastry).
But I digress. Finstcr, I say, breakfasted lightly at ten a.m.
At eleven a.m. his Mom brought him his elevenses. At twelve
she brought him his twelvcses. At 1:30 she served his lunch:
lirsl a clear broth; then a fish course (porgy and bass); then an
omelette; then the main course—either a saddle of lamb, an eye
of sirloin, or a glass of chicken fat; then a salad of esoarole; and
finally a lemon souffle.
At three p.m. Mom served Finster low tea, at five p.m. high
tea, and at ten p.m. dinner—first a howl of petite marmite (she
trapped the marmites herself); then a fish course (wounded
trout); then an omelette of turtle eggs; then the main course -
either duck with orange or a basin of farina; then a salad of
unborn chicory; and finally a caramel mousse.
And then Finster went off to college, which reminds me of
Marlboro Cigarettes. (Actually it doesn't remind me of Marl
boro Cigarettes at all, but the makers of Marlboro pay me to
write (his column and they are inclined to get surly if I fail to
mention their product. Mind you, I don't object to mentioning
their product no sir, not one bit. Marlboro's flavor is flavor
ful, the filter filters, the soft pack is soft, the Flip-Top box Hips,
and the tattoo is optional. Marlboro* are available wherever
eigarettes are sold in all fifty states of the Union. Next time
you're in the V.S.A., try a pack.)
Hut I digress. We were speaking of Finster Sigafoo> who went
from Continental dining to dormitory feeding. So whenever
you feel sorry for yourself, think of Finstcr, for it' always lilts
the heart to know somebody is worse off than you arc.

C ollege is fun and frolic and fulfillment—except for one
melancholy omission: wo don't get to enjoy Mom's home
cooking. (In my own undergraduate days, curiously enough, I
did not undergo this deprivation: my mother, a noted cross
country runner, was never home long enough to cook a meal
until her legs gave out last Arlx>r Day.)
Hut most of us arrive at college with fond gastric memories of
Mom's nourishing delicacies, and we are inclined now and then
to heave great racking sighs a.s we contemplate the steam
tables in the campus cafeteria. Take, for an extreme example,
the case of Finster Sigafoos.
Finstor, a freshman at one of our great Eastern universities
(Oregon State) came to college accustomed to home cooking of
a kind and quantity enjoyed by very few. Until entering
college, Finster had lived all his life in Europe, where his father
was an eminent fugitive from justice. Finster's mother, a
natural horn cook, was mistress of the haute cuisine of a dozen
countries, and Finster grew up living and eating in the Con
tinental manner.
He arose each morning at ten and breakfasted lightly on figs,

hot chocolate, and brioche. (It, is interesting b> note, inciden
tnlly, that brioche was named after its inventor, perhaps tlie
greatest of all French bakers, Jean-Claude Brioche (I1 <>21).
M. Brioche, as we all know, also invented croissants, French
toast, and—in a curious departure—the electric raaor. Other
immortal names in the history of bread stuffs arc the German,
Otto l'umpernickel (1509-1848) who invented pumpernickel
and thus became known to posterity as The Iron Chancellor;
the two Americans, William Cullen Kaisin (Idfid-lNpi) and
Walter liye (1931-1932) who collaborated on the invention oi
raisin rye; and, of course, Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875)
who invented Danish pastry).
But I digress. Finstcr, I say, breakfasted lightly at ten a.m.
At eleven a.m. his Mom brought him his elevenses. At twelve
she brought him his twelvcses. At 1:30 she served his lunch:
lirsl a clear broth; then a fish course (porgy and bass); then an
omelette; then the main course—either a saddle of lamb, an eye
of sirloin, or a glass of chicken fat; then a salad of esoarole; and
finally a lemon souffle.
At three p.m. Mom served Finster low tea, at five p.m. high
tea, and at ten p.m. dinner—first a howl of petite marmite (she
trapped the marmites herself); then a fish course (wounded
trout); then an omelette of turtle eggs; then the main course -
either duck with orange or a basin of farina; then a salad of
unborn chicory; and finally a caramel mousse.
And then Finster went off to college, which reminds me of
