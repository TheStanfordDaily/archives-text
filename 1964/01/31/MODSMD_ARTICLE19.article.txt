# THE BELL TELEPHONE COMPANIES SALUTE: DICK PACK
## 
### 
Dick Pack (13.S., Business Technology, 1961) has made a
significant contribution to every job Mountain States Tele
phone has assigned him.
lie was directed to study the effectiveness of new poli
cies on inventory control. So sound were his recommenda
tions that they were passed up the line and considered for
use throughout the Slate of Idaho.
Five months after joining the company, Dick was
named Manager of the Weiser, Idaho, exchange. He ran

his own shop well and, as a result, was promoted to Unit
Manager in Twin Falls. Then, a special honor: enrollment
in the company's course at Northwestern University.
Dick's ability and reputation for quick starting will take
him far with Mountain Stales Telephone.
Dick Pack, like many young men, is impatient to make
things happen for his company and himself. There are
few places where such restlessness is more welcomed or
rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone business.
