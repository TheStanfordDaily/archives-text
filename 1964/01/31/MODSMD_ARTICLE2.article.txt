## 
### ROD PECK 
"There is genuine dissatisfaction with Stanford's religious poli
cies. It is not just an issue in some people's minds,"' stated Dan
Schwartz, LASSU Religion Committee chairman, as he submitted
the report on religion at Stanford to LASSU.
Consideration of proposed changes will begin at the next Legis-

lature meeting. Schwartz, urged,
"Resolutions and mandates from
the student body are vitally
needed and requested. They
should be submitted the Tuesday
prior to the next meeting to be
incorporated into the agenda."
LEGISLATURE S I' LA K L It
Brad Efron called on the repre
sentatives to "reach and inform
their constituents." President Bud
VVedin stated, "A recent meeting
called by the President of the
University revealed that a good
opportunity exists to change some
of the existing policies by the
year's end. An adequate accep
tance of responsibility by stu
dents and Legislature members
can assure this."
An ASSU Investment League
was proposed by Wedin. The Nor
man Crown Foundation has made
available to Stanford $5,000 to be
invested by students in stocks
and bonds to gain knowledge and
experience in the field of invest
ments. Investing clubs would be
formed by the Inter-Club Coun
cil, the Interfraternity Council,
the Student Association of the
Graduate School of Business, the
Inter-House Council, and the As
sociated Women's Students.
BUKKK BUKKIGIIT, By-Laws
Committee Chairman, proposed
the approval of the by-laws of the
Foreign Student Scholarship pro
gram which would bring small
groups of foreign students here
from Japan, Uganda, and Ger
many, the Foreign Student Hous
ing Commission to integrate for
eign students into University
dorms, and the ASSU Student
Travel Service. All were accepted.
Proposed legislative by -1 aw s
changes given first reading includ
ed weekly LASSU m eetings,
changing the legislative methods
to the bill-law method, and publica
tion of principle issues to be con
sidered by LASSU in the Daily two
days prior to meetings. Burke Bur
right, chairman, stated, "We are
concerned about inadequate infor
mation reaching members prior to
meetings and inadequate informa
tion getting back to the student
body after them."
A proposal by the Publication's
Board to create a central book
keeping agency for all Stanford
publications was also read.

sentatives to "reach and inform
their constituents." President Bud

called by the President of the

of the existing policies by the
year's end. An adequate accep
tance of responsibility by stu
dents and Legislature members
can assure this."
