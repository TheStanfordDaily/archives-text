# East Palo Altoâ€”A Deprived Area?
## Guilty Conscience Four Miles Away 
### 
hast Palo Alto is located four geographical miles from Stan
ford University, although the distance between its population
and Stanford s is that between two worlds.
hast Palo Alto is not Mississippi, but the same crime is being
committed there as in the South s worst state: an attack upon
human dignity.
I lie problem of East Palo Alto is a subtle one. It is the prob
lem of the poorly educated rendered useless bv the age of
technology. It is the problem of people living iu an area be
cause others do not want to live there, working not at the jobs
they desire but at those others do not desire. It is the problem
of a twentieth century American citizen who can sav to a col
lege student, 'lam a peasant. It is the paradox of the well
educated Negro lawyer who can say with a surge of personal
victory in his voice, Our people have been answering those
telephones for years, and now I'm going to see them driving
those fancy trucks."
hast Palo Alto lacks the drama of the clear-cut flagranc\
of Mississippi, but it is as embarrassing to attend an hast Palo
Alto NAACP meeting as it is to talk to a Mississippi Negro.
1 he unchecked forces of our time have produced blocs of
human beings who can aspire only to existence without being
able to look inward and see the strengthening vision of their
own self-respect and worth. It is difficult to locate a more elu
sive challenge than the creation of a soeietx where the child
w ho goes to sleep in hast Palo Alto can dream the same dreams
as the one who rests in Menlo Park.
Phrases such as culturally blighted community," "de facto
segregation," "manpower retraining" will never activate the
college student who debates the "thrill of the experience" <>l
working in Mississippi, yet the study of fair housing and fair
employment acts, tutoring, door to door canvassing call upon
the unique resources of the student in the same w ay Southern
voter registration does.
This supplement is not a polemical crusade; it is as factual
a representation of the typo of area that lies nearby most of our
home communities as four months of student research can pro
duce. There is no need to justify the relationship between
Stanford and hast Palo Alto. Awareness is the responsibilit\
of the communicative media, if this responsibility be met in
this case, embarrassment will take over from there and the re
sulting commitment will draw together our two communities.
