# East Palo Alto 'Not Romantic'
## 
### SANFORD M. DORNBUSCH Professor of Sociology 
Last I'alo Alto is not romantic. It is not squalid enough for
Lad\ Bountiful, nor distant enough to ho another world ol
strange native customs. Teaching an apathetic child does not
have the immediate appeal of picketing or petitioning against
our parent-given society.
But a large minority ol Stanford students are there. The)
are an economically privileged group, either through birth or an
anticipation of the Irnits to come. el they have chosen to look
life in the lace, and not to turn a\va\.
There are few simple problems in Last Palo Alto. This spe
cial report has an air of dispassionate commitment, without
tales ol victories. Its lack ol short-run enthusiasm makes me
more hopeful in the long run.
All the circles are vicious. Low motivation, lack of oppor
tunity, and deficient training are mutually reinforcing.
1 11 one circle, lac kof educational aspiration leads to deficient
training, unskilled jobs, low income, segregated housing, little
hope, and lack of educational aspiration in the next generation.
I his chronicle ol local effort shows accelerating change, with
accompanying tension, on main fronts.
These acts express involvement in the lives of other humans.
I here is neither the guilt ol the oppressor nor the desire to do
well by doing good. Human solidarity succeeds race relations
as the theme.
