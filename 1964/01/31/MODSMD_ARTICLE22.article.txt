# What's It Like to Live in East Palo Alto?
## Residents Discuss community's Typical Social, Economic Pressures 
### KAY WEISGERBER 
Hast Palo Alto has often been described as a "culturally
deprived" or "depressed" community. The altitudes of resi
dents in Hast Palo Alto toward the community are vital to
its problems and their potential solution. Interviews and
conversations with several home-owners reveal the social
and economic pressures fell by families in East Palo Alto
and similar suburban communities across the nation.
Over the past fifteen years, the movement of Negroes
to the North and the West has created social and economic
problems in almost every city of the country. The commu
nities of Palo Alto and Hast Palo Alto illustrate this move
ment.
One white couple in Palo Alto Gardens briefly summa
rizes the changes in their section of East Palo Alto since
they arrived in 19."V1. They were aware, they said, of the
influx of Negroes into the communities nearby when they
bought their home. The realtor informed them that the
"line of demarcation" was to the north over in Belle Haven,
which at that time was perhaps 30 per cent Negro. Soon
after they moved in, "block-busting" began in their own
neighborhood, and even the bread man was actively passing
the word on how many Negro families had moved in down
the street. Their street "held out" under the pressure for
three or lour months, and then the "mass panic" began.
Neighbors sold their homes and moved. At present, there
are three white families left on their street.

The movement "upward" from Belle Haven to Palo Alto

VVoodside is an expression of the social mobility which
characterizes American society. The same couple in Palo
Alto Gardens described examples of many friends. Negro
and white, who had moved out of their neighborhood. One
had saved for more than fifteen years and was finally able
to move to the other side of Bayshore, to the Willows.
Another friend, a Negro, evidently a college graduate,
with young children, recently bought a home in Sunnyvale.
He was extremely sensitive to the resentment against him
in the community, but insisted on "getting out" of East
Palo Alto. One other Negro friend saw no problem in the
mass exit. He said he too would move to the other side of
Bayshore if he eoidd afford it.

When questioned about relations with their neighbors,
most people emphasized the lack of social contact. Some
went further to describe the social barriers belween them
and their neighbors. A white home-owner in predominantly
white University Village (which, so he said, has a restric

was in the Village only temporarily and that it was "not
an environment to which lie wanted his children to become
accustomed." He emphasized the drab "lovver-elassishncss"
of t lie neighborhood.
One Negro man also mentioned the social and economic
barriers but told of a spirit of helpfulness among neighbors,
who often lent a hand with leakv plumbing or a stalled car,
with no thought of payment. This Hast Palo Alto resident
was dissatisfied with his neighborhood primarily because
"I am living here solely because of the color of mv skin."
He was also worried that his children would develop
certain attitudes toward themselves and judgments of othei

to note that of the four residents interviewed, two were
completely satisfied with their neighborhoods and had no

This brief portrayal of the opinions and attitudes of a
few East Palo Alto residents toward their neighborhoods
and the problems of the community cannot be taken as a
sample or survey. However, it is interesting and revealing
to note that of the four residents interviewed, two were
completely satisfied with their neighborhoods and had no
intentions of moving. Of the two who did not wish to
remain, one was a Negro in a predominantly Negro neigh
borhood and the other white in an almost completely white
neighborhood.

Hast Palo Alto has often been described as a "culturally
deprived" or "depressed" community. The altitudes of resi
dents in Hast Palo Alto toward the community are vital to
its problems and their potential solution. Interviews and
conversations with several home-owners reveal the social
and economic pressures fell by families in East Palo Alto
and similar suburban communities across the nation.
Over the past fifteen years, the movement of Negroes
to the North and the West has created social and economic
problems in almost every city of the country. The commu
nities of Palo Alto and Hast Palo Alto illustrate this move
ment.
One white couple in Palo Alto Gardens briefly summa
rizes the changes in their section of East Palo Alto since
they arrived in 19."V1. They were aware, they said, of the
influx of Negroes into the communities nearby when they
bought their home. The realtor informed them that the
"line of demarcation" was to the north over in Belle Haven,
which at that time was perhaps 30 per cent Negro. Soon
after they moved in, "block-busting" began in their own
neighborhood, and even the bread man was actively passing
the word on how many Negro families had moved in down
the street. Their street "held out" under the pressure for
three or lour months, and then the "mass panic" began.
Neighbors sold their homes and moved. At present, there
are three white families left on their street.

The movement "upward" from Belle Haven to Palo Alto

characterizes American society. The same couple in Palo

and white, who had moved out of their neighborhood. One
had saved for more than fifteen years and was finally able
to move to the other side of Bayshore, to the Willows.
Another friend, a Negro, evidently a college graduate,
with young children, recently bought a home in Sunnyvale.
He was extremely sensitive to the resentment against him
in the community, but insisted on "getting out" of East
Palo Alto. One other Negro friend saw no problem in the
mass exit. He said he too would move to the other side of
Bayshore if he eoidd afford it.

When questioned about relations with their neighbors,
most people emphasized the lack of social contact. Some

white University Village (which, so he said, has a restric

was in the Village only temporarily and that it was "not
an environment to which lie wanted his children to become

of t lie neighborhood.
One Negro man also mentioned the social and economic
barriers but told of a spirit of helpfulness among neighbors,
who often lent a hand with leakv plumbing or a stalled car,
with no thought of payment. This Hast Palo Alto resident
was dissatisfied with his neighborhood primarily because
