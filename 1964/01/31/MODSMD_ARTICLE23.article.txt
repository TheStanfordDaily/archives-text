# Rumford Act Fails to Halt Discrimination in Housing
## 
### GARY SCHOOLNIK CHRIS BOTSFORD 
Discriminatory practices ij
housing are prevalent in the mid
Peninsula area despite the exist
ence of the recently passed Rum
ford Fair Housing Act.
The problem exists in tw<
forms: real estate practices anc
apartment rentals. According tc
Mrs. Doris Jones, housing chair
man for the Palo Alto chapter oJ
the NAACP, it is possible, onlj
with great difficulty, for a Negrc
to purchase a home in the Pale
Alto area. Typically, real estate
agencies refuse to show homes in
all-white areas to members of a
minority race, or, if a home has
been shown, they may discourage
the prospective buyer by not of
fering the financial assistance us
ually granted lo Caucasians.
Other practices, equally illegal,
according to the Rumford Fair
Housing Act, include momenta
rily taking a house off the mar
ket by explaining to a Negro
buyer that the home has already
been sold, or that the owner has
decided not to sell. However, ac
cording to Mrs. Jones, this is not
a major problem in the Palo Alto
community, because few Negroes
seek the typically older and more
expensive homes in this area.
ALSO, I)UK to recent industrial
developments in the mid-Penin
sula region, where many Negroes
have found employment, apart
ments have been far more in de
mand than permanent housing.
Prospective renters are usually
younger couples, not yet certain
of permanent employment, new to
the community, and without the
capital to buy a home.
Approximately 90 per cent of
the Negroes wanting homes in
this area find themselves in this
situation, and the Fair Emploj'-
ment. Practices Commission has
recently reported that since the
passage of the Rumford Act last
September, -19 of the 52 com
plaints concerned with unfair
housing practices were received
from those seeking apartments
rather than permanent housing.
In most cases the problem is
not created by the owners of the
apartments, but rather by the
managers, who discriminate not
primarily from prejudice but
through fear of losing other ten
ants. As revealed by the NAACP,
Negroes are prevented from rent
ing apartments in much the same
way as they are from buying
houses. For example, the rents
quoted to Negroes are often sig
nificantly higher than for Cauca
sians, and certain restrictive
clauses, not applying to white
renters, are commonly presented
to Negroes.
MRS. JONES related a case
where two Negro gentlemen, af
ter paying a large deposit on an
apartment, were later told they
could not rent because of a deci
sion to limit the apartment to
married couples. The following
day, a white man of approximate
ly the same age and marital sta
tus, was told that the same room,
formerly refused the Negroes,
was now available.
The above discriminatory prac
tices in both housing and the
rental of apartments are prohib

ited by the California Fair Hous
ing Law. This law, moro widely
known as the Huml'ord Act, de
lares that discrimination because
of race, color, religion, national
origin or ancestry in housing ac
commodations is against public
policy in California. It forbids
such discrimination in the sale,
rental, lease or financing of hous
ing, and establishes methods of
preventing and remedying viola
tions.
The Rumford Act and all pres
ent and future state or local fair
housing laws would bo nullified
through a current initiative cam
paign pressed by the California
Real Estate Association, Home
Builders' Association and Apart
ment Owners' Association. The
proposed initiative to cancel the
Rumford Act essentially states
that:
"Neither the State nor any sub
division thereof shall deny, limit
or abridge, directly or indirectly,
the right of any person to decline
to sell, lease or rent any part or
all of his real property to any
person as he, in his absolute dis
cretion, chooses."
The originators of the initiative
claim that property rights are vi
olated by fair housing laws. How
ever, to the contrary, under fair
housing laws owners may sell or
rent to whomever they please, so
long as they do not discriminate
on the basis of race, religion or
national origin. Owners are never
forced to accept buyers or ten
ants who do not qualify person
ally and financially.
THE RUMFORD ACT can only!
be effective in eliminating dis
criminatory practices if it is used.
However, sufficient evidence
must be gathered in order that an
adequate case of violation of the
act can be presented to the
courts.
The Palo Alto chapter of the
NAACP in its investigations com
monly sends to agents Cauca
sians of similar age, financial and
marital status as those thought
to have been discriminated
against. If the Caucasian is
granted housing in a situation in
which it was denied to a Negro
a clear case can l)e brought
against the offender.

formerly refused the Negroes,
was now available.
The above discriminatory prac
tices in both housing and the
rental of apartments are prohib

ited by the California Fair Hous
ing Law. This law, moro widely
known as the Huml'ord Act, de
lares that discrimination because
of race, color, religion, national
origin or ancestry in housing ac
commodations is against public
policy in California. It forbids
such discrimination in the sale,
rental, lease or financing of hous
ing, and establishes methods of
preventing and remedying viola
tions.
The Rumford Act and all pres
ent and future state or local fair
housing laws would bo nullified
through a current initiative cam
paign pressed by the California
Real Estate Association, Home
Builders' Association and Apart
ment Owners' Association. The
proposed initiative to cancel the
Rumford Act essentially states
that:
"Neither the State nor any sub
division thereof shall deny, limit
or abridge, directly or indirectly,
the right of any person to decline
to sell, lease or rent any part or
all of his real property to any
person as he, in his absolute dis
cretion, chooses."
The originators of the initiative
claim that property rights are vi
olated by fair housing laws. How
ever, to the contrary, under fair
housing laws owners may sell or
rent to whomever they please, so
long as they do not discriminate
on the basis of race, religion or
national origin. Owners are never
forced to accept buyers or ten
ants who do not qualify person
ally and financially.
THE RUMFORD ACT can only!
be effective in eliminating dis
criminatory practices if it is used.
However, sufficient evidence
must be gathered in order that an
adequate case of violation of the
act can be presented to the
courts.
The Palo Alto chapter of the
NAACP in its investigations com
monly sends to agents Cauca
sians of similar age, financial and
marital status as those thought
to have been discriminated
against. If the Caucasian is
granted housing in a situation in
which it was denied to a Negro
a clear case can l)e brought
against the offender.
Discriminatory practices ij
housing are prevalent in the mid
Peninsula area despite the exist
ence of the recently passed Rum
ford Fair Housing Act.
The problem exists in tw<
forms: real estate practices anc
apartment rentals. According tc
Mrs. Doris Jones, housing chair
man for the Palo Alto chapter oJ
the NAACP, it is possible, onlj
with great difficulty, for a Negrc
to purchase a home in the Pale
Alto area. Typically, real estate
agencies refuse to show homes in
all-white areas to members of a
minority race, or, if a home has
been shown, they may discourage
the prospective buyer by not of
fering the financial assistance us
ually granted lo Caucasians.
Other practices, equally illegal,
according to the Rumford Fair
Housing Act, include momenta
rily taking a house off the mar
ket by explaining to a Negro
buyer that the home has already
been sold, or that the owner has
decided not to sell. However, ac
cording to Mrs. Jones, this is not
a major problem in the Palo Alto
community, because few Negroes
seek the typically older and more
expensive homes in this area.
ALSO, I)UK to recent industrial
developments in the mid-Penin
sula region, where many Negroes
have found employment, apart
ments have been far more in de
mand than permanent housing.
Prospective renters are usually
younger couples, not yet certain
of permanent employment, new to
the community, and without the
capital to buy a home.
Approximately 90 per cent of
the Negroes wanting homes in
this area find themselves in this
situation, and the Fair Emploj'-
ment. Practices Commission has
recently reported that since the
passage of the Rumford Act last
September, -19 of the 52 com
plaints concerned with unfair
housing practices were received
from those seeking apartments
rather than permanent housing.
In most cases the problem is
not created by the owners of the
apartments, but rather by the
managers, who discriminate not
primarily from prejudice but
through fear of losing other ten
ants. As revealed by the NAACP,
Negroes are prevented from rent
ing apartments in much the same
way as they are from buying
houses. For example, the rents
quoted to Negroes are often sig
nificantly higher than for Cauca
sians, and certain restrictive
clauses, not applying to white
renters, are commonly presented
to Negroes.
MRS. JONES related a case
where two Negro gentlemen, af
ter paying a large deposit on an
apartment, were later told they
could not rent because of a deci
sion to limit the apartment to
married couples. The following
day, a white man of approximate
ly the same age and marital sta

formerly refused the Negroes,
was now available.

minority race, or, if a home has
been shown, they may discourage
the prospective buyer by not of
fering the financial assistance us
ually granted lo Caucasians.
Other practices, equally illegal,
according to the Rumford Fair
Housing Act, include momenta
rily taking a house off the mar
ket by explaining to a Negro
buyer that the home has already
been sold, or that the owner has
decided not to sell. However, ac
cording to Mrs. Jones, this is not
a major problem in the Palo Alto
community, because few Negroes
seek the typically older and more
expensive homes in this area.
ALSO, I)UK to recent industrial
developments in the mid-Penin
sula region, where many Negroes
have found employment, apart
ments have been far more in de
mand than permanent housing.
Prospective renters are usually
younger couples, not yet certain
of permanent employment, new to
the community, and without the
capital to buy a home.
Approximately 90 per cent of
the Negroes wanting homes in
this area find themselves in this
situation, and the Fair Emploj'-
ment. Practices Commission has
recently reported that since the
passage of the Rumford Act last
September, -19 of the 52 com
plaints concerned with unfair
housing practices were received
from those seeking apartments
rather than permanent housing.
In most cases the problem is
not created by the owners of the
apartments, but rather by the
managers, who discriminate not
primarily from prejudice but
through fear of losing other ten
ants. As revealed by the NAACP,
Negroes are prevented from rent
ing apartments in much the same
way as they are from buying
houses. For example, the rents
quoted to Negroes are often sig
nificantly higher than for Cauca
sians, and certain restrictive
clauses, not applying to white
renters, are commonly presented
to Negroes.
MRS. JONES related a case
where two Negro gentlemen, af
ter paying a large deposit on an
apartment, were later told they
could not rent because of a deci
sion to limit the apartment to
married couples. The following
day, a white man of approximate
ly the same age and marital sta
tus, was told that the same room,
formerly refused the Negroes,
was now available.
The above discriminatory prac
tices in both housing and the
rental of apartments are prohib

ited by the California Fair Hous
ing Law. This law, moro widely
known as the Huml'ord Act, de
lares that discrimination because
of race, color, religion, national
origin or ancestry in housing ac
commodations is against public
policy in California. It forbids
such discrimination in the sale,
rental, lease or financing of hous
ing, and establishes methods of
preventing and remedying viola
tions.
The Rumford Act and all pres
ent and future state or local fair
housing laws would bo nullified
through a current initiative cam
paign pressed by the California
Real Estate Association, Home
Builders' Association and Apart
ment Owners' Association. The
proposed initiative to cancel the
Rumford Act essentially states
that:
"Neither the State nor any sub
division thereof shall deny, limit
or abridge, directly or indirectly,
the right of any person to decline
to sell, lease or rent any part or
all of his real property to any
person as he, in his absolute dis
cretion, chooses."
The originators of the initiative
claim that property rights are vi
olated by fair housing laws. How
ever, to the contrary, under fair
housing laws owners may sell or
rent to whomever they please, so
long as they do not discriminate
on the basis of race, religion or
national origin. Owners are never
forced to accept buyers or ten
ants who do not qualify person
ally and financially.
THE RUMFORD ACT can only!
be effective in eliminating dis
criminatory practices if it is used.
However, sufficient evidence
must be gathered in order that an
adequate case of violation of the
act can be presented to the
courts.
The Palo Alto chapter of the
NAACP in its investigations com
monly sends to agents Cauca
sians of similar age, financial and
marital status as those thought
to have been discriminated
against. If the Caucasian is
granted housing in a situation in
which it was denied to a Negro
a clear case can l)e brought
against the offender.
Discriminatory practices ij
housing are prevalent in the mid
Peninsula area despite the exist
ence of the recently passed Rum
ford Fair Housing Act.
The problem exists in tw<
forms: real estate practices anc
apartment rentals. According tc
Mrs. Doris Jones, housing chair
man for the Palo Alto chapter oJ
the NAACP, it is possible, onlj
with great difficulty, for a Negrc
to purchase a home in the Pale
Alto area. Typically, real estate
agencies refuse to show homes in
all-white areas to members of a
minority race, or, if a home has
been shown, they may discourage
the prospective buyer by not of
fering the financial assistance us
ually granted lo Caucasians.
