# East Palo Alto Lots Once Sold for 'Independence'
## 
### BILL SMITH 
Bayshore Freeway cuts down the length of the Pe
ninsula separating and dividing it into two pieces, one
east, one west. Where University Avenue meets the
Freeway, the area designated Palo Alto is cut into two
pieces. They could have been named West Palo Alto
and Palo Alto but instead they were called Palo Alto
and East Palo Alto.
East Palo Alio is an unincorporated area with rough
ly the same boundaries as the Ravenswood Elementary
School Districtâ€”that is, Bay Road, Willow Road, O'Con
nor Street, Marsh Road and San Francisquito Creek.
TWO FACTS are apparent in a discussion of the
problem of East Palo Alto: (1) The Bayshore cuts not
only Palo Alto, but also East Palo Alto into two pieces.
There is an east East Palo Alto and a west East Palo
Alto. (2) East Palo Alto has existed for about forty
years longer than the Freeway. Hence, it is not the area
"east of Bayshore," but all of East Palo Alto, which
must be considered.
The East Palo Alto area, forty years ago, was largely
agricultural. The first subdivision was made in 1910,
though Stanford grads of the Prohibition era can recall
that bootleg whisky was available at Conger's Chicken
Farm even at the end of the 20's. Conger's farm was in
East Palo Alto, and was not the only farm in the area.
In the middle and late 20's, real estate promoters
moved in and began to cut up land into lots and sell
them. The original appeal to buyers in 1910 had been
"one acre and independence" and the aura of that offer
still clung in the 20's. People who wanted to get away

from the city or get: out to the country, people who
wanted to own a piece of land, bought in the area which
was to become East Palo Alto.
For the most part, these were people with small
incomes and big dreams, and the parcels of land were
small, some as small as 12'j feet frontage. The people
were independent. By the 1930's Palo Alto had been
long incorporated and had been building. But the people
of East Palo Alto had opposed incorporation and pre
ferred to be without some conveniences to maintain
their independence.
THE STREETS are narrow in East Palo Alto and
there are no gutters or curbing and little street light
ing. The houses are small to medium in size and so also
are the lots. The area was designed to be a lower and
middle income residential district. Commercial zoning
was planned, but it never worked out.
Until World War 11, East Palo Alto was a white
neighborhood, almost exclusively. Bayshore Highway,
not Freeway yet, was built through the area in 1933,
but did not segregate the people any more than they
had been previously segregated, economically.
The development of East Palo Alto as an integrated
area was sudden. In the early 1950'5, there were a few
Negro families living in the area. But these families
lived in a relatively small, compact area, almost as a
black dot on a white paper. Whether this was by choice,
or because these were the only homes the Negroes could
buy, is now impossible to determine.
But then, in the middle 50's, a Negro family moved
into the area, not where the other Negroes had pre

viously bought, but apart, in an all-white district in East
Palo Alto. And then it began, a technique which has
become known in other areas recently. In Chicago, they
call it "block busting."
A REALTOR, or an integrationist group, moves a
Negro family into a previously all-white neighborhood.
They wait a day or two for the news to get around and
then real estate men move in and pound on doors. Th a
message: Negroes are moving into the area and prop
erty values are going to fall. Soli to me now and I can
get you back your investment, but wait six months and
you'll lose your money.
In 1955. it happened in East Palo Alto. A Negro fam
ily bought a home, and realtors, not those who had been
established in the area but some from out of town,
moved in and made their pitch. Some people paniek.d
and sold at once, others waited, reluctant to sell. The
realtors pushed harder.
Advertisements were sent to Negroes in the Fillmore
district of San Francisco extolling the virtues of the
East Palo Alto area. Free bus rides were arranged for
the Negroes from San Francisco to East Palo Alto, and
then the buses would drive up and down the stree/s
showing East Palo Alto to the occupants of the buses
and showing the occupants of the buses to the residents
of East Palo Alto.
By 1956 a census of part of the area showed that of
1.100 families more than 500 were non-white. Those
whites who still lived in the area stayed because the\
couldn't be panicked and because they liked it in East
Palo Alto. Many are still residents of the area.
