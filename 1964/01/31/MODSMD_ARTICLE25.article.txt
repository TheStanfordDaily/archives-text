# 'WHAT COULD I DO?'
## Employment Survey Conducted to Help East Palo Alto's Jobless 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
"I am conducting a survey for the California
Department of Employment. Is there anyone in
your household who is unemployed or looking for
a better job?"
Volunteers for door-to-door canvassing con
ducted a comprehensive survey of Negro and other
minority group families in East Palo Alto and
East Menlo Park last November. Aimed at im
proving employment possibilities for both work
ers and employers, the survey asked questions de
signed to reveal latent or potential skills. One
proposed use of the results is to set up training
programs.
There is a rich field for such programs in these
areas, as our team of surveyors could see from
our typical district in East Palo Alto.
IT WAS NOT a slum, of course. Every house
had a yard (though most matched the general

shabbiness of the houses), and sometimes there
were two cars in front. And we were invited into
several expensively furnished front rooms. These,
however, were the ones where employment survey
ors couldn't fill out their forms because they were
told, "We're quite satisfied with our jobs."
In others the cramped quarters, the peeling
paint and the omnipresent plastic covers on the
good furniture (to protect it from greasy over
alls) substantiated the figures describing this as
a low-income area.
As surveyors were were treated quite politely
if somewhat warily by men who "never got any
thing from a questionnaire before" or women
who asked, "Will we have to pay to go to school?
Will we really get a job?"
REMEMBERING OIIR instructions from the
training session, we emphasized that nothing was
guaranteed, that time was needed to study the

picture of skills derived from the survey, before
money could be appropriated for night schools,
job training, etc. Other community organizations
which sponsored the survey, however, such as the
NAACP, Community House, and CORE, will at
tempt to match the people surveyed with employ
ers who have their kind of job to offer.
In general, they were more than willing to co
operate with any attempt to improve their skills,
and thereby, their income. But, "I never went past
the sixth grade," said one Negro woman. "I've
never done anything but a little cooking, house
keeping. baby-sitting for other people . . . you
know. What could I do?" One of the questions on
the survey form brought out her ambition. "Well,
if I could be trained, you know 1 always wanted to
work in a beauty parlor. I know I could work
with hair. Or maybe learn to type." But there
was another problem: "Here I've got four kids,
we can't afford a baby-sitter, how can I go to
school regular? Maybe at night . .
"Sure I'd take training." said a steel worker.
How am I going to get anywhere whore 1 am
ow?"
Education (or lack of it) is one reason that
lany we're not working up to the level for which
heir skills equipped them. This was the situation
112 one unemployed young man. who had been a
inotypist in the service; he had worked a great
"eal with communications equipment, he said. "I'd
'ke to get a job in an electronics outfit—l could
'o the work but I haven't got a diploma." He had
•pent a few months taking technical courses at a
unior college.
In our district the average level of education
attained was a couple of years in high school. Few
eported any kind of extensive training for their
? obs. To the question, How long did it take you
o learn the skills required by your current job?
The women, in particular (most of whom worked

as cleaning women, baby-sitters and occasionally
filing clerks), would answer with a shrug of the
shoulders, "Ilmmm, an hour or two, they showed
us around. What do you expect?"
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION in employment
procedures was rarely mentioned. "If you are not
now working at a job which does not require your
highest skills, what reasons can you give?" v\ s
one of the survey questions. The fact that the
answer usually was concerned with education (no
diploma, for instance) rather than actual discrimi
nation seems to indicate that any discrimination
that i.s practiced in East Palo Alto is at an earlier
stage than employment.
Where this earlier stage might be was dis
cussed by one of the most frank and interesti g
men we interviewed, a bearded artist on crutches,
his legs shriveled from an accident.
WE WALKED into the living room, where
paintings were hung all over the walls; they had
just been returned from the man's first one-man
show. "But 1 need a regular source of income," he
said. "I love to paint" (that was evident» "but you
can't depend on the market. I've been looking 1 r
something a handicapped man could do . .
Something like linotyping he could learn, he said,
or he would be willing to work as a commercial
artist.
What about his high school education? What
kind of course had he taken? "College prep?" he
said. "No. They won't even let us fellows into
those courses. Figure we won't ever amount o
anything, anyway. Vocational? All there was in
that area was a few shop courses, and I was no
good for those.
"That's why I decided to take as many art
courses as I could. Painting is one work I can do
and be sure that the 1 judgment of it is based on
its merit and not the color of my skin. There's no
discrimination in art "


COME RIGHT IN, THE LORD WELCOMES EVERYONE': First Mis

windowless white building. It was Sunday afternoon; we hap
pened to walk by the "store-front church" while working for an
employment survey in East Palo Alto.
"Shall we go in?"
Across the wall hung a banner with a quotation from the Bible
and the "covenant" of the church printed in red letters. "For God
so loved the world . . Yellow streamers hung from the ceiling.

Attention was focused not on one minister but on a group of
five young men. Apart from their surroundings they would have
been taken for a rock-and-roll group, by their voices and electric
guitars.
They played and sang several hymns in sort of a mixed country
rock-and-roll style; in between one of them would give a short talk
on the goodness and mercy of the Lord, or what religion meant to
him, or something similar. Every sentence was ended with an
"A-men' or "Praise the Lord fiom a group of old women against
the wall.

Attention was focused not on one minister but on a group of
five young men. Apart from their surroundings they would have
been taken for a rock-and-roll group, by their voices and electric

"I am conducting a survey for the California
Department of Employment. Is there anyone in
your household who is unemployed or looking for
a better job?"
Volunteers for door-to-door canvassing con
ducted a comprehensive survey of Negro and other
minority group families in East Palo Alto and
East Menlo Park last November. Aimed at im
proving employment possibilities for both work
ers and employers, the survey asked questions de
signed to reveal latent or potential skills. One
proposed use of the results is to set up training
programs.
There is a rich field for such programs in these
areas, as our team of surveyors could see from
our typical district in East Palo Alto.
IT WAS NOT a slum, of course. Every house
had a yard (though most matched the general

shabbiness of the houses), and sometimes there
were two cars in front. And we were invited into
several expensively furnished front rooms. These,
however, were the ones where employment survey
ors couldn't fill out their forms because they were
told, "We're quite satisfied with our jobs."
In others the cramped quarters, the peeling
paint and the omnipresent plastic covers on the
good furniture (to protect it from greasy over
alls) substantiated the figures describing this as
a low-income area.
As surveyors were were treated quite politely
if somewhat warily by men who "never got any
thing from a questionnaire before" or women
who asked, "Will we have to pay to go to school?
Will we really get a job?"
REMEMBERING OIIR instructions from the
training session, we emphasized that nothing was
guaranteed, that time was needed to study the

picture of skills derived from the survey, before
money could be appropriated for night schools,
job training, etc. Other community organizations
which sponsored the survey, however, such as the
NAACP, Community House, and CORE, will at
tempt to match the people surveyed with employ
ers who have their kind of job to offer.
In general, they were more than willing to co
operate with any attempt to improve their skills,
and thereby, their income. But, "I never went past
the sixth grade," said one Negro woman. "I've
never done anything but a little cooking, house
keeping. baby-sitting for other people . . . you
know. What could I do?" One of the questions on
the survey form brought out her ambition. "Well,
if I could be trained, you know 1 always wanted to
work in a beauty parlor. I know I could work
with hair. Or maybe learn to type." But there
was another problem: "Here I've got four kids,
we can't afford a baby-sitter, how can I go to
school regular? Maybe at night . .
"Sure I'd take training." said a steel worker.
How am I going to get anywhere whore 1 am

•pent a few months taking technical courses at a
unior college.
In our district the average level of education
attained was a couple of years in high school. Few
eported any kind of extensive training for their
? obs. To the question, How long did it take you
o learn the skills required by your current job?
The women, in particular (most of whom worked

as cleaning women, baby-sitters and occasionally
filing clerks), would answer with a shrug of the
shoulders, "Ilmmm, an hour or two, they showed
us around. What do you expect?"
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION in employment
procedures was rarely mentioned. "If you are not
now working at a job which does not require your
highest skills, what reasons can you give?" v\ s
one of the survey questions. The fact that the
answer usually was concerned with education (no
diploma, for instance) rather than actual discrimi
nation seems to indicate that any discrimination
that i.s practiced in East Palo Alto is at an earlier
stage than employment.
Where this earlier stage might be was dis

COME RIGHT IN, THE LORD WELCOMES EVERYONE': First Mis
sion Baptist Church — Services, Sunday morning, afternoon and
evening," read the sign on the little ordinary-looking, practically
windowless white building. It was Sunday afternoon; we hap
pened to walk by the "store-front church" while working for an
employment survey in East Palo Alto.
"Shall we go in?"
Across the wall hung a banner with a quotation from the Bible
and the "covenant" of the church printed in red letters. "For God
so loved the world . . Yellow streamers hung from the ceiling.

Attention was focused not on one minister but on a group of
five young men. Apart from their surroundings they would have
been taken for a rock-and-roll group, by their voices and electric
guitars.
They played and sang several hymns in sort of a mixed country
rock-and-roll style; in between one of them would give a short talk
on the goodness and mercy of the Lord, or what religion meant to
him, or something similar. Every sentence was ended with an
"A-men' or "Praise the Lord fiom a group of old women against

"I am conducting a survey for the California
Department of Employment. Is there anyone in
your household who is unemployed or looking for
a better job?"
Volunteers for door-to-door canvassing con
ducted a comprehensive survey of Negro and other
minority group families in East Palo Alto and
East Menlo Park last November. Aimed at im
proving employment possibilities for both work
ers and employers, the survey asked questions de
signed to reveal latent or potential skills. One
proposed use of the results is to set up training
programs.
There is a rich field for such programs in these
areas, as our team of surveyors could see from
our typical district in East Palo Alto.
IT WAS NOT a slum, of course. Every house
had a yard (though most matched the general

shabbiness of the houses), and sometimes there
were two cars in front. And we were invited into
several expensively furnished front rooms. These,
however, were the ones where employment survey
ors couldn't fill out their forms because they were
told, "We're quite satisfied with our jobs."
In others the cramped quarters, the peeling
paint and the omnipresent plastic covers on the
good furniture (to protect it from greasy over
alls) substantiated the figures describing this as
a low-income area.
As surveyors were were treated quite politely
if somewhat warily by men who "never got any
thing from a questionnaire before" or women
who asked, "Will we have to pay to go to school?
Will we really get a job?"
REMEMBERING OIIR instructions from the
training session, we emphasized that nothing was
guaranteed, that time was needed to study the

picture of skills derived from the survey, before
money could be appropriated for night schools,
job training, etc. Other community organizations
which sponsored the survey, however, such as the
NAACP, Community House, and CORE, will at
tempt to match the people surveyed with employ
ers who have their kind of job to offer.
In general, they were more than willing to co
operate with any attempt to improve their skills,
and thereby, their income. But, "I never went past
the sixth grade," said one Negro woman. "I've
never done anything but a little cooking, house
keeping. baby-sitting for other people . . . you
know. What could I do?" One of the questions on
the survey form brought out her ambition. "Well,
if I could be trained, you know 1 always wanted to
work in a beauty parlor. I know I could work
with hair. Or maybe learn to type." But there
was another problem: "Here I've got four kids,
we can't afford a baby-sitter, how can I go to
school regular? Maybe at night . .
"Sure I'd take training." said a steel worker.
How am I going to get anywhere whore 1 am

In our district the average level of education
attained was a couple of years in high school. Few
eported any kind of extensive training for their
? obs. To the question, How long did it take you
o learn the skills required by your current job?
The women, in particular (most of whom worked

as cleaning women, baby-sitters and occasionally
filing clerks), would answer with a shrug of the
shoulders, "Ilmmm, an hour or two, they showed
us around. What do you expect?"
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION in employment
procedures was rarely mentioned. "If you are not
now working at a job which does not require your
highest skills, what reasons can you give?" v\ s
one of the survey questions. The fact that the
answer usually was concerned with education (no
diploma, for instance) rather than actual discrimi
