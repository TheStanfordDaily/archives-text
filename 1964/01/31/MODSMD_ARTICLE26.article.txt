A comparison of the racial, po
itical and socio-economic statis
ics of Palo Alto and East Palo

"rices between the two areas.

ibout 2% per cent are Negro.
IHast Palo Alto is an unincorpo
rated area with about 12,000 pop
ulation and almost 35 per cent
Negro. Additionally Palo Alto
'ias another minority population
Troup of about 2 1 L- per cent, in
cluding Orientals, foreign - born
'iti/ens, etc. East Palo Alto has
in additional 10 per cent minority

Troup.
Politically the two areas are
quite different. Almost 50 per
cent of Palo Alto residents are
registered to vote (23,890), while
in East Palo Alto only about 32
per cent are registered (4,148).
On the party spectrum East Palo
Alto falls more to Ihe left and
Palo Alto more to the right.
| According to Harry Bre
nion<l, Civil Rights Attorney,
the Democratic party is the
only possible party for the. Ne

gro and minority community in
Kast Palo Alto. "The district
representative, a Republican,
lias voted against every Civil
Rights measure l>efore Con
gress." Rremond explains that
the 2(»th District which includes
Fast Palo Alto is split about 60-
•10 in favor of the Republicans.)
Roughly 60 per cent of the reg
istered voters in the city of Palo
Alio are Republicans (13,868),
while East Palo Alto registered

Part of the explanation of the
low number oi people who are
registered lo vote in East Palo
Alio is related lo age. The me
dian age for whites is 27.6 years
for men and 28 years for women,
but for non-whites Ihe median
ages are 20.9 for men and 21 for
women. More than 4,500 people
in the East Palo Alio area are
under 18 years.
Another explanation for the
low voter registration might be
the question of transcieney in
East Palo Alto. The census rec
ords show that of 9,600 persons
questioned, over 6,300 had not

j lived in the same house for the
j past five years.
BOTH PALO ALTO and East
Palo Alto have high records of
educational systems. The modi n
high school completion in their
number of years of schooling for
East Palo Alto residents is 11.5.
This is close to the 90 per cent
level of high school graduates in
the City of Palo Alto. However,
Ihe number of high school gradu
ates who go on to college fn ..a
Easl Palo Alio is considerably
loss than the 75-85 per cent from
Palo Alio who continue their
st udics.
This difference between the two
areas is reflected in the incomes
of families living there. The me
dian family income in East P; .0
Alto is $6,517, while lhat of Palo
Alto is half again as much, $10,-
727.
Since Ihe family factor in East
Palo Alto is 3.31 and that <»112 Palo
Alto is slightly lower at 3.21, the
per capita income ratio of Ea'-Jt
Palo Alto to Palo Alto is ev<_n
less favorable. Per capita income
in East Palo Alto is $1,970 as
compared to $3,169 in Palo Alto.
