# CHANGING CLIMATE:
## Business Seeks Negroes—Too Few Have Sufficient Training 
### JANET BOSS 
Robert Toye's recently created position of "mi
nority specialist" for the Palo Alto State Employ
ment Office typifies an emerging national outlook
in civil rights.
For the first time in our country's history, em
ployers are actively seeking minority group work
ers; for the first time in history the demand for
Negro employees is greater than the supply of
qualified applicants. Jobs are ready now, but Ne
groes are not.
This is the ironic outcome of the furor over
civil rights. For even as civil rightists marched
on Washington for "jobs and freedom," staged
"sit-ins" at the New York and Los Angeles City
Halls in demand for more construction jobs, pick
eted Chicago restaurants and boycotted stores in
Philadelphia— businesses from New York to Cali
fornia began asking for help in integrating their
work forces.
TO MEET THE demand, many employment
agencies reorganized personnel and policy, estab
lishing such positions as "minority specialist." As
a minority specialist, Toye assists employers in
finding applicants for jobs, helps plan appropriate
training programs for unskilled and semi-skilled
workers and counsels members of minority groups
who are seeking employment. The tall, soft
spoken Negro is an English major from Morgan
State College in Maryland. He worked for the San
Jose employment Agency before coming to Palo
Alto.
Because Toye is a member of a minority group,
his employment itself meets the needs of a chang
ing climate. Civil rights leader Louis E. Lomax
stresses, "Nobody speaks for the Negro, but the
Negro himself."
BEFORE LAST OCTOBER, when the Palo
Alto office created the position of minority spe
cialist. California Fair Employment Practice laws
prohibited employers from requesting or exclud
ing workers of a certain race or religion. Now,
however, an employer may ask for a minority
group, but he still may not exclude any. "We take
an order only if the employer agrees to interview
all applicants," says Toye. The Palo Alto agency
worked with the NAACP. the Fair Employment
Practices Commission, legal and civil groups to
make these arrangements.
Also before October, it was against the FEP
laws to keep any record of an applicant's race or
religion in the employment office. Further ar
rangements were made with the NAACP and the
FEPC allowing the minority specialist to keep a
3x5 card file of minority group applicants. Each
card includes the person's name, minority group
identification, experience and skills.
National and local concern for minority unem
ployment has encouraged more people to seek
help in finding jobs. "Through contact with civil
rights groups and the influence of national events,
numbers have increased," says Toye. "But we still
do not have as many applicants as we would like."
TOYE ESTIMATES the Palo Alto minority
group population, which is predominantly Negro,
to be 12,000. Kenneth Smith of the Bay Area
Urban League adds that "minority group unem
ployment around the Peninsula is twice that of
white unemployment," the same as the national
estimate.
Each day.the minority specialist receives re
quests for workers and attempts to match them
with applicants on file. He first tries to deter
mine whether the employer legitimately wants to
integrate his work force or simply plans to keep
Negroes in traditional unskilled occupations or
"dead-end" jobs for "show."
"We have never run into an employer who
needs someone who can type 60 words a minute
but says he'll take a minority worker who can
type 45," says Toye.
TOYE DIVIDES his small 3x5 file into four
major categories:
1) Applicants with a good education but no
salable skills; teachers, for example, who have at
tended schools in other states and need California
certificates.
2> Those with salable qualities but who cannot
find any openings.
3) Underemployed, those who possess higher
skills than they are presently using; domestics
or waitresses, for example, who are trained in
clerical work.
4) Unqualified, those with no salable skills.
"This is the largest group" and includes those who
cannot even fill out an application form, high
school students who have no idea what they want
to do and those displaced by automation or injury.
This large percentage of unskilled workers in
the Palo Alto minority group file forces California
to join the nationwide cry, "Our biggest problem
is finding qualified applicants."
ONE EXPLANATION FOR the shortage of
qualified applicants is that employers for the first
time are willing to hire minority group members
in a wide range of occupations, not only in tradi
tional janitorial and domestic service.
Employers are seeking Negro stenographers,
typists, welders and teachers, but minority groups
have not had the opportunity to be trained in
many of these fields. For this reason, Dr. William
Stuart Nelson, vice president of Howard Univer
sity. is encouraging his Negro college to re-exam
ine its curricula: "We must be alert to the vastly
increasing categories of skills and vocational op
portunities which will be available to the gradu
ates of the 1 960's little dreamed-of a few years

ago."
Automation compounds the problem of Negro
unemployment and increases the growing recog
nition of the need for training. A man from Mis
sissippi who worked for fifteen years in a mop
factory chopping broomstick handles recently
moved to East Palo Alto. With no such jobs in
existence any more, the man needs counseling and
training before he can find new employment.
Another explanation for both unemployment
and underemployment is lack of drive on the part
of Negro youth. A recent survey in East Palo
Alto shows some young people hesitant to come
to the employment office because they are not yet
concerned about jobs.
ONE 20YEAK01 I> boy, according to his fa
th, "just doesn't realize that he has to fight for a
place in the world." The son is content with jani
torial work while his father holds down two jobs
at night and goes to school during the day. reading
for law. One discouraged 21-year-old girl says she
had wanted to take an IBM training program, but
a friend who paid $200 for a six-week private busi
ness college course and was promised placement
still hasn't found a job.
Automation and lack of education and drive
fail to explain adequately all cases of minority
group unemployment. When questioned further,
Toye sets his jaw, compressing his already slight
moustache, and finally adds, "You can't under
estimate the role of discrimination in preventing
Negroes from getting jobs. If you walk into sev
eral businesses in the Bay Area, and find no Negro
supervisors, yet several Negro workers, over a
period of time you can't help but come to the con
clusion that percentage-wise, systematic discrimi
nation must be in practice."
National statistics indicate that Negroes com
pose only 7 per cent of the managerial and techni
cal work force in the country.
NATHAN GLAZKB, in his book "Beyond the
Melting Pot," claims, "Negroes at the same levels
of education as whites do not get as good jobs, as
high incomes. These are still the crude, brute
facts of discrimination." Glazer says the history
of discrimination will remain the underlying rea
son for Negro unemployment; "it has made the
Negro unequal to today's promise of equal oppor
tunity'."
However, hesitating to cite discrimination as
the main cause of today's minority group unem
ployment, Toye prefers to emphasize the problem
of inadequate and inappropriate skills.
An official at Lockheed says that the company
has "many openings for which we'd we thrilled to
have qualified people—Negro or white. But we
find so few Negroes qualified for a highly techni
cal or skdled job."
A Bay Area utility company reports that it
asked NAACP to help find Negro workers for
skilled jobs. "The NAACP sent 30 applicants.
Fourteen failed the first test; all the others failed
subsequent tests."
Colleges and universities are also swamped by
recruiting agents looking for capable Negroes.
According to Stanford University's Director of
Business and Technical Placement, William Lowe,
there has been a definite upswing this fall in re
quests for Negro graduates from Stanford and the
University of California. "However, both schools
have few Negro graduates." Lowe adds, "For the
Negro college graduate who is trained in a spe
cific area, there is no job problem; we find more
prejudice against women than against members of
minority groups."
NEGRO ANI) WHITE leaders throughout the
country endorse one solution for the unbalanced
supply and demand situation— education. Accord
ing to President Johnson, "We are really doing
very little for people if we open up to them the
finest jobs in our factories and in our industrial
establishments, if we do not: make available to
them the training that will permit them to qualify
for those jobs."
Lomax suggests "study-ins" for young Negroes
"who aren't ready." "The Negro community must
launch "study-ins" that, involve both vocational
guidance and academic preparation . . . like the
'sit-ins,' they must become an article of faith, a
folk covenant between the students and their
teachers."
Steps are under way to upgrade minority group
skills. The Federal Government is encouraging re
training programs under the new Manpower De
velopment and Training Act, the first nationwide
attempt to help workers meet rapid technological
changes.
THE ACT, which became effective in July, 1962,
allows training programs on the local level. The
Palo Alto Employment Agency recently started a
16-week program in typing. It has conducted other
courses in general office work, sales, photography,
nurses' aid work, gardening, reporting and house
keeping.
Bay Area interest in training programs is high,
according to Toye. Naturally, he admits, partici
pants are often concerned with whether or not
they will qualify for or find a job after the train
ing and how they will live while taking the day
time courses. A trainee who is the head of a house
rold receives benefits under the Manpower Act
equal to the state's unemployment benefits for up
to 52 weeks. The California state retraining act
also provides regular unemployment pay for work
ers while they are taking approved courses.
It is the minority high school students who are
having the greatest difficulty finding employment
and qualifying for training benefits. Toye e^ti

mates the Negro high school unemployment rate
to be as high as 70 per cent. He recommends that
drop-outs take a five-test examination which, if
passed with a certain percentile score, is equiva
lent to a high school diploma in the eyes of many
employers.
AN EMPLOYMENT REPRESENTATIVE from
the Palo Alto agency encourages the students to
continue their education, helps them to find part
time jobs to supplement their income and thus
eliminates their main reason for dropping out of
school.
The changing national and local climate indi
cates there has never been more opportunity for
education and training of minority groups; never
a more favorable environment for minority ad

vancement. Progress in education and employ
ment promises to improve the whole Negro way of
life. The social remedy seems lo lie in improving
the existing FEP laws and practices, special train
ing and recruiting programs and revision of pub
lic school programs.
The goal of civil rights efforts in the Bay Area
and across the nation has become integration in
the American economic life. As Lomax says,"The
entire Negro community, and the white community
as well, must now become involved in an all-out
effort to prepare our youth for life and work in
the American mainstream."
Civil rightists aim to meet the demands of the
world where competence, not color, will be the
overriding criterion.
