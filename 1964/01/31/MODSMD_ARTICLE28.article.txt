# NAACP, CORE Seek Student Aid
## 
### 
Local NAACP and' CORE
groups are seeking students to
help them in their recently com
bined efforts to eliminate the
problem of minority group un
employment.
The new Screening and Re
sources Committee headed by
Zedo Milton organizes interviews
every Saturday with the unem
ployed men and women who come
to the East Palo Alto Community
House looking for jobs. The in
terviewers explain what the po
tential workers should know
when asking for a job and help
them to fill out a sample appli
cation.
The unemployed person an
swers a questionnaire on his qual
ifications from which the inter
viewer may suggest t raining
courses or "help to pull out his
high points," explains Milton.
IN ADDITION, the committee
provides a check list of items con
cerning appearance. "Is the ap
plicant dressed neatly? Are his
shoes shined, nails trim?"
Milton explains that the appear
ance form is filled out by one ap
plicant on another which "be
comes amusing and eliminates
possible hard feelings. If we have
two applicants, Sally May fills out
the form on Jimmy Jones and
vice versa."
These interviews are not com
plete; testing and final decisions
are left up to the employer, Milton
adds. "We try to send at least five
applicants to each job opening."
A FT E R THE INTERVIEWS
the applicants are checked on the
basis of experience. Job opportu
nities are referred to the Commu
nity House by Robert Toye, mi
nority specialist for the Palo Alto
State Employment. Office. A num
ber of employers also call the
Community House.
According to Milton the Screen
ing and Resources Committee was
organized to meet a great need.
Minority group workers were
seeking jobs and complaining
about discrimination.
When the NAACP Grievance
and Negotiating Committee talked !
to employers about hiring minor- 1
ity workers, the personnel mana-1
gers reported none on file. "So I
we set out to get some on file," I
says Milton. (
