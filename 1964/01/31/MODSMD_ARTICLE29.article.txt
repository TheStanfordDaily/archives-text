# Negro Population on Rise; Job Opportunities Lacking
## 
### SHEILA RICKETTS 
The Negro population of the
State of California increased
sevenfold between 1940 and 1960
while the white population little
more than doubled, according to
a recent report, "Negro Califor
nians," by the Division of Fair
Employment Practices of the
State Department of Industrial
Relations.
This increase, clue to the "mi
gration of hundreds of thousands
of Negroes away from the rural
South and into the urban centers
of the North and West," was ac
companied by a number of serious
socio-economic problems includ
ing lower educational levels and
high unemployment rates among
the non-white citizens of the
state.
To meet some of these prob
lems, California passed a fair em
ployment law in 1959 and a Fair
Employment Practice Commis
sion was established. This Com
mission compiled the report on

the basis of the 1960 census.
THE REPORT shows that "un
employment rates for nonwhite
men in 1960 were approximately
twice those for white men." Those
Negroes who were employed
tended to be concentrated in cer
tain industries and occupations.
Thirty-seven point two per cent
of employed Negro women, for
example, were domestics or were
otherwise engaged in personal
services while only 2.2 per cent
had jobs in finance, insurance
and real estate, compared with
7.8 per cent of employed white
women.
According to the statistics, "20.9
per cent of employed white men
in the State were craftsmen, fore
men, and kindred workers, while
13.3 per cent of employed Ne
groes were in that category.
"Those who w ere laborers
(other than farm or mine), how
ever, constituted 5.6 per cent of
the white and 17.8 per cent of the
Negroes."
THESE OCCUPATIONAL dif
ferences do not completely reflect
income differences, however, for
while the average income for all
male professional and technical
workers in 1959 was $7,403, non
white men in this classification
averaged only $5,993.
"Median income for all white
males was $5,109, compared with
$3,553 for Negro males; for white
women it was $1,812, compared
with $1,596 for Negro women."
Governor Edmund G. Brown
was quoted: "Hundreds of thous
ands of our citizens still are tho
victims of social, economic, and
educational disadvantage." The
report includes tables which give
"a gross measure of the disad
vantages affecting Negroes as a
group in California at the begin
ning of this decade.

"a gross measure of the disad
vantages affecting Negroes as a
group in California at the begin
ning of this decade.
The Negro population of the
State of California increased
sevenfold between 1940 and 1960
while the white population little
more than doubled, according to
a recent report, "Negro Califor
nians," by the Division of Fair
Employment Practices of the
State Department of Industrial
Relations.
This increase, clue to the "mi
gration of hundreds of thousands
of Negroes away from the rural
South and into the urban centers
of the North and West," was ac
companied by a number of serious
socio-economic problems includ
ing lower educational levels and
high unemployment rates among
the non-white citizens of the
state.
To meet some of these prob
lems, California passed a fair em
ployment law in 1959 and a Fair
Employment Practice Commis
sion was established. This Com
mission compiled the report on

the basis of the 1960 census.
THE REPORT shows that "un
employment rates for nonwhite
men in 1960 were approximately
twice those for white men." Those
Negroes who were employed
tended to be concentrated in cer
tain industries and occupations.
Thirty-seven point two per cent
of employed Negro women, for
example, were domestics or were
otherwise engaged in personal
services while only 2.2 per cent
had jobs in finance, insurance
and real estate, compared with
7.8 per cent of employed white
women.
According to the statistics, "20.9
per cent of employed white men
in the State were craftsmen, fore
men, and kindred workers, while
13.3 per cent of employed Ne
groes were in that category.
"Those who w ere laborers
(other than farm or mine), how
ever, constituted 5.6 per cent of
the white and 17.8 per cent of the
Negroes."
THESE OCCUPATIONAL dif
ferences do not completely reflect
income differences, however, for
while the average income for all
male professional and technical
workers in 1959 was $7,403, non
white men in this classification
averaged only $5,993.
"Median income for all white
males was $5,109, compared with
$3,553 for Negro males; for white
women it was $1,812, compared
with $1,596 for Negro women."
Governor Edmund G. Brown
was quoted: "Hundreds of thous
ands of our citizens still are tho
victims of social, economic, and
educational disadvantage." The
report includes tables which give
"a gross measure of the disad
