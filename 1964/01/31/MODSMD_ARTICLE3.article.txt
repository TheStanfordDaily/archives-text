# Stanford Study Shows Students Dissatisfied
## 
### AL ANDERSON 
A recently released report on student communications at Stan-1
; ford indicates that students are dissatisfied with many University i
policies particularly those dealing with rushing, liquor, and politi-!
cal activity. The survey also shows that the Stanford Daily is the
I students' most commonly used source of reliable information.

THE STUDY was prepared foH
the Communications Committee
of Stanford Associates by the In
stitute for Communications Re
search. It is the work of Richard
F. Carter, Assistant Professor of
Communications, and George
Comstock, a research assistant at
the Institute. Stanford Associates,
together with the University, pro
vided financial support for th e
project.
The information was obtained
from a probability sample of 1,193 j
Stanford students, both under
graduate and graduate. A total!
of 956 students responded to the!
questionnaire. Their a n s we r s j
wore coded and punched onto j
IBM cards. The results were then j
tabulated and analyzed with the ;
aid of electronic computors.
THK STUDENTS questioned
expressed a general dissatisfac :
tion with University policies. Sur
vey participants were asked to
rate various university policies
on a numerical scale from 1 < Bad)
to 7 (Good). The policies on stu
dent dress and selection of over
seas students received the high
est ratings especially from under
graduate students. The policies
for academic counseling and off
campus parties were generally
rated at the middle of the scale.
"The rest of the policies," states
the report, "were rated below the
middle, on the 'bad' side." The
low ratings on political activity
policies were found to be "near
unanimous."
STUDENT GOVERNMENT at
Stanford was given an unfavor
able rating by the survey partici
pants. Male students, particularly
the undergraduates, were especi
ally critical. It was also found
that there is a decreasing desire
among students to seek out mem
bers of student government for
discussion of University policies.
"This change," the researchers
stated, "is rather important if stu
dent government is considered to
be an appropriate forum for pol
icy affecting the student."
Both undergraduate and grad
uate students reported that they
regularly read the Daily and used
it as their major source of infor-;
mation about University policies
and student activities. Under- j
graduates were found to be more
likelj to read the Daily than some
other daily newspaper. Graduate
students, on the other hand, were
found to be more regular readers j
of outside newspapers than under
graduate students.
The survey found that Stanford
students' knowledge of University
finances was "overwhelmingly in
accurate." They appear to know
very little about the sources ot
Income and the uses to which it
is put. The survey indicates thai

students who plan to join the j
Alumni Association are morel
likely to make financial contri
but ions to Stanford after gradua
tion. These students usually gave
as their reason the improvement :
of Stanford. Many felt that they i
should give to the University in
order to "repay their obligation"
to Stanford.
.MUCH OF TIIL information ob
tained has not been fully studied
and analyzed. This material, ac-1
cording to Mr. Comstock. will '
continue to be studied and should
provide a valuable reservoir of |
information on student commu-j
nications. Much of the informa
tion obtained will be immediately
useful to the University in com
municating with prospective stu
dents, presently enrolled students,
and alumni. The Alumni Associa
tion will also find much of the
data valuable.
