# 'Community House' Helps Combat East Palo Alto Slum Tendencies
## 
### SHEILA RICKETTS 
"East Palo Alto is not a depressed area. As a
matter of fact, part of the problem is that people
west of the freeway tend to think it is a disad
vantaged area." says the Reverend Carl A. Smith,
eo-ordinator of Community House, a Christian cen
ter located in the area.
"This is not. a slum," he emphasizes, in explain
ing his work. "It is. as it is now, a reasonably
healthy integrated area even though it has its
problems more people on welfare, more people
unemployed. But many factors are at work which
could make it a slum. We're concerned as the
church to try to put a stop to those forces and to
stabilize the community."
Community House was established in January,
1963, by three local Presbyterian churches. The
United Presbyterian Church had at first planned
to establish a church in the east-of-the-freeway
area, but it decided that an experimental service
organization was more needed.
A MODEST FRAME house was leased for two
years, and in February, Reverend Smith came to
take on the job of co-ordinator. Smith is a tall,
thin man whose long face looks even longer under
a somewhat receding hairline. He sits sucking at
a pipe while talking, giving an impression of calm
ness in spite of the seemingly bewildering variety
of interruptions- phone calls, visitors, staff ques
tions—which the many Community House activi
ties bring on.
According to Smith, "Community House sees
itself as a clearing house of information and re
sources, as a vehicle by which we can work to
gether with a large number of organizations. It
is not a program-centered operation. We don't
promote a lot of programs ourselves."
But as a clearing house, Community House is
involved in a wide range of programs which cut
across the social, economic, racial and religious
fields. It works closely with the Co-ordinating
Council on Human Relations, a layman's group
which tries to bring together the many organiza
tions and groups working in the area.
"WE ARE very much committed to the Coordi
nating Council, and we try to be at least some of
the props that make the existence of this council
possible."
One of the committees of the Co-ordinating
Council with which Community House works is
the Adult Youth Committee. This committee is
partly responsible for the tutoring program at Ra
venswood High School.
Another of its activities is arranging excursions
to places of interest for young people, many of
whom otherwise have few opportunities to get out
of the area—"not even across that freeway."
Smith explains that this helps to graphically
demonstrate vocational opportunities: "If a child
grows up without a father in the home, you can't

explain to him what it means to be a man in the
work world. But you can take him to a factory
where Negroes are working to help him to asso
ciate himself with this work world and to realize
that Negroes are not excluded from it."
THE YOUTH C OMMITTEE sponsors a study
hall program which takes place behind Commu
nity House in a converted garage. About three
Stanford freshmen each weekday night help to
tutor junior high students in the unelegant but
functional building.
The Youth Committee has also organized a
Teenage Council, through which the teenagers in
the community are able to plan for themselves
dances which they hold in the garage-study room.
Community House is currently trying to see
that a Child Care Center is founded. As usual,
they hope to arrange the establishment of such a
service rather than do it themselves.
Smith explains the importance of this program.
"Many people can be constructively employed, per
haps come off welfare, if they can find care for
their children." There are presently, he claims,
at least 150 families in the community who need
such a service.
EAST I'ALO ALTO Neighbors is another group
which works through Community House. This
group hopes to encourage neighborhood teams to
fight unethical real estate practices such as "block
busting," and to thereby protect property values
in the neighborhood. Its handouts feature the slo
gan, "I'm NOT moving."
A Community House employment committee
works in liaison with NAACP and CORE on the
long-range educational problems of employment.
These efforts are primarily aimed at high school
drop-outs and other unemployed youths. As an
example of what can be done, Community House
is seriously thinking of using its own office to
give a refresher course to people looking for cleri
al jobs.
Community House is, of course, also interested
in a number of religious programs. During the
Christmas season, coffee exchanges followed by
family carols were arranged by churches on both
sides of the freeway.
All of these activities are centered in a one
story frame house on Bay Road, which includes
a reception room-office, a brightly furnished liv
ing room, a kitchen, a piano, a fireplace, a patio
and barbecue and one garage-turned-study-room.
According to Smith, the principal task of the
Community House is to discover concrete ways of
bringing people together to meet and to work to
gether on common community concerns and prob
lems. "We also hope to hasten integration within
our own congregations and communities," he says,
"and we hope to open up creative avenues for the
involvement of Christians in the affairs of our
world."
