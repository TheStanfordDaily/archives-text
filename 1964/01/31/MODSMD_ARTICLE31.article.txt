# Principal Calls Ravenswood Students Culturally Deprived'
## 
### RICK SEIFERT 
Malcolm Taylor, principal at Ravenswood High School
in East Palo Alto, thoughtfully searches for the phrase
that best describes Hie environment from which his
school's students come. "Culturally deprived best describes
it,"he says, "but I don't like to use the leim."
Because the community of East Palo Alto is an excep
tion on a Peninsula whose cities for the most part are far
from "culturally deprived," Taylor's Ravenswood High
School is troubled by some exceptional problems.
One-third of the students are in remedial classes in
reading, mathematics, English or social studies. In a stu
dent body of 1,300, there are 30 youngsters who can't
read third-grade level English, there are another 100 who
can't read fifth-grade level English. Some students still
don't know how to add or multiply. Consequently there
are four times as many remedial courses at Ravenswood
as at Menlo-Atherton High.
ON THE OTHER end of the scale, Ravenswood has had
difficulty offering its students advanced courses. Often
there aren't enough qualified or interested students to fill
a class. When accelerated classes have been offered, thy
have shared their teachers with the regular sections meet
ing in the same rooms at the same times.
The origins of Ravenswood's problems are found in the
community itself. A rapid turnover in the population has
provided the high school with students coming from varied

educational backgrounds. Poorly trained Negro newcomors
from (he impoverished schools in Alabama have been
placed vviih students matriculating from California's qual
ity elementary schools.
Under-motivated students frequently come from homes
where the achievement has been set at a low level. In such
cases, says Principal Taylor, "cultural blocks" have been
built which the school must first tear down if the student
is to benefit educationally. At Ravenswood the drop-out
rate is between 8 and 10 per cent, a figure that is three
times the rate at neighboring Menlo High School.
THE LARGEST PROBLEM confronting Ravenswood
has ironically been external in nature, for to a large ex
tent, the future success of the school depends on the sup
port it receives from the communities surrounding East
Palo Alto.
Unlike most schools on the Peninsula, Ravenswood is
fully integrated: 49 per cent Negro, 49 per cent Caucasian
and 2 per cent other minority groups. Yet full integration
is something that the school and, indeed, the East Palo Alto
community takes pride in. Says one community leader,
"We like living in an interracial community."
The problem for the school, then, is to remain fully in
tegrated with a suitable "racial balance." Last year, Negro
students accounted for 415 per cent of the school's enroll
ment. In a compromise measure to maintain the socio-eco
nomic balance of the student body. 180 Caucasian students
were brought in from Menlo Park. Yet despite these ef
forts to fill otherwise empty desks with students from out

side East Palo Alio, the influx of Negro students increased
enough 1o offset the increase in Caucasians.
CITIZENS IN MENLO Park have been none too recep
tive to the idea of sending their children to Ravenswood.
Families living in the newly established section chosen to
feed Ravenswood have responded by moving out or by
buying "dummy" apartments in areas covered by other
high schools.
Nevertheless, families who have gone along with the
plan have been satisfied with the education their children
are receiving at Ravenswood. With a low faculty-student
ratio of 1:18, with 49 per cent of last year's graduating
class going on to college, with the additional help of 70
Stanford tutors, with a modern physical plant only five
years old and still far from overcrowded, Ravenswood feels
that given the confidence of East Palo Alto and of the
surrounding community, it can and will to a large extent
rival the educational programs of the best schools in the
area.
Principal Taylor admits that recent changes have im
proved the image of the school in the area. The increased
enrollment, up 300 from last, year, has served as visible
evidence of the community's confidence in the school.
Unlike other schools across the country, before this
year, Ravenswood was hindered by under-enrollment. In
order to offer a full curriculum and best utilize her facili
ties, it was necessary to bring 400 new students into the
school. Moreover, officials connected with Ravenswood
knew that to maintain the socio-economic balance of the

student group, pupils from higher-income families would
have to be brought in.
To ihe casual observer, Iho obvious answer seemed to
lie 1 on the wesl side of the Bayshore where students from
Palo Alto would balance the Ravenswood enrollment. But
the solution to the problem had to be found elsewhere, for
despite the similarities of their names. East Palo Alio and
Palo Alto are in separate counties, the former being in
San Mateo, Ihe latter in Santa Clara.
TO FIND the suitable area to assign to the school, it
was necessary to draw from a district to the north of Palo
Alto and to the west of the freeway, namely from the
"Willows" section running from Ihe freeway to Marsh
Road.
In addition to improvements resulting from changes in
the Ravenswood attendance area and in the curriculum,
ihe national civil rights movement has done much to lift
the spirit' of the school's student body. The interracial
studentry was particularly proud that its school was posi
tive proof that integration, full integration, could result in
harmony and undersanding.
Principal Taylor likes to tell visitors the story of the
student play Ravenswood produced for friends and parents
of the school. The plot centered around a family; the par
ents were played by Caucasian students, the daughter by
an Oriental and a cousin by a Negro boy. "There were
some members of the audience who squirmed a bit," Taylor
says, "but when it was all over, they seemed 1o have gotten
used to it."

class going on to college, with the additional help of 70
Stanford tutors, with a modern physical plant only five
years old and still far from overcrowded, Ravenswood feels
that given the confidence of East Palo Alto and of the
surrounding community, it can and will to a large extent
rival the educational programs of the best schools in the
area.
Principal Taylor admits that recent changes have im
proved the image of the school in the area. The increased
enrollment, up 300 from last, year, has served as visible
evidence of the community's confidence in the school.
Unlike other schools across the country, before this
year, Ravenswood was hindered by under-enrollment. In
order to offer a full curriculum and best utilize her facili
ties, it was necessary to bring 400 new students into the
school. Moreover, officials connected with Ravenswood
knew that to maintain the socio-economic balance of the

student group, pupils from higher-income families would
have to be brought in.
To ihe casual observer, Iho obvious answer seemed to
lie 1 on the wesl side of the Bayshore where students from
Palo Alto would balance the Ravenswood enrollment. But
the solution to the problem had to be found elsewhere, for
despite the similarities of their names. East Palo Alio and
Palo Alto are in separate counties, the former being in
San Mateo, Ihe latter in Santa Clara.
TO FIND the suitable area to assign to the school, it
was necessary to draw from a district to the north of Palo
Alto and to the west of the freeway, namely from the
"Willows" section running from Ihe freeway to Marsh
Road.
In addition to improvements resulting from changes in
the Ravenswood attendance area and in the curriculum,
ihe national civil rights movement has done much to lift
the spirit' of the school's student body. The interracial
studentry was particularly proud that its school was posi
tive proof that integration, full integration, could result in
harmony and undersanding.
Principal Taylor likes to tell visitors the story of the
student play Ravenswood produced for friends and parents
of the school. The plot centered around a family; the par
ents were played by Caucasian students, the daughter by
an Oriental and a cousin by a Negro boy. "There were
some members of the audience who squirmed a bit," Taylor
says, "but when it was all over, they seemed 1o have gotten
used to it."
Malcolm Taylor, principal at Ravenswood High School
in East Palo Alto, thoughtfully searches for the phrase
that best describes Hie environment from which his
school's students come. "Culturally deprived best describes
it,"he says, "but I don't like to use the leim."
Because the community of East Palo Alto is an excep
tion on a Peninsula whose cities for the most part are far
from "culturally deprived," Taylor's Ravenswood High
School is troubled by some exceptional problems.
One-third of the students are in remedial classes in
reading, mathematics, English or social studies. In a stu
dent body of 1,300, there are 30 youngsters who can't
read third-grade level English, there are another 100 who
can't read fifth-grade level English. Some students still
don't know how to add or multiply. Consequently there
are four times as many remedial courses at Ravenswood
as at Menlo-Atherton High.
ON THE OTHER end of the scale, Ravenswood has had
difficulty offering its students advanced courses. Often
there aren't enough qualified or interested students to fill
a class. When accelerated classes have been offered, thy
have shared their teachers with the regular sections meet
ing in the same rooms at the same times.
The origins of Ravenswood's problems are found in the
community itself. A rapid turnover in the population has
provided the high school with students coming from varied

educational backgrounds. Poorly trained Negro newcomors
from (he impoverished schools in Alabama have been
placed vviih students matriculating from California's qual
ity elementary schools.
Under-motivated students frequently come from homes
where the achievement has been set at a low level. In such
cases, says Principal Taylor, "cultural blocks" have been
built which the school must first tear down if the student
is to benefit educationally. At Ravenswood the drop-out
rate is between 8 and 10 per cent, a figure that is three
times the rate at neighboring Menlo High School.
THE LARGEST PROBLEM confronting Ravenswood
has ironically been external in nature, for to a large ex
tent, the future success of the school depends on the sup
port it receives from the communities surrounding East
Palo Alto.
Unlike most schools on the Peninsula, Ravenswood is
fully integrated: 49 per cent Negro, 49 per cent Caucasian
and 2 per cent other minority groups. Yet full integration
is something that the school and, indeed, the East Palo Alto
community takes pride in. Says one community leader,
"We like living in an interracial community."
The problem for the school, then, is to remain fully in
tegrated with a suitable "racial balance." Last year, Negro
students accounted for 415 per cent of the school's enroll
ment. In a compromise measure to maintain the socio-eco
nomic balance of the student body. 180 Caucasian students
were brought in from Menlo Park. Yet despite these ef
forts to fill otherwise empty desks with students from out

side East Palo Alio, the influx of Negro students increased
enough 1o offset the increase in Caucasians.
CITIZENS IN MENLO Park have been none too recep
tive to the idea of sending their children to Ravenswood.
Families living in the newly established section chosen to
feed Ravenswood have responded by moving out or by
buying "dummy" apartments in areas covered by other
high schools.
Nevertheless, families who have gone along with the
plan have been satisfied with the education their children
are receiving at Ravenswood. With a low faculty-student
ratio of 1:18, with 49 per cent of last year's graduating
class going on to college, with the additional help of 70

The origins of Ravenswood's problems are found in the
community itself. A rapid turnover in the population has
provided the high school with students coming from varied

educational backgrounds. Poorly trained Negro newcomors
from (he impoverished schools in Alabama have been
placed vviih students matriculating from California's qual
ity elementary schools.
Under-motivated students frequently come from homes
where the achievement has been set at a low level. In such
cases, says Principal Taylor, "cultural blocks" have been
built which the school must first tear down if the student
is to benefit educationally. At Ravenswood the drop-out
rate is between 8 and 10 per cent, a figure that is three
times the rate at neighboring Menlo High School.
THE LARGEST PROBLEM confronting Ravenswood
has ironically been external in nature, for to a large ex
tent, the future success of the school depends on the sup
port it receives from the communities surrounding East
Palo Alto.
Unlike most schools on the Peninsula, Ravenswood is
fully integrated: 49 per cent Negro, 49 per cent Caucasian
and 2 per cent other minority groups. Yet full integration
is something that the school and, indeed, the East Palo Alto
community takes pride in. Says one community leader,
"We like living in an interracial community."
The problem for the school, then, is to remain fully in
tegrated with a suitable "racial balance." Last year, Negro
students accounted for 415 per cent of the school's enroll
ment. In a compromise measure to maintain the socio-eco
nomic balance of the student body. 180 Caucasian students
were brought in from Menlo Park. Yet despite these ef
forts to fill otherwise empty desks with students from out

side East Palo Alio, the influx of Negro students increased
enough 1o offset the increase in Caucasians.
CITIZENS IN MENLO Park have been none too recep
tive to the idea of sending their children to Ravenswood.
Families living in the newly established section chosen to
feed Ravenswood have responded by moving out or by
buying "dummy" apartments in areas covered by other
high schools.
Nevertheless, families who have gone along with the
plan have been satisfied with the education their children
are receiving at Ravenswood. With a low faculty-student
ratio of 1:18, with 49 per cent of last year's graduating
class going on to college, with the additional help of 70
Stanford tutors, with a modern physical plant only five
years old and still far from overcrowded, Ravenswood feels
that given the confidence of East Palo Alto and of the
surrounding community, it can and will to a large extent
rival the educational programs of the best schools in the
area.
Principal Taylor admits that recent changes have im
proved the image of the school in the area. The increased
enrollment, up 300 from last, year, has served as visible
evidence of the community's confidence in the school.
Unlike other schools across the country, before this
year, Ravenswood was hindered by under-enrollment. In
order to offer a full curriculum and best utilize her facili
ties, it was necessary to bring 400 new students into the
school. Moreover, officials connected with Ravenswood
knew that to maintain the socio-economic balance of the

student group, pupils from higher-income families would
have to be brought in.
To ihe casual observer, Iho obvious answer seemed to
lie 1 on the wesl side of the Bayshore where students from
Palo Alto would balance the Ravenswood enrollment. But
the solution to the problem had to be found elsewhere, for
despite the similarities of their names. East Palo Alio and
Palo Alto are in separate counties, the former being in
San Mateo, Ihe latter in Santa Clara.
TO FIND the suitable area to assign to the school, it
was necessary to draw from a district to the north of Palo
Alto and to the west of the freeway, namely from the
"Willows" section running from Ihe freeway to Marsh
Road.
In addition to improvements resulting from changes in
the Ravenswood attendance area and in the curriculum,
ihe national civil rights movement has done much to lift
the spirit' of the school's student body. The interracial
studentry was particularly proud that its school was posi
tive proof that integration, full integration, could result in
harmony and undersanding.
Principal Taylor likes to tell visitors the story of the
student play Ravenswood produced for friends and parents
of the school. The plot centered around a family; the par
ents were played by Caucasian students, the daughter by
an Oriental and a cousin by a Negro boy. "There were
some members of the audience who squirmed a bit," Taylor
says, "but when it was all over, they seemed 1o have gotten
used to it."
Malcolm Taylor, principal at Ravenswood High School
in East Palo Alto, thoughtfully searches for the phrase
that best describes Hie environment from which his
school's students come. "Culturally deprived best describes
it,"he says, "but I don't like to use the leim."
Because the community of East Palo Alto is an excep
tion on a Peninsula whose cities for the most part are far
from "culturally deprived," Taylor's Ravenswood High
School is troubled by some exceptional problems.
One-third of the students are in remedial classes in
reading, mathematics, English or social studies. In a stu
dent body of 1,300, there are 30 youngsters who can't
read third-grade level English, there are another 100 who
can't read fifth-grade level English. Some students still
don't know how to add or multiply. Consequently there
are four times as many remedial courses at Ravenswood
as at Menlo-Atherton High.
ON THE OTHER end of the scale, Ravenswood has had
difficulty offering its students advanced courses. Often
there aren't enough qualified or interested students to fill
a class. When accelerated classes have been offered, thy
have shared their teachers with the regular sections meet
ing in the same rooms at the same times.
