# SU Tutors Program Benefits Students: Provides Motivation, Arouses Interest
## 
### RICK SEIFERT 
Dr. Robert E. Shules, director of
secondary school student teaching,
describes the Stanford Tutors pro
gram as "a new service project to
provide student assistance for lo
cal public school teachers.
"The new program is open to
sophomores, juniors and seniors
who have demonstrated a high de
gree of responsibility. While an
individual who is planning a ca
reer in teaching may gain valuable
experience from the program and
is encouraged to participate, ad
mission is by no means limited to
these individuals."
Each student serves from one to
three hours per week at a grade
level or in a subject area of his
choice. Following a brief orienta
tion program the student is as
signed to an individual classroom
teacher willing to give him spe
cific direction in his work. Activi
ties may nclude:
• regular and continuous work
with a small group or a single
pupil who, for reasons of rapid or
slow learning ability, falls outside
the range of average performance
of the class.
• planning, rehearsing or exe
cuting a school project or presen
tation with a committee of pupils.
• serving generally as a "sec
ond" teachcr for activities requir
ing additional supervision or the
division of the class into two
groups.
• assistance with supervised
study periods.
• assistance with "make-up" as
-1 signments and tests of pupils re
j turning alter absence.
The first announcement of the
| tutor program last fall drew more
! than fifty applicants. After an
OARR (Opportunities for Action
in Race Relations) presentation
j last October on campus, a second
group of students applied and
began work this quarter.
"The response of interest in the
I Stanford Tutors Program was
overwhelming. Both the number
of Stanford students interested in
j tutoring and the number of Ra
venswood students interested in
I receiving tutoring were beyond
: our expectations," said Shutes.

STANFORD STUDKNTS who
before asked "What can I do to
help in the community?", have
found that by working as a tutor

they can do a great deal. Malcom
Taylor. Ravenswood's principal,
claims he can point to numerous
grade improvements resulting
from the tutoring. "The pro
gram's worth has proven itself
time and again," ho says.
Although the primary contribu
tion of the Stanford tutor is in
formal education. Ravenswood of
ficials think that help from Stan
ford may go a long way in "mo
tivating the unmotivated and in
teresting the uninterested." In so
doing, Principal Taylor sees the
tutoring program as one of his
school's chief weapons in combat
ing Ravenswood's high drop-out
rate.
Among Stanford tutors, change
has not boon limited to a new
conception of the college student's
role in the community. In order to
work effectively, Stanford stu
dents have assumed the roles of
teachers in name and appearance
as well as in fact.
JOHN MCCARTHY, a senor his
tory major, is "transformed" into
a tutor every Tuesday and Thurs
day evening before he makes the
trek to East Palo Alto, for unlike
most of the activities at Stanford,

this one requires a coat and tie.
Moreover, when he arrives at Ra
venswood, John will no longer be
"John" but instead, "Mr. Mc-
Carthy."
Although the tutoring has been
effective at the individual level,
| Principal "Taylor feels that the
| program on the whole is still not
reaching the most needy of Ra
venswood's students. Because tu
toring help was made voluntary,
many pupils, either through a
j sense of pride or bashfulness,
i have not sought the help they
desperately need.
In order to reach this group,
i Tayor plans to use the tutors in
; more of the school's activities. He
[would like the tutors to visit the
school during the day so the
j Ravenswood's students would get
use to "having them around."
On the basis of its record to
date, "having Stanford tutors
j around" has proved beneficial not
only to Ravenswood but concrete
i ly rewarding to Stanford students
!as well. If Ravenswood students
! "keep bringing in friends." by the
! end of the academic year, as many
las 100 Stanford students may bo
I involved in the program.


A STANFORD STUDENT helps a Ravenswood High School girl with
her studies cis a part of the new tutorial program. The program,
aimed at improving the motivation and interest of Ravenswood

students, is a voluntary activity. Most of the East Palo Alto par
ticipants show a marked improvement in their grades as a result
of the tutoring.


AN ORIENTAL BOY at Ravenswood works with a Stanford girl in
one of the evening tutoring sessions arranged by the University's
School of Education. Students assume the roles of teachers twice
a week to bring individual help to high schoolers who express a
desire for aid.
