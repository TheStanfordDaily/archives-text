# Volunteers Help Mexican Children

### VIVIAN BOZMAN 
Children without a future there are many, nol
only in East Africa or Mississippi, but in Easl
Palo Alio, Menlo Park, Mountain View moments
away from Stanford.
They are children of men and women in the
county jail or in State and Federal prisons. A 1
least T.i per cent of their families are Mexican
Americans. Most of the Caucasian families are
second - generation welfare - reared. Except for
those of the Catholic faith, few belong to a church.
! The children are mostly undernourished, poorly
clad, and live in grossly substandard housing.
I Most have dental needs which have not been and
1 cannot be met.
POLICK, LANDLORD, social workers, the pro
bation department all of these are enemies who
may one day snatch all security from the children,
all without a warning, without a reason a child can
perceive. Far too young, these children realize
there is little justice in this world of police and
probation officers, and that they are .just another
name on some social worker's list.
They have no plans for the future; when asked
; what they are going to be when they are grown
, up. most of them shrug, "I don' know." And to
morrow, too. is just as bleak as the distant future.
Even low cost public recreation is out of their
reach; welfare children are budgeted 7.1 cents a
month for pleasure.
These children have little or no incentive to
stay in school. Once classes become difficult, it is
much easier simply not to try. In their homes
they have no books, no pictures, no intellectual
conversation; often their parents are not able or
simply lack the time to help them with their
[ school work.
IN (iKAI)K SCHOOL they are often on double
! session. Because few of them present real beha
vior problems, they are often overlooked as non
learners. Their only contact with a successful
! world is through their social worker, who has 50
or more similar families; their teacher, who has
30 or 40 similar pupils; and if a child is suffi

oicntly aggressive, a probation officer, who also
has a far too heavy caseload.
In this scene of what Michael Harrington, in
his book on poverty in the United States, has
termed "The Other America," Friends Outside, a
group of private citizens, has been working for
seven years to make possible a future for these
children.
Friends Outside activities include Mothers'
Clubs for discussion of common problems, lectures
on topics of interest to the mothers, and instruc
tion in such practical things as arts and crafts
and home decoration. One of the main goals of
these clubs is to bring the women outside their
problems.
NTRSKKV SCHOOLS teach children to look at
hooks, 1o hear stories, to find a world outside the
home. For the older children, day camps and pro
grams with church and community youth organi
zations serve the same function of (caching chil
dren to relate to Ihe outer world.
Approximately 20 Stanford students are now
involved in the Friends Outside tutoring program,
conducted in the homes of the children.
A typical study evening presents problems of a
small and cluttered house, from five to seven noisy
brothers and sisters, absence of pencils or paper
in ihe home, and visits by boisterous neighborhood
children. The problems are mostly these material
ones; the assets are intangible. The student be
comes a friend of the child; a little boy of nine is
awed to think that a "big college girl" really wants
to come and help him do spelling. Spelling amost
becomes fun.
And for the Stanford student, suddenly one of
the most important things is not that he receives
an "A" on a college ex'.im, bul that David or Al
fred gets 100 on his spelling test.
The tutoring program doesn't make "A" stu
dents overnight, but, perhaps, the most important
thing it does is to establish a relationship between
iwo different worlds in the community and both
Ihe deprived student and the richly endowed Stan
ford student begin to look beyond their own pri
