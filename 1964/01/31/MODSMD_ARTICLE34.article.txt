# Fight Continues Over Ravenswood Boundaries
## 
### PELL FENDER 
In May, 1955, voters ol' the So
quoia Union High School District
approved a bond issue providing
1 <ii" a now high school, later to bo
called Ravenswood, located in
East Palo Alto. Since 1945), the
area east of the Bayshore Free

way lias housed Negro and lower
income white families. In 1957,
the Board met to plan the definite
boundaries of Ravenswood. The
Board terminated the northern
boundary at the north city limits
of Belle Haven (East Menlo),
similar to East Palo Alto in so

cio-economic distribution; leaders
of East Palo Alto and Belle Ha
! von protested.
The fight began, and has con-
I tinned 1o the present. Citizens'
I committees argued that the Ra-
I venswood boundaries constitute
do facto segregation by roslri''t
j ; ng 95 per cent of all Negro ado
lescents to the Ravenswood dis
trict. Of the six high schools in
I the Sequoia Union High School!
District, Ravenswood is 19 per
cent Negro, Menlo-Atherton is 4
per cent Negro, Woodside is 1 per
cent Negro, and San Carlos, Carl
mont and Sequoia have virtually
no Negroes at all.

that Negro families have moved
to the west side of Bayshore as

added to a minor "population ex
