# Stanford Medical School Conducts Study With East Palo Alto Welfare Families
## 
### JANET ROSS 
Concern about California's wel
fare program and thc> general
problem of poverty in the United
States has prompted the Stanford
Medical School and the State Wel
fare Department to conduct an
experiment in medical care with
families in East Palo Alto.
The experiment attempts to an
swer such questions as: Why do
lower income families avoid us
ing medical facilities available to
them and will improved personal
health influence the functioning
of a family unit ?
Two sets of families were se- I
lected, one for an experimental
group and one for a control
group. The experimental group,
called the Bay Road group, is
given personalized care at the
Stanford Hospital. The control
group receives regular welfare
care at the Community Hospital
of San Mateo County.
ALL TIIL FAMILIES involved
have been on welfare for nine
months and have ai least one
child under two. They were se
lected on a nine-month basis in
order to measure long-term ef
fects. The experimenters theo
rize that ihe longer a family has
been on welfare the more likely it
will conitnue to be on welfare.
Families with one child were
chosen because more pediatric
care is available, and East Pale
Alto families were chosen for con
venience.
The families were also matched
as to average age of mother, aver
age education, average number of
children and other similar charac
teristics This correlation reduces
measurement error when trying
to determine the difference be
tween the two medical care sys
tems.
Thirty-four families are pres
ently in each group. In January
1062, ihe experiment started with
two groups of 50 each. Drop-outs
have either moved or gone off
welfare.
JOHN IIOWAKI), Ph.D. candi
date in the sociology department,
is currently evaluating the proj
ect. Using a case study method,
his field work and research in
volve interviewing I he partici
pants. determining their reaction
to the projects, to the profession
als involved and to the two sys
tems of medical care.
Howard explains that the ex
perimental group differs from the
control group in three important
ways.
1 i Stanford social workers have
about IT clients each, while the
welfare workers have from 50 to
150 each.
2> Stanford social workers ac
quaint mothers with opportunities
for job training and arrange for
child care while they are in school.
3) Participants arc encouraged
to make more visits to the doctor.
According to Howard, a doctor is
more capable of understanding a
client's problems when he can see
him regularly: "Communication
difficulties may occur if the doc

tor' and patient see each other
sporadically. . . . The welfare pa
tient needs time to break down
feelings of class differences."
"The sheer 1 number of patients
at tire Community Hospital im
poses the necessity of dealing
with them in a mechanical way,
Howard says.
"It's not that the regular wel
fare situation is so bad. The prob
lem is structural, that is. how to
adequately administer medica I
care. Stanford is just offering an
alternative approach."
Results of the project may bo
negative, Howard admits. "It
might not make any difference
how welfare facilities are strue
t ured.
"First of all, beliefs about ill
ness may prevent the more fre
quent use of facilities by families
on welfare. The question is at
what point do people call the doc
tor. The lower the income, the
sicker people are before they ask
for help."

MEXTS may also curtail visits to
the doctor. Day-to-day crises may
require that appointments be bro
ken. "It could be that for strug
gling low-income people it is not
easy to keep life in ordered slots,"
says Howard.
In addition, "estrangement"
may limit the success of an alter
native medical care program. Be
cause backgrounds differ, the cli

ent may doubt thai tho profc

Concern about California's wel
fare program and thc> general
problem of poverty in the United
States has prompted the Stanford
Medical School and the State Wel
fare Department to conduct an
experiment in medical care with
families in East Palo Alto.
The experiment attempts to an
swer such questions as: Why do
lower income families avoid us
ing medical facilities available to
them and will improved personal
health influence the functioning
of a family unit ?
Two sets of families were se- I
lected, one for an experimental
group and one for a control
group. The experimental group,
called the Bay Road group, is
given personalized care at the
Stanford Hospital. The control
group receives regular welfare
care at the Community Hospital
of San Mateo County.
ALL TIIL FAMILIES involved
have been on welfare for nine
months and have ai least one
child under two. They were se
lected on a nine-month basis in
order to measure long-term ef
fects. The experimenters theo
rize that ihe longer a family has
been on welfare the more likely it
will conitnue to be on welfare.
Families with one child were
chosen because more pediatric
care is available, and East Pale
Alto families were chosen for con
venience.
The families were also matched
as to average age of mother, aver
age education, average number of
children and other similar charac
teristics This correlation reduces
measurement error when trying
to determine the difference be
tween the two medical care sys
tems.
Thirty-four families are pres
ently in each group. In January
1062, ihe experiment started with
two groups of 50 each. Drop-outs
have either moved or gone off
welfare.

to the projects, to the profession
als involved and to the two sys
tems of medical care.
Howard explains that the ex
perimental group differs from the
control group in three important
ways.
1 i Stanford social workers have
about IT clients each, while the
welfare workers have from 50 to
150 each.
2> Stanford social workers ac
quaint mothers with opportunities
for job training and arrange for
child care while they are in school.
3) Participants arc encouraged
to make more visits to the doctor.
According to Howard, a doctor is
more capable of understanding a
client's problems when he can see
him regularly: "Communication
difficulties may occur if the doc

tor' and patient see each other
sporadically. . . . The welfare pa
tient needs time to break down
feelings of class differences."
"The sheer 1 number of patients
at tire Community Hospital im
poses the necessity of dealing
with them in a mechanical way,
Howard says.
"It's not that the regular wel
fare situation is so bad. The prob
lem is structural, that is. how to
adequately administer medica I
care. Stanford is just offering an
alternative approach."
Results of the project may bo
negative, Howard admits. "It
might not make any difference
how welfare facilities are strue
t ured.
"First of all, beliefs about ill
ness may prevent the more fre
quent use of facilities by families
on welfare. The question is at
what point do people call the doc
tor. The lower the income, the
sicker people are before they ask
for help."

MEXTS may also curtail visits to
the doctor. Day-to-day crises may
require that appointments be bro
ken. "It could be that for strug
gling low-income people it is not
easy to keep life in ordered slots,"
says Howard.

may limit the success of an alter

Concern about California's wel
fare program and thc> general
problem of poverty in the United
States has prompted the Stanford
Medical School and the State Wel
fare Department to conduct an
experiment in medical care with
families in East Palo Alto.
The experiment attempts to an
swer such questions as: Why do
lower income families avoid us
ing medical facilities available to
them and will improved personal
health influence the functioning
of a family unit ?
Two sets of families were se- I
lected, one for an experimental
group and one for a control
group. The experimental group,
called the Bay Road group, is
given personalized care at the
Stanford Hospital. The control
group receives regular welfare
care at the Community Hospital
of San Mateo County.
ALL TIIL FAMILIES involved
have been on welfare for nine
months and have ai least one
child under two. They were se
lected on a nine-month basis in
order to measure long-term ef
fects. The experimenters theo
rize that ihe longer a family has
been on welfare the more likely it
will conitnue to be on welfare.
Families with one child were
chosen because more pediatric
care is available, and East Pale
Alto families were chosen for con
venience.
The families were also matched
as to average age of mother, aver
age education, average number of
children and other similar charac
teristics This correlation reduces
measurement error when trying
to determine the difference be
tween the two medical care sys
tems.
Thirty-four families are pres
ently in each group. In January
1062, ihe experiment started with
two groups of 50 each. Drop-outs
have either moved or gone off
welfare.

to the projects, to the profession

Howard explains that the ex
perimental group differs from the
control group in three important
ways.
1 i Stanford social workers have
about IT clients each, while the
welfare workers have from 50 to
150 each.
2> Stanford social workers ac

for job training and arrange for
child care while they are in school.
3) Participants arc encouraged
to make more visits to the doctor.
According to Howard, a doctor is
more capable of understanding a
client's problems when he can see
him regularly: "Communication
difficulties may occur if the doc

tor' and patient see each other
sporadically. . . . The welfare pa
tient needs time to break down
feelings of class differences."
"The sheer 1 number of patients
at tire Community Hospital im
poses the necessity of dealing
with them in a mechanical way,
Howard says.
"It's not that the regular wel
fare situation is so bad. The prob
lem is structural, that is. how to
adequately administer medica I
care. Stanford is just offering an
alternative approach."
Results of the project may bo
negative, Howard admits. "It
might not make any difference
how welfare facilities are strue
t ured.
"First of all, beliefs about ill
ness may prevent the more fre
quent use of facilities by families
on welfare. The question is at
what point do people call the doc
tor. The lower the income, the
sicker people are before they ask
for help."

MEXTS may also curtail visits to
the doctor. Day-to-day crises may
require that appointments be bro

easy to keep life in ordered slots,"
says Howard.
