Fifty thousand adults in the Bay
Area are functionally illiterate, ac

president of the Peninsula Chap
ter of LARK i Literacy for Adults
and Related Knowledge.)
LARK, a non-profit, non-sec
tarian. non-partisan educational
organization, was organized in
1958 in order to "do something
educationally for the culturally
disadvantaged adult in the Yak
ima, Washington, area," says j
Mrs. Swienton. Now, six years ;
later, the LARK Foundation is
nationally recognized and has j
chapters in eleven states.
states.
The Peninsula Chapter, estab j
lished in Palo Alto last year, j
draws participants pr i m a r i 1 y
from the East Palo Alto area.
LAKK OFFERS the adult with
a low educational background an
opportunity to "brush up" on Eng
lish, spelling, and arithmetic at
the elementary level. Mrs. Swien- i
ton emphasizes the need to en
courage adults: "Our approach is
straight-across and not down."
The LARK teaching system

tries to solve individual problems
and thus is similar to the tutorial
method. The classes accommo
date both the beginner and those
who merely want a "refresher"
course.
In order to provide accelerated
programs for job-upgrading
teachers experienced with LARK
methods work together with rep-
resentatives from the Vocational
Education and Rehabilitation or-
ganization.
CLASSES MEET two nights a
week for a 26-week school term,
an equivalent of two years of ele-
mentary work. Teachers are all
volunteers, trained through
"workshop" and "in service" pro-
grams.
Registration is free and open to
everyone, but the students must
buy their own texts. Support
comes from the local community
FT A, F e derate d Women's
Clubs, Lions Clubs, labor unions
and other service organizations.
Because enrollment is constant
ly increasing, Mrs. Swienton cur
rently seeks more volunteers to
aid LARK's program of education
and resocialization.
