# Civil Rights Groups Emphasize Key Areas; Voting, Employment, Housing, and Education
## 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN 
Employment, voting lights and
legislation, housing, education,
and fund raising these are the
key areas in which the South San

Mateo C'imm p.- NAACP, Stanford-
Palo Alio NAACP and ihc Mid
"P'vnsii'-) '"lapter of Ihc Congress
of Racial Equality (CORE) are
concentrating their efforts.
Typical of the projects of the
civil rights groups are those an
nounced in the South San Mateo
NAACP's January, 1964, news
letter to members. Citing the bat
tle cry of 1964 as "Vole the Ras
cals Out," the bulletin states that
the Voter Registration Committee
of the N AACP has taken the posi
tion that all branches must cam
paign actively to defeat any
United States Senator or Con
gressman who ob s t r u c t e d ,
watered down, or voted against a
meaningful civil rights bill, no
matter who is opposing him.
The purpose of this action is to
destroy the seniority position of
anti-civil rights legislators, even
if it does not necessarily mean
voting in a better legislator.
Means for carrying out this pro
gram will include a strong voter
registration drive and increased
precinct work.
IN AN AREA of immediate con
cern, both NAACP's are support
ing the Ravenswood City School
District Bond Election. They see
the approval of the bond issue as
necessary to equalize faciliites in
the elementary schools of the dis
trict and to keep construction
pace equal to growth pace.
All three local civil rights
groups are emphasizing the need
for action in the area of employ
ment. They receive and distribute
information from industries who
express a desire to employ mem
bers of minority groups.
Representatives from Bell Tele
phone Company recently visited
Ihc South San Mateo NAACP
meeting and announced their in
terest, in hiring about 150 minor
ity group workers for linemen po
sitions. This is the first time such
a?i opening has occurred; in the
past the telephone ocmpany only
has hired Negro women, and as
telephone operators.
TIIE EMPLOYMENT commit
tees are also trying to find per
sonnel to visit Sequoia District
high schools to encourage stu
dents to stay in school and to
make contact with labor unions.
The South San Mateo NAACP
education committee is now work
ing on a policy statement in re
gard to defacto segregation in the
Sequoia District and has asked
high school students to volunteer
to transfer between schools in or
der to equalize Negro-white ratios.
"In these days, when direct ac
tion is becoming the key in civil
rights work, it is more important
than ever to have enough money
in the Fighting Fund for Free
dom," one NAACP bulletin reads.
The Freedom Fund, set up by the
National NAACP, seeks money to
be used for such thinks as law
suits, publicity, direct assistance
to hard pressed freedom lighters
and creation of new programs.
CIIKKEXT FlINI) raising proj
ects include a hardback book sale

at the California Avenue Co-op
from Jan. 28 through Feb. 1, the
sale of NAACP gift cards, and the
sale of freedom seals, primarily
a Christmas project. NAACP also
participated in a SNCC Benefit
Christmas Drive and is selling
pins, the proceeds from which will
go to the six major civil rights
groups.
A February 22 program for
Brotherhood Week will feature a
"Tone Poem." written by James
Baldwin, with music by Dave Bru
beck. The first section of the
poem is a musical soliloquy by a
Negro mother, explaining her
dream that her child may live a
full life. The second part, a choral
number, discusses the possibility
that, if God created man in his
image and likeness, God mighl be
black. The third section speaks of
the premise that Black and White
can both be free without losing
their separate identities. The pro
gram will be sponsored by the
NAACP, the Fair Play Council,
church groups, and other local or
ganizations.
CORE, instrumental in initiat
ing a tutorial program for high
school students, also makes a par
ticular effort to help minority
group members locate housing.
IN GENERAL the Civil Rights
groups aim to supplement each
other, not to overlap their activ
ities. They often cooperate in proj
ects, such as helping persons ob
tain employment or joining to
gether in direct action, demon
strations and picketing.
However, there is a difference
betw e en the groups. John
Howard, PHD candidate in sociol
ogy at Stanford and officer of the
CORE chapter, defines the differ
ence between CORE and NAACP
as a greater degree of military
degree of militancy on the part
of CORE. He thinks that CORE
is more willing to make specific
demands and take direct action
if their demands are ignored.
Howard also notes a difference
in membership; CORE members
are younger and many are stu
dents. They are "not the backbone
of the community type." he
stated. The difference in genera
tion enables CORE to be the more
militant today. "However, the
next generation will probably con
sider CORE'S standards conserv
ative."
The Stanford CORE Chapter,
organized last July, has 225 mem
bers, of which about f>() are active.
NAACP has a greater propor
tion of white members and pro
fessional people than does CORE.
Although there are only about 50
active members in the local
groups, 800 to 1,000 pay dues.
Members are generally in their
late 30's, solid, stable and middle
class.
The two local NAACP chapters
however, also differ in member
ship. The Stanford-Palo Alto
Chapter draws from the Palo Alto
and University community, while
the San Mateo counter Chapter
draws primarily from residents in
East Palo Alto*

in membership; CORE members

The two local NAACP chapters
however, also differ in member

Chapter draws from the Palo Alto
and University community, while
the San Mateo counter Chapter
draws primarily from residents in
East Palo Alto*
Employment, voting lights and
legislation, housing, education,
and fund raising these are the
key areas in which the South San

of Racial Equality (CORE) are
concentrating their efforts.
Typical of the projects of the
civil rights groups are those an
nounced in the South San Mateo
NAACP's January, 1964, news
letter to members. Citing the bat
tle cry of 1964 as "Vole the Ras
cals Out," the bulletin states that
the Voter Registration Committee
of the N AACP has taken the posi
tion that all branches must cam
paign actively to defeat any
United States Senator or Con
gressman who ob s t r u c t e d ,
watered down, or voted against a
meaningful civil rights bill, no
matter who is opposing him.
The purpose of this action is to
destroy the seniority position of
anti-civil rights legislators, even
if it does not necessarily mean
voting in a better legislator.
Means for carrying out this pro
gram will include a strong voter
registration drive and increased
precinct work.
IN AN AREA of immediate con

ing the Ravenswood City School
District Bond Election. They see
the approval of the bond issue as
necessary to equalize faciliites in
the elementary schools of the dis

pace equal to growth pace.
All three local civil rights
groups are emphasizing the need
for action in the area of employ
ment. They receive and distribute
information from industries who
express a desire to employ mem
bers of minority groups.

has hired Negro women, and as

The South San Mateo NAACP

participated in a SNCC Benefit

A February 22 program for
Brotherhood Week will feature a
"Tone Poem." written by James
Baldwin, with music by Dave Bru
beck. The first section of the
poem is a musical soliloquy by a
Negro mother, explaining her
dream that her child may live a
full life. The second part, a choral
number, discusses the possibility
that, if God created man in his
image and likeness, God mighl be
black. The third section speaks of
the premise that Black and White
can both be free without losing
their separate identities. The pro
gram will be sponsored by the
NAACP, the Fair Play Council,
church groups, and other local or
ganizations.
CORE, instrumental in initiat

IN GENERAL the Civil Rights
groups aim to supplement each

However, there is a difference
betw e en the groups. John
Howard, PHD candidate in sociol

CORE chapter, defines the differ
ence between CORE and NAACP
as a greater degree of military
degree of militancy on the part
of CORE. He thinks that CORE
is more willing to make specific
demands and take direct action
if their demands are ignored.
Howard also notes a difference
in membership; CORE members
are younger and many are stu
dents. They are "not the backbone
of the community type." he
stated. The difference in genera
tion enables CORE to be the more
militant today. "However, the
next generation will probably con
