# Stanford Seen: A Kaleidoscope
## 
### WARREN G. WOOD, JR 
"Stanford Seen" is a significant
title for the photographs by Leo
Holub currently on display at 1
Stanford Art Gallery. Mr. Holub
has captured a series of moments
which form a kaleidoscope of the
moods and facets of I he univer
sity. What is remarkable about
this exhibit is the depth of sensi
tively il evidences to a wide range
of experience: irony, humor, nos
talgia. loneliness, love, excite
ment, reverence for nature.
A smiling nun. a bearded youth
in a striped gondolier's shirt, and
a May Britt-type blond, all in the
midst of registration day proce
dure, bring to mind the diversity
of the university itself. This di
versity is manifested even m o re
in the varied expressions of
people as. in a photograph of a
waiting line in the bookstore, they
are absorbed in t h c i r own

j thoughts: some smiling content
jedly, some staring vacantly ahead,
I others seemingly touched with a
' secret sadness.
The diversity of the university
j is counter-pointed by its aspects
of uniformity, as in a photograph
of two energetic chaps trundling
i down the law school steps in
j identical black suits and ties,
carrying identical briefcases.
A warm sense of humor mani
fests itself in numerous shots: a
policeman in pantaloned motor
cycle britches stands in hands-on
hips contemplation of an arm-
I linked couple; a pair a narrow
j legs is ineongrously poined to a
large torso which, after a mo
ments observation, turns out to
be a photo mural with someone
j standing behind it.
The physical beauty of youth is
observed in the lithe and grace
ful forms of a co-ed resting
against a stack of history or art
texts in the bookstore. A group
of young A polios lean upon the
railing of the 1 Lake Lag boat
house. the sun glistening on their
bare backs and legs.
The flow of time, the intcr
j weaving of minds, the relation
ship of the generations, seem to
underlie the more than two hun
dred photographs in the exhibit.
This sense of time is particularly
i well expressed in a figure pass
ing between sunlight and shadow
under the arches of tin* Quad.
The solitariness of the figure and
1 the contrast of dark and light
give an unmistakable quality of
loneliness, an implication of the
separateness which marks the
journey of each through life; yet
i implicit in the scene is a sense
I of those who have gone before.

I of the numberless footsteps which
have echoed down the corridor.
The totality of moods is united
by the creative manner in which
the show is hung. Examples in
clude a shot of a man-hole cover
j unexpectedly al one's feet a ti d
| the juxloposition of reclining stu
dents with a wooden Buddha
stretched out in nirvanie ease in
the museum.
The most powerful arrange
ment is a group of students, som
i ber. silent, or talking quietly.
' some staring upwards. One's eves
j unconsciously follow their gaze
J until they rivet upon the object
1 of their attention: on the neigh-
I boring wall is a solitary picture
of a television sciven and one sud
denly grasps the reason for their
I solemnity.
Aside from the imaginative
setting, which was designed In
Ann Roscner of the Development
Office, and the varied moods of
the pictures, the exhibition stands
out for the compositional exeel
i lence of the photographs.
Mr. Holub demonstrates an in
tuitive sense of the right moment
to capture an expression; from a
row of heads turned attentively
in <>ne direction, one face turns to-
I ward the viewer, providing a cen
ter of interest and giving colic
i siveness to the composition.
A forty-eight page book of Mr.
| Holub's photographs is being
planed by the Stanford Art De
parlmenl. Those interested in pur
j chasing a copy may indicate their
, interest on a list in tln* art gal
ler> foyer. The exhibit, which will
[continue through February Iti, is
worth repeated viewing for sel
i dom will Stanford be seen v\ ith
such candor and compassion.

"Stanford Seen" is a significant
title for the photographs by Leo
Holub currently on display at 1
Stanford Art Gallery. Mr. Holub
has captured a series of moments
which form a kaleidoscope of the
moods and facets of I he univer
sity. What is remarkable about
this exhibit is the depth of sensi
tively il evidences to a wide range
of experience: irony, humor, nos
talgia. loneliness, love, excite
ment, reverence for nature.
A smiling nun. a bearded youth
in a striped gondolier's shirt, and
a May Britt-type blond, all in the
midst of registration day proce
dure, bring to mind the diversity
of the university itself. This di
versity is manifested even m o re
in the varied expressions of
people as. in a photograph of a
waiting line in the bookstore, they
are absorbed in t h c i r own

j thoughts: some smiling content
jedly, some staring vacantly ahead,
I others seemingly touched with a
' secret sadness.
The diversity of the university
j is counter-pointed by its aspects
of uniformity, as in a photograph
of two energetic chaps trundling
i down the law school steps in
j identical black suits and ties,
carrying identical briefcases.
A warm sense of humor mani
fests itself in numerous shots: a
policeman in pantaloned motor
cycle britches stands in hands-on
hips contemplation of an arm-
I linked couple; a pair a narrow
j legs is ineongrously poined to a
large torso which, after a mo
ments observation, turns out to
be a photo mural with someone
j standing behind it.
The physical beauty of youth is
observed in the lithe and grace
ful forms of a co-ed resting
against a stack of history or art
texts in the bookstore. A group
of young A polios lean upon the
railing of the 1 Lake Lag boat
house. the sun glistening on their
bare backs and legs.
The flow of time, the intcr
j weaving of minds, the relation
ship of the generations, seem to
underlie the more than two hun
dred photographs in the exhibit.
This sense of time is particularly
i well expressed in a figure pass
ing between sunlight and shadow
under the arches of tin* Quad.
