# Panel Advises Forethought In Civil Rights Campaign
## 
### BANNING GARRETT 
"Although the civil l ights movement in the South lias the image
of being highly organized, as a student worker one should realize
that there vvil be much inefficiency and that efforts may be wasted,'
said Professor Sanford Dornbusch. executive head of the Depart
ment o£ Sociology, at yesterday's Student Congress meeting.

Other members of the panel"*
discussion on "Student Involve
ment in Civil Rights Activity,"
were John K. McDonough, acting
dean of the Law School; Robert j
MaAfee Brown, professor of Re- j
ligion; and moderator Dennis j
Sweeney, Student Cong r e s s
speaker.
"IF THEKE IS NOT proper or- i
ganization for the movement,"
said McDonough, "you may be j
.just milling around for a few
weeks. Before you decide to go, j
you should check into the organi-j

zation of the organization you
are supporting."
Dornbusch stated that there
j were jealousy and warfare
among some of the civil rights
I groups: "they are sometimes jeal
i ous of each others' successes and
j often disagree on policy." The stu
! dent should not go expecting to
| feel a part of a specific group;
i he will have to decide moral
j issues for himsell.
THE STUDENT should lake
; into account his motives before
j deciding to go. "There is glamour
involved the possibility of being
I killed, defying your parents, or
returning a hero," quipped Dorn
busch. Brown said, "support of
your commitments should not be
limited to your home address.
The panel stressed the probable
lack of concrete and immediate
| results of student work in the
i South next summer. "The only
i contribution you may make is
it hat others may learn from your
fai 1 u re," remarked Professor
Brown.
MCDONOUGH considered (he
implications of involvement with
the law while participating in the
reform movement. "Some laws
invoked against you may be in
valid under the Fourteenth
i Amendment of the Constitution;
I however, I would seriously con
sider the possibility and ramifica
tions of breaking valid Mississippi
laws."
Students should, however, "eon
,sider future embarrassment of
applying for .jobs, passports, or
such, when you will be asked
'Have you ever been convicted of
a criminal offense?' " McDonough
! said.

Brown.
MCDONOUGH considered (he
implications of involvement with
the law while participating in the
reform movement. "Some laws
invoked against you may be in
valid under the Fourteenth
i Amendment of the Constitution;
I however, I would seriously con
sider the possibility and ramifica
tions of breaking valid Mississippi
laws."
Students should, however, "eon
,sider future embarrassment of
applying for .jobs, passports, or
such, when you will be asked
'Have you ever been convicted of
a criminal offense?' " McDonough

"Although the civil l ights movement in the South lias the image
of being highly organized, as a student worker one should realize
that there vvil be much inefficiency and that efforts may be wasted,'
said Professor Sanford Dornbusch. executive head of the Depart
ment o£ Sociology, at yesterday's Student Congress meeting.

Other members of the panel"*
discussion on "Student Involve
ment in Civil Rights Activity,"
were John K. McDonough, acting
dean of the Law School; Robert j
MaAfee Brown, professor of Re- j
ligion; and moderator Dennis j
Sweeney, Student Cong r e s s
speaker.
"IF THEKE IS NOT proper or- i
ganization for the movement,"
said McDonough, "you may be j
.just milling around for a few
weeks. Before you decide to go, j
you should check into the organi-j

zation of the organization you
are supporting."
Dornbusch stated that there
j were jealousy and warfare
among some of the civil rights
I groups: "they are sometimes jeal
i ous of each others' successes and
j often disagree on policy." The stu
! dent should not go expecting to
| feel a part of a specific group;
i he will have to decide moral
j issues for himsell.
THE STUDENT should lake
; into account his motives before
j deciding to go. "There is glamour
involved the possibility of being
I killed, defying your parents, or
returning a hero," quipped Dorn
busch. Brown said, "support of
your commitments should not be
limited to your home address.
The panel stressed the probable
lack of concrete and immediate
| results of student work in the
i South next summer. "The only
i contribution you may make is
it hat others may learn from your
fai 1 u re," remarked Professor
Brown.
