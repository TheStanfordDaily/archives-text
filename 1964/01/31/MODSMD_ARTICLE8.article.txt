# #Social Bases Told Of Red Victories By DAVID

"Communism's victories h a v e
lx>cn won predominately in under-
I developed societies," Russian his
l.ory professor Hugh Seton-Wat-
I son told a large Tresidder audi
; once yesterday. In his speech he
presented some ideas which might
explain why I lie social, economic,
I and political situations in these
i countries are conducive to revolu
tionary upheaval.
The social base of most under
developed societies consists of an
impoverished, poorly equipped,
and illiterate peasant class and
! what he termed an uprooted "ur
ban poor." In contrast, lie said,
not only is the agrarian sector of
a country such as the United
States relatively well off in com
parison. but an "urban poor," that
is. millions of persons without
work or ties, is practically non
existent in the West.
The upper level in these socie
ties may also be viewed as con
sisting of two parts, he said.
There is usually a state bureau
cracy which differs little from
the traditionalist, despotic state
'machine by which the various
colonial powers formerly ran the
country and which, again, is quite
unlike a typical Western civil
service. Secondly, there is a class
of large land owners.
Superimposed on this social
composition is an intelligentsia,
he said. The intellectual elites of
the West have grown up and
mingle with the classes with
whom they share power. In un
derdeveloped societies, whe r e
modernization is not "natural"
but "deliberately willed and or
dered," these elites are usually
foreigners and natives educated
j abroad. They are isolated not
only from the masses but often
as well from the national govern
ing class itself.
Imbued with ultra-modern ideas
and finding itself in an isolated
"predicament," such an intelli
gentsia constitutes "the most im
portant factor in the formation
of revolutionary leadership," Sc
ion-Watson explained.
