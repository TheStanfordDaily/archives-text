# A 						STANFORD 'LEGEND IN HIS OWN TIME'
## Who is Allard Lowenstein? 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
Yesterday afternoon public discussion of a massive summer
project in the South began again at Stanford. It does not take much
of a prophet to predict that this discussion will continue, and that
before it is through Aaron Henry and the Mississippi Mock Election
will be brought up many times. And so will the name of Professor
Allard K. Lowenstein.
Virtually any Stanford student can tell you that Lowenstein was
one of the major forces behind the Mississippi mock election that
took this campus by storm last quarter. Most can tell you that he
was a dean and instructor at Stanford a few years back and that
his departure — along with that of his colleague William Craig
was sudden and never quite fully explained. But relatively few of
the many here who know his name and feel his influence know
precisely who and what the man is, what his aims and motivations
are, and what is and was his role at Stanford.
It is most doubtful that anyone is familiar with all of Lowen
stein's many accomplishments and involvements; to get him to talk
about himself is like trying to get Lyndon Johnson to deliver Ted
Sorenson speeches: it just doesn't fit his character and personality.

A superficial listing would in
clude his term as President of
the United States National Stu
dent Association (NSA) and as
national director of "Students for
Stevenson" during Adlai's bid for
the Presidency. He has served as
a personal assistant to Senator
Hubert Humphrey and his idol
Senator Frank Graham. He left
Humphrey's staff to join with
two others in a courageous in
formation-gathering mission to
South West Africa which, accord
ing to the "New Republic" was
undertaken "at the behest of the
Rev. Michael Scott and Messrs.
Kerina and Kozonguizi, three au
thorized petitioners before the
United Nations, who, along with
others, serve as representatives
of the African peoples of South
West Africa to the UN." The evi
dence, gathered under the incred
ible conditions of a police state,
was presented as testimony be
fore the Fourth Committee of the
United Nations General Assem
bly, and was related in Lowen
stein's book, Brutal Mandate.
Somewhere along the line he put
in a brilliant performance in ac-

quiring a degree from Yale Law School and has pursued his prin
ciples working everywhere from Mississippi to Generalissimo
Franco's famed Republic.
A MERE RECITATION of accomplishments, however, tells little
about Lowenstein's motivations, where the great distance lies be
tween him and the "political animal" who lives in the midst of a
political world merely out of love for the gamesmanship involved.
And the question of Lowenstein's role in the academic community
is yet to be touched.
Eleanor Roosevelt provided as good a statement as anyone who
has tried to relate his actions. In writing the foreword to Brutal
Mandate she said, "I have known Mr. Lowenstein for many years.
He is a person of unusual ability and complete integrity. I think
he will always fight crusades because injustice fills him with a sense
of rebellion. He wants to be of help in some way. . .
The most striking characteristic of Lowenstein's political atti
tudes, be he speaking of South West Africa, Mississippi, or student
government, is compassion. He organizes in Mississippi not out of
hate for the oppressor but out of love for the oppressed. The New
Republic's analysis of Brutal Mandate could well speak for Lowen
stein's entire philosophy of life: "The particular merit of this book
is its lively style, its regard for detail, its obvious compassion and
iis persuasive logic. The situation in South and South West Africa
is often so appalling and so discouraging that many writers take the
easy way out; they excoriate South Africa and leave it at that. Mr.
Lowenstein not only provides a lucid diognosis and prognosis but
also his indignation is tempered with real empathy for the white
minority. . . . Mr. Lowenstein bases his case against current South
African racial policies not so much on the grounds of Realpolitik
as on those of common decency, sane ethics, and the Judeo-Christian
heritage of the West which espouses the rights of all men to equal
opportunities for self-realization."
Lowenstein in the classroom might appear to be a withdrawal
from the activist role, but Lowenstein is a man passionately com
mitted to the relevance of academic pursuit. The perpetual group
of students sitting about him soon feel the same surge of an "aux
armes" attitude when he discusses the relationship between scien
tific breakthroughs and the broader currents of intellectual history
or debating "who came first, Copernicus or Kepler?," or listening
to him argue in behalf of graduate study, as they do when he dis
cusses civil rights.
WHEN LOWENSTEIN was at Stanford, during the 1961-62 school
year, he taught two courses: Government and Politics South of
the Sahara (winter quarter), and International Law (spring quar
ter). Both were upper division courses in the political science depart
ment. Teaching his first course at Stanford on as little-known a
topic as South Africa, he drew an enrollment of 53 students, seven
of them graduates. With the amount of interest in Africa he
brought to the campus and the amount of conversation in the dorms
discussing his lectures, one could have easily believed he had taught
a minimum of ten classes on the subject with 200 students enrolled
in each.

One of his former Stanford students, currently serving in Ihe
Peace Corps in Africa, commented on Lowenstein in the classroom:
''He has a singular ability to keep his own prejudices out. You know
his involvement, but what he delivers is an academic analysis and
not a political polemic. He never tells you what to think, but leads
you to every bit of information around and forces you to make a
decision." If one were to distill one particular "brand" of thought
held by Lowenstein's students in reference to South Africa, it is
that they have more understanding of and less bitterness toward
the oppressor than the average person who finds his sensibilities
offended by South Africa.
Those who attack Lowenstein's role in an academic community—
and any professor who meets great success with undergraduates
comes under attack -often state that his commitment detracts from
students' work in the classroom by drawing them too much into
social action at a campus, national, and international level. The
basic fallacy in this attack is that Lowenstein reaches his commit
ment intellectually, academically. One of his students of two years
ago relates, "There was a group of us gathered at the Theta Chi
House hashing out 'extra-curricular activities versus academics.'
Someone posed the question to Lowenstein. This was at the height
of the controversy over getting Stanford back into NSA; there were
about ten things being fought out on campus that we knew he felt
were of great meaning to Stanford students. We all expected him
to say 'forget about the classes, this is more important,' but he said
quite the opposite. What he said amounted to 'know your stuff.
Sometimes this means getting out the vote; sometimes it means
reading 20 hooks.' His picture of the ideal student is the one who is
an 'activist' in classes as well as in meeting social responsibility."
For Lowenstein, the educational process simply cannot be deemed
irrelevant to — let alone at odds with — "the world outside."
ASSUMING THAT there is more to the interchange of a com
munity of scholars than what goes on in the classroom, there is
more to be said of Lowenstein's role in that community. During his
year long stay at Stanford, where he combined his teaching with
acting as Assistant Dean of Men and Director of Stern Hall, his
Stern apartment was perpetually filled with students. Students met
each other there who would quite possibly have never come into con
tact over the obstacles of Stanford's social life; they came from all
parts of the campus, and all for different reasons. And Stanford
is still feeling the effects of their meeting, for it is just such meet
ings that spark the "new Stanford student." In his apartment, the
barrier between what goes on in Inner Quad and what goes on in
the residences was broken down.
Lowenstein's activities make him a living history text, of our
times. Once sparked off he can talk for hours of what Eleanor
Roosevelt told Jack Kennedy when . . . , the late Governor Lehman,
the reform Democratic movement in New York, the background to
an infinite number of political victories and losses. He continually
threatens to retreat for a while to write it all down; one doubts
that he ever will. The man needs a Bozwell—not T. E. Lawrence's
Lowell Thomas, but a faithful scribe.
With all this, why did Lowenstein leave Stanford? He has even
been quoted in the "Harvard Crimson" as saying that Stanford's
student body is "the greatest in the world." He has said he could
have stayed here forever. He wasn't fired, yet he couldn't stay. If
ever all the facts surrounding his departing become public, they
won't have come from Lowenstein; that is his particular brand of
loyalty. One evening, spring quarter, a group of students heard him
talking on the phone. He mentioned he was leaving, and the assump
tion was he felt there was something else he had to do. It soon
became known, however, that he was deciding among several alter
natives for the following year; it was obvious that — as a "Letter
to the Editor remarked this year in reference to Dean David Lari
mer's leaving — the "regime" had "brought about . . . that which I
imagine must be a truly difficult feat: the resignation of a dedi
cated and idealistic man."
LETTERS FLOWED into the Daily; editorials appeared. Twenty
nine students signed a letter which said in part, "The University
has always appeared indifferent to student needs and opinions. . . .
In the past year literally thousands of students have signed petitions
supporting one proposal or another. They have written bitter pro
test against the University's indifference and inaction. . . . The Uni
versity gave its answer in the none too mysterious resignations of
Dean Lowenstein, . . . exceptions to Stanford's general image of an
administrator . . . courageous, energetic, and deeply interested in
student problems; as such . . . won the respect and admiration of
the students.
The Stern House Presidents' Council submitted a letter protest
ing the "recent and sudden" resignation: "... Mr. Lowenstein has
given us excellent guidance and incentive to help ourselves on issues
of concern both to ourselves and to the campus. He has, from pre
reg week on, helped to develop self-confidence in the leaders of
Stern. He has been an exceptional campus leader, and we regret
that such a qualified man cannot remain at Stanford. . .
And from another aspect, eight top students submitted a letter
which read: "We know that we speak for the several hundred stu
dents who this year have taken courses in African Politics and
International Law and for the countless others who have been so
beneficially stimulated when we express our sense of deep regret
at th departure of Dean Allard Lowenstein from Stanford in June.
"In both of these complicated areas Dean Lowenstein has had
the very desirable combination of a comprehensive understanding of
the subject matter, an ability to effectively communicate it that has
seldom been equalled in our experience at Stanford, a background
of practical experience in these areas that make his courses ex
tremely meaningful, and the desire and ability to share learning
experiences with all who make themselves available no matter how
humble their credentials.
"Although we do not understand the peculiarities that have pre
vented the Political Science Department from keeping him at Stan
ford, we are grateful that we have this year had the opportunity
to study under Dean Lowenstein and sincerely hope that other
Stanford students in future years may have the same privilege."
But Lowenstein left, and is currently a Professor of Political Science
in his home state at North Carolina State College.
LOWENSTEIN'S PROBLEM is that he operates at a unique
level. He has the energy and talent to be teacher, administrator,
politician, author —simultaneously. When approached by three stu
dents working for the mock election last quarter, a Stanford political
science professor asked, "How can A 1 Lowenstein do everything I
am doing and do everything I feel I should do as well?" Perhaps
those who speak against Lowenstein's place in the academic com
munity are simply incapable of comprehending a man able to work
effectively on so many levels, for he who flatly denies an academic
role for a man with Lowenstein's beliefs denies the relevance of
the entire educational process to which we dedicate ourselves here.
Lowenstein will undoubtedly return to Stanford to speak, and
better a legend and a few speaking engagements than nothing at
all. But better yet would have been his continued stay here, for
the man himself is preferable to his legend.
