• Ranger Cameras Fail
PASADENA, Calif The United States'
moon exploration program hit another snag
yesterday when the camera-carrying Ranger
crashed into the moon without televising a
.single picture.

The Hill-pound spacecraft, launched three
days ago from Cape Kennedy, performed
beautifully up to the final 10 minutes of
flight, when its six cameras were supposed
to begin taking a series of 3,000 pictures from
900 miles high down to impact.
But they failed to operate. Scientists had
hoped the pictures would give them their first
close-up look at the moon's surface and help
them select a site for manned Apollo moon
ship landing later in this decade.
