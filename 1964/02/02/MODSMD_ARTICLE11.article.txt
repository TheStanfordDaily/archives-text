# Harvard-Stanford Graduate Admits: 'I Prefer Brand X'
## 
### SHANNON CLYNE 
Jonathan Ketehum, a 1954 Harvard graduate who studied Phil
osophical and Psychological Phenomenology at Stanford presented
a paper entitled "I Prefer Brand X" last night at Beta Chi.
Mr. Ketehum called his paper neither a dissertation nor a lecture
but a "real dramatic reading." He and the audience were the persons

of the drama. He described him
self as searching for a way to
say what he wanted to say. a way
in which the audience would be
"recollected to themselves."
OF THE MANY fragmentary
situations Mr. Ketchum presented
there was one which seems char
acteristic of his approach: "At an
army induction center we are be
ing told to fill our name in space
one, our age in space two, etc.,
and in space thirteen our religion.
What of the man who cannot put
down Catholic. Proestant, Jew,
or even agnostic or atheist? He
must put down an "X."
"I PREFER BRAND X," said
Ketchum. "I affirm not religion;
I affirm nothing. Neither am I an
existentialist."
When he had finished t licit?
was a silence and eventually the
questions started coming in.
There were questions from the
esoteric, the philologists, the crit
ics, but none from the onlookers
just as Ketchum had predicted.
Mr. Ketchum will be giving a
lecture, nay drama, at Tresidder
in mid-Fehruarv.
