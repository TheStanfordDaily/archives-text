# WSU Coeds May Reside Off Campus
## 
### 
Women students at Washing
lon State University who are
either 21 or have senior status
have received approval to live off
campus beginning with the 1964
Summer session, according to a
recent announcement by Presi
dent C. Clement French. Parental
permission must be obtained.
Last Spring, the Associated
Women's Students recommended
to the administration of WSU
that it change its policy to per
mit senior women to "live in
apartments at such time that ade
quate accommodations become
available."
WSI'S DEAN OF WOMEN
said the administration has been
working on the proposal since
September, but it "had been
thought about before." She said
that she didn't expect any great
exodus of senior women to apart
ments but she said that some will
undoubtedly be happy to take ad
vanlagc of the new ruling.
The vice-president of the Asso
ciated Women's Students said
that she was "very pleased" with
the decision. She also noted that
opinion on the effect of the deci
sion is varied." Some people say j
a lot of women will move out of |
dorms the first semester and
back in the second.
She went on to say that "this
is something we started last fall, i
The dorm presidents, through !
Ihe i r AWS representatives, j
formulated the recommendation \
and presented it to the administra- j
lion."
At Stanford, the only under- j
graduate women who may live
off campus are those who are I
either married, over 23 years old, |
or who live at home with their |
parents.
