# THE 						PROUD AND THE HUMBLE
## 
### 
Pride is at the root of all sin, and pride is the last tiling a person gives up
'■ fore becoming a Christian. Many who profess to be Christians ami who intellee
lally believe are not Christians at all because their pride alone keeps them from
receiving Jesus on a personal basis. No transition exists between "saved" and "lost."'
and the religious who believe intellectually, but who have not been regenerated by
the lfoly Spirit are just as lost as the most adamant atheists.
Man's pride is a protective membrane surrounding his ego, and man protects
his ego at every cost. If the ego remains enthroned in our hearts, we remain
children of the devil and cannot please God in anything we do. It is Christ y. >
wants to enter the throne room ofour hearts and reign thereafter from the deepest
recesses of our being. His presence (in the Person of the Holy Spirit) is unmistake
able. God never reworks a man, so rooten in the old human nature. Rather, < iod
gives each and every believer a totally new nature. (2 Cor. 5:17). The good be
havior and good works of the Christian are of God and note of oneself!
Man's very nature is to turn away from God continually, and pride is not totally
defeated even after the new birth. It was pride which caused the fall of the Arch
angel Lucifer when he saw his beauty and high position and tried to exalt himself
so as to be like God. (Is. 14:12-14). Satan introduced sin into the world, and mat
entire nature was infected wit hpride as a result of the fall. Since then man lias
repeatedly attempted to be God of his own world, or to worship man-made Gods,
or himself and his achievements instead of the true, living God. l"or example, today
many men bow before the organized body of knowledge called SCIENCE, believing
that it can rid the world of evil.
To see evidence of pride in an individual's life, one need only observe his tv
action to Jesus Christ. Just ask him, "What think ye of Christ?" The eternal Son
of God humbled Himself incredibly when lie lift llis home in glory and took on
the form of a man for 3.1 years. He suffered every shame and reproach, but
mained bumble and obedient even to death. The death He died and His suffer
ings were on our behalf. "He who knew no sin was made to be sin for us." Jit
was gentle, meek and lowly, despite His authority and power.
Non-Christians should consider the astounding claims that Jesus made for Him
self. He claimed to be God, the Creator, and the Saviour of all mankind, able to
do for us what no human being could ever do. Examine His humble, sinless life.
Then search your own heart for signs of pride which may be the only thing keep
ing you from an eternity with Christ.
"Let this mind be in you. which was also in Christ Jesus who being in t, ,>
form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: Hut made himself of no
reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness
of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became
obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly
exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name. That at the name
of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things on earth, anil
things under the earth: And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
Lord, to the Glory of God the Father." Phil. 2:5-11.

exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name. That at the name

Pride is at the root of all sin, and pride is the last tiling a person gives up
'■ fore becoming a Christian. Many who profess to be Christians ami who intellee
lally believe are not Christians at all because their pride alone keeps them from
receiving Jesus on a personal basis. No transition exists between "saved" and "lost."'
and the religious who believe intellectually, but who have not been regenerated by
the lfoly Spirit are just as lost as the most adamant atheists.
Man's pride is a protective membrane surrounding his ego, and man protects
his ego at every cost. If the ego remains enthroned in our hearts, we remain
children of the devil and cannot please God in anything we do. It is Christ y. >
wants to enter the throne room ofour hearts and reign thereafter from the deepest
recesses of our being. His presence (in the Person of the Holy Spirit) is unmistake
able. God never reworks a man, so rooten in the old human nature. Rather, < iod
gives each and every believer a totally new nature. (2 Cor. 5:17). The good be
havior and good works of the Christian are of God and note of oneself!
Man's very nature is to turn away from God continually, and pride is not totally
defeated even after the new birth. It was pride which caused the fall of the Arch
angel Lucifer when he saw his beauty and high position and tried to exalt himself
so as to be like God. (Is. 14:12-14). Satan introduced sin into the world, and mat
entire nature was infected wit hpride as a result of the fall. Since then man lias
repeatedly attempted to be God of his own world, or to worship man-made Gods,
or himself and his achievements instead of the true, living God. l"or example, today
many men bow before the organized body of knowledge called SCIENCE, believing
that it can rid the world of evil.
To see evidence of pride in an individual's life, one need only observe his tv
action to Jesus Christ. Just ask him, "What think ye of Christ?" The eternal Son
of God humbled Himself incredibly when lie lift llis home in glory and took on
the form of a man for 3.1 years. He suffered every shame and reproach, but
mained bumble and obedient even to death. The death He died and His suffer
ings were on our behalf. "He who knew no sin was made to be sin for us." Jit
was gentle, meek and lowly, despite His authority and power.
Non-Christians should consider the astounding claims that Jesus made for Him
self. He claimed to be God, the Creator, and the Saviour of all mankind, able to
do for us what no human being could ever do. Examine His humble, sinless life.
Then search your own heart for signs of pride which may be the only thing keep
ing you from an eternity with Christ.
