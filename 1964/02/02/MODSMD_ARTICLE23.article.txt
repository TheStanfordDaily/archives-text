# How Hard May 'Winds Of Freedom' Blow?
## COMMUNIST YOUTH WONDER 
### STEVE LEOPOLD International Editor 
There is a strange and some
what paradoxical war going on in
Eastern Europe today between the
communist officialdom and the
nonconformists of the young in
telligentsia.
The paradox is that the former
are beginning to act where form
erly they have feared to specific
ally, in Poland — while the de
mands of the latter are becom
ing prevalent in Czechoslovakia
and, of all places, Albania.
THE COMMUNISTS seemed to
have realized a few years ago that

they had to acquiesce, for a while
at least, to the advancing liberal
ization which started with the end
of the personality cult.
Yet they were unhappy in this
new role and quietly bided their
time until the nonconformists
went too far. Premier Khrushchev
set the style of the counter-attack
from above by blasting Russian
poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko and,
more recently, by venting some
of his more earthy colloquialisms
on the abstract paintings of young
Russian artists at an exhibition
last year. Among his least in
delicate criticisms, according to
the student magazine Youth and
Freedom, was that the eavases
were daubed as with an "ass's
tail."
Strangely, the Soviet "hard" line
has received a mixed reaction in
the satellite nations. In Poland,
j long Ihe center of "liberalism"

• communist stylo and in Czech
oslovakia, the party bosses are
giving with one hand and taking
away with the other.
WLADYSLAW Gomulka, head
the Polish Communist regime,
who this summer came out with
an 18,000-word criticism of pres
ent trends in Polish culture and
ideology, seems to be going
through the motions pro forma.
Indeed, after pledging to main
tain ideological conformity in the
mass media, which conform
pretty well anyway, he said, "The
Party does not want to interfere
in (artistic) worship matters and
does not intend to prescribe what
way books should be written or
how works of art should be pro
duced."
Yet, at the same time, Gomulka
announced that college graduates,
who had previously been allowed
to pick their own posts, were soon
going to have "legal instructions"
directing them to "work in com
pliance with the needs of the
economy and culture."
THIS NEW DECREE was pa
rallelled by a similar announce
ment in Czechoslovakia, where the
graduates will have to serve three
years at the post of the Party's
choice.
The studies themselves are
strictly planned. Specialization be
gins after two and a half years,
but usually the student has his
schedule strictly laid out from the
very beginning. Instruction in
Marxism-Leninism takes up time,
as does obligatory sports. Thus,
a general or "liberal" education
is almost non-existent in Czech

oslovakia regardless of ideological
| definition.
However, in Czechoslovakia
] also, the new nonconformity is
making itself known. Just as in
the West, numerous young men
and women are trying to go their
own way and some are succeed
ing.
According to the Student Mir
ror, an independent student news
service, t he "individualistic sym
bols of western youth blue jeans,
sloppy pullovers, beards— are par
ticularly often 1o be seen at the
universities."
IN ONE WINE restaurant in
Prague a life-size photo of the
American poet Allen Ginsberg
hangs above the stage. Jazz is also
"big" with the new set.
And, surprisingly, the Student
Mirror observes, "for the moment
! the Party does not appear to want
to place any obstacles in the way
of the advancing liberalization."
The jazz restaurants are often a
third full of soldiers; soldiers who
are not even forbidden to display
a beard if they already had such
a beard when they joined up.
Probably the most bellingerent
and the most hard-pressed satel
lite in the communist world is
Albania. The Hoxha regime has
a particularly complicated job in
trying to insulate its youth from
"harmful ideas," since it is obliged
to wage the struggle on two
fronts, against "bourgeois" — i.e.
Western and simultaneously,
"revisionist" i.e. Soviet — influ
ences. And unfortunately for tlie
Party, no countries exert a great
er cultural influence on Albania
than do her nearest neighbors,
"revisionist" Yugoslavia and
("bourgeois" Italy. Italian and
Yugoslav radio programs are eas
! ily heard in Albania, and since Al

bania has no television station as
yet, her television owners all 300
of them must watch Italian pro
grams.
Most of the movies shown in Al
bania are Chinese, of course, but
China isn't much in the movie
trade, so the bulk of the load is
handled by Eastern Europe not
Russia and again, Italy.
In a recent edition, the Party
journal "Bruga e Partise" com
plained about th e increasing
amount of sadness appearing in
Albanian poems.
CHOOSING ONE POEM where
a young writer expressed great
anguish over some unfortunate
love episode, the journal editorial
ized, "Socialist humanism is one
of the primary principles which
must rule in our works. Youth
must be educated not through
flighty love affairs, or dissillusion
ments, bi;t through great and bold
emotions."
And so the battle continues. The
'revisionist" part of the
ist world, led by the Soviet Union,
seems to feel that a little freedom
and outside influence is needed to
make their young understand, as
isolated and belligerent Albania
and China do not, that there is

an outside world different and
powerful, a foe not to ho beaten
by bombs alone. Yet, ;is has often
been said, a little learning is a
dangerous thing. The reaction
against "bourgeois" liberalization
as in Poland sets in.
But one has the feeling that
even in the communist world, the
absurdity of the anecdote reported
in the Abanian journal will event
ually become apparent and hu
morous:
The Party reporter noted a
painter who had been waiting for
days for "an attractive and won
derfully clad girl" to appear so
that lie could complete his paint
ing. To the reporter's serious re
mark that he would prefer to see
"a panoramic painting depicting
these happy days," the painter's
sole comment was: "What? ! "
