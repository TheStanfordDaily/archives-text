# HOT LINE TO THE SIDELINE
## Mid-Season Review Shows Cagers Better Than Record 
### TOM ELIAS 
It's midseason break time right now for Stanford's basketball
team, currently in the midst of a two week recess from any action.
The Tribe resumes action 1 his weekend with a two-game series at
Pullman, Wash, against the Cougars of WSU.
But light now is a good time for an evaluation of what has gone
before. With a more nine games remaining on their schedule, Coach
Howie Dallmar's boys sport at 9-7 mark, considerably less than they
had expected to have at this juncture.
ROAI) fIAMKS HURT RKCORI)
This record, dismal compared to what Card rooters had hoped
for and expected, is still not a bad one, when certain factors are
taken into consideration. Stanford has lost five games in a row,
all on the road. Bui a look at the records of the three units respon
sible for the recent debacle shows that none of these teams has lost
a home game all season. UCLA, while playing a minimum of road
games all season, has yel to lose to anyone. Meanwhile Oregon State,
loser of only three games all year, dropped one to Cincinatti in Port
land, but hasn't lost at all in Corvallis. Utah, also hasn't lost at home,
so Stanford was clearly at a dis-

advantage playing these teams.
Coach Howie Dallmar feels that
his team could have hung in on
even terms with any of these
teams on a neutral floor or in his
own cozy and antique Pavilion,
where the Tribe has yet to lose
this season.
PARTISAN CROWDS
At UCLA three weeks ago, the
first game of the series was
played in Ihe Sports Arena in a
doubleheader that included Cal
and USC. The crowd was there
fore not entirely partisan for
UCLA and Ihe Indians hung in
tight until midway through the

second half, when Ihe Bruins pro
ceeded to run them right off the floor. The next night, with a highly
partisan Santa Monica C.C. crowd jeering at them, Stanford fell
behind by 10 in the first two minutes and was never in the game.
As Stanford faces its remaining nine game, Dallmar refuses to
concede that Stanford might not still win the Big Six crown and the
automatic NCAA tournament bid. He does, however, admit that his
club has at least one serious weakness — lack of speed on Ihe back
line and in the corners.
LACK OF SPEED HURTS
This very lack of speed was pinpointed by an Oregon Sports col
umnist, A 1 Lightner, after watching Stanford in action at Corvallis.
Dallmar, says Lightner, "has the size and good shooters" on his team
this season, "Yet he hasn't got the extra half step or full step in
going for the loose balls, reacting to sudden defensive switches or
racing from one end of the court to the other."
Fortunately, the schedule eases up a bit for Dallmar's boys the
rest of the way. The only game they should really need to worry
about is the one on Feb. 22 against UCLA. And that one is in the
cozy old Pavilion right on the Farm.
So right now it looks like Stanford's record on March 5 should
be just about as good as it was at that time last year, when it stood
at 16-9, not a bad record in any league.

team, currently in the midst of a two week recess from any action.
The Tribe resumes action 1 his weekend with a two-game series at
Pullman, Wash, against the Cougars of WSU.
But light now is a good time for an evaluation of what has gone
before. With a more nine games remaining on their schedule, Coach
Howie Dallmar's boys sport at 9-7 mark, considerably less than they
had expected to have at this juncture.
ROAI) fIAMKS HURT RKCORI)
This record, dismal compared to what Card rooters had hoped
for and expected, is still not a bad one, when certain factors are
taken into consideration. Stanford has lost five games in a row,
all on the road. Bui a look at the records of the three units respon
sible for the recent debacle shows that none of these teams has lost
a home game all season. UCLA, while playing a minimum of road
games all season, has yel to lose to anyone. Meanwhile Oregon State,
loser of only three games all year, dropped one to Cincinatti in Port
land, but hasn't lost at all in Corvallis. Utah, also hasn't lost at home,
so Stanford was clearly at a dis-

advantage playing these teams.
Coach Howie Dallmar feels that
his team could have hung in on
even terms with any of these
teams on a neutral floor or in his
own cozy and antique Pavilion,
where the Tribe has yet to lose
this season.
PARTISAN CROWDS
At UCLA three weeks ago, the
first game of the series was
played in Ihe Sports Arena in a
doubleheader that included Cal
and USC. The crowd was there
fore not entirely partisan for
UCLA and Ihe Indians hung in
tight until midway through the

second half, when Ihe Bruins pro
ceeded to run them right off the floor. The next night, with a highly
partisan Santa Monica C.C. crowd jeering at them, Stanford fell
behind by 10 in the first two minutes and was never in the game.
As Stanford faces its remaining nine game, Dallmar refuses to
concede that Stanford might not still win the Big Six crown and the
automatic NCAA tournament bid. He does, however, admit that his
club has at least one serious weakness — lack of speed on Ihe back
line and in the corners.
LACK OF SPEED HURTS
This very lack of speed was pinpointed by an Oregon Sports col
umnist, A 1 Lightner, after watching Stanford in action at Corvallis.
Dallmar, says Lightner, "has the size and good shooters" on his team
this season, "Yet he hasn't got the extra half step or full step in
going for the loose balls, reacting to sudden defensive switches or
racing from one end of the court to the other."
Fortunately, the schedule eases up a bit for Dallmar's boys the
rest of the way. The only game they should really need to worry
about is the one on Feb. 22 against UCLA. And that one is in the
cozy old Pavilion right on the Farm.
So right now it looks like Stanford's record on March 5 should
be just about as good as it was at that time last year, when it stood
at 16-9, not a bad record in any league.
