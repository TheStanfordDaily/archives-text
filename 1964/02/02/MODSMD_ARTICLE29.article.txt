# SHOW IMPROVED, BALANCED ATTACK
## Indian Ruggers Beat Universities Club 
### PETER EAKLAND 
Getting better and better every
time it plays, Stanford played
steady, aggressive rugby Satur
day and walloped a good Univer
sities Club of L.A. squad 2f)-.'-5 in
a colorful, exciting contest. The
scrum play, headed by second
rowman Dick Leeuwenburg, who
controlled most lineouts, played
its best game of the season.
The Indian rushing attack, also
outstanding, displayed good con
sistency and balance as five Stan
ford tries were spread among as
many players. Wing and handler
jof kicking duties, when in the
game, Bob Burke, tallied 12 points
Jon 2 penalty kicks and three con
j versions.
THE ST A li T I N G hackfield,
I which returned intact from las*
year, includes Bob Price ;ii scrum
] half, Gordon Waddell at Ist %.
i Clark Weaver at 2nd •'«, and
j Steve Van Nort at center %. Hav*
ling worked together for a year,
they know each other's mover
and through a sense of anticipa
tion developed through experi
ence always seem to be in the
right place at the right time.
Stanford ruggers have claimed
lor eoclaimed Coast rugby su
! premacy for each of the last three
years. This year's squad, possibly
better than recent squads, should
earn equivalent laurels.
Stanford dominated the entire
game Saturday but got off to a
rather shaky start. It kept the
| ball in club territory only by vir
tue of the accurate feet of Gor
don Waddell.
SEVERAL TIMES, he gathered
in a bouncing ball while running
| backwards and kicked the ball
| with either foot 40 yards upfield
where it found touch. His touch
| kicking, in purpose a defensive
i device, kept the Indians on the
J offensive.
Stanford knocked on the visit -
I or's door several times early in
j the game but couldn't get on the
scoreboard. Well-executed rushes
by the Indians, especially by
Steve Van Nort and "Tricky"
Dick Shaw, fell exasperatingly
I short of the goal; and Waddeil
j kicked short or wide on three pen
alty kicks from the right. Fans
were prepared to witness a tight
i contest.
Stanford finally broke the ice.
(Controlling a scrum at midfield,
; the hackfield rushed right. Van
< Nort soon had the ball, and he
I turned upfield and passed outside
to Shaw.
STOPPED AFTER a 20-yard
j gallop, he tossed inside to Frank
! Patitucci who in turn passed in
side to fellow breakaway Steve
Pursell, who scored. Waddell con
certed and the Indians were
I ahead s*o.

The Card ruggers were again I
in enemy territory. Waddell
missed a penalty kick, but only
minutes later Bob Burke con
nected on one from 25 yards out |
in the center of the field. Phil
Need started the Indians' second
try-producing rush. Two inside
passes and Van Nort had the ball ;
with a clear field in front of him. |
He touched the ball down in the
center, and Burke converted
Down 13-0, the Universities ;
Club briefly showed the form that j
had carried them to two previous |
victories. Some good kicking!
brought it into Stanford territory. |
The L.A. squad side-kicked a pen- j
a 11\ kick on the extreme left of
the field at about the 25-yard !
stripe. 2nd r, s Terry Murphy took !
a lateral pass going towards the i
center of the field, and after tak
ing several steps, drilled a drop !
kick through the uprights for
three points.
ROB BURKE finished the first
half scoring with a penalty kick,
and Stanford has a 10-3 bulge.
And the Indians let down not a
bit in the second half.
Dick Leeuwenburg fielded a

kick on about the Universities' 35.
The ball went to Waddell w ho
passed to Van Nort. He muscled

his way upfield until finally con
tained on about the ir>, at which
point ho flipped outside to Rrad
Freeman who stormed toward iho
left corner and ultimately found
i! for a score. The angle on t he
conversion was difficult, and Jon
Brandin's kick was wide.
On the strength of Clark Wea
ver's touch kicking, the Indians'
ret urned to ihe scene of the
crime. A penalty thwarted the
onsurging Indians, but only mo
mentarily.
\I Ti:n A St'HUM on the five.
Waddell blocked a kick. Weaver
kicked the loose ball into the goal
iron and pounced on it for the
score. A Burke conversion made
the score 21-3.
In the next few minutes, the
Indians rushed well but futile
were their efforts. A forward pass
nullified a beautiful exchange of
jf passes between Waddell and
Weaver that would have produced
a try. Phil Neal was stopped in
side the one-yard line after a rush.
Waddell drop kicked after a pen
alty. but the ball fell short.
Stanford's Bob Price, on an en
suing scrum, got the ball and he
passed to Waddell, who scam
pered untouched into the in-goal
area for the final score.
The J.V. ruggers lost to the
varsity squad of the Universities
Club of Berkeley 13-0. The scrum
played well, but bad passing kept
the J.V.'s from mounting an ef
fective offensive.

STANFORD'S GORDON WADDELL, star kicker and plciymaker, pre

Other identifiable Indian ruggers are Dick Shaw (23), Brad Free

Getting better and better every
time it plays, Stanford played
steady, aggressive rugby Satur
day and walloped a good Univer
sities Club of L.A. squad 2f)-.'-5 in
a colorful, exciting contest. The
scrum play, headed by second
rowman Dick Leeuwenburg, who
controlled most lineouts, played
its best game of the season.
The Indian rushing attack, also
outstanding, displayed good con
sistency and balance as five Stan
ford tries were spread among as
many players. Wing and handler
jof kicking duties, when in the
game, Bob Burke, tallied 12 points
Jon 2 penalty kicks and three con

Stanford ruggers have claimed
lor eoclaimed Coast rugby su
! premacy for each of the last three
years. This year's squad, possibly
better than recent squads, should
earn equivalent laurels.
Stanford dominated the entire
game Saturday but got off to a
rather shaky start. It kept the
| ball in club territory only by vir
tue of the accurate feet of Gor
don Waddell.
SEVERAL TIMES, he gathered
in a bouncing ball while running
| backwards and kicked the ball
| with either foot 40 yards upfield
where it found touch. His touch
| kicking, in purpose a defensive
i device, kept the Indians on the
J offensive.
Stanford knocked on the visit -
I or's door several times early in
j the game but couldn't get on the
scoreboard. Well-executed rushes
by the Indians, especially by
Steve Van Nort and "Tricky"
Dick Shaw, fell exasperatingly
I short of the goal; and Waddeil
j kicked short or wide on three pen
alty kicks from the right. Fans
were prepared to witness a tight
i contest.
Stanford finally broke the ice.
(Controlling a scrum at midfield,
; the hackfield rushed right. Van
< Nort soon had the ball, and he
I turned upfield and passed outside
to Shaw.
STOPPED AFTER a 20-yard
j gallop, he tossed inside to Frank
! Patitucci who in turn passed in
side to fellow breakaway Steve
Pursell, who scored. Waddell con
certed and the Indians were
I ahead s*o.

The Card ruggers were again I
in enemy territory. Waddell
missed a penalty kick, but only
minutes later Bob Burke con
nected on one from 25 yards out |
in the center of the field. Phil
Need started the Indians' second
try-producing rush. Two inside
passes and Van Nort had the ball ;
with a clear field in front of him. |
He touched the ball down in the
center, and Burke converted
Down 13-0, the Universities ;
Club briefly showed the form that j

victories. Some good kicking!
brought it into Stanford territory. |
The L.A. squad side-kicked a pen- j

the field at about the 25-yard !
stripe. 2nd r, s Terry Murphy took !
a lateral pass going towards the i
center of the field, and after tak
ing several steps, drilled a drop !
kick through the uprights for
three points.
ROB BURKE finished the first
half scoring with a penalty kick,
and Stanford has a 10-3 bulge.
And the Indians let down not a
bit in the second half.
Dick Leeuwenburg fielded a

kick on about the Universities' 35.
The ball went to Waddell w ho
passed to Van Nort. He muscled

his way upfield until finally con
tained on about the ir>, at which
point ho flipped outside to Rrad
Freeman who stormed toward iho
left corner and ultimately found
i! for a score. The angle on t he
conversion was difficult, and Jon
Brandin's kick was wide.
On the strength of Clark Wea

ret urned to ihe scene of the
crime. A penalty thwarted the
onsurging Indians, but only mo
mentarily.
\I Ti:n A St'HUM on the five.
Waddell blocked a kick. Weaver
kicked the loose ball into the goal
iron and pounced on it for the
score. A Burke conversion made
the score 21-3.
In the next few minutes, the
Indians rushed well but futile
were their efforts. A forward pass
nullified a beautiful exchange of
jf passes between Waddell and
Weaver that would have produced
a try. Phil Neal was stopped in
side the one-yard line after a rush.
Waddell drop kicked after a pen
alty. but the ball fell short.
Stanford's Bob Price, on an en

passed to Waddell, who scam

The J.V. ruggers lost to the

played well, but bad passing kept
