# Does A Good Newspaper Have To Be Dull?
## Editorial 
### 
Beginning with this edition, The Stan
ford Daily will be undergoing some major
innovations — innovations designed to make
this a more interesting, attractive and re
sponsible newspaper.
Our editorial page will be greatly ex
panded to include more than a dozen regu
lar student columnists, covering such areas
as international and national politics (most
of the political spectrum will be amply dcp«
resented), campus politics, campus humor,
books, movies and theater. In addition, The
Daily w ill soon begin a weekly symposium,
entitled "The Formn," in which two or more

faculty members, students or prominent na
tional authorities will be invited to express
opposing views on controversial topics.
Also appearing on the editorial page will
be news analysis — written by staff members
who, after extensive research, will attempt
to objectively interpret current events. And,
shortly, we hope to have political cartoons
dealing principally with Stanford — which
will be drawn by our own staff artists.
As for our news policy, we go along with
the New York llcrald Tribune motto: "A
good newspaper doesn't have to be dull."
That's whv we will be striving for more at

tractive layout and more colorful writing.
Each morning we will be running a
lengthy "World News" column. The Daily
is the only day-by-day publication many stu
dents read. Because of this, then, we believe
we have an obligation to inform our readers
of world news developments.
We will continue our policy ol running
news of the national and international stu
dent community. To strengthen this cover
age, we will eventually employ correspon
dents, working on a stringer commission

basis, at nearly a do/en major American uni
versities. We w ill also have correspondents
at each of the Stanford overseas campuses.
Another addition to the paper will be a
weekly entertainment page — which will in
clude special entertainment features and a
listing and summary of top Bay Area mov
ies, theater, opera and art shows.

In regard to editorial policy, The Daily
this volume will continue supporting such
things as a truly non-sectarian religious pol
icy, student activism in civil rights, LASSI' s
right to speak out on national issues and

broader responsibility tor Mens Council.
Hut, in addition to supporting these rights
isucs, we hope this volume to begin a dis
cussion ot Stanford education — to examine
closely such areas as the Ccneral Studies
Program, the senior eolloquia, the grading
system, the faculty-student ratio and the
overseas campuses.
In short, we will assume the role oJ a
responsible newspaper. We plan to ques
tion, to criticize and to praise. And, above
all, we plan to be candid.
Our motive is a deep commitment to the
welfare ot this Universitv.
