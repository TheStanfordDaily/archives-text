## Exigencies Demand U.S. Recognize Red China 
### Stephen Shefler 
One week ago today France and the People's Republic of China
established diplomatic relations in a step that could lead to a respon
sible China policy by the Western Alliance. II further progress is
to be made, however, the United States must abandon its negative
policy of non-recognition, and turn toward a positive solution of
world problems.
Since 1949 the United States' government has based its policy
of non-recognition of Red China on upholding the lost cause of Na
tionalist China. The fiction lhat the Nationalists can recapture the
mainland is a stale joke that any realistic observed has long since
abandoned. The Nationalist Army is insufficient to combat the large
forces on the mainland. The United States would not risk war with
Russia by aiding a Nationalist invasion. The fallacy that the people
of tiie mainland are on the brink of rebellion has been proven false
by capable foreign correspondents. A two-China policy is, therefore,
inevitable, and the inevitable cannot and should not be ignored.
The exigencies of the international situation make it imperative
ihat we no longer delay our recognition of the Communist Chinese.
The critical situations that face the United States in Laos, and South
Vietnam call for realistic discussion, but how can we expect success
ful negotiations to proceed without representation from one of the
two major forces involved in the conflict. Similarly the accepted
observation that Red China will have nuclear weapons by the dec
ade's end, further necessitates the opening of diplomatic channels.
Any nuclear negotiations in Ihe coming years that would fail to
include Red China will be unrealistic half-way measures. The rise of
this Far Eastern giant no longers permits us to foolishly turn our
heads and pretend it doesn't exist.
EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT as diplomatic recognition of Red
China is the admission of this leading power into the United Na
tions. The United Nations purports to be a representative body of
the world's peoples, and yet excludes the most populous country of
all. Solutions of international conflict cannot be achieved by the
United Nations if it fails to include any of the major world powers
as Korea so notably showed—where words failed man turned to
bullets and devestation.
The United States has recently stated that our non-recognition
ol Red China and successful efforts to keep her our of the United
Nations have strengthened our position in South East Asia but the
lasts do not bear them out. The leading nations of this area, India.
Indonesia and Milasia (formerly Milayat have not only sponsored
United Nations membership for Red China but have been sharply
critical of the United States for our 'Head-in-the-Sand' attitude. As
for our commitments lo the SEATO Alliance that would be sup
posedly endangered, it should be noted that only three (including
ihe United States) our of the ten nations in the pact do not presently
recognize the Communist regime in Peiking.
li is inane to deny that recognition and admission to the United
Nations of Red China would not have some detrimental affect in
South East Asia, but nothing will be accomplished by delay. It is
better to face up to the situation now than to let our position deteri
orate to where the price will be too great.
II cannot be contended that admission of Red China to the United
Nations will establish sweet and reasonable discourse. But the
United Nations, was never meant to be a place of concord, but a
forum where opposite poles could confront one another and reach
agreement. The admission of Red China will additionally expose
thai nation to the disciplines of world criticism by placing its mis
deeds before the world. By opening the channels of communication
with Red China, we shall thus force her into a position of greater
political responsibility. If we continued to exclude Red China from
the United Nations, we will only delay the solution of world prob
ems and widen the separation between East and West.
BOKC'HARD and Lage in "Neutrality for the United States"
have stated concerning this nation's stand on Red China, "A country
refusing to recognize a fact must either content itself with making
faces or fighting. Little satisfaction can be derived from either
policy." It is important, therefore, that we take the sensible alterna
tive and open diplomatic relations with Red China and bring her
into the United Nations. By opening the lines of communications
we can seek understanding, if only for self-defense. By initiating
lines of communication we can break down the fallacies behind the
•'hate U.S. policy" of the Communist regime. An open door in China
would again allow the study of Chinese civilization and culture and
access to essential sources. Most important, however, we can open
the way for fruitful diplomatic negotiations. By establishing a
forum for discussion, we can settle our differences at the conference
table instead of the battlefield.
Lawrence Wiley in Village in the Vaiieluse points to the fact
that French children have come to replace fisticuffs with words.
The example of these children can be a good lesson to us all.
Recognition of Red China and her admission to the United Nations
can lead to a situation where we will replace bullets, tanks, and
bombs with words, negotiations and settlements, and thus make our
world a safer and saner place in which to live.
