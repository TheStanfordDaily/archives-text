# Keane's Work Inspires Low Level Protest
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
Dear >liss Rogers and others:
Surprisingly enough, since I
I was one of the infamous delin
quents who disrupted the Keane
j lecture, I read your letter in the
Daily. The activities in which I
j participated were immature, self
ish and rude, and I am immature
selfish and rude, . . . sometimes.
Now however, I am turning to
a medium suggested by others
j with more mature levelhcaded
j ness, as a more appropriate
means of expressing an opinion.
.... When I read that we were
to he blessed with a visit from
that commercial phenomenan,
| Margaret Keane, who is more in
volved with self promotion than
! art, I laughed. Margaret Keane
! is a joke. No one is used more
often as a bad example by people
j who sincerely respect Art. It is
! because I sincerely respect art as
a medium of expression, it is be-
I cause I feel Margaret Keane's
I work is a rude affrontation to
| fine art, that I feel justified in
| some kind of protestation.
Mrs. Keane's art work ;md the
philosophy surrounding it are on
such a low level, I was inspired
to a low level of protestation, i.e.,
rude laughter, disturbing noises,
etc.. etc. I now publicly apologize
for the means of my protesting.
But I do not apologize for protest
ing, for I shall protest until my
dying day to Mrs. Keane and her
Likes.
As a person who might be con
fronted by other's opinions on my
art work (as suggested by Miss
Rogers) I should lie disturbed if
people like the members of the
| Stanford Art Department met my
efforts with intolerance. How
lever, I should be disturbed not in
j tiie least if the people who enjoy
' Mrs. Keane's art find 1 have little
j to offer them in my art. I will
perhaps never make as much
I money as Mrs. Kearne, but 1 will
J never be unethical and fraudu
lent.

• Freedom Impairment
Kditor, The Daily:
.... The Union Board is not
responsible for programs spon
sored by other groups in Tresid
der, but it is a policy of the Board
I tlud the building exists to serve

all parts of the Stanford commu
nity. The Board has tried to estab
lish in the Union an atmosphere
that will encourage a wide va
riety of programs, sponsored by
a broad range of campus organi
zations, and appealing to as many
different groups on the campus
as possible. Its success in doing
this has meant that any univer
sity organization can present
legitimate programs of interest
to a part of the Stanford commu
nity in the Union.
The pr o gram 11 he Keane
speech | that AWS presented fell
within those criteria, and well
over 100 members of the Stan
ford community attended it. Both
AWS and Mrs. Keane were en
lit led to a quiet and orderly audi
ence. and those 100 auditors were
entitled to hear the speaker and
ask questions of her. . . .
The heckling of any speaker is
below the level of intelligent con
duct; the insult is compounded
when it occurs to a guest of the
university. The "mere chaos"
that was created Tuesday was so
childish as to be beyond belief.
That sort of behavior seems
strangely anomolous among a stu
dent body that is vociferous in
its demands for a maximum
amount of freedom and individual
responsibility; it is reasonable to
assume that it could lead to an
impairment of the atmosphere
that now prevails in which any
group can hear any speaker on
any subject in the Union. The
fredom of individual protest docs
not include the right to prevent
other students and faculty mem
bers from participating in pro
grams and activities of interest
to them.

.... A cause is seldom ad

• Hold Zetes" Hands
Editor, The Daily:
Lo! The Poor Zetes! They
should have their hands held and
bottoms spanked by the Admin
istration. They are old enough to
join the Peace Corps or the .serv
ice, and many of them are old
enough to vote, but they are
neither old enough to understand
that freedom does not mean li
cense nor to accept the blame
for their own misbehavior. No.
it was all the fault of Stanford
University!
And who will hold their hands
and take the responsibility for
their actions when they leave the
university and go out into the big
bad world? If they have not
learned by that time that they
are responsible for their own
choices, who will teach them?
Mr. Dubofsky and Mr. Haider
made admirable attempts to pass
the buck. Perhaps there IS one
thing that the Administration
could do for each Zete: send him
a plaque for his desk that reads.
"The buck stops here."
The winds of freedom blew
and the Zetes were blown away!

Editor, The Daily:
We do not know with whom
and with how many German stu
dents Mr. Naylor has spoken.
Has he perhaps received his in
formation from a sympathiser of
the communist Eastern German
Government or from one of the
very small neutrallstic groups?
li seems to us and the majority
of the students in Germany un
believeable that a neutral Ger
many, without any political or
economic relations either with the
West or super-national organiza
tions such as NATO, can lie the
price for the so longed for reuni
fication of our country.
There is among the younger
generation an increasing will for
reunification, but never at the
uncertain price —for both, Ger
many and the West of a Utopian
neutrality or political and eco
nomic isolation, a solution which
finally will lead to an absorp
tion into the Soviet sphere.
