# From The Right
## Both Far Left, Radical Claim Monopoly On Truth 
### Allan Anderson 
The American political scene is marked by an emphasis on liberal
ism and conservatism. The loudest and most active though by no
means the most numerous voices coming from the political spec
trum are those of the left and the right. The mainstream of American
political action and opinion, however, flows somewhere in the broad
area in between left and right. The adherents of both these points of
view are aware of their philosophical and ideological unity with their
compatriots, and they are willing and ready to debate they might
say instrucl the opposition.
This awareness and philosophical emphasis is largely due to the
| efforts of the senator from Arizona in giving leadership to the con
servative position. The political discussion which lias resulted can be
a good thing, for it broadens political knowledge and interest, and
i develops and analyzes new ideas that can eventually be worked into
the main structure of American political thought. However, such dis
cussion is very difficult and often proves futile. There are several
reasons for this futility, and the fault, I think, must lie borne by both
i left and right.
THE WEAPONS iif political conflict must be improved. Shib
: boleths and cliches are generally preferred to logic and facts. Both
sides believe or profess to believe â€”what is really only a caricature
| of the opposition. To the ardent liberal, all conservatives are mean,
! wealthy old men whose sole interest is the accumulation of economic
power. The conservative, says the liberal, is against everything and
for absolutely nothing. On the other hand, the conservative thinks
| that all liberals are secret revolutionaries who want to undermine the
] Republic and destroy individual initiative. All liberals, suspects the
ardent l ightest, are extreme welfare starters, probably socialists, and
possibly even communist sympathizers.
Both the political right and left have a tendency to use the terms
left and right, conservative and liberal, for evaluation as well as
classification. A liberal can by this method, reject any idea or course
j simply by labeling it conservative. The same process can be and
often is used by members of the political right. This method of refu
tation does not lead to constructive argumentation.
At the root of these difficulties lies the dogmatic ideological na
tures of both the right and left. Members of both sides are thoroughly
convinced of the righteousness of their cause. Each is certain that his
side has a monopoly on political truth. Certainly any political activist
must necessarily be convinced that he is right, but the total closing
i of one's mind to alternative ideas and actions is foolish if not danger
ous.
There is something religious in the devotion of both the far left
and far right to their respective causes. The feeling that they belong
to a group that thinks the same way they do is very important to
these people. They gather in great numbers to hear a spokesman of
| their particular group expound the gospel, applauding when the "cor
j rect" philosophical points are made even if not stated with particular
eloquence. The read as scripture the opinions expressed in their
| favorite journal of opinion. It is a small step from a group that
thinks the same way as its members to one Ihat on many points
thinks for its members. When a new political issue evolves, the good
conservative and the good liberal run straight to their favorite
opinion magazine to discover what position they are to take on this
issue.
The dogmatism and the consequent absence of thought, although
it is, perhaps, not as exaggerated as I have made it appear, has led
both the right and left into ineonsistaneies. What might be called the
"dictator dilemma" is an example of such an ineonsistancy. The left
and the right, both of which are supposed to be philosophically
opposed to dictators, find no difficulty in supporting the dictators
of their choice.
THE CONSERVATIVES in general support all those dictatorships
that are anti-communist; the liberals usually take the ones that are
i left. Since il is quite easy to be anti-communist when the reward for
I such a stand is economic and military aid from the United States, the
right usually supports more dictators than the left. Support is given
to Franco in Spain because he is anti-communist and because he is
there. His right to exercise power derives solely from the fact that
1 he holds power. Even after the fall of the Diem regime in South
1 Viet Nam, some conservative voices were heard urging support for a
family dictatorship that could speak of the suicides of Buddhist
monks as barbeques.
On the other hand, many liberals see no ineonsistancy in arguing
for the admission of Red China to the U.N. and at the same time urg
! ing the expulsion of South Africa. This approach amounts to saying
that it is somehow less immoral for China to oppress and kill its own
j citizens as well as those of neighboring nations against whom it
supports guerilla warfare than it is for South Africa to oppress and
! deprive its Negro population. At the time of the Cuban crisis, liberals
were urged to become more angry with the rule in the Dominican
i Republic every time Castro started causing trouble. Castro, you see,
is a good reforming dictator who is picked on by the United States;
the rulers of the Dominican Republic were not.
It would seem more logical for both left and right to take an
uncompromising stand against dictatorships. Perhaps dictatorships
are in some cases unavoidable if not necessarily desirable. Where
economic crisis, war, or lack ol education on the part of the citizen
ary temporarily require rule by one or by a few, we should at least
make our opposition to tyranny known and take steps to correct the
| situation as soon as possible.
The problem of dictators is just one of several in which members
I of both the political right and left forget to think and rely on the
dogmatic maxims of the group. We should take our stands on issues
by analysis of the problem involved rather than by the stands on the
! issue taken by the political grouping with which we usually associate
ourselves.
Future columns will deal with further aspects of the inconsis
' lancies in thought of both the far left and radical rigid.
