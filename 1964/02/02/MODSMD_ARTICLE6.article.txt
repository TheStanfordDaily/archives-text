No one lias ever called Indone
sian President Sukarno a C'al
viuist Puritan or a Gandhian
ascetic.
But recently, Sukarno made
some rather iieo-Xhuish re
marks about that "wild West
ern dance" — the Twist — in a
speech to 10,000 students in
'larkarfa.
Declaring that the Twist "is
not Indonesian culture," lie
warned, "You boys and girls,
if you want to dance the Twist,
you'd better leave tile country."
Soon a tier, lie outlawed the
dance and ordered the arrest of
a student eoinniittec that want
ed to stage a Twist festival.
Madame Nhu, the erstwhile
commentator on Western mor
als, who enforced such a ban in
South Viet Nam before, the
revolution (the lirsf one, that
is), was unavailable for com
ment.
