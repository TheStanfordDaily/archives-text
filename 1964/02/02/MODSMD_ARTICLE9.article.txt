# Dispute May Hold Up SU Linear Accelerator
## Overhead Power Lilies Condemned 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
Hea rings were hold iti Washing
. ton last woek fin a Power line dis
pute which could delay comple
tion of Stanford's Linear Accele
rator (SLACi by nine months
J and increase the cost of the 114
; million dollar project by another
1.6 million dollars.
AT ISSUE was the planned use
I of overhead powerlines to supply
I the project with 300 megawatts
jof power. Local citizens' groups
1 have preferred a more expensive
j underground line carrying 180
' megawatts, an amount of power
i sufficient for only about ten
j years.
According to Robert Moulton,
; assistant director of SLAC. the
commit to decided to give the local
citizens' groups, SLAC. an d
PG&E one more chance to effect
a compromise. "Should t hey fail
110 compromise," said Moulton,
j"t h e federal government will
i probably condemn the necessary
| land to build the overhead lines."
A group called "Save Our Sky
line" has opposed the cheaper
j overhead lines because of their
1 unesthetic appearance. Paul N.
i MeClosky, Jr.. a Palo Alto attor
! ney and spokesman for the group,
i told a joint congressional commit
j tee, "The question is basically one
of neighborliness and cooperation
| between the levels of government
I involved."
THE WOODSIDE and San Ma
! teo Planning Commissions turned
j down a request from PG&E lo
| allow the overhead lines to be
built, forcing the Atomic Energy
j Commission to ask Congress to
j either provide additional money
to pay for the more expensive un
derground lines or to condemn
the necessary property to build
I the overhead lines.
The latest proposal turned down
I by the local planning commissions
I was an attempted compromise.
: Rather than the origin a 11 y
| planned 130 foot, six line towers
' the latest proposal called for 60
( foot poles carrying three lines.
ROBERT LEVY, chairman of
the San Mateo Planning Commis
sion told the eommitte that per
mission to construct the overhead
lines was refused because, "Con
st rue! ion of this line would be
I highly damaging to the scenic
values of the country; that the
creation of the unsightly mass of
| towers, strings of wire and the
scars on the landscape would be
inappropriate to this beautiful
i area and therefore contrary to
, public welfare."
A. R. LUEDECKE, general man
ager of the AEC said that the al
; ternate underground lines would
J cost much more, take longer to
build, have less capacity, and be
impossible to expand without
further construction.
PG&E said underground lines
would cost $2,640,000 for a single
circuit. The highest amount that
PG&E is willing to pay is $1,012,-
1000, for an overhead circuit.
Spokesmen for SLAC added that
additional power will be needed
, by June of 1963 and underground
I power lines would take approxi
j mately two years to construct.
I Two California congressmen,
; diet Holifield and Craig I-losmer
have lold the committee that the
j additional 1.6 million dollars
; would be for local esthetic bene
! fit only and not for the benefit
of the nation's taxpayers.
THE PROPOSED o v erhea d
lines would run from Skyline
, down along Hear Gulch. Two
; routes, one crossing Searsville
Lake and one skirting it to the
north, are proposed for the ac
-1 celeratoi end of the line.
