• Peking ff ill Bury Revisionist
TOKYO — Red China called Soviet Premier
Khrushchev a man with "a feudal psychology"
who befriended Chinese Communists opposed
to Mao Te-Tung's leadership. Peking predicted
Khrushchev and his party leaders "will bo
buried," presumably by the Chinese.
The blistering attack yesterday on Khru
shchev broke a lull in the Moscow-Peking war
of words, which flared last year. It swept
aside Khrushchev's demand for an end to pub
lic polemics between the two Communist
giants.
The Kremlin mouthpiece, the international
theoretical journal Problems of Peace and So
cialism. assailed Peking's demands for world
revolution.
An article by a Greek Communist leader,
Kostas Koliyannis, accused the Chinese of
"proclaiming armed violence as almost the only
form of revolutionary struggle" and predicted
defeat for Peking's 'adventurist tactics."
