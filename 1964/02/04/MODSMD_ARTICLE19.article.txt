# Swimmers Splash Past Santa Clara
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
Stanford's Mermen stayed un
beaten, but a group of child prod
igies in the Santa Clara Swim
Club stayed within striking dis
tance of the Indians all afternoon
Saturday and only a close victory
in the last relay insured victory,
50-45.
Conditions were ideiil for a fine
meet. The weather was warm,
and the grandstands were filled.
Stanford captured six of the
events during the afternoon, but
record-breaking performances all
fell to Santa Clara.
Don Schollander, the best of
George Ilaine's proteges, cracked
the pool record in the 200 free
style with a time of 1:45.2. In the
500 freestyle, he matched his
teammate stroke for stroke and
finished in a deliberate dead heat
while the Stanford swimmers
were still far behind. The second
pool record of Ihe day tumbled
when swim club's Dick Roth
thrashed 200 yards in the individ
ual medley in 2:04.0.
With Coach Bob Gaughran
stacking the early events, Stan
ford built up an early lead, 23-10.
In the medley relay, Dave Gildea,
Marty Hull, Pete Petti grew, and
Bill Ready each swam their spe
cialties to finish with a combined
3:48.8 time and first place.
Hull outdistanced all pursurers
in the 50 yard freestyle in a good
time of :23.2. Stanford was still

in the lead, and it would win
four more events before Ihe end
of the meet.
Swimming Ihe 2(10 butterfly,
Stanford ace I Ilka Suvanto came
home in 2:03.4, plenty good for
first place. The Cards' Freeman,
showing good form in his dives
from the three-meter board, piled
up a total of 210.30 points and
captured top honors in the diving.
Giving Stanford a sweep of the
short freestyle events, Mike
Doscher swam the 100 in :49.9.
The lead that Stanford had built
up slowly evaporated under a hot
sun as the meet progressed.
Finally, with one event: to go,
the onsurging visitors had crept
ahead by two points. The last
race which would prove to be ex
pensive for both clubs in one way
or another was the free relay.
Swimming for the Indians were
Bill Lorton, Mike Doscher, Bill
Ready, and Illka Suvanto. When
anchor man Suvanto took off
from the starting blocks for the
final 100 yards, he had more than
a second lead which the first
three Stanford members of the
relay team had so thoughtfully
imparted to him. His opponent
was none other than Don Schol
lander.
Schollander swam a fantastic
47.1, but his efforts were not
quite enough as Suvanto beat him
to the final wall by inches.
In the freshman meet against
the Santa Clara Swim Club, Stan

ford won handily, 63-31. Standout
performers for the swimming
papooses were Doug Jensen and
Jim Laney, who each landed
themselves a frosh record. Jensen
began his attack on the record
book with a 1:55.2 timing in the
200 freestyle event which gave
him a frosh pool record. Although
he was edged out in the race, he
broke his own frosh record in the
500 freest yle.
