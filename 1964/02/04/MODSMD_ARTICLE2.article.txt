# The 						Great Rat Controversy

### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
Stanford's "rat" controversy
continued to grow yesterday
with the release of a letter by
San Francisco artist Walter
Keane to President J. K. Wallace
Sterling'.
The letter was highly critical
of the action by several S t a n
ford students at a lecture given
here by his wife last Tuesday.
KKANK, a well-known artist,
protested the "rancorous vio
lence" which lie said was aimed
at the "assassination of a wom
an's dignity and character."
Last Tuesday, Mrs. Keane's
talk on the role of women in art
was interrupted several times
hy disturbances in the audience,
culminating in the release of
several rats.
The students responsible said,
in a series of letters to the
Daily, that they were protesting
th e commercialism in th e
Keane's art work. Commented
one student, Janet Cuthbertson,
"Margaret Keane is a joke, No
one is used more often as a bad
example by people who sincerely
respect art. It is because 1 sin
cerely respect art as a medium
of expression, it is because I
feel Margaret Keane's work is
a rude affrontation to fine art,
that I feel justified in some sort
of protestation."
KEANE'S LETTER, however,
brushed off the student action as
a demonstration of "adolescence
and immature minds," and in

stead concentrated on the fac
ulty of the Art Department
which Keane believes instigated
the incident.
Keane wrote, "But it is the pro
fessors of art who penned their
exressions in print, that have
earned my contempt. In my
opinion they are the instigators,
especially when they publicly
supported the actions of the
students involved. They lack
taste, their minds have become
as abstract as their art."
HE ADDED, "It is a pity that

you have a few instructors who
have 'educational degrees' hut
who lack culture. All of us, one
time or another may find dis
favor with cerl a in t lungs
whether they be in an idea or
the works of a person, yet we
should he civilized enough to ex
press our criticism in a man
ner which does not degrade the
individual, or do harm, especi
ally if the idea or the work is
sincere."
This comment was apparently
inspired hy a letter to the Daily
of last Thursday hy Lore n
Eituer, a member of the Art
Department, which was highly
critical of Mrs. Keane's appear
ance at Stanford without men
tioning the disturbances.
PROFESSOR Eitner stated to
the Daily: "Upon my return
from a trip to Philadelphia, I
learned of the incident w hi eh
occurred during Mrs. Keane's
lecture. I also found that a letter
which I had previously sent to
the Daily had subsequently been
published and given the impres
sion to some that it was in some
way related to the incident.
"I very much regret the dis
turbance and the distress which
it has caused to Mrs. Kcaiic and
to her audience. Had I foreseen
these events, I should not have
written the letter, it has no
causal relation to it, and I should
l>e sorry if it caused Mrs. Keane
I'drther annoyanee."
And, until tomorrow, that is
the last word on the subject.
