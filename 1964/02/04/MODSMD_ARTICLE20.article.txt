# Fresno State Wrestlers Hand Indians 24-6 Defeat
## 
### PETE CALLAWAY 
The rough, seasoned, and
speedy mat men from Fresno
Stale proved just 100 much for a
game Stanford squad Saturday,
as they romped to a 24-6 victory
over the Indians at Encina Gym.
The loss dropped Stanford to a
1-2 season record. Fresno State is
3-2.
STARS IN the losing cause for
the Tribe were captain and three
year man Phil Kendall, in tho
167 pound class, who decisioned
Fresno's Joe Rossi 5-0, and Dun
can Ross, in tho unlimited divi
sion. who gained the decision over
John Zintncr.
Zinter had made a somewhat
premature appearance a few min
utes earlier as he stood bewild
ered in mid-ring ready to oppose
the Indian's Don Buehler. Maybe
its fortunate for him that he
didn't. Buehler was obviously
ready for anyone Saturday, as ho
easily pinned his opponent Jim
Unto with a "banana split" at
1:15 in a 191 pound exhibition
match.
But aside from the excellent
grappling of Stanford's two big
mon. and team captain, the action
was mostly for the Fresno Stato
invaders, who recorded two pins.
At; 130 pounds, quick Roy
Stuckey took the measure of In
dian Tim Davis at 6:45 in the
match, and John Oiler proved too
much for Gerry Smith in the 147
pound class, pinning him at 4:50.
BUT ALIj in all. the Cards rep
resontod themselves well in the
matches, extending their Fresno

State opponents to the limit in
most of the matches.
NCAA District 8 123 pound
champion Steve Johanson over
came a fine showing by the In
dian's Dick Anderson, gaining a
6-0 decision over in a good action
filled first match.
Fresno's Juan Harmon squeaked
by Dave Heramichuk. The match
was an exciting and hard-fought
battle throughout, Harmon win
ning by a single point, 1-0. An
other one point nod went to Fres
no State's Erik Christiansen who
edged Joel Kay by a similarly
narrow 3-2 score. At 177 pounds,
Stanford's Tom Allan was shut
out 4-0 by the Stale's Don Nelson.
FRESNO STATE Coach Bill
Kimberley praised the defeated
Stanford team, calling them "a
good game club. You can tell that
i they're well-conditioned, and well
coached. They wrestled well."
Stanford's coach, Bill Leland,
seemed satisfied with his squad's
improvement from week to week,
adding that Fresno State, has a
"good, sound, tough team."
Next action for the Tribe comes
this Saturday when they take on
Cal Poly of Pomona at 2:00 p.m.
in Encina.
