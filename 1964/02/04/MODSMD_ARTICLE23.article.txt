# Action On Religion Needed; Money, Goodwill Present
## 
### 
"Religion is intended as a comfort, a sol
ace, a necessity to the Soul's welfare . . .
Mrs. Stanford once said. And yet more stu
dents leave the campus for religious services
than worship in Memorial Church, and a
special Committee from Legislature finds
"increased dissatisfaction with the place of
religion at Stanford," and the Daily can
write, with apparent truth, "there is no free
dom of worship'' at Stanford.
During the past month, The Daily and a
special LASSU Committee on Religion have

made extensive, even exhaustive, studies of
religion and its role at Stanford. Headlines
in the Daily tell the story:
How can Stanford eliminate religious
restriction? General policy toward religion
has changed little. Precedents exist for Sec
tarian service. (Prof.) Good recommends fa
cilities for all faiths. Forstman questions
sectarianism. More chaplains, one church.
CRA, ministers stress ecumenism, faster
progress.
Mrs. Stanford intended Memorial Church

to be Protestant; yet, the LASSU committee
notes, the spirit was one of revolution and
toleration.
Robert McAfee Brown notes, "An Ameri
can (in Mrs. Stanford's era) was regarded
as a Protestant, and members of other relig
ons were regarded as deviating from the
norm. We are now in a pluralistic culture
with Catholicism, Judaism, and Protestant
ism representing real options for Americans.
This fact should be reflected within the
University community."

Surely there can be no doubt what the
policy of the University must be in regards
to religion. It can be callcd pan-sectarianism,
non-sectarianism, multi-sectarianism, poly
sectarianism, but alternate forms of wor
ship must be available.
It is not ihe task of the Daily to propose
systems, forms or institutions for the imple
mentation of this goal. The Religion Com
mittee of Legislature in its report lias made
the necessary proposals, concrete suggestions
lor increasing personnel and capital expendi
tures, financial and staff improvements.

Money is available and there is good \v ill
on both sides.
Dr. Harry May, Director of the llillel
Foundation and Father John Dnryea of St.
Anns Catholic Church, the men who, head
ing the largest minorities, would be most
involved in any possible religion expansion,
have evidenced a willingness to discuss with
University implementation of the necessary
programs.
President Sterling is reported favorably
impressed by the proposals and suggestions.
All that is needed is action.
