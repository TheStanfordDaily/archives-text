## Topical Books Should Be Published On Different Schedule From Fiction 
### William Rivers 
Associate Professor of Communications
I'or a striking illustration of the perils of publishing topical
books, consider Southeast Asia in United States Policy, the Two
Viet'Nams, and \ ictnam Diary. All, just now published, were
written months ago (the last entry in Vietnam Diary is aMrch 9),
at a time when the Ngo Dinli Diem-Ngo Uhu Vietnamese regime
seemed relatively secure. It was also a time when John F. Ken
nedy commanded our foreign policy, and the authors thought they
could analyze his stance toward Vietnam with some assurance!
that it would be the U.S. stance at least through 1964.
Tli is is not to say the books are obsolete. In fact, one great)
consideration commends all of them. We can resolve some of our:
bewilderment at the overw helming world of the present by read
ing about how it got this way.
Russell 11. Fifield's Southeast Asia in United Slates Policy
(Praeger; 408 pages; $6.50) is by far the most ambitious. In fact,!
it is too ambitious. Mr. Fificld, a former State Department offi
cial who now teaches at the University of Michigan, not only
assesses U.S. policy; he attempts to do more than merely sketch
the frighteningly fragmented reaches of Southeast Asia. From bur-1
ma to the outermost islands of the Philippines and Indonesia, lie
colors in history, politics ,economies, and prospects. He is a hope-1
fill analyst and a dogged stylist.
Bernard B. Fall's The Two Vict-Nams ( Praeger; 49.'3 pages; j
$7.95) is more satisfying, if only because it provides a clear focus
on a single area and demonstrates that its author has a sense of
style to inform his scholarship.
Its true that there are wind-swept, arid stretches through sev
eral of the early chapters of The Two Viet-Nanis; Mr. Fall is too
much the contemporary analyst to be altogether at home with
early history. But when the reader reaches "Ngo Dinh Diemâ€”Man
and Myth," a chapter near the middle, he delights in watching a
painter at work on a fine-line portrait of a subject previously seen
only iu the foggiest way.
FROM THE INTRODUCTION of Diem to the end, this is an
absorbing book. Unfortunately, not knowing what was to happen
to Diem and Vietnam, Mr. Fall concludes that the historical im
portance of the Buddhist crisis, which was gathering force as he
wrote the preface, "should not be exaggerated.' "In the light of:
later events, the conclusion sounds a bit airy.
Richard Tregaskis' Vietnam Diary (Holt, Rinchart and W in
ston; 401 pages; $5.95) attempts less than either of the other books, j
and thus suffers somewhat less from the time lag between writing
and reading. As with the author s famous Guadalcanal Diary, this
is a day-by-day account of the actions of American fighting men.
It barely touches the Diems and the Nhus; American policy is
important only because it is responsible for the presence in Viet
nam of men from Maplehill, Kan., and Saunderstown, R.I.
Like Mr. Tregaskis' first war diary, Vietnam Diary is rich in
the small details that able journalists put together into mosaics ol
drama and significance. And yet, somehow, the mixture is not as |
palatable as before.
So much for the content of these books. As for their timeliness,
or lack of it, there is no easy answer. It must be obvious that I
topical books must be published on a time schedule different from
fiction, scholarship, and poetry. Allowing six months to a year to
elapse between the writing and the reading of current history is
altogether absurd. And as is proved by the publication of the
excellent Scandal, 1963 bare weeks after the Christine Keeler affair
shook the British government, it is possible to produce topical j
books rapidly.
When current history is published with the leisure given to I
Presidential memoirs, or yet another volume of Walden, the pub
lisher is put in the position of chagrin occupied by the barber who
suddently discovers gleaming equipment in his competitors' shops
while he stands holding a mustache cup.
