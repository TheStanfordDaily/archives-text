# Dear Old Timer: Keep America American
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
If you publish everyday a piece
of "literature" like the letter by
a certain Old Timer called R.
W. Madison which appeared in
the Daily last Monday, January
27, I promise I'll give up read
ing the Comics in the CHRON
ICLE: your "Letters to the Edi
tor" will be much more fun to
read.
But, aside from being funny,
Old Timer R. W. Madison seems
to be senile. What does he think
is American society made of?
Didn't he learn in his years at
Stanford that what makes
American great is this mixture
of Irish, English, Spanish, Ital
ian and Chinese blood?
To all those who think like
Old Timer R. W. Madison, we,
typical products of this student
exchange business, propose:
Americans, get on the ball and
keep America American. Gi v e
Florida back to Spain, Louisiana
to France, Alaska to Russia,
California and Texas to Mexico,
Hawaii to those slanted-eyed
Orientals, the Canal Zone to the
Panamanians, Puerto Rico to
those bad smelling Spaniards
and get your ancestors out of
the reservations.

• Student Congress
Editor, The Daily:
The article reporting on the
talk by Bruce Gordon, a Field
Secretary for SNCC, before the
Stanford Student Congress pre
sented an excellent summary of
his views but unfortunately over
looked the real significance of
the meeting.
I refer to the complete perver
sion of the principles for which
the Student Congress was estab
lished. It was intended as a for
um where controversial issues
could bo debated and resolutions
passed after the opportunity had
been given for both sides to be
heard.
Friday's session was a mock
ery of that ideal. Before intro
ducing Mr. Gordon, the C h a i r
man, I believe Dennis Sweeney,
announced that under the Con
gress's rules no funds might be
solicited by the speaker, but
there was no reason why he
could not place a box of SNCC
pins on the table and sell them
for perhaps a dollar or more.

I wish to do is to protest this
blatant and cynical use of what
should be an objective body to
rubber stamp a particular and
highly questionable political be
lief. This is not the mark of an
impartial, democratic congress
worthy of the support of the
students of Stanford. Rather it
is modeled after the "People As
semblies" common to all dic
tatorships and as such is worthy
of only the disgust and con
tempt of all Stanford students.

• Letters To The liilitoi
Editor, The Daily:
I am distrubed with the con
sistently one-sidedness of the
opinions expressed in the letters
to the editor of the daily.
I realize that most differences
between people and groups of
people are resolved by arriving
at a medium between two con
st rasting extremes of opinion.
The alternative to this method
would be a situation in which
each party concerned would try
to devise a compromise even be
fore e s:pressing his preliminary
views....
Unfortunately, this method of
taking an absolutely one-sided
stand causes its user to appear
to have a lack of understanding
in his area of concern. I hope
it is true that the people who ex
press strongly biased views in
this column or anywhere else
have deliberately polarized their
argument in order to make it
more provocative and do not
really think that their views are
adequate for a workable under
standing of the real situation.

• Pickets
Editor, The Daily:
.... The great majority of
people who march in picket lines
or sit at tables passing out liter
ature care deeply, very deeply
about freedom. More than people
who write letters to Congress
men, people who picket (or sit-in
down South, for it is the same
thing) are "working" at Democ
racy. They are attempting to pro
voke thought and to confront
people at the level of personal
witness. Democracy without

thought ancl discussion a m on g
individuals is not democracy.
Mr. |Robert Harlowj Smith
has either never taken part in
protest action or has failed to
understand any "picketing" he
may have done. Protesting by
personal witness is not fun, is
not thrilling, is not rebellious
and certainly not "senseless." A
person who throws himself open
to personal attacks, who gives
up his time and perhaps money,
for protest action is not merely
"working" at democracy. He is
living" his democratic beliefs and
obligations, and whether he pro
tests military forces or segrega
tion or unfair labor policies, he
should be welcomed both by
those who agree with him and
those who disagree. It is not
.just a matter of "The Cause"
it is a matter of the freedom
which Mr. Smith endorses.

• Freedom Of Speech
Editor, The Daily:
To exercise one's freedom of
speech and assembly in order to
witness to the community is not
to reject one's responsibility as
a member of that community.
This action is rather, 1. impli
citly, by the conscientious prac
tice of these freedoms, to affirm
those parts of a free and demo
cratic society which are of en
during worth, and 2. explicitly
to call that community to a
recognition of those institutions
and forces which threaten t he
p e c u 1 i a r I y intangible values
around which that community is
organized, and without which
that community cannot fulfill
its function to its contracted
members.
The informative witness by
the Stanford Peace Caucus
across from the Navy recruiting
van was just such an expression
of personal responsibility. Its
purpose was to bring to each
man an awareness: 1. of the in
ability of a community to pro
tect its fundamental values by
military might; 2. of the per
sonal confrontation which each
man must make with his respon
sibility for renewal within so
ciety and with an individual wit
ness to transcendent loyalties;
and 3. of the alternatives open
to him in the particular area of

• Student Congress
Editor, The Daily:
The article reporting on the
talk by Bruce Gordon, a Field
Secretary for SNCC, before the
Stanford Student Congress pre
sented an excellent summary of
his views but unfortunately over
looked the real significance of
the meeting.
I refer to the complete perver
sion of the principles for which
the Student Congress was estab
lished. It was intended as a for
um where controversial issues
could bo debated and resolutions
passed after the opportunity had
been given for both sides to be
heard.
Friday's session was a mock
ery of that ideal. Before intro
ducing Mr. Gordon, the C h a i r
man, I believe Dennis Sweeney,
announced that under the Con
gress's rules no funds might be
solicited by the speaker, but
there was no reason why he
could not place a box of SNCC
pins on the table and sell them
for perhaps a dollar or more.

I wish to do is to protest this
blatant and cynical use of what
should be an objective body to
rubber stamp a particular and
highly questionable political be
lief. This is not the mark of an
impartial, democratic congress
worthy of the support of the
students of Stanford. Rather it
is modeled after the "People As
semblies" common to all dic
tatorships and as such is worthy
of only the disgust and con

I am distrubed with the con

I realize that most differences
between people and groups of

at a medium between two con

The alternative to this method
would be a situation in which
each party concerned would try
to devise a compromise even be
fore e s:pressing his preliminary

Unfortunately, this method of
taking an absolutely one-sided

it is true that the people who ex

Editor, The Daily:
To exercise one's freedom of

to reject one's responsibility as

This action is rather, 1. impli
citly, by the conscientious prac

those parts of a free and demo

during worth, and 2. explicitly
to call that community to a

that community cannot fulfill
its function to its contracted

purpose was to bring to each

• Student Congress
Editor, The Daily:
The article reporting on the
talk by Bruce Gordon, a Field
Secretary for SNCC, before the
Stanford Student Congress pre
sented an excellent summary of
his views but unfortunately over
looked the real significance of
the meeting.
I refer to the complete perver
sion of the principles for which
the Student Congress was estab
lished. It was intended as a for
um where controversial issues
could bo debated and resolutions
passed after the opportunity had
been given for both sides to be
heard.
Friday's session was a mock
ery of that ideal. Before intro
ducing Mr. Gordon, the C h a i r
man, I believe Dennis Sweeney,
announced that under the Con
gress's rules no funds might be
solicited by the speaker, but
there was no reason why he
could not place a box of SNCC
pins on the table and sell them
for perhaps a dollar or more.

I wish to do is to protest this
blatant and cynical use of what
should be an objective body to
rubber stamp a particular and
highly questionable political be
lief. This is not the mark of an
impartial, democratic congress
worthy of the support of the
students of Stanford. Rather it
is modeled after the "People As
semblies" common to all dic
tatorships and as such is worthy
of only the disgust and con

I am distrubed with the con

I realize that most differences
between people and groups of
people are resolved by arriving
at a medium between two con

The alternative to this method
would be a situation in which
each party concerned would try
to devise a compromise even be
fore e s:pressing his preliminary

Unfortunately, this method of
taking an absolutely one-sided

it is true that the people who ex

.... The great majority of

ature care deeply, very deeply
about freedom. More than people

men, people who picket (or sit-in

Mr. |Robert Harlowj Smith
has either never taken part in

may have done. Protesting by
personal witness is not fun, is
not thrilling, is not rebellious
and certainly not "senseless." A
person who throws himself open
to personal attacks, who gives
up his time and perhaps money,
for protest action is not merely
"working" at democracy. He is

Editor, The Daily:
To exercise one's freedom of
speech and assembly in order to
witness to the community is not
to reject one's responsibility as
a member of that community.
This action is rather, 1. impli
citly, by the conscientious prac
tice of these freedoms, to affirm
those parts of a free and demo
cratic society which are of en
during worth, and 2. explicitly
to call that community to a
recognition of those institutions
and forces which threaten t he
p e c u 1 i a r I y intangible values
around which that community is
organized, and without which
that community cannot fulfill
its function to its contracted
members.
The informative witness by
the Stanford Peace Caucus
across from the Navy recruiting
van was just such an expression
of personal responsibility. Its
purpose was to bring to each
man an awareness: 1. of the in
ability of a community to pro

military might; 2. of the per
