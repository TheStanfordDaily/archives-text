## LASSU: Light Entertainment With Weak Supporting Cast 
### Justin Beck 
"Gaities,' Stanford's annual musical comedy, manages to fill
Mem And for most of its shows. LASSU, another form of light
campus entertainment, can't even draw its own membership to
its bi-weekly performances.
"LASSU is a farce, commented a member of the student legis
lature. but lie talked about the farce without even smiling. Per
haps the Immor ol an incompetent student government is begin
ing to wear a little thin even on the actors responsible.
Not that the stars of the show are too bad; its just that the
supporting east is a little weak. They float in on Thursday nights
like phantoms, sit very quietly, and then float out again when the
meeting is over. Thev are visible, but one wonders if they are
really there.
Last week's episode in the student government drama is typical
of a LASSU meeting. Brad Efron, Ed Shaw, and Bud Wedin got
the advance billings, and, as usual, carried the show.
Efron is the legislatures speaker, a task comparable to being
a highway patrolman in a parking lot. The task of conducting
LASSU meetings is very easy because generally nobody has any
thing to say.
Shaw can talk for long periods of time on ASSU's piggv bank;
and when he is finished, one is left with the impression that there
is a great deal to be learned about accounting. Aside from that,
all one really learns is that Shaw is sitting on more than one piggy
bank and that being student financial manager is a very tricky
business.
AND THEN THERE IS Bud Wedin, the president of the whole
show. lie is the expert on LASS Us business, large and small, and
as such he does fine work. The only problem is that he is the only
expert LASSU has, and it gets a little tedious listening to Wedin
explain all the legislation, except financial matters, that comes
before LASSU. Student government would be wise in acquiring
another expert to help their president out.
But it is the lack of support that really hurts. Where were
the student representatives when all the religious discontent was
building up among their constituents? They weren't at LASSU
meetings since only half attend, and apparently they weren't check
ing student discontent, since it took a couple of months before
LASSU finally acted. One can feel that the typical LASSU rep
resentative is so thick skulled that he has to be hit by lightning
before he realizes that it's raining outside.
But apparently the leaders, like Wedin, are aware of the prob
lem of student representatives that represent nothing but apathy.
They are making an effort to inform LASSU members and stu
dents of the issues coming before LASSU. A by-law proposed
last week proposes that the President have the important issues,
if there are any, be printed in the Daily prior to LASSU meetings.
When LASSU was increased from 20 to about 120 members last
year, it was hoped that the increased membership would make
that body more representative of the student body. But it hasn't
What has resulted is the same small body of doers, and a vastly
increased number of sitters.
What is needed—more than the small proposals brought be
fore LASSU last week—is a change in membership in the Legis
lature. The object would not be to turn LASSU into a room
full of Wedins, for that would turn apathy into chaos, but to pro
vide students with representatives that really care about student
government, and about the students that chose them as repre
sentatives.
Should LASSU fail in this they might as well hire a band and
and call their show a musical eomedv. /
