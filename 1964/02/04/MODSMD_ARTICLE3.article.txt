# Cornell IFC Votes Bias Ban
## 
### 
The Interfraternity Council of
Cornell University voted recently
to revise part of its by-laws to
make certain that specific mea
sures will be taken in the event
of discrimination by a house in
membership selection.
The added clause which deals
with categorical discrimination
both national and local levels fol
lows one already adopted which
prohibits any voting procedure by
a house in pledge selection which
fosters in the house "consistent
discrimination by virtue of race,
religion, or national origin."
If a discriminating action is
brought to the attention of the
IFC, the house will be required
to consult with the IFC Commit
tee on Discrimination in order to
refine or change the house's vot
ing procedure to remove the vot
ing discrimination. If the house
cannot bring about such a change
on the local level because of re
strictions imposed by the national
fraternity organization, "the
house shall actively move to ef
fect the removal of the restric
tions."
