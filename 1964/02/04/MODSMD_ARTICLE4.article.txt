# Forstman Develops Existential Theory Of Martin Heidegger
## 
### NORM GREENBERG 
"Life as man knows it is being
thrown into dasein (being there,
in the world)," said Martin Heid
egger years ago. Man ean only
describe and analyze dasein. He
can know no more. He cannot
objectively know God.
Upon this premise, Professor
Forstman developed a statement
of the possibilities for Christian
thought from an historical anal
ysis of theology, 1o give contem
porary man an understanding of
himself which shall be conducive
to faith.
Bultmann's theology, being di
rected towards the meaning un
derlying the words of the New
Testament, meshes into Heideg
ger's philosophy.
THE METHOD and content of
I Protestant theology is determined
by man's "being there.'' Bultmann
instituted a demythicizing of the
Bible; upon the recognition that
the writers, confined to dasein,
cannot toll its about the objects
God and Christ; we learn instead
the self-understanding of these
men who believed in God's grace
and the redemption of Christ.
Thus, the Bible is studied anthro
pologically. assuming value for
the critically intellectual under
standing of modern man.
Karl Barth. who repudiates the
self-assert iveness of modern man
as irreconcilable to the religious
spirit, founds his theology upon
Iho discovery of what he terms
I the "strange new world of the
Bible."

"Life as man knows it is being
thrown into dasein (being there,
in the world)," said Martin Heid
egger years ago. Man ean only
describe and analyze dasein. He
can know no more. He cannot
objectively know God.
Upon this premise, Professor
Forstman developed a statement
of the possibilities for Christian
thought from an historical anal

himself which shall be conducive
to faith.
Bultmann's theology, being di
