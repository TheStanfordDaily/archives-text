# 'Coup' Hits Stanford; Party Stresses Issues
## University Party Open To Students 
### HOPE SELBY 
The University Party, Stan
lord's first student political party,
was formally announced yester
day as a student political organiz
ation working to elect student
government officers on the basis
ofi issues concerning the entire
student body. Membership in the
party will be open to all students.
The party was first conceived
last November by Paul Holdorf, a
sophomore majoring in Political
Science, and Thomas Mosher, a
junior also majoring in Political
Science. They said they felt a stu
dent political party would provide
a meaningful alternative to the
status quo in student government
by working for student body elec
tions based on issues expressed
in party platforms rather than
on the living group affiliation of
candidates.
.YIOSHEK AM) HOLDORF de
scribed the party's orientation as
"activist," but stated that it will
be "neither reactionary nor con
servative, neither radical nor lib
oral. We approach problems in
terms of individual issues, not as
part of a total political ideology."
The party was formally organ
ized last December with the for
mation of the Council of the Uni
versity Party, known as "COUP."
Members of the council are, in
addition to Hooldorf and Mosher,
Hugh Smith, a senior philosophy
major who is a sponsor in Wil
bur; Tom Dunigan, a senior po
litical science major; Rick Seifert.,
a senior History and Journalism
major who is also a sponsor in
Wilbur; Paul Rupert, a freshman
who is president of Madera house
in Wilbur; and Jim Binns, also
a freshman. In the future the
council of Ihe party will be chos
en at a convention of all party
members to be held fall quarter.
THE PARTY was officially an
nounced after talks with Dean of
Students Donald 11. Winbigler,
Dean of Freshmen Men Dwight
Clark, other university officials,
and top student leaders. Council
members also investigated the
history of similar student politic
al parties at other universities,
and reported that "around a hun
dred other institutions" had suc
cessful student political parties.
The party has been registered
with Political Union.
"COUP" will emphasize issues
of student concern as the basis
for partisan student politics
which, the council feels, will
make more students concerned
about student government. The
party plans to draw up a platform
expressing ils stand on student
issues such as legislature's right
to speak on "off campus" issues,
the role of student committees in
determining university policy, Ihe
religion question, and other issues
such as housing and social reg
ulations.
1 Holdorf said that it is still un

certain whether the party w i 11J
support specific candidates for
the ASSU elections this spring.
This will depend, he said, on the
party's membership and organiz
ational strength at that time. But
at least having a platform to dis
cuss will promote issue oriented
campaigns which will define the
role of elected officials in a way
that personality or living group
"bloc" campaigns cannot.
A BOOKLET entitled "Our Re
sponsibility: Apathy or Participa
tion" describing the nature of the
party and its objectives has been
prepared for distribution to living
groups this week. It cites the
three disadvantages of non-parti
san student government as "lack
of responsibility, apathy, and im
portance." and diagnoses the
problems inherent in these dis
advantages.
"Since officers are not elected
on the issues," the pamphlet
states, "they have no political
goals, no mandate from their con
stituents . . . They have no right
to speak for their electors on any
'on' or 'off campus issues, for
they are not truly representative.
If LASSU and ASSU candidates
were elected on the issues they
would not only have the right or
mandate of the students for
change, but they would also have
the responsibility to achieve the
aims outlined in their party's
platform."
Holdorf also stressed that the
party would provide the advan
tages of continuity in working
for student reforms, since the or
ganization would continue after
individual students had grad
uated.
MOSHEK STJiESSEI) (lie need
for Stanford students to "proceed
with responsibility and informed
minds to promote action, open dis
cussions. and forums for a strong
student government. The image
of the Stanford student as an un
committed. non-partisan, a polit
ical being has persevered," he
said, "because student govern
ment has utilized formal political
organization."
The council supported the idea
of the formation of a party in
opposition to the university party,
a>4 has been done at other univer
sities. An opposition party, they
said, would stimulate controversy
and promote the responsibility of
the student officers in power.
Signups for membership in the
party will be from 1-6 p.m. during
the next two weeks in the ASSU
office. Members are needed to
staff the party's executive depart
ments and to do work ill this
spring's campaign.

scribed the party's orientation as
"activist," but stated that it will
be "neither reactionary nor con
servative, neither radical nor lib
oral. We approach problems in
terms of individual issues, not as
part of a total political ideology."
The party was formally organ
ized last December with the for
mation of the Council of the Uni
versity Party, known as "COUP."
Members of the council are, in
addition to Hooldorf and Mosher,
Hugh Smith, a senior philosophy
major who is a sponsor in Wil
bur; Tom Dunigan, a senior po
litical science major; Rick Seifert.,
a senior History and Journalism
major who is also a sponsor in
Wilbur; Paul Rupert, a freshman
who is president of Madera house
in Wilbur; and Jim Binns, also
a freshman. In the future the
council of Ihe party will be chos

members to be held fall quarter.
THE PARTY was officially an
nounced after talks with Dean of
Students Donald 11. Winbigler,
Dean of Freshmen Men Dwight
Clark, other university officials,
and top student leaders. Council
members also investigated the
history of similar student politic
al parties at other universities,
and reported that "around a hun
dred other institutions" had suc
cessful student political parties.
The party has been registered
with Political Union.
"COUP" will emphasize issues
of student concern as the basis
for partisan student politics
which, the council feels, will
make more students concerned
about student government. The
party plans to draw up a platform
expressing ils stand on student
issues such as legislature's right
to speak on "off campus" issues,
the role of student committees in
determining university policy, Ihe
religion question, and other issues
such as housing and social reg
ulations.
1 Holdorf said that it is still un

certain whether the party w i 11J
support specific candidates for
the ASSU elections this spring.
This will depend, he said, on the
party's membership and organiz
ational strength at that time. But
at least having a platform to dis
cuss will promote issue oriented
campaigns which will define the
role of elected officials in a way
that personality or living group
"bloc" campaigns cannot.
A BOOKLET entitled "Our Re
sponsibility: Apathy or Participa
tion" describing the nature of the
party and its objectives has been
prepared for distribution to living
groups this week. It cites the
three disadvantages of non-parti
san student government as "lack
of responsibility, apathy, and im
portance." and diagnoses the
problems inherent in these dis
advantages.
"Since officers are not elected
on the issues," the pamphlet
states, "they have no political
goals, no mandate from their con
stituents . . . They have no right
to speak for their electors on any
'on' or 'off campus issues, for
they are not truly representative.
If LASSU and ASSU candidates
were elected on the issues they
would not only have the right or
mandate of the students for
change, but they would also have
the responsibility to achieve the
aims outlined in their party's

party would provide the advan

for student reforms, since the or

individual students had grad

terms of individual issues, not as
part of a total political ideology."
The party was formally organ
ized last December with the for
mation of the Council of the Uni
versity Party, known as "COUP."
Members of the council are, in
addition to Hooldorf and Mosher,
Hugh Smith, a senior philosophy
major who is a sponsor in Wil
bur; Tom Dunigan, a senior po
litical science major; Rick Seifert.,
a senior History and Journalism
major who is also a sponsor in
Wilbur; Paul Rupert, a freshman
who is president of Madera house
in Wilbur; and Jim Binns, also
a freshman. In the future the
council of Ihe party will be chos
en at a convention of all party
members to be held fall quarter.
THE PARTY was officially an
nounced after talks with Dean of
Students Donald 11. Winbigler,
Dean of Freshmen Men Dwight
Clark, other university officials,
and top student leaders. Council
members also investigated the
history of similar student politic
al parties at other universities,
and reported that "around a hun
dred other institutions" had suc
cessful student political parties.
The party has been registered
with Political Union.
"COUP" will emphasize issues
of student concern as the basis
for partisan student politics
which, the council feels, will
make more students concerned
about student government. The
party plans to draw up a platform
expressing ils stand on student
issues such as legislature's right
to speak on "off campus" issues,
the role of student committees in
determining university policy, Ihe
religion question, and other issues
such as housing and social reg
ulations.
1 Holdorf said that it is still un

certain whether the party w i 11J
support specific candidates for
the ASSU elections this spring.
This will depend, he said, on the
party's membership and organiz
ational strength at that time. But
at least having a platform to dis
cuss will promote issue oriented
campaigns which will define the
role of elected officials in a way
that personality or living group
"bloc" campaigns cannot.
A BOOKLET entitled "Our Re
sponsibility: Apathy or Participa
tion" describing the nature of the
party and its objectives has been
prepared for distribution to living
groups this week. It cites the
three disadvantages of non-parti
san student government as "lack
of responsibility, apathy, and im
portance." and diagnoses the
problems inherent in these dis
advantages.
"Since officers are not elected
on the issues," the pamphlet
states, "they have no political
goals, no mandate from their con
stituents . . . They have no right
to speak for their electors on any
'on' or 'off campus issues, for
they are not truly representative.
If LASSU and ASSU candidates
were elected on the issues they
would not only have the right or
mandate of the students for
change, but they would also have
the responsibility to achieve the
aims outlined in their party's
platform."
Holdorf also stressed that the
party would provide the advan
tages of continuity in working
for student reforms, since the or
ganization would continue after
individual students had grad
uated.

for Stanford students to "proceed
with responsibility and informed
minds to promote action, open dis

student government. The image
of the Stanford student as an un

said, "because student govern
ment has utilized formal political
organization."

of the formation of a party in
opposition to the university party,

said, would stimulate controversy
and promote the responsibility of
the student officers in power.
Signups for membership in the
party will be from 1-6 p.m. during
the next two weeks in the ASSU
office. Members are needed to
staff the party's executive depart

spring's campaign.

ship drive of the proposed Council of University Party (COUP).
The University Party, Stan
lord's first student political party,
was formally announced yester
day as a student political organiz
ation working to elect student
government officers on the basis
ofi issues concerning the entire
student body. Membership in the
party will be open to all students.
The party was first conceived
last November by Paul Holdorf, a
sophomore majoring in Political
Science, and Thomas Mosher, a
junior also majoring in Political
Science. They said they felt a stu
dent political party would provide
a meaningful alternative to the
status quo in student government
by working for student body elec
tions based on issues expressed
in party platforms rather than
on the living group affiliation of
candidates.
