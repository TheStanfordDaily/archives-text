Is it necessary to know the mysterious workings of the Mind of
God in order to enjoy His richest blessings? Definitely not! One does
not need to know the complex workings of the human body in order
to enjoy perfect health. And how simple is the human body compared
to the marvels and splendor of God's Kingdom!
It is popular today to build electronic kits. No training and special
skills are needed. A man can know nothing about electronics or circuit
theory, and yet can assemble a fine hifi set or electric organ by carefully
following the simple step by step instructions. When the hisl step is
complete, the kit-man himself may be the most amazed of all at what
has neen accomplished.
The Bible is a Book of Instructions which, if followed, leads to a
finished product—a person transformed eventually into the image of
Ghrist. Faith is acting upon the instructions which God has given us
and which God guarantees will work. Must we understand each step?
No, we are to apply and put into action on faith what God has de
clared. To merely talk about the Instruction Book or discuss its rele
vance will hardly get the hifi built.
The man who follows the directions left by Tesus Christ will reap
rewards far beyond his greatest expectations. All that is really neces
sary is to place oneself under the Master's guidance, humbly and will
ingly.
"I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the
Father but by me." John 14:0.
"I am come a light into the world, that whosoever belicvcth on me
should not abide in darkness." John 12:46.
If you are not familiar with the Instruction Book of Life, we would

wonderful place to begin.
