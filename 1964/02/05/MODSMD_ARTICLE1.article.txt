• Rights Rill Clears Hurdle
WASHINGTON — House supporters of
the civil rights bill handily defeated the first
assault on the key public accommodations
section yesterday.

Southern-led drive to restrict to interstate

travelers the ban on racial discrimination by
hotels and motels.

proposed by Rep. Edwin E. Willis, D-La.

tween the two opposing groups was shown in
a confrontation between Reps. Bruce Alger,

• College Tax Relief Rejected
WASHINGTON — The Senate, with a 4845
roll-call vote, turned down an effort yester
day to grant special income tax deductions to
parents whose children are in college.
The Johnson administration scored a major
victory in mustering sufficient forces to keep
the controversial provision from being writ

ten into the $11.6-billion tax-cut bill.
After defeating that proposal by Sen. Ab
raham A. Ribicoff, D-Conn., the Senate also
rejected with a 47-47 tie vote a proposal by
Sen. Winston L. Prouty. R-Vt.. to allow tax
deductions for working students.
Democratic leaders said the college tax
credit would cost so much it would require
Congress to cut back the individual tax rate
reductions now in the bill—which the Senate
is not expected to change.
