# General Studies Announces Eastern Civilization Course
## Foreign Campuses May Be Expanded 
### 
A two-quarter course in East
Asia Civilization is now under
preparation and will be offered
as a general education course for
3964-65, according to a recentl\
issued report by the Committee
on General Studies.
The new course offering is the
result of inquiries made by the
Committee in early 1963 into the
possibilities for developing a gen
eral education course in Non-
Western Civilization.
THE REPORT which includes
major items considered by the
Committee during 1 lie Academic-
Years 1961-62, 1962-63. and Au
tumn Quarter of 1963-64, states
that the Committee is currently
investigating the possibility of an
optional "end-year comprehensive
examination covering materials
included in certain two- and three
quarter sequence courses in the
General Studies program. Stu
dents passing the exam would
fulfill the requirement and per
haps receive equivalent unit cred
it without taking the course."
The Committee has investigated
several possibilities for expansion
of the overseas program, and has
expressed 'enthusiastic endorse
ment' of a fourth undergraduate
campus."
THE COMMITTEE has also
taken various steps to eliminate
scheduling problems faced by en
gineering. science, and pre-med
ical students who attend the over
seas campuses.
The Senior Colloquia program
has been reviewed by the Com
mittee several times in the last
few years and on each occasion
the program's worth and impor
tance has been re-affirmed. The
Committee has worked to in
crease the number and quality of
Senior Colloquia, "encouraging
departments to view the program
as an integral part of their reg
ular undergraduate teaching re
sponsibility."
"IN RECOGNITION of the
problem which may result from
the anticipated removal of geo
graphy from the list of courses
available to satisfy the Social Sci
ence area requirements, the Com
mittee investigated several alter
nate possibilities. These discus
sions produced several proposals
for inter-departmental approaches
to geography, together with a
for a comprehensive review of all
course offerings in t he Social Sci
ence area.
In the interim, the Committee
granted a one-year approval for
the 'Communications and Society'
course to be included in the So
cial Science listings for 1964-65.
"The Committee recommended
the development of co-educational
housing at Stanford, but later pol
icy discussions have suspended

the development of co-educational
housing at Stanford, but later pol

action on this subject."
A two-quarter course in East
Asia Civilization is now under
preparation and will be offered
as a general education course for
3964-65, according to a recentl\
issued report by the Committee
on General Studies.
The new course offering is the
result of inquiries made by the
Committee in early 1963 into the
possibilities for developing a gen
eral education course in Non-
Western Civilization.
THE REPORT which includes
major items considered by the
Committee during 1 lie Academic-
Years 1961-62, 1962-63. and Au
tumn Quarter of 1963-64, states
that the Committee is currently
investigating the possibility of an
optional "end-year comprehensive
examination covering materials
included in certain two- and three
quarter sequence courses in the
General Studies program. Stu
dents passing the exam would
fulfill the requirement and per
haps receive equivalent unit cred
it without taking the course."
The Committee has investigated
several possibilities for expansion
of the overseas program, and has
expressed 'enthusiastic endorse
ment' of a fourth undergraduate
campus."
THE COMMITTEE has also
taken various steps to eliminate
scheduling problems faced by en
gineering. science, and pre-med
ical students who attend the over
seas campuses.
The Senior Colloquia program
has been reviewed by the Com
mittee several times in the last
few years and on each occasion
the program's worth and impor
tance has been re-affirmed. The
Committee has worked to in
crease the number and quality of
Senior Colloquia, "encouraging
departments to view the program
as an integral part of their reg
ular undergraduate teaching re
sponsibility."
"IN RECOGNITION of the
problem which may result from
the anticipated removal of geo
graphy from the list of courses
available to satisfy the Social Sci
ence area requirements, the Com
mittee investigated several alter
nate possibilities. These discus
sions produced several proposals
for inter-departmental approaches
to geography, together with a
for a comprehensive review of all
course offerings in t he Social Sci
ence area.
In the interim, the Committee
granted a one-year approval for
the 'Communications and Society'
course to be included in the So
cial Science listings for 1964-65.
