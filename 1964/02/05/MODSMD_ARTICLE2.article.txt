# House Full Of Memories
## 
### HILDA KOSSOFF 
The tall old house is hound
round with seventy years of
memories, and Minna Still
man knows them all.
In l(S!)'i, when it was built,
she was here — the young
daughter of one of Stanford's
first professors. In 190(>, tin*
year of the earthquake, she
scrambled down the steep,
plaster-strewn stairs to the
safety of the wide yard.
She has lived here sine e,
among jewel-like Japanese
prints and ivory statues, the
treasurers of her father's col
lection that line every shelf
and table.
Over the years she has be
come rather like a statue her
self — tiny, erect, carved of
old, mottled ivory by some ex
pressive craftsman. She sits
rigid, her long hands locked
motionless in her lap, calling
up the early days of Stanford
in a clear, proud voice.
"Out there," she smiled,
waving at the Stern parking
lot, "that was a field of wheat
—no, wild oats it was —all
silvery and shining when the
wind blew. . . ."
In IJXS4. she must find an
other home — the old white
building at the corner of Al
varado is to l>e torn down to
make room for the new li
brary.
However reluctant. Miss
Stillman is resigned to leav
ing the house. "Which of all
these things to take, that 's the
problem. What to do with
Grandfather now?" She
waved toward a large portrait
of a pleasant old man w i th
long sideburns.
And besides Grandfather
there seemingly are hundreds
of other precious tilings — a

dark bronze samurai out
hawking on a prancing hoi-se
—a graceful enameled vase —
two gleaming little iron ele
phants, trunk to tail — an
ancient upright piano, its ma
hogany panels carved in deep
relief.
On the diningroom wall is
a huge picture of a soulful
dog. "No, he wasn't one of
ours. That's just Dog. I can't
ever remember a diningroom
without Dog — even back
east." Miss Stillman's sister
will take Dog now.
A white porcelain falcon,
almost Ii 112 e size, mantles
fiercely on the table in the
diningroom. She is one of the
pieces with a sure place in
Miss Stillman's new home.
"I'm devoted to my falcon,"
she smiled fondly.

.Miss Still man has not been
alone in the old house, even
since her father's death.
A girl graduate student
lives with her to help on t
and keep her company, so she
has always had someone to
talk with.
"I don't want to leave < li e
campus. 1 very much hate to
leave," .Miss Stillman mused,
gazing around the softly lit,
cream-eolored walls. She is
not yet sure where she will
go. It. is difficult to find an
apartment that will suit the
stately furniture her parents
brought, with them from Bos
ton. The sleek curves of dark
wood, the figured faded cush
ions, the Oriental rugs —none
of these will fit in a modern
room.
ltut still more than the
building;, the life of the Uni
versity will be hard to leave.
All Miss Stillman's years
have been wrapper up in it.
Daughter of the head of the
Chemistry Department, she
a student here and then for
her whole adult life worked
in the Stanford Library.
When she retired recently,
she was in charge of the Gov
ernment Documents Division.
She still works three morn
ings a week at simple filing,
"Just to keep me busy."
Miss Stillman faces her
world with a sureness found
ed in deep self respect, plan
ning clear-eyed for what is
left of her future. "I always
have plans," she snaps, "But
they're not sure yet so I'm
not talking about them."
Whether she finds another
house or au apartment, 011
campus or off, she will con
tinue to live calmly, sur
rounded by her long memo
ries.
