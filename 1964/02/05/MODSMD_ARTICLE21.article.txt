# Mermen Host Relay Meet With Cal, Foothill Today
## 
### PETE CALLAWAY 
In the third Annual Stanford
Relays this Wednesday, the 53
Stanford mermen, undefealerl on
the season, come to grips with
ihe University of California, and
a tough Foothill College squad,
junior colloge champion
Foothill, loaded with talent, ap
pears lo be the overall favorite to
win the Relay competition. Their
top swimmers are Gary Ilman,
l' ree si y 1 e and butterfly; Ken
Webb, a crack swimmer in all
events; Clary Langardin, butter
fly; and Bob Plate, butterfly.
STANFORD WILL match Foot
hill's strength with five All-Amer
icans. They are Marty llull,
NCAA 200-yard breast stroke
champ, Mike Dosher, freestyle,
Dave Gildea, breaststroke, Pete
Reitigrew, backstroke, and llkka
Suvanto, freestyle. Incidentally,
Suvanto will swim for Finland in
ihe 1964 Olympics.
Stanford has a good 400-yard
medley relay team, which finished
sixth in the NCAA, gaining All-
America recognition for its mem
bers in 19(>3.

The 100-yard freestyle relay
team swam fast enough to have
won the 7Ht>2 NCAA title easily,
but still they couldn't make the
top ten last year, the competition
had improved so much.
AIM' SNYDKK and Rill Ready,
two junior college transfers, have
added depth to the Stanford
squad, and should be of help in
the shorter freestyle events.
Strong Stanford frosh swim
mers are Doug Jensen and .Jim
Laney, both freshman record
holders.
The California team seems to
be outclassed except for 1 .1 oh n
Gage, who was a finalist in the
NCAA 100-yard breaststroke.
TIIK CAL frosh lost some of
their strength when Gage's young
er brother suffered an injury and
had to drop out of competition.
Looking ahead, Stanford meets
the mighty Southern California
squad, NCAA champions, to
whom the Indians lost by a mere
two points in a dual meet last
season, next week, after a dual
meet with Cal this Saturday.
Stanford should be much strong
er for this year's meet. Unfortu
ately for ihe RiÂ£ Red. the
Southern California boys will be
much improved also.
The Trojans will have four
swimmers off their frosh team,
who, competing as a unit in the
AAU swimming meet last year,
finished second, defeating their
big brothers, the Trojan varsity.
The AAYVU title will be in great
jeopardy wh en Stanford and
Southern California tangle on
February 11th.
