## 
### 
(AP> The UCLA Bruins, the na
tion's only unbeaten major college
basketball team, and the Michigan
Wolverines survived a shake-up
and held onto the first two posi
tions in The Associated Press
weekly poll.
However, Michigan, which drew
five votes for the No. 1 spot, may
drop a peg or two as a result of
its 86-85 setback by Ohio State
Monday night. All the votes in
this tabulation were cast Monday
afternoon.
In the most recent balloting by
-19 writers and broadcasters,
UCLA collected 13 votes for first
place and 484 points.
