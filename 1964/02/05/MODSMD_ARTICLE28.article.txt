## 'States' Rights' Impossible 
### PELL FENDER 
While Conservative Barry Gold
water relaxes and calls for a
"states rights" solution to Amer
ica's racial fester, students in the
South are carrying on a revolu
tion no less radical and dramatic
than the French or the Russian
Revolutions. Like only one social
revolution in the past, this is a
non-violent revolution.
Young Negroes and whites are
proving what a majority of Amcr-

ican citi z en s
either cannot, or
do not want to
see: that non-vio
lence is not only;
the best way
to gel along in
this world, but
also tiie only
way. Wars in the i

past have gained little and lost
much. They have produced na
tionalistic material gains at the
sacrifice of life.
THIS MAY be America's great
est fault: that we will sacrifice
our lives for the sake of tangible
objects. Can we truly say that we
have sacrificed lives for ideals?
No. because America hardly lives
up to its ideals in times of peace.
America fights inevitable social
ism because the connotation of
socialism is Communism. A "true"
American cannot .without hypoc
risy. sing the National Anthem, if
he believes that America is "the
land of the free."
War, then, is outmoded. It will
no longer reap even material
gains, but, instead, a crisp col
lection of indefinable matter. The
lesson taught us by those fighting
segregation in the North and in
the South is overt, and must be
appreciated.

The Republican Convention, to
be held in July in San Francisco,
will not see the nomination of
Senator Barry Goldwater. His
nomination could be the greatest
mistake the Republicans have
made since former President Ei
senhower planned for the invasion
of Cuba. Goldwater's support is
vocal, but hardly unanimous in
the nation.
The Republicans now have a
fair chance of winning the nation;
if Goldwater is nominated these
chances are defunct. Even if the
presidency changes the man,
rather than the man changing
the presidency, Goldwater's inten
tion to leave the segregation prob
lem to the states is both absurd
and dangerous.
Some states have already aimed
legislation at the solution of this
problem (e.g., the Rumford Hous
ing Bill). Those states that haven't
taken these steps, most likely
won't. The solution to this prob
lem will come only with the uni
fied efforts of citizens through
city, state, and federal laws.

Tin; DEATH ol' John Ken
nedy taught us. among myriad
other thoughts, that "politics" is
essentially compromise. The cat
and mouse game of the Federal
Government versus the South,
however, cannot be thought of as
resulting in a compromise. While
we as citizens fail to live up to
our ideals, the purpose and value
of ideals do not cease to be im
portant, or gadflies to our con
sciences. If the United States is
to gain respect abroad we must
solve our own problems.
It is impossible to be fighting so
many wars, against communism,
illiteracy, disease, and social
wrong, and to expect a satisfac
tory victory over each. The United
States attempts to carry the ana
chronistic "white man's burden"
and the burden is overpowering.
Yet we cannot stop fighting. The
fight need not be violent; t h c
world will lie a better environment
when man learns that the fight
can no longer be negative, but
must be positive.
This column, then, is a call to
ideals. If we cannot live up to
our ideals, we can strive. Through
our striving will evolve personal
satisfaction that man can still
know right from wrong in the con
text of the world.

senhower planned for the invasion
of Cuba. Goldwater's support is
vocal, but hardly unanimous in
the nation.
The Republicans now have a
fair chance of winning the nation;
if Goldwater is nominated these
chances are defunct. Even if the
presidency changes the man,
rather than the man changing
the presidency, Goldwater's inten
tion to leave the segregation prob
lem to the states is both absurd
and dangerous.
Some states have already aimed
legislation at the solution of this
problem (e.g., the Rumford Hous
ing Bill). Those states that haven't
taken these steps, most likely
won't. The solution to this prob
lem will come only with the uni

Tin; DEATH ol' John Ken
nedy taught us. among myriad
other thoughts, that "politics" is
essentially compromise. The cat
and mouse game of the Federal
Government versus the South,
however, cannot be thought of as
resulting in a compromise. While
we as citizens fail to live up to
our ideals, the purpose and value
of ideals do not cease to be im
portant, or gadflies to our con
sciences. If the United States is
to gain respect abroad we must
solve our own problems.
It is impossible to be fighting so
many wars, against communism,
illiteracy, disease, and social
wrong, and to expect a satisfac
tory victory over each. The United
States attempts to carry the ana
chronistic "white man's burden"
and the burden is overpowering.
Yet we cannot stop fighting. The
fight need not be violent; t h c
world will lie a better environment
when man learns that the fight
can no longer be negative, but
must be positive.
This column, then, is a call to
ideals. If we cannot live up to
our ideals, we can strive. Through
our striving will evolve personal
satisfaction that man can still
know right from wrong in the con
text of the world.

While Conservative Barry Gold
water relaxes and calls for a
"states rights" solution to Amer
ica's racial fester, students in the
South are carrying on a revolu
tion no less radical and dramatic
than the French or the Russian
Revolutions. Like only one social
revolution in the past, this is a
non-violent revolution.
Young Negroes and whites are
proving what a majority of Amcr-

ican citi z en s
either cannot, or
do not want to
see: that non-vio
lence is not only;
the best way
to gel along in
this world, but
also tiie only
way. Wars in the i

past have gained little and lost
much. They have produced na
tionalistic material gains at the
sacrifice of life.
THIS MAY be America's great
est fault: that we will sacrifice
our lives for the sake of tangible
objects. Can we truly say that we
have sacrificed lives for ideals?
No. because America hardly lives
up to its ideals in times of peace.
America fights inevitable social
ism because the connotation of
socialism is Communism. A "true"
American cannot .without hypoc
risy. sing the National Anthem, if
he believes that America is "the
land of the free."
War, then, is outmoded. It will
no longer reap even material
gains, but, instead, a crisp col
lection of indefinable matter. The
lesson taught us by those fighting
segregation in the North and in
the South is overt, and must be
