## Religion Series Complimented For Bringing Immediate Gains 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to express my apprecia
tion of the stimulating work of
| reporting done by the Stanford
Daily about the religious situation
here.
I see three immediate benefits:
in increasing awareness in the
whole community, of the signifi
cance of religion as an issue in
life; a realization of the growth
and success of inter-faith collabo
ration already existing in the cam
pus; and a manifestation of the
value of freedom, both of religion
and of the press.
In the long run, I do hope to
see on-campus office space 112 or
denomination ministers to see
counselees, and also worship con
ducted according to the customs
and convictions of various faiths.
Over the years the lack of these
things has worked a hardship on
all. Although many barriers have
been removed in recent years, the
one of geography still remains.
I sympathize with the adminis
strative problems involved in mak
ing these changes, and I want to
express my regard for Mr. Minto
and Mr. Tirrell, whose kindness
and cooperation have vastly eased
the burdens involved in the work.
I am neither resentful nor im
patient with the present situation.
But I do hope ways can be found
to still further advance the growth
in collaboration that has take n
place.

Editor's Note: We have asked
Mr. Naylor to reply to Mon
day's letter from Mr. Langen
dorf and Dr. Tilgner.
The article in question was writ
ten from information gathered
from a series of conversations
with West German students
; whom I met more or less at ran
dom during a six-month stay at
Stanford in Germany. Those few
students who did not themselves
favor neutralism as a practical
step toward reunification said that
the neutralist view was in fact
prevalent in student circles. Per
haps it is not the view of a ma
i jority of West German college stu
dents, but it is certainly the view
of "a large portion." It should be
added that students in West Ber
lin tend to be much more strongly
pro-West than students in West
Germany.

The following is a translation
of a recently discovered Ist Cent.
Dead Sea Scroll in the form of a
letter addressed to the local com
manding bishop of the R o m a n

"Dear Sir:
"It has come to my attention
that God has seen fit to place His
Son 011 Earth for the purpose of
inducing people to His service.
Granted tin? familiar premise
that God's omniscience has
nothing on me, it seems that I
should have the similar privilege
J of being allowed to enter Heaven
for tin 1 purpose of inducing t he
I blessed to defect to Ihe other side

(or whatever tlie proper spatial
relationship is>.
.... God has been allowed a
favorable position to present His
side of the argument to men, and
all I ask is favorable circum
stances to present my side of the
argument to Ihe Saints.
. . . . If you reciprocate my tol
erance of God, I shall be pleased
to appear in Heaven with posters
and pamphlets (I got no cross,
boss) encouraging the Host to de
sert theirs.
"If you fail to recognize my
logic, nevertheless I hope you will
see the consistency in removing
your salvation and not return it
until you realize that I have al
ready saved myself. I'll be damned
if I won't go to Heaven.

Editor, The Daily:
I must agree with most of what
you said about LASSU but object
to your oversimplification of th e
issue.
The LASSU has been a weak
and unthinking legislative body.
When actions have been consid
ered, potential results have been
substantially disregarded. The em
phasis has been on the open-ended
a c t i on s presented by a few of
ASSU executives.
This sometimes misplaced em
phasis is a symptom of a deeper
fault in the idealogy of the ASSU,
that is, that it is a politic body,
and as such, should use every
pressure in its possession to grab
what it can.
I have heard that the concept
of student participation in admin
istration committees was horribly
dulled by the united and obviously
artificial stands that the ASSU
assigned students would take.
These positions were obviously
those of the ASSU president.
I am not condemning these offi
cials for their actions, but I am
suggesting that the other groups,
administrating this campus, are
more democratically controlled.
1 am more than pleased to see
that initiative has been taken by
many LASSU members lately,
concerning religion and study
facilities in particular. To facili
tate the studies, the members of
these committees have approached
and cooperated with members of
the faculty and administration and
have come in closer contact with
the student body. Over the last
year I have noticed an increased
awareness among the students
that the faculty and administra
tion are accessible, and more than
eager to provide assistance or ad
vice, or to hear our complaints.
1 believe that it is now time
for our executives to poll their
constituency, the student body, to
review their policies, and to slnff
off the ego-centric dream world
they live in.

Editor, The Daily:
I must agree with most of what
you said about LASSU but object
to your oversimplification of th e
issue.
The LASSU has been a weak
and unthinking legislative body.
When actions have been consid
ered, potential results have been
substantially disregarded. The em
phasis has been on the open-ended
a c t i on s presented by a few of
ASSU executives.
This sometimes misplaced em
phasis is a symptom of a deeper
fault in the idealogy of the ASSU,
that is, that it is a politic body,
and as such, should use every
pressure in its possession to grab
what it can.
I have heard that the concept
of student participation in admin
istration committees was horribly
dulled by the united and obviously
artificial stands that the ASSU
assigned students would take.
These positions were obviously
those of the ASSU president.
I am not condemning these offi
cials for their actions, but I am
suggesting that the other groups,
administrating this campus, are
more democratically controlled.
1 am more than pleased to see
that initiative has been taken by
many LASSU members lately,
concerning religion and study
facilities in particular. To facili
tate the studies, the members of
these committees have approached
and cooperated with members of
the faculty and administration and
have come in closer contact with
the student body. Over the last
year I have noticed an increased
awareness among the students
that the faculty and administra
tion are accessible, and more than
eager to provide assistance or ad
vice, or to hear our complaints.
1 believe that it is now time
for our executives to poll their
constituency, the student body, to
review their policies, and to slnff
off the ego-centric dream world
they live in.

I wish to express my apprecia
tion of the stimulating work of
| reporting done by the Stanford
Daily about the religious situation
here.
I see three immediate benefits:
in increasing awareness in the
whole community, of the signifi
cance of religion as an issue in
life; a realization of the growth
and success of inter-faith collabo
ration already existing in the cam
pus; and a manifestation of the
value of freedom, both of religion
and of the press.
In the long run, I do hope to
see on-campus office space 112 or
denomination ministers to see
counselees, and also worship con
ducted according to the customs
and convictions of various faiths.
Over the years the lack of these
things has worked a hardship on
all. Although many barriers have
been removed in recent years, the
one of geography still remains.
I sympathize with the adminis
strative problems involved in mak
ing these changes, and I want to
express my regard for Mr. Minto
and Mr. Tirrell, whose kindness
and cooperation have vastly eased
the burdens involved in the work.
I am neither resentful nor im

to still further advance the growth
in collaboration that has take n

the neutralist view was in fact

Mr. Naylor to reply to Mon
day's letter from Mr. Langen
dorf and Dr. Tilgner.
The article in question was writ
ten from information gathered
from a series of conversations
with West German students
; whom I met more or less at ran
dom during a six-month stay at
Stanford in Germany. Those few
students who did not themselves
favor neutralism as a practical
step toward reunification said that
the neutralist view was in fact
prevalent in student circles. Per
haps it is not the view of a ma
i jority of West German college stu
dents, but it is certainly the view
of "a large portion." It should be
added that students in West Ber
lin tend to be much more strongly
pro-West than students in West
Germany.

Editor, The Daily:
I must agree with most of what
you said about LASSU but object
to your oversimplification of th e
issue.
The LASSU has been a weak
and unthinking legislative body.
When actions have been consid
ered, potential results have been
substantially disregarded. The em
phasis has been on the open-ended
a c t i on s presented by a few of
ASSU executives.
This sometimes misplaced em
phasis is a symptom of a deeper
fault in the idealogy of the ASSU,
that is, that it is a politic body,
and as such, should use every
pressure in its possession to grab
what it can.
I have heard that the concept
of student participation in admin
istration committees was horribly
dulled by the united and obviously
artificial stands that the ASSU
assigned students would take.
These positions were obviously
those of the ASSU president.
I am not condemning these offi
cials for their actions, but I am
suggesting that the other groups,
administrating this campus, are
more democratically controlled.
1 am more than pleased to see
that initiative has been taken by
many LASSU members lately,
concerning religion and study
facilities in particular. To facili
tate the studies, the members of
these committees have approached
and cooperated with members of
the faculty and administration and
have come in closer contact with
the student body. Over the last
year I have noticed an increased
awareness among the students
that the faculty and administra
tion are accessible, and more than
eager to provide assistance or ad
vice, or to hear our complaints.
1 believe that it is now time
for our executives to poll their
constituency, the student body, to
review their policies, and to slnff
off the ego-centric dream world
they live in.

I wish to express my apprecia
tion of the stimulating work of

Daily about the religious situation
here.
I see three immediate benefits:
in increasing awareness in the

cance of religion as an issue in
life; a realization of the growth
and success of inter-faith collabo
ration already existing in the cam
pus; and a manifestation of the
value of freedom, both of religion
and of the press.
In the long run, I do hope to
see on-campus office space 112 or

counselees, and also worship con
