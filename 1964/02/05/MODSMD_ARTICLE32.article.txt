## Goldwater Challenges Liberals 
### DARRYL R. WOLD 
Conservatives now have a can
didate for the presidential nomi
nation, the first one since Robert
Taft. Senator Goldwater prom
ises to wage a vigorous cam
paign against established Liberal
programs, challenging them not
on the basis of how they should
be carried, but rather, whether
certain programs should be insti
tuted at all.
American Liberaldom has had

its root assump
tions challenged.
The ensuing de
! bate between
| presidential can
i dictates oi' oppo
! site political bc
\ liefs could result
!in one of the
j most significant

political campaigns in years, in
volving a discussion of ihe basic
values of our system.
This prospect, though, has had
|a near-traumatic effecl on the
left. The numerous and prolific
Liberal columnists are doing their
best to prevent a two-sided discus
sion of the issues from taking
place, demonstrating William F.
Buckley's characterization of the
American intelligentsia as having
less nerve, less coinage, and less
nervous stability than the average
truck driver. They have thrown
up a screen in front of the basic
issues; a screen designed to pre
vent the penetration of logical and
rational analysis. When con
fronted with a challenge to their
concepts, they have been found
wanting, unable (or unwilling) to
defend their position.

WALTER I. J PPM AN, for in
stance, can over-simplify any of
Goidwater's views into a sen
tence, and then dismiss the idea
with a reaction of horror, based on
illogic. "Goldwater would repeal
the progressive income tax. a mea
sure so extreme it would dis
mantle the national defense and
destroy the credit of the U.S."
Lippmann manages to insinuate
that Goldwater has advocated re
peal of the whole personal income
tax. wheh he hasn't. Even if the
progressive features of the income
tax were repealed, and the basic
rate raised only slightly to 22 per
cent, the amount of revenue lost
to the government would be a lit
tle over $7 billion, approximately
the same amount as spent on agri
cultural subsidies. But Lippmann,
a spider caught in his own web
of non-think. never gets as far as
the facts.
"HE WOULD sell TV A." The
very though of the federal gov
ernment divesting itself of con
trol of this overgrown octopus is
apparently enough to excuse fur
ther discussion. Besides, further
discussion might reveal the fact
that Goldwater advocated selling
the TV A to the states interested,
or to private interests under stale
control, and this would prevent
Lippmann from summarily dis
missing the idea.
Probably the most insidious and
vicious attacks are those that at
tempt to link Goldwater to segre
gation and Jim Crowism. Care
fully voiding any discussion of
the issues involved in the "pub
lic accommodations" proposal
and various Supreme Court deci
sions, the commentators of the
left almost unanimously attack
Goldwater for opposing these mea
sures solely on the basis that seg
regationists also oppose them.

JOSEPH ALSOP claims that
Goldwater, by taking the stands
he does, will automatically make
the Republican Party into the
"white man's party," although he
admits that Goldwater himself is
"no racist." Ralph McGill spares
no pains to tie Goldwater in with
the White Citizens Council, the
Klu Klux Klan. and anti-semitism.
Walter Lippmann doesn't miss
the opportunity here, either,
claiming t h a t if Goldwater be
comes the Republican nominee,
"the party of Lincoln would have
become the rallying point of the
racists."
To have a campaign between
candidates of such diverse ideolo
gies as Goldwater and Johnson,
for instance, would give the Amer
ican people a real chance to ex
amine the basic issues facing
them, and at least would be a re
freshing change from the mish
mash and clap-trap typifying so
many political campaigns.
Much of this opportunity wjll be
' lost, though, if tlie leading com
mentators of the left continue to
throw their obl'uscations over the
I issues.
