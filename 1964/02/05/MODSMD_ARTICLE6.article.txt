## 
### JIM HAUSER 
The major result of the Second
Vatican Council is the encounter
of Catholicism with Protestant
ism. "Neither will walk away
from the encounter unchanged,"
said Robert McAfee Brown.
Brown, delivering the Tuesday
Evening Series lecture in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium last night, sum
marized the accomplishments of
the Council and outlined the issues
for its next session.
THE COUNCIL'S redefinition
of the place of the layman in the
Church was one of the most im
portant actions of the sessions.
The Council voted to consider all
baptized Catholics part of a "Uni
versal Priesthood." This action
challenges the Medieval concept
of holiness which defined two
kinds of holiness, one for the
clergy who took the vows of "pov
erty, chastity, and obedience" and
another lower form or the laity.
Brown also emphasized the
Council's impact on the world as
a whole. The Catholic should keep
the spirit of the Council alive in
his Diocese and Catholic Press.
"The era of the laity is present,"
Brown said. The Protestant must
ask himself the question, "Where
are the fruits of reform within
the Protestant life?"
He defined the role of the per
son who believes neither in Catho
licism nor in Protestant as en
couraging the two groups to come
together to work for ecuminism.
USING A PUN for which he
apologized ,Brown said the last
If) days of the Council "sort of
Petered out." The unfinished busi
ness of these days will provide
the issues of the next session.
The doctrine on Christian lib
erty, which affirms the right of
all groups to preach and spread
their beliefs, had an unofficial
majority backing at the last
session, but never came to a vote.
(OLLEGIALITY, a statement
redefining Ihe power of the
Bishops to put them in a more
important position than the con
servative Curia, was approved by
an 80 per cent majority. The move
indicates the trend toward pro
gressivism and away from con
servatism in the Church, Brown
said.
