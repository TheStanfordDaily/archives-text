# Berlin: A Tale Of Two Cities
## 
### ROBERT NAYLOR Stuff Editor 
[ As Templehof Airport, center
of the 1948-49 Berlin Airlift, dis
| appeared below the ascending
Pan American jet-prop, most of
the passengers, students of Stan
-1 ford-in-Germany's Group XI, were
i asking themselves the same ques-
I tion: "When can 1 return to Ber
j lin?"
j The city had cast its spell, and
| some talked of coming back some
year to study at the modern Free
: University in West Berlin. The
J study tour to Berlin, everyone
I agreed, had been the most im
portant experience since their ar
' rival in Germany lasl June.
Berlin's magic cannot be ex
plained without reference to its
| unique position in the world. The
; city is the very center of Europe,
| geographically and politically.
I Berlin has been the center of the
East-West conflict since before
the West was really aware of the
[conflict. It was to be the scene,
j said Lenin, of the second commit
| nist revolution. And the defeat of
j the Third Reich gave the Soviet
, Union its first major territorial
I advances. When it became appar
lent that the Soviet Union had re
| taincd aggressive policies, Berlin
'became the center of attention,
the symbol of Western determina
j tion not to allow further Com
| munist advances, not to let Ger
'mans fall and with it all Europe.

The city became the best tool of
the Kremlin in Cold War tactics
and the most painful thorn of em
barrassment.
For within the city's well-guard
ed borders lie representatives of
the systems of capitalism and
Communism, democracy and to
talitarianism, side by side for all
the world to see. The wall erected
early in the morning of August
13, 1961, stands as unerasable
proof that a free East. German
people would give Walter Ulbrichl
something less than the 99 per
cent plurality he continuously ob
tains.
Thus the city provides an end
less source of conversations and
comparisons, a source of which
the students took full advantage
during their ten-day stay. On the
western side, students quizzed ref
ugees and students ;it the Free
University, and found the man on
the street, to be deeply aware of,
and interested in, the political
situation. Crossing into the Com
munist sector, students talked tor
long afternoons and evenings
with hardened Communists, stu
dents of Humboldt University,
both pro- and anti-regime, mem
bers of Fast Berlin church youth
groups, etc. People from all walks
of life in both systems were at
tentively heard and thoroughly
questioned.
Prices of goods, quality a n d
variety, extent of rationing and
general shortages, quality of stu

dent dance joints and restaurants,
amount and quality of post-war
reconstruction everything came
under close scrutiny. What the
students saw and heard confirmed
to a large extent what they had
been told. Rationing still goes on
in the Fast, sometimes in dis
guised forms and less severely.
Shortages in clothes with respect
to size and variety remain, while
quality is poor. The people usual
ly get whatever cannot be ex
ported; Waiting lists of two 1o
four years exist for automobiles
and television sets, whose cost is
often above the range which the
average Fast Berliner can afford.
While progress in rebuilding is
being made in the East, it does
not compare in amount or archi
tectural design to the shining
skyscrapers and colorful apart
ment districts of the West.
Restaurants and cabarets, most
of them state-owned, are ade
quate, but very plain. There is
never the range of quality from
just adequate to luxurious- which
can be found in the West. Traffic
in East Berlin is sparee and by
early evening the city is dead.
The pedestrian, at least, is re
lieved of the necessity of waiting
at corners to cross. These con
ditions, students were told by
East and Wesl Berliners alike, are
a good deal better than those in
the rest of Fast Germany.
