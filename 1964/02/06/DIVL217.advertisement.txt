THE POWER OF CHRIST
"He is the exact likeness of the unseen God—the visible representa
tion of the invisible; lie is the first-born—of all creation. For it was in
Him that all things were created, in heaven and on earth, things seen
and things unseen, whether thrones, dominions, rulers, or authorities;
all things were created and exist through Him and in Him all things
consist—cohere, are held together . . . For it lias pleased the Father
that all the divine fullness—the sun total of the divine perfection,
powers, and attributes—should dwell in Him permanently." Col. 1:15-
17,19 Ampl.
This Jesus Christ who walked among us a? a man is different from
all other men. He is the complete God-man—fully God and fully man.
As the Eternal Son of God, He sustains and directs the operation of
the entire cosmos. It is His power and might which support the worlds.
He is the Regulator of time and the Director of the movement of history
towards its climax.
Jesus Christ is known personally by a small group of people who
call themselves Christians. They have submitted themselves to His
dominion, and thereby participate in the triumphant culmination of His
purpose. Because they know what He is like and have experimentally
verified His claims, they do not hesitate to proclaim Him as man's
only hope.
Won't you see for yourself that Jesus Christ is ( 1 ) exclusively suffi
cient, (2) perpetually satisfying, (3) instantaneously accessible, and
(4) absolutely necessary?
Christianity is not primarily a religion or theology. It is knowing
Jesus Christ intimately. Until you have met Jesus personally, religion
and theology can wait.
