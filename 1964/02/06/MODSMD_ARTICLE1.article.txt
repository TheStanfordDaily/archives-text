• OAS Enters Panama Conflict
WASHINGTON The council of the Or
ganization of American States voted 16 to 1
Tuesday to invoke the inter-American treaty
of mutual assistance and formally consider
Panama's charge against the United States of
aggression.
The United States lias denied the accusa
tion but has voiced no objection to a probe
of the charge by the OAS.
Under the 1947 treaty the OAS council will
turn itself into what is called the organ of
consultation, empowered to suggest collective
measures to insure the peace of the hemis
phere.
The United States and Panama did not
participate in the vote. Chile cast the lone
vote against the action.
The organ of consultation, which is to
meet Wednesday, acts on behalf of the Amer
ican foreign ministers until and if they decide

1o meet themselves.
• Franco Signs Polish Pact
PARIS — France made another stride
Wednesday toward increasing trade with the
Communist world by signing a new pact with
Poland and reporting another in the making
for the Soviet Union.
Both pacts particularly would benefit
French exports but officials said the goal—
to which Poland and the Soviet Union agree
—is an increase of two-way trade.
No sooner had French and Polish officials
toasted their signatures at a special luncheon
than Italy announced that it, too was boosting
trade with the Soviet Union.
