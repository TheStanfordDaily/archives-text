## Krino: Imperatives, Generalizations Antagonize Reader; Content Thin 
### James Kerans 
Assistant Professor of Speech and Drama
A page or two of fine criticism, six lines of graceful verse (in
German), and a story whose mangled brilliance survives in a few
hot phrases and some dazzling surrealist transitions—that is w hat
the editor "gives us in KRINO 111. Thin
First, the poems. 'Anonymous" (Nisetich?) treats a single
subject, first (?) in English and then in German: a vision of
primal integrity, coolly recalled through some plain yet daring
images, and handsomely fitting phrases to breath. The German
version is by far the better, with its beautifully spaced \stralilciul,
its lucid medium, and the dramatic (if unaccountable) dimen
sion suggested by 'Astrophel.' The English, on the other hand, is
relatively pale, gets restless for effect toward the end and leaves
the stage with its syntactical poise badly shaken. What holds me
is an irony in the style: no sooner has the speaker conjured his
vision than it fixes him in an uroborie trance.

'In this day,' as Mr. Pricr would say, a title like Two Jolly
Jingles' (here used for Peter Schrocder's two lyrics) promises
some hardy grotesquerie—the hardier the better. The jingles are
there: voiceless meters, rhymes that would disgrace a Hallmark
hack, and ironic surprises fused to go off precisely at the last
word; but 'jolly' is never given its poetic conversion. 'Periwinkle
Song" was apparently written with such confidence in the effec
tiveness of its tidy reversal that it vamps lefthandedly for seven
lines and then—plank.
Ol the three prose pieces, the short story 'The Cripples of
Puerto-Nueva' best justifies the editors anticipation that some of
the material will be 'unclear to [my] more constrained level of
consciousness. The story is an intersection of several highly
charged currents. Scenieally it packs together Africa, Spain, intol
erable sunscape and dark, wharfsliadowed brine, resort hotel and
a village of derelict cripples—all in a sulphurous chiaroscuro which
just manages to stay clear of postcard and jewelry-shop chic on
the one hand and lurid squalor on the other.
The dramatic relationships are submerged in the concentra
tion upon the 'young man' who seems to serve as narrator, cele
brant, and sacrifice iu an encounter with an indistinct and some
what cliche femme fatale, with the poisonous sea, and with a leap
into immerson and, perhaps, self-transcendence. The style is so
gauche, .so reckless, that the imagination chokes on it, and its bril
liance remains outside, something observed rather than felt, ex
cept for a few passages.
Robert McKenzie's fable, The Man Who Threw Rocks And
Ate Snails,' is a timid parody (unintentional, alas) of the now
lamiliar beat style. The fakesimplicity disguises the customary
compressed meaning behind paratactic monosyllables, all gov
erned by the somber tone of a hieropliant ex machina at the end:
'And this man was in resonance.'
★ ★ ★
What is good about Frank Nisetich s piece on Joyce is so good
that one forgives the slightly overheated and gooey manner in
which it is set. The 'gift of Joyce's are emerges as a relationship
between the artist and an angel—or goddess—through which it
becomes possible for the artist to make music—to recover the har
mony of body and soul, and thus for the reader to be "restored '
through mimesis of that music. This is perhaps not novel, but it
is achieved by genuine, and one wants to say loving response to
Joyce' work, and that is by no means common.
From its first issue, KlilNO has drawn attention to itself as an
issue in another sense: as a communicant ol 'serious thought.' lias
it established itself within range of it promise and our hopes?
If 1 respond to the magazine and to its point of view as Mr.
Prior asks us to respond to the creative and critical complex in
general, I find myself respectfully antagonistic. I resist—perhaps
despise—the stream of imperatives which pour from the editorials,
the hasty and strategic generalizations about 'the contemporary
worldview and 'this day—especially when the devaluation in
volved aims at restoring the lost glories of the age of Peter Lom
bard.
Above all I miss that sign of vitality which liianilcsts itself in
luiL'hter-serious laughter, ol course.

becomes possible for the artist to make music—to recover the har
mony of body and soul, and thus for the reader to be "restored '

A page or two of fine criticism, six lines of graceful verse (in
German), and a story whose mangled brilliance survives in a few
hot phrases and some dazzling surrealist transitions—that is w hat
the editor "gives us in KRINO 111. Thin
First, the poems. 'Anonymous" (Nisetich?) treats a single
subject, first (?) in English and then in German: a vision of
primal integrity, coolly recalled through some plain yet daring
images, and handsomely fitting phrases to breath. The German
version is by far the better, with its beautifully spaced \stralilciul,
its lucid medium, and the dramatic (if unaccountable) dimen
sion suggested by 'Astrophel.' The English, on the other hand, is
relatively pale, gets restless for effect toward the end and leaves
the stage with its syntactical poise badly shaken. What holds me
is an irony in the style: no sooner has the speaker conjured his
vision than it fixes him in an uroborie trance.

'In this day,' as Mr. Pricr would say, a title like Two Jolly
Jingles' (here used for Peter Schrocder's two lyrics) promises
some hardy grotesquerie—the hardier the better. The jingles are
there: voiceless meters, rhymes that would disgrace a Hallmark
hack, and ironic surprises fused to go off precisely at the last
word; but 'jolly' is never given its poetic conversion. 'Periwinkle
Song" was apparently written with such confidence in the effec
tiveness of its tidy reversal that it vamps lefthandedly for seven
lines and then—plank.
Ol the three prose pieces, the short story 'The Cripples of
Puerto-Nueva' best justifies the editors anticipation that some of
the material will be 'unclear to [my] more constrained level of
