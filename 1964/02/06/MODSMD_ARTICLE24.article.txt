## Campus Socrates, Aphrodites: Soak Up Sun, Forget Tests 
### Ford Burkhart 
If the sun is warm this afternoon, you won't be alone out there
on the lawn.
Sprawled on the grass nearby will be young Socrates in sun
glasses with a greenbag aucl tennis shoes.
And just a few blades of grass from him, you'll find Aphrodite
in a sweatshirt, tormented, as usual, by her inner conflict between
Passion and Reason.
At u glance, anyone would see that they were Stanford scholars
on an extended study break in front of the library. And that goes
for the two dozen other Sun Seekers scattered around the lawn
absorbing beneficial rays for an hour or two. Or perhaps longer.
But how can one explain this pastoral scene when mid-term
tests are just around the corner? With the entrance to the library
stacks just 97 paces to the east, why don't the scholars move inside
and study?
A plausible answer turned up a few days ago.
When the weather on the old Greek peninsula was lair. Old
Socrates could be found under a tree or on a hillside where he
i could contemplate the wonders of sky and earth. And in the
j Stanford society of sun seekers, there are few pale faces.

Hut the pleasures of a Socratic snooze in the sun do nothing
to help one prepare for the approaching disaster of a mid-term
Why don't the Sun People tturn back to the stacks and
: study the way they know they ought to?
Recall how the scholars paraphrased Euripedes in passages
I pertinent to this point: "We are at the mercy of our desires.
And everyone knows what that means.
Reason fights Desire—and loses.
Body fights Soul—and always wins.
We know our behavior may be evil, in some cases lazy or
i indolent, but we carry it through in style nonetheless. Its just
our nature.
Is there any hope?
Of course, That's where a friendly God comes down from the l
mountain in the hour of need, about the middle of the second
blue-book, and saves Man from the disaster brought on by his
untamed Passion.
Therefore, peaceful Aphrodite and younu; Socrates should go
right on soaking up sun, and studying the sky, the grass, and each
other with as much inner tranquility as the Protestant Ethic will
permit.
The God will know when they're needed.
