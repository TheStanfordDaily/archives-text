## Where Was LASSU? It Began Work On Religion Early Autumn Quarter 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In his column about LASSU Mr.
Beck raised the question: "Where
wore the student representatives
when all the religious discontent
was building up among their con
stituents?"
The answer is that they have
been at work on the problem since
early in Autumn Quarter. On
October 17, during the second
meeting of the legislature, a spe
cial .committee was appointed by
Bud Wedin to study campus atti
tudes and university policy on re
ligion. Chairman Dan Schwartz
gave reports on the committee's
progress to the legislature on
October 31, November 14. and
November 26. Last Thursday the
committee presented a compre
hensive report to the legislature,
comprised of several months of
work and thought, and imple
mented by an opinion pole of
nearly 200 randomly selected stu
dents.
Legislature chose to do a thor
ough job. rather than an im
mediate one. Next week, when it
votes on recommending changes
in university policy, it can be as
sured of the facts with which it
is working, and thus do a respon
sible job of representing stu
dent opinion.
Mr. Beck is to be commended
on his column. Hopefully, it will
be a useful device for keeping
participants in all areas of stu
dent politics on their toes; how
[Cver, on this particular issue, he
is sadly misinformed.

Editor, The Daily:
If you publish everyday a piece
of "literature" like the letter by
a certain Vicente Gondin which
appeared in the Daily last Tues
day, February 4, I promise I'll
give up reading the comics in the
CHRONICLE: "The Mailbox" will
be much more fun to read.
Aside from being funny, Mr.
Gondin appears confused. He and
others like him do not read what
they see, but what they think. To
impute our own thoughts to
others' words is more than fun
ny; it is dangerous. Such a policy
in world affairs can lead to war.
Old Timer W. Madison believes
I in an aura of 'good taste' in writ-
I ten expression of opinion and
questions the kind of education
which disregards 'good taste.'

There is nothing in W. Madi
son's letter to suggest that he
favors sentiments like, "Give Flor
ida back to Spain, Louisiana to
France. Alaska to Russia. . . It
appears from the letters in this
column that a great many stu
dents feel that their superior (?)
intelligence permits them to read
the minds of others with preci
sion.

• Stanford Players
Editor, The Daily:
By 6:10 last Saturday evening
the line meandered around the
four walls of the Nitery theater's
lohby. Over 70 people had assem
bled 20 minutes before the ticket
window opened to buy the 32
tickets to O'Neill' Long Day's
Journey Into Night. No usher was
present to keep the line straight.
Instead the patrons themselves
set up their own lines. And by
6:30 when the first tickets went
on sale, the line curled around in
isde itself in a snakelike fashion.
The 32 tickets were all bought so
the cast can boast that they
played to a full house. Before the
50 people who were turned away
left, however, the lines discipline
broke down, and two grown men
argued over the right to buy one
ticket.
The Stanford Players must
change their ticket distributing
technique. An usher should be
present before the doors to the
lobby are opened to keep order
and to lessen the confusion. If
t lie Players don't have an usher,
why don't they sell their tickets
at the Tresidder Box Office as
other reputable organizations do.
An advance sale would toll the
Players how many people to ex
pect and enable them to choose
a suitable sized theater. This ad
vanced sale would also end th e
need for a student to stand in line
for an hour. Indeed, the Stanford
Players are committing a disserv
ice to the community with th e i r
present method of selling tickets.
Students lose valuable study time j
standing around in lobbies where
the lights arc too dim for read
ing. Vistiohs to the university are
shocked to sec two grown men |
quibble. Married students m us t
hire baby sitters for the privilege!
of standing in the Nitery's lobby!
for an hour and to be turned
away.
