# Berlin Wall Symbolizes Stark Value Contrasts
## 
### ROBERT W NAYLOR Staff Editor 
The economic contrasts between
East and West Berlin were largely
expected, but students were con
fronted with a far more unset
tling contrast, the human con
trust, the differences in mood, in
happiness, in expectations for the
future.
IT SOON BECAME apparent
in conversations with the people
of the divided city that Commu
nist planners fail to include the
human factor in their calculations.
Separated families confronted
students with the sort of personal
tragedy which is singularly un
common in the United States.
Lovers divided by the wall who
will never be able to marry, stu
dents who will never he able to
study subjects of their own choos
ing, church goers who will always
be discriminated against by the
state even the average East
Berliner who will never be able
to replace the three-year-old pair
of shoes he bought in the West,
or attend a Western movie or read
a non-party newspaper or drink a
Coca Cola these people add a
human dimension to Berlin which
cannot lie found anywhere else
in the world.

1 THE UNFORTUNATE source
of this aspect of Berlin, of course,
is the Wall, a structure which
cannot be fully believed even if
seen. No picture, no description
can duplicate the feeling of des
pair and hopelessness it conveys.
The sight of machine-gun carry
ing Vopos (People's Police) stand
ing on dark, empty subway plat
forms as the Western train passes
through a section of the East Sec
tor is simply beyond the realm
of experience of the average
United States citizen.
Not far from the Wall, and per
haps also symptomatic of the
West, is the thriving center of
West Berlin, based around th e
broad boulevard Kurfurstendamm
teeming with traffic, glittering
with flashing lights, doited with
cinemas and theaters and restau
rants, filled with shops for every
taste.
BERLIN, in spite of its pre- j
carious position, has become a I
major cultural center of Western
i Europe. Its world-renowned phil
harmonic orchestra, conducted by
a group of the finest composers,
headed by Herbert von Karajan,
presents concerts in the newly
opened concert mall, a daring ad
venture iti modern abstract archi
tecture designed by Hans Scha
roun. This hall is the latest ex
ample of Berlin's dedication to
modern living and tho promotion
of modern culture.
TIIE I'EOI'LE of Berlin, West
and East, impressed the Stan
! ford group with their friendliness
land warmth, their hospitality and
vivaciousncss. Their interest in
I politics is understandably high,
j Their love for Americans, ex
pressed so poignantly in the re
naming of the square in front of,
the Schoencburg City Hall for
John Kennedy, has grown over
the years from their admiration
of such men an General Lucius i
Clay, their excellent relations
with the American forces sta
jtioncd there, and their apprecia-j
lion of tho fad that the viability
of West Berlin depends on the
firmness of the United States.
IT WAS a combination of the |
I people, the culture, and the politi-.
leal and personal implications of,
| the divided city which served to j
| make the visit so valuable. The
j seeing and experiencing of Ber
lin will long remain for the stu
dents the most signifcant phase
I of their stay in Europe.

Not far from the Wall, and per
haps also symptomatic of the
West, is the thriving center of
West Berlin, based around th e
broad boulevard Kurfurstendamm
teeming with traffic, glittering
with flashing lights, doited with
cinemas and theaters and restau
rants, filled with shops for every
taste.
BERLIN, in spite of its pre- j
carious position, has become a I
major cultural center of Western
i Europe. Its world-renowned phil
harmonic orchestra, conducted by
a group of the finest composers,
headed by Herbert von Karajan,
presents concerts in the newly
opened concert mall, a daring ad
venture iti modern abstract archi
tecture designed by Hans Scha
roun. This hall is the latest ex
ample of Berlin's dedication to
modern living and tho promotion
of modern culture.
TIIE I'EOI'LE of Berlin, West
and East, impressed the Stan
! ford group with their friendliness
land warmth, their hospitality and
vivaciousncss. Their interest in
I politics is understandably high,
j Their love for Americans, ex
pressed so poignantly in the re
naming of the square in front of,
the Schoencburg City Hall for
John Kennedy, has grown over
the years from their admiration
of such men an General Lucius i
Clay, their excellent relations
with the American forces sta
jtioncd there, and their apprecia-j
lion of tho fad that the viability
of West Berlin depends on the
firmness of the United States.
IT WAS a combination of the |
I people, the culture, and the politi-.
leal and personal implications of,
| the divided city which served to j
| make the visit so valuable. The
j seeing and experiencing of Ber
lin will long remain for the stu
dents the most signifcant phase
I of their stay in Europe.
The economic contrasts between
East and West Berlin were largely
expected, but students were con
fronted with a far more unset
tling contrast, the human con
trust, the differences in mood, in
happiness, in expectations for the
future.
IT SOON BECAME apparent
in conversations with the people
of the divided city that Commu
nist planners fail to include the
human factor in their calculations.
Separated families confronted
students with the sort of personal
tragedy which is singularly un
common in the United States.
Lovers divided by the wall who
will never be able to marry, stu
dents who will never he able to
study subjects of their own choos
ing, church goers who will always
be discriminated against by the
state even the average East
Berliner who will never be able
to replace the three-year-old pair
of shoes he bought in the West,
or attend a Western movie or read
a non-party newspaper or drink a
Coca Cola these people add a
human dimension to Berlin which
cannot lie found anywhere else
in the world.

1 THE UNFORTUNATE source
of this aspect of Berlin, of course,
is the Wall, a structure which
cannot be fully believed even if
seen. No picture, no description
can duplicate the feeling of des
pair and hopelessness it conveys.
The sight of machine-gun carry
ing Vopos (People's Police) stand
ing on dark, empty subway plat
forms as the Western train passes
through a section of the East Sec
tor is simply beyond the realm
of experience of the average
United States citizen.
