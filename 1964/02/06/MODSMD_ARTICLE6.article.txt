## Stewart Stresses Rights Mediation As Primary Supreme Court Role 
### MIKE ROSTER 
On June 17, 1963, the Supreme
Court of the United States handed
down, in a vote of 8-1, its historic
decision declaring the reading of
' scripture or the recitation of pray
j or in public schools as unconsti
tutional. The one dissenting vole
I was that of the Honorable Potter
Stewait, Associate Justice of the
(Supreme Court, appointed to that
! position in 1958. Justice Stewart
j has been on campus for two days
j by invitation of the Law School
| and Moot Court to judge the moot
I court case last nighl and lo give
] an informal speech today.
In a special interview yester
day, Justice Stewart cited three
areas in which the Supreme Court
is involved: areas of individual,
state, and federal rights. '' Th e
j role of umpire," he said, "between
I rights of saes on one hand and of
I the federal government on the
jot her has become a major role
of the court."
Regarding the rapid increase in
case loads which has hit the na
tion's highest court within the
i last ten years. Justice Stewart
j saw no solution within the imme
idiate future. The country's popu
lation is crowing rapidly while

the people are obviously "no less
litigious." More justices would
nol be a solution unless authority
in judging cases were delegated
among t he judges. At present,
each justice must write his own
opinion on every case after re
viewing all evidence, briefs, and
arguments. The "escape valve,"
according to Stewart, "is in the
court's discretion to hear cases."
He also felt that Ihe backlog of
cases in the judicial system could
be better eased on the lower levels
where additional courts as well as
judges can be provided.
THE PROCESS of administer
ing law, of course, is slow and
deliberate. "It would be more effi
cient more expiditious, I should
think lo abolish jury trials. But
speed, of course, is not the main
question. Rather, we must ask,
â€¢How was justice done?'" And
the right to trial by jury has long
been a cherished tradition in civil
ized countries and is not about
to be abandoned.
In his written decision regard
ing religion in public schools, Jus
tice Stewart wrote, "A compul
sory stale educational system so
structures a child' life that if reli
gious exercises are held to be an

impermissable activity in schools,
religion is placed at an artificial
and state-created disadvantage.
. . . "What these cases compel,
rather, is an analysis of just what
the 'neutrality' is which is re
quired by the interplay of the
establishment and free exercise
clauses of the First Amendment,
as imbedded in the, 14th. . . .
What is at issue here is a privil
ege rather than a right."
During the interview the .jus
tice reaffirmed his belief that
there was "just no factual evid
ence at all" in the two cases on
which the June IT decision was
based. This was said in reference
to the lack of sufficient factual
evidence, in Stewart's opinion, on
which the Supreme Court could
render its decision.
THK FEBRUARY recess of the
court is a, rather long one, and
Justice Stewar t as well as many
of his associates enjoy visits to
law schools around the country
during these breaks. "It is always
very gratifying," he emphasized,
"to sec the quality of legal educa
tion and of the men and women
and their character in law schools
today." This quality, he continued,
lias become broader and more
widespread. "This shows a good
future in the legal profession."
Past chairman of the Yal <'
Daily News, Justice Stewart was
graduated cum laudc with Phi
Bctta Kappa honors from Yale in
1937. He studied international law
at Cambridge and completed his
low training at Yale, where he
won a moot court decision him
self.
During his two terms as a city
councilman in Cincinnati, Justice
Stewart was active in work for
urban renewal. He supported Tafl
and Eisenhower during recent po
litical campaigns and was ap
pointed to the Supreme Court to
replace retiring Associate Justice
1 larold Hilz Burt on.
Later this year. Chief Justice
Karl Warren will also be on cam
pus when he will speak at com
mencement exercises.
