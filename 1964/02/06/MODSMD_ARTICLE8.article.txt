# Contention Arises On New Party
## Merit Of COUP Called Dubious 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
Last weekend there were no
student political parties on cam
pus; today there is one with
rumors of a second more radical
party in the making.
Student opinion of this sudden
burst of activity on tho local
political scene has ranged from
approval to frank disagreement
and dismay. One student called it
a "high sehoolish approach to
politics."
THE FIRST PARTY to appear
at Stanford, the University Party,
advocates virtually the same
issues and methods currently
accepted by campus leaders, and
differs only in a belief in the
necessity of a party.
The leaders of the newly formed
University Party, Paul Holdorf
and Tom Mosher, favor a loose
party system with a five man
committee called "COUP" head
ing their organization. The party
would take a stand on issues, for
the most part those currently ad
vocated by campus leaders, and
eventually nominate a candidate
for student body president.
They have stressed the need of
developing an issue oriented cam
paign in student government,
feeling that current ASSU elec
tions are decided for the most
part on personality, not issues.
Mosher yesterday termed th e
student reaction to UP as "ex
tremely favorable," adding that
between 40 and 50 students have
signed up for the party.
"Nearly every student leader
lias expressed approval of the
party's principles," he said. "They
really think that this will make
the election campaigns of issues."
Mosher also said that the fact
that candidates would be forced
to stand on issues and not on their
personalities was a big factor in
drawing student support.
"The only thing against it right
now is a feeling that if it were
not handled properly it could in
crease the divisiveness between
living groups," he said.
One student. Jim Haas, how
ever, expressed stronger opin
ions. "Things can be accom
plished now without a party, so
why run the risk of creating po
litical machinations in student
government that might result in
the issues being lost."
Other unfavorable opinions of
the UP included feelings that it
was simply a "power play," that
it might hurt student-administra
tion relations, and that it would
simply create a formal, well-de
fined "in-group" in student gov
eminent.
