In June, 1963, The Royal Press, which has been serving Stanford students
for 8 years with the well known Western Civ Outline, merged with Mon
arch Press, Inc. of New York to form a nationwide corporation serving
students in almost every college in the country. Now, for the first time,
Review Notes in every major field, for all large courses are available to
Stanford students. Each book contains the same unique features which
made the WESTERN C!V OUTLINE must reading.
• Monarch presents all essential text information concisely and clearly in
outline form.
• Monarch Review Notes are keyed to your textbook and to your course.
• Monarch's sample exam questions and answers test your knowledge of the
required material.
• Monarch books are written by experts—lnstructors and professors who are
specialists in their fields.
• Monarch's charts, diagrams and special sections geared to your course are
often added extras.
