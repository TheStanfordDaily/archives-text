# OPENING TONIGHT
## Producer Predicts Strong Program For One Acts 
### JOSEPH L. JACOBS 
"Of course we've had problems,"
said Jay Weaver, producer of
Ram's Head Winter One Acts
opening tonight at 8 30 p.m. in
Little Theatre for a five perfor
mance run. "But," he went on to
ask, "what show doesn't have dif
ficulties of one sort or another?
We've been lucky in that the prob
lems that have arisen have been
solved without much trouble."
Weaver was sitting in the audi
ence during an intermission at
last night's dress rehearsal. "One
of our biggest problems was
scheduling rehearsals for 'The
Church Triumphant.' Sean Cun
ningham, the director, finished a
role in another play here less than
two weeks ago, and Dennis Fales
—the only man in the cast —is also
rehearsing for 'The Threepenny
Opera.' That's a problem you just
have to face—good actors are in
demand. But we've managed to
work around it quite well and the
show is in excellent shape.
"THIS IS ONE of the strongest
programs I've seen for 1 One Acts,"
continued Weaver. "The casts are
all very strong, using a great
many new people along with some
veterans whose faces would be
familiar to almost any Stanford
playgoer."
Among the latter he mentioned
Lynn Boatsman and Lynne Chat
terton, both appearing in "The
Doctor In Spite Of Himself."

"Lynn has acted in 'Kismet,' 'Oh
Captain!', 'South Pacific,' 1963
'Gaieties,' 'And Then Came Okla
homa' and 'The Three Cuckolds'
at Stanford. Lynne also worked
in 'Kismet' and 'South Pacific,'
and appeared in 'Pal Joey' and
the 1960, 1961 and 1962 editions of
'Gaieties' as well.
"HENRY ERNSTTHAL, who
plays the lieutenant in 'High
Rank' uses a realistic set of a
French farmhouse temporarily
taken over by a group of Amer
ican soldiers during World War
II."
McHOSE ALSO DESIGNED
"The Church Triumphant," which
he described as "a highly stylized
set depicting a New England barn
that has been converted into a
house. The sets for 'The Doctor
In Spite Of Himself were de
signed by its adapter-director Phil
Ellis, and can best be character
ized as early Walt Disney."
Lighting for all three of the
comedies was designed by another
Stanford soph, Bob Ray. "It was
quite a challenge trying to sug
gest three such differing moods,"
he said, "but I think we have suc
ceeded quite well."
ELLIS ALSO DESIGNED the
costumes for "The Doctor In
Spite Of Himself." Those for "The
Church Triumphant" were de
signed by Jean Schultz, a Stanford
graduate stud en t. The "High
Rank" costumes were supplied by
the United States Army.

costumes for "The Doctor In
Spite Of Himself." Those for "The
Church Triumphant" were de
signed by Jean Schultz, a Stanford
graduate stud en t. The "High
Rank" costumes were supplied by
the United States Army.
"Of course we've had problems,"
said Jay Weaver, producer of
Ram's Head Winter One Acts
opening tonight at 8 30 p.m. in
Little Theatre for a five perfor
mance run. "But," he went on to
ask, "what show doesn't have dif
ficulties of one sort or another?
We've been lucky in that the prob
lems that have arisen have been
solved without much trouble."
Weaver was sitting in the audi
ence during an intermission at
last night's dress rehearsal. "One
of our biggest problems was
scheduling rehearsals for 'The
Church Triumphant.' Sean Cun
ningham, the director, finished a
role in another play here less than
two weeks ago, and Dennis Fales
—the only man in the cast —is also
rehearsing for 'The Threepenny
Opera.' That's a problem you just
have to face—good actors are in
demand. But we've managed to
work around it quite well and the
show is in excellent shape.
"THIS IS ONE of the strongest
programs I've seen for 1 One Acts,"
continued Weaver. "The casts are
all very strong, using a great
many new people along with some
veterans whose faces would be
familiar to almost any Stanford
playgoer."
Among the latter he mentioned
Lynn Boatsman and Lynne Chat
terton, both appearing in "The
Doctor In Spite Of Himself."

"Lynn has acted in 'Kismet,' 'Oh
Captain!', 'South Pacific,' 1963
'Gaieties,' 'And Then Came Okla
homa' and 'The Three Cuckolds'
at Stanford. Lynne also worked
in 'Kismet' and 'South Pacific,'
and appeared in 'Pal Joey' and
the 1960, 1961 and 1962 editions of
'Gaieties' as well.
"HENRY ERNSTTHAL, who
plays the lieutenant in 'High
Rank' uses a realistic set of a
French farmhouse temporarily
taken over by a group of Amer
ican soldiers during World War
II."
McHOSE ALSO DESIGNED
"The Church Triumphant," which
he described as "a highly stylized
set depicting a New England barn
that has been converted into a
house. The sets for 'The Doctor
In Spite Of Himself were de
signed by its adapter-director Phil
Ellis, and can best be character
ized as early Walt Disney."
Lighting for all three of the
comedies was designed by another
Stanford soph, Bob Ray. "It was
quite a challenge trying to sug
gest three such differing moods,"
he said, "but I think we have suc
ceeded quite well."
