Benjamin Franklin (or The Louisville Slugger, as he is better
known as) said, "A penny saved is a penny earned," and we,
the college population of America, have taken to heart this sage
advice. We spend prudently; we budget diligently. Yet, despite
our wise precautions, we are always running short. Why? Be
cause there is one item of expense that we consistently under
estimate—the cost of travelling home for weekends.
Let us take the typical case of Basil Metabolism, a sophomore
at I'OLA majoring in avocados. Basil, a resident of Bangor,
Maine, loved to go home each weekend to play with his faithful
dog, Spot. What joy, what wreathed smiles, when Basil and
Spot were re-united! Basil would leap into his dogcart, and
Spot, a genuine Alaskan husky, would pull Basil all over Bangor,
Maine —Basil calling cheery hnlloos to the townfolk, Sjw>t
wagging his curly tail.

But the cost, alas, of travelling from UCLA to Bangor, Maine,
ran to $-100 a week, and Basil's father, alas, earned only a
meagre salary as a meter-reader for the Bangor water depart
ment. So, alas, after six months Basil's father told Basil he
could raise no more money; lie had already sold everything lie
owned, including the flashlight he used to read meters.
Basil returned to California to ponder his dilemma. One
solution occurred to him—to ship Spot to UCLA and keep him
in liis room—but Basil had to abandon the notion because of
his roommate, G. Fred Sigafoos, who was, alas, allergic to dog
hair.
Then another idea came to Basil—a stroke of genius, you
might call it. He would buy a Mexican hairless chihuahua!
Thus be would have a dog to pull him around, and G. Fred's
allergy would he undisturbed.
The results, alas, were not all Basil had hoped. The chihua
hua, alas, was unable to pull Basil in the dogcart, no matter
how energetically he beat the animal.
Defeated again, Basil sat down with G. Fred, his roommate,
to smoke a Marlboro Cigarette and seek a new answer to the
problem. Together they smoked and thought and—Eureka!—
an answer quickly appeared. (I do not suggest, mark you, that
Marlboro Cigarettes are an aid to cerebration. All I say about
Marlboros is that they taste good and are made of fine tobaccos
and pure white filters and come in soft pack or Flip Top box.)
Well, sir, Basil and 0. Fred got a great idea. Actually, the
idea was (.!. Fred's, who happened to be majoring in genetics.
Why not, said G. Fred, cross-breed the chihuahua with a Great
Dane and thus produce an animal sturdy enough to pull a dog
cart?
It was, alas, another plan doomed to failure. The cross-breed
ing was done, but the result, (this is very difficult to explain) was
a raccoon.
But there is, I am pleased to rej>ort, a happy ending to this
heart-rending tale. It seems that Basil's mother (this is also very
difficult to explain) is a glamorous blond aged 10 years. One
day she was sj>otted by a talent scout in I?nng<>r, Maine, and
was signed to a fabulous movie contract, and the entire family
moved to California and bought Bel Air, and today one of the
most endearing sights to be seen on the entire Pacific Coast is
Spot pulling Basil down Sunset Boulevard—Basil cheering and
Spot wagging. Basil's mother is also happy, making glamorous
movies all day lontr, and Basil's father is likewise content, sit
ting at home and reading the water meter. o iwm M«sh.iim»n
