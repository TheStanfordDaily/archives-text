# Roughs Ran REAL Rush
## 
### HILDA KOSSOH 
Wit li the best of reasons,
I hey were called the Stanford
Roughs.
Bealeii and often nearly
drowned as freshmen, they
eagerly awaited their soph
omore year and the chance
to retaliate on the incoming
class. Uppcrclassmen ha d
their own ingeniously near
murderous games, hut the
state between the freshmen
and sophomores approached
that of constant war.
Although the University
had been founded with no ap
parent basis for class rivalries
—there were no formal divi
sions. and students graduated
when they had completed the
required number of units —
these rivalries soon ♦level
oped. Insignias, hazing, rush
ing—all appeared within a
few years of the school's
opening, sometimes in espe
cially virulent forms.
In 1892, the Daily could
scornfully mock the pitiful
efforts of some students to
start class conflicts like those
in other colleges. By 1804, it
was gleefully reporting the
following full-scale battle be
tween the freshmen and soph
omores.
It seems that the soph
omores had had their big '07
on the old water tank. They
regarded the tank as their
particular signboard, as the
class of '05 revered a certain
oak tree. Their outrage was
great, then, when they found
one warm morning that the
impious class of '08 had
wiped out the sophomores'
numerals an d substituted
their own.

Such au insult from th e
miserable freshmen was un
thinkable, and the soph
omores set out in wrath to re
dress their grievance in red
paint.
The freshmen, pleased with
the night's work, had no in
tention of having it erased.
They marshalled around, un
der and on top of the tank —
armed with buckets and rope
—and waited for the assault.
In the struggle, which
raged through three dimen
sions for the best part of a
hot, mid-morning hour, t li e
participants treated their ap
preciative spectators to such
sights as: two dripping under
classmen balancing precar
iously atop the lofty tank and
covering one another with
cardinal-colored wall paint;
buckets full of water arching
down to drench the unwary
warriors on the ground be
low; and, finally, all avail
able once-lordly sophomores
bound and piled in a heap.
The freshman • sophomore
"rush" was a feature of Stan
ford life for many years —
condemned, accepted, banned,
revived, diluted and finally
abandoned in these quieter
days. Since the sophs regard
ed the "education" of the
freshmen as their sovereign
right, the rush was a natural
development. It gave the op
pressed a chance to strike
back — although they were
generally tied up and dumped
somewhere in the woods for
their pains by their seasoned
tormentors.
In fact, the last freshmen
to win an organized rush were
the class of 1000, and their
festivities were so wild that

the whole institution was out
lawed for ten years. Follow
ing groups endured informal
boxing matches, picked up
leathers while being* encour
aged by streams of ice-water
from third-floor dorm win
downs, and participated in
what a contemporary Daily
delicately called "decollete
foot races" out in the hills,
all without legal recourse.
Rush was revived and stab
ilized in the form of a base
hall game whose ninth inning
signaled tin* beginning rather
than the end of the fun. The
moment the last out was
called, frosh and so ph s
streamed onto the field and
began to tie each other up
with heavy cotton bandages—
or hailing wire, which w a s
frowned upon but was much
more efficient as it could not
be cut by the co-eds who hov
ered around the edges of the
fray and rescued anyone not
promptly dragged to special
jail areas.
Today, class rivalry is not
inevitable; it is inexplicable.
Even class government ha s
been abo Ii she d , on the
grounds that there is nothing
for it to do.
In last year's referendum
on the subject, HI of the
10,01)0 students voted to re
tain the organizations. They
were defeated by a narrow
margin as there were Hi!) who
found voting against the issue
worth the effort.
It may be amusing to think
about it, but a return to the
wild old ways is highly un
likely.
The corners have been
rubbed off the Stanford
Rough.
