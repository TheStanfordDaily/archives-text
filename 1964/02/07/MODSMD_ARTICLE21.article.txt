# Ruggers Face Hard Game
## 
### PETER FAKLAND 
The Stanford rugby squad,
whose scoring becomes more prol
ific every week, takes on a Uni
versities squad from Berkeley
which has posted two victories
against one defeat so far this
season.
Its victories were at the expense
of the Olympic Club and Stan
ford's first JV squad while the
Peninsula Ramblers handed it the
blemish on its record.
THE STANFORD attack, if
point outputs are any indication,
has seen significant improvements
over the last three weeks. The

first game it scored 11 points.
The next week it increased this
figure by eight, and the next
week's tilt saw a further increase
also.
Three starters will miss the
coming contest because of Law
School exams. They include Clark
Weaver, a steady performer in
the backfield; Bob Burke, the
team's most accurate place-kick
er; and lineman John Carlson.
Kmetovic will move up Gleen
Myers who played on the varsity
last year and has been getting into
condition on the JV's since re
cuperating from a shoulder opera

tion.
THE UNIVERSITIES Club
squad will have its ablest per
formers in action and would like
nothing belter than to act the
spoiler and send ihe high-riding
Indians inlo the defeated ranks.
Last year, Stanford easily out
classed the Berkeley squad in its
first meeting; but found the going
rougher in the rematch and lost
its only game of the season.
Standout performers for the
visitors will include three former
Stanford greats. Battling Ron
Fraboni for the ball in the scrum
will be hooker Kyrk Reid, who
played for Stanford for three
years. Because of his kicking abil
ities, he poses a threat that Stan
ford cannot match.
Ex-Stanford football and rugby
stars occupy two key positions in
the Berkeley club backfield. A
former rugby captain at the
Farm, Tom McManus plays Ist %
and Rick McMillin, who starred in
the victory against the Stanford
JV's last week, plays 2nd %.
THE BEST player on the team
is John Harrison, a seasoned vet
eran from Down Under who plays
in the back row of the scrum, i
Like Stanford's Gordon Waddell,
he is adept at pulling off unex
pected plays that catch opposing
forces off guard and that ultim
ately lead to a long gain or score.
Coach Kmetovic said that he is
especially good with his feet and
is a long, but erratic, kicker.

forces off guard and that ultim
ately lead to a long gain or score.
Coach Kmetovic said that he is
especially good with his feet and
is a long, but erratic, kicker.
The Stanford rugby squad,
whose scoring becomes more prol
ific every week, takes on a Uni
versities squad from Berkeley
which has posted two victories
against one defeat so far this
season.
Its victories were at the expense
of the Olympic Club and Stan
ford's first JV squad while the
Peninsula Ramblers handed it the
blemish on its record.
THE STANFORD attack, if
point outputs are any indication,
has seen significant improvements
over the last three weeks. The

first game it scored 11 points.
The next week it increased this
figure by eight, and the next
week's tilt saw a further increase
also.
Three starters will miss the
coming contest because of Law
School exams. They include Clark
Weaver, a steady performer in
the backfield; Bob Burke, the
team's most accurate place-kick
er; and lineman John Carlson.
Kmetovic will move up Gleen
Myers who played on the varsity
last year and has been getting into
condition on the JV's since re
cuperating from a shoulder opera

tion.
THE UNIVERSITIES Club
squad will have its ablest per
formers in action and would like
nothing belter than to act the
spoiler and send ihe high-riding
Indians inlo the defeated ranks.
Last year, Stanford easily out
classed the Berkeley squad in its
first meeting; but found the going
rougher in the rematch and lost
its only game of the season.
Standout performers for the
visitors will include three former
Stanford greats. Battling Ron
Fraboni for the ball in the scrum
will be hooker Kyrk Reid, who
played for Stanford for three
years. Because of his kicking abil
ities, he poses a threat that Stan
ford cannot match.
Ex-Stanford football and rugby
stars occupy two key positions in
the Berkeley club backfield. A
former rugby captain at the
Farm, Tom McManus plays Ist %
and Rick McMillin, who starred in
the victory against the Stanford
JV's last week, plays 2nd %.
THE BEST player on the team
is John Harrison, a seasoned vet
eran from Down Under who plays
in the back row of the scrum, i
Like Stanford's Gordon Waddell,
he is adept at pulling off unex
pected plays that catch opposing
forces off guard and that ultim
ately lead to a long gain or score.
