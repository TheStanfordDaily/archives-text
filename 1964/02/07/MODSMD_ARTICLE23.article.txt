# Have You Experienced the New Birth?
## 
### 
Do you believe that God is just a philosophical concept, an
abstract life force, or a remote old man in the sky? If so, then
there is good news! A personal God does exist, and Ho has a
real interest in you. Christians are born, they are not made.
Christian life always begins with the new birth, which is an
instantaneous, miraculous act of God whereby an individual is
given a new nature the nature of Christ Himself. "And Jesus
said, Do not marvel that I said to you, you must be born anew!
The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it,
but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes; so
it is everyone born of the Spirit." (John 3:7, 8h
God will impart this new life to any individual who believes
in, accepts, and trusts Jesus Christ as personal Saviour.
"... As many as received him. to them gave he power to
become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor
of the will of man, but of God." John 1:12, 13.
The new birth is entirely a gift of God. It cannot be earned,
but must be asked for in order to be received. If today you would
like to discover the reality of God, it is only necessary that you
invite Jesus Christ into your life as Lord and Saviour. The mo
ment you humble yourself and sincerely ask Him to come in,
God will respond in an unmistakeable way. If you haven't tried
it. don't delay. Those who know Jesus personally have never
regretted this step of faith.
The two Christians who write these ads do so out of personal
interest in your welfare, not as part of the work of any church
or religious group. If you are not a Christian, we will bend over
backwards to tell you how to become one, and if you are a Chris
tian, we welcome the opportunity of helping you in your spirit
ual growth. In either case: to God bo the Glory! Box 11791. P.A.
