# Indians Hit Road Again; Face Cougars At Pullman
## 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
Stanford's varsity basketball
team hits the road again th is
weekend in quest of its tenth vic
tory of the season and first in
the last six tries. The opposition
this time will he provided hy a
hand of Cougars in the backwoods
town of Pullman, Washington.
Washington State, a newcomer
in the Big Six this year, sports
a poor 1-5 mark in conference.
Most of their games, however,
have been played on the road,
where anyone gives away quite a
bit.
I,AST YEAR, before their ad
mittance to the AAWU, Washing
ton State was victimized hy
enough opponents to make its
record a quite dismal 5-20. And
this against teams from places
like Idaho, Montana State, Gon
zaga and Long Beach State.
But don't let this record of last
year deceive you, dear fans. Two
weeks ago, before its semester
work, Washington State was good
enough to manhandle the same
Oregon team that beat Cal twice
last weekend.
Forward Byron Vadset, the
Cougar captain, was instrumental

in that victory on Ihe Duck's home
floor. Vadset held Oregon s I a r
Steve Jones to a mere 13 points,
10 less than his average. At 64,
the Cougar captain will ho as
signed to guard Stanford back
court man Mollis Moore.
BUT THE BIG problem for In
dian coach Howie Dallmar will be
what to do with Marv Harsch
man's big junior center, Ted Wer
ner, the leading rebounder in the
conference and on the Coast.
Dallmar is handicapped because
of the injury to Ihe knee of his
own 6-8 star, Tom Dose. Dose is
still limited in his mobility by the
knee injury lie suffered at South
ern Methodist over the holidays.
The injury has kept big Tom from
practicing more than one day a
week.
The problem will arise if Cougar
coach Harschmann sets Werner
as a high post man at the top of
the key. If Werner tries to move
from that position, chances are
he would be able to drive quite
effectively on the slowed-down
Dose. But since no one else he has
is really big enough to handle
Werner, Dallmar may be forced
to take his chances with Dose.
EVEN THOUGH they do have
a 4-13 overall record this season,
WSU's big Cougars may be tough
to handle. After all, they beat
Regis College 59-48, and only lost
by 44 to UCLA.
It: would seem that Stanford
should have a rather easy time of
it this weekend, but what with
Dose's injury and the home-court
advantage plus the fact that the
Cards won't have their usual
height advantage, Don Klein may
have two interesting games to de
scribe at 8 p.m. both nights on
KCBS.
