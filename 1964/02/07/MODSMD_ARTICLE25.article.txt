## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's gymnasts, with an
unblemished 4-0 record, will put
their undefeated season on the
block when they meet, tho Spar
tans of San Jose State this week
end. The contest will be held in
the Pavilion, 7:30 p.m. Friday.
San Jose should be one of the
toughest meets on the Indian
slate. As an added incentive the
Spartans will be out to avenge
an early season loss to the Tribe.
In that exciting meet Stanford
squeaked past San Jose for their

first ever victory over them.
The contest was decided in the
last event as Stanford won by
.05. Roger lihoads was the lead
ing scorer of the meet and lie will
have to come through again for
another win.
Rhoads is also the leading scor
er thus far. having scored ."59
points in Stanford's three week
end vietoiies. Other outstanding
individuals are Russ Bermestei
who consistently wins the still
rings and horizontal bar with
good scores, and A 1 Miyamoto a
high scorer in the side horse.
