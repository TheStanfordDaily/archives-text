# ACCENT ON SPORTS
## Indian Football Once Dropped For Rugby 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Rugby is a thriving sport at Stanford nowadays. Upwards of
eighty students take part in Coach Pete Kmetovic's program. This I
number is the greatest turnout for any Stanford sport with thej
possible exception of football. At Saturday games, spectators fill
the stands and line both sidelines and enjoy the proceedings on the
field as much or more than the participants.
Few realize that rugby, although relegated to the role of a "mi
nor" sport today, as had a long and glorious history at Stanford.
Stanford was the first American college to adopt rugby as a recog
nized spoil.
RUGBY REIGNS SUPREME
When it arrived at the Farm, it was with a bang. It was not
to be a supplement to the existing athletic program but a replace
ment for football. Between the years of 1906 and 1917, rugby reigned
supreme on the Stanford campus.
At the turn of the century, football was a brutal and compara
tively dull game characterized by mass formations such as the flying[
wedge and yard by yard movements up and down the field. Presi
dents Jordan of Stanford and Wheeler of Cal decided that a change
was necessary. A faculty report of 1905 states: "It is idle to expect
that any change short of abolishment will meet all the criticism
ignorant and expert which has been directed against the game
during the past decade."
On February 11 of that year, a touring New Zealand rugby team
played a British Columbia opponent at Stanford. The game favor
ably impressed Dr. Frank Angell, head of the investigating com
mittee. "From a spectator's standpoint, the game was exceedingly
interesting and exciting."
Rugby officially replaced football on March 22. 1906 when a
report appeared in the Stanford newspaper. "Be it resolved: that we
recommend to the conference that the game of Rugby shall be sub
stituted for the present game of football until such time as a satis
factory national game shall be developed."
RUGBY GAINS SUPPORT AS TOP SPORT
James Lannagan, who compiled a 8-0 record the previous year
as head football coach, agreed to be head rugby coach although he
had never seen it played before or had any knowledge of the game.
Students were understandably disappointed at the disappearance
of football, but the rugby team found immediate and strong sup
port because of the game's color and excitement even though the
skill of the players was well below that of present day Stanford
ruggers.
The Quad reports the following: "Although Rugby had been ac
cepted somewhat sullenly at first on the part of the students, by the
end of the season, enthusiasm had risen to such a point that the
greatest rally in Stanford history preceded the varsity game." A
columnist on Stanford's newspaper wrote at the close of the season
that "No Stanford squad has even had better support than the
ruby team this year."
RUGGERS WIN BIG GAME
Coach Lannagan, despite the obstacles, coached his squad to a
creditable record during 1906 and upset Cal 6-3 to finish the season.
A direct result of the agreement between Stanford and Cal to
compete in rugby was the introduction of the sport into Northern
California high schools.
About 1913, one of the world's best rugby teams, the New Zea
land All-Blacks toured America and played several games in the
Stanford area. Fortunately for the cause of Stanford rugby, two of
the team's top players, Jim Wylie and Danny Carroll, decided to
enroll at Stanford. With them as sparkplugs, Stanford rugby in
the next two years notched twenty victories without a loss.
CAL LOSES AGAIN
At the end of the 1914 season, California lost 26-8 in the Big Game
and decided that its rugby relationship with Stanford was an un
healthy one. Therefore, it ungraciously terminated it and switched
back to football.
The popularity of rugby spread from Stanford as a center. The
University of Southern California, Santa Clara, and U. of Nevada all

adopted the sport and along with
Cal competed annually with the
Indians.
In 1920 and 1924. Rugby was an
Olympic sport; and in those years
the U.S. won two gold medals.
The players on the world's best
amateur rugby team came almost
exclusively from Northern Cali
fornia. and many, among them
Dink Templeton and Dick Hyland,
had gained their experience at
Stanford.
The First World War inter
rupted Stanford athletics in the
years 1917-1919. After the war,
Stanford would decide to rein
state football. The first phase of
Stanford rugby was over, but in
terest in the game after such an
auspicious beginning could not
keep the game away from Stan
ford for long. The excitement of
rugby, its pageanty had started
a tradition.
