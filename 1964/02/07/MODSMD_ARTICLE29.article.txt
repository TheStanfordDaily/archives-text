# Why Not A Noon-Time Hyde Park At Stanford?
## Editorial 
### 
Spring quarter, student body elections
and national Presidential primaries.
All of these rapidly approaching events
coincide nicely with a project thought up by
junior Gary Messinger, lIR conference vice
president. Messinger would like to see the
creation of a Hyde Park-in-Miniature on the
west side of Tresidder.
He explains:
"At 12 noon on several days of the week,
for 15 to 30 minutes, the Bowman House
side of TMU would become a public plat
form. On certain days student groups such

as Poli Union and lIR would sponsor speak
ers from off-campus organizations. The rest
of the time the platform would be open to
any member of the Stanford community
wishing to express an opinion on any issue.''
We think it is an excellent idea.
But we don't want to see the project be
come a mere soapbox for crackpots—although
it wouldn't hurt to have a few speaking. We
hope the profound will offset the ridiculous,
and that the speeches, although provocative,
will also be informative.
Messinger recommends that an organiza

tion he set up to supervise the projeet. We
will have to have money to send out letters
asking people to speak and money for publi
eity," he points out. "This ean't be a fly-by
night type of thing. It has to be done in the
right way and by dedicated students."
If enough support can be mustered for
the idea—and we invite students to discuss
it in our letters column—Messinger says he

would like to see the organization set up by
February 23.
We see one possible obstacle barring a
successful Hyde Park-In-Miniature. And
that's apathy. More than one faculty mem
ber has called the Stanford student "too well
rounded"—and has reminded us that the
most well-rounded thing is a zero.
Hut we are encouraged by the political
awareness indicated recently by widespread
student participation in such activities as IIH,
Poli Union, Stanford in Washington, Stan
lord in Ilong Kong and the Peace Corps.

Stanford needs a tradition of public* stu
dent dialectic. The Student Congress lias
been a step in this direction, but we think a
Hyde Park-In-Miniature would he an in
valuable addition.
Stanford students are encouraged to hone
their in-class ideas by out-of-class discus
sion. But rarely does such discussion go be
yond the confines of the living groups.
C ran ted, the student body has proven ilsell
intelligent.
But can it also prove itself publiclx arse
nate?

Stanford needs a tradition of public* stu

been a step in this direction, but we think a
Hyde Park-In-Miniature would he an in
valuable addition.
Stanford students are encouraged to hone
their in-class ideas by out-of-class discus
sion. But rarely does such discussion go be
yond the confines of the living groups.
C ran ted, the student body has proven ilsell
intelligent.
But can it also prove itself publiclx arse

Spring quarter, student body elections
and national Presidential primaries.
All of these rapidly approaching events
coincide nicely with a project thought up by
junior Gary Messinger, lIR conference vice
president. Messinger would like to see the
creation of a Hyde Park-in-Miniature on the
west side of Tresidder.
He explains:
"At 12 noon on several days of the week,
for 15 to 30 minutes, the Bowman House
side of TMU would become a public plat
form. On certain days student groups such

as Poli Union and lIR would sponsor speak
ers from off-campus organizations. The rest
of the time the platform would be open to
any member of the Stanford community
wishing to express an opinion on any issue.''
We think it is an excellent idea.
But we don't want to see the project be
come a mere soapbox for crackpots—although
it wouldn't hurt to have a few speaking. We
hope the profound will offset the ridiculous,
and that the speeches, although provocative,
will also be informative.
Messinger recommends that an organiza

tion he set up to supervise the projeet. We
will have to have money to send out letters
asking people to speak and money for publi
eity," he points out. "This ean't be a fly-by
night type of thing. It has to be done in the
right way and by dedicated students."
If enough support can be mustered for
the idea—and we invite students to discuss
it in our letters column—Messinger says he

would like to see the organization set up by
February 23.
We see one possible obstacle barring a
successful Hyde Park-In-Miniature. And
that's apathy. More than one faculty mem
ber has called the Stanford student "too well
rounded"—and has reminded us that the
most well-rounded thing is a zero.
Hut we are encouraged by the political
awareness indicated recently by widespread
student participation in such activities as IIH,
Poli Union, Stanford in Washington, Stan
lord in Ilong Kong and the Peace Corps.
