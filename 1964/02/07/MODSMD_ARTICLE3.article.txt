# Student Tutors Substitute Classroom For Pickets

"Not everyone likes to demon
strate or march on a picket line.
This is something else they can
do."
The words are those of Stan
Shaw, chairman of the Student-
Help Project at Queens College,
but his sentiment is echoed in the
actions of students at Harvard,
Miles and other universities as
well as at Stanford. College stu
dents are attacking the civil
rights problem with tutoring pro
grams in Negro areas.
Two hundred and twenty stu
dents at Queens College are tutor
ing more than a thousand educa
tionally deprived children in the
New York City area. Working
with school officials, the Student-
Help Project has organized classes
of four or five students to a tu
tor. Students are grouped accord
ing to subject and level in school.
The current program is an ex

pansion of a tutoring project be
gun by IT Queens students last
sum m e r in Prince Edward
County, Virginia. They provided
schooling to 1,500 Negro students
who had been deprived of an edu
cation because of the closing of
public school in the integration
struggle. Over $10,000 has been
raised to continue the Prince Ed
ward project as well as tutoring
programs in New York.
Twenty students from Harvard
and Miles College plan a similar
tutoring project in Birmingham,
Alabama, this summer. The proj
ect. timed at Negro areas of the
city, will provide verbal skill to
200 fourth-graders. John Clifton,
organizer of the Birmingham
Volunteer Teaching Project and
a Harvard graduate, has called
the program an "alternative to
demonstrations and a progres
sive achievement that can't be
lost." Clifton expects no resist
ance from the white community.
The Harvard and Miles volun
teers are asked to pay their own
living expenses. The cost for
teaching materials are being pro
vided by grants from several
foundations.
Last fall Stanford students be
gan their own project in East
Palo Alto. Students are tutoring
various subjects as well as act
ing as proctors for study halls.
Many of the Stanford students
involved in the project are consid
ering teaching majors. The proj
ect is viewed as a concrete way of
expressing commitment to th e
civil rights cause.
