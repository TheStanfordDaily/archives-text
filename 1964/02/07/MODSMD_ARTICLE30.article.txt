## Fellini's ‘8½,’ Kazan’s ‘America’ Picked Best Films Of 1963 
### Foster Hirsch 
The following movies are, in the opinion ol Daily Drama Edi
tor Foster Jlirsch, the best of 1963.
1. Fellini's "8/2" goes beyond the eineina as it explores, with
a striking subjectivity, a period of crisis in the life of a famous
lilm director in search of a theme. The presentation is at once
droll, profound, and surpassingly beautiful. With his customary
finesse, Fellini has drawn from a large cast performances cf re
markable subtlety.
2. "America, America recounts in scenes ol breathtaking pic
torial splendors the rites of passage of an impoverished Greek
youth from his native Turkey to America, the land of his hope.
Flia Kazan has written a sincere and moving script and his direc-j
lion ol a cast ol unknown players is inspired. The film, the first,
ol a trilogy which Kazan will superintend, could well be a new j
dawn for the American cinema.
.'3. Director Tony Richardson and Screenwriter John Osborne,
with a sure sense ol their medium, rework Ilenry Fielding s me-1
andering Tom Jones into a raucous, flamboyant, robust film that
never for a moment lets its audience forget that it is indeed a film
which they are watching. Spectacular devices are used for cut
ting from one scene to another, and the nervous, constantly mov
ing hand-held camera creates a feeling of participation in the
mail goings-on. Miraculously , Fielding's social satire is preserved
amidst all the technical flourish.
4. Peter Brook has taken William Golding's allegory of the
J.ord of the Flics and transformed it into an undcrkcyed, imagina
tively photographed, vigorously edited account of some naughty
English schoolboy s let loose on an isolated island.
5. In the Polish film, "Knife in the Water, ' an aging, athletic J
husband engages in a continuous and subtle battle with a brash
young hitchhiker to prove his masculinity to a passive wife. The
dialogue and the photography are rich in symbolic implications.
Roman Polanski's precise direction, an amalgamation of Berg
man and Antonioni, plainly marks him as a man to be watched.
6. Franz Kafka's Trial, an allegory of a man accused of an
unspecified crime, becomes on the screen a decidedly Wellesian
rather than Kafkaesquc nightmare.
7. As it tells the story of an aging aristocrat whose graceful
way of life has become an anachronism in a new India, "The
Music Room ' adheres faithfully to director Satyajit Ray s fault-j
less technique: stately pace, simplicity of plot, photography which j
reveals a splendid spatial sense, enriching music, and the warmth
of a universal humanity.
8. "Two Daughters," another immaculate contribution from
Satyajit Ray, is composed of two episodes based on stories by
Rabindranath Tagore. With minor changes in script, both stories
might well have taken place in the bayous of Louisiana.
9. "W inter Light." Ingmar Bergman's continuing investigation |
ol modern mans relationship to God, is as spare and austere as
a monk's cell as it records the affect upon a simple farmer and
a devoted spinster of a priest w ho has lost his faith.
10. "Cleopatra" is a consistently entertaining and reasonably j
civilized evening in the company of Elizabeth Taylor and friends. '
