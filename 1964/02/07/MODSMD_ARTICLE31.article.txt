Orderly demonstration against a disliked point of view is not
only legitimate, it is often an effective method of calling atten
tion to the contrary view.
In the case of the Ad Hoc Unman Rights Committee it cer
tainly should be said it has a right to demonstrate against Gov.
George Wallace and his point of view. Picketing, card distribut
ing and letter writing are orderly methods of protest and will
call statewide attention, perhaps nationwide attention, to the
concern of University students for civil rights.
Wallace, however, has the right to be heard, and any action
taken dining or before his talk to prevent the audience from
clearly hearing or understanding him is a violation of his civil
rights. Such action would also give Wallace and University de
tractors fuel for a charge University students do not really believe
in civil rights and freedom of expression for everyone—just for
those with whom they agree.
There!ore, the plan of the Projective Employment Protect
group to walk out of the Wallace talk is a bad judgment. Mass
walk-out, especially by educated adults, is rude, childish and
eertainh not orderly demonstration
