# Pickets: Attention Paid To Attire, Not Ideas
## The
						Mailbox 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Robert H. Smith ex
presses the notion thai pickets
engage in an ineffective, and
ridiculous form of social ex
pression. In calling attention
to the beards and dress of the
"Ban the Bombers," he reveals
himself a man more concerned
with attire than ideas. One
could scarcely expect such an
individual to be cognizant of
the fact that such demonstra
tors, by their involvement in
such issues as segregation, the
un-American activities of the
Un-American Activities Com
mittee, etc., have created an at
mosphere in this country such
that any sensitive or thought
ful person must find it impos
sible to remain complacent or
uncommitted. . . .
... It is my opinion that the
biologist, properly oiiented, is
in a unique position to view
Man in his relation to his en
vironment and evolution. If the
biologist is to make a mean
ingful contribution to his cul
ture through his research ef
forts, it will be toward the for
mulation of a philosophical
context within which our rap
idly evolving society can func
tion. It is only in this way
that we can hope to understand
and cope with our burgeoning
social pathologies. If the sci
entist's previously instilled
prejudices block his integration
of information from the var
ious academic disciplines, he
becomes an obstacle to the re
sponsible involvement of the
academic community in cul
tural problems.
Each individual researcher
owes it to his own perspective
to attempt to integrate his data
into a philosophical continuity.
It is my opinion that he also
owes something to his culture.
If he abdicates this responsibil
ity to others, the hiatus be
tween the "two cultures" will
surely continue to grow at a
geometric rate.

• "Liberal"* Challenge
Editor, The Daily:
. . . (Stephen) Sheffler ("The
Liberal") avers that the urgent
international situation compels
the U.S. to recognize Red
China. He fails to specify that
the urging is being done by
beggar nations. He does not
know that to capitulate in this;
crisis is to load communist
guns for the next. He claims
that we can negotiate with a
block of nations whose leader
cried, "We will bury you!"
.... To "recognize" Red
China is to grant it the status
of an equal: to equate our suc
cessful capitalism with the
moribund Chinese communism
is to be "unrealistic" — to
equate America w i t h Red
China is to devalue our prin
ciples.
.... It is silly to emphasize
that Red China's existence is a
fact; by refusing to certify the
legitimacy of the regime, the
United States evidences, not
factual blindness, but moral
luci 'ify.
Displaying his typical non
think, Sheffler proposes that
because "French children have
come to replace fisticuffs with
words," the United States
should do likewise. If he wishes
to liken the world arena to a
children's playground, he
should remember that the com
munists play for keeps. In the
issue between American Indi

vidualism and Chinese Commu
nism, our alternative is: prep
aration for fisticuffs or hand
cuffs and chains.

• All-American Dose
To The Editor:
A recent Daily contained a
letter by one Mr. Cullinan,
questioning ihe status of Tom
Dose as an authentic All-Amer
ican basketball player.
In simple point of fact. Tom
was selected by the Helms
Athletic Foundation as an All-
American for the 1962-63 sea
son. He was one of 30 players
so honored, all of whom were
listed alphabetically without
graduation as to teams . . .
This, if nothing else, would con
fer on him the legitimate title
of "All-American."
Without meaning to be im
modest, I might add that I have
played against . . . All-Amer
ican |Walt Bellamy, Bill Mc-
Gill, and Mel Counts|, as well
as against Tom. In my opinion,
Tom is a much better all
around player than were either
Bellamy or McGill in college,
and is certainly the equal of
Counts. He's been one of the
league's leading scorers and re
bounders during all of his three
varsity years, and this would
certainly belie Mr. Callinan's
assertions (hat Tom can
neither "jump nor move with
co-ordination." Further, Tom
is an outstanding team player,
which Bellamy and McGill were
not.

Lastly, Mr. Cullman suggests
that he is being "lured" into
the Pavilion by false claims
about Tom. Might I offer my
services, Mr. Cullinan, to sell
for you your tickets to the
UCLA or Cal games this
month? If you'd like to stay
at home, I know over 1000
people who would gladly go
watch All-American Tom Dose.
Sincerely,
