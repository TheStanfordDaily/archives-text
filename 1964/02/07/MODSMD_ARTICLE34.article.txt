## Signor Danielo Dolci: Sicily's 'New Gandhi' 
### Vivian Bozman 
Ihe Stanford overseas campus is an American ghetto in inan\
ways, and, yet, its existence lias threat value i! onl\ for the single
fact that there is always the opportunity to step outside the
ghetto w alls to find a new and often strange world.
it was just such an experience that the overseas campuses pro
' gram provided for a Stanford in Italy group w hen the group took
j a field trip to Sicily and stopped at the verv poor village of Par
' tinieo just outside Palermo.
Less than a decade ago this village was the home of a power
ful hand of robbers, led by such men as Guiliano, a modern-dav
| Robin Hood who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor.
Guilianos dead now, his romantic legend completed when he was
| sold by one of his own men for gold and shot bv the police,
j There's a new man and a new legend growing in Partinieo now .
! I he man is Danilo Dolci, and, like Guiliano, lie is the friend of
| the poor. But that is w here the resemblance ends, for Dolci's
method is non-violence and he gives, not money stolen from others,
but friendship, understanding, education, and coumiunitv serv ices.
Dolci's Center of Studies arid Action for Full Employment in
Partinieo is one of six such centers which he established in 1958.
Ihe center employs social workers, agricultural technicians,
teachers, doctors, and nurses, all of whom work in their respective
fields towards the goal of giving the people of Partinieo a higher
standard of living and a firm base of self-sufficiencv.

Called "a new Gandhi" by Aldous Huxley, Dolci, an architect
from northern Italy, came to the Sicilian village of Trappeto in
1952 with the conviction that the problems of poverty could never
be solved by working in isolation in selected communities, but
only by an attack on poverty's fundamental bases. Relieving also
that his own life could not be isolated from that of the villagers,
Dolci lived and worked for three years with the people of Trap
peto as a farmhand and fisherman.
In Dolci's first year in Trappeto the villagers were approach
ing destitution, lor pirate fishing by outsiders in motor boats was
depriving the fishermen of their livelihood. In December, 1952,
after the death by starvation of a small child, Dolci commenced
a hunger strike to protest against and draw attention to the suf
fering in Trappeto. Civil authorities forced Dolci to stop his
strike on the eighth day, and, although pirate fishing actually did
cease for several months, it was soon resumed.
Dolci had been settled in his new center in the Spine Santc
(Holy Thorns) quarter of Partinieo little more than a year when
the very hard winter of 1956 brought mass unemployment, be
cause of the great hardships, caused by the lack of jobs, Dolci
announced his intention of instigating a mass fast to emphasize
the purity of the protestors' motives, and to follow this with a
"strike in reverse," claiming the right to work under Article IV of
the Italian Constitution. He emphasized that the work was to
| be undertaken as a free service to the community as w ell as a
' protest.

On Jan. .'3O, 1956, Dolci and about 1,000 unemployed workers
lasted for 24 hours. On February 2 he and some 250 unemployed
men went out, in small groups in order not to break the law, to
repair a neglected road. The key word for the workers was non
violence; the men even left behind the penknives tlirv usualh
carried to cut bread.
The police arrived soon after the workers and commanded
them to stop repairing the road. Despite provocative action by
i the police, there was no violence. Dolci and six of the other local
leaders were arrested and imprisoned. After two years ol appeals
and counter appeals, Dolci was sentenced to eight months im
prisonment for his leadership in the strike in reverse. He was
given an amnesty, but the sentence was never repealed, and the
police still have the power to enforce it il they so choose.
Perhaps, the most fascinating thing about Danilo Dolci is his
importation of the creed of non-violence to Sicily, the land of
the vendetta where the gleainingsteel of the knife symbolizes the
way to defend familial and masculine pride and honor. For Dolci
the concept of peace is not an abstraction, but an all-pervading
way of life, and il is the union of this man of non-violence in a
community of friendship and mutual respect with men who onc<
knew only violence as a way of life that inspires great faith—
fiiitli not based on visions without foundation, but based on ac
tual happenings in a Sicilian village—in the abilitv ol non-violence
as both a means and an end to forge new paths toward a more
just and humane world.
Professor Laurie Tarshis is leading an MR hostel tomorrow
'on the work of Danilo Dolci in Partinieo.
