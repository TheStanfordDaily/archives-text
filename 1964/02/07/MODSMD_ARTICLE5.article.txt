# Famed Rector Here Sunday
## 
### 
Canon Bryan Green, well known
British clergyman, will preach at
the 11 a.m. service this Sunday
at Memorial Church.
Canon Green, the Rector of
Birmingham, England, and for
mer Chaplain at Oxford Univer
sity, drew crowds totaling 15,000
in four days of lectures on "Basic
Christianity" at Stanford two
years ago. He has been described
in articles as "one of the best
preachers in the English-speaking
world," and usually is booked up
two to three years in advance.
THE STORIES about Canon
Green are legend. One concerns
the time the administration of a
prominent Eastern women's col
lege barred him from speaking on
the campus because he was "too
controversial." He pro m p t I y
rented the movie theater in a
nearby town, and almost the
whole student body flocked out
to hear him.
Another concerns the time he
told the congregation of a wealhty
Boston Episcopal Church on e
that he considered to bo quite
hypocritical "I think that Christ
should hate tobe in this church."
Canon Green is the author of
seevral widely-heralded books, in
cluding Christians Alive. He has
been invited to preach in over
a dozen countries.
HE O.N( 10 converted the presi
dent of The League of Athiests at
Columbia University. "It was
quite disconcerting to the League
of Atheists," said Canon Green.
"They had to find a new presi
dent."
Known for his dry British wit
and incisive mind, his main tar
get has been what he describes
as "The sincere, questioning skep
tics. I think it's important to talk
to those who want to find a faith,
tint don't want to leave their in
tellects behind.''
