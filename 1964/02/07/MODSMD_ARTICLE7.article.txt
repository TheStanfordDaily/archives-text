# PROJECT L-O-V-E
## Peaceful Indians Invade Stanford 
### JIM SELNA 
At high noon yesterday a party of 17 Piute and Shoshone Indians
set foot on the Quad. Fortunately their mission was peaceful:
Project LOVE.
The Indians, all students between 10 and 17. are from the Duck
Valley Reservation in northern Nevada. They are touring the Bay

Area with the help of Project
Light on Varied Education. The
project is the idea of Donna
Smith, a 17-year-old high school
senior from Fremont, California.
Miss Smith, whose father is a
government surveyor, spent last
summer on the reservation and
got to know the children quite
well. To stir educational interest

♦
and widen the horizons of the In
dian students, she decided to or
ganize the trip.
The children dispersed to a
number of university residences
for lunch. Martin Gibbson hosted
ja group at the Theta Chi House,
while Kathy Molohon hosted the
'rest of the party at the Union
residence. After . lunch th e y
toured the campus. The sight of
a small war party walking around
the Quad caused quite a few
stares, but the children thor
oughly enjoyed themselves.
TIIK GROUP was particularly
[impressed with Memorial Church
j where they were personally
i greeted by Chaplain Minto. Hoov-
I er Tower caught the fancy of the
j younger boys as an excellent look
out point.
Miss Smith told Hie Daily that
Project LOVE had a two-fold pur
pose. Few of the children go on
1 to college, or even consider fur
ther education after high school,
i Though there is a high school on
j the reservation, the curriculum is
I not broad and provides few op
! portunities for creative students.
THE GOAL of the trip is to
encourage more children to con
sider higher education and to en
courage the children to get more
out of their schooling on the res
ervation by expanding their field
I of experience.
Miss Smith raised the funds
I for the trip through the help of
the Oakland Tribune and private
'contributions. The party arrived
in Oakland yesterday and plans
to spend the rest of the week in
the area before returning to Ne
vada. Last night the United Bay
Area Council of Indians staged
a pow-wow in the Oakland Audi
torium. Miss Smith was made an
honorary princess of the council
and the Indian children were
'honored with ceremonial dances.
