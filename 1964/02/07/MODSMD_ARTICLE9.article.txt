# Road Route Opposed By University
## Would Destroy Radio Installation 
### 
Plans for an Alpine Road align
ment for the proposed Willow
Freeway were opposed yesterday
by Stanford at a meeting of the
State Department of Highways.
Representing the University was
Alt' E. Bradin, Vice President of
the University.
THE REASON for the Uni
versity's opposition is the serious
effect such a highway would have
on the radio installation near
the existing Alpine Road.
According to Brandin, the Uni
versity's "role in radio and radar
astronomy would be drastically
reduced if not eliminated entirely"
by the Alpine Road highway. He
said such an alignment would
"immediately destroy" Stanford's
Heliopolis, a 32-dish solar radio
telescope installation used to pro
vide weather data to the Federal
Bureau of Standards.
THERE ARE several other in
stallations on the Stanford 2,000-
aere "antenna farm" which would
also be "crippled or destroyed by
the proximity of the freeway,"
mainly because of interference
generated by expected high
volume auto traffic.
Two alignments for the new
freeway have been offered by the
Highway Department. The alter
nate route would generally fol
low Sand Hill road. The Palo Alio
City Council, however, has fa
vored the Alpine route on the ba
sis tht it would provide access to
the city's still undeveloped l'oot-
I hills.
The Willow Freeway is a pro
! posed freeway planned to connect
Junipero Serra and Skyline boule
vards.
Hearings on the proposed road
I were held at VVoodside School.
The final decision regarding the
route should be announced in the
[ near future.
