## 
### 
The School Mathematics Study
Group (SMCG) opened a summer
Institute at the National Univer

sity of Engineering in Lima, Peru
this week. The institute, which is
to last six weeks, will instruct
120 teachers from nearly every
Latin American country in the
use of SMSG's "new mathemat
ics."
Besides the Lima institute,
SMSG is also working at the uni
versities of Costa Rica, Guate
mala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and
Salvador. The objeteive is to de
velop a uniform mathematics
teaching program for future
teachers as well as for physicians,
engineers, and scientists.
SMSG texts have been trans
lated into Spanish.
Established at Stanford in 1961
under Professor Edward G. Begle,
the program has produced more
than 70 texts for elementary and
high schools. The texts are de
signed to do away with dull exer
cises and teach mathematics fun
damentals in a way that attracts
and holds student interest.
