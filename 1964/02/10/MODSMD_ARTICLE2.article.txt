# Hyde Park Idea Aired
## 
### JIM SELNA 
Campus reaction to a mina
ture Hyde Park has ranged
from praise to cynicism.
The Hyde Park in Minia
ture is the proposal of junior
Gerry Messenger. At noon
each day there would be an
open forum in the plaza in
front of Tresidder Union. The
experiment, patterned after
its English namesake, would
allow any member of the uni
versity community to express
his poiniou on any subject.
In a random poll taken yes
terday, students in various
university residences were
asked their opinion of the
open forum proposal pre
sented in Friday's Daily. The
typical r e a c t i o u was ex
pressed by Fred Hawley. a
Stern resident, who said "The
Hyde Park would provide an
excellent means of expression
of issues on the campus."
Hawley further stated that
the forum should be open to
all speakers "in as much as
they are qualified."
In also praising the idea,
Haskell Rosenthal, a grad
uate student in mathematics,
said that it would be less for
mal and give the students
more freedom in expressing
there opinion "without a lot
of red tape."
TIIF DAILY also found
those who had their doubts
about the project. Andy
Muchmoore, a Wilbur fresh
man, felt that "there are
enough nuts in this univer
sity w i th o u t encouraging
them." He feared that the
area around Tresidder might
be transformed into Los An
geles' Pershing Square, long
notorious for its crackpots.
Few students woli were in

terviewed believed that fringe
groups could destroy the for
um, and some even welcomed
the so-called crackpots. Herb
Sloane, a liberal art major
from Michigan said, "For the
last 20 years the 'reasonable'
people have been riming the
world. The forum will be a
great success if it can get
people to think."
The problem of controlling'
the forum without stifling it
was voiced by Rob Steffey, a
switchboard op erato r for
Toyon Hall. He saw no way
to prevent the program from
being dominated entirely by
either liberal or conservative
factious. Although lie did ad
mit that this would not be a
problem once the forum Iw
canie established.
The Hyde Park would be
an excellent way to stir stu
dent apathy, according to
Lawrence Sweeny of the
Tlieta Delta Chi House. He
said the students need place
where "they can say what
they think." He also ex
pressed the possibility of hav
ing fraternities sponsor var
ious speakers.
..Jerry Johnson, a graduate
philosophy stud en t from
Macon Georgia, dissented
from the proposal on esthetic
grounds. He told the Daily
that the humdrum caused by
the forum would "destroy the
pleasant, quite and restful
spirit that prevails around
the plaza."
The majority of students
questioned were strongly in
favor of the immature Hyde
Park. Almost all students
agreed that they would be
willing to speak before the
form if they had a "burning
opinion."

they are qualified."
In also praising the idea,
Haskell Rosenthal, a grad
uate student in mathematics,
said that it would be less for
mal and give the students
more freedom in expressing
there opinion "without a lot
of red tape."
TIIF DAILY also found
those who had their doubts
about the project. Andy
Muchmoore, a Wilbur fresh
man, felt that "there are
enough nuts in this univer
sity w i th o u t encouraging
them." He feared that the
area around Tresidder might
be transformed into Los An
geles' Pershing Square, long
notorious for its crackpots.
Few students woli were in

terviewed believed that fringe
groups could destroy the for
um, and some even welcomed
the so-called crackpots. Herb
Sloane, a liberal art major
from Michigan said, "For the
last 20 years the 'reasonable'
people have been riming the
world. The forum will be a
great success if it can get
people to think."
The problem of controlling'
the forum without stifling it
was voiced by Rob Steffey, a
switchboard op erato r for
Toyon Hall. He saw no way
to prevent the program from
being dominated entirely by
either liberal or conservative
factious. Although lie did ad
mit that this would not be a
problem once the forum Iw
canie established.
The Hyde Park would be
an excellent way to stir stu
dent apathy, according to
Lawrence Sweeny of the
Tlieta Delta Chi House. He
said the students need place
where "they can say what
they think." He also ex
pressed the possibility of hav
ing fraternities sponsor var
ious speakers.
..Jerry Johnson, a graduate
philosophy stud en t from
Macon Georgia, dissented
from the proposal on esthetic
grounds. He told the Daily
that the humdrum caused by
the forum would "destroy the
pleasant, quite and restful
spirit that prevails around
the plaza."
The majority of students
questioned were strongly in
favor of the immature Hyde
Park. Almost all students
agreed that they would be
willing to speak before the
form if they had a "burning
opinion."
Campus reaction to a mina
ture Hyde Park has ranged
from praise to cynicism.
The Hyde Park in Minia
ture is the proposal of junior
Gerry Messenger. At noon
each day there would be an
open forum in the plaza in
front of Tresidder Union. The
experiment, patterned after
its English namesake, would
allow any member of the uni
versity community to express
his poiniou on any subject.
In a random poll taken yes
terday, students in various
university residences were
asked their opinion of the
open forum proposal pre
sented in Friday's Daily. The
typical r e a c t i o u was ex
pressed by Fred Hawley. a
Stern resident, who said "The
Hyde Park would provide an
excellent means of expression
of issues on the campus."
Hawley further stated that
the forum should be open to
all speakers "in as much as
they are qualified."
