# Poll Among UCLA Students Shows Liberal Sex, Mild Political Views
## 
### 
The attitude of a typical UCLA
student towards sex might shock
some typical elders, but the aver
age student was found to be a
political middle-of-the-roader and
a lukewarm supporter of selective
military service.
These views showed up in a
pole conducted by the journalism
graduates of UCLA. Two hundred
young men and coeds were ques
tioned on 27 various topics rang
ing from politics and world af
fairs to sex.
The findings were detailed in a
special edition of the California
Sun, published by the class as a
"laboratory newspaper."
THK INQUIRY into campus at
titudes on sex, summarized by Art
I Harger, disclosed that only 37.5'<
of those questioned felt that pre
marital relations are wrong. By
contrast, 63'/r disapproved of ex
tra-marital relations, hut 72'-
found no objection to divorce. The

practice of birth control was dis
approved by only 11.5'-, and only
20'< were opposed to abortion.
The inquiry showed also that
80'- were against student mar
riage on the ground that it inter
feres with concentration on stud
ies. But one male student was all
for it, because "it enables a girl
to support me through college. 1
can be married without the re
sponsibility of supporting a wife."
POLITICALLY, most of the stu
dents consider themselves moder
ates. They also seemed convinced
that their parents were either ex
tremely conservative or very lib
eral.
One interviewer confessed he
was taken aback by the reply of
a Negro student to the question,
"Politically, do you consider your
self a conservative or a liberal?"
"I'm neither liberal nor conserva
tive," the student replied. "I'm
black and that is the only classifi
cation that is meaningful." To the
companion question, "How do you

classify your parents?" he replied:
"Black."
ON Tin: QUESTION of the
draft, a highly personal one to
male students, only 25'.; of the
200 expressed opposition to selec
tive military service as it now
exists.
Walter Gardner, student edi
tor of the California Sun. summed
up: "What is most striking about
the current crop of collegiate is
the maturity they reveal â€” a neat
balance of idealism and realism.
"Whether the question deals
with the biggest problems facing
the nation today ,or with their rea
sons for going to college, student
responses reflect a quality of
though lacking in previous gen
erations."
