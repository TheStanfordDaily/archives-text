# HOT LINE TO THE SIDELINE
## Cal Amazes On Second Try 
### TOM ELIAS 
What a difference a day makes! That was (he refrain up at
Berkeley on Saturday night as UCLA's vaunted Bruins were pressed
right down to the wire by the hard-fighting Golden Bears of the
University of California.
All us "experts" had gone over to Berkeley on Friday night ex
pecting to see Cal put up a good light, but probably lose. Then, hav
ing overcome the obstacle of playing at Cal's Harmon Gym, UCLA
should go on to take the Saturday night game with no trouble at all.
But that wasn't the way it worked out. Charlie MeCabe, Bill
Turner and myself, among others, were shocked on Friday to see
the nationally top-ranked Bruins run out on the floor and run off
to a ten poinl halftime edge. After the intermission, UCLA coach
Johnny Wooden kept pouring it on and Walt Ila/./.arcl and Gail
Goodrich wound up with 21 and 2K points in the 87-(>7 romp
CAL C ONFOUNDS "KXPKRTS"
Having seen the Bruins and their red-hot rooters up from LA
for the weekend series toss the Cal fans' barbs right back in their
faces, all us experts expected anolher rout the next night, maybe
even worse.
But that was not to be the case. Where Cal's 6-11 center, Cam-

den Wall, had looked like the
biggest klutz on the Berkeley
campus on Friday, the next eve
ning ho was a world beater. Fri
day night, big Cam bagged 11
points and got not a single clean
rebound all night. Saturday was
a different story. Wall wrapped
UCLA center Fred Slaughter
around his little finger, dominat
ing board play and scoring 22
points, mostly on hooks and tip
ins.
On the defensive Cal back
boards, it was also a different
story Saturday. Where on Friday,
Keith Erickson and Jack Hirseh
had combined with Slaughter to
play volleyball on their offensive
backboard, taking shot after shot
until one finally went in, on Sat
urday, Hirsch quickly got into
foul trouble and Cam Wall re
fused to be screened out. There-

suit was that in most cases UCLA was only getting one try at the
score.
BEARS SLOW GAME DOWN
To come as close as they did to UCLA on Saturday, it was man
datory for the Bears to halt the Bruin fast break that had almost
driven them berserk the previous night. This is an extremely difficult
thing to do. UCLA has stayed unbeaten this season by forcing other
teams to play its game. On Friday, with UCLA in control of the
backboards, the Bruins were able to get the ball down to either
Hazzard or Goodrich in time for them to take advantage of either
a 3 on 2 or a 2 on 1 situation.
Saturday, though, Slaughter was not getting his share of the re
bounds and the break was not getting off the ground as a result.
Cal also forced UCLA to play its game on Saturday by effec
tively working the ball around on offense, taking plenty of time to
set up the good shot. A last minute failure of this strategy was
directly responsible lor the fact that Cal did lose at all.
PRESSURE PUT ON GOODRICH
Another factor in ihe poor UCLA showing was that Cal was
pressing Hazzard whenever he brought the ball up the court. This
meant that Goodrich was forced to bring the ball up the floor most
of the time. This was significant because Goodrich scores most of
his points on feeds from Hazzard. Forcing him to use his moves
with the ball, rather than without it, put a lot of pressure on him
and the Uclan attack falters when Goodrich has to play under pres
sure.
The series at Cal proved beyond the slightest doubt thai Walt
Hazzard is easily the best guard in college basketball today. Both on
Friday and Saturday nights, whenever Cal put the pressure on,
UCLA gave the ball to Walt. Four separate times on Saturday night,
in the Bruins' toughest game of the season, Hazzard made baskets
that put them in front. Whenever Cal tried a full-court press, it was
Walt who brought the ball upeourt without the slightest trouble.
Whenever a loose ball was rolling around the foor, ihere was Walt
to pick it up.
One other thing the series proved: UCLA can be beaten. But tlie
only way to do it is to catch the Bruins on an off night on your
i own home floor and make them play your game, not theirs. Stan
ford gets its chance in two weeks, but first there's a little thing
about two games this weekend with a valiant bunch of athletes with
big hearts called the California Golden Bears.
