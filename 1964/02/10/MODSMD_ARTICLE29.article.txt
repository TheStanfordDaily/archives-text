# SHOW BALANCED ATTACK
## Stanford Cagers Crush Cougars Twice 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
Tht'io was a study in oontrasts
up in Pullman, Washington this
j weekend, and both extremes be
longed to the hot-and-cold Cougars
j of Washington State University.
The order of the two teams
i playing and the shooting of the
[.Stanford five that provided WSU's
opposition were about the only
consistent things as the Indians

from the Farm whipped I heir
hosts by S(and 81-IS counts.
Washington State came about
as close to beating a good team
as it ever will on Friday night
while dropping an Sd-ti'.t decision.
The Cougars were red-hot from
the field, shooting an almost un
believable 72 per cent, while the
Tribe, not shooting badh cither,
rippled the nets at a fine ">.V -.
ANY TKA.M that shoots 72 per

| cent usually deserves (o win. Be
i cause of their rebounding superi
ority, I!.<» Indians were only out
scored hv three goals from I hp
! field.
Washington State fell down tor
! ribly ;it the free-throw line,
though, sinking only !* of 20 while
Stanford was making 2ti of 32
! charity tos-es. Big gun for the
; Cougars the first night was for
ward Byron Vadsel, who dumped
jin 31 points, all but three from
the field.
Stanford's attack the first
I night was featured by outstand
ing balance, as four starters fin
; ished in double figures. Tom Dose,
| despite an injury to his one good
j knee, managed to hag 22 points.;
BI T Till*; big gun for the Tribe j
I was soph forward Bob Bedell,
! whose 13 second half points put j
; Stanford out of reach after it had
I only led by one at the half. Bedell
totalled 19, Kent Hinckley fol-
I lowed with IT and Mollis Moore
! put in 13 points in the well-i
| rounded attack.
The second night was a totally
i different story .except for the:
Stanford attack. Washington State'
I was ice cold from the field, hit-,
i ting only 32 per cent, as Stanford,
fairly consistent, shot IT per cent/
Vadset was again the high scor-j
ior for WSU, but with only 9
I points. Dose again led the Stan
ford attack. Playing only about
; half the time .and wit h both knees
I bandaged, at that, big Tom
'dropped in 24 points.
111NC KLKV WAS next with 12
and Moore and sub Gary Love- j
ridge were next with ID each. All i
: twelve members of the Indian!
travelling squad saw action as I
the Cougars hit only 4 of 32 j
attempts from the field in the
second half.
With the two wins over the!
| weekend, Stanford's record now
stands at 11-7 with seven games'
; left on the slate. Three games'
jwith Cal remain, along with one
: each against Washington. Wash-,
I ington State. Southern Cal and
