# Cal Poly, Referee Fail To Stop Tribe Matmen
## 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
Overcoming the sometimes
baffling decisions of a referee who
, looked as ai ease and self-assured
in a wrestling ring as Gamel Ab
i del Nasser in a kibbutz in Tel
I Aviv, and a near upset of star
heavyweight Don Buehler, the
Stanford wrestling team gained
a two-point, two second, 17-15 vie
j tory over Cal Poly of Pomona at
I Fnciiiri Gym Saturday.
Actually the referee wasn't a
great hazard, lie was influenced
I into changing calls equally by
! both benches.
IT Ml ST be said in his defense.
! however, that he maintained a
true university spirit throughout.
J believing obviously that a free
interplay of opposite ideas mid
wives the truth. Before and/or
ufter making a decisive call, he
' seemed to consult with both
I coaches, the scoring table, a few
bystanders, and not least of all
the rule book to maintain a proper
respect for his dialectic.
Although his presentation was
i as effective as a Dick Gregory
| monologue before the greater Bir
mingham White Citizens Council,
| it can be added that he at least
tried, and that he couldn't take
any luster off a fine performance
i by the injury-ridden Indians.
Stanford started off quickly in
the meet, picking up five fast
I poinls when George Musser, at
123 pounds, trapped Cal Poly's An
thony Chow in a cradle and pinned
him at 2:22.
AT TilIC 130 pound weight, the
Tribe made it two in a row for
j the day as Pat Ryan decisioned
j Poly's Bob Anderson 6-4, in an
act ion-filled match.
Cal Poly was not to be shut out |
however. Taking advantage of a :
couple of injuries which forced!
Indian grappler Tim Davis to;
Wrestle at 137 instead of his nor-J
' mal 130 weight, the Pomona mat

men's Bob Hatcher was able to
pin Davis, who didn't seem to
have the strength of his heavier
opponent, at 2:17.
The Cards dropped another at
147 as Jerry Smith was over
whelmed 14-2, and the meet points
were even at 8-8.
CO-C ATTAIN Phil Kendall then
halted the Tribe skid, and re
mained undefeated 1 his year, as
he completely dominated his 157
pound match against Larry Mil
ler. After many near pins, Miller
finallv succumbed to Kendall at
7:37.'
In the longest and most often
interrupted contest of the after
noon, Stanford's Steve Schaum
wrestled Cal Poly's Joe Campbell
to a 1-4 draw.
A nose injury sustained by
Campbell, allowing him three min
utes to recover, brought up sev
eral minor, confusing disputes
which the referee was able to
handle only alter frequent delib
erations with the scoring table and
both benches, and delayed tin 1
match for quite a while.
SCIIAITM Si:i >li:i> to be as
hurt by the layoff caused by the
several interruptions as his oppo
nent was by the injury itself, and
thus was never really able to get
a real offensive going.
At the 177 pound level muscu
lar Walter Shaw of Cal Poly out
pointed Tom Allen 1-1 in a close
match, and narrowed the Indian's
meet lead to 1.5-13.
In the exciting, meet-deciding
last match, Don Buehler gained
an escape in the last thirty sec
onds to pull within one point of
his adversary. The match ended
with no more points awarded, but
it was found that Buehler had had
(i2 seconds more riding time. So
that 2 seconds gave him a tie.
both teams four points, and Stan
ford a narrow 2 point victory.
