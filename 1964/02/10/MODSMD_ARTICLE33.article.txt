# The
						Administration Responds To A Student Need
## Editorial 
### 
The University will announce soon that
during dead week and finals week the li
brary will be kept open until 1 a.m. — a
necessary improvement as demonstrated by
student reaction when the Legislature pro
posed such a program last quarter and then
convinced the University of the need for it.
The money for the extended library oper
ation in the future will not come from the
limited resources of the Associated Students,
but rather from the University itself.

This extension of library hours — in
response to ASSU action — illustrates well
the need for student government. For some
time, students discussed, on an informal level,
the operation of the library, especially dur
ing dead week and finals week. The increase
in library hours helped satisfy a need for a
place to catch up on work, to review and to
get away from the distractions of the living
quarters.
Such discussion, being on an informal

level, probably did not come to the atten
tion of the University administration. The
discussion did not, however, go unnoticed
by the Legisilature. Being students, the
members were also affected by the demands
and limitations of dead week.
The result was a proposal from the Leg

islature for an extension of the library hours, t
but a proposal backed by a concrete pro- 1
gram. Money was appropriated and t h e c
package was presented to the University, i
Its acceptance was a matter of course.
Yet one fact must not be lost. The abil- i
ity of the University administration to re- 1
spond to the needs of the students is depend- t
cut 011 a knowledge of those needs. 1
No one knows the needs of students bet- t
ter than the students themselves. A faculty i

committee for the library can be of great
benefit and is useful in expressing faculty
opinion about library services. But the fac
ulty cannot speak for students.
Student government must do this and
must define the areas of student interest.
The hours of the library will be extended
thanks to the action by the Legislature. Other
positive changes also depend heavily on stu
dent initiative. And we hope such initiative
is not lacking.
