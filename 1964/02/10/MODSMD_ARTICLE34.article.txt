## William Scranton Offers Solutions On State Level 
### Stephen Shefler 
"Bill Scranton is in the race, and he is going to win, that is
the description given last week by Pennsylvania's Republican
Chairman concerning Governor William Scranton. Ever since
former President Eisenhower called Governor Scranton to his
Gettysburg farm last November and asked him to run for the
Grand Old Party's Presidential nomination, the Scranton band
wagon has been going strong.
The reason behind the Scranton bandwagon is that he is ott
ering the Republican Part) a positive plan of action, as opposed
to the negative approach oi Arizona's store bought cowboy, Barry
Goldwater. People are not use to telling you what Goldwater is
for, but what he is against.
The Goldwater approach is definitely not "me-too" imitation of
of the Democrats, a stand he accuses Republican opponents of
taking. It is simply "1 am against. . . ." Ho has stood against the
L .X., against Medicare, against the Test-Ban Treaty, against Fed
eral Aid to Education. William Scranton, on the other hand,
doesn't pretend the problems don't exist, but offers alternative
solutions to them on the state level. The Scranton philosophy may
be summarized: The Democrats say it is not being done on the
state level, so leave it to Washington. The better choice is not
to leave things to Washington but to change things and start
forward action again on the state level.

Bill Scranton has turned his philosophy into a practical legis
lative program, and his achievements are noteworthy. In his last
two years as Governor, he has balanced the state budget (Pennsyl
vania for years had large deficits), brought unemployment down
fro 9.4 perment to 5.2 percent, brought 700 new factories to the
state, placed 18,000 jobs under Civil Service, passed the first
teacher's raise in eight years, passed the highest subsidies for
school's raise in eight years, passed the highest measures—in
cluding aid to the aged. Newsweek lias estimated lie had had 90
percent success in his legislative efforts; this is an impressive show
ing for a freshman governor.
The upshot of all this is that Republicans see Governor Scran
ton as a candidate w hose accomplishments are substantial enough
to make many citizens think twice on that fateful Tuesday, this
coming November. As for Barry Goldwater, Republicans are be
ginning to ask: what has he proposed? What would he do il
elected? They find they know where Barry stands, against every
thing and for nothing.
All indications point out that William Scranton will be catch
ing ii]) and possibly passing Barry Goldwater in the race for popu
lar appeal in the interval — a decision of Americans who think
being negative is not enough.

state, placed 18,000 jobs under Civil Service, passed the first
teacher's raise in eight years, passed the highest subsidies for
school's raise in eight years, passed the highest measures—in
cluding aid to the aged. Newsweek lias estimated lie had had 90
percent success in his legislative efforts; this is an impressive show
ing for a freshman governor.
The upshot of all this is that Republicans see Governor Scran
ton as a candidate w hose accomplishments are substantial enough
to make many citizens think twice on that fateful Tuesday, this
coming November. As for Barry Goldwater, Republicans are be
ginning to ask: what has he proposed? What would he do il
elected? They find they know where Barry stands, against every
thing and for nothing.
All indications point out that William Scranton will be catch
ing ii]) and possibly passing Barry Goldwater in the race for popu
lar appeal in the interval — a decision of Americans who think
being negative is not enough.

"Bill Scranton is in the race, and he is going to win, that is
the description given last week by Pennsylvania's Republican
Chairman concerning Governor William Scranton. Ever since
former President Eisenhower called Governor Scranton to his
Gettysburg farm last November and asked him to run for the
Grand Old Party's Presidential nomination, the Scranton band
wagon has been going strong.
The reason behind the Scranton bandwagon is that he is ott
ering the Republican Part) a positive plan of action, as opposed
to the negative approach oi Arizona's store bought cowboy, Barry
Goldwater. People are not use to telling you what Goldwater is
for, but what he is against.
The Goldwater approach is definitely not "me-too" imitation of
of the Democrats, a stand he accuses Republican opponents of
taking. It is simply "1 am against. . . ." Ho has stood against the
L .X., against Medicare, against the Test-Ban Treaty, against Fed
eral Aid to Education. William Scranton, on the other hand,
doesn't pretend the problems don't exist, but offers alternative
solutions to them on the state level. The Scranton philosophy may
be summarized: The Democrats say it is not being done on the
state level, so leave it to Washington. The better choice is not
to leave things to Washington but to change things and start
forward action again on the state level.

Bill Scranton has turned his philosophy into a practical legis
lative program, and his achievements are noteworthy. In his last
two years as Governor, he has balanced the state budget (Pennsyl
vania for years had large deficits), brought unemployment down
fro 9.4 perment to 5.2 percent, brought 700 new factories to the
state, placed 18,000 jobs under Civil Service, passed the first
teacher's raise in eight years, passed the highest subsidies for
school's raise in eight years, passed the highest measures—in
