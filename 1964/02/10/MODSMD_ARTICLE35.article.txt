# Mystery: Babylon The Great
## 
### 
The word "Babylon" (which literally moans "confusion ) lias several mean
ills throughout Scripture. First, Babylon refers to the ancient city of Babylon
destroyed and never rebuilt in accordance with the prophecy of Isaiah (isa.
13:19-22). Then, in the Book of Revelation, the word "Babylon" is applied to (a)
the final world political system of the end-time and (b) to the last world-religion,
ecclcsio-Babylon. It is possible to distinguish these three different Usages of the
word Babylon from the context.
According to the great prophecies of the Bible, world history will proceed
.somewhat as follows: the true church, consisting of all born-again believers who
know Jesus Christ personally, will be removed from the world at the time of the
first resurrection of the dead (I Thcss. 4:13-18). At this time the restraining in
fluence of the Holy Spirit will also cease. (11 Thoss. 2). Ihe world will sink
rapidly thereafter into sin and apostasy, and the religious of the world will gather
together in an attempt to establish for themselves the Kingdom of God on earth.
The Antichrist will be revealed as the leader of the last corrupt world religion,
lie will exalt himself as (iod, and will, through satanie power, be able to perforin
miracles and wonders (1 1 hess, 2:9, 10). lie will be the cleverest possible imita
tion Christ.
The last corrupt federated world religion is described in the rich symbolism
of Revelation. A study of the ancient idolatries of the Babylonians and the prac
tices of one of the great religions of our day leave little doubt that the last corrupt
world religion is, even now. beginning to coalesce:
"Come hither and I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that
sitteth upon many waters: With whom the kings of the earth have committed
fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been drunk with the wine of her
fornication . . . and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, lull of names
of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns; and the woman was arrayed iii
purple and scarlet colour, and decked with ijold and precious stones and pearls
having a (lolden cup in her hand full of abominations ami tilthiness of her fornica
tion: And upon her head was a name written, MYSTERY. BAB\LON 'I 111'.
GREAT, THE MOTHER OK HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OK THE
EARTH. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints tall burn-again
believers are saints), and with the blond of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw
her. I wondered with great admiration . . . And after these things I saw another
angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened
with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying Babylon the
great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of
every foul -pint. and a cagc of every unclean and hateful bird . . . I'or her sins
have reached unto heaven, ami God hath remembered her iniquities . . . 1 here
fore. shall her plagues come in one day, death and mourning and famine: and
she -11.-111 be utterly burned with lire: for strong is the Lord (iod who judgcth
her." Rev. 17:1-7, 18:1, 2, 5, 8.
If you are a Christian, the Word of God and the Holy Spirit will make it
possible for you to avoid error and to stand faithful to Jesus ( hiist as the end
tinn world religion forms.
"Because thou hast kept the. word of my patience, I will also keep thee from
tin hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell
upon the earth. Behold, I cotm quickly: bold that fast which thou liast, that no
man t.ike thy crown." Rev. 3:IU-11.
