# Young Republicans: Where Are Your Debaters?

Editor, The Daily:
Alas, wo feared as much. The!
Stanford Area Young Republi-j
cans last week, after many days
of hestiation and indecision, once |
again refused to present their!
ideas before Ihe Stanford Com
munity in fair and honest debate
with the Stanford Young Demo- j
crats. One might have expected
that such an old and venerable
organization, once the center of
political activity on campus but
of late strongly challenged by a
variety of groups of more recent
origin one might have expected
that the SAYR's would have
leaped at the opportunity to clear
itself of the widely credited but.
wo are sure, fallacious charges
1 hat they have fallen into the pit
of scandal, strife, and extremism.
Can it be that they feel the
trauma of exposure to public
scrutiny would be 100 much for
them?
SAYR's, we do not mean to
frighten you. We do not mean to
embarrass you. We do not even j
mean to take up very much of
your valuable time. All we want
to do is to provide a forum for
political dialogue. All you need to
do is to show up.

In case at any time wo have
boon or will be misunderstood, wo
reiterate our oft-repeated chal
lenge to the SAYR's to participate
with us in a public debate at Stan
ford on any issue of national im
port a nee.

Editor, The Daily:
Be it hereby acknowledged that
on the Fifth day of February in
the year of our Lord 1964, the
Stanford Daily hath in its new
content and format brought Stan
ford University over the Brink
of Greatness. Aspiring to the
highest intellectual and aesthetic
improvement of the Students, it
hath struck boldly against the
common level of Endeavor and
espoused the example of those
Paragons of journalistic achieve

inent, the Chronicle and the most
hallowed Examiner.
To the greater Glory of wavy
black border lines and HOUSES
FULL OF MEMORIES.

• Congratulations
Editor, The Daily:
Re Hilda Kossoff's article of
last Tuesday.
Your piece on Minna Stillman
is tops in my book — extremely
well written, restrained and in
the best of taste. The people in
my household have known Miss
Stillman for years and read the
story aloud always a tough test
for any journalistic production.
The reader is an ex-teacher of
English and she, too, was full of
praise for the way you did it.
Both she and Elinor Cogswell (re
tired editor of the Palo Alto Times
and my other housemate) thought
your de scrip t iv e paragraph
"rather like a statue herself" was
especially good. I agree.
Congratulations—
