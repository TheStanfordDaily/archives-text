## One Acts: Talented Writing, Zany Music, Superb Comedy 
### John Thayer 
"Behold! saitli tin- Lord God. "There arc tlnve wonderful one
acts playing at the Little Theater." Well, he ought to know: he's
in one o} them. Hani's Head lias made up sevenfold lor the dis
aster of last quarter's Gaieties with a combination of /.any music,
talented writing and superb coined) acting that makes for a de
lightful evening.
Someone once remarked that war is hell, but Hiehard Smith,
who wrote "High Hank, the opening number, does a prett\ con
clusive job of proving that it can be funn\ too. lie has taken a
group of well-worn characters, mixed in a string and ancient and
honorable lines mosth about war, and catahzed the whole thing
with a one shell-shocked private who thinks lies God. Having
taken his customary evening stroll through the shrapnel, Private
Palmer returns to proclaim his deification, whereupon he delivers
a mereilesslv saereligious account of the creation, replete with
such priceless comments as "And then I called it a day.
Unfortunately, the actors can't quite make up their minds
whether thev are playing a tragedy or a farce; and the poor play
wright w as at a complete loss for an ending, so he setllcd for none
at all, which was a big mistake. Mike Gillespie, as the would-be
God, gives a good performance, with, however, little help from
his fellows, who plod doggedly in the best tradition of wooden
soldiers through lines that are funny in spite of them.

The second play is a totally unintended variation on the first:
| this time it's the writing that is bad. "The Church Triumphant"
I is a painfully familiar piece of nothing about a woman trying to
i pawn off her rat-infested barn on a hyper-religious alcoholic ma
tron with a propensity for converting Africans. All the actors do
i masterfully considering what they have to work with; unfortu
nately, in their desperation they overact, making a bad thing
worse. The play does have some funny spots even so, among them
the one about Aunt Lai's false teeth in the toilet bow l.
Acting and writing, with more than a dash oi skillful directing,
finally got together in "The Doctor in Spite of Himself." Calmly
puffing on a Marlboro, and dressed fit to kill in silks and satins
lie complains are the wrong period, Moliere himself (who wrote
the play with a little help from Phil Ellis) introduces the leotard
clad and bare-bosomed cast. Whereupon the curtain rises to the
accompaniment of the zany music heretofore mentioncd( stolen
from "Peer Gynt" and elsew here by Stephen Law rv, w ho then pro
ceeded to add cows, dogs, and the Lone Hanger for good meas
ure), and everyone plays out a broad farce in the grand old man
ner of bucket-slinging and good-natured thrashing that would
have done proud.
All the cast is marvelous, but Al Deardorff as the reluctant
doctor w ins the gold-plated dog biscuit: his timing is perfect, and
he makes faces that say everything and more too. The doggy, of
course upstages everybody; but he is cannily gotten rid of with
dispatch and all ends happily.
Many thanks to Ham's Head for this year's talented and well
, shorn flock. Mav it sire manv more of the same.

I is a painfully familiar piece of nothing about a woman trying to

the one about Aunt Lai's false teeth in the toilet bow l.
Acting and writing, with more than a dash oi skillful directing,

the play with a little help from Phil Ellis) introduces the leotard
