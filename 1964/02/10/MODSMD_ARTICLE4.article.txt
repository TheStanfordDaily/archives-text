of the school there are actually
more rooms available on campus
than there are applicants.
Some 12'' of the I,(jf>7 women
I residents did not renew their
I contracts for university residence)
'at the semester break. In past'
j years t lie number of coeds mov--
I ing off campus has never exceed
led one percent. Supervisor of.
Housing Ruth Donnelly said.."We
.are perfectly frank in saying that
we don't know the reasons at this
Ipoint." The Dean of Students
j Office has started a full scale in
vestigation into the reason for
; the mass move.
The MAJOR REASONS given
iby the coeds for leaving the
dorms was the lack of privacy
and regimentation imposed by t he j
university. One coed was quoted'
as saying, "Lockout was an in
convenience and the public areas
are unsatisfactory. It's like a
hotel." There was also dissatis
faction with the $x mandatory
house dues. Many of the girls com-,
plained that they were financing
| social events in which they had i
no interest.
The lack of privacy was th e
! major complaint. Girls complained
] that they had no place to enter
tain guests and that the lounges
I were too public. Food, although a
perennial complaint in dorms,
was also given as a reason for
I the exodus. Coeds objected to the
! number of served meals being
| cut to five a week and the lack of
j flexibility in meal hours.
University officials were par
ticularly surprised at the move I
since off-campus housing is very
scarce in Berkeley and it is gen
erally more expensive.
The university curtly turned down
the application of several hundred
men to fill the vacancies created
in the women's dorm.
