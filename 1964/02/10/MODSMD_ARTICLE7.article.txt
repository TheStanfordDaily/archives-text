Stanford in Bangkok? Is noth
ing socred and safe from the ever
grasping tentacles of the Harvard
of the West (and at this rate, the
Harvard of the East, South, and
North, too)?
NO, SAYS Robert Pierce. Alum
ni Director and chief mover and
s hake r at Bowman Alumni
House, and for good reasons. The
clubs are set up, Pierce explained,
not only for ihc obvious purpose
of keeping foreign graduates in
touch with their alma mater
and, perhaps, her financial needs
but also to help recruit and
orient prospective Stanford stu
dents before they come to the
Farm.
As the Committee on the For
eign Student in American Col
leges and Universities stated in a
recent booklet, "ideally, orenta
lion should begin before a stu
dent arrives in this country."
TO THIS I NO, IT Alumni clubs

have been set up in countries
ranging from Germany to the
Phillipines, from Pakistant to
Norway. These clubs vary in size
from a base of 20 members to the
160-man organization in Paris,
France. The leaders in each club
tend to be leaders in their own
country. Pierce observed, with
eminent educators and bank di
rectors being the prevalent occu
pat ion.
Many of these people are quite
young; indeed, this is an asset
to the program since the young
alumnus or alumna who has re
cently returned to his country and
who has the freshest perspective
on Stanford life can be of great
assistance to the clubs.
However, in some places, espe
cially the Orient, age still claims
seniority rights, and the president
of the Kansai (Japan> Club is a
graduate of the Class of '13.
Age aside, the duties of these
men. assumed voluntarily, include
not only orienting accepted for
eign scholars before they leave
to the strange ways of America
and its Palo Alto branch, but also
the recruiting of graduates and
undergraduates. This task is not
done in the same tnannei as in

the States; rather, it is one of
aid and information instead of
selling.
The clubs perform this function
by 1) making special information
(available to all those interested
in studying in this country; 2»
I working with the United States
j Information Agency in publiciz
ing this service; and 3i aiding
I the Admissions Office here by ob
taining information on all applic
ants.
The orientation program works
in a converse manner, also, in
that Stanford students studying
or traveling abroad are often
assisted and oriented by the club
members. In a like manner, fac
ulty members are helped. How
i ever, Pierce has assured club
members that they "should not
1 feel it incumbent upon themselves
j to take on the additional task of
i entertainment."
FINALLY, club members also
I assist new graduates, who have
| just returned to their homeland,
j and the American nationals re
cently located in the country.
As successful as ihc present
program may be, the Alumni
Association is not satisfied with
i its si/.e. Pre cut Is, Pierce c.\

plains, answers to ;i simple ques
tionnaire sent to all foreign grad
uates are pouring into Bowman
Alumni House al a heavy rate.
The questionnaire will be used as
basis for attempts to create Over
seas Alumni Clubs in many more
countries. There are three ques
tions:
• What class did you graduate
with?
• What has happened to you
since you left Stanford?
• What has happened to your
friends since they left Stan
ford?

brief and humorous. One man an
swered to the second question
thusly: "Left Stanford, went to
Sweden. Came back. Went to Aus
tralia. Got married. Have two
children and a small home. No
central heating. Wife still with
me ..." But many more are
informative and show that Stan
lord graduates are extremely in
fluential in their native lands.
Pierce thinks these men are a
relatively untapped resource, but,
as will be shown tomorrow, he
also feels that "Stanford has an
obligation to its alumni, licit or
pour, in this country 01 abroad."

cently returned to his country and
who has the freshest perspective
on Stanford life can be of great
assistance to the clubs.
However, in some places, espe
cially the Orient, age still claims
seniority rights, and the president
of the Kansai (Japan> Club is a
graduate of the Class of '13.
Age aside, the duties of these
men. assumed voluntarily, include
not only orienting accepted for
eign scholars before they leave
to the strange ways of America
and its Palo Alto branch, but also
the recruiting of graduates and
undergraduates. This task is not
done in the same tnannei as in

the States; rather, it is one of
aid and information instead of
selling.
The clubs perform this function
by 1) making special information
(available to all those interested
in studying in this country; 2»
I working with the United States
j Information Agency in publiciz
ing this service; and 3i aiding
I the Admissions Office here by ob
taining information on all applic
ants.
The orientation program works
in a converse manner, also, in
that Stanford students studying
or traveling abroad are often
assisted and oriented by the club
members. In a like manner, fac
ulty members are helped. How
i ever, Pierce has assured club
members that they "should not
1 feel it incumbent upon themselves
j to take on the additional task of
i entertainment."
FINALLY, club members also
I assist new graduates, who have
| just returned to their homeland,
j and the American nationals re
cently located in the country.
As successful as ihc present
program may be, the Alumni
Association is not satisfied with
i its si/.e. Pre cut Is, Pierce c.\

plains, answers to ;i simple ques
tionnaire sent to all foreign grad
uates are pouring into Bowman
Alumni House al a heavy rate.
The questionnaire will be used as
basis for attempts to create Over
seas Alumni Clubs in many more
countries. There are three ques
tions:
• What class did you graduate
with?
• What has happened to you
since you left Stanford?
• What has happened to your
friends since they left Stan
ford?
KOMK OF Tin; KEPMKK arc
brief and humorous. One man an
swered to the second question
thusly: "Left Stanford, went to
Sweden. Came back. Went to Aus
tralia. Got married. Have two
children and a small home. No
central heating. Wife still with
me ..." But many more are
informative and show that Stan
lord graduates are extremely in
fluential in their native lands.
Pierce thinks these men are a
relatively untapped resource, but,
as will be shown tomorrow, he
also feels that "Stanford has an
obligation to its alumni, licit or
pour, in this country 01 abroad."
