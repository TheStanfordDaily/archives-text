# Unruh Proposals To Equip Legislature For Problems
## 
### 
Jesse (Big Daddyl Unruh,
Speaker of the California Assem
bly, outlined proposals for im
provement of the California State
Legislature in a speech given to
Stanford Law students last Fri
day.
Unruh described plans to first
better inform the legislature on
current problems, and then to
provide solutions to the problems
of today.
To better inform the commit
tees of the Legislature, the mem
bers are now engaged in a "pro
gram of cooperation with the Uni
versity of California to deepen
their knowledge and widen their
horizons." The members meet
with academic and professional
experts in their committee fields.
UNRUH BELIEVES the pro

| gram is so valuable that he wants
| to expand it to include Stanford
and other universities and col
leges in the area. .Recruiting more
and better staff people is another
j way of "Streamlining the Legis-
I lature" to meet the burdens of
I increased power.
Unruh thinks the power of the j
i Legislature today is inadequate, j
■ Increasing its authority will be
i difficult. The executive depart
ment fears the competition an
improved Legislature would pro
j vide. Unruh described the exec-
I utive branch as "presently rich,
j powerful, and well staffed." He
said it does not want a "co-equal
partner which can scrutinize its
(proposals with logic, suggest al
j ternatives, or say 'No.' "
He differentiated between th e
executive department in general
and Governor Brown in particular
Iby saying "I believe Governor
Brown is well aware of tho neccs
i sity for a stronger legislature and
has done much to move in that j
i direction."
AS PROOF that the Legislature
can operate responsibly with in
creased power, the Speaker of the
Assembly cited two examples of
recent legislation initiated by the
body.
The first was in the field of
consumer protection from un
scrupulous businessmen. One of
I these measures, the Retail Sales
! Installment Credit Act, regulates!
the amount of interest which can
be charged for installment pur
chases, and "requires full disclo
sure of all charges in a single
conditional sales document."
THF SKCONI) was in the field
; of civil rights. "Legislation which i
is the subject of such intense
'struggle in Congress, is already
on the books in California."
(California already has state
laws providing for "open hous
j ing" and "public accommodation,"
the articles of the civil rights bill j
now being debated in Congress.)
The overhaul of the legislature:
j is far from finished. "While we
have made much headway, much
remains to be done." California
has to provide "revolutionary, ;
imaginative, creative solutions" to
its problems if ii is 1o lead its
.sister states in responsible r o\-
