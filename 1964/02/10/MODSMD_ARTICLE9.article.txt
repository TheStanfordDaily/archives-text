# SLAC's Powerline Compromise
## McClosky Tries To Settle Dispute 
### 
A meeting Saturday of inter
ested parties in the Stanford
Linear Accelerator powerline dis
pute began working towards a
compromise attempt to raise the
additional 1.6 million dollars to
put SLAC's powerliines under
ground.
Strong local opposition has de
veloped to the plan to build oven
head powerlines to Stanford's 114
million dollar accelerator. A group
called "Save Our Skyline," headed
by Palo Alto attorney Paul N.
McClosky Jr., has felt that over
head powerlines would mar the
beauty of the foothills.
PG&K HAS BKKN willing to
spend up to 1,012,000 dollars in
building lines to the project, but
estimated costs of underground
lines are about 2.6 million.
The compromise solution being
discussed was offered by Mc-
Closky. It calls for the AEC con
tributing $700,000, PG&E 1,000.-
000, Stanford 500,000, the town of
Woodside, 123,000, and the county
of San Mateo around 200,00.
McClosky feels that there may
be a reluctance on the part of the
University to contribute such a
large share of the additional ex
pense, "although," he points out,
"three and a half miles of the line
will cross or run adjacent to Uni
v c r s i t y property." Stanford's
board of Trustees probably will
discuss the University's proposed
contribution at their next meet
ing Feb. 20.
The groups will meet again next
Monday in San Francisco in order
to give the various groups in
volved time to consider this plan.
