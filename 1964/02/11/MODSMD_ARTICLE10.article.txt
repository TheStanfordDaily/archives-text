# Berkeley Group Forms Ecumenical Movement
## 
### 
A group of religious, business
and civic leaders in Berkeley has
formed what it claims to be the
first practical ecumenical move
ment in the United States, the
Staint Joseph of Arimathea Foun
dat ion.

THE IMMEDIATE aim of 1 lie
movement is "to draw together
Episcopalian, Roman Catholic and
Eastern Orthodox sects in discus
sion and prayer." according to
Thomas G. Barnes, associate pro
fessor of history at the University
of California and a member of
the board of directors of the
Foundation.
Fifty Cal students, encouraged
by the Foundation, formed the
Student Ecumenical Movement of
Saint Joseph of Arimathca in
December.
The ecumenical movement does
not wish to exclude ot her branches
of Christianity or to exclude any
religion, according to Barnes. "I
want to stress particularly that it
is non-sectarian or if you wish,
multi-sectarian," he said.
NEVERTHELESS, the founda
tion has decided to begin with the
three closely-tied religions, a n d
expand later. Barnes pointed out
that the three religions presently
involved all believe in the cen
tralness of the sacraments.
The foundation behind the move
ment has a board of directors, fi
nancial backing, and a piece of
property which will be used to
establish a liturgical center with
a chapel, a library and meeting
places for discussion. The founda
tion will not attempt to do in
dividual religious work since it is
esesntially a meeting place for the
exchange of ideas.
The program for this semester
includes bringing "really top
flight theologians, liturgists rep
pi'ese nt in g the three older
branches of Christendom" to the
Berkeley area. "We want to pro
voke discussion on reunification,"
Barnes dcclarcd.
