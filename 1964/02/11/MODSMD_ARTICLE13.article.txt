## ECONOMICS CAN BE CHUCKLES 
### (Author of "Rally Round the Flag, Boys!" and "Barefoot Boy With Cheek".) Barefoot Boy With Cheek 
Many of you have been avoiding economics because it is so
widely known as "the dismal science." Oh, good friends, stop
cheating yourselves of many a laugh and cheer, because eco
nomics is a positive riot! True, it is called the dismal science,
but that is only because it was invented in 1081 by Walter C.
Dismal.
It is easy to understand why Mr. Dismal's discovery of
economics is today almost forgotten, for the fact is that he
himself only stayed with the subject for two or three days.
After that he took up embonpoint, which means fatness. It is
said that at his apogee, Mr. Dismal reached 1200 pounds. This
later became known as Guy Fawkes Day.
It was not until 1770 when Adam Smith published his Wealth
of Nations (or Ozymanilias, as it is usually known as) that the
world came to realize what a rosy, twinkly, fun subject eco
nomics is. As Mr. Smith showed in his jocular little treatise,
there is nothing complicated about economics.

When there is a groat demand for a product, a great supply
is placed on the market. When there is a small demand, there
is a small supply. Take, for example, castanets. You walk into
any average American town today and I'll wager you won't see
more than eighty or ninety Castanet shops. That is because the
demand is small.
For Marlboro Cigarettes, on the other hand, the demand is
great. Thus, you will find Marlboros—with all their yummy
rich tobacco flavor and pure white Selectrate filter and pliable
soft pack and unpliable Flip-Top box—at any counter where
cigarettes are sold in eveiy one of our fifty great States and
Duluth.
To Adam Smith, Tsay, belongs the distinction of popularizing
economics. Mr. Smith was followed by David Kicardo. In fact,
everywhere he went he was followed by David Ricardo. Mr.
Smith finally got so annoyed that lie summoned a bobby, as
British policemen are called, and had Mr. Ricardo arrested.
This later became known as the Louisiana Purchase.
Upon his release from gaol, as a British jail is called, Mr.
Ricardo reported to his parole officer, Thomas Robert Malthus.
They soon became fast friends, and one night over a game of
whist they invented the stock exchange, or chutney, as it is
called in England.
Well sir, with the British having, you might say, a corner on
economics, the French decided that they wanted some eco
nomics too. Being, however, a proud nation, they refused
simply to borrow British economics, but insisted on inventing
their own. At first they tried using the truflle hound as a medium
of exchange. When this proved less than satisfactory, they
switched to pomade. Discouraged by this second disappoint
ment, they finally shrugged and said, "Oh, who cares about
economics anyhow?" and returned to the guillotine and Maurice
Chevalier.
America, I am pleased to report, had much better success with
economics. Our early merchants quickly broke down economics
into its two major categories—coins and folding money—and
today, as a result of their wisdom, we can all enjoy the automatic
toll station.
Well sir, I could go on and on about this fascinating subject,
but I know you're all in a tearing hurry to rush out, and sign
up for Econ I. So I will leave you now with two kindly words
of farewell: Gresham's Law. ® ium mux shuiman
