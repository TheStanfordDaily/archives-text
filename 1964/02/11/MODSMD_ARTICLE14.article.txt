# California Expands Overseas Program
## 
### 
The University of California has
announced that it will open two
new study centers abroad next
fall, one at the University of Ma
drid and one at International
Christian University in Toyko.
The school has already established
centers in France, Germany and
Italy.
THE NEW MADRID campus
will accept a maximum of 60
students during the 1964-65 aca
demic year. The Tokyo campus is
designed for 20 students. Accord
ing to Assistant Dean of S t u
dents William McCormack, Cali
fornia is already laying plans for
further expansion of the educa

lion abroad program until by 1970
as many as 900 students per year
I will be studying in centers around
! the world.
William H. Allaway, director
lof California's program, fore
sees a year-by-year extension of
study centers. Future centers may
be located in Hong Kong, India,
the Middle East, the United King
dom, tropical Africa and Latin
America.
The University of California
uses the facilities and faculties of
a host school for its overseas pro
gram. In return the host school
often sends exchange students to
California campuses. The univer

sity hopes that an exchange of
faculty members may also be ar
ranged.
THE OVERSEAS campuses are
designed to be entirely self-sup
porting. The host schools provide
the classrooms and faculties. A
year at one of the overseas cam
puses is supposed to cost the stu
dent no more than a year at one
of the University of California's
campuses. Expenses for the stu
dent range from $1,750 at Bor
deaux to $2,300 at Goettingen.
Students chosen for the pro
gram attend the same classes as
the students of the host univer

sity and share in their social and
cultural life. The university so-;
lects students for the program on
the basis of academic standing, I
seriousness of purpose and adap
tability to a new culture.
