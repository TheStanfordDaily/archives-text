# Ruggers Whip U-Club

### PETER EAKLAND 
Stanford's rugby squad, paced
by Gordon Waddell's 19 points,
finished phase one of its schedule
in good stylo Saturday when il
outlasted a hustling Universities
Club of Berkeley in a high scor
ing (ilt, 37-27.
Stanford threatened to turn the
game into a rout as it pushed
across 2(5 points in the first half
to the Club's S, but the Berkeley
squad rallied by capitalizing on
Stanford miscues and stayed
within two tries of the Indians
mosi of the second half.
STANFORDh as now completed
its schedule with club teams. Be
ginning ne\t week, the Indians
will maleh attacks with college
contingents, namely UCLA, USC,
and Cal. The latter two will be
at home.
Coach Pete Kmetovic said the
game was a good one for his In
dians but deplored the bad ball
handling near Stanford's own
goal from which all three Uni
versities Club tries resulted.
In the first half, three blue
shirted players stormed through
the Stanford scrum to block a
Dick Ragsdale kick from the goal
area and fought among them
selves for the loose ball.
Universities' Rick McMillin, cov
ering well on a Stanford rush,
intercepted a lateral pass and ran
untouched but five yards for the
score. The visitors' last try came
after Torn McManus fielded an

errant Stanford pass and ran sev
eral yards down the sideline. He
then passed inside to a team-mate
who scored the try.
STANFORD'S RUSIIIV rou
lette produced seven tries during
the course of the game. Capt.
and scrum half Bob Price at the
sight of a scrum or the rue trig
gers the offense and rush heads
upfield.
The ball changes hands several
times in hopes that the best open
ing will be found, and where it
stops nobody knows. Scoring
tries were Gordon Wadded, Steve
Van North (2), Glen Myers.
Frank Patilucci, Ron Fraboni,
and Price.
Clark Weaver was missing
his regular % spot, but soph
Glenn Myers, playing in his firs'
varsity game this year, ably filled
his shoes.
TURNING IN outstanding per
formances in the scrum were
Dick Leeuwenberg, who had a
tough assignment battling leap
ing Bob Chiappone for lineout
tosses, and Jon Brandin and Jack
Chappie. Dick Ragsdale joined
forces with Gordon Waddell to
continuously boot the ball down
field where is consistently found
touch.
In the back field, besides Myers
Steve Van North and Gordon
Waddell turned in outstanding
performances. Van North, the
dangerous Dutchman, not only
powerful but with good speed
and an effective straight arm,
rushed for two scores.
The first was a long run in s
broken field after a pass from
Myers, and the second was a
shorter one with the pass coming
from Phil N'eal. The Weapon
Waddell, through good faking and
running, notched the Indians'
first try. During attempts and
two long penalty kicks.
AFTFR A SLOW start, Stan
ford made three quick tries and
led 15-0. Stanford wasn't able to
substantially add to this margin
during the remainder of the con
flict, as it at times was as low
as ten and at one time was
twenty-one.
One reason was Kyrk Reid. A
short player with three-trunk
legs, he booted left-footed
through the uprights three pen
alty placements and three extra
point attempts.
Stanford's last try brought the
score to 37-16 and was the best
team effort of the afternoon and
without question the longest rush
of the short season. The play be
gan deep in Indian territory and
by the time Bob Price fell on the
ball in the Universities Club goal
area about 75 yards had been
eclipsed.
Perhaps ten passes were made,
and even the most observant of
the spectators had forgotten parts
of the play before it was over.
The backfield started the rush
but scrum members Tom Fort
mann and Randy Vahan soon got
into the act. The backfield took
over with about twenty yards to
Ro.
