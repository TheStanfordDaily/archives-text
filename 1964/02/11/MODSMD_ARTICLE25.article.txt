# ARE YOU WASHED IN THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB!
## 
### 
"Behold the Lamb of God which takcth away the sin of the world!" John 1:20.
There is no escaping the basic claim of the Christian faith; that the death of
Christ on the cross was necessary for a holy and just God to meet a sinful and lost
world of men. Not only was Jesus Christ sent from God for this very purpose,
but his atoninfr sacrifice for the sins of men was planned before the world was
created. It is God's just and holy nature which demands that something be done
about man's sins. God Himself established the divine law " I lie wages of sin is
death"; however, lie Himself bore that penalty of death for each and every man,
woman, and child on earth when Christ died on the cross so that ail who would be
lieve on Christ might receive the great ?^ift of eternal, divine life.
"... Without the shedding of the blood there is no remission (of sin) ... So
Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many . . ." Hcb. 9:22, 2N.
God asks nothing of us except that we believe and accept that which lie lias
already done for us:
"For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely
by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: \\ hom (Jim! hath set forth
to be a propitiation through faith in bis blood, to declare his righteousness for the.
remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of (iod. Horn. 3:23-25, KJ \ .
"Hut (toil commendeth bis love toward us. in that, while we were yet sinners. ( lirist
died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved
from wrath through him." Rom. S:S, 9, KJV.
If you are a Christian, you know what it means to be washed in the Wood of
the Lamb:
"If you sav 'our Father' to the One who judges every man impartially on the
record of his deeds, you must stand In awe of Mm while you live out your time on
earth. Well you know that it was no perishable stuff, like gold or silver, that bought
jour freedom front the empty folly of your traditional ways. I lie price was paid in
precious blood, as it were of a lamb without mark or blemish the blood of < lirist.
lIV was predestined before the foundation of the world, and in this last period of time
he was made manifest for your s.ike. Through him you have come to trust in (iod
who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, and so your faith ami hope arc
fixed on (iod.
"Now that by obedience to the truth you have purified your souls until you feel
sincere affection towards your brother Christians, love one another wholeheartedly
with all your strength. Von have been horn anew, not of mortal parentag. but of
immortal, through the living and enduring world of God. For
'.Ml mortals are like grass;
All their splendour like, the flower of the field;
I 11, «Jrass withers, the flower falls;
But the Word of the Lord endun s for evermore.
And this 'word' is tin word of the Gospi 1 preached to you." I Pet. I 'H '5. \K.

already done for us:
"For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely

There is no escaping the basic claim of the Christian faith; that the death of
Christ on the cross was necessary for a holy and just God to meet a sinful and lost
world of men. Not only was Jesus Christ sent from God for this very purpose,
but his atoninfr sacrifice for the sins of men was planned before the world was
created. It is God's just and holy nature which demands that something be done
about man's sins. God Himself established the divine law " I lie wages of sin is
death"; however, lie Himself bore that penalty of death for each and every man,
woman, and child on earth when Christ died on the cross so that ail who would be
lieve on Christ might receive the great ?^ift of eternal, divine life.
