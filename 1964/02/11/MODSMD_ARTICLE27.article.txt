## Forrestal Challenges D.C. Myth 
### JEFF LITTLEBOY University News Service 
A man who was the victim
of himself as well as of the times
in which he lived was James
Forrestal, America's first Secre
tary of Defense and first high gov
ernment official to kill himself.
An exciting and absorbing view
of Forrestal and the postwar Tru
man years is revealed in a new
book published last month. The
author is Arnold A. Rogow, asso
ciate professor of political science
fit Stanford. ("James Forrestal, a
Study of Personality, Politics and
Policy," 397 pp., Macmillan, $6.95)
Prof. Rogow's book, a definitive
study of a strange and tortured
man. make quite a point of For
restal's complex personality. "Par
simony and generosity, rudeness
and thoughtfulness, keeping
people at arm's length yet reach
ing out to them" writes Prof. Ro
gow of Forrestal — "it is almost
as if he were never able to decide
what sort of man he was."
★ ★ ★
THERE ARK other ambivalent
strands, Prof. Rogow points out
Forrestal's lifelong struggle to
appear stronger and tougher than
he actually was, and his efforts
in Washington to appear as the
'Very model of the philosopher
king."
As a Princeton student and as
president of Dillon Read and Co.,
New York investment bankers, he
was the self-described "Irish
Catholic Mick" who was never at
ease with Anglo-Saxon Proestants.
Skeptical of wealth and power,
he became a member of the Esta
bishment. The Washington For
restal distrusted liberals, though
he served in the administration
of two of the most liberal Presi
dents in history.
"In fact, it is one of the major
paradoxes of his life," says Prof.
Rogow, "that he was appointed
Secretary of Denfense, the highest
position he achieved in govern
ment, by a President for whose
personality and principles he felt
an active dislike."
★ ★ ★
FORRESTAL, who plunged to
his death May 22, 1949, from the
16th floor of Bethesda Naval Hos
pital. is a classic rebuttal of the
"Washington mythology" that
Very Important People cannot
become mentally ill while in office,
Rogow writes.
While ordinary people with or
dinary .jobs can and do become
psychotic, and those who can af
ford it consult psychiatrists, VlP's
do not - so the Washington fable
goes. The pity of it is, Prof. Ro
gow stresses, is that Forrestal
was not under psychiatric treat
ment until the last few weeks of
his life.
The situation becomes even
more critical, Prof. Rogow points
out, when the VIP is identified
with crucial foreign and military
policies. It is especially serious
today ,he writes, when the mere
push of a button can bring almost
instant annihilation to both sides.
★ ★ ★
TO SOME, Forrestal was a hero,
a dedicated public servant and
courageous patriot who nearly
singlehandedly reorganized the
Navy's procurement program,
created the Defense Department
in his own image, and opposed
the postwar "softness toward
Communism" with all his might
perhaps at the cost of his men
tal powers.
To others, he was an intellectual
"poseur" and front man for Wall
Street and Big Business who op
posed the formation of Israel for
fear the Arabs would cut off U.S.
oil supplies, who sought less gov
ernment interference in business,
and advocated a hardnosed anti-
Soviet policy in the era of "Good
old Joe Stalin" and a "back to
business as usual" attitude.
There are facets of the For
restal story that are still unobtain
able today and may never be
known, Rogow adds. Certainly it
is true that Forrestal extended his
concern for the nation's future
against Communism into many
fields that were not exactly in his
bailiwick. It is also true that he
took a perpetual pounding in print
from two nationally known colum
nists, Drew Pearson and Walter
Winchell, that virtually no other
government official was ever sub
jected to.
Prof. Rogow quotes a close
friend of Forrestal who says"the
story of James Forrestal is truly
an American tragedy the raw
material for a Dreiser or Dos
I'ossos novel." As told here, it is
bound In stir up new controversy.

As a Princeton student and as
president of Dillon Read and Co.,
New York investment bankers, he
was the self-described "Irish
Catholic Mick" who was never at
ease with Anglo-Saxon Proestants.
Skeptical of wealth and power,
he became a member of the Esta
bishment. The Washington For
restal distrusted liberals, though
he served in the administration
of two of the most liberal Presi
dents in history.
"In fact, it is one of the major

FORRESTAL, who plunged to
his death May 22, 1949, from the
16th floor of Bethesda Naval Hos

"Washington mythology" that
Very Important People cannot
become mentally ill while in office,
Rogow writes.
While ordinary people with or
dinary .jobs can and do become
psychotic, and those who can af
ford it consult psychiatrists, VlP's
do not - so the Washington fable
goes. The pity of it is, Prof. Ro
gow stresses, is that Forrestal
was not under psychiatric treat
ment until the last few weeks of
his life.
The situation becomes even
more critical, Prof. Rogow points
out, when the VIP is identified

policies. It is especially serious
today ,he writes, when the mere
push of a button can bring almost
instant annihilation to both sides.

TO SOME, Forrestal was a hero,
a dedicated public servant and
courageous patriot who nearly
singlehandedly reorganized the
Navy's procurement program,
created the Defense Department
in his own image, and opposed
the postwar "softness toward
Communism" with all his might
perhaps at the cost of his men
tal powers.
To others, he was an intellectual
"poseur" and front man for Wall
Street and Big Business who op
posed the formation of Israel for
fear the Arabs would cut off U.S.
oil supplies, who sought less gov
ernment interference in business,
and advocated a hardnosed anti-
Soviet policy in the era of "Good
old Joe Stalin" and a "back to
business as usual" attitude.
There are facets of the For
restal story that are still unobtain
able today and may never be
known, Rogow adds. Certainly it
is true that Forrestal extended his
concern for the nation's future
against Communism into many
fields that were not exactly in his
bailiwick. It is also true that he
took a perpetual pounding in print
from two nationally known colum
nists, Drew Pearson and Walter
Winchell, that virtually no other
government official was ever sub
jected to.
Prof. Rogow quotes a close
friend of Forrestal who says"the
story of James Forrestal is truly
an American tragedy the raw
material for a Dreiser or Dos
I'ossos novel." As told here, it is
bound In stir up new controversy.

of himself as well as of the times

pital. is a classic rebuttal of the
"Washington mythology" that
Very Important People cannot
become mentally ill while in office,
Rogow writes.
While ordinary people with or
dinary .jobs can and do become
psychotic, and those who can af
ford it consult psychiatrists, VlP's
do not - so the Washington fable
goes. The pity of it is, Prof. Ro
gow stresses, is that Forrestal
was not under psychiatric treat
ment until the last few weeks of
his life.
The situation becomes even
more critical, Prof. Rogow points
out, when the VIP is identified
with crucial foreign and military
policies. It is especially serious
today ,he writes, when the mere
push of a button can bring almost
instant annihilation to both sides.

TO SOME, Forrestal was a hero,
a dedicated public servant and
courageous patriot who nearly
singlehandedly reorganized the
Navy's procurement program,
created the Defense Department
in his own image, and opposed
the postwar "softness toward
Communism" with all his might
perhaps at the cost of his men
tal powers.
To others, he was an intellectual
"poseur" and front man for Wall
Street and Big Business who op
posed the formation of Israel for
fear the Arabs would cut off U.S.
oil supplies, who sought less gov
ernment interference in business,
and advocated a hardnosed anti-
Soviet policy in the era of "Good
old Joe Stalin" and a "back to
business as usual" attitude.
There are facets of the For
restal story that are still unobtain
able today and may never be
known, Rogow adds. Certainly it
is true that Forrestal extended his
concern for the nation's future
against Communism into many
fields that were not exactly in his
bailiwick. It is also true that he
took a perpetual pounding in print
from two nationally known colum
nists, Drew Pearson and Walter
Winchell, that virtually no other
government official was ever sub
jected to.
Prof. Rogow quotes a close
friend of Forrestal who says"the
story of James Forrestal is truly
an American tragedy the raw
material for a Dreiser or Dos
I'ossos novel." As told here, it is
bound In stir up new controversy.
