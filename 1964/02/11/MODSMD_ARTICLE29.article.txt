## Daily Has Failed To Mention All Facts On Religion Issue 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
1 have read with interest th e
I articles which have appeared in
the Daily since the beginning of
the Quarter concerning church
services on the Stanford Campus,
lit is the notion of those writers
that the opportunities for religi
i ous expression on this campus are
j grieviously inequal and that this
inequality should bo remedied by
increased university • sponsored
campus religious activity for non-
Protestant religions.
While such alterations would,
in my view, be desirable if ade
quate space and finances could
justify the representation of all
faiths with a church or chaplain,
conditions are such that this solu
tion is nearly impossible. I should
like to support the view that the
University is doing the best it can
under the existing conditions.
Although many of the Daily
writers are conscientiously inter
ested in the religious issues, it is
not clear that they have taken the
time or the trouble either to find
out or to mention all the facts. To
counter these omissions I would
like to mention two points: Hi To
say that "students are generally
dissatisfied with Memorial
Church" is an irresponsible state
ment when based on an extremely
limited survey. (2) One may
choose to call the Stanford Church
sectarian and Protestant, and
Stanford's views about religion
discriminatory, but to keep the
record straight, it ought to have
been mentioned that until three
years ago the Catholic Archbishop
of San Francisco (not Archbishop
McGucken) refused to allow a
Catholic priest to deliver a sermon
at Stanford Church and that un
til three years ago he refused to
allow the senior class president,
if he was a Catholic, to read the
lesson on Baccalaureate Sunday
or on Founder's Day. Also why
has it not boon mentioned by any
of the writers that Archbishop
McGuoken will deliver this year's
Bacca la urate Sermon?
If Stanford does decide to em
ploy more clerics and make pos
sible mon? services, it will bo very
interesting to observe the attend
ence records. Perhaps the issue
ought to be decided on the basis
of signed petitions.
What wc finally have to ask
ourselves is whether the opportun
ity to go to our own religious
services really is the serious issue
that we are told it is. If so, it is
rather surprising that so few have
availed themselves of the free
roundtrip transportation offered
every year by religious congrega
tions of the neighboring commu
nities.
Mrs. Stanford's hope after all
was that all students, Protestants
included, would choose their own
methods of worship. The Stanford
Memorial Church was to be a
place where all students, regard
less of theological differences,
might; have "the chance to hear
the words of those who seek to
interpret the religious thought
and teaching of the day or to
guide us iti the ethical aspects of
human conduct" (from Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur's address at this
inauguration <is third President of
Stanford, January 22, 1916).
In short, the donor intended the
Memorial Church not to be a divi
sive element and the cause of bick
ering over fine points of "man
made creeds and varieties of re

ligion," but rather a unifying
force in the spiritual and intel
lectual life of the University.

of "neighboring congregations"
shows the only "free, round
trip transporation'' to Sunday
worship services is student car
pools.)

Editor, Tiie Daily:
I wish to congratulate The Daily i
for its truly enlightened and cour
ageous discussion of Religion at
Stanford. Yours was a noble and
dignified attempt to pinpoint the
issues which set aside Stanford
from other Universities through
out the land which have accepted
the religious challenges of a
Twentieth Century academic
youth in search of meaningful
spiritual expression in the face
of extreme materialism and de
emotionalized gadget ism.
To be sure. I disagree with any
one who peddles the view that
this was an artificial discussion,
carried on by those who have no
interest in religion but only a
desire to embarrass the school.
This is a naive distortion and a
refuseal to face up to the realities
of the situation.
From my own experience with
students of all faiths, I earnestly
feel that you as spokesmen for
religious freedom on our campus,
are motivated by honest and forth
right ideals which have outgrown
the narrow denominationalism of
yesteryear. Students today insist
on the absolute freedom to fol
low the dictates of their own re
ligious conscience without subter
fuge and without preferential
treatment for anyone particular
denomination. This goes way be
yond sectarianism and outmoded
legalistic strictures.
We hope and pray that your
series ot articles will pave the
way to the creation of a Student
Religious Center which will prove
to all that God's house has many
mansions.

Editor, The Daily:
We can only sadly agree with
Mr. Tustin's sentiments concern
ing the seating wrangle for "Long
Day's Journey Into Night" — it
was most unfortunate. We had
originally thought that the at
tendance for these experimental
shows would be small and that
an at-the-door sale for Nitery and
Little Theatre productions would
give Stanford students the first
chance at seats, and we wished
to encourage larger student au
diences for experimental produc
tions.
However, since this method of
sale has proven clearly inconveni
ent to all concerned, it will not be
continued. Henceforth, all tickets
to Stanford Players productions
will be sold in advance through
the Tresidder Union Box Office.
Our sincere apologies to all those
who were unable to attend "Long
Day's Journey."
