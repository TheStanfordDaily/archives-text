## Party Man Counsels Politicians 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
With political parties springing
up all over campus, and scores
of young men on campus getting
their first: taste of political action,
it seems fitting to offer advice to
Ihese budding politicos on How to
Succeed in Politics.
Since this is such a complex
problem, it is best not merely to
give one student's opinions, but
rather to call upon an expert in
the art of party politics. And

who is more
qualified to
speak on party
organization
and aeivity than
G e(J rg e Wash
ington Plunkitt.
a former leader
in Tamm a ny
Hall. But then lot

Mr. Plunkolt introduce himself.
"I DON'T think you can easily
find a better example than I am
of success in politics. After forty j
year's experience at the game I
am, well. I'm George Washington j
Plunkitt. Everybody knows what
figure I cut in the greatest organi- j
•/.ation on earth."
"Now, havin' qualified as an
expert, as the lawyers say. I am
goin" to give advise free to the j
young men who are goin' to cast
their first votes, and who are;
lookin' forward to political glory
and lots of cash. Some young men
think they can learn how to be
successful in politics from books,
and they cram their heads with
all sorts of college rot. They!
couldn't make a bigger mistake." !

"IF Y()* T . . . want to go into!
politics, do as I did. Get a follow
in' if it's only one man, and then
go to the district leader and say: j
1 want to join the organization, i
I've got one man who'll follow mei
through thick and thin.' The lead- i
er won't laugh at your one-man
followin.' He'll shake your hand
warmly, offer to propose you for
membership in his club, take you
down to the corner for a drink
and ask you to call again.
But go to him and say "I took
first prize at college in Aristotle;
I can recite all Shakespeare for
wards and backwards and I'm
the real thing in the way of silver
tongued orators." What will he
answer? He'll probably say: 'I
guess you are not to blame for
your misfortunes, but we have no
use for you here."
But most of you have already
gathered together your flocks of
supporters, and have begun to
worry about other matters, such
as issues. Mr. Plunkitt also offers
the secret of his political success.
"I don't send them campaign
literature. That's rot. People can
get all the political stuff they
want to read — and a good deal
more, too — in the papers. Who
wants to read speeches, nowadays,
anyhow? It's bad enough to listen
to them. You ain't goin' to gain
any votes by stuffin' the letter
boxes with campaign documents.
Like as not you'll lose votes."

"ABOVK ALL things, avoid a
dress suit. You have no idea of
the harm that dress suits have
done in politics. They are not
so fatal to youg politicians as civil
reform and drink, but they have
scores of victims. . . .
Another thing that people won't
stand for is showin' off your
learnin.' I know it's an awful
temptation, the hankerin' to show
off your learnin.' I've felt it. my
self, but I always resist it.
"That's the a, b, c, of politics. It
ain't easy work to got up to y
and z. You have to give nearly all
your time and attention to it. Of
course, you may have some busi
ness or occupation on the side,
but the great business of your life
must be politics if you want to
succeed in it."
IF YOU FEEL more informa
tion on the nature of successful
party politics is needed, Mr. Plun
kett's collected works are avail
able at the bookstore. Of course
not all of his opinions are valid
for political parties here, but if
he were a student here, the
chances are that he'd be a valu
able organization man for some
body's lucky party.
What may result from an or j
ganized campus political system
is not student leaders, but, in
stead, student politicians, like*, al
though on a smaller scale, Plun
kitt. For those who want to be I
the campus politicians, political
parties are a fine thing indeed, j
but, for those who want to take;
part in student government, I I
think the present system is plenty i
i good enough.

Since this is such a complex
problem, it is best not merely to
give one student's opinions, but
rather to call upon an expert in
the art of party politics. And

"I DON'T think you can easily

of success in politics. After forty j
year's experience at the game I
am, well. I'm George Washington j
Plunkitt. Everybody knows what
figure I cut in the greatest organi- j
•/.ation on earth."
"Now, havin' qualified as an
expert, as the lawyers say. I am
goin" to give advise free to the j
young men who are goin' to cast
their first votes, and who are;
lookin' forward to political glory
and lots of cash. Some young men
think they can learn how to be
successful in politics from books,
and they cram their heads with
all sorts of college rot. They!
couldn't make a bigger mistake." !

With political parties springing
up all over campus, and scores
of young men on campus getting
their first: taste of political action,
it seems fitting to offer advice to
Ihese budding politicos on How to
Succeed in Politics.
Since this is such a complex
problem, it is best not merely to
give one student's opinions, but
rather to call upon an expert in
the art of party politics. And

who is more
qualified to
speak on party
organization
and aeivity than
G e(J rg e Wash
ington Plunkitt.
a former leader
in Tamm a ny
Hall. But then lot

Mr. Plunkolt introduce himself.
"I DON'T think you can easily
find a better example than I am
of success in politics. After forty j
year's experience at the game I
am, well. I'm George Washington j
Plunkitt. Everybody knows what
figure I cut in the greatest organi- j
•/.ation on earth."
"Now, havin' qualified as an
expert, as the lawyers say. I am
goin" to give advise free to the j
young men who are goin' to cast
their first votes, and who are;
lookin' forward to political glory
and lots of cash. Some young men
think they can learn how to be
successful in politics from books,
and they cram their heads with
all sorts of college rot. They!
couldn't make a bigger mistake." !
