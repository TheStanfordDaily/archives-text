# A 						TWO-WAY STREET
## Alumni Can Do More For 'Farm' 
### STEVE LEOPOLD International Editor (Last in a series) 
"As there becomes a cadre of
Stanford alumni with better
knowledge of the University, then
they can do more for our stu
dents," observed Alumni Director
Robert Pierce when speaking of
the current attempt to enlarge
ihe number of Overseas Alumni
Clubs.
This dictum, which seems some
what calculating, is similar to the
one printed in I ast summer's
Alumni Almanac, "A well-in
formed alumni body is one of the
best assets a university can
have." However, lest the Over
seas Alumni think they are being
urged to hand together solely for
the purpose of aiding the alma
mater, the more humanitarian
raisons r'etre should be explored.
VI,( M\ I UNIVERSITY con
tacts can be mutually beneficial,
and to this end, Pierce explains,
the Alumni Office schedules lec
tures and informal panels at
Overseas Clubs for those faculty
members on giants or sabbatic

als. Indeed, the number of profes
sors overseas is such, Pierce
quipped, that "it is easier to get
a faculty speaker booked in Oslo
than in Fresno."
The Association encourages
"frequent, small and informal"
gatherings of alumni interested
in a specific topic rather than
the annual chaotic conclave.
Pierce has been instrumental
in the increase of those Overseas
Clubs. There were already some
clubs abroad Tokyo and Ma
nila are prime examples before
Pierce was sent on a two-month,
around-the-world trip last year to
establish new clubs and deter
mine what the University could
do for its foreign alumni.
AT THAT TIME, however,
there were no permanent clubs
in Europe. Now there are seven,
which raises the total of Over
seas Clubs to seventeen.
In assorting Pierce's trip and
its effect on the Overseas Club
program, two significant factors
stand out:
• The whole operation had to
be improvised somewhat because,
as Pierce hud discovered in pre-

I paring for the trip, thorp was no
, one to copy. No other college has
!a program of this type. Indped,
after Pierce got back, the United
| States Information Agency had
j him make a rather lengthy
speech, translated it into sevpral
I languages, and labeled his efforts
as "part of the cultural division
1 of American affairs abroad."
• The second factor was the
I marked enthusiasm of foreign
alumni for the program, and, to
use the hyperbolic terminology
j of the Alumni Almanac, "the de
motion to Stanford that foreign
alumni maintain, and the eager
ness they have to see that others
I from their country have similar
! opportunity."
HOWKVKH. there is more to
this second point than chauvinis
tic sentimentalism. Pierce had
i thought, before he left, that ho
would be able to gauge the value
i of his sojourn in each particular
! country by comparing the num
ber who saw him off. "I thought
if more came to sec me leave
than to see me arrive. the trip
would have bepn of value to the
I program."

Halfway through the trip,
Pierce had to scotch this formula,
"When there are 120 people at
the airport (Manila), when six
garlands are thrown around your
neck, when Hie Minister of the
Interior and the Minister of Com
merce board the plane to mark
your passport and grant all the
immunitips possible to a visitor
unknown to them pxcept for the
University he represents, then
you feel that these people still
have a committment to the Uni
versity."
Tili; rOMMITTMKXT is more
than a feeling of nostalgia. And
the Overseas Clubs are commit
ted to something more valuable
than sentiment. The new trend
in Alumni Associations has been
called a desire to "heft brains in
stead of bottles" and to this end
the establishment of speaking
tours for traveling professors is
all to the good.
But Stanford has added still an
other dimension the foreign di
mension and ihis addition will
benefit both sides. Stanford in
Bangkok is not such a strange
idea alter all.
