It's an awful load, carrying; 28 units, but ex-Cal student
Steve Fossett <li<i it in order to transfer to Stanford.
A.t<'r two hectic years in Cal's student government, Fos
sett decided that, nothing he could do would affect the Univer
sity's policy toward undergraduates —he felt trapped by mas
sive indifference.

So he came to Stanford,
s where the things he was
| lighting for — the Honor
\ Code, syllabi in undergradu
\ < ate courses, ami especially
**' coeducational dorm - room
J study-dates — are already
* present.
s Fossett plans to stay out
J of student. government at
* Stanford. All his participa
| tion brought him for his
\ pains at Berkeley was dis
| satisfaction with liis aca
s demic progress. To 111 ak e
* up the hole in his record he
\ enrolled at Stanford ami
* Cal at the same time, finish-
ing finals there just in time
» for midterms here.
s .Many of the people at
J Berkeley are disaffected,
\ Fossett explains. "One often
J hears that 75% of the Cal
\ students would rather have
J come to Stanford. For a
\ long time 1 was solidly in the
| oth e r 2;>%<." Berkeley
s seemed to offer him th e
* best possible education, ami
s to Im' steadily improving.
However, the time he was
\ devoting to student Govern
| ment interfered with that
s education — Fossett was
| President of his Sophomore
s class, Men's Residence Hall
| Representative, and was
v about to take over Ills class
J again — and student govern
\ ment turned out to be pow
!' erless.
Fossett decided to change
schools after the "study
date" incident, widely if
twistedly publicized last De
| ceniber. lie had proposed
| that both men's ami worn
t en's dorms l>e open from (»
| to 12 p.m. one night a week
\ for study dates, since, he
J | felt, there was no other suit
| able place on campus.

A tlioiis a n <1 students
signed :i petition asking' for
the change. The Examiner
picked up the story with
arch references to Harvard
dormitories and tlie Chron
icle indulged in similar "nit
picking."
The petition was denied
by the Cal authorities, who
pointed out that the idea
iiad been tried, and aban
doned at UCLA since the stu
dents objected to "the inva
sion of their privacy."
It was not so much th e
denial itself as the atmos
phere surrounding it t. h a t
discouraged Fossett and led
him to decide to transfer.
In resigning from his new
won post of Residence Hall
Representative, Fossett de
clared: "I have concluded
that I cannot get a first class
education travelling second
class. . . . Without involve
ment and without a faith in
Berkeley's future, U.C. Ber
keley is no longer my first
choice university."
