THE CASE
FOR TOTAL COMMITMENT
If God were to speak to you today and ask you to commit your life entirely
to Him, turning everything you have over to Him, what would you do? Do you
think that God would provide for your needs and welfare? The Holy Scriptures
teach us that God has indeed asked that we devote, entrust, and dedicate our lives
to Him, and has promised to fulfill .nil the needs of those who follow Christ. Dedi
cated Christians know that God's promises never fail, and the rewards of total,
dedication to Christ far exceed the sacrifices which are required. Any man who knows
Jesus personally and who heeds His words will have a thrilling life in store for him:
"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth
corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves
do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is. there will your heart
be also. The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole
body shall be full of light. Hut if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
No man can serve two masters: for either lie will hate the one, and love the other
or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and
mammon.
"Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat
or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life
more than meat, and the body than raimant? Heboid the fowls of the air: for they
sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father
feedcth them. Are ye not much better than they? Which of you by taking thought
can add one cubit unto his stature? And why take ye thought for raimant? Con
sider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: And
yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
these. Wherefore if God do clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow
is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
"Therefore, take no thought saying, What shall we eat? or what shall we drink?
Or wherewithal shall we be clothed? (For after all these things do the heathen
seek:) for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these things, Hut
seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall
be added unto you. Therefore take no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall
take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."
Matt. 6:19-34.
These words spoken by Jesus are backed up by the power, authority, and might
of the God who made us. Why not take God at His word and maki a total, all out
commitment to Jesus Christ? Build not for a paltry few years on a sinful planet,
but for a glorious eternity with Jesus.

or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life
more than meat, and the body than raimant? Heboid the fowls of the air: for they
sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father
feedcth them. Are ye not much better than they? Which of you by taking thought
can add one cubit unto his stature? And why take ye thought for raimant? Con
sider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: And
yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
these. Wherefore if God do clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow
is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
"Therefore, take no thought saying, What shall we eat? or what shall we drink?
Or wherewithal shall we be clothed? (For after all these things do the heathen
seek:) for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these things, Hut
seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall
be added unto you. Therefore take no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall
take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."
Matt. 6:19-34.
These words spoken by Jesus are backed up by the power, authority, and might
of the God who made us. Why not take God at His word and maki a total, all out
commitment to Jesus Christ? Build not for a paltry few years on a sinful planet,
but for a glorious eternity with Jesus.

THE CASE
FOR TOTAL COMMITMENT
If God were to speak to you today and ask you to commit your life entirely
to Him, turning everything you have over to Him, what would you do? Do you
think that God would provide for your needs and welfare? The Holy Scriptures
teach us that God has indeed asked that we devote, entrust, and dedicate our lives
to Him, and has promised to fulfill .nil the needs of those who follow Christ. Dedi
cated Christians know that God's promises never fail, and the rewards of total,
dedication to Christ far exceed the sacrifices which are required. Any man who knows
Jesus personally and who heeds His words will have a thrilling life in store for him:
"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth
corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves
do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is. there will your heart
be also. The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole
body shall be full of light. Hut if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
No man can serve two masters: for either lie will hate the one, and love the other
or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and
mammon.
"Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat
or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life
more than meat, and the body than raimant? Heboid the fowls of the air: for they
sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father
feedcth them. Are ye not much better than they? Which of you by taking thought
