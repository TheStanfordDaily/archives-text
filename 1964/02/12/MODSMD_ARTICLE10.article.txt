# Pacific Gas Confirms Aid For Power Lines
## No Commitments From Other Four 
### JIM HORNE Managing Editor 
The Pacific Gas and Electric
Company has confirmed its offer
j of $1,012,000 to help meet the cost
of moving underground the power
lines to the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator.
But the four other groups which
have been suggested as sources
of the remaining $1,650,000 ex
pense have not yet made eommit
| meats.
Robert McClosky. chairman of
i he group opposing overhead
I transmission lines on the grounds
I that they would spoil "scenic
beauty," suggested at a meeting
Saturday that the Atomic Energy
Commission put up $700,00, the
University add $500,000, San Ma
! teo County contribute $500,000
land nearby Woodside supply the
j final $150,000.
WOODSIDE MAYOR Donald
| Graham said that the $150,000
! figure represents "the absolute
maximum contribution we could
| make if we can legally use tax
! monies for such purposes."
Howard Gawthrop, San Mateo
County deputy district attorney,
said that "no statement can be
made until the next meeting of
the County Board of Supervisors."
"The County has sot no policy
on such matters," said Gawthrop,
and we cannot comment until the
Supervisors meet."
THE UNIVERSITY Board of
Trustees meets a week from to
morrow to consider any appropri
ations.
The Atomic Energy Commis
sion, meanwhile, has refused to
take any action until a concrete
| proposal is made by t he I hr e e
parties who have yet to act.
Rodney Southwick of the AEC
i information office suggested that
! "McClosky's $700,000 figure had
been arrived at on a strange ba
sis," and that, while "an informal
agreement might be made with
the Commission in Washington,
specific proposals would have to
be made by the other parties con
cerned before the AEC could
act."
SHOULD McCLOSKY and the
Woodside area residents encour
age the various parties to raise
the necessary $1.6 million, and
put the six-mile power lines un
derground. it would set a prece
dent which could force the AEC
to install underground lines in
other parts of the country.
While the University has esta
blished a policy that all distribu-1
tion and transmission lines of 12!
KV or less be placed under
ground on campus, the Trustees
in 1961 authorized an exception
lo this rule for the SLAC lines,
in view of the greater costs which
would result from underground
ing 60 KV.
A. R. Lucdcke, AEC general
manager, has indicated that the
I underground lines would not only
cost an addition $1.6 million, but
would take longer to build, have
less capacity, and be impossible
j to expand without further con
| struction.
In addition, should the lines fail i
j to function properly during their
use, the time and expense in
volved in finding and repairing
the difficulty would represent a
serious setback, since SLAC offi
cials plan for the accelerator to
be in operation 21 hours a day.
Spokesmen for SLAC added
that additional power will be
needed by June, 1965, and that it
would take two years to construct
; underground lines.
j SLAC has examined a number
| of power tower designs in an cf
i fort to find ones which would 1
t meet public objections to the dual-;
j circuit, six-wire, 120-foot towers |
which had originally been planned I
for.
TIIE UNIVERSITY finally de
cided upon 75-foot, single tubular |
' steel poles, which would be less

destructive to the "scenic beauty
which MeClosky and the Wood
side group is trying to preserve.
The University, while making
the compromise proposal, has
pointed oul that the 120-foot dual
circuit poles have far greater re
liability, because if cither circuit
failed, Ibe other would carry pow
er sufficient to keep SLAC in con
tinuous operation. To compensate
for this decrease in reliability ad
ditional receiving facilities at the
Center would have to be fur
nished, using Government funds.
THE WOODSIDE and San Ma
teo planning commissions, how
ever, also turned down the pro
posals for these 65-foot poles, with
San Mateo County planning com
missioner declaring that the over

head lines, "would be highly dam
aging to the scenic values of the
country."
The Atomic Energy Commis
sion has given the local citizen's
groups. SLAC, and Pacific Gas
and Electric a last opportunity to
effect a compromise.
All the parties have agreed to
meet again Monday at PG&E's
San Francisco main office? to con
tinue their discussions.

ARTIST'S CONCEPTION of proposed three-line towers to provide
power to the Stanford Linear Accelerator. This plan is an alternate
to the disputed six-wire towers.
The Pacific Gas and Electric
Company has confirmed its offer
j of $1,012,000 to help meet the cost
of moving underground the power
lines to the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator.
But the four other groups which
have been suggested as sources
of the remaining $1,650,000 ex
pense have not yet made eommit
| meats.
Robert McClosky. chairman of
i he group opposing overhead
I transmission lines on the grounds
I that they would spoil "scenic
beauty," suggested at a meeting
Saturday that the Atomic Energy
Commission put up $700,00, the
University add $500,000, San Ma
! teo County contribute $500,000
land nearby Woodside supply the
j final $150,000.
WOODSIDE MAYOR Donald
| Graham said that the $150,000
! figure represents "the absolute
maximum contribution we could
| make if we can legally use tax
! monies for such purposes."
Howard Gawthrop, San Mateo
County deputy district attorney,
said that "no statement can be
made until the next meeting of
the County Board of Supervisors."
"The County has sot no policy
on such matters," said Gawthrop,
and we cannot comment until the
Supervisors meet."
THE UNIVERSITY Board of
Trustees meets a week from to
morrow to consider any appropri
ations.
The Atomic Energy Commis
sion, meanwhile, has refused to
take any action until a concrete
| proposal is made by t he I hr e e
parties who have yet to act.
Rodney Southwick of the AEC
i information office suggested that
! "McClosky's $700,000 figure had
been arrived at on a strange ba
sis," and that, while "an informal
agreement might be made with
the Commission in Washington,
specific proposals would have to
be made by the other parties con
cerned before the AEC could
act."
SHOULD McCLOSKY and the
Woodside area residents encour
age the various parties to raise
the necessary $1.6 million, and
put the six-mile power lines un
derground. it would set a prece
dent which could force the AEC
to install underground lines in
other parts of the country.
While the University has esta
blished a policy that all distribu-1
tion and transmission lines of 12!
KV or less be placed under
ground on campus, the Trustees
in 1961 authorized an exception
lo this rule for the SLAC lines,
in view of the greater costs which
would result from underground
ing 60 KV.
A. R. Lucdcke, AEC general
manager, has indicated that the
I underground lines would not only
cost an addition $1.6 million, but
would take longer to build, have
less capacity, and be impossible
j to expand without further con
| struction.
In addition, should the lines fail i
j to function properly during their
use, the time and expense in
volved in finding and repairing
the difficulty would represent a
serious setback, since SLAC offi
cials plan for the accelerator to
be in operation 21 hours a day.
Spokesmen for SLAC added
that additional power will be
needed by June, 1965, and that it
would take two years to construct
; underground lines.
