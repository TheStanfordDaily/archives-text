# Dormies Desert At Other Cat Campuses
## 
### HILDA KOSSOFE 
The managers of UC Berkeley's
dorms have one thing to comfort
them — but it's a rather cold com
fort. Students are deserting the
dorms at the UCLA and River
side campuses, too.
In the men's dorms things are
bad enough — waiting lists have
practically evaporated — but the
situation is far worse in the
women's dorms. For the first
time, there are empty rooms and
no one willing to live in them.
THE RIVERSIDE exodus is
most surprising. Although off
campus housing is scarce and ex-

pensive, only the first floor of a
brand new girl's dormitory is
filled.
A survey taken by the Daily
Californian found five typical
grievances which led students to
move out. The troubles are com
mon to most university housing,
but are apparently aggravated at
the Cal schools.
First on the list is the food —
bad and badly prepared. One jun
ior girl said, "About the fourth
time I found hair in my food I
gave up and started eating sand
wiches in my room."
THE OTHER complaints deal
mostly with regimentation—dorm
ies must endure stringent lockout
rules and attend all house meet
ings. Another junior evacuee de
clared, "I just couldn't stand the
compulsory living as a 'happy
family.' One must follow this
tradition and that tradition, and
pretty soon there isn't time for
anything else."
Girls also listed lack of free
dom in entertaining guests and

dates — they said they had no
place at all to go — and tho de
sire to manage their own home.
But the primary thing was that
the students felt that they were
being treated like children. They
were caught in a web of conde
scending rules administered by

vigilant house mothers.
THE SIZE OF the dorms
some are as high as 8 stories
and the crowds of people in them
are also driving students to off
campus apartments.
A sophomore boy gave his rea
sons for leaving: "If you leave a
door open, it's an invitation for 10
people to come in. It's not that I
didn't like the guys — it's just
that ihere were so many of them."
Cal officials are casting about
for a solution to their crisis. One
plan that has been announced is
a new, million-dollar co-op, for
which funds are still being raised.
From 10 to 15 percent of Cal stu
dents already live in co-ops.
IF THIS project goes through,
it will be the first University ap
proved coeducational housing at
Cal.
A University of California Hous
ing Committee is meeting at
UCLA to consider future student
housing arrangements. One pro
posal would make cooperative
apartment houses of existing dor

mitories.
This solution would not relieve
crowding but would at least give
residents control of the rules they
live under.
With apartment rents rising
around all the campuses, an an
swer to the housing problem is
being eagerly sought.
