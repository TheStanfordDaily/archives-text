# Dartmouth Plan: Better Brains, Bigger Boosters
## Editorial 
### 
Working on the assumption that better
brains build bigger boosters, Dartmouth has
recently announced its intention to institute
a full-scale "Alumni College" to be held
during two weeks in August.
According to Dartmouth President John
Sloan Dickey, quoted in this week's Time
Magazine, "This is not a missionary effort.
This is for people who have been reading
already, but want somebody to discuss their
reading with."

Time reports that the College will in
clude a full series of lectures (given by four
Dartmouth professors), informal discussions,
and seminars in four specific areas—Science
and Human Values, Current Economic Prob
lems, Literature and Contemporary Affairs,
and the Scientific Age: Dream and Reality.
In addition, the reactivated scholars will be
given a preparatory reading list which in
cludes such varied selections as The Book
of Job, Lord uf the Flics, and As You Like

It.
Dartmouth's goal — to establish "a sus
tained, serious intellectual relationship with
its alumni" — would seem to be lolty and
laudable in an era when the genus alum is
more often cultivated for its income rather
than its insights.

Stanford Alumni Director Robert Pierce
has noted that the new trend in alumni
associations has been a desire to "heft brains
instead of bottles." And Stanford has suc
ceeded in scheduling some of its professors
to speak at its many alumni meetings around
the country.
But this is not enough. The Bay Area
alone encompasses many thousands of pre
sumably intelligent Stanford graduates. Yet,
from the perspective of the Stanford student

1964, the alumni population seems a large
question mark, an undeveloped natural re
source, and, too often, a negative factor —
an objection, an obstacle, a reason "why not.
It is quite possible that this is a false im
age, and if so, the fault is a lack of genuine
communication. We think the Dartmouth
program offers an ideal means of involving
the "lost generations" of alumnis in the intel
lectual life of the university community once
again.
