## Barry's Controversial, But Is He Realistic?

While we as students cannot consider ourselves mature politi
cal thinkers in the academic sense, still we are approaching or
have reached the age at which we can vote in a national election.
At Stanford, newspaper columns and guest speakers indicate
a high degree of student concern over presidential candidates.
The Republican candidate who is receiving much vocal support at
Stanford is Senator Harry Goldwater. The question must he asked:
why does Goldwater receive this support?
fieri) Caen, in his column in the San Francisco Chronicle, once
asked how there could he such a person as a "young Republican."
The traditional image of the republican is the elderly, stodgy, and
wealthy American who is rigidly set in his ways. Yet the Gold
water brand of Republicanism is attracting support from youth.
One might look to the social class, relative wealth, and par
ental political attitudes of the average student to explain the
phenomenon of Goldwater enthusiasm. The American College
points to a study done at Vassar, where the political views of
undergraduates from upper-middle class families tend to become
more radical as the students progress from freshman to senior.
At Stanford, however, like Vassar, we are "of the wealthy few,"
and the trend seems to be toward solidification of parental politi
cal views rather than rebellion against.

The above explanations are obviously insufficient to explain
Goldwater's support among youth at Stanford. Goldwater repre
sents an avoidance of social change and motion toward I.9th Cen
tury colonialism. He is the figurehead of those deeply frightened
of the dynamicism the United States must practice in order to
adjust to a changing world. Gold water's platform is regression:
the United States should bury its head and present its protruding
rear end to the rest of the world.
Goldwater also represents a dissatisfaction with the political
status quo. Goldwater's supporters then, like him, must revile
our contemporary relationship with Cuba as well as the nuclear
test ban treaty. Does Goldwater truly believe that his ideas could
enhance America's place in the world, or is he acting as a politi
cal strategist, attempting the publicize his name with direct oppo
sition of every act of the present administration? In either case,
Goldwater hardly presents the image of the responsible president.
From the student point of view, Goldwater is controversial.
He is indisputably a figure over whom one could temporarily be
come enthusiastic. Ile demonstrates more personality and "individ
ualism" than any Republican of our generation; his persistent oppo
sition to the present administration wins him consistent new s cover
age. Hut controversy for its own sake soon atrophies.
National polls show a decrease in Goldwater's popularity; his
popularity at Stanford is perhaps expressed only by the reaction
ary few. While it is joyous that political minds are becoming
more and more active, this activity must be tempered with a
realistic view of the future. Realism demands that Goldwater
must not be taken seriously.
