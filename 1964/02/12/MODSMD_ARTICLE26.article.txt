# Young Republicans: We Welcome Public Forum
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Contrary to the illusions of
some Young Democrats, th e
Stanford Area Young Repub
licans welcome any public for
um, ranging from debates with
our Democratic friends to the
proposed conversion of Tresid
der's courtyard into Pershing
Square- At-Stanford.
Rut. unfortunately, 1 have
not yet been informed of the
issues which the Young Demo
crats want to discuss, when,
and under what variation of
Marquis de Queensbury.
My first contact with SAYD
president, Bob Ronka, was to
loan him the SAYR constitu
tion so that of the Young
Democrats could be patterned
after it. Our two subsequent
conversations went something
like this.
During the first week of the
quarter, Mr. Ronka broached
the question of a debate. I ex
pressed interest and offered
the names of several SAYR de
baters. Mr. Ronka was to con
tact me when he and t hey
agreed upon a subject and de
bate format.
Nearly three weeks elapsed
before I heard from him again.
During this lime, rumors that
Young Republicans were afraid
to meet Young Democrats in
open debate began to circulate.
Mr. Ronka finally called me
on Friday, January 31. I was
unable to discuss the matter
in detail at the time. Though
he agreed to call in the morn
ing, Ronka failed to do so.
His only other communica
tion with the SAYR came on
the following night, during
Tresidder's French movie "The
Red and the Black." Ronka
seated himself next to an
SAYR member. Though he hacl
not contacted me or the de
baters whom I had mentioned
three weeks before, he deliv
ered an ultimatum: Unless we
agreed to set up a debate by
Friday, February 7, the YD's
would carry their grievance to
the Daily.
Said SAYR member told
Ronka to discuss some of the
minor details with me: the sub

ject to be debated, time, place,
etc. He has yet to call.
I have no objection to Daily
letters proclaiming SAYR un
willingness to debate, fallaci
ous as they may be. Rut Mr.
Ronka would save both organi
zations a good deal of time
and effort by simply contact
ing me and discussing the mat
ter.

• NSA Questioned
Editor, The Daily:
It has come to my attention
that the Associated Students
spend nearly $2,(300 per year
on the National Student Asso
ciation. I am unaware, how
ever. of any benefit accruing
to me, a student, from the ex
penditure of this money.
I have read opinions which
have been voiced at the na
tional convention, both by "rep
resentatives'" from Stanford
and by the NSA as a body rep
resentative 1 of the students of
America; however, although I
contribute to the NSA through
my ASSU fees, I have neve r
been asked my opinions on any
matter discussed at the conven
tion.
Neither have I had the op
portunity — supposedly basic
to our society — to elect the
"representatives" which Stan
ford has sent to the national
convention. Whom or what do
they represent?
I have noticed in a number
of Daily articles that several
reputable institutions of higher
learning have recently with
drawn from the NSA. Perhaps
the students in those institu
tions have been better in
formed than we?

• Rush Obligation
Editor, The Daily:
.... The justifiable repri
mand of this particular frater
nity |Zeta Psi | has raised much
more meaningful questions
questions which bring to light
the meaning of the existence

of the fraternity system at
Stanford.
We regret the extreme posi
tion taken by some individuals
who assert that the fraternities
do not serve, nor could ever
serve a useful purpose in the
total education of the student.
To solve the present problems
by abolishing fraternities is
merely expedient; the answer
lies within the system.
.... Every living group, in
eluding fraternities, must both
accommodate and encourage
the increasing activism an d
awareness of the Stanford stu
dents if the living group is to
remain a vital part of th e
Stanford community.
Some fraternities have made
a sincere but incomplete begin
ning in this direction. Most
fraternities have abolished
such anachronisms as he 11
week, degrading initiations,
etc.; but vestiges remain. Pro
grams with guest professors
are presented, but not enough.
.... We affirm that we are
committed to the fraternity
system with its many distinc
tive merits and have faith in
its ability to adjust to th e
changing attitudes and values
of the student community. The
freshmen participating in rush
this year have a challenging
obligation to confront the fra
ternities without hesitation
with the ideals which they
have assimilated from the Wil
bur experience.
.... If the trend of change
in the fraternities can be con
tinued, the fraternity system
can assert itself as a meaning
ful alternative of upper-class
living available at Stanford.
