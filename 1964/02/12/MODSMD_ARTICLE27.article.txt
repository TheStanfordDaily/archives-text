## Gold water Calls For Victory In Cold War 
### Darryl R. Wold 
"Why not victory? asks Barry Goldwater, and most good Lib
erals recoil in fear; fear not only of an imagined impending threat
of war, but of Goldwater, for lie demonstrates a resolve that they
don't have. But this reaction stems at least partly from misunder
standing of what Conservatives mean by "victory'' in the cold
war.
The goal is not, and cannot be, as any reasonable man must
admit, a military victory over the Soviet Union itself. "Victory
over communism, writes Senator John G. Tower, "will be achieved
when the Soviet Union and its allies renounce their aims to re
make man and to conquer the world.
That Communism will someday abandon its aggressive policies
is almost an implicit assumption of the left wing, all the way
from those who advocate coexistence and cooperation until that
millenium when Communism becomes like us, to those w ho advo
cate immediate unilateral disarmament to encourage Russia to do
the same.
The latter course, though, would undoubtedly be suicidal, and
tlu» former has demonstrably failed over the past fifteen years.
A policy of sometimes compromise, sometimes retreat, will always
be a backward movement.
The Conservative believes, though, that only if our programs
are founded on a policy of victory will Communism be made to
renounce its goals of world domination, at least in practice, il
not explicitly.
★ ★ *
Only if it is clear to Russia and China that we will resist every
aggressive move they make, and will ourselves take the initiative
if they continue to press their present policies, will they think
twice about spreading subversion around the world, and take our
specific warnings seriously.
But if we ourselves don't have the necessary determination, we
can hardly expect nations that depend on us for their survival to
have it. When we fight for a while and then form a coalition
government with the Communists, is it little wonder that South
Viet Nam half-heartedly prosecutes a war that should never have
reached its borders? Until the nations of the world are convinced
that we ourselves are prepared to take a positive course of action
against Communism, we can hardly expect them to always be firm
in their resistance.
Instituting this positive policy doesn't mean a shooting war.
Senator Goldwater has advocated an offensive on three fronts:
economic, political, and psychological.
This latter is especially important to convince other nations ol
our belief in the lightness of our system, and our determination
to do whatever is necessary to protect it.
Specific programs beg to be developed in fuller detail. But
the starting point is a new determination to win. This w ill not
be easy; it is always easier to compromise and retreat than to say,
"110 further or we fight," and to actually take the offensive our
selves. But we have made this difficult choice before when our
freedom and the freedom of the world was threatened, and we
must make it again.

Only if it is clear to Russia and China that we will resist every

But if we ourselves don't have the necessary determination, we
can hardly expect nations that depend on us for their survival to
have it. When we fight for a while and then form a coalition
government with the Communists, is it little wonder that South
Viet Nam half-heartedly prosecutes a war that should never have
reached its borders? Until the nations of the world are convinced
that we ourselves are prepared to take a positive course of action
against Communism, we can hardly expect them to always be firm
in their resistance.
Instituting this positive policy doesn't mean a shooting war.
Senator Goldwater has advocated an offensive on three fronts:
economic, political, and psychological.
This latter is especially important to convince other nations ol
our belief in the lightness of our system, and our determination
to do whatever is necessary to protect it.
Specific programs beg to be developed in fuller detail. But
the starting point is a new determination to win. This w ill not
be easy; it is always easier to compromise and retreat than to say,
"110 further or we fight," and to actually take the offensive our
selves. But we have made this difficult choice before when our
freedom and the freedom of the world was threatened, and we
must make it again.

"Why not victory? asks Barry Goldwater, and most good Lib
erals recoil in fear; fear not only of an imagined impending threat
of war, but of Goldwater, for lie demonstrates a resolve that they
don't have. But this reaction stems at least partly from misunder
standing of what Conservatives mean by "victory'' in the cold
war.
The goal is not, and cannot be, as any reasonable man must
admit, a military victory over the Soviet Union itself. "Victory
over communism, writes Senator John G. Tower, "will be achieved
when the Soviet Union and its allies renounce their aims to re
make man and to conquer the world.
That Communism will someday abandon its aggressive policies
is almost an implicit assumption of the left wing, all the way
from those who advocate coexistence and cooperation until that
millenium when Communism becomes like us, to those w ho advo
