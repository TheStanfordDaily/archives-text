# Blood Drive Nets 111 Pints
## 
### BOB HJORING 
Over a hundred students
came to the campus-wide
blood drive co-sponsored yes
terday by tin* Student Health
Commission and A-IMii-O.
Most of the ill pints of
blond received were given to
the Peninsula Memorial Blood
Bank in return for "credit."
This credit will allow injured
Stanford students to obtain
blood for only a small service
charge. Donors were not ob
liged to credit their blood to
the Associated Students' ac
count.
Robin Tuchler, chairman of
the Student Health Commit

tee, said that although he
would have liked to have seen
more response, this year's in
take was about as expected.
Junipero House won a tra
veling service plaque for the
largest donation in Wilbur
llall. They gave six of the
total twenty-four pints from
Wilbur.
Thirty-four donors were re
jected for reasons ranging
from stow pulse to colds to
forgetting their permission
slips.
.All was not grim, however.
A man and liis wife cheered
the scene with a race to sec
who could give a pint fastest.
The man won.
