# Scientists And Statesmen Interact On Policy: Finer
## 
### DAVID BARNUM 
Without the amenities of ap
plied science, visiting political
science professor Herman Finer
told a large Dinkelspiel audience
last night, "Man would be like a
baby in the Stone Age." But the
choice of political systems which
Western Civilization made in the
17th Century, namely democracy,
he went on. has meant that scien
tific discovery and advice must
be channeled through and applied
by the statesmen.
The anxieties resulting from
the outcome of wartime nuclear
research the atomic bomb
and the use to which that weapon
was put. have caused the scientist
to realize and often regret the so
cial and political implications of

| his work. Indeed, he said, those
| implications are greater than
ever before, and virtually neces
sitate the mediation of states
; men.
SCIENCE in itself has no mean-1
ing, he said. It supplies us with
the facts, which", when combined;
with values, constitute the an-,
I swers to questions of policy. But,
it is the statesman who must de
fine the purposes to which scien
tific discovery shall be put.
Ideally. Finer said, everyone
[should know everything about
everything. But in complex mod
ern society such omniscience is
clearly infeasible. Thus the task
|of modern civilization is to find
la workable relationship whereby
] science can quickly and accu
! rat el y be brought to bear on im
pending policy decisions.
As an example of this sort of
J interaction Finer cited the letter
I which Einstein, Fermi, Szilard,
and other scientists addressed to
! Franklin Roosevelt in 1939, in
which they warned him of the
imminence of German mastery of j
nuclear weapons systems.
SELDOM can someone who has:
devoted his life to science fully j
comprehend the vagaries of hu-1
man behavior, the requisites of
the.exercise of power, and the sub
telies of history. This, he noted,
| is the statesman's province and
j expertise. And in a democracy.
' where final decisions are left to
simple numbers majorities
the statesman must have the last
word.
Society must therefore be or
ganized, he concluded, in such a
way as to permit scientists a high
degree of omnipresence and im
mediacy, so that their advice can
be ever at the statesman's finger
tips.

Without the amenities of ap
plied science, visiting political
science professor Herman Finer
told a large Dinkelspiel audience
last night, "Man would be like a
baby in the Stone Age." But the
choice of political systems which
Western Civilization made in the
17th Century, namely democracy,
he went on. has meant that scien
tific discovery and advice must
be channeled through and applied
by the statesmen.
The anxieties resulting from
the outcome of wartime nuclear
research the atomic bomb
and the use to which that weapon
was put. have caused the scientist
to realize and often regret the so
cial and political implications of

| his work. Indeed, he said, those
| implications are greater than
ever before, and virtually neces
sitate the mediation of states
; men.
SCIENCE in itself has no mean-1
ing, he said. It supplies us with
the facts, which", when combined;
with values, constitute the an-,
I swers to questions of policy. But,
it is the statesman who must de
fine the purposes to which scien
tific discovery shall be put.
Ideally. Finer said, everyone
[should know everything about
everything. But in complex mod
ern society such omniscience is
clearly infeasible. Thus the task
