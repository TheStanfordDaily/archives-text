## 
### 
Prof. Robert N. Bush announced
I today that the Stanford School
| of Education will launch a new
tcacher training program in June
built around an internship and
continued functional, profession
al prepartion.
Dr. Bush, in an address before
a Stanford alumni conference,
sairl the program calls for in
| creased enrollment in the grad-
I uate school and will result in
I awarding a combined masters do
; gree in education and a second
-1 ary credential after four quarters
of graduate work. The results of
two studies lasting a number of
years have been incorporated in
the reform, he said.
I>|{. Hl'Sll is outgoing chair
man of the National Education
'Association's influential National
Commission on Teacher Educa
tion and Professional Standards,
which recently completed a mas
i sive national survey.

Quoting from this report, he
I told the alumni group: "Each fu
ture teacher brings with him to
the campus a different back
ground of formal study and ex
perience. His college program
needs to be individually and sys
tematically planned for him."
"THE IDEAL pattern for a fu
ture teacher's education should
include a wide, general 'liberal
arts' education, covering such
studies as English and one for
eign language, literature, fine
arts and music, social and be
havioral sciences, physical and
life sciences, as well as health
and physical education."
He explained that this should
be spread over a five-year rather
! than the standard four-year span,
he explained, so that tic student's
| professional courses in education
1 and internship can be designed to
give lii mthc skill, knowledge and
i confidence he needs to begin Ills
i career as a teacher."
