• Scranton Hurts Chances
HARRISBURG, Pa. — Pennsylvania's Gov.
William W. Scranton has risked his blossoming
presidential statue and the prestige of his
office in a sharp attack on the state's unem
ployment compensation laws.
Amid all the talk about his qualifications
as a Republican presidential nominee, the 46-
year-old governor demanded a $35-million-a
-year increase in payroll taxes and an equal re

duction in benefits to replenish the state's un
employment compensation reserve fund.
His program, laid down in a speech Tues
day before a joint assembly of the State Lef
islature, seemed certain to wreck bipartisan
support in the legislature and alienate labor.
He told the lawmakers that the unemploy

going bankrupt. He referred to those oppos
