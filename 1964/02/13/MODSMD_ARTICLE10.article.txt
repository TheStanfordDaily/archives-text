### RON DeFELICE 
Yesterday's Greek Week activi-
I lies included an IFC-sponsored
program entitled "A Look at Fra
il emities" at 4:15 p.m. in Dinkel
; spiel Auditorium. Speakers for
i the program, H. Donald Winbig
! ler, Dean of Students, and th e
Rev. C. Edward Crowther, chap
lain at UCLA, faced a disappoint
ingly small crowd.
Rev. Crowther in his speech en
titled "The Privilege of Respon
sibility," addressed himself to the
question of whether fraternities
have any clearly delineated reason
for existence. "At UCLA, at least."
he noted, "the rest of the Univer
sity has left the fraternities and
I sororities far behind" in its ap

rproaeh to the challenges of our
era.
American university students,
according to Crowther, "are per
haps the most overprivileged sec
tion in I lie world." They are privi
leged in the degree to which they
are free. By contrast, Crowther
pointed out the limitations to the
freedom of a Negro in New Or
lean's ghetto.
On the other hand, the privi
leges of the American college stu
dent include "the privilege of re
sponsible citizenship." As "respon
sible citizens the students must
j prepare himself to attack the
problems of the Twentieth Cen
tury. poverty, deprivation of civil
right, the threat of atomic war.
He must learn to think of privi
j lege as "something which in-
I creases as it is given away."
Dean Winbigler, in his short ad
dress, outlined what he thought
were the most important features
of a fraternity. High on his list
were comfortable accommoda
tions, pleasant meals to serve as
"catalysts for stimulating conver
sation" and intellectual challenge.
I A fraternity should also have "a
| high regard for organized society"
and respect for the individual,
| which includes the cultivation of
I his highest potential.
