# Wert Calls For 'Flow Of Ideas'
## Experimentation Must Continue 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Staff Editor 
Intensified experimentation with
new educational concepts and
ideas is the key to future improve
ment of Stanford's academic pro
gram, in the opinion of Robert J.
Wert, Vice-Provost and newly ap
pointed Dean of Undergraduate
Education.
Bui "revolutionary reforms in
complex universities are noil her
very possible nor very desirable,"
he added.
IN HIS FIRST campus-wide
talk since being named dean in
November, Wert emphasized thai
"the future vitality of Stanford's
undergraduate education will
rest upo 11 whether ideas flow
freely within the Stanford com
munity."
The new office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Education can pro
vide a sounding board for n e w
ideas of all kinds, Wert continued.
"Continuous attention will be de
voted to the improvement of un
dergraduate education" and to the
financing of such improvements.
THE NEW undergraduate dean
will work closely with each of the
deans and administrative offices
now involved in this area.
Wert stressed the folly inherent
in imposing "revolutionary"
changes onto a university. "Any
one of us might dream, like Wal
ter Mitty, of imposing our obvi
ously superior blueprint for edu
cational perfection upon an entire
institution. . . . Such radical re
form is definitely not indicated al
Stanford. Instead there should be
constant, pervasive, relatively
small-scale testing and appraisal
of new ideas.
"IF EVIDENCE demonstrates
that new ideas are better than the
old," continued Wert, "they will
surely become a part of the fabric
of undergraduate education."
Turning to problems of curric
ulum, Wert condemned the "pro
fessional curriculum manipula
tors." When the curriculum has
become deified, the college has
become deadly. When the profes
sor is subordinate to the syllabus,
the common denominator becomes
mediocrity."
THE REAL PROBLEM, Wert
continued, "is to insure that the
talents ot superior faculty mem
bers ait? used most effectively to
educate students who wish to
learn." A department must take
into account the varying teaching
interests and leaching capabilities
of its faculty and be willing to re
cruit new faculty to correct de
partment weaknesses, Wert said.

become deified, the college has
become deadly. When the profes

educate students who wish to
learn." A department must take

interests and leaching capabilities
of its faculty and be willing to re
cruit new faculty to correct de
