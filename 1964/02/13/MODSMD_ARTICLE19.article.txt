# Swimmers To Face SC, UCLA
## 
### PETE CALLAWAY 
The Stanford swimmers will
I face their greatest hurdle of the
season this Friday and Saturday
in Los Angeles when they.meet
USC and UCLA.
Stanford doesn't reiish meeting
j USC as the Southern Califoria
| swimmers are currently NCAA
i champions, and could very well re
peal last year's performance.
POSSIBLY THE best of the
Trojans is Bob Bennett, a power
ful swimmer who placed first in
the NCAA 100-yard backstroke
and set a new NCAA record of
53.8 in that event. Bennett holds
freshman records in the 100-yard
backstroke, 54.8, and 200-yard but
terfly, 2:01.2, and is also the
AAWU 100-yard and 200-yard
backstroke champion.
Another outstanding swimmer
for Troy is Bill Craig, who de-

I feated Indiana's world record
I holder, Chet Jastremski, for the
National AAIJ outdoor 100-meter
breaststroke crown last year. In
addition he took the AAIJ indoor
100-meter breaststroke title in
1:10.2.
Roy Saari, who swims free
style and individual medley for
the Trojans, was named by Amer
ican Swimmer magazine as the
outstanding male swimmer of
1963. He is USA indoor ciiampion
in the 500-yard and 1,650-yard free
style, and was Pan American
Games champion in the 400 and
1,500-meter freestyle events last
summer, setting new Games rec
ords in both events.
STILL ANOTHER fast Trojan
swimmer is Rich McGeagh, co
holder of the world record of
1:00.9 for the 100-meter back
storke. In the 1963 National In
door AAU meet, he finished sec
ond in the 200-yard individual med
ley, and third in the 100 and 200-
yard backstroke. He also won
the National AAU outdoor 100-
meter backstroke crown last year
in a time of 1:01.7.
Perry Lindberg, a freestyler

I from Stockholm, Sweden, clinched
USC's 1963 NCAA title by up
setting Yale's Mike Austin in the
100-yard freestyle. He also fin
ished fifth in the 50-yard freestyle,
fourth in the 200-yard freestyle,
and anchored second place for the
j 400-yard freestyle relay team.
Other top swimmers competing
for the Trojans will be co-captain
Jim Corfman, freestyle; Brian
j Foss, butterfuly and freestyle; and
I Tom Warrren, freestyle and in
dividual medley.
STANFORD'S COACH Jim
j Gaughran, feels that the 400-yard
1 medley relay will he a key event
and hopes his mermen can came
out of the relay victorious. He is
also counting an Elkka Suvanto
to win the 200 and 500-yard free
style., For Stanford to have a
chance of upsetting USC, Petti
grew. Hull and Gildea will also
have to be in top form.
If the Indians can get past USC,
they should have an easy time of
it with UCLA Saturday, as
UCLA's four best swimmers, Dave
Ashleigh, Dan Brown, Ron Kauf
man and Bob Orton cannot match
Stanford's st rength.
