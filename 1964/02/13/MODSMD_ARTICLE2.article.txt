# Magic Of Mrs. Tan
## 
### HILDA KOSSOFF 
The sunlight is growing in
a world of magic mist ati<l
mountains. Tliro n g li tin*
gnarled branches of a cyprus
gleams a remote and sha
dowed land. Children of an
other mood, hold hlack t'isli
chase earh other down a nar
row panel, and two hlne ele-

phants stand affectionately
shoulder to shoulder.
Such scenes leap front the
swift brush of Joan (hang
Tan, whose work is now on
display at the International
Center. Her style is a blend
of traditional Chinese and
modern Western — with a
dash of Joan Tan.
ALTHOUGH most of her
current work is in large-brush
water-colors, Mrs. Tan is de
veloping her own techniques.
For instance, a blade of bam
boo dipped in paint produces
a sharp, abrupt line. Drawn
in this medium a subject
seems captured in the midst
of rapid motion. Bamboo
stick flowers quiver as in a
stiff breeze.
Casting about for a way to
explain tlie bamboo method,
the artist demonstrated in
mid air with the end of a car
key. "1 could even use this,"
she laughed merrily. "I can

use anything."
Mrs. Tan, now a round
faced, black-haired graii d
mother in her fifties, first be
gan preparing for her ulti
mate career as a little girl of
7. Daughter of an aristocratic
family of Shantung province
in northern China, she spent
long hours mastering Chinese
calligraphy.
THE BRUSH control she
gained then is necessary to
her present style, which em
phasizes speed and grace. In
one of her favorite tech
niques, wash on wet rice
paper, every stroke must be
quick and sure — there is
no way to correct an error.
Even the water must he care
fully applied to the paper,
as it governs the way t he
colors flow into each other.
Her earliest paintings were
almost too controlled. There
are a few sedate, Sunday
painter type oils hanging in
the I-Center to show how far
her work has grown.
Mrs. Tan's is now a glad,
free art, occasionally falling
into sweetness but at its best
summoning the viewer lo
walk in imagination through
mist-hidden glades under half
seen trees.
MOST OF THE pieces are
purely decorative — restful
landscapes or smart flowers
— designed to grace a room
and be lived with easily.
Mrs. Tan took up painting
only after she came to Amer
ica in 1950. She has studied
from many Bay Area artists,
including Stanford Art and
Education professor Daniel
Mendelowitz. On a visit to
Taiwan in 1959, she was a
student of Ru Yu, brother of
the last Emperor of China.
This showing, which will
last till the end of the month,
is Mrs. Tan's 15th one-man
show in the area. Her clouded
landscapes and crisp flowers
have won her 7 awards so far.

7. Daughter of an aristocratic
family of Shantung province
in northern China, she spent
long hours mastering Chinese
calligraphy.
THE BRUSH control she
gained then is necessary to
her present style, which em
phasizes speed and grace. In
one of her favorite tech
niques, wash on wet rice
paper, every stroke must be
quick and sure — there is
no way to correct an error.
Even the water must he care
fully applied to the paper,
as it governs the way t he
colors flow into each other.
Her earliest paintings were
almost too controlled. There
are a few sedate, Sunday
painter type oils hanging in
the I-Center to show how far
her work has grown.
Mrs. Tan's is now a glad,
free art, occasionally falling
into sweetness but at its best
summoning the viewer lo
walk in imagination through
mist-hidden glades under half
seen trees.
MOST OF THE pieces are
purely decorative — restful
landscapes or smart flowers
— designed to grace a room
and be lived with easily.
Mrs. Tan took up painting
only after she came to Amer
ica in 1950. She has studied
from many Bay Area artists,
including Stanford Art and
Education professor Daniel
Mendelowitz. On a visit to
Taiwan in 1959, she was a
student of Ru Yu, brother of
the last Emperor of China.
This showing, which will
last till the end of the month,
is Mrs. Tan's 15th one-man
show in the area. Her clouded
landscapes and crisp flowers
have won her 7 awards so far.


Chinese—Modern AH
The sunlight is growing in
a world of magic mist ati<l
mountains. Tliro n g li tin*
gnarled branches of a cyprus
gleams a remote and sha
dowed land. Children of an
other mood, hold hlack t'isli
chase earh other down a nar
row panel, and two hlne ele-

phants stand affectionately
shoulder to shoulder.
Such scenes leap front the
swift brush of Joan (hang
Tan, whose work is now on
display at the International
Center. Her style is a blend
of traditional Chinese and
modern Western — with a
dash of Joan Tan.
ALTHOUGH most of her
current work is in large-brush
water-colors, Mrs. Tan is de
veloping her own techniques.
For instance, a blade of bam
boo dipped in paint produces
a sharp, abrupt line. Drawn
in this medium a subject
seems captured in the midst
of rapid motion. Bamboo
stick flowers quiver as in a
stiff breeze.
Casting about for a way to
explain tlie bamboo method,
the artist demonstrated in
mid air with the end of a car
key. "1 could even use this,"
she laughed merrily. "I can

use anything."
