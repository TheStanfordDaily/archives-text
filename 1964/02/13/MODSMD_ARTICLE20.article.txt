## Frosh Test Cat's Cubs 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The Stanford Frosh and the
California Cubs, both improving
and both trying to reach the .500
mark, will face each other in two
games this weekend. The first
game will be Friday night at Cal
prior lo the varsity game, and
Saturday night everybody will
switch to the Stanford homeeourt.
The Cubs started slowly this
season hut have come on strong
winning their last two games by
20 points. A factor in their resur
gence has been guard Mike Jacobs
who has averaged a consistent 17
points for the last three games.
Cal is also lead by jumping jack
guard Charlie Perkins. Perkin's
spring causes his coach to place
the 6-2 former center at low post
often during the course of the
game.
BESIDES THE two guar d s
Cal depends heavily on 6-8 Gary
Cornellius, who is averaging 10
points a game, and seven foot
John Wardell. who snatched IK
rebounds his lasl time out. These
two boys each play half the time
at center. Also on the front line

Cal has 6-5 Roy Masonheimer and
equally tall Tony Pazaricky.
The Cubs' decided height ad
vantage could be a decisive factor
in the game, especially at the
guards. If the Cubs move their
taller guards inside, Stanford's
front line will have to drop off
to help, thus leaving someone open
outside.
Cal is much like Stanford in
the type of ball they play, using
a good man to man defense
and a slow ball control offense,
which relies on board control.
THE STANFORD starting line
up will be as usual except for for
ward Don Ray. Off of last week
end's 15 point, 12 rebound effort,
Coach Turner has decided to start
the 6-5 forward in the hopes he
will be able to offset some of the
Cal heighl advantage. Other start
ers for the Frosh will be Rill Kel
so, 6-3; Brock Gowdy, 6-7; Barry
Rapp. 6-1; and Tom Nisbet, 5-8.
St. Mary's frosh have been the
only opponent both teams have
played. Cal easily defeated the
Gaels by ten points while Stan
ford almost blew an 11 point lead
to win by 1 point.
