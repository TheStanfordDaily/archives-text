# Wrestlers Win Some Battles, But They Lose The Meet
## 
### 
The Stanford wrestling team,
won just as many matches as the* |
San Jose State Spartans Tuesday!
night, dropping the first four and
winning the second four. But they
lost the meet, It!-12.
Facing lho toughest team of the
! season to date, the trouble with
the Indians was that they simply
weren't able to pin anybody, while
! the Spartans pinned two ,taking
advantage of some injury-caused
weaknesses in the Tribe's lessor
weights. The Cards thus were
i down 10 points before they could
even win a match.
GEORGE MUSS MR was caught
with his shoulders down in the
first match at 123 pounds; Tim
Davis put up somewhat more of
a fight at 130 but was decisioned
10-."); Dependable Dick Anderson,
wrestling at 137 rather than his
normal 123, gave up too much
weight and was downed 9-5; and
Jerry Smith, at 147, grappled for
1:47 before being pinned.
From then on, all the action was
Stanford's. The Indians fought
j back.
Phil Kendall, who gained t h e
| first pin of his intercollegiate
i career against Cal Poly, tried hard
to make it two in a row against
San Jose. But he had to settle for
a clear-cut 6-3 decision, although
he dominated the 157 pound match
throughout.
TWO WRESTLERS drew spe
cial praise for improvement from
Coach Bill Leland: Steve Schaum
i at 167, and Tom Allen at 177.
j Against the Spartans Schaum
I routed his opponent 14-3. Allen
won by a lesser margin, 7-2, but
just about as convincingly.
In the last contest of the eve
ning, burly Duncan Ross, who al
though tipping the scales at 211
still manges to give away 20 to
30 pounds in most of his heavy
weight competition, won against
a heavier opponent at San Jose on
a close 5-4 decision.
Coach Leland was pleased over
1he improvement of his squad,
claiming that ihey are now "al
most unrecognizable" compared
to the team that started off the
year. "The boys have been work
ing hard, and showed a lot of
improvement against San Jose
State, by far the most capable
team we've seen so far this sea

. son."
THK J.V.-FROSH malm on
pulled out a 14-13 victory over
; their San Jose counterparts. Look
ing good in winning matches for
J the Indians were Pete Ryan, at
1130, and Ray Burgard at 157.
Next action for the varsity
comes this Saturday when they
! face a tough UCLA loam which,
Leland claims, is "better than
the San Jose State team."
The Ucians boast two great
competitors in Rabim Javanmard, |
who placed fourth in the nationals
last year, and Gary Sarwems, who
also gained victories last year in
national competition.
AGAINST THIS formidable op
position, the Indians will throw a
completely healthy first team, for
one of the few times this season,
with everyone wrestling at their
best weights. Action will begin
at the Encina Gym at 2:30 p.m.
