Editor, The Daily:
I'm afraid kind sir, you did not
quote me properly. I said nothing
about keeping America, Ameri
can.
While your suggestion is apro
pos to that, you said it, not me!
You speak of my being senile.
That's much better than being
abusive and unprincipled, as you
seem to be. You show vile dis
respect for criterion and th e
things we Old Timers fought for.
Two wars of it. To protect you
young infidels. Shame on you for
what you have said in the Daily.
American society is made up—
as you say, of many, many Na
tionalities. But. we prefer the
types that behave and do not bite
the hands that feed them. Those
that respect and protect our heri-1
tages, those we love very much.
Each generation damns the
others but whipper snappers seem
to converge on those that would
keep our traditions alive and our
womanhood clean and whole
some!
Vindictiveness as you havej
shown, chum, won't get you any !
place, either with me or the gen-!
oral public. It' you are a student
I'll bet you get wobbly marks in ;
your studies. If you are an ordi- j
nary citizen, which I doubt, you
show rare instability. You ask
that we give back to other Nations :
that which we have bought and
paid for. Are you jealous that wc
profited by these exchanges of
real estate. Pal? What about the!
profits system the commy dislike 1
so much. Haven't they patterned
their business systems after ours |
here? They accept wheat and give
us what in return "We'll bury!
you."
Controversies I like. Mimics I j
condone. But, guys like you sir, !
give me aches and pains in my ;
Criterions.
