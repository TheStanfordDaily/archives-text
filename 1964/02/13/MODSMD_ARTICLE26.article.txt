# Role of ASSU

Hditor, The Daily:
I wonder at times what relation
the phrase "Associated Students"
has to the Stanford community.
This community surely contains
students, faculty members, and
administrators, but the boundar
ies between these groups seem
rather shallow.
We must account for the stu
dents who act as teaching assist
ants, instructors who are taking
courses, or doing group research,
administrators who are teaching
(of is that teachers who are ad
ministrating?), and horror of all
things, administrators who actu
ally study and take courses. These
people seem either to have the
right to enjoy the privileges of
any of their varied affiliations, or
no right to any rights.
Consider the position of the
officers of the Associated Stu
dents. The Associated Students is
a department of the University
(although the financial adminis
trators of the University some
times wish it wasn't). Therefore,
the administrators of the ASSU
are members of the administration
of the University. The line be
tween groups becomes thinner!
Okay, so we're one big, some
limes happy family. So what? As
a family we should recognize the
family hierarchy, and the respon
sibilities and rights of each in
dividual. As a department cover
ing the "Associated Students," the
ASSU should look to see that it is
fulfilling its responsibility before
it criticizes other departments.
Also, it should cooperate with
other departments to fulfill the
goals and to realize the ambitions
of the University as a whole.
If the ASSU continues to act
as a miscast character, extempo
rizing its lines, 1 should predict
that the University will grow i
around it.and swallow it. But if
it recognizes its limitations with
in the community, and realizes the
potential within these limits, I
am sure that "Daddy University"
will extend the privileges and
scope of this department.
