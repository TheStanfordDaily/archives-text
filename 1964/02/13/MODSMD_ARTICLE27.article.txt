## The 						U.S. And Panama Construct Second Canal 
### STEFAN T. POSSONY 
THE QUESTION: Should
(lie United States get out
of Panama? What posi
tion should the United
States take there?

The rumbles at Panama are parts of the
struggle for control of the Caribbean. We
might admit to the "aggression" of which we
are accused and settle in Panama to the full
satisfaction of President Chiari. The struggle
would be resumed forthwith in Panama itself
or somewhere else, until the communists con
trol the Isthmus or we stop the cold war in
the Caribbean theater by removing the Cuban
threat.
A relentless and protracted offensive waged
by a skillful revolutionary strategist like Castro
cannot be countered by a passive wait-and-see
policy. Far from reducing the danger ot war,
our policy of inaction only increases it. The
longer we delay making the painful decision
to eliminate the main de-stabilizing factor at
Havana, the more bloody and dangerous the
presently limited or "sub-limited Caribbean
struggle will become.
The Canal was an integral part of U.S. de
fenses and economic life in the age of the bat
leship, and it is even more necessary to us
now than it was forty years ago.
Panama can neither operate the Canal nor
provide for its security. II the U.S. were to
abandon its rights, operations would either
pass into incompetent hands or the Canal
would be managed by an international con
sortium. Thus, in one way or the other, a vital
element of our life (not just an "interest")
would fall under foreign and partially hostile
domination. A U.S. capitulation would stimu
late, but not stop, the communist offensive.
Therefore Washington was well advised when
it announced that we would not give up our
title. Let us hope this resolve will remain
strong.
As I interpret the provisions of our treaty
with the Republic of Panama, the essential
point is that we are authorized to control the
installations, whereas Panama is entitled to
reap the fullest economic benefits from the
Canal traffic. This is the nub of the problem
—disputes about sovereignty and flags are just
"brownie points lor agitators. Ihe whole com
plex should be reviewed by a commission of
experts, and improvements of the administra
tive mechanism through which Panama's inter
ests can be represented, should be legislated—
unilateral U.S. executive concessions must be
avoided.
A second canal has become necessary: Even
now the Canal cannot be used by large car
riers and tankers. Some time after 1970, peak
capacity will be reached and further growth
of traffic wi 11 be blocked. Washington has been
considering the problem for many years, yet
hesitates to make concrete proposals: the new
canal must be built by means of nuclear in
dustrial explosives. Wc are nicely hoist on our
own propaganda petard . . .
With nuclear explosives we are no longer
restricted to building another "canal with
locks and complicated installations, but are
able to construct a wide and deep waterway
at sea level. Such a waterway presumably
need not be run by a well-capitalized and com
petent technical agency. Hence there may be
a possibility that the second "canal could be
come an international waterway like the
Straits of Gibraltar.
We must look toward the future; and much
of the Caribbean's future is tied to a sea level
waterwax connecting the Atlantic and the Pa
cific. Hence it is advisable to commence de
tailed planning and negotiations about the
construction site. Presumably Panama has a
prior claim, but we also have a right-of-way
arrangement with Nicaragua.
The time has come to demonstrate the feasi
bility and usefulness of nuclear "plowshare
techniques and to show their applicability to
unsolved hemispheric problems. The establish
ment of an agency for the plowshare con
struction of an Isthmian waterway seems to
be in order.
There are genuine oportunities for truly
progressive American initiatives that would be
of real benefit to all the Americas. Unfortu
nately, very little progress can be expected
before the U.S. begins to enforce peace
throughout the Caribbean area.
