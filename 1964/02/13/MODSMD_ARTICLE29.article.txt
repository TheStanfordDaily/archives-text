# Internationalize The Canal Zone
## 
### THOMAS L. CRYSTAL 
The question of whether or not the United
States should or not get out of the Panama
Canal Zone is about as valid as asking Bour
bon King Louis XV whether or not his family
should leave France, or the French and Brit
ish whether or not they should turn over the
Suez Canal to the Egyptians. Although the
questions were posed, the answers were im
posed. In approximately the same manner, the
actions of the United States now called for
in the Panama Canal Zone are clearly obvious
to anyone capable of historic analysis and cm -
rent-day application.
Theodore Roosevelt boosted "1 took the
Canal Zone and let Congress debate; and while
the debate goes on the canal does also.' The
mores of the XIX Centun and United Stales
and world public opinion (outside ot Colum
bia) approved generally ot our sending the
U.S. cruisers Nashville, Dixie, and Wisconsin
and a battalion of Marines to midwife the in
dependence of Panama. Not a drop of blood,
Panamarian, Colombian or American sancti
fied the birth.
From 1903 let ns jump into 1963. The
United States paid $10 million cash to its
protege for ratifying the treaty Colombia
would not. The United States increased its
annual payments to Panama from $250,000 to
$1,930,000, and gave the mother, Colombia,
$25 million conscience money in 1923 for rea
sons that include some admissions of guilt,
it is somewhat hard for a skeptical world
today to look at our treaty of 1903 giving us
perpetual rights as if sovereign—but conceding
that we have no "titular sovereignty there—
when we pontificated so morally and inter
vened so militarily when the British and
French sought to preserve their treaty-blessed
rights at the Suez Canal in 1956. What makes
1964 so different from 1956? Possibly it is only
a question, not of principle, but of whose hog
is being gored?
Professor Ronald Hilton, Director of Stan
ford's Hispanic American Institute has stated
"It is extremely difficult tor Americans to re
alize that the Panama Canal has become in
the minds of Latin Americans a symbol of
humiliation comparable to the Berlin wall.
If this be so, to refuse to change the humiliat
ing conditions that produce the feeling, hardly
contributes to American hopes of winning the
Cold War in Latin America.
What are the humiliating conditions? In
simple terms they include the basic attitude
of superiority that 99 per cent of the Amer
icans who enter Panama feel toward their
hosts. Our Zonites theer obviously low down
on the Panamaians as second-class citizen of
an illicit oligarchy fraudulently claiming to
be democratic Republic.
Neither our diplomatic nor our military
chiefs there speak Spanish. There is also eco
nomic discrimination against Panamanians—
they do not get equal pay for equal work—
and a vast difference between Zone and Pana
manian living standards.
Professor James T. Watkins, together with
Martin Travis, said in "Control of the Panama
Canal: an Obsolete Shibboleth (Foreign Af
fairs, April 1959) "A strom is building up in
Panama. . . . The conflict cannot be resolved
on a national basis, either American or Pana
manian. Control of the Canal by the United
States, though supported by law, tradition and
vast military power, will not be able to with
stand the pressure of modern nationalism.
The events of January 1964 have unfortu
nately proven their 1959 assessment of the
obvious situation in Panama vis-a-vis the Canal
Zone to be all-to-correct. 1 suggest it would
be better for us to renegotiate a new treaty
now gracefully, or internationalize the Canal
now in such a manner as to preserve the real
privileges we truly want (and these have
nothing at all to do with flag-flying). We
must do this while we can, before the power
of world opinion sends 190 million gringos
packing north in discredited dismay due to
the obvious justice arming the side ot I mil
lion Panamanian Americans.
