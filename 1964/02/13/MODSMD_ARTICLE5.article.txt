# Unity Aim Of Christians At Stanford
## Council Attempts To Draft Charter 
### 
Stanford Christian Council
| (SCO, a newly organized group
j which may eventually coordinate
fail campus Christian activities,
met last night to consider a cen
t ral charter.
SCC's purpose is to form a
single committee which could de
velop a unified voice for campus
Christian groups. Representatives
from SCC could then replace in
dividual denominational delegates
Dn the Council on Religious Af
fairs (CRA).
CRA is a committee made up
of students, faculty members, and
I religious organization advisers. It
i has the power of supervising all
i official religious affairs held on
| campus.
The creation of SCC would re
! move the diverse ropresenation
j from individual Christian groups
at Stanford on CRA and would
substitute a single delegation.
Such consolidation of Christian
views would present Christianity
as a unified faith. Discussion con
cerning Christian groups would
be held during SCC meetings, not
at CRA. CRA would thus become
a more interfaith committee, open
ing the way for a more open
view toward religion on campus.
AT PRESENT, SCC is still in
| the organizational stage. Two
! hours of last night's meeting were
I devoted to t ho phrasing of a char
; tcr presented at SCC's last meet
! ing. Because of insuffcient repre-
I sent at ion from various qualified
groups, all action at the meeting
was made in the form of unoffi
| cial recommendations to be pre
sented at its next meeting, sched
uled for Monday at 7:30 p.m.
