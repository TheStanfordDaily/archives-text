# SOUTH AFRICA
## Dilemma Without Solution 
### DIANE CHRISTENSEN IIR Africa Desk 
Today's conflict in South Africa
reflects the clash of two nations
which have evolved on the Afri
can continent. The only white
nation to have roots nowhere but
in Africa, the Afrikaner character
is the inevitable result of a defen
sive community of trckkers, at
tempting to survive against isola
t ion and hostile indigenous
peoples.
The Africans, living in the midst
of the greatest industrial complex
in Africa, "have suffered all the
disease oj a voiceless proleta
riat: overcrowding, unemploy
ment, malnutrition, squalor."
THUS SOUTH AFRIC A is a
dilemma with no clear and obvi
ous solution. While on one hand
it can bo said that Africans there
have a higher standard of living
than elsewhere in Africa, the enor
mous disparity between the in
comes of wealthy whites and im
poverished blacks is even further
aggravated by racial discrimina
tion and oppressive government
policies.
There are two major African
movements the African Na
tional Congress <ANC> and the
Pan-Africanist Congress (PACi
in addition to the Indian, Col
ored and liberal w bite groups
pressuring for an end to Afrikan
er domination. The ANC is the
older group, growing out of an
INS 4 Native Electoral Association,
and since 1946 has embraced a
policy of constant cooperation
with the Indian Congress. It has
organized protest stay-at-home
strikes, bus boycotts and a 10.i2
Defiance of Unjust Laws Cam
paign. Committed until recently
to a staunchly nonviolent form
of protest, its President Albert

Bel Prize.
AFRICANS now feel that a
non-revolutionary transfer of pow
er is impossible with the vastly
superior military, economic a n d
administrative powers held by
the Government. The question has
become one of what, kind of revo
lution: non-violence, sabotage or
terrorism?
Faced with an inevitable revo
lution brewing in South Africa,
the policies of the two major Afri
can parties the African Na
tional Congress (ANC) and the
Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC>
are sharply divided on several
questions. Charismatic leadership
of the West African pan-african
ist variety does not provide an
answer to the disunited and di
verse economic and political cle-

I ments in the African population.
Organizational problems are
difficult because a rousing call
for action only invites an imme
diate and often brutal police reac
tion. Africans often have more to
gain immediately from a coopera
tion with all-powerful authorities
than from a rebellion against
them. Formal education and in
dustrial experience is high among
South African blacks, and along
with this come sharp ideological
i differences of opinion among Afri
can leadership.
THi; PAC broke away from
i the ANC in 1959, under Ihe lead
ership of an African university
lecturer named Robert Sobukwe.
The split was for two reasons. The
first is the question of non-Afri
can participation in the struggle;
the second is the problem of non
alignment. Significant in both
issues is the South African Com-
I munist Party. Attempting si n ce
! 1920 to attract into its ranks non
whites as well as Europeans, it
; includes a respectable number of
i African members.
The new PAC claimed that the
j African National Congress was
I being dominated by non-African
members of these other groups,
lit was stressed that "the Commu
| nists were subjecting the move
-1 ment to doctrinal and tactical con
war priorities rather than from
local South African needs."
THi; KHSIKTANCH movement
!is confused and divided by the
South African Communists be
cause they insist that the struggle
j is essentially class-based and can
not proceed till "objective" eondi
; lions are right. The struggle for
the African involves political
rights for himself, Asians a n d
Colon reds. The economic rights
which he is also denied stem from
his lack of political freedom.
