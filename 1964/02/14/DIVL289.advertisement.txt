THE IMPORTANCE
OF TRUE LOVE
"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not
charity (love), I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
And though I have the gift of prophecy and understanding all mysteries,
and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that 1 could remove
mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though 1 bestow all
my goods to feed the poor, and though 1 give my body to be burned,
and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and
is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not pulled up.
Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily pro
voked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the
truth; Beareth all tilings, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
all things. Charity never faileth; but whether there by prophecies, they
shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be
knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy
in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in
part shall be done away. When I was achild, I spake as a child, I under
stood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man I put
away childish things. For now we see through a glass darkly; but then
face to lace; now I know in part; but then shall 1 know even as also
I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, eharity, these three; but
the greatest of these is el unity.' I Cor. 13.
