# 'Three Men On A Horse' Revives Zany Air Of Thirties
## 
### VIC MITCHELL 
The Stanford Players will pre
sent the thirties farce "Three Men
ou a Horse," in the Nitery theater-
Monday through Saturday at 8:30
p.m.
Herbert Kennedy, graduate stu
dent in the Department of Speech
and Drama, is the director of the
production. Kennedy wants plenty
of "thirties" in his production:
Beer was 5c a glass. Wages were
$40 a week. People were singing
"Tippy tippy tin, tippy tin." Lysle
stockings were the rage with Gar
bo hats and marcelled hair.
ADDED TO THE thirties angle
is the greeting-card pearly wis
dom that is dispensed throughout
the play. Perhaps the most inanely
amusing is Erwin Trowbridge's
composition to his Mother: "At
Christmastide your hair was gray,
But mem'ries chased your cares
away, Now lovingly in my simple
way, I send you love on Mother's
Day."
Kennedy has trained his cast to
take both the greeting card poetry
and the thirties all in good stride.

"Pace, very rapid pace, is essen
tial to a farce of this zany kind,"
commented the director. He has
held nonstop rehearsals almost
from the beginning, steaming
through the script like a freight
train and hopes that with full
houses and a "laugh-it-up" audi
ence the real fun of "Three Men
on a Horse" will come across.


TOM COLLINS, as Erwin the greeting card poet, is carted offstage
by a gang of Brooklyn horse-race dopers in "Three Men on a Horse."
