# Corps Senior Year Program To Open
## 
### 
A Pilot Peace Corps Senior
Year Program will get under way
this spring when 500 to 700 col
lege .juniors who have applied for
the Peace Corps will be invited
to a six-week summer training
program. After college gradua
tion in June 1965, they will under
go another period of Peace Corps
training (four to eight weeks)
before going overseas.
Peace Corps Director Sargent
Shriver said: "The Senior Year
Program represents a major ef
fort on our part to increase the
quality <»112 Peace Corps training
programs by encouraging juniors
to start training while they are
still in college. The main advan
tage is that the applicants can
plan for eventual Peace Corps
service. They might then revise
their senior year curriculums to
reflect their interest in a partic
ular kind of Peace Corps assign
ment. They will be able to ac
quire an increased foreign lan
guage facility. Further, they will
be able to devote their summers
to a career-related purpose at no
cost, while possibly obtaining ex
tra college credits. The additional
lead time will give the Peace
Corps a better opportunity to line
up overseas assignments appro
priate to the individual skills and
aptitudes of the applicants."
Negotiations are in process
with several colleges and univer
sities to conduct the training this
summer. At least six different
training programs are planned if
a sufficient number of junior stu

dent applicants qualify for them.
They are: Secondary school
teachers for English ■ speaking
Africa; Secondary school teach
ers for French-speaking Africa;
Urban community development
workers 112 or Spanish-speaking
Latin America; Rural community
development workers for Spanish
speaking Latin America; Teach
ers of English as a foreign lan
guage, and Applicants to learn
more difficult languages, such as
Thai, not ordinarily taught in
American colleges.
Trainees will return to their
own campus for their senior year.
They will bo encouraged to con
tinue their foreign language and
area studies on an individual

basis.
At both stages of training (be
fore and after the senior year),
there will be no cost to the
trainee. The Peace Corps will pro
vide room, board and pocket
money, plus a $75 monthly re
adjustment allowance.
Interested college junior should
immediately fill out a Peace
Corps Questionnaire, write on the
front of it "Senior Year Pro
gram," and submit this when they
take the Placement Test.
Juniors who are interested and
have already submitted Question
naires should indicate their inter
est by writing to the Division of
Selection, Peace Corps, Washing
ton, D.C. 20525. All applicants to

tho Senior Year Program should
have an up-to-date transcript of
college records mailed to the Div
ision of Selection and it they have
not already done so should lake
the Placement Test this Sunday
al 1:00 p.m. in Room 300, near
Engineering.
The method of selection for this
program will be similar to that
used for all Peace Corps applic
ants based on an evaluation
of tiie Questionnaire, Placement
Test scores and character refer
ences. The selection process will
continue during the summer
training program, with final selec
tion not made until tho end of
the second stage of training,
which takes place after college
graduation. If an applicant is not
selected for the Senior Year Pro
gram, his application will auto
matically be considered for reg
ular Peace Corps programs to be
gin after his graduation.
