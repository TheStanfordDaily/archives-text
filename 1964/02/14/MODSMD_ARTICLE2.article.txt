# SCIENTISTS AFLOAT
## SU's Answer To 'Kon Tiki' 
### JIM SELNA 
The alluring water of the South
Seas, pirates off the coast of Su
matra, and a long-lost link in the
evolutionary process- these were
some of the topics discussed by
Professor Rolf Bolin, chief scien
tist for the "To Vega." Stanford
ocean going marine laboratory.
Dr. Bolin in discussing the
travels of the ship showed a
series of slides illustrating the
work of the project. The "Te
Vega" is a 135-foot sailing ship
which belongs to a northern lum
ber concern. The ship is equipped
with a complete chemistry lab
and extensive electronic and me
terologieal equipment.
The "Te Vega" left Hopkins
Marine Laboratory at Monterey
last July 13 with twelve graduate
students, three faculty members
and a crew of 15 professional sea
men. Before the ship had finished
its 11,000 miles cruise to Singa
pore, it had visited Hawaii, Sa
moa, the Salomons, and other
island groups in the South Pa
cific.
The newsmen at the conference
expressed a definite admiration
for Dr. Bolin's work while they
viewed the alluring pictures of

the "easy life" in the islands. Dr.
Bolin took some of the glint out
of the reporter's dreams to ac
company him on the next voyage
when he showed shots of the "To
Vega" in rough seas.
The students aboard the ship
receive 15 units of graduate
credit for their work. They also
receive complete tuition as well
as a stipend for expenses from
the National Science Foundation.
Every three months a new group
is selected to study aboard the
ship.
At Singapore the student crew
was changed, and the vessel be
gan to survey the Indian Ocean
as part of a program organized
by the International Council of
Scientific Unions with support
from UNESCO.
The "Tc Vega's" second voyage
proved to quite harrowing. Dr.
Bolin told of sailing through
pirate-infested waters off the
coast of Sumatra. The pirates,
who are one part of the strained
relation between Malaysia and
Indonesia, patrol the straits sep
arating the two countries. The
"Tc Vega," armed with only a
shotgun and a rifle to kill speci
mens of birds, stayed close to the
Malaysian coast and encountered
no incidents.
On December S, the ship ran
into near tragedy when the prop
eller shaft for the ship's auxiliary
engine was ripped off, leaving a
hole in the housing. In an infor
mal narrative that Dr. Bolin
wrote on the trip he says, "We
were approaching known good
collecting grounds on Sipora (off
the west coast of Sumatra) when
there was a thump . . .
"We are now deprived of our
engine entirely dependent on said
in an area of little wind. As I
write we have been trying for
about 30 hours to make headway
toward Padang and have made
little or none."
After five days of little pro
gress. the ship was rescued by
a tug boat and towed into harbor.
The ship was repaired, and sup
plies were taken on.
The professor stressed the ed
ucational aspects of the cruise.
Unlike some expeditions, the
Stanford project is not interested
in any specialized area. Dr. Bolin
said that the ship stops "where it
finds something interest int. l .."

The second voyage ended Janu
ary 11 when the ship docked in
Clombo, Ceylon. Dr. Bolin flew
homo and will not be with the
cruise which will explore the
waters off the east coast of South
Africa. He plans to rejoin the
ship in three months.
The ship will be under the di
rection of Professor Dixy Lee
Ray of the University of Wash
ington. Of special interest is the
search for the latimeria. The
small fish, once thought to be
extinct, is a side branch of the
evolutionary process that pro
duced man.
The fish has two specialized
fins on its spine which are the
beginnings of the evolution of ver
tabrae. The fish is exceedingly
rare and none have ever been
kept alive in captivity.
Dr. Bolin who was formerly
connected with the science ex
hibit at the Seattle World's Fair,
also pointed out that one of the
purposes of the ship is to get
people to realize the significance
of the seas. The sea is still one of
man's few untapped natural re
sources.

last July 13 with twelve graduate
students, three faculty members
and a crew of 15 professional sea
men. Before the ship had finished
its 11,000 miles cruise to Singa
pore, it had visited Hawaii, Sa
moa, the Salomons, and other
island groups in the South Pa
cific.
The newsmen at the conference
expressed a definite admiration
for Dr. Bolin's work while they
viewed the alluring pictures of

the "easy life" in the islands. Dr.
Bolin took some of the glint out
of the reporter's dreams to ac
company him on the next voyage
when he showed shots of the "To
Vega" in rough seas.
The students aboard the ship
receive 15 units of graduate
credit for their work. They also
receive complete tuition as well
as a stipend for expenses from
the National Science Foundation.
Every three months a new group
is selected to study aboard the
ship.
At Singapore the student crew
was changed, and the vessel be
gan to survey the Indian Ocean
as part of a program organized
by the International Council of
Scientific Unions with support
from UNESCO.
The "Tc Vega's" second voyage
proved to quite harrowing. Dr.
Bolin told of sailing through
pirate-infested waters off the
coast of Sumatra. The pirates,
who are one part of the strained
relation between Malaysia and
Indonesia, patrol the straits sep
arating the two countries. The
"Tc Vega," armed with only a
shotgun and a rifle to kill speci
mens of birds, stayed close to the
Malaysian coast and encountered
no incidents.
On December S, the ship ran
into near tragedy when the prop
eller shaft for the ship's auxiliary
engine was ripped off, leaving a
hole in the housing. In an infor
mal narrative that Dr. Bolin
wrote on the trip he says, "We
were approaching known good
collecting grounds on Sipora (off
the west coast of Sumatra) when
there was a thump . . .
"We are now deprived of our
engine entirely dependent on said
in an area of little wind. As I
write we have been trying for
about 30 hours to make headway
toward Padang and have made
little or none."
After five days of little pro
gress. the ship was rescued by
a tug boat and towed into harbor.
The ship was repaired, and sup
plies were taken on.
The professor stressed the ed
ucational aspects of the cruise.
Unlike some expeditions, the
Stanford project is not interested
in any specialized area. Dr. Bolin
said that the ship stops "where it
finds something interest int. l .."

The second voyage ended Janu
ary 11 when the ship docked in
Clombo, Ceylon. Dr. Bolin flew
homo and will not be with the
cruise which will explore the
waters off the east coast of South
Africa. He plans to rejoin the
ship in three months.
The ship will be under the di
rection of Professor Dixy Lee
Ray of the University of Wash
ington. Of special interest is the
search for the latimeria. The
small fish, once thought to be
extinct, is a side branch of the
evolutionary process that pro
duced man.
The fish has two specialized
fins on its spine which are the
beginnings of the evolution of ver
tabrae. The fish is exceedingly
rare and none have ever been
kept alive in captivity.
Dr. Bolin who was formerly
connected with the science ex
hibit at the Seattle World's Fair,
also pointed out that one of the
purposes of the ship is to get
people to realize the significance
of the seas. The sea is still one of
man's few untapped natural re
sources.


THE 'TE VEGA' SAILS THE SEAS
The alluring water of the South
Seas, pirates off the coast of Su
matra, and a long-lost link in the
evolutionary process- these were
some of the topics discussed by
Professor Rolf Bolin, chief scien

ocean going marine laboratory.
Dr. Bolin in discussing the
travels of the ship showed a
series of slides illustrating the
work of the project. The "Te

which belongs to a northern lum
ber concern. The ship is equipped

credit for their work. They also
receive complete tuition as well
as a stipend for expenses from
the National Science Foundation.
Every three months a new group
is selected to study aboard the
ship.
At Singapore the student crew
was changed, and the vessel be
gan to survey the Indian Ocean
as part of a program organized
by the International Council of
Scientific Unions with support
from UNESCO.
The "Tc Vega's" second voyage
proved to quite harrowing. Dr.
Bolin told of sailing through
pirate-infested waters off the
coast of Sumatra. The pirates,
who are one part of the strained
relation between Malaysia and
Indonesia, patrol the straits sep
arating the two countries. The
"Tc Vega," armed with only a
shotgun and a rifle to kill speci
mens of birds, stayed close to the
Malaysian coast and encountered
no incidents.
On December S, the ship ran
into near tragedy when the prop
eller shaft for the ship's auxiliary
engine was ripped off, leaving a
hole in the housing. In an infor
mal narrative that Dr. Bolin
wrote on the trip he says, "We
were approaching known good
collecting grounds on Sipora (off
the west coast of Sumatra) when
there was a thump . . .
"We are now deprived of our
engine entirely dependent on said
in an area of little wind. As I
write we have been trying for
about 30 hours to make headway
toward Padang and have made
little or none."
After five days of little pro
gress. the ship was rescued by
a tug boat and towed into harbor.
The ship was repaired, and sup
plies were taken on.
The professor stressed the ed
ucational aspects of the cruise.
Unlike some expeditions, the
Stanford project is not interested
in any specialized area. Dr. Bolin
said that the ship stops "where it
finds something interest int. l .."

The second voyage ended Janu
ary 11 when the ship docked in
Clombo, Ceylon. Dr. Bolin flew
homo and will not be with the
cruise which will explore the
waters off the east coast of South
Africa. He plans to rejoin the
ship in three months.
The ship will be under the di
rection of Professor Dixy Lee
Ray of the University of Wash
ington. Of special interest is the
search for the latimeria. The
small fish, once thought to be
extinct, is a side branch of the
evolutionary process that pro
duced man.
The fish has two specialized
fins on its spine which are the
beginnings of the evolution of ver
tabrae. The fish is exceedingly
rare and none have ever been
kept alive in captivity.
Dr. Bolin who was formerly
connected with the science ex
hibit at the Seattle World's Fair,
also pointed out that one of the
purposes of the ship is to get
people to realize the significance
of the seas. The sea is still one of
man's few untapped natural re
sources.
