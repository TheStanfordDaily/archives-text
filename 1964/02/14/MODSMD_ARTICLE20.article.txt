Friday's paper.)
Rugby. Stanford's major sport between the years of 1906 and
1917, disappeared from I lie Farm after the First World War. Nol
unlil 1933 did Stanford students again have the opportunity to watch
a struggle between opposing scrums, to cheer a beautiful touch kick,
or to marvel at a succession of passes that exemplifies teamwork
in sports at its finest.
In that year a group of students who had either played the game
or were interested in playing got together and decided that Stan
lord again needed a rugby team. A coach was easily found and the
second phase of rugby at Stanford was under way. The game was as
unfamiliar to the average student as it was in 1906, but he needed
little prodding to support the team. The Quad calls the game that
year between the Indians and the Golden Bears "a new and color
ful Big Game."
COACHKS OF RUGBY from 1933 to several years after after the
year included Jim Wylie, the grand old man of Stanford rugby, who
had played at Stanford during the 1914 and 1915 seasons; Harry Ma
loney, whose name is now attached to Ihe varsity soccer field; Dink
Templeton, not only a rugby star but a great track coach; and Willard
Classen.
Under such fine coaches, rugby was a popular sport and Stanford
loams did well against other West Coast teams. As now, the teams
played excellent rugby but the games lacked the intense pressure that
ovists in football. "Rugby is the sport at Stanford that defies all
accusations that college sports are becoming more and more spe
cialized," declares the Quad of 1938.
The highlight of each season was the contest with Cal. The games
were always hard-fought, always close, but Cal more often than
not emerged victorious.
FOOTBALL PLAYERS have always bolstered the rugby ranks
and coaches have even encouraged them to go out for the sport.
Rugby reached a high point in 19-41 when several members of the
victorious Rose Bowl football team provided the scoring punch:
Frankie Albert, Pete Kmetovie, and Norm Standlee. The team lost
its opener but. didn't lose another game all season. The finale was
a sweet victory over Cal, 13-8. This game, according to the Quad,
was "the best game every played on the Coast."
After the war, Cal ruled the roost in West Coast rugby, but it
was often the Stanford-Cal game that decided the title for one team
or the other.
Pete Kmetovie returned to Stanford in 1946 and included among
other duties, he has been rugby coach ever since. Throughout his
long career, he has seen many excellent players and teams grace
the Stanford rugby field. He considers the 1951 squad perhaps his
greatest.
IN THAT YEAR, the Indian squad included Norm Manoogian in
the front row and at the breakaway, Jack Bonetti in the front row,
Bill DeYoung, and Russ Latham at the first % position. Latham,
an experienced Canadian, backboned the squad and gave Kmetovie
one of his finest coaching thrills. Stanford had lost the first game
with Cal that year and had to win the rematch to cop Ihe Coast
championship. With but ten seconds remaining in the game, the
score was tied 9-9. Latham at this crucial moment booted home a
40-yard drop kick for victory.
OTHER RUGBY greats who have come and gone in the Kemetovic
era are Gary Van Galder, Paul Wiggin, Gordy Young, and Dave
Schultz, to name a few.
Not confining its opponents to the California area, Stanford has
made occasional trips to British Columbia and to the East. Several
years ago. the Cards matched talents with Dartmouth at West Point
on a cold, miserable day. The proceedings, Kmetovie jokingly recalls,
"set rugby back 20 years."
Northwest jaunts have proved successful and, in fact, a trip has
been lined up for spring vacation that will include Oregon State and
two Victoria teams as opponents.
THE NEW ZEALAND All-Blacks two years ago played the In
dians here and caused a crowd of 3,000 to turn out for the contest.
The Indians matched the touring unit from Down Under point for
point in the first half, but allowed the game to get away from them
in the second half.
In the last three years, Kmetovie has coached squads to a cumu
lative record of 38 wins agaist three losses and one tie. Cal has not
proved invincible in this period. In fact, the Golden Bears have been
on the short end of the score in their last five outings with the In
dians and the Big Scrum Axe, the symbol of rugby supremacy be
tween Cal and Stanford and by coincidence usually the symbol of
Coast supremacy, has resided at the Farm for three years.
