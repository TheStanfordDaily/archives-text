## 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
Stanford's basketball team
faces one of the year's most im
portant weekends tonight and to
morrow night when it takes on
a hard-fighting, never-give-up
crew from the University of Cali
fornia in a battle for second place
in the AAWU.
Friday evening the Indians will
invade Berkeley's Harmon Gym,
scene of last week's near upset
of unbeaten UCLA, and Saturday
the scene shifts to the homey con
fines of the Stanford Pavilion.

THE SERIES figures as a duel
I of two big and high-scoring cen-
I ters — Stanford's Tom Dose, third
leading scorer in the Big Six at
15.6 ppg and Cal's 6-11 Camden
Wall, next in line in the confer
ence at 14.4.
Dose has been a consistent high
scorer and fine rebounder for the
Tribe all season, with a low point
effort of 13 points, while Wall has
been highly inconsistent, hitting
very well when he decided to play
hard and hitting poorly and not
rebounding well when he was not.
up for the game.
How good Wall can be was seen

[last Saturday night as ho flumped
j in 22 points against UCLA. The
big center also demonstrated how
bad ho could be in the Bruin ser
ies as he got no clean rebounds
and only 11 points.
THE GAME should also be a
good contest of speed against si/.e.
Outside Wall, the biggest man on
the Cal starting five is Don Wol
thers at 6-1. The Stanford starters
will have a considerable height ad
vantage at every position.
Clay Raaka, at 6-7, will be on
Wolthers. The Indian guards, Mol
lis Moore and Kent Hinckley, will
each have at least an inch per
man on their counterparts. A n d
forward Bob Bedell at 6-6 will
have three inches on his man,
Steve Smith.
In most basketball games the
home court advantage is a major
factor, but this series may not
work out that way. Last season,
Stanford won both games at Ber
keley. but Cal turned around and
won the game at the Pavilion.

THE GAME should also be a
good contest of speed against si/.e.
Outside Wall, the biggest man on
the Cal starting five is Don Wol
thers at 6-1. The Stanford starters
will have a considerable height ad
vantage at every position.
Clay Raaka, at 6-7, will be on
Wolthers. The Indian guards, Mol
lis Moore and Kent Hinckley, will
each have at least an inch per
man on their counterparts. A n d
forward Bob Bedell at 6-6 will
have three inches on his man,
Steve Smith.
In most basketball games the
home court advantage is a major
factor, but this series may not
work out that way. Last season,
Stanford won both games at Ber
keley. but Cal turned around and
won the game at the Pavilion.
