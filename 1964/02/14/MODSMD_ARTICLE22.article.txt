# Ruggers Whip St. Mary's; Face UCLA On Road Next
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
In a little publicized game Wed
nesday afternoon with St. Mary's,
the Stanford rugby squad primed
for its weekend duel with UCLA
in the southland by sparing the
foot and practicing instead its
rushing techniques. The result
was two 24-point halves and a de
cisive 48-0 victory over- the willing
but inept red and blue shirted
Gaels.
Classes claimed some Stanford
players so that the squad was
not at full strength, but the In
dians found it easy to get on the
scoreboard and once there easy
to add to their margin.
GORDON WADDELL, Steve
Van Nort, and Clark Weaver did
their usual fine job of rushing
and passing. The Flying Scot ac
cumulated 15 points on six con
versions and a try. Weaver did a
good job of running, notching
two tries, and tried some cross
field kicking that almost led to
scores.
Leading the scorers by tho try
method was right wing Dick
Shaw, who put on a show that
brought three tries and several
other fine runs. His initial tally
was on a cut into the middle of
the field after taking a pass from
Van Nort.
Near the end of the first half,
a Waddell kick was bouncing to
wards touch, but hustle brought
Shaw to the scene and he hooted
the ball thirty yards into the Gael
goal area and won the race. His
final goalward excursion was a
sideline skirt in the second half.

added two tries to the Stanford
cause: Jack Chappie. Normally
the back row rarely gets to tote
the leather, but Chappie had nu
merous opportunities during the
game and he carried would-be
tacklers into the goal area on two

such occasions.
Several members of the squad
saw action at diversified positions.
Bob Burke, normally a wing,
played most of the second half at
the important scrum half position
normally occupied by C'apt. Bob
Price and did a bang-up job. Glenn
Myers, who last week played on
the rushing line, played fullback.
Sidestepping a total of three
Goels, he scored a try midway
through the first half.
HANK MACQUEEN, getting his
first varsity test this year, played
a good wing and found the left
corner in the first half for a score.
Finishing scoring duties were
Dick Ragsdale with a try and
Burke with a penalty kick.
Saturday afternoon the unde
feated Indians will get their first
taste of play on the road when
they take on UCLA.
The only score available involv
ing the Uelans is a 3-3 tie with
the Peninsula Ramblers, the same
team that Stanford easily defeated
19-8 in its second game of the
season.
