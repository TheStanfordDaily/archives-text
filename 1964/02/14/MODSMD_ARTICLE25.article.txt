# Campus Politics Explored: Which Way Is UP?
## Editorial 
### 
YVhich way is UP?
Plans are now being made for the forma
tion of a student political party, which will
be called University Party. We must com
mend the people who planned this organiza
tion. Their desire to rid student government
of apathy, irresponsibility and impotency is
excellent.
Yet, we cannot accept their arguments
that partisan political machinery will be
effective in ridding student government of
these ills.
It must be recognized from the outset
that student government is not the same as
national government, much as we wish it
were. The aims of the political machinery
are different because the circumstances are
different.

The government in Washington is auto
nomous, responsible only to the people and
traditions of the United States. Student gov
ernment is not autonomous, but operates
within a larger governmental organization,
and is responsible to that organization as
well as to its "people" and traditions.
Student government must always be cog
nizant of the fact that what it gains comes
from the larger organization, the Univer
sity. As a result, the posture of student gov
ernment toward the University is as impor
tant as the relation of student government
with students.
Partisan politics, anywhere, assumes cer
tain conditions — first, differences in either
goals or means, and, second, a need to pro
vide a watchdog over the group in power.
Neither condition is valid for Stanford stu

dent government.
Among interested students there is al
most unanimous agreement on the goals of
student government: inereased student par
ticipation in the life of the University. Those
who oppose this end are sometimes voeal,
but always inactive.
Ilenee, the only conceivable division must
come among the active groups and not on
the question of goals, but on means. Yet
this is the area of action for Legislature. The
goals are clear; it is the task of Legislature
to find the means.
In student government, the means should
never be a cause for partisan disunion —

for it is not through division, that the ends
of student government are to be attained,
vis-a-vis the University.
In its pamphlet, "Introduction to the Uni
versity Party," the UP says that "by provid
ing an atmosphere and an avenue for effec
tive student involvement, apathy will become
action. .. . We can only question this assess
ment. With so many groups on campus cry
ing out for people, crying out for effective
student involvement, why does apathy still
reign at Stanford?
It is not the task of this editorial to in
vestigate the causes of apathy — although
some more obvious ones may be the grading
system, new interests in academic affairs,
boredom with traditional student areas of
interest — but rather to question the assump
tion of a single package cure.

Party government will not be a panacea
for the ills of student government, nor w ill it
result, as the University Party claims, in a
more responsible student government.
Effective party control of the members
of Legislature, without which party organi
zation would be a joke, would remove the
initiative of student government from the
floor of Legislature to the party caucus. The
position of the party would be ol utmost
importance and the decisions would be made
by a portion of the Legislature, outside the
Legislature meeting, li the party had a ma
jority of the seats, it could conceivably run
Legislature with a minority group in the
caucus. This is not responsible government.
The question is not one of "which direc
tion is lip," but rather which means will sus
tain us in an upward direction.
