## The
						Great Milk Worry: Bessie's Saturated Fats 
### Ford Burkhart 
There's a new worn to trouble the Farm.
And for those w ho are still sleepless over the Surgeon General s ;
warnings on the weed, it might be a welcome change of pace.
It's about sweet old Bessie the Cow, and her good, fresh milk
we all love so much.
If Bessie's milk were on trial, the charges might include such
terms as kidney stones, heart disease and arthritis.
Drinking a glass full of saturated fats and calcium, some doe- j
tors say, could be worse for your health than cigarettes.
You could probably find doctors who would give you odds, l
based on empirical data, that milk-drinking and heart disease are,
causallv related. But few would agree on what the odds are.
The ease against milk, and dairy products generally, is not
yet as conclusive as the case against tobacco. But plenty ol re
search is going on at Stanford and elsewhere.
To cover all the relevant dietary dangers, doctors advise that
the average healthy Stanford student consume plenty of fats and
a small amount of carbohydrates. The key, however, is to be cer
tain those fats are unsaturated. For example, corn oil and fish in- j
stead of butter and lamb.
Doctors find it difficult to generalize on the basis of rather
sketchy data. Part of the fogginess of the milk controversy lies
in the fact that certain types of persons are more susceptible than
others.

But these is another part of the Milk Worn - .
Milk is rich in calcium, which, as most young folks know, helps
build strong bones. But for older folks there are dangers from too
much calcium. It could be said that milk encourages kidney stones
and perhaps arthritis in some people.
On the other hand, doctors could counter these dangers with
data on harmful effects of calcium deficiency. It's a stick) point.
No one could tell you how many days you might shorten your
life with each ice cream cone, slice of bread with butter, or glass
of whole milk. But they could tell you enough to make you worry.
To get right down to the real nitty-gritty of the problem: if
your super-ordinate goal in life is to achieve Golden Health at
age 95, then all precautions should be observed. You could be
come an Anti-Saturated-Fat fanatic.
But if your life is already complex enough without adding an
other major source of cognitive dissonance, then you might classify
the Milk Worry as a minor one.
It makes a refreshing change from worrying about creeping
socialism, the Population Explosion and the Bomb.
Just for the record, the local creamery's delivery man reports
that 250 containers of milk are purchased daily near the School
of Medicine lounge.
And 250 Stanford Medical students could hardly be wrong.
Could they?
