# Insights On The YR-YD Debate Controversy
## The 						Milbox 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
With regard to the current
controversy on the proposed
YR-YD debate as former
SAYR president as well as a
fraternity brother of YD Presi
dent Ronka, I feel uniquely
qualified to throw some light
on the situation.
Accepting Miss Westerlund's
statement that her offer to dis
cuss the debate was not fol
lowed up by Ronka, I can state
on his behalf that Miss West
erlund can be "conveniently
out" on a moments notice.
At the same time, Miss West
erlund's point that the pro
cedure employed by the YDs in
arranging the debate, typical
of the partisan liberal ele
ment's organizational per
formance at Stanford is well
taken. Perhaps it would ex
plain why no Stanford YD
group has ever lasted four
months.
It may be hoped that any
YR-YD controversy in the fu
turewill center upon political
differences rather than per
sonal invectives.

• YD Pres. Replies
Editor, The Daily:
It was with satisfaction that
I noted the willingness of the
SAYR's to meet the Stanford
Young Democrats in public de
bate before the Stanford stu
dent body. Regarding the re
cent letter of Barbara We.st
erlund. SAYR president, I will
assume that her remarks are
the result of an honest misun
derstanding, and will limit my
comments to a correction of
that misunderstanding. I have
no desire to see this beachhead
of co-operation lost to the petti
ness and irrelevancy of per
sonal invective.
As Miss Westerlund may re
member, I first contacted the
SAYR's last October in the
hope of viewing the structural
aspects of their constitution, as
we w ; ere then in the process of

drafting our own. I never did
sec the SAYR constitution,
however, as none of the SAYR
officers seemed able to locate
a copy.
I suggested a series of SYD
SAYR debates to Miss Wester
lund early in the quarter. Two
weeks ago, 1 called her again,
seeking to firm up speakers,
topic and time for the initial
debate. Miss Westerlund in
formed me, however, that the
Young Republicans would not
be interested in considering any
debates t his quarter and that
I might try again in Ihe Spring.
It was at this point that
friends of mine SAYR's as
well fJYD's suggested thai
an open challenge in the Daily
might overcome the reticence
of v oi - ; -in members of the
SAYR Executive Board to get
on with the debates in earnest.
The success of our challenge
is apparent in the complete lack
of further reticence in Miss
Westerlund's letter. My compli
ments to Messrs. Garfield and
Stroud, for a job well done.

• Rush Obligation
Editor, The Daily:
For almost. 60 years the Stan
ford Eating Clubs have both
accommodated and encouraged
the social and intellectual
growth of their members. In
deed. for the past several dec
ades the clubs have empha
sized those qualities of indi
vidualism, scholarship and so
cial comradeship which the fra
ternities and Stern have been
moving toward for the past
three years.
Just as Messrs. Keylor, Jones
and Baicr are committed to the
fraternity system, we are com
mitted to the club system and
are confident that it can con

tinue to serve Ihe altitudes and
values of the student commu
nity.
The men participating in
rush this year do not have an
obligation to confront any liv
ing group with their ideals. It
is up to the living group to con
front prospective m e m be r s
with a system in which their
ideals can survive and grow.
We believe that the clubs have
met their obligations and will
continue to do so.

• Who Is Verreos?
Editor, The Daily:
The article in Monday's Daily
on the special Congressional
election in San Francisco left
unclear just who or what "Ver
reos" is.
The "Verreos campaign" is a
bi-partisan effort to elect Nick
Verreos to Congress in th e
Fifth District and to block Phil
Burton. Burton is indeed a hoi
potato none of the San Fran
•isco papers have endorsed him.
Edwin T. Thayer, former Na
tional Committeeman of the
California Young Democrats,
is chairman of the Democrats
for Verreos Committee. He
says;
"On his record. Burton has
opposed authentic Kennedy
Democrats and has been op
posed by them. His opposition
to Kennedy democracy is so
profound that there is hardly
a major issue of foreign policy
on which he is not diametri
cally opposed to the majority
of Democrats."
Nick Verreos is administra
tive assistant to Congressman
William Mailliard of San Fran
cisco.
