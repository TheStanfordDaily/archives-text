# Stanford And Beyond
## Activism Selfish; Offers Personal Fulfillment 
### Vivian Bozman 
To a pleasantly isolated university campus come speakers with
a message of urgency, civil rights workers whose stories are ter
rifying in their truth. And many formerly well-isolated students
listen to these tales with a concern that goes beyond mere expres
sion of sympathy, perhaps, because, in the end, it is difficult to
live in affluence and apathy when too many live in poverty and
pain.
Last night LASSU, in response to the growing awareness of
the part students can play in the struggle ior the attainment ol
civil rights for all Americans, voted on a proposal to establish a
Civil Rights Secretariat at .Stanford to channel information for
students interested in participating in Student Nou Violent Co
ordinating Committee summer activities and to serve as organ
izer for Martin Luther King Jr.'s April visit to Stanford. And to
day, and in the next few months, many Stanford students w ill con
sider the question — why go south to work lor civil rights?
In deciding to go south a student is exposing himself to the
charge of being an outside agitator, a kid out for thrills, who is
unwilling to stay home and attempt to solve the more mundane
problems of prejudice in his own backyard.
And, yet, for the majority of young people going south is not
a decision made without thought. Students do not simply choose
to work for civil rights in order to know a new kind of excitement.
Certainly there is an excitement in working for a goal in which
the student believes, but few students are unaware of the com
plete lack of "thrills" in the reality of southern jails and police
brutality.

Becoming an "outside agitator" does not stem from the desire
to run away from East Palo Alto or Chicago's south side; rather,
the choice to go south is the most direct and complete way ot ex
pressing a commitment — a commitment to a dream called Ameri
can democracy that is yet to be realized, a commitment to a basic
credo of judging men on what they do and are as individuals, not
on the color of their skin.
And the expression of this commitment is a significant means
of attaining self respect, for direct commitment acts as a lever of
release, freeing the concerned student from the uncomfortable
posture of disinterested bystander.
"Activism is indeed a sellish act in the sense that active effort
for a goal which holds meaning for the individual involved offers
much personal fulfillment. And, yet, it is illogical and without
real basis in fact to call a student a thrill seeker because he finds
satisfaction in working for civil rights.
The decision of how much concern to show and in w hat way
to express this concern for civil rights belongs to the individual
student. The civil rights movement today calls for no glib labels,
but, rather, for a basic respect for the sincerity and seriousness ol
those involved.
