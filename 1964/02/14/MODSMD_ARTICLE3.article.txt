many of the particulars of the
clubs are new to incoming stu
dents. The open houses give inter
ested men the opportunity to ac
quaint themselves with the sys
tem.
When asked about t. h e open
house, Roger Cowan, ICC Presi
dent, stated, "During the winter
quarter open houses, we of the
eating clubs would enjoy talking
with students about the clubs and
the club philosophy. Because we
do not think rush should be con
fined to one hectic week in spring
quarter, we strongly urge every
one to come over and talk with
us this quarter, while the situa
tion remains more natural and
the discussion more meaningful."
