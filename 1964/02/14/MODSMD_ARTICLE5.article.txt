# Rusher Presents Goldwater's Views: Attacks Press For Misrepresentation
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Staff Editor 
The views of Senator Barry
Goldwater and the growing con
servative movement have suf-
Cored a "campaign of mispresen
(ation" by a press that five years
ago ignored them "in hopes that
they would disappear."
Thus stated William Rusher,
publisher of National Review, in
beginning an item-by-item review
of recent "misrepresentations" of
l he Arizonan's opinions.
T I R N I N <i FIRST to Gold
water's proposals lo "sell TVA,"
Rusher said that TVA in its be
ginning was pictured "as the first
robin of a socialist Spring," the
first part of what was to eventu
ally end in a "Utopia of Valley
Authorit les."
Now that TVA has not lived
up to hopes and has taken on
such functions as building steam
plants and manufacturing fer
tilizer, said Rusher, "it's lime lu

lake a rational look, a reap
praisal."
In analyzing Goldwater's views
on welfare, Rusher said that the
present "dole" system was creat
ing a "professionally indigent
class" which prefers not to work.
Goldwater, said Rusher, was ac
cused of "heartlessness when he
suggested that those on welfare
should work. Yd no politician
suggests that they don't work."
"NEARLY KYKKYONK thinks
that Barry wants to get us out
of the UN," Rusher said. Gold
water merely proposes "an ad
justment of American policy to
the changes in lh<> UN over the
past few years." The large new
block of Afro-Asia nations has
"turned the UN into a cheap and
largely fareial form of power
politics," Rusher said. "Gold
water wants to remove U.S. com
mitment to UN policies and to
recognize its limitations as a
world forum," he concluded.
