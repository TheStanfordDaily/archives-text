# Legislature Calls For Religion Policy Change
## Wedin Proposes Rights Group 
### ROD PECK JUSTIN BECK 
A nearly unanimous LASSU
approved a resolution last night
calling for changes in Stanford's
religious policy. Based on a report
submitted last meeting by Ih e
Religion Committee, the resolu
tion included the following recom
mendations:
All religious groups and faiths
be allowed to hold services and
meetings on the campus using
University facilities.
A relevant, varied and challeng
ing religious program should be
instituted to better meet the needs
and desires of the Stanford com
munity.
The suggestions included in the
Legislature's Report should be
given maximum consideration in
the institution of all changes.
An active student part is called
for in the formation and enact
ment of all changes.
Debate centered around th e
first part of the resolution on al
lowing religious groups to hold
campus services. Most LASSU
members who spoke said that the
students in their living groups did
feel the need for a change in the
policy, although there was some
doubt expressed on whether stu
dents actually cared about any
religious program.
Comments from Legislature
members generally agreed with
Dan Schwartz, committee chair
man, who stated, "We are trying
to provide for those who feel a
need for religious expression and
inquiry and cannot now fulfill
it."
Pres i d en t Bud Wedin com
mented. "The question remains as
to exactly how to make religion
relevant and lo improve the exist
ing facilities to deal with all Stan
ford students' needs."
Legislature also tabled a pro
posal by Wedin to create a Civil
Rights Secretariat at Stanford.
The Secretariat would serve as a
clearing house to stimulate stu
dent interest in summer work
projects in the South, particularly
Mississippi. Bud Wedin stated. "In
response lo the interest expressed
by Stanford students last fall dur
ing the Mississippi mock election,
the Confederation of Federated
Organizations (COFO) has asked
Stanford to serve as the central
coordinator on the West Coast."
To allow further consideration
the motion was tabled.
A by-law change to provide for
weekly LASSU meetings and the
submitting of items to be consid
ered to the Daily in advance was
amended to retain the bi-weekly
meetings and to purchase space
in the paper for LASSU publicity.
The financing will be brought up
, at a later meeting.
j Dan Schwartz moved lo have
LASSU buy the space rather than
instructing the Daily to print the
agendas. He explained, "It could
. conceivably set a precedent for the
ASSU dictating to the Daily what
i it should a n d should not print.
I The possible infringing on their
| freedom of the press is not worth
] I he risk."
Before LASSU could get the mat
ter settled, a series of amendments
and amended amen d m ents
were proposed, and much of the
[discussion was spent in finding
i out exactly what was being dis
cussed. By the time the Legisla
ture had straightened out Parlia
mentary procedure, the religious
and all o t her campus issues
â–  seemed simnle in comparison.
