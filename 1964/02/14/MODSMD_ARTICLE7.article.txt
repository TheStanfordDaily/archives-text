COKE yesterday announced
thai it has signed a non-dis
criminatory hiring pact with
several stores of the Stanford
Shopping Center, and also re
ports that it is planning to
picket Lucky Super Markets
for breaking a similar pact.
The agreement signed yes
terday, after two months of
negotiations, covered the Em
porium, Macy's, I. Magnin,
Livingstons, Hastings, and
Koos Atkins. The plan empha
sizes "active recruitment of
qualified applicants, training
programs both on the .job
and in high schools and col
leges, and coordinated efforts
to increase minority group
representation in all store job
categories, including sales,
clerical and supervision."
According to CORE, con
tinued expression of non-dis
criminatory hiring policies
will encourage students to
stay in school and receive the
education necessary to fill
jobs requiring high qualifica
tions. The agreement calls for
cooperation with the Depart
ment of Employment in train
ing minority group persons to
fill jobs that few are pres
ently qualified to hold.
CORE will meet with rep
resentatives of the seven
stores every three months.
The meetings will be for Uie
purpose of measuring "pro
gress of the program in indi
vidual stores to make certain
that the announced objectives

are achieved."
Four months ago a similar
agreement was reached with
Lucky Sii|>er Markets. Th e
agreement was specifically de
signed to insure that an
"equitable and reasonable"
number of Negroes and non
whites are hired during an
agreed upon inspection period.
According' to tin* CORE
release to the Daily, "Three
months after the inspection
period, Bay Area COKE ne
gotiators discovered that an
inequitable number of Ne
groes and non-whites had been
hired. Of the 820 new hires
during the three month per
iod, only IS were Negroes.
Such a meager sum is
clearly in violation of th e
agreement."
COKE made further ne
gotiations with Lucky's man
agement but received "no in
dication that Lucky was will
ing to hire an equitable mint
ber of Negroes and noil
whites." COKE chapters will
urge their respective commu
nities not to buy at Lucky's
until agreement is reached.
Mid-Peninsula CORE will
hold a rally at KJHT Bay Road,
East Palo Alto, 8 o'clock Fri
day evening for further ex
planation in picketing Lucky
stores in the area.
CORE reports that picket
ing will begin on Saturday un
less agreement is reached be
fore that time. Stanford stu
dents will participate in the

COKE yesterday announced
thai it has signed a non-dis
criminatory hiring pact with
several stores of the Stanford
Shopping Center, and also re
ports that it is planning to
picket Lucky Super Markets
for breaking a similar pact.
The agreement signed yes
terday, after two months of
negotiations, covered the Em
porium, Macy's, I. Magnin,
Livingstons, Hastings, and
Koos Atkins. The plan empha
sizes "active recruitment of
qualified applicants, training
programs both on the .job
and in high schools and col
leges, and coordinated efforts
to increase minority group
representation in all store job
categories, including sales,
clerical and supervision."
According to CORE, con
tinued expression of non-dis
criminatory hiring policies
will encourage students to
stay in school and receive the
education necessary to fill
jobs requiring high qualifica
tions. The agreement calls for
cooperation with the Depart
ment of Employment in train
ing minority group persons to
fill jobs that few are pres
ently qualified to hold.
CORE will meet with rep
resentatives of the seven
stores every three months.
The meetings will be for Uie
purpose of measuring "pro
gress of the program in indi
vidual stores to make certain
that the announced objectives

are achieved."
Four months ago a similar
agreement was reached with
Lucky Sii|>er Markets. Th e
agreement was specifically de
signed to insure that an
"equitable and reasonable"
number of Negroes and non
whites are hired during an
agreed upon inspection period.
According' to tin* CORE
release to the Daily, "Three
months after the inspection
period, Bay Area COKE ne
gotiators discovered that an
inequitable number of Ne
groes and non-whites had been
hired. Of the 820 new hires
during the three month per
iod, only IS were Negroes.
Such a meager sum is
clearly in violation of th e
agreement."
COKE made further ne
gotiations with Lucky's man
agement but received "no in
dication that Lucky was will
ing to hire an equitable mint
ber of Negroes and noil
whites." COKE chapters will
urge their respective commu
nities not to buy at Lucky's
until agreement is reached.
Mid-Peninsula CORE will
hold a rally at KJHT Bay Road,
East Palo Alto, 8 o'clock Fri
day evening for further ex
planation in picketing Lucky
stores in the area.
CORE reports that picket
ing will begin on Saturday un
