# Ketchum To Discuss Hegel In Phenomenology Lecture
## 
### 
The next lecture in the Tres
idder Union series on Existential
ism, "Phenomenology for Begin
ners ( Elementary- and Ad
vanced)," will be presented by
Jonathan Ketchum at the Union
this evening at 8 p.m.
Alt hough phenomenology is
one of the most general and most
vital approaches to philosophy in
Europe today, it is still almost
unknown in the United States.
This remarkable circumstance
points to some basic differences
in world-view between phenom
enologically and empirically ori
ented aspects of our culture, per
vading even the details of our
everyday existence.
Mr. Ketchum will set forth the
leading idea of phenomenology in
such a way as to clarify these dif
ferences, and to suggest that the
phenomenological world- view
(like the existential, to which it
is closely related) offers a broad
er, richer, and more meaningful
understanding of man's place in
the world.
The lecture will be centered
around the thought of the 19th
century philosopher G. W. F.
Hegel, and the 20th century
philosopher Edmu n d Husserl.
Each will be considered in the
light of his contribution to man's

understanding of himself and the
world, in the contexts both of
everyday life and scientific endea
vor.
The speaker, who holds an A.B.
and an M.A. from Harvard, came
to Stanford to study under Prof,
emeritus Kurt Reinhardt, who
himself studied under Husserl.
Mr. Ketchum is currently prepar
ing a dissertation on Hegel's
phenomenology. He also operates
a small student residence off
campus, which he started after
a year as a resident assistant at
Stern Hall. One of the features of
his house is a series of seminars
in some of the topics he will dis
cuss.
