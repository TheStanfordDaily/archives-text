# Players Casting For Ibsen Play
## 
### 
Some of the strongest acting
roles offered by Stanford Players
this season are to be cast when
tryouts for Ibsen's "Rosmer
sholm" are held tonight, Tuesday
and Wednesday in the Little Thea
tre. Tryouts are scheduled from
7:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. each eve
ning.
"The play is a psychological
study, not a social documentary
one usually associated with the
name of Ibsen," reports Dr. Ker
ans. the director, "for it was writ
ten in the mature phase of Ibsen's
career when the author's empha
sis dwelt on character relation
ships. That is why the roles we
are casting are so choice." The
production, which has four char
acter parts for men, features one
of the greatest roles for women,
that of Rebecca.
The performances of "Rosmer
sholm" are scheduled for April
9, 10. 11 and 15, 16, 17. and 18.
