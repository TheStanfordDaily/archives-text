Many people wrongly believe that the liible is the work of man, dependent
on scholarship and human wisdom. Spiritual Christians accept what the Bible
claims for itselfâ€” that God the Holy Spirt is its author.
"For the prophecy (Greek: the speaking forth of the mind and counsel of
God) came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they
were moved by the lloly Spirit." II Peter 1:21.
Non-Christians claim that the liible can be interpreted in many different ways.
However, throughout the ages, Spirit-led Christians have come independently to
find their faith in the Word of God rewarded, but by the growing power and
presence of God in their lives.
"For the Word of Gud is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two
edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the
joints and marrow, and is a diseerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
Heb. 4:1-'.
The Holy Spirit indwelling every believer is the Christian's Teacher and Guide,
and He uses the Word of God to accomplish this instruction.
"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God
may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all gooil works." II Tim. 3:16, 17.
The Bible tells us that God's Word is complete. God has spoken. We are never
to add to nor subtract from what God has already declared as His finished revela
tion :
"For T testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this
book. If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues
that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words
of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life,
and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."
Rev. 22:18, 19.
Should you be in doubt about the inerrancy and infallibility of the liible.
examine the claims it makes for itself. The best way to establish to your own
satisfaction that the liible is the very Word of God is to test it in the laboratory
of life. Don't be misled by nominal Christians or skeptics who apologize for the
Bible and rely on the wisdom of men for its interpretation.
"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God
unto salvation to every one that belicveth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith . . Rom.
1:16, 17.
A knowledge of God is essential to our salvation. The liible tells tis that "faith
cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God." Rom. 10:17. Thus, it is
highly important that everyone read the Holy Scriptures, for it is our means of
learning about God and believing in Him. Study Scripture with us by mail at no
