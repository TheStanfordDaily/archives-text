# Young Republicans Choose Goldwater For President
## 
### JOHN BONINE Staff Writer 
SAX DIEGO (Special to The Daily)—The California Young
Republicans (CYK) overwhelmingly endorsed Senator Barry
Goldwater for the Republican Presidential nomination in an
unprecedented action as their annual convention wound up in
San Diego yesterday.
The endorsement came after conservatives at the convention

elected an unbroken slate of
water supporters to serve as offi
cers of the CYR for next year.
Both the Goldwater conserva
tive endorsement and the election
results of the 11 thousand mem
ber organization were viewed by
observers as a major boost for

Senator Gol d
wa tor's Califor
nia primary cam
paign.
The Golclwatei
en d or s e men
passed by a vot'
of 256 to 33 (8£
per cent i and cli
maxed three days
of politicking in

maxed three days of politicking in
which every candidate for a state
office claimed to be backing Sen
ator Goldvvator. Some said, how
ever, that they disagreed with a
pre-primary endorsement "in prin
ciple."
The conservative sweep of all
elective positions in the CYR was
led by John Gromala, a lawyer
from Fnrtuna. He received 213 V-!

votes from the
delegates wit h
IVs going for
imes Slaybaugh
if Alameda
'ounty and 25
or Jo h n Clow
>112 Marin County.
Slaybaugh had
.he backing of
liberal elements

at tho convention and Clow was
backed by some conservatives.
Slaybaugh voted against endors
ing Senator Goldwater and Clou
voted in favor of the move.
REGARDING THE Goldwater
endorsement, newly elected CYR
president John Gromala, in an ex
clusive interview with The Daily,
said, "It is utterly fantastic. Not
only for the first time in the his
tory of the YR have they given a
pro-primary endorsement but also
the endorsement was by a vote
of over 80 per cent of all dele
gates."
The victory indicated a marked
increase in conservative strength
since last year's YR convention in
Fresno, when Robert Gaston won
over liberal Ken Davis of Ventura
County by a vote of 179 to 160.
Groundwork for the conserva
tive sweep was laid al three ses
sions of a "conservative caucus"
attended by delegates agreeing lo
support the choices of the caucus.
THIS YEAR James Slaybaugh
refused to attend the caucus and
John Clou, the third candidate for
the presidency, visited tho caucus
briefly to tell the group that he
did not: approve of the procedure
;ind would not be bound by the

4
! results.
San Mateo county's Louanne
j Hudson was elected national com
mlitteewoman by the margin of
j 236 1 to 84 1 - over Carol Baceiocco
:of San Francisco, Mrs. Hudson
; had won the endorsement of the
j conservative caucus on Saturday.
(Her husband, Mike, lost in his
bid for the state presidency t wo
years ago by only four votes. Hud
son is a graduate of Stanford and
a former officer of the Stanford
area Young Republicans.)
MRS. HUDSON, a staunch Gold
lwater conservative, pledged to
j "work my heart out" for Repub
licans in 1964 and to "do all I
I can for the conservative cause
which has come so far in recent
years." She received a standing
ovation. Her election was to the
highest state office for which a
i member of the San Mateo County
j Young Republicans has ever been
j chosen.
Dan Harris of Riverside County
; was elected executive vice presi
dent by acclamation and Bo b
Pearl of Orange County was
elected national committeeman.
Both were choices of the conser
vative caucus.
Harris' political leanings were
indicated by one of the seconding
speeches for his nomination, which
asked the YR's to "continue elect
ing a team which will help the ele
phant point his trunk in the right
1 direction."
TO COMPLETE the sweep of
the top four offices Bob Pearl, im
mediate past treasurer of the
Young Republicans, was elected
by acclamation after a plea by
Bill Beer whom he defeated in the
caucus Saturday.
In his nominating speech Beer
said, "Party unity is built by those
who lose. We can only have party
unity if those who lose get behind
those who win."
Former Stanford Young Repub
licans elected to office were CYR's
treasurer Kent Kaiser and the Re
gion Five vice president Berkeley
Johnson.
THE SENTIMENT a g a inst
what some delegates called "me
tooism" was reflected even in the
opening prayer Sunday by the
CYR chaplain Bruce Anthony,
who asked that the delegates not
pay heed "to those who espouse
merely an amen philosophy." The
lack of support for any presiden
tial candidate other than Senator
Goldwater was unmistakable.
At the Los Angeles County
caucus on Saturday one of the un
successful candidates, Carol Boc
ciocco, expressed her surprise that
the delegates had not asked whom
she was supporting for the Re
publican presidential nomination.
"Oh, we know," someone in the
back of the room shouted, "Barry
; Goldwater. Everybody is for
1 Goldwater."

SAX DIEGO (Special to The Daily)—The California Young
Republicans (CYK) overwhelmingly endorsed Senator Barry
Goldwater for the Republican Presidential nomination in an
unprecedented action as their annual convention wound up in
San Diego yesterday.
The endorsement came after conservatives at the convention

elected an unbroken slate of
water supporters to serve as offi
cers of the CYR for next year.
Both the Goldwater conserva
tive endorsement and the election
results of the 11 thousand mem
ber organization were viewed by
observers as a major boost for

Senator Gol d
wa tor's Califor
nia primary cam
paign.
The Golclwatei

of 256 to 33 (8£
per cent i and cli

maxed three days of politicking in
which every candidate for a state
office claimed to be backing Sen
ator Goldvvator. Some said, how
ever, that they disagreed with a
pre-primary endorsement "in prin
ciple."
The conservative sweep of all
elective positions in the CYR was
led by John Gromala, a lawyer
from Fnrtuna. He received 213 V-!

votes from the
delegates wit h
IVs going for
imes Slaybaugh
if Alameda
'ounty and 25
or Jo h n Clow
>112 Marin County.
Slaybaugh had
.he backing of
liberal elements

at tho convention and Clow was
backed by some conservatives.
Slaybaugh voted against endors
ing Senator Goldwater and Clou
voted in favor of the move.
REGARDING THE Goldwater
endorsement, newly elected CYR
president John Gromala, in an ex
clusive interview with The Daily,
said, "It is utterly fantastic. Not
only for the first time in the his
tory of the YR have they given a
pro-primary endorsement but also
the endorsement was by a vote
of over 80 per cent of all dele
gates."
The victory indicated a marked
increase in conservative strength
since last year's YR convention in
Fresno, when Robert Gaston won
over liberal Ken Davis of Ventura
County by a vote of 179 to 160.
Groundwork for the conserva
tive sweep was laid al three ses
sions of a "conservative caucus"
attended by delegates agreeing lo
support the choices of the caucus.
THIS YEAR James Slaybaugh
refused to attend the caucus and
John Clou, the third candidate for
the presidency, visited tho caucus
briefly to tell the group that he
did not: approve of the procedure
;ind would not be bound by the

4
! results.
San Mateo county's Louanne
j Hudson was elected national com
mlitteewoman by the margin of
j 236 1 to 84 1 - over Carol Baceiocco
:of San Francisco, Mrs. Hudson
; had won the endorsement of the
j conservative caucus on Saturday.
(Her husband, Mike, lost in his
bid for the state presidency t wo
years ago by only four votes. Hud
son is a graduate of Stanford and
a former officer of the Stanford
area Young Republicans.)
MRS. HUDSON, a staunch Gold
lwater conservative, pledged to
j "work my heart out" for Repub
licans in 1964 and to "do all I
I can for the conservative cause
which has come so far in recent
years." She received a standing
ovation. Her election was to the
highest state office for which a
i member of the San Mateo County
j Young Republicans has ever been
j chosen.
Dan Harris of Riverside County
; was elected executive vice presi
dent by acclamation and Bo b
Pearl of Orange County was
elected national committeeman.
Both were choices of the conser
vative caucus.
Harris' political leanings were
indicated by one of the seconding
speeches for his nomination, which
asked the YR's to "continue elect
ing a team which will help the ele
phant point his trunk in the right
1 direction."
TO COMPLETE the sweep of
the top four offices Bob Pearl, im
mediate past treasurer of the
Young Republicans, was elected
by acclamation after a plea by
Bill Beer whom he defeated in the
caucus Saturday.
In his nominating speech Beer
said, "Party unity is built by those
who lose. We can only have party
unity if those who lose get behind
those who win."
Former Stanford Young Repub
licans elected to office were CYR's
treasurer Kent Kaiser and the Re
gion Five vice president Berkeley
Johnson.
THE SENTIMENT a g a inst
what some delegates called "me
tooism" was reflected even in the
opening prayer Sunday by the
CYR chaplain Bruce Anthony,
who asked that the delegates not
pay heed "to those who espouse
merely an amen philosophy." The
lack of support for any presiden
tial candidate other than Senator
Goldwater was unmistakable.
At the Los Angeles County
caucus on Saturday one of the un
successful candidates, Carol Boc
ciocco, expressed her surprise that
the delegates had not asked whom
she was supporting for the Re
publican presidential nomination.
"Oh, we know," someone in the
back of the room shouted, "Barry

SAX DIEGO (Special to The Daily)—The California Young
Republicans (CYK) overwhelmingly endorsed Senator Barry
Goldwater for the Republican Presidential nomination in an
unprecedented action as their annual convention wound up in
San Diego yesterday.
The endorsement came after conservatives at the convention

elected an unbroken slate of
water supporters to serve as offi
cers of the CYR for next year.
Both the Goldwater conserva
tive endorsement and the election
results of the 11 thousand mem
ber organization were viewed by
observers as a major boost for

Senator Gol d
wa tor's Califor
nia primary cam
paign.
The Golclwatei
en d or s e men
passed by a vot'
of 256 to 33 (8£
per cent i and cli
maxed three days
of politicking in

maxed three days of politicking in
which every candidate for a state
office claimed to be backing Sen
ator Goldvvator. Some said, how
ever, that they disagreed with a
pre-primary endorsement "in prin
ciple."
The conservative sweep of all
elective positions in the CYR was
led by John Gromala, a lawyer
from Fnrtuna. He received 213 V-!

votes from the
delegates wit h
IVs going for
imes Slaybaugh
if Alameda
'ounty and 25
or Jo h n Clow
>112 Marin County.
Slaybaugh had
.he backing of
liberal elements

at tho convention and Clow was
backed by some conservatives.
Slaybaugh voted against endors
ing Senator Goldwater and Clou
voted in favor of the move.
REGARDING THE Goldwater
endorsement, newly elected CYR
president John Gromala, in an ex
clusive interview with The Daily,
said, "It is utterly fantastic. Not
only for the first time in the his
tory of the YR have they given a
pro-primary endorsement but also
the endorsement was by a vote
of over 80 per cent of all dele
gates."
The victory indicated a marked
increase in conservative strength
since last year's YR convention in
Fresno, when Robert Gaston won
over liberal Ken Davis of Ventura
County by a vote of 179 to 160.
Groundwork for the conserva
tive sweep was laid al three ses
sions of a "conservative caucus"
attended by delegates agreeing lo
support the choices of the caucus.
THIS YEAR James Slaybaugh
refused to attend the caucus and
John Clou, the third candidate for
the presidency, visited tho caucus
briefly to tell the group that he
did not: approve of the procedure
;ind would not be bound by the

4
! results.
San Mateo county's Louanne
j Hudson was elected national com
mlitteewoman by the margin of
j 236 1 to 84 1 - over Carol Baceiocco
:of San Francisco, Mrs. Hudson
; had won the endorsement of the
j conservative caucus on Saturday.
(Her husband, Mike, lost in his
bid for the state presidency t wo
years ago by only four votes. Hud
son is a graduate of Stanford and
a former officer of the Stanford
area Young Republicans.)
MRS. HUDSON, a staunch Gold
lwater conservative, pledged to
j "work my heart out" for Repub
licans in 1964 and to "do all I
I can for the conservative cause
which has come so far in recent
years." She received a standing
ovation. Her election was to the
highest state office for which a
i member of the San Mateo County
j Young Republicans has ever been
j chosen.
Dan Harris of Riverside County
; was elected executive vice presi
dent by acclamation and Bo b
Pearl of Orange County was
elected national committeeman.
Both were choices of the conser
vative caucus.
Harris' political leanings were
indicated by one of the seconding
speeches for his nomination, which
asked the YR's to "continue elect
ing a team which will help the ele
phant point his trunk in the right
1 direction."
TO COMPLETE the sweep of
the top four offices Bob Pearl, im
mediate past treasurer of the
Young Republicans, was elected
by acclamation after a plea by
Bill Beer whom he defeated in the
caucus Saturday.
In his nominating speech Beer
said, "Party unity is built by those
who lose. We can only have party
unity if those who lose get behind
those who win."
Former Stanford Young Repub
licans elected to office were CYR's
treasurer Kent Kaiser and the Re
gion Five vice president Berkeley
Johnson.
THE SENTIMENT a g a inst
what some delegates called "me
tooism" was reflected even in the
opening prayer Sunday by the
CYR chaplain Bruce Anthony,
who asked that the delegates not
pay heed "to those who espouse
merely an amen philosophy." The
lack of support for any presiden
tial candidate other than Senator
Goldwater was unmistakable.
At the Los Angeles County
caucus on Saturday one of the un
successful candidates, Carol Boc
ciocco, expressed her surprise that
the delegates had not asked whom
she was supporting for the Re
publican presidential nomination.
"Oh, we know," someone in the
back of the room shouted, "Barry
; Goldwater. Everybody is for
1 Goldwater."
