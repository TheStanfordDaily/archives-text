. greater portion of the lineup, with
the vital pitching position rating
. as the big question mark.
Eight of the 11 pitchers are
! sophomores. Gone are last year's
top two twirlers, Jim Lonberg and
Darrell Sutherland, who led a
staff that ranked third in' the
country with a 1.70 earned run
average. Lone lettermen returnee
is righthander Dick Kovacevioh,
6-0 and 1.33 E.R.A. last season.

three frames in Tuesday's encoun
ter.
THE TEAM'S strong point is a
veteran infield led by all-CIBA
choice George Thacher at second

Bob Hollmann. who packs long)
ball power; shortstop, Gary Smith,:
who handled third base chores'
last year; and third base, Ken De-

iors with the exception of Holl
mann.
Slated for outfield duty are re
turning centerfielder Bob Cox,
who hit at a .269 pace, junior Rich
Berra, and sophs Cliff Harris and
