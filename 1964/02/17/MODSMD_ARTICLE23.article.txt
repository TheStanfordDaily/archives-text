The atavistic Bruins of UCLA
devoured the burly Indians of
Stanford 17-11 Saturday at Encina
Gym, hut not before taking some
solid lumps from the inspired, un
derdogs of the Farm.
There were some .luminous
standouts in Iho Cards losing ef
fort. At 123 pounds, Dick Ander
son did everything hut pin his
sorely outclassed UCLA opponent,
Dave Aaronscranz, as lie gained
a 9-0 victory.
ANOTHER STAR for the In
dians was co-captain Phil Kendall,
who edged the Bruins Don Mat
son 5-3, and rode atop him for
the greater part of the contest.
But the most impressive, "head
ing for the pro ranks" type grap
pler had to be big Duncan Ross,
the Stanford heavyweight. Ross
hardly gave the sundry, gathered
spectators time enough to glance
at their mimeographed programs
as he took ten seconds to take his
opponent, Russell Banducci down,
and another six to roll him onto
his shoulders for the pin.
