# Home Court Doesn't Assist Stanford, Cal
## 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
Off the results of this weekend's
i series of basketball games be
| tween Stanford and the Univer-
I sity of California, the fabled homo
i court advantage appears lo be
just that — a fable.
Nothing was settled in the two
grudge matches supposed to de
cide second place in the Big Six
as Stanford took the opener on
Friday night at Berkeley's Har
mon Gymnasium in easy fashion,
69-57, and Cal came back to ruin
the Indians' first home game in
more than a month. 59-52, on Sat
urday night.
THE TWO TEAMS thus remain
deadlocked in the second position
' in the AAWU race with six games
| remaining. Stanford faces UCLA's
; formidable Bruins next Saturday
| at the Pavilion, while Cal meets
I Washington at Cal.
Camden Wall once again was'
I the key to the Golden Bear off-1
onse this weekend, as he managed :
to hit 1 i and 15 points in the two
j games to more than offset the 12
| and 13 point performance of Tom
j Dose.
The Stanford victory Friday
night was due to Dose's pulling
Wall outside on defense, while also
! screening him out effectively on
Cal's offensive backboard. Satur
day Wall rebounded well in addi
tion to his scoring.
CAL JUMPED out in front Fri
day night on a Wall free throw,
but Bob Bedell put Stanford in
front to stay on a layup with
I 17:21 to go in the first half. Stan
ford stretched its margin to ten
points at the half, and was never
seriously threatened.
Bedell led Tribe scorers with 17
points in the opener, as he scored
heavily on the point of the Stan
ford fast break. Bedell, fastest
man on the team, has been doing
this fairly consistently of late, as
the Indians have usually domi
nated the backboards in their re
cent games.
Harmon Gym had to be the most
excited place in the Bay Area, as
the excited Cal fans stopped play
twice in the second half by throw
ing red-hot pennies on the floor.
The equally red-hot Cal rooters
even booed their popular athletic
director, Pote Newell, when he
asked them to refrain from their
playful pastime on penalty of for

feiture of Ihe ball game.
STANFORD WON the first ball
game because it could hardly miss
from the field in the first half.
The Indians shot 50 per cent to
the Bears' 25 and made the only
free throw they attempted while
Cal could convert only 9 of 17
from the charity stripe and trailed
33-23 at the intermission.
Saturday night was an entirely
different story. Almost before the
Indians knew what had hit them.
Wall, Dan Lufkin, Steve S m i th
and Dan Wolthers had combined
to give Cal a substantial 14 to 4
lead with only 7:15 gone in t he
first half.
Stanford was not to be beaten
that easily, though. The Cards
fought back to tie up the game at
23 all with 4:08 remaining in the
first period. Stanford oven led, 27-
25, at one point, but at the inter
mission it was 20 apiece.
Til 10 SECOND half saw the
Tribe take the tip, and s >on a six- 1
point lead at 48-42. This was the
high water mark for Stanford in
the game and it was downhill the
rest of ihe way, as no Indian could
find the mark, and the persistent
Cal pi-ess finally took its toll.
The Bears scored 12 straight
points, took a 56-50 lead, and hung
on to win the game 59-52. Key
move by the Bears in the second
half was having a guard fall back '
onto Dose when Stanford had the
ball.
Dose only got his hands on the
ball three times on offense except
on tip in attempts and scored not
a single point in the entire half.
FOR STANFORD, the most im
portant development of the week
end might have been the emer
gence of 6-9 Ray Kosanke as a de
pendable sixth man.
Kosanke was subbed in for Be
dell Friday night when the sopho
more forward got into foul trouble
early and scored 5 points with 5
rebounds in the rest of the half.
Saturday, it was Clay Raaka who
got into early trouble, and Ko
sanke did a fine rebounding job
while in the game.
