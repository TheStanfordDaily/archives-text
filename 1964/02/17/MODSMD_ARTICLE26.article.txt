# Ruggers Beat Uclans, 28-6
## 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Stanford turned loose ils pass
ing i ush oil tlie UCLA liruins Sat
1 urday in L<>s Angeles and the re
sult was as exported, a smashing
28-(i victory.
Stove Van Nort, who is nothing
less than a shifty locomotive ran
I for four tries, a seasonal mark.
! His jaunts were all off serum
: passes and ranged in yardage
I from 15 to 2."> yards.
Tin: INDIANS, playing their
j first away game, started slowly
ion a cold, windy day. In the early
I moments of the game, the back
field was throwing many passes i
j away but it soon was playing in
| its usual outstanding form,
j Gordon Waddell started t he
I scoring with a penalty kick, j
! UCLA's outstanding star, I J e t e r
Nieklin, kicked an equalizer soon i
after and Stanford was no better
I off than at the beginning of the
; game. It soon began moving the
i ball and held a commanding 14-31
score.
The Indian defense for the!
fourth time this season, kept its :
! opponent out of its goal area and i

allowed no scores except penally
kicks.
STANFORD I'LAYKD the sec
ond game of a rugliy double
header. The first game was a con
tesi between Cal and USC. and
the outcome was just as one-sided.
With a big, hustling scrum do
ing the damage, Cal romped 2.'V().
Tom Blanchfield, in his first year
of rugby, is a good runner a n d
kicker. SC couldn't handle him,
Stanford might be able to.
Getting the only other try be
sides Van Noil's four was Brad
Freeman, who culminated a long
rush with a l."> yard gallop into
the in-goal area. Waddell did the
kicking duties and added 111 points
via two penalty kicks and two
conversions.
STANFORD'S RISII depends
on getting the ball to scrum half
Bob Price and because of Dick
Leeuwenberg and Ron Fraboni
the Indians get the job done con
sistently. Fraboni, in his hooker
position, controls the scrum
throw-ins and Leeuwenberg pulls
down the lineout tosses. Each per
formed his specialty well against
the Uclans.
Also playing well were Frank
Patitucci and Jack Chappie in the
front line. Dick Ragsdale did a
fine job in his fullback position,
I both running and kicking.
