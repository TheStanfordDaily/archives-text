# Voter Registration Project: Challenge To Stanford
## Editorial 
### 
Stanford students have before them now
a great and noble challenge.
Because of the extraordinary interest
shown here last fall in the Aaron Henry for
Governor campaign, the University has
been chosen by civil rights leaders to co
ordinate West Coast efforts on behalf of the
Negro voter registration drive this summer
in Mississippi. Students from all parts of the
nation — hopefully numbering in the thou
sands — w ill be encouraged to travel to the
state lo work on the project.
Students are especially well suited for
this type of activity bccaausc most of them
have the available time, the freedom from
other responsibilities, the 1 training and the

physical endurance.
Behind this project lies a simple, unself
ish motive: the desire to assure all citizens
the right to vote. The project, which will be
conducted with the same dignity that was so
apparent in last summer's Washington March,
is being planned with the knowledge and co
operation of the Justic Dept.
Some might protest ASSU's role in the
the establishment of a proletariat to coordi
nate West Coast activities. But we think stu
dent government has a responsibility to deal
with such a matter — if only because so
many students have expressed an interest in
Mississippi civil rights work, a demonstrated
last fall.

We think there is a definite need for an
information center (the function of this sec
retariat) that will keep students informed
of the legal commitments, the unromantic
aspects and the danger; that will assure
proper job placement for students in the
project; and that will train students for the
work. And so we commend the Wed in Ad
ministration for assuming this responsibility.
Above all, we think the project affords an
ideal opportunity to prove that the educa
tional process is relevant to the great social
issues of the dav.

We hope Stanford will rise to the chal
lenge.
