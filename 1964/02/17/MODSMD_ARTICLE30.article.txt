# LASSU Protects Editorial Freedom
## 
### 
We congratulate the Legislature for de
feating an amendment Thursday night that
would have required The Daily to print
I,ASSU's agendas in our news columns in
advance of the meetings.
Such a proposal, if approved, would have
been a serious blow to the editorial freedom
of this newspaper. At present, The Daily
is editorially independent of ASSU and the

University. Hut such an amendment could
set a precedent for student government in
structing The Daily what and what not to
print.
LASSU substituted the suggested amend
ment with another one requiring that adver
tising space be bought in The I)<iili/. This
is a much wiser course of action because it
does not infringe upon our press freedom.
And it is patterned after the contract proce
dure many state governments have with
newspapers.
We are always happy to cooperate with
student government. But we have every in
tention of keeping our editorial independ
ence.
