# Perspective On The Future
## Church Would Change Presidential Succession 
### Stephen Shefler 
With the ink just drying on those copies of the Constitution
that include the new 24th Amendment (abolition of the poll tax).
Senator Frank Church has proposed a 25th Amendment that would
alter the system of Presidential succession. 11 this Amendment is
passed, it would give the people a decisive choice in who the new
Vice President will he when tragedy strikes as it did last Novem
ber 22nd.
The Church proposal would allow the new President to nomi
nate with the advice and consent of the United States Senate from
two to five candidates to lill the vacated post of the Vice Presi
dency. The House of Representatives would immediately choose
one of the nominees to lill the vacated post of the Vice Presidency.
The choice would be by a majority of the 435 Representatives, and
290 (two-thirds) would be required tor a quorum.
Senator Church says that this procedure would ensure that
the new Vice President would be acceptable to the President, but
the Senate's scrutiny would ensure the nominees were qualified,
while the final choice would rest with the House, which is most
representative ol the people.
Bevond the polite explanation of his proposal that the Sena
tor lias given rests the fact that many Americans leel uneasy that
Speaker |olin McCormick is just that "single heart-beat away from
the highest office in the land. It is the objections that are raised
to McCormick, however that make it imperative that the Church
proposal be given careful consideration.

The Speaker of the House while often a capable legislator may
lack the potential for dynamic Presidential leadership. The Speak
ership under Martin, Rayburn, and now McCormick has gone to
the senior member in terms ol service in the House. Further, the
Senate — not the House — is the legislative branch that deals with
foreign affairs. A third 1 actor is that the Speaker might represent
a choice made a decade before the Presidents death, while the
House election would more adequately represent the contempo
rary views ol the people.
Church's proposal would bring positive advantages into the
governmental system. By filling the vacancy in the Vice Presi
dential post, it would allow the leadership of the Senate to be
filled by choice not by chance. The lines of communication be
tween tlie legislator and the Executive would also be improved by
having an individual who participated actively in both realms.
Lastly if the new President were himself to die, it would prepare
his successor more 1 adequately by allowing him to play an active
role in the executive branch.

ership under Martin, Rayburn, and now McCormick has gone to
the senior member in terms ol service in the House. Further, the
Senate — not the House — is the legislative branch that deals with
foreign affairs. A third 1 actor is that the Speaker might represent
a choice made a decade before the Presidents death, while the
House election would more adequately represent the contempo
rary views ol the people.
Church's proposal would bring positive advantages into the
governmental system. By filling the vacancy in the Vice Presi
dential post, it would allow the leadership of the Senate to be
filled by choice not by chance. The lines of communication be
tween tlie legislator and the Executive would also be improved by
having an individual who participated actively in both realms.
Lastly if the new President were himself to die, it would prepare
his successor more 1 adequately by allowing him to play an active
role in the executive branch.

With the ink just drying on those copies of the Constitution
that include the new 24th Amendment (abolition of the poll tax).
Senator Frank Church has proposed a 25th Amendment that would
alter the system of Presidential succession. 11 this Amendment is
passed, it would give the people a decisive choice in who the new
Vice President will he when tragedy strikes as it did last Novem
ber 22nd.
The Church proposal would allow the new President to nomi
nate with the advice and consent of the United States Senate from
two to five candidates to lill the vacated post of the Vice Presi
dency. The House of Representatives would immediately choose
one of the nominees to lill the vacated post of the Vice Presidency.
The choice would be by a majority of the 435 Representatives, and
290 (two-thirds) would be required tor a quorum.
Senator Church says that this procedure would ensure that
the new Vice President would be acceptable to the President, but
the Senate's scrutiny would ensure the nominees were qualified,
while the final choice would rest with the House, which is most
representative ol the people.
Bevond the polite explanation of his proposal that the Sena
tor lias given rests the fact that many Americans leel uneasy that
Speaker |olin McCormick is just that "single heart-beat away from
the highest office in the land. It is the objections that are raised
to McCormick, however that make it imperative that the Church
proposal be given careful consideration.
