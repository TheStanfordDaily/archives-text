# Freedom Of Speech: Principle And Practice
## The 						Mailbox

I
Editor, The Daily:
Our liberal bretheren are con
tinually plighting their troth to
the principles of academic free
dom. absolute free speech, the free
marketplace of ideas, "truth will
out if but it have a chance," etc.
i It is interesting to note, then, that
posters announcing the Gol d
water Rally at the airport, within i
a day of being put up around
Quad, were all either torn down
or defaced, not, presumably, by j
, Goldwater supporters.
What could have impelled the!
fair - minded non • supporters of
Goldwater to such a childish ac- j
tion? Is their attitude one of "The ;
' marketplace of ideas is all right
in principle, but Goldwater's ideas
are too far out to risk exposing
i impressionable young college stu- \
dents?"

Editor, The Daily:
I have recently noted in the
Stanford Daily that Dartmouth
i College has inaugurated a brief
; summer cultural program for j
alunmi. presumbaly a recognition j
■ of the fact thai some of the "old
i grads" have need to catch up with
. ! tho intellectual demands of our
present generation. 1 have also
■ been told that a physicians' or
. ganization in San Francisco has
instituted a lecture series de
' signed to activate some of the dor
mant tissue in the non-profes
sional sectors of Bay Area doctors'
S brains. Additionally, a local busi
. ness specializing in improving
. reading skills offers a remedial j
„ reading course for top executives.
5 Is there any possibility that
Senator Goldwater might be in aj
.'position to avail himself of a pro-!
! gram similar to one of the above?
Although I (In not disparage the

quality of Senator Goldwater's
education at Staunton Military
Academy nor the value of the
experience lie gained in the de
partment store business and in
sifting through the arid sands of
Arizona politics, I imagine he
might benefit from a few brush
up courses. Perhaps he could even
find time, in spite of all his speak
ing commitments, to enroll here
at Stanford this summer par
ticularly since entrance require
ments are relaxed at that time.
The University must be offering
courses in International Relations.
Public Speaking, Economics, U.S.
History, and the like.
I am certain that the students
would be flattered to have Mr.
Goldwater on the campus this
summer. Speaking for myself. I
would be very pleased if he should
decide to enroll.

If Leo Holub is a good photog
rapher. lie has injured his reputa
tion by hanging most of the pic
tures now in the Art Gallery. II
he is an artist, this may not lie
his medium.
Inexcusably sloppy technique,
in the form of dusty and scratched ,
negative, has ruined a great num- j
ber of otherwise acceptable prints. >
A painter who unintentionally left
bits of brush and fingerprints on
an oil painting would be guilty of
equivalent carelessness. Non-ob- j
jective tilting of verticals audi
poor cropping are sloppy mistakes j
that have rendered several otheri
good pictures dull or pointlessly
unnerving.
Certainly the photos justly ap
peal to nnvone interested in St.in

ford and should bo shown for lhat
reason. Almost none of them have
qualities that would qualify them j
as art. Why then is L. Holub hung I
in the Art Gallery while Perm,
HaJsman, Shulthess, and Heyman
were "hanged" in TMU (Photog
raphy in the Fine ArtsK The im
plied comparison between Holub j
and these artists is irritating to;
anyone who hike photography
seriously as a fine art medium.
Before anyone promises $1.30
for "Stanford Seen" ho should con
sider the "Family of Man" or "The
Bitter Years" for the same price.
They do contain art.

5 Is there any possibility that

Although I (In not disparage the

quality of Senator Goldwater's
education at Staunton Military

experience lie gained in the de
partment store business and in
sifting through the arid sands of
Arizona politics, I imagine he
might benefit from a few brush
up courses. Perhaps he could even
find time, in spite of all his speak
ing commitments, to enroll here
at Stanford this summer par
ticularly since entrance require

The University must be offering
courses in International Relations.
Public Speaking, Economics, U.S.

I am certain that the students

Inexcusably sloppy technique,

A painter who unintentionally left
bits of brush and fingerprints on
an oil painting would be guilty of

poor cropping are sloppy mistakes j

Although I (In not disparage the

quality of Senator Goldwater's
education at Staunton Military
Academy nor the value of the
experience lie gained in the de
partment store business and in
sifting through the arid sands of
Arizona politics, I imagine he
might benefit from a few brush
up courses. Perhaps he could even
find time, in spite of all his speak
ing commitments, to enroll here
at Stanford this summer par
ticularly since entrance require
ments are relaxed at that time.
The University must be offering
courses in International Relations.
Public Speaking, Economics, U.S.
History, and the like.
I am certain that the students
would be flattered to have Mr.
Goldwater on the campus this
summer. Speaking for myself. I
would be very pleased if he should
decide to enroll.

If Leo Holub is a good photog
rapher. lie has injured his reputa
tion by hanging most of the pic
tures now in the Art Gallery. II
he is an artist, this may not lie
his medium.
Inexcusably sloppy technique,
in the form of dusty and scratched ,
negative, has ruined a great num- j
ber of otherwise acceptable prints. >
A painter who unintentionally left
bits of brush and fingerprints on
an oil painting would be guilty of
equivalent carelessness. Non-ob- j
jective tilting of verticals audi
poor cropping are sloppy mistakes j
that have rendered several otheri
good pictures dull or pointlessly
unnerving.
Certainly the photos justly ap
peal to nnvone interested in St.in

ford and should bo shown for lhat
reason. Almost none of them have
qualities that would qualify them j
as art. Why then is L. Holub hung I
in the Art Gallery while Perm,
HaJsman, Shulthess, and Heyman
were "hanged" in TMU (Photog
raphy in the Fine ArtsK The im
plied comparison between Holub j
and these artists is irritating to;
anyone who hike photography
seriously as a fine art medium.
Before anyone promises $1.30
for "Stanford Seen" ho should con
sider the "Family of Man" or "The
Bitter Years" for the same price.
They do contain art.
