# Notes And Observations
## Does Student Interest Have To Be Channeled? 
### John Bonine 
"Stanford students are apatlietie. . . . They don t care about
important issues. . . . Tliev are not concerned with their student
government.
The tune is an old, familiar one. Pick up any student news
paper from any college and you find the same dire warnings about
the State of the Student Body.
Are Stanford students all lluil apathetic. Where tliev arc
apathetic, do they not have reason to be?
At Stanford the Young Republicans number over -50 members,
the Young Democrats 125, the Goldwater Committee oxer 100.
Segments of the Stanford student body travel to Mississippi, work
in elections from San Francisco to San Jose, participate in political
conventions all over the nation and state, attend campus programs
lectures to the point of overflowing the auditoriums — and all this
despite greater devotion to studies than is present at most colleges.
"Apathy" comes in when the focus shifts to the ASSU, LASS (J,
the Student Congress, and such. Analyzing these reveals a defi
nite pattern. Apart from the general mistake of interpreting apathy
toward .s-pccific programs to be apathy toward all programs, there
is a question both of the effectiveness and relevance ol these
organizations to the goal of "increasing student awareness in
polities.

Yet the apathy continues unabated in spite of — or, perhaps,
because of — efforts of the current ASSU and LASSU leaders. In
fact, the outcome of these efforts seems often to be even the oppo
site of their intentions. W hen LASSU does something worthwhile
—such as extending Library hours or investigating religious policy
—people get interested. W hen LASSU tries to find issues or creotc
controversy the students yawn quietly and turn to the sports page
of the Daily—or else object to LASSU's presuming to "represent
the views of the student body. The comment of a friend of mine
was typical: "1 don't agree that the students are apathetic about
off-campus issues. 1 just don't agree that their interest has to be
organized by LASSU."
Conversely, the failure of the Student Congress is often cited
as a case of student apathy toward politics in general. But here
the problem seems to be simply that the Student Congress coiwcpl
bears no relation to the needs or desires of the students. The
Stanford student much prefers the spontaneous bull-sessions which
take place every night in every dorm. Or he would rather partici
pate directly in the political process through such organizations
as the YRs and YDs (just look at their size relative to the Student
Congress). Still others want to concentrate on promoting a par
ticular cause.
The failure of our campus politicians to come to grips with
political apathy is due to their insistence on channeling "aware
ness" and "interest" through their pet organizations. Apathy will
be eradicated less by their constant pleas against it than by pro
moting those activities and organizations in which students have
shown an interest.
