## Students Need A Lobby 
### 
What students need is a powerful lobby. Unfortunately, they
do not have the funds to support a professional, full-time one, but
a little more pressure from somewhere might have pushed the
education tax relief amendments through the Senate yesterday.
Such a lobby could impress Congressmen with Ihe truth ol
Sen. Ribieoff's statement, "Investment in the education of college
students is just as entitled to tax-credit as in\ estment in a new plant
and equipment." Thcv would point out that education is as sound
an investment, in terms of the end product (an educated eitzenry),
as any capital outlay.
As student experience with the State Legislature last spring
demonstrated, the time to start pushing for something is not after
the issue has come out of committee.
Tuition or taxes, the student lobby must be active year around
to be effective. Editorial, Minnesota Daily, Feb. 5, Utfil.
