Thanks t» a friendly girl \
\ in a brown coat working as s
| a guide in Hoover Tower, "a J
t cynical 'old' grad of 10-+- s
J years ago who fell thai only |
S rich, snohhy people went to \
* Stanford," found new faith in J
s his alma mater. \
J For the first time since he )
S had graduated, this alumims, s
j who has remained anonym-
\ oils, took his family on a tour s
| of the campus and was overly |
s impressed by the student \
{ guides who. he said in a J
s letter to President Sterling, \
J were "wonderful people, par- |
S tieularly the girl in Hoover \
| Tower last Sunday afternoon. |
\ She was kind and warm and s
J friendly, especially to cliil- )
S dren." *
| He added that "when I J
s went to school, guides were (
J nobodies of any real impor- J
\ tance. Vet this one girl did s
J more for Stanford in 15 nun- J
\ utes than I've done in 1 :"> i
J years. I doubt very much if J
\ she is typical of today's un-
J dergraduate lull at least you J
\ have one!" \
j AS A RESULT of the fa- J
vocable impression this alum- \
} mis was given of Stanford, J
\ when he received a call from \
j a PACK solicitor short! y |
thereafter, lie contributed, \
J "... believe it or not, I made J
\ a pledge. It was then that I *
* realized how Impressed I was J
\ with that guide." He added \
j that, "Even though my wife J
{ went lo Cal —my kids now
S think Stanford's great — all *
because of a wonderful,
s warm, friendly girl in a J
{ brown coat. So you see, I had
S no choice when the PACE J
