### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
Stanford has been selected by
national civil rights leaders to
serve as ihc West Coast co-or
dinator for college students plan
ning to engage in a massive Mis
sissippi civil rights drive this
summer.
The Council of Federated Organ
izations (COFO) which includes
the Student Non-Violent Co-or
dinating Committee (SNCCi, the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC>, the Congress
of Racial Equality (CORE), and
tht NAACP decided last week to
use students from all parts of the
country in a voter registration
drive in Mississippi. Yale w i 1 1
serve as the co-ordmator in the
East.
ASSU PRESIDENT Bud Wedin
announced Thursday the creation
of a Civil Rights Secretariat to
serve as a Stanford Civil Rights
information center and to prepare
the Stanford Civil Rights Confer
ence for the Western states.
A meeting to distribute infor
mation on the Secretariat a n d
the Mississippi project will be
held today at 4:15 p.m. in room
274 of Tresidder Union. A brief
film "Never Turn Back" will also
be shown.
llene Strelitz, named by Wedin
as one of the co-chairmen of the
Secretariat, called the project
necessary if only to inform the
large numbers of Stanford stu
dents who will be going to Mis
sissippi this summer of the pos
sible legal ramifications, and of
the dangers and reprisals they
may face.
She said: "Whether or not
ASSU were to facilitate organ
ized dispensing of information, a
large number of Stanford stu
dents, as indicated by the inter
est shown in the November Mis
sissippi mock election, would go
to Mississippi this summer. A re
alistic picture of their role de
pends upon the responsibility
assumed by ASSU. The Secreta
riat is organized for the protec
tion of those Stanford students."

ACCORDING TO Wedin, Gary
Schoolnik will be the coordinator
of the conference to he held here
this spring and Miss Strelitz will
be the coordinator of civil rights
information.
The drive planned by COFO
will consist of several parts
voter registration, free do m
schools and community centers.
To staff these projects adequate
ly, hundreds of university stu
dents will be needed, Wedin said.
In addition, clergy, lawyers and

college teachers are being recruit
ed for summer work. The Stan
ford fund raising is being planned
around the arrival of Martin
Luther King this spring for the
Civil Rights Conference.
STANFORD WILL be given di
rect access to information and
planning from Mississippi and
will relay this information to in
terested students and other West
tern colleges. The University of
Oregon and Pomona have been
named as sub-coordinators, or
ganizing their areas. Harvard and
Oberlin will serve in the same
role with Yale in the East.
Miss St relit/ stressed the fact
that the Secretariat will not take
"an official stand" on the civil
rights issue, but will merely pro
vide information to students in
terested in the subject. "We will
also pass on information to stu
dents from any organization in
volved in civil rights in Missis
sippi, such as the White Citizens
councils," she said.
Wedin asked LASSIJ Thursday
for $300 to finance the Secreta
riat's clerical expenses, but Ihe
Legislature tabled th e proposal
for further study.
< OFO HKGAKDS the Missis
sippi civil rights drive this sum
mer ;is cine of primary impor
tance and as a sequel to last
year's Washington March.
In conjunction with the voter
regist rat ion program, N eg r o e s
will run for Congress in all of
Mississippi's five districts.
Civil rights groups, Miss
Strelitz pointed out that major
victories in Mississippi this sum
mer would aid immeasurably in
breaking down descrimination in
both the North and South and if
the drive is to suceecd large stu
dent support is needed.
Wedin said thai COFO contact
ed Stanford 1o serve as an infor
mation center of the drive "pri
marily because of the great inter
est shown by the student body in
the mock election held in Missis
sippi last November." Stanford
students collected several thou
sand dollars for the election, a

well as providing some campaign
workers.
The role of Stanford students
in the project, aside from work
ing in the information center,
would be as individuals, without
representing any official Stanford
position.
Students involved in tne Missis
sipi project would serve in either
of two areas: working in voter
registration loams or in the com
munity centers and schools, in
which students with special skills
are needed.
The sponsors of the Secretariat
feel that by financing it, "ASSU
both responds to the interests of
its membership and assures more
responsible placemen! of students
in jobs, will keep students aware
of legal implications and attempt
to assure they are adequately
knowledgeable and trained for
the work in which they will en
gage."

ACCORDING TO Wedin, Gary
Schoolnik will be the coordinator
of the conference to he held here
this spring and Miss Strelitz will
be the coordinator of civil rights
information.
The drive planned by COFO
will consist of several parts
voter registration, free do m
schools and community centers.
To staff these projects adequate
ly, hundreds of university stu
dents will be needed, Wedin said.
In addition, clergy, lawyers and

college teachers are being recruit
ed for summer work. The Stan
ford fund raising is being planned
around the arrival of Martin
Luther King this spring for the
Civil Rights Conference.
STANFORD WILL be given di
rect access to information and
planning from Mississippi and
will relay this information to in
terested students and other West
tern colleges. The University of
Oregon and Pomona have been
named as sub-coordinators, or
ganizing their areas. Harvard and
Oberlin will serve in the same
role with Yale in the East.
Miss St relit/ stressed the fact
that the Secretariat will not take
"an official stand" on the civil
rights issue, but will merely pro
vide information to students in
terested in the subject. "We will
also pass on information to stu
dents from any organization in
volved in civil rights in Missis
sippi, such as the White Citizens
councils," she said.
Wedin asked LASSIJ Thursday
for $300 to finance the Secreta

Legislature tabled th e proposal
for further study.

Civil rights groups, Miss
Strelitz pointed out that major
victories in Mississippi this sum

breaking down descrimination in
both the North and South and if

Wedin said thai COFO contact
ed Stanford 1o serve as an infor

marily because of the great inter
est shown by the student body in
the mock election held in Missis
sippi last November." Stanford
students collected several thou
sand dollars for the election, a

well as providing some campaign
workers.
The role of Stanford students
in the project, aside from work
ing in the information center,
would be as individuals, without
representing any official Stanford
position.
Students involved in tne Missis
sipi project would serve in either
of two areas: working in voter
registration loams or in the com
munity centers and schools, in
which students with special skills
are needed.
The sponsors of the Secretariat
feel that by financing it, "ASSU
both responds to the interests of
its membership and assures more
responsible placemen! of students
in jobs, will keep students aware
of legal implications and attempt
to assure they are adequately
knowledgeable and trained for

Legislature tabled th e proposal
for further study.

In conjunction with the voter

Civil rights groups, Miss

victories in Mississippi this sum
mer would aid immeasurably in
breaking down descrimination in
both the North and South and if
the drive is to suceecd large stu
dent support is needed.
Wedin said thai COFO contact
ed Stanford 1o serve as an infor
mation center of the drive "pri
marily because of the great inter
est shown by the student body in
the mock election held in Missis
sippi last November." Stanford
students collected several thou
sand dollars for the election, a

well as providing some campaign
workers.
The role of Stanford students
in the project, aside from work
ing in the information center,
would be as individuals, without
representing any official Stanford
position.
Students involved in tne Missis
sipi project would serve in either
of two areas: working in voter
registration loams or in the com
munity centers and schools, in
which students with special skills
are needed.
The sponsors of the Secretariat
feel that by financing it, "ASSU
both responds to the interests of
its membership and assures more
responsible placemen! of students
in jobs, will keep students aware
of legal implications and attempt
to assure they are adequately
knowledgeable and trained for
the work in which they will en
gage."
Stanford has been selected by
national civil rights leaders to
serve as ihc West Coast co-or
dinator for college students plan
ning to engage in a massive Mis
sissippi civil rights drive this
summer.
The Council of Federated Organ
izations (COFO) which includes
the Student Non-Violent Co-or
dinating Committee (SNCCi, the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC>, the Congress
of Racial Equality (CORE), and

use students from all parts of the
country in a voter registration

ASSU PRESIDENT Bud Wedin
announced Thursday the creation
of a Civil Rights Secretariat to
serve as a Stanford Civil Rights
information center and to prepare
the Stanford Civil Rights Confer
ence for the Western states.
A meeting to distribute infor
mation on the Secretariat a n d
the Mississippi project will be
held today at 4:15 p.m. in room
274 of Tresidder Union. A brief
film "Never Turn Back" will also
be shown.
llene Strelitz, named by Wedin
as one of the co-chairmen of the
Secretariat, called the project
necessary if only to inform the
large numbers of Stanford stu
dents who will be going to Mis
sissippi this summer of the pos
sible legal ramifications, and of
the dangers and reprisals they
may face.
She said: "Whether or not
ASSU were to facilitate organ
ized dispensing of information, a
large number of Stanford stu
dents, as indicated by the inter
est shown in the November Mis
sissippi mock election, would go
to Mississippi this summer. A re
alistic picture of their role de
pends upon the responsibility
assumed by ASSU. The Secreta
riat is organized for the protec
tion of those Stanford students."

ACCORDING TO Wedin, Gary
Schoolnik will be the coordinator
of the conference to he held here
this spring and Miss Strelitz will
be the coordinator of civil rights
information.
The drive planned by COFO
will consist of several parts
voter registration, free do m
schools and community centers.
To staff these projects adequate
ly, hundreds of university stu
dents will be needed, Wedin said.
In addition, clergy, lawyers and

college teachers are being recruit
ed for summer work. The Stan
ford fund raising is being planned
around the arrival of Martin
Luther King this spring for the
Civil Rights Conference.
STANFORD WILL be given di
rect access to information and
planning from Mississippi and
will relay this information to in
terested students and other West
tern colleges. The University of
Oregon and Pomona have been
named as sub-coordinators, or
ganizing their areas. Harvard and
Oberlin will serve in the same
role with Yale in the East.
Miss St relit/ stressed the fact
that the Secretariat will not take
"an official stand" on the civil
rights issue, but will merely pro
vide information to students in
terested in the subject. "We will
also pass on information to stu
dents from any organization in
volved in civil rights in Missis
