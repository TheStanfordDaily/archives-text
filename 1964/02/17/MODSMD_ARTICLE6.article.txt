# THE 						HALLUCINOGENICS
## Exile Of The Drug Cult

The hallucinogenic drug cult has apparently
spread to Yale University.
Recently, several Yale undergraduates had to
be placed under psychiatric care after suffering
mental disturbances induced by the drug mescaline,
the Yale News reported. Use of the drugs at Yale
was a completely unauthorized informal experi
ment on the part of a group of undergraduates in
one of the residential colleges. Members of the
faculty became aware of the situation only after
several undergraduates were brought in or volun
tarily sought psychiatric help.
AS THE NEWS quickly pointed out. the insti
gator of this corruption was that citadel of con
temporary college scandal Harvard where
this uvant garde eultus originated in 1960 led by
two professors, Richard Alport, an assistant pro
fessor of clinical psychology who distinguished
himself in child psychology at Stanford, and his
associate, Timothy Leary. The two men had con
ducted experiments with over 100 volunteer stu
dents in that time, until one student blithely saun
tered into the rush-hour traffic on Boston's Hunt
ington Avenue "believing he was God and nothing
could touch him." Luckily, the student escaped
unhurt: the research program was not so lucky.
It was abrogated soon afterwards.
Dismayed yet undaunted. Alport and Leary took
their project off-campus. After a brief, unsuccess
ful! fling at rehabilitating inmates at a local prison
through psilocybin "therapy," they took off for
the Mexican resort town of Zihauatanejo in the
summer of 19G2 to continue their tests with any

Harvard students who happened to pass that way.
"Harvard-in-Zihuatanejo" was relatively suc
cessful, or, at least, its founders thought so. For
son after returning to Cambridge last fall, they
created a new private organization the Interna
tional Federation for Internal Freedom (1FIF)
to carry on the struggle for "unlimited horizons
and internal freedom."
MEANWHILE, Harvard students were chafing
at the University and Federal Drug Administra
tion regulations which prohibited I hem from buy
ing the drugs legally. And although Dean John
Monroe (the noted commentator on Harvard sex
ual mores) warned the students not to take the
drugs, l he students went ahead anyway and bought
them off the newly blossomed black market.
Thus, last spring, a new character appeared in
Harvard Square the Ivy League junkie, button
down turtleneck sweater and all, pushing his mes
caline pills and sugar cubes spiked with LSD. Some
energizing students decided to eliminate the mid
dleman by taking organic chemistry courses solely
to learn how to synthesize mescaline. Still others
took up eating morning-gory seeds in great quan
tities.
At this point, the University decided it was lime
to remove Mssrs. Alpert and Leary. After a brief
investigation, Harvard's governing body the
Corporation fired the both of them last May.
And the Mexican government took a dim view of
the Zihauatanejo training center and. last June,
threw the IFIF group out of the country. Pres
ently. IFIF is as tenuous an organization as its
intitials would imply. No sovereign body seems
to want "internal freedom," not even Harvard, 01
Yale.

was a completely unauthorized informal experi
ment on the part of a group of undergraduates in
one of the residential colleges. Members of the
faculty became aware of the situation only after
several undergraduates were brought in or volun
tarily sought psychiatric help.
AS THE NEWS quickly pointed out. the insti
gator of this corruption was that citadel of con
temporary college scandal Harvard where
this uvant garde eultus originated in 1960 led by
two professors, Richard Alport, an assistant pro
fessor of clinical psychology who distinguished
himself in child psychology at Stanford, and his
associate, Timothy Leary. The two men had con
ducted experiments with over 100 volunteer stu
dents in that time, until one student blithely saun
tered into the rush-hour traffic on Boston's Hunt
ington Avenue "believing he was God and nothing
could touch him." Luckily, the student escaped
unhurt: the research program was not so lucky.
It was abrogated soon afterwards.
Dismayed yet undaunted. Alport and Leary took
their project off-campus. After a brief, unsuccess
ful! fling at rehabilitating inmates at a local prison
through psilocybin "therapy," they took off for
the Mexican resort town of Zihauatanejo in the
summer of 19G2 to continue their tests with any

Harvard students who happened to pass that way.
"Harvard-in-Zihuatanejo" was relatively suc
cessful, or, at least, its founders thought so. For
son after returning to Cambridge last fall, they
created a new private organization the Interna
tional Federation for Internal Freedom (1FIF)
to carry on the struggle for "unlimited horizons
and internal freedom."
MEANWHILE, Harvard students were chafing
at the University and Federal Drug Administra
tion regulations which prohibited I hem from buy
ing the drugs legally. And although Dean John
Monroe (the noted commentator on Harvard sex
ual mores) warned the students not to take the
drugs, l he students went ahead anyway and bought
them off the newly blossomed black market.
Thus, last spring, a new character appeared in
Harvard Square the Ivy League junkie, button
down turtleneck sweater and all, pushing his mes
caline pills and sugar cubes spiked with LSD. Some
energizing students decided to eliminate the mid
dleman by taking organic chemistry courses solely
to learn how to synthesize mescaline. Still others
took up eating morning-gory seeds in great quan
tities.
At this point, the University decided it was lime
to remove Mssrs. Alpert and Leary. After a brief
investigation, Harvard's governing body the
Corporation fired the both of them last May.
And the Mexican government took a dim view of
the Zihauatanejo training center and. last June,
threw the IFIF group out of the country. Pres
ently. IFIF is as tenuous an organization as its
intitials would imply. No sovereign body seems
to want "internal freedom," not even Harvard, 01
Yale.
