## 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
The Wood side Town Coun
cil voted unanimously Friday
night to appropriate a $150,-
000 contribution to place
powerlines to Stanford's Lin
ear Accelerator underground.
The effect of this appropri
ation would he to quadruple
the town's tax rate from 25
cents per $100 valuation to
an estimated $1 per .SUM)
valuat ion.
LOCAL CITIZENS groups
in the area have opposed run
ning overhead lines to SLAC
because of fears that the line
would spoil the beauty of the
foothills. However, under
ground lines would cost
about $1.(5 million more than
the overhead lines and would
be less desirable for the proj
ect.
A joint Congrcssion bear
ing three weeks ago referred
the matter back to the local
groups concerned to find a
compromise.
Paul N. McClosky, Jr., a
Palo Alto attorney and mem
ber of the Save Our Skylines
committee (SOS) proposed a
compromise in which all the
involved parties would part
of the cost of tile $2.H million
project.
PG&E would be $1,012,000,
Woodsidc $150,000, Stanford
$500,000, the AEC $700,000
and San Mateo County, the
rest.

Woodside's appropriation
makes it the lirst group to
approve flie compromise, al
though the town's share is
the smallest.
FRIDAY'S MEETING at
the YV o o (I si d e Elementary
School was attended by about
250 citizens, of whom only
two or three opposed the tax
Increase.
San Mateo County prob-

ably will discuss its proposed J
share of $300,000 on its Tues- *
day meeting 1 and Stanford's J
Board of Trustees will prob- \
ably consider the University's J
share at a meeting Thursday. *
Mayor Donald Graham of J
Woodside said that the AFC s
has been willing t<Â» put up J
only about $220,000 toward *
underground lines.
Graham was pleased by the \
move of the council to put up J
the $150,000 share, saying \
after meeting, "Now this is J
a little town that cares." \
MeCLOSKY HAD told the \
council that the town's posi- s
tion would be "immensely J
strengthened" if Woodside \
would put "money where the J
words are."
Other SOS spokesmen said s
the increase in taxes would \
be about 7 to 10 percent of J
last year's total Sun Mateo s
County taxes, J
Another meeting of the
parities i n vo I v e (I in the J
powerline dispute will l>e held \
today at the SLAC adminis- J
tration building. The meeting \
will be open to the public.
Another citizens group, the \
Committee for Green Foot- *
bills, announced last week }
the beginning of a petition *
drive to urge Congress to {
change the powerline route *
through the Foothills and to }
authorize the AFC to "spend *
an equitable share of the un- \
dergrounding costs." i
