what's a Shirt?
To Gant, it's more than fabric; it's flair, fit, show—3 vital "inherents," visible
only when a shirt is worn. Gant is finicky about shirts—fit and roll of collar,
proper amount of "show" when jacket is worn. Gant is finicky about drape,
fold, trim; all must "homogenize" to achieve flair—that viable ingredient
which gives the wearer comfort and aplomb.
Been taking your shirts for granted? Many men do.Try Gant; we think,
they'll be a tradition with you. At discerning stores.
