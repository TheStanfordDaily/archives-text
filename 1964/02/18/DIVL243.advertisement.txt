WHAT IS A JEW?
Who arc these people who call themselves It ws a race, a nation, or a religious
group? It is obvious that there are dark skinned, light skinned, t hiuese, and
Russian Jews. Today Judaism the religion is torn into many factions. I here are
orthodox Jews who follow the Torah as interpreted by the '1 alnuul and other com
mentaries. There are conservative Jews who feel they have a happy medium, and
there arc liberal Jews who believe that they have brought the. faith iip-torlate.
The history of the Jewish people can be traced baek at least 4000 years. No
race or nation has endured such persecution and dispersion, and yet retained their
basic identity. In race and religion the Jews share a common root, and this root is
described in the (lid Testament record. Jewish Scholars and ( hristians agree that
the Old Tcstment is tin- best history of the Jews, ami the best source of information
on their origin anil faith.
"Now the Lord said to Abram, (let thee out of thy country and from thy kindred,
and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee, and make thy name
great; and though shalt be a blessing: And I will bless them that bless thee, and
curse them that curse thee: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
(Jen. 12:1-3.
God's promise to Abraham was to he fulfilled through tin line of descent of one
particular miu. Isaac, and one particular son of Isaac. Jacob. Jacob's name was
changed to Israel (Hebrew, for: "God strives") which was to Israel, symbolic
of the spiritual truth of (iod's selection of a chosen people:
"And he said. Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a
prince hast thou power with God and men, and hast prevailed." Gen. 32-28^
The descendcnts of Jacob, then, constitute the chosen people of God, Israel.
"O ye seed of Israel his servant, yi children of Jacob, his chosen ones." 1
t*h ron. 16:13.
The nation Israel was raised up. to aflinu and teach that there is but one God.
While the rest of the world was idolatrous. God revealed llimselt repeatedly to the
Jews and dealt with them in a unique way. The Jews as Gods chosen people were
entrusted with the Holy Scriptures. Holy men of God, devout Jews, spake as they
were moved by the Holy Spirit, resulting in the Bible we have today. It is believed
that only Luke war. not a Jew.
The Jewish race was also the race into which the Saviour of mankind. Jesus
Christ, was horn. The lineage of ('hrist can he traced back to David and Abraham
(.Matt. 1. Luke. 3:23-288).
The Jews were and still arc a chosen people of God_ Ioda\ Jesils ( hrist wel
comes Jews and Gentiles alike to become members of 11 i- invisible church, the body
of believers. Any Jew or any Gentile who accepts Jcstts Christ as personal Saviour
as personal Saviour will immediately become a l hnslian and know the joy of salva
tion and a close bond with the one true, living God who has never changed, and is
the same Jehovah (or Yahweh) that the Jews worshipped in Old Testament times.
"What then? Are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved
both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; As it is written. There is none
righteous, no not one: There is none that iinderstandeth. then- is none that seeketh
after God." Rom. 3:9-11.
"For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Ixjrd
over all is rich unto all that call upon him. I''or whosover shall call upon the name of
the Lord shall be saved." Rom. 10:12-13.
