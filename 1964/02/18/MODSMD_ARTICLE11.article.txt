# Overseas Scholarship Committee Organized
## 
### JIM HAAS 
After reappraisal of the efforts
of the ASSU to deal with foreign
students and scholarships, two
new Commission were established
by LASSU.
No longer will the student body
offer scholarships indiscrimin
ately to foreign students to come
to Stanford for a year. Instead
a scholarship program will be
operated on an exchange basis
with several overseas universities.
BOTH UNIVERSITIES will act
as partners and each year select
a student to come to Stanford
whom they consider outstanding.
This eliminates the difficult selec
tion process of the past and
should build a more lasting tie
between Stanford and the foreign
universities.
More important to the Stanford
student body, the reciprocal ex
changes will offer opportunity for
study abroad for a year.
Exchanges have been operated
for many years by the lIR with
the Free University in Berlin,
Keio University in Japan and
Makerere College in Uganda.
Next year the Commission will
add to these a university in Latin
America, the Middle East, and
South East Asia, thus covering
all the different areas of the
world.
CURRENTLY, THE ASSU and
the University provide the funds
for the expenses of the foreign
students at Stanford and in some
cases the foreign universities
assist Stanford students. More
funds to support Stanford stu
dents may be obtained in the fu
ture.
The Foreign Student Housing
Commission will offer greater op
portunity to the present foreign
student community to live in on
campus residences. Interested
campus living groups may join
the program each quarter by pay
ing a standard fee to the Com
mission.
FOREIGN STUDENTS wishing
to participate may apply with the
Commission, but there is no selec
tion involved. A living group may
select a particular student, or the
Commission will place them as it

thinks best considering Iho group
and the student.
The foreign students' financial
resources will be examined by the
Financial Aids Office. If they can
not afford to live in an on-cam
pus residence, the Commission
will grant them a stipend suffi
cient to cover the difference. The
foreign student will then pay his
full room and board expenses at
his living group.
THIS PROGRAM will allow

many more foreign students to
live in residences at a signific
antly reduced cost to the living
groups.
A chairman and vice chairman
are needed for the Overseas
Scholarship Commission and for
the Foreign Student Housing
Commission for next year. Per
sons interested for either office
should sign up for interviews at
the ASSU office by 5 p.m. next
Monday.

Commission will place them as it

thinks best considering Iho group
and the student.
The foreign students' financial
resources will be examined by the
Financial Aids Office. If they can
not afford to live in an on-cam
pus residence, the Commission
will grant them a stipend suffi
cient to cover the difference. The
foreign student will then pay his
full room and board expenses at
his living group.
THIS PROGRAM will allow

many more foreign students to
live in residences at a signific
antly reduced cost to the living
groups.
A chairman and vice chairman
are needed for the Overseas
Scholarship Commission and for
the Foreign Student Housing
Commission for next year. Per
sons interested for either office
should sign up for interviews at
the ASSU office by 5 p.m. next
Monday.
After reappraisal of the efforts
of the ASSU to deal with foreign
students and scholarships, two
new Commission were established
by LASSU.
No longer will the student body
offer scholarships indiscrimin
ately to foreign students to come
to Stanford for a year. Instead
a scholarship program will be
operated on an exchange basis
with several overseas universities.
BOTH UNIVERSITIES will act
as partners and each year select
a student to come to Stanford
whom they consider outstanding.
This eliminates the difficult selec
tion process of the past and
should build a more lasting tie
between Stanford and the foreign
universities.
More important to the Stanford
student body, the reciprocal ex
changes will offer opportunity for
study abroad for a year.
Exchanges have been operated
for many years by the lIR with
the Free University in Berlin,
Keio University in Japan and
Makerere College in Uganda.
Next year the Commission will
add to these a university in Latin
America, the Middle East, and
South East Asia, thus covering
all the different areas of the
world.
CURRENTLY, THE ASSU and
the University provide the funds
for the expenses of the foreign
students at Stanford and in some
cases the foreign universities
assist Stanford students. More
funds to support Stanford stu
dents may be obtained in the fu
ture.
The Foreign Student Housing
Commission will offer greater op
portunity to the present foreign
student community to live in on
campus residences. Interested
campus living groups may join
the program each quarter by pay
ing a standard fee to the Com
mission.
FOREIGN STUDENTS wishing
to participate may apply with the
Commission, but there is no selec
tion involved. A living group may
select a particular student, or the
Commission will place them as it

thinks best considering Iho group
and the student.
