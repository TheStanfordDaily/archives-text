chance, to stage an all out campaign for
the man of your schemes, and it's all legal.
Monday is chauffeur day—and if you don't
have a car, we trust he'll gladly turn the
keys over to you. Though Palm Drive may
be missing a few trees when it's all over,
we're sure the University won't mind a
little free pruning. Tuesday is carry-his
hooks day—no matter how far, no matter
how heavy. Wednesday, you can buy him
coffee and donuts at Engineering Corner.
Nothing, absolutely, will be sold to men.
Thursday is wash-his-car day, since you may
want to get rid of all that eucalyptus pollen,
and bark marks on his fender. Friday, you
may remember, is a holiday, so you're on
your own. May we suggest you kiss off to
tlx- beach, or line up a coupleof bikes and
find what those hills are all about. Bachelor's
Week, sponsored by AWS, is a Stanford
tradition. Go girls.

Monday is chauffeur day—and if you don't
have a car, we trust he'll gladly turn the
keys over to you. Though Palm Drive may
be missing a few trees when it's all over,
we're sure the University won't mind a

how heavy. Wednesday, you can buy him
coffee and donuts at Engineering Corner.
Nothing, absolutely, will be sold to men.
Thursday is wash-his-car day, since you may
want to get rid of all that eucalyptus pollen,
and bark marks on his fender. Friday, you
may remember, is a holiday, so you're on
your own. May we suggest you kiss off to
tlx- beach, or line up a coupleof bikes and

The Daily regrets an error of omission in
Friday's article, "CORE In Action." It was

ford Shopping Center stores for a non

day night celebrated the beginning of the
annual Bachelor Week. Now girls, is your
chance, to stage an all out campaign for
the man of your schemes, and it's all legal.
Monday is chauffeur day—and if you don't
have a car, we trust he'll gladly turn the
keys over to you. Though Palm Drive may
be missing a few trees when it's all over,
we're sure the University won't mind a
little free pruning. Tuesday is carry-his
hooks day—no matter how far, no matter
how heavy. Wednesday, you can buy him
coffee and donuts at Engineering Corner.
Nothing, absolutely, will be sold to men.
Thursday is wash-his-car day, since you may
want to get rid of all that eucalyptus pollen,
and bark marks on his fender. Friday, you
may remember, is a holiday, so you're on
your own. May we suggest you kiss off to
tlx- beach, or line up a coupleof bikes and
find what those hills are all about. Bachelor's
Week, sponsored by AWS, is a Stanford
tradition. Go girls.

Monday is chauffeur day—and if you don't

be missing a few trees when it's all over,
we're sure the University won't mind a

Nothing, absolutely, will be sold to men.
Thursday is wash-his-car day, since you may
