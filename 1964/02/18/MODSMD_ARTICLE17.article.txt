### 
Stanford's baseball team opens
its 1964 campaign this afternoon
at 3 o'clock on the Sunken Dia
mond against the University of
San Francisco.
LAST SEASON the Indians
spilt with the Dons in two games,
losing their opener to the USF
nine by a 7 to 5 count and coming
back to whip the Dons two games
later, 9 to 2.
Stanford last year finished its
season with a mediocre Califor
nia Intercollegiate Baseball Asso
ciation mark of 8 and 8. Perhaps
a truer indication of the Tribe's
worth was their overall 24-11 rec
ord.
Coach Dutch Fehring, just back
from Japan, has only seen his
team work out once, but expects
the nucleus to include first base
man Bob Hollman, outfielder Bob
Cox, second baseman George
Thacher and pitcher Dick Kovace
vitch.
FEHRING EXPECTS his hat
ting order to include Ken Dcße
voise, third base, Cox in center
field, Gary Smith at short. Holl
man at first, Jim Hibbs behind
the phite, Thacher at second, Lon
Raymond in right field and Cliff
Harris in left. Starting on the
hill will be kovacevitch with Dick
Conway and Dave Dickson slated
for relief chores.
Kovacevitch last season worked
47 1 :t innings, giving up only 27
hits to 187 batters on his way to
a 6 and 0 won-lost record, best on
the Card staff, and a fine 1.33
ERA. Not a bad hitter either, Dick
batted ,269 last spring.
