# LSD—One Step Beyond
## 
### NORMAN GREENBURG 
The drugs mescaline, psi
locybin, LSD-25, and even a
eertain typo of morning: glory
seed affect the. human body
in an incredible way. I' pnii
taking the drugs, one's sen
sible world is transformed.
Visions arise and music
seems to swell with an inner
essen c e . Life's "texture"
seems manifest. One feels
exhilaration, a euphoric bliss,
or a dreadful despairing de
pression. And all the while
consciousness s e e 111 s filled
with an "awe and under
standing of eternity."
The drugs are called the
hallucinogens (meaning hal
lucination • producing), the
psyehedelics (meaning mind
manifesting), or tlie psycho
metrics (meaning divination
inducing), and each term in
troduces a different bias or
emphasis.
The controversy which has
attended the upsurge of in
terest in the drugs turns
upon the meaning of their
effects. Academia is wary
and skeptical of the uncritic
al enthusiasm attached to
them; the cult, on the other
hand, is brash and ecstatic,
of Ie 11 t i 111 e s irresponsible.
Richard Alpert and Timothy
Neary, leaders of the cult and
meandering ex - professors,
claim that the drugs produce
a "mystic insight powerful
enough to be the solution to
the emotional problems of
western man."
DR. JAMES A. PAULSEN
of the Health Service believes
egocentric a w a r e 11 e s s is
heightened by the drugs so
that concern with self —the
internal environment — be
comes entire. Thus, Dr. Paul
sen asserts, the "self relates
abnormally to the environ
ment," and tile emotional life
is extremely magnified. The
experience itself is affected
by the predilections and ex
pectations of the subject, as
is the recall of the experi
ence. "So intense is the pre

occupation with self," he
says, "that the world is ig
nored. One be c o 111 e s the
world." He adds that no evi
dence supports the conten
tion that artistic creativity is
heightened or unleashed by
the drugs.
The drug cult has arisen in
the universities. And if tin*
drug" effects cannot be en
tirely understood, the psy
chologists are quick to dem
onstrate that the enthusiasm
of its advocates can be. Dan
iel X. Freedman, Director of
the Psychophar 111 a colony
Laboratory of the Vale Med
ical School is quoted by the
Yale Daily News: "the stu
dents probably took the drugs
in order to escape themselves
and find a better personal
ity."
Freedman adds that young
adults tend to orbit off into
fraternities, private cliques,
or secret services in order to
share a quality which makes
them special.

ences are ultimately valuable.

Aldous Huxley writes as fol
lows in his novel. Island: "It
was the same, of course, as
the Fourth Brandenburg Con
certo he had listened to so
often in the past—the same
and yet completely different.
. . . This Allegro . . . was
the knowledgeless 11 11 d e r -
standing of everything - appre
hended through a particular
piece of knowledge. . . . Un
owned, the Fourth Branden
burg had an in tensity of
beauty, a depth of intrinsic
meaning, incomparably great
er than anything he had ever
found in the same music
when it was his private prop
erty."
Huxley's thesis is that,
western man has set up a
tension between the self and
environment; the island Uto
pia lias dissolved such ten
sion, the drugs being o 11 e

niethod of gaining this end,
and therefore a veritable
peace on earth is secured.
The fundamental antithesis
of the respective hypotheses
of Huxley and Dr. I'aulsen is
evident.
Sherry Fludy, a student at
Florence Moore Hall, found
—upon swallowing morning
glory seeds — an experience
"overwhelming all d pr o -
found." Music buoyed her
and her senses seemed to
flow into one another; when
given a mint leaf to smell,
she seemed also in somo way
to see the smell, to taste it,
and to hear it.

icals similar in structure to

by the indoles of the brain.
Some think the chemical is
responsible for mystical ex
periences among men. Reli
gious sects in India, Mexico,
and elsewhere use the drugs
in their religious rites. While
the cult thinks that the drugs
function Identically as the
naturally produced chemicals,
the scientists are hesitant to
conclude them so nearly
identical, hesitant even to liy
i«othesizc the functions of
the chemicals produced with
in the brain.
Finally, a 11 <1 importantly,
the drugs are dangerous. The
emotionally unstable and
pre-psychotic can be pushed
into insanity. The individual
under the effects of the drugs
will act irresponsibly, the ex
perience be c o 111 i 11 g every
thing. For instance, one sub
ject, noted in the Reporters'
Magazine, "felt that he was
six inches tall and was help
less for two days following
the taking o ft he drug." An
other subject jumped from
a window just in order to
feel the exhilcration of the
fall.
The drugs are not legiti

using the drugs in examina
