## Wedin Fails To Explain Secretariat 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
One item on last Thursday's
LASSU agenda was "President's
Report Vernon E. Wedin." And
true to the adgenda, one Vernon
E. Wedin, President of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford Uni
versity did report, mainly on a
new Civil Rights Secretariat he
had just set up, and then he
moved that the Legislature toss
in $300 to fjel the Secretariat go
ing.
The Legislature kicked the idea
around for a few minutes, long
enough to realize that Wedin was
asking for an awful lot. and then

decide to table
the proposal for
a c o uple of
weeks in order
to think about
it.
One reason that
LASSU t a ble d
Wed in's request
money was sim-

ply that Wedin was remarkably
inept in explaining what his Sec-1
retariat was, and what it was go- j
ing to do. The President seemed j
confident that his handout ex
plained the situation perfectly, so I
his "report" consisted of reading!
what he wrote. But much to We
din's dismay, what he wrote and
what he read weren't clear.
And immediately thereafter,
Wcdin's one man opposition, a
certain Boh Curry rose before a
befuddled LASSU and gave hi si
reasons for opposing the Secreta
riat. "It's partisan," he said, and
then elaborated. "It's not student
controlled," he said, and elabo
rated on that, too. LASSU listened
and became more befuddled.
In the last few days, Wedin has
succeeded in dealing away most
of the fog that surrounds the Sec
retariat, and it is only unfortunate
that he hadn't succeeded in this
before the Legislature met on
Thursday, for the Secretariat once
clearly explained is innocent on
all counts.

WEDIN TOIJ) the Legislature
on Thursday that "the Stanford
Civil Rights Secretariat will
serve as a clearing house to stimu
late student interest in summer
work projects in the South. . . .
The main project for the summer
will be in Mississippi."
But by Saturday the Secretariat
was "to serve as an information
center" to students who are in
terested in civil rights. The
change is a small one, but to
LASSU members, who spend
many a sleepless night worrying
about "taking stands on partisan
issues," it is indeed a pleasant one.
"Information centers do not take
stands; they only provide infor
mation," the Secretariat can now
state slyly.
Wedin still has to worry about
one little thing. Ed Shaw, the
watchdog of the treasury, has
been reading the constitution, and
has reported to LASSU that it
can only spend money on things
that are for the "general welfare"
of the student body.
★ ★ *
"GEN KRAI, WELFARE" is
quite a nebulous term. LASSU,
for example, can spend money to
send debaters to Chicago, and
pom pon girls to Los Angeles.
But, to be sure .there is a gneat
difference providing money to
itinerant pom-pon girls, and pro
viding money to a group of civil
rights partisans to pass out in
formation on their favorite hobby. I
What Shaw asked LASSU on i
Thursday was simply this: "Is the
general welfare of the student
body promoted by the dissemina
tion of information on a partisan
issue?"
To carry this point farther,
would this not leave ASSU open
to demands of financial support I
from other partisan groups with
the urge to inform? That is the
problem facing LASSU at its next
meeting, and the decision it makes
will go a long way toward shap
ing the kind of student govern
ment we shall have at Stanford.
The responsibilities of an effec
tive student government should be
broad, broad enough to include
providing information on a sub
ject where there is wide enough
student demand and need as in!
this case. Should LASSU fail to|
provide money for the Civil j
Rights Secretariat, it will be fail-'
ing in this responsibility, failing I
to satisfy the needs of the stu-j
ilents that ii claims In represent.!

One item on last Thursday's
LASSU agenda was "President's
Report Vernon E. Wedin." And
true to the adgenda, one Vernon
E. Wedin, President of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford Uni
versity did report, mainly on a
new Civil Rights Secretariat he
had just set up, and then he
moved that the Legislature toss
in $300 to fjel the Secretariat go
ing.
The Legislature kicked the idea
around for a few minutes, long
enough to realize that Wedin was
asking for an awful lot. and then

decide to table
the proposal for
a c o uple of
weeks in order
to think about
it.
One reason that
LASSU t a ble d
Wed in's request
money was sim-

ply that Wedin was remarkably
inept in explaining what his Sec-1
retariat was, and what it was go- j
ing to do. The President seemed j
confident that his handout ex
plained the situation perfectly, so I
his "report" consisted of reading!
what he wrote. But much to We
din's dismay, what he wrote and
what he read weren't clear.
And immediately thereafter,
Wcdin's one man opposition, a
certain Boh Curry rose before a
befuddled LASSU and gave hi si
reasons for opposing the Secreta
riat. "It's partisan," he said, and
then elaborated. "It's not student
controlled," he said, and elabo
rated on that, too. LASSU listened
and became more befuddled.
In the last few days, Wedin has
succeeded in dealing away most
of the fog that surrounds the Sec
retariat, and it is only unfortunate
that he hadn't succeeded in this
before the Legislature met on
Thursday, for the Secretariat once
clearly explained is innocent on
all counts.
