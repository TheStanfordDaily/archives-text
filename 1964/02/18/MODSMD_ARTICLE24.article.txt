## Cheerleaders Escape Cages To Attend Cal Basketball Game 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
We have been attending all the
Stanford home basketball games
this season. From the first game
we noticed a problem concerning
the cheerleaders there weren't
any. Last Saturday night we
found out why: they had been
kept in cages in anticipation of
our home game against Cal. It
is unfortunate that they were ever
released.
Looking across to the north
side of the gym last Saturday, we
could see a spirited Cal cheering
section, led by five energetic well
organized cheerleaders. We could
also feel them, as their cheers of
"Beat Stanford" rocked the entire
Pavilion.
On the home side, many of us
were yearning for someone 1o
lead us in retaliation. Well into
the first half, our "saviors" ar
rived. Clothed almost like men of
the jungle, their actions were
more authentic than their dress.
Our students attempted to cooper
ate with them, trying to make the
best of a bad thing. However, the
cheerleaders' actions were so tra
gically incoherent that all we
could do was laugh. Perhaps they
would have made a good comedy
act, hut their function was to lead
us in support of the team. Not
not only were they incapable of
leading a cheer, but they made
the simple task of clapping in uni
son appear impossible.
The Stanford cheering section
| was both repulsed and embar
rassed. When we talked to Cal
rooters after the game, we were
confronted with the question,
"Are they for real?" We hated to
admit that this offensive group
was headed by an individual
elected by the Stanford student
body.
If a cheering section has any
thing to do with the outcome of
a basketball game, it is amazing
that we did not lose by a much
greater margin. We can only hope
that when we play UCLA this
week-end. the team and the stu
dent body will not be subjected
to a similar exhibition.

Editor, The Daily:
I am writing this in order to
clear up a few quite confusing and
obviously mis-informed state
ments that Mr. Selna made in his
article on Stanford's TE VEGA.
Latimcria, the only living spe
cies of coelacanth, was first col
lected in 1938 after a 70 million
year absence from the fossil rec
ord. Mr. Selna quite rightly said
that t ho coelacanthids represent
a side branch of the evolutionary
history that produced man. But
any so-called "lower animal" is
also a side branch of this evolu
tion. More specifically and more
correctly that group to which
Latimi'i'ia belongs is closely re
lated to a group of extinct fish
that probably made that first
"step" from the sea to land. Prob
ably the most important char
arteristic that links coelacanths,
rhipidistions (the extinct "link"
already mentioned! and all land
1 vertebrates is the presence of a

tripartite limb. That is, a limb
composed (with the exception of
the hand region ) of one proximal
and two distal bones. In the front
limb of land vertebrates these
bones are termed the humerus, ra
dius and ulna.
Mr. Selna is entirely mis-in
formed when he speaks of Lati
nieria as a "small fish. . . . (thai
has two specialized fins on its
j spine which are the beginnings of
the evolution of vertebrae." The
first specimen weighed approxi
mately 170 lbs. and was 5 feet
long. As I have said. LatLmeria
has specialized fins but these
have nothing to do with the ori
gin of vertebrae. All fish have
[vertebrae and hence are included
| in the subphylum Vertebrae with
[ amphibians, reptiles, birds and
mammals. The origin of vertebrae
obviously occurred long before the
coelacanthids came along.
It is the responsibility of jour
nalism to report the facts accu
rately. Mr. Selna obviously needs
either a good course in journalism
or biology.

As did Mr. Naylor, I. too, re
cently took random samplings of
West German student opinion on
the question of disengagement to
attain reunification. My findings
indicate at the very least that Mr.
Naylor and I should be very care
ful of analyzing German opinion
on the basis of our "random sam
plings." While most students 1
spoke to felt that only with a dis
engagement from Western alli
ances would the Communists con
sent to reunification, I found few
(i.e., none) who argued that this
would be a tenable course for
West Germany to entertain at
the moment.
The Democratic Socialists
(SPD) have long since ceased ad
vocating neutralism despite their
more conciliatory stands toward
Hie East, and to my knowledge no
political party, however small, ad
vocates neutralism nationally in
West Germany. Even the intellec
tuals of the far-left wing of the
SPD often maintain only that
there was a time in the past
when disengagement might con
ceivably have brought reunifica
tion and Western alliances could
not possibly have.
Many students I met agreed
with such arguments to the ex
tent that it seems clear to them
that the eager German belief in
tin 1 1950's that Adenauer's West
ern alliances would bring reuni
fication was ill-founded and self
deceptive, but these students
recognized the extreme uncer
tainty and danger other courses
would have offered. In short, they
seem to have come a long way to
ward a realistic view of reunifica
tion, which is necessary for
formulating a constructive a n tl
workable foreign policy. If this
implies to some more flexibility
toward the Eastern bloc and more
independent West German initia
tive, it is still a far cry from neu
tralism a,nd disengagement.

Editor, The Daily:
I am writing this in order to
clear up a few quite confusing and
obviously mis-informed state
ments that Mr. Selna made in his
article on Stanford's TE VEGA.
Latimcria, the only living spe
cies of coelacanth, was first col
lected in 1938 after a 70 million
year absence from the fossil rec
ord. Mr. Selna quite rightly said
that t ho coelacanthids represent
a side branch of the evolutionary
history that produced man. But
any so-called "lower animal" is
also a side branch of this evolu
tion. More specifically and more
correctly that group to which
Latimi'i'ia belongs is closely re
lated to a group of extinct fish
that probably made that first
"step" from the sea to land. Prob
ably the most important char
arteristic that links coelacanths,
rhipidistions (the extinct "link"
already mentioned! and all land
1 vertebrates is the presence of a

tripartite limb. That is, a limb
composed (with the exception of
the hand region ) of one proximal
and two distal bones. In the front
limb of land vertebrates these
bones are termed the humerus, ra
dius and ulna.
Mr. Selna is entirely mis-in
formed when he speaks of Lati
nieria as a "small fish. . . . (thai
has two specialized fins on its
j spine which are the beginnings of
the evolution of vertebrae." The
first specimen weighed approxi
mately 170 lbs. and was 5 feet
long. As I have said. LatLmeria
has specialized fins but these
have nothing to do with the ori
gin of vertebrae. All fish have
[vertebrae and hence are included
| in the subphylum Vertebrae with
[ amphibians, reptiles, birds and
mammals. The origin of vertebrae
obviously occurred long before the
coelacanthids came along.
It is the responsibility of jour
nalism to report the facts accu
rately. Mr. Selna obviously needs
either a good course in journalism
or biology.

As did Mr. Naylor, I. too, re

West German student opinion on
the question of disengagement to
attain reunification. My findings
indicate at the very least that Mr.
Naylor and I should be very care
ful of analyzing German opinion
on the basis of our "random sam
plings." While most students 1
spoke to felt that only with a dis
engagement from Western alli
ances would the Communists con
sent to reunification, I found few
(i.e., none) who argued that this
would be a tenable course for
West Germany to entertain at
the moment.
The Democratic Socialists
(SPD) have long since ceased ad

more conciliatory stands toward

vocates neutralism nationally in
West Germany. Even the intellec

there was a time in the past
when disengagement might con

not possibly have.
Many students I met agreed
with such arguments to the ex

We have been attending all the
Stanford home basketball games
this season. From the first game
we noticed a problem concerning
the cheerleaders there weren't
any. Last Saturday night we
found out why: they had been
kept in cages in anticipation of
our home game against Cal. It
is unfortunate that they were ever
released.
Looking across to the north
side of the gym last Saturday, we
could see a spirited Cal cheering
section, led by five energetic well
organized cheerleaders. We could
also feel them, as their cheers of
"Beat Stanford" rocked the entire
Pavilion.
On the home side, many of us
were yearning for someone 1o
lead us in retaliation. Well into
the first half, our "saviors" ar
rived. Clothed almost like men of
the jungle, their actions were
more authentic than their dress.
Our students attempted to cooper
ate with them, trying to make the
best of a bad thing. However, the
cheerleaders' actions were so tra
gically incoherent that all we
could do was laugh. Perhaps they
would have made a good comedy
act, hut their function was to lead
us in support of the team. Not
not only were they incapable of
leading a cheer, but they made
the simple task of clapping in uni

As did Mr. Naylor, I. too, re

West German student opinion on
the question of disengagement to
attain reunification. My findings
indicate at the very least that Mr.
Naylor and I should be very care
ful of analyzing German opinion
on the basis of our "random sam
plings." While most students 1
spoke to felt that only with a dis
engagement from Western alli
ances would the Communists con
sent to reunification, I found few
(i.e., none) who argued that this
would be a tenable course for
West Germany to entertain at
the moment.
The Democratic Socialists
(SPD) have long since ceased ad
vocating neutralism despite their
more conciliatory stands toward
Hie East, and to my knowledge no
political party, however small, ad
vocates neutralism nationally in
West Germany. Even the intellec
tuals of the far-left wing of the
SPD often maintain only that
there was a time in the past
when disengagement might con
ceivably have brought reunifica

not possibly have.
Many students I met agreed
with such arguments to the ex

that the eager German belief in

We have been attending all the
Stanford home basketball games
this season. From the first game
we noticed a problem concerning
the cheerleaders there weren't
any. Last Saturday night we
found out why: they had been
kept in cages in anticipation of
our home game against Cal. It
is unfortunate that they were ever
released.
Looking across to the north
side of the gym last Saturday, we
could see a spirited Cal cheering
section, led by five energetic well
organized cheerleaders. We could
also feel them, as their cheers of
"Beat Stanford" rocked the entire
Pavilion.
On the home side, many of us
were yearning for someone 1o
lead us in retaliation. Well into
the first half, our "saviors" ar
rived. Clothed almost like men of
the jungle, their actions were
more authentic than their dress.
Our students attempted to cooper
ate with them, trying to make the
best of a bad thing. However, the
cheerleaders' actions were so tra
gically incoherent that all we
could do was laugh. Perhaps they
would have made a good comedy
act, hut their function was to lead
us in support of the team. Not
not only were they incapable of
leading a cheer, but they made
the simple task of clapping in uni
son appear impossible.
The Stanford cheering section
| was both repulsed and embar
rassed. When we talked to Cal
rooters after the game, we were
confronted with the question,
"Are they for real?" We hated to
admit that this offensive group
was headed by an individual
elected by the Stanford student
body.
If a cheering section has any
thing to do with the outcome of
a basketball game, it is amazing
that we did not lose by a much
greater margin. We can only hope
that when we play UCLA this
week-end. the team and the stu
dent body will not be subjected
to a similar exhibition.

I am writing this in order to
clear up a few quite confusing and
obviously mis-informed state
ments that Mr. Selna made in his
article on Stanford's TE VEGA.
Latimcria, the only living spe
cies of coelacanth, was first col
lected in 1938 after a 70 million
year absence from the fossil rec
ord. Mr. Selna quite rightly said
that t ho coelacanthids represent
a side branch of the evolutionary
history that produced man. But
any so-called "lower animal" is
also a side branch of this evolu
tion. More specifically and more
correctly that group to which
Latimi'i'ia belongs is closely re
lated to a group of extinct fish
that probably made that first
"step" from the sea to land. Prob
