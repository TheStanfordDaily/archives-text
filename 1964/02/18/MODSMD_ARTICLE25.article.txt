## Goldwater: Solutions By States 
### DARRYL R. WOLD 
President Johnson declares war
on poverty. Coexistence, as Na
tional Review said, would appar
ently bo unthinkable. Actually,
Johnson has just focused atten
tion on a condition which Ih e
federal government has been try
ing lo improve for several years,
but with little or no success.
Deficit spending over several
years has not reduced unemploy
ment. The Area Redevelopment
Administration has a heyday
classifying areas as depressed as
long as its funds last, but in the
end creates more animosity than
employment in areas that resent

being called de
press e d. The
"war" represents
a new look
rather than a
new idea; an d
probably a big
ger budget.
It raises, too.
an old question:

| should the federal government be
engaged in this activity?
But the conditions in many
j poverty-stricken areas are severe,
and many people Liberals and
I Conseravtives alike feel such
conditions cannot be ignored. Con-
I servative candidates for national
j office are accused of being heart-
I less when they don't cite figures
| showing what a large percentage
jof our population is underprivi-
I leged, and are simply dismissed as
being negative when they don't
| come up with a monster and mul
! ti-sloganed federal program to
; take care of this and most other
! problems.
I Conservatives, though, are not
ignoring the problems, but believe
j that they can and should be solved
on the local or state levels of gov
ernment. There arc few if any
problems of social welfare that
cannot be handled at the local
level, with state assistance if
needed.

THERE IS no reasons why Cali
fornia. for instance, cannot cope
with its own problems of urban
mass transportation, even with
its great daily influx of refugees
from the East; why it cannot pro
vide for its own needy, without
Federal assistance; or cope with
its own housing problems, w i t fl
out the guidance of a Federal
Housing Authority.
Rudolph A. Peterson, president
of the Bank of America, recently
advanced a plan for California
corporations themselves to take
Ihc initiative in meeting problems
of unemployment and developing
j a more diversified state economy.
Pennsylvania has shown w h a t
local areas within a state, faced
with the collapse or shutdown of
their prime industries, can do to
take the initiative and encourage
other industries to come in. South
ern states have stepped up their
advertising campaigns to urge in
dustry to move to the South, and
in some cases have set up agen
cies to assist corporations in mov
ing.

BUT V legitimate question is,
still, "Why on the state level
rather than the national?" DeToc
queville pointed out 130 years ago
the advantages of the decentral
ized governmental system of the
United States, as opposed to the
centralized system of his native
France, where everything was de
cided and varricd out by the na
tional government.
While our problems may be dif
ferent today ,the principles arc
still valid. The strength of a free
country depends on the vitality of
its individual citizens, and both its
strength and freedom are threat
ened by an omnipresent central
government.
A constant looking to the fed
eral government tends to make lo
calities dependent not on their
own resources, but on those of
the government, and tends to
make individuals reliant not on
their own abilities, but on those
of the national authority.
The more local the authority,
the bigger the voice of each indi
vidual in it.and the more respon
sive it is to varying needs and de
sires of different areas.
De Tocqueville concluded, "It
profits me but little that a vigilant
authority always protects the
tranquility of my pleasures a nd
averts all dangers from my path,
without my care or concern, if
this same authority is the abso
lute master of my liberty and my
I lilo."
