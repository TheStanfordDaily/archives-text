# Tax Credit Proposal Still Alive
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS) The con
troversial tax credit proposal for
college students, sponsored by
Sen. Abraham Ribicoff, D-Conn.,
was defeated in the Senate last
Tuesday but the issue is far from
dead.
In addition to Sen. Ribicoff's
pledge to bring the same bill up
again next year, a similar tax al
lowance will be included in th e
amendment to extend (lie Na
tional Defense Education Act
(NDEA) during the current ses
sion of the House.
According to Rep. Edith Green,
D-Ore., chairman of the House
Subcommittee on Education and
sponsor of the NDEA extension,
her new proposal would allow a
deduction from the total income
on which tax is based, thus lower
ing the income tax bracket of.the
individual. The Ribicoff amend
ment would have subtracted a de
duction from the amount of the
tax to be paid.
MRS. GREEN conceded th a t
her proposal has little chance of
passage in the House, where it
will come up for debate following
the current committee hearings
on the entire NDEA amendment.
A tax credit for college students
and their families has aroused
outspoken opposition from lead
ing education figures.
The primary objection to the
Ribicoff amendment stemmed
from the nature of the proposal
itself, as a tax relief for middle
income families. Mrs. Green call
ing it a "middle-class scholarship
bill," charged that it does nothing
to help those students who most
need help. "Low income families
do not pay enough taxes to bene
fit from this type of credit allow
ance," she said.
Francis Keppel, U.S. Commis
sioner fo Education, declared that
the question was one of priority
and the "first priority is to even
out the chances for education."
The most pressing need in the
area of federal aid to education,
"the opportunity for low-income
families to send their children to
college," is ignored by the origin
al proposed tax credit.
Mr. Keppel also pointed out
that a tax credit might have the
reverse effect of raising tuition,
thus "making higher education
even more unreachable for low
income families."
Sen. Ribicoff retorted that the
bill was not designed as a sub
stitute for any other form of aid
to higher education, but was di
rected toward the "underpriv
ileged middle class."

outspoken opposition from lead
ing education figures.
The primary objection to the
Ribicoff amendment stemmed
from the nature of the proposal
itself, as a tax relief for middle
income families. Mrs. Green call
ing it a "middle-class scholarship
bill," charged that it does nothing
to help those students who most
need help. "Low income families
do not pay enough taxes to bene
fit from this type of credit allow
ance," she said.
Francis Keppel, U.S. Commis
sioner fo Education, declared that
the question was one of priority
and the "first priority is to even
out the chances for education."
The most pressing need in the
area of federal aid to education,
"the opportunity for low-income
families to send their children to
college," is ignored by the origin
al proposed tax credit.
Mr. Keppel also pointed out
that a tax credit might have the
reverse effect of raising tuition,
thus "making higher education
even more unreachable for low
income families."
Sen. Ribicoff retorted that the
bill was not designed as a sub
stitute for any other form of aid
to higher education, but was di
rected toward the "underpriv
ileged middle class."
WASHINGTON (CPS) The con
troversial tax credit proposal for
college students, sponsored by
Sen. Abraham Ribicoff, D-Conn.,
was defeated in the Senate last
Tuesday but the issue is far from
dead.
In addition to Sen. Ribicoff's
pledge to bring the same bill up
again next year, a similar tax al
lowance will be included in th e
amendment to extend (lie Na
tional Defense Education Act
(NDEA) during the current ses
sion of the House.
According to Rep. Edith Green,
D-Ore., chairman of the House
Subcommittee on Education and
sponsor of the NDEA extension,
her new proposal would allow a
deduction from the total income
on which tax is based, thus lower
ing the income tax bracket of.the
individual. The Ribicoff amend
ment would have subtracted a de
duction from the amount of the
tax to be paid.
MRS. GREEN conceded th a t
her proposal has little chance of
passage in the House, where it
will come up for debate following
the current committee hearings
on the entire NDEA amendment.
