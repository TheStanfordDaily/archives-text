# KEIO EXCHANGE
## Stanford Moves Closer To Japan 
### STEVE LEOPOLD International Editor 
It's been a long time since December, 1941.
But many of the misconceptions, the myths about, the "yellow
peril," and above .'ill the appalling lack of communication between
the Occident and the Orient still remain as barriers between the two
continents.
In the belief that education and experience are the best correctors
for such fallacies, ten Japanese students from Keio University in
Tokyo will arrive this Friday, without a word of protest from Mr.
Hearst, for a 70-day stay in the Stanford area. Emphasis will be on
studying, living, and communicating with students during the next
two months, especially Spring Quarter.
The ten, six boys and four girls, ranging in age from 19-25, are
the first Japanese exchange students ever to study at Stanford dur
ing the regular school year. As a part of the old Keio exchange pro
gram, these students would have arrived in the summer, but this
arrangement was regarded as unsatisfactory flue to the inherent
limitation on contact with Stanford students, especially those 40
j students who had been to Japan as part of the Stanford side of the
j exchange and were not in the Bay Area for the summer.
Thus, this new program has been set up on a trial basis. Jack
: Schuler, chairman of the committee, announced. The funds have
i been allotted by the ASSU to see how this experiment will work, "to
see if this type of program will enhance communication."
To this end. the committee has set up a schedule that will, mainly
i in the Spring Quarter, bring the Japanese scholars into close con
tact with University life. Each of the boys will stay at a different
fraternity while the girls will live on the row.
Fifteen Stanford students, either past or future visitors to Keio
| University "Tthc best private school in Japan" will act as Big
I Brothers and Sisters. These students have been writing to their

"charges" and will act as guides and perform other "Big Brolherly"
functions during the next two months.
Previous to Spring Quarter, the ten will be staying with ten
Woodside families who agreed to keep the guests for the first month
of their stay. The families volunteered through (heir church, and
are not all Stanford graduates or recent visitors to Japan.
However, contact with the University will begin immediately,
Schuler said. The first main function after the initial orientation will
be an all-campus reception at Tresidder Union from 2-5 p.m. next
Wednesday.
Mark Fruin, a junior history major and this year's Kcio "scholar,"
will be in charge of the orientation program before he leaves for
Keio in the Spring for a one year stay. According to Fruin. the main
problem will not be language, since every Japanese child is required
to take six years of English and these scholars have been given still
more intensive training; rather, the big hurdle will be in "getting the
community as a whole to feel that these people are our guests. When
our students get to Japan," he continued, "over 200 people are at the
airport to greet them. We cannot do as well, but we shall try any
way."
Fruin emphasized that while they are here, the Japanese students
will eat with various living groups as many times as possible. Both
Fruin and Schuler urged that anyone interested in joining the com
mittee oi" having the exchangees down for dinner should contact
them. Fruin lives at SAE fraternity, while Schuler can be reached
at the I-Center.
Also, interested students can contact the "Big Brothers and Sis
ters" for further information. They are: Sue Baker. Sue Bettelheim.

Fruin emphasized that while they are here, the Japanese students

It's been a long time since December, 1941.
But many of the misconceptions, the myths about, the "yellow
peril," and above .'ill the appalling lack of communication between
the Occident and the Orient still remain as barriers between the two
continents.
In the belief that education and experience are the best correctors
for such fallacies, ten Japanese students from Keio University in
Tokyo will arrive this Friday, without a word of protest from Mr.
Hearst, for a 70-day stay in the Stanford area. Emphasis will be on
studying, living, and communicating with students during the next
two months, especially Spring Quarter.
The ten, six boys and four girls, ranging in age from 19-25, are
the first Japanese exchange students ever to study at Stanford dur
ing the regular school year. As a part of the old Keio exchange pro
gram, these students would have arrived in the summer, but this
arrangement was regarded as unsatisfactory flue to the inherent
limitation on contact with Stanford students, especially those 40
j students who had been to Japan as part of the Stanford side of the
j exchange and were not in the Bay Area for the summer.
Thus, this new program has been set up on a trial basis. Jack
: Schuler, chairman of the committee, announced. The funds have
i been allotted by the ASSU to see how this experiment will work, "to
see if this type of program will enhance communication."
To this end. the committee has set up a schedule that will, mainly
i in the Spring Quarter, bring the Japanese scholars into close con
tact with University life. Each of the boys will stay at a different
fraternity while the girls will live on the row.
Fifteen Stanford students, either past or future visitors to Keio
| University "Tthc best private school in Japan" will act as Big
I Brothers and Sisters. These students have been writing to their

"charges" and will act as guides and perform other "Big Brolherly"
functions during the next two months.
Previous to Spring Quarter, the ten will be staying with ten
Woodside families who agreed to keep the guests for the first month
of their stay. The families volunteered through (heir church, and
are not all Stanford graduates or recent visitors to Japan.
However, contact with the University will begin immediately,
Schuler said. The first main function after the initial orientation will
be an all-campus reception at Tresidder Union from 2-5 p.m. next
Wednesday.
Mark Fruin, a junior history major and this year's Kcio "scholar,"
will be in charge of the orientation program before he leaves for
Keio in the Spring for a one year stay. According to Fruin. the main
problem will not be language, since every Japanese child is required
to take six years of English and these scholars have been given still
more intensive training; rather, the big hurdle will be in "getting the
community as a whole to feel that these people are our guests. When
our students get to Japan," he continued, "over 200 people are at the
airport to greet them. We cannot do as well, but we shall try any
way."
