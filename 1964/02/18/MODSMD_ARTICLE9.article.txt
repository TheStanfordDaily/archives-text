# Powerlines Compromise Rejected
## Congressmen Say Locals Must Pay 
### 
Lit lie progress was made at a
meeting of interested parties in
resolving the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator dispute. California Con
gressman Arthur Younger, a n d
Craig Hosmer made it clear at the
meeting that if underground lines
are used to supply the $140 mil
lion project with power, the par
ties concerned must bear the addi
tional costs.
Local citizens in the area have
protested the use of overhead
powerlines running through
Woodside, and have asked that un
derground lines be used. How
ever, the difference in cost be
tween overhead lines, and the un
derground lines with limited capa
city, is about SI .6 million.
A proposed compromise by
Paul N. McClosky Jr., attorney
for SOS, has in effect been re
jected by the AF;C. which has
stated that it is willing to pay only
an additional $3.50,000 dollars of
which $130,000 would go toward
making changes in the project's
current power sources. McClosky
had proposed the AEC put. up
$700,000 toward an underground
line.
McClosky then proposed that an
independent appraiser be hired to
J determine the actual costs of con
i demnation along the route of the
overhead line. McClosky feels that
11 he cost of condemning land for
the overhead lines would possibly
Jbe great enough to pay a great
' part of any undergrounding costs.
; The other parties agreed to sup-i
ply information to a satisfactory
appraiser hired by SOS.
Hosmer suggested another pos
sible compromise, that overhead
1 lines be used only until advances
in underground technology reduce
the costs of such a line to a point
that makes it economically fea
sible.
Of the other parties involved
in the dispute, only Woodside and
PG&E have agreed to put up any
money.

board Pacific Gas & Electric Co. helicopter yesterday to view sites
for proposed powerlines to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
John Burton of PG&E is at right.
