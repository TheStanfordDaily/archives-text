• States Ignore Court Edict
WASHINGTON — Only two states —
Georgia and Maryland — have moved to place
themselves more in liine with the history
making "one man, one vote" edict of the Su

action applying specifically to their state sit
uations.

There were indications that a flood of law
suits would Ik 1 not long in coming. Residents
of metropolitan areas, especially burgeoning
suburbs, have long felt short-changed in the
