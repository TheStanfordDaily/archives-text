EVOL SPELLED BACKWARDS IS LOVE
They met. Ilis heart leapt. "I love you!" he cried.
"Me too, hey!" she cried.
'Toll me," he cried, "are you a girl of expensive tastes?"
"No, hey," she cried. "I am a girl of simple tastes."
"Good," he cried, "for my cruel father sends me an allowance
barely large enough to support life."
"Money does not matter to me," she cried. "My tastes are
simple; my wants are few. Just take me riding in a long, new,
yellow convertible and I am content."
"Goodbye," he cried, and ran away as fast as his little
stumpy legs would carry him, for he had no yellow convertible,
nor the money to buy one, nor the means to get the money
short of picking up his stingy father by the ankles and shak
ing him till his wallet fell out.

lie knew he must forget this girl, but lying on his pallet at
the dormitory, whimpering and moaning, he knew he could not.
At last an idea came to him: though he did not have the
money to buy a convertible, perhaps he had enough to rent one!
Hope reborn, he rushed on his little stumpy legs (curious to
tell, he was six feet tall, but all his life he suffered from little
stumpy legs) he rushed, I say, to an automobile rental company
and rented a yellow convertible for $10 down plus ten cents a
mile. Then, with many a laugh and cheer, he drove away to
pick up the girl.
"Oh, bully!" she cried when she saw the car. "This suits my
simple Wistes to a 'T.' Come, let us speed over rolling highroads
and through bosky dells."
Away they drove. All that day and night they drove and
finally, tired but happy, they parked high on a wind-swept hill.
"Marlboro?" he said.
"Yum, yum," she said.
They lit their Marlboro?. They puffed with deep content
ment. "You know," he said, "you are like a Marlboro—clean
and fresh and relaxing."
"Yes, I am clean and fresh and relaxing," she admitted.
"But, all the same, there is a big difference between Marlboros
and me, because I do not have an efficacious white Selectrate
filter."
They laughed. They kissed. Ite screamed.
"What is it, hey?" she asked, her attention aroused.
"Look at the speedometer," he said. "We have driven 200
miles, and this car costs ten a mile, and I have only
§20 left."
"But that is exactly enough," she said.
"Yes," he said, "but we still have to drive home."
"Oh," she said. They fell into a profound gloom. He started
the motor and backed out of the parking place.
"Hey, look!" she cried. "The speedometer doesn't move when
you are backing up."
1 Io looked. It was true. "Eureka!" he cried. "That solves
my problem. I will drive home in reverse. Then no more miles
will register on the speedometer and I will have enough money
to pay!"
"I think that is a smashing idea," she said, and she was right.
Because today our hero is in the county jail where food, cloth
ing, and lodging are provided free of charge, and his allowance
is piling up so fast that in two or three years he will have
enough money to take his girl riding again. @i96t M»r Rimj m »n

Marlboro Cigarettes, good as they are, should not be smoked
backwards. We, the makers of Marlboro, most earnest It/
urge yon to light only the tobacco end. Otherwise your
smoking pleasure will be substantially diminished.
