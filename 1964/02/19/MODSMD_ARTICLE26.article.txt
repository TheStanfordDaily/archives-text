# Kindergarten Rumble Complete With Mudslinging
## Editorial 
### 
The current Young Republicans-Young
Democrats debate controversy has all the dig
nity of a kindergarten rumble. But instead of
mud pies, these two campus organizations
are slinging verbal mud.
It's dirty.
And as for the prospects of debate — no
more likely now that at the beginning of the
quarter.
Blame for the failure of the groups to set
up the debate lies with both organizations.
Mr. Ronka, the YD President, apparently
made the initial proposal last quarter and w as
successfully stalled off by Miss \\ esterlund.
the YB President, until this quarter.
Both claim they are "too busy to debate.
Miss \\ esterlund, for example, is so busy that
the first thing she did upon returning to Stan
ford at I I p.m. Sunday from the YR Conven

tion in San Diego was to rifle through Daily
files, without The Daily's consent, to retrieve
a letter she had submitted just before leaving
for the convention.
Charges that the incident is only a pub
licity measure by the newly-formed YD's are
probably valid. If only part of Miss Wester
lund's statements are true, the YDs efforts to
set up the debate are not entirely above re
proach.
But it must be pointed out in their defense
that the initiative w as left entirely up to them.
Miss \Y esterlund instructed Ronka to make
arrangements with the YR debaters and "con
tact me when lyoul and they agree upon a
subject and debate format.
In an effort to move the controversy from
an arena of personal invectives to one in
which issues are being discussed, The Daily

has set up a symposium between representa
tives of the two organizations. To appear
Thursday next week in "The Forum" column,
the debate will concern the Kennedy-Johnson
foreign policy.
A recent Political Union program had the
slogan: "Nobody around here has time for
anything. You make time for those things you
want to do. We hope that in the future Miss
Westerlund and Bonka — who have said they
have no time to debate but have put great
effort into their letter writing — will prove
the\ want to debate by making time for con
structive discussion instead of the present
petty bickering.

has set up a symposium between representa
tives of the two organizations. To appear
Thursday next week in "The Forum" column,
the debate will concern the Kennedy-Johnson
foreign policy.
A recent Political Union program had the
slogan: "Nobody around here has time for
anything. You make time for those things you

effort into their letter writing — will prove
the\ want to debate by making time for con
structive discussion instead of the present
petty bickering.
