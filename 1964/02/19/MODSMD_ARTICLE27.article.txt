# Underground Line Not Worth Money
## 
### 
We sympathize with the Town of Wood
side in its efforts to save its skyline by keep
ing PG&E's powerlines underground. There
are few communities in the United States
that would quadruple their tax rates in the
name of conservation, but Woodside has
done that with scarcely a note of civic pro
test.
Hut ll nit action should not obscure one
fact: To put the 220KV powcrline to the
Stanford Linear Accelerator underground
will cost more than $2,000,000 of which
Woodside s $150,000 is but a small share.
Stanford has been asked to contribute $500,-
000 to this project.

The University does have a certain re
sponsibility to itself and to the surrounding
communities to do its share in preserving tlie
beauty of the foothills. And perhaps at times
in the past the University lias failed to exer
cise this responsibility. However, the bene
fits gained from putting SLAC's powerlines
underground must be judged in relation to
tlie costs.
The half million dollars the University is
being asked to contribute tow ard the power
line costs is money that could otherwise be
spent tor educational purposes. And for tin's
money it would get an underground power
line that is only satisfactory for seven years.
At that time, Stanford would presumably be
asked to spend more monc\ for another line.
Unfortunately, the University cannot af
ford such an expensive undertaking.
