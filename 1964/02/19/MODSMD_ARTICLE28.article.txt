## SU Students Should Act First In East Palo Alto 
### Pell Fender 
I Ik' Daily ol Mondav, Februarv 17, announced "Stanford has
been seleeled by national civil rights leaders to serve as tlle West
Coast coordinator lor college students planning to engage in a
massive Mississippi civil rights drive this summer/ Tin's means
that "apathetic" Stanford students will have the opportunity to
descend from their ivory towers and mingle in the foreign countn
called Mississippi to see how the other half lives.
But. as Doctors Dornbausch, McAfee Brown, and McDonough
pointed out in a civil rights seminar earlier this quarter, those in
tending to participate in this massive ci\il rights program must
tirsl consider exactly what good an untrained, and inexperienced
white student can do in a state where little tangible progress has
been made since the "second American resolution ' has begun.
We as students have these advantages over adults: most of us
( espeeialk at Stanford) do not have to worry about supporting
ourselves; we are virtually free from a family and a job, and num
erous other responsibilities precipitated by adulthood.

Thus we are able to go to the South with the know ledge that
our influence will have some meaning. We are also attracted to
the South as a place where injustice is being done; our desire for
romance can finally find expression.
et w hat about the injustice being done in East Palo Alto? Can
we as responsible and community minded individuals escape to
the South, w here we may be more in the way than beneficial For
three months, and disregard a situation which is just as vital for
nine months, and not be guilty of self interest?
The program planned for this summer should have a place
lor each students capabilities, with the hypothesis in mind that
most ol the students participating will enter Mississippi in this
context for the first time. As Miss Strelitz stated, COFOs plan to
emphasize voter registration, freedom schools, and community
centers, should reap considerable results. Segregation, however, is
not unique to the South. East Palo Alto could use COFO's plans,
somewhat altered, just as well.
We are actually better qualified to act in East Palo Alto than
in Mississippi. East Palo Alto is easily accessible and needs people
dedicated to an end of segregation. The fact that East Palo Alto s
problems are not as blatant, and less easily solved than those of
Mississippi is all the more reason for us as students to be concerned
with a solution. If we are to take pride in Stanford, we must be
equally ashamed that East Palo Alto is a community which is so
close, and yet so far.
So rather than waiting until this summer to abandon our ivory
towers, why don't we start now? It won't wait.
