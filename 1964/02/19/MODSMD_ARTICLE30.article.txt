## 'Three Men On A Horse' Fails To Portray Good Material 
### John Thayer 
The ultimate in intimate experimental theater is currenth on
display at the Nitery in the form of Three Men on a Uor.se. I lie
horse, fortunately for both the east and the audience, remains at
the racetrack throughout the play. The Niton is crowded enough
las it is without Inn ing thoroughbreds galloping through it. On
j the other hand, it might draw a lew more much-needed laughs;
| for laughs are noticeably lacking.
The program notes mention that the production is intended
"to evoke something of the period of the mid-thirties.' It would
have been wiser to forget about the atmosphere and concentrate
jon the important thing, i.e., the comedy. The Stanford Players
were provided with a lot of good material that the)' failed to take
j advantage of. The result is certainly not disastrous, but it is some
what disappointing.
First of all, the stage is too small. Wendell Cole lias designed
an ingenious double-level set to take care of scene changes, with
la curtain to hide the upper level when it is not in use; but as a
j result there is no room to maneuver. The actors bump into the
furniture and each other without moving an inch; and when they
I start to flail with their arms it's a wonder the walls don't collapse.
I Obviously, the play wasn't written for little theater staging, but
the least the director Herb Kennedy, could, have done was cut
the action down to size.

The director is not entirely blameless for a second flaw in the
production, although the actors themselves must share a good deal
i of the responsibility. One thing that an actor cannot do when he
' is playing so close to the audience is slip out ol character.
The racetrack crow d, Charlie, Frankie, Patsy, and Mabel, are
especially guilty of this: as soon as they close their mouths they
! cease to be characters in a play and become Stanford men dressed
in period costumes. They also often wrestle with the dialogue as
if it were their mortal enemy, instead ol calming down and de
livering it naturally. Part of this may be opening night jitters, but
i the rest is bad acting.
The glowing exception to all this, and the one who makes the
evening so enjoyable, is Thomas Collins. He plays Erwin, a child
like mouse of a man who writes greeting card verses, and w ho also
has a fool-proof method of picking the winning horse. Collins is
Erwin, in his every word and gesture; and he succeeds in communi
cating to the audience, as few of the cast really do, that I hree Men
on a Horse is a comedy, and a very funny one at that. In other
departments, the marvelous eye make-up makes no small contribu
tion to the expressiveness of Erwin and Clarence (Foster llirsch);
and the stage hands who manage the props act out their own plea
sant little playlet during the intermissions.
Three Men on a Horse is a vintage piece of Broadway whose
magic nothing can spoil; and although the present production has
its shortcomings, it is well worth seeing sometime before its clos
ing performance on Saturday evening.
