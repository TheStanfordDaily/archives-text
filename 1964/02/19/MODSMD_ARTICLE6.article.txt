# Profs Try Oral Mid-terms

### GEOFFERY CHAFFE 
Iti the "Journal of Engineering
Education" last April, Rudolph
Panholzer. then Assistant Profes
sor of electrical engineering at
Stanford, published an article ad
vocating oral examination at the
undergraduate level.
Mr. Panholzer, who now teaches
at the U.S. Navy Post-Graduate
School at Monterey, claims that
the main disadvantage of written
examinations is thai they elimi
nate personal contact between
teacher and student. Never know
ing the student himself takes
away the live element which is the
true spirit of education. "I propose
that oral examinations be used
at least in conjunction with the
traditional written evaluation sys
tem, a combination which has been
practiced at many European uni
versities for centuries." states Pan
holzer.
.VCCOKIMN<; to Mr. Panholzer,
some basic aims of written exami
nations are "to determine the
boundaries and the depth of the
students' knowledge in a certain
field, to function as an incentive

for studying and organizing ma
terial. and to supplement and re
enforce classroom teaching." If
written exams can fulfill these ba
sic aims of education, the question
of why not continue this evalua
tion arises. "Simply because oral
examinations provide additional
benefits such as personal contact
which written examinations can
never produce," answers Panhol
zer in his article.
Other advantages of orals are
thai a student must have more
competence and understanding in
his subject area, that some people
perform better when there is no
pressure, students appreciate in
dividual attention, and the fact
lhal oral examinations are cheat
proof. "Students generally like
oral exams since they learn more
and have a better chance to show
their knowledge," states Panhol
zer.
Some commonly-voiced objec
tions to orals are that they t;ike
100 much time to administer,
[Scheduling students is a problem,
and 100 great a variety of ques
j liuns must be developed. Mr. Pan

holzer demonstrates that it actu
ally takes less time to develop, ad
minister. and evaluate oral exami
nations. lie also claims that well
planned, advanced scheduling of
exam time eliminates crowding in
students. The basic line of ques
tioning can even be the same while
probing different areas of the stu
dent's knowledge.
RALPH SMITH, a member of
Stanford's engineering depart
ment, gave oral, rather than writ
ten. exams as mid-tei ms fall quar
ter. The results were that the stu*
dents liked the new approach and
unanimously requested more. Mr.
Smith found that oral examina
i ions were worthwhile since they
["provide pleasant student-faculty
[relationships, substitute a con
structive learning situation for a
[high-pressure one. and emphasize
basic understanding rather than
lability to recall formulas."
! Mr! Smith concluded by stating,
"I would like to encourage the
use of oral cxaminalions by other
members of our faculty and would
welcome an opportunity to com
uarc results and observations."
