# Evils Of Heroin
## 
### MIRIAM BETENSKY 
Drug addiction is u topic of
importance to all college stu
dents, feels Norma MaeKay, a
former drug addict and gang
leaders who now works to re
habilitate Sau Francisco
youths. Miss MaeKay will
speak of her experiences in
"The Horrors of Heroin Versus
the Power of God" at 7 p.m.
tonight in the Tresidder main
lounge.
Stanford students, particular
ly those going into the fields of

sociology, psy
chology, 1 a w,
and politics,
need a basic
understanding
of the <1 r u k
addiction prob
lem, Miss
MacKay feels.
I's y c hology
lias largely
1' a i 1 e (1 in

achieving permanent cures. Wi
nced new laws and understand
ing for the drug problem,
which lias always been con
sidered a crime, but is now
looked upon more as a sick
ness.
In addition, Miss MacKay
feels colleges are being harder
hit by drugs lately and stu
dents often do not know the
effects of the drugs they are
"playing" with . Hundreds of
college students a year contact
her for help in their drug ad
diction, she revealed, and most
of them got their start simply
through Benzedrine.
Though the general college
attitude is that belief in God
is socially unacceptable, such
faith plays a big part in the
cure of drug addiction, she
feels.
Miss MacKay is currently
working on Turk Street off
Market in San Francisco, gen
erally from (» p.m. to (» a.m.
The area is a hangout for
gangs of young people who are
involved in drugs, prostitution,
homosexuality and general
crime. 31iss MacKay works to
convert these youths, get them
out of the area, substitute new
habits of health and dress for
old, and find them jobs.

Currently Miss MacKay is
trying to establish a homo
somewhere between Palo Alto
and Sail Francisco as a transi
tion place for these troubled
youths. There she would hope
to provide medical care, new
clothes and habits, and Bibb*
studics and prayer. 1'arental
love is needed too, and Miss
MacKay hopes to expand her
program of contact (meals,
outings, etc.) with interested
families. A board will bo set
up to organize the activities.
Stanford students can help
aleviate the growing juvenile
delinquency (in which Califor
nia leads the nation), Miss
MacKay feels, simply by set
ting a good example. She cites
age 12 as the time when most
youngsters are first acquainted
with drugs and crime. Some
friendly attention and advice
from older students, instead of
indifference, could help be
wildered youths to seek a more
wholesome outlet for their
troubles.
.Miss MacKay speaks from
experience, for she began to
steal at age lb and was intro
duced to heroin at 12. From
this time she went on to gang
life and before she was IK was
classified as "highly danger
ous."
Extensive institutional treat
ment and psychotherapy did no
permanent good. Then she was
placed in a Christian boarding
school in New York where she
met a girl who would "turn
the oilier cheek."
At first this girl made Miss
MacKay furious and she fin
ally beat her up. When the girl
showed no hostility and instead
said she would pray for her,
Miss MacKay was affected
though still defiant. She vowed
that if God could take the ad
diction from her she would lie
a Christian. At this point she
felt a true release and a change
in her way of thinking which
she attributes to the power of
faith.
Since this time Miss MacKay
has been working to show
others the benefits of belief.
In her speech tonight .Miss
MacKay will speak of her life,
conversion, and present work.

ing for the drug problem,
which lias always been con
sidered a crime, but is now
looked upon more as a sick
ness.
In addition, Miss MacKay
feels colleges are being harder
hit by drugs lately and stu
dents often do not know the
effects of the drugs they are
"playing" with . Hundreds of
college students a year contact
her for help in their drug ad
diction, she revealed, and most
of them got their start simply
through Benzedrine.
Though the general college
attitude is that belief in God
is socially unacceptable, such
faith plays a big part in the
cure of drug addiction, she
feels.
Miss MacKay is currently
working on Turk Street off
Market in San Francisco, gen
erally from (» p.m. to (» a.m.
The area is a hangout for
gangs of young people who are
involved in drugs, prostitution,
homosexuality and general
crime. 31iss MacKay works to
convert these youths, get them
out of the area, substitute new
habits of health and dress for
old, and find them jobs.

Currently Miss MacKay is
trying to establish a homo
somewhere between Palo Alto
and Sail Francisco as a transi
tion place for these troubled
youths. There she would hope
to provide medical care, new
clothes and habits, and Bibb*
studics and prayer. 1'arental
love is needed too, and Miss
MacKay hopes to expand her
program of contact (meals,
outings, etc.) with interested
families. A board will bo set
up to organize the activities.
Stanford students can help
aleviate the growing juvenile
delinquency (in which Califor
nia leads the nation), Miss
MacKay feels, simply by set
ting a good example. She cites
age 12 as the time when most
youngsters are first acquainted
with drugs and crime. Some
friendly attention and advice
from older students, instead of
indifference, could help be
wildered youths to seek a more
wholesome outlet for their
troubles.
.Miss MacKay speaks from
experience, for she began to
steal at age lb and was intro
duced to heroin at 12. From
this time she went on to gang
life and before she was IK was
classified as "highly danger
ous."
Extensive institutional treat
ment and psychotherapy did no
permanent good. Then she was
placed in a Christian boarding
school in New York where she
met a girl who would "turn
the oilier cheek."
At first this girl made Miss
MacKay furious and she fin
ally beat her up. When the girl
showed no hostility and instead
said she would pray for her,
Miss MacKay was affected
though still defiant. She vowed
that if God could take the ad
diction from her she would lie
a Christian. At this point she
felt a true release and a change
in her way of thinking which
she attributes to the power of
faith.
Since this time Miss MacKay
has been working to show
others the benefits of belief.
In her speech tonight .Miss
MacKay will speak of her life,
conversion, and present work.
