# Tuesday Evening Panelists Agree On Drugs' Effects
## 
### NORM GREENBURG 
The mind-drugs are a toxin ap
pealing to those iindividuals who
are dissatisfied in our society and
find in the drugs essentially what
they look for. agreed the Tuesday
Evening Series panel members

with critical reserve and detach- j
ment.
Dr. Richard H. Blum summar-1
: ized the motivations of those who:
j take the drugs: they seek now i
states of feeling or emotion
ecstasy or excitement; they seek
different interests or life goals
aesthetic or religious; they yearn
| for reductions in feelings of stress
or dissatisfaction; they yearn fori
harmonious and spontaneous rela
' tionships with others.
Till; COXSKQUEXCKS of hik
ing Ihc drugs are ominous, lilum
j continued. Dangerous and painful
{physiological effects have
occurred. There have been eases j
of memory loss, hospitalization,:
and reduced psychological adap
tiveness in approximately two!
cases ou! of one hundred. Habit ua- j
tion, or dependency on the drugs,
may result.
Dr. Leo E. Hollister said that
effects of the flrugs deviate
widely. Among all drug users,
there are mild increases in anxiety
and perceptual distortions, hut
the psychic changes are not pre
dictable. He proceeds to draw the
irony; "What once was considered
insanity is now consider insight."
I)K. KEITH KIM.AM notes that
evaluation of the effects has
' tended to depend upon the pre
conceptions of the experimenter.
Killam concludes that, for those!
who do seem to be especially af-1
j feeted by the drugs, egocentric
awareness is heightened: "A pos
sible introvert becomes an impo-.
' sible introvert."
