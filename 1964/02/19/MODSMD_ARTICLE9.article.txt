# Secretariat Unfinanced But In Action
## Organizers Push Ahead With Plans 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
As of last night, the as yet un*
financed Stanford civil lights
Secretariat was in full operation,
distributing information to other
campuses to supplement the in
formation that it has already be
gun to supply to interested Stan
ford students.
Monday afternoon, nearly sev
enty-five students, many of them
prospective civil rights workers,
gathered in Tresidder Union at an
open meeting to hear the Secre
tariat's leaders explain the case
for, and the dangers of, student
involvement and define their or
ganization's role in this summer's
projected rights campaign in Mis
sissippi.
Their message was clear and
recurrant : "It we, as students,
don't do it, then nobody else will
bother."
Secretariat organizers 11 en e
St relit z, Carolyn Egan, and Den
nis Sweeney distributed a five
page prepared information sheet
which explained the scope of the
proposed civil rights drive in Mis
sissippi a campaign combining
massive voter registration, the es
tablishment of Freedom Schools
and Community Centers, and
united efforts from the nation's
clergy, University faculties, and
professional groups.
Both Sweeney and Miss St relit/,
stressed that massive white north
ern student participation this
summer is the absolute key to
the success of the initial civil
rights movement in Mississippi.
Sweeney, who went to Mississippi
to work in tho mock election last
quarter, maintained that the very
presence of concerned students
from the North has a positive
psychological value that trans
cends the limitations of specific
achievement in rights progress or
in education. Sweeney observed,
"Anything we can do to create
contact between the intelligent:
Northern white and the Missis
sippi Negro raises their expecta
tions immeasurably and puts a
new spark of hope into their
lives."
The initial inquiries of the Sec
retariat cis to the number of stu
dents genuinely considering work
ing in Mississippi for a three
week minimum period this sum
mer produced a positive response
totalling perhaps fifty. Miss
Strclitz emphasized that the ini
tiative for determining the num
ber and nature of rights pro
grams in Mississippi largely rests
I with the student community â€”
with the strength, speed, and ex
tent of individual student cum
! mittments.
