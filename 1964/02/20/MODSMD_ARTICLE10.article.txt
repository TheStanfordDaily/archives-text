# Trustees To Discuss SLAC Cost
## Doubts Expressed As To SU Funds 
### JAMES R. HORNE Managing Editor 
University Trustees meet today
in San Francisco to discuss the
appropriation of funds to help
meet the cost of moving under
ground the power lines of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator.
Administrators have unofficial
ly expressed doubts that the
Trustees will contribute the $500,-
000 that Robert McClosky, head
of a local citizens group opposing
the overland lines, has suggested
the University put up.
A TOTAL of $2.0 million is
needed to underground a 180
megawatt line to the Pacific Gas
and Electric accelerator, will pro
vide $1,0122,000 and the Wood
side Town Council voted unanim
ously Friday night to quadruple
the town's tax rate to raise an
additional $150,000.
"From the standpoint of the
Joint Atomic* Committee," said
Hosmer, "the amount of power is
not a divisible problem. There
simply is no valid reason to con
sider less than 300 megawatts of
power coming in here."
THE AEC, meanwhile, has
made a maximum offer of $220,-
000 toward the undergrounding
and will allocate this amount only
if the rest of the money is avail
able, if Woodsidc and San Mateo
County can legally contribute,
and if there are no further in
crease in AEC power rates as a
result of the sub-surface lines.
McClosky has proposed that
the Atomic Energy Commission
supply $700,000 and San Mateo
County put up $300,000 to provide
Ihe remaining $1.6 million.
HOWEVER, IT AS suggested
by Congressman Craig Hosmer
at a meeting with interested
parties Monday night that if the
line is underground, the Joint
Committee on Atomic Energy will
insist, on some manner of provid
ing facilities for 300 megawatts,
not just the 180 megawatts which
would probably not meet the
accelerator's needs after 1972.
The estimated cost for provid
ing a 300 megawatt underground
line is $3.6 million, a $1 million
increase over the 180 megawatt
line.
HOSMER HAS indicated that
this is only his "personal view,"
but that he has discussed it in
formally with other members of
the committee.
McClosky no w has suggested
that the government would save
"between one and two billion dol
lars" in land condemnation and
severance damages with an un
derground line and that these sav
