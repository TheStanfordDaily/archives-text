# Series Hosts Janis Concert
## 
### CORB SMITH 
Byron Janis, one of America's
best known pianists will present
a concert tomorrow at 8:15 p.m.
in Memorial Auditorium.
His program includes Beetho
ven's "Waldstein" Sonata, Chop
in's Nocturne in D Flat Major, the
Etude in F Major, and the Scher
zo in C Sharp Minor, Schumann's
"Andantino di Clara Wieck," and
the Novelette in A Major. Janis
will also perform three contempo
rary works, including Prokofieff's
"Fifteen Visions Fugitives," and
his Toccata, and Granados' "La
Maya y el Ruisenor."
JAMS MADE his Carnegie Hall
debut at the age of 2(1 in 1948.
after having worked for several
years under the guidance of the
famed pianist, Vladimir Horowitz.
In 1952 Janis made his European
debut with the Concertgebouw of
Amsterdam, and has since toured
in Europe, South America, and
the Soviet Union.
He was chosen to launch Ameri
can Festival Week at the Brus
sels World's Fair in 1958; La
Derniore Heure, the distinguished
Belgian newspaper, said then:
"There are a great number of
good pianists; there are many ex
cellent ones. But the number of
truly great ones is extremely rare.
Byron Janis is one of them."
PERHAPS Janis' most spectacu
lar triumph was on his second
Soviet Union tour in 1962 for the
U.S. State Department. He was
j invited to perform for the com
! petitors, judges, and winners of
: the Second Tehaikowsky Compel i
i tion in Moscow, and chose to play
I three major concertos in one eve
j ing: the Rachmaninoff First, the
Schumann and the Prokofieff
Third. For each he won tremen
| dous applause, and after his sev
enth curtain call, appeased the au
dience by playing an unscheduled,
unrehearsed encore, the third
movement of the Tehaikowsky
Concerto. The applause an d
cheers of the 2,000 Muscovites and
the congratulations and exclama
tion "Brilliant!" from Mme. Pro
kofieff made the evening a tri
umphant success for they o un g
American pianist
IN ADDITION to his intensive
touring schedule, Janis is a biog
rapher and researcher of material
; relating to the lives of composers,
j His frail and often wan appear
ance led some to compare him to
Chopin, but his stamina, and in
tense, brooding, highly individ
ualistic style sot him in a position
of his own in the concert world.
Tickets are still available at the
Tresidder Ticket Office.
