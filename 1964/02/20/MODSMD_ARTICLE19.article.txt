## Stanford Wrestling Team Faces Cal Bears Friday 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
j The grappling gladiators of the
Stanford wrestling team travel to
Berkeley tomorrow to engage the
Bears of Cal in hand to hand com
bat in their own pit tomorrow,
hoping to come back from a 17-11
licking handed them by the UCLA
Bruins last Saturday.
Barring recurrence of Cal's ple
bian spectator rite of throwing
coins while making unusual, dis
tinctive gestures during an excit
ing match, (an iconoclastic break
from the traditional throwing
wreaths and sticking thumbs
either up or down) the teams
seem to be evenly matched off
past records.
AGAINST A common adver
sary, UCLA, both the Indians and
the Bears procured the same num
ber of points, getting clawed by
the Bruins, 17-11 and 21-11 re
spectively.
Coach Bill Leland expects the
Bears to throw at his charges
enough balance 1o make a Wal
lenda proud, and do as much harm
as a necrophiliac coroner. But,
ruling out a schizophrenic referee
or metaphysical phenomenon, Le
land feels that the meet could go
either way.
"We have a good chance at the
123, 157, and l(i7 pound classes,
and Cal is strongest at 137, and
147 weights. As it looks now, the
1,30'5, the 137's, the 177's and the
heavyweight are even."
AFTER REVIEWING the re
sults of last week's loss to the
Bruins, Leland said he was
"pleased" with the work of some
of the grapplers and "not very
pleased" with the showing of the
rest.
ITe cited particularly among ihe
"pleased" group, Tom Alien, at
177. who put up a fine match with
the highly touted, burly, Bruin,
Gary Scrivens.
Allen wrestled him on even
terms throughout the contest, los
ing by a mere point on Scrivens'
extra minute of riding time. Also
turning in consistent perform
ances in gaining points for the In
dians were Dick Anderson at: 123
and Phil Kendall at .157.
Leland will use approximately

the same men against Cal as he
has in past meets, but with a few
changes and additions.
JERRY SMITH, who hs been
wrestling at 147 will move down
to a weighl more commensurate
with his size, at 137, in order to
make room for Carroll Bridge
water, who will be gettng a bap
tism of fire as he faces the fangs
of the great "Horak," Cal wres
tling star, in his first appearance
in the Stanford wrestling togs.
At 167 pounds, Joel Key returns
to the line-up after being out with

an injury since early in the sea
son, replacing Steve Schaum,
while also showing adimration
for Duncan "16 seconds" Ross at
the heavyweight position.
Otherwise — the team will be
about the same as it has all sea
son.
At 123, will be Dick Anderson,
al 137, Jery Smith, at 147, Car
roll Bridgewater, at 157, unde
feated hil Kendall, at 167, Joel
Kay, at 177, Tom Allen, and at
the heavy weighl either Duncan
Ross or Don Buehler.

or metaphysical phenomenon, Le
land feels that the meet could go
either way.
"We have a good chance at the
123, 157, and l(i7 pound classes,
and Cal is strongest at 137, and
147 weights. As it looks now, the
1,30'5, the 137's, the 177's and the
heavyweight are even."
AFTER REVIEWING the re
sults of last week's loss to the
Bruins, Leland said he was
"pleased" with the work of some
of the grapplers and "not very
pleased" with the showing of the
rest.
ITe cited particularly among ihe
"pleased" group, Tom Alien, at
177. who put up a fine match with
the highly touted, burly, Bruin,
Gary Scrivens.
Allen wrestled him on even
terms throughout the contest, los
ing by a mere point on Scrivens'
extra minute of riding time. Also
turning in consistent perform
ances in gaining points for the In
dians were Dick Anderson at: 123
and Phil Kendall at .157.
Leland will use approximately

the same men against Cal as he
has in past meets, but with a few
changes and additions.
JERRY SMITH, who hs been
wrestling at 147 will move down
to a weighl more commensurate
with his size, at 137, in order to
make room for Carroll Bridge
water, who will be gettng a bap
tism of fire as he faces the fangs
of the great "Horak," Cal wres
tling star, in his first appearance
in the Stanford wrestling togs.
At 167 pounds, Joel Key returns
to the line-up after being out with

an injury since early in the sea
son, replacing Steve Schaum,
while also showing adimration
for Duncan "16 seconds" Ross at
the heavyweight position.
Otherwise — the team will be
about the same as it has all sea
son.
At 123, will be Dick Anderson,
al 137, Jery Smith, at 147, Car
roll Bridgewater, at 157, unde
feated hil Kendall, at 167, Joel
Kay, at 177, Tom Allen, and at
the heavy weighl either Duncan
Ross or Don Buehler.
j The grappling gladiators of the
Stanford wrestling team travel to
Berkeley tomorrow to engage the
Bears of Cal in hand to hand com
bat in their own pit tomorrow,
hoping to come back from a 17-11
licking handed them by the UCLA
Bruins last Saturday.
Barring recurrence of Cal's ple
bian spectator rite of throwing
coins while making unusual, dis
tinctive gestures during an excit
ing match, (an iconoclastic break
from the traditional throwing
wreaths and sticking thumbs
either up or down) the teams
seem to be evenly matched off
past records.
AGAINST A common adver
sary, UCLA, both the Indians and
the Bears procured the same num
ber of points, getting clawed by
the Bruins, 17-11 and 21-11 re
spectively.
Coach Bill Leland expects the
Bears to throw at his charges
enough balance 1o make a Wal
lenda proud, and do as much harm
as a necrophiliac coroner. But,
ruling out a schizophrenic referee
or metaphysical phenomenon, Le
land feels that the meet could go
either way.
