# Frosh Team Plays Pair
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The Stanford Frosh basketball
team, fresh off of two weekend
victories, will be looking for wins
number 6 and 7 Friday and Sat
urday nights.
Friday night they will travel
to San Jose State to get their
second crack at the Spartan fresh
men. Earlier in the year San Jose
came from behind in the last few
minutes to edge Stanford 39-36.
SAN JOSE won by virtue of
its board strength. Led by last
season's all-everything in north
ern California track, Tom Smilh,
th e Spartans grabbed almost
every crucial rebound.
Saturday night, in a prelimi
nary to the Stanford-UCLA con
test, the Frosh will tangle with
! Fresno City College. This year
: Fresno has consistently ranked
! among the top three in California
| small college â€¢ basketball circles
i and has suffered only one loss
overall.
Fresno is a tall team and is
led by 6'S 1 a" center Long Lonney
Huey. Huey has been averaging
' over 23 points a game and because
| of his height advantage he does a
1 fair job on the boards. Backing
j up Huey, Fresno has two tall for-
I wards. One fonvard is 6'7" while
the other is 6'6".
THIS WILL BE nothing new
j though, as Stanford has given
i away at least three inches per
man height advantage in the last
| three games, all of which it has
won.
