# KEEP YOUR EYES ON ISRAEL

### 
Anyone who doubts that the Bible is the inerrant Word of God
would do well to consider the Biblieal record concerning God's chosen
nation, Israel. These unique people have survived as a district group
for 4000 years despite persecution, dispersion, and the loss of their
homeland. Their history reads like the Arabian Nights and is without
parallel. Though oppressed and carried captive into other nations, they
have, like the fabled Phoenix, risen from the ashes of their dispersion
to reappear again and again in the annuals of history. Assyria has per
ished, Babylon is in ruin, Egypt has deteriorated from her former
splendor, the Roman Empire has tottered and fallen, but today the Jews
are back in their homeland in direct fulfillment of Old Testament
prophecy. In fact, the nation Israel was born in a single day on May
15, 1948, fulfilling prophecy explicitly (See Isaiah 66:8, leremiah
31:6).
The persecution and dispersion of the Jews the centuries, according
to Scripture, is a result of their continuing disobedience and turning
away from God who has dealt so closely and personally with them. For
example, in Moses' time, while the great leader was up on Mt. Sinai
receiving the Ten Commandments, the Israelites turned their back on
God and built an idol of Gold. As a result, God punished His people and
thousands perished (Exodus 32). The Bible also states that the Babylo
nian captivity was the direct result of disobedience to God (read
Ezekicl, Chapters 12 to 24).
Although the Jews have repeatedly turned from God, a remnant
has always remained faithful (Ezekicl 6:8). God has not abandoned
them, and will still fnllill all the promises He has made to His people.
"I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am
an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin. God hath
not cast away his people which he foreknew." (Rom. 11:1, 2).
During the present age God is dealing with another chosen people,
His church (Greek: Eeclesia meaning "called out"). God's universal
church is composed of all horn-again believers, those who have accepted
Jesus Christ as Personal Saviour and are regenerated by the Holy Spirit.
During this age both Jews and Gentiles, through the Grace of God,
have been given the opportunity of reconciliation to God and eternal
life with Him through faith in Jesus Christ.
"Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that
they might be saved. For I bear them record that they have a zeal of
God, but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's
righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness,
have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. For
(Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that be
lieveth." Rom. 1:1-4.
Today many Jews are back in their homeland the nation Israel,
after almost 2000 years of dispersion. However, they have not yet
turned back as a nation to the God of their fathers, and God's greatest
promise are yet to be fulfilled. All Christians are keeping their eyes on
Israel today. They know that God ha:> a plan for the Jews, and this plan
is being fulfilled. If you are interested in what the Bible says is in

Today many Jews are back in their homeland the nation Israel,
after almost 2000 years of dispersion. However, they have not yet
turned back as a nation to the God of their fathers, and God's greatest
promise are yet to be fulfilled. All Christians are keeping their eyes on
Israel today. They know that God ha:> a plan for the Jews, and this plan
is being fulfilled. If you are interested in what the Bible says is in

Anyone who doubts that the Bible is the inerrant Word of God
would do well to consider the Biblieal record concerning God's chosen
nation, Israel. These unique people have survived as a district group
for 4000 years despite persecution, dispersion, and the loss of their
homeland. Their history reads like the Arabian Nights and is without
parallel. Though oppressed and carried captive into other nations, they
have, like the fabled Phoenix, risen from the ashes of their dispersion
to reappear again and again in the annuals of history. Assyria has per
ished, Babylon is in ruin, Egypt has deteriorated from her former
splendor, the Roman Empire has tottered and fallen, but today the Jews
are back in their homeland in direct fulfillment of Old Testament
prophecy. In fact, the nation Israel was born in a single day on May
15, 1948, fulfilling prophecy explicitly (See Isaiah 66:8, leremiah
31:6).
The persecution and dispersion of the Jews the centuries, according
to Scripture, is a result of their continuing disobedience and turning
away from God who has dealt so closely and personally with them. For
example, in Moses' time, while the great leader was up on Mt. Sinai
receiving the Ten Commandments, the Israelites turned their back on
God and built an idol of Gold. As a result, God punished His people and
thousands perished (Exodus 32). The Bible also states that the Babylo
nian captivity was the direct result of disobedience to God (read
Ezekicl, Chapters 12 to 24).
Although the Jews have repeatedly turned from God, a remnant
has always remained faithful (Ezekicl 6:8). God has not abandoned
them, and will still fnllill all the promises He has made to His people.
"I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am
an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin. God hath
not cast away his people which he foreknew." (Rom. 11:1, 2).
During the present age God is dealing with another chosen people,
His church (Greek: Eeclesia meaning "called out"). God's universal
church is composed of all horn-again believers, those who have accepted
Jesus Christ as Personal Saviour and are regenerated by the Holy Spirit.
During this age both Jews and Gentiles, through the Grace of God,
have been given the opportunity of reconciliation to God and eternal
life with Him through faith in Jesus Christ.
"Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that
they might be saved. For I bear them record that they have a zeal of
God, but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's
righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness,
have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. For
(Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that be
lieveth." Rom. 1:1-4.
