# Ruggers Face Trojans Saturday In Warmup For Rough Cal Games
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
The Stanford rugby team, which
rolls up victories as easily as a
government supported candidate
in a Russian election, again feeds
on easy-pickings Saturday when
the Southern Cal Trojans come to
Stanford.
The going will soon be rougher,
much rougher. A week after the
Trojans, the Cal squad will en
gage the Cards.
SOUTHERN CAL has lost to
the Universities Club of LA,
which Stanford cleaned up on 29-
3, and recently fell to the Golden
Bears of Cal, 23-0. Stanford Coach
Pete Kmetovie watched part of
the Cal-SC struggle and noticed
that, although the Trojan scrum
is aggressive, the backfield is
totally lacking in finesse. The
overall problem of ihe visitors is
inexperience, and Stanford should
put on a good high scoring show.

This is the last game before the
Cal fray which will be the first of
two games whose outcome will
decide the possessor of the Big
Scrum Axe for this year.
Kmetovic will be trying to iron
out all the problems that might
prove fatal next week, especially
the problem of defense. Several
weeks ago, the Indians gave up
27 points, a good bit more than
Stanford scored in any one game
last year.
BKCAUSE OF the powerful off
ense that Stanford boasts, its
ruggers tend to neglect defense
duties on occasion and Kmetovic
wants to make sure next Satur
day is not one such occasion.
Rushers Steve Van Nort, Clark
Weaver, Gordon Wad dell, and
Dick Shaw are the backbone of
the offense and will be polishing
up their running and in the proc
ess undoubtedly cause the Trojan
defense fits.
