# A 						career for exceptional men
## ...Some notes about you, about us, and the advertising business 
### 
About you* If you are the man we seek, you have an
insatiable curiosity about people and the world around you.
You're alert and responsive to new ideas, new ways of doing
things. You like to take on new problems ... you see them as
opportunities.
You dig deep into the why of things. And the best answers
you can come up with today are never good enough for you
tomorrow.
You're an individualist. Yet you thrive on team spirit.
You have conviction about freedom of choice, consistent
with the rights of others.
You're the kind of man who could be successful in business
for himself, but you see the greater challenge implicit in to
day's major enterprises.

100 years ago and has long been one of the world's largest
advertising firms. Its stock is owned by more than five hun
dred active staff members.

abroad sell thousands of products and services to hundreds of

world. Their backgrounds range far and wide. And so do their
assignments, which include writing, art, broadcasting, market
research, media buying, international business, marketing
and merchandising, accounting, music, styling, the theatre,

In our experience, superior individuals from every graduate and
undergraduate educational discipline find successful careers
in a major agency such as the Thompson Company. Staff
members in our New York Office alone represent nearly three
hundred colleges and universities here and abroad.
Your career with lis. You may be surprised to learn
that while an advertising company must have artistically cre
ative people, it depends just as much on people who are imagi
native and inventive in other ways.
Our business is selling. Communicating through the written
and spoken word is how we sell. You must possess the ability
to speak and write well so your ideas may be shared and
understood.
We are looking for the kind of men who wish and are able to
assume substantial responsibility early in their business lives.
To such men we offer a remarkable chance to grow and develop
—one seldom found in any firm.
Previous advertising experience is not required. Basically,
our interest is in the nature of a person rather than in his
specialized knowledge and abilities.
We offer you no standard starting salary, no cut-and-dried
training program. Beginning salaries are individually con
sidered and compare favorably to those of other national firms.
We help you tailor your own development program, based on
your interests, your abilities, your goals. Your program will
differ from other men's programs just as you differ from
other men.
When you join us you will work side by side with experi
enced advertising men. Your growth will be based on your own
initiative, your own development. There are no age or senior
ity requirements to limit the responsibility you can earn.
W r e encourage you to follow your curiosity into all phases of
advertising, because we want you to become a well-rounded
practitioner as rapidly as possible. Experienced advertising
men are eager to coach you individually in your efforts to
develop your capabilities. Additionally, you are free to delve
into every nook and cranny of advertising through our
annual series of professional seminars, workshops and classes.
You learn from men who are experts in their fields.
About men wlio join u§. A remarkable number of
college men who have joined us in the past decade have re
mained with us and are enjoying varied, exciting careers.
Because of our emphasis on early growth, relatively young
men commonly handle major responsibilities in many phases
of our business—both in this country and abroad.

throughout the world; and if you are interested, you may
request a transfer later on.
