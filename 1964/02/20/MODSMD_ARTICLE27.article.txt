# Cagers To Meet Uclans Saturday
## 
### TOM ELIAS 
It's thai limp again for Stan
ford's harried basketballers this
Saturday night. Johnny Wooden,
the controversial eoaeh, will shep
herd his nationally top-ranked
UCLA Bruins into the wonderful

old campus relic in an effort to I
make it 22 in a row and 1 h reel
straight over the Indians.
A UCLA victory will also
mathematically cinch the Big Six !
title the Bruins had wrapped up
so long ago.
WOODKN'K MEN, coming off
a double victory over the Univer
sity of Washington last weekend,
have already beaten Stanford
twice, by scores of 84-71 and 80-
61. The first contest took place
in the L.A. Sports Arena while the
second was played in the tiny gym
at Santa Monica City College.
Stanford was in the first con
test until midway through the sec
ond half. With about 11 minutes
remaining in Ihc half, UCLA rang
up twelve straight points in a
minute and 12 seconds to take a
75-ftl edge. It was downhill the
rest of the way for the Indians
even though they managed to I
close the gap to 13 against the;
Bruin scrubs.
The next night was a repeat of |
the previous one, only earlier.
UCLA jumped out to a quick 10
to 0 lead and Stanford was never I
in the game.
STANFOKI) will have plenty of

| revenge lo be fighting for in the |
contest, as the two game set in
j the Southland saw Tom Dose re-j
I injure his bad knee, getting
(knocked down several times in j
each game. That leg is still
! bandaged from hip to calf, and j

the other ono is too, ever since |
the series at Washington Stale.
The Indians will have plenty of
other supporters, it' I hey need
them. Johnny Wooden seems to
have made a project of making
enemies as his team travelled
around the country. Most recent
episode was at Cal two weeks ago.
Wooden stands accused of unethi
cal conduct by a coach â€” t he!
specific charge being taunting!
enemy players as they ran past!
his seat on the bench.
Wooden also is known to scream :
bloody murder at referees even I
when his team is leading by bel-l
ter than twenty points.
BUT THE INDIANS do not
have to cope with the coach so 1
much as the players. The Bruins
are paced by as fine a pair of j
guards as there is in Walt Haz
zard and CJai 1 Goodrich. At 112 or-1
ward are are pair of high jump
ing rebounders in Jack Ilirseh;
and Keith Erickson, and the cen
ter is burly 6-5 Fred Slaughter.
UCLA's vaunted press, wit hi
Slaughter at its head, did not !
bother the Tribe ihe last time the
two met, except for that brief
second half flurry the first night,
and if Stanford is to win, it must
once again move against the press
and rebound strongly.


UCLA GUARD Gciil Goodrich will be on hand in the Pavilion Sat
urday as Stanford takes on the nation s best? basketball team
