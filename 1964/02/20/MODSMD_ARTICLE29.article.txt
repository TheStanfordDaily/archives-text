## Johnson Strong, But Vulnerable On Foreign Policy 
### BILL MOORE Editor 
It's enough to make a Republican giddy.
Sitting in the White House is a Demo
cratic President whose popularity, accord
ing to the pollsters, is at least twice that
of any potential GOP rival.
Yet last December, at the height of the
political moratorium, Republican leaders
were privately eyeing the 1964 Presidential
race with a gleam very much akin to that
of a contented cat on a canary diet.
But, after all, who could blame them?
An almost unbeatable John Kennedy
had been removed from the scene. In his
place was a Southerner a victim of thai
butt of all jokes, Iho Vice Presidency

whose main claim to national prominence
previously was a wiley Senate record, a
Texas drawl and big droopy ears.
Among the large urban blocs of the
North, LBJ had little prestige. And in in
ternational affairs his most noted accom
plishment was a grand friendship he de
veloped with a camel driver in Pakistan.
So who would have guessed this same
man to have gained such enormous national
support, especially among organized labor,
minority groups and city dwellers in the
North? And three months after the assas
sination, when the wave of national sym
pathy is no longer at its crest.
The Republicans unexpectedly found
themselves up against a formidable oppo

nent who has built up a potent domestic
record by taking a strong stand on civil
rights, by declaring a "war against pov
erty" and by emphasizing the need for
government economy. An opponent who
has even started to get that onerous Con
gressional machinery moving.
The Republicans, then, have begun to
realize the disadvantages of dwelling too
much on domestic politics. That's why the
party's Presidential hopefuls have all
turned to the more politically lucrative area
of foreign affairs. And it is here that John
son - a newcomer to the field of foreign
policy is vulnerable.
As crisis after crisis arose in Panama,
Cyprus, Africa. Indonesia and Cambodia

the Republicans began to mount their new
offensive.
In Arizona last week Senator Barry
Goldwater warned that if the U.S. fails to
develop a firmer policy, "we're going to
back ourselves into a position where war
will be inevitable."
Governor Nelson Rockefeller told a Now
Hampshire audience that the Panama
crisis was "inexcusable" and asked: "If we
can't deal with our friends, then how can
we deal with our enemies?"
In Philadelphia Richard Nixon an
nounced a "new international dart game."
the object of which "is to hang a world's
map on the wall and try to hit a spot where
the United States is not being kicked

around, insulted, blackmailed or throat- S
oned." }
And Governor William Scranton said in i
Detroit: "Everywhere you look around the }
world the situation is deteriorating rather \
than getting stronger." !
By last weekend the President revealed \
his sensitivity to such criticism of tho Ad- {
ministration's foreign policy. In St. Louis »
he denounced those who "twisted argu- j
ments that would damage the good name *
of our country .. . those who distort the J
truth to alarm the people." S
The Republicans will have a tough, up- J
hill fight against Johnson. Bui it looks *
like they've already selected their main tar- J
gel: Foreign policy. s

Sitting in the White House is a Demo
cratic President whose popularity, accord
ing to the pollsters, is at least twice that
of any potential GOP rival.
Yet last December, at the height of the
political moratorium, Republican leaders
were privately eyeing the 1964 Presidential
race with a gleam very much akin to that
of a contented cat on a canary diet.
But, after all, who could blame them?
An almost unbeatable John Kennedy
had been removed from the scene. In his
place was a Southerner a victim of thai
butt of all jokes, Iho Vice Presidency

whose main claim to national prominence
previously was a wiley Senate record, a
Texas drawl and big droopy ears.
Among the large urban blocs of the
North, LBJ had little prestige. And in in
ternational affairs his most noted accom
plishment was a grand friendship he de
veloped with a camel driver in Pakistan.
So who would have guessed this same
man to have gained such enormous national
support, especially among organized labor,
minority groups and city dwellers in the
North? And three months after the assas
sination, when the wave of national sym
pathy is no longer at its crest.
The Republicans unexpectedly found
themselves up against a formidable oppo

nent who has built up a potent domestic
record by taking a strong stand on civil
rights, by declaring a "war against pov
erty" and by emphasizing the need for
government economy. An opponent who
has even started to get that onerous Con
gressional machinery moving.
The Republicans, then, have begun to
realize the disadvantages of dwelling too
much on domestic politics. That's why the
party's Presidential hopefuls have all
turned to the more politically lucrative area
of foreign affairs. And it is here that John
son - a newcomer to the field of foreign
policy is vulnerable.

In Arizona last week Senator Barry
Goldwater warned that if the U.S. fails to
develop a firmer policy, "we're going to
back ourselves into a position where war
will be inevitable."
Governor Nelson Rockefeller told a Now
Hampshire audience that the Panama
crisis was "inexcusable" and asked: "If we
can't deal with our friends, then how can
we deal with our enemies?"
