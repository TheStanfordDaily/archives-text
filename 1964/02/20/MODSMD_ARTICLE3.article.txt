## 
### 
Stanford's Indian has taken a
stand against the federal govern
ment. "Prince Lightfoot," or Har
ry I). Timm Williams as he is
■otherwise known, urged 1,000 Bay
Area Indians to vote to reject the
federal kind claims offer of $29.1
million for land taken from them
in 1853. The prince called the com
promise sum "a disgrace to our
"lonor." and compared it to the
purchase of Manhattan Island.
He and other sneakers were? up

held by a vote of 317 to 298.
The federal offer is based on the
1853 land price of 17c per acre.
The Indians would like to receive
a current rate of $1.25 per acre or
a total of $77.5 million for the 02
million acres of land taken from
them.
Walter M. Gieason. one of the
Indians' 22 lawyers in the 15 year
case, said the increase would prob
ably give each Indian on the Cali
fornia rolls about $800 in cash. He
said he believed, however, that if
the Indians did not accept the pro
posal soon, the dispute could con
tinue for five to fifteen years.
"What with meetings and picket
ing," the prince states regretfully.
"I've missed the Stanford-Cal
basketball games two nights in a
row."
