## Stair Climbing Studied: How Man Elevates Self 
### Ford Burkhart 
Tlioreau reflected on (lie subject of stair-climbing:
"11 a man constantly aspires, is lie not elevated?"
There is something noble about ascending a flight of stairs,
and climbing a little closer to Heaven.
Around the Quad, in the Union or wherever yon have a good
chance to view your friends ascending, you may apply a simple
Staircase Analysis and perhaps gain insight about the nature oi
others.
Observe the wav in which people prepare for the climb. Watch
for indications of fear, or perhaps glad anticipation at the oppor
tunity to work their way up to a loftier destination.
And while you observe, watch for basic types of climbers:
]. The Shuffler—The person who shuffles on the stairs indi
cates a lack ol energy or motivaton to climb. It could be that
what's at the top of the stairs repels the individual.
2. The Hopper—A common kind of climber is the one who's
late for a very important date. Like the Rabbit in Alice's Wonder
land, he mounts the stairs with a bounce and a hop. Ask the Hop
per where lie's headed. II he has two long ears and a fliifly tail,
you might be in for an interesting afternoon.
3. The Musical Skipper—One ol the most creative of the climb
ers is the Skipper who taps out a happy rhythm on the stairs. It
might sound like 2 1 time (clip-clop) or 3/4 time (elippity-clip
pity), or even something far out like 5/7 (elippety-clup-clup) or
7/ 11 (clippity-clop-clippity).
4. The Compulsive Scholar—You w ill have no trouble locating
the Compulsive Scholar on any Stanford steps, l£ven on a holi
day, like tomorrow, you can find one or two studying at every
step, occasionally pausing to ponder on a landing.
5. The Gazelle—Noted for a long stride and an aggressive ap
proach, the Gazelle begins to gather speed as he nears the foot
of the stairs. With exhilaration, he soars upward three steps at
a bound. Gaining energy with altitude, he takes four steps the
next time.
Classifving climbers can be a miniature sociological study to
reveal something about society, as well as about the climber.
★ ★ *
Climbers could be classified into two groups. For some the
climb seems to be a major source of excitement. 1 hey shift their
books, stare at their feet and seem to count each step with care.
Not so with the blase. They are apathetic to the pleasures of
the climb, gazing at the skv or at their friends with a sophisticated
air.
(.'limbing behavior, for example, could be an indicator of child
hood trauma, a turbulent date the evening before, or a distressing
Jecture an hour ago. Perhaps all three.
To answer Tlioreau s question: a man who aspires is elevated
indeed.
But our question arises: can a man be elevated without climb
ing?

3. The Musical Skipper—One ol the most creative of the climb
ers is the Skipper who taps out a happy rhythm on the stairs. It
might sound like 2 1 time (clip-clop) or 3/4 time (elippity-clip
pity), or even something far out like 5/7 (elippety-clup-clup) or
7/ 11 (clippity-clop-clippity).
4. The Compulsive Scholar—You w ill have no trouble locating
the Compulsive Scholar on any Stanford steps, l£ven on a holi
day, like tomorrow, you can find one or two studying at every
step, occasionally pausing to ponder on a landing.
5. The Gazelle—Noted for a long stride and an aggressive ap
proach, the Gazelle begins to gather speed as he nears the foot
of the stairs. With exhilaration, he soars upward three steps at
a bound. Gaining energy with altitude, he takes four steps the
next time.
Classifving climbers can be a miniature sociological study to
reveal something about society, as well as about the climber.

Climbers could be classified into two groups. For some the
climb seems to be a major source of excitement. 1 hey shift their
books, stare at their feet and seem to count each step with care.
Not so with the blase. They are apathetic to the pleasures of
the climb, gazing at the skv or at their friends with a sophisticated
air.
(.'limbing behavior, for example, could be an indicator of child
hood trauma, a turbulent date the evening before, or a distressing
Jecture an hour ago. Perhaps all three.
To answer Tlioreau s question: a man who aspires is elevated
indeed.
But our question arises: can a man be elevated without climb
ing?

Ford Burkhart, a graduate student in Mass Communications
research, was associate editor of the campus paper at the Univer
sity of Arizona where he majored in History and Journalism.

Tlioreau reflected on (lie subject of stair-climbing:
"11 a man constantly aspires, is lie not elevated?"
There is something noble about ascending a flight of stairs,
and climbing a little closer to Heaven.
Around the Quad, in the Union or wherever yon have a good
chance to view your friends ascending, you may apply a simple
Staircase Analysis and perhaps gain insight about the nature oi
others.
Observe the wav in which people prepare for the climb. Watch
for indications of fear, or perhaps glad anticipation at the oppor
tunity to work their way up to a loftier destination.
And while you observe, watch for basic types of climbers:
]. The Shuffler—The person who shuffles on the stairs indi
cates a lack ol energy or motivaton to climb. It could be that
what's at the top of the stairs repels the individual.
2. The Hopper—A common kind of climber is the one who's
late for a very important date. Like the Rabbit in Alice's Wonder
land, he mounts the stairs with a bounce and a hop. Ask the Hop
per where lie's headed. II he has two long ears and a fliifly tail,
you might be in for an interesting afternoon.
