# Yet Another Case Of Student Thoughtfulness
## The 						mailbox 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In response to your front page
story of the girl in the brown coal,
I would like to submit this in-
I eident to show that Moxness is
I not just an isolated example of
J the thoughtfulness and resource
fulness of the students of this
campus. For, thanks to an alert,
outgoing student in a blue .jacket
| and loafers, an embittered old
! lady, grad of 40-plus years ago.
who felt that only "coarse, unfecl
i ing. little rich kids" went to Stan-
I ford, experienced a profound
| change of attitude, not unlike that
of the grad of 10 plus years.
Returning to the campus for the
ifirst time since her class reunion
| of 1913, his anonymous alumnus
and her traveling companion were
deeply impressed with the stu
dents, who she said in a letter
were "surprisingly wo n d e r 112 u 1
people, especially one lad in a
blue jacket and loafers. He was
alert and quick-thinking."
She told how this alert student |
found her lying in the street after i
being hit by a speeding corp yard j
truck. "My hip was broken and I
I could not move." She went on to
tell how the quick-thinking stu
dent dragged her out of harm's I
way. into a ditch aside the road
and told her jokes until help
arrived. "He told me jokes until
I was blue in the face, but he
never lost his smile, or the warm
glow of kindness that flashed in
his eyes. He kept me from think
ing about my misery."
Thanks to the favorable impres
sion left with this lady, when she
received a phone call from t he,
PACE man, she made a pledge. "I
had no choice ... I just thought
jof that angel of mercy hovering
over me in the ditch, comforting
' me in a time of peril."
This anonymous letter wentj
(through the usual channels, of
course, and after much investiga
tion, the name of this fine young j
man was revealed. Who is he? He I
is Evelton Suctos. a senior in gen
eral studies.
Evelton. 31. modestly admitted
that he was the angel of mercy I
who did so much to ; r ive Stanford '

a good name. "My dad is a Capital
ist. He taught me the value of a
buck."

• Trustees and Power
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding the present hasscl
over the "Powerlines" to SLAC,
I was quite relived to find that
Stanford has taken a sincere posi
tion in this controversy. In a let
ter sent by President Sterling to
the Mayor of Woodside. Donald
Graham, on Dec. 14, 1963, Dr.
Sterling stated, in part:
"Two years ago 1 assured the
members of your Town Council
that Stanford University intended
to keep to a minimum any dis
turbance to Woodside and to other
neighboring communities which
might result from the construc
tion and ultimate operation of the
Linear Accelerator. Perhaps fur
ther assurance in this instance is
unnccesary. but I should like the
Council to know that Stanford
fully appreciates the concern of
Woodside residents over the loca
tion and appearance of the elec
trical power lines required to serv
ice the Accelerator."
It appears that "further assur
ance" now is necessary. Today,
at the Board of Trustee's meet
ing. the question of Stanford's
putting up $500,000 to help defray
the extra cost of under}; rounding
the power lines will be decided.
This decision is especially im
portant in view of the following
facts. 1) PG&E has already off
ered $1,000,000 plus of the extra
$2.6 million necessary to put the
lines underground. The town
of Wodside, pop. 4.000, has offered
$150,000. 3) San Mateo County,
which has been asked for $300,-
000, will next week decide on its
contribution, and it appears cer
tain that Stanford's action will
have considerable influence on the
Connly's decision I' The AKC's

I decision to finance the final
I $500,000 plus will depend largely
(on the action of the local groups,
land Stanford seins to be the key
I in this latter respect.
Whether the "Save Our Sky
j line" movement suceeds or not.
I the Board of Trustees should cer
; tainly live up to its obligation as
a leader in the development and
conservation of the Stanford foot
hills area.
Stanford definitely has a moral
and financial interest in this
"Powei lines" dispute. I know that
| I share the feeling of many in the
[ Stanford community when I urge
| the Board of Trustees to contrib
| utc $500,000 to this worthy cause.

• Hot Air
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to suggest, to
whoever wields power in this
area, the installation in Tresidder
restrooms of paper towel dispens
ers to augment the present exotic
blowers of hot air. The principal
advantage would be one of speed:
35 seconds represents a median
time required thoroughly to dry
one's hands by the air method;
while no more than 5 seconds
may suffice for the experienced
! paper-toweller. Any mess en-
S tailed by paper towels could be
i forestalled by the occasional re
j lief of over-burdened trash recep
| tides ia procedure the library
I janitorial staff has not seen fit
j to adopt). There is. to be sure, a
'measure of sensual gratification
obtainable from a rush of warm
air (particularly with directable
I nozzles) which far exceeds any
i comparable effect associated with
j paper towels. For those, however,
' who are not risposed toward this
variety of stimulation, or for
' those who may for one reason
jor another wish to make their
visits to the rest room as brief as
possible, the option of crisp and
[expeditious paper towels would
indeed be welcome.
