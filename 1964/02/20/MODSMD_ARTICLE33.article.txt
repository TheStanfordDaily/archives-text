# Stanford And Beyond
## Quiet, Green Campus Lacking 'Atmosphere' 
### Vivian Bozman 
The editor would like a non-political column, and the editor
would like a column on the Stanford mood. And, perhaps, indeed
"non-politics and the Stanford mood do conic together, especially
on a sunny da\ with a lour day vacation only hours away. In
fact, its even written in our own charter that at I,eland Stanford
Jr. University we never discuss anything so proiane as partisan
polities, except, of course, in vt r\ private conversations.
W hat then do we discuss at Stanford? W hat is the Stanlord
"mood"? Stanford is a very busy place, and everyone at Stanford
is a very busy person. This then is the main characteristic which
all members of the Stanford "community ' have in common, and,
perhaps, the only one.
Any attempt to define the "average" Stanford student will clas
sify him (or her) an intelligent, white, upper middle class, a mem
ber of no extremist groups, and somewhat concerned (though not
really worried) about his future career in the world past Palm
Drive. But in the end the attempt at analysis proves meaningless,
for the "average" Stanford student also intensely dislikes the lable
"Average." All entering students were thoroughly saturated with
the fact that w hen one achieves the distinction of being admitted
to Stanford, he implicilty can no longer be called average.
The inability to define the average Stanford student is, in a
curious way, a potential strength and asset iu any attempt to create
a university which has a mood or atmosphere more stimulating and
creative than "upper middle class," or "the place for those who
had the money and brains, but didn't quite make it into the eastern
schools." These two stereotypes form the image which a fair per
centage of Berkeley's student body holds of Stanford.

In reality, the very lack of a cohesive definition of the Stanford
student makes this an unfair image. Like Berkeley, though in far
smaller numbers, Stanford, too, has its peacenicks, folknicks, and
bcatnieks. The girl with blond pageboy, pleated skirt, and con
stant smile sits in Tresidder not really very far from the boy with
bearded face, bare feet, iuid constant frown. The human scen
ery at least is colorful, and, sometimes, there is even verbal com
munication between the various "Types" of products produced
by Stanford University. For, at the risk ol blatantly labeling the
Stanford student, the majority ol the student body display the
characteristic of an alert curiosity — which implies the ability to
become interested, il an attempt is made to stimulate interest.
There has been little response to the proposal that Stanford
create a miniature Hyde Park for the lree and public expression ol
public opinion. Wo would hope that more students will consider
and support the idea — if only to create a spark of life in a quiet,
green campus where the word "atmosphere doesn I really apply.
