# 'Equality Is Main Goal'
## Senator Stresses Pragmatic Politics 
### steve LEOPOLD International Editor 
"Equality is the paramount goal j
for this country," declared Dem
ocratic Senator Frank Church to j
a crowd of approximately 2501
people in Dinkelspiel yesterday, !
"and to achieve this goal we must
strive to make this country a
more perfect democracy."
Church, 39 years old and the
youngest senior Senator in that j
body today, went on to emphasize
the value of a pragmatic attempt !
to achieve his goal and others— !
as against a doctrinaire approach, j
For this reason he saw no great j
disadvantage in the fact that his j
party, in the words of Repub- \
ican Senator Jacob Javits. is held j
together by a "mutual non-agres
sion pact."
FOR Tin: SAME REASON ho
felt th a t Senator Goldwater ,
neither should nor could take over i
the Republican Party. Expressing j
his belief in the pragmatic orien- (
tat ion of the American people, he
observed that "as Goldwater's
views become better known, more i
people oppose him."
Church gave some hints as to
his "pragmatic" approach in j
answer to questions after the;
speech. "Recognition of any na-.
tion ought not to be based on an
ideological basis," ho stated in rcf- i
erence to a query on Red China. |
"The future will make us face |
up to the fact that Formosa is;
Formosa and China is China. And j
if we don't recognize this, we will i
be trapped in a sort of Alice-in- J
Wonderland policy."
TO ANOTHER question on
labor's demands for shorter hours,,
he remarked, "We ought to find
a way to link pay to an incentive
system. Business and unions
should try to relate pay to pro
ductivity while avoiding a return
to the sweatshop system."
While noting the diversity with
in his own party, Church felt that ;
the pragmatic liberal wing was
dominant and that the Democratic
party was thus committed to get
ting the country moving again.!
In a eulogistic summary of the
Kennedy years, he cited the late j
President's conc orte d effort
against "tyranny, poverty, dis-1
ease, and war itself."

his belief in the pragmatic orien- (
tat ion of the American people, he
observed that "as Goldwater's
views become better known, more i
people oppose him."
Church gave some hints as to
his "pragmatic" approach in j
answer to questions after the;
speech. "Recognition of any na-.
tion ought not to be based on an
ideological basis," ho stated in rcf- i
erence to a query on Red China. |
"The future will make us face |
up to the fact that Formosa is;
Formosa and China is China. And j
if we don't recognize this, we will i
be trapped in a sort of Alice-in- J
Wonderland policy."
TO ANOTHER question on
labor's demands for shorter hours,,
he remarked, "We ought to find
a way to link pay to an incentive
system. Business and unions
should try to relate pay to pro
ductivity while avoiding a return
to the sweatshop system."
While noting the diversity with
in his own party, Church felt that ;
the pragmatic liberal wing was
dominant and that the Democratic
party was thus committed to get
ting the country moving again.!
In a eulogistic summary of the
Kennedy years, he cited the late j
President's conc orte d effort
against "tyranny, poverty, dis-1
ease, and war itself."
