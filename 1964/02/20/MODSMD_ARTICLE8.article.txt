Richard F. O'Brien, director of
PACE the past three years, will
leave Stanford th is May to
assume the job of vice president
for planning and development at
the University of Chicago.
O'Brien's appointment was an-

nounced today
by Pr e si dent
George Wells
Beadle in Chi
cago. Beadle wel
copied O' Brier
as " a "talented
leader wit h 2
broad und e r
standing of the
role of the pri-

vate university in this country."
Having been associated with
Stanford as a student and staff
member since 1940, O'Brien has
held several positions with the
university administration. He has
been director of development

since 1959. PACE, a three-year
capital campaign, was directed by
O'Brien and topped the $109 mil
lion mark Dec. 31. Some G.OOO

the effort which set record high
for a single university capital
campaign.
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson, Stan
ford vice-president for finance,
said O'Brien "has been a devoted
and respected leader in Stanford's
growing development program.
"His associates - volunteers,
faculty and staff â€” will miss him
very much. We regret to see him
leave the University, but we're
not surprised that Chicago picked
him for this important position
of service to private higher ed-
J ucation."
