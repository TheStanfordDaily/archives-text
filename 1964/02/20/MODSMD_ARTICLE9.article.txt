# A 						Stanford Grad Who Went Left
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD International Editor 
"The character of Stanford students hasn't changed
in the last decade. It's still like Ivory Soap 99.44 per
cent pure Republican."
Or so quipped one of the "other .."Hi percent," Dem
ocratic Senator Frank Church, a graduate of the Stan
ford law school in 1950 who has spent more than hall
of the ensuing period in the United States Senate.
Church, a "boy wonder" who was elected to the
Senate in 1956 at the age of 31, is now an elderly senior
senator from Idaho at age 39 visiting his alma mater
for the first time since graduation as a guest-in-residence
at Wilbur Hall. Yet the youthfulness that led unknow
ing senators to mistake him for a page when he first
entered that body is still very much in evidence.
Tin; (|l ICK LAl'(iff and ready smile, professional
necessities of every politician, come easily and grace
fully to Church. .Rather than having to force himself
to be personable, he finds it necessary to concentrate
on appearing sufficiently senatorial.
Thus, at a news conference he will sit, slightly
hunched, with tightly clasped hands resting on the table
before him, and speak in slow, measured tones, oblivious
to the ever present whirring of television cameras and
Hie sudden bursts from flashbulbs. In private, however,
the senator gestures frequently, sometimes paces nerv
ously, and the youthfulness shows through.
It was not always thus.
While in the law school. Church discovered that he
had abdominal cancer. "Under the socialized medical
plan here," he asserted, "I was able to survive both
physically and financially." Surgery and radiation treat
ments were given and. "although the issue was in doubt
for a while." the future senator recovered and continued
his studies.
This experience, along with the 3'y years Church
spent in the army during the war, did a deal to

mature the 17 year old boy w ho had come to Stanford
from Idaho on a $4,000 American Legion scholarship
in tho fall of 1942.
While living with Ihe other freshmen at Encina Hall
"That that building is still standing is a testimony to
the durability of sandstone" Church, like most fresh
merit, found Ihe adjustment from big fish in a small
pond to "just another freshman" quite difficult". "I
made a great many mistakes, then" he reflected rue
fully.
<)%'!•; OF TIIOSK freshmen "mistakes" was defeating
the senior debate squad captain, thus presaging his later
victory in the 53rd Annual Joffre Debate.
Another mistake, of a more serious nature, was .join
ing the enlisted reserve in the winter quarter of 1942-43.
I did it."he explained, "so that 1 wouldn't have to join
the army until 1 had completed b\ freshman year." But
the best laid plans go awry, and young Church was acti
vated after only two quarters. "What's ironical about
it,"he mused, "is that a close friend of mine was one
day too young to .yet in the Reserve; so he had to enter
the Draft. Yet he didn't get inducted until that summer."
During ihe war years. Church served for 3'j years
in Army Intelligence, seeing his overseas action in Bur
ma. India, and China. Afterwards. In> returned to the
Farm in 1946 to resume his studying, "but there was
a change here, a greater seriousness in my own outlook
as well as in the outlook of incoming freshmen."
Helped by the academic credits he was able to earn
while in training at Fort Benning, Church graduated
after only one year back at Stanford. He had. in all.
completed only five quarters of study here.
YKT IN THAT one year, the young veteran made Phi
Bet i Kappa, joined Theta Xi fraternity, and led the de
bate team through a successful year of intercollegiate
com pet it ion.
One debate Church didn't win that year took place
in Hawaii. "The question was on statehood for Hawaii.
We had to take the negative because no one at the Uni
versity of Hawaii would agree to debate otherwise.

Needless to say, we lost the debate, but it was a split
decision, which, I guess, was a moral victory."
That summer. Church married and entered Harvard
Law School. But events brought him back to Stanford
again.
"My wife had a baby during the school year," Church
explained, "and we decided that our apartment in Boston
was no place to bring up a child." So the 23-year-old
graduate student returned to the Farm with his young
wife and son. "We raised thai baby in a tub in the
back yard of a small house out in Los Altos." he remem
bered, "while I continued my studies."
"Studies" for Frank Church ended in 1950 when he
received his law degree. He left for Idaho to head Hie
State Young Democratic organization and, six years
later, to be elected senator at the unusually young age
of 31.
THAT SFNATF ( AKKKK has been somewhat contro
versial. probably due to the dominant strain of liberal
ism in Church's political philosophy, a liberalism thai
surprises the "experts" by its continued survival in a
senator whose constituency contains 620,000 of the leasl
likely liberals or liberal-supporters in the country.
This philosophy is recognizable in a recent stand
Church took against a tax credit amendment to the omni
bus lax bill that would grant deductions to parents with
children in college. The senior senator voted against the
Ribicoff amendment because "it would give the greatest
benefit to those least in need; it would discriminate in
favor of the relatively well-to-do."
It is 1 his type of philosophy thai causes Ihe Senator
to joke about the conservatism at Stanford.
Yet has the University really changed since he was
here?
"No," he answered in a light vein," 1 see that students
still wear levis and Spanish architecture still dominates."
"Yel." he continued, suddenly turning serious as he
gazed across Ihe Wilbur lawn toward Branner and
Hoover Tower beyond. "1 have a 15-year-old son and 1
plan to send him here."

"That that building is still standing is a testimony to

Another mistake, of a more serious nature, was .join

I did it."he explained, "so that 1 wouldn't have to join
the army until 1 had completed b\ freshman year." But
the best laid plans go awry, and young Church was acti
vated after only two quarters. "What's ironical about
it,"he mused, "is that a close friend of mine was one
day too young to .yet in the Reserve; so he had to enter
the Draft. Yet he didn't get inducted until that summer."
During ihe war years. Church served for 3'j years
in Army Intelligence, seeing his overseas action in Bur

a change here, a greater seriousness in my own outlook
as well as in the outlook of incoming freshmen."
Helped by the academic credits he was able to earn
while in training at Fort Benning, Church graduated
after only one year back at Stanford. He had. in all.
completed only five quarters of study here.
YKT IN THAT one year, the young veteran made Phi
Bet i Kappa, joined Theta Xi fraternity, and led the de
bate team through a successful year of intercollegiate
com pet it ion.
One debate Church didn't win that year took place
in Hawaii. "The question was on statehood for Hawaii.
We had to take the negative because no one at the Uni
versity of Hawaii would agree to debate otherwise.

Needless to say, we lost the debate, but it was a split
decision, which, I guess, was a moral victory."
That summer. Church married and entered Harvard
Law School. But events brought him back to Stanford
again.
"My wife had a baby during the school year," Church
explained, "and we decided that our apartment in Boston
was no place to bring up a child." So the 23-year-old
graduate student returned to the Farm with his young
wife and son. "We raised thai baby in a tub in the
back yard of a small house out in Los Altos." he remem
bered, "while I continued my studies."
"Studies" for Frank Church ended in 1950 when he
received his law degree. He left for Idaho to head Hie
State Young Democratic organization and, six years
later, to be elected senator at the unusually young age
of 31.
THAT SFNATF ( AKKKK has been somewhat contro
versial. probably due to the dominant strain of liberal
ism in Church's political philosophy, a liberalism thai
surprises the "experts" by its continued survival in a
senator whose constituency contains 620,000 of the leasl
likely liberals or liberal-supporters in the country.
This philosophy is recognizable in a recent stand
Church took against a tax credit amendment to the omni
bus lax bill that would grant deductions to parents with
children in college. The senior senator voted against the
Ribicoff amendment because "it would give the greatest
benefit to those least in need; it would discriminate in
favor of the relatively well-to-do."
It is 1 his type of philosophy thai causes Ihe Senator
to joke about the conservatism at Stanford.

"No," he answered in a light vein," 1 see that students
still wear levis and Spanish architecture still dominates."
"Yel." he continued, suddenly turning serious as he
gazed across Ihe Wilbur lawn toward Branner and
Hoover Tower beyond. "1 have a 15-year-old son and 1
plan to send him here."
"The character of Stanford students hasn't changed
in the last decade. It's still like Ivory Soap 99.44 per
cent pure Republican."
Or so quipped one of the "other .."Hi percent," Dem
ocratic Senator Frank Church, a graduate of the Stan
ford law school in 1950 who has spent more than hall
of the ensuing period in the United States Senate.
Church, a "boy wonder" who was elected to the
Senate in 1956 at the age of 31, is now an elderly senior
senator from Idaho at age 39 visiting his alma mater
for the first time since graduation as a guest-in-residence
at Wilbur Hall. Yet the youthfulness that led unknow
ing senators to mistake him for a page when he first
entered that body is still very much in evidence.
Tin; (|l ICK LAl'(iff and ready smile, professional
necessities of every politician, come easily and grace
fully to Church. .Rather than having to force himself
to be personable, he finds it necessary to concentrate
on appearing sufficiently senatorial.
Thus, at a news conference he will sit, slightly
hunched, with tightly clasped hands resting on the table
before him, and speak in slow, measured tones, oblivious
to the ever present whirring of television cameras and
Hie sudden bursts from flashbulbs. In private, however,
the senator gestures frequently, sometimes paces nerv
ously, and the youthfulness shows through.
It was not always thus.
While in the law school. Church discovered that he
had abdominal cancer. "Under the socialized medical
plan here," he asserted, "I was able to survive both
physically and financially." Surgery and radiation treat
ments were given and. "although the issue was in doubt
for a while." the future senator recovered and continued
his studies.

com pet it ion.
One debate Church didn't win that year took place
in Hawaii. "The question was on statehood for Hawaii.
We had to take the negative because no one at the Uni
versity of Hawaii would agree to debate otherwise.

Needless to say, we lost the debate, but it was a split
decision, which, I guess, was a moral victory."
That summer. Church married and entered Harvard
Law School. But events brought him back to Stanford
again.
"My wife had a baby during the school year," Church
explained, "and we decided that our apartment in Boston
was no place to bring up a child." So the 23-year-old
graduate student returned to the Farm with his young
wife and son. "We raised thai baby in a tub in the
back yard of a small house out in Los Altos." he remem
bered, "while I continued my studies."
"Studies" for Frank Church ended in 1950 when he
received his law degree. He left for Idaho to head Hie
State Young Democratic organization and, six years
later, to be elected senator at the unusually young age
of 31.
THAT SFNATF ( AKKKK has been somewhat contro
versial. probably due to the dominant strain of liberal
ism in Church's political philosophy, a liberalism thai
surprises the "experts" by its continued survival in a
senator whose constituency contains 620,000 of the leasl
likely liberals or liberal-supporters in the country.
This philosophy is recognizable in a recent stand
Church took against a tax credit amendment to the omni
bus lax bill that would grant deductions to parents with
children in college. The senior senator voted against the
Ribicoff amendment because "it would give the greatest
benefit to those least in need; it would discriminate in
favor of the relatively well-to-do."
It is 1 his type of philosophy thai causes Ihe Senator
to joke about the conservatism at Stanford.
Yet has the University really changed since he was
here?
"No," he answered in a light vein," 1 see that students
still wear levis and Spanish architecture still dominates."
"Yel." he continued, suddenly turning serious as he
gazed across Ihe Wilbur lawn toward Branner and
Hoover Tower beyond. "1 have a 15-year-old son and 1
plan to send him here."
"The character of Stanford students hasn't changed
in the last decade. It's still like Ivory Soap 99.44 per
cent pure Republican."
Or so quipped one of the "other .."Hi percent," Dem
ocratic Senator Frank Church, a graduate of the Stan
ford law school in 1950 who has spent more than hall
of the ensuing period in the United States Senate.
Church, a "boy wonder" who was elected to the
Senate in 1956 at the age of 31, is now an elderly senior
senator from Idaho at age 39 visiting his alma mater
for the first time since graduation as a guest-in-residence
at Wilbur Hall. Yet the youthfulness that led unknow
ing senators to mistake him for a page when he first
entered that body is still very much in evidence.
Tin; (|l ICK LAl'(iff and ready smile, professional
necessities of every politician, come easily and grace
fully to Church. .Rather than having to force himself
to be personable, he finds it necessary to concentrate
on appearing sufficiently senatorial.
Thus, at a news conference he will sit, slightly
hunched, with tightly clasped hands resting on the table
before him, and speak in slow, measured tones, oblivious
to the ever present whirring of television cameras and
Hie sudden bursts from flashbulbs. In private, however,
the senator gestures frequently, sometimes paces nerv
ously, and the youthfulness shows through.
It was not always thus.
While in the law school. Church discovered that he
had abdominal cancer. "Under the socialized medical
plan here," he asserted, "I was able to survive both
physically and financially." Surgery and radiation treat
ments were given and. "although the issue was in doubt
for a while." the future senator recovered and continued
his studies.
This experience, along with the 3'y years Church
spent in the army during the war, did a deal to

mature the 17 year old boy w ho had come to Stanford
from Idaho on a $4,000 American Legion scholarship
in tho fall of 1942.
While living with Ihe other freshmen at Encina Hall
"That that building is still standing is a testimony to
the durability of sandstone" Church, like most fresh
merit, found Ihe adjustment from big fish in a small
pond to "just another freshman" quite difficult". "I
made a great many mistakes, then" he reflected rue
fully.
<)%'!•; OF TIIOSK freshmen "mistakes" was defeating
the senior debate squad captain, thus presaging his later
victory in the 53rd Annual Joffre Debate.
Another mistake, of a more serious nature, was .join
ing the enlisted reserve in the winter quarter of 1942-43.
I did it."he explained, "so that 1 wouldn't have to join
the army until 1 had completed b\ freshman year." But
the best laid plans go awry, and young Church was acti
vated after only two quarters. "What's ironical about
it,"he mused, "is that a close friend of mine was one
day too young to .yet in the Reserve; so he had to enter
the Draft. Yet he didn't get inducted until that summer."
During ihe war years. Church served for 3'j years
in Army Intelligence, seeing his overseas action in Bur
ma. India, and China. Afterwards. In> returned to the
Farm in 1946 to resume his studying, "but there was
a change here, a greater seriousness in my own outlook
as well as in the outlook of incoming freshmen."
Helped by the academic credits he was able to earn
while in training at Fort Benning, Church graduated
after only one year back at Stanford. He had. in all.
completed only five quarters of study here.
YKT IN THAT one year, the young veteran made Phi
Bet i Kappa, joined Theta Xi fraternity, and led the de
