WHEN CHRIST RETURNS
Ni> one knows when Jesus Christ will return to Eartli (Matt. 34:36), yet ;it
least one verse in ten in the .\cw Testament speaks of I lis imminent second com
ing. Prom the signs of the times anions nations and religions, it is apparent that
the moment of 11 is return is drawing near.
The return of Christ is described by the TJoly Spirit through the apocalyptic
vision of the Apostle John:
"And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse: and lie that sat upon
him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make
war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and
he had a name written, that 110 man knew but lie himself. And he was clothed
with a vesture dipped in blood; and his name is called the Word of God, And
the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in white
linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it
he should smite the nations: and lie shall rule them with a rod of iron; and he
trcadcth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he
hath on his vesture a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF
LORDS." Rev. 19:11-16.
The lliblical record of conditions in the time which will exist preceding the
visible return (parousia) of Jesus Christ reads like a commentary 011 our twentieth
century world. No serious student of the Miblc can ignore the ominous signs
described in Matthew 24, Mark I.?, and Luke 21. These signs, Jesus said, wire
the beginning of sorrows. Ahead is a time of great disaster, known in Scripture
as the great tribulation which will end only by Christ'.- coming.
When Christ returns, it will be to establish His long-awaited kindom 011
earth. Jerusalem will be the capital city. The Jews will, en masse, recognize
Christ as Messiah and King. The saints (believers) of all ages will rule with
Christ in justice and peace. The Jews in their homeland will enjoy the fulfillment
of tile promise made long ago to Abraham and David -that Israel's King, the
Messiah, will rule the entire world.
Those of us who know Jesus Christ a.-- Lord and Saviour are prepared for
His return.
"lint as the days of Noah were. >0 shall also the coming of the Son of man
be. For as in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage, until the daj that Noah entered into the ark.
And knew not until the flood came and took them all away: so shall also the
coming of the Son of man be. Then shall two lie in the field; the one shall be
taken and the other left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall
be taken and tin- other left. Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your
Lord doth come." Math. 24:37-42.
If you are on the side of Jesus ("hrisl, you have nothing to fear. However, a
neutral position 011 the fence is not good enough: "lie that is not with me is
against me: and he that gathered not with me. seattercth abroad. Matt. 12:30.
Life with Jesus Christ is greater than word can describe. He is real and I Its
promises never fail. Volt have but one life to give, why not give it to Jesn>
Christ today? What could possibly be more exciting than to be on I lis side the
day He returns? What could be more terrible than to be lost? Our prayer is that
you will be 011 His side. "... with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed
from heaven with his mightly angels, in flaming lire taking vengeance 011 them
that know not God. and that obey not the gospel of our Ljrd Jesus Christ: Who
shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord,
and from the glory of his power." II Tliess. 1:7-9.
