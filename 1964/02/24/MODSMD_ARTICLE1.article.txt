• Turks Threat on Invasion
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Cyprus is like a vast
armed camp. In every town, village and ham
let thousands of young men, in some cases
even women, are receiving weapons training.
This feverish activity can be observed on
both Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides.
The Greek Cypriots, who outnumber the
Turkish Cypriots 4-1, said they were prepar
ing to repel a threatened invasion from th <>
Turkish mainland, 40 miles from the island's
north coast.
Turkish Cypriots, isolated in scores of vil
lages scattered all over the island and in the
Turkish sectors of the island's six main towns,
claim they were preparing to repel a threat
ened Greek attack.
Since the fighting between the two island
communities broke out at Christmas, two di
stinct defense forces have sprung up on the
island—one Greek, one Turkish.

• Pakistan To Aid Peking
LAHORE, Pakistan — Pakistan, a U.S.
military ally, yesterday pledged 'friendly co
operation" with Communist China and an
nounced President Mohammed Ayub Khan
will visit Peking.
The announcement came in a joint com
munique issued after three days of private
talks between Ayub and visiting Red Chinese
Premier Chou En-lai in Rawalpindi.
Pakistan's stand served notice on Washing
ton that this nation of 100 million at the top
of the Indian subcontinent no longer consid
ers the U.S.-backed CENTO and SEATO mili
tary alliances the center of its foreign policy
and that Pakistan is now charting an indepen
dent course that will take it closer to Peking.
