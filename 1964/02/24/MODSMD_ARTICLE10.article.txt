Illustrated below is the membership pin of a brand-new na
tional fraternity called Signa Phi Nothing. To join Signa Phi
Nothing and get this hideous membership pin absolutely free,
simply take a pair of scissors, cut out the illustration, and paste
it on your chest.
Let me hasten to state that I do not recommend your joining
Signa Phi Nothing. The only thing I recommend in this column
is Marlboro Cigarettes, as any honest man would who likes
good tobacco and a good filter, whose heart is quickened by a
choice of soft pack or Flip-Top Box, and who gets paid every
week for writing this column.
I am frankly hard put to think of any reason why you should
join Signa Phi Nothing. Some people, of course, are joiners by
nature; if you are one such, I am bound to tell you there are
any number of better organizations for you to join—the Cosa
Nostra, for example, or the Society for the Placing of Water
Troughs in Front of Equestrian Statues.

But if you insist on joining Signa Phi Nothing, let me give
you several warnings. First off, it is the only fraternity which
admits girls. Second, there is no pledge period; each new mem
ber immediately goes active. Perhaps "inactive" is a more ac
curate word: there are no meetings, no drives, no campaigns,
no sports, no games, no dues, no grip, and no house.
The only thing Signa Phi Nothing has in common with other
fraternities is a fraternity hymn. In fact, two hymns were sub
mitted to a recent meeting of the national board of directors
(none of whom attended). The first hymn goes:
Signa Phi Nothing,
Shining star,
llow we wonder
If you are.
The second hymn, rather more poetic in content, is to be
sung to the tune of Also Sprach Zarathustra:
A Guernsey's a cow,
A road is a lane,
When you're eating chow,
Remember the mein.
Pending the next meeting of the national board o! Uik ctor,-
(which will never be held) members are authorized to sin'
either hymn. Or, for that matter, Frenesi.
Perhaps you are wondering why there should I i *h ■>
ternity as Signa Phi Nothing. I can give you an au-\>.i >
answer with which you cannot possibly disagree: Signa Ph
Nothing fills a well-needed gap.
Are you suffering from mental health? Is It ,u •
your thinking? Is ambition encroaching on your native sloth
Is your long-cherished misinformation retreating before a s>
of facts? In short, has education caught up with you?
If so, congratulations. But spring is upon us and the sap is
rising, and the mind looks back with poignant longing to the
days when it w;is a puddle of unreason.
If—just for a moment—you want to recapture those cai
less vaporings, that warm, squishy confusion, then join Si n
Phi Nothing and renew your acquaintance with feckle : n
We promise nothing, and, by George, we deliver it'
