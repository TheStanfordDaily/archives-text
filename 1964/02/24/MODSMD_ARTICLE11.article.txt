# Liberal Brings Controversy To 'Merry' Minnesota
## 
### DAVID BARNUM 
A whole series of events has
followed in the wake of Mulford
Q. Sibley's ill-fated letter to the
Minnesota Daily last December.
Some are humorous, some decid
edly not.
In a debate in January, Sibley
defended the contents of his let
ter, in which he had used the
example of clubs advocating com
munism, nudism, and atheism to
make his point that freedom of
academic expression was essen
tial in any university.
STUDENTS, not satisfied with
expressing approval of Sibley's
general stand in favor of the ut
most diversity of ideas on cam
pus, promptly took up one of his
particular suggestions and began
wearing "Nudist Club" buttons
on their clothes, apparently un
aware of the implicit contradic
tion involved in doing so.
Their point was well taken
though. The State Senate Educa
tion Committee decided to inves
tigate the hiring policies of the
University to determine how
subversives like Sibley got teach
ing positions.
Confrontations between the
University and the Legislature
have not been infrequent. Three
years ago when the state and the
city of Minneapolis, which sur
rounds the University, went on
Daylight Savings Time, the cam
nus remained on Standard Time.
The University is dependent for
<ts funds on the legislature, which
is controlled by rural interests
as legislatures are apt to be in
this country.

THE FARMERS, not wishing
to rise at an even earlier hour
than usual, had unsuccessfully
opposed the switch to Daylight

Savings, and tho University de
cided to give them moral support
by keeping its clocks an hour be
hind those throughout tho rest of
the state and city.
Lot us hope that Stanford,-even
if it is a farm, will never have
to undertake such similar civil
disobedience.
Few besides the investigating
committee itself are very enthu
siastic about the impending study
of University policies. The Gov
ernor and Attorney General of
Minnesota have both expressed
mild disapproval.
The students consider the
whole thing unnecessary and
amusing. "Why bother to inves
tigate?" was a representative re
action. One Nudist Club member,
however, felt a probe was long
overdue. "As far as I'm con
cerned," he said, "the University
could bare some investigating."
MORE CONCERNED students
have organized a "Truth Squad"
to deliver speeches throughout
the state in an effort to explain
University policy to Minnesota
citizens.
Another outgrowth of the cur
rent controversy is sociology pro
fessor Arnold Rose's libel suit
against two citizens who have ac
cused him of being "dangerous
to our country." Rose ran un
successfully for the Minnesota
state legislature in 1962, and was
an associate of Gunnar Myrdal
in writing the book The Amer
ican Dilemma.
Senator James O. Eastland of
Mississippi has claimed that
many of Myrdal's associates were
Communist front members, and
Rose's accusers are certain that

Rose was one of Ihom. A faculty
commit tee has solicited several
thousand dollars already to de
fray Rose's defense expenses.
And so life goes merrily on in
the Middle West of the home of
the brave and the land of the
free.
