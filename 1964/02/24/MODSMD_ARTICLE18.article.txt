# Campus Poll Shows Johnson Ahead At Stanford
## 
### BILL MOORE Editor 
If Stanford students were the
only ones balloting — and the
Presidential election were held to
day — Lyndon Johnson would
win by a healthy margin.
But his support would be less
than enthusiastic.
At least that's the finding of a
random poll taken recently of 98
Stanford students — 52 per cent
of whom said they favored John
son.
Nelson Rockefeller received the
second highest number of prefer
ences but was far behind the
President with nine per cent.
A surprisingly small number of
pollees chose Barry Goldwater

and Richard Nixon — the Repub
lican frontrunners, according to
national surveys. Goldwater was
the favorite of seven per cent of
the students queried, Nixon, a
mere one per cent.
Three per- cent hacked William
Scranton; 3 per cent, George Rom
ney; 2 per cent, Adlai Stevenson;
1 per cent, Robert Kennedy; and
1 per cent, Margaret Chase Smith.
Eighteen per cent of the respon
dents were undecided.
The poll was conducted by mem
bers of the Journalism 175 class,
who arranged their sample by se
lecting the name at the top of
each student directory page.
The class found that the pro-
Johnson respondents frequently

cited three reasons for supporting
the President:
• He has handled Congress
well.
• He will carry on Kennedy's
policies.
• He hasn't made any major
mistakes.
Linda Haines, a junior, favored
Johnson because "Goldwater is
too conservative, Nixon has no
backbone and Rockefeller is neu
tral."
Said junior Scott McCulloch;
"I would stick with Johnson.
It's not a strong preference, but
I dislike the others. His economic
policies are good. He has experi
ence in legislative matters and
can control Congress better than
Kennedy could. He's realistic. He
can compromise but can still
make decisions."
William Myers, also a graduate
student, explained that—although
he supported the President now—
he was "waiting to see who the
Republicans nominate. There's
one person who could do as good
a job as Johnson —Mr. Rockefel
ler."
The New York governor ap
pealed to junior Robert Mclntyre,
too.
"It's mainly because of the po
litical developments," he pointed
out. "Things seem to be swaying
away from Johnson now that the
moratorium is over. At first, after
Kennedy's death, there was no

criticism. But now there is — and
there seems to be a lot of validity
in the attacks. Goldwater is kind
of an ass."
Sophomore Ronald Lefler said
he also backed Goldwater — but,
after toying with his glasses for
a moment, he admitted: "I just
chose Goldwater because I want
to see what will happen. I'm ex
pecting him to be like Johnson:
all talk. He won't really be a n y
thing that different."
Sophomore John Neumeister,
another undecided, surveyed the
political horizon with more than a
slight trace of sadness in his
voice:
"I think that President Kennedy
is the best president the U.S. has
had since I can remember. I don't
see anyone coming up who can
measure up to him."
