Conference here

yesterday by Alumni Associa

capacity about the first of March.
Speaking at the conference,
Vice Provost Robert J. Wert
stated, "Revolutionary reform in
complex universities is neither
very possible nor very desirable."
".Radical reform is definately
not indicated at Stanford. Instead
there should be constant, perva
sive and relatively small-scale
testing and appraisal of many
now ideas. ... If enough ideas
have been tested, the net effect
over time will approximate the
effects of radical revolution with
out risk of invidious side effects
which revolutions can spawn."
