# UCLA Bruins Blitz Indians; Trojans Next
## 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
Tom Dose put on a groat per
formance at the Stanford Pavilion
but Walt Hazzard stole t ho show
with his brilliant playmaking Sat
urday night as the nationally lop
ranked UCLA Bruins came from
11 points back to run up 100
points and heat the Indians. 100-88.
It was Ihc first time in me
mory that any team has hit the
century mark against Stanford
anywhere, lot alone in the friendly
confines of the Pavilion.
l)()Si: BANGUI) in 38 points to
come within two of Ron Tomsic's
Pavilion scoring mark as the In
dians gave unbeaten UCLA its
biggest scare of the season.
It took a repeat of last month's
lightning-like blitz at LA's Sports
Arena to overtake and beat the
Tribe. Stanford had .jumped off to
an early lead right at the start,
and stretched it to 36-25 with 7:30
remaining in the first half on a
Dose three point play.
UCLA fought right back, clos
ing the gap lo six on Hazzard and
Gail Goodrich buckets and a Haz
zard free throw. Stanford re
fused to crack at this point,
though, and held on for a live
point 42*37 margin.
TIIK FIRST HALF saw Haz
zard put on one of the finest
clutch performances of this or
any other season. Time and again,
the great All-American either
found the b u c k e t or spotted a
teammate open for an easy shot.
His pinpoint passing and shoot
ing were responsible for 20 of
UCLA's 37 first half points via
either the scoring or assist route.

Had Hazzard not risen to the occa
sion, Stanford could have held
such a commanding halftime edge
tiiat the Bruins could never have
caught them. But Hazzard was
Ihere.
Within easy reach at the inter

mission, Stanford still refused to
crack until the second half was
almost 8 minutes old. The key to
the Indian collapse was ihe loss
of high-jumping forward Clayton
Raaka on fouls.
RAAKA WENT out with the
Tribe still even at 53 all. He had
been the key to the Indians' crack
ing the vaunted UCLA zone press.
Even though Stanford dirl move
out to a short-lived six point edge
after losing Raaka, his loss was
felt sorely two minutes later as
the Bruin press began to take
effect.
Its effect was so great, in fact,
that in a two minute and 38 sec
ond span, the 59-53 Indian margin
was converted into a 77 to 65
UCLA lead. Time and again in
that short time, Stanford threw

the ball away.
Soph Ray Kosanke, who h a d
moved over to take Raaka's spot
was unable to handle the passes
from Hollis Moore which had en
abled Stanford to move the ball.
KOSANKE, THOUGH, was one
of the key men through the entire
game. Coming in as a substitute
for forward Bob Bedell, the 6-10
forward played as well as anyone
on the floor. Ho, Raaka and Dose,
with their big height advantage,
combined to give Ihe Indians con
trol of the backboards in the first
half, and it was this control that
was responsible for their leaving
the floor with a lead at mid-game.
Had Raaka not fouled out, Ko
sanke would have remained in his
position at left forward, where he
had been so effective, and Stan
ford might have been able to con
tinue to move the ball, thus pre
venting the sudden Bruin blitz
responsible for the Stanford de
feat.
Coach Howie Dallmar and his
team attempt to get back on the
winning track lonight when they
take on Southern Cal in Los An
geles. The Tribe and the Trojans
split a pair in the Pavilion Jan. 3

and 4, SC taking the first game in
overiime, and Stanford coming
back to win the second contest by
16.
Leading ihc Trojan attack will
be (!-() junior forward Allen
Young, averaging lt» points per
game. With 121 rebounds, Young
is also the second leading board
man on the Trojan five.

STANFORD'S GREAT TOM DOSE, 55, takes off a rebound as Indians Clay Raaka, at right and Gary
Loveridge, 21, look on. UCLA players, left to right, are Keith Erickson, Gail Goodrich and Kenny
Washington. Dose's 38 points weren't enough, however, as UCLA won the game, 100-88.
Tom Dose put on a groat per
formance at the Stanford Pavilion
but Walt Hazzard stole t ho show
with his brilliant playmaking Sat
urday night as the nationally lop
ranked UCLA Bruins came from
11 points back to run up 100
points and heat the Indians. 100-88.
It was Ihc first time in me
mory that any team has hit the
century mark against Stanford
anywhere, lot alone in the friendly
confines of the Pavilion.
l)()Si: BANGUI) in 38 points to
come within two of Ron Tomsic's
Pavilion scoring mark as the In
dians gave unbeaten UCLA its
biggest scare of the season.
It took a repeat of last month's
lightning-like blitz at LA's Sports
Arena to overtake and beat the
Tribe. Stanford had .jumped off to
an early lead right at the start,
and stretched it to 36-25 with 7:30
remaining in the first half on a
Dose three point play.
UCLA fought right back, clos
ing the gap lo six on Hazzard and
Gail Goodrich buckets and a Haz
zard free throw. Stanford re
fused to crack at this point,
though, and held on for a live
point 42*37 margin.
TIIK FIRST HALF saw Haz
zard put on one of the finest
clutch performances of this or
any other season. Time and again,
the great All-American either
found the b u c k e t or spotted a
teammate open for an easy shot.
His pinpoint passing and shoot
ing were responsible for 20 of
UCLA's 37 first half points via
either the scoring or assist route.

Had Hazzard not risen to the occa
sion, Stanford could have held
such a commanding halftime edge
tiiat the Bruins could never have
caught them. But Hazzard was
Ihere.
Within easy reach at the inter

mission, Stanford still refused to
crack until the second half was
almost 8 minutes old. The key to
the Indian collapse was ihe loss
of high-jumping forward Clayton
Raaka on fouls.
RAAKA WENT out with the
Tribe still even at 53 all. He had
been the key to the Indians' crack
ing the vaunted UCLA zone press.
Even though Stanford dirl move
out to a short-lived six point edge
after losing Raaka, his loss was
felt sorely two minutes later as
the Bruin press began to take
effect.
Its effect was so great, in fact,
that in a two minute and 38 sec
ond span, the 59-53 Indian margin
was converted into a 77 to 65
UCLA lead. Time and again in
that short time, Stanford threw

the ball away.
Soph Ray Kosanke, who h a d
moved over to take Raaka's spot
was unable to handle the passes
from Hollis Moore which had en
abled Stanford to move the ball.
KOSANKE, THOUGH, was one
of the key men through the entire
game. Coming in as a substitute
for forward Bob Bedell, the 6-10
forward played as well as anyone
on the floor. Ho, Raaka and Dose,
with their big height advantage,
combined to give Ihe Indians con
trol of the backboards in the first
half, and it was this control that
was responsible for their leaving
the floor with a lead at mid-game.
Had Raaka not fouled out, Ko
sanke would have remained in his
position at left forward, where he
had been so effective, and Stan
ford might have been able to con
tinue to move the ball, thus pre
venting the sudden Bruin blitz

Tom Dose put on a groat per
formance at the Stanford Pavilion
but Walt Hazzard stole t ho show
with his brilliant playmaking Sat
urday night as the nationally lop
ranked UCLA Bruins came from
11 points back to run up 100
points and heat the Indians. 100-88.
It was Ihc first time in me
mory that any team has hit the
century mark against Stanford
anywhere, lot alone in the friendly
confines of the Pavilion.
l)()Si: BANGUI) in 38 points to
come within two of Ron Tomsic's
Pavilion scoring mark as the In
dians gave unbeaten UCLA its
biggest scare of the season.
It took a repeat of last month's
lightning-like blitz at LA's Sports
Arena to overtake and beat the
Tribe. Stanford had .jumped off to
an early lead right at the start,
and stretched it to 36-25 with 7:30
remaining in the first half on a
Dose three point play.
UCLA fought right back, clos
ing the gap lo six on Hazzard and
Gail Goodrich buckets and a Haz
zard free throw. Stanford re
fused to crack at this point,
though, and held on for a live
point 42*37 margin.
TIIK FIRST HALF saw Haz
zard put on one of the finest
clutch performances of this or
any other season. Time and again,
the great All-American either
found the b u c k e t or spotted a
teammate open for an easy shot.
His pinpoint passing and shoot
ing were responsible for 20 of
UCLA's 37 first half points via
either the scoring or assist route.

Had Hazzard not risen to the occa
sion, Stanford could have held
such a commanding halftime edge
tiiat the Bruins could never have
caught them. But Hazzard was
Ihere.
Within easy reach at the inter

mission, Stanford still refused to
crack until the second half was
almost 8 minutes old. The key to
the Indian collapse was ihe loss
of high-jumping forward Clayton
Raaka on fouls.
RAAKA WENT out with the
Tribe still even at 53 all. He had
been the key to the Indians' crack
ing the vaunted UCLA zone press.
Even though Stanford dirl move
out to a short-lived six point edge
after losing Raaka, his loss was
felt sorely two minutes later as
the Bruin press began to take
effect.
Its effect was so great, in fact,
that in a two minute and 38 sec
ond span, the 59-53 Indian margin
was converted into a 77 to 65
UCLA lead. Time and again in
that short time, Stanford threw

the ball away.
Soph Ray Kosanke, who h a d
moved over to take Raaka's spot
was unable to handle the passes
from Hollis Moore which had en
abled Stanford to move the ball.
KOSANKE, THOUGH, was one
of the key men through the entire
game. Coming in as a substitute
for forward Bob Bedell, the 6-10
forward played as well as anyone
on the floor. Ho, Raaka and Dose,
with their big height advantage,
combined to give Ihe Indians con
trol of the backboards in the first
half, and it was this control that
was responsible for their leaving
the floor with a lead at mid-game.
Had Raaka not fouled out, Ko
sanke would have remained in his
position at left forward, where he
had been so effective, and Stan
ford might have been able to con
tinue to move the ball, thus pre
venting the sudden Bruin blitz
responsible for the Stanford de
feat.
