## PROVIDE LAUGH A MINUTE Stanford Ruggers Humble Trojans 
### PETER EAKLAND 
The famous Michigan football !
toam of years ago thai people
called the "point a minute team"
holds no advantage over the rug- i
I by team's performance Saturday, |
| as 15 points showed on the score- 1
board against the SC Trojans at
the end of the 40 minute first half. ,
Play trailed off in the second
half, and instead of a point a min
ute', Kmetovic's troops gave fans
a laugh a minute. The final score
was 64-0. Main contributors were j
Gordon Waddell, who piled up 26
points mostly through kicking,
and Brad Freeman and Steve Van
Nort, who bolh tallied three tries.
THE TROJANS, who hauled
down four national collegiate titles
last year and used victories over
the Indians as stepping stones in
each instance, are prime targets
of Stanford athletic teams. A vie
j tory over the Trojans is a sweet
one. and even though the outcome

in this game was never in doubt,
Stanford never let up.
Showing merey to SC is as fre
quently practiced at Stanford as
doing extra homework.
JOHN MCKAY, SC's football
coach, dictates an inflexible policy
that his learn shall not play rug
by. This rule is ihe only one of its
kind on the coast.
Stanford controlled the first
lineout, and after a flurry of
passes Dick Leeuwenberg was in
the goal area for a try. The scor
ing pace was fast and furious for
the entire half. Stanford's greater
speed meant that scoring plays
could begin from any place on
the field, and they did.
VAN NOIiT finished off a rush
with a 60-yard run down the right
sideline, and Ragsdale soon added
a 25-yard sprint through a hole
in ihe SC! defense to put Ihe In
dians up by 16.
Executing a perfect rush right,

| Stanford got every backfield mom
i her into tlie act and finally wing
! Dick Shaw was heading goahvard
: along the sideline as SC defenders
became futile pursuers. Minutes
; later, Stanford performed the
same play but this time "Tricky"
Shaw lateralled inside to Cla r k
Weaver, who scored.
Van Nort then went on a ram
page, scoring on power slants of
40 and 30 yards. Sandwiched be
tween his scoring efforts was a
beautiful 40-yard penalty kick by
Waddell.
MYKKK and Dick Rags
dale finished off the first half
scoring. Myers got his try on a 75-
yard run during which he slipped
between two SC players who then
succeeded in falling over each
other, much to the delight of the
partisan crowd.
In the second half, on three
rushes left, Stanford players look
ing for a free man on the ouside,
found Brad each time and he
! romped about 20 yards for the
! scores.
Kmetovic at this point, leading
f)6-0, began to have some substitu
tion fun. A rushing line of Frank
Patitucci, Jack Chappel, and Dick
Leeuwenberg, appeared on th e
field which is roughly equivalent
to playing football with a back
field of tackles and guards.
LEEIIWENBKBG moved down
field pointing goalward with the
hand that held the ball. This
Ruthian gesture was crowd-ap
pealing and also made him an
effective high post man.
Chappie and Patitucci were an
inspired fullback, halfback com
bination, occasionally running
around the hapless Trojans but
just as often running through
them.
Leeuwenberg began the final
scoring rush. He passed to Wad
dell who then reversed to Bob
Burke by means of a behind the
back handoff. Burke went the
necessary distance without being
the least bit molested.

speed meant that scoring plays

VAN NOIiT finished off a rush
with a 60-yard run down the right

a 25-yard sprint through a hole
in ihe SC! defense to put Ihe In

Shaw lateralled inside to Cla r k

Van Nort then went on a ram

40 and 30 yards. Sandwiched be

beautiful 40-yard penalty kick by
Waddell.
MYKKK and Dick Rags

scoring. Myers got his try on a 75-
yard run during which he slipped
between two SC players who then
succeeded in falling over each
other, much to the delight of the
partisan crowd.
In the second half, on three
rushes left, Stanford players look

found Brad each time and he

Kmetovic at this point, leading
f)6-0, began to have some substitu

Patitucci, Jack Chappel, and Dick
Leeuwenberg, appeared on th e
field which is roughly equivalent
to playing football with a back
field of tackles and guards.
LEEIIWENBKBG moved down
field pointing goalward with the
hand that held the ball. This
Ruthian gesture was crowd-ap
pealing and also made him an
effective high post man.
Chappie and Patitucci were an
inspired fullback, halfback com
bination, occasionally running
around the hapless Trojans but
just as often running through
them.
Leeuwenberg began the final
scoring rush. He passed to Wad

Burke by means of a behind the
back handoff. Burke went the
necessary distance without being
