# Indian Nine Debuts Well; Gains Three Straight Wins
## 
### 
Stanford's baseballers enjoyed
a successful opening last week,
sweeping to three straight wins
over the University of San Fran
cisco and San Jose State.
Tuesday afternoon the Indians
opened against the Dons of USF,
facing Jerry Eilers. Led by
George Thaeher's Iwo hits, Stan
ford jumped on Eilers for 4 runs
in the first inning and seven more
in ihe second, going on to win 15
to 1.
FRIDAY AFTERNOON, th e
Tribe walloped visiting San Jose
8-2 and Saturday travelled to San
Jose Municipal Stadium to whip
the Spartans again, this time 4-0.
Pitching was the key to the
good Indian start and pitching is,
or was, the big question mark for
tlie horsehiders of Coach Dutch
Fehring. Stanford went into this
season with only one proven var
sity pitcher, Dick Kovaeevich.
Three sophomores, Mike Con
nelly, Terry Docken and Dave
Dickson have been shoved into
the breach by Fehring and all
three have come through in fine
fashion. Connelly, also a football
quarterback, pitched three innings
in the Friday game, getting the
win.
DOCKEN WENT four innings
Saturday, but did not get the win
as Kovacevich threw the final five
shutout innings and was credited
with the victory. Dickson also
| went three innings on Friday.
Three games are on tap for Feh
ring's crew this week, all at home.
I Tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 p.m.
Stanford takes on San Francisco
State, Friday it's Cal Poly from
San Luis Obispo, and Saturday
Chieo State.
