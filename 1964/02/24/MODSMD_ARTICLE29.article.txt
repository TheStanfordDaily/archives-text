# Mississippi Commands More Immediate Action
## Editorial 
### 
Why go South when there is so much
civil rights work to he done in East Palo
Alto?
This question has been raised in many
a discussion of Stanford s role in the civil
right project this summer in Mississippi.
Perhaps the answer is simply that Mis
sissippi is Mississippi. II a man has a cold,
and at the same time lias a cut on his arm
that is bleeding, he will staunch the flow ol
blood and take care of the cut before he
treats his cold. For America, Mississippi is
the bleeding cut which must be treated. We
do not want to imply that all is well else
where in this country. We know it is not.
But in East Palo Alto, the police do not beat
people for registering to vote, nor are people
shot at and denied police protection. There
are degrees of injustice.
PERHAPS THE ANSWER lies in an ex
planation of what w ill be done iu Mississippi.

Students from Stanford and other colleges,
w ill go to Mississippi for about a month. They
will live with families there and w ill work in
two general areas: voter registration and
education.
A few students will go from door to door
urging people to register, explaining the pro
cedure.
Other students, a greater number, will
work in offices and behind the scenes on
problems arising from the registration cam
paign.
Hut by far the largest percentage ol
students will work in community education
projects. Students (and faculty members
who volunteer) will teach in such areas as
tvping, reading, modern dance, physical edu
cation, writing, biology and mathematics.
The subject matter is not essential. The aim
is to raise the outlook of the people in Mis
sissippi so lliey know there is something more

to life than picking cotton. So people there
will not say, as one woman said to a Stan
ford student last fall, "Why, we can't vote.
We's just poor nigger folk."
Contrast the Negro community oi Mis
sissippi with the Negro community of East
Palo Alto. The latter people have become
a part of the "tide of rising expectations."
They want a better life for their children,
and so they initiate the necessary programs
themselves. A drive is now underway to
improve the appearance of residents' homes
in East Palo Alto. Neighbors will be helping
neighbors.
In Ravenswood a tutorial program has
been started. Other programs are either al
ready in operation or in the advanced
planning stage.

We grant that students should work on
civil rights at home, too. There is much to be
done in this area. But the problem is no
where near as pressing here as it is in the
South.
And the South, too, should be considered
home.

treats his cold. For America, Mississippi is
the bleeding cut which must be treated. We
do not want to imply that all is well else
where in this country. We know it is not.
But in East Palo Alto, the police do not beat
people for registering to vote, nor are people
shot at and denied police protection. There
are degrees of injustice.
PERHAPS THE ANSWER lies in an ex
planation of what w ill be done iu Mississippi.

Students from Stanford and other colleges,
w ill go to Mississippi for about a month. They
will live with families there and w ill work in
two general areas: voter registration and
education.
A few students will go from door to door
urging people to register, explaining the pro
cedure.
Other students, a greater number, will
work in offices and behind the scenes on
problems arising from the registration cam
paign.
Hut by far the largest percentage ol
students will work in community education
projects. Students (and faculty members
who volunteer) will teach in such areas as
tvping, reading, modern dance, physical edu
cation, writing, biology and mathematics.
The subject matter is not essential. The aim
is to raise the outlook of the people in Mis
sissippi so lliey know there is something more

to life than picking cotton. So people there
will not say, as one woman said to a Stan
ford student last fall, "Why, we can't vote.
We's just poor nigger folk."
Contrast the Negro community oi Mis
sissippi with the Negro community of East
Palo Alto. The latter people have become
a part of the "tide of rising expectations."
They want a better life for their children,
and so they initiate the necessary programs
themselves. A drive is now underway to
improve the appearance of residents' homes
in East Palo Alto. Neighbors will be helping
neighbors.
In Ravenswood a tutorial program has
been started. Other programs are either al
ready in operation or in the advanced
planning stage.

We grant that students should work on
civil rights at home, too. There is much to be
done in this area. But the problem is no
where near as pressing here as it is in the
South.
And the South, too, should be considered
home.
Why go South when there is so much
civil rights work to he done in East Palo
Alto?
This question has been raised in many
a discussion of Stanford s role in the civil
right project this summer in Mississippi.
Perhaps the answer is simply that Mis
sissippi is Mississippi. II a man has a cold,
and at the same time lias a cut on his arm
that is bleeding, he will staunch the flow ol
blood and take care of the cut before he
treats his cold. For America, Mississippi is
the bleeding cut which must be treated. We
do not want to imply that all is well else
where in this country. We know it is not.
