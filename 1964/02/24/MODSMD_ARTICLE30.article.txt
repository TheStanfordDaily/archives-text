# A 						Clarification
## 
### 
We wish to clarify any misunderstanding
which may have resulted from our editorial
of last Wednesday on the Young Republi
cans-Young Democrats debate controversy.
First, the statement that Barbara West
erlund, the YR President, had "rifled through
Daily files without the Daily's consent,' to
retrieve a letter to the editor arose from a
misunderstanding between The Daily and
Miss Westerlund. We thought she was to

pick up the letter Monday morning; she had
understood that we told her to get it Sun
day night. She acted with conpletc hon
esty of intent.
Second, Bob Ronka, the YD President
wishes to make clear that while he personally
does not have the time to debate, a group of
YD speakers is ready and willing.
The part of the editorial which implied
that Ronka was to do the debating person
ally was based on a statement from Miss
Wcsterlund who understood Ronka to say
that he wished to debate personally.
On this and many other points, the two
sides claim categorically opposite facts. The
editorial was merely The Daihfs attempt to
present a fair picture of the situation and
we tried to make as honest a synthesis of
the divergent facts as we could.
We can now only conclude that both are
absolutely correct.
