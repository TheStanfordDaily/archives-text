# Perspective On The Future
## Government Training: College; Why Needed 
### Stephen Shefler 
Senators Stuart Symington and William Fullbright two years
ago proposed a plan to establish a National College »>l Adminis
tration and Diplomacy. The Symington-Fulbright plan was placed
into tlit* legislative mill, and there allowed promptk to die out.
While the bill perished on Capitol Mill, the weaknesses it
would have helped remedy did not. As the Peace Corps hits moved
this nation one step ahead toward better government .so too would
a National College of administration and Diplomacy. Evaluation
of this need should proceed from student levels, and then the
efforts to make this goal a reality should follow.
The creation of a National College of Administration and
Diplomacy would bring more qualified and better trained individ
uals into these vital sectors of the Federal Government. In an age
of increasing bureaucracy, it is necessary that the administrative
posts are not filled merely by adequately trained personnel in
some specialtv, but In individuals whose training in government
and democracy engender in them a sense of responsibility to the
elected officials, the legislature and the people.
★ ★ ★
MEDIOCRITY CURRENTLY SEEMS to be the adjective ap
plied to our civil servants in Washington; a prime cause ot this is
that the United States unlike Britain and trance accords little pres
tige to all those below the very highest levels ot the Administration.
The creation ot a National College of Diplomacy and Administra
tion—allowing candidates to be chosen by methods similar to those
emploved by West Point and Annapolis—would bestow great pres
tige to those who were chosen to attend.
In all probability, the rising interest in govennent would bring
a wealth of candidates to such a college, and thus admissions to the
college like admission to France's Ecole d Administration would
be an immense honor.
The administration would further benefit from the college by
having representation from more social strata, it is important in
times of change that the administration like the Congress should
represent not only one sector of the economy (the well to do), but
also recruit members of the other social classes. By providing a
college which would allow the future leaders of the National
Administration a free education, the means to a more highly
representative Administration would be opened.
In addition to economic distribution, by allowing Congress
men to choose the candidates, geographic distribution would per
mit even further representation of national sentiment in this arm
of the executive branch.

ago proposed a plan to establish a National College »>l Adminis
tration and Diplomacy. The Symington-Fulbright plan was placed
into tlit* legislative mill, and there allowed promptk to die out.
While the bill perished on Capitol Mill, the weaknesses it
would have helped remedy did not. As the Peace Corps hits moved
this nation one step ahead toward better government .so too would
a National College of administration and Diplomacy. Evaluation
of this need should proceed from student levels, and then the
efforts to make this goal a reality should follow.
The creation of a National College of Administration and
Diplomacy would bring more qualified and better trained individ
uals into these vital sectors of the Federal Government. In an age
of increasing bureaucracy, it is necessary that the administrative
posts are not filled merely by adequately trained personnel in
some specialtv, but In individuals whose training in government
and democracy engender in them a sense of responsibility to the
elected officials, the legislature and the people.

MEDIOCRITY CURRENTLY SEEMS to be the adjective ap
plied to our civil servants in Washington; a prime cause ot this is
that the United States unlike Britain and trance accords little pres
tige to all those below the very highest levels ot the Administration.
The creation ot a National College of Diplomacy and Administra
tion—allowing candidates to be chosen by methods similar to those
emploved by West Point and Annapolis—would bestow great pres
tige to those who were chosen to attend.
In all probability, the rising interest in govennent would bring
a wealth of candidates to such a college, and thus admissions to the
college like admission to France's Ecole d Administration would
be an immense honor.
The administration would further benefit from the college by
having representation from more social strata, it is important in
times of change that the administration like the Congress should
represent not only one sector of the economy (the well to do), but
also recruit members of the other social classes. By providing a
college which would allow the future leaders of the National
Administration a free education, the means to a more highly
representative Administration would be opened.
In addition to economic distribution, by allowing Congress
men to choose the candidates, geographic distribution would per
mit even further representation of national sentiment in this arm
of the executive branch.

vocating a National College of Administration and Diplomacy.)
