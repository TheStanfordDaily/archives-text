# Summer Voter Registration Project Criticized
## The 						mailbox 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I was greatly amused by the
! wording of the editorial on voter
registration in the South in the
; February 17 issue of The Daily.
I For instance: "Students are es*
! peeially well suited lor this type
j of activity because most of them
I have the available time, the frce
j dom from other responsibilities,
| the training and the physical en
durance." Perhaps another rea
son that they are so ideally suited
is that often unbounded idealism
gives them some sort of messi
anic complex. "Southerners, we
are here to save you in the name
of God, Bobby Kennedy, and
ASSU." This is to my way of
thinking the wrong approach.
The South is going to change,
but that change is going to be
long, slow and painful. The
change is going to have to come
from within. All of the federal
troops and Stanford students in
the world are not going to change
the bigotry which has been in
grained in the South for three
hundred years. Attitudes will
have to, and I feel eventually will,
change.
Demonstrations, sit-ins, etc. are
only good up to a point. When
they incite riots and bloodshed, |
they only serve to increase hatred
on both sides, rather than to
achieve their primary goal of
pointing out the need for a
change and for the reduction and
elimination of hatred, bigotry,
and inequality.
Perhaps before the campus is
decimated by the students rush
ing to Mississippi, these same
students should ask themselves
how they would feel if some
Southerners came to Stanford to
solve all of ASSU's problems, and
furthermore, what results Stan
ford-in-Jackson is really having.

; Editor, The Daily:
If The Daily has seen fit, for
! reasons never specified in Mr.
Leopold's article, to stir up the
I alreadv muddied waters of Hie

LSD controversy, one can at least
expect that the situation be de
scribed accurately.
First, Ihe story of the self
deified youth rushing into traffic
is oft-repeated, but never substan
tiated. Secondly, the abrogation
of LSD research did not happen
"soon afterwards," and had noth
ing to do with this alleged incid
ent. Furthermore, their work at
Walpole State Prison was neither
brief nor unsuccessful; and the
serious intent of the undertak
ing is perhaps not conveyed ade
quately by the term "fling."
Their experiment in Mexico
was certainly not for "Harvard
students who happened to pass
t hat way." The dismissal of Al
port and Leary, according to Har
vard's official statement, was not
related to the LSD black market,
nor did these illicit sales begin
only last Spring. Leary was fired
early in the Spring for not re
porting to classes, and Alport's
appointment was terminated for
breach of a previous agreement
about undergraduates taking
drugs. Moreover, IFIF no longer
exists at all, even tenuously. We
conclude by wondering just how
Mr. Leopold is privy to Harvard's
and Yale's inner councils, such
that he can proclaim their com
mon disinterest in "internal free
dom."
Wo suggest that in his next
article Mr. Leopold spend more
time on facts and less on mali
cious insinuat ions.

i Editor, The Daily:
1 am writing this letter to ad
vertise the relatively unpubli
j ci/.ed, but I feci important, role
of the National Student Associa
tion at Stanford. By the end of
I this year NSA will have i>een in-
I volved in two long-range confer
ences, the plans and effects of
Avhich will nvtfMirl far Iw'votid

J
i campus borders. Because Stan
i ford is a large school with many
| organizations participating in stu
' dent actions and affairs some
NSA campus projects arc not
particularly applicable here. This
is why NSA-Stanford works in
areas that tend to go beyond im
mediate student interests.
November 22-24, twelve Stan
ford students attended an NSA
| sponsored conference on "Califor
i nia Farm Labor Problems" held
at the University of Redlands.
In the first week of April Stan
; ford will sponsor an opening pro
gram for an Asian seminar series
that will expand to six other large
western schools. . . .
NSA is financed by ASSU funds.
The 1963-64 budget is $2,195, over
three-fourths of which is spent to
send delegates to the national con
gress. (The remainder can be
broken down to dues, regional
conference costs, and administra
tive expenses.)
The national congress is the ma
jor expenditure, and a valuable
part of the NSA program at Stan
ford. The delegates are approved
by LASSU and hold positions of
responsibility on the campus. . . .
First of all these students rep
resent Stanford students and rep
resent. the students of the United
States. Their decisions represent
the largest national student force
! in the western world. These opin
j ions carry weight.
As well, the national congress
draws these Stanford student
leaders together for ten days in
an atmosphere full of debate. This
is a unique opportunity for them
to get to know each other, to ex
change ideas with their counter
parts from over 415 other schools,
and to begin to develop a set of
beliefs on which they can act in
! concord during the following
year.
For those interested, a resume
Hi Stanford-NSA and NSA re
gional activities will be presented
at the LASSU meeting, Thursday,
| February 27.
