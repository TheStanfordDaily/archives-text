# Notes And Observations
## Leaders Ask For Right To Speak For Students 
### John Bonine 
The question of student government's involvement in political
activity has been raised again as a result of recent — and pro
posed — actions of LASSU.
This involvement requires critical examination; our campus
politicos are constantly waging a battle for what the\ label "stu
dent rights, for the expression ol "student opinion." Tliev insist
that they be allowed to "speak out on issues and participate in
"activist causes.
But the "rights' for which tliev agitate are powers for a col
lectivity, not rights for students as individuals. The "rights of
which they speak are the rights to speak and act on behalf of —
and in the name of — the Stanford student body. The involve
ment for which they strive is the involvement of the student gov
ernment.
The rationale behind these efforts is often said to be "com
batting apathy" and "stimulating politcal awareness." That dis
cussion is not really desired, however, is evident from attempts
to rush programs and resolutions through LASSU at a single meet
ing with little or no discussion. Three recent proposed by-law
amendments were efforts to restrain w hat their sponsors considered
"railroading."

EVEN IF THERE WERE discussions of political issues in
LASSU, some members question the value of taking up LASSU s
time on such matters to the exclusion of campus problems. It is diffi
cult to maintain that such debate would do much to stimulate any
additional political interest on the part of the student body. Ihe
plight of the Student Congress — and of the Model U.S. Senate
before that — demonstrates the failure of that approach to gener
ate interest.
It would be interesting to find out just how many of those call
ing for LASSU involvement in politics ever bothered to attend the
Student Congress meetings.
Finally, the extent of LASSSU s "representativeness on politi
cal issues is itself questionable. LASSU representatives are not
elected on the basis of their political views and no attempt has
been made to discover whether the students even waul LASSU
to speak for them on such matters.
In the Stanford Daily students have a highly useful forum for
the discussion of all issues, off-campus as well as on-cainpus. As
a result of the decision of the Stanford Board of I rustees last
spring, establishing new policies toward voluntary political or
ganizations, students arc gaining a workable means ol implement
ing their many, various, and conflicting political programs.
To snuff out this diversity in delerence to the actions of a
single and compulsory agency, or to give such, an agency predomi
nance over voluntary groups, can only retard the progress being
made toward widespread and meaningful political activity at Stan
ford.

Student Congress meetings.
Finally, the extent of LASSSU s "representativeness on politi
cal issues is itself questionable. LASSU representatives are not
elected on the basis of their political views and no attempt has
been made to discover whether the students even waul LASSU
to speak for them on such matters.
In the Stanford Daily students have a highly useful forum for
the discussion of all issues, off-campus as well as on-cainpus. As
a result of the decision of the Stanford Board of I rustees last
spring, establishing new policies toward voluntary political or
ganizations, students arc gaining a workable means ol implement
ing their many, various, and conflicting political programs.
To snuff out this diversity in delerence to the actions of a
single and compulsory agency, or to give such, an agency predomi

made toward widespread and meaningful political activity at Stan

The question of student government's involvement in political
activity has been raised again as a result of recent — and pro
posed — actions of LASSU.
This involvement requires critical examination; our campus
politicos are constantly waging a battle for what the\ label "stu
dent rights, for the expression ol "student opinion." Tliev insist
that they be allowed to "speak out on issues and participate in
"activist causes.
But the "rights' for which tliev agitate are powers for a col
lectivity, not rights for students as individuals. The "rights of
which they speak are the rights to speak and act on behalf of —
and in the name of — the Stanford student body. The involve
ment for which they strive is the involvement of the student gov
ernment.
The rationale behind these efforts is often said to be "com
batting apathy" and "stimulating politcal awareness." That dis
cussion is not really desired, however, is evident from attempts
to rush programs and resolutions through LASSU at a single meet
ing with little or no discussion. Three recent proposed by-law
amendments were efforts to restrain w hat their sponsors considered
"railroading."

EVEN IF THERE WERE discussions of political issues in
LASSU, some members question the value of taking up LASSU s
time on such matters to the exclusion of campus problems. It is diffi
cult to maintain that such debate would do much to stimulate any
additional political interest on the part of the student body. Ihe
plight of the Student Congress — and of the Model U.S. Senate
before that — demonstrates the failure of that approach to gener
ate interest.
It would be interesting to find out just how many of those call
ing for LASSU involvement in politics ever bothered to attend the
Student Congress meetings.
