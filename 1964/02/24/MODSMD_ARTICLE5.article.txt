# Five Stanford Scientists Awarded Sloan Fellowships For Research
## 
### 
Five young Stanford scientists,
including some rated by col
leagues "among the country's
most promising young physicists
and mathematicians." have been
awarded Alfred P. Sloan Fellow
ships for two years of unre
stricted basic research. The Stan-

ford scientists, whose grants are
effective in September are:
• Samuel M. Berman, associate
professor of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center.
• Paul J. Cohen, associate pro
fessor of mathematics.
• Dana S. Scott, assistant pro
fessor of logic and mathematics.
• Peter L. Scott, assistant pro
fessor of physics.
• John D. Walecka, associate
professor of physics.
They were among 94 scientists
throughout the U.S. and Canada
I who received the grants, which
are awarded upon recommenda
tion of other scientists rather than
by application. It was the largest
number of Sloan Research Fellow- J
ships ever granted in one year, j
totaling $1,400,000. Recipients of I
the grants were selected from the |
faculties of 140 universities and
colleges. Of the 91 scientists se
lected, 17 represent universities in
California: 2 from California In
stitute of Technology: 6 from the
University of California at Berke
ley: 2 from UCLA; 2 from the:

University of California at San
Diego; and the 5 from Stanford.
Two of (he Sloan Research Fel
lows from Stanford. Professor
Peter Scott and Professor Jo h n
Walecka have declared their re
search plans. Scott is an experi
mental solid-state physicist who
plans to do spectroscopic studies
of ruby laser materials and other
solids which will involve the use
of microwave ultrasonic (high
frequency sound) techniques.
Walecka will continue research in
nuclear theory, and is currently
on leave under a Sloan fellowship
at CERN, the 13-nation nuclear
research center at Geneva, Swit
zerland.
In addition to the Program for
Basic Research in the Physical
Sciences, the Foundation supports
certain other fellowship programs
and the Allied P. Sloan National
Scholarship Program for college
undergraduates. Established in
1934 by Mr. Sloan, the Foundation
is primarily a grant-making or
ganization. Its funds go prin
cipally for research and education.

including some rated by col
leagues "among the country's
most promising young physicists
and mathematicians." have been
awarded Alfred P. Sloan Fellow
ships for two years of unre
stricted basic research. The Stan-

ford scientists, whose grants are
effective in September are:
• Samuel M. Berman, associate
professor of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center.
• Paul J. Cohen, associate pro
fessor of mathematics.
• Dana S. Scott, assistant pro
fessor of logic and mathematics.
• Peter L. Scott, assistant pro
fessor of physics.
• John D. Walecka, associate
professor of physics.
They were among 94 scientists
throughout the U.S. and Canada
I who received the grants, which
are awarded upon recommenda
tion of other scientists rather than
by application. It was the largest
number of Sloan Research Fellow- J
ships ever granted in one year, j
totaling $1,400,000. Recipients of I
the grants were selected from the |
faculties of 140 universities and
colleges. Of the 91 scientists se
lected, 17 represent universities in
California: 2 from California In
stitute of Technology: 6 from the
University of California at Berke
ley: 2 from UCLA; 2 from the:

University of California at San
Diego; and the 5 from Stanford.
Two of (he Sloan Research Fel
lows from Stanford. Professor
Peter Scott and Professor Jo h n
Walecka have declared their re
search plans. Scott is an experi
mental solid-state physicist who
plans to do spectroscopic studies
of ruby laser materials and other
solids which will involve the use
of microwave ultrasonic (high
frequency sound) techniques.
Walecka will continue research in
nuclear theory, and is currently
on leave under a Sloan fellowship
at CERN, the 13-nation nuclear
research center at Geneva, Swit
zerland.
In addition to the Program for
Basic Research in the Physical
Sciences, the Foundation supports
certain other fellowship programs
and the Allied P. Sloan National
Scholarship Program for college
undergraduates. Established in
1934 by Mr. Sloan, the Foundation
is primarily a grant-making or
ganization. Its funds go prin
cipally for research and education.
