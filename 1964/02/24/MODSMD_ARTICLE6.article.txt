# TRUSTEES REFUSE FUNDS
## Powerlines Dispute Appealed To Johnson Woodside Mayor Writes President 
### JIM HORNE Managing Editor 
Woodside Mayor Donald J.
Graham has appealed to Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson to prevent
tho installation of overhead power
lines to the Stanford Linear
Accelerator.
In a letter to Johnson, Graham
claimed that an overhead power
line would "deface for all time
one of the most beautiful recre
ational and residential area in
tho United States."
"THE 4,2(10 PEOPLE I repre
sent feel that the additional cost
for undergrounding the power
lines is justified and have voted
to quadruple their city property
taxes to pay their share of the
cost of such a project," said
Graham.
Graham's appeal followed re
jection by the Board of Trustees
of a proposal that the University
appropriate $500,000 to help meet
the $3.6 million cost of burying
the 300 megawatt lines.
In a resolution passed at their
regular monthly meeting Thurs
day in San Francisco the Trustees
said that the University "cannot
justify devoting its own funds,
held in trust for other educational
purposes, to a national facility of
this kind."
THE RESOLUTION requested
that the Atomic Energy Com
mission reconsider financing the
added costs of a sub-surface line.
The AEC has previously indicated
that it will provide only $220,000
to help underground th e lines,
and, following Thursday's meet
ing of the Trustees, AEC General
Manager A. R. Luedeeke stated
that "Stanford's action does nol
change the situation at all as far
as the AEC is concerned."
Both the Committee for Green
Foothills and the Save Our Sky
lino (SOS) Committee maintain
the issue is far from dead.
PAUL McCLOSKEY, SOS at
torney. declared that "The fight
is just beginning," while Mary
Moffat, executive director of the
Green Foothills group, says her
committee will continue to try to
prevent installation of overhead
lines.
More than 4,000 area residents
have signed petitions circulated
by the Green Foothills Commit
tee which protest the overhead
power lines.
BOTH C O 31 M I T T E E S ex
pressed disappointment following
the Trustees' decision.
"Stanford bears a heavy respon
sibility in this and we had hoped
they would bear their share of
the cost of the undergrounding,"
said Mrs. Moffat.
McCloskey said that the Trus
tees "have placed upon them
selves the entire responsibility
for the line going overhead."
Despite Luedecke's indication
that the AEC would supply no
more than $220,000, McCloskey
feels that "there may be some
chance" that the Trustees will be
able to encourage the AEC to re
consider additional financing for
the line.
THE AEC' has said it will con
demn the land for an overhead
line, unless the additional $3.6
million is raised by March 9.
Pacific Gas and Electric has al
ready appropriated $1,012,000 for
the underground lines, and the
Woodside Council voted last week
to quadruple the town's tax rate
to raise $150,000.
THE ORIGINAL SOS proposal
had suggested that Stanford put
up $500,000, the AEC $700,000,
and San Mateo County $350,000
to help finance a 189 megawatt
line. But Rep. Craig Hosmer, a
Long Beach republican on the
Joint Committee on Atomic
Energy, said last Monday that if
the line is underground, the Com
mittee will orobably insist on pro
viding facilities for 300 mega

watts, not just the 180 megawatts
which would not meet the accel
erator's needs after 1972.
The estimated cost of a 300
megawatt line is $3.6 million, a
$1 million increase over the 180
megawatt line for which the citi
zen s groups had made the finan
cial proposals.

$1 million increase over the 180
megawatt line for which the citi
zen s groups had made the finan
cial proposals.
Woodside Mayor Donald J.
Graham has appealed to Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson to prevent
tho installation of overhead power
lines to the Stanford Linear
Accelerator.
In a letter to Johnson, Graham
claimed that an overhead power
line would "deface for all time
one of the most beautiful recre
ational and residential area in
tho United States."
"THE 4,2(10 PEOPLE I repre
sent feel that the additional cost
for undergrounding the power
lines is justified and have voted
to quadruple their city property
taxes to pay their share of the
cost of such a project," said
Graham.
Graham's appeal followed re
jection by the Board of Trustees
of a proposal that the University
appropriate $500,000 to help meet
the $3.6 million cost of burying
the 300 megawatt lines.
In a resolution passed at their
regular monthly meeting Thurs
day in San Francisco the Trustees
said that the University "cannot
justify devoting its own funds,
held in trust for other educational
purposes, to a national facility of
this kind."
THE RESOLUTION requested
that the Atomic Energy Com
mission reconsider financing the
added costs of a sub-surface line.
The AEC has previously indicated
that it will provide only $220,000
to help underground th e lines,
and, following Thursday's meet
ing of the Trustees, AEC General
Manager A. R. Luedeeke stated
that "Stanford's action does nol
change the situation at all as far
as the AEC is concerned."
Both the Committee for Green
Foothills and the Save Our Sky
lino (SOS) Committee maintain
the issue is far from dead.
PAUL McCLOSKEY, SOS at
torney. declared that "The fight
is just beginning," while Mary
Moffat, executive director of the
Green Foothills group, says her
committee will continue to try to
prevent installation of overhead
lines.
More than 4,000 area residents
have signed petitions circulated
by the Green Foothills Commit
tee which protest the overhead
power lines.
BOTH C O 31 M I T T E E S ex
pressed disappointment following
the Trustees' decision.
"Stanford bears a heavy respon
sibility in this and we had hoped
they would bear their share of
the cost of the undergrounding,"
said Mrs. Moffat.
McCloskey said that the Trus
tees "have placed upon them
selves the entire responsibility
for the line going overhead."
Despite Luedecke's indication
that the AEC would supply no
more than $220,000, McCloskey
feels that "there may be some
chance" that the Trustees will be
able to encourage the AEC to re
consider additional financing for
the line.
THE AEC' has said it will con
demn the land for an overhead
line, unless the additional $3.6
million is raised by March 9.
Pacific Gas and Electric has al
ready appropriated $1,012,000 for
the underground lines, and the
Woodside Council voted last week
to quadruple the town's tax rate
to raise $150,000.
THE ORIGINAL SOS proposal
had suggested that Stanford put
up $500,000, the AEC $700,000,
and San Mateo County $350,000
to help finance a 189 megawatt
line. But Rep. Craig Hosmer, a
Long Beach republican on the
Joint Committee on Atomic
Energy, said last Monday that if
the line is underground, the Com
mittee will orobably insist on pro
viding facilities for 300 mega

watts, not just the 180 megawatts
which would not meet the accel
erator's needs after 1972.
The estimated cost of a 300
megawatt line is $3.6 million, a
$1 million increase over the 180
megawatt line for which the citi
