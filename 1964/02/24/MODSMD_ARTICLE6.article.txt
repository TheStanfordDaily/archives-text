# TRUSTEES REFUSE FUNDS
## Powerlines Dispute Appealed To Johnson Woodside Mayor Writes President 
### JIM HORNE Managing Editor 
Woodside Mayor Donald J.
Graham has appealed to Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson to prevent
tho installation of overhead power
lines to the Stanford Linear
Accelerator.
In a letter to Johnson, Graham
claimed that an overhead power
line would "deface for all time
one of the most beautiful recre
ational and residential area in
tho United States."
"THE 4,2(10 PEOPLE I repre
sent feel that the additional cost
for undergrounding the power
lines is justified and have voted
to quadruple their city property
taxes to pay their share of the
cost of such a project," said
Graham.
Graham's appeal followed re
jection by the Board of Trustees
of a proposal that the University
appropriate $500,000 to help meet
the $3.6 million cost of burying
the 300 megawatt lines.
In a resolution passed at their
regular monthly meeting Thurs
day in San Francisco the Trustees
said that the University "cannot
justify devoting its own funds,
held in trust for other educational
purposes, to a national facility of
this kind."
THE RESOLUTION requested
that the Atomic Energy Com
mission reconsider financing the
added costs of a sub-surface line.
The AEC has previously indicated
that it will provide only $220,000
to help underground th e lines,
and, following Thursday's meet
ing of the Trustees, AEC General
Manager A. R. Luedeeke stated
that "Stanford's action does nol
change the situation at all as far
as the AEC is concerned."
Both the Committee for Green
Foothills and the Save Our Sky
lino (SOS) Committee maintain
the issue is far from dead.
PAUL McCLOSKEY, SOS at
torney. declared that "The fight
is just beginning," while Mary
Moffat, executive director of the
Green Foothills group, says her
committee will continue to try to
prevent installation of overhead
lines.
