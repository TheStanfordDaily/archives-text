# STANFORD UNITED NATIONS
## SUN Ends After Busy Session 
### BOB PICKUS 
In a session blessed by vivid use of im
agination, and an atmosphere illuminated by
feminine splendor, the Stanford United Na
tions approved 11 legislative proposals this
weekend.
Tile parley convened Thursday afternoon,
when delegates gathered in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium for the keynote address by Senator
Frank Church.
Discussing "The Changing Hole of the
United Nations," the Senator laid much of the
blame for lack of American enthusiasm t<
the fact that the U.N. was "oversold" to the
American people.
"When the United Nations is seen in iK
proper light," lie pointed out, "the wondei
is not that it has accomplished so little, but
that it has accomplished so much."
The business itself opened on Frida>
morning when, after a heated l.vminutc de
bate, the General Assembly defeated a
French proposal to place the possible admis
tion of Red China on the agenda. The vot(
of 42 for, 37 against, fell far short of the two
thirds required for passage.
The body then proceeded to approve
eight euiuitcuUvc resolutions, all ui them b>

large margins. Among those passed were
proposals calling for a mandate of South
West Africa, the denuclearization of Latin
America, establishment of a U.N. mediating
commission in Cyprus, and the enlargement
of the Security Council to 15 nations.
The final measures passed expressed dis
approval of French absence at the disarma
ment conference, redefined the U.N. economic
and social development pool, and called for
resolution of the Palestine refugee problem.
The business portion of the program was
highlighted by the contributions of freshman
Ceinwen Klepper, represented the USSR
Ceinwen presented that nation's opening re
marks in flawless Russian, as her listeners
desperately fumbled for their U.N. earphones,
only to find that the Board of Trustees had
failed to provide them.
Easily the most illuminating feature of
the conclave was that offered by the beauti
ful page girls recruited from the four corners
of the Stanford world. Because of the
"poetry in motion," many a delegate found
concentrating on the official business not
only difficult, but also at times somewhat
undesirable. Perhaps outstanding among her
comrades was the page girl who confided
that she had received 10 date proposals from
male participants in the span oi two sliuil

hours!
The parley was brightened considerably
by I he colorful costumes and ingenious antics
of the delegates. The Soviets pounded their
shoos to gain attention, and representatives
from Saudi Arabia, Nepal, and Cuba d i s
played creative dress, appropriate* lo their
respective countries.
Friday afternoon the Saudi Arabian dele
gation rose to a point of personal privilege.
"It is now three o'clock here," he reported,
"and live o'clock in Saudi Arabia. It's time
to pray to Allah!" With that the entire Saudi
Arabian delegation knelt in the aisle and
prayed to its leader.
During the bitter debate on the final pro
posal. one calling for the formation of a
single German confederate republic, paper
money was distributed throughout the As
sembly, representing alleged attempts at
bribery. When, during the roll call, the Aus
tralian delegate rose to speak, he annonuced
his disgust at having received not even a
single offer of bribery.
"For this reason," he stated, "Australia
will abstain."
Immediately a call was heard from the
opposite side of the auditorium;
"Wait a minute Australia!"
The motion on Gciinany waa defeated.
