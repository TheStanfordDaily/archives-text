# A 						New Look At LSD

"Halfway between waking
and sleeping, ... as a chill in
a dream . . . absolutely de
lightful."
This rather groping descrip
tion of the effect of halluci
gens drugs was hesistantly
offered by a graduate student
in the department of psychol
ogy who look part in the ex
perimental research conduct
ed by (Tom) Leary and Dick
Alpert at Harvard a year ago.
These men, whose experi
ments led to controversy and,
eventually, to dismissal from
Harvard, are now in Upper
New York State working on
three books explaining and
defending their work. A high
ly critical press, according to
the grad s 1 u d ent — who
wishes to remain anonymous
due to the "extreme sensi
tivity of psych community"
to the issue—has substan
tially misrepresented four
major issues of the contro
versy.
I) MEDICAL supervision
— Alpert and Leary broke
with tradition by conducting
their research in "informal"
settings. There was a valid
reason for this. All the pre
vious research with halluci
gens had been conducted by
Mil's in a medical setting.
These tests, reasoned Alpert
and Leary, lent themselves to
"rigged" reactions; that is,
"if one took the drug in a
mental hospital with doctors
standing around asking—sug
gesting—if you felt any fear,
then you'd begin to feel psy
chopathic."
Thus, Leary and Alpert fell
that "set and setting" were
paramount. To this end, they
attempted to pr o vi d e a
"warm, open, and loving envi
ronment" that would provoke
a variety of experiences. Yet
all their experiments were at
tended by some one medically

qualified, even though none
was ever needed.
2) Looseness of Experi
ments —Since the two young
profs were treading on un
known ground, they decided
to make their research a
"survey enterprise" by map
ping a wide range of possible
experiences. For this reason
— along with th e "warm,
open, and loving *' cause
stated above — their experi
ments encompassed not only
informal sessions in students'
apartment, hut also such im
probable adventures as hav
ing a chaplain give an Easter
service to four students on
psylocybin.
As varied as th e experi
ments were, 90 per cent said
the experience was "pleasant,
beautiful, and fantastic" and
would take it again.
8) THE HOUSE — a third
related issue is the House,
Alpert's home in Cambridge
which was open to all inter
ested in joining the experi
mental group. Publicity
hrou g h t everything from
New York junkies to itiner
ant students to the house.
They were, to use an out
sider's term, "wicrd," "They
were "parasites" whom Al
pert and Leary look in "out
of the goodness of their
hearts."
Yet there were others,
notably the late Aldous Hux
ley, Allen Ginsberg, A I Ie n
Watts —"whose hook "Joyous
Cosmology" describes his ex
perience with the drug cult
ists" —and even the ex-King
of Sumatra.
4) THE EFFECT on grades
—supposedly, those who took
part in the research did
worse on the finals. Of the
II grad students at Harvard
who participated in the Al
pert-Leary work, none did
worse on the final than they
had before they began the ex
periments.
