THE CROSSED ROAD TO HELL
Every Christian shares Christ's compassion for the lost, those who are living
apart from God anil who choose to follow their own ways instead of seeking God's
plan for their lives. Perhaps yon are among tin many who are going along with
this crowd. The fact that SO per cent to 90 per cent of your friends will end tip
in J Fell. too. will hardly ease your own eternal, conscious torment! In Hell there
will he little consolation in numbers.
Hell is a place where God's love and light do not shine, and the Bible tells
us that there is no way out. In Luke 16 we see a vivid picture of what Tlell
is like, and how many men choose to ignore God's repeated warnings about a place
of eternal punishment.
"And it came to pass that the beggar (Lazarus) died and was carried by the
angels into Abraham's bosom: The rich man also died, and was buried; and in
Hell' be lifted up his eyes being in torment, and seeth Abraham afar off and
Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on
me and send Lazarus that he may dip his finger in water and cool my tongue;
for 1 am tormented in this flame. But Abraham said, remember that thou in thy
life time receivest good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things, but now he is
comfortable and Thou art tormented. And beside all this, between us and you
is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot;
neither can they pass to us that would come from thence. Then be (the rich man)
said, I pray thee therefore father, that thou wouldest send him (Lazarus) to my
father's house: For 1 have five brethren, that he may testify unto them, lest they
also come into this place of torment. Abraham saith unto him, they have Moses
and the prophets; let them hear them. And he said. Nay Father Abraham: but
if one went to them from the dead they will repent. And he (Abraham) said unto
him. If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded
though one rose from the dead." Luke 16:22-31.
God does not "send a person to hell." The entire world is condemned and
man is totally depraved by nature. Hell is the road we are all on unless we seek
God's help and intervention on an individual basis. Sin has condemned man, and
every last one of us has sinned. (Rom. 3:23, John 3:16-21, Rom. 3:10-20).
In this wonderful age of grace God has provided for man so that none need
spend eternity apart from Him. Escaping hell forever is so simple: all one need
do is humbly seek God's mercy and invite Jesus Christ into heart and life. God
does all the work of salvation, and waits only for your decision to accept His
eternal Son.
"... But now in the end of the world (agcl bath he (Christ) appeared
to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And as it is appointed unto men
oncc to die, but after this the judgment, so Christ was once offered to bear the
sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear a second time
without sin unto salvation." Heb. 9:26-28.
The religions of the world which are man's attempts toreach God do not
bring a person one step closer to salvation nor insure anyone against eternity in
hell. Christianity is different, since it is God who takes the initiative in saving
lost man. Jesus Christ, who knew no sin was made sin for us. He died for the
sins of the entire world to bridge the gap between a holy and just God and a
sinful race of humans.
"But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being wit
nessed by the law and the prophets: even the righteousness of God which it by
faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all of them that believe. For there is no
difference. For all have sinned and come short of the glory (perfection) of God;
being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in bis blood, to de
clare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the for
bearance of God." Rom. 3:21-25.
You will not escape hell by taking up "religion," nor by shaping up and
putting on good behaviour. God wants to make a new creation out of you and
to implant the immortal Spirit of Christ in your heart, so that you will be fit to
stand it) his presence, forever justified and perfected in Christ. "Yon must be
born-again." (John 3:3).
We urge you to heed this warning of Jesus:
"Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate and broad is the way
that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat." Matt. 7-13.
Jesus said, "I am the door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved."
John 10:9.
Tf you today invite Jesus Christ into your heart as Lord and Saviour, God
will make you forever secure from the eternal torment of hell. God's response
to your decision to accept Christ will be real and positive, and you will not be
left wondering about the reality of the Hell you have escaped nor the heaven you
will thenceforth be bound for. Our sincere desire is to help you in any way pos
sible by answering your questions. The Bible is our sole authority and we represent
no particular denomination or religious group. No mattfr who you are. and what
your sins may be, we know that Jesus can save you!
