Why t a k e hallucigcnic
drugs?
This rather basic question
has been lost amid the rim
ing 1 controversy over "who
took what where and with
what effect" that has em
broiled the psychology com
munity.
The answer to "Why?" is
more profound than "because
it is there"; rather, it is be
cause the experience can lie,
in the words of one student
who went through the Har
vard experiment, "one of the
most educational and benefi
cial experiences of my life."
The benefit derived from
this transcending effect is
that it can de-emphasize the
ego and can make one more
open to the feelings of others.
To explain the effect of
hailucigens, an arresting it
somewhat unsatisfactory and
oversimplified image was pre
sented :
A horse, with a Buddha
sitting astride it, approaches
a cliff.
The horse is divided into
two parts — metaphorically
speaking — "the conscious
game-playing part, and the

subconscious will-to-live."
As the horse approaches
the chasm, his "conscious"
tells him that lie can clear
it, and his "unconscious" will
to-live strives to hold him
back, from the possibly d i s
asterous fall. It makes no dif
ference to the Buddha.
At first, one would tend to
take a dim view of Buddha
it lid Ins indifference to such
"ego games.Vet, in th e
words of the student who con
jured up the unage, "One
should always have some of
the Kuridha's view, and be
able to play ego games earn
estly, but also with a certain
detachment, acceptance, a n d
love."
Indeed, he suggested, the
"ecstatic awareness" that
psilocybin induces may be an
answer to existentialism's pre
dicament of how to emerge
from an absurb world.
The existentialist, accord
ing to tlus source, perceives
absurdity in the confronta
tion between man and the ir
rational universe. The ex
panded awareness that liallu
cigens bring can give th e
freedom to see the world in
myriad other ways, not all of
which are absurd.

This rather basic question
has been lost amid the rim
ing 1 controversy over "who
took what where and with
what effect" that has em
broiled the psychology com
munity.
The answer to "Why?" is
more profound than "because
it is there"; rather, it is be
cause the experience can lie,
in the words of one student
who went through the Har
vard experiment, "one of the
most educational and benefi
cial experiences of my life."
The benefit derived from
this transcending effect is
that it can de-emphasize the
ego and can make one more
open to the feelings of others.
To explain the effect of
hailucigens, an arresting it
somewhat unsatisfactory and
oversimplified image was pre
sented :
A horse, with a Buddha
sitting astride it, approaches
a cliff.
The horse is divided into
two parts — metaphorically
speaking — "the conscious
game-playing part, and the

subconscious will-to-live."
As the horse approaches
the chasm, his "conscious"
tells him that lie can clear
it, and his "unconscious" will
to-live strives to hold him
back, from the possibly d i s
asterous fall. It makes no dif
ference to the Buddha.
At first, one would tend to
take a dim view of Buddha
it lid Ins indifference to such
"ego games.Vet, in th e
words of the student who con
jured up the unage, "One
should always have some of
the Kuridha's view, and be
able to play ego games earn
estly, but also with a certain
detachment, acceptance, a n d
love."
Indeed, he suggested, the
"ecstatic awareness" that
psilocybin induces may be an
answer to existentialism's pre
dicament of how to emerge
from an absurb world.
The existentialist, accord
ing to tlus source, perceives
absurdity in the confronta
tion between man and the ir
rational universe. The ex
panded awareness that liallu
cigens bring can give th e
freedom to see the world in
myriad other ways, not all of
which are absurd.
