# Students To Endorse Viet Nam Peace Letter
## 
### 
A letter to President Johnson,
urging immediate United States
action to stop the fighting and to
bring about peace in Viet-Nam
will be presented for endorsement
by the Stanford community, be
ginning today at 8 a.m. on Engi
neering Corner.
Last Sunday's news of a pos
sible expansion of the Vietnamese
war spurred the Peace Caucus
to prepare a petition, opposing
"an intensification of the war"
and repudiating "an expansion of
that war into North Viet-Nam."
THE PETITION calls for a "re
convening of the Geneva Confer

ence of 1954 in order to bring
about an internationally guaran
teed pacification, neutralization,
and democratization of South Viet-
Nam, and to prepare the way for
the reunification of North and
South."
The petition further urges that
"the United States take steps to
ward bring about an immediate
armistice between the South Viet
namese government and the revo
lutionary combatants."
The San Francisco Chronicle
reported Sunday from Saigon
that "a plan to carry the war to
Communist North Viet-Nam
through a campaign of terror,
sabotage, and subversion is un
der consideration here if the com
mand to go ahead hasn't already
been given. . . . "The plan to take
the war to the North goes beyond
the conventional pattern of coun
ter-guerrila warfare. Instead it
contemplates a series of strikes —
by ground, sea, or air—against
industrial targets, oil refineries,
ports ,and major bridges. The
raids would be carried out by
South Viet-Nam with U.S. sup
port."
The New York Times reporter
in Washington said, however, that
a final decision will probably not
be made until Defense Secretary
McNamara visits Viet-Nam in the

next few weeks.
The Peace Caucus believes that
the Administration is currently
re-evaluating policy in Viet-Nam,
arid "that the time for citizen ac
tion is now."
Last week Senator Mike Mans
field urged a thorough re-amina
tion of U.S. policy and considera
tion of recent French proposals
for a neutral zone in Southeast
Asia. Secretary of Defense Rob
ert McNamara announced that the
war would have to be won by the
South Vietnamese themselves and
the U.S. will plan to remove
troops by 1965.

The I'KAfK Caucus fools that
the deteriorating situation in Viol-
Nam has left U.S. military policy
only two choices: to expand the
war, or to negotiate an armistice.
The Caucus stated that niosl re
porters, analysts, and American
personnel in Viet-Nam foresee a
certain defeat for the present
South Viot-Nam-U.S. strategy.
Before the weekend develop
ments, the Caucus had been doing
research and contacting possible
speakers on Viet-Nam, planning
to arouse campus concern a n d
action toward U.S. involvement
in the war.

MISS CHERRY ARNOLD, mom
bor of the Caucus steering com
mit toe, explained that "there is a
disturbing lack of knowledge
about Viet-Nam, both among
otherwise-informed faculty and
the general community. To allevi
ate this, there will be a display of
recent articles in Viet-Nam and a
bibliography posted by the peti
tion tables at Engineering Corner.
Current plans are to keep the
petition available for signatures
through Friday, although the
Peace Caucus emphasized the ur-'
gency of communicating with the j
government immediately.
