## 
### 
Professor Gregersen of the
Scandinavian Seminar Program
will visit the Stanford campus on
Monday, March 2, to interview
students interested in studying
in the three Scandinavian nations
and Finland.

are few since the students are giv

registration. Following intensive
language training at home and
in the seminar abroad, the s t u
dents attend the Scandinavian
Folk High School, and live with
Scandinavian families.
Total cost of the year abroad
is $2,110, which includes an esti
mated $300 in addition to the
registration fee of $1,810.
Interested students should sign
up for interviews in the lIR Tre
sidder Union Loft any afternoon
