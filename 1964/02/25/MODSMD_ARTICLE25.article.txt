six weeks earlier when it lost to
UCLA.
The first half of action last
night was all SC, right from the
opening tip, which was won by
John Block. Block opened th e
scoring with a quick two-pointer.
Tom Dose followed for I he Tribe
with the first two of his 23 points
and the game was off and rolling.
BEFORE TOO long. Dose had
drawn three personals, and coach
Howie Dallmar had to pull him
with 9 minutes left in the half,
and only seven points to the big
man's credit.
With Dose out of ihe Indian
lineup, the attack faltered, and SC
was ahead by seven at 35-28 with
twenty seconds left in the half be
fore Dose, back in there, hit two
quick free throws and Bob Bedell
put one in just before the buzzer.
Dose came out in the second

half with a mind to dump in some
points. He did. Fifteen to he exact,
before he fouled out with about
5 minutes left. His twelve point
spree just after Ihe intermission
was enough to give Stanford a
seven point edge at one point, at
51-44, in the second half. Tom
hit three more before fouling out
with the Tribe ahead 53-4 K.
WITH DOSE out of there, Kent
Hinckley was called on for sev
eral clutch baskets and came
Hi rough in fine fashion.
Bedell also looked good in the
pinch, dominating the backboards
and putting in three clutch free
throws to set up the situation for
Hinckley's charity toss with four
seconds left. Hinckley hit the first
of a one and one try, and SC did
nol have time enough to retaliate.
