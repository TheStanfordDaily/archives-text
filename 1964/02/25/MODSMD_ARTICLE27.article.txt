# Tribe Wrestlers Edged By Bears
## 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
Had last Friday night's wres
tling meet between Stanford and
Cal begun with the 157 pound
division instead of the 123 pound
ers, Stanford would have won
overwhelmingly. But it didn't, and
consequently, S t a n 112 o rd didn't
either, bowing to the Golden
Bears 21-13.
The Indians didn't make a
really too auspicious beginning.
They sacrificed four consecutive
matches, the last three by pins,
and wound up IS points down
with only 20 possible points in
the meet left to be had.. It started
badly and got worse.
FIRST, THE TINS began. 130
pounder Tim Davis was pinned
at 5:30. Then, in ever diminish
ing times, Jerry Smith was
downed in 4:25 in the 137 pound
division, and Carroll Bridgewater,
in his first match as an Indian,
was pinned in 2:20 at 147
pounds.
But things soon brightened for
the Cards, as they even managed
an attempt at a winning streak
of their own in the burlier
weights. Breaking the previous
losing streak was a co-captain,
and this year seemingly unbeat
able, Phil Kendall. The 1(57 pound
Kendall got his second pin in
Ihree meets, as he flattened his
Cal opponent at 4:12.
Next, Joel Kay made an im
pressive return to the Tribe line
up after being out for a few
weeks with an injury, gaining a
well-earned 8-5 decision, and en
hancing Stanford hopes for the
remaining matches of the season
in the 167 pound class.
AT 177 POUNDS, Tom Allen
took only 5:55 to force his oppo
nent's shoulders to the mat. Allen
has lost some close matches this
season to some start wrestlers,
but this time he wasn't to be
denied, dominating his match
throughout.
In the heavyweight division,
Duncan Ross, who had beaten
Don Buehler earlier in the week
Ito appear in this meet, lost a
1 12-5-contest in the final match of
the night.
Trying to get his charges off
the losing streak of the past few
weeks, Coach Bill Leland sends
the squad into the ring again
I this evening, when they will meet
I Santa Clara at Santa Clara.
