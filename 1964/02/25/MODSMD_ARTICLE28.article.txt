# Freshmen Nine Opens Today
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Coach Ray Young's frosh base
ball team will get its first ta ;te
of action this afternoon when it
takes on the Sacred Heart High
School "nine" at 3:15 p.m. This
game, Friday's game against Bal
boa H.S., and Saturday morning's
game against Galileo H.S. will all
take place on the Stanford home
field.
The frosh have been engaging
in workouts since fall quarter,
but have worked out daily only
since the beginning of this quart -
er. As a result their coach is not
certain who his starters will be.
ALTHOUGH HE is unsure of
some positions, Young was de
finite in asserting that Mike Ott
mar would start at. second base
and Dick Swan at shortstop.
Ottmar has been hitting the ball
regularly in intrasquad games,
while in the most recent intra
squad tussle Swan swatted two
home runs and added to more hits
for nine runs batted in.
Other starters for the frosh will
be Marty Erck at first base, Dave
Spence at third, Pat Concannon
in left field, Ron Kuper in center,
and Marc Evans in right.
THE SITUATION behind 1 h e
plate is touch and go as far as
who will be the regular. Coach
Young considers his three receiv
ers to be very closely matched.
Besides starter Bill Boles, there
is Rick Bianchina and Larry Lo
max. Also very close to starting
is utility man Bob Gilmer. Gilmer
can play the infield, the outfield,
or pitch, and he is a respectable
hitter, too.
Slated to start on the mound is
fast-balling Daro Quiring. Ready
to take over should Quiring tire
will be Jim Blaschko. A dark

horse when workouts began,
Blaschke has come on strong to
earn himself the number two po
sition on the pitching staff.
ALSO RKADY for action is fel
low lefthander Steve Hovley. The
remainder of the pitching group
is made up of Dave Net to, Dennis
Kloipfer, Stan Smith, and Tomi
MacDonough.
Infielders on tap for action,
should Iheir coach call, are second
baseman Bruce Lytic, third base
men Marc Branch and Jim Hen
derson, and shortstop Bob Blunt.
Blunt, a recent addition 1o the
squad should be a valuable one,
as he runs under 10 seconds in
the 100-yard dash.
Outfielders on the squad are
Walt Stamm, Terry Bird, and Don
Leydig, all of whom have good
speed and fair arms.

while in the most recent intra
squad tussle Swan swatted two
home runs and added to more hits
for nine runs batted in.
Other starters for the frosh will
be Marty Erck at first base, Dave
Spence at third, Pat Concannon
in left field, Ron Kuper in center,
and Marc Evans in right.
THE SITUATION behind 1 h e
plate is touch and go as far as
who will be the regular. Coach
Young considers his three receiv
ers to be very closely matched.
Besides starter Bill Boles, there
is Rick Bianchina and Larry Lo
max. Also very close to starting
is utility man Bob Gilmer. Gilmer
can play the infield, the outfield,
or pitch, and he is a respectable
hitter, too.
Slated to start on the mound is
fast-balling Daro Quiring. Ready
to take over should Quiring tire
will be Jim Blaschko. A dark

horse when workouts began,
Blaschke has come on strong to
earn himself the number two po
sition on the pitching staff.
ALSO RKADY for action is fel
low lefthander Steve Hovley. The
remainder of the pitching group
is made up of Dave Net to, Dennis
Kloipfer, Stan Smith, and Tomi
MacDonough.
Infielders on tap for action,
should Iheir coach call, are second
baseman Bruce Lytic, third base
men Marc Branch and Jim Hen
derson, and shortstop Bob Blunt.
Blunt, a recent addition 1o the
squad should be a valuable one,
as he runs under 10 seconds in
the 100-yard dash.
Outfielders on the squad are
Walt Stamm, Terry Bird, and Don
Leydig, all of whom have good
speed and fair arms.
Coach Ray Young's frosh base
ball team will get its first ta ;te
of action this afternoon when it
takes on the Sacred Heart High
School "nine" at 3:15 p.m. This
game, Friday's game against Bal
boa H.S., and Saturday morning's
game against Galileo H.S. will all
take place on the Stanford home
field.
The frosh have been engaging
in workouts since fall quarter,
but have worked out daily only
since the beginning of this quart -
er. As a result their coach is not
certain who his starters will be.
ALTHOUGH HE is unsure of
some positions, Young was de
finite in asserting that Mike Ott
mar would start at. second base
and Dick Swan at shortstop.
Ottmar has been hitting the ball
regularly in intrasquad games,
while in the most recent intra
squad tussle Swan swatted two
home runs and added to more hits
for nine runs batted in.
