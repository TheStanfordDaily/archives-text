# BOOK REVIEW
## Emotions Must Be Considered 
### BOB BEYERS Director, University News Service 
Maximum intellectual develop
ment can be achieved only when
educators concern themselves
with the feelings, emotions, and
actions of their students, a Stan
ford expert contends.
Prof. Nevitt Sanford, director
of the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems, develops this
viewpoint in a new book, "College
and Character" (John Wiley &
Sons, 308 pp., $4.95), condensed
from the massive. 1,000-page
study of "The American College,"
which he edited in 1962.
Intellect cannot be considered
apart from personality, he writes.
"JUST AS nothing is truly
learned until it has been inte
grated with the purpose of the in
dividual, so no facts and principles
that have been learned can serve
any worthy purpose unless they
are restrained and guided by
character.
"Intellect without humane feel
ing can be monstrous, whereas
feeling without intelligence is
childish."
Professors often forget the ba
sic unity between knowledge, emo
tion, and action experienced in
their own career, he adds. Yet
both teachers and researchers
know that creative endeavor re
fill ires a deep emotional involve
ment in their intellectual work.
"Why then should students be
viewed as cool and well-oiled ma
chines for storing and retrieving
information?" Sanford asks.

"THERE IS something to be
said for teaching machines, for
they may spare the teacher some
machine-like work, but there is
nothing to be said for a learning
machine."
Students come to college at
widely varied stages of develop
ment, he notes. "A college fresh
man who did not have in high
school the experience of totally
merging himself with a group of
his peers, of uncritically accept
ing the group's goals, and throw
ing himself into the effort toward
their achievement, should be per
mitted to have the experience now
so he can get it out of his sys
tem and move on to a more rea
soned and independent participa
tion in organized activities.
"A graduating senior who has
not been through a phase of ethi
cal relativism must sooner or later
have this educational experience,
for otherwise it is hard to see how
his values can be genuinely his
own."
If colleges accept individual de
velopment as their central goal,
then they should seek maximum
integration of classroom learning
and everyday living, he adds.
"WE MUST FIND ways to bring
the intellectual life of the eollcge
into the establishments where stu
dents live. We must create cam
pus-wide student-faculty commu
nities where the social needs of
students, far from being sup
pressed. are brought into the serv
ice of the intellectual goals of the
college. . . .
"One way to deal with the fra
ternities is to make them scenes
of our strongest efforts to create
intellectual communities. If I
were to undertake on an experi
mental basis the integration of liv
ing and learning, I would just as
soon start with a fraternity as
any other group.
"I would win the cooperation
<if the leadership of the fratern
ity, then invite them to help in
the education of their younger
members and in the turning of
the existing social organization
into a community of teachers and
learners.

"IF FRATERNITIES are ex
pressions of pre-industrialized hu
manity- often abortive, extrem
ist, infantile expressions to be
sure — and students do desire
learning that is integrated with
human and social purposes, then
the. success of this experiment
would put an end to our worries
about fraternities."
As it is, he concludes, the adult
intellectual in American society
"is much too alienated from his
community an d consequently
much too defensive.
"Feeling he is not understood or
appreciated, he mutters contemp
tuously about 'togetherness' and
inks more deeply into isolation
and meanness."
