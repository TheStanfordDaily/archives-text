## Where Rolling Foothills Rise, Up To Power Lines Higher... 
### 
A new verb is becoming part
of the American vocabulary. It
is: to uglily. One is not surprised
when real estate promoters uglify
the landscape. One is not sur
prised when used-car lot operators
uglify the landscape. But one
must bo surprised when the ad
ministration and board of trustees
of a great university like Stan
ford uglify the landscape.
The Board of Trustees, upon the
recommendation of the adminis
tration, made its contribution to
uglification by voting down a
proposal that they give $500,000
to help pay for an underground
power line to the Stanford linear
accelerator.
The resolution of the Trustees
noted that the Board has "always
made it unequivocally clear that
the university cannot justify de
voting its own funds, held in
trust for other educational pur
poses, to a national facility of this
kind." This is an interesting state
ment and deserves examination.
The statement almost seems to
infer that this "national facility"
kind of plopped down on Stanford
by sheer happenstance. The fact
is, of course, that the University
administration has done an in
tensive and expensive ,iob of
lobbying ever since 1958 to get
the linear accelerator to Stan
ford. The accelerator is im
mensely important to Stanford,
because it means that the univer
sity is now attracting some of the
very top physicists in the country
to come here.
The administration stands con
demned for a lack of responsibil
ity to the Stanford community
and the mid-Peninsula residents
for not insisting that the lines be
put undergsound when it signed
the contract with the AEC. Hav
ing shirked the responsibility at
that time, it should now feel ob
liged to pay the amount.
Failure to do so will mean that
some of the loveliest natural pano
rama in Northern California will
be despoiled by five-and-a-half
miles of eye-insulting towers
averaging 120 feet and being 178
feet at the highest.
The above statement by the
board of trustees said that the
$500,000 couldn't bo diverted
from "educational purposes." Yet,
a high member of the administra
tion (who doesn't wish to be di
rectly quoted) has said that the
renovation of biology corner, in
which everything but the shell of
the building was taken out, cost
$700,000 more than if the whole
building had been taken down
and replaced. The reason it was
done this way — a perfectly
proper one — was to preserve the
architectural integrity of the
Quad.
As a recent San Francisco
Chronicle editorial stated, " . . .
Stanford authorities . . . should
look upon this project as an en
terprise in good land planning,
not merely one of high-energy
physics. Anyone giving due
thought to land planning would
insist that the accelerator site
should not be disfigured by a con
spicuous, unslightly power line."
Let us all now join hands and
sing the Stanford hymn:
"Where the rolling foothills
| rise.
"Up to power lines higher . .

• Radical Reform
Editor, The Daily:
I am in full accord with the
statement by Vice Provost Rob
ert J. Wert against radical a n d
revolutionary reform on the cam
pus. Perhaps Stanford should
hire a standing army of five or
six hundred mercenaries (or bet
ter yet, recruit ROTC volunteers,
offering an activity credit) to de
fend Hoover Tower, the post office
and other strategic campus loca
tions in Ihe face of the impending
insurrection.

• CORE Corrections
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to draw your at
tention to an inaccuracy in an
article in the Friday issue of the
Stanford Daily under the heading
"CORE in Action."
The non-discriminatory hiring
pact described in that article was
in fact arrived at as a result of
joint negotiation between certain
stores in the Stanford Shopping
Center and two local branches of
NAACP as well as the local
branch of CORE.
We are commenting upon the
omission of the NAACP groups,
not solely because of the inaccu
racy per se. but also because we
feel it extremely important that
the public be aware of the many
different groups working together
towards a common end in civil
rights.
Indeed, the wide spectrum of
diversified approaches and 1 h e
number of different groups in
volved is one of the most signifi
cant factors in the present day
civil rights movement.

• Persecution Ol Jews
Editor, The Daily:
I am angered by the religious
advertisement entitled "Keep
Your Eyes on Israel," which states
that the persecution of the Jews
is a result of their continuing dis
obedience and turning away from
God.
I don't believe the Jews have
been persecuted because they
don't have faith in Jesus Christ.
If there is a God, He is a God of
brotherly love, and the persecu
tion of the Jews is a result of
man's hatred for those who don't
agree with him. This hatred is
well expressed in this advertise
ment.
