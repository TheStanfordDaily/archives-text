## Apathetics On Campus, Awake! 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
In spite of recent signs that stu
dent government, and as a parti
cular surprise, LASSU may be
rousing itself into some form of
activity, there is still plenty of
hope for the apathetic on campus.
Even if the Legislature's vague,
bumbling attempts to think on
its own and even to think about
an occasional important prob-

j loin are the be
i ginnings of re
sponsible. effec
tive student gov
ernment, and not
merely a phase
whi eh apathy
will soon
weather, there
| is still a plan of

| action open to this University's
; militant majority, the apathetic.
This plan is simple, entails lit
tle or no extra work, and what's
| more important is positively guar
anteed to put Stanford student
government back on the steady.
| sleepy course thai has proven so
popular witli so many.
ALL THE apathetic have to do
is run for LASSU; since they are
J a majority, their election would
: reduce LASSU to a stronghold of
apathy from which any concep
tion of student government being
able to achieve anything could be
effectively squelched.
Who says an apathetic major
; ity can be pushed aside by an ac
! tive minority- that small number
1 of willful students who are right
|at this moment planning to turn
| the student Legislature into a
forum of discussion. It's up to
the many at Stanford to rule the
few.
i Ah. but you are worried about
| the work involved in carrying out
I this plan. It's scarcely work at all.
Simply note for example the ease
wit h which numerous incom
petents win their posts of fame
and fortune in the student govern
ment. If people incapable of ac
tion can be elected to LASSU it
should be no problem at all to
elect people unwilling to act.
★ ★ *
AS FAR AS a campaign goes,
forget it. Most LASSU seats are
uncontested; in fact the majority
are so uncontested that nobody
at all runs for them. LASSU,
which should have around 130
members, at peak strength, now
numbers about 60, although no
body really knows for certain its
exact strength for members are
constantly being expelled for non
attendance.
So all you have to do to make
LASSU is to get nominated, then
merely attend one meeting every
six weeks, to keep your member
ship current. There aren't even
any dues, and for the ambitious
apathetic it looks impressive on
graduate school applications.
Finding a program is of course
somewhat more difficult; even the
current members of t lie Legisla
ture find it harder to decide on a
program than to get elected. In
fact, many have not yet decided
anything.
But here is a suggested pro
gram for those of you even to
apathetic to think — it combines
all the old, traditional standards
of apathy with a new, modern
outlook, for which reason it is
called "modern" or "dynamic"
apathy. It is even practiced by
many current members of
LASSU.
★ ★ ★
FIRST give great care and con
cern to the trivial; second worry
about Ed Shaw's financial reck
lessness; third engage in long,
confusing debate about si m p 1 e
things, and when LASSU threat
ens to discuss an important issue
change the subject, or at least
sidetrack it.
You will find this program will
come easily to you, and, more sur
prising, it will come quite easily
to LASSU. With a solid majority
of the Legislators behind you,
you will find student government
grinding to a slow but certain
halt.
It's quite clear action is needed,
for in a democracy the will of the
majority cannot long be ignored.
LASSU is stretching its mandate
from the students by even meet
ing. and its tendency to discuss
controversial matters is certainly
a violation of the will of the ma
jority.
What I have humbly proposed
is a plan of action to break the
hold this cold, calculating minor-
I ity has on student government.
I It is a plan simple, yet bold, easy,
yet daring, by with the traditional
attitudes, attitudes still held by
i a decisive majority of Stanford
I students, may be restored to the
majestic offices in Tresidder Me-
I morial Union.
