# LUCKY STORES HIT
## CORE Introduces 'Stroll-In' 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN Feature Editor 
The Mid-Peninsular Chapter of
the Congress of Racial Equality
began using a new tactic, the
"stroll-in," in weekend demon
strations against alleged dis
criminatory hiring practices by
Lucky Stores.
The "stroll-in" involves filling
shopping carts, strolling through
the store, and then leaving with
out purchasing a single item.
TARGET OF the stroll-ins were
the Lucky Stores at 3445 Alma
St.and 248 Lytton Avenue. The
demonstrators wore at the Alma
Street store from 10:30 a.m. to 1

p.m. Saturday and at the Lytton
store from 1:15 to 6 p.m. Satur
day.
Jean Libby, a CORE spokesman,
told the I'alo Alto Times th a t
Saturday's demonstrations were
"quite effective." She also said
that the group will switch to
"shop-in" tactics unless a new
agreement is reached this week.
Bruce Cimolini, manager of the
Alma Street branch, agreed that
the demonstrations were effec
tive in the sense that they cut
heavily into business. "It was
pretty rough," he noted.
"SHOP-INS" are now being con
ducted by CORfc] groups in Berke
ley and San Francisco. Demon
strators fill grocery carts, line up
at the checkstand, allow the gro
ceries to be tabulated, and then
discover that they have no money.
Store employees must then return
all the items in the shopping carts
to the shelves.
"It costs about $."50 a night to
clean up all the stuff," Louis Mas
cola. manager of Lucky Store No.
18 in Berkeley, noted. Maseola
and four clerks remained until
2 a.m. each night to restack gro
ceries and count destroyed prop
erty.
A KEKKKLEY city councilman,
John K. Deßonis. took time out
from his meeting's agenda "to
I deplore" CORE pickets, the Daily
Culiforian reported. "Those people
are lucky I am not a merchant,"
j Deßonis said at the council's
weekly meeting. "I would throw
j each one of them out on their fat
faces."
The demonstrations, which be-

I gan last week with picketing,
| grew out of CORE'S charge that
j Lucky Stores have not fulfilled
the terms of a nondiscriminatory
hiring agreement signed several
monhs ago. Lucky officials claim
they have honored the agreement
and charge CORE with seeking
to establish racial quotas as a
basis for hiring.

"shop-in" tactics unless a new
agreement is reached this week.
Bruce Cimolini, manager of the
Alma Street branch, agreed that
the demonstrations were effec
tive in the sense that they cut
heavily into business. "It was
pretty rough," he noted.
"SHOP-INS" are now being con
ducted by CORfc] groups in Berke
ley and San Francisco. Demon
strators fill grocery carts, line up
at the checkstand, allow the gro
ceries to be tabulated, and then
discover that they have no money.
Store employees must then return
all the items in the shopping carts
to the shelves.
"It costs about $."50 a night to
clean up all the stuff," Louis Mas
cola. manager of Lucky Store No.
18 in Berkeley, noted. Maseola
and four clerks remained until
2 a.m. each night to restack gro
ceries and count destroyed prop
erty.
A KEKKKLEY city councilman,
John K. Deßonis. took time out
from his meeting's agenda "to
I deplore" CORE pickets, the Daily
Culiforian reported. "Those people
are lucky I am not a merchant,"
j Deßonis said at the council's
weekly meeting. "I would throw
j each one of them out on their fat
faces."
The demonstrations, which be-

I gan last week with picketing,
| grew out of CORE'S charge that
j Lucky Stores have not fulfilled
the terms of a nondiscriminatory
hiring agreement signed several
monhs ago. Lucky officials claim
they have honored the agreement
and charge CORE with seeking
to establish racial quotas as a
basis for hiring.
The Mid-Peninsular Chapter of
the Congress of Racial Equality
began using a new tactic, the
"stroll-in," in weekend demon
strations against alleged dis
criminatory hiring practices by
Lucky Stores.
The "stroll-in" involves filling
shopping carts, strolling through
the store, and then leaving with
out purchasing a single item.
TARGET OF the stroll-ins were
the Lucky Stores at 3445 Alma
St.and 248 Lytton Avenue. The
demonstrators wore at the Alma
Street store from 10:30 a.m. to 1

p.m. Saturday and at the Lytton
store from 1:15 to 6 p.m. Satur
day.
Jean Libby, a CORE spokesman,
told the I'alo Alto Times th a t
Saturday's demonstrations were
"quite effective." She also said
that the group will switch to
"shop-in" tactics unless a new
agreement is reached this week.
