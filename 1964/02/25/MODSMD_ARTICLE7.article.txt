# AEC Given New Estimate
## 
### 
The Save Our Skyline commit
tee yesterday presented a study
estimating the cost of condemna
tion proceedings and severance
damages on the proposed power
lines righl of way lands at be
tween $750,000 and $1,300,000. A
previous Pacific Gas and Electric
estimate had placed the cost at
$137,000.
The study was made by Hare,
Brewer, & Kelley, Inc., a Palo
Alio property development firm.
It was presented to representa
tives of PG&E, Stanford, and the
Atomic Energy Commission at a
conference in the SLAC center
yesterday.
The report staled that the
PG&E figure must be "a pro
found miscalculation," because it
failed to take into consideration
the severence damages. These
damages would result from the
devaluation of nearby property
by the powerline towers.
