# New Open House Code Approved By Sterling
## But IHC Seeks More Freedom 
### MICHAEL ROSTER 
Prosiclenl Sterling has signed
a new sot of regulations limiting
open houses on campus. In sep
arate action the Inter-House
Council has passed a resolution
seeking more freedom in con
ducting open houses.
The new regulations were ef
fected following the recommenda
tions of a student-faculty sub-com
mittee of the Student Affairs and
Services Committee. According to
Dean H. Donald Winbigler, the
new regulations are as follows-'
"Pending study, men's groups
(fraternity and residence) may
have registered open houses on
Wednesday and Friday evenings
between 7 and 11 p.m.; and worn
nen may have registered open
houses on Wednesday evenings
between 7 and 11 p.m. and on
Sunday between noon and 5 p.m.
"DOORS MUST not be locked.
Each house may decide whether
or not it wishes to hold an open
house on either or both of the
days designated above. It may
also decide its own hours within
those given above; i.e., certain
houses may hold open houses be
tween 7:30 and 10:30."
The sub-committee recommend
ed the specific times to alleviate
confusion that has resulted in the
past, The days were chosen as
being already preferred by many
houses.
Before the new rules were put
into effect, the Inter-House Coun
cil had passed a resolution which
stated that "the open house pol
icy of the individual residences on
campus should not be under such
constraint" as these rules would
impose.
THE RESOLUTION went on to
say that "in the total absence of
co-educaional dormitories, open
houses constitute the nearest
thing to a normal situation in
which men and women can meet
and talk.
"Dates are generally strained
and unnatural, and parties must
often resort to liquor as a social
lubricant. But an open house can
provide the opportunity to meet
in a familiar and natural place
where one truly feels at ease.
"For these reasons, the Inter-
House Council feels that the num
ber of open houses should be in
creased to at least three per
week, the particular nights to be
left to the discretion of Ihe in
dividual residents. . . . Decision
and enforcements pertaining to
open houses should be left to liv
ing groups themselves."
THE SUB-COMMITTEE on
open houses has been meeting
since spring quarter last year.
Some major complaints of open
houses in the past, said Mrs.
Judith Hannemann, Social Coun
selor in the deans of students of
fices, have been that students
often didn't know when they
could have study dates in their
rooms. This would often prove
both embarassing and even dam
aging.
Rather than eliminate open
houses entirely, it was more ad
visable to clarify regulations.
According to Dean Winbigler.
open houses were instituted four
years ago on his recommendation.
Times were specified then, but
administration of tlu? initial test
allowed some departures. After
having reviewed the policy, the
new changes were advised.
FURTHER DISCUSSION will
be held by the subcommittee this
week in regard to Crothot's and
Crolhers Memorial halls for grad
uate students.

The sub-committee recommend
ed the specific times to alleviate
confusion that has resulted in the
past, The days were chosen as
being already preferred by many
houses.
Before the new rules were put
into effect, the Inter-House Coun
cil had passed a resolution which
stated that "the open house pol
icy of the individual residences on
campus should not be under such
constraint" as these rules would
impose.
THE RESOLUTION went on to
say that "in the total absence of
co-educaional dormitories, open
houses constitute the nearest
thing to a normal situation in
which men and women can meet
and talk.
"Dates are generally strained
and unnatural, and parties must
often resort to liquor as a social
lubricant. But an open house can
provide the opportunity to meet
in a familiar and natural place
where one truly feels at ease.
"For these reasons, the Inter-
House Council feels that the num
ber of open houses should be in
creased to at least three per
week, the particular nights to be
left to the discretion of Ihe in
dividual residents. . . . Decision
and enforcements pertaining to
open houses should be left to liv
ing groups themselves."
THE SUB-COMMITTEE on
open houses has been meeting
since spring quarter last year.
Some major complaints of open
houses in the past, said Mrs.
Judith Hannemann, Social Coun
selor in the deans of students of
fices, have been that students
often didn't know when they
could have study dates in their
rooms. This would often prove
both embarassing and even dam
aging.
Rather than eliminate open
houses entirely, it was more ad
visable to clarify regulations.
According to Dean Winbigler.
open houses were instituted four
years ago on his recommendation.
Times were specified then, but
administration of tlu? initial test
allowed some departures. After
having reviewed the policy, the
new changes were advised.
FURTHER DISCUSSION will
be held by the subcommittee this
week in regard to Crothot's and
Crolhers Memorial halls for grad
uate students.

ducting open houses.
The new regulations were ef
fected following the recommenda
tions of a student-faculty sub-com
mittee of the Student Affairs and
Services Committee. According to

new regulations are as follows-'
"Pending study, men's groups
(fraternity and residence) may

"DOORS MUST not be locked.
Each house may decide whether
or not it wishes to hold an open
house on either or both of the
days designated above. It may
also decide its own hours within
those given above; i.e., certain
houses may hold open houses be
tween 7:30 and 10:30."
