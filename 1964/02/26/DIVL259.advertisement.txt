JERUSALEM:
FUTURE CAPITAL CITY
OF THE WORLD
The ancient city called Jerusalem was written about in manuscripts dating as
far back as the second millenium before Christ. Probably more wars have been
fought in and around Jerusalem than anywhere else on earth. Only when we turn
to Biblical prophecy do we sec that Jerusalem will one day be the "city of peace"
which the Hebrew and Assyrian origins of this word imply.
In Scripture Jerusalem is also called Zion (after the name of the city's
ancient citadel) and the "City of David" (after the great Jewish King and Psalm
ist -see II Samuel). In Matthew reference is made to Jerusalem as the city of
a "great King," and indeed it is, for the city is associated with the King born
of the earthly lineage of David—Jesus Christ, the Word of God made flesh.
I Jerusalem will one day be the capital city of the world and the headquarters
of Christ, the King, during His earthly reign.

"The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Juda and Jerusalem.
I And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house
I shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the
I hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come
I ye and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of
Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out
j of Zion shall go forth the law, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And
I he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people: and they shall
beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall
I not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." Isaiah
During the present age of Messiah's absence, Jerusalem is a sign to the world
I that Gentile times are unfulfilled. As long as the city is under the control of
foreign powers (those who are not of Jewish origin), the Gentile nations will
I dominate the world. When the Jews occupy the entire city, the times of the
| Gentiles will end,
I "And they (the Jews) shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles
until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled." Luke (21:24).
The city of Jerusalem has been under foreign domination almost continuously
since Nebuchadnezzar plundered it in 587 B.C. At the present time the Jews have
access to only the outskirts and a small portion of the old city; the great historic
sites, including the site where the temple once stood, are controlled by the Arabs.
The Jerusalem of the future will have a specific religious character:
"... Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of
hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the I>ord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts;
In those days it shall come to pass that ten men shall take hold out of all lan
guages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew,
saying, we will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you." (Zech.
I 8:22-23).
Exciting days lie ahead for Jerusalem. The Jews will one day make a treaty
with a "foreign prince," and for a space of three and a half years will regain
I control of Jerusalem, re-establishing their Temple (Dan. 9:25-27). The prince
I will break the agreement, and the following three and one half years will be a
I time of great testing and trial for the Jews. During this period known as the
I "Great Tribulation," the wrath of God will be poured out on an unbelieving and
idolatrous world. Many people who arc faithful to Jesus Christ will be martyred.
Nations will rise against the Jews and seek to destroy the ancient city of David.
I But right on schedule and faithful to His Holy Word, the Lord Jesus Christ will
return to establish, with headquarters in Jerusalem, the Kingdom Age of "peace
on earth, goodwill to men."
How do you stand today in regard to this Jesus Christ, born King of the
Jews, and sin-bearer for the entire world. Do you know Him personally? You
can, for He is alive today and very much wants to be your Saviour. Christianity
is not just a philosophy or a set of ideas yoti are asked to adopt. Christianity is
belief and trusting in Jesus Christ who will one day return to rule the nations in
justice and righteousness from Jerusalem. As two former sinners who have ex
perienced the love, forgiveness, and new life which Jesus gives to all who helieve
in Him, we are most anxious that you should know Him too. If we can be of any
help to you, write:
