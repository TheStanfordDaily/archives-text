### 
Former President H e r be r t
Hoover, a member of Stanford's
first graduating class, has suf
fered a "serious setback" in
health, a spokesman said today.
A hospital room has been re
served for the 89-year-old former
chief executive, who resides in
the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New
York.
THE FAMILY of the thirty-first
president said last June that his
strength had been ebbing from
anemia caused by intestinal bleed
ing. He had undergone surgery
the previous August at Columbia
Presbyterian Medical Center for
removal of a cancerous tumor of
the intestinal tract.
Today doctor described his con
dition as "fairly satisfactory."
They said:
"The present illness is due to
bleeding from the right kidney,
S probably secondary to a kidney
stone. The clinical picture has
| been complicated by a respiratory
1 infection."
THE STATEMENT issued by
the doctors said the former presi
dent has been bed-ridden at hi s
hotel suite with fever for the past
48 hours.
"Until this illness, his condition
had been good for a person of
nearly 90," they said.
Hoover was born in West
Branch, lowa, in 187 1, and was
graduated from Stanford in 1595
with a degree in Mining Engineer
ing.
In 1920 he was seriously men
tioned as a possibility for the
Democratic presidential nomina
tion.
SINCE RETIKINCi from the
presidency in 1933, Hoover has
served in various positions. One
of the most important was as head
of the Hoover Commission, a job
to which President Truman an-

pointed him in 1947 with the task
of re-organizing the Executive
Branch of the government.
Hoover has been relatively in
active in recent months. One of
his last public appearances was at
a reception in May honoring Maj.
Gordon Cooper Jr., the astronaut,
for his 22-orbit flight.
