# Petitions Hit Power Lines
## 
### 
The Committee on Green
Foothills is distributing peti
tions to fraternities and Uni
versity residences urging; the
Atomic Energy Commission
to appropriate extra funds to
move underground the power
lines to tlie Stanford Linear
Accelerator.
The Green Foothills group
hopes to obtain 10,000 signa
tures in support of the sub
surface lines.
The petitions are not legal
documents, bill only register
support *d the community
and indicate "a regional con
cern to the A.E.C., said the
Committee.
Groups involved in th e
power line dispute met .Mon
day evening', but I'aul Me-
Closkey, attorney represent
ing; the Save Our Skylines
Committee, stated that t li e
A.E.C. has not agreed to pay
more than $220,000 of the
$3.0 million cost of an under
ground line.
Pacific Gas and Electric
has appropriated $1,012,000,
for the project, and the near
by community of Woodside
voted last week to quadruple
its taxes to raise $150,000.
The A.B.C. has set March
U as the deadline for a deci
sion to start constructing"
either an overhead line or a
completely financed under
ground line.
