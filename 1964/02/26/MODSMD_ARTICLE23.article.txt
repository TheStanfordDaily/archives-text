## Louisville Lip Licks Liston 
### PETER EAKLAND 
Cassius Clay is the king. The
ringside election was a tie, but
Cassius Clay, throwing punches

| against his awesome adversary,
| Sonny Liston, with confidence
and precision and surely not with
caution, won by a shoulder.
At the end of the sixth round,
the referee stopped the fighl he
cause of a shoulder separation
suffered by the champion in the
first round. The crowd booed, of
course, hut not because they had
not witnessed an exciting, first
class fight, which they had, hut
because Clay hadn't yet fully
proved his superiority over ihe
strong, experienced Liston in the
close fight. The official scoring
was dead even at this point: one
57-57 card, and a 58-56 for each
fighter.
The fight was one of the great
est upsets in the chronicles of
boxing. Vegas had Liston by 7-1
odds. Only three boxers previous
ly had ever advanced to the pin
nacle of the boxing world without
a loss, none with as few boxing
(not poetic) credentials as Clay.
C'assius was a worthy chal
lenger every moment he was in
the ring, much to everyone's sur
prise.
Liston began stalking the chal
lenger from the opening bell. He
had said he wanted a quick fight
and the early moments clearly
showed his intention. Clay only
danced away from his opponent
and bobbed and weaved when he
came in close.
Clay soon took the offensive.
An offense consisting of jabs to
the head not only had Clay sur
viving at the end of the first
round (something Patters on
never did) but won it for him.
Fighting, not the way experts
had said he must to win but his
own reckless, hands down method
Clay somehow didn't give Liston
the opening that had proved
Floyd Patterson's demise twice.
Clay taunted and harassed the
champion.
At- the end of the first round,
incensed by his initial showing,
Liston didn't, bother to sit down.
In the second round, Liston
scored on long jabs. The middle
of the round found Clay against
the ropes with Liston doing dam
age to the rib section with both
hands.
Clay shot two jabs that hit the
mark to start the third. Next fir
ing a two-handed volley close
range at Liston, Clay hurt the
champion and opened a cut un
der his left eye.| Liston recovered
and began to batter with hard
lefts to the jaw and rights to the
body. Moving nimbly, Clay slipped
in some hard lefts to the cut,
getting wider at every impact.
The attack had taken the
j breath out of the Louisville Lip,
i and Liston began his stalking
game with some success. He con
nected with a good right upper
cut, soon after landed another
right to the jaw and followed
i with stiff left jabs to the head,
j The challenger's confidence
rose. In the fourth, he used his

speed tu advantage and to some
extent abandoned his retreating
tactics to slug it out with his
heavier, but bleeding opponent.
Clay landed mostly jabs in the
round. Liston countered with
some of his own hut none seemed
to bother Clay, not even a stiff
right and left to the jaw. Even
when stalked to a corner, Cas
sius got out without, much
trouble.
Coining out for tho fifth round,
Clay apparently had something
in his eye. He blinked often try
ing to regain his sight while hold
ing up is left hand to ward off
the aggressor. And Liston was
the aggressor. lie smashed
punches to the body. Clay back
pedalled, but Liston kept stalking
and landed a left hook and a
right to the jaw. The challenger
was in danger, but even in danger
didn't lose his composure and
kept out of Liston's reach until
recovering his eyesight.

Adrenalin flowing, Clay was
fighting bug-eyed after the tille
he had said so often he would
gel and didn't appear hurt. Liston
was in danger but even in danger
j eye completely elosod. He was
[sluggish and his liming was off
a bit. But he was nol seriously
i hurt and was even on points.
The sixth was all Clay. Moving
'quiekly in and out of range, he
| concentrated on the head of Lis
ton with right and left combina
tions. The round ended as Clay
scored on four straight left jabs
to the face of Liston. Liston re
turned to his corner, sat on his
chair, and never moved from that
position until ihe fight was over.
Willie Reddish, Liston's trainer,
waved his hands and the doctor
relayed the cause of the fight's
finish.
Cassius hadn't really "upset the
world" as he claimed, but he had
proved the experts wrong and
had proved his worth as a lighter.

ing a two-handed volley close
range at Liston, Clay hurt the
champion and opened a cut un
der his left eye.| Liston recovered
and began to batter with hard
lefts to the jaw and rights to the
body. Moving nimbly, Clay slipped
in some hard lefts to the cut,
getting wider at every impact.
The attack had taken the
j breath out of the Louisville Lip,
i and Liston began his stalking
game with some success. He con
nected with a good right upper
cut, soon after landed another
right to the jaw and followed
i with stiff left jabs to the head,
j The challenger's confidence
rose. In the fourth, he used his

speed tu advantage and to some
extent abandoned his retreating
tactics to slug it out with his
heavier, but bleeding opponent.
Clay landed mostly jabs in the
round. Liston countered with
some of his own hut none seemed
to bother Clay, not even a stiff
right and left to the jaw. Even
when stalked to a corner, Cas
sius got out without, much
trouble.
Coining out for tho fifth round,
Clay apparently had something
in his eye. He blinked often try
ing to regain his sight while hold
ing up is left hand to ward off
the aggressor. And Liston was
the aggressor. lie smashed
punches to the body. Clay back
pedalled, but Liston kept stalking
and landed a left hook and a
right to the jaw. The challenger
was in danger, but even in danger
didn't lose his composure and
kept out of Liston's reach until
recovering his eyesight.

Adrenalin flowing, Clay was
fighting bug-eyed after the tille
he had said so often he would
gel and didn't appear hurt. Liston
was in danger but even in danger
j eye completely elosod. He was
[sluggish and his liming was off
a bit. But he was nol seriously
i hurt and was even on points.
The sixth was all Clay. Moving
'quiekly in and out of range, he
| concentrated on the head of Lis
ton with right and left combina
tions. The round ended as Clay
scored on four straight left jabs
to the face of Liston. Liston re
turned to his corner, sat on his
chair, and never moved from that
position until ihe fight was over.
Willie Reddish, Liston's trainer,
waved his hands and the doctor
relayed the cause of the fight's
finish.
Cassius hadn't really "upset the
world" as he claimed, but he had
proved the experts wrong and
had proved his worth as a lighter.
Cassius Clay is the king. The
ringside election was a tie, but
Cassius Clay, throwing punches

| against his awesome adversary,
| Sonny Liston, with confidence
and precision and surely not with
caution, won by a shoulder.
At the end of the sixth round,
the referee stopped the fighl he
cause of a shoulder separation
suffered by the champion in the
first round. The crowd booed, of
course, hut not because they had
not witnessed an exciting, first
class fight, which they had, hut
because Clay hadn't yet fully
proved his superiority over ihe
strong, experienced Liston in the
close fight. The official scoring
was dead even at this point: one
57-57 card, and a 58-56 for each
fighter.
The fight was one of the great
est upsets in the chronicles of
boxing. Vegas had Liston by 7-1
odds. Only three boxers previous
ly had ever advanced to the pin
nacle of the boxing world without
a loss, none with as few boxing
(not poetic) credentials as Clay.
C'assius was a worthy chal
lenger every moment he was in
the ring, much to everyone's sur
prise.
Liston began stalking the chal
lenger from the opening bell. He
had said he wanted a quick fight
and the early moments clearly
showed his intention. Clay only
danced away from his opponent
and bobbed and weaved when he
came in close.
Clay soon took the offensive.
An offense consisting of jabs to
the head not only had Clay sur
viving at the end of the first
round (something Patters on
never did) but won it for him.
Fighting, not the way experts
had said he must to win but his
own reckless, hands down method
Clay somehow didn't give Liston
the opening that had proved
Floyd Patterson's demise twice.
Clay taunted and harassed the
champion.
At- the end of the first round,
incensed by his initial showing,
Liston didn't, bother to sit down.
In the second round, Liston
scored on long jabs. The middle
of the round found Clay against
the ropes with Liston doing dam
age to the rib section with both
hands.

Willie Reddish, Liston's trainer,
waved his hands and the doctor
relayed the cause of the fight's
finish.
Cassius hadn't really "upset the
world" as he claimed, but he had
proved the experts wrong and
had proved his worth as a lighter.
Cassius Clay is the king. The
ringside election was a tie, but
Cassius Clay, throwing punches

| against his awesome adversary,
| Sonny Liston, with confidence
and precision and surely not with
caution, won by a shoulder.
At the end of the sixth round,
the referee stopped the fighl he
cause of a shoulder separation
suffered by the champion in the
first round. The crowd booed, of
course, hut not because they had
not witnessed an exciting, first
class fight, which they had, hut
because Clay hadn't yet fully
proved his superiority over ihe
strong, experienced Liston in the
close fight. The official scoring
was dead even at this point: one
57-57 card, and a 58-56 for each
fighter.
The fight was one of the great
est upsets in the chronicles of
boxing. Vegas had Liston by 7-1
odds. Only three boxers previous
ly had ever advanced to the pin
nacle of the boxing world without
a loss, none with as few boxing
(not poetic) credentials as Clay.
C'assius was a worthy chal
lenger every moment he was in
the ring, much to everyone's sur
prise.
Liston began stalking the chal
lenger from the opening bell. He
had said he wanted a quick fight
and the early moments clearly
showed his intention. Clay only
danced away from his opponent
and bobbed and weaved when he
came in close.
Clay soon took the offensive.
An offense consisting of jabs to
the head not only had Clay sur
viving at the end of the first
round (something Patters on
never did) but won it for him.
Fighting, not the way experts
had said he must to win but his
own reckless, hands down method
Clay somehow didn't give Liston
the opening that had proved
Floyd Patterson's demise twice.
Clay taunted and harassed the
champion.
At- the end of the first round,
incensed by his initial showing,
Liston didn't, bother to sit down.
In the second round, Liston
scored on long jabs. The middle
of the round found Clay against
the ropes with Liston doing dam
age to the rib section with both
hands.
Clay shot two jabs that hit the
mark to start the third. Next fir
ing a two-handed volley close
range at Liston, Clay hurt the
champion and opened a cut un
der his left eye.| Liston recovered
and began to batter with hard
lefts to the jaw and rights to the
body. Moving nimbly, Clay slipped
in some hard lefts to the cut,
getting wider at every impact.
The attack had taken the
j breath out of the Louisville Lip,
i and Liston began his stalking
game with some success. He con
nected with a good right upper
cut, soon after landed another
right to the jaw and followed
i with stiff left jabs to the head,
j The challenger's confidence
rose. In the fourth, he used his

speed tu advantage and to some
extent abandoned his retreating
tactics to slug it out with his
heavier, but bleeding opponent.
Clay landed mostly jabs in the
round. Liston countered with
some of his own hut none seemed
to bother Clay, not even a stiff
right and left to the jaw. Even
when stalked to a corner, Cas
sius got out without, much
trouble.
Coining out for tho fifth round,
Clay apparently had something
in his eye. He blinked often try
ing to regain his sight while hold
ing up is left hand to ward off
the aggressor. And Liston was
the aggressor. lie smashed
punches to the body. Clay back
pedalled, but Liston kept stalking
and landed a left hook and a
right to the jaw. The challenger
was in danger, but even in danger
didn't lose his composure and
kept out of Liston's reach until
recovering his eyesight.

Adrenalin flowing, Clay was
fighting bug-eyed after the tille
he had said so often he would
gel and didn't appear hurt. Liston
was in danger but even in danger
j eye completely elosod. He was
[sluggish and his liming was off
a bit. But he was nol seriously
i hurt and was even on points.
The sixth was all Clay. Moving
'quiekly in and out of range, he
| concentrated on the head of Lis
ton with right and left combina
tions. The round ended as Clay
scored on four straight left jabs
to the face of Liston. Liston re
turned to his corner, sat on his
chair, and never moved from that
position until ihe fight was over.
