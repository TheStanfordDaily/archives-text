# Braves Hit High Mark, Then Lose
## 
### 
The Stanford Braves recorded
their highest and lowest point pro
duction totals in a pair of week
end tilts.
Saturday afternoon the Braves
set the stage for what was to be
a high-scoring evening of basket
ball by shreading the nets for a
total of 103 points, in a 103-60 win
over Moffett Field. Things were
quite different Monday as the
California Blues, five point losers
to Stanford two weeks ago,
romped to a 61-49 decision at Har
mon Gym.
Monday's loss at Cal marked
the second straight road defeat for
the Braves. In three away-from
home contests, the Braves man
aged but one win, that begin a
79-76 decision at Moffett Field.
Once again it was big Bob Evans
leading the way. The 6-5 center
got Stanford off on the right
track Saturday by pouring in 20
points on nine field goals and two
free throws. Karl YVustrack, who
also starred in the Cal contest,
left fans wondering as to the rea
son why he has spent so much
time on the bench this season. The
6-4 forward was red-hot against
Moffett Field, fil ing in eight field
goals in less than 10 minutes.
Stanford toyed with the Flyers
for the first few minutes of the
game, but had a substantial 49-2N
lead when the halftime buzzer
sounded. In the final 20 minutes
the Braves continued to pour it
on and scored 60 points.
Bill Farley 12. and Chris Babbs
11, also hit in double figures.
Other J.V. scorers were Francisco
Newman 9. Dave Raymond S.
Horm Weller and Bruce Kebric
