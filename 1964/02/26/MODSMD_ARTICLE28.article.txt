## Where Did You Go? Out. What Did You Do? Nothing 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
Stanford's latest contribution to the com
munal memorabilia of America — the AWS
Etiquette Book — is apparently predicated
on the proposition that, in manners and
morals, pragmatism pays off.
It. is difficult to conceive from whence
the authors have derived this profundity
but Polonius and the Poor Richard's Al
manac are two likely contenders. In any
case, "Etiquette, A Review, with special
reference to the Stanford campus" reads
like a sophisticated addendum to "Twixt
Twelve and Twenty."
In general, AWS has adopted what might
be termed the 'Aunt Maude's Finishing
School" approach. And, as the old line goes.
'Aunt Maude's girls are really finished."

Against all odds, this preposterous postur
ing is maintained to the bitter end.
A sense of dire solemnity permeates each
crisis of the banquet table and receiving
line. An olive pit, skillfully removed from
the oral cavity, becomes a tiling of beauty:
It is Emily Post, apotheosized on every
page.
OF COURSE, all this is not without a
certain undeniable snob appeal, and to at
least fully comprehend (he intricacies of
devouring a steamed clam is somehow ele
vating. But to one who abhors Victorian
morals quite as much as Victorian archi
tecture. the whole structure seems too pon
derously pompous to bear.
In addition, the entire treatise seems to
be informed by a moral chicanery of t ho
most appalling sort. In this context, one

chapter in particular comes to mind. It is
titillatingly entitled "Parking and Petting."
The authors' profound comments on this
delicate subject merit quotation:
"Behavior is concerned with morals as
well as manners and thus becomes a per
sonal problem. Every woman is responsible
for determining her standards of conduct.
The sophisticated woman keeps her values
high. A woman's most powerful weapon is
a definite 'no.' A real man will respect it."
THE EMPHASIS HERE, of course, is
on the words "sophisticated" and "real man"
the kind of viril snob appeal which would
do Canon Green himself proud. But, lest
these subtle suggestions be ignored, the
authors feel called upon to drive the point
home with a thrust at the practical advan
tages of morality.

"A man's conquest is soon public knowl
edge," the authors note with a barely con
cealed smirk, "and though other men may
call her for dates, the girl will soon find
that she is not invited to public places or
to the parties where everyone else goes.
Her reputation, as well as the reputation of
of her living group, is damaged." Needless
to say, the emphasis is mine.
Not all of the Etiquette book is appal
ling: some of it's merely ludicrous. For
example, one line in the section on liquor
reads, "Thus an intoxicated woman is re
lieved of responses which she has learned.
. . . hence after an evening of drinking she
may participate more fully in lovemaking
than would be reasonably expected." One
cannot help but wonder what constitutes
the authors' criterion for "reasonable expec

tation."
In addition to the juicy potential of some
of the longer sections, many one-liners af
ford an opportunity for a smile:
"To spread germs around your dormi
tory is inconsiderate. . . "The blind date
is like a lottery. . . "Don't wonder wildly
what you can talk about to a professor. Ho
may be world-famous in his field, but out
side the classroom, he may like to laugh
and talk about very ordinary things. . .
and on and on, ad nauseum.
Amid this mountain of noxious trivia,
there is one telling line: "The kind, consid
erate and sensible thing in the simplest way
possible is almost surely the correct thing."
Assuming that the authors really believe
their own dictum, one is forced to wonder
why they bothered to write the book at all.
