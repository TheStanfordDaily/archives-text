## Conscience, Reason Demand U.S. Act To End Viet-Nam War 
### Richard Such Peace Caucus Member 
The war in South Viet-Nam, if
continued, cannot result favor
ably for the United States.
By failing to carry out needed
reforms and by its eight years of
totalitarian rule, the Diem dic
tatorship thoroughly alienated
the Vietnamese people. That
alienation cannot be overcome by
the new military leaders, who
pursue essentially the same policy
as Diem and who are regarded by
the people as "neo-colonialist"
lackeys.
By its upholding of Diem's re
pressive rule, by its authorship of
the euphemistically called "strate
gic hamlet" program of forcibly
removing nearly 10 million people
from their lands and concentrat
ing them in stockades, by its pro
vision of the government troops
with the napalm that is often used
to incinerate villages thought to
harbor rebels and with the whole
array of weaponry that is em
ployed against the guerrilla and
ordinary man alike -by all this
the United States has utterly dis
credited itself in the eyes of the
Vietnamese.

It has become an axiom of mod
ern revolutionary warfare that
civilian support is the essential
element of successful guerrilla or
counter-guerilla operations. The
Viet-Cong has the support of
many Vietnamese —that support
cannot soon be regained by
Diem's successors, supported by
theU.S.
The government troops find
themselves defending a political
order which differs little in its
effect on the common man 112 r o m
the example of the equally un
bearable totalitarian state in
North Viet-Nam.
The South Vietnamese forces
suffer a demoralization for which
no remedy is apparent. They can
ho expected to do no more than
delay the victory of the ever more
powerful and daring revolution
aries. And the slaughter will con
tinue, with more than 20,000
deaths on each side each year,
and the rate increasing.
Last Sunday's New York Times
reported the U.S. many soon de
cide to carry the war into North
Viet-Nam. The motives for such
an action are obscure they would
not be so if North Viet-Nam were
invading the South.
Infiltrators from the North, the
majority of native South Vietna
mese, do in fact enter South Viet-
Nam. but they have numbered
only about 10 per cent of the guer
rillas.

The civil war began well before
any assistance at all was received
from the North. The guerrillas do
not depend on the North for train
ing or supplies, having captured
a significant portion of their
weapons from defeated govern
ment troops.
So there seems to be no excuse
for an invasion of North Viet-
Nam, save perhaps the hope of
magically extracting ourselves
from the dilemma that has em
erged in the South.
11 would be miraculous indeed
if an attack on the North did not
bring about the consequences of
a similar attack on North Korea:
the entrance of the Chinese into
the war with the grave risk of
general warfare.
The United States is faced with
several alternative courses: it can
continue in South Viet-Nam as at
present and probably have eventu
ally to evacuate the country to
make room for a Communist re
gime. witnessing in the process
the loss of many thousands of
Vietnamese lives; it can actively
intervene to accelerate the war in
South Viet-Nam, enlarging it to
truly genocidal proportions, or can
invade North Viet-Nam with, at
besl, Korean-type consequences;
it can negotiate for peace.
This last alternative is clearly
preferable and appears feasible.
Communist leaders in North Viet-
Nam and China have expressed
their willingness to guarantee
such a peace if certain entirely
reasonably conditions are met.
The interests of all parties could
be served by a neutral South Viet-
Nam, free of any foreign interfer
ence and with a democratically
elected government. Both Commu
nist and Western nations could
agree that an armistice is prefer
able to a prolongation or expan
sion of the conflict.

North Viet-Nam will respond fa
vorably to the chance of an open
ing to the West in order to escape
the long-resented influence of
China. The guerrilla forces would
be allowed to pursue their reforms j
in the electoral process. Effective
international control of a South i
Vietnamese armistice and neutral- j
ization is possible.
The Geneva Conference of 1954,
because it includes China an d !
North Viet-Nam, is the logical I
medium for negotiations. A larger
war can be avoided and peace can i
be brought to the long-suffering
people of Viet-Nam, and the way |
prepared for their reunification. '
But for that, the time is drawing I
short.
