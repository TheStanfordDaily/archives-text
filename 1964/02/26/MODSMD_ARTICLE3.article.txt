# Satellite Weapons Not Needed

### JIM BRISCOE 
Satellite bombers are techni
cally feasible today, but in all
cases ground bombing systems
could do I lie same job better and
more cheaply.
This was one of the points made
by Dr. Albert Hibbs in his speech
on "Space Technology, The Threat
and the Promise" last night. Dr.
Hibbs is director of the Arms
Control group working at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory at Pasa
dena.
Till; "PROMISE" of space tech
nology cited by Hibbs was th c
possibility of a treaty between the
United States and Russia pro
hibiting nuclear weapons in space.
However Dr. Hibbs stated he could
not classify his feelings as opti
mistic on this possibility.
One of the chief disadvantages
of a satellite bomber system is
its relative unreliability, Hibbs
told his audience.
IN REGARDS to treaties, Dr.
Hibbs expressed the belief that
even treaties which did not pro
vide for inspection might still be
advantageous to the U.S. He em
phasized that while the treaty
would have little military value
since space-launched weapons
seem impractical at present, it
never the less might be an im
portant step towards further dis
armament negotiations.
