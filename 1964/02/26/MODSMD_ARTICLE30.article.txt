# Housing Discrimination Statement Corrected
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I have just received my copy
of the special supplement to
the Daily concerned with East
Palo Alto and minority prob
lems. Somewhat belatedly, I
wish to correct a statement
(misquoting me?) in the ar
ticle on discrimination in hous
ing.
It is stated that "in most
cases the problem is not created
by the owners of the apart
ments, but rather by the man
agers. . . ." Not so! Quite often
(as in the case cited), a man
ager will accept a deposit from
a Negro, only to have the own
er instruct him to return it. On
the other hand. I can recall no
case in which an owner re
versed a manager's act of dis
crimination except under
threat of legal action.
It is the owner, typically an
older person of provincial back
ground, who sees his security
threatened. Anyone who h a s
listened to recent audience par
ticipation programs on th e
radio has witnessed their hy
steria. Such people are incap
able of divining the more re
laxed attitudes of the busy
young adults who form the
bulk of their tenants.
A simple but enormously
helpful thing that all of you
who read this letter could do,
now or whenever you become
an apartment dweller, is to let
owner and manager know that
you couldn't care less (i.e.,
would not move out) if a Ne
gro were to move next door. If
property owners could be made
to understand that, the housing
problem, in this area, would be
solved.
Incidentally, th e Rumford
Act, though it "fails to halt
discrimination in housing," has
been a tremendous help in
fighting it, chiefly through the
publicity it has received. No
landlord or manager is an y
longer ignorant of the nature
of his act when he turns a
Negro away at his doorstep,
and often it is enough to point
out that he has been caught

in flagrante delicto to cause
him to abandon his position.

• Library Photographs
Editor, The Daily:
The stark visual confronta
tion with poverty which Mr.
S t if 1 e r' s photographs (dis
played in the entrance to the
Main Library), present is al
most enough to convey some
sense of what poverty is. One
can almost smell the odor of
decaying food (because there
arc no refrigerators), or en
vision the flies resting on the
face of the baby in the next
room, or feel the skin of chil
dren suffering from inadequate
diets.
As one who has worked two
summers in Mexican migrant
camps in the U.S., one summer
in the Negro ghettos of t he
South, and has spent much
time in New York City's lower
east side, I would stress that
these pictures, though taken in
El Salvador, could be dupli
cated in many places in Amer
ica as well as in Africa, Asia,
and Latin America.
Can anyone be less than out
raged by the injustice and hu
man suffering these pictures
represent?

• Smoke Screen
Editor, The Daily:
Stephen Shefler spreads a
smoke-screen over the political
battleground. By means of
foggy half-truths and misty
evasions ho hopes to obscure
the issues of the Republican
presidential nomination, leav
ing visible only the dim forms
of the candidates.
The worst of his evasions
concerns the issue of "positive"
and "negative" governmental
policy. He claims that a policy

of repeal and contraction of
Welfare is "negative" whereas
a policy of continued govern
ment handouts is "positive."
To know what is positive or
negative policy, one must dis
cern the function of govern
ment what it can do; what it
may do: one must discern the
nature of man.
.... Man has two things to
gain from a society, knowl
edge and trade, and he can
gain them only in a rational,
productive, free society w i th
rational, free, and productive
men.
To secure freedom, a society
must recognize the inalienable
rights of man the conditions
required by man for his proper
survival; to objectify these
rights it must codify laws; to
maintain these laws it must
enforce them. Subjective en
forcement will not do mobs
and vengeance seekers wreak
chaos.
Thus under a proper social
system, a private individual
may do anything not legally
forbidden; but a government
official may do nothing except
what is legally permitted.
In the United States, it is
the duty of public officials not
lo overstep their authority; or
il' the government oversteps,
public officials should check its
advance and return it to legal
ity.
Which public official has
most consistently fought our
incumbent governmental octo
pus? Check the voting record:
Barry Gold water. Read hi s
books: Barry Goldwater. Ex
amine his principles: Barry
Goldwater.
One does not advance deficit
spending to cure the symptoms
of previous deficits. One does
not finance unemployed per
sons to cure unemployment.
One does not grubstake the
enemy to cure his endless hun
ger. One does not take poison
to cure poison — and Barry
Goldwater proposes the anti
dode. To a person who values
his life, nothing could be more
positive.
