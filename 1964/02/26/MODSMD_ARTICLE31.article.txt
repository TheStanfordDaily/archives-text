## Civil Rights Support Jeopardized In Bill 
### Darryl R. Wold 
The Civil Rights Bill has passed the House, and now goes to
the Senate, where prospects of passage are much dimmer. The
major part of the bill deals with protection of constitutional guar
j antees — in particular, enforcement of voting rights and implemen
j tation of the Supremo Court's desegregation rulings.
There is little objection to the established principles behind
this, that it is a legitimate function of the federal government
under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to protect in
dividuals from discrimination by state governments.
This should be clearly distinguished, however, from Title 11,
the so-called Public Accommodations section of the bill, aimed at
"private" discrimination, and applying solely to privately-owned
places of public accommodation, such as motels, restaurants,
theaters, and other private establishments.
Some people will object to this bill, it is true, solely because it
prohibits discrimination. However, there are many people who
are personally opposed to discrimination, but who have grave
doubts about the constitutionality of this section and the extent
to which it would interfere with individual freedom of action, in
cluding the use of private property. An individual has the right
to be arbitrary, opinionated, and prejudiced, if he so desires, as
opposed to the government's duty to operate uniformly, fairly, and
indiscriminately.

REFLECTING THE DOUBTS as to its constitutionality, Title
11, as it now stands, has been brought under both the commerce
clause of the Constitution and the Fourteen Amendment Thus,
discrimination by a private establishment is prohibited if it caters
to interstate travelers, or if a "substantial portion" of its products
have traveled in interstate commerce. This section also prohibits,
under the Fourteenth Amendment, discrimination by all establish
ments in any way licensed by a state, or where discrimination is
otherwise "supported by State action. Thus the commerce clause
is stretched from control of the flow of commerce between states
to now achieve regulation of the conduct of individuals using goods
traveling in interstate commerce, and state concern in licensing
private business for the protection of customers is used to bring
the businesses within the control oJ the federal government. It
is easy to see that this method could have almost unlimited appli
cation, and is a perversion of the original intention of these provi
sions of the Constitution.
Yet this provision is a major goal of the civil rights movement.
In recent interviews, the leaders of the five major civil rights or
ganizations stressed the primary importance of this provision, one
even saying that a bill without this might be worse than no bill
at all. This puts those individuals concerned with the deprivation
of a portion of the American people of their constitutional rights
in the position of supporting a measure of doubtlnl constitutionality
and dangerous implications. It is my opinion that this legislation
cannot be supported.

theaters, and other private establishments.
Some people will object to this bill, it is true, solely because it
prohibits discrimination. However, there are many people who
are personally opposed to discrimination, but who have grave
doubts about the constitutionality of this section and the extent
to which it would interfere with individual freedom of action, in
cluding the use of private property. An individual has the right
to be arbitrary, opinionated, and prejudiced, if he so desires, as
opposed to the government's duty to operate uniformly, fairly, and
indiscriminately.

REFLECTING THE DOUBTS as to its constitutionality, Title
11, as it now stands, has been brought under both the commerce
clause of the Constitution and the Fourteen Amendment Thus,
discrimination by a private establishment is prohibited if it caters
to interstate travelers, or if a "substantial portion" of its products
have traveled in interstate commerce. This section also prohibits,
under the Fourteenth Amendment, discrimination by all establish
ments in any way licensed by a state, or where discrimination is
otherwise "supported by State action. Thus the commerce clause
is stretched from control of the flow of commerce between states
to now achieve regulation of the conduct of individuals using goods
traveling in interstate commerce, and state concern in licensing
private business for the protection of customers is used to bring
the businesses within the control oJ the federal government. It
is easy to see that this method could have almost unlimited appli
cation, and is a perversion of the original intention of these provi
sions of the Constitution.
Yet this provision is a major goal of the civil rights movement.
In recent interviews, the leaders of the five major civil rights or
ganizations stressed the primary importance of this provision, one
even saying that a bill without this might be worse than no bill
at all. This puts those individuals concerned with the deprivation
of a portion of the American people of their constitutional rights
in the position of supporting a measure of doubtlnl constitutionality
and dangerous implications. It is my opinion that this legislation
cannot be supported.

The Civil Rights Bill has passed the House, and now goes to
the Senate, where prospects of passage are much dimmer. The
major part of the bill deals with protection of constitutional guar
j antees — in particular, enforcement of voting rights and implemen
j tation of the Supremo Court's desegregation rulings.
There is little objection to the established principles behind
this, that it is a legitimate function of the federal government
under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to protect in
dividuals from discrimination by state governments.
This should be clearly distinguished, however, from Title 11,
the so-called Public Accommodations section of the bill, aimed at
"private" discrimination, and applying solely to privately-owned
places of public accommodation, such as motels, restaurants,
theaters, and other private establishments.
