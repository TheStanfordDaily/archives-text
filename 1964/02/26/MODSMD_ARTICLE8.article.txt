### VIVIAN BOZMAN Feature Editor 
The Reverend William Shirley,
a candidate for the Democratic
nomination for St;ite Assembly,
will speak today at 4:15 p.m. in
Tresidder.
Shirley's talk, sponsored by the
Socialist Caucus, will include a
description of the "new kind of
political campaign" the Reverend
intends to wage in his fight for
the nomination. Shirley's state
ment of his platform character
izes the campaign as one which
will place human rights over
property rights, which will be di
rected against poverty, unemploy
ment, and discrimination. The
Reverend believes that a radical
1 approach to these problems is
needed one which will utilize the
| full resources of the state in a
I drive to "End Poverty in Califor
-1 nia."
SPECIFIC PLANKS in the
Shirley platform include a state
program "to make disarmament
1 an asset, not a disaster in Cali

fornia," a program which would
raise the current unemployment
compensation and provide job
training for laid off workers at
full unemployment compensation
until a new job is found; a hous
ing policy which would make low

cost morlgages guaranteed by the
stale available to all Californians
who seek to purchase homes; and
an urban renewal policy which
wwuld prevent further slum clear
ance until at least as many low
cost housing units are built: as
are to be destroyed. "Projects
must not become income and race
ghettoes," the platform states.
Shirley, an active member of
COR.E, also seeks a law requiring
compulsory listing of all job open
ings with the State Employment
Agency and one which would re
voke all state licenses in cases
of proven discrimination. "While
the Rumford Act is good as far
as it goes," the platform states,
"it will require adequate policing
and continued pressure."
CONCERNING health, welfare,
and disability, the platform af
firms. "It is not and should not
be a disgrace to be poor. People
on welfare must have the right
to lie represented on welfare
boards through their own spokes
men ..." Shirley will, it' elected,
also propose a bill to provide full
medical and dental cure, as a
right, to all Californians, with
coverage provided through a state
insurance agency.
In keeping with his emphasis
on a new type of political cam
paign, Shirley will introduce sev
eral innovations in campaigning
methods, including streel meet
ings and debates with other can
didates.
Stanford students interested in
supporting Shirley will have an
opportunity to work actively for
their candidate during spring
quarter by doing precinct work
in San Francisco's Potrero Hill,
under the coordination of the so
cialist caucus.

raise the current unemployment

training for laid off workers at

ing policy which would make low

cost morlgages guaranteed by the
stale available to all Californians
who seek to purchase homes; and
an urban renewal policy which
wwuld prevent further slum clear
ance until at least as many low
cost housing units are built: as
are to be destroyed. "Projects
must not become income and race
ghettoes," the platform states.
Shirley, an active member of
COR.E, also seeks a law requiring
compulsory listing of all job open
ings with the State Employment
Agency and one which would re
voke all state licenses in cases
of proven discrimination. "While
the Rumford Act is good as far
