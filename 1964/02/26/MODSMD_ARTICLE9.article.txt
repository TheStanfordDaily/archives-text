# Occidental Women Now Off Campus
## 
### 
Senior women at Occidental
College, Los Angeles, will be per
mitted to live off campus next
year according to The Occidental.
Mary Laing Swift, Occidental
Dean of Women, said the permis
sion was given because dormitory
space is limited. "For the past
several years there has been a
marked decrease in drop-outs of
currently enrolled resident stu
dents, together with a continuing
increase in the number of new
students who wish to live on cam
pus."
DEAN SWIFT said any woman
who will be 21 by January 1,
1965, and has the permission of
her parents, may live off campus.
The measure is temporary and
will be reviewed again "in light
of many new circumstances," pre
sumably more living space.
As soon as dormitory space is
available, women will be encour
aged to live on campus. Residence
living "offers an experience that
cannot be received elsewhere,"
said Dean Swift.
THE COLLEGK ma fie the de
cision when 58 women who were
either promised rooms or put on
waiting lists, could not be housed
on cam mis without overcrowding.
