A WORD TO WISE CHRISTIANS
"And you he made alive, when you were dead through trespasses and sins in
which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince
of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobe
dience. Among these we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, following
the desires of body and mind, and so we were by nature children of wrath, like
the rest of mankind. But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with
which he loved us, even when we were dead through our trespasses made us alive
together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with him,
and made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus. For by grace
you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift
of , God not because of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his work
manship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand,
that we should walk in them.
"Therefore be imitators of God, as believed children. And walk in love, as
Christ loved us and gave himself for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
But immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among
you, as is fitting among saints. Let there be no filthiness, nor silly talk, nor
levity, which are not fitting; but instead let there be thanksgiving. Be sure of
this, that no immoral or impure man, or one who is covetous (that is, an idolater)
has any inheritance in tlie kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you
with empty words, for it is because of these things that the wrath of God comes
upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not associate with them, for once
you were darkness, but now you are light (for the fruit of light is found in all
that is good and right and true); and try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. For
it is a shame even to speak of the things that they do in secret; but when any
thing is exposed by the light it becomes visible, for anything that becomes visible
i>- light. Therefore it is said, Awake O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and
Christ shall give you light." Ephesians 2:1-10, 5:1-15. RSV.

A WORD TO WISE CHRISTIANS
"And you he made alive, when you were dead through trespasses and sins in
which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince
of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobe
dience. Among these we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, following
the desires of body and mind, and so we were by nature children of wrath, like
the rest of mankind. But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with
which he loved us, even when we were dead through our trespasses made us alive
together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with him,
and made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus. For by grace
you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift
of , God not because of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his work
manship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand,
that we should walk in them.
"Therefore be imitators of God, as believed children. And walk in love, as
Christ loved us and gave himself for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
But immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among
you, as is fitting among saints. Let there be no filthiness, nor silly talk, nor
levity, which are not fitting; but instead let there be thanksgiving. Be sure of
this, that no immoral or impure man, or one who is covetous (that is, an idolater)
has any inheritance in tlie kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you
with empty words, for it is because of these things that the wrath of God comes
upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not associate with them, for once
you were darkness, but now you are light (for the fruit of light is found in all
that is good and right and true); and try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. For
it is a shame even to speak of the things that they do in secret; but when any
thing is exposed by the light it becomes visible, for anything that becomes visible
i>- light. Therefore it is said, Awake O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and
Christ shall give you light." Ephesians 2:1-10, 5:1-15. RSV.
