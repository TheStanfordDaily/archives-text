# Clubs To Hold Open Houses
## 
### 
The Eating Clubs will hold open
houses from 7:45 to 10=00 to
night. The clubs represent a mode
of living unique to Stanford.
The first Eating Clubs were
formed around the turn of the
century with the meal hour serv
ing as the basis for informal or
ganization. In the following years
new units were formed until the
last of the seven clubs was
founded in 1922. From this be
ginning the clubs grew rapidly,
especially after World War 11, to
their current combined member
ship of almost 400.
By 1951 the clubs had outgrown
their quarters in Encina Com
mons and moved into their pres
ent building, constructed by their
own initiative.
In addition to the dinner table

contacts implied in their name,
the clubs participate in the school
intramural program, hold parties
both on and off campus, invite
guest speakers and professors to
meals, and buy blocks of tickets
to symphonies and other cultural
events.
The Eating Clubs do have some
traditions, but participation in all
club functions such as meetings,
social activities, and athletics is
strictly on a voluntary basis.
The member is free to choose
his roommates and may live on
or off campus. In joining a club
lie chooses the group in which
he thinks he will form the best
friendships. Yet, because the
clubs are not living groups,
friendships are not restricted to
the group.

The member is also free to de
termine the way he will divide
his time between club functions,
extra-curricular activities, and
academics. Since the members are
not restricted by rules, activities
are pursued only by those stu
dents who wish to do so, and it
is not likely that the enthusiasm
for the activities will be damp
ened by unwilling participants.
Another advantage of this sys
tem is reflected by the Clubs' 2.8
grade average last quarter, which
was the highest on campus for
men's living groups.
The Eating Clubs can also say
that they have had only two
cases in the past three years
brought up before the Inter-Club
Judicial Council; this year there
have been none. The Eating

Clubs hope that this is an in
dication of honest enthusiasm.
The clubs extend a welcome
invitation to all freshmen and all
other unaffiliated men to attend
their open houses tonight.
