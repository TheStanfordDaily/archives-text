# Maryland Limits Chaplain
##

COLLEGE PARK, Md. (CPS)—
| The Church, State and fraternity
life have collided head on at the
University of Maryland. The
Church ran last.
The latest in the feud came this
week in the form of a denial from
university President Wilson H.
Elkins rejecting accusations that
the university has denied its chap
lains freedom of speech and ac
tion.
i
Bringing the charge on behalf
of the chaplains was the Mary
land Chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU),
headed by Dr. Arthur Stinch
combe, sociology professor at
Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Uni
versity.
Behind the charges and denials
was the main victim—the Rev.
Jesse Meyers, who said he was
resigning after 13 years as Pres
byterian chaplain at the Univer
sity of Maryland.
Last August Meyers sent a
letter to the parents of incoming
Presbyterian students warning of
loosing their sons to the evils of
fraternity life. Meyers noted the
low moral standards prevailing
along frat row and speculated the
depravity was a possible cause

of low academic standing.
While the letter was an appar
ent attempt to safeguard the
morals of students, President El
kins, when he got wind of it,
thought Meyers had overstepped
his duties.

Also angered was the Mary
land Board of Regents, a state
appointed group headed by spice
man Charles McCormick which
overseas the operation of the
land-grant university.
McCormick, a strong supporter
of fraternity life, and other board
members went along with Elkins
in censuring Meyers. They also
approved this policy governing
the campus chaplains: "Duties on
campus should be limited to serv
ing the religious needs of the
members of their denominations.
To Stinchcombe, who visited the
Maryland campus last week, the
policy gives the university "the
power to decide what is religion."
The ACLU representative told
a cheering student group that it
"clearly violates the' separation
of church and state spelled out in
the Constitution. It was retard
ing the campus intellectual
growth and damaging its acad
emic stature by denying academic
freedom."
But Elkins didn't see it that
way. "The university has every
right to expect ethical and re
sponsible conduct from the cam
pus chaplains," he said.
