## Golf Team Starts 
### 
Stanford's varsity and fresh
man golf teams open their sea
sons simultaneously Friday after
noon on tho Stanford course. The

varsity will toe off against the
Peninsula Golf and Country Club
at 1 p.m. and the frosh follow at
1:20 against Menlo College.
Stanford's 19(54 team should be
strong in individual talent, but
has little depth. The top three
men, Jim Rheim, Jerry Hanweck
and Bill Sechrest, can hold their
own agains anyone else in col
lege today.
At tho moment it looks as if
the next three slots on the six
man varsity unit should bo taken
up by streaky Rob Ireland, im
proving Joff Johnson and Mike
Jennings.
Coach Bud Finger had high
hopes that those last three will
develop enough to give the In
dians strength in conl'oronce and
national competition.
Rheim. the number one man,
was doing well in last year's
NCAA championships until oust
ed by Rich Sykes of Arkansas,
the eventual champ. With an im
proved putting and short iron
game, Rheim could go a long way
this season.
Following Friday's opener, the
varsity will host San Francisco
State on the Stanford links at
noon Saturday.
