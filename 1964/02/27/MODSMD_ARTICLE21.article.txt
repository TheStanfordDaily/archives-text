# Stanford Blasts S.F. State, 10-7
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball team
whipped a San Francisco State
nine 10-7 Tuesday afternoon in a
contest that may have been an
indication of good things to come.
Coach Dutch Fehring had indi
cated prior to the game that lie
felt SF State was one of the bet
ter teams in Northern California.
Stanford took advantage of
eight Gator errors to build up a
10-3 lead before a four-run rally
in the ninth narrowed the gap
somewhat.
The Indians jumped off to a 2-1
lead in the first inning on a triple
by Bobby Cox and a sacrifice fly
by Jimmy Hibbs. Stanford got two
more runs in the third on a Lon
Raymond hit and a series of SF
State errors.
Raymond also figured in the
scoring in the fifth when he
knocked in a run on a single, and
in the seventh when he hit an
inside the park home run to deep
center field.
Mike Connelly started and got
the win for the Tribe. He was re
lieved by Terry Docken and later
by John Mason. Mason was hit
for the four run Gator burst in
the ninth.
