# THREE FORFEITS
## Wrestlers Beat Santa Clara 
### RODGER MAGNUSON 
There were a lot of wrestling
i exhibition matches in the Pavilion
Tuesday night. Santa Clara in
vaded Indian territory missing
contestants in three different
weight classes. Worse yet. those
three weight classes harbor three
! of Stanford's most dependable
point-getters, in Dick Anderson at
123, Phil Kendall at 157 and Don
Buehler at heavyweight.
But it really didn't make a whole
lot of difference as the Indians
romped to 23-9 victory. The lower
weights again were the bad ones
for the Indians as Santa Clara
picked up their three derisions
consecutively in the 130, 137 and
1 17-pound classes.
AT 123, Dick Anderson found
himself with no opponent, until
S.C. finally remembered a fresh
man with whom Anderson could
wrestle in an exhibition match.
Stanford got five points on the
forfeiture, and Anderson made
sure it was earned as he summar
ily pinned his man in 1:51.
Wrestling at 130 for the first
time. Jerry Smith was deeisioned

by 9-5; at 137. Dave Herasmichuk ,
lost almost identically, by 9-0; j
and at 147 sophomore Carroll :
Bridgewater was deeisioned 8-4.
Co-captain 157-pound Phil Ken
dall didn't get the opportunity to i
put his official season long victory I
string on the line because of a |
Santa Clara forfeiture, but never
theless wrestled two exhibitions,
winning one by a pin at 1:47, and
winning the other from a 107-
pounder, 5-0.
AT 1(17, Joel Kay, who alter
nates with sophomore Steve j
Schaum at that weight, won 13-9;
at 177, Tom Allen took only 1:28
to pin his outclassed Santa Clara
opponent, and at heavyweight Don
Buehler, won by forfeiture.
This Saturday, the Tribe is out
for vengance as they meet the)
San Jose Spartans in a meel at j
the Pavilion at 7:30 p.m., preceded I
by a Frosh-Junior Varsity encoun- '
ter at 0 p.m. The last time
around the Indians split eight j
matches with the Spartans, los- '
ing the first four, and winning the !
second four. Two pins however !
gave San Jose the win.


808 COX, Stanford's top outfielder, is rated as potentially one of
the Tribe's best ever. The Indians host Cal Poly of San Luis Obispo
in their next game, Feb. 29.

808 COX, Stanford's top outfielder, is rated as potentially one of
the Tribe's best ever. The Indians host Cal Poly of San Luis Obispo
in their next game, Feb. 29.
There were a lot of wrestling
i exhibition matches in the Pavilion
Tuesday night. Santa Clara in
vaded Indian territory missing
contestants in three different
weight classes. Worse yet. those
three weight classes harbor three
! of Stanford's most dependable
point-getters, in Dick Anderson at
123, Phil Kendall at 157 and Don
Buehler at heavyweight.
But it really didn't make a whole
lot of difference as the Indians
romped to 23-9 victory. The lower
weights again were the bad ones
for the Indians as Santa Clara
picked up their three derisions
consecutively in the 130, 137 and
1 17-pound classes.
AT 123, Dick Anderson found
himself with no opponent, until
S.C. finally remembered a fresh
man with whom Anderson could
wrestle in an exhibition match.
Stanford got five points on the
forfeiture, and Anderson made
sure it was earned as he summar
ily pinned his man in 1:51.
Wrestling at 130 for the first
time. Jerry Smith was deeisioned

by 9-5; at 137. Dave Herasmichuk ,
lost almost identically, by 9-0; j
and at 147 sophomore Carroll :
Bridgewater was deeisioned 8-4.
Co-captain 157-pound Phil Ken
dall didn't get the opportunity to i
put his official season long victory I
string on the line because of a |
Santa Clara forfeiture, but never
theless wrestled two exhibitions,
winning one by a pin at 1:47, and
winning the other from a 107-
pounder, 5-0.
AT 1(17, Joel Kay, who alter
nates with sophomore Steve j
Schaum at that weight, won 13-9;
at 177, Tom Allen took only 1:28
to pin his outclassed Santa Clara
opponent, and at heavyweight Don
Buehler, won by forfeiture.
This Saturday, the Tribe is out
for vengance as they meet the)
San Jose Spartans in a meel at j
the Pavilion at 7:30 p.m., preceded I
by a Frosh-Junior Varsity encoun- '
ter at 0 p.m. The last time
around the Indians split eight j
matches with the Spartans, los- '
ing the first four, and winning the !
second four. Two pins however !
gave San Jose the win.
