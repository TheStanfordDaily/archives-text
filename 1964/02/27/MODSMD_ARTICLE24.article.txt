# UCLA Bruins Clinch Title
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO â€” UCLA is
the 1964 AAWU basketball cham
pion and will represent the Con
ference in the NCAA Tournament
in March.
The Bruins clinched their title
with a pair of wins over the last
weekend, oven though the valiant
California Bears tried to make a
stretch run at the champs with
a pair of wins of their own.
For UCLA, this is the third
straight time it has either won or
shared the title. The Bruins won
the 1962 crown, tied with S t a 11-
ford in 1963 and are clear-cut
til lists this year.

Now John Wooden's wonders
can shift full attention to the next
goal . an unblemish regular-sea
son record. The Bruins will he the
first AAWU team to go through
the regular season without a loss
if they win their next three con
tests, and the first Pacific Coast
team to turn the trick since the
19~)6 Uclans.
The scoring race, a one-man
affair for Gail Goodrich of UCLA
until now, took on added interest,
over the weekend. Tom Dose of
Stanford showed signs of recover
ing from the knee trouble which
has plagued him this campaign
by pouring in 3.S points against
UCLA and 23 points against USC
to close in on Goodrich. The
UCLA guard has a 22.0 points per
game mark, Dose now has a 19.6
mark.
Dose leads the free throw shoot
ers, but VVSU's Byron Vadset and
USC's Doug Bolcom are well with
in range to catch the tall leader.
