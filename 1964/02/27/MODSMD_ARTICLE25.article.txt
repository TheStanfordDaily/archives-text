The Stanford freshmen baseball
team opened its season on an
auspicious note by swamping
Sacred Heart High School 10-2.
Pitcho Daro Quiring went the
full nine innings to get credit for
this win. Quiring allowed six hits
while chalking up 13 strikeouts.
He also had seven innings of shut
out ball until the eighth when two
bloop singles, a wild pitch, and
another single accounted for the
two Sacred Heart runs.
