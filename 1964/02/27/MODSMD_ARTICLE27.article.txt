# UNDER A ROCK
## Clay And The Beatles: Giant Hoax? 
### FORD BURKHART 
Shortly alter 7 p.m., the event
started.
Beneath a blue-green painting
by Picasso, the sounds of the
Fight emerged in true hi-fidelity
through large stereo speakers in
the plush music room.
A sign at the Tresidder infor
mation desk announced the radio
broadcast of the Fight — under
the auspices of the Cultural
Events Division.
Twenty-eight s t udo nt s had
crowed into the small music room
a few minutes before 7 o'clock.

Only three were
girls.
Downs t a i r s
other groups
gathered around
portable radios
on the terraces
and in the din
ing area.
About half an

hour later, one of the most shal
low and unexciting fights we've
heard ended with a whimper and
a sigh.
A few students were heard to
shout, like the Beatles, "Yea, yea,
yea." Cassius Clay had won.

THE SIX-ROUND fight was
secondary.
A more extraordinary event
started moments after the final
bell.
The news of the results spread
like wildfire, through the Union,
across the Stanford campus, and
across the nation.
By Wednesday morning, virtu
ally every adult male in the
United States had been exposed
to a message about Cassius. Or
so the experts have estimated.
Perhaps 90 per cent of the men
read something in a newspaper
about the fight. Very few of the
other 10 per cent could have
avoided the repeated messages on
radio and television and the fre
quent conversations about it as
people repeated to friends what
they had read or heard.
It was an amazing story of fast
and complete diffusion of news.
But there was more to it than
that.

DURING TIIK absurd, even pre
posterous, moments of lunacy that
were recorded by radio micro
phones after the fight, our
thoughts turned back to some
thing we had read in the New-
York Times seven days earlier.
Dateline: Miami Beach.
In the ring were Ringo Starr,
the littlest Beatle, and Cassius, the
biggest Lip. Three other Beatles
stood nearby.
Clay picked up Ringo.
"They swirled around scream
ing and yelling, as half a dozen
teenage girls appeared, fighting to
touch the Beatles. . . .
"The five young men danced
and laughed and cavorted like co
consiprators in a gigantic hoax,"
the article reported.
It sounded like insanity.
But these five young men have
been rewarded with millions of
dollars and unprecedented public
recognition.
Is it a hoax? Is it insanity? Is
it mass cultural taste?
We leave the answer to you.
