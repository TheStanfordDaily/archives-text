## U.S. Foreign Policy: Success Or Failure? A 						Good Beginning Has Been Made No Understanding Of Communism 
### STEVE LEOPOLD PAUL CORLEY 
THE QUESTION: Is tin-
New Frontier foreign pol
icy a success or failure?

Has the foreign policy of the Kennedy-John
son Administrations been a success or a failure?
At first glance, it appears to be both.
It is a "success" in that we—and "we" means
every country that was not communist domi
nated in January of 1961—are still alive and
relatively free. It is a "failure" in that we are
not secure.
And here, indeed, is the loot of the contro
versy over foreign policy. To the critic, the
Kennedy-Johnson failure is not so much that it
has cost us freedom but, rather, that it has not
bought or won security from the communist
menace.
Thus, the cry of "Why not victory?" is heard
in the land. The remedy, it is said, lies in "win
ning the Cold War," in thwarting the commu
nist drive and rolling back the Iron Curtain.
Then, and only then, will we have both freedom
and security.
There is a major fallacy in this theory, in
herent in the "roll-back" philosophy. Simply
stated, it's a matter of the Soviets being unwill
ing to be rolled.
THE "ROLL-BACK" tactic is offered as a
contrast to the present policy of containment.
Containment, a term coined by George Ken nan
in 1947, has never been a politically popular
policy, especially since the Korean War. That
bloody stalemate, which took 50,000 American
lives, embittered many of those who had reluc
tantly agreed to grant support to Turkey and
Greece in 1947-48 in their struggle against com
munism. If American men are to die, they rea
soned. should they not die attacking rather
than defending?
And so, John Foster Dulles offered a new
policy the aforementioned "roll-back" policy.
This policy went bankrupt with the Hungarian
crisis of 1956, yet now it is being brought for
ward again.
It is not enough to stand resolute when mis
siles are stationed in Cuba, as Kennedy did so
successfully in October of 1962. or painfully
to stand silent while the Soviets build a wall
in their own territory, as they did in Berlin in
1961. No, the Marines must be used, the enemy
like Carthage must be destroyed.

THE OBVIOUS FALLACY in all this is the
assumption that the Soviets, unlike the Cartha
genians, will melt away in the face of ultima
tums and the threat of force. The 'conserva
tives,' like many of their counterparts in the
communist bloc, have become prisoners of their
own dogmatic assertions.
"Basically," we are assured by Senator Gold
water in The Conscience of a Conservative, "the
Russian people are on our side." Here is yet an
other example of "conservative logic." Gold
water's own appeal is unabashedly keyed to
jingoistic sentiments in America, yet it never
occurs to him that perhaps Russian nationalism
also transcends ideological lines.
In an age where nuclear warfare is suicide,
any action taken on the assumption that the
Soviets will yield completely, because of inter
nal dissent ion or lack of will, is folly.
And yet. the critic will say, the Cuban crisis
of '62 undermines this argument. To some ex
tent this is true, but there are two important
conditions. First, the U.S. left the initiative for
launching nuclear warfare to the Soviets- since
the U.S. had the situation well in hand tactically
(just as the Soviets did in Hungary)—and sec
ond. the Soviets were given a quiet way out. No
concessions were made: the missiles were re
moved, U.S. bases in Turkey were not evacu
ated, the status quo was restored.
Yet, and here we return to the vital ques
tion ,is the status quo enough?
IN THE BELIEF that it is not, many non
"eonservative" critics of Kennedy-Johnson for
eign policy have suggested a third policy, again
the word springs from Ambassador Kennan's
fertile mind, "disengagement."
Disengagement entails mutual withdrawal
of troops in such places as Europe, Viet Nam.
and Laos. The Administration has, with the ex
ception of the murky situation in Laos, refused
to adopt this policy. Disengagement is a pos
sibility in Africa and Latin America where
troops from both camps are not stationed in
great numbers, but to pursue such a policy on
the borders of the Iron Curtain has wisely been
rejected.
And so, we are left with containment, often
an uneasy bedfellow. Is it enough? Initself.no.
of course not. Fortunately, there is another
area of conflict, and here we must strive for
"total victory."
Parallel to the military-political struggle, this
second battle is being waged, to use the late
President's words, against "poverty, disease and
war itself."

THE PEACE CORPS and its ever growing
private counterparts, the Alliance for Progress,
and the nuclear test ban treaty, all are weapons
in the silent "twilight" struggle to destroy hate,
distrust, misery, and ignorance—the breeding
ground of commuism.
And while this deadly battle is being waged,
the noisier war of words continues. But the suc
cess or failure of New Frontier foreign policy
cannot be judged by its rhetoric, just as it can
not be condemned for its refusal to accept the
Goldwater assumption that security can be won
with tough talk; rather, it will be judged eventu
ally by its action to alleviate the causes of ten
sion in the modern world.
A start -and a good one has been made,
and that is not a failure.

Com mi t tee.

America's basic self-interest is to preserve
and to extend her heritage of self-limiting
constitutional authority which guarantees the
environment for spiritual freedoms and per
sonal self-realization. This our national purpose
we cannot too often reassert and reconsider. If
our foreign policy is not founded on enlightened
national self-interest, our purpose cannot pre
vail.
Today the international revolutionary com
munist movement, convinced that personal spiri
tual qualities are produced through changes in
economic conditions, a movement exploited as
well by despots large and small, seeks to efface
our heritage. In short, the Communists mean
to "bury" us, and nothing less.
From his anlaysis of the Khrushchev speech
of January (>, 1961, Dr. Stephan Possony testi
fied before the Senate: "The traditional goal of
Communism, the conquest of the entire world,
is not only reaffirmed, but it is held far more
strongly and hopefully than in the past. It is
'unthinkable' that the Communists will abandon
their goal of world domination regardless of the
price they have to pay."
We cannot co-exist with revolutionary Com
munism because it cannot by its ideological
ground co-exist with our traditional premeses.
Thus our foreign policy must act to eliminate
revolutionary Communism altogether. How
long, then, how many words, how much evidence
must come before we all clearly understand
that the Communists mean business, that they
have not "mollified" themselves, that the Cold
War is nol a behaviorist's picnic, thai Khru
shchev is not just another overgrown juvenile
delinquent, whom perhaps good "reason" and
"trust" can assuage and "reform" out of his
ideological slums?

THE NEW FRONTIER does not evince proper
understanding of Communism and therefore
disqualifies itself from the right to iis office.
Its failure evolves from the root philosophical
assumptions of contemporary Liberalism. These
lie most notably in positivism, or empiricism,
the most modish philosophical system on the
American intellectual scene.
Methods reigns supreme, for only the scien
tific method can offer evidence about "reality."
Unquantifiable personal values are "phased out"
as "conventional" anachronisms. The best way
to "accommodate" and "readjust" Communism
is through the proper methodological channel,
while perhaps the most "reasonable" devise for
institutionalizing "democracy" around the world
is the U.N.
In fact, the ideal of our national purpose has
been ideologized into a methodological tool. The
Liberal intellectuals of the ADA, who exten
sively staff and control the Administration, and
others believe that time and patience, spiced
wih liberal amounts of foreign aid and sym
pathetic "togetherness" with the Soviets, can
convert the determined Communists into toler
ent, peace-loving world citizens.
The fact is that Communist dogma, eschato
logically conceived with an all-embracing appeal,
has a methodology far more consistent and rig
orous, a philosophy more sophisticated and pro
found than the positivism and "positive" pro
grams dished up by New Frontier Liberals.
These are not unqualified to formulate our for
eign policy because they are "intellectuals," but
because they lack the rational power needed to
comprehend the principles and problems in
volved in our struggle with revolutionary Com
munism. In short, they do not know what is
happening, where we arc going, or why.
Instead of enacting a clear-cut program to
eliminate revolutionary Communism, the New
Frontier has passively accommodated it be
cause "everyone will reform." For example, the
Administration admitted the Test-Ban would
restrict our military technology, but promoted
it for its "political" (read: methodological) "ad
vantages."
★ ★ ★
THE TEST-BAN is wrong because it 1)
spreads the illusion that the Soviets are worth
trusting, which, by their ideological premeses
and goals, they certainly are not; 2) provides
no effective way to verify Soviet compliance; 3)
prohibits certain non-military uses of nuclear
explusions such as the Ploughshare plan for
building canals. We have already begun uni
lateral disarmament.
Just after the missile crisis in Cuba, our
"first strike" bases were removed from Turkey,
England, and Italy, while Skybolt and about 90
percent of our bombers are "phased out," our
missiles untested under combat-like conditions.
Why? Perhaps so as not to frighten the Soviets
with "overkill?" Nor has any U.N. team once
inspected Cuba since the Crisis, though that was
the agreement with Khrushchev.
Dept. of Slate publication 7277 formally pro
poses total disarmament for all nations within
ten years under the U.N. But the U.N., com
posed of highly nationalistic and unsophisticated
nations, is not qualified.
Khrushchev does not mean peace and dis
armament. as we understand them. On Janu
ary 6, 1961 he said: "The struggle for disarma
ment is against imperialism. In the struggle for
peace we must use prudent representatives of
ihe bourgeoisie. . . . The Communists fully sup
port just wars, and without reservation. . . .
Nat ional liberation wars are inevitable. . . . We
must wage implacable war on revisionism which
tries to wipe out the revolutionary essence of
Marxism-Leninism." Thus the New Frontier
awaits.
