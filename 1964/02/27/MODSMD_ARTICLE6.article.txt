# MAIN LIBRARY
## Achilles Heel Of Stanford 
### BILL SMITH Associate Editor 
Climb the stairs to the foyer j
of the Main Library, and look
around. On all sides are strong,
substantial pillars, wide in girth
and solid-looking. With y o u r
knuckles, tap gently on a pillar.

It is hollow. It is only a shell.
When plans were first drawn
up for Quad, it was David Starr
Jordan's wish that the library hold
the central place. Only after ex
tended discussion with Mrs. Stan
ford did he agree to give the cen
tral location to a Church. The
Library was built on the eastern
side of Quad.
IT HAS BEEN said of Harvard
University, "If all the faculty and
students departed, and all th e
buildings except Weidner Library
burnt down, this would still be
a great university."
Perhaps Lewis Spitz. Associate
Professor of History, puts it best:
"Faculties die in a foreseeable
future. Students graduate. But
libraries arc for keeps."
"And the Library is the Achil
les Heel of Stanford University,
the soft underbelly," Spitz says.
"The holding are small and have
been casually acquired. There aiv
deficiencies in academy publica
tions, periodicals and source ma
terials. Holdings of significant
monographs in the areas of his
tory and literature are limited."
RESEARCH, to expand man's
knowledge, and study, to transf< r
ibis knowledge are central to a
University and to a library, a n d
Stanford compares unfavorably
with other major institutions.
Outside the collection in the
Hoover Library, wliicli deals ex

elusively with the modern period,
the library has about 1.3 million
holds, as compared with 7 mil
lion at Harvard, and I million at
Yale and 3.1 million al the Uni
versity of Illinois, and 2.2 million
at the University of Chicago. "At
the present rate of growth, we
will be worse off in relations to
others in 10 years," Spitz said.
THE UNIVERSITY of Chicago
is investing $1.) million in library
development. Enough is to be in
vested in book purchase funds to
get an additional 6 million vol
umes in the next fifteen years.
This is assured.
"A great private university can
build a great library." Spitz said.
"In the last year," he said,
"there have been very hopeful
signs. The acting director is a
man of considerable vigor. With
the addition of two men to the
acquisitions department, a great
step has been made. This is the
first time we've had an acquisi
tions staff. The people in the li
brary are achieving a great deal
under very limited circumstances.
They are the Vutural heroes' of
the University."
"Bui anybody who wants a
quick list of Stanford's position
library-wise, can talk to any of
the several dozen people at the
Behavorial Science Center. Most
people there think the Stanford
libraries are ridiculous a laugh
inrj slock," Spit£ said.

When plans were first drawn
up for Quad, it was David Starr
Jordan's wish that the library hold
the central place. Only after ex

Library was built on the eastern
side of Quad.
IT HAS BEEN said of Harvard
University, "If all the faculty and
students departed, and all th e
buildings except Weidner Library
burnt down, this would still be
a great university."
Perhaps Lewis Spitz. Associate
Professor of History, puts it best:
"Faculties die in a foreseeable
future. Students graduate. But
libraries arc for keeps."
"And the Library is the Achil

the soft underbelly," Spitz says.

been casually acquired. There aiv
deficiencies in academy publica
