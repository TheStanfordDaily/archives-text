# LASSU PROPOSAL
## Grad Government? 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
Approval of a new Graduate
Student Association to replace
the Graduate Student Club is ex
pected by LASSU tonight. The
Association was first proposed at
the last meeting of the Legisla
ture. Monday night the Associa
tion was approved by the By-Laws
Committee.
Tom Tisch, one of the sponsors
of the idea, said, "The Associa
tion will bring to life a formal, fi
nancially able framework for co
ordinating and sponsoring gradu
ate' student activity."
He further pointed out that
although "nearly half ihe student
body is composed of grad stu
dents, Stanford as yet has no stu
dent interest group catering to
the needs and interests of grad
students.
The Association will provide a
pre-reg program for graduate
students, organize informal gath
srings of those students, and pro
vide formal programs for ex
change of ideas among them.

It will absorb the Graduate Stu
dent Club, which, in the past, has
held the Graduate Coffee Hours,
Graduate Happy Hours, and sev
eral pre-reg programs, as well as
sponsoring other events.
The administrative board of the
commission will consist of one stu
dent from each of the graduate
schools, and three additional mem
bers chosen by the board. Other
officers will include a Chairman,
Secretary, and Treasurer.
The membership of the Asso
ciation would be every graduate
student enrolled in the Univer
sity. "The Graduate Student Club,
whose duties it will absorb, has
only a few active members." Tisch
said.
Should the Legislature approve
the Association, meetings for
graduate students will be held
early in Spring Quarter for the
purpose of planning a program,
Tisch said.
Other business to be discussed
by LASSU includes the $300 Civil
Rights Secretariat appropriation
which was tabled at the last meet-

iing for further thought, and an
| appropriation for a course evalua
(ion publication.
The Seretariat has been planned
I to serve as an information een
-1 ter for students interested in civil
rights activity, especially in Mis
sissippi.
The change in University open
house regulations will probably
also come up. The IHC has man
dated Steve Martingale to discuss
the matter in the legislature.
ASSU president Bud Wedin said
of the regulations. "There has
been considerable concern about
the change among the Legislature
members with whom I've spoken."
An NSA report by Rich Stearns
and Jim Haas is also scheduled,
and some discussion is expected.
Wedin also said that there is a
possibility that Speaker Brad
Efron may appoint someone to
investigate the Stanford Line a r
Accelerator Powerline dispute,
and to report to LASSU on 1 he
problem.
The meeting will lie held at 7:30
I p.m. in Room 320. geology corner.
