# CORE Calls Off Shop-ins After Widespread Protest
## 
### 
Shop-in demonstrations against Lucky Supermarkets were
called oil yesterday by CORE after nine successive afternoon ses
sions. The announcement by a CORE spokesman followed a threat
by the 4(),00()-member Negro Baptist Ministers Union to split with
CORE unless the shop-ins ceased.
Shop-ins entail filling baskets with groceries, wheeling them
up to check stands, then leaving*

them unpaid for. The demonstra
tions were staged because CORE
charged Lucky Stores with dis
crimination in hiring Negroes.
Lucky management has denied
the charge.
Anti-CORE demonstrations were
made by students from the Berke
ley and USE campuses, who put
the groceries back on the shelves
as soon as CORE members h a d
stacked them on the check stands.
Also, many of the students sat on
the check stands so that CORE
baskets of groceries could no 1
pass to the registers for tabula
tion. The few students interviewed
indicated that they had nothing
against the purpose of the demon
stration, but that the method was
highly displeasing.
Both CORE and the Union still
claim that Lucky Stores has
failed to abide by an agreement
to hire more Negroes. A spokes
man for the chain-store firm said
t liiit the company had never
agreed to any hiring formula of

this kind, and also that Lucky
Stores had never practiced racial
discrimination in the first place.
CORE cited Safeway Stores'
hiring 40 percent non-white clerks
in the last three months as an ex
ample of the progress they seek.
Since Lucky Stores had not fol
lowed their agreement in any
such manner, CORE felt that eco
nomic harassment was their only
effective means of protest.
CORE also stated that thieve
are plenty of qualified applicants
if Lucky Stores would just take
the trouble to contact various
minority specialists in employ
ment.
