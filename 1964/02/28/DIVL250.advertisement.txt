SUFFERINGS
OF THE
SAVIOUR
Crucifixion is considered by many medical experts to be the most
agonizing form of torture known, for the victim slowly suffocates to
death while enduring excrutiating pain. During the time of Christ's
earthly ministry, death on the cross was the most shameful mode of
punishment, reserved for the worst criminals and the most despised
men.
We shall never comprehend the inner sufferings of Jesus on the cross J
: of Calvary as "He who knew no sin was made to be sin for us"; for
I Me voluntarily bore in His body the sins of the entire world so that a
way to eternal life might be opened up between lost mankind and a Cod
who is holy and just. Through the Inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the j
Psalmist foresaw the crucifixion of Jesus almost 1000 years before il
occurred and vividly portrayed His great sacrifice for us:
'"My Cod, my Cod, why hast thou foresaken me? Why art thou so
far from helping me and from the words of my roaring? () my Cod, I
cry in the daytime but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and
ain not silent. But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitcst the praises of
Israel. Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver s
them. They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee,
and were not confounded. But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach !
of men, and despised of the people. All they that see me laugh me to
scorn: They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted
on the IiOrd that lie would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing ho
delighted in him. But thou art ho that took me out of the womb: thou
didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's belly. Be not far
from me- for trouble is near; for there is none to help. Many bulls
have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. They
gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.
1 am poured out like water, and all mv bones are out of joint: my heart
is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. My strength is dried
up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast
brought me into the dust of death. For dogs have compassed me: the
assembly of the wicked have enclosed me; they pierced my hands and
my feet. 1 may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me. They
part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. But be
not thou far from me, O Lord: O my strength, haste thee to help me."
Psalm 22:1-19.
Many people deny the fact that it was man's disobedience to Cod
which made necessary the substitutionary atoning sacrifice of Christ.
However, prophecies of Christ's death for our sins appear throughout
the Old Testament and are fulfilled in the New Testament.
"Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord
revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as
a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when
we sliall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. Tie is
despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with
grief: and w r e hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and
we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our
sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of Cod, and afflicted.
But he was wounded lor our transgressions, he was bruised for our in
iquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him: and with his
stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have
turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the
iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened
not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep
before her shearers is dumb, so he opentli not his mouth. He was taken
from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation?
for he was cut out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my
people was he stricken. And he made his grave with the wicked, and
with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was
any deceit in his month. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath
put him to grief: when thou shall make his soul an offering for sin, he
shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the
Lord shall prosper in his hand." Isaiah 53:1-10.
"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached
I unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; . . . how
Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was
buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scrip
tures:" I Corinthians 15:1-4.
How does Christ's astoning death apply to us today? God is satisfied
with Christ's sacrifice and has reconciled the world to Himself. But, as
in every reconciliation, both parties must agree to reconcile. Therefore, I
"We beseech you ... be ye reconciled to Cod."
