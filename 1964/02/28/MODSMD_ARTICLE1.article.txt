putting together a comprehensive document
on the Viet Nam situation.
He said that whether the campaign should
be carried into Red territory "is a question
for the future."

• LliJ Orders RR Crackdown
Lyndon B. Johnson publicly opened his
presidential campaign last night witli a strong

eager for the campaign.
Johnson swept in from the North to ad
dress a $100-a-plate fund-raising dinner.
