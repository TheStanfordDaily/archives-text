STANFORD < OAC II Howip
Dalmar classifies forward Raaka,
an essential rebounder, as a
doubtful starter because of the
ankle injury he suffered in last
week's UCLA game. The bum foot
kept him out of Monday night's
win over USC.
Indian center Tom Dose, only
1() points shy of Ron Tomsic's all
time Stanford varsity record, will
Le up against a fine defensive per
former in Washington's Clint
Peoples. Peoples held Dose to two
of his lowest point productions in
the previous Tribe-Husky action.
STANFORD MUST win in Seat
tle and again over Washington
State Monday night in ihe Pavil
ion if it is io remain in contention
for second place in the Big Six.
Should Stanford win a pair
while Cal splits against UCLA and
Washington State, as appears
likely, next Friday's clash in Stan

currently 7-5 in conference play,
while Cal is 84.
