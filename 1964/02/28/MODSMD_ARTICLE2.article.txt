# Craig Criticizes Library Research Material Gap
## 
### BILL SMITH Associate Editor (Second in a Series 
A graduate student in his
tory approached Professor
Cordon Craig" with a request
lor some help on a research
problem in (■ernian history in
the period 1850-1860. Craig
gave him I lie names of the
eight standard works in this
area and sent him to (lie Li
brary. The student returned
more than an hour later. The
Library had none of these
"standard" works.
"In history," Craig said,
"we really are dependent on
what's in the Library. We
don't need machines or equip
ment ; what we need most of
all arc books and magazines
and collections of local jour
nals, satirical magazines."
"This graduate student bad
to go to the University of
California at Berkeley to find
the books he needed," Craig
said. "And more and more
and more students, and fac
ulty, have to make arrange
ments with Berkeley to do re
search. This is ridiculous."
"Unless this problem is
remedied, we will not be able
to catch up, and in twenty
years, we will not l»e able to
support g ra d ua tc study,"
Craig said.
"There are little islands of
material that astound you,"
he said, "but there are great,
gaping holes. In the field ot
history, we have a pretty fair
selection of secondary ma
terials, books. In off i c i a I
papers and documents, we are
iu fair shape, but there are
astonishing holes. And in the
level of scholarly magazines,
we have only the obvious, and
not all of those."
"The reasons for this arc
readily apparent," Craig said.
"If you depend on professors
to work for your library, it
will be spotty,with good col*

lections in the professor's
sjH'ciality and nothing else.
This problem can only Ih
checked by having an ade
quate staff and by spending a
lot of money."
"I do believe that the only
thing to save the Library, in
the field I'm interested in, is
to spend more money. Al
ready it is difficult to do good
work in certain fields in his
tory," Craig said "And it will
become increasingly so, until,
eventually, we will pass t li e
point of no return. And it isn't
only grad students. It's amaz
ing how many undergrads
want to work and just can't
get the books."
"The University is one
piece. And the Library must
be the center, as it is even
now in its weak state," Craig
said. "The undergrads gain
from the graduates. If a pro
fessor finds that something
works well with graduates, he
uses it with his undergrads
too, in lectures and seminars.
The research function keeps
professors alive profession
ally and adds materials and
makes lectures more interest
ing. But all Ibis hinges oil a
good library."
"If the materials aren't
there, you have to go get
them," Craig said.
But going to get them here
at Stanford is the problem. II
you find a series you need for
graduate and undergraduate
research and study, then you
must l>e able to get it. At
Stanford, Craig says, "you
have always got to count the
damn pennies."
"Spending the amount on
libraries that they do here,"
Craig said, "is not the way to
make a great library or a
great University. The amount
must increase, or else they
will wake up one morning ami
find that they cannot support
graduate work here."
