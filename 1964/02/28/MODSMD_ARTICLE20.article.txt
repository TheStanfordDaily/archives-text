# Bear, Indian Ruggers Battle For Scrum Axe Tomorrow
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
The best Stanford and Cal teams
ever will square off Saturday in
a rugby duel that promises to be
the most exciting game at Stan
ford this year or perhaps any
year. Both fifteens are undefeated
and boast proven talent at every
posit ion.
Coaching Stanford to a 7 0 mark
so far this season, Pete Kmeto
vie considers this year's squad the
best he's had in 14 years of coach
ing because of the experience he
has at every position and because
of the team's scoring potential.
CAL, MORE defense-minded
Ihan the offensively mighty In
dians, lias top-notch ball handlers
and kickers but only a fair to
good array of running talent on
its rushing line.
The Bear back field consists of
a South African, two New Zea
landers, the top rusher on the
frosh football team, and football
halfback Tom Blanch field.
Blanchfield, in his first rugby
season, has added kicking and run

ning talent to the Cal squad.
Against University of British
Columbia, he scored 18 of his
team's 21 points with a combina
tion of tries, extra points, and
penalty kicks.
GORDON WADDELL and Steve
Van Nort spearhead an Indian at
tack which can match the Cal
line in ball handling ability but
has more speed and more experi
ence playing together. Stanford's
defense is unproven this year and
is the only question mark in its
overall game.
More than likely, both of
the games will lie won or lost in
scrum duels. Getting the ball will
be a tough task as hooker Ron
Fraboni will have important foot
duels with New Zealander War
ren Moyes in the scrum and Dick
Leeuwenberg will do battle for
the lineout tosses with big Larry
Lowell and bigger Jim Anderson,
Cal's football captain this year.
Stanford plays Cal twice this
year, and the team with the high
est point total in both games gets
Ihe Big Scrum Axe, a perpetual
trophy in existence for only three
years.
The winner will be able to claim
with little dissent not only that
it has the best team on the coast
but in the Western Hemisphere.

The best Stanford and Cal teams
ever will square off Saturday in
a rugby duel that promises to be
the most exciting game at Stan
ford this year or perhaps any
year. Both fifteens are undefeated
and boast proven talent at every
posit ion.
Coaching Stanford to a 7 0 mark
so far this season, Pete Kmeto
vie considers this year's squad the
best he's had in 14 years of coach
ing because of the experience he
has at every position and because
of the team's scoring potential.
CAL, MORE defense-minded
Ihan the offensively mighty In
dians, lias top-notch ball handlers
and kickers but only a fair to
good array of running talent on
its rushing line.
The Bear back field consists of
a South African, two New Zea
landers, the top rusher on the
frosh football team, and football
halfback Tom Blanch field.
Blanchfield, in his first rugby
season, has added kicking and run

ning talent to the Cal squad.
Against University of British
Columbia, he scored 18 of his
team's 21 points with a combina
tion of tries, extra points, and
penalty kicks.
GORDON WADDELL and Steve
Van Nort spearhead an Indian at
tack which can match the Cal
line in ball handling ability but
has more speed and more experi
ence playing together. Stanford's
defense is unproven this year and
is the only question mark in its
overall game.
More than likely, both of
the games will lie won or lost in
scrum duels. Getting the ball will
be a tough task as hooker Ron
Fraboni will have important foot
duels with New Zealander War
ren Moyes in the scrum and Dick
Leeuwenberg will do battle for
the lineout tosses with big Larry
Lowell and bigger Jim Anderson,
Cal's football captain this year.
Stanford plays Cal twice this
year, and the team with the high
est point total in both games gets
Ihe Big Scrum Axe, a perpetual
trophy in existence for only three
years.
The winner will be able to claim
with little dissent not only that
it has the best team on the coast
but in the Western Hemisphere.
