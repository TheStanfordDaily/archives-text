# CORE Harms Reputation By Sponsoring Shop-Ins
## Editorial 
### 
The Council of Racial Equality (CORE)
has badly tarnished its reputation and civil
rights efforts in general by sponsoring "shop
ins' against the Lucky grocery store chain
this past week—in which carts were filled
with goods, wheeled up to the cheek stand
and left unpaid for.
Fortunately, the organization announced
Wednesday that it was calling off the dem
onstrations against alleged discriminatory
hiring practices in the Lucky Stores.
We protest the "shop-ins" — and for that

matter, the "stroll-ins'' (in which the demon
strator merely ties up the carts for a long
period, then leaves after buying one item)
—because they smack too much of bully tac
tics.
One Lucky Store manager estimated it
cost $50 a night to clean up the store after
the "shop-ins," replace destroyed property
and restack the groceries.
And, besides, the effect has been disast
rous. At USF and Berkeley, anti-CORE
demonstrations were held in which students

—many of whom said they were sympathe
tic to the CORE cause — put the groceries
back on the shelves after the CORE partici
pants had placed them on the check stands.
Protest against the demonstration tactics
became so widespread earlier this week that
the 40,000-Inember Negro Baptist Ministers
Union threatened to split with CORF.
We think the civil rights organization

would have been far wiser to have aired its
grievances through picketing, boycotts and
other unobnoxious forms of protest.
