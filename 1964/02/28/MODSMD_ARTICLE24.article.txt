# Discrimination In Reverse
## 
### 
Although we agree wholeheartedly willi
many of COllE's objectives, we disagree
with its policy of advocating that stores hire
a specified quota of Negroes. This has been

the basis of its complaint against the Lucky
Stores, which, claims CORE, have failed to
hire a certain number of Negroes.
We go along with the late President Ken
nedy's view 011 this matter — that it is just
as discriminatory to hire a man because oi
his race as it is not to hire him for such. Wo
believe die objective of civil rights groups
should be to encourage people not to think
in terms of race, but in terms of individuals.
And a quota system—such as Core sup
ports—defeats this aim.
