## Kazan's 'America, America' Combines Know-How, Artistry 
### Foster Hirsch 
Concerning his new film, "America, America," Elia Kazan lias
said that lie alone is responsible for any shortcomings it may have.
Indeed, Kazan has persuaded a major Hollywood studio to
give him complete control over his own film, and he has used
liis solo venture' to create that rarity, an American film which
combines the technical know-how of Hollywood with the artistry
and depth of the best European product.
"America, America" recounts the rites of passage of an im
poverished Greek youth (Kazan's uncle) from his native Turkey
to America, the land where lie hopes to be "washed clean.' The
sincereity and intensity with which Kazan recreates this bit oi
family history makes us continual participants in the young man's
odyssey.

THE SIMPLE, MOVING STORY and Kazan's articulate script
are themselves enough to commend attention, but it is the skill
with which Kazan adapts his content to the film medium that is
most noteworthy. To be sure, no other art form could make Stav
ros' story so vivid and immediate. Shot on location, the film
makes real the world through which Stavros travels.
The small Turkish towns, the stark countryside, bristling Con
stantinople at the turn of the century in both its squalor and
upper-class extravagance are all authentically captured by Haskell
Wexlers striking photography. Time and again, Wexlers camera
focuses on native peasants and customs; these photographic di
gressions, rather than impeding the progress of the plot, add color
to Stravros' journey. Further, W'exler uses extreme long-shots and
close-ups and contrasts of light and shadow to enhance the beauty
and meaning of each scene.
The score of Manos Hadjidakis, who wrote the music for
"Never on Sunday," also contributes to the authenticity. His music
is genuinely middle-Eastern; it is not an approximation or a rein
terpretation in Western terms by a Hollywood composer. An
integral part of the film, it underscores and complements the prin
ciple emotional movements.
Kazan, who always manipulates his actors skillfully, here ac
complishes the difficult task of making them appear at one with
the authentic surroundings. With the exception of Starves (per
formed with determination and personality by newcomers Stathis
Giallelis), all the characters are performed by actors recruited
from the Broadway stage. They speak in an assortment of New
York accents which at first seems at odds with the Greek and
Turkish characters they portray; nevertheless, their faultless per
formances manage to erase the incongruity.
"America, America is long and the pace, for the most part,
is leisurely, yet because of the constant sense of movement, it never
becomes tiresome. In addition to the fluid photography, the com
plex editing reinforces the film's mobility. At times, one scene will
cut rapidly into the next or a carefully executed dissolve will move
one scene gracefully into another.
There are no credits at the beginning of "America, America;
instead, Kazan introduces his cast and technical assistants at the
end for the separate bows which each of them deserves. It is obvi
ous that the making of the film was to tlieni all a task of religious
dedication. To Kazan himself, it was a love song to his uncle
and the millions of other immigrants w ho sought freedom in a new
land, and to the appreciative viewer it is truly an experience long
to be remembered.
