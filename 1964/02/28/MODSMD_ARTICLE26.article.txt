# 'Stroll-In' Demonstration Technique Explained

Editor, The Daily:
The Daily's story of Feb. 25
on Mid - Peninsula CORE'S
weekend cl e m onst r a t i ons
against Lucky Stores carries
an erroneous definition of the
"stroll-in" te c h niq u c used
against two local Lucky out
lets.
The Palo Alto Times article
of Feb. 24, which appears in
all other respects to be the
basis for Miss Bozman's story,
correctly defines the "stroll
in" as tying up shopping bas
kets for as long as possible by
each participant, then leaving
after purchasing only a single
item. No other groceries are
taken from shelves without be
ing replaced by the demonstra
tors. There is no "... filling
shopping carts, strolling
through the store, and then
leaving without a single item"
as The Daily states. This tactic
is the "shop-in," and the bas
kets of goods are take n
through the checkout stands
(if possible) and then left.
Mid-Peninsula CORE has not
yet "shopped-in" and will de
cide whether or not to do so
when the results of further
negotiations with Lucky Stores
are learned.

Editor's Note: The letter was
written before the shop-ins in
other Lucky Stores were called
off Wednesday.
• Fair Hiring
Editor, The Daily:
The article in Tuesday's
Daily concerning the stroll-ins
at two Peninsula stores reflect
ed, as many civil-rights articles
have in the past, the fact that
it is just as much discrimina
tion to hire a man because he
is a member of a certain race,
in- or out-group, etc., as it is to
not hire him for the same rea
sons.
There is no easy solution to
the problem of fair hiring. It
is the responsibility of the
owner or manager of a store
to obtain the best qualified em
ployees he can. Hopefully, he
will do this without regard to
the group or groups to which
a prospective employee be
longs. But, he alone is the man
who can make this decision;

and pressure from any outside
group, including the NAACP
or CORE, to force him to con
sider a prospective employee's
race in making his decision is
diametrically opposed to equal
ity and non-discrimination.

• Trustee Barnett
Editor, The Daily:
A few days ago J received a
letter from a friend in South
ern California which I think
will find sympathy among
many Stanford students. It
reads:
This concerns the death of
Mcdgar Evcrs in Mississippi.
There are several needs that
follow his tragic shooting: 1 i
his family needs help; 2> a
large group of Americans
need lo express their position
on this matter; 3> we need
to say something effective to
I he governor and people of Mis
sissippi.
"An idea has been conceived
by some of our friends that
might accomplish these three
purposes in one act. We pro
pose to flood Governor Bar
nett's desk with envelopes con
taining checks for $1, which
will automatically make hi m
trustee of money that he can
deliver only to the Evers fam
ily. An attorney says that the
checks should be made out ex
actly as follows: "Ross Bar
nett, Trustee of Memorial Fund
of Family of Medgar Evers."
They should be mailed to "Gov
ernor Ross Barnett. State Capi
tol. Jackson, Mississipi."
The letter concludes by urg
ing thai all those interested in
so manifesting their concern
should write to any and all
friends whom they feel would
also be interested. Were (his
to be done, within a few weeks
Ihe governor would have on his
desk thousands of envelopes
bearing witness to this national
protest.

Editor's Note: Letters writ
ten as directed above are not
illegal as are the ones reported
in yesterday's national news
section of the Daily. Those are

illegal because they are chain
letters, a form of lottery. An
official of the Post Office In
spection Office yesterday told
tiie Daily that letters written
in the form directed above
would not be chain letters, lie
warned, however, that letters
are unmailahle if addresssed
to "Ross Barnett, Trustee of
Memorial Fund of Family of
Medgar Evers" because they
would be defamatory to char
acter.
• Apathy Overcome
Editor, The Daily:
What is all this talk about
apathy these days? . . . what is
the source of this plague? If
apathy it must be that we over
come. how?
The village newspaper has
prepared the way — Ihe slum
bering mas s e s have been
nudged, the more conscious
ones have begun to open their
eyes. Now the 10 percent min
ority has to keep them awake,
but what wil be the no-doz for
the masses?
Let's look around. What's
keping that 10 percent awake?
Is il not the war in Viet Nam,
power lines on the horizon,
military recruitment on the
campus, discrimination in local
supermarkets? What have all
these activists got in Common?
They are all against, opposed
to. protesting something. We
are all for integration, but
what is more important is that
we are against segregation.
Surely, il is more important
that Mr. Goldwater is against
nearly everything than that her
is for something if, indeed, he
is for anything.
. ... If the village newspaper
wants to do il share in combat
ting the plague why not find
something for tht 90 per cent
of the masses to complain
about, to protest, to be against,
to be opposed to?
Turn the LASSU into an or
ganization of protest, or, better
yet, do way with it entirely;
protest against Goldwater if
you can't protest with him;
protest uglification of land
scapes; overturn the naval
van; tear down the flag; storm
Ihe Bastille!
