## Pretty Words 'Justify' Women's Housing Policy 
### Vivian Bozman 
' Stanford is described by university publications as a "residen
tial university, a ''campus" university, in keeping with the image
of the Stanford "family and/or "community.
These are pleasant-sounding words which do a line job of in
| spiring prospective freshmen to seriously consider becoming a part
of the organic Stanford community, but these words are also lorced
to serve a function which pretty words without much meaning can
not come close to achieving. This function is serving as justifica
tion for a university policy which prohibits all unmarried, undcr
| graduate women under the age of 23 from living oil campus.
The facts deny the validity of the pretty words. It is dilticult to
j call Stanford a "residential" university when a housing office esti
i mate shows that, out of an enrollment of 7,5()0 men, about .'>,()()()
'single men do not partieipatein the "residential university pro
• gram.
II Stanford is in any way a "residential campus, it is so, not by
: voluntary choice: of the members of the student body, but by an
: arbitarary ruling which has been in effect so long that its only
justification today is that it exists— Undergaduate women must live
lon campus because Stanford is a residential university; Stanford is
a residential university because undergraduate women must live
I on campus.

STANFORD WOMEN do not seek to emigrate off campus en
mass in order to engage in activities which would irrevocably cut
them off from the university community. All that is asked is con
sideration of the question of off-campus housing for undergraduate
women above the age of 21, who, as defined by United States law,
are legally adults.
A woman who has enjoyed the many benefits ol contact with
varied types of people in university dormitories for two or three
years, may conceivably also desire the experience of independent
living with friends of her own choice. When forced to live on
campus by a university ruling, she is unlikely to be one of the more
active and contributing members of her house. Campus spirit, it
this is the goal of the residential policy', is far more likely to be
' achieved if living groups are smaller, but are occupied by girls,
: w ho given a choice, decide by their own free w ill to live there.
Ol course, though, there is the inherent problem ol unoccupied
i rooms and unpaid room and board fees in womens dormitories.
1 By forcing women to live on campus, the university assures itself of
a definite amount of money every year, especially important in the
j face of the fact that it is impossible to determine how many under
graduate men will decide to live off campus each year.
We have been told that at Stanford change is slow; we assume,
, however, that this does not exclude the possibility of consideration
of change at this time and at least rational justification for an exist
i ing policy.
