# San Mateo Planners Consider Modified Lines
## 
### 
San Mateo Count) planning commissioners will meet March V)
to consider approval of 65-foot single tubular poles to carry power
lines to the Stanford Linear Accelerator.
The poles were originally suggested by SLAC officials to meet
public objections to the dual-circuit, six-wire, 120-foot towers

which will be installed if no com
promise is agreed upon.
THE COUNTY Commissioners
will be meeting at 8 a.m. on the
day that the Atomic Energy Com
mission has set as the absolute
deadline for alternative proposals

'tot he 120-foot towers.
In addition to the new power
pole design, the Planning Com
missioner will bo considering a
route for the lines which would
be less destructive to the scenic
I beauty of the countryside than
j the one now planned.
INSTEAD OF running down
ithe mountainside through l htÂ»
heavily wooded areas, the line
would parallel the Junipero Serra
j Freeway right-of-way.
The latest action by San Mateo
I County officials is in reaction to
the refusal of the University, the
I Atomic Energy Commission and
the Pacific G;is and Electric Com
pany to provide the $3.6 million
necessary for a 300 megawatt
underground line.
THE UNIVERSITY refused to
appropriate any money for th e
underground lines, while the AEC
j has indicated that it will supply
no more than $220,000.
Woodside voted to quadruple its
tax rates to raise $150,000 and
PG&E will put up $1,012,000, but
j the $1.4 million total is $2.2 mil
lion short of the needed amount.
THE COMMITTEE on G re c n
Foothills is continuing its efforts
Ito secure underground lines by
[posting petitions on dormitory
| and departmental bulletin boards
i encouraging the AEC to accept
the University's proposal that it
I put up the funds.
