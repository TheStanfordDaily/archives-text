### STEVE GRUBER 
Sanford M. Dornbusch, profes
sor of sociology, announced yes
terday that he would step down
as Sociology Department head at
the end of this quarter.
"You get bored with the .job
alter five years." stated Dr. Dorn
busch. He will remain as a pro
fessor of Sociology.
MO Kit IS ZKLDITCH, Jit.,
presently associate professor of
sociology, has been appointed to
replace Dornbusch. Dr. Zelditch
is in Florence

Dornb us eh
came to Stan
ford from Har
vard five years
ago, bringing
four other pro
fessors with him.
Of t hose four,
professors Scott,
Cohen, and Ber-

ger are still at Stanford.
Professor Dornb us c h also
stated that he felt he should de
vote more time to teaching and
to his research. "I think I cre
ated a good environment for
everybody to do research except
me," he commented. "The depart
ment head is more a servant than
anything else."
BEFOUL DORNBUSCH c a m e
to Stanford, the Sociology De
partment had four professors.
With the addition of the group
from Harvard, the department
jumped to nine men and since
that time has increased to twelve.
Professor Dornbusch rates his
department as the best in only
some areas. "We have made no
attempt to be all things to all
men," he said. "However, the
quality of our faculty is spectac
ular. It is also one of the young
est departments at the Univer
sity. At 38, I am considered one
of the old men around here."
Undergraduate instruction is
the department's biggest prob
lem now. according to Dorn
busch. He hopes to make im
provements in this area now that
he will not have to devote as
much time to paperwork.
Dornbusch also expressed a
desire to get back to research
while he still feels creative. He
said that for the first part of his
tenure as department head he
thought that was the most cre
ative position in the department.
