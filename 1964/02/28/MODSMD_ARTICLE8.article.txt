The confidence of people inside and out
side East Africa has been shaken by the re
cent army mutinies in Tanganyika, Kenya,
and Uganda. What should be made clear,
however, is that the mutinies were not di
rected against the governments of the East
African countries. The armies mutinied to
remedy two grievances, low pay and the slow
rate of promotion of African officers.
The first mutiny took place in Tangan
yika shortly after the revolution in Zanzibar.
Whether there was any connection between
the two events is still unknown, but un
doubtedly (lie ease with which arms accom
plished their job in Zanzibar must have been
suggestive to the troops twenty miles away
on the mainland.
THE STKANCIE Till NO about the sol
diers* demands was not the demands them
selves but the method the soldiers chose to
achieve them. They arrested their British
officers and sent them out of the country in
airplanes, armed themselves, and then pro
ceeded to take over key points in the capital.
Meanwhile, in the absence of any state
ment by the government, rumors spread
through Dar cs Suium. Some said the Mill

isters had left the capital, others that the
government had been toppled. Believing all
authority had collapsed, lawless persons took
advantage of the situation. Looting of shops
took place, and Africans clashed with Arabs.
After two days the mutiny seemed over,
tor the army had obtained its demands. But
a few days later there were reports of fur
ther indiscipline at the barracks in Dares
Salaam. The government decided to end the
threat to stability once and for all. Nyercre
called in British troops from ships standing
offshore and the mutineers were subdued
wit it li' < ic difficulty.
IN KKNYA, only a pari of one of the
three battalions mutinied. Prime Minister
Kenyata immediately ordered British troops,
which arc still stationed in Kenya with the
agreement of the government. t<> surround
and disarm the mutinous battalion. As in
Tanganyika, the mutineers were easily sub
dued. Kenya!ta later announced that the mil
liners would be dealt with according to mili
tary law.
In Uganda, as in Kenya, only part of the
army mutinied. The mutiny took a mild form,
members of two companies simply refusing
to obey their British and African officers
and requesting to see the Minister of Inter
nal Affairs,
Prime Minister Obote, however, ordered
police to set up road blocks between Jin.jn,
the site of the army barracks, and Kampala,
the capital, fifty miles away. With his own

loyal security forces spread tluii covering
several "hot spots" in Uganda and along its
borders, he requested that British troops be
flown in from Kenya.
THE WISDOM of the Prime Minister's
action was soon shown, for shortly after
ward the mutineers once again refused to
obey orders. The government therefore
asked the British troops to seize control of
the army camp at Jinja, which they did in a
pre dawn sortie.
The mutinies have emphasized once again
the desire for complete Africanization of all
government activity. About a month previous
to the mutinies President Nyercre had an
nounced that racial discrimination, discrimi
nation in favor of Africans, would end in the
Tanganyika government. His announcement
met with widespread criticism, and certainly
contributed to the belief of the army in Tan
ganyika that the way to dispense with Brit
ish officers was by force.
What then does the future hold? Might
not the armies, commanded by Africans, de
cide in a few years t«» mutiny again, perhaps
iu overthrow the government? It is this
thought which has prompted President
Nyerere to call for a meeting of the defence
and foreign ministers of the African states.
He would like to see a mutual defence agree
ment set up so that army disturbances could
be put down by calling in troops from other
African states rather than from Western
nations.

The confidence of people inside and out
side East Africa has been shaken by the re
cent army mutinies in Tanganyika, Kenya,
and Uganda. What should be made clear,
however, is that the mutinies were not di
rected against the governments of the East
African countries. The armies mutinied to
remedy two grievances, low pay and the slow
rate of promotion of African officers.
The first mutiny took place in Tangan
yika shortly after the revolution in Zanzibar.
Whether there was any connection between
the two events is still unknown, but un
doubtedly (lie ease with which arms accom
plished their job in Zanzibar must have been
suggestive to the troops twenty miles away
on the mainland.
THE STKANCIE Till NO about the sol
diers* demands was not the demands them
selves but the method the soldiers chose to
achieve them. They arrested their British
officers and sent them out of the country in
airplanes, armed themselves, and then pro
ceeded to take over key points in the capital.
Meanwhile, in the absence of any state
ment by the government, rumors spread
through Dar cs Suium. Some said the Mill

isters had left the capital, others that the
government had been toppled. Believing all
authority had collapsed, lawless persons took
advantage of the situation. Looting of shops
took place, and Africans clashed with Arabs.
After two days the mutiny seemed over,
tor the army had obtained its demands. But
a few days later there were reports of fur
ther indiscipline at the barracks in Dares
Salaam. The government decided to end the
threat to stability once and for all. Nyercre
called in British troops from ships standing
offshore and the mutineers were subdued
wit it li' < ic difficulty.
IN KKNYA, only a pari of one of the
three battalions mutinied. Prime Minister
Kenyata immediately ordered British troops,
which arc still stationed in Kenya with the
agreement of the government. t<> surround
and disarm the mutinous battalion. As in
Tanganyika, the mutineers were easily sub
dued. Kenya!ta later announced that the mil
liners would be dealt with according to mili
tary law.
In Uganda, as in Kenya, only part of the
army mutinied. The mutiny took a mild form,
members of two companies simply refusing
to obey their British and African officers
and requesting to see the Minister of Inter
nal Affairs,
Prime Minister Obote, however, ordered
police to set up road blocks between Jin.jn,
the site of the army barracks, and Kampala,
the capital, fifty miles away. With his own

loyal security forces spread tluii covering
several "hot spots" in Uganda and along its
borders, he requested that British troops be
flown in from Kenya.
THE WISDOM of the Prime Minister's
action was soon shown, for shortly after
ward the mutineers once again refused to
obey orders. The government therefore
asked the British troops to seize control of
the army camp at Jinja, which they did in a
pre dawn sortie.
The mutinies have emphasized once again
the desire for complete Africanization of all
government activity. About a month previous
to the mutinies President Nyercre had an
nounced that racial discrimination, discrimi
nation in favor of Africans, would end in the
Tanganyika government. His announcement
met with widespread criticism, and certainly
