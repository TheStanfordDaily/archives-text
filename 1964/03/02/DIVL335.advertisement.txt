"JESUS CHRIST: i
THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY,
AND FOREVER"
"In tln- beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Clod, and the Word
was God . . . And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us . . . " John
1:1, 14.
While some people believe that God has evolved as man's concepts have
changed, the God of the Bible is everywhere revealed to he changeless anil eternal.
His revelation of Himself to man has been progressive since the fall.
"I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains
abounding with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was
J brought forth: While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the
highest part of the dust of the world. When he prepared the reavens I was there:
when lie set a compass upon the face of the depth: When he established the clouds
above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: when lie gave to the
sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he ap
pointed the foundations of the earth: Then 1 was by him, as one brought up with
him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; rejoicing in the
habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. Now
therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my
ways. Hear instruction, and he wise, and refuse it not. Blessed is the mail that
heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. For
who so findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the Lord. But he that
sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death."
Proverbs 8:23-36.
In the Old Testment as well as the New, we see ample evidence that Jesus
Christ who visited our planet 2000 years ago was the very God who created it!
In his letter to the Colossians Paul reminds the Christians that Christ came to
this planet for a purpose, and that He has every right to His title and position as
Lord of all:
"Now Christ is the visible expression of the invisible God. He existed before
creation began, for it was through him that everything was made, whether spiritual
or material, seen or unseen. Through him, and for him also were created power
and dominion, ownership and authority. In fact, every single thing was created
through, and for him. He is both the first principle and the upholding principle
of the whole scheme of creation. And now he is the head of the body which is
the Church. Life from nothing began through him, and life from the dead began
through him, and he is, therefore, justly called the Lord of all. It was in him
that the full nature of God chose to live, and through him God planned to recon
cile in his own person, as it were, everything on earth and everything in Heaven
by virtue of the sacrifice of the cross. And you yourselves, who were strangers
to God. and, in fact through the evil things you had done, his spiritual enemies,
he has now reconciled through the death of his body oil the cross, so that he might
welcome you to his presence clean and pure, without blame or reproach." Col.
1:13-21, Phillips.
