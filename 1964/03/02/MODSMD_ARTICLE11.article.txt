# New System Yields Jazz A La IBM
## 
### BOB BJORING 
A student sat at a typewriter
in the Computation Center a n d
pecked out a set of mysterious
symbols. A digital computer
nearby fed out a short piece of
gray tape. He put the tape back
through the machine, then
shook his head and began to look
over what he had typed. Then an
idea struck him, and he typed oul
a new set of symbols. When he
fed the tape back through, th e
scope obliged him with an ellipse
and a major musical chord. Smil
ing, he produced a jazz piece in
about thirty minutes.
The student was using a new
system introduced at the Stan
ford Computation Center called
"Time-sharing." Formerly, he
would have had to punch out a
;et of cards, try out his synthetic
nusic program, correct his errors,
then type out a new set of cards.
With "Time-sharing" he commu
nicated directly with the machine
by the use of a teletype. He could
correct his mistakes as he made
them. Although his program was

fairly simple anrl the time saved
small, "Time-sharing" can mean
extra days and sometimes months
to people with complicated pro
grams.
ANOTHER ADVANTAGE of
the new system is that it can
work simultaneously on as many
as 12 problems. The machine does
not need to work very hard re
ceiving the instructions for a
problem, and while the student
was typing out his directions, an
unknown history professor could
have been receiving answers to
his income tax questions via tele
type. Machines with cards can
handle only one problem at a
time.
The Stanford system is not the
first of its kind. Prof. McCarthy
of the Computer Science Divi
sion, who is coordinating the proj
ect, has previously developed a
similar set-up for Bolt, Beranek,
and Newman in Cambridge. There
are also "Time-sharing" systems
at M.I.T. and other places. Mr.
Steve Russel, a programmer at
the Computation Center, said,
however, that the Stanford sys
tem shows a number of advances

over its predecessors, particularly
in its applications.
There will be a lot of work be
fore the machine is finally ready
Mr. Russel explained that all com
puters have "bugs" which can
only be removed after continual
use and correction. But ho be
lieves that within a few years the
"Time-sharing" system should be
ready to handle problems coming
in from all over campus on tele
type wires. A man is working
now on a translation device that
would permit problems to be sent
in in words.
WHEN ASKED ABOUT the
machine's "intelligence" Mr. Rus
sel commented that it can do only
what the operator tells it. It can
figure and remember numbers,
but Ihe operators must tell it
which ones and in what order. Mr.
Russel admitted, however, that
occasionally even this is rather
amazing. The sytem at M.I.T was
able to pass freshman calculus
with a "B." Before students look
around for used teletype ma
chines. however, they should re
member that it had to be told
how to do the word problems

ing, he produced a jazz piece in
about thirty minutes.
The student was using a new
system introduced at the Stan
ford Computation Center called
"Time-sharing." Formerly, he
would have had to punch out a
;et of cards, try out his synthetic
nusic program, correct his errors,
then type out a new set of cards.
With "Time-sharing" he commu
nicated directly with the machine
by the use of a teletype. He could
correct his mistakes as he made
them. Although his program was

fairly simple anrl the time saved
small, "Time-sharing" can mean
extra days and sometimes months
to people with complicated pro
grams.
ANOTHER ADVANTAGE of
the new system is that it can
work simultaneously on as many
as 12 problems. The machine does
not need to work very hard re
ceiving the instructions for a
problem, and while the student
was typing out his directions, an
unknown history professor could
have been receiving answers to
his income tax questions via tele
type. Machines with cards can
handle only one problem at a
time.
The Stanford system is not the
first of its kind. Prof. McCarthy
of the Computer Science Divi
sion, who is coordinating the proj
ect, has previously developed a
similar set-up for Bolt, Beranek,
and Newman in Cambridge. There
are also "Time-sharing" systems
at M.I.T. and other places. Mr.
Steve Russel, a programmer at
the Computation Center, said,
however, that the Stanford sys
tem shows a number of advances

over its predecessors, particularly
in its applications.
There will be a lot of work be
fore the machine is finally ready
Mr. Russel explained that all com
puters have "bugs" which can
only be removed after continual
use and correction. But ho be
lieves that within a few years the
"Time-sharing" system should be
ready to handle problems coming
in from all over campus on tele
type wires. A man is working
now on a translation device that
would permit problems to be sent
in in words.
WHEN ASKED ABOUT the
machine's "intelligence" Mr. Rus
sel commented that it can do only
what the operator tells it. It can
figure and remember numbers,
but Ihe operators must tell it
which ones and in what order. Mr.
Russel admitted, however, that
occasionally even this is rather
amazing. The sytem at M.I.T was
able to pass freshman calculus
with a "B." Before students look
around for used teletype ma

A student sat at a typewriter

pecked out a set of mysterious
symbols. A digital computer
nearby fed out a short piece of
gray tape. He put the tape back
through the machine, then
shook his head and began to look
over what he had typed. Then an
idea struck him, and he typed oul
a new set of symbols. When he
fed the tape back through, th e
scope obliged him with an ellipse
