## 
### A. REES CLARK UCLA Correspondent 
LOS ANGELES (Special to Hie
Daily) The temporary arena
on the Intramural Athletic Field
is empty now, but UCLA students
are still talking about the
speeches given thei-e by President
Lyndon Johnson and Adolfo Lo
pe/. Mateos.
LB.I KKCKIVKD a less than
enthusiastic reception be c ause
many students missed hearing
that vibrant Boston twang his pre
decessor made so famous. John
son's hesitant manner and less

colorful choice of words disap
pointed many who saw him.
Johnson's speech received ad
vance billing as a major foreign
policy address on the occasion of
UCLA's 96th anniversary.
He acknowledged the deficien
cies of the United States in t he
areas of employment, education
a n d racial discrimination, but
pointed out tiiat the progress
which has been made is but the
harbinger of the total elimination
of these deficiencies and cannot
satisfy the appetite of the Ameri
can people for equality of oppor

tunity for all.
lIK IHCKILD those citizens
who demand hasty answers to
these and other pressing prob
lems, declaring there are no easy
answers and "if we were to solve
them all tomorrow, there would
be more next week."
In contrast to the slow moving,
conservative appearing Johnson,
Lope/ Mateos came in like a lion,
uplifting his arms in the would-be
embrace which has become his
trademark in his homeland.
Lopez Mateos' speech was also
more aptly geared to the Univer
sity audience lie faced than was
that of Johnson. He directed his
comments to the universal "uni
versity man," whom he called
upon to direct his efforts toward
the eradication of the world's
truly great problems such as
aridity, salination of land and the
famine they produce.
