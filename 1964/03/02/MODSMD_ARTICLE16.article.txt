## 
### 
By 808 I'ICKUS
The "scratch sheet" is 110
more. Spring quarter plans
of the Student Academic Af
fairs Committee call for Pub
lication of a new Stanford
course review. Publication is
tentatively set for May 1.
The innovation will have a
three-fold purpose. According
to SAAC Chairman Mark
Lohman, ttie main section will
seek to be primarily informa
tive. It will strive to present
students with as much in
formation as possible about
the Stanford <'our.se offerings.
Unlike the infamous
"scratch sheets," the new re
view will not attempt to tell
students what courses to
take. It will, rather, merely
try to aid them in making ra
tional program decisions.
A second section will pre
sent new programs, describ
ing in some detail their pur
poses and the types of stu
dents and professors who
participate. Included will be
reports on interdisciplinary
approaches to education; tu
torial programs; student for
um seminars, and field work
for credit.
A third part of the work
will cover the two extremes

of the Stanford academic
speetrum: the especially out
standing courses, and the in
adequate offerings. This will
be the sole portion of th e
guide dealing in judgment
statements. By a statistical
method, an attempt will be
in a<l e to determine what
classes are deserving of the
above classifications.
The committee will distrib
ute a long", detailed question
naire to every student in the
selected course, li the data
received supports the origi
nal belief, further action will
be taken.
Should the course be an
exceptionally good one, it
will be described as such in
a section of the guide cover
ing the lop courses and pro
fessors. However, if th e
course is deemed inadequate,
the committee will approach
the professor with the data,
to discuss with him possibil
ities for change and improve
ment.
Discussing the failures of
the "scratch sheets," Chair
man Lohman states that they
were conducted under biased
sampling procedures. He also
believes that the samplings
were too small.
