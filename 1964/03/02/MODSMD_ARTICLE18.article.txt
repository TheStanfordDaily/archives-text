# STANFORD J.V.'S EDGE INMATES
## 
### 
Although the umpire was a
"homer," the Stanford baseball
Braves overcame a spirited San
Quentin nine 8-3 yesterday. The
J.V.'s dominated the game against
the Inmates at an institution
where all sports save, perhaps.

i pule vaulting and archery are en
ccuraged.
After the game, the San Quen
tin residents looked like they
wanted another chance, but the
Stanford Athletic Dept. says that
a "home and home" series is un
likely at this time.
