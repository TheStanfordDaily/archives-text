With the Commencement Day just a couple of short months
away, the question on everyone's lips is: ''How did the differ
ent disciplines come to be marked by academic robes with
hoods of different colors?" Everybody is asking it; I mean
everybody! 1 mean I haven't been able to walk ten feet on
any campus without somebody grabs my elbow and says, "How
did the different disciplines come to be marked by academic
robes with hoods of different colors, hey?"
This, 1 must say, is not the usual question asked by colle
gians who grab my elbow. Ordinarily they say, "Hey, Shorty,
got a Marlboro?" And this is fitting. After all, are they not.
collegians and therefore loaded with brains? And does not
intelligence demand the tastiest in tobacco flavor? And does
not Marlboro deliver a flavor that is uniquely delicious? And
am I not short?
Rut I digress. Back to the colored hoods of academic robes.
A doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears

green, a master of arts wears white, a doctor of humanities
wears crimson, :i master of library science wears lemon yellow.
Why? Why, for example, should a master of library science
wear lemon yellow?
Well sir, to answer this vexing question, we must go back to
March 14, 184-1. On that date the first public library in the
I'nited States was established by Ulrich Sigafoos. All of Mr.
Sigafoos's neighbors were of course wildly grateful—all, that
is, except Wrex Todhunter.
Mr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both
men had wooed the beautiful Melanie Zitt and Melanie had
chosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.
Sigafoos knew all the latest steps—like the Missouri Com
promise Samba, the Shays' Rebellion Schottische, and the
.lames K. Polk Polka—while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not
dance at all, owing to a wound he had received at the Battle
of New Orleans, (lie was struck by a falling praline.)
Consumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos's
library, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library.
This he did, but he lured not one single patron away from
Mr. Sigafoos. "What has Mr. Sigafoos got that 1 have not?"
Mr. Todhunter kept asking liimself, and finally the answer
came to him: books.
So Mr. Todhunter stocked his library with lots of lovely
books, and soon he was doing more business than his hated rival.
Hut Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began
serving tea at liis library every afternoon. Thereupon Mr.
Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea with sugar.
Thereupon Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with sugar and
crcam. Thereupon Mr. Todhunter began serving tea with sugar
and cream and lemon.
This, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter
because he had the only lemon tree in town—in fact, in the
entire state of Maine—and since that day lemon yellow has,
of course, been the color on the robes of masters of library
science.
(Incidentally, the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his li
brary and moved to California where, alas, he failed once more.
There were, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea,
but, alas, there was no cream because the cow was not intro
duced to California until 1037 by John Wayne.)

men had wooed the beautiful Melanie Zitt and Melanie had
chosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.
Sigafoos knew all the latest steps—like the Missouri Com
promise Samba, the Shays' Rebellion Schottische, and the
.lames K. Polk Polka—while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not
dance at all, owing to a wound he had received at the Battle
of New Orleans, (lie was struck by a falling praline.)
Consumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos's
library, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library.
This he did, but he lured not one single patron away from
Mr. Sigafoos. "What has Mr. Sigafoos got that 1 have not?"
Mr. Todhunter kept asking liimself, and finally the answer
came to him: books.
So Mr. Todhunter stocked his library with lots of lovely
books, and soon he was doing more business than his hated rival.
Hut Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began
serving tea at liis library every afternoon. Thereupon Mr.
Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea with sugar.
Thereupon Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with sugar and
crcam. Thereupon Mr. Todhunter began serving tea with sugar
and cream and lemon.
This, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter
because he had the only lemon tree in town—in fact, in the
entire state of Maine—and since that day lemon yellow has,
of course, been the color on the robes of masters of library
science.
(Incidentally, the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his li
brary and moved to California where, alas, he failed once more.
There were, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea,
but, alas, there was no cream because the cow was not intro
duced to California until 1037 by John Wayne.)

got a Marlboro?" And this is fitting. After all, are they not.
