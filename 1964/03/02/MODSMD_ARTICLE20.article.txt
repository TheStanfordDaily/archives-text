# Stanford Ruggers Goal Post Victory; Overcome Tough California Bears, 15-11
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
The Stanford rugby team, hav
ing little opportunity to turn
loose its vaunted backs, goal
posted a victory over the Cal
Bears Saturday afternoon as Gor
don Waddell toed the Indian cause
singlehandedly, kicking five pen
alty kicks for a 15-11 victory.
The game lived up to expecta
tions as a close one. Both teams
played good, aggressive defense
which included good pursuit and
lots of clean, hard tackling. Kmc
tovic singled out scappy scrum
half and Capt. Bob Price after the
game for his tackling.
WHAT HURT Stanford, and
somehow this must be at least
partially corrected by next Satur
day's rematch at Berkeley, was
Cal's domination of the scrums
and lineout tosses. Warren Moyes,
a New Zealand product, was Capt.
Hook during the game as he con
sistently controlled the scrums
and allowed the forwards to foot
the ball to scrum half Stan Geel.
The knee injury sustained by
star hooker Ron Fraboni was a
crucial one, keeping him out of
part of the first half and limiting
his effectiveness in the second
half. Lorcn Hawley used hi s
height and muscle to advantage
and outmaneuvered the Stanford
forwards for the lineout tosses.
Cal began the game with the
wind in its favor and quickly used
a series of pop kicks, touch kicks,
and some Stanford ball handling
errors, to move the ball into Stan
ford territory.
WADDELL by virtue of two
fine touch kicks reversed the
position of the ball. Cal's Steve
Nesbit moved the ball back to
midfield with a touch kick.
Stanford then showed the stuff
of what it is made. A rush right
went about 50 yards. After the
first couple of passes, Dick Shaw
had the ball and did most of the
running. When cornered, he
flipped overhead to Clark Wea
ver who lateraled outside to Wad
dell who got upturned to end the
play.
Such was the entor of the
game. Cal, having the ball most
of the time, played a game that
saw the ball move gradually up
field. Stanford negated the Cal
attack with good tackling by such

forwards as Frank Patitucci and
Jack Chappie and with occasional
touch kicks and rushes.
WADDELL SOON added his
first penalty kick. Cal provided
the equalizer with a Tom Blanch
field boot of the same variety.
Cal now dominated play. Geel
started a rush in Stanford terri
tory unexpectedly up the short
side and pop kicked to the goal
line.
The Bears controlled the rush
at that point and got the ball to
John Whvte who drop kicked the
ball goalward with distance but
just wide.
NOT TO BE denied, Steve Nes
bit used some clever tactics to
account for the only try of the
game. Fielding a short dump
kick, he pop kicked over the head
of the onrushing Dick Ragsdale
and easily got to the ball on the
first bounce and carried it into
the in-goal area.
Blanch field converted and Cal
was in front, 8-3.
Stanford came back with a seri
ous threat on two good rushes
involving wing Glenn Myers and
Waddell and Van Nort, that took
the ball within whispering dis
tance of the goaline. Cal somehow
survived.
THE SECOND HALF turned
out to be a penalty kicking duel
between Waddell and Blanch
field, the former winning 4-1.
Cal threatened right off the bat
but Stanford came up with some
bouncing balls near and in the
goal area, and Waddell and Rags
dale proceeded to boot the ball
out of danger.
Then Waddell within a space of
about 15 minutes successfully

converted three penalty kicks to
give Stanford a 12-8 lead. The
last two were 40-yarders from
midfield that just cleared the
crosspiece and the first was a
sideline beauty which sacrificing
distance for a better angle Wad
dell set up back from the mark.
BLANCHFIELD was wide and
short on kicks before making a
40-yarder from the middle that
brought Cal within a point.
Stanford needed some breath
ing room and Cal obliged by foul
ing a Stanford player after he had
kicked the ball. Kicking from the
point where the ball had landed,
Waddell had a difficult angle
from the right sideline but made
it just the same.
Ragsdale electrified the crowd
with a sparkling run soon after.
Taking a short Cal kick on the
dead run.he ran knees high
through several groups of would
be tacklers and headed down the
sideline.
AFTER some 70 yards, Ca 1
closed in and he pitched out to
Van Nort who advanced the ball
still further but not enough for
a try.
Blanchfield blew two penalty
kicks in the closing minutes lhat
would have proved the difference.
The referee used his whistle
more than at any time this year.
Not only whistling at infractions
of the rules, he must have been
whistling at the good looking
girls in attendance, too.
THE J.V. contest ended prema
turely with Stanford leading 8-5.
The referees called the game
when fisticuffs overshadowed
rugby in the minds of the partici
pants.

lots of clean, hard tackling. Kmc
tovic singled out scappy scrum
half and Capt. Bob Price after the
game for his tackling.
WHAT HURT Stanford, and
somehow this must be at least
partially corrected by next Satur
day's rematch at Berkeley, was
Cal's domination of the scrums
and lineout tosses. Warren Moyes,
a New Zealand product, was Capt.
Hook during the game as he con
sistently controlled the scrums
and allowed the forwards to foot
the ball to scrum half Stan Geel.
The knee injury sustained by
star hooker Ron Fraboni was a
crucial one, keeping him out of
part of the first half and limiting
his effectiveness in the second
half. Lorcn Hawley used hi s
height and muscle to advantage
and outmaneuvered the Stanford
forwards for the lineout tosses.
Cal began the game with the
wind in its favor and quickly used
a series of pop kicks, touch kicks,
and some Stanford ball handling
errors, to move the ball into Stan
ford territory.
WADDELL by virtue of two
fine touch kicks reversed the
position of the ball. Cal's Steve
Nesbit moved the ball back to
midfield with a touch kick.
Stanford then showed the stuff
of what it is made. A rush right
went about 50 yards. After the
first couple of passes, Dick Shaw
had the ball and did most of the
running. When cornered, he
flipped overhead to Clark Wea
ver who lateraled outside to Wad
dell who got upturned to end the
play.
Such was the entor of the
game. Cal, having the ball most
of the time, played a game that
saw the ball move gradually up
field. Stanford negated the Cal
attack with good tackling by such

forwards as Frank Patitucci and
Jack Chappie and with occasional
touch kicks and rushes.
WADDELL SOON added his
first penalty kick. Cal provided
the equalizer with a Tom Blanch
field boot of the same variety.
Cal now dominated play. Geel
started a rush in Stanford terri
tory unexpectedly up the short
side and pop kicked to the goal
line.
The Bears controlled the rush
at that point and got the ball to
John Whvte who drop kicked the
ball goalward with distance but
just wide.
NOT TO BE denied, Steve Nes
bit used some clever tactics to
account for the only try of the
game. Fielding a short dump
kick, he pop kicked over the head
of the onrushing Dick Ragsdale
and easily got to the ball on the
first bounce and carried it into
the in-goal area.
Blanch field converted and Cal
was in front, 8-3.
Stanford came back with a seri
ous threat on two good rushes
involving wing Glenn Myers and
Waddell and Van Nort, that took
the ball within whispering dis
tance of the goaline. Cal somehow
survived.
THE SECOND HALF turned
out to be a penalty kicking duel
between Waddell and Blanch
field, the former winning 4-1.
Cal threatened right off the bat
but Stanford came up with some
bouncing balls near and in the
goal area, and Waddell and Rags
dale proceeded to boot the ball
out of danger.
Then Waddell within a space of
about 15 minutes successfully

converted three penalty kicks to
give Stanford a 12-8 lead. The
last two were 40-yarders from
midfield that just cleared the
crosspiece and the first was a
sideline beauty which sacrificing
distance for a better angle Wad
dell set up back from the mark.
BLANCHFIELD was wide and
short on kicks before making a
40-yarder from the middle that
brought Cal within a point.
Stanford needed some breath
ing room and Cal obliged by foul
ing a Stanford player after he had
kicked the ball. Kicking from the
point where the ball had landed,
Waddell had a difficult angle
from the right sideline but made
it just the same.
Ragsdale electrified the crowd
with a sparkling run soon after.
Taking a short Cal kick on the
dead run.he ran knees high
through several groups of would
be tacklers and headed down the
sideline.
AFTER some 70 yards, Ca 1
closed in and he pitched out to
Van Nort who advanced the ball
still further but not enough for
a try.
Blanchfield blew two penalty
kicks in the closing minutes lhat
would have proved the difference.
The referee used his whistle
more than at any time this year.
Not only whistling at infractions
of the rules, he must have been
whistling at the good looking
girls in attendance, too.
THE J.V. contest ended prema
turely with Stanford leading 8-5.
The referees called the game
when fisticuffs overshadowed
rugby in the minds of the partici
pants.
The Stanford rugby team, hav
ing little opportunity to turn
loose its vaunted backs, goal
posted a victory over the Cal
Bears Saturday afternoon as Gor
don Waddell toed the Indian cause
singlehandedly, kicking five pen
alty kicks for a 15-11 victory.

and allowed the forwards to foot
the ball to scrum half Stan Geel.
The knee injury sustained by
star hooker Ron Fraboni was a
crucial one, keeping him out of
part of the first half and limiting
his effectiveness in the second
half. Lorcn Hawley used hi s
height and muscle to advantage
and outmaneuvered the Stanford
forwards for the lineout tosses.
Cal began the game with the
wind in its favor and quickly used
a series of pop kicks, touch kicks,
and some Stanford ball handling
errors, to move the ball into Stan
ford territory.
WADDELL by virtue of two
fine touch kicks reversed the
position of the ball. Cal's Steve
Nesbit moved the ball back to
midfield with a touch kick.
Stanford then showed the stuff
of what it is made. A rush right
went about 50 yards. After the
first couple of passes, Dick Shaw
had the ball and did most of the
running. When cornered, he
flipped overhead to Clark Wea
ver who lateraled outside to Wad
dell who got upturned to end the
play.
Such was the entor of the
game. Cal, having the ball most
of the time, played a game that
saw the ball move gradually up
field. Stanford negated the Cal
attack with good tackling by such

forwards as Frank Patitucci and
Jack Chappie and with occasional
touch kicks and rushes.
WADDELL SOON added his
first penalty kick. Cal provided
the equalizer with a Tom Blanch
field boot of the same variety.
Cal now dominated play. Geel
started a rush in Stanford terri
tory unexpectedly up the short
side and pop kicked to the goal
line.
The Bears controlled the rush
at that point and got the ball to
John Whvte who drop kicked the
ball goalward with distance but
just wide.
NOT TO BE denied, Steve Nes
bit used some clever tactics to
account for the only try of the
game. Fielding a short dump
kick, he pop kicked over the head
of the onrushing Dick Ragsdale
and easily got to the ball on the
first bounce and carried it into
the in-goal area.
Blanch field converted and Cal
was in front, 8-3.
Stanford came back with a seri
ous threat on two good rushes
involving wing Glenn Myers and
Waddell and Van Nort, that took
the ball within whispering dis
tance of the goaline. Cal somehow
survived.
THE SECOND HALF turned
out to be a penalty kicking duel
between Waddell and Blanch
field, the former winning 4-1.
Cal threatened right off the bat
but Stanford came up with some
bouncing balls near and in the
goal area, and Waddell and Rags
dale proceeded to boot the ball
out of danger.
Then Waddell within a space of
about 15 minutes successfully

converted three penalty kicks to
give Stanford a 12-8 lead. The
last two were 40-yarders from
midfield that just cleared the
crosspiece and the first was a
sideline beauty which sacrificing
distance for a better angle Wad
dell set up back from the mark.
BLANCHFIELD was wide and
short on kicks before making a
40-yarder from the middle that
brought Cal within a point.
Stanford needed some breath
ing room and Cal obliged by foul
ing a Stanford player after he had
kicked the ball. Kicking from the
point where the ball had landed,
Waddell had a difficult angle
from the right sideline but made
it just the same.
Ragsdale electrified the crowd
with a sparkling run soon after.
Taking a short Cal kick on the
dead run.he ran knees high
through several groups of would
be tacklers and headed down the
sideline.
AFTER some 70 yards, Ca 1
closed in and he pitched out to
Van Nort who advanced the ball
still further but not enough for
a try.
Blanchfield blew two penalty
kicks in the closing minutes lhat
would have proved the difference.
The referee used his whistle
more than at any time this year.
Not only whistling at infractions
of the rules, he must have been
whistling at the good looking
girls in attendance, too.
THE J.V. contest ended prema
turely with Stanford leading 8-5.
The referees called the game
when fisticuffs overshadowed
rugby in the minds of the partici
pants.
The Stanford rugby team, hav
ing little opportunity to turn
loose its vaunted backs, goal
posted a victory over the Cal
Bears Saturday afternoon as Gor
don Waddell toed the Indian cause
singlehandedly, kicking five pen
alty kicks for a 15-11 victory.
The game lived up to expecta
tions as a close one. Both teams
played good, aggressive defense
which included good pursuit and
lots of clean, hard tackling. Kmc
tovic singled out scappy scrum
half and Capt. Bob Price after the
game for his tackling.
WHAT HURT Stanford, and
somehow this must be at least
partially corrected by next Satur
day's rematch at Berkeley, was
Cal's domination of the scrums
and lineout tosses. Warren Moyes,
a New Zealand product, was Capt.
Hook during the game as he con
sistently controlled the scrums
and allowed the forwards to foot
the ball to scrum half Stan Geel.
