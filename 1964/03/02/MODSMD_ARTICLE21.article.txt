# BEATS CHICO ST., CAL POLY
## Card Nine Wins Pair 
### JUSTIN BECK 
Stanford got a pair of complete
games from Ron Kovacevich and
Mike Connelly over the weekend
and sufficient hitting from the
rest of the squad to beat Cal Poly
(SLO) 9-6, and Chico State 7-0,
running their record to 6-0.
The Tribe broke Friday's game
open in the fifth with seven
singles in the fifth for seven runs.
Soph catcher Jimmy Hibbs 112 i n
ished the Card scoring in the
sixth with a two-run triple.
Saturday Stanford .lumped on
an outclassed Chico State for two
runs in the first —and with Con
nelly tossing a three-hit shutout
spent the rest of the game widen
ing their margin.
Ken Deßevoise led off with a
single advanced to third on a sac
rifice by Lon Raymond, and
scored when Bobby Cox knocked
a pitch off the embankment in
right center field for his first
homerun of the year.
THE TRIBE picked up a couple
of runs in the second, and then
ran into a little Chico State right
hander named Sam Jiminez. Jimi
nez and Connelly dueled on fairly
even terms until the seventh
when lack of support finally got

to him. •
Raymond put the game on ice
with a two-run single to right and
the Cards added another run to
finish the days scoring.
Connelly turned in a beautiful
pitching performance with twelve
strikeouts and only one walk.
Only once was his shutout in any
real danger, in the fifth when he
was tagged for a triple with one
out.
TOM MELZER, playing third
because of an injury to second
baseman George Tacher forced a
shift in the Card infield, made a
diving catch of a line drive to save
the shutout.
Stanford hosts the Cal Aggies
Tuesday, their last game before
the conference opener against
Santa Clara next weekend.
