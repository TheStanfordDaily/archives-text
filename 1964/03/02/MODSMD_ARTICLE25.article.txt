# NANCE PACES HUSKIES
## Washington Outlasts Tribe Five 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
11 took a phoenix-like effort by
j former regular Lynn Nance to
beat off a resolute comeback ef
fort by Stanford's basketball
i team in Seattle Saturday night,
as I he Univ ersity of Washington
'squeaked in on Hie front end of
a 69-67 score.
Washington was in firm con
trol of the ball game most of the
way, even though Stanford led
j at one point by as much as four
i points, at 15-11. The i luskies came
I back from that early deficit to
| grab a 22-19 edge which limy
never ielinquished.
The edge at the half was 38-32.
I Four minutes after the intermis
sion, the Tribe was down 13 at
i 48-35 as forward Bruce Briekner
'banged in three buckets in the
drive before Stanford called time
I out.
Now the comeback began. Tom
Dose contributed three baskets to
j the drive, Mollis Moore added sev
en points, and soon the score was
| even at 56 all.
Now came the resurrection of
I Lynn Nance. A former regular,
[junior Nance has recently been
sitting on the bench in Coach
! Mac Duckwort It's doghouse.
He finally escaped Saturday
; by scoring eight quick points
against Stanford's two in the two
minutes after his entrance. They
j put the Huskies out in front by
i six at 64-58 and Stanford never
! again had a chance.
Dose, the Stanford All-Amer-
I ican, moved to within 31 points
of Ron Tomsic as the all-time
| scoring leader in Indian history.

Dose musl average 15.5 in each
of his next two games to match
Tomsic.
Moore led Stanford's scorers
Saturday with IT points. Bob
Bedel had 16 and Dose 15 to
highlight the Tribe attack. Clay
ton Raaka, apparently sound
again, was the big gun on the
boards.

Tonight Stanford, with a T-6
league record, tries to take the
Bears in the race for second place
in the Big Six .The Tribe must
beat Washington State in the
. Pavilion while Cal loses at UCLA.
Should everyone cooperate to
night, a Stanford victory in Fri
day's season finale woidd tie the
'Bears for second place.

Earlier this season, Iho Tribe
swept a pair from W'SIJ at Pull
man by 80-69 and 84-47 scores.

WASHINGTON FORWARD Charlie Hart, 6'3" 205 pound, was an

ford. Two year letterman, and four year naval veteran Hart, got two
points and provided the margin of victory for Washington as they
surprised the Indians, 69-67.
11 took a phoenix-like effort by
j former regular Lynn Nance to
beat off a resolute comeback ef
fort by Stanford's basketball
i team in Seattle Saturday night,
as I he Univ ersity of Washington
'squeaked in on Hie front end of
a 69-67 score.
Washington was in firm con
trol of the ball game most of the
way, even though Stanford led
j at one point by as much as four
i points, at 15-11. The i luskies came
I back from that early deficit to
| grab a 22-19 edge which limy
never ielinquished.
The edge at the half was 38-32.
I Four minutes after the intermis
sion, the Tribe was down 13 at
i 48-35 as forward Bruce Briekner
'banged in three buckets in the
drive before Stanford called time
I out.
Now the comeback began. Tom
Dose contributed three baskets to
j the drive, Mollis Moore added sev
en points, and soon the score was
| even at 56 all.
Now came the resurrection of
I Lynn Nance. A former regular,
[junior Nance has recently been
sitting on the bench in Coach
! Mac Duckwort It's doghouse.
He finally escaped Saturday
; by scoring eight quick points
against Stanford's two in the two
minutes after his entrance. They
j put the Huskies out in front by
i six at 64-58 and Stanford never
! again had a chance.
Dose, the Stanford All-Amer-
I ican, moved to within 31 points
of Ron Tomsic as the all-time
| scoring leader in Indian history.

Dose musl average 15.5 in each
of his next two games to match
Tomsic.
Moore led Stanford's scorers
Saturday with IT points. Bob
Bedel had 16 and Dose 15 to
highlight the Tribe attack. Clay
ton Raaka, apparently sound
again, was the big gun on the
boards.

Tonight Stanford, with a T-6
