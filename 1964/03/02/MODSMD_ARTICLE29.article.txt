# Student Voice Like Open House Hours: Limited
## Editorial 
### 
It's an old, old story.
lu announcing its new policy restricting
open houses, the administration lias once
again demonstrated its student-opinion-be
dainned attitude. There was virtually no
consultation with students on this important
issue.
The new policy limits open houses to
four specified hours on Wednesdays and
Fridays for men's housing and Wednesdays
and Sundays for women's housing. The pre
vious policy provided live hours on am two
days of the week—with a third day lor spe
cial occasions.
The channels through which the now
decision was made arc indeed murky. 1 he
timing of the administration's announcement
last Monda\ caught students I>\ complete

surprise.
Some cynics have noted that the new
regulations were effected at the same time
the Intel-House Council passed a resolution
calling lor more freedom in conducting open
houses—and at a time when student protest
on this issue of wide concern was develop
ing.
The old policy was initiated four years
ago after students recommended it to the
I'niversity.
Last spring a special committee under
S \SCO\l—including representative students,
administrators and tacultx members — was
appointed to review the policy.
but it was clear by the end ol lour meet
ings that there was a wide gap between tin
opinions ol student members of the com

mittee anil tin* University's members—tlu*
stuili'iits favoring far less restriction. The
committee disbanded without making am
reeommenilation.
I -.as fall a new subcommittee was ap
pointed. Anil, according to Dean of Students
11. Donald \\ inbiglcr, this group proposed
the new policy alter clearing it with SAS-
C.'OM. ()nl\ oni' student was on the subcom
mittee and lie could not be contacted b\ yes
terilax afternoon. The faculty representa
tive, John Loftis, declined to comment.
\\ i 1 believe that open house policy should
fall under LASSI"s jurisdiction. \nil, to sa\

the least, the University was negligent in not
consulting students—especially student lead
ers—bel ore announcing the new policy.
We wholeheartedly endorse LASSU's ap
pointment of an investigative committee
Thursday to look into the matter. There is
much to be cleared up.

surprise.
Some cynics have noted that the new
regulations were effected at the same time
the Intel-House Council passed a resolution
calling lor more freedom in conducting open
houses—and at a time when student protest
on this issue of wide concern was develop
ing.
The old policy was initiated four years
ago after students recommended it to the
I'niversity.
Last spring a special committee under
S \SCO\l—including representative students,
administrators and tacultx members — was
appointed to review the policy.
but it was clear by the end ol lour meet
ings that there was a wide gap between tin
opinions ol student members of the com

mittee anil tin* University's members—tlu*
stuili'iits favoring far less restriction. The
committee disbanded without making am
reeommenilation.
I -.as fall a new subcommittee was ap
pointed. Anil, according to Dean of Students
11. Donald \\ inbiglcr, this group proposed
the new policy alter clearing it with SAS-
C.'OM. ()nl\ oni' student was on the subcom
mittee and lie could not be contacted b\ yes
terilax afternoon. The faculty representa
tive, John Loftis, declined to comment.
\\ i 1 believe that open house policy should
fall under LASSI"s jurisdiction. \nil, to sa\

the least, the University was negligent in not
consulting students—especially student lead
ers—bel ore announcing the new policy.
We wholeheartedly endorse LASSU's ap
pointment of an investigative committee
Thursday to look into the matter. There is
much to be cleared up.
