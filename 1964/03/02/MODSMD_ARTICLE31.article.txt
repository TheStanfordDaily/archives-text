## Members For The Monasteries; Monks 'Love Their Brethren' 
### Tom Galbraith 
Our stor\ is set in a Renaissance Italian monaster) near the
end ol that celebrated epoch. Let s look at the monks during the
time ol the deepest concern and greatest seriousness.
Abbot: Brothers, as yon know , it is onee again time to select new
members lor the monastery. What particular characteristics
do yon think we should look lor this year?
Brother John: We must, ol course, maintain the breed. I think
we should continue to pa\ special attention to people whose
fathers were monks in our order.
Brother Paul: Agreed. And I think we should continue to choose
people Ironi diverse backgrounds. Fortunatel). the rules under
which our monastery was founded do not prohibit ns Irom
selecting members who aren't ol the Italian Baee.
Brother Lorenzo: Yes, but let's not earn this divcrsit) business
too far. It is essential to our wax ol lile that new members lit
into the monaster)'. That is wh\ the rules upon which our
Order was lounded give each ol use the opportunity to exclude
anyone Irom our brotherhood whom lie doesn't like.
Brother John: Ol course, that's what the whole monaster) system
is built upon. But you can t go around telling people that,
especiall) not with all the increased seriousness about religion.
W'e have got to get some wax to euphonize it.
Brother Michael: I know, we could sa\ that we choose the people
who show the most enthusiasm tor the monaster) and its ac
tivities.
Brother John: Thais nebulous enough, and has a good ring to it.

Brother Francis: But. Brother Michael, what it there is some quiet,
dumb, unpleasaut-looking little gu\ with buck teeth, who has
an enormous amount ol enthusiasm for the monaster)"?
\ll: Casp!
Brother |ohn:M\ God, you re naive. . . . We've got to maintain
the breed, for (-liristsake!
Brother Francis: But didn't Jesus sa\ something about loving the
"least of my brethren?"
\bbot: Brother Francis. I am shocked at \our lack ol knowledge
about the Order which you are sworn to uphold. You must
have noticed that Christ was one of our founders when you
studied for the tests to become an active member of the Order.
Naturally, we follow Mis teachings. You just didn't read our
books carefully. The correct version doesn't say, "Love vour
brethren"; it says,"I ,o\ e your Brethren." Letting in some small,
wimpy fellow would not be show ing proper love for \our Breth
ren here in the monaster).
\bbott: Well, lets get on to more important business. \s von
know, there has been a great increase in Protestant sentiment
the last couple of years. It is getting to the point where being a
monk inav lose some of its social prestige, \aturallv. we've
been combating this the best we can. So here to tell you the
latest plans, is our Kcumenical Council Representative, Brother
Barry.

Brother Ban) : \s \ou know, last year our membership drive was
seven weeks long.
All: Dreadful. Hellish. Beyond all horrors.
Brother Barry: And, as you know, it cost us a lot ol nioncv to
keep prayer meetings going all that time. This year there was
a motion that we set up rules restricting the amount ol money
any monaster) could spend and the number ol prayer meet
ings it could hold, so as to save us all time and money. One of
the cardinals had a better idea, however. lie suggested that
we cut the membership drive down to four and a half weeks.
This will not onl\ save us money, but also act as a force
against Protestant sentiment. We can oiler the usual alterna
tives: salvation to those who join, and damnation to those who
do not, but the shortened membership drive will heighten
the tension ol this choice, and, hopefull), drive greater num
bers ol young seminar) students into the flock ol our sacred
Brotherhood under Christ. (\ 11 cheer.)
\ good man) years elapsed bclorc the Couutcr-Rclormation
set in and banished all such sv stems forever. Several centuries
later, the doctrine ol Christian love was cnlorced b\ the new ideal
ol humanitarian democracy, and those two ideals ruled the world.
That is not to sa\ that people become entire!) democratic or lov
ing, but at least their institutions held these ideals up lor them to
strive towards. Societ) s ideals became courageous, honest, and

studied for the tests to become an active member of the Order.
Naturally, we follow Mis teachings. You just didn't read our

Brother Ban) : \s \ou know, last year our membership drive was
seven weeks long.
All: Dreadful. Hellish. Beyond all horrors.
Brother Barry: And, as you know, it cost us a lot ol nioncv to
keep prayer meetings going all that time. This year there was
a motion that we set up rules restricting the amount ol money
any monaster) could spend and the number ol prayer meet
ings it could hold, so as to save us all time and money. One of
the cardinals had a better idea, however. lie suggested that
we cut the membership drive down to four and a half weeks.
This will not onl\ save us money, but also act as a force
against Protestant sentiment. We can oiler the usual alterna
tives: salvation to those who join, and damnation to those who
do not, but the shortened membership drive will heighten
the tension ol this choice, and, hopefull), drive greater num
bers ol young seminar) students into the flock ol our sacred
Brotherhood under Christ. (\ 11 cheer.)

later, the doctrine ol Christian love was cnlorced b\ the new ideal
ol humanitarian democracy, and those two ideals ruled the world.
That is not to sa\ that people become entire!) democratic or lov

Abbot: Brothers, as yon know , it is onee again time to select new
members lor the monastery. What particular characteristics
do yon think we should look lor this year?
Brother John: We must, ol course, maintain the breed. I think
we should continue to pa\ special attention to people whose
fathers were monks in our order.
Brother Paul: Agreed. And I think we should continue to choose
people Ironi diverse backgrounds. Fortunatel). the rules under
which our monastery was founded do not prohibit ns Irom
selecting members who aren't ol the Italian Baee.
Brother Lorenzo: Yes, but let's not earn this divcrsit) business
too far. It is essential to our wax ol lile that new members lit
into the monaster)'. That is wh\ the rules upon which our
Order was lounded give each ol use the opportunity to exclude
anyone Irom our brotherhood whom lie doesn't like.

\bbott: Well, lets get on to more important business. \s von
know, there has been a great increase in Protestant sentiment
the last couple of years. It is getting to the point where being a
monk inav lose some of its social prestige, \aturallv. we've

Brother Ban) : \s \ou know, last year our membership drive was
seven weeks long.
All: Dreadful. Hellish. Beyond all horrors.
Brother Barry: And, as you know, it cost us a lot ol nioncv to
keep prayer meetings going all that time. This year there was
a motion that we set up rules restricting the amount ol money
any monaster) could spend and the number ol prayer meet
ings it could hold, so as to save us all time and money. One of
the cardinals had a better idea, however. lie suggested that
we cut the membership drive down to four and a half weeks.
This will not onl\ save us money, but also act as a force
against Protestant sentiment. We can oiler the usual alterna
tives: salvation to those who join, and damnation to those who
do not, but the shortened membership drive will heighten
the tension ol this choice, and, hopefull), drive greater num

Brotherhood under Christ. (\ 11 cheer.)

That is not to sa\ that people become entire!) democratic or lov
ing, but at least their institutions held these ideals up lor them to
strive towards. Societ) s ideals became courageous, honest, and
