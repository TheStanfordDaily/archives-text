# Editorial Misrepresented 'Shop-In' Objective
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
Editor, The Ihiily:
The editorial in Friday's Daily
misleadingly and inaccurately
presented t he object ives for which
CORE is striving in its "siege" of
Lucky Stores. CORE is not insist
ing on ;i fixed quota of Negro
employees; it is simply prolesting
the tokenism and gradualism and
the inequity of Lucky hiring poli
cies which have resulted in the
hiring of only 50 Negroes out of
a total of 1.600 employees and
which during the period August
to December, 1963 took on only
IS Negroes out of 320 applicants.
Also, almost every Negro hired
has been employed at a menial
task: box-boy, carry-out boy, or
stock-boy. Where are the N eg ro
checkers and produce managers?
Safeway Stores has been able l<>
find qualified Negroes for these
jobs: why not Lucky Stores?
CORE is not striving for an em
ployment quota but for a sem
blance of fair employment oppor
tunity in Lucky hiring policies.
Although I hesitate to condone
such strategies as the "shop-in"
or the "stroll-in", they have been
successful as a short-term tactic.
Because of the "shop-in" CORE
now has the good offices of Mayor
Shelley to assist in negotiations
with Lucky Stores.
The "shop-ins" and "stroll-ins"
were initiated onl> after whites,
so many of whom pay lip service
to equal rights and opportunities
for all, crossed the CORE picket
lines to shop in Lucky Si ores.
Though not a popular tactic, [ am
not convinced that CORE has
alienated an\ of its supporters,
noi do I believe thai the I:tel i<

| have? created any ill-leeling which
did not exist before.

In reference to the collection

letter of last week I offer these
comments from one who has lived
the majority of his life in Mexico
and is fairly well acquainted with
the scenes photographed by Mr.
Stiflei'.

the interest shown by some Stan

in East Palo Alto the answer to

Mr. Stiflor's photographs.
Hero at Slanford students Jive

come from a family with an in

simply cannot imagine whai ex

is like with only fifty dollars a

And unfortunately it is not
just Stanford but the whole of
the United States which falls into
this category of blind in this case.
For many years the United States
has not seemed to be able to un
derstand these areas of mass
poverty, and if nowhere else this
lias been reflected in foreign pol
icy. Take Panama as an ex
ample. . . .
To take this just one step far
ther: in 19.10 the President of
Mexico announced that "within
the constitution" he was as far
left as he could get. And this
just after Castro naturally the
United States had another com

Certainly the peoples of Latin
America and Africa and Asia are
going to be going "left" the
search for a chance at life rather
than existence is basic t<> these
areas. And certainly also, th e
United States will probably con
tinue its current path until these
things are understood, . . .
Finally, there are people who
avoid thinking of this poverty
because to think of this is uncom
fortable. and might lead to an
understanding and then what?
Then maybe the United States
could effectively help the people
of the world who exist without

The editorial in Friday's Daily
misleadingly and inaccurately
presented t he object ives for which
CORE is striving in its "siege" of
Lucky Stores. CORE is not insist
ing on ;i fixed quota of Negro
employees; it is simply prolesting
the tokenism and gradualism and
the inequity of Lucky hiring poli
cies which have resulted in the
hiring of only 50 Negroes out of
a total of 1.600 employees and
which during the period August
to December, 1963 took on only
IS Negroes out of 320 applicants.
Also, almost every Negro hired
has been employed at a menial
task: box-boy, carry-out boy, or
stock-boy. Where are the N eg ro
checkers and produce managers?
Safeway Stores has been able l<>
find qualified Negroes for these
jobs: why not Lucky Stores?
CORE is not striving for an em
ployment quota but for a sem
blance of fair employment oppor
tunity in Lucky hiring policies.
Although I hesitate to condone
such strategies as the "shop-in"
or the "stroll-in", they have been
successful as a short-term tactic.
Because of the "shop-in" CORE
now has the good offices of Mayor
Shelley to assist in negotiations
with Lucky Stores.
The "shop-ins" and "stroll-ins"
were initiated onl> after whites,
so many of whom pay lip service
to equal rights and opportunities
for all, crossed the CORE picket
lines to shop in Lucky Si ores.
Though not a popular tactic, [ am
not convinced that CORE has
alienated an\ of its supporters,
noi do I believe thai the I:tel i<

did not exist before.

Editor, The Ihiily:
The editorial in Friday's Daily
misleadingly and inaccurately
presented t he object ives for which
CORE is striving in its "siege" of
Lucky Stores. CORE is not insist
ing on ;i fixed quota of Negro
employees; it is simply prolesting
the tokenism and gradualism and
the inequity of Lucky hiring poli
cies which have resulted in the
hiring of only 50 Negroes out of
a total of 1.600 employees and
which during the period August
to December, 1963 took on only
IS Negroes out of 320 applicants.
Also, almost every Negro hired
has been employed at a menial
task: box-boy, carry-out boy, or
stock-boy. Where are the N eg ro
checkers and produce managers?
Safeway Stores has been able l<>
find qualified Negroes for these
jobs: why not Lucky Stores?
CORE is not striving for an em
ployment quota but for a sem
blance of fair employment oppor
tunity in Lucky hiring policies.
Although I hesitate to condone
such strategies as the "shop-in"
or the "stroll-in", they have been
successful as a short-term tactic.
Because of the "shop-in" CORE
now has the good offices of Mayor
Shelley to assist in negotiations
with Lucky Stores.
The "shop-ins" and "stroll-ins"
