■— National civil rights leaders
issued a joint statement here last
night asking for the help of West
Coast university students and
faculty in voter registration, ed
ucation. and research activity in
Mississippi this summer.

James Farmer, Secretary of the
Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee (SNCC) James For
mat!, and Counsel of Federated
Organization (COFO) program
director Robert Moses, issued the
statement at the Pomona Col
leges' sponsored "Conference on
Civil Equality," a three-day gath
ering of student delegates from
California, Nevada, and Arizona,
including a seven member delega
tion from Stanford.
SNCC LKADKK James Forman
will be al Stanford this afternoon
to make a public address at 4:15
p.m. in the Tresidder Large
Lounge, and to meet with cam
pus civil rights leaders.
Forman is the young and mil
litant leader of ri young and mil
litant organization c o m po s e d
primarily of students. SNCC was
formed in 1900 as an out-growth
of student "sit-ins," the spontan
eous protests against segregated
accommodations and services.
Louis Lomax in his book "The
Negro Revolt," said lhat Forman
brings both maturity and expe
rience to his job, and I for one

would not be surprised if SNCC
became THE organ to be reck
oned with in the Deep South."
SNCC has been the initiater
of "direel action" in civil rights
as opposed to the legalistic meth
ods employed by the N'AACP.
Forman states: "There has to be
some form of mass education to
get freedom. And you don't have
to be ashamed of the word 'agita
tion.' "
FORMAN* was born in the
densely crowded south side of
Chicago, became a public admin
istration specialist, and worked
for the Institute for Juvenile Re
search on Chicago's west side.
In his Pomona address last
weekend, Forman, noted. '' Th e
student movement has galvanized
public opinion in this country.. .
has given the Negro and all the
country a new hope that things
can be changed."
In dealing with the philosophy
of mass demonstrations, Forman
who placed his action in an
historical context with frequent
citations from the writings of
Yale Professor C. Van Woodward
stated, "You're not just march
ing people to the* court house;
there is fear to overcome. We
must demonstrate to those people
and with them that there is no
need to be afraid of the registrar,
that he is human too, that there
are forces more powerful than
the sheriff."
THK MISSISSIPPI Pro j ec Is
scheduled for this summer is

sponsored by SNCC, CORE,
NAACP, and the Southern Chris
tian Leadership Conf e ronce
SCLC> under the auspices of their
joint Mississippi coordination
COFO. The signers of the joint
statement referred inquiries about
the summer activities to COFO,
the organizing body of the Mis
sissippi Project in Jackson, and
to the Stanford Civil Rights Sec
retariat.
He spoke of the need "for some
form of confrontation of the gov
ernment and state of Mississippi
with internal and external pies
sure," and labeled policy brutality
the number one problem in civil
rights in that state.
Forman explained the Negro
revolution of the 1960's as the
outgrowth of an historic chain:
Woodrovv Wilson's stand on self
determination, labor union activ
ities in the 1930'5, the Second
World War against the 'Master
Race' theories of Adolf Hitler,
emerging Africa, and court de
cisions."
