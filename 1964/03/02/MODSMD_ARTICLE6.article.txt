# Living Groups Oppose Open House Rulings
## Students Protest Arbitrary Policy 
### JIM HAUSER 
Sludent reaction to the newly
defined University open house
policy indicates a majority believe
that three open house nights a
week would be sufficient but that
each living group should be left
to decide both their number and
hours.
The? university now limits the
number of open houses for a liv
ing group to two per week, one
on Wednesday and one on Friday
from 7 to 11 p.m. Women's resi
dences may hold open houses on
Sunday between noon and 5 p.m.
The ruling applies to independent
houses, eating clubs, freshman
groups and fraternities as well as
all women's residences.
BEFORE THE RULING,
groups were allowed three per
week with their choice of nights.
The hours were longer, 7 p.m. to
midnight.
Living group presidents are dis
satified with three aspects of the
new ruling; the arbitrary control
of the university, the 11 p.m. time
limit, and the restriction of days
to Wednesday and Friday.
Skip Martin, President of the
Inter House Council, said no liv
ing group leaders were informed
that the measure was before the
Student Affairs and Service Com
mittee. He" suggested that stu
dents oppose the measure. "With
the new ruling, ASSU should not
register any open houses and
Men's Council should not hear
any open house cases."
MARTIN BELI E V E S the
houses should have the authority
to determine their own open
house policy and assume the re
sponsibility for enforcing any vi
olations. Authority and respon
sibility go hand in hand and it
doesn't make sense to have one
without the other."
Mark Hay u tin. president of
Muir House, said, "It is another
example of the over protective
attitude toward students who are
supposed 1o govern themselves
under the fundamental standard."
John Ashton, president of Soto
House, thinks midnight would be
a better hour for the open house
time limit. "We couldn't see
where that hour makes any dif
ference do the girls)."
DICK STEELE, president of
Donner, said mass open houses
on Wednesday would increase the
demand for girls and make dates
hard to get. "Right there you
have a run on girls."

from 7 to 11 p.m. Women's resi
dences may hold open houses on
Sunday between noon and 5 p.m.
The ruling applies to independent
houses, eating clubs, freshman
groups and fraternities as well as
all women's residences.
BEFORE THE RULING,
groups were allowed three per
week with their choice of nights.
The hours were longer, 7 p.m. to
midnight.
Living group presidents are dis
satified with three aspects of the
new ruling; the arbitrary control
of the university, the 11 p.m. time
limit, and the restriction of days
to Wednesday and Friday.
Skip Martin, President of the
Inter House Council, said no liv
ing group leaders were informed
that the measure was before the
Student Affairs and Service Com
mittee. He" suggested that stu
dents oppose the measure. "With
the new ruling, ASSU should not
register any open houses and
Men's Council should not hear
any open house cases."
MARTIN BELI E V E S the
houses should have the authority
to determine their own open
house policy and assume the re
sponsibility for enforcing any vi
olations. Authority and respon
sibility go hand in hand and it
doesn't make sense to have one
without the other."
Mark Hay u tin. president of
Muir House, said, "It is another
example of the over protective
attitude toward students who are
supposed 1o govern themselves
under the fundamental standard."
John Ashton, president of Soto
House, thinks midnight would be
a better hour for the open house
time limit. "We couldn't see
where that hour makes any dif
ference do the girls)."
DICK STEELE, president of
Donner, said mass open houses
on Wednesday would increase the
demand for girls and make dates
hard to get. "Right there you
have a run on girls."
