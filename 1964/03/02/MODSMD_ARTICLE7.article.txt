# IMPROVEMENTS UNDERWAY
## Pease Lists Library Deficiencies 
### BILL SMITH Associate Editor 
Professor Otis Pease, Chairman of the
Academic Council's University Libraries
Committee, in a interview with Jan Stude
baker, editor of the Faculty-Staff Newsletter,
presented the views of the committee on ihe
Library. With Mrs. Studcbaker's permission,
we reprint parts of that interview.
"For a number of years the high quality
of faculty expansion and the improvement
in the caliber of students h;is pressed hard
against a Library system which was geared
to a very different certainly a less high
powered college community," Pease said.
"THE DEMAND on the Library for new
books and service has grown . . . spectacu
larly . . . where Stanford's basic library col
lections have been weak and additions to the
faculty have been conspicuously strong. All
; this of necessity has generated pressure, fric
! tion, a quantity of resolve, some specific and
; reliable promises and. recently, a consider
• able record of performance . . ."
"A committee of the faculty the Corn
j mittee on University Libraries is centrally
involved in the tasks of 1 rnnslatine pres ure>;

and promises into policy and performance.
It is from the perspective of this committee
that I offer the following observations."
Pease said.
1i For the past four years the University
administration has tunneled about $ISO.OOO
into the Library's book-buying program over
and above its regular budget. The regular
book budget has simultaneously expanded,
and is now expanding at an accelerating
rate.
:J) Till: IMVLKSITY has spent about
$10,000 in the past four years in the comple
tion of surveys to determine needs and
priority of needs in the acquisition of
books. Future acquisitions in a number of
fields will rely heavily on the results of these
surveys.
3) The Library has added two subject
experts lo its staff. A third will soon be
added.
I) AN APPOINTMENT of a permanent
Library Director is imminent. He will be
come a net addition to the present staff.
.")) Plans for the new undergraduate li
brary and library building are moving fast,
and books are now being acquired. We can

expect thai construction ol the new building
will begin lliis fall.
"So far, so good. Where do we go from
hero? A prodigious amount still needs to
lie done to make our Library system service
able and adequate." Pease said.
It There is a critical shortage of dupli
cate materials and books for assigned class-
Work at all levels.
51) IWOKII KUIMKCT KXPKKTS within
the Library system . . . are likely to prove
desirable in a short time.
3) More parts of the library system need
id be kept open on extended hours, even
beyond the extension planned for the coming
year.
1) The University should consider pro
posals to join in a possible network of fast,
easy, and relatively inexpensive travel . . .
among the eighl major university campuses
in the state.
it) A SUBSTANTIAL re-modeling of the
Main Library building is urgently needed to
make it suitable for graduate and faculty
use in general research after the new under
graduate building is completed. II should
bo planned and begun in the ncxl two years.

of faculty expansion and the improvement
in the caliber of students h;is pressed hard
against a Library system which was geared
to a very different certainly a less high
powered college community," Pease said.
"THE DEMAND on the Library for new
books and service has grown . . . spectacu
larly . . . where Stanford's basic library col
lections have been weak and additions to the
faculty have been conspicuously strong. All
; this of necessity has generated pressure, fric
! tion, a quantity of resolve, some specific and
; reliable promises and. recently, a consider
• able record of performance . . ."
"A committee of the faculty the Corn
j mittee on University Libraries is centrally
involved in the tasks of 1 rnnslatine pres ure>;

and promises into policy and performance.
It is from the perspective of this committee
that I offer the following observations."
Pease said.
1i For the past four years the University
administration has tunneled about $ISO.OOO
into the Library's book-buying program over
and above its regular budget. The regular
book budget has simultaneously expanded,
and is now expanding at an accelerating
rate.
:J) Till: IMVLKSITY has spent about
$10,000 in the past four years in the comple
tion of surveys to determine needs and
priority of needs in the acquisition of
books. Future acquisitions in a number of
fields will rely heavily on the results of these
surveys.
3) The Library has added two subject
experts lo its staff. A third will soon be
added.
I) AN APPOINTMENT of a permanent
Library Director is imminent. He will be
come a net addition to the present staff.
.")) Plans for the new undergraduate li
brary and library building are moving fast,
and books are now being acquired. We can

expect thai construction ol the new building
will begin lliis fall.
"So far, so good. Where do we go from
hero? A prodigious amount still needs to
lie done to make our Library system service
able and adequate." Pease said.
It There is a critical shortage of dupli
cate materials and books for assigned class-
Work at all levels.
51) IWOKII KUIMKCT KXPKKTS within
the Library system . . . are likely to prove
desirable in a short time.
3) More parts of the library system need
id be kept open on extended hours, even
beyond the extension planned for the coming
year.
1) The University should consider pro
posals to join in a possible network of fast,
easy, and relatively inexpensive travel . . .
among the eighl major university campuses
in the state.
it) A SUBSTANTIAL re-modeling of the
Main Library building is urgently needed to
make it suitable for graduate and faculty
use in general research after the new under
graduate building is completed. II should
bo planned and begun in the ncxl two years.
