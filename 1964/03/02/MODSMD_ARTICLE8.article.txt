# All This And Quietude Too
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
Apparently The San Fran
cisco Examiner lias decided
thai Stanford is just too Pol
lyanna-good to be true. In
any case, this is the liist of
peripatetic reporter Lisa
Hobbs' Sunday edition smash
at "the lotus pad of acad
aenie."
To be brief. Miss Hobbs'
impressions of Stanford con
stitute a tour tie force of the
superficial. She reinforces the
sun-soaked stereotype with a
ready vengeance, and on c
can almost see the chip quiv
er oil her journalistic should
er as she announces, "They
don't call it 'The Farm' for
nothing."
Naturally, our lethargic,
super - pastoral environment
goes hand in hand with a de
plorable intellectual snob
bery: A gentle shower waters
the young mushrooms aii d
sends the "wild flowers burst
ing through the sod"; But,
aha! The quad is "near-de
serted" â€”a symbol of "acad
emic aloofness."
It apparently never occurs
to .Miss Hobbs that only mad
dogs and terribly romantic
Englishmen stand out in the
noon-day rain.
But all this is nothing more
than background. Miss Hobbs'
real bete noire is Privilege
"Walking through the arches
past Memorial Chapel, you
wonder if Stanford offers a
privileged form of university
life? Are its students, in fact,
members of a privileged class
destined by background to a
privileged life?" Miss Hobbs
answers her own rhetorical

questions with such a rousing
affirmative that one might al
most suspect she's been read
ing th e Board of Trustees'
statements.
Of course, all this disgust
ing privilege makes for in
credible naivete: A student
complains about the size of a
class, which numbers over
MOO. "You say 'Really?' and
then hope it doesn't sound un
kind. But you've seen worse.
. . . The exploding outside
world has not yet pushed
Stanford out of its comfort
able self-made shape."
As it turns out, the "self
made shape" out of which we
have not yet been pushed is
"a somewhat warm and pro
tective cocoon." An d. of
course, the sun shines daily
on our pre-natal nest: "They
chit-chatted about t riv i a I
things, 100 k in g incredibly
healthy, good-looking as they
warmed themselves in the
sun."
Miss Hobbs goes on and on
in this vein for about forty
more inches, documenting
with real-life conversation her
thesis that Stanford is fairly
rotting amid the lush vegeta
tion of wealth and privilege.
Everyone she talks to (an ap
parent total of five students)
reinforces her firm precon
ception that life is slow, slow,
slow iu this academic wonder
land.
In retrospect this conclu
sion is not surprising; Any
body who had time to "chit
chat" with Hearst"s Miss
Hobbs for a couple of hours
obviously had a lot of time to
waste. The rest of us were
too busy to bother.
