## SLAC Lines' Interference Could Affect Radio Telescope LASSU Will Consider Bill To Put Lines Underground 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Staff Editor 
(Mostly short wave interlerence with radio science experi
ments conducted with the Stanford radio telescope may result
from the proposed overhead powerlines to the Stanford Linear
Accelerator project, according to Dr. (). (*. Villard, Senior Profes
sor of Radio Science.
And the land to he condemned for the rights-of-way may cost

as much as ten times the original'
estimate submitted by P.G.&E.,
according to a local real estate
firm.
Tin; two revelations were
discovered in current investiga
tions being conducted by a spe
cial LASSU subcommittee to
study the powerlines controversy.
The subcommittee will submit
a resolution to the full meeting
of LASSU Thursday night ad
vocating that the Federal Gov
ernment accept the original F.G.
&E. proposal and permit the con
struction of underground electric
lines.
THRKK OF the major figures
of the current controversy will
attend the Thursday LASSU
meeting: Lawrence Mohr, repre
senting the AEC; John H. Sprout,
representing P.G.&E., and Paul
McCloskey, Jr., representing the
Save Our Skyline Committee.
The interference with the ra
dio telescope project was brought
to light in a recent letter from
Villard to Vice President of the
University Frederick E. Terman.
Villard revealed further that
the radio science experimentation,
which cost $4 million to initiate
and receives an annual grant of
$2 to $4 million, presently spends
approximately five per cent of
its technical effort dealing with
useless interference from local
power sources.
The SLAC powerlines will
transmit about the same amount
of power as is used presently by
all of San Matoo County. But the
use of the underground conduits
would avoid additional interfer
ence. Villard said.
THE POSSIBILITY of a much
greater cost for the condemna
tion necessary to construct the
lines was raised by a letter from
Ryland Kelley of Hare, Brewer &
Kelley pr o pert y development
firm, to Paul McCloskey of the
Save Our Skylines group. The
letter stated: "In our opinion, the
cost of $137,000 for the condem
nation as submitted by PG&E
must be a profound miscalcula
tion. Our best judgment is that
the cost of obtaining this right
of-way will total between $750,*
000 and $1,300,000 for both the
fee and severance damage."
The subcommittee resolution
refers to the P.G.&E. proposal
that the AEC grant the required
fund to P.G.&E. to build the lines.
An alternate to this was that the
AEC use money from the SLAC
budget, thereby keeping all costs
for the project within the proj
ect's budget. P.G.&E. will build
the lines and charge the AEC
$200,000 per year over the power
costs to cover the original invest
ment.
The resolution points out that

the interference with the radio
research would cost, as much as
the proposed yearly payments to
P.G.&E.
