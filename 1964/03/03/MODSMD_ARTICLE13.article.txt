## 
### JIM SELNA 
"You will be beaten, harassed,
and arrested, but there must bo
agents of change to go against
the pattern of resistance in Iho
South." These wore the words that
James Forman. Secretary of tho
Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee (SNCC), used in dis
cussing the role of the college
student in the summer voter reg
istration campaign in Mississippi.
Forman, who spoke in tho large
lounge at Tresidder yesterday
afternoon, outlined the non-vio
lent offensive that SNCC has
planned for this summer. The
"agents of change," he spoke of,
are volunteer civil rights workers.
In telling of SNCC's activities
in the state since it established
its fulltime field staff of 16, For
man tried to impress upon stu
dents that there is no glamour in
the struggle for the Negro's
rights.
He told of John Hardy, a SNCC
worker, who was aiding Negroes
to register in a rural Mississippi
town. The registrar asked Hardy
"what the hell are you doing
here, Nigger?" When Hardy ex
plained that he had brought sev
eral Negroes to register, the elec
tion official told him to leave. As
Hardy turned to go, he was hit
with the butt of a pistol from be

hind. This was just one of the vio
lent incidents that Forman de
scribed.
SNCC is also looking for stu
dents with special skills as well
as teachers to work in other pro
grams this summer. A Freedom
School will be set up for high
school students, and, community
centers will be established to meet
health and recreational needs.
Forman made a special appeal to
faculty members to consider re
search projects dealing with social
problems in the Negro's battle for
equality.
In a question and answer pe
riod following the speech, For
man refuse d to comment on
CORPTs recent shop-in demonstra
tions in the Bay Area. Asked if
he would like to see a showdown
on the civil rights issue, Forman
said that he did not advocate a
violent confrontation of the fed
eral government and the South
ern states, but that it may become
inevitable if the Negro's voting
rights are not recognized.
