Nam crisis.
"We hope that individuals,
regardless of their persua
sion, will take this opportu
nity to express themselves
on what has become an ex
tremely dangerous issue,"
reads a Peace Caucus state
ment to the Daily.
The petition opposing an
expansion of the Vietnamese
war and calling for negotia
tions toward a pacified, neu
tral and democratic South
Viet-Nam will In* circulated
until Friday when it will be
sent to the President. It now
bears the signatures of more
than i>()0 members of the stu
dent body, faculty and staff.
"President Johnson," t li e
Peace Caucus statement con
tinues, "is laced with an
agonizing dilemma: if the
U.S. should do no more than
maintain its present level of
involvement, nearly total tie
feat for the Vietnamese gov
ernment forces is likely in
the summer campaign; if llie
war is expanded, there will
be not only an appalling loss
of life and a risk of general
warfare but also the likeli
hood of the President ami his

"war party" being turned out
l>y the voters in the autumn
elections; it a solution such
as that which we advocate is
effected, the President will
be charged by the Republi
cans, however, inappropri
ately and unjustly, with 'ap
peasement,' 'no-win,' etc.
"We urge, with Walter
Lippmanu, that 'diplomatic
bargaining* he undertaken in
order that we may avoid 'the
a humiliating \v i th d r a w a I
and engaging in a large war.'
Neither an expansion of the
war nor defeat for the U.S.
position is inevitable, negotia
tions can result in a neutral,
free, and militarily stable
South Viet-Xam. A choice be
tween these strategies must
soon Ih> made.
"It is rather clear that
President Johnson, too. would
prefer the peaceful alterna
tive, hut he must weigh its
political consequences — he
must be assured of the s n p
port of the people. Part of the
purpose of our petition is to
provide him with such sup
port. The petition is impor
taut, but personal letters to
•Johnson, Rusk, McXamara,
.Mansfield and one's own rep
resentatives in Congress can
he even more meaningful, es
pecially because a decision
must include consideration of
public sentiment in an elec
tion year."

nity to express themselves
on what has become an ex
tremely dangerous issue,"
reads a Peace Caucus state
ment to the Daily.

"President Johnson," t li e
Peace Caucus statement con
tinues, "is laced with an
agonizing dilemma: if the
U.S. should do no more than
maintain its present level of
involvement, nearly total tie
feat for the Vietnamese gov
ernment forces is likely in
the summer campaign; if llie
war is expanded, there will
be not only an appalling loss
of life and a risk of general
warfare but also the likeli
hood of the President ami his

"war party" being turned out
l>y the voters in the autumn
elections; it a solution such
as that which we advocate is
effected, the President will
be charged by the Republi
cans, however, inappropri
ately and unjustly, with 'ap
peasement,' 'no-win,' etc.
"We urge, with Walter
Lippmanu, that 'diplomatic
bargaining* he undertaken in
order that we may avoid 'the
a humiliating \v i th d r a w a I
and engaging in a large war.'
Neither an expansion of the
war nor defeat for the U.S.
position is inevitable, negotia
tions can result in a neutral,
free, and militarily stable
South Viet-Xam. A choice be
tween these strategies must
soon Ih> made.
"It is rather clear that
President Johnson, too. would
prefer the peaceful alterna
tive, hut he must weigh its
political consequences — he
must be assured of the s n p
port of the people. Part of the
purpose of our petition is to
provide him with such sup
port. The petition is impor
taut, but personal letters to
•Johnson, Rusk, McXamara,
.Mansfield and one's own rep
resentatives in Congress can
he even more meaningful, es
pecially because a decision
must include consideration of
public sentiment in an elec
tion year."
