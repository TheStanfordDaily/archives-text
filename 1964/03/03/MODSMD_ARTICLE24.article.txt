# HOT LINE TO THE SIDELINE
## San Quentin Visit: Sobering Experience 
### TOM ELIAS 
The Stanford Braves baseball team played a game under the
machine-gun infested walls of San Quentin Prison the day before
yesterday. They won, 8 to 3, but that was not important. For this
was a rare chance to see the inside of a state penitentiary.
For all appearances, tho game was a normal one. The only thing
was that it was played in the prison yard -— tho right fiold fence
was a solid concrete wall complete with a machine-gun installation
atop the catwalk. One more thing, there was a constant chatter from
the prison loud-speaker system: first music, then an announcement,
the same one over and over — "Johnson, Number 69109, visitor."
PLAYERS WERE ILL AT EASE
Apparently either convict Johnson was deaf or the prison an
nouncer had a one-track mind. Players commented after the game
that they had enjoyed playing the convicts, but had simply not felt
at ease on the same field with men whose sentences ranged from
one year to life imprisonment.
And yet these men whom they were playing are just average men,
most of them, with one or two regrettable incidents behind them.
And they do regret those incidents. Certainly there are some in
corribibles behind the gates and walls of the Penitentiary. But they
seem to be the exception rather than the rule.
This game gave Stanford men, members of a university often
reputed to be a refuge for the rich, a chance t<> see what the people
are like on the other side of the tracks far to the other side.
Strangely enough, they seemed just as normal as anyone on the
streets of San Francisco. They, too, are human.
WASTED LIVES AND THWARTED AMBITIONS
There was the hospital worker, charged with bearing a stretcher
from the game should anyone get hurt. He spoke of a wasted life, j
a thwarted ambition to become a doctor. His sentence? Five years)
to life for attempted manslaughter.
There was the San Quentin catcher. Convicted of murder and
serving a life sentence, he was one of the most polite people on the |
field, always thanking the Stanford men when they handed him his!
mask after a play.
There were the men in the gym, intent on Iheir ping pong or
chess game. Because they have nothing else to live for, these little
things, minor details in the lives of others, become all-important.
SUN SHINES ALL AROUND
One convict seemed to sum up Ihe attitude of all the prisoners
when he mentioned that he had often seen the sun shine all around, 1
while it was raining in San Quentin. A sad outlook.
Stanford is supposed to be an educational experience. Perhaps |
if more students were given the opportunity to actually see how
some people are forced to live, something could he done to relieve
the blue denim uniformity which stifles whatever creativity and in
dividuality the inmates might have.
The important thing to remember is that people like Jesus Lopez,
head umpire at San Quentin for many years, are human beings, just
as much as any man on a city street or farm. The visit and game
at least gave a few Stanford people the chance to realize what I
can only hope that more will get the chance to see: that man's inhu
manity to man is not limited to the physical, but is even more dam
aging when applied mentally.

And they do regret those incidents. Certainly there are some in
corribibles behind the gates and walls of the Penitentiary. But they
seem to be the exception rather than the rule.
This game gave Stanford men, members of a university often
reputed to be a refuge for the rich, a chance t<> see what the people
are like on the other side of the tracks far to the other side.
Strangely enough, they seemed just as normal as anyone on the
streets of San Francisco. They, too, are human.
WASTED LIVES AND THWARTED AMBITIONS
There was the hospital worker, charged with bearing a stretcher
from the game should anyone get hurt. He spoke of a wasted life, j
a thwarted ambition to become a doctor. His sentence? Five years)
to life for attempted manslaughter.
There was the San Quentin catcher. Convicted of murder and
serving a life sentence, he was one of the most polite people on the |
field, always thanking the Stanford men when they handed him his!
mask after a play.
There were the men in the gym, intent on Iheir ping pong or
chess game. Because they have nothing else to live for, these little
things, minor details in the lives of others, become all-important.
SUN SHINES ALL AROUND
One convict seemed to sum up Ihe attitude of all the prisoners
when he mentioned that he had often seen the sun shine all around, 1
while it was raining in San Quentin. A sad outlook.
Stanford is supposed to be an educational experience. Perhaps |
if more students were given the opportunity to actually see how
some people are forced to live, something could he done to relieve
the blue denim uniformity which stifles whatever creativity and in
dividuality the inmates might have.
The important thing to remember is that people like Jesus Lopez,
head umpire at San Quentin for many years, are human beings, just
as much as any man on a city street or farm. The visit and game
at least gave a few Stanford people the chance to realize what I
can only hope that more will get the chance to see: that man's inhu
manity to man is not limited to the physical, but is even more dam
aging when applied mentally.
The Stanford Braves baseball team played a game under the
machine-gun infested walls of San Quentin Prison the day before
yesterday. They won, 8 to 3, but that was not important. For this
was a rare chance to see the inside of a state penitentiary.
For all appearances, tho game was a normal one. The only thing
was that it was played in the prison yard -— tho right fiold fence
was a solid concrete wall complete with a machine-gun installation
atop the catwalk. One more thing, there was a constant chatter from
the prison loud-speaker system: first music, then an announcement,
the same one over and over — "Johnson, Number 69109, visitor."
PLAYERS WERE ILL AT EASE
Apparently either convict Johnson was deaf or the prison an
nouncer had a one-track mind. Players commented after the game
that they had enjoyed playing the convicts, but had simply not felt
at ease on the same field with men whose sentences ranged from
one year to life imprisonment.
And yet these men whom they were playing are just average men,
most of them, with one or two regrettable incidents behind them.
