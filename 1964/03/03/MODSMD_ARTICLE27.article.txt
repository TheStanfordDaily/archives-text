# 3 PENNY OPERA
## Enjoyable, Important; Don't Miss 
### MANUEL FREEDMAN 
Early in t ho seventeenth cen
tury, the English Commonwealth
banned the staging of all plays,
and declared all stage players "to
be, and are, and shall be taken
to be, rogues."
A hundred years later, John
Gay wrote a musical play just
chock full of rogues. Exactly two
hundred years after that, Bertolt
Brecht refurbished the old Bog
gar's opera by thoroughly ravish
ing the early twentieth century
German middle class moral out
look.
It is evident from both "operas"
that there is really little differ
ence between a businessman and
a thief, between a lawyer and a
scrupulous scoundrel. But in the
light of what Brecht's version
means to modern society, especi
ally this country (for which the
attack of "Threepenny" seems
best suited in 1961), the question
of morality t a k e s on a deeper
spiritual signifcance.
Carl Weber directs the Stan
ford Players' production of "The
T h r e e p e n n y Opera." II i s
work with Brecht in Berlin and
his brilliant career bring to this
campus a valuable and unique
t heatrical experience.

THIS IS ON10 of the rare Stan
ford productions in which the cast
does not half-heartedly play at
a script, but in which it moves
through one with surety and
skill.
Unfortunately, the opening per
formance moved at minimal pace,
at times coming to a near halt
from the rearded tempo. The in
herent liveliness of Brecht, the
irony of his lyric, the vibrant tone
with which his characters are
sketched, were somewhat lag
ging. Not from lack of direction
(Weber is far more than ade
quate). but perhaps, from lack of
the Brechtinn spirit in the cast
itself.
Sam Resnick, as Macheath
the great "terrible man" betrayed
by everyone but himself, is a big
plus on the long list of characters.
He is well supported by Jack and
Marietta Schmidt (Mr. and Mrs.
Peaehum), Marion Hampton
(Polly), Mark Hammer (Brown),
Willene Gunn (Lucy), Linda
Bishop (Jenny), and the members
of the gang.
Individually, with exceptions in
the gang, they take on a distinct
and fresh portrait. Consummately,
however, they fail to make Web
er's interpretation as vicious an
attack as the program note indi
cates. It is a jolly and festive
enough occasion, well refreshed
by the cast's fine singing under
Ed Applebaum's direction.

TIIK FACT that the "mounted
messenger" descends < from God
knows where) to get the opera's
happy ending implies how rather
horrible the real situation in so
ciety is. That horror as well as
the ironic greatness of the crook
Macheath fails to penetrate the
slow rhythm that the cast estab
lishes.
The scenery of Holmes Easley
and the costumes of Douglas Rus
sell are excellently designed, and
the musical ensemble is well
suited to the play. The whores,
the beggars and the rest of the
supporting cast help the produc
tion get as far off its feet as it
does.
This performance of "Three
Penny" does at times hypotize
one. Yet one wonders if sometimes
the hypnotist does not fall asleep
watching his own medallion, glid
ing smoothly and gracefully be
fore his eyes.
It should be far greater this
week-end than last; and if all
the seats are not gone by now,
they should be. Weber and what
he has to offer are far- too im
portant, far too enjoyable, fat
too enlightening to miss.
