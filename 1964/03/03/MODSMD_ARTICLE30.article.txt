## ASSU Adopts Partisan Position In Forming Rights Secretariat 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned, wish to
register a protest against the re
cent LASSU appropiation of $300
for the formation of a Civil Rights
Secretariat on the Stanford Cam
pus. We feel that the Associated
Students has adopted a partisan
position by means of this action.
Mr. Wedin has attempted to ra
tionalize the Secretariat as an
information-dispensing operation
rather than a promotional effort.
We completely disagree! The Sec
retariat was established as the re
sult of Stanford's "selection" as
the West Coast center for co-ordi
j nating COFO's summer activities
| in Mississippi, and the appropi
ated money will ultimately be
used to finance the activities of
'this off-campus organization.
'Moreover, the mere allocation of
this money implies a tacit en
j dorsement of COFO's objectives
by the Associated Students. We
Ifail to see the distinction between
j promoting COFO and distributing
I information about it's summer
j projects in Mississippi.
By refusing to raise the money
i by voluntary contributions, Mr.
| Wedin and the other supporters
of the Secretariat have needlessly
j involved the Student Body in par
tisan activity. Should the Asso
ciated Students, through LASSU,
support partisan organizations
with controversial viewpoints or
should the necessary money be
! raised by voluntary donations?

• Peace Vigil
Editor, Tile Daily:
Regarding . . . the peace vigil
sponsored by the Stanford Peace
i Caucus: The reported waiver of
a full 8 1 L> hours' stint was admit
tedly a tantalizing inducement,
but it leads me to wonder on the
earnestness of the representative
pacifists.
I suggest, for instance, a vigil
of only 2 hours should really be
considered unsatisfactory partici
pation; four would seem to mani
fest more understanding of th e
basic premise. Six undoubtedly
shows some glimmerings of real
nobility, but only 8'- hours. I feel
should entitle one to full recogni
tion in the eyes of his compa
triots as a truly militant pacifist.

• Atlantic Union
Editor, The Daily:
Charles de Gaulle's blocking of
the American government's plans
for European and Atlantic integ
ration requires a new approach
to the problem of unifying the
Atlantic Community. Such an ap
proach exists which meets de
Gaulle's principle objections to
what Washington has attempted
so far, but Washington has not
even sounded out de Gaulle on
his reaction to it. This alternative
approach is the unification of the
entire Atlantic community under
the same federal principles that
united the thirteen American
i states in 1789, with membership
I in the resulting federation open
J to whatever other stable free na
tions wish to join.
De Gaulle complains that the
| American policies deny Europ
leans their fair voire in control

of nuclear weapons, and in par
ticular denies them assurance
that the United States will not
abandon Europe in a crisis. A
federal union of the Atlantic com
munity would not be subject to
this objection, since the military
establishment, including nuclear
weapons, would lie united in an
Atlantic defense ministry con
trolled by an Atlantic Congress
elected by and responsible to the
people of the entire Atlantic com
munity. At the same lime the fed
eration would end among Atlantic
nations the proliferation of sep
arate nu c lear establishments
which Washington fears.
In his January 14, 1963, press
conference vetoing British entry
into the Common Market, de
Gaulle expressed fear of domina
tion by the United Slates. This
objection would not apply to an
Atlantic federation, since the fed
eral balance in the Congress,
with representation proportional
to population in the lower house
and equal or more nearly equal
representation for each member
in the upper house, would pre
vent any one member or group
of members from exercising un
due control.
In a press conference held on
May 15, 1962, de Gaulle held a
purely European federation, part
of the present Washington plan,
impossible because of "the lack
of a federator who has in Europe
today sufficient force, prestige,
and skill." He also said that per
haps advocates of European feder
ation are really thinking of a
much broader federation with a
non-European federator; he did
not express opposition to such a
broader federation.
Perhaps de Gaulle's seeming ob
structionism stems from a belief
that the American inaction re
garding Atlantic federation or
similar alternatives indicates an
underlying American nationalism
which forces France to be nation
alistic in self-defense. If so, he
would probably accept Atlantic
federation if Washington pro
posed it.
In 1939 readers of the book
which first proposed Atlantic fed
eration. Clarence Streit's Union
Now, established a non-profit ed
ucational organization to further
the book's aims. This organiza
tion is now establishing a student
branch under the name Young
Federalists lor Atlantic Union:

• Graduate Commission
Editor, The Daily:
"Grad Government" is a mis
nomer for the Graduate Student
Association, and unfortunately
may keep Grad Students from
being active in it. The G.S.A. is
a Commission within the current
Associated Students organization.
The G.S.A.'s sole purpose is to
provide a framework for project
organization among grad stu
dents. a framework financially
backed by ASSU, to which all
grad students already contribute.
The Association is not the em
bodiment of a government whose
intent is to foist off projects on
the grad student body. I have no
interest in that, and most of the
people currently involved feel
similarly.
