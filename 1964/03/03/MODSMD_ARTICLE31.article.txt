## Warning: Don't Fight Inner Quad 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
Hippies from Harvard's hanky
panky of last fall have at last
reached the West Coast, judging
from the latest change in Univer
sity policy. Any sex parties,
planned or otherwise, have been
nipped in the bud by the adminis
; tration's sudden redeployment on
| open houses.
There is a good deal of mystery

among tho in
terested students
in exactly how
this policy was
arrived at. 11
seemed to pop
fully signed
from lhe ground
as the IHC was
worrying, as the

IHC sometimes does, about more
student freedom in regard to open
houses.
In their ignorance students
I have even gone so far as to sus
i peel the administration of being
I pig-headed and arbitrary on this
; particular issue. While, I'm sure,
nothing could be further from
the truth. University administra
tors constantly have their fingers
on the pulse of student opinion,
and carefully consider this opin
ion before making any action.

IN THIS CASK the Adminis
tration must have felt a grass
roots surge against student re
i sponsibility; by stamping down on
| open houses in their bureaucratic
j manner, they acted without con
sideration of either student re
sponsibility oi - student opinion.
In case you are wondering what
[student responsibility means, lot
| me provide a definition. "We have
a responsible student body," says
tho Administration. "Wo give the
orders ami they obey them."
Right now a committee of
! LASSU is investigating the whole
! matter, in the hope of finding out
j how the policy was formed and
hopefully of finding some kind of
compromise solution. But if the
Administration continues to act
in tho manner it is accustomed.
I that committee had best go back
to its books. Any LASSU inter
ference in a student matter is
bound to be resented by the Ad
ministration.
Students are alright on this
campus but sometimes they get
in the way. Things would be much
more orderly for tho Administra
tion if there were no students to
worry about.
If tlie new open house policy
has failed to touch any latent im
morality on this campus, it has at
least shown student government
its biggest weakness.

STUI) E N T GOVERNMENT
does not have any authority in
many of the areas of greatest stu
dent concern. Stanford students
can count on student government
to help them in areas as far away
as Mississippi, but on this cam
pus the effectiveness of student
government is at times, to say ine
least, not very great.
Lake Lag will most likely
freeze over before the Adminis
tration changes a policy merely
because students are dissatisfied
with it, and the Lake will more
likely turn into Jello. before the
Administration consults student
government in tho process of mak
ing disagreeable policies.
It is far, far better, from an
Administrative point of view to
ignore student opinion in making
student policy. It's much easier to
reach decisions that way.
And as for student government,
it's free to make any decision it
wishes, but the important ones
don't count. It's worth noting that
the student proposed that LASSU
i investigate the open house deci
j sion was a freshman. By the time
| he's a senior, he'll know better.
I You can't fight Inner Quad.
