Lack of funds has forced I\vo
Stanford Physicists to use Cal
laboratories. These men must
make regular trips to Berkeley
because it costs $3,000 to rent a
gram of radium, necessary in
their experiments, and that, is ex
actly $3,000 more than Stanford
can afford to spend.
This means that the highly sig
nificant investigations of the atom
being carried out by Professors
Black and Bradbury must be per
formed for tho most part at the
University of California.
In spite of inconveniences and
lack of funds, t ho professors hope
to have some specific discoveries
lo report sometime this spring.
