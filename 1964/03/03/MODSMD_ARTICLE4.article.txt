## Council Favors Total Freedom 
### GUY FUNABIKI 
I The Inter-Club Council last night
| night look a strong stand against
i the newly adopted housing rules
j which restrict liv ing group open
I houses. Roger Cowan, President
iof the Council, stated that t he
council in a meeting last night
J "passed a resolution that the Uni
versity allow open house seven
J days a week and that they be
i limited by the disgression of the
' individual living group."
Elsewhere, the debate continues.
In response to a statement made
in the Daily yesterday by Skip
I Martin, President of the Inter-
House Council, that students
should oppose the University's
i measure and Men's Council should
refuse to hear such cases, Lavv-
J rence Sherwin of Men's Council,
; the student judiciary body, said
i that the student violator would
I gain substantial support through
I normal judicial process if the
Student Council takes an enlight
ened view of the case. However,
he continued, "in the event that
j LASSU deems it wise to curtail
our jurisdiction in these casesâ€”
| the Council would be willing to
j act as an appelate board to re
hear a case brought to us by the
dissatisfied student."
"If the dean overrules a coun
cil decision and the student is dis
satisfied. he can bring it back to
the council and iry to find sup
port for his cause but this has
never been done."
Mike Walsh and Tempe Robin
son of the student-faculty sub
committee of the Student Affairs
and Services Committee upon
whose recommendation the hous
ing rules were adopted, declined
comment at this time. Professor
Eric Hutchinson, chairman of the
Student Affairs and Services
Committee stated: "I don't think
it's proper for me to say. If we
do anything, you will probably
hear about it."
Communication between parties
still remains a problem. Robert
Gordon, Dean of Men, stated: "I
would say that what I read in
(yesterday's) Daily was not ;il
together factual. First, the facts
should be ascertained before any
one draws their conclusions.
"It would be a healthy ap
| proach," ho said, "if SASCOM
leaders wanted to arrange to dis
j cuss with the student Affairs and
I Services Committee to review the
I policy and I'm sure that out of
that would come greater under
' standing."
