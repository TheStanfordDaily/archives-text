The 32-year-old St. Louis musi

He studied at the Curtis Institute
under Gregor Piaiigorsky and in
1957 won the "Prix Pablo Casals"
at the International Cello Con
i cours in Paris.
Casal's own description of Par
nas as "one of the most outstand
ing and accomplished cellists of
our time" was borne out in the
1962 Tschaikovsky Competition in
Moscow.
Mr. Parnas will play Locatelli's
Sonata in D Major; Schubert's
Sonata (Arpeggione); Debussy's
Sonata; Martinu's Variations on
a Theme of Rossini; and Brahms'
Sonata in F Major, Opus 99.

annual series. Tickets are avail
able at Tresidder Memorial Union
box office, 321-2300, ext. 4317 at
