# DO YOU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE
## 
### 
Some days you may think that it doesn't pay to get out
of bed, and that eternal life would be the last thing you would
ever want. However, whether you like it or not, your "person"
will spend eternity somewhere; as a created immortal soul,
after physical death you will either be brought into the very
presence of Christ or be separated from God forever. You are
free, of course, to deny this fact and hold that death is the
cessation of all consciousness; but why wait until death to be
proved wrong? The truth is this: there is a God, and this God
is quite prepared not only to grant you eternal life with Him,
but to make sure that you know that you have reecived it, even
here and now on Earth. This God of great love and mercy will
actually enter your body and take up residence there, working
in you and through you in a wonderful way. In the Bible, God's
Holy Word, we can learn about God's plan to impart to men
eternal life—His kind of life—an entirely different quality of
life from that which we received at natural birth. For example,
look at Jesus' statements, made not just to the people who
inhabited our planet 2000 years ago, but to all subsequent
generations of man:
(1) " am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in
me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever
liveth and believeth in me shall never die." John 11 -.25-26.
(2) "Truly, truly, say unto you, He that believeth in me hath
everlasting life." John 6:47.
Jesus Christ made it possible for man to receive the free
gift of eternal life when He voluntarily went to the Cross. There
God, the Father, laid on His innocent frame the sins of the en
tire world. Suffering the pain and agony of a death that no
mere man has ever undergone, He died only when the last
iota of penalty had been paid for some yet-unborn sinner.
Buried in a sealed tomb for three days, He rose again to con
found His enemies and prove beyond a doubt that His power
and life were of God. No mere martyr nor ordinary prophet,
this same Jesus stands ready today to grant you the fruits of
His resurrection: eternal life and forgiveness of sin.
God asks nothing of you except your willingness to believe
in Jesus and to open your heart and life to Him. When a per
son puts His trust in Jesus Christ and is regenerated by the Holy
Spirit, he is forever identified with Christ in His death, burial,
and resurrection. This is the true meaning of baptism, the out
ward testimony of which is water baptism. "I am crucified
with Christ: nevertheless I live: and the life which I now live
in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me
and gave himself for me." Gal. 2:20.
"Know ye not that so many of us were baptized (by the
Holy Spirit) into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the
Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. Rom.
6:3-4.
The Christian is not waiting and hoping that he will one
day receive eternal life; he has already received it and is cer
tain of this fact. "Verily, verily I say unto you, He that heareth
my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting
life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed
from death unto life." John 5:24.

presence of Christ or be separated from God forever. You are
free, of course, to deny this fact and hold that death is the
cessation of all consciousness; but why wait until death to be
proved wrong? The truth is this: there is a God, and this God
is quite prepared not only to grant you eternal life with Him,
but to make sure that you know that you have reecived it, even
here and now on Earth. This God of great love and mercy will
actually enter your body and take up residence there, working
in you and through you in a wonderful way. In the Bible, God's
Holy Word, we can learn about God's plan to impart to men
eternal life—His kind of life—an entirely different quality of
life from that which we received at natural birth. For example,
look at Jesus' statements, made not just to the people who
inhabited our planet 2000 years ago, but to all subsequent
generations of man:
(1) " am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in
me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever
liveth and believeth in me shall never die." John 11 -.25-26.
(2) "Truly, truly, say unto you, He that believeth in me hath
everlasting life." John 6:47.
Jesus Christ made it possible for man to receive the free
gift of eternal life when He voluntarily went to the Cross. There
God, the Father, laid on His innocent frame the sins of the en
tire world. Suffering the pain and agony of a death that no
mere man has ever undergone, He died only when the last
iota of penalty had been paid for some yet-unborn sinner.
Buried in a sealed tomb for three days, He rose again to con
found His enemies and prove beyond a doubt that His power
and life were of God. No mere martyr nor ordinary prophet,
this same Jesus stands ready today to grant you the fruits of
His resurrection: eternal life and forgiveness of sin.
God asks nothing of you except your willingness to believe
in Jesus and to open your heart and life to Him. When a per
son puts His trust in Jesus Christ and is regenerated by the Holy
Spirit, he is forever identified with Christ in His death, burial,
and resurrection. This is the true meaning of baptism, the out
ward testimony of which is water baptism. "I am crucified
with Christ: nevertheless I live: and the life which I now live
in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me
and gave himself for me." Gal. 2:20.
"Know ye not that so many of us were baptized (by the
Holy Spirit) into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the
Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. Rom.
6:3-4.
The Christian is not waiting and hoping that he will one
day receive eternal life; he has already received it and is cer
tain of this fact. "Verily, verily I say unto you, He that heareth
my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting
life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed
from death unto life." John 5:24.

Some days you may think that it doesn't pay to get out
of bed, and that eternal life would be the last thing you would
ever want. However, whether you like it or not, your "person"
will spend eternity somewhere; as a created immortal soul,
after physical death you will either be brought into the very
presence of Christ or be separated from God forever. You are
