# Swimmers Finish With Single Defeat
## 
### P. NORTH CALLAWAY 
The Stanford swimmers wound
up the regular season last week
end boasting a 8-1 over-all record.
Their only loss came at the hands
of USC as the Trojans buzzed
past them 64-31. Stanford excelled
especially in Iho last two meets
with Foothill College and the Uni
versity of California.
Marty Hull finally came into
his own. In the Foothill meet he
swam his best time ever of 1 :59.6
in the 200-yard butterfly. The next
day against Cal he set the fastest
time in the nation thus far in the
200-yard breaststroke with a
2:15.9. Also in the 200-yard in
| dividual medley, Hull set a per
sonal best mark of 2:02.9., this
mark stands now as a meet, pool
and conference record.
In his first breaststroke com
petition of the season he clocked
2:24.3.. thus he has shaved about
eight seconds off his initial time.

Stanford also swam well in Ihe
500-yard freestyle with Ilkka Su
vanto the top Indian in that event.
Pete Pettigrew also provided
the Indians with a number of vic
tories in the 200-yard backstroke.
As of yet Petigrew hasn't
reached his peak performance of
two minutes and four seconds but
he may do so in the regional or
national championship meets in
Seattle.
Mike Dosher, Bill Lorton a n d
Bill Ready have been steadily im
proving. In last week's meet with
Foothill both Dosher and Lorton
swam their fastest life-times in
the 200-yard freestyle. Ready set
three of his best marks last week
also. The first against Foothill in
the 400-yard medley relay and the
other two against Cal in the 200-
yard freestyle and in the 500-yard
freestyle, helping Stanford w in
these events.
Stanford started out its season
by victimizing the Air Force Aca
demy, the Santa Clara Swim Club,
Foothill a n d Cal before USC

turned the tables on them. From
then on the Indians swept to vic
tory, beating UCLA, San Jose
Stale, Foothill and Cal.
In the AAWU competition this
weekend Stanford should give
USC a battle for top honors but
will probably, when the water be
comes calm again, have to settle
for second. In the NCAA meet
Stanford could finish in a fourth
or fifth position.
