## Green Wrestlers Rumbled Well 
### 
Stanford's green but rugged
wrestlers really rumbled well this
year, according to coach Bill Le
land, but not well enough to
achieve a winning season, com
piling a 5-6 record and gaining
180 team points against their op
ponents 157.
Nevertheless, the over-all rec
ord of the team is an improve
ment upon that one tallied by
last year's grapplers, for they
went only 4-7 on the season, and
were held to 174 team points com
pared to their opponents' 199.
THE SQUAD'S major difficul
ties seemed to lie in the 130, 137
and 147 pound weights, where
they had to be satisfied with a not
all too impressive record of 6
wins, twenty-three losses and one
tie.
While at these weights Stan
ford had as many problems as a
blow by blow boxing announcer
with a speech impediment, they
still sometimes showed as much
class as Jayne Mansfield. Best
prospect in those three divisions
would probably have to bo 197 lb.
Carroll Bridgewater, a sophomore
who Leland said showed "lots of
improvement" throughout the
year.
And improvement was the by
word of Leland's young outfit. Of
the usual starters, two are seniors,
two are juniors, and three are
sophomores. With a batch of good
freshmen coming up to the var
sity, Leland looks for even better
things next year.
BUT ONE of these graduating
seniors is star Phil Kendall, a

Co-captain who fashioned a 9-0-2
perfect record this season, gain
ing 37 points, a fifth of the team's
total production.
Other dependable grapplers in
clude Dick Anderson at 123
pounds, with a 6-3 record and
j24 team points, Joel Kay an d
; Steve Schaum who alternated at
1167 position and combined for a
j 5-5-1 seasonal tally, Tom Allen
| at 177 pounds with a 7-3 record
and 29 team points placing him
second after Kendall in that re
gard.
Don Buehler, who wrestled at
; both 191 and the unlimited divi
sion and was 4-0-1 overall, and
| Duncan Ross, also a heavyweight,
turned in a respectable 5-3 rec
ord, going into the squared circle
with what Leland classified as
some "pretty tough opposition."

| at 177 pounds with a 7-3 record
and 29 team points placing him
second after Kendall in that re
gard.
Don Buehler, who wrestled at
; both 191 and the unlimited divi
sion and was 4-0-1 overall, and
| Duncan Ross, also a heavyweight,
turned in a respectable 5-3 rec
ord, going into the squared circle
with what Leland classified as
some "pretty tough opposition."
Stanford's green but rugged
wrestlers really rumbled well this
year, according to coach Bill Le
land, but not well enough to
achieve a winning season, com
piling a 5-6 record and gaining
180 team points against their op
ponents 157.
Nevertheless, the over-all rec
ord of the team is an improve
ment upon that one tallied by
last year's grapplers, for they
went only 4-7 on the season, and
were held to 174 team points com
pared to their opponents' 199.
THE SQUAD'S major difficul
ties seemed to lie in the 130, 137
and 147 pound weights, where
they had to be satisfied with a not
all too impressive record of 6
wins, twenty-three losses and one
tie.
While at these weights Stan
ford had as many problems as a
blow by blow boxing announcer
with a speech impediment, they
still sometimes showed as much
class as Jayne Mansfield. Best
prospect in those three divisions
would probably have to bo 197 lb.
Carroll Bridgewater, a sophomore
who Leland said showed "lots of
improvement" throughout the
year.
And improvement was the by
word of Leland's young outfit. Of
the usual starters, two are seniors,
two are juniors, and three are
sophomores. With a batch of good
freshmen coming up to the var
sity, Leland looks for even better
things next year.

seniors is star Phil Kendall, a

Co-captain who fashioned a 9-0-2
perfect record this season, gain
