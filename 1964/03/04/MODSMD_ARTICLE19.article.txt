# Card Tracksters To Open Saturday
## 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
Stanford track coach Payton I
Jordan expects big things of his j
1964 track team despite the loss
of two key men from the 19631
team that was runner-up to South- j
ern Cal in the NCAA meet.
The 1963 squad scored 42
points, finishing 19 behind Troy's
61 point total. Twenty-eight of
those 42 points will lie missing
from the Stanford team that
takes tho field in Stanford Sta
dium Saturday againsl San Jose
State, Santa Clara Youth Village,
Golden Gate Track Club and the
Stanford Track Club in tire Stan
ford Relays.
DAVE WEILL, NCAA champ
in the discus throw, contributed
ten of those points and sprinter
Larry Questad scored I>S of them
with a first in the 100 and a sec
ond to Henry Carr of Arizona
State in the 220. Both these men
will participate in Saturday's
meet, however Weill for the
Stanford Track Club and Questad
as an invited guest.
Jordan has no real replacement
for Weill, hut Eric Frische, a 9.5

sprinter, should pick up at least
some of the points Questaci did.
Frischo is the leading dash man
on the team, having placed sixth
in the NCAA 220 last year with
a fine 21.1 effort. He will be
backed up by Tyce Fit/morris, a
10 flat man in the 100, and by
Rich Chesarek. Bob Melntyre and

Ken Fraser in the 220.
c Ai'T. sum; ( oktkk.iit is
the top man in the hurdles, with
13.7 and 37.0 times in the highs
and intermediates. Curt l ight, the
second place finisher in the last
NCAA highs and sixth in the
triple jump should move up a
couple o! places this year and

help make up the deficit.
John Goode, a strong performer
in the triple jump, broad jump, 1
and the leading high jumper is
another good hot to pick up
points.
Hut the Tribe's forte should be
the distance and middle distance j
events. Here the Indians are three
deep in good talent in each event, i
Strongest spot, though, is in the
880.
IIKKK 808 >111 TZ, a 1:50.2
runner, Bill Pratt, with a 1:51.2 |
to his credit and Robin Ruble!
head the list. With Paul Schlicke
and Harry McCalla in reserve, |
Stanford should be able to hold 1
its own with any two-mile relay j
team in the country.
The mile is also strong.
Schlicke is the top man here right
now with McCalla and Harlan
Andrews close behind. Weym
Kirkland heads the list in the two
mile. Sixth place man in the na
tion last year, Kirkland has post
ed an 8:58.2. He will be pressed
by Schlicke and by McCalla.
The weight events look j us t
fair this season. Steve Arch is Ihe
leading shot putter with a 56-1 !
effort. Bob Stoeker is tlie top
discus man with a 167 effort to
his credit.
Tin: I'OLK VAULT will be
weak, after the loss of Phil
White. Top man here is Chuck
Smith with a 14-7 effort his best.
Stanford's top competition on j
the Coast and in the nation this!
season will once again be the
University of Southern California.
Troy, with two 7-foot high jump
ers, world-class triple jumpers and
discus throwers, 2 15-9 pole vaul
ter and 9.5 sprinters, presents po
ten opposition for any team in
either a dual meet or a relay meet. :


PAUL SCHLICKE ranks as one of the top Tribe milers. He also figures
to do some running in the 880 and 2-mile runs for the Indians.
