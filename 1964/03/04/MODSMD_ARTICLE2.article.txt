# A 						Skilled Insurance Salesman
## A 						Warning To Students 
### BILL MOORE Editor 
"Hello, this is — . Did
you got my letter a few days
ago? By the way, did you
know that college men live
four years longer?"
That's how the phone call
began one day last January.
It was a simple, friendly ap
proach from an insurance
salesman (who will herein
have the pseudonym of
Jones) to a Stanford student
(Smith).
And, after all, it wasn't too
unusual: Jones is one of many
insurance men who have so
liited on campus.
BUT IT DIDN'T take stu
dent Smith too long to dis
cover that his relationship
with Jones would Ik? far from
simple.
A few days after the initial
phone call, Smith went to the
salesman's office. As Smith
told The Daily this week in a
t ape-recorded in I erv iew:
"His first words upon my
entering were: 'Well, you
know, there are three kinds
of maturity: physical, mental
and financial.' At this I kind
of laughed inwardly, b u t
soon I began to listen intently.
His very pleasant baritone
voice exuded unctious con
cern. Then he got to his pro
motional material."
Jones, said the student, de
veloped his sales presentation
with consummate skill. He
brought out a brochure and
underlined most of the text
with great flourish. He talked
about his company and as
siduously pointed out its good
qualities. He produced a list
with a brief description of
the features of the insurance
policy.
And he waxed on and on.
"I EXPRESSED d o u b t
about the prospects of th e
whole thing," student Smith
continued. "But he said there
was no obligation, and he had
me sign a sheet allowing him
to get a medical history on
mo. Then he said he had lo
have a deposit of $10.95 be
fore a rating of my insurance
status could be made. At thai

point I asked him: 'Would
signing and making the de
posit obligate me lo buy the
policy?' He said not."
A few weeks laler the stu
dent had another appointment
with Jones. Upon entering
the office this time, Smith
was told: "You'll be happy to
know that you are a pre
ferred risk., and your policy
has been approved."
The student balked, but
Jones assured him thai no
obligation had been incurred.
"He kept telling mo this even
after I signed a bequest form
and possibly other forms,"
said Smith. "Then he said,
'Now we'll take care of this
part.' And I was given some
thing else to sign, which later
I realized obligated me dif
ferently than I had at firsl
supposed, though he may
indeed have staled the terms
in legal form.
"But he had created the im
pression that this didn't obli
gate me that it was on ap
proval relationship. I was so
damned confused as I had al
ready signed so much else.
Legally I'm sure I'm bound."
Fourteen days lapsed be
fore Smith saw the salesman
again. "I told him I wanted
my money back. He replied
thai I was the first person
ever to want to return the
policy like this. I later found
out that the truth is there
was another student who last

Stanford lias become a target lor many unauthorized sales
men.
Just last week magazine representatives were soliciting on
campus without permission, according to the University. And,
also recently, encyclopedia salesmen were reported selling their
wa res here —i I lega 11,v.
Remarked one resident assistant: ".Many Stanford students
are too polite to send these peddlers on their way, so they are
often easy marks for pressure selling techniques. Students are
often pressed to buy things they don't want."
The University advises all students solicited by salesmen
to ask them for their University permits from the Student
Faculty Employment Committee. If they have none, students
should report them to the campus police.

September tried to return his
policy to this man for the
same reasons 1 did. Anyhow,
at the end of ten minutes the
salesman told me he had an
other appointment and that
he couldn't talk to me a ny
more."
Jones said he would call
at Smith's dorm the next day
but failed to keep the appoint
ment.
"The following day 1 went
to his office uninvited. When
1 asked for my money back,
he said his company was not
obligated to refund any part
of the first year's premium.
"But if they decide to do
so, he said, there are two pos
sibilities: It There may be
a flat charge of $60 or so to
cover the company's expenses.
2> They may pro-rate the pol
icy for the time used.
And that's the last Smith
has hoard from the salesman.
Bui Jones is still active.
"When he first saw me,"
related Smith, "he asked me
to supply two character refer
ences. '11 can be anyone in
this area,' he said. 'Students
would be fine,' So I gave him
the names of two student
friends of mine, who were
themselves solicited by this
man in a couple of weeks. He
lold one of them that I was
very happy with (he policy—
which was not true."
This other student who will
be called Brown) said he was

approached in the same man
ner Smith was.
Explained Brown: "I just
signed four papers: 1 > that
all information I had given
on t lie history of my parents
and my medical background
was true; 2> that they had the
right to draw medical infor
mation on me; 3) that they
could use my picture in case
I became famous; 4) and one
that he called a departmental
receipt, which was needed to
process the policy or to get
an insurance rating."
A few days later Brown re
ceived a letter from the sales
man stating that Brown had
applied for a policy.
"This was the first time
in that letter that |Jones|
ever said anything about an
application for a policy," said
an astonished Brown. "All the
while I was at his office, it
was just, 'Let's see what your
insurance rating is.' "
The salesman made a .sec
ond appointment this time
at Brown's dorm.
"Here I told him I couldn't
afford it and that I didn't ask
to have a policy issued." re
lated Brown. "He subsequent
ly gave me a release which
stated I could give up th e
policy and could have my
money refunded. He said,
however, that I signed a guar
antee of payment note, which
1 did not remember signing.
But then he added the whole
thing revolved around a per
sonal agreement.
"But thinking later, I re
membered one of the things
I signed at his office was a
carbon duplicate. He said he
forgot to put the carbon un
der the paper, and so he asked
me to sign it a second time.
I don't know what I signed,
although it could have been
the note that he said I had
signed guaranteeing payment
of the first year's premium."
But Brown is certain of one
thing:
"That salesman sounded al
most reasonable about it all.
He's so smooth.
"I feel like a heel not trust
ing him."
