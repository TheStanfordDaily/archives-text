# Administrator's Motto: Expediency The Best Policy
## Editorial 
### 
What they don't know won t hurt them.
Again, this time on the issue of power
lines, the University has adopted this ex
pedient policy.
Prior to yesterday, it had never made
public the fact that radio telescope installa
tions were affected by the powerlines. Just
as importantly, the administration failed to
reveal that consultation had begun more
than three years ago with the radio science
professors about possible short wave inter
ference with their experiments from over
head power lines.
PERHAPS WE were not the only ones
who wore ignorant of this development.

There is some evidence that the Board of
Trustees had not been informed of the pos
sible interference when they recently voted
down the money for Stanford's part of un
derground lines construction costs.
Facts revealed yesterday show that the*
radio telescope installation, with an annual
budget of $2-4 million, spends five percent
ol its technical effort dealing with useless
interference from local power sources.
The SLAC powerlines will transmit about
the same amount of power as is used pres
ently by all of San Mateo County. Dr. O.
(I. Villard, senior professor of radio science,
said the use of underground conduits would

avoid additional interference.
THE USE OF overhead powerlines
would increase the cost of eliminating inter
ference, although Villard yesterday had no
estimate on how much the additional expen
diture would be.
The Board meeting at which the power
lines decision was made was shrouded in
secrecy. Provost Frederick Terman has re
fused to reveal the vote on the underground
measure, and has, in fact, declined to state
which Trustees attended the Board meeting.

The Daily has always sympathized with
proponents of the underground lines. And
we have always eringed at that mass public
indifference which allows civilization to scar
beautiful scenery.
Our stand, however, has been that Stan
ford cannot afford to put up $500,0(H) —
money that is too sorely needed in educa
tional areas. We were also skeptical of the
costs that had been estimated by under
ground lines proponents.
BUT WE HAVE always hoped that the
Atomic Energy Commission and Pacific
Gas and Electric Co. would finance t li e
underground ing.

In light of these new developments, how
ever, we believe a re-examination of Uni
versity policy should be made. We are
apalled that this important information on
the radio telescope was witheld — informa
tion that casts grave doubt on the validity
of the Trustees' decision.
A few days ago a University administrator
said, in reply to a journalism survey, that he
felt a college newspaper should have com
plete access to information from the college
administration, except in such a personal
area as "the reasons for personnel decisions."
It is this type of hypocrisy that has been
all too common in this administration.
