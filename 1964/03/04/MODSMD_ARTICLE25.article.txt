## Aggression In Vietnam Hypocrtical, Insane 
### Pell Fender 
According to last week's papers, the United States is consider
ing supporting air, land and sea invasion of North Viet Nam by
the South \ ietnainese. The San Francisco Chronicle even implied
that the invasion plans may already be in effect. While we may
take the Chronicles journalism with a grain of salt, we cannot dis
regard the fact that Monday's newspapers were strangely silent
about Vietnam.
The United States action represents die breaking of an agree
ment with members of the 1964 Geneva Conference. The United
States attended the Geneva Conference, along with France, China,
Bussia, Britain, Laos, Cambodia, and North and South Vietnam.
The I nited States, however, did not sign the Geneva agreement
on Vietnam because, according to General Smith, the United
States disapproved of the partition ol Vietnam along the ITtli
Parallel, and also disagreed with some of the "political terms
in the Pact.
In short, the United States feared that a partition across Viet
nam would result in the ultimate seizure of Vietnam by the Com
munists. The United States did agree, however, to sign a sepa
rate statement saying that the United States would not use force
or threat of force in Vietnam, and would uphold the terms of
the Geneva agreement.

()B\ lOUSLY AN INVASION of North Vietnam could not be
called the first act of United States aggression. The United States
now boasts 14,500 American soldiers who are "advisors" to half a
million South Vietnam soldiers. Even with the United States' hand
in the successful overthrow ol Ngo Dinh Diem, the motivation of
the South Vietnam soldiers lias not increased.
That fact—combined with American soldiers, weapons, and
money—is still not enough to defeat the Communists. It is said
that the only preventive ol immediate overthrow of South Viet
nam is the rumor that the United States will pull out "soon."
The only answer is a truce. North Vietnam has expressed a
willingness to negotiate. It is unlikely that Red China might
finance North Vietnam in a lengthy jungle war with South Viet
nam, and Russia is no lover of North Vietnam. As long as United
States troops remain in South Vietnam aiding and inspiring aggres
sive acts, North Vietnam will only retaliate. Added to this is the
presence of certain factions in Vietnam who sincerely seek a onee
again unified Vietnam, such as the Buddhists.
For the United States to consider aggression against North
Vietnam is both hypocritical and insane. Not only would such
action be a direct sin against the agreement, but also seems to
be th frantic and desperate gesture—typical of the United States—
ol acting first and thinking later. The time to calm down has
come, before this second Korea escalates into an issue nobody
can handle.
The withdrawal of our soldiers does not necessarily mean the
fall of South Vietnam to the Communists. Certainly all our efforts
have only been ineffective and terribly costly in money and lives.
Perhaps the Geneva conference should start again, with the United
States attending and remaining. Perhaps in a direct confrontation
of the problem we w ill understand how we failed.
