# Powerline Interference Considered Since 1961
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
I Editor, The Daily:
The March 3 article on possible
interference to Stanford's radio
telescopes by the SLAC lines does
the University a disservice by im
plying that the matter has "re
cently been brought to light."
Facts are (1) that Radioscicnce
professors have been consulted by
SLAC planners on the problem of
power line interference since
i January 1961, (2» the cooperation
j received has been excellent, <3>
that all reasonable steps (short
of placing the lines underground)
have been taken to avoid inter
ference and (4) that when SLAC
was originally proposed to th e
Congress, Radioscience professors
were fully informed of the plan
to have an overhead line, and in
terposed no objection.
The only new element in the
situation is the circumstance that
the possibility of actually putting
the lines underground now seems
somewhat better than in 1961,
when it seemed hopelessly remote.
Since there can be no doubt that
overhead high-voltage power
lines represent a nuisance to Ra
dioscience, a decision to go under
ground would delight the cam
pus's Big Dishwashers.

Abbot: Will the meeting come to
order, please? Thank you.
Brothers, we are here today
to judge one who is not one
of our organization, but is still
a man namely, one Mr. Gall.
Now, you all have heard his
views. What do you think of
him?
Brother Paul: 1 can't suscribe to
his authoritarian views,
brother. He seems to accept
' popular notions without rver

considering them critically.
Brother Michael: Also, he has
this strange conception that
what he thinks is the only way.
He only seems to have one side
to his thought.
Brother Francis: He doesn't un
derstand that it's people such
as he who cause undue ignor
ance and unfounded prejudice
by only destructively and blan
kotly condemning the exterior
of our creed, while the true
meaning is deep in the interior.
He purposely overlooks what
he does not care to see and
publicly distorts what is in
actuality a valuable and sig
nificant organization.
Brother Jim: We must explain to
him that a man gets out of
something only what he puts
in. He wishes only to destroy.
Where is his love of brethren?
Whore is his Protestant spirit
of understanding?
Broter Paul: Perhaps he's the
devil in disguise?
Abbot: No. I don't think we have
to carry it to extremes. Then
we'd be guilty of precisely
what Mr. Gall is doing. How
ever, I thank God we don't
have to accept him into o u r
brotherhood, for he obviously
hasn't the slightest conception
of what the word means.
(Cheers.)

As a student member of th e
Student Affairs and Services Com
mittee, let me bring out some
facts which apparently have been
overlooked regarding the new
open house policy.
Until very recently. University
policy as well as aSSU bylaws
permitted two open houses per

week, with the dates to be selected
by the living group. A third eve
ning could be scheduled upon spe
cial request. It was brought to the
| attention of the Committee that
i some serious confusion existed re
garding this policy.
The Dean of Student's Office re
ported that some men's living
i groups were failing to inform
their members of scheduled open
houses, and that this had lead to
so m e embarrassing situations,
such as girls being accidentally
' confronted by nude men in the
hallways. In addition. The Dean's
Office reported some cases of dis
honesty among men's groups in
which girls were invited to op en
houses not actually scheduled to
take place.
As a result, several women's
groups requested some kind of
regularization of open house pol
icy. A quick check of the records
showed that approximately 80 per
cent of the registered open houses
were held either on Wednesday or
Friday evenings, or on Sunday
J afternoon. It was therefore sug
gested that these days be desig
■ nated for regular open houses.
This matter was first consid
ered by the Subcommittee on
Open Houses and Overnights, on
which two of the five members
are students. The recommenda
j tion of the Subcommittee was
I then proposed to the Committee
j of the whole, on which, of course,
I all three student members sit. No
J opposition was raised against the
I matter in the main Committee,
since it appeared that we were
simply eliminating confusion and
regularizing what was largely the
1 status quo.
The proposal put forth by the
Committee, and approved by Dr.
Sterling, is certainly not irrcco
cable, since Committee approval
was only given pending further
study. Further study may be de
, sirable, and I for one welcome
suggestions from anyone regard
! ing this matter.

Abbot: Will the meeting come to
order, please? Thank you.
Brothers, we are here today
to judge one who is not one
of our organization, but is still
a man namely, one Mr. Gall.
Now, you all have heard his
views. What do you think of
him?
Brother Paul: 1 can't suscribe to
his authoritarian views,
brother. He seems to accept
' popular notions without rver

considering them critically.
Brother Michael: Also, he has
this strange conception that
what he thinks is the only way.
He only seems to have one side
to his thought.
Brother Francis: He doesn't un
derstand that it's people such
as he who cause undue ignor
ance and unfounded prejudice
by only destructively and blan
kotly condemning the exterior
of our creed, while the true
meaning is deep in the interior.
He purposely overlooks what
he does not care to see and
publicly distorts what is in
actuality a valuable and sig
nificant organization.
Brother Jim: We must explain to
him that a man gets out of
something only what he puts
in. He wishes only to destroy.
Where is his love of brethren?
Whore is his Protestant spirit
of understanding?
Broter Paul: Perhaps he's the
devil in disguise?
Abbot: No. I don't think we have
to carry it to extremes. Then
we'd be guilty of precisely
what Mr. Gall is doing. How
ever, I thank God we don't
have to accept him into o u r
brotherhood, for he obviously
hasn't the slightest conception
of what the word means.

As a student member of th e
Student Affairs and Services Com
mittee, let me bring out some
facts which apparently have been
overlooked regarding the new
open house policy.
Until very recently. University
policy as well as aSSU bylaws
permitted two open houses per

week, with the dates to be selected
by the living group. A third eve
ning could be scheduled upon spe
cial request. It was brought to the
| attention of the Committee that
i some serious confusion existed re
garding this policy.
The Dean of Student's Office re
ported that some men's living
i groups were failing to inform
their members of scheduled open
houses, and that this had lead to
so m e embarrassing situations,
such as girls being accidentally
' confronted by nude men in the
hallways. In addition. The Dean's
Office reported some cases of dis
honesty among men's groups in
which girls were invited to op en
houses not actually scheduled to
take place.
As a result, several women's
groups requested some kind of
regularization of open house pol
icy. A quick check of the records
showed that approximately 80 per
cent of the registered open houses
were held either on Wednesday or
Friday evenings, or on Sunday
J afternoon. It was therefore sug
gested that these days be desig
■ nated for regular open houses.
This matter was first consid
ered by the Subcommittee on
Open Houses and Overnights, on
which two of the five members
are students. The recommenda
j tion of the Subcommittee was
I then proposed to the Committee
j of the whole, on which, of course,
I all three student members sit. No
J opposition was raised against the
I matter in the main Committee,
since it appeared that we were
simply eliminating confusion and
regularizing what was largely the
1 status quo.
The proposal put forth by the
Committee, and approved by Dr.
Sterling, is certainly not irrcco
cable, since Committee approval
was only given pending further
study. Further study may be de
, sirable, and I for one welcome
suggestions from anyone regard
! ing this matter.

I Editor, The Daily:
A Short Drama in a Monastery
i Meeting.
Abbot: Will the meeting come to
order, please? Thank you.
Brothers, we are here today
to judge one who is not one
of our organization, but is still
a man namely, one Mr. Gall.
Now, you all have heard his
views. What do you think of
him?
Brother Paul: 1 can't suscribe to
his authoritarian views,
brother. He seems to accept
' popular notions without rver

considering them critically.
Brother Michael: Also, he has
this strange conception that
what he thinks is the only way.
He only seems to have one side
to his thought.
Brother Francis: He doesn't un
derstand that it's people such
as he who cause undue ignor
ance and unfounded prejudice
by only destructively and blan
kotly condemning the exterior
of our creed, while the true
meaning is deep in the interior.
He purposely overlooks what
he does not care to see and
publicly distorts what is in
actuality a valuable and sig
nificant organization.
Brother Jim: We must explain to
him that a man gets out of
something only what he puts
in. He wishes only to destroy.
Where is his love of brethren?
Whore is his Protestant spirit
of understanding?
Broter Paul: Perhaps he's the
devil in disguise?
Abbot: No. I don't think we have
to carry it to extremes. Then
we'd be guilty of precisely
what Mr. Gall is doing. How
ever, I thank God we don't
have to accept him into o u r
brotherhood, for he obviously
hasn't the slightest conception
of what the word means.
(Cheers.)

Kditor, The Daily:
As a student member of th e
Student Affairs and Services Com
mittee, let me bring out some
facts which apparently have been
overlooked regarding the new
open house policy.
Until very recently. University
policy as well as aSSU bylaws
permitted two open houses per

week, with the dates to be selected
by the living group. A third eve
ning could be scheduled upon spe
cial request. It was brought to the
| attention of the Committee that
i some serious confusion existed re
garding this policy.
The Dean of Student's Office re
ported that some men's living
i groups were failing to inform
their members of scheduled open
houses, and that this had lead to
so m e embarrassing situations,
such as girls being accidentally
' confronted by nude men in the
hallways. In addition. The Dean's
Office reported some cases of dis
honesty among men's groups in
which girls were invited to op en
houses not actually scheduled to
take place.
As a result, several women's
groups requested some kind of
regularization of open house pol
icy. A quick check of the records
showed that approximately 80 per
cent of the registered open houses
were held either on Wednesday or
Friday evenings, or on Sunday
J afternoon. It was therefore sug
gested that these days be desig
■ nated for regular open houses.
This matter was first consid
ered by the Subcommittee on
Open Houses and Overnights, on
which two of the five members
are students. The recommenda
j tion of the Subcommittee was
I then proposed to the Committee
j of the whole, on which, of course,
I all three student members sit. No
J opposition was raised against the
I matter in the main Committee,
since it appeared that we were
simply eliminating confusion and
regularizing what was largely the
1 status quo.
The proposal put forth by the
Committee, and approved by Dr.
Sterling, is certainly not irrcco
cable, since Committee approval
was only given pending further
study. Further study may be de
, sirable, and I for one welcome
suggestions from anyone regard
! ing this matter.
