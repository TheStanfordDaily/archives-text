## New Republic Music: Variations On A Theme 
### Darryl R. Wold 
While lie was Secretary of Defense, Charles E. Wilson, former
head of General Motors, was roundly denounced for several can
did remarks, one of which was "What's good for Ceneral Motors
is good for the country. With the exception of General Mull
moose, this hasn't been repeated since.
The New Republic, however, prominent journal of the left, is
not willing to let this classic die. TRB, their W ashington cor
respondent, first tried it in disguise about a month and a half ago.
AT&T, says TRB, has a big debt outstanding, so why can t the
government? lluh?
Obviously pleased with the initial success of this little analogy,
three weeks later TKB struck again, this time with the real thing.
General Motors, said the column brazenly, is big and nobody com
plains, so why can't the government be big without anyone com
plaining? Furthermore, says TBB, getting back to the debt angle,
GM s debt is getting bigger every year. W ell, TKB and the New
Republic shouldn't worn too much; the government and its debt
is getting bigger every year, too, despite complaints from some
of its stockholders (the New Republic's term, not mine).
A corporation, though, must have income before it can borrow,
for its debt rest primarily on its earning capacity, and the same
il true of governments, whose earning capacity is the tax base.

BUT HIGH TAXES on the federal level make it doubly hard
on local governments, for not only must they convince their citi
zens that a proposed measure is worth the increased cost (most
state and local bond issues must be approved by the voters) but
they must compete with the federal government for the tax base.
The primary reason for the New Republic's concern for the
unhindered growth of the debt is its potential use to achieve what
whoever is in Washington and has an opinion and a listener
chooses to call desirable national goals or the best growth rate
for the economy.
Borrowed money is not only easier to get than tax money (or
at least it would be if it weren't for the "Puritan myths" of spend
onlv-w hat-you-earn held by some members of Congress), but
it has the effect of adding something to the economy that wasn't
first taken out. Thus the national debt becomes one ol the basic
tools of the Liberal politician-economist; without it he would have
to answer much more directly to taxpayer's protestations, and
would be severly restricted in his visions of managing the economy.
This is primarily what Conservatives challenge when they pro
test the growth of the national debt—the concept ol the govern
ment as a positive and active force in the economy. The federal
government is a significant factor in the economy merely by virtue
of its size, and care must be taken to prevent sudden shifts in gov
ernment spending from disrupting its normal functioning. But it
is not the role of the government to take unto itself the power to
step beyond the realm of exercising restraints and shape the econ
omy as it sees fit.
This assumption that the government should use the debt as
an economic tool is what allows TRB to liken the government to
GM and AT&T. But TRB judiciously avoided mentioning Stude
baker.

BUT HIGH TAXES on the federal level make it doubly hard
on local governments, for not only must they convince their citi
zens that a proposed measure is worth the increased cost (most
state and local bond issues must be approved by the voters) but
they must compete with the federal government for the tax base.
The primary reason for the New Republic's concern for the
unhindered growth of the debt is its potential use to achieve what
whoever is in Washington and has an opinion and a listener
chooses to call desirable national goals or the best growth rate
for the economy.
Borrowed money is not only easier to get than tax money (or
at least it would be if it weren't for the "Puritan myths" of spend
onlv-w hat-you-earn held by some members of Congress), but
it has the effect of adding something to the economy that wasn't
first taken out. Thus the national debt becomes one ol the basic
tools of the Liberal politician-economist; without it he would have
to answer much more directly to taxpayer's protestations, and
would be severly restricted in his visions of managing the economy.
This is primarily what Conservatives challenge when they pro
test the growth of the national debt—the concept ol the govern
ment as a positive and active force in the economy. The federal
government is a significant factor in the economy merely by virtue
of its size, and care must be taken to prevent sudden shifts in gov
ernment spending from disrupting its normal functioning. But it
is not the role of the government to take unto itself the power to
step beyond the realm of exercising restraints and shape the econ
omy as it sees fit.
This assumption that the government should use the debt as
an economic tool is what allows TRB to liken the government to
GM and AT&T. But TRB judiciously avoided mentioning Stude
baker.

While lie was Secretary of Defense, Charles E. Wilson, former
head of General Motors, was roundly denounced for several can
did remarks, one of which was "What's good for Ceneral Motors
is good for the country. With the exception of General Mull
moose, this hasn't been repeated since.
The New Republic, however, prominent journal of the left, is
not willing to let this classic die. TRB, their W ashington cor
respondent, first tried it in disguise about a month and a half ago.
AT&T, says TRB, has a big debt outstanding, so why can t the
government? lluh?
Obviously pleased with the initial success of this little analogy,
three weeks later TKB struck again, this time with the real thing.
General Motors, said the column brazenly, is big and nobody com
plains, so why can't the government be big without anyone com
plaining? Furthermore, says TBB, getting back to the debt angle,
GM s debt is getting bigger every year. W ell, TKB and the New
Republic shouldn't worn too much; the government and its debt
is getting bigger every year, too, despite complaints from some
of its stockholders (the New Republic's term, not mine).
A corporation, though, must have income before it can borrow,
for its debt rest primarily on its earning capacity, and the same
il true of governments, whose earning capacity is the tax base.
