# CRITICISM VOICED
## ASSU Polls Students On Library 
### BILL SMITH Associate Editor 
The Sub-Committee on Univer
sity Libraries of the ASSU Com
mittee on Academic Affairs lias
been working during Library
Week to gather student opinion
on library operations and facili
ties. More than 750 questionnaires

were handed out to students dur
ing the week, and about 25 per
cent have been returned. The
Committee asks thai those who
slill have questionnaires turn
them in to the ASSU Office this
week.
Mark Lohman, Chairman of the
Committee on Academic Affairs,
said, "It is universally recognized
by students and faculty that the
library here is inadequate, a n d
yel the Administration has been
unwilling to exert the necessary
drive to rectify the situation."
"BUILDING a new building is
a partial answer, but not the total
one." Lohman said. "The question
naires we have received indicate
that there are problems which a
new building will not answer.
There is a great deal of annoy
ance with the present facilities
and operations," he said.
Perhaps this annoyance is most
| apparent in the comments made
by students in the questionnaires.
One girl wrote: "I invite any
members of the administration
1 to visit the Library in the evening,
when at last the electric drills
are stilled, and hear ihe uproar
downstairs, outside the RBR. Stu
dents here explicitly demonstrate
their lack of respect for a library
, that is filthy, uncomfortable and
| poorly lit. A comparison with the
main lounge in Trcsidder Union
(which was never intended as a
study area, and where you can

hear a pin drop* is in order."
SllE CONTINUES: "I suggest
funds, funds for more books,
more employees, for new furni
ture, and for a comprehensive
spring cleaning. The proposed
new library will not be built in a
day.and it is imperative that
something be done now."
Other aspects of library opera
tions were questioned by stu
dents.
"My field is literature." one stu
dent said, "and in the past week
I tried to locate three different
books -one fiction and two criti
cisms. Although the library has
all three, they were all out. Re-
Calling books is not the answer.
More copies are needed."
THIS (.HAD STUDENT con
1 tinned: "Length of time that
books can be kept out should lie
reduced. Students seldom need a
book for one month."
These two criticisms were most
commonly voiced by students: a
shortage of duplicates and a need
for revision of check-out time
and check-out. procedures.
Students continually noted prob
lems with the staff in the library,
and the problems c entered around
the fact that there are just too
' few people to adequately police,
j operate and service a library.
IN ANSWEK to question six ot
the questionnaire "Are there
! enough research librarians?"
lone student said: "No! They try
' to help but there are too few of
! them. Couldn't there he marked

desks for different fields?"
Perhaps two suggestions by stu
dents illustrate the general opin
ion that the library is inconveni
ent, archaic and apparently ig
nored by the Administration when
the time comes to allocate funds
to University operations.
SAID ONE STUDENT: "The
washroom facilities in the Main
Libe are primitive, hopelessly in
adequate, very poorly and very
infrequently cleaned, and nearly
always crowded to full capacity.
Let us hope that the basement ad
dition will triple the head capa
city. (This is not a facetious sug
gestion.)"
Another suggested: "The main
stairs in front of the library on a
moonless night are lit only by the
feeble yellow glow from the doors.
A little light here may save some
one from serious injury."
The Committee on Academic
Affairs will submit a report on
the libraries to Legislature soon.
Perhaps a "little light" will lie
shed on a rather dark subject.
