# FOR GREEN FOOTHILLS'
## 10,000 Names Sought To Oppose Powerlines Petition To Go To Congress 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
A petition "to prevent scarring
; of mid-peninsula foothills is be
-1 ing circulated on campus this
: week by the Committee for Green
Foothills and the Loma Prieta
i Chapter of the Serra Club.
The petition to Congress is di-
I reeted against the construction
j of overhead powerlines to the
j S t a n 112 or d Linear Accelerator
!(SLACi. which Don Aitken, a
' member of the Board of Directors
of the Committee, says "would
; dictate the development of the
! area."
"Stanford University facilities
i cannot justify that type of dam
j age to surrounding areas. Stan
ford realizes this and is asking
for the extra funds from the
AEC," he said.
AITKEN SAID that the Com
! mittee is aiming for 10,000 sig-
I natures in the area which would
j prove to Congress "it is a region
; aland not a local problem."
Aitken also said that of 1,000
I Stanford signatures they hope to
get, they already have "between
four and five hundred." The peti
tions will continue to be circu
lated at engineering corner and
in dorms and offices until Fri
day.
Aitken added that he needs
students to sit at the table for
i the petit ion at Engineering
j Corner.
The chief stumbling block to
efforts to put SLAC powerlines
underground has been the cost.
Estimates for undergrounding a
line satisfactory to the AEC run
up to $3.0 million. The cheapest
possible overhead line would cost
around $600,000, and PG&E has
offered to spend as much as
$1,012,000 for a comprise line.
ANY MONEY beyond PG&E
: would have to come from Stan
j ford, the AEC, or local commu
nities. But up to this time the
(joint Congressional committee on
! Atomic Energy have said that the
j federal government: would not
pay any of the additional $2.6
million cost.
One attempted compromise sug-1
gested by Paul H. McClosky,'
Jr., a Palo Alto attorney repre
senting the Save Our Skyline
Committee, fell through when the
AEC and Stanford would not con
tribute enough money.
Another proposed compromise

to run the lines along the Juni
pcro-Serra Freeway on 70 foot
poles rather than the usual 140
foot towers was accepted by Stan
ford. SLAC, and PG&E, but has
been opposed by the local citizens
and was rejected by the Wood
side and San Mateo Country Plan
ning Commissions, although they
may reconsider them at a March
9 meeting.
A N O T II E li OBJECTION to
lines has been made by Professor
O. G. Villard, Jr., who feels that
the lines would interfere with
Stanford's radio telescopes. In a
letter in today's Daily Prof. Vil
lard says that although he raised
no objection to the overhead lines
when they were proposed in 1961,

a decision to put tlie lines under
ground "would delight" him.
If a compromise is not reached
by a March 9 deadline, the AEC
says that it will start condemning
land to build the line. In that .silu
ation, it is fell, the overhead lines
originally planned would be
built from the Jefferson Monte
Vista Substation to the project.
MeClosky has maintained that
the condemnation by the AEC
proceeding against land owners
in that area would cost enough to
pay a large part of the under
grounding costs. An estimate of
"between $750,000 and $1,300,000"
by Ryland Kelly of Hart, Brewer,
j and Kelly was given to MeClosky,

The chief stumbling block to

underground has been the cost.
Estimates for undergrounding a

up to $3.0 million. The cheapest
possible overhead line would cost
around $600,000, and PG&E has
offered to spend as much as
$1,012,000 for a comprise line.

Another proposed compromise

to run the lines along the Juni

poles rather than the usual 140
foot towers was accepted by Stan
