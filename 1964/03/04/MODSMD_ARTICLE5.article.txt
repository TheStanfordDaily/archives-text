### NORMAN GREENBERG 
"What is right. is right, and
what is wrong is wrong. You
have to delend the right and that
is all there is to it. If not. you
lose your self-respect, your honor,
and your life." Alton Drury, de
livering the annual Founders Day
Distinguished Alumnus lecture,
portrayed what amounted to a
conservative manifesto, entitled
"An American Faith."
He founds his trust upon "the
very human, the very interesting,
and often very challenging proc
ess of seeing men run their gov
ernment in their own way . . .
matching the stirring and the
laughable, combining high test
ing and low hypocrisy.''
lIK KXTOI.LKI) the Congress.

"which could not be more re
flective of the country than it
is." "There is no idealism which
does not find its echo in Congress.
110 prejudice which does not find
its sounding board."
In contrast to this system "hu
man" and "free" Is an enemy not
consisting of rational men to be
swayed by rational argument.
And Drury wonders whether
Communism's perfidy will be rec
ognized "now that one sick from
this disease has killed our Pres
ident."
But we hesitate to use I h a I
strength subject as we are to "the
four horsemen of the apocalypse"
and "a general moral and ethical
decline since World War II."
First, there is the "game of
let's pretend." "You can make

plans lor a future you have eon
signed to lie stillborn."
TIIE SECOND "horseman of
the apocalypse" is "our fantastic
over-sensitivity to world opinion."
"A self-consciousness close to
paralysis grips this nation." And
yet, he says,"it is obvious that
foreign opinion supports the
power that triumphs."
Third, there is an automatic
tendency among us to downgrade
the United States during crisis.
Finally, he laments the "habit of
ceaseless self-criticism" from the
press, the politicians, and even
the cinema.
"Out of what dark places of the
American mind do the four horse
men come to plague lis?" From
fear, he answers. "11 we wish to
live, we must be willing to die."
