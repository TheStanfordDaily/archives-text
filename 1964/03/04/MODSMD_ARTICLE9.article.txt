Legislators Urge
Action On Lines
SACRAMENTO (AP) â€” Two
San Mateo County legislators
urged Monday that Congress
step into the dispute over pro
posed power lines to the Stanford
University linear accelerator.
Assemblyman Carl Britschgi,
R-Redwood City, and Sen. Rich
ard J. Dolwig, R-San Mateo, each
introduced resolutions asking
Congress to have the lines placed
underground.
They said the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Pacific Gas
and Electric Co. changed their
plans to use existing power lines
at a lower voltage, as originally
envisioned.
"The additional cost of placing
the power lines underground is
only a small fraction of the total
cost of the accelerator," they said,
"but its cost in terms of perma
nent damage to the terrain and
its enjoyment by people born and
unborn is incalculable."
The proposed lines, carrying
220 million volts, would run six
miles through Portola Valley and
Woodside.
