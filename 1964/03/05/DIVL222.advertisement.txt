A CURSED CREATION
There are those who excuse sin by claming that God made evil as well as
good. Others assume that if God did not create evil, He at least tolerates I
it. Still others try to explain sin away by claiming that it does not exist.
Such arguments stem from misconceptions about the holiness and righteous
ness of God, and a misunderstanding of the awful curse of sin which fell upon
the earth as a result of man's disobedience to God in the beginning.
God did create the world perfect and beautiful, free from sin. He made
man a creature with responsibility for moral choices rather than a puppet I
on a string enslaved to divine will. In the garden man was given a choice i
between the path of faith and obedience to God and the path of self-assertion,
experimentation with evil, and its inescapable consequences. The penalty for
disobedience to God was clearly laid down to Adam:
"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of
it: for for in the day that thou eatcst thereof thou shalt surely die." Gen.
2:17.
As a result of man's disobedience to God. Death entered the world exactly I
as God had declared. Because of the fall, death is inherent in our physical
bodies and all are born spiritually dead.
'Wherefore as by one man sin entered the world, and death by sin; and
II so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." Rom. 5:12. ffl
The great work of Christ's sacrifice on the cross was required by the just
and righteous God of creation to undo the fall of man so that there might
exist a path of reconciliation to God open to all who would put their trust in
I Christ.
"For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the
obedience of one (Christ) shall many be made righteous . . . that as sin
hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto
eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord." Horn. 5:10-21.
I When man fell, he brought upon himself not only the curse and judgment
of Almighty God, but also plunged the entire creation into darkness:
"Unto the woman He (God) said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire I
(petition) shall be to thy husband, and He shall rule over thee. And unto
Adam He said, because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and
hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying thou shalt not eat |
of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake: in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee;
and thou shalt eat of the herb of the fields; in the sweat of thy face shalt
thou cat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou
taKen; for dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return." Gen. 3:16-19.
Ever since the fall, man has tried to undo the results of this great disaster.
Medicine and science have attempted to case suffering and death, to find
the solution to aging and the key to life, to control pests and wild animals,
and to improve the harvests that a cursed ground brings forth. Yet the great
weight of the curse remains upon the world and upon mankind. Ultimate
redemption is to be found only through faith in Jesus Christ. Christians are
those whose redemption has begun, who have the new nature of Christ im
planted within them. They have been born—again by God the Holy Spirit.
One day they will be fully redeemed and restored forever to close intimate
fellowship with God.
Just as Christians are guaranteed ultimate release from the curse of a sin
ful body and corrupt old nature, so also the animal kingdom one day will be
restored;
"For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us (Christians). For the
earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons
of God. For the creaturc was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope. Because the creature
itself also shall be delivered (set free) from the bondage of corruption into
the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the WHOLE
j CREATION groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only
| they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the spirit, even we
ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body."
Rom. 8:18-23.
| Should you be a non-Christian, that is, not bom-again, regenerated, and
indwelt by the Holy Spirit, you are spiritually dead, out of touch with God,
and blind to His truths. If you neglect or refuse the great salvation which
God offers, the event called physical death will separate you forever from
I God without hope of a second chance. Your decision to accept Jesus Christ
j will bring spiritual birth and living contract with God.

it. Still others try to explain sin away by claiming that it does not exist.
Such arguments stem from misconceptions about the holiness and righteous
ness of God, and a misunderstanding of the awful curse of sin which fell upon
the earth as a result of man's disobedience to God in the beginning.
God did create the world perfect and beautiful, free from sin. He made
man a creature with responsibility for moral choices rather than a puppet I
on a string enslaved to divine will. In the garden man was given a choice i
between the path of faith and obedience to God and the path of self-assertion,
experimentation with evil, and its inescapable consequences. The penalty for
disobedience to God was clearly laid down to Adam:
"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of
it: for for in the day that thou eatcst thereof thou shalt surely die." Gen.
2:17.
As a result of man's disobedience to God. Death entered the world exactly I
as God had declared. Because of the fall, death is inherent in our physical
bodies and all are born spiritually dead.
'Wherefore as by one man sin entered the world, and death by sin; and
II so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." Rom. 5:12. ffl
The great work of Christ's sacrifice on the cross was required by the just
and righteous God of creation to undo the fall of man so that there might
exist a path of reconciliation to God open to all who would put their trust in
I Christ.
"For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the
obedience of one (Christ) shall many be made righteous . . . that as sin
hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto
eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord." Horn. 5:10-21.
I When man fell, he brought upon himself not only the curse and judgment
of Almighty God, but also plunged the entire creation into darkness:
"Unto the woman He (God) said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire I
(petition) shall be to thy husband, and He shall rule over thee. And unto
Adam He said, because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and
hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying thou shalt not eat |
of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake: in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee;
and thou shalt eat of the herb of the fields; in the sweat of thy face shalt
thou cat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou
taKen; for dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return." Gen. 3:16-19.
Ever since the fall, man has tried to undo the results of this great disaster.
Medicine and science have attempted to case suffering and death, to find
the solution to aging and the key to life, to control pests and wild animals,
and to improve the harvests that a cursed ground brings forth. Yet the great
weight of the curse remains upon the world and upon mankind. Ultimate
redemption is to be found only through faith in Jesus Christ. Christians are
those whose redemption has begun, who have the new nature of Christ im
planted within them. They have been born—again by God the Holy Spirit.
One day they will be fully redeemed and restored forever to close intimate
fellowship with God.
Just as Christians are guaranteed ultimate release from the curse of a sin
ful body and corrupt old nature, so also the animal kingdom one day will be
restored;
"For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us (Christians). For the
earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons
of God. For the creaturc was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope. Because the creature
itself also shall be delivered (set free) from the bondage of corruption into
the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the WHOLE
j CREATION groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only
| they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the spirit, even we
ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body."
Rom. 8:18-23.
| Should you be a non-Christian, that is, not bom-again, regenerated, and
indwelt by the Holy Spirit, you are spiritually dead, out of touch with God,
and blind to His truths. If you neglect or refuse the great salvation which
God offers, the event called physical death will separate you forever from
I God without hope of a second chance. Your decision to accept Jesus Christ
j will bring spiritual birth and living contract with God.

exist a path of reconciliation to God open to all who would put their trust in
I Christ.
"For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the
obedience of one (Christ) shall many be made righteous . . . that as sin
hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto
eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord." Horn. 5:10-21.
I When man fell, he brought upon himself not only the curse and judgment
of Almighty God, but also plunged the entire creation into darkness:
"Unto the woman He (God) said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire I
(petition) shall be to thy husband, and He shall rule over thee. And unto
Adam He said, because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and
hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying thou shalt not eat |
of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake: in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee;
and thou shalt eat of the herb of the fields; in the sweat of thy face shalt
thou cat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou
taKen; for dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return." Gen. 3:16-19.
Ever since the fall, man has tried to undo the results of this great disaster.
Medicine and science have attempted to case suffering and death, to find
the solution to aging and the key to life, to control pests and wild animals,
and to improve the harvests that a cursed ground brings forth. Yet the great
weight of the curse remains upon the world and upon mankind. Ultimate
redemption is to be found only through faith in Jesus Christ. Christians are
those whose redemption has begun, who have the new nature of Christ im
planted within them. They have been born—again by God the Holy Spirit.
One day they will be fully redeemed and restored forever to close intimate
fellowship with God.
Just as Christians are guaranteed ultimate release from the curse of a sin
ful body and corrupt old nature, so also the animal kingdom one day will be
restored;
"For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us (Christians). For the
earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons
of God. For the creaturc was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope. Because the creature
itself also shall be delivered (set free) from the bondage of corruption into
the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the WHOLE
j CREATION groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only
| they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the spirit, even we
ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body."
Rom. 8:18-23.
| Should you be a non-Christian, that is, not bom-again, regenerated, and
indwelt by the Holy Spirit, you are spiritually dead, out of touch with God,
and blind to His truths. If you neglect or refuse the great salvation which
God offers, the event called physical death will separate you forever from
I God without hope of a second chance. Your decision to accept Jesus Christ
j will bring spiritual birth and living contract with God.

A CURSED CREATION
There are those who excuse sin by claming that God made evil as well as
good. Others assume that if God did not create evil, He at least tolerates I
it. Still others try to explain sin away by claiming that it does not exist.
Such arguments stem from misconceptions about the holiness and righteous
ness of God, and a misunderstanding of the awful curse of sin which fell upon
the earth as a result of man's disobedience to God in the beginning.
God did create the world perfect and beautiful, free from sin. He made
man a creature with responsibility for moral choices rather than a puppet I
on a string enslaved to divine will. In the garden man was given a choice i
between the path of faith and obedience to God and the path of self-assertion,
experimentation with evil, and its inescapable consequences. The penalty for
disobedience to God was clearly laid down to Adam:
"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of
it: for for in the day that thou eatcst thereof thou shalt surely die." Gen.
2:17.
As a result of man's disobedience to God. Death entered the world exactly I
as God had declared. Because of the fall, death is inherent in our physical
bodies and all are born spiritually dead.
'Wherefore as by one man sin entered the world, and death by sin; and
II so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." Rom. 5:12. ffl
The great work of Christ's sacrifice on the cross was required by the just
