# PALY-STANFORD DISPUTE
## Argument Over Hospital Administration 
### 
What arc the qualities needed
in a hospital administrator?
According to the Palo Alto
Times, there is a dispute on the
issue between the Stanford and
Palo Alto medical staffs of the
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital Cen
ter. A new administrator is being
sought for Ihe hospital.
DR. LOWELL A. RANTZ, head
of the Stanford staff, told the
hospital board of directors that
an administrator should be: 1)
Talented, intelligent, perceptive.
2) Experienced in a university
setting, with proven ability to
work with a university faculty.

13) He should be a physician.
He also suggested waiting with
selection of the administrator un
til after a new dean of the Stan
ford Medical School is named.
Dr. Richard Wilbur of the Palo
Alto staff said that his group
agrees with the first qualification
listed. He questioned, however,
whether experience with a uni
versity hospital is a prerequisite.
He also said that a medical de
gree is unnecessary for an ad
ministrator; and did not think
that the selection should wait un
til a medical school dean has been
chosen.
Dr. Rantz told the Daily that
there is no great split, and that
all the candidates being inter
viewed have had university hos
pital experience, so there was no
problem.
THE HOSPITAL BOARD is
looking for an administrator re
placement for Oliver Deehan, who
resigned in January. One board
member noted that both of the
medical staffs, Palo Alto and
Stanford, are represented on the
selection committee. This note is
in reference to charges made by
by Palo Alto group that Stan
ford University is tending to dom
inate the hospital because the
medical school has an inside track
with the board of directors.
Palo Alto City Councilman, Ray
mond Rohrs denied that the uni
versity has any such undue in
fluence. If the connection between
the City Council and the hospital
is weaker, he said, it is because
the Stanford medical school is lo
cated right in the hospital build
ing, and the doctors have large
long-range projects which require
administrative help, while city
doctors are concerned mainly
with short-term patients.
ROHRS OBSERVED that the

Council is occupied primarily
with hospital budget matters, and
that councilmen have many other
governmental problems occupy
ing Ihem. They cannot get in
volved in the intricacies of the
hospital operation, and have de
cided to leave most operations up
to the board, and check up "from
time to time."
Dr. Wilbur said that an altern
ative to the trend to university
domination was for the city to
build its own hospital to take
care of "simpler" cases.

What arc the qualities needed
in a hospital administrator?
According to the Palo Alto
Times, there is a dispute on the
issue between the Stanford and
Palo Alto medical staffs of the
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital Cen
ter. A new administrator is being
sought for Ihe hospital.
DR. LOWELL A. RANTZ, head
of the Stanford staff, told the
hospital board of directors that
an administrator should be: 1)
Talented, intelligent, perceptive.
2) Experienced in a university
setting, with proven ability to
work with a university faculty.

13) He should be a physician.
He also suggested waiting with
selection of the administrator un
til after a new dean of the Stan
ford Medical School is named.
Dr. Richard Wilbur of the Palo
Alto staff said that his group
agrees with the first qualification
listed. He questioned, however,
whether experience with a uni
versity hospital is a prerequisite.
He also said that a medical de
gree is unnecessary for an ad
ministrator; and did not think
that the selection should wait un
til a medical school dean has been
chosen.
Dr. Rantz told the Daily that
there is no great split, and that
all the candidates being inter
viewed have had university hos
pital experience, so there was no
problem.
THE HOSPITAL BOARD is
looking for an administrator re
placement for Oliver Deehan, who
resigned in January. One board
member noted that both of the
medical staffs, Palo Alto and
Stanford, are represented on the
selection committee. This note is
in reference to charges made by
by Palo Alto group that Stan
ford University is tending to dom
inate the hospital because the
medical school has an inside track
with the board of directors.
Palo Alto City Councilman, Ray
mond Rohrs denied that the uni
versity has any such undue in
fluence. If the connection between
the City Council and the hospital
is weaker, he said, it is because
the Stanford medical school is lo
cated right in the hospital build
ing, and the doctors have large
long-range projects which require
administrative help, while city
doctors are concerned mainly
with short-term patients.
ROHRS OBSERVED that the

Council is occupied primarily
with hospital budget matters, and
that councilmen have many other
governmental problems occupy
ing Ihem. They cannot get in
volved in the intricacies of the
hospital operation, and have de
cided to leave most operations up
to the board, and check up "from
time to time."
Dr. Wilbur said that an altern
ative to the trend to university
domination was for the city to
build its own hospital to take
care of "simpler" cases.
