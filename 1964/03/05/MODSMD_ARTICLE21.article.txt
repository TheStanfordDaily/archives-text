# Frosh Season Ends
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Friday night the Stanford Frosh
basketball team will attempt to
take their third straight game
from the California Cubs. The
game will be played as a prelim
inary to the varsity tilt.
Cal has 6'B" Gary Cornellius
and 7' John Wardell sharing the
chores at center. Beside these
two Cal has a pair of jumping
jack guards, 6*l" Charlie Perkins
and (i' 2" Mike Jacobs. The last
two encounters these two have
scored over half of their team's
points.
To counter Perkins and Jacobs,
who hit almost at will on long
jump shots, Stanford center
Brock Gowdy with help from for
wards Kent Borchard and Bill
Kelso has done a good job keep
ing the Cal centers away from
the boards. In both games Stan
ford out rebounded the Cubs.
Saturday night the Frosh will
play their last game of the sea
son when they meet the Santa
Clara freshmen at San Jose Civic
auditorium. Last week the Frosh
lost to the Broncos by a score of
89-68.
It was one of the better played
games of the year as there were
only 10 fouls called the entire
game and rare ball handling mis
cues. Four Frosh scored in double
figures, but five Broncos hit for
double digits also.
