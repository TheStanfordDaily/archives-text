# ACCENT ON SPORTS
## Stanford Spirit Sporadic 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Stanford fans are clamoring for a now Pavilion, but thoy couldn't
even fill the old one when tho all-time Stanford scoring record
passed hands in impressive fashion. This Friday, Stanford battling
for a second place finish in the AAWLJ plays the Cal Golden Bears
in the rubber game of the three game series. California is Stanford's
arch-rival, but you'd never know this from attending basketball
games.
Last time the Beat's came to town Ihey went 1o press, finishing
the evening with few typographical errors, and edged the Indians by
7, 59-52. The game was a close one throughout, but the fans didn't
seem to care. Rooters at the Farm look at who the opponent is be
fore pushing the Stanford cause. Stanford had won easily the night
before at Berkeley by 12, and the fans thought another Indian victory
inevitable. Some fans cheered but their neighbors weren't in the;
mood so they decided to give up their efforts.
ACROSS THE WAY, one thousand Cal fans were whooping it up
urged on by their cheerleaders and to the tune of their band. The
night before, their exuberance overflowed a bit. Incensed by a
couple of calls against their team, they rained about the floor as
sorted debris and loudly booed the officials. Not only once, but twice,
Athletic Director PeteNewell had to try to control the crowd over
the public address system. Only a threat of forfeiture calmed the
riotous tendencies of the unsensible crowd. Stanford rooters are a [
hit more sensible, but perhaps too sensible as their vocal outbursts j
are more sporadic.
Following Cal into the Pavilion confines was UCLA. The Bruins
were number one, and how Stanford students can turn out to see
the number one team in the nation! Nobody can criticize the spirit
shown at the game. The foot-stomping, hand clapping, and yelling
of the Stanford students was a source of pride to all who are con-,
nected with Stanford athletics. What can be criticized is the large j
discrepancy, decibelly speaking, between the rooting efforts at the j
Cal and UCLA game, both close, hard fought contests.
Looking back at the game in which spirit has been high, we count ;
but three — the Notre Dame and Cal football games and the UCLA j
basketball games. The Cal game as the highpoint of the athletic
year had good spirit for obvious reasons. The reason for the high
spirit at the other two contests was primarily because of the great j
national recognition that Notre Dame and Cal had in Iheir fields. It
seems that Stanford rooters are willing to cheer on a Stanford team
against the best but are only willing to watch it play a mediocre
team. The closeness of the game has little to do with it.
THK INCONSISTENCY of the rooting has had an effect on the :
teams on the playing field. The team's best efforts have come on j
days when thespirit has been high, and their off days have coincided |
wilh low points in spirit. j
I haven't as yet mentioned the cheerleaders. Why should I? j
During the basketball season ,they haven't added significantly to the
spirit of the fans. Their repertoire is as limited as that of an elephant 1
(gymnast. They know but iwo cheers the traditional "Co, Cards"
and "Stanford Spell." They haven't yet come up with an ad lib
i cheer, the mark oi good cheerlertding. Perhaps they think it heresy,
but this is only heresay. They've had the opportunity for ad libbing
but the necessary mental exert ion hasn't been there. "We've got num
ber one onthe run," would've been an appropriate cheer during the
UCLA game.
Tomorrow night, 1,015 Cal students will come down to Stanford.
The rooters will be boisterous ,and the team will be up for the game.
To upset the home court jinx that has prevailed in the last five
games of the Stanford-Cal series, Stanford will have to eliminate
the kinks that it had the last time around. Co-captains Mollis Moore
and Tom Dose, whose every bucket is a record breaker, will be play
ing their last game in a Stanford varsity uniform and will wfint it to
he one of their best:. We hopethe spirit is good, but we are skeptical.
California is not a nationally ranked team, they have no outstanding
star, and they have just been demolished by the Uclans.
Stanford fans may someday learn that spirit at a close game j
should be great no matter who the opponent.

During the basketball season ,they haven't added significantly to the
spirit of the fans. Their repertoire is as limited as that of an elephant 1

and "Stanford Spell." They haven't yet come up with an ad lib

but this is only heresay. They've had the opportunity for ad libbing
but the necessary mental exert ion hasn't been there. "We've got num
ber one onthe run," would've been an appropriate cheer during the
UCLA game.
Tomorrow night, 1,015 Cal students will come down to Stanford.
The rooters will be boisterous ,and the team will be up for the game.
To upset the home court jinx that has prevailed in the last five
games of the Stanford-Cal series, Stanford will have to eliminate
the kinks that it had the last time around. Co-captains Mollis Moore
and Tom Dose, whose every bucket is a record breaker, will be play

California is not a nationally ranked team, they have no outstanding
star, and they have just been demolished by the Uclans.
Stanford fans may someday learn that spirit at a close game j
should be great no matter who the opponent.

Stanford fans are clamoring for a now Pavilion, but thoy couldn't
even fill the old one when tho all-time Stanford scoring record
passed hands in impressive fashion. This Friday, Stanford battling
for a second place finish in the AAWLJ plays the Cal Golden Bears
in the rubber game of the three game series. California is Stanford's
arch-rival, but you'd never know this from attending basketball
games.
Last time the Beat's came to town Ihey went 1o press, finishing
the evening with few typographical errors, and edged the Indians by
7, 59-52. The game was a close one throughout, but the fans didn't
seem to care. Rooters at the Farm look at who the opponent is be
fore pushing the Stanford cause. Stanford had won easily the night
before at Berkeley by 12, and the fans thought another Indian victory
inevitable. Some fans cheered but their neighbors weren't in the;
mood so they decided to give up their efforts.
ACROSS THE WAY, one thousand Cal fans were whooping it up
urged on by their cheerleaders and to the tune of their band. The
night before, their exuberance overflowed a bit. Incensed by a
couple of calls against their team, they rained about the floor as
sorted debris and loudly booed the officials. Not only once, but twice,
Athletic Director PeteNewell had to try to control the crowd over
the public address system. Only a threat of forfeiture calmed the
riotous tendencies of the unsensible crowd. Stanford rooters are a [
hit more sensible, but perhaps too sensible as their vocal outbursts j
are more sporadic.
Following Cal into the Pavilion confines was UCLA. The Bruins
were number one, and how Stanford students can turn out to see
the number one team in the nation! Nobody can criticize the spirit
shown at the game. The foot-stomping, hand clapping, and yelling
of the Stanford students was a source of pride to all who are con-,
nected with Stanford athletics. What can be criticized is the large j
discrepancy, decibelly speaking, between the rooting efforts at the j
Cal and UCLA game, both close, hard fought contests.
