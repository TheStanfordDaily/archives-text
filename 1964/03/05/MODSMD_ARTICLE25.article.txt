# OUR GOLDEN HERITAGE
## An Aphorism For The Holy Family 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is
t In- Daily tribute to the Univer
sity Founders, Senator all (I
Mrs. I.eland Stanford. Foun
ders' day will be celebrated this
Sunday with traditional special
services in Memorial Church.

"It is pleasant to be rich,"
said Lei and Stanford one day.
And upon that mighty aphor
ism he built his life.
Well, it was pleasant to be
rich, and, even in an age of
Robber Barons, Stanford with
his multiple millions stood at
t lie top of a very imposing
heap. For nearly three decades,
he charged like a steam-pro
pclled Caesar through the Cali
fornia countryside.They could
hardly build triumphal arches
or gingerbread castles big
enough, and everywhere he
went, he scattered noblesse ob
lige like so many daisies. His
was a strange mixture of
gaudy ex t r a v a g a n c e and
gloomy conscience, a strange
mixture indeed.
What kind of man was this
incredible railroad kingpin?
Well, as biographer Oscar Lew
is notes, those who worshipped
him from afar, or those who
drained his pockets close up,
found mere words insufficient
to praise his infinite glories:
" 'Had he come at an earlier
era,' wrote one admirer, 'he
would have been a Christ or a
Confucius.' "
★ ★ ★
THOSE WHO knew Stan
ford better, however, were
more blunt in their appraisals:
"Leland Stanford is a damned
old fool," snarled business part
ner Huntington, a hard-nosed
Puritan who never took kindly
to Stanford's majesterial man
ner with cold cash.
A Central Pacific employee
noted sagely that Stanford had
"the ambition of an emperor
and the spite of a peanut ven
dor."
In any case, in his three dec
ades of power. Stanford at
tracted more than his share
of gratuitous praise and snide
abuse. His ruthlessness, his
overriding ambition, and, of
course, his monumental suc
cess earned him many enemies.
His apparent sincerity earned
him many admirers. For Stan
ford did appear to be a sincere
and earnest man.
In fact, however, this appar
ent; sincerity was merely a
fortunate result of Stanford's
essential dullness of mind and
wit and his painfully slow,
plodding manner of speech. As
biographer Lewis notes: " 'How
do you feel this morning, Gov
ernor?' required as long a per
iod of brooding concentration
as a query involving the safety
of the Republic."
EVEN THE excitement of
high-level politics was insuffi
cient to satisfy Stanford's rest
less desire for achievement. In
later years, a sad metamor
phoisis of power transferred
this restlessness into a virtual
paranoia. In fact, Stanford had
never been more than a figure
head in the western railroad
empire, a glorified, and
wealthy, public relations man
for his driving, but publicity
shy partner Huntington.
As the years progressed,
however, this disparity of pow
er became more and more ap

parent. Even Stanford himself
could not ignore the fact that
in some substantial and ironic
way he was a failure. As the
break with Huntington became
almost permanent, he turned
his furious energies to a my
riad of expensive, expansive
hobbies, with the determina
tion to be first, biggest, and
best in something.
The first need, of course,
was to sustain the illusion and
the facade of kingship. Hence,
whenever and wherever Stan
ford's plush private car
steamed down the track all
railroad employees were in
structed to assemble on the
right-of-way and salute and
cheer as the Central Pacific
Caesar passed by.
★ ★ ★
TH I S OVERWHELMING
personal vanity extended into
all spheres of Stanford's life.
In all things he indulged his
almost child-like love of gaudy
display, almost single-handedly
creating an era of preposter
ously bad taste.
His love of gadgetry was al
ways unbounded, but in the last
years, his interest span only
slightly exceeded that of a five
year-old child.
And then there was Vina,
a town of Stanford's own crea
tion, designed to house a vine
yard so big that man could
walk all day and not come to
the end of it. According to the
Governor's calculations, hi s
wines were destined to put
Franco out of business. But,
alas, the continental grape did
not take kindly to the scratchy
California soil, and the econ
omy of Europe breathed a sigh
of relief.
Stanford's biggest project,
however, was undoubtedly his
son. Little Leland was born in
18(38 and immediately became
the central concern of his par
ents' existence. Stanford was
determined that his son have
the cultural and educational
advantages which he had un
fortunately missed in his mid
dle class rise to power.
LITTLE LELAND was to
be more than a businessman;
he was to be America's Renais
sance man.
From his earliest years, the

boy was tutored and pampered
and generally cultivated; and,
like Thomas Mann's Hanno
Buddenbrooks, little Leland
showed a distinct artistic flair.
His parents proudly exhibited
the boy's primitive woodcrav
ings to anyone who would look.
In addition, little Leland early
showed a discriminating taste
for art treasures, a taste which
was most notably lacking in
his father.
However, as everyone on the
Board of Trustees knows, the
story of little Leland has a sad
ending. America was to be
denied her Renaissance Busi
nessman, for, on March 13,
1884, little Leland died of ty
phoid in a Florentine hotel,
leaving nothing but the rem
nants of his last breakfast
(which Mrs. Stanford carefully
preserved) for posterity.
But little Leland did not die
in vain. His body was hardly
cold when his parents threw
all their remaining energies
into a living monument to their
only son. Soon, like Phoenix
from the ashes, the towers of
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity rose into the clear Cali
fornia sky.
As it turned out, Junior's
university — deemed incred
ible from coast to coast — was
Leland Stanford's last great
extravagance. On June 20,
1893, he died suddenly at the
age of 69, leaving the manage
ment of the university, and the
settlement of a large financial
mess, in the hands of his
strong-willed widow Jane La
throp Stanford.
★ ★ ★
IT IS WITH Jane Stanford
lhat the history of the univer
sity, most properly begins. For
all of her remaining years,
Stanford University dominated
her life, and she, in turn, domi
nated the life of the university,
making it over in her own im
age for generations to come.
The ironic fact of these later
years was that the Stanfords,
and hence Stanford University,
were in financial trouble. In
the last phase of his life, Stan
ford's extravagant hobbies
had made a sizable dent in
even his prodigious fortune.
Moreover, trouble with ruth

less partner Huntington had
plunged the Central Pacific
Caesar to near economic dis
aster. At his death, the Stan
ford estate was throw into pro
bate court and there it re
mained for a disastrously
lengthy period of time.
In the meantime, there was a
university to run, and, as funds
away, it appeared
lliat Leland Stanford's educa
tional flyer was doomed indeed.
Then, just when all seemed
lost, in stepped Jane Stanford,
slashing costs, pawning h e r
jewels, and generally conduct
ing an austerity campaign
that wo Li 1 d have made even
Lyndon Johnson back away in
awe.
IN THE NEXT few years.
Jane Stanford virtually cor
nered the market on self-sacri
fice. She was the holy mother,
martyring herself in the name
of posterity — Lady Bountiful
in black silk, living to prove
that Leland Stanford had
meant what he said when he
proclaimed (after little Le
land's death): "The children
of California shall be my chil
dren."
Queen Victoria (to whom she
bore a remarkable physical re
semblance) had long been her
idol, and she played out her
royal drama on the Stanford
campus with a real relish. Un
til nearly the end of the cen
tury, she ruled her realm.
In her later years, Mrs. Stan
ford's morbid attachment to
the memory of her dead son
intensified to the point of vir
tual neurosis, and she became
increasingly religious, although
never indulging in the frank
spiritualism to which her hus
band. at one point, had been
addicted.
★ ★ ★
IN FACT, Leland's brother
Tom headed a notorious spirit
ualism circle in Australia, and
sponsored a medium named
Charlie Bailv who consistently
"materialized" various and sun
dry ancient oriental artifacts,
many ol which apparently re
side, boxed and crated in the
basement of the Stanford mu
seum. Indeed, at his death the
great table-tapper reportedly
endowed Stanford with a chair
for the study of the occult, the
use of which has bothered Stan
ford administrations ever since.
Toward the very end of her
life. Mrs. Stanford became in
creasingly subject to delusions
of persecution, and the lurid
mystery surrounding her sud
den death suggests that per
haps there was some substance
to her delusions.
For weeks, the "Daily Palo
Alto" was bordered in black,
its pages filled with florid reso
lutions of mourning. The fun
eral was magnificent, the floral
arrangements lavish, the
hushed silences awesome, the
hymns traditional and sonorous
all in keeping with the Stan
ford tradition, that strange
mixture of the lavish and the
other worldly.
The inscription on the crypt:
"JANE LATHROP STAN
FORD. Born to Mortality Aug
ust 25. 1828, Passed to Immor
tality February 28, 1905." And.
on March 24, 1905, while the
assembled students sang "Hail,
Stanford, Hail," th e great
bronze doors to the Stanford's
little Greek temple clanged
shut.

rich, and, even in an age of
Robber Barons, Stanford with
his multiple millions stood at
t lie top of a very imposing
heap. For nearly three decades,
he charged like a steam-pro
pclled Caesar through the Cali
fornia countryside.They could
hardly build triumphal arches
or gingerbread castles big
enough, and everywhere he
went, he scattered noblesse ob
lige like so many daisies. His
was a strange mixture of
gaudy ex t r a v a g a n c e and
gloomy conscience, a strange
mixture indeed.
What kind of man was this
incredible railroad kingpin?
Well, as biographer Oscar Lew
is notes, those who worshipped
him from afar, or those who
drained his pockets close up,
found mere words insufficient
to praise his infinite glories:
" 'Had he come at an earlier
era,' wrote one admirer, 'he
would have been a Christ or a
Confucius.' "
★ ★ ★
THOSE WHO knew Stan
ford better, however, were
more blunt in their appraisals:
"Leland Stanford is a damned
old fool," snarled business part
ner Huntington, a hard-nosed
Puritan who never took kindly
to Stanford's majesterial man
ner with cold cash.
A Central Pacific employee
noted sagely that Stanford had
"the ambition of an emperor
and the spite of a peanut ven
dor."
In any case, in his three dec
ades of power. Stanford at
tracted more than his share
of gratuitous praise and snide
abuse. His ruthlessness, his
overriding ambition, and, of
course, his monumental suc
cess earned him many enemies.
His apparent sincerity earned
him many admirers. For Stan
ford did appear to be a sincere
and earnest man.
In fact, however, this appar
ent; sincerity was merely a
fortunate result of Stanford's
essential dullness of mind and
wit and his painfully slow,
plodding manner of speech. As
biographer Lewis notes: " 'How
do you feel this morning, Gov
ernor?' required as long a per
iod of brooding concentration
as a query involving the safety
of the Republic."
EVEN THE excitement of
high-level politics was insuffi
cient to satisfy Stanford's rest
less desire for achievement. In
later years, a sad metamor
phoisis of power transferred
this restlessness into a virtual
paranoia. In fact, Stanford had
never been more than a figure
head in the western railroad
empire, a glorified, and
wealthy, public relations man
for his driving, but publicity
shy partner Huntington.
As the years progressed,
however, this disparity of pow
er became more and more ap

parent. Even Stanford himself
could not ignore the fact that
in some substantial and ironic
way he was a failure. As the
break with Huntington became
almost permanent, he turned
his furious energies to a my
riad of expensive, expansive
hobbies, with the determina
tion to be first, biggest, and
best in something.
The first need, of course,
was to sustain the illusion and
the facade of kingship. Hence,
whenever and wherever Stan
ford's plush private car
steamed down the track all
railroad employees were in
structed to assemble on the
right-of-way and salute and
cheer as the Central Pacific
Caesar passed by.
★ ★ ★
TH I S OVERWHELMING
personal vanity extended into
all spheres of Stanford's life.
In all things he indulged his
almost child-like love of gaudy
display, almost single-handedly
creating an era of preposter
ously bad taste.
His love of gadgetry was al
ways unbounded, but in the last
years, his interest span only
slightly exceeded that of a five
year-old child.
And then there was Vina,
a town of Stanford's own crea
tion, designed to house a vine
yard so big that man could
walk all day and not come to
the end of it. According to the
Governor's calculations, hi s
wines were destined to put
Franco out of business. But,
alas, the continental grape did
not take kindly to the scratchy
California soil, and the econ
omy of Europe breathed a sigh
of relief.
Stanford's biggest project,
however, was undoubtedly his
son. Little Leland was born in
18(38 and immediately became
the central concern of his par
ents' existence. Stanford was
determined that his son have
the cultural and educational
advantages which he had un
fortunately missed in his mid
dle class rise to power.
LITTLE LELAND was to
be more than a businessman;
he was to be America's Renais
sance man.
From his earliest years, the

boy was tutored and pampered
and generally cultivated; and,
like Thomas Mann's Hanno
Buddenbrooks, little Leland
showed a distinct artistic flair.
His parents proudly exhibited
the boy's primitive woodcrav
ings to anyone who would look.
In addition, little Leland early
showed a discriminating taste
for art treasures, a taste which
was most notably lacking in
his father.
However, as everyone on the
Board of Trustees knows, the
story of little Leland has a sad
ending. America was to be
denied her Renaissance Busi
nessman, for, on March 13,
1884, little Leland died of ty
phoid in a Florentine hotel,
leaving nothing but the rem
nants of his last breakfast
(which Mrs. Stanford carefully
preserved) for posterity.
But little Leland did not die
in vain. His body was hardly
cold when his parents threw
all their remaining energies
into a living monument to their
only son. Soon, like Phoenix
from the ashes, the towers of
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity rose into the clear Cali
fornia sky.
As it turned out, Junior's
university — deemed incred
ible from coast to coast — was
Leland Stanford's last great
extravagance. On June 20,
1893, he died suddenly at the
age of 69, leaving the manage
ment of the university, and the
settlement of a large financial
mess, in the hands of his
strong-willed widow Jane La
throp Stanford.
★ ★ ★
IT IS WITH Jane Stanford
lhat the history of the univer
sity, most properly begins. For
all of her remaining years,
Stanford University dominated
her life, and she, in turn, domi
nated the life of the university,
making it over in her own im
age for generations to come.
The ironic fact of these later
years was that the Stanfords,
and hence Stanford University,
were in financial trouble. In
the last phase of his life, Stan
ford's extravagant hobbies
had made a sizable dent in
even his prodigious fortune.
Moreover, trouble with ruth

less partner Huntington had
plunged the Central Pacific
Caesar to near economic dis
aster. At his death, the Stan
ford estate was throw into pro
bate court and there it re
mained for a disastrously
lengthy period of time.
In the meantime, there was a
university to run, and, as funds
away, it appeared
lliat Leland Stanford's educa
tional flyer was doomed indeed.
Then, just when all seemed
lost, in stepped Jane Stanford,
slashing costs, pawning h e r
jewels, and generally conduct
ing an austerity campaign
that wo Li 1 d have made even
Lyndon Johnson back away in
awe.
IN THE NEXT few years.
Jane Stanford virtually cor
nered the market on self-sacri
fice. She was the holy mother,
martyring herself in the name
of posterity — Lady Bountiful
in black silk, living to prove
that Leland Stanford had
meant what he said when he
proclaimed (after little Le
land's death): "The children
of California shall be my chil
dren."
Queen Victoria (to whom she
bore a remarkable physical re
semblance) had long been her
idol, and she played out her
royal drama on the Stanford
campus with a real relish. Un
til nearly the end of the cen
tury, she ruled her realm.
In her later years, Mrs. Stan
ford's morbid attachment to
the memory of her dead son
intensified to the point of vir
tual neurosis, and she became
increasingly religious, although
never indulging in the frank
spiritualism to which her hus
band. at one point, had been
addicted.
★ ★ ★
IN FACT, Leland's brother
Tom headed a notorious spirit
ualism circle in Australia, and
sponsored a medium named
Charlie Bailv who consistently
"materialized" various and sun
dry ancient oriental artifacts,
many ol which apparently re
side, boxed and crated in the
basement of the Stanford mu
seum. Indeed, at his death the
great table-tapper reportedly
endowed Stanford with a chair
for the study of the occult, the
use of which has bothered Stan
ford administrations ever since.
Toward the very end of her
life. Mrs. Stanford became in
creasingly subject to delusions
of persecution, and the lurid
mystery surrounding her sud
den death suggests that per
haps there was some substance
to her delusions.
For weeks, the "Daily Palo
Alto" was bordered in black,
its pages filled with florid reso
lutions of mourning. The fun
eral was magnificent, the floral
arrangements lavish, the
hushed silences awesome, the
hymns traditional and sonorous
all in keeping with the Stan
ford tradition, that strange
mixture of the lavish and the
other worldly.
The inscription on the crypt:
"JANE LATHROP STAN
FORD. Born to Mortality Aug
ust 25. 1828, Passed to Immor

on March 24, 1905, while the

bronze doors to the Stanford's

shut.

gaudy ex t r a v a g a n c e and
gloomy conscience, a strange
mixture indeed.
What kind of man was this
incredible railroad kingpin?
Well, as biographer Oscar Lew
is notes, those who worshipped
him from afar, or those who
drained his pockets close up,
found mere words insufficient
to praise his infinite glories:
" 'Had he come at an earlier
era,' wrote one admirer, 'he
would have been a Christ or a
Confucius.' "
★ ★ ★
THOSE WHO knew Stan
ford better, however, were
more blunt in their appraisals:
"Leland Stanford is a damned
old fool," snarled business part
ner Huntington, a hard-nosed
Puritan who never took kindly
to Stanford's majesterial man
ner with cold cash.
A Central Pacific employee
noted sagely that Stanford had
"the ambition of an emperor
and the spite of a peanut ven
dor."
In any case, in his three dec
ades of power. Stanford at
tracted more than his share
of gratuitous praise and snide
abuse. His ruthlessness, his
overriding ambition, and, of
course, his monumental suc
cess earned him many enemies.
His apparent sincerity earned
him many admirers. For Stan
ford did appear to be a sincere
and earnest man.
In fact, however, this appar
ent; sincerity was merely a
fortunate result of Stanford's
essential dullness of mind and
wit and his painfully slow,
plodding manner of speech. As
biographer Lewis notes: " 'How
do you feel this morning, Gov
ernor?' required as long a per
iod of brooding concentration
as a query involving the safety
of the Republic."
EVEN THE excitement of
high-level politics was insuffi
cient to satisfy Stanford's rest
less desire for achievement. In
later years, a sad metamor
phoisis of power transferred
this restlessness into a virtual
paranoia. In fact, Stanford had
never been more than a figure
head in the western railroad
empire, a glorified, and
wealthy, public relations man
for his driving, but publicity
shy partner Huntington.
As the years progressed,
however, this disparity of pow
er became more and more ap

parent. Even Stanford himself
could not ignore the fact that
in some substantial and ironic
way he was a failure. As the
break with Huntington became
almost permanent, he turned
his furious energies to a my
riad of expensive, expansive
hobbies, with the determina
tion to be first, biggest, and
best in something.
The first need, of course,
was to sustain the illusion and
the facade of kingship. Hence,
whenever and wherever Stan
ford's plush private car
steamed down the track all
railroad employees were in
structed to assemble on the
right-of-way and salute and
cheer as the Central Pacific
Caesar passed by.
★ ★ ★
TH I S OVERWHELMING
personal vanity extended into
all spheres of Stanford's life.
In all things he indulged his
almost child-like love of gaudy
display, almost single-handedly
creating an era of preposter
ously bad taste.
His love of gadgetry was al
ways unbounded, but in the last
years, his interest span only
slightly exceeded that of a five
year-old child.
And then there was Vina,
a town of Stanford's own crea
tion, designed to house a vine
yard so big that man could
walk all day and not come to
the end of it. According to the
Governor's calculations, hi s
wines were destined to put
Franco out of business. But,
alas, the continental grape did
not take kindly to the scratchy
California soil, and the econ
omy of Europe breathed a sigh
of relief.
Stanford's biggest project,
however, was undoubtedly his
son. Little Leland was born in
18(38 and immediately became
the central concern of his par
ents' existence. Stanford was
determined that his son have
the cultural and educational
advantages which he had un
fortunately missed in his mid
dle class rise to power.
LITTLE LELAND was to
be more than a businessman;
he was to be America's Renais
sance man.
From his earliest years, the

boy was tutored and pampered
and generally cultivated; and,
like Thomas Mann's Hanno
Buddenbrooks, little Leland
showed a distinct artistic flair.
His parents proudly exhibited
the boy's primitive woodcrav
ings to anyone who would look.
In addition, little Leland early
showed a discriminating taste
for art treasures, a taste which
was most notably lacking in
his father.
However, as everyone on the
Board of Trustees knows, the
story of little Leland has a sad
ending. America was to be
denied her Renaissance Busi
nessman, for, on March 13,
1884, little Leland died of ty
phoid in a Florentine hotel,
leaving nothing but the rem
nants of his last breakfast
(which Mrs. Stanford carefully
preserved) for posterity.
But little Leland did not die
in vain. His body was hardly
cold when his parents threw
all their remaining energies
into a living monument to their
only son. Soon, like Phoenix
from the ashes, the towers of
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity rose into the clear Cali
fornia sky.
As it turned out, Junior's
university — deemed incred
ible from coast to coast — was
Leland Stanford's last great
extravagance. On June 20,
1893, he died suddenly at the
age of 69, leaving the manage
ment of the university, and the
settlement of a large financial
mess, in the hands of his
strong-willed widow Jane La
throp Stanford.
★ ★ ★
IT IS WITH Jane Stanford
lhat the history of the univer
sity, most properly begins. For
all of her remaining years,
Stanford University dominated
her life, and she, in turn, domi
nated the life of the university,
making it over in her own im
age for generations to come.
The ironic fact of these later
years was that the Stanfords,
and hence Stanford University,
were in financial trouble. In
the last phase of his life, Stan
ford's extravagant hobbies
had made a sizable dent in
even his prodigious fortune.
Moreover, trouble with ruth

less partner Huntington had
plunged the Central Pacific
Caesar to near economic dis
aster. At his death, the Stan
ford estate was throw into pro
bate court and there it re
mained for a disastrously
lengthy period of time.
In the meantime, there was a
university to run, and, as funds
away, it appeared
lliat Leland Stanford's educa
tional flyer was doomed indeed.
Then, just when all seemed
lost, in stepped Jane Stanford,
slashing costs, pawning h e r
jewels, and generally conduct
ing an austerity campaign
that wo Li 1 d have made even
Lyndon Johnson back away in
awe.
IN THE NEXT few years.
Jane Stanford virtually cor
nered the market on self-sacri
fice. She was the holy mother,
martyring herself in the name
of posterity — Lady Bountiful
in black silk, living to prove
that Leland Stanford had
meant what he said when he
proclaimed (after little Le
land's death): "The children
of California shall be my chil
dren."
Queen Victoria (to whom she
bore a remarkable physical re
semblance) had long been her
idol, and she played out her
royal drama on the Stanford
campus with a real relish. Un
til nearly the end of the cen
tury, she ruled her realm.
In her later years, Mrs. Stan
ford's morbid attachment to
the memory of her dead son
intensified to the point of vir
tual neurosis, and she became
increasingly religious, although
never indulging in the frank
spiritualism to which her hus
band. at one point, had been
addicted.
★ ★ ★
IN FACT, Leland's brother
Tom headed a notorious spirit
ualism circle in Australia, and
sponsored a medium named
Charlie Bailv who consistently
"materialized" various and sun
dry ancient oriental artifacts,
many ol which apparently re
side, boxed and crated in the
basement of the Stanford mu
seum. Indeed, at his death the
great table-tapper reportedly
endowed Stanford with a chair
for the study of the occult, the
use of which has bothered Stan
ford administrations ever since.
Toward the very end of her
life. Mrs. Stanford became in
creasingly subject to delusions
of persecution, and the lurid
mystery surrounding her sud
den death suggests that per
haps there was some substance
to her delusions.
For weeks, the "Daily Palo
Alto" was bordered in black,
its pages filled with florid reso
lutions of mourning. The fun
eral was magnificent, the floral
arrangements lavish, the
hushed silences awesome, the
hymns traditional and sonorous
all in keeping with the Stan
ford tradition, that strange
mixture of the lavish and the
other worldly.
The inscription on the crypt:
"JANE LATHROP STAN
FORD. Born to Mortality Aug
ust 25. 1828, Passed to Immor
tality February 28, 1905." And.
on March 24, 1905, while the
assembled students sang "Hail,
Stanford, Hail," th e great
bronze doors to the Stanford's
little Greek temple clanged
shut.

THOSE WHO knew Stan
ford better, however, were
more blunt in their appraisals:
"Leland Stanford is a damned
old fool," snarled business part
ner Huntington, a hard-nosed
Puritan who never took kindly
to Stanford's majesterial man
ner with cold cash.
A Central Pacific employee
noted sagely that Stanford had
"the ambition of an emperor
and the spite of a peanut ven
dor."
In any case, in his three dec
ades of power. Stanford at
tracted more than his share
of gratuitous praise and snide
abuse. His ruthlessness, his
overriding ambition, and, of
course, his monumental suc
cess earned him many enemies.
His apparent sincerity earned
him many admirers. For Stan
ford did appear to be a sincere
and earnest man.
In fact, however, this appar
ent; sincerity was merely a
fortunate result of Stanford's
essential dullness of mind and
wit and his painfully slow,
plodding manner of speech. As
biographer Lewis notes: " 'How
do you feel this morning, Gov
ernor?' required as long a per
iod of brooding concentration
as a query involving the safety
of the Republic."
EVEN THE excitement of
high-level politics was insuffi
cient to satisfy Stanford's rest
less desire for achievement. In
later years, a sad metamor
phoisis of power transferred
this restlessness into a virtual
paranoia. In fact, Stanford had
never been more than a figure
head in the western railroad
empire, a glorified, and
wealthy, public relations man
for his driving, but publicity
shy partner Huntington.
As the years progressed,
however, this disparity of pow
er became more and more ap

parent. Even Stanford himself
could not ignore the fact that
in some substantial and ironic
way he was a failure. As the
break with Huntington became
almost permanent, he turned
his furious energies to a my
riad of expensive, expansive
hobbies, with the determina
tion to be first, biggest, and
best in something.
The first need, of course,
was to sustain the illusion and
the facade of kingship. Hence,
whenever and wherever Stan
ford's plush private car
steamed down the track all
railroad employees were in
structed to assemble on the
right-of-way and salute and
cheer as the Central Pacific
Caesar passed by.
★ ★ ★
TH I S OVERWHELMING
personal vanity extended into
all spheres of Stanford's life.
In all things he indulged his
almost child-like love of gaudy
display, almost single-handedly
creating an era of preposter
ously bad taste.
His love of gadgetry was al
ways unbounded, but in the last
years, his interest span only
slightly exceeded that of a five
year-old child.
And then there was Vina,
a town of Stanford's own crea
tion, designed to house a vine
yard so big that man could
walk all day and not come to
the end of it. According to the
Governor's calculations, hi s
wines were destined to put
Franco out of business. But,
alas, the continental grape did
not take kindly to the scratchy
California soil, and the econ
omy of Europe breathed a sigh
of relief.
Stanford's biggest project,
however, was undoubtedly his
son. Little Leland was born in
18(38 and immediately became
the central concern of his par
ents' existence. Stanford was
determined that his son have
the cultural and educational
advantages which he had un
fortunately missed in his mid
dle class rise to power.
LITTLE LELAND was to
be more than a businessman;
he was to be America's Renais
sance man.
From his earliest years, the

boy was tutored and pampered
and generally cultivated; and,
like Thomas Mann's Hanno
Buddenbrooks, little Leland
showed a distinct artistic flair.
His parents proudly exhibited
the boy's primitive woodcrav
ings to anyone who would look.
In addition, little Leland early
showed a discriminating taste
for art treasures, a taste which
was most notably lacking in
his father.
However, as everyone on the
Board of Trustees knows, the
story of little Leland has a sad
ending. America was to be
denied her Renaissance Busi
nessman, for, on March 13,
1884, little Leland died of ty
phoid in a Florentine hotel,
leaving nothing but the rem
nants of his last breakfast
(which Mrs. Stanford carefully
preserved) for posterity.
But little Leland did not die
in vain. His body was hardly
cold when his parents threw
all their remaining energies
into a living monument to their
only son. Soon, like Phoenix
from the ashes, the towers of
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity rose into the clear Cali
fornia sky.
As it turned out, Junior's
university — deemed incred
ible from coast to coast — was
Leland Stanford's last great
extravagance. On June 20,
1893, he died suddenly at the
age of 69, leaving the manage
ment of the university, and the
settlement of a large financial
mess, in the hands of his
strong-willed widow Jane La
throp Stanford.
★ ★ ★
IT IS WITH Jane Stanford
lhat the history of the univer
sity, most properly begins. For
all of her remaining years,
Stanford University dominated
her life, and she, in turn, domi
nated the life of the university,
making it over in her own im
age for generations to come.
The ironic fact of these later
years was that the Stanfords,
and hence Stanford University,
were in financial trouble. In
the last phase of his life, Stan
ford's extravagant hobbies
had made a sizable dent in
even his prodigious fortune.
Moreover, trouble with ruth

less partner Huntington had
plunged the Central Pacific
Caesar to near economic dis
aster. At his death, the Stan
ford estate was throw into pro
bate court and there it re
mained for a disastrously
lengthy period of time.
In the meantime, there was a
university to run, and, as funds
away, it appeared
lliat Leland Stanford's educa
tional flyer was doomed indeed.
Then, just when all seemed
lost, in stepped Jane Stanford,
slashing costs, pawning h e r
jewels, and generally conduct
ing an austerity campaign
that wo Li 1 d have made even
Lyndon Johnson back away in
awe.
IN THE NEXT few years.
Jane Stanford virtually cor
nered the market on self-sacri
fice. She was the holy mother,
martyring herself in the name
of posterity — Lady Bountiful
in black silk, living to prove
that Leland Stanford had
meant what he said when he
proclaimed (after little Le
land's death): "The children
of California shall be my chil
dren."
Queen Victoria (to whom she
bore a remarkable physical re
semblance) had long been her
idol, and she played out her
royal drama on the Stanford
campus with a real relish. Un
til nearly the end of the cen
tury, she ruled her realm.
In her later years, Mrs. Stan
ford's morbid attachment to
the memory of her dead son
intensified to the point of vir
tual neurosis, and she became
increasingly religious, although
never indulging in the frank
spiritualism to which her hus
band. at one point, had been
addicted.
★ ★ ★
IN FACT, Leland's brother
Tom headed a notorious spirit
ualism circle in Australia, and
sponsored a medium named
Charlie Bailv who consistently
"materialized" various and sun
dry ancient oriental artifacts,
many ol which apparently re
side, boxed and crated in the
basement of the Stanford mu
seum. Indeed, at his death the
great table-tapper reportedly
endowed Stanford with a chair
for the study of the occult, the
use of which has bothered Stan
ford administrations ever since.
Toward the very end of her
life. Mrs. Stanford became in
creasingly subject to delusions
of persecution, and the lurid
mystery surrounding her sud
den death suggests that per
haps there was some substance
to her delusions.
For weeks, the "Daily Palo
Alto" was bordered in black,
its pages filled with florid reso
lutions of mourning. The fun
eral was magnificent, the floral
arrangements lavish, the
hushed silences awesome, the
hymns traditional and sonorous
all in keeping with the Stan
ford tradition, that strange
mixture of the lavish and the
other worldly.
The inscription on the crypt:
"JANE LATHROP STAN
FORD. Born to Mortality Aug
ust 25. 1828, Passed to Immor

on March 24, 1905, while the

bronze doors to the Stanford's

ism he built his life.
Well, it was pleasant to be
rich, and, even in an age of
Robber Barons, Stanford with
his multiple millions stood at
t lie top of a very imposing
heap. For nearly three decades,
he charged like a steam-pro
pclled Caesar through the Cali

hardly build triumphal arches
or gingerbread castles big
enough, and everywhere he
went, he scattered noblesse ob

was a strange mixture of
gaudy ex t r a v a g a n c e and
gloomy conscience, a strange
mixture indeed.
What kind of man was this
incredible railroad kingpin?
Well, as biographer Oscar Lew
is notes, those who worshipped
him from afar, or those who
drained his pockets close up,
found mere words insufficient
to praise his infinite glories:
" 'Had he come at an earlier
era,' wrote one admirer, 'he
would have been a Christ or a

ades of power. Stanford at
tracted more than his share
of gratuitous praise and snide
abuse. His ruthlessness, his
overriding ambition, and, of
course, his monumental suc
cess earned him many enemies.
His apparent sincerity earned
him many admirers. For Stan
ford did appear to be a sincere
and earnest man.
In fact, however, this appar
ent; sincerity was merely a
fortunate result of Stanford's
essential dullness of mind and
wit and his painfully slow,
plodding manner of speech. As
biographer Lewis notes: " 'How
do you feel this morning, Gov
ernor?' required as long a per
iod of brooding concentration
as a query involving the safety
of the Republic."
EVEN THE excitement of
high-level politics was insuffi
cient to satisfy Stanford's rest
less desire for achievement. In
later years, a sad metamor
phoisis of power transferred
this restlessness into a virtual
paranoia. In fact, Stanford had
never been more than a figure
head in the western railroad
empire, a glorified, and
wealthy, public relations man
for his driving, but publicity
shy partner Huntington.
As the years progressed,
however, this disparity of pow
er became more and more ap

parent. Even Stanford himself
could not ignore the fact that
in some substantial and ironic
way he was a failure. As the
break with Huntington became
almost permanent, he turned
his furious energies to a my
riad of expensive, expansive
hobbies, with the determina
tion to be first, biggest, and
best in something.
The first need, of course,
was to sustain the illusion and
the facade of kingship. Hence,
whenever and wherever Stan
ford's plush private car
steamed down the track all
railroad employees were in
structed to assemble on the
right-of-way and salute and
cheer as the Central Pacific
Caesar passed by.

TH I S OVERWHELMING
personal vanity extended into
all spheres of Stanford's life.
In all things he indulged his
almost child-like love of gaudy
display, almost single-handedly
creating an era of preposter
ously bad taste.
His love of gadgetry was al
ways unbounded, but in the last
years, his interest span only
slightly exceeded that of a five
year-old child.
And then there was Vina,
a town of Stanford's own crea
tion, designed to house a vine
yard so big that man could
walk all day and not come to
the end of it. According to the
Governor's calculations, hi s
wines were destined to put
Franco out of business. But,
alas, the continental grape did
not take kindly to the scratchy
California soil, and the econ
omy of Europe breathed a sigh
of relief.
Stanford's biggest project,
however, was undoubtedly his
son. Little Leland was born in
18(38 and immediately became
the central concern of his par
ents' existence. Stanford was
determined that his son have
the cultural and educational
advantages which he had un
fortunately missed in his mid
dle class rise to power.
LITTLE LELAND was to
be more than a businessman;
he was to be America's Renais
sance man.
From his earliest years, the

boy was tutored and pampered
and generally cultivated; and,
like Thomas Mann's Hanno
Buddenbrooks, little Leland
showed a distinct artistic flair.
His parents proudly exhibited
the boy's primitive woodcrav
ings to anyone who would look.
In addition, little Leland early
showed a discriminating taste
for art treasures, a taste which
was most notably lacking in
his father.
However, as everyone on the
Board of Trustees knows, the
story of little Leland has a sad
ending. America was to be
denied her Renaissance Busi
nessman, for, on March 13,
1884, little Leland died of ty
phoid in a Florentine hotel,
leaving nothing but the rem
nants of his last breakfast
(which Mrs. Stanford carefully
preserved) for posterity.
But little Leland did not die
in vain. His body was hardly
cold when his parents threw
all their remaining energies
into a living monument to their
only son. Soon, like Phoenix
from the ashes, the towers of
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity rose into the clear Cali
fornia sky.
As it turned out, Junior's
university — deemed incred
ible from coast to coast — was
Leland Stanford's last great
extravagance. On June 20,
1893, he died suddenly at the
age of 69, leaving the manage
ment of the university, and the
settlement of a large financial
mess, in the hands of his
strong-willed widow Jane La
throp Stanford.
★ ★ ★
IT IS WITH Jane Stanford
lhat the history of the univer
sity, most properly begins. For
all of her remaining years,
Stanford University dominated
her life, and she, in turn, domi
nated the life of the university,
making it over in her own im
age for generations to come.
The ironic fact of these later
years was that the Stanfords,
and hence Stanford University,
were in financial trouble. In
the last phase of his life, Stan
ford's extravagant hobbies
had made a sizable dent in
even his prodigious fortune.
Moreover, trouble with ruth

less partner Huntington had
plunged the Central Pacific
Caesar to near economic dis
aster. At his death, the Stan
ford estate was throw into pro
bate court and there it re
mained for a disastrously
lengthy period of time.
In the meantime, there was a
university to run, and, as funds
away, it appeared
lliat Leland Stanford's educa
tional flyer was doomed indeed.
Then, just when all seemed
lost, in stepped Jane Stanford,
slashing costs, pawning h e r
jewels, and generally conduct
ing an austerity campaign
that wo Li 1 d have made even
Lyndon Johnson back away in
awe.
IN THE NEXT few years.
Jane Stanford virtually cor
nered the market on self-sacri
fice. She was the holy mother,
martyring herself in the name
of posterity — Lady Bountiful
in black silk, living to prove
that Leland Stanford had
meant what he said when he
proclaimed (after little Le
land's death): "The children
of California shall be my chil
dren."
Queen Victoria (to whom she
bore a remarkable physical re
semblance) had long been her
idol, and she played out her
royal drama on the Stanford
campus with a real relish. Un
til nearly the end of the cen
tury, she ruled her realm.
In her later years, Mrs. Stan
ford's morbid attachment to
the memory of her dead son
intensified to the point of vir
tual neurosis, and she became
increasingly religious, although
never indulging in the frank
spiritualism to which her hus
band. at one point, had been
addicted.
★ ★ ★
IN FACT, Leland's brother
Tom headed a notorious spirit
ualism circle in Australia, and
sponsored a medium named
Charlie Bailv who consistently
"materialized" various and sun
dry ancient oriental artifacts,
many ol which apparently re
side, boxed and crated in the
basement of the Stanford mu
seum. Indeed, at his death the
great table-tapper reportedly
endowed Stanford with a chair
for the study of the occult, the
use of which has bothered Stan
ford administrations ever since.
Toward the very end of her
life. Mrs. Stanford became in
creasingly subject to delusions
of persecution, and the lurid
mystery surrounding her sud
den death suggests that per
haps there was some substance
to her delusions.
For weeks, the "Daily Palo
Alto" was bordered in black,
its pages filled with florid reso
lutions of mourning. The fun
eral was magnificent, the floral
arrangements lavish, the
hushed silences awesome, the
hymns traditional and sonorous
all in keeping with the Stan
ford tradition, that strange
mixture of the lavish and the
other worldly.
The inscription on the crypt:
"JANE LATHROP STAN

on March 24, 1905, while the

GOVERNOR STANFORD
The ambition of an emperor; the spite of a peanut vendor
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is

services in Memorial Church.

"It is pleasant to be rich,"
said Lei and Stanford one day.
And upon that mighty aphor
ism he built his life.
Well, it was pleasant to be
rich, and, even in an age of
Robber Barons, Stanford with
his multiple millions stood at
t lie top of a very imposing
heap. For nearly three decades,
he charged like a steam-pro
pclled Caesar through the Cali
fornia countryside.They could
hardly build triumphal arches
or gingerbread castles big
enough, and everywhere he
went, he scattered noblesse ob
lige like so many daisies. His
was a strange mixture of
gaudy ex t r a v a g a n c e and
gloomy conscience, a strange
mixture indeed.
What kind of man was this
incredible railroad kingpin?
Well, as biographer Oscar Lew
is notes, those who worshipped
him from afar, or those who
drained his pockets close up,
found mere words insufficient
to praise his infinite glories:
" 'Had he come at an earlier
era,' wrote one admirer, 'he
would have been a Christ or a
Confucius.' "
★ ★ ★
THOSE WHO knew Stan
ford better, however, were
more blunt in their appraisals:
"Leland Stanford is a damned
old fool," snarled business part
ner Huntington, a hard-nosed
Puritan who never took kindly
to Stanford's majesterial man
ner with cold cash.
A Central Pacific employee
noted sagely that Stanford had
"the ambition of an emperor
and the spite of a peanut ven
dor."
In any case, in his three dec
