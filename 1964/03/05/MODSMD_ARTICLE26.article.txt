## Weakness Of Student Selection Method Exhibited 
### 
lOdi(or, The Daily:
In regard to recent develop
ments in the controversy concern
ing open houses, the statement in
in Monday's Daily attributed to
me that "no living group leaders
were informed that the measure
was before the Student Affairs
and Services Committee" infers
that perhaps this is the fault of
the administration. This is not
I lie case. Three students are mem
bers of that committee and the
fault that neither any living
group presidents, LASSU, nor the
president of the student body had
any notion that this matter was
being discussed in the Student
Affairs and Services Committee
rests with them and their means
of communications with the rest
of the students.
However, this does seem to me
to point out one of the primary
weaknesses of the method of
selection of students of Presiden
tial committees — that students
serving on the President's Stu
dent Advisory Committee are in
eligible to serve on any other
commit lees. Surely the students
who is most aware el wliiub

issues concern which segments of
the student body and who is best
able to communicate that these
issues are being discussed to
those concerned is the student
body president. Yet he is banned
from serving on this committee.

I am concerned over the ten
dency to use the term University
as a synonym for Stanford's ad
ministrative officers. This is like
(•filling President Johnson and his
cabinet "the United States."
The University is the student
body and the faculty. It is served
by Trustees, a President, various
officers and bureaucrats. While
some of these officers may occa
sionally disserve the university,
they should never be thought to
personify it.

lax open house regulations." Hav
ing never studied past or present
provisions on the subject, I have
no opinion. Furthermore, were I
in favor of more liberal rules, I
would certainly not advocate "lax

tions
I do believe that our culture
over - emphasizes sexual differ
ences in its child rearing practices
so that young people grow up
with misconceptions about the
psychological characteristics of
the opposite sex. Unfortunately,
it is difficult to counteract 18 or
20 years of mis-education in four
years of college, with or without
open houses, co-ed housing, or

Undergraduates of both sexes
may live off-campus, not just
people over twenty-one, but every

housing at Cal forced their admin

Several of the girls in Cal

If all Stanford students were
allowed to move off-campus at
the end of their freshman year,
assuming their parents' permis
