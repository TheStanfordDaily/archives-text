# Students To Fight For Fair Housing
## 
### 
| The placing of the proposed con
jstitutional initiative to repeal Cali
j fornia's Rumford Act, on the bal
lot has immediately generated
political reaction on the state's
college campuses.
A statewide organization, Cali
fornia Students For Fair Hous
ing, has been created to co-ordi
nate opposition to the initiative
on the part of college students.
A group of Stanford students has
announced its intention to form
a chapter of the state organiza-
1 1ion on this campus at the start
of spring quarter .
I The proposed initiative is spon
sored by the California Real Es
tate Association. Its passage
would place a clause in the Cali
fornia Constitution repealing all
present "fair housing" legislation
and preventing passage of simi
lar measures in the future.
Chapters of the California Stu
dents For Fair Housing are now
in operation at the University of
California at Berkeley, and at
Mills and Foothill Colleges. Addi
i lions at UCLA and San Francisco
j State are in the process of forma
tion.
Bob Pickus, chairman of the
Stanford group, states that it
j hopes to bring Assemblyman
i Byron Rumford. author of the
; Rumford Act, here for an all-cam
i pus address in late April. In addi
tion,plans are being readied to
sponsor debate on the initiative
| measure ,and to aid local civil
I rights groups with voter educa
j tion and registration drives in the
! Stanford area.
The chapter will conduct a drive
| for members at the opening of
j spring quarter.
