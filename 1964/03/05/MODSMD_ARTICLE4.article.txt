## 
### 
Dr. Wilmoore Kendall said in
his book, Tlit* Conservative Af
firmation, "We must reopen the
basic issues between American
Conservatism and American Lib
eralism." The conservative ex-
Stan lord professor succeeded in
doing exactly tlicit in his speech
and panel discussion yesterday.
Kendall began with a short out
line of the issues of policy over
whi c h contemporary conserv
atives and liberals disagree. He
then asserted that the "stands
men take on policy issues are de
rivative from more basic stands."
lie said his purpose was to get
at those deeper, "irreducible po
litical beliefs and attitudes that
cause men to differ."
KENDALL THEN outlined the
conservative and liberal positions
on three of the "basic issues."
The first "basic issue" was "the
nature and extent of our dedica
tion to the goal of equality of
opportunity." Liberal devotion to
this goal is unrealistic, Utopian
and dangerous. Socialism, Kendall
said, "is morally wrong and it
won't work."

Liberals, Kendall said, also feel
that the past is just something
to be improved upon. He charged
that liberals "have adjourned
consideration of prudence." He
added, "Our grandfathers ran a
better world than we seem to be
j running."
HIS THIRD BASIC issue was
| that of the open society. Supreme
! Court Justice Douglas has said,
we have "no orthodoxy which we
seek to prescribe to the public."
Kendall answered. "Is not the
right to adopt an orthodoxy and
: to hand it down as good a right
I as freedom of speech?"
Kendall's address was followed
by a debate with students lie tie
| Strelitz, Jamie Hunter, Anthony
: Pfiffner, and professors William
i McCord and Otis Pease.
