# Menlo Park Joins Foes Of SLAC Powerlines
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD International Editor 
The University is being attacked
I from still another quarter for its
refusal to pay the costs for an
I underground lino to the $114 mil
lion Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC).
Menlo Park Mayor William
Lawson told the Daily, "Stanford
; knew it would require this voltage
• (220,000-volts for the powerlines)
: and since the project is an indus-
I trial operation the University
i should bear the full burden of the
; costs for going underground."
THE MENU) PARK City Coun
cil met last night to consider a
plan that would have tubular steel
• poles adjacent to the proposed
I Junipero-Serra Freeway. The
Freeway will cut through Menlo
Park near Sharon Heights Coun
try Club, which is across Sand
I Hill Road from the linear accelcra-
I tor.
The poles were proposed last
[Thursday by Pacific Gas & Elec
tric Co. as an alternative to tow-
J ers for the 5.4-mile overhead
route down the Woodside moun
i tainside from Skyline Boulevard
jto the accelerator. The burghers
I of Menlo Park, however, find the
I tubular-pole proposal as offen
sive to their aesthetic tastes as
j their Woodside counterparts find
; 1 he overhead towers.
"If I were to start a foundry or
i some other project," Lawson con
tinued, "1 would consider it in its
j entirety and would make provi
sion for all contingencies. Stan
ford did not do this and now they
are trying to hide behind the skirt
j of education while developing in
idustrial land."
LVLE NELSON, director of uni
versity relations, would only say
"No comment" when asked about
the Menlo Park proposal.
Councilman Ira Bonde, also of
Menlo Park, pointed out that "We
objected to the proposed lines
years ago but nobody paid any at
i tent ion to us at that time. We be
, licve Stanford should pay because

| they will be the main benefactor
of this project."
Bonde added, "Stanford said
that the site was the proper use
of academic land — they should
be responsible for it then.
While refusing to ratify the tubu
lar pole plan, the Council also
agreed to give Woodside "moral
| support" in its efforts to bury
the lines. Woodside has already
decided to quadruple its tax rate
to pay its $150,000 of the cost.
HOWEVER, University trustees
| voted February 20 not to donate

the $500,000 to help pay for I lie
j underground lino; thoy suggested
that the money come from Atomic
Energy Commission funds.
Next Monday is the deadline
set by the AEC for approval of
the electrical line by local juris
dictions. If the wrangling fac
tions have not agreed by that
time on some way to put the lines
underground and can pay for
this move then the federal gov
ernment will proceed to condemn
the land needed and build the line
anyway.
