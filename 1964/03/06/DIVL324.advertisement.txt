feel pressured at times with the
demands made on you for original
thinking, â€” for fresh ideas that
will lift your work above the
commonplace. Through the study
of this book, Science and Health
with Key to the Scriptures by
Mary Baker Eddy, we are learn
ing how to turn to God for the
intelligent ideas we need. You
can do this, too.
We invite you to come to our
meetings and to hear how we
are working out our problems
through applying the truths of
Christian Science.
