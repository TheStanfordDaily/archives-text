THE NEW HUE IN EAGLE BUTTON-DOWNS:
FORESEEABLE FUCHSIA
lOOKS pink*doesn't it? ★We chose the name for this color from among the entries in our recent
j competition for new color-names because of its aptness: we predict great things. Remember you
heard it here first. ★ What makes our solid pink new is that it isn't solid pink: the vertical yarn
(or warp) is somewhere between a Robert Shaw Coral and a Lawsy Miss Scarlet; whereas the
horizontal yarn (or woof) is a sort of 'Enry 'Iggins Just You White. ★ Thus creating an illusion,
but of the finest oxford cloth all the same; with button cuffs and our dear, old bulgy collar, about
57.00. If you don't know where to buy this and other Eagle Shirts in your town, please write Miss
Afflerbach who does; at the address below.
Use your imagination; this paper doesn't print in pink. © 1964, eagle shirtmakers, quakertown,Pennsylvania
