FAITH: THE VITAL INGREDIENT
Glib words do not ;i Christian make, nor will knowledge ol intricate
Christian theology, in itself, bring one into close fellowship with Cod.
It is through faith and faith alone in the Saviour Jesus Christ that we
become genuine horn-again believers.
"And 1, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of
speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony ol Cod. For I
determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and
him crucified. And I was with you in weakness, and in tear, and in much
trembling. And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing
words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration ol the Spirit and of power:
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power
of Cod." I Cor. 2:1-5.
How does one acquire this saving faith in Christ? The Bible (ells us
that it is the free gift of God.
"For by grace are ye saved through faith? and that not of yourselves;
it is the gift of Cod." F.pli. 2:8.
But where does one go to obtain this free gift? According to Scrip
ture, "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Bom.
10:17.
Thus, if one sincerely seeks the truth, the best place to begin is by
studying the Word of Cod, the Bible. Some may say, "I have read the
Bible from cover to cover and still do not know Christ cm a personal
basis." If this is your problem, you can be assured that "what Cod has
promised, he is able also to perform." For |<-siis said:
"Ask and it shall be given you: seek, and ye shall find: knock and
it shall be opened unto you. For ever) one that asketh receiveth; and he
that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh i! shall be opened." Luke
11:9-10.
The Bible must not be approached with the idea of merely confirming
preconceived notions, and justifying your own point of view; rather, it
must be read with a desire to see what it actually says, to understand on
Cod's terms wlr.it you are reading, and to submit yourself to the truth
when you find it. Faith is not just an attitude of mind nor an optimistic
outlook, it is taking Cod .it His word, and believing and acting upon His
specific promises given in His Holy Word, the Bible.
"... without laith it is impossible to please him: for ho that cometh
to Clod must believe that be is, and that he is a rewarder ol them that
diligently seek him. Ileb. 1 I :(t
