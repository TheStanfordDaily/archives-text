# Legislature Reverses Powerline Decision
## Lists Major Preferences 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
LASSU reversed itself on the
powerline issue last night, adopt
ing a motion virtually unanim
ously that it had tabled earlier
in the meeting.
Following a long debate in
which representatives of Save the
Skyline, AEC, and PG&E spoke
two amendments were proposed.
One, made by the LASSU Com
mit lee which investigated the
matter, recommended that the
federal government provide the
funds to put the 300 megawatt
powerlines to the Stanford Linear
Accelerator underground. It failed
in a close vote, 19-17.
The other resolution, proposed
by Bob Curry, a dissenting mem
ber of the committee, called for
acceptance of a proposed com
promise route running along the
Junipero-Serra Freeway with 70
foot poles, since it appeared that
federal funds would not be avail
able for construction of under
ground lines.
AFTER A BRIEF debate it was
tabled 17-15 which effectively
kills any LASSU action on it since
the Legislature will not meet
again until after a March 9 dead
line which the AEC set for any
solution to the problem.
The failure of the Legislature
brought a sharp criticism from
President Bud Wedin.
The Legislature then went
through a long procedure to bring
the resolution back and finally
passed it with only one objection.
The resolution read:
"THEREFORE THE Legisla
ture representing the Associated
Students of Stanford University
petition the Atomic Energy Com
mission as an agency of the fed
eral government, and the Board
of Trustees of Stanford Univer
sity to approve the proposed un
derground powerline route, if at
all feasible, and in lieu of 1 his
proposal, to take all necessary
steps to assure the construction
of a Halpren pole power supply
to the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor along the Junipero-Serra Free
way, a route which will prove
least objectionable of the avail
able alternatives."
In other business the Legisla
ture handled the open house
question in a remarkably docile
manner. The committee appointed
to investigate the matter reported
only that "a new open house pol
iey be considered," and then asked
the representatives to question
their constituents' open houses.
Wedin said ot the open house
policy, "The time seems oppor
tune for a re-examination and re
evaluation for the broadest as
pects of the University philos
ophy which has Jed to such pol
icies as regulations governing
open houses, overnights, women's
social hours and liquor.
"THE RECENT question raised
on open houses has focused spe
cial attention on just how accur
ately these regulations are at
tuned to today's Stanford stu
dent
LASSU's action on open houses
seemed especially weak when
compared to the strong resolu
tion that was passed last week
criticizing the administration's
new policy and calling for a com
mittee to investigate the problem.
LASSU also chose a new speak
er, Martin Gibson, the representa
tive from Theta Chi, to replace
Brad Efron who is going to work
for the University next quarter.
Gibson defeattd Burke Burright,
chairman of the by-laws commit
tee.
Other minor business consid
ered by the Legislature included
approval of a $100 dollar ap
propriation for the lIR participa
tion in the Model United Nations
in Spokane, Wash., and approval
of Publication Board By-laws
changes.

LASSU reversed itself on the
powerline issue last night, adopt
ing a motion virtually unanim
ously that it had tabled earlier
in the meeting.
Following a long debate in
which representatives of Save the
Skyline, AEC, and PG&E spoke
two amendments were proposed.
One, made by the LASSU Com
mit lee which investigated the
matter, recommended that the
federal government provide the
funds to put the 300 megawatt
powerlines to the Stanford Linear
Accelerator underground. It failed
in a close vote, 19-17.
The other resolution, proposed
by Bob Curry, a dissenting mem
ber of the committee, called for
acceptance of a proposed com
promise route running along the
Junipero-Serra Freeway with 70
foot poles, since it appeared that
federal funds would not be avail
able for construction of under
ground lines.
AFTER A BRIEF debate it was
tabled 17-15 which effectively
kills any LASSU action on it since
the Legislature will not meet
again until after a March 9 dead
line which the AEC set for any
solution to the problem.
The failure of the Legislature
brought a sharp criticism from
President Bud Wedin.
The Legislature then went
through a long procedure to bring
the resolution back and finally
passed it with only one objection.
The resolution read:
"THEREFORE THE Legisla
ture representing the Associated
Students of Stanford University
petition the Atomic Energy Com
mission as an agency of the fed
eral government, and the Board
of Trustees of Stanford Univer
sity to approve the proposed un
derground powerline route, if at
all feasible, and in lieu of 1 his
proposal, to take all necessary
steps to assure the construction
of a Halpren pole power supply
to the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor along the Junipero-Serra Free
way, a route which will prove
least objectionable of the avail
able alternatives."
In other business the Legisla
ture handled the open house
question in a remarkably docile
manner. The committee appointed
to investigate the matter reported
only that "a new open house pol
iey be considered," and then asked
the representatives to question
their constituents' open houses.
