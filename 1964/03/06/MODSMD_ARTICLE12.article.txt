Resulting from Wednesday's
story, "A Skilled Insurance
Salesman; A Warning to Stu
dents," two letters representing
an insurance company and an em
ployee of another insurance com
pany have been received by the
Daily.
Mr. Claus IT. Shelling of the
Mutual Life Insurance Company
of New York (MONY) comment
ed that "I read your Stanford
Daily . . . with great interest and
I can appreciate the problems that
certain insurance salesmen using
these high pressure selling tech
niques can create."

ITe added that "I am as inter
ested as you in weeding out the
type of unauthorized salesmen
you warn students about, for they
certainly don't make my job any
easier. Imagine the reaction ol'
Stanford student Smith, should
I approach him the day after
Jones." Mr. Shelling closed his
letter with "My only purpose in
writing to you is merely to re
mind students not to avoid all
life insurance agents, and that
direct selling, if performed ethic
ally, is an important part of the
free enterprise system."
Essentially in the same tone,
Beverly Moreau, a staff member
of one of Ihe largest insurance
organizations in the nations, com
mented in another letter to the
Daily, "Your article . . . with its
bold-printed 'Warning to students'
was most disturbing to me. But
what particularly disturbs me is
the damning effect your article
may have upon the sincere, con
scientious, trained member of the
insurance profession who is try
ing to do his job in a manner that
i will benefit the client and pro

vide a basic security for Hip fu
ture of both the client and his
family."
Miss Moreau added that a truly
professional, trained insurance
representative is trying lo serve
the interests of the clients, not
destroy thorn.
