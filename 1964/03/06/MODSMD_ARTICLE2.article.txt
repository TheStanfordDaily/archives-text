# Power For Accelerator Remains A Key Problem
## Thin Poles A Possibility 
### JIM BRISCOE 
The director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, Dr. W.
K. H. Panofsky, met with the
staff of the center yesterday in
Memorial Auditorium to discuss
his views and opinions regarding
the current povverline contro
versy.
In his speech Dr. Panofsky em
phasized the numerous com
promises which SLAC and the
AEC have made in the interests
of preserving the skyline. He
stated that "the change from tall
towers to the much smaller and
much less visable tubular poles
represents a substantial gain."
HE ALSO brought out the point
that if the AEC is forced to con
demn the needed land, the local
communities will lose all control
over the type of construction or
route of the powerlines and prob
ably towers will then be built as
they are the most economical to
construct.
Panofsky noted that the pro
posed tubular steel poles would
be only slightly higher than the
wooden poles currently being
used in Woodside. The use of
these poles would also not require
the clearance of trees and shrub
bery in the vicinity of the line.
"IT IS DIFFICULT for me to
see how a request for under
grounding as the only alternative
can still be supported if the ob
jective is truly the preservation
of the hillsides and the skyline in
our area," he said. 'We are mak
ing every effort to construct this
facility so that it will contribute
constructively both to the ad
vancement of knowledge and to
the local community."
He also emphasized that, be
cause powerlines of this size arc
almost never placed underground,
there has been very little research
or development in this field. "The
first move toward extensive un
dergrounding of very high-volt
age lines must be an intensive de
velopment program to evolve
more economical methods by the
judicious use of modern materials
and techniques; such a program
leading to substantial cost reduc
tion should bo feasible but will
take some time and requires fi
nancial support by the utilities
industry or the government."
