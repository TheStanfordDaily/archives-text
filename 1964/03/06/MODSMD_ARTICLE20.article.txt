# Joyce Drama Here Sunday
## 
### 
James Joyce's "The Coach with
the Six Insides," sturdy intellec
tual fare for the avant garde as
well as the theater lover, comes
to Memorial Auditorium Sunday
at 3 p.m.
Jean Erdman, noted American
choreographer, stars in her com
edy adaptation of "Finnegan's
Wake" with the original cast of
New York actors and musicians.
The production is a fusion of
dance, drama, mime, and music,
a dream-fantasy based on a Joy
cean euphemism for the coffin
in which we all leave this world,
projected from the mind of a
Dublin tavern keeper in "Finne
gan's Wake."
"THE COACH" won the New
York Post drama award for the
most outstanding off-Broadway
achievement of 1963. A five-play
er cast portrays figures in the
mind of a dreamer, with barriers
of space, time, and language ig
nored.â€”W.D.
