# Cage Season Ends Tonight
## 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
Stanford's basketball team tries
tonight to rescue a little satisfac
tion from a mediocre season when
il takes on the California Golden
Bears in the Pavilion.
The Tribe will be out to end the
weird series of five games be
tween the two schools in which
the home team has yet to win.
A crowd of about a thousand
Berkelyites will make the trek
down to the Farm to encourage
their team to take full advantage
of Stanford's home court disad
vantage.
THE GAME WILL bo a battle

for iho second place slot in the
Big Six. UCLA, the nation's top
ranked team, ran off and hid
from the rest of the league and
will represent it in the NCAA
Western Regional next week in
Corvallis, Ore.
Cal, currently tied with the
Cards for second position with an
8-tt record, lias lost: its last two
starts, to USC in Berkeley and to
UCLA in Los Angeles Monday
night.
The Indians, in the meantime,
were dropping a squeaker to
Washington, 69-67, in Seat lie and
pasting an inept Washington
State five here at the Pavilion.
THE HIGH POINT of Stan
ford's otherwise disappointing
campaign came on Monday night
when Tom Dose poured in 42
points before being taken out of
the game.
Dose had needed only 31 that
night to best Ron Tomsic's all
time Stanford varsity scoring
record, but the extra 11 were
enough for him to eclipse Tom
sic's old Pavilion mark of 40 also.
Stanford started the season on
a bright note, winning six in a

row before losing a squeaker to
Arizona State at Tempe on a last
second tlp-in by jumpin' Joe Cald
well.
THE TRIBE showing at Tempe,
against a team that went on to
win the Western AC title, was
particularly good considering that
Dose, injured in the previous
night's game against SMU in Dal
las. did not play.
The league season opened with
the Cards splitting a series
against Southern Cal in the Pav
ilion. Stanford won its next two,
but then hit the buzz-saw in Los
Angeles, dropping a pair to
UCLA. This finished the Indians
as far as any championship hopes
were concerned.
Now, Stanford would like to
salvage something from the
wreckage of its high hopes in
the form of a victory over arch
rival Cal. The Bears will be led
into action by guard Dan Lufkin
and center Cam Wall.
The gutty Cal team gave UCLA
its roughest night of the season,
losing by only two in the second
game at Berkeley and will not let
Stanford have an easy time.

The gutty Cal team gave UCLA
its roughest night of the season,
losing by only two in the second
game at Berkeley and will not let
Stanford have an easy time.
Stanford's basketball team tries
tonight to rescue a little satisfac
tion from a mediocre season when
il takes on the California Golden
Bears in the Pavilion.
The Tribe will be out to end the
weird series of five games be
tween the two schools in which
the home team has yet to win.
A crowd of about a thousand
Berkelyites will make the trek
down to the Farm to encourage
their team to take full advantage
of Stanford's home court disad
vantage.
THE GAME WILL bo a battle

for iho second place slot in the
Big Six. UCLA, the nation's top
ranked team, ran off and hid
from the rest of the league and
will represent it in the NCAA
Western Regional next week in
Corvallis, Ore.
Cal, currently tied with the
Cards for second position with an
8-tt record, lias lost: its last two
starts, to USC in Berkeley and to
UCLA in Los Angeles Monday
night.
The Indians, in the meantime,
were dropping a squeaker to
Washington, 69-67, in Seat lie and
pasting an inept Washington
State five here at the Pavilion.
THE HIGH POINT of Stan
ford's otherwise disappointing
campaign came on Monday night
when Tom Dose poured in 42
points before being taken out of
the game.
Dose had needed only 31 that
night to best Ron Tomsic's all
time Stanford varsity scoring
record, but the extra 11 were
enough for him to eclipse Tom
sic's old Pavilion mark of 40 also.
Stanford started the season on
a bright note, winning six in a

row before losing a squeaker to
Arizona State at Tempe on a last
second tlp-in by jumpin' Joe Cald
well.
THE TRIBE showing at Tempe,
against a team that went on to
win the Western AC title, was
particularly good considering that
Dose, injured in the previous
night's game against SMU in Dal
las. did not play.
The league season opened with
the Cards splitting a series
against Southern Cal in the Pav
ilion. Stanford won its next two,
but then hit the buzz-saw in Los
Angeles, dropping a pair to
UCLA. This finished the Indians
as far as any championship hopes
were concerned.
Now, Stanford would like to
salvage something from the
wreckage of its high hopes in
the form of a victory over arch
rival Cal. The Bears will be led
into action by guard Dan Lufkin
and center Cam Wall.
