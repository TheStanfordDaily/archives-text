# Ruggers Go After Seventh Straight Over Cal To Keep Big Serum Axe
## 
### PETER OAKLAND 
| The second round of the battle
for the heads (10,708 of them to
I bo exact) that comprise the Big
Scrum Axe takes place at 1:30
! p.m. Saturday at Berkeley he
| tween the closely matched squads
j of Stanford and Cal. Stanford has
I won the last six meetings of the
: two teams, and this weekend, like
I gamblers, will he rolling for
seven.
Neither team will he at max
imum strength. Estimates of
Cal's injuries have not yet filtered
down through the spy network,
but the four who were laid low
last Saturday certainly won't be
as aggressive this week.
STANFORD LOSSES, and big
ones they are, will be in middle
of the forward line. Props Randy
Vahan and Tom Fortmann are
definitely out. Vahan suffered a
hemorrhage when he blocked a
kick with his dead in the late
stages of Saturday's tilt. Fort
mann has a case of mononucleosis
that has him bed-ridden. Bob
Rath and John Carlson will start
in their places.
The knee injury suffered by
hooker Ron Fraboni that caused
much worry in the Stanford camp
has been diagnosed as only a had
bruise, and Kmetovic indicates he
! will be at full strength. If Fra
boni's knee doesn't hold up, the
situation is bleak indeed. Injured
prop Fortmann was also second
hooker. Phil Moreland might see
action at the hooker position.
Frank Patitucci, a seasoned
breakaway, has incurred a shoul
der injury that will limit his ef
fectiveness and might even pre
vent him from seeing action. If

such is the case, Tim Hansel will
take his place.
COACH KMKTOVIC thinks the
game will be decided in the loose
rucks. Cal plays its rugby games
in the football stadium, which is
fine for football games but a bit
inadequate for rugby, a game
which requires a field width of
75 yards. Kmetovic figures the
field will be probably 10 to 15
yards less than this figure.
The narrow field makes set
plays from lineouts and scrums
rather ineffective and forces a

I team to rely more on touch kick
| ing and pop-kicks. Because each
team will control the other's
: rushes, Hie ball will he on the
(ground more and the hustle of
| the ruckers 11 he decisive*.
All this week, Kmetovic has had
I his charges working out on a
j narrow field and practicing their
I kicking.
Cal must defeat the Indians by
more than four points to gain
possession of the Big Scrum Axe
which Stanford has held since its
inception three years ago.

All this week, Kmetovic has had

Cal must defeat the Indians by
more than four points to gain
possession of the Big Scrum Axe
which Stanford has held since its
inception three years ago.

Neither team will he at max
imum strength. Estimates of
Cal's injuries have not yet filtered
down through the spy network,
but the four who were laid low
last Saturday certainly won't be
as aggressive this week.
STANFORD LOSSES, and big
ones they are, will be in middle
of the forward line. Props Randy
Vahan and Tom Fortmann are
definitely out. Vahan suffered a
hemorrhage when he blocked a
kick with his dead in the late
stages of Saturday's tilt. Fort
mann has a case of mononucleosis
that has him bed-ridden. Bob
Rath and John Carlson will start
in their places.
The knee injury suffered by
hooker Ron Fraboni that caused
much worry in the Stanford camp
has been diagnosed as only a had
bruise, and Kmetovic indicates he
! will be at full strength. If Fra
boni's knee doesn't hold up, the
situation is bleak indeed. Injured
prop Fortmann was also second
hooker. Phil Moreland might see
action at the hooker position.
Frank Patitucci, a seasoned
breakaway, has incurred a shoul
der injury that will limit his ef
fectiveness and might even pre
vent him from seeing action. If

such is the case, Tim Hansel will
take his place.
COACH KMKTOVIC thinks the
game will be decided in the loose
rucks. Cal plays its rugby games
in the football stadium, which is
fine for football games but a bit
inadequate for rugby, a game
which requires a field width of
75 yards. Kmetovic figures the
field will be probably 10 to 15
yards less than this figure.
The narrow field makes set
plays from lineouts and scrums
rather ineffective and forces a

I team to rely more on touch kick
| ing and pop-kicks. Because each
