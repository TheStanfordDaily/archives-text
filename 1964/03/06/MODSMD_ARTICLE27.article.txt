# Tennis Team's Record Clean After SJS Win
## 
### 
The Stanford tennis team,
which has the best chance in a
long time of extending either
UCLA or USC, by virtue of a con
vincing 6-2 victory over San Jose
Stale is now 2-0 overall plus a
Northern California Intercolleg
iate victory.
The match, played Wednesday
afternoon here, promised to he
tight, but Stanford's swatters
came through with the crucial
points and swept the singles
matches, losing only two sets in
the process.
FLAYING IN the number one
position, Jim Beste displayed the
form that gave him the recent
singles championship in th e
Northern California Intercolligate
tourney and bested San Jose's
Rick Anderson in throe sets, 6-3,
8-10, 6-2.
Number two man Ron Preiss
man found himself behind after
the first set went to Bob Murio
hut came back in fine fashion to
take the next two sets by scores
of 6-3 and 6-4.
With the close matches in the
top two positions going to Stan
ford. the Indians were in good
shape as the depth started to
show its worth.
STANFORD'S four remaining
singles competitors handed (both
back- and fore-) their San Jose
opponents defeats. John Isaacs
def. Rich Drake 12-10, 6-1; John
Burt def. Larry Draper 6-3, 6-4;
Tom Maxeiner def. Bob Adams
-4, 6-4; and Dick Wilson def. Rus
sel Wright 6-3, 6-2.
The doubles matches had no
bearing on the outcome of the
match, and Stanford at this point
partially lost its domination of

I the visitors. The first doubles
team of Beste and Hodgeman
played an exciting match with
| Anderson and Murio, but before
its completion darkness halted
the proceeding. Stanford had won
! the first set 9-7 and was even
16-0 in the second.
