# Matmen Close At Berkeley
## 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
This Saturday is a big day for
a Stanford wrestling team
plagued by vicissitudes of fori une
throughout the season.
The AAVVU meet to be hold at
Berkeley tomorrow will he the
last chance the grapplers will
have this year to gain glory for
themselves and for their team.
Coach Leland feels that several of
his players have excellent chances
in the tourney.
ALWAYS SPOKEN of first
when victories are considered is
co-captain, undefeated 1.77 lb.
standout Phil Kendall, whom Le
land rates as "a really fine wres
tler." He adds that Kendall "has
worked hard and has continued to
develop. He's become a very cap
able wrestler, and can easily win
some important matches for us at
Berkeley."
Dick Anderson, as a sophomore,
rates as one of Stanford's bright
er hopes for Berkeley, an d
for future seasons. He placed
third in point production for the
team in the 123 pound class, and,
according to Leland. should bo
wilder his opponents as much as
a high-pressure campus insurance
salesman.
At 177 pounds, Tom Allen, sec
ond in team point production
after Kendall, is also expected to
make a good showing for Ihe
Tribe in Iho AAWU. Among his
opponents may he Gary Scrivens,
a highly routed UCLA wrestler
whom Allen lost a tight 2-1 nod
on February 15.
TWO OF THE burlier Cards
should also, on the basis of past
records, come through with solid
performances in the meet. Don
Buehler, undefeated in meet com
petition will be wrestling at the
191 level, and Duncan Ross at the
Unlimited division, who, from
results of their matches with each
other, appear of near equal abil
ity and can pick up some valu
able points at ihe Berkeley meet.
