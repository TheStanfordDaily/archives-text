### 
WASHINGTON (A Pi Son
ators Thomas H. Kuchel and
Clair Engle of California agreed
yesterday 1 hat the povverline to
serve 1 Stanford Linear Accel
erator be placed underground.
The Senators disagreed, however,
as to who should pay for the
added costs.
Kuchel said an additional gov
ernment expenditure of $1.5 mil
lion to $2.5 million to put the
line underground is justified "to
avoid having the federal govern
ment put in the position of de
secrating Ihe area involved."
Engle said Ihe Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. is obligated to deliver
power to its customers and added,
'"I see no reason why they should
decline to do this by underground
transmission."
KUCHEL ADDLI), "There
seems to be no doubt that the
aesthetic and other human and
property values involved indicate
that the lines should go under
ground.
"I do not believe that the cost,
though significant, should be an
ultimate deterrent. I certainly do
not believe that the mere fact
that a federal agency would be
involved in some sort of prece
dent in Ihe area should affect us.
Indeed, the federal government
should be proud to break the ice
in doing simply what good sense
indicates should be done here."
Engle said the residential at
tractiveness of the Woodside area
is worth consideration.
REGARDING COSTS, Engle
added, "For a customer the size
of the accelerator, I should think
the usual rate charged by PG&E
to industrial users would easily
return the initial construction
costs."
Recently the town of Menlo
Park entered into the SLAC con
troversy when the City Council
met 1o consider a plan to have
tubular steel poles adjacent to
the proposed Junipero-Serra Free
way.
The poles were proposed by
PG&E as an alternative to towers
for the 5.4-mile overhead route
down the Woodside mountainside
to the accelerator.
