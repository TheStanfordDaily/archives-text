## Student Committees' Voice 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
At the beginning ol October,
President Sterling announced his
decision to reduce the number of
students serving on Presidential
committees and to change th e
method of their selection. He also
replaced Professors Rhinelander,
Ruotolo and Stone with Profes
sors Loftis. Grommon and Wert
on the Student Affairs Commit
tee, presumably upon the recom
mendation of its chairman, Pro
lessor Eric Hutchinson.
On October 4, President Ster
ling asked students who wanted
to serve on Presidential commit
tees to express their interest to
either the ASSU President or the
Dean of Students. On October 23,
the a p p o in t m on t s were an
nounced: those named for the
Student Affairs Commit tee were
Mike Walsh, defeated candidate
for ASSU President. Tempe Rob
inson, who had not even expressed
any interest either to the ASSU
President or the Dean of S t tt
dents, and Nick Wesscll, the only
student from the six names
recommended by ASSU President
Wed in.
Whereas last year the Commit
tee represented many viewpoints,
this year it does not; its voting
on most isues has been sixteen
to one, with Mr. Wesseli's the only
dissenting vote. Whereas form
erly recommendations went from
the Committee to the administra
tion, this year the direction seems
to have been reversed. Whereas
formerly the Committee sought
to extend student freedom, this
year its policies have been restric
tive.
Nowhere is this reversal clearer
than in the recently announced
restrictions on voluntary organ
izations. In the spirit of the Trus
tees' liberalized policy on student
groups not using the name "Stan
ford." last year's Student Affairs
Committee voted overwhelmingly
to require from such organiza
tions only a list of officers and a
one sentence statement of p u r
pose.
It reasoned that by cutting un
necessary red tape, it wou 1 d
greatly expand the range of stu
dent activities. The Committee
specifically defeated a motion to
require constitutions. Solemn as
surances that more requirements
would not be added were given to
the Committee by its chairman.
Professor Hutchinson. But despite
this, new regulations have been
made, and they are even more
elaborate than those of two years
ago.
Last October, President Sterling
a n no u nc e d that students ap
pointed to his Student Advisory
Committee including all th e
previously mentioned offiers
would not be able to serve on any
other committees, whereas they
had been able to the previous
year. But he announced this only
after the appointments had been
made.
Since October the President's
Student Advisory Committee has
met only four times, and has had
to follow an agenda set by Presi
dent Sterling, which has included
a presentation of the PACE pro
gram by the Vice President for
Finance, a presentation of univer
sity finances by the Provost, and
a talk on Undergraduate educa
tion by Dean Wert virtually the
same as that he gave at Tresidder
Union the next day.
The format of these meetings
has been a fifty minute lecture
followed by five to ten minutes of
discussion. In other words, the
administration has shown no ap
parent interest in continuing the
sort of dialogue it began with stu
dents last year through their par
ticipation on university commit
tees. It is more interested in com
pliance than communication.
What has happened at Stanford
is of concern not merely to stu
dents. Several faculty members
have been reprimanded for giv
ing students, in the words of
President Sterling, "the kind of
encouragement that makes the
work of the Dean of Students
office more difficult."
Perhaps the administration
feels thai this generation of stu
dents is less mature than previ
ous ones. Perhaps they feel that
there is no need to find out what
students think. Perhaps they hope
that the next year wil bring
them more compliant student
leadership. Perhaps, as usual,
they are merely hoping to delay
matters until summer vacation.
