# THE
						ALUMNI-UNIVERSITY RELATIONSHIP
## Dartmouth Plan: A Model For Stanford? 
### 
Why not a college for alumni?
This novel idea, which Dartmouth College
will implement this summer, marks a fresh
approach to alumni-University relations — an
attempt to stimulate active participation by
alumni in a "sustained, serious intellectual re
lationship' with the alma mater.
The key phrase here is "active participa
tion." At Stanford, the Alumni Association is
working under the assumption that its raison
d'etre is to serve as a "mediarv communica
tion agent," to use Alumni Director Robert
Pierce's phrase.
TO THIS END, the Association has estab
lished a massive array of communicative pro
grams that keep its 25,000 voluntary mem
bers — the ratio of members to those eligible
is the highest in the nation — well informed
as to the goals and problems of the Univer
sity.
Like an octopus, the Association has its
tentacles in almost even possible type ol com
munication media. There are SI alumni clulis,
14 of them abroad, with an average number

ship of 233. There is an alumni magazine and
an alumni newspaper. There is a conference
program which takes faculty members, ad
ministrators and students to 25 cities across
the country to address approximately 5,000
alumni yearly — a program which the Dart
mouth Alumni Director enviously termed "the
best-of-all road shows in the college world.
There is a massive student contact pro
gram that not only opens up Bowman Alumni
house for 700 meetings a year, but has initi
ated such wide-ranging projects as the Stan
ford-in-Washington program and the Mendi
cants.
OF COURSE, there are the inevitable
class reunions—which are also academically
oriented.
And there is even a summer camp in the

Sierras which provides over 1,800 alumni and
their families with a secluded and exclusive
vacation spot.
And the "octopus" has been amply re
warded for its efforts toward communication.
In the last three years, the conference pro
gram, the student contact program, and the
club program have won Honor Citations from
the American Alumni Council. These awards,
three of the nine given among the 1,800 mem
ber colleges in this time, clearly show that the
Alumni Association is, in Professor Sanford
Dornbush's words, "a first-rate organization."
But is communication enough?
IN ITSELF, NO. As a recipient ol "com
munication," — be it lecture, magazine or
film — the alumnus is only a passive partici
pant in the constant intellectual vortex that is

his alma mater.
The one-day conferences are fine—as iar
as they go. But, according to Stuart Mors
head, '50, chairman of the conference pro
gram, "an alumni college would give the edu
cation-in-depth that the conferences cannot
provide.
This alumni college, patterned on the Dart
mouth Plan, would change passive participa
tion to active participation.
"OUR PROGRAMS BEGIN as a response
to a demand," Pierce has said. The demand,
as well as the means, for an alumni college is
present.
Such divergent sources as Prol essors Dorn
bush and Ralph Smith, IT. Melvin Swift Jr.,
president of the Stanford Alumni Association,
Oliver Norville, 52, conference chairman lor
Portland, Oregon, and Morshead have ap
proved of the idea.
Before dismissing the Dartmouth Plan with
a "wait-and-see attitude, the \lumni Associa
tion would do well to investigate further this
opportunity to add a new dimension to its
i irst-rate program.
