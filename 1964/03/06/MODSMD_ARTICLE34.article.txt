# Conference In L.A.— Quantity Not Quality
## 
### 
A Stanford alumni conference resembles a
thre-ring circus.
There are several things going on at once;
indeed, there is really too much going on at
once.
While attending the regional conference in
Los Angeles recently, this reporter managed
to hear snatches from 10 lectures and seminars,
two major speeches, and one tape recording
all in six hours.
IN THE MORNING, the alumnus (one of the
(574 who had paid his $6 registration fee for
the all day conference held at the posh Ambas
sador Hotel) could hear Douglas Walker explain
the Admissions policy, John Ralston defend the
athletic program, or Tom Cotton define under
graduate life. Each was given an hour and an
audience of approximately 100 persons need
less to say the athletic program drew a bigger
crowd, while the barroom also attracted a de
voted clientele.
In this short time, a topic like Admissions
might be adequately covered, but undergradu
ate life? Cotton, currently the president of the
Institute of International Relations, admitted
that he task, which he shared with Carol God
trey, '62, an assistant director of the Alumni
Association, was rather demanding. "Many
problems can't be covered in depth, so we have
to ignore the controversial issues."
What results is a superficial description of
student life on the Farm though not nearly as
superficial a portrait as Miss Hobbs of Exami
ner-fame made. Everything from the Hong
Kong program to Captain Midnight was
mentioned, then buried under the next topic.
Many alumni were appreciative of Ihe changes
and curious to know what it was all about, but
there wasn't much time to deal with each sub
ject extensively.
THE OTHER LECTURES were more satis
fying, mainly because they were much more
manageable. Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice-presi
dent for finance, defended University policy and
dodged the inevitable question about what was
the policy on communist profs; this from one
of those proverbial little old ladles not in
tennis shoes of the Class of '96.
Professor Lorenz Eitner, chairman of the De
partment of Art and Architecture, discussed
"The 'Ait Boom' and the American University,"
to a crowd of 75. Professor David Faville of the
Graduate School of Business gave a conserva
tive appraisal of ihe state of American business
to a packed house of 200. Other professors
spoke on varied subjects.
Probably the most unusual and definitely
the most telling description of life at Stanford
today was not delivered by a man, but by three
men in a tape recorded rendition of the Class
Day exercises last June. Professor Lewis Spitz,
history. Robert McAfee Brown, religion, and
James T. Wat kins IV, political science, spoke
via tape on the tension between open-minded
ncss and committment that troubles the mod
ern student.
Other activities included a speech by Vice-
Provost Robert J. Wert, the presentation of the
Herbert Hoover Medal for Distinguished Serv
ice to President J. E. Walace Sterling who, being
ill was not there to accept his $1,000 gold medal
in person.
AFTER IT WAS OVER, 671 relatively afflu
ent people walked out of a very affluent hotel
a little more aware of what their alma mater
was all about.
This fact is most important. One may wince
at the woeful lack of depth in the one-hour pre
sentations, but when a program is committed
to "taking a part of the campus to the alumni
themselves," an elongated conference becomes
untenable. To some extent, this program does
bring Stanford to the alumni—if in no other
way. then by the very presence of faculty mem
bers and a few students.
And the alumni pay their $6 to hear these
speeches and eat the perennial chicken lunch.
Their participation in the "road show" may he
passive, but it is often intensive.
Thus, one old grad ('27) who started talk
ing during Wert's address was roundly hushed
by his companions not out of civility but be
cause "we want to listen to the speech, dammit."
