# Dartmouth Alumni To Heft Brains, Not Bottles
## 
### 
This summer, Dartmouth Col
lege will inaugurate a program
that will either have a profound
influence on Alumni Associations
around the country or sink un
heralded into oblivion —an Alumni
College.
The first session of this 'col
lege' will last only 11 days, from
August 16-27, and there will be
only four profs and 150 students.
Tuition will he $275 a couple and
$17") stag, a price that ought to
awe even the most outraged tui
tion-payer at Stanford. And,
what's more, there will be a chil
dren's school for any future alum
ni in the crew, making Dart
mouth the first college to attempt
co-familial education.
The actual Schooling' will con
sist of r e a d in g assbrmn >nts
(seven of them), morning lec
tures, and small discussion
groups , plus r elated intellect
strengthening programs such as
concerts, plays, and art exhibits.
According to the "Dartmouth
Alumni Magazine," two funda
mental premises underlie this

innovation in alma mater-alumni
relations:
• "The College believes that
the complexities of our time make
imperative a continuing educa
tional effort on the part of each
alumnus so that he might under
stand and contribute to his so
ciety."
• "A group of adults have a
richness of experience and appre
ciation of values and the courage
of conviction which make such
discussion more meaningful than
a comparable discussion in stu
dent days."
The second of these statements
was provoked by a 1958 report to
the Association which stated:
'The success of summer confer
ences in liberal education for
executives of the AT&T and for
bankers, indicates that a simi
lar service might be rendered by
the College to its alumni."
The "service" to be "rendered"
in August will include four
courses: Science and Human
Values (required reading — "Re
ligion and the Modern Mind");

Literature ami Contemporary Af
fairs ("YValden," "The Book of
.Job,' "As You Like It,"and "Lord
ol the Flies"); The Scientific Affe:
Dream and Reality ("Profiles of
the Future," "Of .Men and Ma
chines"); and Current Economic
Problems ("The Affluent So
ciety").
Outside of 'classes' — there
will be lectures and panels on in
ternational relations, and optional
lectures on the Democratic Con
vention taking place that week,
communal living, cultural events,
and, of course, free time to "take
advantage of summer in II an
over."
All Ibis for $275. Is it worth it?
To the more affluent, and, hope
fully, the more intellectually am
bitious Dartmouth grad, it may
be. Expensive or not, the program
is already filled to capacity. Its
success — as a harbinger of a
trend to active rather than pas
sive participation in college affairs
by the alumni — will certainly
•provoke a similar program at
Stanford.
