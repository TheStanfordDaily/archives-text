# Alumni College On 'Farm'

(EDITOR'S NOTE: The follow
ing men, all well-acquainted with
the Alumni Association and, spe
cifically, the Conference Pro
gram — either as participants or
organizers, find the idea of an
alumni college appealing, though
they do not all agree on its plaus
ibility.)
RALPH SMITH, Associate Ex

Electrical Engineering:
"The Dartmouth Plan is a great
idea, and I think we can do some
thing similar.
"A two-week session here would
combine an academic program
with a recreational atmosphere.
. . . It would offer (the alumni)
renewed contact with the Univer
sity plus new outlooks. . . . We've
got the facilities, more than

enough faculty members at least
in the engineering department
and an athletic camp for the kids.

SANFORD DORNBUSII, Ex

been very successful, but this pro

OLIVER NORVILLE, '52. con
ference chairman for Portland,
Oregon:
"It's a marvelous idea. Actually,
I've always thought it would be
great just to take a leave of ab
sence from normal life and return
to the campus to refresh myself
in some of the intellectual experi
ences you really don't have too
often in day-to-day life.
"I think it might be a great
success. The problem is finding
the time to do it.and the money
on both counts, I might be de
terred by the fact that 1 have six
children."
H. MELVIN SWIFT, JR., presi
dent of the Stanford Alumni As
sociation. a Los Angeles attorney:
"One way to consider the appli
cability of the Dartmouth Plan to
Stanford, aside from whatever
success it might have at Dart
mouth. is to present the possibil
ity to two cross-sections of alum
ni, one which traditionally attends
the Conferences and one which
doesn't."

STUART MORSHEAD, '50. first
vice-president and chairman of the
conferences, a San Francisco in
dustrial engineer:
"This type of program would
be an excellent way to serve both
the alumni and Stanford. It would

bring an education in depth that
the conferences cannot provide.
I'm definitely in favor of it."
ROBERT PIERCE, 19. Alumni
Director:
"Our programs begin as a re
sponse to a demand.
"We've got more than 5,000
alumni on our lists all of those
who have ever attended a Stan
ford conference. We can contact
them to find out if there is a de
mand for such a program and if
anyone will expend the time and
money.
"One favorable factor as fat
as this session is concerned would
be the Shakespearean festival this
summer. . . . This would serve
as both a magnet for a crowd and
an excellent topic for one of the
classes."
