Unlike many of their contempo
raries, the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation is directly concerned with
undergraduates and undergradu
ate life. Indeed, their student rela
tions program won an Honor
Citation from the American Alum
ni Association in 1963.
Association President H. Mel
vin Swift Jr., said that this pro
gram was initiated for one rea
son: "It is a much easier job to
involve people in the work of the
Association while they are at the
University than when they are
long gone."
Just how does a student get "in
volved" with the Association?
Two special programs show the
width of the Association's in
volvement: the summer legisla
tive internship program in Wash
ington.(25 Stanford students will
go to Washington this summer
thanks to this program); the for
mation of an informal singing
group the Mendicants.
This program has benefited
both sides. The students through
inere a s e d opportunities for
achievement and rewards, the
alumni through increased mem
bership 50 percent of the last
several senior classes have joined
the Association within three
months of graduation.
