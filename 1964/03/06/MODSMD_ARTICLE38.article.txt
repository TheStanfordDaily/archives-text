# Three Other 'R's' Taught To 1800 At Summer Camp
## 
### 
This summer, while some 150
Dartmouth alumni are preparing
for their 11-day study session
back at the alma mater, some
1.800 Stanford graduates and their
families will devote a week to
three other "R's" rest, rambling,
and rusticity.
In the belief that nothing could
be more appropriate than an In
dian in the woods, these alumni
will troop off to a week at Fallen
Leaf Lake, the $250,000 watering
place operated by the Stanford
Camp Association, a non-profit
organization of interested alumni
and friends.
Approximately ISO people at
tend the secluded camp each week
of the summer, according to Julie
Hirsh, associate director of the
Alumni Association. The prices,
she added, are comparable, if not
cheaper, than the neighboring re
sorts.
As Professor Dornbush ha s
noted, there is really no place at
the camp to hold an alumni col
lege. as some have suggested in
light of the Dartmouth Plan. Pres
ently, there is a faculty member
in residence every week who de
livers two lectures plus informal
discussions.
