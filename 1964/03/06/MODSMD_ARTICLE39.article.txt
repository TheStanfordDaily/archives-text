# 'Road Show' Takes University To Alumni
## 
### 
"The best-of-all road shows in the college
world."
That's what J. Michael McGean, Alumni
Director at Dartmouth College, has called the
Stanford Alumni Conference Program.
And for good reason.
Each year, the "road show" plays to an audi
ence of 4,000-5,000 alumni in 1415 different
cities across the country—2s in each three year
period. A "cast" of faculty members, students,
and administrators presents a series of lectures
on contemporary academic thought, student
life and philosophy, and seminars on such deli
cate matters as Admissions and the Athletic pro
gram.
ADDED EXTRA ATTRACTIONS include the
appearance ol President Sterling or a trustee
and a report to the alumni body by the Associa
tion president — presently H. Melvin Swift Jr.,
'48, a Los Angeles attorney.
All of this is crammed into one six-hour
package finished off with the inevitable cock
tail hour.
A smash hit? Yes, say the alumni who come
again and again every year. For what reason?
"Because they are interested in Stanford spe
cifically, and higher education in general."
claims Swift. "About 25 percent of the Confer
ence attendees, excluding spouses of alumni,
are non-Stanford alumni who are interested in
improving their knowledge of Stanford as an
education institution they admire and respect."
The American Alumni Council apparently
agrees, for in 1961 this program was awarded
an Honor Citation as the "most outstanding in
the country."
In reality, the citation was a bit late in com
ing. The program was initiated in 1933 by the
Class of '30. Only thi-ee classes were invited
(1929-1931), and a "crowd" of 20-30 was ex
pected. Two hundred attended.
THE NEXT YEAR, conferences were held
both on the campus and in Los Angeles and the
program has been expanding ever since, the
most recent addition being Honolulu (1963*. The
size of the audience varies from city to city.
Aside from the campus program in the Spring,
witli its 1,000 participants, the Los Angeles con
ference with 675 <1963) and Bakersfield with
121 mark the extremes. An "average" confer
ence will have around 212 (Seattle) or 18(5 (Chi
cago).
Consideration is even being given to an in
ternational conference in Paris, for the Euro
pean alumni.
The domestic program, like all good non
profit businesses, is breaking even. The budget
is met by the alumni themselves. The registra
tion fees ($6 in Los Angeles, $5 in Seattle, and
various tags in between) cover Ihc entire cost.
The University pays the transportation expenses
of the faculty members, and the Alumni Asso
ciation underwrites the losses and acts as co
ordinator for each conference.
Aside from this support, each conference is
run exclusively by the local alumni. They make
the arrangements, rent the rooms, mail the in
vitations, and handle all the other jobs. One of
those "other jobs" is the Papoose Playground
a babysitting system that keeps the future
undergrads in tow during the day-long confer
ence.
"MOST PEOPLE, who do become involved
to any great degree have a great deal of pride
in their connection with Stanford," explains
Oliver Norville, '52. the chairman of the confer
ence held in Portland last Saturday. "They feel
that Stanford has benefited them personally and
that they have a responsibility to do something
for Stanford in turn. . . . What it comes down to
is the ability and desire to give time to some
thing you think is important." To this end. Nor
ville has given 50 hours this year to putting
on a single conference, without remuneration.
The participation is passive, but the alumni
certainly learn more about the University from
people who live, work, and study there than
they do from reading about it in the papers
as any Examiner reader can testify.
Thus, both sides gain, and the "road show"
continues.

The participation is passive, but the alumni
certainly learn more about the University from
people who live, work, and study there than
they do from reading about it in the papers
as any Examiner reader can testify.
Thus, both sides gain, and the "road show"
continues.
"The best-of-all road shows in the college
world."
That's what J. Michael McGean, Alumni
Director at Dartmouth College, has called the
Stanford Alumni Conference Program.
And for good reason.
Each year, the "road show" plays to an audi
ence of 4,000-5,000 alumni in 1415 different
cities across the country—2s in each three year
period. A "cast" of faculty members, students,
and administrators presents a series of lectures
on contemporary academic thought, student
life and philosophy, and seminars on such deli
cate matters as Admissions and the Athletic pro
gram.
ADDED EXTRA ATTRACTIONS include the
appearance ol President Sterling or a trustee
and a report to the alumni body by the Associa
tion president — presently H. Melvin Swift Jr.,
'48, a Los Angeles attorney.
All of this is crammed into one six-hour
package finished off with the inevitable cock
tail hour.
A smash hit? Yes, say the alumni who come
again and again every year. For what reason?
"Because they are interested in Stanford spe
cifically, and higher education in general."
claims Swift. "About 25 percent of the Confer
ence attendees, excluding spouses of alumni,
are non-Stanford alumni who are interested in
improving their knowledge of Stanford as an
education institution they admire and respect."
The American Alumni Council apparently
agrees, for in 1961 this program was awarded
an Honor Citation as the "most outstanding in
the country."
In reality, the citation was a bit late in com
ing. The program was initiated in 1933 by the
Class of '30. Only thi-ee classes were invited
(1929-1931), and a "crowd" of 20-30 was ex
pected. Two hundred attended.
THE NEXT YEAR, conferences were held
both on the campus and in Los Angeles and the
program has been expanding ever since, the
most recent addition being Honolulu (1963*. The
size of the audience varies from city to city.
Aside from the campus program in the Spring,
witli its 1,000 participants, the Los Angeles con
ference with 675 <1963) and Bakersfield with
121 mark the extremes. An "average" confer
ence will have around 212 (Seattle) or 18(5 (Chi
cago).
Consideration is even being given to an in
ternational conference in Paris, for the Euro
pean alumni.
The domestic program, like all good non
profit businesses, is breaking even. The budget
is met by the alumni themselves. The registra
tion fees ($6 in Los Angeles, $5 in Seattle, and
various tags in between) cover Ihc entire cost.
The University pays the transportation expenses
of the faculty members, and the Alumni Asso
ciation underwrites the losses and acts as co
ordinator for each conference.
Aside from this support, each conference is
run exclusively by the local alumni. They make
the arrangements, rent the rooms, mail the in
vitations, and handle all the other jobs. One of
those "other jobs" is the Papoose Playground
a babysitting system that keeps the future
undergrads in tow during the day-long confer
ence.
"MOST PEOPLE, who do become involved
to any great degree have a great deal of pride
in their connection with Stanford," explains
Oliver Norville, '52. the chairman of the confer
ence held in Portland last Saturday. "They feel
that Stanford has benefited them personally and
that they have a responsibility to do something
for Stanford in turn. . . . What it comes down to
is the ability and desire to give time to some
thing you think is important." To this end. Nor
ville has given 50 hours this year to putting
on a single conference, without remuneration.
The participation is passive, but the alumni
certainly learn more about the University from
people who live, work, and study there than
they do from reading about it in the papers
