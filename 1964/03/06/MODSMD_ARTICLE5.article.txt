bulletin board.
"Following March tt" said
the notice, "no full tune stu
dent is to lock his door at
any time. Violation of this
regulation will result in ex
pulsion from the Sunday
night flicks. Students are to
turn in their locks to the Keg
istrar's Office by Fri d a y
March 13. 1!K54, to avoid pay
ment of late fees. . . .
"... Students are to be
permitted, on a trial basis, to
retain their doors, but are
not to be permitted to close
them when one or more per
sons are in the room. If any
person of the opposite sex is
to visit the occupant of the
room, the door must be re
moved and checked with the
Resident Assistant."
