# COFO Needs Summer Help
## 
### 
The CiviJ Rights Secretariat
will hold a meeting Sunday at 5
p.m. in Tresidder for all students
interested in summer civil rights
projects in the South, in helping
to raise funds for the projects,
and in helping to fill an imme
diate need for office help in Jack
son, Mississippi's COFO (Council
of Federated Organizations) of
fice by working there spring
quarter.
COFO has informed the Secre
tariat of an immediate need for
at least three to four volunteers
with office skills at least some
typing, ability to write well, and
hopefully bookkeeping knowl
edge. Because of the limited staff
now working in Jackson and the
heavy amount of work necessary
to prepare for the massive sum
mer program, COFO has charac
terized this immediate aid as one
of the greatest helps Stanford
could offer.
WAYS IX WHICH students can
raise funds for the summer proj
ect will also be discussed at Sun
day's meeting. COFO can use stu
dents who will be in the Stanford
area over spring vacation and
who will be willing to contact
various local groups in order to
raise funds for the summer's
"Project Mississippi." Applica
tions for the project will be avail
able at the meeting.
