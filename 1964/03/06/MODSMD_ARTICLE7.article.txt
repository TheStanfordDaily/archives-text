# LITTLE CHANGE SINCE 1919
## Stanford Lags In Library Funds 
### BILL SMITH Associate Editor 
"We have no hobbies here. The specific
end result of the library system is to have
the essential book or material in the hands
of the one who wants it not simply to pass
his courses, but also 1o develop his mind."
This is the goal of the libraries at Stan
ford according l<» Elmer M. Grieder, Acting
Director of the Library.
"BUT," said Grieder, "we are increas
ingly feeling the pinch. Essentially there has
been little change in the Library since it was
built in 1919. We have made improvements
completed the sixth and seventh stack,
added space to the basement." he said.
"The Library was made to handle a stu
dent body one-third as large and a faculty
one-quarter as large, and so we are running
into difficulties with space," Grieder said.
"A university gels the kind of library il
reserves," Grieder said, "tin* kind of library
that fits best into its program. Because
Stanford developed unevenly, as most uni
versities do, and because Stanford has always
emphasized science, our science collections
are belter lhan our humanities collections."

"STANFORD started late 1891 so many
of the things collected at other places were
not available as of that date." Grieder said.
"Our inadequacies are historical in nature.
It goes back a long way. II goes back to
when the University saw itself with smaller
dimensions.
"Over a summer, the University can hire
several Nobel prize winners and strengthen
a department immeasurably,' Grieder said,
"but il bikes years to gather materials and
build a collection in any given field. This
is not work which can be clone in a day."
The actual problems with the library are
perhaps summed up best in the Report of
the Acting Director for the Year Ending
August 31. 1963.
GIiIEDCK writes: "While the financial
support of the University libraries continues
to increase year by year, the percentage of
the University's operating expenditures de
voted to Library purposes continues to de
cline. Between 1919-30 and 1961-62 the total
library percentage of the University's ex
penditures for administration and operation
declined from 6.06 percent to 3.93 percent.
"This later figure compares with Har
vard's 6.2 percent, Yale's 1.5 percent. Colum

bia's 1 percent, and the general tendency in
universities with very heavy research and
graduate commitments to cluster between 1
and."> percent. The decline is particularly
striking since Stanford's graduate component
. . . has increased most sharply.'
C.rieder continues: "Another disquieting
factor is the slow decline of that percentage
of (lie University's total library expenditures
thai goes to the University Libraries, which
serve the Schools of Humanities and Science.
Education, Earth Sciences and Enginering.
"BOOK FUNDS have been increased ma
terially . . . But the libraries at Stanford in
1961-62 spent only 27.3 percent of their money
on books, periodicals and binding, ranking
in this respect 53rd among 64 university li
braries; whereas they ranked seventh in size,
sixteenth in number of volumes added, eight
eenth in amount spent on books, periodicals
and binding, and twelfth in total expendi
tures. The indications are that book funds
should be very heavily increased."
Perhaps C.rieder summed up the feelings
of most people when he said. "You have tc
have the books to read as well as the teachers
to teach. You need the whole apparatus ol
education."

should be very heavily increased."
Perhaps C.rieder summed up the feelings
of most people when he said. "You have tc
have the books to read as well as the teachers
to teach. You need the whole apparatus ol
education."
"We have no hobbies here. The specific
end result of the library system is to have
the essential book or material in the hands
of the one who wants it not simply to pass
his courses, but also 1o develop his mind."
This is the goal of the libraries at Stan
ford according l<» Elmer M. Grieder, Acting
Director of the Library.
"BUT," said Grieder, "we are increas
ingly feeling the pinch. Essentially there has
been little change in the Library since it was
built in 1919. We have made improvements
completed the sixth and seventh stack,
added space to the basement." he said.
"The Library was made to handle a stu
dent body one-third as large and a faculty
one-quarter as large, and so we are running
into difficulties with space," Grieder said.
"A university gels the kind of library il
reserves," Grieder said, "tin* kind of library
that fits best into its program. Because
Stanford developed unevenly, as most uni
versities do, and because Stanford has always
emphasized science, our science collections
are belter lhan our humanities collections."

"STANFORD started late 1891 so many
of the things collected at other places were
not available as of that date." Grieder said.
"Our inadequacies are historical in nature.
It goes back a long way. II goes back to
when the University saw itself with smaller
dimensions.
"Over a summer, the University can hire
several Nobel prize winners and strengthen
a department immeasurably,' Grieder said,
"but il bikes years to gather materials and
build a collection in any given field. This
is not work which can be clone in a day."
The actual problems with the library are
perhaps summed up best in the Report of
the Acting Director for the Year Ending
August 31. 1963.
