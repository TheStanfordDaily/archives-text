# CHAPPIE'S PROMISE:
## Better Quality, New Cover Boy 
### ELLINGTON K. FARTHINGALE 
The Chaparral will make a surprising second appearand" of
the year next Monday and an even bigger surprise will he the im
proved quality of the product. Chappie still has its fair share ol
ridiculous material—it's "Toilet Poll, for example, is an innanc
compilation of all the toilets and urinals on campus with recom-

mendations on how to "look into'
the toilet problem" but il also
includes a number of genuinely
funny high-spots.
First among these is the cover j
ol' the magazine which pictures
in a Beatle haircut none other |
than the President of the Univer

sity. This will certainly give Dr.
Sterling a jolt, but probably not
an unpleasant one because th e
drawing is delightful and as un
offensive as the Beatles them
selves.
LESS TASTEFUL and more
Chappie-like, is a long story
titled, "Do You Always Spread
Dead Spiders on Your French
Toast." a parody of the allegedly
pornographic story which ap
peared in the last issue of Se
quoia, The story is occasionally
funny but generally outrageous
and. apparently to make up for it,
the Chappie Queen for this quar
ter happens to be Sharon Cobb,
who wrote the stquoiu story.
There are also three poems:
! "Glee," by Tom Leiser ("Glee,
glee, golly gee. let's all go jump in
j the Caspian Sea"> fieri K. Deske's
"The Rockiad of L. V. Priceless,"
a ballad of a rock and roll star,
and Stanford writing teacher
j Blair Fuller's "Big Bad Sur." a
I satire of Jack Kerouac's "Big
Sur." The extra four pages of the
; issue are filled out with cartoons,
I some of which are stolen from
j other college magazines.
Most surprising of all the ma
i terial in this Chappie issue is an
editorial titled, "Good-bye, Zeta
; Psi." a short, unfacetious, and
even literate lament on the ex
pulsion of the Zetes from the Stan
i ford campus. Though a bit over
done. it is a good job and il is
fitting that the Chappie (which
has been kicked off campus two
! times since 1950) should have
j done il. The whole issue, gencr
i ally, is a big Improvement.

I some of which are stolen from
j other college magazines.
Most surprising of all the ma
i terial in this Chappie issue is an
editorial titled, "Good-bye, Zeta
; Psi." a short, unfacetious, and
even literate lament on the ex
pulsion of the Zetes from the Stan
i ford campus. Though a bit over
done. it is a good job and il is
fitting that the Chappie (which
has been kicked off campus two
! times since 1950) should have
j done il. The whole issue, gencr
i ally, is a big Improvement.
The Chaparral will make a surprising second appearand" of
the year next Monday and an even bigger surprise will he the im
proved quality of the product. Chappie still has its fair share ol
ridiculous material—it's "Toilet Poll, for example, is an innanc
compilation of all the toilets and urinals on campus with recom-

mendations on how to "look into'
the toilet problem" but il also
includes a number of genuinely
funny high-spots.
First among these is the cover j
ol' the magazine which pictures
in a Beatle haircut none other |
than the President of the Univer

sity. This will certainly give Dr.
Sterling a jolt, but probably not
an unpleasant one because th e
drawing is delightful and as un
offensive as the Beatles them
selves.
LESS TASTEFUL and more
Chappie-like, is a long story
titled, "Do You Always Spread
Dead Spiders on Your French
Toast." a parody of the allegedly
pornographic story which ap
peared in the last issue of Se
quoia, The story is occasionally
funny but generally outrageous
and. apparently to make up for it,
the Chappie Queen for this quar
ter happens to be Sharon Cobb,
who wrote the stquoiu story.
There are also three poems:
! "Glee," by Tom Leiser ("Glee,
glee, golly gee. let's all go jump in
j the Caspian Sea"> fieri K. Deske's
"The Rockiad of L. V. Priceless,"
a ballad of a rock and roll star,
and Stanford writing teacher
j Blair Fuller's "Big Bad Sur." a
I satire of Jack Kerouac's "Big
Sur." The extra four pages of the
; issue are filled out with cartoons,
I some of which are stolen from
j other college magazines.
