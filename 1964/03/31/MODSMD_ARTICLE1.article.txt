• China lilasts Khrushchev
TOYKO — Rod China accuses Premier
Khrushchev of surrendering to "U.S. imperial
ism and declares: "Now is the time—now it
is high time —to repudiate and liquidate Khru
shchev's revisionism."
This latest Peking attack in the ideological
feud must have made interesting reading for
Khrushchev as he rode a train yesterday to
ward Budapest, Hungary, and a meeting with
Hungarian party leaders.
• ISeiv Cuban Terrorism
WASHINGTON — A new device known as
"death on wheels" is being used in Cuba to
bring terror and firing squad justice to those
who oppose the Fidel Castro Communist re
gime.
This was reported last night by an anti-
Castro group of U.S. citizens known as the

Citizens Committee for a Free Cuba.
The report said "death on wheels" is a mili
tary vehicle which transports a traveling court,
jury and executioners to the scene of uprisings.

• Alaskan Deaths Climb
ANCHORAGE, Alaska —The count of dead
and presumed dead in Alaska's great earth
quake jumped past the 100 mark yesterday as
reports trickled in from isolated coastal vil
lages.
In this biggest and hardest hit of Alaskan
communities, and in half a dozen devastated
smaller towns, leaders labored for a rebirth
of the state's shattered economy even as they
mourned the lost.
All the while new quakes continued. There
was a whopper Sunday night in the Bering Sea
650 miles west of the original massive shock
last Friday, one of history's worst. But no new
major damage was reported. There have been

-10 or 12 stiff aftershocks, coutless smaller ones.

WASHINGTON — New and grave compli

Mac Arthur but the doughty old warrior clung
to life and his doctors even reported some
slight improvement in his condition yesterday.
But the 84-year-old general remained in
critical condition. Physicians at the Army's
Walter Reed Hospital reported, in swift suc
cession, a loss of kidney function - the grav
est of the new threats — a resumption of
hemorrhaging in the esophagus and a possible
stomach ulcer.
All this piled atop the effects of three major
operations which the hero of two world wars

SACRAMENTO — Gov. Brown's tax relief
program for more than a million Californians
eased past its initial legislative test yesterday.
The Senate Revenue and Taxation Commit
tee sent the tax measure to the Finance Com
mittee. Sponsored by Sen. Virgil O'Sullivan,
D.-Williams, it eliminates taxes for 120,000 per
sons in low-income brackets and reduces them
for 990,000.
The state would lose $2.75 million annually
by allowing a flat standard deduction of $500
for single persons and $1,000 for married
couples or heads of households, eliminating the
present percentage option of figuring taxes.

The state would lose $2.75 million annually
