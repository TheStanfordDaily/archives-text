# Catholic Teacher To Visit
## Will Help Expand Religious Studies 
### 
The Rev. Daniel J. O'Hanlon,
S.J., "one of the outstanding ex
ponents of the ecumenical con
cern in current Roman Catholic
theology," will be a visiting pro
fessor at Stanford next year.
Father O'Hanlon, d e s c r i I) e d
above by Stanford professor oi
religion Robert MacAfee Brown,
will teach three courses during his
two-quarter stay at Stanford
His selection, announced by
President Wallace Sterling, puis
the university's curriculum on re
ligious studies on an interfaith
basis, and makes Stanford one oi
the few major non-sectarian
American universities to have a
Roman Catholic scholar teaching
courses in religion.
Father O'Hanlon's appointment
is a significant step in the religi
ous studies programs' "move to
represent contemporary faiths
from within," according to Dr.
Brown.
There is hope that a Jewish
scholar will be added to the stal l
in two years. Further expansion
would be into Oriental religions.
The appointment of the Catholic
educator and scholar fulfills
Brown's feeling that "I he clearest
way to understand a faith is from
a person within it." Dr. Brown
also fells that with the coming oi
a Jewish scholar "a more honest
picture of the American plural
istic scene can he rendered."
Father O'Hanlon, professor oi
fundamental theology at nearln
Alma College, will collaborate din -
ing the winter quarter with Dr.
Brown to teach a joint course
titled jThc Ecumenical Move
ment." which will examine the
forces on both sides which are
drawing together divided Chris
tiandom. A second course will bo
on contemporary Catholic
thought.
Born in England but brought
up in California, Father O'Hanlon
was educated at Loyola of Los
Angeles, holds a master's degree
from Gonzaga University, a li
centiate in theology from Milltown
Park Seminary, Dublin, and a
doctoral degree from the Gregor
ian of Rome.
He has traveled widely in Eu
rope anrl Ihe Near East, studied
at Fribourg University in Switzer
land and Tubingen University in
Germany, and has pursued addi
tional graduate work ai Syracuse
University and the Harvard Divin
ity School.
Father O'Hanlon is coeditor of
the recent book, "Christianity
Divided," in Dr. Brown's opinion
"the most significant single vol
ume . . . out of the recently de
veloping encounter between Cath
olics and Protestants . . ."
