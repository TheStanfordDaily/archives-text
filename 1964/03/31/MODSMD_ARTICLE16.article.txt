Stanford's attempt to upset
San Jose State in a dual track
meet Cor the (irst time since 1955
j was thwarted In the second run
i ning event of the afternoon Sat
urday in Stanford Stadium when
I the heralded duel between the
Tribe's Paul Schlicke and Spar
lan Ben Tucker in tho mile run
turned out to be no contest.
Tucker won the race in 4:05.2
with a fine kick in the last 220,
and San Jose won the meet by an
85-60 count to bring the Indian
victory string to a halt. In previ
ous meets Stanford had beaten
San Jose in the Stanford Relays,
117-103, and had whipped Fresno
State on the Bulldog track, 80-65.
TIIE MEET was really not fin
ally decided until the second-to
last event on the track, the two
mile run. Stanford needed a 1-2
j finish in this event and a victory
in the mile relay to come out on

I top.
Bui the two mile saw incred
ibly bad performances from two
usually dependable Redskin run
j ners, Weym Kirkland and Harry
McCalla. Kirkland was so 112 a r
! hack after six laps that he deemed
J it wiser to drop out of the race
than get beaten by half a lap.
McCalla, the team co-c-ipiain
i and holder of the Stanford team

mark in the event, finished a dis
tant fifth. Schlicke salvaged one
point for the Cards by getting
third behind Tucker 1 and T<>m
Tuite. All three broke nine min
utes.
ANOTHER STANFORD flop
was Bob Mill/ in the 880. The de
fending AAWU champ, running
on what he later said was a rup
tured achilles heel, turned in a

1:57.5 mark in coming in sixth
and last when he had been i
counted on to battle John Garri- 1
son of SJS down to ihe wire.
Bill Pratt, seemingly sensing'
the impending disaster in his
event, put on a strong finishing
kick to take second place with a
personal best time of 1:50.8, only I
.4 seconds behind Garrison.
Stanford's best event turned;
out to be the intermediate hur
dles, where a gutty performance
by co-captain Steve Cortright, who
couldn't lift his right leg high
enough to run the highs, turned
in a 38.2 as Indian Phil Arnaudo
took second in 38.5.
The Tribe also captured three
field events, the pole vault, jave
lin and discus. Chuck Smith, a
very promising sophomore who
has set his season's goal at 15'6",
cleared 14-9 for 1 the second succes
sive week to win the vault, George
Porter, a n o t h e r good-looking
soph, hurled the javelin 217' to
win. and veteran Bob Stoecker
flung the discus 162'4 1 -" to win
his event.

117-103, and had whipped Fresno
State on the Bulldog track, 80-65.
TIIE MEET was really not fin
ally decided until the second-to
last event on the track, the two
mile run. Stanford needed a 1-2
j finish in this event and a victory
in the mile relay to come out on

I top.
Bui the two mile saw incred
ibly bad performances from two
usually dependable Redskin run
j ners, Weym Kirkland and Harry
McCalla. Kirkland was so 112 a r
! hack after six laps that he deemed
J it wiser to drop out of the race
than get beaten by half a lap.
McCalla, the team co-c-ipiain
i and holder of the Stanford team

mark in the event, finished a dis
tant fifth. Schlicke salvaged one
point for the Cards by getting
third behind Tucker 1 and T<>m
Tuite. All three broke nine min
utes.
ANOTHER STANFORD flop
was Bob Mill/ in the 880. The de
fending AAWU champ, running
on what he later said was a rup
tured achilles heel, turned in a

1:57.5 mark in coming in sixth
and last when he had been i
counted on to battle John Garri- 1
son of SJS down to ihe wire.
Bill Pratt, seemingly sensing'
the impending disaster in his
event, put on a strong finishing
kick to take second place with a
personal best time of 1:50.8, only I
.4 seconds behind Garrison.
Stanford's best event turned;
out to be the intermediate hur
dles, where a gutty performance
by co-captain Steve Cortright, who
couldn't lift his right leg high
enough to run the highs, turned
in a 38.2 as Indian Phil Arnaudo
took second in 38.5.
The Tribe also captured three
field events, the pole vault, jave
lin and discus. Chuck Smith, a
very promising sophomore who
has set his season's goal at 15'6",
cleared 14-9 for 1 the second succes
sive week to win the vault, George
Porter, a n o t h e r good-looking
soph, hurled the javelin 217' to
win. and veteran Bob Stoecker
flung the discus 162'4 1 -" to win
his event.
Stanford's attempt to upset
San Jose State in a dual track
meet Cor the (irst time since 1955
j was thwarted In the second run
i ning event of the afternoon Sat
urday in Stanford Stadium when
I the heralded duel between the
Tribe's Paul Schlicke and Spar
lan Ben Tucker in tho mile run
turned out to be no contest.
Tucker won the race in 4:05.2
with a fine kick in the last 220,
and San Jose won the meet by an
85-60 count to bring the Indian
victory string to a halt. In previ
ous meets Stanford had beaten
San Jose in the Stanford Relays,
117-103, and had whipped Fresno
