# Ruggers Meet Notre Dame In Wake Of Tourney Win
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
Stanford's rugby team, w i I h
a 13-1 season record thus far,
closes a fine campaign today at
3:30 p.m. on the rugby field

against a touring Notre Dame'
squad.
Before vacation, Ihe Indians
played the Cal Bears in the second
phase of tho Big Scrum Axe duel.
Like the previous encounter at
| the Farm, the game was a well
; played, close affair. Coach Kme
i tovic thought his players played
better in the second game b u t
threats don't win ball grimes.
CAL GOT TWO easy "scores |
and a penalty kick while Gordon j
j Waddell, who booted l'ive penalty i
I kicks the week before, added two
more. The final score was 13-6 and
it gave the Scrum Axe to the
Bears by three points since Stan
ford won the first game by only
four points.
At the 16 team Monterey Tour
nament played the weekend after
finals, Stanford made it three
championships in four years by
winning four straight contests.
Missing from the Card roster
were Waddell, out with a twisted
knee, and other first stringers
Randy Vahan, Tom Fortmann,
Dick Shaw, and Brad Freeman.
Bob Burke, who handled the
kicking chores, was the team's
leading scorer at the tournament
with two tries and two conver
sions. Other players turning in
outstanding performances were
Ron Fraboni, Dick Leeuwcnburg,
Jon Brandin, Frank Patitucci, Bob
Price, and Dick Ragsdale.
IN THE first game, Stanford
knocked off the Universities Club
of L.A. easily 11-0, but then had
to come from behind to top Eagle
Rock, 12-6. In the semi-finals
against the Peninsula Ramblers, a
penalty kick by dependable Clark
Weaver in the closing minutes
changed a tie into a 6-3 Indian vic
tory. Kmetovic"s killers took the
title by taking a 5-3 decision from
Universities Club of Berkeley on
a muddy, rain soaked field.
Today's game should be viewed
if only because it marks the last
time Gordon Waddell will appear
in a Stanford rugby uniform.
Adept in all phases of the game j
and a respected performer in Cali
fornia and international rugby cir
cles. Waddell has backboned the
team during his graduate school
stay at Stanford by being the
leading scorer and director of the
attack.
Rugby is a spring sport in the 1
midwest and east so that Notre
Dame is just beginning its season. !
It competed in the Monterey tour- j
nament and compiled a record of !
one win, two ties, and an overtime !
loss. Stanford will have a definite
edge in experience, but the Irish
are a hustling team and the game
will certainly be exciting and
possibly close.
