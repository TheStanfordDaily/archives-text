Gaels in a non-league contest to

morrow on the Sunken Diamond
at 3 p.m.
Coach Dutch Fehring's Cards,
presently occupying the league
cellar, are still looking for their
first victory after five California
Intercollegiate Baseball Associa
tion games. Earlier in the month,
i league-leading Santa C 1 a r a
downed the Tribe twice, 15-2 and
I 9-3.
Stanford returns to the Farm
i after being pushed further down
| the CIRA ladder by UCLA a n d
' tICSB. The Bruins knocked out an
8-3 victory over the Indians Fri
day at West wood, and Saturday,
at Goleta, the Tribe dropped a
doubleheader to Santa Barbara,
8-3 and 4-o.
THK CARDS two victories'
I came with the bombing of some!
! older Cards, the Alumni, 15-1, and
a 3-1 decision over the Oregon
j Webfoots. Before their on-t he-road
i losses to UCLA and Santa Bar
j bara, the Indians lost two non

outfielder. Other lettermen avail
able are utility men Ken De Be
voise and Dave Stout.
COACH FEHRING has been
head coach since 1956. And t h i s j
year's team is the youngest one!
he has had on the Farm. Of the |
13 pitchers listed, nine are sopho
mores.
Mike Connelly, a sophomore
pitcher, has been coming along
well. Another sophomore, Pete
Middlekauff, has been playing a
lot of first base lately. Both lit
these players have no previous'
bassball experience at Stanford.
St. Mary's will give Stanford- a
j breather from the tough CIBA,
which includes USC, national
champs last year, and Santa Clara,
currently number one in the na
tion. If the Stanford nine can find
the victory trail tomorrow, per
haps il will lead into the CIBA.
