# Economist-Thinker Baran Dies
## 
### 
Last Thursday Paul A. Baran,
professor of economics, suffered
a heart attack and died in San
Francisco. The 53-year-old profes
sor's sudden death was termed a
"distinct loss to social thought in
lliis country" by Dr. Moses Abro
movitz, head of the Economics De
partment.
Baran was one of the few ex
perts on Marxist economic theory
on the faculty of a major univer
sity. Formerly senior economist
on the Federal Reserve Hank of
New York, he was a specialist on

economic policy
for the under
tjev eloped na
tions.
PROFESSOE
Baran was born
in R u s s i a in
1910 and studied
in Europe a n d
America, receiv
ing his Master's
degree from Har-

vard and his Doctorate from the
University of Berlin. Since com
ing to Stanford in 1949, he h a s
taught courses in economic his
tory and comparitive economics.
IN CITING Baran as a "fighter
for reason and justice," Dr. Abra
movitz said, "He was one of the
very few exponents of Marxism
who held an official place in
American academic life. As such
he helped to keep economic
thought in this country and other
western countries in contact with
an intellectual current which has
shaken the world."
ON APRIL 2 at 8 p.m. in Cub
berley Auditorium, there will bo
a panel discussion of the achieve
ments that Baran accomplished.
Professor Baran, who cham
pioned such liberal causes as the
Fair Play for Cuba Commitee, was
respected as a social critic and
leader of liberal thought.
