# Withholding Information Is A Form Of Censorship
## Editorial 
### 
The Senate Judiciary sub-committee re
cently endorsed a bill designed to provide full
disclosure of information by government
agencies unless that information is specifically
restricted by law.
VVe applaud the action by the sub-com
mittee.
It is perhaps a truism to say that in a
democracy the public must know what is
going on. It has become increasingly appar
ent that in this country numerous attempts
have been made to suppress information.

Under the guise of the anti-communist, anti
subversive movements of the late 40's and
early 50's, numerous security classifications
were promulgated.
The success of these security arrange
ments to safeguard American military secrets
can be questioned. But their secondary re
sult, the curtailing of information vital to
the public knowledge, lias been the cause of
considerable consternation.
THE FIRST AMENDMENT to the con
stitution guarantees that the government

shall not interfere with the freedom to as
semble and worship nor the freedom of
speech and press. Yet the effect of the secur
ity classifications over the past two decades
has been to curtail the freedom of the press.
The right to know, the access to informa
tion, is at least equally important as the
freedom from direct government censorship.
The withholding of information is a form of

censorship.
Wc do not mean to imply that all classi
fication of information should be ended.
Such a position is both stupid and untenable.
And the bill endorsed by the sub-committee
specifically exempts information required by
executive order to be kept secret for reasons
of national defense or foreign policy, and in
formation relating solely to internal person
nel rules and practices of any agency.
One of the most important features of
the bill is die provision for a court procedure

by which the press and citizens may petition
to obtain information deemed to be wrong
hilly withheld by an agency. This feature
removes the decision on the release of in
formation from the hands of an all too often
capricious and semi- autonomous agency di
rector. It provides a tool by which informa
tion may be pried loose from unwilling bu
reaucrats.
All in all the bill appears to be an excel
lent package which, we hope, will be acted
on quickly by the Senate.
