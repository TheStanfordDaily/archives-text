# Notes And Observations
## Stanford Faculty Contributes To 'Conservative Papers' 
### John Bonine 
Two years ago The Liberal
Papers was published under the
auspices of a group of Democra
tic Congressmen calling th e m
selves the "Liberal Project." The
book was attacked as "extremist"
and "appeasing."
Among other things, it advo
cated letting the Soviets "plug
in" to our DEW Line radar de
fense, recommended unilateral
dismantling of NATO defenses,
endorsed Bertrand Russell's "Bet
ter Red Than Dead" slogan, sug
gested turning Qucmoy and Mat
su over to Communist China, etc.
ad nauseam.

REPUBLICANS, taking up the
flung gauntlet, responded with a
project of their own. The Conser
vative Papers, written by four
teen scholars under the auspices
of a group of Republican C o n
gressmen, is a somewhat broader
selection of topics than its sister
book. The Introduction is written
by Representative Melvin Laird
(Wisconsin), who will be chair
man of the 1964 Republican Plat
form Committee.
Three of the authors are on
the Stanford faculty: Milorad M.
Drachkovitch and Roger A. Free
man of the Hoover Institution,
and Dr. Karl Brandt, head of the
Food Research Institute.
Drachkovitch, writing on "So

viet Satellites: Challenge to U.S.
Policy," urges a commitment of
the West to the Atlantic Charter
and the Yalta Declaration on
Liberated Europe which the
"colonialism" of Stalin and the
"neocolonialism" of Khrushchev
have flagrantly violated.
"Multiple means of unconven
tional warfare" is advocated, from
selective encouragement of truly
centrifugal forces in East-Central
Europe, to a propaganda offen
sive, particularly among the un
committed nations, emphasizing
the imperialism of the commu
nists in Eastern Europe, to sup
port of insurgent liberation move
ments.
★ ★ ★
THE OBJECT would be to "en
courage the captive nations in
their resistance to Communist
domination, and to enable them
ultimately to choose freely the
governmental system of t heir
liking," as well as to weaken the
Soviet hand in any conventional
military attack on the Free
World (and thus also to reduce
the likelihood of one).
Freeman's essay, "Economic-
Priorities: Needs vs. Expediency,"
examines tax policy, government
spending, wages and unemploy
ment, and the primacy of politics
in the realm of pi-esent govern
mental economic policy. He
claims that a lag in investment,
not consumption, has been mostly
responsible for our unemploy
ment and growth problems, and

he backs up his allegation not
only by statistics, but by quoting
from the President's Economic-
Report of January 1963!
Freeman calls for tax reform
by reducing the steeply graduated
corporate and personal taxes. In
his words, "Conservatives do not
believe that the poor can be ef
fectively helped by the expediency
of soaking the rich but rather by
untrammeling the expansive
forces and by freeing the natural
dynamism of our economy which
has been repressed for too long."
Brandt writes on "The Under
developed Nations," in which field
his expertise is unchallenged. His
suggestions for economic prog
ress emphasize private initiative
where possible, also attacking the
helter-skelter policy of breaking
up efficient large-scale agricul
tural operations in the name of
land reform. He finds one of the
main problems to be a lack of a
climate of confidence for for
eign investors, in light of recent
expropriations by the govern
ments.
Other authors include H en r y
Kissinger who is at Stanford this
week; Edward Teller, father of
the H-bomb; Milton Friedman,
noted economist; and C h a r 1 e s
Malik, former president of the
UN General Assembly.

THE CONSERVATIVE Papers
provide a wide sampling of
thought which will quite prob
ably be largely adopted as govern
mental policy should a Republi
can be elected to the White House
in November. For that reason
alone it commends itself to our
attention. Brandt and Freeman
have already served in the White I
House; November 1964 might
see the "Harvard clique" in
Washington replaced by advisers
from the "Harvard of the West."
At any rate, these papers i
should do much toward sparking
the inevitable' conservative-Lib- j
eral debate of 1964 "in the digni-1
fied and solid terms in which a :
confrontation should be couched."

REPUBLICANS, taking up the
flung gauntlet, responded with a
project of their own. The Conser
vative Papers, written by four
teen scholars under the auspices
of a group of Republican C o n
gressmen, is a somewhat broader
selection of topics than its sister
book. The Introduction is written
by Representative Melvin Laird
(Wisconsin), who will be chair
man of the 1964 Republican Plat
form Committee.
Three of the authors are on
the Stanford faculty: Milorad M.
Drachkovitch and Roger A. Free
man of the Hoover Institution,
and Dr. Karl Brandt, head of the
Food Research Institute.
Drachkovitch, writing on "So

viet Satellites: Challenge to U.S.
Policy," urges a commitment of
the West to the Atlantic Charter
and the Yalta Declaration on
Liberated Europe which the
"colonialism" of Stalin and the
"neocolonialism" of Khrushchev
have flagrantly violated.
"Multiple means of unconven
tional warfare" is advocated, from
selective encouragement of truly
centrifugal forces in East-Central
Europe, to a propaganda offen
sive, particularly among the un
committed nations, emphasizing
the imperialism of the commu
nists in Eastern Europe, to sup
port of insurgent liberation move
ments.

THE OBJECT would be to "en
courage the captive nations in
their resistance to Communist
domination, and to enable them
ultimately to choose freely the
governmental system of t heir
liking," as well as to weaken the
Soviet hand in any conventional
military attack on the Free
World (and thus also to reduce
the likelihood of one).
Freeman's essay, "Economic-
Priorities: Needs vs. Expediency,"
examines tax policy, government
spending, wages and unemploy
ment, and the primacy of politics
in the realm of pi-esent govern
mental economic policy. He
claims that a lag in investment,
not consumption, has been mostly
responsible for our unemploy
ment and growth problems, and

he backs up his allegation not
only by statistics, but by quoting
from the President's Economic-
Report of January 1963!
Freeman calls for tax reform
by reducing the steeply graduated
corporate and personal taxes. In
his words, "Conservatives do not
believe that the poor can be ef
fectively helped by the expediency
of soaking the rich but rather by
untrammeling the expansive
forces and by freeing the natural
dynamism of our economy which
has been repressed for too long."
Brandt writes on "The Under
developed Nations," in which field
his expertise is unchallenged. His
suggestions for economic prog
ress emphasize private initiative
where possible, also attacking the
helter-skelter policy of breaking
up efficient large-scale agricul
tural operations in the name of
land reform. He finds one of the
main problems to be a lack of a
climate of confidence for for
eign investors, in light of recent
expropriations by the govern
ments.
Other authors include H en r y
Kissinger who is at Stanford this
week; Edward Teller, father of
the H-bomb; Milton Friedman,
noted economist; and C h a r 1 e s
Malik, former president of the
UN General Assembly.

THE CONSERVATIVE Papers
provide a wide sampling of
thought which will quite prob
ably be largely adopted as govern
mental policy should a Republi
can be elected to the White House
in November. For that reason
alone it commends itself to our
attention. Brandt and Freeman
have already served in the White I
House; November 1964 might
see the "Harvard clique" in
Washington replaced by advisers
from the "Harvard of the West."
At any rate, these papers i
should do much toward sparking
the inevitable' conservative-Lib- j
eral debate of 1964 "in the digni-1
fied and solid terms in which a :
confrontation should be couched."

Two years ago The Liberal
Papers was published under the
auspices of a group of Democra
tic Congressmen calling th e m
selves the "Liberal Project." The
book was attacked as "extremist"
and "appeasing."
Among other things, it advo
cated letting the Soviets "plug

fense, recommended unilateral
dismantling of NATO defenses,
endorsed Bertrand Russell's "Bet

teen scholars under the auspices
of a group of Republican C o n
gressmen, is a somewhat broader
selection of topics than its sister
book. The Introduction is written
by Representative Melvin Laird
(Wisconsin), who will be chair
man of the 1964 Republican Plat
form Committee.
Three of the authors are on
the Stanford faculty: Milorad M.
Drachkovitch and Roger A. Free
man of the Hoover Institution,
and Dr. Karl Brandt, head of the
Food Research Institute.
Drachkovitch, writing on "So

viet Satellites: Challenge to U.S.
Policy," urges a commitment of
the West to the Atlantic Charter
and the Yalta Declaration on
Liberated Europe which the
"colonialism" of Stalin and the
"neocolonialism" of Khrushchev
have flagrantly violated.
"Multiple means of unconven
tional warfare" is advocated, from
selective encouragement of truly
centrifugal forces in East-Central
Europe, to a propaganda offen
sive, particularly among the un
committed nations, emphasizing
the imperialism of the commu
nists in Eastern Europe, to sup
port of insurgent liberation move
ments.

THE OBJECT would be to "en
courage the captive nations in
their resistance to Communist
domination, and to enable them
ultimately to choose freely the
governmental system of t heir
liking," as well as to weaken the
Soviet hand in any conventional
military attack on the Free
World (and thus also to reduce
the likelihood of one).
Freeman's essay, "Economic-
Priorities: Needs vs. Expediency,"
examines tax policy, government
spending, wages and unemploy
ment, and the primacy of politics
in the realm of pi-esent govern
mental economic policy. He
claims that a lag in investment,
not consumption, has been mostly
responsible for our unemploy
ment and growth problems, and

he backs up his allegation not
only by statistics, but by quoting
from the President's Economic-
Report of January 1963!
Freeman calls for tax reform
by reducing the steeply graduated
corporate and personal taxes. In
his words, "Conservatives do not
believe that the poor can be ef
fectively helped by the expediency
of soaking the rich but rather by
untrammeling the expansive
forces and by freeing the natural
dynamism of our economy which
has been repressed for too long."
Brandt writes on "The Under
developed Nations," in which field
his expertise is unchallenged. His
suggestions for economic prog
ress emphasize private initiative
where possible, also attacking the
helter-skelter policy of breaking
up efficient large-scale agricul
tural operations in the name of
land reform. He finds one of the
main problems to be a lack of a
climate of confidence for for
eign investors, in light of recent
expropriations by the govern
ments.
Other authors include H en r y
Kissinger who is at Stanford this
week; Edward Teller, father of
the H-bomb; Milton Friedman,
noted economist; and C h a r 1 e s
Malik, former president of the
UN General Assembly.

THE CONSERVATIVE Papers
provide a wide sampling of
thought which will quite prob
ably be largely adopted as govern
mental policy should a Republi
can be elected to the White House
in November. For that reason
alone it commends itself to our
attention. Brandt and Freeman
have already served in the White I
House; November 1964 might
see the "Harvard clique" in
Washington replaced by advisers
from the "Harvard of the West."
At any rate, these papers i
should do much toward sparking
the inevitable' conservative-Lib- j
eral debate of 1964 "in the digni-1
fied and solid terms in which a :
confrontation should be couched."
