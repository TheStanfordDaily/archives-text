## Stanfords Command Respect 
### 
Editor, Tin' Daily:
In Shakespeare's Henry the
Eighth, Wolsey is sudd en 1 y
brought low by powers beyond his
machinations, and says,"I feel my
heart new opened." i think some
thing like that must have hap
pened to Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford when their son died. To say,
"The Children of California shall
be my children," is perhaps pre- i
tentious, and to preserve Leland's i
last breakfast seems both morbid
and sentimental. But the deeper
fact is their confrontation with
death, and their desire to give to
many what they had planned for
him alone.
I cannot imagine how any par
ent survives the death of his
child, but I think the old robber
! baron and hi.s wife did about as
well as ttiey could. So on Foun
der's Day, not because I admire
their way of life, but because I
respect their humanity, I gladly
remember them and their son.

Editor, The Daily:
My enthusiastic compliments on
the Daily's contribution to Foun
der's Day observance, and partic
ularly to the outstanding young
.journalist who wrote the piece
"An Aphorism for the Holy Fam
ily" which appeared in the March
5 issue.
To expose the Stanfords as ar-1
rogant, egocentric morons is in j
the true tradition of modern jour-
S nalism and academic freedom. It
took courage, constructive enter
! prise and talent to dispel the illu
sion that there was anything hon
orable about founding an institu
tion that produces leaders 1i ke j■
