## Rush Superficial, Denies The Individual; Draw System A Possible Replacement 
### Dick Gillam 
| The period of "ultimate" rush is
upon us. Freshmen will be feted
at a variety of open houses, the
"desirables" will attend a multi
plicity of social functions, and, at
the end of this week, a good num
ber of these lower classmen will
receive an invitation to join a par
ticular living group. In approxi
mately four weeks these freshmen
will be able to officially accept
bids.
Each year a few protests against
; t ho existing system are voiced.
They are received rather indul
gently by those concerned, and are
then quietly, and unanimously
ignored. Certainly it is not the pro
test, but the response which is
surprising. It is quite difficult to
understand how a system which
is clearly superficial, and so inten
sively conducted could ever be
considered a viable method of de
termining group membership.

ONE OF THE oft-cited virtues
of rush is the resulting opportun
ity of rationally choosing one's fu
ture associates.
But the result of rush is a some
what discomforting and typical
situation. The freshman usually
accepts a bid without any true
understanding of the group he is
entering, while the fraternity or
club seldom realizes what type of
individual it is pledging.
In reality, there is very little
"rational" choice associated with
the system, and surface qualities
are greatly over-emphasized. Ac
cording to an administrative offi
cial, it is possible to accurately
predict which freshmen will re
ceive bids merely by examining
the freshman class pictures.
In fact, the most damaging in
dictment of rush lies with the
system's essential denial of the
individual. C on c opts such as
"character," "motivation," "depth
of feeling." "genuine interests,"
and the like are certainly too ab
stract to be considered within the
confines of rush contact.
Impressions are thus conceptu
alized and formalized in certain

"concrete" criteria (or trivialities
if you prefer) which can be
quickly determined by the mem
bers. An attractive personal ap
pearance and a gift for spontane
ous conversation appear to be two
of the most important well-cate
gorized qualities.
It seems scarcely necessary to
point out that the so-called "tur
key" may have attributes which
go far beyond the above-men
tioned banalities. Yet in denying
himself any exposure to the in
dividual who does not, or does not
find it necessary to live up to an
"image," it is the organization
member more than the "turkey"
who ultimately loses. Sameness is
often a legacy of rush.

IT IS TIME that an alternative
be considered. Contrary to wide
spread opinion, abolishment of
rush would not be an unusual
move. Williams has recently elimi
nated the system, colleges such
as Dartmouth discourage the prac
tice. and, indeed, this is the trend
throughout the Ivy League.
At Stanford, a possible solution
would be the adoption of a "draw"
system similar to that employed
by the Stanford women. The fresh
man himself would then designate
his choice of living groups in or
der of preference and would sub
sequently be assigned a choice
according to his draw number (the
lower numbers being allotted
higher preferences).
As tho women's selection now
stands between types of living
groups Lag. Florence Moore, the
Row. etc. so the men's choice
would be between these types
the Clubs, Stern, or the Row. An
expanded amount of contact be
tween freshmen and upper class-

I men would bo necessary, and
i could be accomplished through
j meal contacts (for instance, fresh
men might lie allowed to invite
i themselves to dinner at any group
-even if they know nobody in
Jtho particular organization) as
! well as some informal social con
tact at parties.
The result would bo a greater
emphasis upon the individual as
opposed to the group and upon
liis development within a some
what more heterogeneous and, in
some cases less fraternal organi
zation. The individual would con
trol his own actions (and provi
sionally might be allowed to
change groups under certain cir
cumstanced as the women may
now do), and the group would
benefit from a greater variety of
personalities.

ADOPTION OF such a system
can come only through the initia
tive of the students themselves.
The freshmen are most directly
involved and should make their
views known. Full success can
only be achieved with the co
operation of the clubs, Stern, and
the fraternities.
Granted, the national affilia
tions of the latter present definite
problems. Nevertheless, some of
these groups have already re
nounced such affiliations and be
come locals due to other prob
lems associated with their rush
systems.
Further action would be both
practical and warranted. It is the
responsibility of ICC. IFC, and
IHC to take a stand on this prob
lem. If they declare against a
change, it is their further respon
sibility to present an adequate de
i fense of the present procedure.
