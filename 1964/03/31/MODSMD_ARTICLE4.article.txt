# Copper Form Caps Plaza
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Staff Editor 
A new 16-foot, bronze-over
copper, free-form fountain
surprised students yesterday
as they made their way to
the IxMik store from register
ing: in the Pavilion. The foun
tain w a s installed during
Spring break by its creator,
sculptor Aristides Denietrins.
The fountain itself, costing
about $25,000, is the finish
ing touch to White Memorial
Plaza, a $200,000 gift from
Mr. and 31 rs. Raymond White
of Kansas City, made in mem
ory of John Barber White II
and Whilliam Nicholas White,
both graduates of Stanford
University.
Demetrios, a 31-year-old
Harvard graduate who took
postgraduate work at the Uni
versity of California's School
of Architecture, told th e
Daily that the fountain is not
entirely completed.
The extremities, now cov
ered with copper plates, will
be welded to the same texture
as the rest; of the surface as
soon as the proper adjust
ments are made on the foun
tain's SO water jets.
By the end of the week the
fountain should be in final
form with a constantly run
ning c a s c a d e of swirling

water. Subsurface lights will
illuminate the fountain at
night. The water will be
switched off automatically
when wind threatens to de
flect the spray beyond th e
fountain's edges.
Demetrios said that lie had
not named the statue as lie
had a number of his o th e r
works. He is known for l> is
large metal sculptures in ilic
shape of waves, flames, or
trees with names such as

"Flame I," and "Sun an (I
Wave." But the Memorial
Plaza fountain cannot be
summed up or described "in
just one word," Demetrius
said.
He explained, however, that
the idea of the design was
to represent "growth and
growing things," in its sweep
ing upward contours.
The fountain is designed
"as a focal point of the land
scape," to relate "not only to
the carefully planned vistas,
trees, benches and buildings
but also to the ebb and flow
of the students." The .jets of
water are to emphasize "the
upward exhilirating move
ment of the work.
Installation of the fountain
was accomplished by a 75-ton
crane which lowered the 3400-
pound form into place. The
fountain was sculptured in
San Francisco and shipped to
Stanford in two sections. De
metrios spent last week add
ing over 200 pounds of metal
plates to the installed form
by means of a 4000-degree arc
welder.
The committee's choice was
applauded by two faculty ad
visory groups (one of which
includes student members),
by the student cultural a its
division of Tresidder Union,
and by the donors
