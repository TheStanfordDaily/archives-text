THORNE
Miss Barrie Thorne, a senior
from Logan, Utah, has been
awarded a Marshall Scholarship,
University officials announced
last week. She is the first Stan
ford woman to receive a Marshall
scholarship.
Miss Thorne, who is majoring
in anthropology, received the
scholarship over seven other can
didates, all of who were male.
She has a cumulative grade point
average of 3.98 as well as a host
of extra-curricular activities.
THE MARSHALL Scholarships,
named after General George C.
Marshall were instituted by the
government of Great Britain in
gratitude for the Marshall Plan
which restored Europe after
World War 11. Since 1951 when
the scholarship was established,
stranded students have won 10
Marshall Scholarships.
The scholarship allows a stu-

dent to study for two years at
any British university with the
possibility of a third year of grad-

uate study. The
si udont may
choose to study
in any graduate
field.
Miss Thorne
has been active
in debate, and
has won many
trophies for her
debating skills.
She has served

in Ihe Model U.S. Senate. She is
also a member of Phi Beta Kappa
scholastic honor society and the
Cap and Gown, the highest all
around honor for a Stanford
woman.
In September she plans to study
at the University of London,
which has an outstanding anthro
pology faculty in its London
School of Economics and Political
Science. Anthropology appeals to
her because of the "variety of
ways in which mankind has lived,
and can live- all possibilities for
human existence."
Miss THORNE comes from a
family of scholars. Her father,
Dr. D. Wynne Thorne, an agio-

nomist, is director of research at
Utah State University. Her
mother holds a Ph.D. in econom
ics and is active in the profession.
Her older brother, Kip, is now
studying theoretical physics at
Princeton on a Danforth fellow
ship.
Of the 24 scholarships awarded
each year, the west is alloted only
! four. Stanford ranks fourth in
j total number of scholarships won,

career in teaching and research,
