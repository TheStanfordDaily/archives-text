• Revolt Hits Brazil
RIO DE JANIERO, Brazil — A spreading
politico military revolt broke out yesterday
against Brazil's left-leaning President Joao
Guolart. A "revolutionary capital" was pro
claimed at Juiz de Fora, in a strongly anti-
Communist belt 80 miles north of Rio de Jan
eiro.
The revolt quickly won support of one
state governor, and two others, including the
governor of huge, industrial Sao Paulo state,
strongly indicated they were ready to join in
the anti-Goulart movement. There were no
immediate reports of fighting.
Simultaneously a railway strike signaled
the possible first counterblow of a general
strike threatened by workers against any at
tempts to unseat Guolart.
Goulart issued a statement saying "they
fool themselves who think they can touch my
mandate which is'principally from the people."
