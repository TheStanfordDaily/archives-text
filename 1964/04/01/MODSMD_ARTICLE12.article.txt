# AEC Manager Attacks Woodside

### 
AEC Regional Manager L. (J.
Mohr, in a letter to a Bay Area
newspaper this morning, refuted
charges that the AEC is "playing
tough" in its approach to I lie
Woodside Community.
"Commission representatives,
for over eight months, have par
ticipated in efforts to solve the
power line problem in a way that
would satisfy the community,"
said Mohr.
He pointed out that PG&E has
never used a single pole structure
for transmission of 220 KV pow
er, but is willing to undertake
what previously has been done
by others only in level country.
"The pole line will not dis
figure vast areas as has been
claimed by the underground pro
ponents. The effect on the area
will be no more serious than ex
tensions of the existing low-volt
age pole lines that presently run
throughout Woodsidc. and a lot
less serious than some of the
housing areas that adorn these
I same hills," said Mohr.
Mohr struck out against Wood
side for its failure to propose
meaningful compromises. "They
are willing to compromise only
the size of the lines; they sup
ply compromise cost estimates
(which are understated and in-
I complete; they are willing to com
| promise by going underground
| through Woodside and overhead
|on Stanford land although
Stanford has been a leading pro
ponent in tho vicinity for under
ground lines where economically
justifiable."
Mohr explained that it was
"made clear as early as August,
1963, that the AEC could not
justify bearing the cost of an
underground line. He cited a
I statement by Craig Hosmer, Rep
resentative from California 011
the Joint Committee on Atomic
Energy, who was quoted in the
New Fork Times on February
23. 1964, as saying that "Uncle
Sam is simply not in a position
to pledge that (an underground
line) to the City of Woodside and
the surrounding community be
cause, if it does, it establishes a
precedent whereby in forty-nine
other States and for thousands
and thousands of miles of line, it
is incurring a contingent obliga
tion of hundreds of millions and
billions of dollars."
"It should be clear," said Mohr,
"that the Government has made
every reasonable effort to be a.
good neighbor, to follow typical
community practice, and to avoid
the necessity of condemnation. It
I should be equally clear that the
j Commission's decision to con
demn was not a precipitous 'get
j tough' action but was a decision
made only after it became obvi
ous that the Town of Woodside
and the other parties involved
were unwilling to agree to any
reasonable compromise."
