# Kissinger Speaks On Arms Race
## 
### ELIZABETH FREEMAN 
"Both military and political
viewpoints must bo considered in
I he planning of effective strategy
and foreign policy," stated Henry
A. Kissinger, in his Tuesday Eve
ning Series talk concerning
world problems from the develop
ment of modern weapons. A poli
tical leader must not only under
stand a military strategy, but be
lieve in it and be willing to act on
it in a time of stress. In the
United Staes, a dichotomy exists
between the complicated strategy
plans that are often presented,
and the short time the policy
makers have to study and act
upon the strategy.
The relationship of our military
policy to the uncommitted world
is a more troublesome problem
today than ever before. In times
of international emergencies, only
the few agencies in the position
to act are consulted and have the
chance to exercise their opinions,
although many agencies have the
right to be consulted. This situa
tion stimulates the dispute over
the possession of nuclear weap
ons within alliances.
World power has become bi
polar, he said, and this has re
sulted in a decreasing tendency
for lesser powers to join in alli
ances. Neither of the powers can
afford a power gain in their oppo
nent. so both have the incentive
to assist and protect other coun
tries as necessary in this respect.
When India was attacked by
Pakistan in recent years, India
received as much aid from the
U.S. as she would from being in
an alliance. De Gaulle knows the
U.S. can't change its policy of
protection, and so feels great
freedom of movement in his own
policy-formation.
"Plie deference factor is more
important than the actual inten
tions of a country toward mili
tary action. A serious threat, tak
en as a bluff, can have less effect
than a bluff which is taken seri
ously. Strategy details turn into j
political and psychological prob-j
Jems. A country which appears
willing to its opponent to be "irra
tional" and sacrifice many mem
bers, can afford to have a low
force of weapons. Conversely, a
more diplomatic policy must be j
balanced with a larger military
force. A strong power should not
have a "reckless" diplomatic pol
icy, he felt.
