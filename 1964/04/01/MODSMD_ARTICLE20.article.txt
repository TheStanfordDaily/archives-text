WELL-KNOWN FAMOUS PEOPLE: No. 1
This is the first in a series of 48 million columns examining 11 io
careers of men who have significantly altered the world we live
in. We begin today with Max Planck.
Max Planck (or The Pearl of the Pacific, as he is often
called) gave to modern physics the law known as Planck's
Constant. Many people when they first hear of this law, throw
up their hands and exclaim, "Golly whiskers, this is too deep
for little old me!"
(Incidentally, speaking of whiskers, I cannot help but men
tion Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades. Personna is the
blade for people who can't shave after every meal. It shaves
you closely, cleanly, and more frequently than any other
stainless steel blade on the market. The makers of Personna
have publicly declared—and do here repeat—that if Personna
Blades don't give you more luxury shaves than any other
stainless steel blade, they will buy you whatever blade you
think is better. Could anything be more fair? 1, for one, think
not.)

But I digress. We were speaking of Planck's Constant, which
is not, as many think, difficult to understand. It, simply states
that matter sometimes behaves like waves, and waves some
times behave like matter. To give you a homely illustration,
pick up your pencil and wave it. Your pencil, you will surely
agree, is matter —yet look at the little rascal wave! Or take
flags. Or Ann-Margret.
Planck's Constant, uncomplicated as it is, nevertheless pro
vided science with the key that unlocked the atom, made space
travel possible, and conquered denture slippage. Honors were
heaped upon Mr. Planck (or The City of Brotherly Love, as
he is familiarly known a.s). He was awarded the Nobel Prize,
the Little Brown Jug, and Disneyland. But the honor that
pleased Mr. Planck most was that plankton were named after
him.
Plankton, as we know, are the floating colonies of one-celled
animals on which fishes feed. Plankton, in their turn, feed
upon one-half celled animals called krill (named, incidentally,
after Dr. Morris Krill who invented the house cat). Krill, in
their turn, feed upon peanut butter sandwiches mostly—or,
when they are in season, cheeseburgers.
But I digress. Back to Max Planck who, it must be said,
showed no indication of his scientific genius as a youngster.
Jn fact, for the first six years of his life he did not speak at all
except to pound his spoon on his bowl and shout "More gruel!"
Imagine, then, the surprise of his parents when on his seven! h
birthday little Max suddenly cried, "Papa! Mama! Something
is wrong with the Second Law of Thermodynamics!" So aston
ished were the elder Plancks that they rushed out and dug the
Kiel Canal.
M canwhile Max, constructing a crude Petrie dish out of two
small pieces of petrie and his gruel bowl, began to experiment
with thermodynamics. By dinner time he had discovered
Planck's Constant. Hungry but happy, he rushed to Heidelberg
University to announce his findings. He arrived, unfortunately,
during the Erich von Stroheim Sesquicentennial, and (veryone
was so busy dancing and duelling that young Planck could find
nobody to listen to him. The festival, however, ended after
two years and Planck was finally able to report bis discovery.
Well sir, the rest is history. Einstein gaily cried, "E equals
mc squared!" Edison invented Marconi. Eli Whitney invented
Georgia Tech, and Michelangelo invented the ceiling. This
later became known as the Humboldt Current.

Mr. Shu I man is. of course, joshing, hut the makers of
Personna Modes are not: if. after trying our blades, you
think there's another stainless steel blade that gives you
more luxury shares, return the unused Personnas to fi>tx
500, Staunton, VYi., and we'll buy you a pack of any blade
on I/link is better.
