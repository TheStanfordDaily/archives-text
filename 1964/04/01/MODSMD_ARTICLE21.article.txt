Director Whitaker, who is also
dean of Stanford's Graduate Di
vision, notes that "The variety
and scope of our Festival pro
gram is made possible by Univer
sity sponsorship. Because of our
rich diversity of faculty talents
and study programs, we probably
can mount a greater number of
'different' an d intellectually
stimulating events than commer
cial sponsorship of such a pro
gram would allow."
The complete calendar of Festi
val activities will be available
from the campus after May 1.
Mail orders only are now be
ing accepted for Festival perform
ances. Ticket order forms are
available on request from Stan
