## Eagles Acquire Snead 
### 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) â€” The
Philadelphia Eagles traded quar
terback Sonny Jurgensen and de
fensive back Jimmy Carr to the
Washington Redskins Tuesday
for quarterback Norman Snead
and defensive back Claude Crabb.
The trade was the second major
move in less than two weeks by
the Eagles, striving to rebuild a
last place club under Joe Kuha
rich, their new coach.
Kuharich said he was trading
experience for youth and felt a
change of scenery might help all
the players involved.
Jurgensen is 29 and a veteran
of seven years in the National
Football League. Snead is 24, and

only three years out of Wake
Forest College. Carr is 31, while
Crabb is 24.
