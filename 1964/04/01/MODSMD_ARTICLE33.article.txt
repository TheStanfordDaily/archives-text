SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—The
Big Six Conference unanimously
1 yoted Oregon and Oregon Stale j
: University into membership Tups
j day.
Dr. Norman Topping of South
ern California, chairman of the
board of presidents and chancel
lors of the Rig Six the Athletic
Association of Western Univer
sities — had the announcement
made from his office in Los An
geles.
IT FOLLOWS a secret moet-

ing of the conference presidents
of San Francisco.
President Arthur S. Fleming of
the University of Oregon and
President James H. Jensen of ;
OSU, who attended the meeting, j
accepted the invitation in behalf |
of their schools.
The realignment of what was '
the old Pacific Coast Conference
goes into effect July 1.
TIIE OLD conference broke up I
in bitterness and personal feuds i
in 1959.
Dr. Topping, who has openly 1

, campaigned for a reunion of the
; old schools, said:
"This action represents a nat
ural association, not only for
athletics but for higher education
on the West Coast."
THERE HAS been almost a
complete changeover of upper
echelon officials in all the schools
since the big blow-up that brought
an end to almost one-half century
of the life of the PCC.
While long anticipated, Tues
day's action came as a surprise.

Even Athletic Director Jess Hill
of Southern California did not
know of the meeting, nor of the
decision until it was announced.
The Seattle Times had
Tuesday presidents of the Big Six
Conference were meeting secretly
in a hotel near the San Francisco
International Airport "to invite
Oregon State University and the
University of Oregon into the con
ference."
"THEY DECLINED to accept
telephone calls," ihe article said.
"The University of Oregon in

Eugene and Oregon State Univer
sity in Corvallis said their presi
dents, Dr. Arthur S. Fleming and
Dr. Jamos H. Jensen, were out
of town and unavailable.
"This led to speculation thoy
also attended the San Francisco
meeting."
Til 10 ANNUAL spring meeting
of the conference, formally the
Athletic Association of Western
Universities, is scheduled for Se
attle May 30-June 2.
Since the two Oregon schools
are joining the conference, th e y
will he represented at the spring
meeting. This reunites all mem
bers of the old Pacific Coast: Con
ference except Idaho.
Presumably at this meeting the
athletic directors will gel to
gether to agree on the many de
tails of the new or is it the old
conference.
There has been almost a com
plete change in administration
presidents, athletic directors,
coaches —at the schools since the
dissolution of the old conference.
The membership now includes
Washington, Washington Stole,
Oregon, Oregon State, California,
: Stanford, UCLA and Soul hern
I Cal.
CONTROL OF the association,
! which rose from the ashes of tho
i PCC, rests with Ihe university
I presidents. Faculty athletic rep
resentatives controlled the pre
i vious conference.
Stanford was not formally rep
resented at the meeting due to
President Sterling's illness, but
nevertheless cast a vote in absen
tia for the admittance of the
Oregon schools.
An official at San Francisco
| said that Oregon and Oregon
State will become immediately
eligible for the big New Year's
Day game at Pasadena.
Conference policy says a rep
resentative school, not necessarily
the champion, may represent it
in the Rose Bowl.
WHKN the PCC collapsed, Ore
gon, Oregon State, Idaho a n d
Washington State were ineligible
for the Bowl.
Since school grid schedules are
made out for several years to
come, it will be some time before
anything resembling the old
round robin system can be re
installed. The system requires
each school to play a full sched
ule against conference opponents.
Oregon State will play four
conference foes in 1964, 1965 and
1966, Oregon plays four this year,
five in 1965, four in 1966 and six
in 1967.
There is some doubt that the

now schools can figure in 1 ho ;
basketball round robin.
The meeting was behind closed j
doors and strictly hush-hush. But i
it appeared that many of the do-1
tails had been settled in advance, j
