# WIN 11-1
## Card Nine Crushes St. Mary's 
### 
The Stanford baseball team
routed St. Mary's 11-1 in a seven
inning rain shortened contest
here yesterday.
Both teams collected seven hits,

but that was about the only
equality that existed between the
squads all afternoon as the In
dians dominated the game
throughout.

The Tribe wrapped up the game
for good in Ihe seventh as they
came through with six big runs
before the rains came and the
game had to be called.
Although the Tribe clubbed
home eleven runs, their longest
hit of the day came on a double
by George Thacher in the big In
dian seventh.
