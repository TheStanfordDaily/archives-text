# The 						Way To Run A Civil Rights Demonstration
## Editorial End Of An Era? 
### 
Since The Daily went on vacation three
weeks ago, Bay Area civil rights activities
have been very much in the news.
And by far the most impressive of the
demonstrations occurred in Palo Alto a week
ago Sunday, when 2,500 persons attended a
local rally protesting efforts of the California
Ileal Estate Association (CREA) to repeal
the Rumford Act. (CREA was holding a
state convention here at the time.)
TIIE RALLY and earlier picketing con
trasted starkly with other recent rights pro
tests in the area. Unlike the motley lawless
ness in the mass demonstrations at the Shera

ton-Palace and the Lucky Stores, the Palo
Alto rally was conducted in a very orderly
fashion, without incidents.
It was refreshing to see the large num
ber of local families (many of them asso
ciated with Stanford) that participated,
dressed in business suits and Sunday
dresses.
Their goal is an honorable one: the main
tenance of a law designed to prohibit dis
crimination in housing accommodations, a
law that puts human rights over property
rights.
And their methods should be emulated
by all sincere Rumford Act supporters.

The newly installed fountain in White
Memorial Plaza has fanned anew the fires
of artistic controversy at Stanford, and the
flood of student comment promises to sur
pass even that about the unfortunate Mrs.
Keane.
Pranksters have decorated the 16-foot

form as a Christmas tree. Wags have pro
posed comic names. And some of the more
"open" minds have already accepted Deme
trios' work as a masterpiece.
With all due humility, we cannot pre
sume to judge the fountain's ultimate artistic
merits. That debate will no doubt rage on
—both in fun and in earnest—for some time
to come. We would confess, if pressed, that
the great message of the work remains
somewhat ambiguous, and so we reserve
comment.
BUT THE FOUNTAIN has had a dis
tinctly positive effect. It has created the de
bate. It lias produced a stimulation that has

been largely lacking at Stanford, the stimu
lation of the daring and the unusual that
one should expect in a university "on the
edge of greatness."
The fountain adds something of value to
the bright and sunny atmosphere of "Mem
Plaz." It replaces uniformity with contrast,
sameness with variety. Stanford has finally
stepped beyond the dully functional and
banal, the idea that something is good be
cause "there is nothing wrong with it.'
Stanford, for the moment at least, has
abandoned the era of the good old red-tile
roof. We hope that this is a new trend and
that the trend continues.
