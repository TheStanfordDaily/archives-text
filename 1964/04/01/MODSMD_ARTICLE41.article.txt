## Rush System Objections Called Hardly Relevant 
### Pell Fender 
Mr. Gillam yesterday pointed out that each year a tew pro- j
tests against the existing [fraternity rush] system are voiced, j
There are, however, few rebuttals against these protests. One
might guess that either fraternity members are ashamed of their
system, or that the logic ol the fraternity system cannot stand up
to the logic of alternative systems. Neither is the ease.
Mr. Gillain states his belief that both the fraternity and the
individual share a mutual misunderstanding about each other.
Presumably Mr. Gillam does not desire to lengthen the period of
rush, but rather to abolish rush altogether. Mr. Gillams objection
is hardly relevant. Ane might ask if people ever know each other
well enough to meet Mr. Gillam s criterion of a "rational" choice.
Or, better still, one might w hat constitutes a "rational" choice.
Any choice of friends, interests or a living group is an emotional
one, and hardly rational.

MK. GILLAM also states, "... the most damaging indict
ment of rush lies with the system s essential denial of the individ
ual." First of all, while a persons qualities must be compared to
some group, the scope of a person's individuality depends on the
individual, and is less subject to group dictum that Mr. Gillam
might believe.
Secondly, the unity of a smaller group like a fraternitx inspires
a valuable sort of character, resulting from the need to com
promise in order to get along. While this compromise can sup
press individuality in a few cases, the end result is one ol adapta
bility and an expanded concept of individuality.
An alternative to the fraternity system such as Stern Hall en
courages individuality insofar as that person is an individual al
ready. Stern Hall does little, lacking unity, to encourage expan
sion of personality. The urge for expansion must come from
within the individual himself. Since not all of us possess a
dynamic personality, we change little in Stern Hall. It is precisely
the cohesion of a group such as the fraternity which can stimu
late expansion, rather than, as Mr. Gillam thinks, repress person
ality growth.

GONTRARY TO Mr. Gillams image a fraternity is not all
parties and roughhousing. It means different things to different
people. As to being selective, fraternity members merely forma
lize selectivity. Every person is selective in his choice of friei)ds,
activities, and responsibilities. Gontrary to Mr. Gillam s implica
tions once an individual enters a fraternity, the concrete door to j
the outside does not slam shut. A fraternity member's friends are I
limited neither in theory or practice to the fraternity alone.
Mr. Gillam and I obviously view the issue in the context of i
inexperience with the alternative. Neither ol us has seen much of j
the other. Sonsequentlv, each one s conception of the other is !
limited to misleading and superficial stereotypes.
The fraternity system is not evil, restrictive, or prohibitive. The
fraternity members have made a choice more "rational" than Mr.
Gillam might believe, but we are all subject to the choice among [
alternatives.
