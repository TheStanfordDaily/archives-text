# U.S. Soldier Writes On War In Vietnam
## 
### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: The tol
lowing letter was received by
Stanford student Martin Ed
gar from a friend who is a
i lie in her of (lie U.S. psychologi
cal warfare hatallion in Sai
gon. Tile writer refers to a
Daily article on Vietnam by
Cherry Arnold.
The little matter of the Viet
nam policy group at Stanford
raises a point of interest in
me. I might be classed as a
member of the Everett Dirksen
fan club, better known as the
War Mongers. I am not in
sympathy with Mike Mansfield
or Charles DeGaulle or Miss
Cherry Arnold. Nor am I in
sympathy with the honorable
Mr. McNamara and his Penta
gon band.
Sure, I think the war ought
to be carried North because
we are losing it down here. 1
think a little infiltration and
bombing in Hanoi would be
euate. If we neutralize this
place it will be in communist
hands in a year or two. They
need the rice down here too
much to ever let it go. Look
at Laos. It's falling and it's
neutral.
Of course 1 realize thai Miss
Cherry Arnold is a conscienti
ous person full of her destiny
as a humane formulator of
public opinion. McNamara has
thousands of people like this
on his back and they consti
tute public opinion. They say
its terrible we are in a war
here and that the facts of the
matter are hidden . . .
Wc are losing. We can't seem
to get the people in charge
here off their behinds. The
common people here have had
it rough and they are war
weary. They have done some
tremendous things only to see
them lost by those in charge
over here. They have had this
since 1954 and a French tyran
ny before that. Still, the sol
diers keep on going.
Now they must wonder
about the Americans. We have
only been at it for a few years
and now we are tired of it be
cause we can't seem to w in
right away. They feel just a
little deserted by people like

Cherry Arnold. As is always
the case, the common people
get it in the neck from people
who are too short-sighted and
have nothing to lose person
ally.
I have something to lose
called friends. Friends like
Waung Tiang who has been
running from the commies
since 1950. First China, then
North Vietnam. He has no
where left to go. Australia and
the U.S. have immigration
laws against him.
Let Miss Arnold have a
look at a geography book. If
South Vietnam falls, Thailand
and Cambodia must fall. A
great trade will be lost to the
U.S. Red China gets it's rice
and a moderately successful
people (by their standards)
will fall onto the evil days that
always follow communism.
Tell the humane Miss Arnold
to get out of her Ivory Tower
and have another look. I can
take a few more months of
bambings and terrorism. I'm
sure she can too . . . from a
good distance. Humane people
will be the death of us all
yet. . . ."

Editor, The Daily:
1 am writing this letter in
response to a newspaper
photograph entitled "A Vic
tory in Vietnam." Three hun
dred peasant men suspected of
being Communists were
rounded up and placed in
barbed wire compounds. The
photograph shows a Vietna
mese woman trying, "with the
futile help of her small son, to
break away from a soldier and
follow her man as he was be
ing marched away." Is this
really a victory?
What does this peasant wom
an know about Communism?
Does her husband really un
derstand Marxist theory or is
he fighting because he is poor
and unhappy with appressive
conditions that would make
any American miserable? Are
the purposes of the Cold War
reallv so noble that we can

justify the separation of this
husband and wife? Are we
supporting a military dictator
ship and fighting a war in Viet
nam in oider 1o help these un
happy peasants to live in a
free country? I feci that the
hysteria of the Cold War has
made us callous to the suffer
ings of these people and that
we have forgotten the most im
portant principle of brotherly
love. . . .
If we must lead them, lot us
help them to overcome poverty
and disease and let us insist
that even those husbands and
wives who disagree with our
economic philosophies be
granted the right to live to

photograph entitled "A Vic
tory in Vietnam." Three hun
dred peasant men suspected of
being Communists were
rounded up and placed in
barbed wire compounds. The
photograph shows a Vietna
mese woman trying, "with the
futile help of her small son, to
break away from a soldier and
follow her man as he was be
ing marched away." Is this
really a victory?
What does this peasant wom
an know about Communism?
Does her husband really un
derstand Marxist theory or is
he fighting because he is poor
and unhappy with appressive
conditions that would make
any American miserable? Are
the purposes of the Cold War
reallv so noble that we can

justify the separation of this
husband and wife? Are we
supporting a military dictator
ship and fighting a war in Viet

happy peasants to live in a
free country? I feci that the
hysteria of the Cold War has
made us callous to the suffer
ings of these people and that
we have forgotten the most im

The little matter of the Viet

raises a point of interest in
me. I might be classed as a

fan club, better known as the
War Mongers. I am not in
sympathy with Mike Mansfield
or Charles DeGaulle or Miss
Cherry Arnold. Nor am I in
sympathy with the honorable
Mr. McNamara and his Penta

Sure, I think the war ought
to be carried North because
we are losing it down here. 1
think a little infiltration and
bombing in Hanoi would be
euate. If we neutralize this
place it will be in communist
hands in a year or two. They
need the rice down here too
much to ever let it go. Look
at Laos. It's falling and it's
neutral.
Of course 1 realize thai Miss
Cherry Arnold is a conscienti

as a humane formulator of
public opinion. McNamara has
thousands of people like this
on his back and they consti
tute public opinion. They say
its terrible we are in a war
here and that the facts of the
matter are hidden . . .
Wc are losing. We can't seem
to get the people in charge
here off their behinds. The
common people here have had
it rough and they are war
weary. They have done some
tremendous things only to see
them lost by those in charge
over here. They have had this
since 1954 and a French tyran
ny before that. Still, the sol
diers keep on going.
Now they must wonder
about the Americans. We have
only been at it for a few years
and now we are tired of it be
cause we can't seem to w in
right away. They feel just a
little deserted by people like

Cherry Arnold. As is always
the case, the common people
get it in the neck from people
who are too short-sighted and
have nothing to lose person

I have something to lose

EDITOR'S NOTE: The tol

Stanford student Martin Ed
gar from a friend who is a
i lie in her of (lie U.S. psychologi
cal warfare hatallion in Sai
gon. Tile writer refers to a
Daily article on Vietnam by
Cherry Arnold.
The little matter of the Viet
nam policy group at Stanford
raises a point of interest in
me. I might be classed as a
member of the Everett Dirksen
fan club, better known as the
War Mongers. I am not in
sympathy with Mike Mansfield
or Charles DeGaulle or Miss
Cherry Arnold. Nor am I in
sympathy with the honorable
Mr. McNamara and his Penta
gon band.
Sure, I think the war ought
to be carried North because
we are losing it down here. 1
think a little infiltration and
bombing in Hanoi would be
euate. If we neutralize this
place it will be in communist
hands in a year or two. They
need the rice down here too
much to ever let it go. Look
at Laos. It's falling and it's
neutral.
Of course 1 realize thai Miss
Cherry Arnold is a conscienti
ous person full of her destiny
as a humane formulator of
public opinion. McNamara has
thousands of people like this
on his back and they consti
tute public opinion. They say
its terrible we are in a war
here and that the facts of the
matter are hidden . . .
Wc are losing. We can't seem
to get the people in charge
here off their behinds. The
common people here have had
it rough and they are war
weary. They have done some
tremendous things only to see
them lost by those in charge
over here. They have had this
since 1954 and a French tyran
ny before that. Still, the sol
diers keep on going.
Now they must wonder
about the Americans. We have
only been at it for a few years
and now we are tired of it be
cause we can't seem to w in
right away. They feel just a
little deserted by people like

Cherry Arnold. As is always
the case, the common people
get it in the neck from people
who are too short-sighted and
have nothing to lose person
ally.
I have something to lose
called friends. Friends like
Waung Tiang who has been
running from the commies
since 1950. First China, then
North Vietnam. He has no
where left to go. Australia and
the U.S. have immigration
laws against him.
Let Miss Arnold have a
look at a geography book. If
South Vietnam falls, Thailand
and Cambodia must fall. A
great trade will be lost to the
U.S. Red China gets it's rice
and a moderately successful
people (by their standards)
will fall onto the evil days that
always follow communism.
Tell the humane Miss Arnold
to get out of her Ivory Tower
and have another look. I can
take a few more months of
bambings and terrorism. I'm
sure she can too . . . from a
good distance. Humane people
will be the death of us all

Editor, The Daily:
1 am writing this letter in
response to a newspaper
photograph entitled "A Vic
tory in Vietnam." Three hun
dred peasant men suspected of
being Communists were
rounded up and placed in
barbed wire compounds. The
photograph shows a Vietna
mese woman trying, "with the
futile help of her small son, to
break away from a soldier and
follow her man as he was be
ing marched away." Is this
really a victory?
What does this peasant wom
an know about Communism?
Does her husband really un
derstand Marxist theory or is
he fighting because he is poor
and unhappy with appressive
conditions that would make
any American miserable? Are
the purposes of the Cold War
reallv so noble that we can

justify the separation of this
husband and wife? Are we
supporting a military dictator
ship and fighting a war in Viet
nam in oider 1o help these un
happy peasants to live in a
free country? I feci that the
hysteria of the Cold War has
made us callous to the suffer
ings of these people and that
we have forgotten the most im

If we must lead them, lot us
