## Draft Wayne Movement Started By Students 
### Justin Beck 
Sonic foolish people think that students have little political or
civic sense. But they are wrong. Even in Dallas, a city of ques
-1 tionablc civic virtue, students are proving themselves to be politi
cal activists. For it was at the University of Dallas according to
UP I, that a group of students opened a drive to draft celluloid
hero John Wayne for the Republican presidential nomination,
using the slogan "We need a president who can act."
And Wayne indeed is a natural choice for the Republican
party and judging from his movies Wayne is fully endowed with
the necessary patriotic virtue, hard headedness, and frontier spirit
to satisfy even the National Review, a publication that most presi
| dential candidates normally find hard to please.
His wartime movie record is amazing. One wonders why the
government spent so much money developing the atomic bomb
w hen for considerably less cost they could have dropped Wayne
on a few Japanese cities. In one movie armed with only a bull
dozer he stopped a massive enemy attack that had threatened to
! beat the Americans.
★ ★ ★
ONE OF HIS most memorable roles is that of an FBI man,
battling those Commies in Hawaii. And he has a lot of battling
i to do since in this movie it seems that most of the people in
: Hawaii are Commies. There are so many that one could wonder
that perhaps the FBI had erred and sent Wayne to the Kremlin
rather than Honolulu.
But in the end he manages to punch most of them in the nose,
simultaneously ending a couple of assaults on American minds:
one by the Communists and one by Hollywood. Would Khru
i shchev dare to talk back to a president like that? Probably not
unless lie had a doctor along that specialized in repairing broken
noses.
There is one thing that might stand in the way of Wayne get
ting the nomination. 11 you've noticed he's got a different girl in
i every picture. Nelson Rockefeller tried it only once and found
| that pre-election political success is only a state of mind. But
i Wayne has one redeeming feature; unlike Rocky, he marries none
! of them, a political advantage if there ever was one.

BUT WHERE have the Stanford Young Republicans been
while the Draft Wayne movement was being formed? They were
out supporting Barry Goklvvater, a Senator from Arizona whose
mind is about as fertile as his local desert. Occasionally an idea
may pop up, but for the most part the Goldwater intellect can
product only political cactus and Arizona-based duststorms.
1 think in chosing Goldwater the YR,s have definitely backed
the wrong rightist. John Waynes movie roles a* a man who shoots
first and thinks later, il at all, have established himself as at least
a mental equal of Coldwater's, and Wayne has been nationally
well known long before Goldwater was ever elected to the Sen
ate from Arizona, and perhaps even before there was an Arizona.
And at the very least, if elected President, Wayne could plav con
vincingly the role of a statesman.

ONE OF HIS most memorable roles is that of an FBI man,
battling those Commies in Hawaii. And he has a lot of battling
i to do since in this movie it seems that most of the people in
: Hawaii are Commies. There are so many that one could wonder
that perhaps the FBI had erred and sent Wayne to the Kremlin
rather than Honolulu.
But in the end he manages to punch most of them in the nose,
simultaneously ending a couple of assaults on American minds:
one by the Communists and one by Hollywood. Would Khru
i shchev dare to talk back to a president like that? Probably not
unless lie had a doctor along that specialized in repairing broken
noses.
There is one thing that might stand in the way of Wayne get
ting the nomination. 11 you've noticed he's got a different girl in
i every picture. Nelson Rockefeller tried it only once and found
| that pre-election political success is only a state of mind. But
i Wayne has one redeeming feature; unlike Rocky, he marries none
! of them, a political advantage if there ever was one.

BUT WHERE have the Stanford Young Republicans been
while the Draft Wayne movement was being formed? They were
out supporting Barry Goklvvater, a Senator from Arizona whose
mind is about as fertile as his local desert. Occasionally an idea
may pop up, but for the most part the Goldwater intellect can
product only political cactus and Arizona-based duststorms.
1 think in chosing Goldwater the YR,s have definitely backed
the wrong rightist. John Waynes movie roles a* a man who shoots
first and thinks later, il at all, have established himself as at least
a mental equal of Coldwater's, and Wayne has been nationally
well known long before Goldwater was ever elected to the Sen
ate from Arizona, and perhaps even before there was an Arizona.
And at the very least, if elected President, Wayne could plav con
vincingly the role of a statesman.

Sonic foolish people think that students have little political or
civic sense. But they are wrong. Even in Dallas, a city of ques
-1 tionablc civic virtue, students are proving themselves to be politi
cal activists. For it was at the University of Dallas according to
UP I, that a group of students opened a drive to draft celluloid
hero John Wayne for the Republican presidential nomination,
using the slogan "We need a president who can act."
And Wayne indeed is a natural choice for the Republican
party and judging from his movies Wayne is fully endowed with
the necessary patriotic virtue, hard headedness, and frontier spirit
to satisfy even the National Review, a publication that most presi
| dential candidates normally find hard to please.
His wartime movie record is amazing. One wonders why the
government spent so much money developing the atomic bomb
w hen for considerably less cost they could have dropped Wayne
on a few Japanese cities. In one movie armed with only a bull
dozer he stopped a massive enemy attack that had threatened to
! beat the Americans.
