# Pacifists Protest ROTC
## 
### VIC SARTOR 
Peace Caucus members pre
sented a petition yesterday to the
ROTC officers asking them to re
frain from "brainwashing" Stan
ford students.
Caucus members claim that
there is no place on the campus
of a university such as Stanford
for militaristic ideas. They would
prefer that the ROTC hold its
classes and drill somewhere off
campus.
TO EMPHASIZE the serious
ness of the situation, the Peace
Caucus conducted a "lie in" at
the soccer field, where the ROTC
drilled yesterday. Commanding
officer Victor Frisbee told the
demonstrators. "Either you pre
verts (sic) get off of our drill
field or we'll be forced to com
mit mayhem upon you."
In the ensuing riot, seven per
son were seriously injured. Drill
continued for the cadets, however,
throughout the riot.
It was at this point that the
Peace Caucus went into a caucus.
Newton Meters. 39-vear-old uh.vs

ies major and spokesman for the
Caucus, explained the result. "We
had taken enough abuse from the
war - mongering ROTC through
the years. After a vote, we de
| cided to wipe them out."
ARMED WITH several dozen
.22 caliber rifles, knives, molotov
! cocktails, and assorted slingshots. \
i the peace Caucus had advanced i
1 to "Mem Aud" by sundown only I
to be forced to retreat to the
Memorial Lavatory after a eoun
' ter-attack.
ROTC soldiers were holding a
superior position in Hoover Tower
guarding the entrance to the
ROTC building at midnight.
1 "Actually, the only reason we're
j up here is that we missed the
| last elevator down at 5 p.m.," |
j said Emmet McFadden, ROTC j
cadet.
The Anarchist Caucus was re-1
portcdly furnishing organization
al support for the sudden upris-1
i ing. Anarchist president, Ludlow
j Farthwater, stated. "Contrary to
| rumors, our weapons did not j
come from Cuba. They came from '
; Viet Nam."
ROTC' COLONEL Victor Fris

bee said, "We were not aware of
the war until seven hours after
it had started. I was sitting in my
office reading a copy of Reader's
Digest when a wild-eyed radical
kicked down the door and started
shooting rubber bands at mo, I
calmly disarmed him and muti
lated his body."
Eyewitness reports say ROTC
cadets were not fighting effici
ently because they were stricken
with laughter. "Everytime we
start an offensive, the Peace
Caucus plays a tape recording by
somebody named Norman Thom
as. After listening to it we burst
into laughter and fall back into
the trenches, to weak to even
stand up," said one cadet.
University officials were alleg
edly disturbed over the incident.
A spokesman said, "We under
stand that the Peace Caucus is
using molotov cocktails. We can
not comprehend how they could
do such a senseless thing. If is
an occurrence that may ruin Stan
ford's good name. This is a dry
campus and we plan to keep it
that way. Nothing like this has
I'vrr occurred on Auril first."

into laughter and fall back into
the trenches, to weak to even
stand up," said one cadet.
University officials were alleg
edly disturbed over the incident.
A spokesman said, "We under
stand that the Peace Caucus is
using molotov cocktails. We can
not comprehend how they could
do such a senseless thing. If is
an occurrence that may ruin Stan
ford's good name. This is a dry
campus and we plan to keep it
that way. Nothing like this has
I'vrr occurred on Auril first."
Peace Caucus members pre
sented a petition yesterday to the
ROTC officers asking them to re
frain from "brainwashing" Stan
ford students.
Caucus members claim that
there is no place on the campus
of a university such as Stanford
for militaristic ideas. They would
prefer that the ROTC hold its
classes and drill somewhere off
campus.
TO EMPHASIZE the serious
ness of the situation, the Peace
Caucus conducted a "lie in" at
the soccer field, where the ROTC
drilled yesterday. Commanding
officer Victor Frisbee told the
demonstrators. "Either you pre
verts (sic) get off of our drill
field or we'll be forced to com
mit mayhem upon you."
In the ensuing riot, seven per
son were seriously injured. Drill
continued for the cadets, however,
throughout the riot.
It was at this point that the
Peace Caucus went into a caucus.

had taken enough abuse from the
war - mongering ROTC through

Eyewitness reports say ROTC
cadets were not fighting effici

with laughter. "Everytime we
