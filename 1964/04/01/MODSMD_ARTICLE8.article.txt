# SLAC Dispute Still Rages
## Salinger: AEC Will Look Again 
### 
Senatorial candidate Pierre Sal
inger announced this week that
Atomic Energy Commission
Chairman Glenn Seaborg has
agreed to reexamine the AEC's
position on the power line to the
Stanford Linear Accelerator.
Woodside and Pacific Gas and
Electric have agreed to put up
$1.1 million to help finance un
derground lines to the accelera
tor, but the AEC has offered only
$220,000 of the $2.5 million deficit.
INSTEAD, the AFX has pro
posed a "less adequate" higher
cost overhead line on tapered
tubular poles which would be less
destructive to the scenic beauty
of the Woodside area.
San Mateo County has issued a
conditional use permit for such
lines, but Woodside has continued
to deny PG&E's petition for a
permit for overhead lines through
that community.
As a result the AEC has taken
steps to "initiate government ac
quisition, by condemnation at the
earliest practiable date, of the
parts of the Searsville route with
in the jurisdiction of the Town of
Woodside."
IN A LETTER to Woodside
Mayor Donald Graham and San
Mateo County Manager E. R.
Stallings, Seaborg warned that if
Sail Mateo should withdraw its
conditional use permit for a tubu
lar pole line route, the AEC will
move to condemn the entire route
and will construct 120-foot tow
el's, instead of the less offensive
63-foot tubular poles.
In the letter to Graham, Sea
borg said that the AEC "has gone
far to meet the understandable
aesthetic desires" of the Wood
side residents, but that "in the
absence of . . . Congressional au
thorization, the commission be
lieves that ... it cannot under
take to pay virtually all of the
extra expense of placing the
transmission line underground."
Salinger, who was in Washing
ton for a television broadcast,
said he urged Seaborg to order
the underground powerlines. "I'm
hoping something can be worked
out," he said.
