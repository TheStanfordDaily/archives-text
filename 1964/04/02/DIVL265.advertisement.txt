Power From On High
While scientists seek to harness thermonuclear energy in order to generate
electric power and to tame the vast forces inherent in the atom, God's greater
power resources available to all Christians often remain untapped. \\ hen a person
becomes a Christian, that is, when a person accepts Jesus Christ as Lord and
Saviour, a very real transformation occurs. God as the Holy Spirit conies into
the body of the regenerated believer, taloes up residence there, and will thenceforth
never leave him. Thus, the Christian finds that God is always very close at hand.
"Have you (Christians) forgotten that your body is the temple of the Holy
Spirit, who lives in you. and is God's gift to you, and that you are the owner
of your own body? Yvna have been bought with a price, and at what a pricc."
I Cor. 6 :19, 20, Phillips,
Because the Holy Spirit is within him, the Christian knows beyond a shadow
of a doubt that he or site l/elomrs forever to Jesus Christ. "The Spirit itself
benreth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God." Romans 8:16.
Christian lives which are yielded and surrendered to Christ are thrilling
and victorious. The course of history can be turned, situations can be trans
formed, and problems dispelled if Christians will allow the Iloly Spirit to use
their bodies as instruments of God.
"Rut as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons
of' God, even to them that believe on hi- name: Which were born, not of blood,
nor of the will of the tlrsh, nor of the will of man, but of God." John 1:12, 13.
However, the Christian is of "no earthly good for heaven's sake" unless he
or she is yielded and willing to let Christ be Lord and Guide.
Uneonfessed sin and corners of live lived for self quench and grieve the prcc
iotis lloly Spirit, suppressing His inrtnence in the life of the believer.
"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present
your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is ><>ur reasonable
service. And l>e not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renew
ing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect,
will of God." Romans 12:1, 2.
Tf you are a Christian, but are not leading a victorious Christian life, then
you are not tapping GtolT* unlimited resources which are available to you. Why
not surrender yourself to God, and let the Holy Spirit live the life of Christ
through you?
"Even the mystery which bath been hid from ages and from generations, but
, now is made manifest to his saints: To whom God would make known what is
the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ iti
you, the hope of glory: Whom we. pr-*ach, warning every man. and teaching
every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus";
i Col. 1:26-28.
