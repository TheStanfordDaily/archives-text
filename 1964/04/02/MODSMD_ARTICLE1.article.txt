• Soviet's Goal Is Prosperity.
BUDAPEST. Hungary — Soviet Premier
Khrushchev said yesterday, "Prosperity is the
only thing worthwhile to struggle for."
The Soviet leader ridiculed Red China for
offering nothing but revolution in its cam
paign for uprisings around the world in the
name of hard-line communism.
"If we could promise people nothing better
than revolution," Khrushchev told 5,000 work
ers at a Budapest electrical equipment factory,
"they would scratch their heads and say:
'Isn't it better to have good goulash?"
Khrushchev and Hungarian party leaders
met again, apparently to work out details on
how to counter the increasingly vicious Red
Chinese attacks on Moscow's brand of com
munism and on the Soviet leader himself.
