# KAL Radio Wants FM
## 
### 
KZSU is planning to expand
to FM frequencies soon. Ap
lication for license has proved
no easy task for similar cam
pus radio stations.
Radio station KAL, the
KZSU of Cal. Berkeley, re
cently tried to acquire an FM
license and was thwarted by
the University of California
Board of Regents.
On March 20, Edward Car
ter, Chairman of the board,
questioned the wisdom of
leaving such an operation to
"relatively immature kids."
Carter and other regents
feared that viewpoints ex
pressed over the air might be
taken as the opinions of the
board.
"You know how we can't
control the students' media
of communication." Carter
said "How would you like to
have the same types running
the station that are running
the student newspaper?"
Clark Kerr, President of
the University of California,
supported the students' seek
ing to extend the broadcasts.
"I defend this request very
strongly," Kerr said. "The
students who are interested
in the FM station are engi
neering types, not tin 1 , Daily
Cal types."
KAL, in the meantime, has
merged with the ASUC Ra
dio-TV Theater to form a
larger organization. Whether
the station will receive an FM
license or not is still under
consideration.
