# Revision Of Rush Procedure Planned
## 
### 
Stanford's new rush procedure
may he due for more revision,
possibly within the next two
weeks, the Daily learned recently.
The substance of the proposed
changes has not yet been re

vealed. But according to IFC
President Don Haider, Ihe gen
eral purpose of the impending
revision will be to relieve the ten
sion which at times may exist be
tween the various living groups.
THE PROPOSED alteration of
the present rush policy follows a
series of meetings of the Inter-
Fraternity, Inter-Club a,nd Inner-
House Council Presidents with
with Head Sponsor at Wilbur
Hall.
The discussions were begun in
the middle of this Winter Quarter
with the aim of establishing a
stronger spirit of cooperation
among the various men's living
groups.
SUPPOSEDLY, the representa
tives of the various living groups
have reached agreement on rush
procedures for next year and the
years following. Their recom
mendations had previously been

submitted to the Dean of Stu
dents' office, but they were sub
sequently withdrawn by ASSU
representatives pending other ac
tion.
The studenl legislature is sched
uled to meet one week from today
at which time such action may be
initiated.
THE INTER - FRATERNITY
Council itself will meet next
Monday, and the committee's rec
ommendations for change in the
rush procedure quite possibly
may be revealed to the frater
nities at this time.
Accordnig to Paul Strasburg,
burg, Head Sponsor at Wilbur,
the as yet unrevealed proposals
"go a long way to eliminate some
of the major difficulties of rush
that exist now."
LAST YEAR, the rush period,
both both fraternities and eating
clubs, extended over seven weeks.

This year, in order to relieve some
of ihe pressure, it has born re
duced to four weeks, with the
provise lhat no rush contacts
were to be made during Autumn
Quarter.
Winter Quarter rush contacts
were restricted solely to the area
of the fraternity and eating club
houses themselves.
At present, then, IFC, lITC, ICC,
and Ihe freshmen men's spon
sors have representatives on the
committee which sets the regula
tions.
