♦'PROF. BAKAVS books and

inevitably made him a man of
controversy. Such controversy is
the essence of a virorous intellec
tual life, and we are all dimin
ished by the loss of this warm
hearted and courageous thinker
and teacher."

and his contributions. Dr. Abra
movitz recently stated. "The sud
den tragic death of Paul Baran
represents a distinct loss to social
thought in this country. He was
one of the very few exponents of
Marxism who held an official
place in American academic life.
"As such he helped to keep eco
nomic thought in this country
and other western countries in
contact with an intellectual cur
rent which has shaken the world
and which is the basis of social
analysis over a large section of
the globe.
♦'PROF. BAKAVS books and
articles attracted a very wide
audience in this country and
abroad. His Stanford classes on
economic development were fa
mous. and brought students here
from many countries.
"Stanford students, both gradu
ate and undergraduate, will long
remember the sweep, vitality, and
biting humor which made hi s
lectures unforgettable expo ri
ences.
"Baran was at bottom a fighter
for reason and justice, which he
felt could flourish only under so
cialistic institutions. His forceful
defense of an unpopular position
inevitably made him a man of
controversy. Such controversy is
the essence of a virorous intellec
tual life, and we are all dimin
ished by the loss of this warm
hearted and courageous thinker
and teacher."
