## Rugby Squad Routs Irish To End Season 
### PETER EAKLAND 
The Notre Dame Irish sent an
other athletic team to Stanford
but their ruggers could do no
better than their football team
did in Ihe fall, and thanks to
sparkling season-ending perform*
ances by Gordon Waddell, Dick
Shaw, and Frank Patitucci, Stan
ford routed the defense-minded
midwesterners, 223, Tiips d a y
! afternoon.
Gordon Waddell. playing hi s
last gome at Stanford, contributed
five points to boost his season
total to 107 points, a phenomenal
sum Coach Kmetovie says is the
largest achieved during his coach
ing days and probably in the his
tory of Stanford rugby. Kyrk
Reid, a recent Stanford star, held
! the old mark when he scored 94
| points with a combination of tries
j and placements.
Following Waddell in tho scor-
I ing were Bob Burke (38), Stove
Van Nort (33), Dick Shaw 121),
Clark Weaver (IS), Brad Free
man (15), Glenn Myers (15), and
j Bob Price (12). The offensive
' might ol' the Stanford ruggers is

shown by noting that last year
(ho loading scorer had but 25
points lor the entire season.
Capt. Bob Price began tho scor
ing with a try coming off a scrum
from in close, and Waddell then
converted. Dick Shaw found the
corner for another Indian try,
and then Waddell split the up
rights on a penalty kick to make
the halftime score, 110.
Stanford matched its first half
out put in the second half as Pali
tucci scorcd two tries, Shaw
notched his second of the day on
a long rushing play, and Jon
Brandin made a conversion. Stan
ford played a relaxed half, realiz
ing the Irish would never catch
them.
The Irish from the opening
didn't try to match the Card off
ense. Instead they hung back on
defense and played a kicking

gamo lort by Tom Garlaoher.
Dribbling at which they worn
quite effective was iho main fea
ture of their offense. The strategy
limited its offense but kepi the
score within reasonable bounds.
Notre Dame's Ben Benll in the
closing minutes averted a shut
out by falling on the ball in the
goal area after a good scrum.

didn't try to match the Card off

defense and played a kicking

gamo lort by Tom Garlaoher.
Dribbling at which they worn
quite effective was iho main fea
ture of their offense. The strategy
limited its offense but kepi the
score within reasonable bounds.
Notre Dame's Ben Benll in the
closing minutes averted a shut

goal area after a good scrum.
The Notre Dame Irish sent an
other athletic team to Stanford
but their ruggers could do no
better than their football team
did in Ihe fall, and thanks to
sparkling season-ending perform*
ances by Gordon Waddell, Dick
Shaw, and Frank Patitucci, Stan
ford routed the defense-minded
midwesterners, 223, Tiips d a y
! afternoon.
Gordon Waddell. playing hi s
last gome at Stanford, contributed
five points to boost his season
total to 107 points, a phenomenal
sum Coach Kmetovie says is the
largest achieved during his coach
ing days and probably in the his
tory of Stanford rugby. Kyrk
Reid, a recent Stanford star, held
! the old mark when he scored 94
| points with a combination of tries
j and placements.
Following Waddell in tho scor-
I ing were Bob Burke (38), Stove
Van Nort (33), Dick Shaw 121),
Clark Weaver (IS), Brad Free
man (15), Glenn Myers (15), and
j Bob Price (12). The offensive
' might ol' the Stanford ruggers is

shown by noting that last year
(ho loading scorer had but 25
points lor the entire season.
Capt. Bob Price began tho scor
ing with a try coming off a scrum
from in close, and Waddell then
converted. Dick Shaw found the
corner for another Indian try,
and then Waddell split the up
rights on a penalty kick to make
the halftime score, 110.
Stanford matched its first half
out put in the second half as Pali
tucci scorcd two tries, Shaw
notched his second of the day on
a long rushing play, and Jon
Brandin made a conversion. Stan
ford played a relaxed half, realiz
ing the Irish would never catch
them.
