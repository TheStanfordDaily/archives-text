# KA Leads Mural Crown Chase
## 
### 
Kappa Alpha currently leads
the intramural point parade after
the conclusion of the fall and
winter seasons with 284 points.
But the KAs are being threatened
by a determined El Capitan Club
which scored a record 222 points
during winter quarter to pull to
within eight.
Highlight of the winter pro
gram was the basketball tourney
which the Dolts won by beating
Sigma Chi in a tight 57-54 battle
the Saturday just prior to Dead
Week. The two teams won their
way into the finals by beating the
KAs and Theta Delts.
Capitan achieved its high point
total by winning the Eating Club
basketball league, winning the
University bowling roll-off
against KA and Theta Chi, and
coming in second to Crothers Me
morial in the ping pong tourney.
CroMem, in fifth place overall
with 186 points, also won the
pocket billiards crown in that
event's first year, and Delta Chi
won the wrestling crown.
