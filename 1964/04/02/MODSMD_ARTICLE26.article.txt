# COFO 'THREAT'
## Jackson Arms For Rights Fight 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN Feature Editor 
"We're ready for them," Mayor
Allen Thompson of Jackson, Mis
sissippi, told the New York Times.
"We've got the stuff."
The "them" for whom Mayor
Thompson and company are
ready refers to the influx of stu
dent volunteers expected to kike
part in the Council of Federated
Organizations' summer project,
"Operation Mississippi." COFO,
which includes all civil rights
groups working in the state
NAACP, CORE, SNCC, and the

Southern Chris
tian Leadership
Conference
(SCLC). plans a
massive voter
registration and
education pr o
grit m, vv hi c h
will in clu d e
Freedom Schools,

Community Centers, and research
projects.
The "stuff" which Mayor
Thompson has prepared as a
greeting to the civil rights work
ers is not what would normally
be used to welcome an army of
educators, but, rather, reads like
a list of equipment for a major
battle with a violent and well
equipped enemy.

THE I'KIDU of Mayor Thomp
son's force is a special riot control
car known locally as "Thompson's
Tank." It can carry ten police
men and two drivers. Last year
Mayor Thompson bought 200
shotguns. Fifty more have been
ordered for this year. All patrol
cars carry shotguns loaded with
buckshot. Three trailer trucks
have been converted into paddy
wagons for more efficient trans
porting of demonstrators in large
numbers.
"There's no way for them to
win." Mayor Thompson repeats,
perhaps more to assure himself
than to frighten away already
committed student volunteers.
"We've got all this tremendous
equipment and personnel," he re
minds.
"We aren't going to turn this
city or this state over to intimi
dators or people intent on unlaw
ful actions that will lead to vio
ence," Mayor Thompson declares
from his own "non-violent" stance
of riot control cars and buckshot
loaded shotguns.
★ ★ ★
ONE WONDERS at the fear of
change which must direct all Mr.
Thompson's plans and impede all
rational thought. By the step-up
in military spending for a "one
last stand" battle. Jackson's
mayor seems to aim directly for
a violent race war, a war directed
against workers whose goals of
educating the Negro and register
ing the Negro voter and whose
philosophy of non-violence stand
in sharp contrast to Thompson's
plans for new. bigger and better
weapons of violence. If the Negro,
by his use of militant methods,
alarms the white moderate; per
haps, too, Jackson's extreme
methods may arouse some white
moderates to protest. At any
rate, the contrast becomes gro
tesque when one reads a passage
from a letter written by a COFO
worker. The worker writes of a
law passed by the Mississippi
State Legislature, allowing state
wide curfews at the discretion of
the police, eliminating the neces
sity of search warrants or per
sonal warrants if "there is im
pending danger or violence to
community," and outlawing leaf
let distribution. However the let
ter goes on to mention a "bright
spot." "Yesterday we had 130
people standing quietly in line for
six hours at Canton court house
to register," the letter reads.
"Three bus loads of police with
submachine guns patrolled, but
NO violence. . . . Four of the Ne
groes succeeded in registering!
You see? All we need is time..."

"We're ready for them," Mayor
Allen Thompson of Jackson, Mis
sissippi, told the New York Times.
"We've got the stuff."
The "them" for whom Mayor
Thompson and company are
ready refers to the influx of stu

part in the Council of Federated
Organizations' summer project,
"Operation Mississippi." COFO,
which includes all civil rights
groups working in the state

The "stuff" which Mayor
Thompson has prepared as a
greeting to the civil rights work
ers is not what would normally
be used to welcome an army of
educators, but, rather, reads like
a list of equipment for a major
battle with a violent and well
equipped enemy.

THE I'KIDU of Mayor Thomp
son's force is a special riot control
car known locally as "Thompson's
Tank." It can carry ten police
men and two drivers. Last year
Mayor Thompson bought 200
shotguns. Fifty more have been
ordered for this year. All patrol
cars carry shotguns loaded with
buckshot. Three trailer trucks
have been converted into paddy
wagons for more efficient trans
porting of demonstrators in large
numbers.
"There's no way for them to
win." Mayor Thompson repeats,
perhaps more to assure himself
than to frighten away already
committed student volunteers.
"We've got all this tremendous
equipment and personnel," he re
minds.
"We aren't going to turn this
city or this state over to intimi
dators or people intent on unlaw
ful actions that will lead to vio
ence," Mayor Thompson declares
from his own "non-violent" stance
of riot control cars and buckshot
loaded shotguns.

ONE WONDERS at the fear of
change which must direct all Mr.
Thompson's plans and impede all
rational thought. By the step-up
in military spending for a "one
last stand" battle. Jackson's
mayor seems to aim directly for
a violent race war, a war directed
against workers whose goals of
educating the Negro and register
ing the Negro voter and whose
philosophy of non-violence stand
in sharp contrast to Thompson's
plans for new. bigger and better
weapons of violence. If the Negro,
by his use of militant methods,
alarms the white moderate; per
haps, too, Jackson's extreme
methods may arouse some white
moderates to protest. At any
rate, the contrast becomes gro
tesque when one reads a passage
from a letter written by a COFO
worker. The worker writes of a
law passed by the Mississippi
State Legislature, allowing state
wide curfews at the discretion of
the police, eliminating the neces
sity of search warrants or per
sonal warrants if "there is im
pending danger or violence to
community," and outlawing leaf
let distribution. However the let
ter goes on to mention a "bright
spot." "Yesterday we had 130
people standing quietly in line for
six hours at Canton court house
to register," the letter reads.
"Three bus loads of police with
submachine guns patrolled, but
NO violence. . . . Four of the Ne
groes succeeded in registering!
You see? All we need is time..."
