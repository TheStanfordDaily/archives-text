## LSD Called Illegal, Dangerous By Health Service Director 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
At the present time, the manu
facture, distribution, possession
and use of LSD and other hal
lucinogens (such as psilocybin,
mescolin, morning-glory seeds,
etc.) is legal only in very re
stricted circumstances, that is in
well controlled, objective research
projects approved by National
Institutes of Health and other
recognized grantors. In all other
circumstances it is against Fed
eral Law.
Entriely aside from the legal
aspects, these drugs are poten
tially far too dangerous for cas
ual use or merely curious experi
mentation. The risks of serious
and long-lasting mental break
down are too great, and further
more are unpredictable. A single
dose, even in apparently normal
persons, may produce psychoses,
suicidal depressions, and severe
anxiety reactions which may re
verberate for up to two years.
Even when the reaction to the
drug is "good" — with intense
euphoria, heightened sensation,
a n d varying degrees of cosmic
rapture, I question the value,
or uniqueness of such experience,
which may at times also be ex
perienced by the schizophrenic, by
the patient with general paresis
(a form of brain syphilis,) and
for a while at least, by the user of
heroin.
I cannot discern anything noble
or revelatory in such wholly-in
trapersonal feelings of "aware
nes," however draped in semnatic
robes of "mystical insight," "in
tense religious fervor," "infinity,"
and the like.
Who needs these drugs? Re
sponsible research has not yet
founcl,the answer, and until such
time as it does, they remain both
illegal and dangerous for inde
pendent use. The bad results are
too serious, and the "good" re
sults too often delusory. At pres
ent their only justifiable use is
for throughful, systematic, and
responsible research much of
which will be needed before their
potential, if any. can be evalu
ated.

Quite some time ago, a letter
appeared in your column regard
ing the "indifferent attitude" dis
played by our Student Health
Center, particularly with regard
to foreign students.
Before enrolling at Stanford
last September, I had the plea
sure of attending and graduating
from several other universities. I
would simply like to say that
Stanford's Health Center has been
the most courteous, friendly and
helpful service that 1 have found.
To cite a personal example: Dr.
Maurice Osborne, the Executive
Director, not only answered all
of my medical queries, but fur
ther assisted me by locating an
Obstetrician for my wife and a
Pediatrician for my children. In
doing so he neither "rushed" me
during our conversations nor in
anyway conveyed an attitude
which could be construed as "in
different."
My personal feelings arc ( ha t

Stanford should feel quite proud

• Mixed Housing
Editor, The Daily:
Your readers may be interested
in a recent prelude to the new
policy restricting open houses.
Last quarter many girls endured
a compulsory house meeting at
which house officers presented
arguments against mixed hous
ing.
One argument was that be
cause Stanford women are chosen
more selectively, they would be
lowering themselves to associate
with the men. Other arguments
dealt with the "intellectual con
tent" of dinner conversation of
the two sexes and the preponder
ance of men in elective office in
mixed housing. If there is any
thing more breathtaking than
this fetid snobbery, it was the
speed and silence with which it
was accepted. I hope most girls
took it for what it was: an an
nouncement that the administra
tion had decided against mixed
housing.
The greatest of many contra
dictions in university policy is
'that the "social" decisions of
| women are to be made by each
woman, by Stanford women col
lectively. by the Social Regula
tions Committee, by other organs
of "student government," by the
administration, by the parents, by
American women, and by th e
society, depending on which quote
one chooses. But decisions are
being made in the Dean's Office.
I think that house officers
recognize this when they parrot
for the Dean of Women, . . . that
Kathy Moses (Chairman of the
Social Regulations Committee)
recognized it when she dismissed
innovative proposals be c a us c
"they will never be accepted." (To
Miss Moses I must give credit
for purging the explanation for
the Social Regulations of most of
its suggestive language: now it
just doesn't make sense.)
I do not mean to malign these
girls: I hey are quite correct and
some are extraordinary women.
I Even the Dean of Women, . . .
i was correct when she said that
Stanford women, being more per
missive. will accept abuse: she
has been abusing them all along.

• Mixed Housing
Editor, The Daily:
Your readers may be interested
in a recent prelude to the new
policy restricting open houses.
Last quarter many girls endured
a compulsory house meeting at
which house officers presented
arguments against mixed hous
ing.
One argument was that be
cause Stanford women are chosen
more selectively, they would be
lowering themselves to associate
with the men. Other arguments
dealt with the "intellectual con
tent" of dinner conversation of
the two sexes and the preponder
ance of men in elective office in
mixed housing. If there is any
thing more breathtaking than
this fetid snobbery, it was the
speed and silence with which it
was accepted. I hope most girls
took it for what it was: an an
nouncement that the administra
tion had decided against mixed
housing.
The greatest of many contra
dictions in university policy is
'that the "social" decisions of
| women are to be made by each
woman, by Stanford women col
lectively. by the Social Regula
tions Committee, by other organs
of "student government," by the
administration, by the parents, by
American women, and by th e
society, depending on which quote
one chooses. But decisions are
being made in the Dean's Office.
I think that house officers
recognize this when they parrot
for the Dean of Women, . . . that
Kathy Moses (Chairman of the
Social Regulations Committee)
recognized it when she dismissed
innovative proposals be c a us c
"they will never be accepted." (To
Miss Moses I must give credit
for purging the explanation for
the Social Regulations of most of
its suggestive language: now it
just doesn't make sense.)
I do not mean to malign these
girls: I hey are quite correct and
some are extraordinary women.
I Even the Dean of Women, . . .
i was correct when she said that
Stanford women, being more per
missive. will accept abuse: she
has been abusing them all along.

At the present time, the manu
facture, distribution, possession
and use of LSD and other hal
lucinogens (such as psilocybin,
mescolin, morning-glory seeds,
etc.) is legal only in very re
stricted circumstances, that is in
well controlled, objective research
projects approved by National
Institutes of Health and other
recognized grantors. In all other
circumstances it is against Fed
eral Law.
Entriely aside from the legal
aspects, these drugs are poten
tially far too dangerous for cas
ual use or merely curious experi
mentation. The risks of serious
and long-lasting mental break
down are too great, and further
more are unpredictable. A single
dose, even in apparently normal
persons, may produce psychoses,
suicidal depressions, and severe
anxiety reactions which may re
verberate for up to two years.
Even when the reaction to the
drug is "good" — with intense
euphoria, heightened sensation,
a n d varying degrees of cosmic
rapture, I question the value,
or uniqueness of such experience,
which may at times also be ex
perienced by the schizophrenic, by
the patient with general paresis
(a form of brain syphilis,) and
for a while at least, by the user of
heroin.
I cannot discern anything noble
or revelatory in such wholly-in

and the like.

• Mixed Housing
Editor, The Daily:
Your readers may be interested
in a recent prelude to the new
policy restricting open houses.
Last quarter many girls endured
a compulsory house meeting at
which house officers presented
arguments against mixed hous
ing.
One argument was that be
cause Stanford women are chosen
more selectively, they would be
lowering themselves to associate
with the men. Other arguments
dealt with the "intellectual con
tent" of dinner conversation of
the two sexes and the preponder
ance of men in elective office in
mixed housing. If there is any
thing more breathtaking than
this fetid snobbery, it was the
speed and silence with which it
was accepted. I hope most girls
took it for what it was: an an
nouncement that the administra
tion had decided against mixed
housing.
The greatest of many contra
dictions in university policy is
'that the "social" decisions of
| women are to be made by each
woman, by Stanford women col
lectively. by the Social Regula
tions Committee, by other organs
of "student government," by the
administration, by the parents, by
American women, and by th e
society, depending on which quote
one chooses. But decisions are
being made in the Dean's Office.
I think that house officers
recognize this when they parrot
for the Dean of Women, . . . that
Kathy Moses (Chairman of the
Social Regulations Committee)
recognized it when she dismissed
innovative proposals be c a us c
"they will never be accepted." (To
Miss Moses I must give credit
for purging the explanation for
the Social Regulations of most of
its suggestive language: now it
just doesn't make sense.)
I do not mean to malign these
girls: I hey are quite correct and
some are extraordinary women.
I Even the Dean of Women, . . .
i was correct when she said that
Stanford women, being more per
missive. will accept abuse: she
has been abusing them all along.

At the present time, the manu
facture, distribution, possession
and use of LSD and other hal
lucinogens (such as psilocybin,
mescolin, morning-glory seeds,
etc.) is legal only in very re
stricted circumstances, that is in
well controlled, objective research
projects approved by National
Institutes of Health and other
recognized grantors. In all other
circumstances it is against Fed
eral Law.
Entriely aside from the legal
aspects, these drugs are poten
tially far too dangerous for cas
ual use or merely curious experi
mentation. The risks of serious
and long-lasting mental break
down are too great, and further
more are unpredictable. A single
dose, even in apparently normal
persons, may produce psychoses,
suicidal depressions, and severe
anxiety reactions which may re
verberate for up to two years.
Even when the reaction to the
drug is "good" — with intense
euphoria, heightened sensation,
a n d varying degrees of cosmic
rapture, I question the value,
or uniqueness of such experience,
which may at times also be ex
perienced by the schizophrenic, by
the patient with general paresis
(a form of brain syphilis,) and
for a while at least, by the user of
heroin.
I cannot discern anything noble
or revelatory in such wholly-in
trapersonal feelings of "aware
nes," however draped in semnatic
robes of "mystical insight," "in
tense religious fervor," "infinity,"
and the like.
Who needs these drugs? Re
sponsible research has not yet
founcl,the answer, and until such
time as it does, they remain both
illegal and dangerous for inde
pendent use. The bad results are
too serious, and the "good" re
sults too often delusory. At pres
ent their only justifiable use is
for throughful, systematic, and
responsible research much of
which will be needed before their
potential, if any. can be evalu
