# THE 						RIGHT
## Liberalism A Bankrupt Ideology? 
### DARRYL R. WOLD 
Stanford was treated in the
week before finals to a non-stop
recording of Lord Bert rand Rus
sell telling (he Western world
that principles aren't worth the
price. It is a somewhat piteous
sight to see a great intellect re
i duced to a quivering organism
' fleeing in an animal reflex before
I the possibility of destruction.
Surely this is not the ultimate
achievement in learning, or the
ultimate result if it is, Lord
Bertram! is a somewhat ironical
voice in the center of the Univer-

sity, a voice say
ing that what
we are attempt
ing to learn here
|wi 11 gain us
nothing but the
I wisdom to fear
I most of all for
j our physical
j well-being.

Can a University thriving in a
! free country and in an atmos
phere of free inquiry learn
nothing but to value freedom
least of all?
I do not believe ttiat our high- j
est goal because it is allegedly
j the only attainable goal— is to
preserve mankind's material de
| velopments at the expense of a
I complete abandonment of our
moral achievements, inadequate;
| and tenuous though they may be.'

BUT IT does not even appear
j necessary in practice to choose
; physical survival over principle,
: a choice which is apparently too
(much of a strain for a man of
Lord Bert rand's age, but that is
I another subject — the possibility
of the "other side" launching a
; nuclear attack as long as we are
prepared to counter it has been
rehashed many times.
Admittedly, the idea of giving
up before we're blown up is in our
situation a distinctly minority
viewpoint, although it is either
being repeated by more people or
by the same people oftener than
in the past. But the basic view
point is somewhat symptomatic,
I think, of modern Liberalism,
and is a demonstration of that
ideology's incompetence to serve
Americans as a political or a
moral philosophy.
The Liberal Papers, a series of
essays bv noted Liberals attempt
ing to "formulate a philosophy
behind Liberal reform in gen
eral," is a case in point. What
moves Harvard professor David
Riesman to say that "As the cold
war continues, it becomes increas
ingly difficult for decent Ameri
cans, humane enough to prefer
peace to an egocentrical national
honor, to be outspoken and genu
inely anti-Communist"?
As Congressman James Roose
velt said as editor of this "work,"
it was an attempt "to formulate
| a program . . . responsive to our
obligations as a great power and
a free society."
That result may be Congress
man Roosevelt's idea of our obli
gations, but I would say that the
greatest moral demand of the
twentieth century is to oppose
Communism; it is to extend lib
erty and not merely the material
benefits we have reaped from it.

YET ASSISTANT Secretary
of State Harland Cleveland de
fines our "grand design" of for
eign policy as a "many-sided ef
fort ... to make the non-Com
munist world hum with the cheer
ful and contagious sounds of suc
cess, and thereby subvert the
Communist world by demonstrat
ing that free choice works better,
and feels better, than coercion."
Is that, the best an official can
do in the way of formulating an
American answer to Commu
nism? Are we to oppose mi alien
ideology solely with an attempt
at greater material success?
Is Liberalism both without prin-1
ciple in theory and incompetent i
in practice to pose an effective}
alternative to Communist aggres-i
sion? Whitney Griswold said, "It ,
is no more possible to conduct
affairs of state without reference
to political philosophy than it is
to do business without money." '
If the currency is debauched,
though, the business will still fail.
Can we not make the basic value j
judgment that our system is*
| worth preserving, and then re-j
i solve to preserve it?
With Senator Goldwater 1 ask,
"Why not victory?," victory fori
j our principles, for the future well !
being of mankind. This is our
' greatest responsibility.

i solve to preserve it?
With Senator Goldwater 1 ask,
"Why not victory?," victory fori

being of mankind. This is our
' greatest responsibility.
