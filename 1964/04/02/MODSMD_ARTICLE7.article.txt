# Physicists Renovate Linear Accelerator
## 
### JAMES BRISCOE 
The Stanford High Energy Physics Laboratory has recently
completed the rebuilding of its linear electron accelerator using
a number of SLAC components.
Although the energy level of the machine has been only slightly
increased, from approximately 1 billion electron volts (bevs) to

1.05 bevs, a number of other very*
important improvements have
been added, according to Dr.
Harry Wilson, Research Physicist
at the laboratory.
THE PHASE stability of the
machine has been greatly im
proved and the current or num
ber of electrons in each "shot" has
been almost doubled. The radia
tion shielding of the accelerator !
has been increased to give added
protection to the operator, Dr.
Wilson reported.
THE 200 FT. long linear accele
rator, located in the W. W. Han
sen Laboratory behind the Wom
en's Gym, is very similar except
for length to the two mile long
Project M accelerator.
It was therefore possible to use
the same pipe being built for

►
SLAC lo reconstruct the 200 ft.
tube through which the electrons
are accelerated. As a result of
this, it was possible to rebuild the
accelerator at a minimum cost
and at the same time provide a
test bed for the SLAC tubing.
The accelerator was built in
1954. and for a number of years
was one of (he most powerful ac
celerators in the world. Accord
ing to Dr. Wilson it is still a very
valuable machine as il operates
in a power range which is im
portant in the study of the basic
structure of matter.
DR. ROBERT HOFSTADTKR,
one of the Senior Research Pro
fessors in the laboratory, was
awarded the Nobel Prize in
Physics in 1901 for his work in
this field.
