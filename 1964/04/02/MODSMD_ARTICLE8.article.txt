"The Republican Party," he said, "will have a major decision to

(With a positive progressive view
| or whether we are to drift into
the side eddies and let the main
stream pass us by."

stream" of American life. He in
tends. he says, to provide the Re
publican Party with program to

"The issues in the Republican
primary in California and in the
campaign in the fall." the Cover
; nor said, "must be fully discussed
|so that the party can come up
with constructive solutions to
! problems not solved during the
I past 3!s years."

"They do not grasp that the
United Nations is more than a
mere structural blend of steel and
concrete and glass along New
York's East River—that it is more
than a place where one sees
strange robes and hears strange
words," he said.
"IT IS A SYMBOL of the
hopes, of the aspirations, of t he
faith in peace and in the future
. . . for all men of all colors, of
all creeds, of all races, it is the
symbol of optimism."
