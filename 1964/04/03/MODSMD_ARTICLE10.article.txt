# Union Walkout Threatens KPFA: Warring Leaders To Meet At SU
## 
### 
For nearly two weeks now. KPFA. the Bay
Area's only non-profit, non-commercial, subscriber
supported radio station, has been crippled by a
National Association of Broadcast Employees and
Technicians Union (NABETi walkout which
threatens to force the station off the air perman
ently.
THK KKSUI/r of the dispute is a virtual sus
pension of communication between two groups
who claim absolute devotion to the interests of
KPFA and the cause of free radio broadcasting.
Immediate hope for resolution of the conflict, lies
in a confrontation of the warring parties scheduled
for next Wednesday evening at 8:30 in Stanford's
Tresidder Union. At this time. Trevor Thomas.
KPFA Station manager, will meet in a panel dis
cussion with Jack Messel. alternate shop steward
of the union and KPFA Drama and Literature Di
rector.
The panel discussion is nominally sponsored by
the ASSU Political Union, but the real force be
hind the meeting is a naccnt group presently
headed by History Graduate student Emily Good
man and destined to be known as the Stanford
Commit tee for KPFA.
Mrs. Goodman imagines the group will be small
in si/.e but large in enthusiasm, and she sets the
goals of the organization accordingly: 1 • to stimu
late interest in KPFA within the Stanford Com
munity and 2» to channel volunteer participation
in KPFA broadcasts themselves.
KPFA HAS long relied heavily on volunteer
help and during the present strike the availability
of such hell) has become crucial to the existence

of the station. Indeed, the use of volunteer .stall'
members appears to be at least one of the issues
involved in the union-management conflict. The
trouble at KPFA, however, is more complicated
than overt union demands and flat management
refusals and. seemingly, has been brewing in the
form of intra-staff tensions for a long period.
In January of this year. KPFA was organized
by the NAB FT. and, initially, union membership
was virtually unanimous. However, in subsequent
weeks, many staff members withdrew from the
union because of its alleged dictatorial directorship
and lack of concern with their interests. Thus the
union retained a bare majority of the KPFA staff,
all of which apparently led Station Manager Trev
or Thomas to doubt either the advisability or popu
larity of the union movement under the free
broadcasting scheme.
The current crisis errupted on January 11 when
Thomas fired Director Elsa Knight Thompson, a
union member, on what the union deemed insuf
ficient grounds. After a long hassle the firing was
.sustained by the Paeifica Board, and the union
walked out in indignant protest.
KPFA CONTINUES operation at present,
manned by the remaining paid staff and numbers
of volunteer workers. However, all attempts at
mediation have proved fruitless amid a flurry ol
charges and countercharges.
So. the strike continues, much to the chagrin
and displeasure of numbers of KPFA subscribers
who insist that if both groups are really so firm in
their committments to the interests of KPFA and
free radio broadcasting, then a solution can and
must be reached lest the station fade into oblivion.
