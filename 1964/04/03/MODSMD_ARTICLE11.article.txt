been associated with Stanford-in-

Overseas Program.
LeMoal originally came into
contact with Stanford when uni

Tours in search of a location for
the proposed French Center. At
this time the American Cultural
Center asked LeMoal to take part

in the negociations.
Shortly alter, LeMoal left for
Yale to do some research in 18th
century English literature on a
Fulbright grant. He came to Cali

puses Director Robert Walker
and accepted the post of directol
of French studies at the center
In September 1961, he became
director of the entire Tours pro
gram.
