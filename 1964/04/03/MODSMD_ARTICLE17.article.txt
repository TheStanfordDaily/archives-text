# Are You An Unemployed Christian?
## 
### 
Maybe you are one of the many Christians-in-hiding who accupy a niche in
the world, but are "Christian incognito" as far as your friends are concerned.
You can't possibly be a happy Christian sitting on the sidelines. God has intended
your life to be dynamic and victorious for Him. There is certainly plenty of work
to be done and few workers to do it. The world population presently stands at
about 3,138,361,000 souls whose religious affiliations are approximately as follows:
Roman Catholic 18.2% Shinto 2.5%
Eastern Orthodox 4.5% Taoists 1.6%
Protestant 7.0% Confucian 10.9%
Jewish 0.4% Buddhists 5.0%
Muslim 14.2% Hindus 12.2%
Others or none 23.1%
As you can see, this doesn't add up to very many Christians, particularly as
the figures include many professing Christians who are not spiritually born-of-God,
and hence do not belong to Christ. Each year millions are perishing without hope
and without Jesus Christ.
"For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same
Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon
the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call upon him whom
they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him whom they have not
heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach,
except they Ik- sent? As it is written. How beautiful are the feet of them that
preach the gospel of peace, and brinj: glad tidings of good things!" (Romans
10:12-15)
Coming out in the open and going to work for Christ is putting faith into
action. "Hut without faith it is impossible to please Him . . ." (Heb. 11:6)
The primary job of the Christian is to tell others about Jesus Christ. The
day you became a Christian, the day you were saved, you also became a mission
ary for Jesus Christ, and your friends around you became you own mission field.
Are y< u telliiiK them about your Saviour and Redeemer? Are you concerned for
t'i rn ? Are you interceding for them in prayer?
V. n may not have met many spiritual Christians, but they do exist; and there
i - veral spiritually strong churches in this area. If you are an unemployed
Christian, we'd love to help you find a job in the Service of the Kint;.

the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call upon him whom
they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him whom they have not
heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach,
except they Ik- sent? As it is written. How beautiful are the feet of them that
preach the gospel of peace, and brinj: glad tidings of good things!" (Romans
10:12-15)
Coming out in the open and going to work for Christ is putting faith into
action. "Hut without faith it is impossible to please Him . . ." (Heb. 11:6)
The primary job of the Christian is to tell others about Jesus Christ. The
day you became a Christian, the day you were saved, you also became a mission
ary for Jesus Christ, and your friends around you became you own mission field.
Are y< u telliiiK them about your Saviour and Redeemer? Are you concerned for

Maybe you are one of the many Christians-in-hiding who accupy a niche in
the world, but are "Christian incognito" as far as your friends are concerned.
You can't possibly be a happy Christian sitting on the sidelines. God has intended
your life to be dynamic and victorious for Him. There is certainly plenty of work
to be done and few workers to do it. The world population presently stands at
about 3,138,361,000 souls whose religious affiliations are approximately as follows:
Roman Catholic 18.2% Shinto 2.5%
Eastern Orthodox 4.5% Taoists 1.6%
Protestant 7.0% Confucian 10.9%
Jewish 0.4% Buddhists 5.0%
Muslim 14.2% Hindus 12.2%
Others or none 23.1%
As you can see, this doesn't add up to very many Christians, particularly as
the figures include many professing Christians who are not spiritually born-of-God,
and hence do not belong to Christ. Each year millions are perishing without hope
and without Jesus Christ.
"For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same
Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon
the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call upon him whom
they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him whom they have not
heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach,
except they Ik- sent? As it is written. How beautiful are the feet of them that
