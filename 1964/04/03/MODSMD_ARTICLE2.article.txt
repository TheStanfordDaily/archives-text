### 
An "informal ad hoc" faculty
religion committee was formed
!by President Wallace Sterling
about two months ago the Daily
j learned this week.
THE COMMITTEE was formed
| to appraise and study what might
; be done to improve the religious
| program at Stanford, and to in
; vestigate what will be done with
I a large gift of about one million
! dollars which was given to the
â–  University for religious work.
The current membership of the
committee includes Professor
Robert J. Wert, vice provost of
Ihe University, Professor Eric
j Hutchinson, Prof esso r John
I Dodds, and Professor Richard Ly
man. However. Wert, who is act
ing chairman while Sterling is ill,
told the Daily that the member
ship of the committee is not per
manent and could be augmented.
"The deliniations of the prob
lems are clear, but the solutions
J are complex, and that's what we
are working on now," said Wert.
I The committee has had only one
meeting, but will probably re
sume working shortly in the ab-
S sence of the president. However,
a final report is not expected for
j some lime, probably during next
fall quarter.
The Committee will concern it-
I self entirely with the religious
: program connected with Memo
j rial Church and will be completely
; non-academic in scope, Wert said.
