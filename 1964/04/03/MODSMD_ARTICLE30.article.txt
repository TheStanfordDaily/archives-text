# Injury-Ridden Trackmen Meet Powerful Oregon
## 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
In the wake of last week's
defeat by San Jose State, coach
Payton Jordan tomorrow a ft e r
noon sends an injury-riddled
track team out against Bill Bow
erman's powerhouse from th o
university of Oregon.
Jordan, disappointed by hi s
team's dismal showing last week,
and by the injuries some of his
men came up with after they had
been beaten, has decided not to
run any man who has any sem
blance of an injury. This means
that defending AAWU champ Bob
Miltz will not run the 880, Weym
Kirkland and Harry MeCalla will
not perform in their two-mile spe
cialty. and Rich Chesarek and
Rich Hammen will not run in the
sprints and mile relay.
GUTTY co-captain Steve Cort
right, still bothered by the bad leg
that prevented him from running
his high hurdle specialty last
week, is a doubtful starter in the
intermediate hurdles and the

triple jump. Cortright won the
intermediates and took second in
the triple jump last Saturday.
Oregon has a power-laden team
this season, one with as much, if
not more potential than the one
that beat Stanford at Eugene last
season and went on to finish third
in the NCAA meet one point be
hind the Tribe.
But even without the perform
ers named above, including Cort
right, the Daily scratch sheet on
the meet lists the probable score
as 76-70 in favor of the Redskins,
while coach Jordan's prognostica
tion is 71-71 in his team's favor.
ORLGON WILL be led into ac
tion by Harry Jerome, the great
British Empire sprint champion
from North Vancouver, B.C. In
his last season in Webfoot togs,
1962, Jerome posted 9.2 and 20.7
marks. The big Duck did not com
pete last year while recuperating
from a pulled thigh muscle sus
tained in the British Empire
Games 200 meter dash. Dave
Blunt, a 9.4 man in the 100 gives
Bowerman a lot of depth in the

sprints.
The Webfoots don't give very
much away in the mile either.
Archie San Romani Jr., son of the
former Kansas great, has a 4:04.7
to his credit already this season
and should win this event in a
cakewalk, as Jordan plans to hold
Paul Schlicke out for the two
mile. Still, Harlan Andrews and
Dave Deubner sho u 1 d have
enough to beat anyone else Bow
erman puts in the mile.
BKSIDKS those track events,
Oregon is quite strong in the field
events. It has two 15 plus vaulters
in Gerry Moro and Sam Whitney,
the first 7-foot high jumper in
Oregon history in Paul Stuber.
whose best this season is 6-10,
three fine javelin thowers w ho
should sweep their event in Les
Tipton, Gary Reddaway and Ron
Gomez, and a good and consistent
55-foot shot put tor in Jerry Lar
son.
Starting time for the meet Sat
urday in Stanford Stadium is 1:30
for field events and 2 o'clock for
running events. Admission is a
dollar for students and two for
the general public.

Blunt, a 9.4 man in the 100 gives
Bowerman a lot of depth in the

The Webfoots don't give very

Archie San Romani Jr., son of the

to his credit already this season
and should win this event in a
cakewalk, as Jordan plans to hold
Paul Schlicke out for the two

enough to beat anyone else Bow
erman puts in the mile.

In the wake of last week's
defeat by San Jose State, coach
Payton Jordan tomorrow a ft e r
noon sends an injury-riddled
track team out against Bill Bow
erman's powerhouse from th o
university of Oregon.
Jordan, disappointed by hi s
team's dismal showing last week,
and by the injuries some of his
men came up with after they had
been beaten, has decided not to
run any man who has any sem
blance of an injury. This means
that defending AAWU champ Bob
Miltz will not run the 880, Weym
Kirkland and Harry MeCalla will
not perform in their two-mile spe
cialty. and Rich Chesarek and
Rich Hammen will not run in the
sprints and mile relay.
GUTTY co-captain Steve Cort
right, still bothered by the bad leg
that prevented him from running
his high hurdle specialty last
week, is a doubtful starter in the
intermediate hurdles and the

triple jump. Cortright won the
intermediates and took second in
the triple jump last Saturday.
Oregon has a power-laden team
this season, one with as much, if
not more potential than the one
that beat Stanford at Eugene last
season and went on to finish third
in the NCAA meet one point be
hind the Tribe.
But even without the perform
ers named above, including Cort
right, the Daily scratch sheet on
the meet lists the probable score
as 76-70 in favor of the Redskins,
while coach Jordan's prognostica
tion is 71-71 in his team's favor.
ORLGON WILL be led into ac
tion by Harry Jerome, the great
British Empire sprint champion
from North Vancouver, B.C. In
his last season in Webfoot togs,
1962, Jerome posted 9.2 and 20.7
marks. The big Duck did not com
