# Paul Baran: A Great, Free, Liberal Patient Man
## Editorial 
### 
"What a great, tree, liberal and patient
country we have," the Long Beach inde
pendent wrote on January 23, 1963. "Where
is another whose universities would hire a
Marxian Socialist as an economics professor
and offer him a forum in which to compare
the nation unfavorably, and erroneously,
with its deadly enemies?
"The particular Marxist we have in mind
is Prof. Paul A. Baran of Stanford, who ap
peared on a foreign policy critique program
the other day at the University ot California
at Los Angeles.
WHAT A GREAT, free, liberal and pa
tient man he was. W here is another who

would stand so forthriglitlv for what lie be
lieved, in this nation of free speech?
Words cannot describe a man, any man,
and not least Paul Baran. But we try, and
the words most heard about Baran have a
clear ring to them.
He was a free man, not only in his cour
age to speak when he knew he would be
accused bv someone for something, but in
his ability to remain free. To be a Marxist
in America is easier than to be a capitalist
in the Soviet Union, but not much easier.
For pressure and invective and hate and
lies can destroy as surely as the police.
BUT PAUL BARAN was able to resist

these pressures. His wit, perspective and in
telligence are legend at Stanford, and his
lectures and seminars were among the most
popular, entertaining and educational off
ered at the University.
Professor Baran is dead. He died ot a
heart attack during the week of spring break.
His loss to his family and colleagues, his
loss to us as students, is incalculable.
Where is another who will stand so forth
right Iv for what he believes?
