It was a sad sight. His own New York
State Legislature had clobbered three of bis
main bills, the Gallup Poll showed he had
the support of only 6 per cent of the GOP's
1,840 county chairmen, the California Re
publican Assembly and Young Republicans
had overwhelmingly endorsed Goldwater,
and — then, of course — there was that chilly
New Hampshire primary.
BUT NELSON ROCKEFELLER put on
a valiant performance ;it Memorial Audito
rium Wednesday. And we could not help
but be impressed with the sheer tcuacit\ of

the man.
As lie pleaded — in an almost desperate,
pitiful rasp — that the Republican Party
move itself into "the mainstream ot Ameri
can life with a positive, progressive view,"
we realized the awesome task that lay before
him.
It is, indeed, a fortunate nation that has
men like Rockefeller — and, for that matter,
the late President — who are willing to en
dure the monumental ingratitude and rigors
of public service, when the) could easil)
lead a wealthy private life.
We have nothing but the utmost respect
for the governor of New York.
