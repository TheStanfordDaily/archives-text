## Belly Dancing At Cal; A Matter Of Propriety 
### Ford Burkhart 
We'll wager that the last word hasn't been said about the
exotic dancer reported]) hired by an officer of the freshman class
at Berkeley to dance in a University of California ballroom.
That old cliche about "there's a time and a place for every
thing might be an appropriate frame of reference for these re
marks.
The San Francisco Chronicle in a front page story yesterday
predicted that Tahia Sirhan, a belly dancer from North Beach,
would perform at a dance in the Berkeley student union building
on April 17.
Not only has she been hired, but apparently the University
has appro\ ed.
The Chronicle story said that this unlikely event had received
the official approval of the University through the Dean of Stu
dents. katherine Towlc.
Mrs. Towlc was quoted as saying that "discreet inquiries ' had
been made into the nature of the act.
We'll bet that no official of the University took in one of her
shows at the smoke-filled Bagdad Cafe, an atmospheric tourist
trap in the "tenderloin section on Broadway.

HER ACT IS WILD, powerful!) erotic, and rather amusing
if you remain detached. When we stopped in out of curiosity last
fall, Tahia proved to be everything a "Little Egypt" should be.
It was different, anyway.
So we're not against belly-dancing as such.
But perhaps our point of view was best summed up by a Stan
lord student who commented, "1 would hope that Stanford stu
dents could find some better way to flaunt authority.
"It does seem rather incongruous to imagine a belly dancer per
forming in Tresiddcr. Imagine what President Sterling would
think.
Although the Berkeley administration was understandably dis
turbed by the thought of Miss Sirhans appearance on campus,
they probably took the path of least resistance by approving.
Perhaps this way they avoided pro\ iding a cause for demon
strations on behalf of Freedom of Expression, although its difficult
to imagine even Cal intellectuals fighting for campus belly dancing.
They probably nodded tacit approval, crossed their fingers
that nothing too serious would result, and tried not to think about
it.

PEIUIAPS AFTER A second thought, the administration might
reconsider their decision. But the word's out now, and if anyone
feels like reacting indignantly, he will do so.
Most people are all in favor ol lusty good times at a few all
campus events. Goodness knows Stanford could use more now
and then.
Orgiatic exhibitions are one thing in an North Beach eabcrct,
or in Tijuana. In a student union, its something else.
Perhaps no one else is bothered by it all. We feel a few deci
sions were made in poor taste this week up at Berkeley.
There will probably be a good crowd at the dance, but only
at a high price in terms of esteem and respect. And we'll bet
the last word hasn't been said about it all.
