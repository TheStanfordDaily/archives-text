# Rushing By Draw Based Entirely On Chance

Editor, The Daily:
Each year at this time anti-rush
articles, full of sound and fury,
appear in the Daily. The tenor
and content of Mr. Gillam's col
umn are typical.
Gillam contends that skill in
communication is a trival attri
bute compared to "character, mo
tivation, depth of feeling, genuine
interest, and the like." I agree it
is important to assess a prospec
tive member's character, depth of
feeling, "and the like." but how
is one to determine their presence
when a person cannot communi
cate them? If he's locked up in
his room having a deep feeling,
that's not going to add much to
my educational experience, is it
now?
ness is often a legacy of rush."
Yet at the beginning of this same
sect ion he insists that "a fresh
man usually accepts a bid without
any true understanding of the
group he is entering, while the
fraternity seldom realizes what
type of individual it is pledging."
If the fraternity and the pledge
seldom really know each other,
how can fraternities select
pledges who are just like them
selves?
This blatant contradiction re
veals two things about Mr. Gil
lam: It his presupposition that
fraternities are populated by con
formists and 21 he is very con
fused and misinformed about how
rush actually operates.
The degree of Mr. Gillam's bias
is further demonstrated by the
frequent appearance of snide im
plications and half-truths in his
article. For instance, his implica
tion that fraternity men main
tain an image; that fraternities
go local because of problems
with the rush system instead of
White-Christian clauses: finally,
the abundance of undocumented
assertions about the rush system
itself.
Considering Mr. Gillam's pas
sionate attack on the rush sys
tem, one might expect he had a
better alternative. He suggests we
abloish the present rush system.
Immediately he leaps t<> the de
fense of this idea with two cogent

arguments: 1> it wouldn't be un
usual; 2) this is the trend in the
Ivy League schools (everybody's
doing it).
Throughout his article, Mr. Gil
lam has been hollering about the
value of the individual; yet these
first two arguments could be the
Conformist's Creed! Mr. Gillam,
where do you stand? Or are you
cleverly appealing to the values
of all those shallow fraternity
men ?
Mr. Gillam's imaginative "solu
tion" is none other than the Stan
ford draw system. You know, just
like the women have now. Of
course, more contact between
freshmen an d upperclassmen
would be necessary; this would
take place at meals and parties.
Freshmen would be allowed to
show up for meals whether in
vited or not.
I suggest a dozen or so of this
year's freshmen test Mr. Gillam's
sincerity by showing up at his eat
ing club at dinnertime for th e
next several weeks. The meals, of
course, will be charged to Mr. Gil
lam's house bill.
Fraternities recognize the de
sirability of expanded contact.
Just this year IFC ruled that
freshmen could be invited to
meals throughout winter quarter;
were it not for limitations im
posed by the Administration,
freshmen would be invited to so
cial functions too.
I question Gillam's assertion
that "the result (of a draw sys
tem) would be a gr eater emphasis
upon the individual . . . (and) the
individual would control his own
actions . . ." Does Mr. Gillam
really believe a system based en
tirely on chance is more likely to
satisfy each individual than one
based on choice? It would be in
teresting to seek the opinions of
Stanford women on this subject.
One fact completely exposes
Mr. Gillam's fantasies about the
rush system: If isn't perfect, but
it works. If it didn't, fhe rush
system would have been aban
doned long ago.

• Drury Speech
Kilitor, The Daily:
I was present when Allen Drury
delivered his "Alumni of Ihe
Year" address to a large and
mainly sympathetic audience. Mr
Drury, who graduated from Stan
ford in journalism, is also one
heck of a philosopher and politi
cal analyst, as it turns out (not
so surprising, considering he has
been "nationally syndicated." and
has written a best-seller and two
sequels. >
After a few minutes spent in
ehronicaling the foibles of our
political leaders, Mr. Drury struck
boldly at the very heart of the
sickness which afflicts our Re
public: "America is playing the
game of let's pretend," and re
fuses to face up unblinking to
the stern realities of the modern
world."
This is very strange, too, since
Mr. Drury's stern realities are
that we are the finest, cleanest,
strongest, best-smelling, and most
reasonable nation on the face of
the globe, and if we would just
"stand our ground and live up to
our principles," we would cer
tainly prevail, or at least die try
ing.
But what can you and I, ordi
nary Fred Alumnus, do to help
stem the riptide that threatens to
swamp our ship of state? First of
all, support th e constitution,
which is a great document. Sec
ondly, and most important, don't
see "Dr. Strangelove," because it
"pictures the American President
as a ninny." The President of the
United States is not a ninny. If he
were he wouldn't be president, for
such is the genius of the Ameri
can political dream.
Mr. Drury is a fine and hand
sonic gentleman. If he were a
painter he would be Walter
Keane. If he were a medicine, he
would be clcvasll. If he were
Barry Goldwater. nobody would
notice the difference. And while
I'm at it. ;i doff of the old fedora

Each year at this time anti-rush
articles, full of sound and fury,
appear in the Daily. The tenor
and content of Mr. Gillam's col
umn are typical.
Gillam contends that skill in
communication is a trival attri
bute compared to "character, mo
tivation, depth of feeling, genuine
interest, and the like." I agree it
is important to assess a prospec
tive member's character, depth of
feeling, "and the like." but how
is one to determine their presence
when a person cannot communi
cate them? If he's locked up in
his room having a deep feeling,
that's not going to add much to
my educational experience, is it
now?
ness is often a legacy of rush."
Yet at the beginning of this same
sect ion he insists that "a fresh
man usually accepts a bid without
any true understanding of the
group he is entering, while the
fraternity seldom realizes what
type of individual it is pledging."
If the fraternity and the pledge
seldom really know each other,
how can fraternities select
pledges who are just like them
selves?
This blatant contradiction re
veals two things about Mr. Gil
lam: It his presupposition that
fraternities are populated by con
formists and 21 he is very con
fused and misinformed about how
rush actually operates.
The degree of Mr. Gillam's bias
is further demonstrated by the
frequent appearance of snide im
plications and half-truths in his
article. For instance, his implica
tion that fraternity men main
tain an image; that fraternities
go local because of problems
with the rush system instead of
White-Christian clauses: finally,
the abundance of undocumented
assertions about the rush system
itself.
Considering Mr. Gillam's pas
sionate attack on the rush sys
tem, one might expect he had a
better alternative. He suggests we
abloish the present rush system.
Immediately he leaps t<> the de
fense of this idea with two cogent

arguments: 1> it wouldn't be un
usual; 2) this is the trend in the
Ivy League schools (everybody's
doing it).
Throughout his article, Mr. Gil
lam has been hollering about the
value of the individual; yet these
first two arguments could be the
Conformist's Creed! Mr. Gillam,
where do you stand? Or are you
cleverly appealing to the values
of all those shallow fraternity
men ?
Mr. Gillam's imaginative "solu
tion" is none other than the Stan
ford draw system. You know, just
like the women have now. Of
course, more contact between
freshmen an d upperclassmen
would be necessary; this would
take place at meals and parties.
Freshmen would be allowed to
show up for meals whether in
vited or not.
I suggest a dozen or so of this
year's freshmen test Mr. Gillam's
sincerity by showing up at his eat
ing club at dinnertime for th e
next several weeks. The meals, of
course, will be charged to Mr. Gil
lam's house bill.
Fraternities recognize the de
sirability of expanded contact.
Just this year IFC ruled that
freshmen could be invited to
meals throughout winter quarter;
were it not for limitations im
posed by the Administration,
freshmen would be invited to so
cial functions too.
I question Gillam's assertion
that "the result (of a draw sys
tem) would be a gr eater emphasis
upon the individual . . . (and) the
individual would control his own
actions . . ." Does Mr. Gillam
really believe a system based en
tirely on chance is more likely to
satisfy each individual than one
based on choice? It would be in
teresting to seek the opinions of
Stanford women on this subject.
One fact completely exposes
Mr. Gillam's fantasies about the

it works. If it didn't, fhe rush
system would have been aban

• Drury Speech
Kilitor, The Daily:
I was present when Allen Drury
delivered his "Alumni of Ihe
Year" address to a large and
mainly sympathetic audience. Mr
Drury, who graduated from Stan
ford in journalism, is also one
heck of a philosopher and politi
cal analyst, as it turns out (not
so surprising, considering he has
been "nationally syndicated." and
has written a best-seller and two
sequels. >
After a few minutes spent in
ehronicaling the foibles of our
political leaders, Mr. Drury struck
boldly at the very heart of the
sickness which afflicts our Re
public: "America is playing the
game of let's pretend," and re
fuses to face up unblinking to
the stern realities of the modern
world."
This is very strange, too, since
Mr. Drury's stern realities are
that we are the finest, cleanest,
strongest, best-smelling, and most
reasonable nation on the face of
the globe, and if we would just
"stand our ground and live up to
our principles," we would cer
tainly prevail, or at least die try
ing.
But what can you and I, ordi
nary Fred Alumnus, do to help
stem the riptide that threatens to
swamp our ship of state? First of
all, support th e constitution,
which is a great document. Sec
ondly, and most important, don't
see "Dr. Strangelove," because it
"pictures the American President
as a ninny." The President of the
United States is not a ninny. If he
were he wouldn't be president, for
such is the genius of the Ameri
can political dream.
Mr. Drury is a fine and hand
sonic gentleman. If he were a
painter he would be Walter
Keane. If he were a medicine, he
would be clcvasll. If he were
Barry Goldwater. nobody would
notice the difference. And while

articles, full of sound and fury,
appear in the Daily. The tenor
and content of Mr. Gillam's col
umn are typical.
Gillam contends that skill in
communication is a trival attri
bute compared to "character, mo
tivation, depth of feeling, genuine
interest, and the like." I agree it
is important to assess a prospec
tive member's character, depth of
feeling, "and the like." but how
is one to determine their presence
when a person cannot communi
cate them? If he's locked up in
his room having a deep feeling,
that's not going to add much to
my educational experience, is it
now?
ness is often a legacy of rush."
Yet at the beginning of this same
sect ion he insists that "a fresh
man usually accepts a bid without
any true understanding of the
group he is entering, while the
fraternity seldom realizes what
type of individual it is pledging."
If the fraternity and the pledge
seldom really know each other,
how can fraternities select
pledges who are just like them
selves?
This blatant contradiction re
veals two things about Mr. Gil
lam: It his presupposition that
fraternities are populated by con
formists and 21 he is very con
fused and misinformed about how
rush actually operates.
The degree of Mr. Gillam's bias
is further demonstrated by the
frequent appearance of snide im
plications and half-truths in his
article. For instance, his implica
tion that fraternity men main
tain an image; that fraternities
go local because of problems
with the rush system instead of
White-Christian clauses: finally,
the abundance of undocumented
assertions about the rush system
itself.
Considering Mr. Gillam's pas
sionate attack on the rush sys
tem, one might expect he had a
better alternative. He suggests we
abloish the present rush system.
Immediately he leaps t<> the de
fense of this idea with two cogent

arguments: 1> it wouldn't be un
usual; 2) this is the trend in the
Ivy League schools (everybody's
doing it).
Throughout his article, Mr. Gil
lam has been hollering about the
value of the individual; yet these
first two arguments could be the
Conformist's Creed! Mr. Gillam,
where do you stand? Or are you
cleverly appealing to the values
of all those shallow fraternity
men ?
Mr. Gillam's imaginative "solu
tion" is none other than the Stan
ford draw system. You know, just
like the women have now. Of
course, more contact between
freshmen an d upperclassmen
would be necessary; this would
take place at meals and parties.
Freshmen would be allowed to
show up for meals whether in
vited or not.
I suggest a dozen or so of this
year's freshmen test Mr. Gillam's
sincerity by showing up at his eat
ing club at dinnertime for th e
next several weeks. The meals, of
course, will be charged to Mr. Gil
lam's house bill.
Fraternities recognize the de
sirability of expanded contact.
Just this year IFC ruled that
freshmen could be invited to
meals throughout winter quarter;
were it not for limitations im
posed by the Administration,
freshmen would be invited to so
cial functions too.
I question Gillam's assertion
that "the result (of a draw sys
tem) would be a gr eater emphasis
upon the individual . . . (and) the
individual would control his own
actions . . ." Does Mr. Gillam
really believe a system based en
tirely on chance is more likely to
satisfy each individual than one
based on choice? It would be in
teresting to seek the opinions of
Stanford women on this subject.
One fact completely exposes
Mr. Gillam's fantasies about the
rush system: If isn't perfect, but
it works. If it didn't, fhe rush
system would have been aban
doned long ago.

• Drury Speech
Kilitor, The Daily:
I was present when Allen Drury
delivered his "Alumni of Ihe
Year" address to a large and
mainly sympathetic audience. Mr
Drury, who graduated from Stan
ford in journalism, is also one
heck of a philosopher and politi
cal analyst, as it turns out (not
so surprising, considering he has
been "nationally syndicated." and
has written a best-seller and two
sequels. >
After a few minutes spent in
ehronicaling the foibles of our
political leaders, Mr. Drury struck
boldly at the very heart of the
sickness which afflicts our Re
public: "America is playing the
game of let's pretend," and re
fuses to face up unblinking to
the stern realities of the modern
world."
This is very strange, too, since
Mr. Drury's stern realities are
that we are the finest, cleanest,
strongest, best-smelling, and most
reasonable nation on the face of
the globe, and if we would just
"stand our ground and live up to
our principles," we would cer
tainly prevail, or at least die try
ing.
But what can you and I, ordi
nary Fred Alumnus, do to help
stem the riptide that threatens to
swamp our ship of state? First of
all, support th e constitution,
which is a great document. Sec
ondly, and most important, don't
see "Dr. Strangelove," because it
"pictures the American President
as a ninny." The President of the
United States is not a ninny. If he
were he wouldn't be president, for
such is the genius of the Ameri
can political dream.
Mr. Drury is a fine and hand
