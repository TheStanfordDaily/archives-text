## 'The Silence' Realizes Purity Of Techniques, Expression 
### Foster Hirsch 
"The Silence," the third of Ingniar Bergman's trilogy, con
chides his investigation oi the relationship between modern man
and Cod. 'I he first two films — " Through a Class Darkly, and
"Winter Light" — express a concern with man's attempts to reach
out toward a God who is insensitive to the human situation. Both
films, as well, anticipate "The Silence,' which recreates a universe
in which the presence of God is totally irrelevant.
The silence which exists between man and God is further indi
cative of a silence which, according to Bergman, is the very condi
tion of life.

A WOMAN SUFFERING from an unspecified illness and a
younger sister and her small son interrupt a train trip in order to
allow the sick woman to rest. Their brief sojourn takes place in
an unidentified country which has a strange language they can
not understand. The older sister, a translator, works unsuccess
fully to interpret the new language.
In addition to being removed from the society around tliein,
the sisters are also estranged from each other; the older one, a
lesbian, desires and is in turn taunted and humiliated by her
younger sister. The younger sister, a nymphomaniac, causally
picks up a man and, because of the difference in their languages,
makes love to him in silence.
In his aimless wanderings about the corridors of the baroque
hotel in which the are staying, the small boy meets a group of
grotesquely dressed dwarfs who, like the lesbian and the three
travellers in a country with a strange language, are cut off from
the normal world about them.
Like many modern artists, Bergman is here preoccupied with
man's inability to communicate. His theme, though hardly origi
nal, is given force and vitality by the profundity of his symbolism.
To be sure, his fondness for symbolism gives the film much the
air of a jigsaw puzzle, but the symbols all earn their place in the
story and never reduce the characters to mere things. Though
Bergman observes them with his customary detachment, his char
acters throughout are fully believable as people, and it is their
situation which is of primary interest.

NO T THE LEAST of Bergman s achievement is the splendid
sense of atmosphere and texture which the film evokes. The style
is matchlessly graceful and economical. There is subtlety and ease
in the editing, striking contrasts of light and shadow in the photog
raph), and real skill in the use of natural sounds: a comb running
through hair, music from a distant radio, the ticking of a clock,
the pouring of tea, the soft footsteps of the old waiter, muffled
noises from the street, all take on an existence of their own and
heighten the sense of alienation which exists among the characters.
"The Silence' realizes the purity of technique and expression
lor which Bergman continually strives. The style is stripped of
all excesses (there is no theme music, the cast is small, there is
little dialogue, the slow, precise pace has monumental dignity).
The whole is as grave and solemn as a mass. Bergman utilizes
the potentialities of the cinema as a means for the personal expres
sion of significant ideas. "The Silence" proves conclusively — il
any proof is needed — that he is one of the supreme artists of our
time.
