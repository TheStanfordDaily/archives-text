# Goals Of Students Altered At Stanford
## 
### 
Nine out of ten students
from lower class homes
change t li e i r occupational
aims while they are members
of the "predominantly upper
middle class student body at
Stanford," two sociologists
report.
Only II percent of the low
er class group did not change
their career plans lwtween
freshman and senior years. In
general, the rest raised their
sights to shoot lor better jobs
or professions.
Only half flic middle and
upper class groups, however,
changed their career plans.
One reason for this may be
that students from lower
class homes turn to different
people than those whose ad
vice they relied on in decid
ing lo enter college, suggests
Profs. Kohcrt A. Ellis of the
University of Oregon and YV.
Clayton Lane of San Jose
State.
"Once in college and faced
with the task of choosing an
undergraduate major, s u c h
youths find these earlier in
fluences (parents, relatives,
family friends, and b i g h
school teachers) of little help.
"Hut most of them turn to

college teachers and college
friends for help. Thus their
pattern of outside help and
support parallels their social
development."
Their study has been going
on since 19.">8, when Dr. Ellis
was a member of the Stan
lord faculty and Lane was
working under him for a doc
torate. Support for tlie study
has come from Stanford, the
National Institute of Mental
Health, the Society for the
Investigation of Human Ecol
ogy. and the Social Science
Research Council.
A discovery the investiga
tors didn't expect was that
lower class students "attach
high importance being in an
occupation that will provide
them a sense of self-fulfill
ment â€”a view that stands in
sharp contrast with the usual
approach of the lower class
as meal tickets.
. ."These students have also
come to accept a sense of so
cial ohlgiation in viewing
their occupational careers, at
least to the extent of being
as likely as any Stanford un
dergraduate to feel the job
should give them an oppor
tunity to he helpful to others.
