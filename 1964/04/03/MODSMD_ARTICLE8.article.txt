# AEC Stands Firm On Refusal To Pay For Under grounding
## AEC Chairman Tours SLAC 
### 
Atomic En e r g y Commission
Chairman Glenn T. Seaborg re
iterated yesterday the AEC's re
fusal to pay the entire cost of
underground lines to the Stanford
Linear Accelerator, but left the
way open for "cost-sharing" com
promise proposals by local citi
zens groups fighting overhead
lines.
AFTER TOURING the SLAC
facilities yesterday morning, Sea
borg concluded that the best so
lution would be (to construct)
tubular poles through Woodside.
"These poles," s a i d Seaborg,
"could be put up with as much
aesthetic thought as possible,
painted green to blend with the
countryside, and with a minimum
of cutting away of the under
brush. This would be the most
logical position," he said.
Seaborg pointed out that only
fourteen poles would be needed to
bring the power to the accelera
tor, and that only five of these
would be on Woodside land.
At the same time, Seaborg said
that the AEC, "in a spirit of com
promise," would be willing to ac
cept a single circuit, 180 mega
watt underground line if the local
interests could arrange a com
promise among themselves to put
up the $2.6 million cost. Pacific
Gas and Electric has offered
$1,012,000 and Woodside voted to
quadruple its tax rate to raise
$150,000.
THE AEC previously had in
dicated that, if the line is to be
underground, it will settle for
nothing less than a single icreuit
300 megawatt line, which would
cost $3.6 million.
Seaborg explained that the AEC
could not supply the remaining
$1.4 million needed for the under
ground lines even if it wanted to.
"As a practical matter, it is not
something for the AEC alone to
determine. The legislative history
of the project is such that . . .
authority from Congress is neces
sary to spend this much federal
money."
SEABORG CHARGED the foes
of the overhead lines with failure
to propose meaningful compro
mises. "There has been no change
on the part of the Woodside and
San Mateo County people from

their original position presented j
during the course of negotia-j
tions," he said.
Seaborg claimed that the AEC
lias made many efforts to pro- j
mote an acceptable compromise.
"We will accept far less adequate
facilities than PG&E would fur
nish if the power were to be
brought in on (120-foot) towers;
with dual circuits of 300 mega
watts each. In a spirit of com
promise, to find something better
looking, we have agreed to accept
single tubular poles, which don't
seem to us to be too unsightly." !
SUABOIIG IMI*LIKS that 1 he
Woodside citizens were somewhat
ingrateful for not welcoming the
Linear Accelerator overhead
lines or not. "The Community has
in SLAC a valuable scientific de
velopment one that any other I
part of the country would wel
come. Many sections of the coun
try are vying for the privilege to
carry on such projects, and the
Community should be happy that
such an aspect of science is being
carried on its neighborhood."
Stanford University Vice-Pro
vost Frederick Terman squelched
another "compromise," which
suggested that the line lie under-!
grounded until it .reaches the
Stanford campus, after which
"Stanford could do with it what
they will."
TUBMAN SAID that this alter
native has never been formally
presented to I he Trustees, butl
that "the? Trustees would object :
to such a reverse discrimination
policy. The Trustees have held
the position that lines should be
underground on Stanford land if
possible." but "in this case it is
so expensive that we believe it
would be unfeasible."
TISi; nrci'ART.MKNT ol Justice
has already filed proceeding to
condemn the land needed for the
overhead lines.
Following Seaborg's press con
ference a Redwood City Tribune
reporter demanded of Terman
how Stanford can justify not i
contributing to the underground
lines.
"The University accepted the!
accelerator on a no-gain, no-loss |
basis," said Terman.
Till*: Kliimoon cm news
man then charged that the Uni
versity should have considered
the additional co.si at the begin
ning of the project, and claimed!
1 ha I"the University had tor
pedoed thi.s entire project by re
fusing to put up any funds."
"Why aren't you willing to put
up any money," he demanded.!
That's what luis blocked this

whole thing."
The University's official posi
tion is one of favoring under
ground lines, but not high power
lines because of their prohibitive
cost."The University cannot
justify the use of its educational
funds, received mainly from stu
dent tuition and private gifts, to
support a national research fa
cility." said a recent Trustee's
statement.

THE AEC previously had in
dicated that, if the line is to be
underground, it will settle for
nothing less than a single icreuit
300 megawatt line, which would
cost $3.6 million.
Seaborg explained that the AEC
could not supply the remaining
$1.4 million needed for the under
ground lines even if it wanted to.
"As a practical matter, it is not
something for the AEC alone to
determine. The legislative history
of the project is such that . . .
authority from Congress is neces
sary to spend this much federal
money."
SEABORG CHARGED the foes
of the overhead lines with failure
to propose meaningful compro
mises. "There has been no change
on the part of the Woodside and
San Mateo County people from

their original position presented j
during the course of negotia-j
tions," he said.
Seaborg claimed that the AEC
lias made many efforts to pro- j
mote an acceptable compromise.
"We will accept far less adequate
facilities than PG&E would fur
nish if the power were to be
brought in on (120-foot) towers;
with dual circuits of 300 mega
watts each. In a spirit of com
promise, to find something better
looking, we have agreed to accept
single tubular poles, which don't
seem to us to be too unsightly." !

Woodside citizens were somewhat
ingrateful for not welcoming the

lines or not. "The Community has
in SLAC a valuable scientific de

part of the country would wel
come. Many sections of the coun
try are vying for the privilege to
carry on such projects, and the
Community should be happy that
such an aspect of science is being
carried on its neighborhood."
Stanford University Vice-Pro
vost Frederick Terman squelched
another "compromise," which
suggested that the line lie under-!
grounded until it .reaches the
Stanford campus, after which
"Stanford could do with it what
they will."
TUBMAN SAID that this alter
native has never been formally
presented to I he Trustees, butl
that "the? Trustees would object :
to such a reverse discrimination
policy. The Trustees have held
the position that lines should be
underground on Stanford land if
possible." but "in this case it is
so expensive that we believe it
would be unfeasible."
TISi; nrci'ART.MKNT ol Justice
has already filed proceeding to
condemn the land needed for the
overhead lines.
Following Seaborg's press con
ference a Redwood City Tribune
reporter demanded of Terman
how Stanford can justify not i
contributing to the underground
lines.
"The University accepted the!
accelerator on a no-gain, no-loss |
basis," said Terman.

AEC CHAIRMAN GLENN T. SEABORG
Atomic En e r g y Commission
Chairman Glenn T. Seaborg re
iterated yesterday the AEC's re
fusal to pay the entire cost of
underground lines to the Stanford
Linear Accelerator, but left the
way open for "cost-sharing" com
promise proposals by local citi
zens groups fighting overhead
lines.
AFTER TOURING the SLAC
facilities yesterday morning, Sea
borg concluded that the best so
lution would be (to construct)
tubular poles through Woodside.
"These poles," s a i d Seaborg,
"could be put up with as much
aesthetic thought as possible,
painted green to blend with the
countryside, and with a minimum
of cutting away of the under
brush. This would be the most
logical position," he said.
Seaborg pointed out that only
fourteen poles would be needed to
bring the power to the accelera
tor, and that only five of these
would be on Woodside land.
At the same time, Seaborg said
that the AEC, "in a spirit of com
promise," would be willing to ac
cept a single circuit, 180 mega
watt underground line if the local
interests could arrange a com
promise among themselves to put
up the $2.6 million cost. Pacific
Gas and Electric has offered
$1,012,000 and Woodside voted to
quadruple its tax rate to raise
$150,000.

AEC CHAIRMAN GLENN T. SEABORG
Atomic En e r g y Commission
Chairman Glenn T. Seaborg re
iterated yesterday the AEC's re
fusal to pay the entire cost of
underground lines to the Stanford
Linear Accelerator, but left the
way open for "cost-sharing" com
promise proposals by local citi
zens groups fighting overhead
lines.
AFTER TOURING the SLAC
facilities yesterday morning, Sea
borg concluded that the best so
lution would be (to construct)
tubular poles through Woodside.
"These poles," s a i d Seaborg,
"could be put up with as much
aesthetic thought as possible,
painted green to blend with the
countryside, and with a minimum
of cutting away of the under
brush. This would be the most
logical position," he said.
Seaborg pointed out that only
fourteen poles would be needed to
bring the power to the accelera
tor, and that only five of these
would be on Woodside land.
At the same time, Seaborg said
that the AEC, "in a spirit of com
promise," would be willing to ac
cept a single circuit, 180 mega
watt underground line if the local
interests could arrange a com
promise among themselves to put
up the $2.6 million cost. Pacific
Gas and Electric has offered
$1,012,000 and Woodside voted to
quadruple its tax rate to raise
$150,000.
THE AEC previously had in
dicated that, if the line is to be
underground, it will settle for
nothing less than a single icreuit
300 megawatt line, which would
cost $3.6 million.
Seaborg explained that the AEC
could not supply the remaining
$1.4 million needed for the under
ground lines even if it wanted to.
"As a practical matter, it is not
something for the AEC alone to
determine. The legislative history
of the project is such that . . .
authority from Congress is neces
sary to spend this much federal
money."
SEABORG CHARGED the foes
of the overhead lines with failure
to propose meaningful compro
mises. "There has been no change
on the part of the Woodside and
San Mateo County people from

their original position presented j
during the course of negotia-j
tions," he said.
Seaborg claimed that the AEC
lias made many efforts to pro- j
mote an acceptable compromise.
"We will accept far less adequate
facilities than PG&E would fur
nish if the power were to be
brought in on (120-foot) towers;
with dual circuits of 300 mega
watts each. In a spirit of com
promise, to find something better
looking, we have agreed to accept
single tubular poles, which don't
seem to us to be too unsightly." !
