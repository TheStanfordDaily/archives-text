THE HOLY RESTRAINER
"But relative 1o the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Messiah . . .
Let no one deceive or beguile you in any way, for that day will not come ex
cept the apostasy comes first—that is, unless the (predicted) great falling away
of those who have professed to be Christians has come — and the man of
lawlessness (sin) is revealed, who is the son of doom (perdition) who opposes
and exalts himself so proudly and insolently against and over all that is called
God or that is worshipped (even to his actually) taking his seat in the temple
of God . . . And now you know what is restraining him (from being revealed
at this time); it is so that he may be manifested (revealed) in his own (ap
pointed) time. For the mystery of lawlessness, that hidden principle of rebel
lion against constituted authority—is already at work in the world, (but if is)
restrained only until He who restrains is taken out of the way. And then the
lawless one (the Antichrist) will be revealed and the Lord Jesus will slay him
with the breath of His mouth and bring him to an end by His appearing at
His coming. The coming (of the lawless one, the Antichrist) is through the
| activity and working of Satan, and will be attended by great power and with
| all sorts of (pretended) miracles and signs and delusive marvels—(all of them)
; lying wonders—And by unlimited seduction to evil and with all wicked decep
tion for those who are (going to perdition perishing because they did not
welcome the Truth but refused to love it that they might be saved. Therefore
God sends them a misleading influence, a working of error and a strong
delusion to make them believe what is false, in order that all may be judged
and condemned who did not believe—who refused to adhere to, trust in and
rely on — the Truth, but (instead) too pleasure in unrighteousness." 2 Thess.
2:1-12 (Amplified)
The present age is marked by increasing apostasy within the Christian
! faith as professing Christians depart from the Word of God and the living
Lord Jesus Christ. Man-made theologies and popular philosophies are sub-
I stituted for the Gospel truth.
Yet even today, through the small band of born-again believers, God the
Holy Spirit exerts a powerful restraining influence on the present evil world
! system. His power holds down the lid on this pressure-cooker world and pre
i vents the forces of evil from running rampant and unchecked. However, the
Holy Spirit will not exert this restraining influence forever. At the appointed
| time the world-system will quickly fall apart and Antichrist, the most evil
world ruler of all time, will appear and exalt himself as God. This wil be a
J terrible period for the inhabitants of the Earth. Millions will die in the wars,
famine, and disease which are vividly pictured in the Bible in the Book of
j Revelation.
If you are a Christian today, your yielded life makes it possible for the
Holy Spirit to shed abroad Christ's love for the lost who can yet be saved if
they will respond to the precious Gospol. If you are not a Christian, your fate
is the same as that of the Antichrist. Now if any man have not the Spirit of
Christ, he is none of his." Rom 8:9.
