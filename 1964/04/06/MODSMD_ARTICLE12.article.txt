# Fraternity Suspension Possible
## National Warns Delta Tau Delta 
### 
The Stanford Chapter of the
Delta Tau Delta Fraternity has
been threatened with suspension
from the national organization
for its failure to observe the Fra
ternity's operating procedures,
and its scholastic record, the
Stanford Daily learned recently.
In a letter sent to the fraternity
and to all active alumni, the na
tional organization directed the
Stanford Chapter to "take what
ever steps are necessary" to ac
complish a seven point program
of improvements which includes
bringing the fraternity's scholas
tic average above the Stanford
University All Men's average and
the All Fraternity average by the
close of the 1964-65 school year.
DELTA TAU DELTA President
David Hedges said that the letter
was probably prompted by the
j failure of several chapter mem
bers to pass the Fraternity exam,
and by the failure of the chapter
to observe the formal rituals and
ceremonies of the Fraternity.
Hedges said the chapter had
also pledged several men not in
satisfactory academic standing.
This is forbidden by the national
organization, although a Stanford
University regulation against it
has recently been repealed.
University officials expressed
concern over the letter, calling it
very unfair to the fraternity. Sev
eral officials have written letters
to the national organization out
| lining Stanford's academic stand
ards and particularly protesting
the stipulation that the chapter
bring its academic average above
the All Men's and All Fraternity
averages.
