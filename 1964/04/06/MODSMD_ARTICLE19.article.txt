## 
### PETE KING 
Stanford's field event men
camp through in fine style, but
ihe runners lagged a bit too much
and Oregon's speedsters caught
thom at the wire to eke out a
74-71 win over the Tribe in a track
moot Saturday in Stanford Sta
dium.
Stanford Coach Payton Jordan
could hardly conceal his bitter
disappointment at the narrow
loss, " We losl by giving up one
stinking point here and there
which we should have won. The
team gave about 85 per cent of
its potential, but we'll be at. top
strength next week." It was Ore
gon's sixth*straight win over the
Indians since tho track series
was renewed in 1959. Oregon won
last year by the same score.
ON TIIK IiASIS of previous
performances, Stanford had been
favored to win, but the balmy
California weather inspired many
Duck runners to their season's
best efforts.
Stars of the meet were Oregon's
Harry Jerome and Archie San
Romani. Jerome, a former world
record holder in Ihe 100-yard
dash, easily won the 100 in 9.5
seconds, the 220 in 21.3, and an
chored the winning 440-relay
team.
San Romani won the mile in
4:03.7 after breaking out of a
threeman Stanford wall and
sprinting away effortlessly. Har
lan Andrews grabbed second for
the Cards. In the two-mile, San
Romani clinched the meet for Ore

gon by holding off a bid by Stan-
Ford's Harry Mcalla for second
placo. arc! Paul Schlicke breezed
U) firs! in 8:56.6, his best ever.
OTHICR ALL-TIME besls were
recorded by Clayton Raaka (G-fi
in Ihe high jump I and George
Porter <221-9 in Ihe javelin). Jor
dan had praise for Bob Stoeeker
and Tyler Wilkins, who led an un
expected Stanford sweep of the
discus, and for Jack Chappie, who
won the shotput at .VI-3 1 ( in his
first competition of the year.
Steve Cortright was the only
Indian double winner, gelling off
an excellent 48-3 1 » triple jump
and picking up an easy win in
(lie intermediate hurdles.

last week with a good 1:50.9 win
ning effort, holding off Duck Don ;
Scott in the stretch. Bill Pratt 1
summoned enough lasl-minute !
speed to grab third place at Iho I

close as Hie score indicates. Ore
gon hold out anchor man Jerome
from its mile relay squad, know
ing that tho meet was clinched.

1 rouble beating the Duck replace
