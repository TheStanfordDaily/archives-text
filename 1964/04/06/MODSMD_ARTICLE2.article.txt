# Students To Expand Mental Health Project
## 
### 
Stanford students visited a Meulo Park hospital on Wednesday
nights last quarter to provide social contacts for patients. This
more-thaii-t\vo-vear-old project lias vast room lor expansion and
a strong effort will be made this quarter to attract additional in
terested students.
Many students now taking a course called Introduction to

Social Psychology (Soc. 60) from
McCord have already expressed
an interest in participating this
spring, but all students are wel
come. It is likely, with the greater
volume of participants, that times
besides Wednesday night will be
arranged for visiting the hospital.
•lON' COLLINS (phone: 325-
7039), who is now involved in ex
panding the program wished to
emphasize that the part of the
students will not be one of merely
giving, but mainly one of allow
ing tlie patient to build confi
dence through giving to the stu
dent and establishing a full two
way contact. The patients will
probably test their ability to form
a healthy relationship with a
world which they have at least
temporarily left.
Two types of relationships are
open to students. There will be
group discussions with the pa
tients. at which hospital psychi
atrists frequently will he present ;
or the students may wish to form
a one-to-one relationship with a
patient in whom he becomes par
ticularly interested.
At the hospital the students and

patients may bowl, play volley
ball. play chess, checkers or cards,
or simply talk together. Previous
ly patients have left the hospital
with students an will continue to
do so this quarter if asked.
Movies, plays, ball games, or
many other activities could bo at
tended by the student and patient.
PAST EXI'ER lENCES at col
logos such as Harvard and Rad
cliffe, as well as Stanford, have
shown the patient sometimes is
more inclined to open up with a
i student than with a hospital doc
i tor, and also helps himself by
{venturing outside the hospital
with a student friend. The student
finds out more about humanity
and himself and often can obtain
I deep satisfaction by just a slight
I communication with an extremely
(withdrawn person or through a
friendship with a patient almost
■ ready to return to socicty.

an interest in participating this
spring, but all students are wel
come. It is likely, with the greater
volume of participants, that times
besides Wednesday night will be
arranged for visiting the hospital.
•lON' COLLINS (phone: 325-
7039), who is now involved in ex
panding the program wished to
emphasize that the part of the
students will not be one of merely
giving, but mainly one of allow
ing tlie patient to build confi
dence through giving to the stu
dent and establishing a full two
way contact. The patients will
probably test their ability to form
a healthy relationship with a
world which they have at least
temporarily left.
Two types of relationships are
open to students. There will be
group discussions with the pa
tients. at which hospital psychi
atrists frequently will he present ;
or the students may wish to form
a one-to-one relationship with a
patient in whom he becomes par
ticularly interested.
At the hospital the students and

patients may bowl, play volley
ball. play chess, checkers or cards,
or simply talk together. Previous
ly patients have left the hospital
with students an will continue to
do so this quarter if asked.
Movies, plays, ball games, or
many other activities could bo at
tended by the student and patient.
PAST EXI'ER lENCES at col
logos such as Harvard and Rad
cliffe, as well as Stanford, have
shown the patient sometimes is
more inclined to open up with a
i student than with a hospital doc
i tor, and also helps himself by
{venturing outside the hospital
with a student friend. The student
finds out more about humanity
and himself and often can obtain
I deep satisfaction by just a slight
I communication with an extremely
(withdrawn person or through a
friendship with a patient almost
■ ready to return to socicty.
