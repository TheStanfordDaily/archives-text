# Middlekauff, Docken Star As Tribe Nine Whips Cal Twice
## 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
Stanford's baseball team rose
up this weekend and smote its
oppressors, sweeping the Big Ser
ies from Cal and getting its first
two California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association wins.
The Indians whipped their arch
rivals 5-4 on Friday afternoon at
the Sunken Diamond on sterling
batting and fielding by Pete Mid
dlekauff and a great relief per
formance by righthander Dick Ko
vacevich. Then on Saturday,
sophomore Terry Docken allowed
no earned runs and only four liils
in beating the Bears 2-1.
MIKE CONNELLY started for
the Tribe on Friday and got
shelled from the hill after the
third. In his three-inning stint,
Connelly gave up all four Cal
runs.
But Stanford did some hitting
of its own that afternoon. Gary
Smilh opened Ihe game with a
walk. Then, after Lon Raymond
struck out, catcher Jim Hobbs
was hit by a pitch. This brought
firstbaseman Pete Middlekauff to
the plate, complele with his .079
batting average.
Middlekauff. a great fielder, had
been carried in ihe lineup only
because of his glove. But on Fri
day afternoon he lost the good
field, no-hit label. Coming up with
men on first and second and one
out in ihe first Middlekauff made
coach Dutch Fell ring look like a
genius when he blasted a long
triple to deep left center.
BOBBY COX, the quick center
fielder, followed with a smooth
sacrifice squeeze bunt lhat al
lowed Middlekauff to come home
with the third run of the inning.
Cal had come back to take a
one-run lead by ihe bottom of the
third, but Stanford managed to
tie it up. The score remained at
1-4 until the bottom of the sev
enth, when Cox beat out an infield
squib hit. George Thacher fol
lower! with a hit-and-run single
which sent Cox around to third,
from which he scored a moment
later on Ron Felt's Texas League
single.
The game was over after that,

for all practical purposes, as Dick
Kovacevich continued to pitch no
hit ball, including six almost per
fect innings.
ON SATURDAY, at Berkeley,
Fett once again drove in the win
ning run. Again ihe win was
earned in the seventh. Middle
kauff had opened with a double,
gone to third on a single, and Fett
pushed him across with a sacri
fice fly to left field.
Cal's lone run came in the sixth
inning when an error allowed
Epps to reach base. He was
bunted along to second and
scored on Shaw's single.
The Tribe's next game will be
tomorrow afternoon on the Sunk
en Diamond against the Cougars
of Washington State University.
This afternoon the Braves face
Vallejo Junior College on the
Freshman diamond a 1 3 o'clock.
