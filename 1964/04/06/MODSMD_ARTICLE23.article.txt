# 'All This Of Necessity Has Generated Pressure'
## Editorial 
### 
It has become a sad fact of life here at
Stanford that issues must be discussed ad
nauseum before any positive, concrete re
sults can be obtained. Witness the liquor
controversy or the dialogue on religion..
Whether this phenomenon is the result
of the student's love of controversy or the
inertia of the University administration is a
question which could itself be discussed at
great length. Its answer is unimportant.
What is important is that the problems lac
ing the university be solved as quickly as
possible, being careful that all interested
parties are consulted.
It has become apparent over the past
several years that the University library sys

tem is inadequate.
PROFESSOR OTIS PEASE, chairman
of the Faculty Committee for the Library,
has said, "For a number of years the high
quality of faculty expansion and the improve
ment in the caliber of students lias pressed
hard against a library system which was
geared to a very different — certainly a less
high powered — college community. The de
mand on the Library for new books and
services has grown . . . spectacularly . . .
where Stanford's basic Library collections
have been weak and additions to the faculty
have been conspicuously strong. All this of
necessity has generated pressure . . .
The solutions to the library's problems

are as simple as they are apparent. The li
brary needs more books, more staff, m or e
space and more research materials. In short,
the Library needs an expenditure of a con
siderable amount of money if it is to solve
its problems.
Yet the report of the Acting Director notes
that while actual expenditures for the librar
ies are increasing, the percentage of the Uni
versity's budget that goes for library opera
tions is decreasing.
This means that the University libraries,
far from improving their position, are actu

ally being put in worsened straits, vis-a-vis
the rest of the University community.
STANFORD NOW SPENDS only about
3 per cent of its budget annually for Uni
versity library operations, according to the
report. This compares with Harvard's 6 per
cent outlay and the tendency of schools with
important graduate commitments to con
gregate between 4 and 5 per cent. Certainly
Stanford can do more.
During the past several months, a good
deal of constructive activity has been going
on in and around the library. New stack
space is being added, two new acquisitions
experts have been added and the date for
the groundbreaking for the Undergraduate

Libruiy is virtually assured. And finally, and
most importantly, the position of library di
rector, vacant now for several months, has
been filled.
Rutherford Rogers, the new director, has
worked in the New York City Library Sys
tem and is presently the deputy director of
the Library of Congress in Washington. Liven
if the solutions we propose for the library's
problems are simple, their implementation is
not. It will require intelligent, thoughtful
planning from someone skilled in acquisi
tions, personnel problems and construction.
We do not envy Mr. Rogers' job. We do
give him complete support for what must
be done.
