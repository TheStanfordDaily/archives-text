## Rejected: Foreign Aid Leads To Independence 
### Stephen Shelter 
""The Conserative Papers . . . do not define the conservative
position. Hut they represent the sort of thinking conservatives
respect." Thus, Melvin Laird, chairman of the congressional group
that sponsored the book describes its purpose.
The Conservative Papers are not a direct repudiation of The
Liberal Papers, but rather a critical examination of certain trends
in American public policy. As Laird further states, Labels, we
are sure, would not preoccupy the men who wrote these papers.
The reader may at times feel if labels are appropriate at all, "Con
servative is out of place.

THE LEAD ESSAY of The Conservative Papers is the oft re
peated speech of former U.N. General Assembly President Charles
Malik. While relying on absolutes (e.g., individualism, equality)
and not offering concrete solutions, the Malik speech does point
to an important moral crisis that faces this nation—the loss of con
viction to an essential set of values. The problem is that the gov
ernment lias become "they and not "we.
Following the Malik essay are a series of concrete examinations
of specific problems. Edward C. Banefield s essay on foreign aid
deserves special attention. Banefield rejects the assumption that
foreign aid will indubitably lead to strong independent nations.
There is, he maintains, no proof that foreign aid makes people
either more prosperous or democratic; feeding peasants may be
humanitarian but does not change official policy, because the
peasants have little or no influence on either public or govern
ment opinion. Increasing aggregate wealth, says Banefield, does
not insure general wealth. The failure of much of our foreign aid
rests on sociological misconceptions concerning underdeveloped
nations; Banefield's essay points to such errors and offers a valuable
basis for reconsideration of our foreign aid policy.

HENRY KISSINGER'S essay on the Western Alliance and the
necessity for solidarity also merits attention, as do the three essays
written by Stanford professors: Milroad Drachkovitch s Soviet
Satellites: Challenge to U.S. Policy," Karl Brandt's "The Under
developed Nations,' and Roger A. Freeman's "Economic Priori
ties.'
Whatever the reader's political preferences, The Conservative
Tapers are a valuable experience that should not be missed. I here j
is sound criticism of contemporary policies that should receive the
careful consideration of students of the contemporary political
scene. The Conservative Papers questionably claim to be in the
mainstream of our traditions, but to mistake them as reactionary j
could be a grievous mistake indeed. I hey may be a forecast of
the future.
