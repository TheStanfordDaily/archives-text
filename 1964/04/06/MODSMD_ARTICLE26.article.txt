# Massive Display Of Ignorance, Incompetence
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Darryl Wold's article in
the April 2 issue was one of
the most massive displays of
ignorance and incompetence I
have ever read. It is a beautiful
illustration of "The Right,"
and. as such, symptomatic of
the particular political ideol
ogy's cultural paranoia.
To begin with. Mr. Wold men
tions Bertram! Russell's taped
interview on Vietnam, in the
body of his article ho talks of
saving the world from Commu
nism and the liberal ideology's
incompetence to serve Ameri
cans as a political or a moral
philosophy. No more mention
is made of what Russell said,
however, except some deliber
ately misstated and misunder
stood interpretations by Mr.
Wold.
Russell was warning th e
American people that the war
in Vietnam is not what most
of our press and State Depart
ment have led us to believe:
we are not saving the people
from Communism; rather, we
are carrying on a war of exter
mination which has only been
equalled bv Ihe Nazis.
WE HAVi: CREATED a
series of concentration camps
and proceeded with a program
of forced dislocation; we have
used the area as an experi
mental ground for chemical
and germ warfare; we have
participated in a war contrary
to the Geneva Convention of
1954, and have ignored the
many pleas of the Interna
tional Control Commission to
end our abuses.
The entire world seems to
know this, and the New York
Times has published many
articles backing up this fac
tual data . . . that is until our
State Department and CIA
managed to get the necessary
reporters removed from South
Vietnam.
The South Vietnamese people
themselves are solidly in back
of the so-called "Communist"
guerillas — otherwise, we

couldn't explain why Diem and
his successors, all under our
massive aid and "instruction,"
are steadily losing the war.
Why has our State Department
substituted doctrinaire rigidity
for fact in this matter?
BERTRAM) RUSSELL was
pleading against the extension
of the war to the north, which
all on-lhe-scene observe rs
know could not possibly be
supplying the south . . . this
is a matter of simple geogra
phic fact, but not the kind of
fact our State Department
thrives on, for it goes contrary
to the doctrine that everything
is either for us or against us,
and to be neutral (which all
the countries in Southeast
Asia want > is against us.
Mr. Russell was striking out
at our leaders, and we who are
led. for allowing moral insen
sibility to violence and the evi
dent readiness to practice war.
in an age when war is unthink
able. to prevail. And in reply
to Goldwater's "Why not vic
tory?" Mr. Russell was trying
to pose the question: "Why not
reality?"

• Report (Questioned
Editor, The Daily:
I am concerned about the au
thenticity of your report in
the Tuesday (March 31) Daily
about "death on wheels" in
Cuba. To your knowledge has
a more detailed account been
published? The New York
Times of March 31 and today
carried no mention of this that
I could find.
How did a group of U.S. citi
zens obtain this information?
What "uprisings" are being ad
ministered to by "death on
wheels?" One suspects that
this report reflects the dismay
ing willingness of most of the
U.S. press to print as news
mere rumors of wicked doings
in Cuba, a subject about which

is is most critical to have ac
curate information.

Editor, The Daily:
On Registration Day for the
current Quarter, we as well as
most other students were
greeted at the door of Memo
rial Auditorium by two differ
ent individuals apparently dis
seminating information from
the University concerning ac
tivities of campus interest for
the Spring Quarter.
Other solicitors, such as poli
tical campaigners, Quad repre
sentatives. an d the Peace
Corps were located at tables
in front of the Pavilion. . . .
One individual at Memorial
Auditorium was a representa
tive of the Stanford Peace
Caucus dutifully handing out a
poem by Bertolt Brecht to stu
dents as if this paper were a
necessary part of the registra
tion procedure. . . .
We do not contend that it is
wrong to reproduce the works
of Brecht or others of the same
literary school, nor is it wrong
under our democratic way of
life to juxtapose the same
literature with a criticism of
a governmental policy, albeit
we strongly disagree with the
criticism.
However, we do contend that
to disseminate such literature
under the guise of official Uni
versity publication without al
lowing the student to selec
tively choose whether or not
to accept the same should not
be condoned by the University.
It is neither fair to the student
nor to the other campus activi
ties mentioned above which
operate on principles of free
dom of choice.
We suggest that University
Administration should give the
Stanford Peace Caucus a card
table, if they do not have one,
so that they may distribute
their literature only to those
who desire it.

Mr. Darryl Wold's article in
the April 2 issue was one of
the most massive displays of
ignorance and incompetence I
have ever read. It is a beautiful
illustration of "The Right,"
and. as such, symptomatic of
the particular political ideol
ogy's cultural paranoia.
To begin with. Mr. Wold men
tions Bertram! Russell's taped
interview on Vietnam, in the
body of his article ho talks of
saving the world from Commu
nism and the liberal ideology's
incompetence to serve Ameri
cans as a political or a moral
philosophy. No more mention
is made of what Russell said,
however, except some deliber
ately misstated and misunder
stood interpretations by Mr.
Wold.
Russell was warning th e
American people that the war
in Vietnam is not what most
of our press and State Depart
ment have led us to believe:
we are not saving the people
from Communism; rather, we
are carrying on a war of exter
mination which has only been
equalled bv Ihe Nazis.
WE HAVi: CREATED a
series of concentration camps
and proceeded with a program
of forced dislocation; we have
used the area as an experi
mental ground for chemical
and germ warfare; we have
participated in a war contrary
to the Geneva Convention of
1954, and have ignored the
many pleas of the Interna
tional Control Commission to
end our abuses.
The entire world seems to
know this, and the New York
Times has published many
articles backing up this fac
tual data . . . that is until our
State Department and CIA
managed to get the necessary
reporters removed from South
Vietnam.
The South Vietnamese people
themselves are solidly in back
of the so-called "Communist"
guerillas — otherwise, we

couldn't explain why Diem and
his successors, all under our
massive aid and "instruction,"
are steadily losing the war.
Why has our State Department
substituted doctrinaire rigidity
for fact in this matter?
BERTRAM) RUSSELL was
pleading against the extension
of the war to the north, which
all on-lhe-scene observe rs
know could not possibly be
supplying the south . . . this
is a matter of simple geogra
phic fact, but not the kind of
fact our State Department
thrives on, for it goes contrary
to the doctrine that everything
is either for us or against us,
and to be neutral (which all
the countries in Southeast
Asia want > is against us.
Mr. Russell was striking out
at our leaders, and we who are
led. for allowing moral insen
sibility to violence and the evi
dent readiness to practice war.
in an age when war is unthink
able. to prevail. And in reply
to Goldwater's "Why not vic
tory?" Mr. Russell was trying
to pose the question: "Why not
reality?"

• Report (Questioned
Editor, The Daily:
I am concerned about the au
thenticity of your report in
the Tuesday (March 31) Daily
about "death on wheels" in
Cuba. To your knowledge has
a more detailed account been
published? The New York
Times of March 31 and today
carried no mention of this that
I could find.
How did a group of U.S. citi
zens obtain this information?
What "uprisings" are being ad
ministered to by "death on
wheels?" One suspects that
this report reflects the dismay
ing willingness of most of the
U.S. press to print as news
mere rumors of wicked doings
in Cuba, a subject about which

is is most critical to have ac
curate information.

On Registration Day for the
current Quarter, we as well as
most other students were
greeted at the door of Memo
rial Auditorium by two differ
ent individuals apparently dis
seminating information from
the University concerning ac
tivities of campus interest for
the Spring Quarter.
Other solicitors, such as poli
tical campaigners, Quad repre
sentatives. an d the Peace
Corps were located at tables
in front of the Pavilion. . . .
One individual at Memorial
Auditorium was a representa
tive of the Stanford Peace
Caucus dutifully handing out a
poem by Bertolt Brecht to stu
dents as if this paper were a
necessary part of the registra
tion procedure. . . .
We do not contend that it is
wrong to reproduce the works
of Brecht or others of the same
literary school, nor is it wrong
under our democratic way of
life to juxtapose the same
literature with a criticism of
a governmental policy, albeit
we strongly disagree with the
criticism.
However, we do contend that
to disseminate such literature
under the guise of official Uni
versity publication without al
lowing the student to selec

We do not contend that it is
wrong to reproduce the works
of Brecht or others of the same
literary school, nor is it wrong
under our democratic way of
life to juxtapose the same
literature with a criticism of
a governmental policy, albeit
we strongly disagree with the
criticism.
However, we do contend that
to disseminate such literature
under the guise of official Uni
versity publication without al
lowing the student to selec
tively choose whether or not
to accept the same should not
be condoned by the University.
It is neither fair to the student
nor to the other campus activi
ties mentioned above which
operate on principles of free
dom of choice.
We suggest that University
Administration should give the
Stanford Peace Caucus a card
table, if they do not have one,
so that they may distribute
their literature only to those
who desire it.

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Darryl Wold's article in
the April 2 issue was one of
the most massive displays of
ignorance and incompetence I
have ever read. It is a beautiful
illustration of "The Right,"
and. as such, symptomatic of
the particular political ideol
ogy's cultural paranoia.
To begin with. Mr. Wold men
tions Bertram! Russell's taped
interview on Vietnam, in the
body of his article ho talks of
saving the world from Commu
nism and the liberal ideology's
incompetence to serve Ameri
cans as a political or a moral
philosophy. No more mention
is made of what Russell said,
however, except some deliber
ately misstated and misunder
stood interpretations by Mr.
Wold.
Russell was warning th e
American people that the war
in Vietnam is not what most
of our press and State Depart
ment have led us to believe:
we are not saving the people
from Communism; rather, we
are carrying on a war of exter
mination which has only been
equalled bv Ihe Nazis.
WE HAVi: CREATED a
series of concentration camps
and proceeded with a program
of forced dislocation; we have
used the area as an experi
mental ground for chemical
and germ warfare; we have
participated in a war contrary
to the Geneva Convention of
1954, and have ignored the
many pleas of the Interna
tional Control Commission to
end our abuses.
The entire world seems to
know this, and the New York
Times has published many
articles backing up this fac
tual data . . . that is until our
State Department and CIA
managed to get the necessary
reporters removed from South
Vietnam.
The South Vietnamese people
themselves are solidly in back
of the so-called "Communist"
guerillas — otherwise, we

couldn't explain why Diem and
his successors, all under our
massive aid and "instruction,"
are steadily losing the war.
Why has our State Department
substituted doctrinaire rigidity
for fact in this matter?
BERTRAM) RUSSELL was
pleading against the extension
of the war to the north, which
all on-lhe-scene observe rs
know could not possibly be
supplying the south . . . this
is a matter of simple geogra
phic fact, but not the kind of
fact our State Department
thrives on, for it goes contrary
to the doctrine that everything
is either for us or against us,
and to be neutral (which all
the countries in Southeast
Asia want > is against us.
Mr. Russell was striking out
at our leaders, and we who are
led. for allowing moral insen
sibility to violence and the evi
dent readiness to practice war.
in an age when war is unthink
able. to prevail. And in reply
to Goldwater's "Why not vic
tory?" Mr. Russell was trying
to pose the question: "Why not
reality?"

• Report (Questioned
Editor, The Daily:
I am concerned about the au
thenticity of your report in
the Tuesday (March 31) Daily
about "death on wheels" in
Cuba. To your knowledge has
a more detailed account been
published? The New York
Times of March 31 and today
carried no mention of this that
I could find.
How did a group of U.S. citi
zens obtain this information?
What "uprisings" are being ad
ministered to by "death on
wheels?" One suspects that
this report reflects the dismay
ing willingness of most of the
U.S. press to print as news
mere rumors of wicked doings
in Cuba, a subject about which

is is most critical to have ac
curate information.

Editor, The Daily:
On Registration Day for the
current Quarter, we as well as
most other students were
greeted at the door of Memo
rial Auditorium by two differ
ent individuals apparently dis
seminating information from
the University concerning ac
tivities of campus interest for
the Spring Quarter.
Other solicitors, such as poli
tical campaigners, Quad repre
sentatives. an d the Peace
Corps were located at tables
in front of the Pavilion. . . .
One individual at Memorial
Auditorium was a representa
tive of the Stanford Peace
Caucus dutifully handing out a
poem by Bertolt Brecht to stu
dents as if this paper were a
necessary part of the registra
tion procedure. . . .
We do not contend that it is
