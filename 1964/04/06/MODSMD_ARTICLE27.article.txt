## McNamara, Gold water: 'Our Missiles Unreliable' 
### John Bonine 
"IF it were not For Presidential elections, [security questions]
might never be discussed at all," Dr. Stefan Possouy oF Stanford s
Hoover Institution recently observed in a letter to the San Fran
cisco Examiner.
Republican Senator Harry Goldwaters charge that our missiles
| are itndependable has drawn considerable Fire From 11 it' Estab
; lishment. According to Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, the
; charge is "completely misleading, politically irresponsible and
| damaging to the national security." In light ol Senate testimony
| of just last year, this counter-blast might reasonably be termed
"shooting from the hip."

BEFORE THE SENATE Armed Services Committee, Secre
| tary McNarmara said:
"... We have, I think it is fair to say, substantial problems
with their [our missiles'] reliability at the present time."
Senator Stennis, chairman of the Committee asked McNamara
about our Minuteman missile program, which is gradually replac
ing all others:
Sen. Stennis. ... 1 am advised with reference to the MIN
UTEMAN, for instance, considered a proven weapons sys
tem, that so far there have been only two MINUTEMAN
firings at Vandenburg Air Force Base and that they have been
both unsuccessful.
Do you recall, is that correct?
Sec. McNamara. 1 understand there have been Four, and
all unsuccessful.
Intrigued, Senator Stennis pursued the matter:
Sen. Stennis. . . . My point is that it is not yet proven —
See. McNamara. It is not yet.
Sen. Stennis. . . . Now, this TITAN 11 is scheduled to be
operational this year, in March, although the only launch
of a TITAN II at Vandenburg was last week, and this missile
blew up shortly after the launch, is that correct?
Sec. McNamara. Yes.
Sen. Stennis. You can't consider it then a proven weapons
system.
See. McNamara. 1 don't believe, Senator Stennis, that
we can consider any of our missile systems today, proven in
the sense in which you are using the word.
Sen. Stennis. That was my next question, just w hat, il any,
of them do you consider a proven weapons system?
Sec. McNamara. I don't believe any of them are proven
in the sense you arc using the word. For statistical reasons,
based on the law of probability, we must carry out a specified
number oF launchings under operational conditions in order to
develop any accurate estimate of missile reliability. None of
the weapons systems have passed through what 1 call relia
bility testing program as yet.
In light of such testimony, is it any wonder that Republicans
are calling for an investigation of our missile program? Bany
Goldwater, it is to be added, is a member of that Committee and
was present during the testimony.
