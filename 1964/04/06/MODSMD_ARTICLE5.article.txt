# THREAT TO STANFORD UNCERTAIN
## Experts See Rising Quake Danger 
### BOB BJORING 
With reports of the Alaskan earthquake disaster still
coming in, students at Stanford can look at the emer
gency instructions on their dormitory doors and reflect
on the local danger.
Geologists and seismologists have expressed many
fears.
Dr. Allan V. Cox, a visiting professor at Stanford
and geophysieist at the Interior Department's Geological
Survey in Menlo Park, stated that though it is very dif
ficult to predict the date of any future quake, it is "in
evitable that one will occur."
FRANK W. ATCHLKV, a consulting geologist, two
years ago wrote out a report on the safety of various
sights for a new school in Woodside. It stated: "Accord
ing to a theory, earthquakes occur in a crude rhythm
cyclic pattern, with strain build-up and release, strain
buid-up and release, etc."
There have been three major earthquakes in the
Woodside area in historic time — 1838. 1856, and
190(5, roughly 30-50 years apart. According to the theory
of cyclic strain build-up and energy release, Woodside
is overdue for another big earthquake.
Dr. C. F. Richter, of the California Institute of Tech
nology, has assessed the earthquake hazard in the Wood
side area at intensity IX to XI, and has described the
Bay Area as "the most hazardous earthquake ami in
the United States."
WHEN INTENSITY XI occurs, said Atcheley, "few. if
any, (masonry) structures remain standing. Bridges

destroyed. Broad fissures in ground. Underground pipe
lines completely out of service. Earth slumps and land
slips in soft ground. Rails bent greatly."
In 1906, the State Commission reported intensity
VIII.
Is strain building up now? Mr. J. M. Hoare, also of
the Geological Survey, said that triangulation measure
ments indicate that the surface of the Bay Area is twist
ing, the seaward land moving north while the inland
portions are moving south, with a total rate of displace
ment of about two inches per year.
IN I9(H». the total strain at the epicenter of the quake
was 20 feet. The strain now is estimated to be nine
feet.
Many geologists argue, however, that the strain has
been periodically released by smaller quakes, notably
in 1952 and 1957. Some say that the Alaskan earthquake
may have released a great deal of the pressure. But ex
perts cannot be sine, and there is evidence to support
both positions.
The damage inflicted by an earth tremor depends on
many factors apart from the intensity. One of these is
the type of surface on which buildings are constructed.
The shock waves emanating from a fault slip will slow
down in loose material, according to Hoare.
THIS CAN SET UP destructive oscillation in build
ings, causing them to sway and topple, where structures
founded on rock experience a violent but brief impact
which they are able to withstand. Stanford is built on
a loose gravelly loam.
A violent controversy has arisen over the linear ac
celerator on this point. Since the route runs over hills

and valleys, some parts of the tunnel had to be sup
ported on artificial fill.
Hoare stated that although this fill is much more
dense than natural deposits, it makes the accelerator
very vulnerable to quakes. Additionally, the new struc
ture toes into one of the branches of the San Andreas
fault.
WHAT SORT OF DAMAGE an earthquake would
do is, of course, sheer speculation. In 1906, Hie damage
was extremely severe. Smokestacks and chimneys every
where collapsed, the tremendous pipe at the power plant
killed one fireman.
Encina Hall was badly damaged. Floors crashed
down through the building into the basement, killing
one student and sending the rest into tents outdoors.
Roble Hall was cracked but remained intact. The Me
morial Church had to be completely rebuilt. Other
structures were abandoned completely. The Quad was
warped by surface shock waves and trees everywhere
were snapped in the center.
(lABKFUL REDESIGN has eliminated most of the
possibility of severe damage. The steel reinforced struc
tures in 1906 suffered little damage because of the rigid
building standards which founder Leland Stanford laid
down.
Professor J. B. Wells of the Engineering Dept. made
a technical report on the strength of the University's
present buildings, and, although he declined to make any
specific comment, he stated that the standards are ade
quate.
But most authorities agree that the earthquake haz
ard here is a real if unpredictable, one.

Bay Area as "the most hazardous earthquake ami in
the United States."
WHEN INTENSITY XI occurs, said Atcheley, "few. if
any, (masonry) structures remain standing. Bridges

destroyed. Broad fissures in ground. Underground pipe
lines completely out of service. Earth slumps and land
slips in soft ground. Rails bent greatly."
In 1906, the State Commission reported intensity
VIII.
Is strain building up now? Mr. J. M. Hoare, also of
the Geological Survey, said that triangulation measure
ments indicate that the surface of the Bay Area is twist
ing, the seaward land moving north while the inland
portions are moving south, with a total rate of displace
ment of about two inches per year.
IN I9(H». the total strain at the epicenter of the quake
was 20 feet. The strain now is estimated to be nine
feet.
Many geologists argue, however, that the strain has
been periodically released by smaller quakes, notably
in 1952 and 1957. Some say that the Alaskan earthquake
may have released a great deal of the pressure. But ex
perts cannot be sine, and there is evidence to support
both positions.
The damage inflicted by an earth tremor depends on
many factors apart from the intensity. One of these is
the type of surface on which buildings are constructed.
The shock waves emanating from a fault slip will slow
down in loose material, according to Hoare.
THIS CAN SET UP destructive oscillation in build
ings, causing them to sway and topple, where structures
founded on rock experience a violent but brief impact
which they are able to withstand. Stanford is built on
a loose gravelly loam.
A violent controversy has arisen over the linear ac
celerator on this point. Since the route runs over hills

and valleys, some parts of the tunnel had to be sup
ported on artificial fill.
Hoare stated that although this fill is much more
dense than natural deposits, it makes the accelerator
very vulnerable to quakes. Additionally, the new struc
ture toes into one of the branches of the San Andreas
fault.
WHAT SORT OF DAMAGE an earthquake would
do is, of course, sheer speculation. In 1906, Hie damage
was extremely severe. Smokestacks and chimneys every
where collapsed, the tremendous pipe at the power plant
killed one fireman.
Encina Hall was badly damaged. Floors crashed
down through the building into the basement, killing
one student and sending the rest into tents outdoors.
Roble Hall was cracked but remained intact. The Me
morial Church had to be completely rebuilt. Other
structures were abandoned completely. The Quad was
warped by surface shock waves and trees everywhere
were snapped in the center.
(lABKFUL REDESIGN has eliminated most of the
possibility of severe damage. The steel reinforced struc
tures in 1906 suffered little damage because of the rigid
building standards which founder Leland Stanford laid
down.
Professor J. B. Wells of the Engineering Dept. made
a technical report on the strength of the University's
present buildings, and, although he declined to make any
specific comment, he stated that the standards are ade
quate.
But most authorities agree that the earthquake haz
ard here is a real if unpredictable, one.
With reports of the Alaskan earthquake disaster still
coming in, students at Stanford can look at the emer
gency instructions on their dormitory doors and reflect
on the local danger.
Geologists and seismologists have expressed many
fears.
Dr. Allan V. Cox, a visiting professor at Stanford
and geophysieist at the Interior Department's Geological
Survey in Menlo Park, stated that though it is very dif
ficult to predict the date of any future quake, it is "in
evitable that one will occur."
FRANK W. ATCHLKV, a consulting geologist, two
years ago wrote out a report on the safety of various
sights for a new school in Woodside. It stated: "Accord
ing to a theory, earthquakes occur in a crude rhythm
cyclic pattern, with strain build-up and release, strain
buid-up and release, etc."
There have been three major earthquakes in the
Woodside area in historic time — 1838. 1856, and
190(5, roughly 30-50 years apart. According to the theory
of cyclic strain build-up and energy release, Woodside
is overdue for another big earthquake.

The shock waves emanating from a fault slip will slow
down in loose material, according to Hoare.
THIS CAN SET UP destructive oscillation in build
ings, causing them to sway and topple, where structures
founded on rock experience a violent but brief impact
which they are able to withstand. Stanford is built on
a loose gravelly loam.
A violent controversy has arisen over the linear ac
celerator on this point. Since the route runs over hills

and valleys, some parts of the tunnel had to be sup
ported on artificial fill.
Hoare stated that although this fill is much more
dense than natural deposits, it makes the accelerator
very vulnerable to quakes. Additionally, the new struc
ture toes into one of the branches of the San Andreas
fault.
WHAT SORT OF DAMAGE an earthquake would
do is, of course, sheer speculation. In 1906, Hie damage
was extremely severe. Smokestacks and chimneys every
where collapsed, the tremendous pipe at the power plant
killed one fireman.
Encina Hall was badly damaged. Floors crashed
down through the building into the basement, killing
one student and sending the rest into tents outdoors.
Roble Hall was cracked but remained intact. The Me
morial Church had to be completely rebuilt. Other
structures were abandoned completely. The Quad was
warped by surface shock waves and trees everywhere
were snapped in the center.
(lABKFUL REDESIGN has eliminated most of the
possibility of severe damage. The steel reinforced struc
tures in 1906 suffered little damage because of the rigid
building standards which founder Leland Stanford laid
down.
Professor J. B. Wells of the Engineering Dept. made
a technical report on the strength of the University's
present buildings, and, although he declined to make any
specific comment, he stated that the standards are ade
quate.
But most authorities agree that the earthquake haz
ard here is a real if unpredictable, one.
