# Residents Petition PG&E
## Ask Powerlines' Undergrounding 
### 
Thirty-five Woodside residents,
in an effort to prevent installation
|of overhead power lines to the
Stanford Linear Accelerator, have
i petitioned the Public Utilities
Commission to order Pacific Gas
I and Electric to show cause why
i underground lines should not be
j provided.
The petition was filed after
! Atomic Energy Commission
Chairman Dr. Glenn C. Seaborg
announced, after a tour of the
SLAC facilities Thursday, th a t
the AEC would not put up the
jsl.6 million that must be raised
j to install underground lines.
THE WOODSIDE group, which
includes the town's mayor, Don
ald Graham, also asked that
PG and E be restrained from
delivering power to the AEC pro
ject except by underground lines.
Representatives of the citizens'
groups expect the petition to be
the first move in a long legal bat
tle to prevent overhead lines, al
though AEC head Seaborg indi
cated Thursday that any further
delays would "seriously jeopar
dize Stanford University being
able to begin operation of the ac
celerator when it is finished."
The PUC will serve PG and E
j with a copy of the complaint,
with an order that it either be
satisfied or answered ten days
after it is received.
PG and K has five days to pre
; sent an informal answer and ten
days to answer formally on the
question of TUC jurisdiction. The
commission then will decide
i whether the issue warrants a pub
lic hearing.
