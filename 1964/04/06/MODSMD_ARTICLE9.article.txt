MRS. ARISTIDES DEMETRIOS prepares to weld on ihe newly-in
stalled free form fountain in White Memorial Plaza. Mrs. Demetrios
and her metal-sculpting husband worked yesterday texturing and
shaping parts of the bronze over copper structure. Over 80 jets
of water will contribute to the sculptor's intended impression of
movement and life when the form is completed.
