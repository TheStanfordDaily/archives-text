# Scholarships Available, Too
## Returned Volunteers Flooded With Offers 
### 
When the first wave of Peace
Corps Volunteers was channeled
into several developing countries
in 1961, service in the Corps was
a risky business.
There was no assurance that a
two-year stint in the Peace Corps
would be anything but a liability
to one's career. The organization
was operating as a temporary agency
under an executive order. Many
Congressmen were skeptical about
the program, thinking that it might
become a haven for wild-eyed ex
tremists and draft-dodgers.
Last year when the first Peace
Corps Volunteers returned to the
United States, their gamble paid
off. Job offers as well as grant and
fellowship opportunities poured in.
Major industries made it clear that
they want returning Pcacc Corps
Volunteers to consider the business
world before formulating plans for
their life's work.
Reaction to the Peace Corps was
almost universally favorable. The
administration was pleased, mem
bers of Congress pledged full sup
port and educators shouted praise.
John Monro, dean of Harvard
College, said that "two years with
the Pcacc Corps today can be as
significant as a Rhodes Scholar
ship."
The President of IBM said it was
clcar to him "that members of the
Peace Corps will be particularly em
ployable when they complete their
tours of duty. They will have
'monstratcd their ability to take
tough jobs under extremely
:ult circumstances and to fol
icm through to their complc

tion. There are never enough people
of this kind available in any enter
prise."
The response to Peace Corps
Volunteers, according to Dr. Robert
Calvert, director of the Career In
formation Service, "has been ex
cellent. Colleges and business firms
have been enthusiastic."
Over 40 colleges have earmarked
200 scholarships and fellowships
for returning Volunteers. Social
welfare agencies, youth organiza
tions and service projects have ex-

pressed strong interest in returning
Volunteers.
Such institutions as the Univer
sity of Chicago, Rutgers, George
Williams, New Mexico, Yale, Syra
cuse, New York University, New
York State College and the Uni
versity of Kansas are offering
special grants and fellowships ex
clusively for returning Volunteers.
In recent testimony to the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, Dr.
Calvert noted that "approximately
half of the former Volunteers are
enrolled in a college or university.
They are attending 117 different
schools in all parts of the country.
Among this group 99 hold fellow
ships. assistantships and scholar
ships with a total value of over
$214,000."
About 15 per cent of the Volun
teers who have returned took posi
tions in private industry. Such
firms as Shell Oil, Hilton Hotels
and the Chase-Manhattan Bank
enthusiastically sought volunteers.
The federal government has at
tracted a high percentage of re
turning Volunteers. The Peace
Corps alone has now hired 51
Volunteers for administrative posi
tions in Washington and overseas.
The Volunteer's experience over
seas should provide him with an
excellent internship for various
kinds of federal careers overseas.
A large number of Volunteers
are working as teachers. Calvert
said that "one study showed only
13 per cent taught before entering
the Peace Corps. Now 25 per cent

want to make teaching their ca
reer."
The Peace Corps placement offi
cer remarked that "one group of
Volunteers who served in Nigeria
is now making plans to serve
migrant workers in this country by
developing a mobile school."
Calvert heads the Peace Corps
Career Information Service which
was established to assist Volunteers
returning from overseas with edu
cational and occupational planning.
The Service also serves as a focal
point to which opportunities for
returning Volunteers may be di
rected by educational institutions
and by employers both public and
private.

When the first wave of Peace
Corps Volunteers was channeled
into several developing countries
in 1961, service in the Corps was
a risky business.
There was no assurance that a
two-year stint in the Peace Corps
would be anything but a liability
to one's career. The organization
was operating as a temporary agency
under an executive order. Many
Congressmen were skeptical about
the program, thinking that it might
become a haven for wild-eyed ex
tremists and draft-dodgers.
Last year when the first Peace
Corps Volunteers returned to the
United States, their gamble paid
off. Job offers as well as grant and
fellowship opportunities poured in.
Major industries made it clear that
they want returning Pcacc Corps
Volunteers to consider the business
world before formulating plans for
their life's work.
Reaction to the Peace Corps was
almost universally favorable. The
administration was pleased, mem
bers of Congress pledged full sup
port and educators shouted praise.
John Monro, dean of Harvard
College, said that "two years with
the Pcacc Corps today can be as
significant as a Rhodes Scholar
ship."
The President of IBM said it was
clcar to him "that members of the
Peace Corps will be particularly em
ployable when they complete their
tours of duty. They will have
'monstratcd their ability to take
tough jobs under extremely
:ult circumstances and to fol
icm through to their complc

tion. There are never enough people
of this kind available in any enter
prise."
The response to Peace Corps
Volunteers, according to Dr. Robert
Calvert, director of the Career In
formation Service, "has been ex
cellent. Colleges and business firms
have been enthusiastic."
Over 40 colleges have earmarked
200 scholarships and fellowships
for returning Volunteers. Social
welfare agencies, youth organiza
tions and service projects have ex-

Such institutions as the Univer

York State College and the Uni

special grants and fellowships ex
clusively for returning Volunteers.
In recent testimony to the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, Dr.
Calvert noted that "approximately
half of the former Volunteers are
enrolled in a college or university.
They are attending 117 different
schools in all parts of the country.
Among this group 99 hold fellow
ships. assistantships and scholar
ships with a total value of over
$214,000."
About 15 per cent of the Volun
teers who have returned took posi
tions in private industry. Such
firms as Shell Oil, Hilton Hotels
and the Chase-Manhattan Bank
enthusiastically sought volunteers.
The federal government has at
tracted a high percentage of re
turning Volunteers. The Peace
Corps alone has now hired 51
Volunteers for administrative posi
tions in Washington and overseas.
The Volunteer's experience over
seas should provide him with an
excellent internship for various
kinds of federal careers overseas.
A large number of Volunteers
are working as teachers. Calvert
said that "one study showed only
13 per cent taught before entering
the Peace Corps. Now 25 per cent

want to make teaching their ca
reer."
The Peace Corps placement offi
cer remarked that "one group of
Volunteers who served in Nigeria
is now making plans to serve
migrant workers in this country by
developing a mobile school."

Career Information Service which
