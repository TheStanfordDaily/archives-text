# Corps Aids In Cities
## 
### 
There are no Peace Corps Vol
unteers working in Paris but not
many of the 7,000 members are
living in grass huts either. Many
awaken in the morning to the
sound of street cars and truck
traffic.
"One of the most popular myths
about the Peace Corps," said one
official, "is that everybody is living
in the jungle some place 700 miles
from the nearest city."
Nigeria refutes this point, how
ever. Peace Corps projects are con
centrated in the six major cities.
Volunteers there are teaching in
secondary schools and universities.
Ibaden, in the western part of
Nigeria, is exotic enough to fit the
usual conception of a Peace Corps
site —it is the largest all-Negro city
in the world. Some 30 Peace
Corpsmen are teaching there in
secondary schools and universities.
Another 25 Volunteers are work
ing in Enugu, a city of 42,000 in
eastern Nigeria.
Five hundred miles away in
Liberia, 80 of the country's 300
Volunteers are working in one
city alone—the capital, Monrovia.
Members there are engaged in all
levels of teaching; some hold pub
lic administration jobs in the gov
ernment.
On the other side of the Atlantic,
in Peru, the Volunteer is again
found almost as often in the city
as in the "bush." Nearly half of
the Volunteers in Peru are in ur
ban areas—6o in Lima alone. Sig
nificant numbers of Volunteers are
also assigned to cities in Venezuela
and Chile.
In Bolivia, there are Peace Corps
Volunteers in villages, but a recent
project sent Volunteers to supple
ment university teaching staffs in
La Paz, Santa Cruz and several
other large towns.
In Turkey, a Volunteer can ex
pect to be sent to anything from a
rural hamlet to a town of up to
50,000 population. Living condi
tions in any case are "fairly nice,"
according to Volunteers.
In Lagos, Nigeria, things are so
good that drinking water need not
even be boiled.
Most of the people on city as
signments are teaching, but they
are not trained teachers. The Peace
Corps does not ask that Volunteers
have experience—let alone train
ing. Volunteers must have a bache
lor's degree with a major or minor
in the field which he will teach.
One Peace Corps official ad
mitted that he prefers untrained
potential teachers because they
were more likely to have a good
knowledge of their field and "be
able to do other things too —like
glaze windows."
In east Africa only one-third of
the Volunteer teachers have had
experience in schools in the United
States.
Peace Corpsmen in secondary
schools usually work under local
head masters and teach the tradi
tional subjects: language, math,
science, and history.
Under the influence of Peace
Corps teachers, however, many of
the host country schools are now
including technical courses in their
curriculum. As many of the stu
dents will only attend classes for
the first few years, Volunteers feel
that it is important to teach sub
jects that they can use immediately
in making a living.
