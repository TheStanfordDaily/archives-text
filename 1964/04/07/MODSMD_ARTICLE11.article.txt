# The 						Volunteer's Motive-To Be ADo'er
## 
### 
No one who knew him at the
University of California had any
doubts about Bob Stillwell's future.
The groundwork seemed pretty well
laid out. A degree in political sci
ence and a handful of applications
to law schools seemed to chart a
promising future. But that was a
year ago. Today the tall, blond
Californian is not reading law at
Harvard or Yale —he's teaching
English to children in Nepal.
Bob Stillwell sidestepped the
security of the so-called affluent
society to serve as a Peace Corps
Volunteer. Thousands of young,
well-educated Americans have been
motivated to go half way around
the world to exotic lands to teach
English, to develop local govern
mental units or to participate in
other Peace Corps projects.
Does the Peace Corps Volunteer
have the fervent, missionary zeal?
Is he a flag-waving patriot who
wants to tell underdeveloped peo
ples about America's virtues? Bob
Stillwell's interest in the Peace
Corps characterizes motives which
have led thousands of college stu
dents to temporarily postpone their
careers for voluntary service over
seas.
Bob Stillwell is a composite of
thousands of young Americans
who want to do —to participate
rather than remain detached ob
servers. There is no real Bob Still
well, but there are hundreds of
Volunteers with similar back
grounds and desires. He wants to
help people in developing coun
tries learn the skills that have made
the U.S. a powerful industrial
nation.
The Peace Corps can foster bet
ter international relations. It is a
way to work for peace and to be an
intimate part of the progress of a
developing nation, the tall Califor
nian maintains.
Bob and his colleagues arc not
caught up in any desire to Amer
icanize others. His expressions of
patriotic feelings show a broad con
cern for strengthening the United
States in its relations with other
countries. He'd like to improve the
U.S. image abroad.
There is something fresh and
genuine about the enthusiasm of
other Volunteers who trained with
Bob. They ranged from a student
of East Asian affairs who is writ
ing his Ph.D. dissertation on the
economic development of Nepal
to an elderly grandmother who
wants her children to live in a
peaceful world.
He wants to apply his knowledge
of English and inter-personal rela
tions to another culture. He wants
to gain inter-cultural experience,
general knowledge and personal
satisfaction through Peace Corps
service.
Bob emphasizes a spirit of co
operation. He has no desire to go

overseas to "help people" per se.
He says he wants to work with the
people, to motivate them to put
into practice some of the principles
which the Corps is pushing.
Service in the Peace Corps, Bob
believes, will be an attractive asset
on anyone's credentials. You have
to have a certain amount of drive
and stamina in order to stand up
under the pressures which we face.
It is a real experiment in self
knowledge.
Not all of Bob's colleagues share
in the scope of his altruistic out
look. Some Volunteers in Nepal
and elsewhere are not particularly
concerned with spreading democ
racy or combatting communism,
but are more interested in travel
ing abroad and applying their
knowledge. It is also an opportu
nity, as one agricultural worker put
it, "to identify with something big
ger than we are ourselves."
Bob has many of the qualities
of the most successful kind of
Peace Corps Volunteer. He is no
wild-eyed idealist, neither is he a
resigned pragmatist. He is both
self-motivated and socio-niotivated.
He has a strong belief in the Peace
Corps. He wants to build a better
world and to change the American
image. By the same token, he wants

to work with people, to enjoy per
son-to-person contact, to teach, to
apply his specific skills, to gain an
inter-cultural experience, to learn
and to further his own career.
Like most good Peace Corps
Volunteers, Bob is quite specific
about what contributions he hopes
to make and he is not at all shy
about what he expects in return.
He sees the Peace Corps as a
service organization with a pri
mary function of helping the less
fortunate.
There are Bob Stillwells at every
college and university in the coun
try. They all have similar motives
which allow them to make the tran
sition from four years of books
and collegiate social life to aiding
people in a developing country.
They are endowed with a cer
tain kind of enthusiasm, vigor and
verve. They live by strong personal
convictions: seeking to serve oth
ers in the service of their country.
They have a desire to learn another
culture in depth. They want to
travel and to combine adventure
with education. They want to
broaden their perspectives in a
mature fashion. They want to chal
lenge their strength and ingenuity.
And they were in the chorus that
answered President Kennedy.
