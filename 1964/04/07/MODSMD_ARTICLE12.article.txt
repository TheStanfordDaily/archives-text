# Other Countries Begin Peace Corps Program
## 
### 
The United States is not the only
country with a program to train
volunteers for work in the social
and economic development of
countries in Latin America, Africa,
and Asia.
The 13 national volunteer pro
grams now underway vary in the
amount of government support they
receive, but all are characterized
by a goal of putting young people
into developing countries.
The Canadian University Serv
ice Overseas, for instance, is a pri
vately financed organization which
has placed 160 volunteers in some
30 countries. Most are secondary
school teachers, youth workers, ru
ral development specialists and
medical personnel.
In South America, Argentina
has begun training a group of 50
teachers to be placed in neighbor
ing countries through the Organi
zation of American States. The Ar
gentine program is being financed
by the government.
The Scandinavian countries are
also involved in aiding the less
industrialized nations. Denmark's
program, called Dansk Ungdoms
U-L.andsarvejde, sent its first group
of eight volunteers to Tanganyika
last September and other volun
teers are in training. Norway and
Sweden are also in the early stages

of planning and training programs.
By the end of 1962, international
volunteer programs were consid
ered important enough so that 43
nations gathered in Puerto Rico to
discuss the future of the idea. They
formed the International Peace
Corps Secretariat to increase the
supply of volunteer assistance avail
able to the developing countries.
The Secretariat has offices in
Washington.
While the International Secre
triat concentrates on developing
foreign service programs, it also
assists developing countries to form
their own national youth organiza
tions for domestic work. Through
these efforts EI Salvador now has
60 volunteers working beside U.S.
Peace Corps members in that coun
try.
Other countries with volunteer
programs underway include Aus
tralia, Belgium, France, Germany,
Netherlands, New Zealand, and
Great Britain.
