# 'Over My Dead Body'
## Pacifying Parents Poses Recruiting Problem 
### 
"Over my dead body!"
That was the reaction of one
parent when his daughter expressed
a desire to join the Peace Corps.
Dispelling fears and misconcep
tions of parents such as this is pro
viding a new communications chal
lenge for the Peace Corps staff.
The Peace Corps staff is giving
increased attention to the need to
keep parents informed of the Corps'
operations and objectives as well as
providing them with an awareness
of the specific conditions which
their sons and daughters can ex
pect in the field once they become
Volunteers.
"Objections from parents causes
some Volunteers considerable psy
chological strain and in some cases
may even keep potentially good
Volunteers out of the Corps," ac
cording to Dr. Joseph Colmen,
Pcacc Corps research director.
"Many parents," Colmen says,
"are not aware that the Peace
Corps can be a positive factor in
a person's total development. In
their minds, two years in the field
is an unnecessary interruption of
the student's career."
Colmen believes that there is an
clement of anxiety about the un
known —some parents don't quite
understand why their son or daugh
ter would want to spend two years
of his or her life in a developing
country. This kind of isolation pro
vides an unhealthy environment for
both physical and mental health,
some parents believe.
Many parents' initial responses
to the Pcacc Corps spring from a
reservoir of misinformation which
inevitably includes the mud hut
image. As one Pcacc Corps official
put it,"the parent sees his young

daughter in some remote village,
fighting exotic tropical diseases,
isolated from civilization, hungry,
tired and scared."
A special message to parents has
been prepared to dispel many of
the misconceptions about the Corps.
The message makes it clear:
• That Volunteers are not placed
in work sites where the health haz
ards are so great that real dangers
are posed;
• That living conditions are
modest, but adequate, and not often
sub-standard slum-like conditions;
• That Volunteers are never
more than a few hours from tele
communications services;
• That Volunteers are not
placed in any country where a rec
ord of instability poses an apparent
danger, and that if the need should
arise an emergency evacuation is
available in every country;
• That the Corps offers long
range intellectual development ad
vantages and is an asset, not a
liability, to an individual's career
The concern for parents' aware
ness in no way undermines recog
nition of the Volunteer as a mature
and independent individual. The
message to parents is given to each
potential Volunteer after he makes
the initial application. It is up to
the student whether he wants to
give it to his parents —he may just
use it to answer questions and clear
up doubts in his parents' minds.
Men like Dr. Colmcn and his
colleagues at the Peace Corps be
lieve that by providing full infor
mation to parents a new spirit of
co-operation and understanding wiP
result among those involved h"
directly and indirectly in the T
Corps.

The concern for parents' aware

and independent individual. The
message to parents is given to each
potential Volunteer after he makes
the initial application. It is up to
the student whether he wants to
give it to his parents —he may just
use it to answer questions and clear
up doubts in his parents' minds.

"Over my dead body!"
That was the reaction of one
parent when his daughter expressed
a desire to join the Peace Corps.
Dispelling fears and misconcep
tions of parents such as this is pro
viding a new communications chal
lenge for the Peace Corps staff.
The Peace Corps staff is giving
increased attention to the need to
keep parents informed of the Corps'
operations and objectives as well as
providing them with an awareness
of the specific conditions which
their sons and daughters can ex
pect in the field once they become
Volunteers.
"Objections from parents causes
some Volunteers considerable psy
chological strain and in some cases
may even keep potentially good
Volunteers out of the Corps," ac
cording to Dr. Joseph Colmen,
Pcacc Corps research director.
"Many parents," Colmen says,
"are not aware that the Peace
Corps can be a positive factor in
a person's total development. In
their minds, two years in the field
is an unnecessary interruption of
the student's career."
Colmen believes that there is an
clement of anxiety about the un
known —some parents don't quite
understand why their son or daugh
ter would want to spend two years
of his or her life in a developing
country. This kind of isolation pro
vides an unhealthy environment for
both physical and mental health,
some parents believe.
Many parents' initial responses
to the Pcacc Corps spring from a
reservoir of misinformation which
inevitably includes the mud hut
image. As one Pcacc Corps official
put it,"the parent sees his young

daughter in some remote village,
fighting exotic tropical diseases,
isolated from civilization, hungry,
tired and scared."
A special message to parents has
been prepared to dispel many of
the misconceptions about the Corps.
The message makes it clear:
• That Volunteers are not placed
in work sites where the health haz
ards are so great that real dangers
are posed;
• That living conditions are
modest, but adequate, and not often
sub-standard slum-like conditions;
• That Volunteers are never
more than a few hours from tele
communications services;
• That Volunteers are not
placed in any country where a rec
ord of instability poses an apparent
danger, and that if the need should
arise an emergency evacuation is
available in every country;
• That the Corps offers long
range intellectual development ad
vantages and is an asset, not a
liability, to an individual's career
