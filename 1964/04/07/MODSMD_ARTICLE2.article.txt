# Corps Seeks June Grads But Myths Still Persist
## 
### 
"Waiting for the college gradu
ations in June is like waiting for
the kick-off in the Rose Bowl
Game," according to one Peace
Corps official. "When the whistle
blows it really breaks loose."
The official, Jules Pagano, Dep
uty Director of Training for the
Peace Corps, explained that the
Corps expects to recruit the bulk
of the 6,000 Volunteers needed by
September from the June gradu
ating classes.

"We have 75 different programs
scheduled to begin right after
graduation," he said. "The slots for
the 3,000 Volunteers returning this
year will have to be refilled in addi
tion to the 3,000 new jobs being
created. All we have to do is get
people to apply."
The biggest problem, according
to Pagano, is dispelling some of
the myths that have grown up about
what the Corps looks for in Volun
teers.

"Too many students think that
all we need are people who know
how to drive tractors, grow rice or
prune trees. This is false. Liberal
arts graduates, no matter what their
major, are constantly needed.
"It's the liberal arts graduates,"
he said, "who fill the bulk of teach
ing assignments and who will be
needed to help fill the backlog of
requests for educational assistance
in Latin America and other areas.
Many of our community develop
ment workers are graduates with
liberal arts backgrounds.
"The weird part about it," said
Pagano, "is the fantastic oppor
tunities being offered to some of
the Volunteers overseas. Many
Volunteers with only bachelors' de
grees are being assigned as univer
sity faculty members. The demand
for anybody who can teach the
English language is terrific. Where
else can anybody with a B.A. get a
chance to teach at this level?
"Naturally most of the Volun
teers assigned to teaching jobs work
at the secondary level, but even
this is unbeatable for giving the
feeling that you are actually ac
complishing something."
Educational programs will be ex
panding in Latin America, a region
which previously requested mostly
community development workers.
Another misconception held by
many college students is that an
applicant must be proficient in a
foreign language.
"Many overseas assignments re
quire only English," according to
Pagano. "In some countries, Eng
lish is the official language and
much of our classroom teaching is
done in English."
If a foreign language is needed,
the Peace Corps will teach it to
the Volunteer. "It is pretty ridicu
lous to expect the normal college
graduate to know any Bengali,
Arabic or Swahili," Pagano said.
