# Peace Corps Initiates Senior Year Program
## 
### 
A strong dose of hard work for
little pay is being olfered to 800
college juniors this summer by the
Peace Corps.
The newly-established program
will provide six to eight weeks of
intensive summer training for col
lege juniors who are planning to
join the Corps after graduation. Six
individual study areas have been
arranged at six American universi
ties for the summer project. The
programs will emphasize language
training and the development of
skills which will be needed in
projected overseas Peace Corps
projects.
The six plans will provide train
ing for:
• Secondary school teachers for
English-speaking Africa
• Secondary school teachers for
French-speaking Africa
• Urban community develop
ment workers for Spanish-speaking
Latin America
• Rural community develop
ment workers for Spanish-speaking
Latin America
• Teachers of English as a
foreign language
• Volunteers who must learn

exotic languages not ordinarily
taught in American colleges
Each of the six training programs
will also include courses in physi
cal education, health education,
American studies and Peace Corps
orientation.
The students' home colleges will
be asked to evaluate the summer
program with a view toward grant
ing credit for participants.
Juniors selected for the summer
program will receive allowances to
cover transportation. At the uni
versity training site, they will re
ceive room and board, and a
modest living allowance.
In the spring of 1965, those who
have undertaken —and survived—
the summer training will be noti
fied as to which project they will
be assigned.
A brief training period and final
Peace Corps selection will follow
the Volunteer's graduation. A suc
cessful applicant can expect to be
overseas about 60 days after re
ceiving his diploma.
Applicants for whom there is no
room in the summer program will
be processed in the regular manner
for programs starting after their
graduation date.
