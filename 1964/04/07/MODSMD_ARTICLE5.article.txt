# Origins of the Peace Corps
## Idea First Proposed To Michigan Students 
### 
It was just past midnight on a
chilly October morning in 1960
when the young Senator from
Massachusetts mounted the steps of
the Michigan Union in Ann Arbor
and asked a group of University
of Michigan students if they were
willing to go overseas to help their
country.
"There was a hush," one ob
server said, "and the mood of the
crowd seemed to change."
That was the first time that
John F. Kennedy publicly men
tioned the Peace Corps. He did so
again in a nationally televised
speech a month later at the Cow
Palace in San Francisco which
brought 30,000 letters of support
for the idea.
Where did the idea come from?
Since the Peace Corps is now so
successful, many people have
claimed credit for originating the
idea, and many can be given credit.
The first legislation in the area
was introduced by Congressman
Henry S. Reuss (D-Wis.) in Janu
ary, 1960. Reuss says he got the
idea in 1957 during an inspection
of the United States foreign aid
effort in Cambodia.
Reuss brought the subject of an
overseas youth corps into a speech
at Cornell University. As he later
said, "The response there—and
wherever else I have discussed it —
was electric."
Reuss's legislation — called the
Point Four Youth Program—was
sponsored in the Senate by the late
Senator Richard Neuberger of Ore
gon and was added to the Foreign
Aid Authorization Act. Eventually
$10,000 was allocated to make a
study of the plan and the Agency
for International Development took
the responsibility for getting the
study done.
AID had a difficult time finding
a group willing to take the con
tract, but finally Colorado State
University's newly founded re
search center agreed to do it.
On June 15, 1960, after Reuss's
proposal and before the money had

been allocated for the study, Sena
tor Humphrey proposed that a
youth corps be set up. His legisla
tion was the first calling for more
than a study of the feasibility of
the idea.
The Colorado group had just ac
cepted the contract when Kennedy
mentioned the idea at San Fran
cisco. After he was elected, he
established the Corps on a pilot
basis by an executive order on
March 1, 1961. Congress answered
his request to set up the Corps on
a permanent basis with a bill that
President Kennedy signed into law
on Sept. 22, 1961.
By the time the group had the
report out, the Peace Corps had
been going more than six months,
and the first Volunteers were over
seas.
How did President Kennedy get
the idea? According to George
Sullivan, who is writing a book
on the Peace Corps and spent sev
eral months researching the origins,
Kennedy's contact with the corps
idea came from several sources.
Reuss reports that he sent his in
formation to Kennedy in August
or September of 1960.
Among those who influenced
Kennedy in the development of the
Peace Corps program besides Ruess,
Neuberger, and Humphrey, were
Chester Bowles, Archibald Cox,
Walter Reuther, Ted Sorensen, and
Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson had
mentioned the idea in campaign
talks even before Kennedy. Bill
Moyers, who later became deputy

director of the Corps, was a mem
ber of Johnson's staff at that time.
The early, derisive comments
about the "Kiddie Corps" and
"Disturbing-the-Peace Corps" have
been replaced by such universal
backing that the Peace Corps gets
94 to 96 percent of its annual ap
propriation request, which is much
better than the average for other
agencies. Peace Corps matters are
usually passed by voice vote; a roll
call vote has never been necessary.
The success of the Peace Corps
has been attributed to two things:
the fact that it is apparently a good
force for peace in the world, and
the leadership of Peace Corps
Director R. Sargent Shriver. Every
where in Washington, Shriver is
given credit for being the man who
made the Peace Corps work.
Senator Humphrey wrote in
1961, "The effect of Peace Corps
work will be invaluable. The citi
zen of an underdeveloped country
may forget a case of American
supplies quickly consumed; he may
resent a load of American guns
turned over to his government. But
his memory of working with and
sharing the skills of an American
citizen will be strong and endur
ing. . .
"America's best resource is its
people."
Reuss was asked his opinion of
the implementing of his idea, and
if he had any suggestions for im
provements in the Corps.
"I think it's as close to being
perfect as anything can be."
