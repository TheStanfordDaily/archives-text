# No Guarantee, But...
## Volunteers Unlikely Draft Candidates 
### 
"We can't guarantee anything,
but . . is the usual opening reply
when a Peace Corps recruiter is
asked the inevitable question about
a returned Volunteer's draft status.
Corps officials who have been
dealing with the problem for the
past three years are the first to
admit that the situation is far from
being crystal clear. They do have
a few of the answers, however.
The act of Congress authorizing
the Peace Corps specifies that
Volunteers should not be draft
exempt. Although some legislators
had felt that Peace Corps Volun
teers should be released from mili
tary obligations, many were of the
opinion that such a situation would
result in a rash of applicants whose
only motivation was avoiding the
draft.
It was decided by the Selective
Service Board, however, that serv
ice in the Peace Corps was defi
nitely "in the national interest" and
so a Volunteer could legitimately
request a draft deferment. This is
currently being done.
When a Volunteer's service in
the Corps has ended, his deferment
is terminated. Legally he is again
eligible for the draft but actually
few are called. "We actually only
know of six Volunteers who have
been drafted after they came home,"
said one Corps official.
Many of them have been return
ing to school to do graduate work
and they just go back on their
student deferment status," he said.
"Some of them get married and

become deferred that way. Others
wind up with government jobs that
qualify them for deferment. Frank
ly," he said, "most draft boards
look rather kindly upon returning
PCVs. From what we know of the
cases of returnees who have been
drafted, it appears that they didn't
have jobs or anything and were
just hanging around.
"Draft boards can be pretty
autonomous though and it's tough
to say exactly why they might have
a returnee drafted. We can advise
a returnee about his status and
write a letter to his draft board for
him, but legally there is no re
course.
"Congress is aware of the situa
tion," he said, "and since the first
big crop of returnees are now com
ing back the situation is bound to
move a little more into the spot
light."
Internally, Peace Corps Volun
teers and staff members often take
opposing views on "the draft ex
emption question."
"I don't want a draft exemption,''
said one returned Volunteer who
is now working as a staff member
in Washington. "Nobody with any
sense actually thinks that spending
two years in some mosquito in
fested jungle is easier than service,
but I don't want anybody question
ing my motives. I think the Volun
teer feels a terrific sense of
accomplishment which he might
not get in the service, but still I
don't think he should automatically
be exempted."
Others feel differently. "When
a guy comes back from a two year
Peace Corps assignment he shouldn't
have to start worrying about the
draft," one Corps official said." He's
certainly made a sacrifice and per
formed a service for his country.
In peacetime situations where there
is no big draft call, 1 think Volun
teers ought to be officially ex
empted."
Ironically, both sides agree that
an official draft exemption would
have no effect on the caliber of the
Volunteer being sent overseas.
"We know what kind of motiva
tion we're looking for in Volunteers
and, frankly, anyone who is just
trying to beat the draft usually
doesn't get through the screening
process. Even if he did, he'd proh
ably be washed out in the first 112
weeks of training."
