# Cooperative Venture for Stability
## Volunteers Encourage Cooperative Effort 
### 
The Peace Corps Volunteer is
usually pictured with dirt under
his fingernails, digging in the mud
;o help the lowly peon plant his
crops. Actually, a large percentage
of the Volunteers are involved in
initiating a cooperative effort be
tween people in areas where work
ing together was unheard of before.
Community development, as this
process is called, takes place in
both villages and urban areas. It
involves three steps.
First, the Volunteer must get to
know the people and be accepted
by them. This is described by Vol
unteers as one of their toughest
problems because it is a relatively
inactive period and they are unable
to see any tangible results from
their efforts. They may get to know
the people by talking to them in
cafes, meeting with them on the
street or helping them in small
• chores.
The second phase consists of
organizing the community to hold
meetings at which local problems
are presented. This stage is also
difficult. It may take many sessions
before the Volunteer can get an
orderly meeting.
In the third and final stage, the
Volunteer starts mobilizing the
community to work on its de
fined problem. In many foreign
countries, people are articulate and
thorough planners, but sometimes
become bored by the things they
have planned. As one Volunteer
said, "Our greatest enemy is the
'elaborate plan.' The idea becomes
the substitute for the work and
sweat that is really needed. We in
the United States are a country of
doers —we avoid elaborate plan
ning and speech-making and
quickly roll up our sleeves and go
to work. Our greatest efforts as
Volunteers are spent in getting the
sleeves up."
The Volunteer must get the peo
ple of the country to do the work
themselves. If the Volunteer does
it himself, his time is wasted. Many
Volunteers arrive in an area, and
the villagers ask shortly, "Where

are the bulldozers?" The Volunteer
then might tell the villager to ap
proach his own government about
supplying a bulldozer. The idea is
to get the people in the area to help
themselves.
One example of a rural commu
nity development project was a
cooperative vegetable-growing en
terprise in Chile. A Volunteer
talked 20 families into growing
three kinds of vegetables together
and marketing them together. By
cooperating, they were able to rent
a truck to take their harvest to
town instead of each having to use
his ox-cart. The profits were split
among the families with a small
amount to the cooperative to keep
it going.
Some of the farmers made as
much from one harvest as they
made in two years working on
the large, privately owned farms
where they were employed.
Another project by the same
Volunteer involved getting a bred
sow from CARE and splitting the
resulting litter among several fam
ilies. The female pigs in the litter
were bred, thereby producing a
litter from each female. Of this
third generation, one pig was given
to CARE to repay the original
loan, and one was given to the
cooperative.
This has been criticized in some
areas as communistic, but it is
actually the highest form of free,
private enterprise. Under commu
nism, the state owns and controls
everything. Under the cooperative
program, the farmer owns his pigs
and treats them as his own. The
whole cooperative movement de
veloped by the Volunteers could
be described as a process of coop
erative individualism.
Whether in urban or rural areas,
the Volunteer is concerned primar
ily with getting the people to work
together. He tries to develop the
organization of the area so that
the people will carry on after he
goes home.
Although it is too early to tell
with certitude, the indications are
that the villagers will be capable of
dealing with their own problems
after two years of work with the
Volunteer.

amount to the cooperative to keep
it going.
Some of the farmers made as
much from one harvest as they
made in two years working on
the large, privately owned farms
where they were employed.
Another project by the same
Volunteer involved getting a bred
sow from CARE and splitting the
resulting litter among several fam
ilies. The female pigs in the litter
were bred, thereby producing a
litter from each female. Of this
third generation, one pig was given
to CARE to repay the original
loan, and one was given to the
cooperative.
This has been criticized in some
areas as communistic, but it is
actually the highest form of free,
private enterprise. Under commu
nism, the state owns and controls
everything. Under the cooperative
program, the farmer owns his pigs
and treats them as his own. The
whole cooperative movement de
veloped by the Volunteers could
be described as a process of coop
erative individualism.
Whether in urban or rural areas,
the Volunteer is concerned primar
ily with getting the people to work
together. He tries to develop the
organization of the area so that
the people will carry on after he
goes home.
Although it is too early to tell
with certitude, the indications are
that the villagers will be capable of
dealing with their own problems
after two years of work with the
Volunteer.

The Peace Corps Volunteer is
usually pictured with dirt under
his fingernails, digging in the mud
;o help the lowly peon plant his
crops. Actually, a large percentage
of the Volunteers are involved in
initiating a cooperative effort be
tween people in areas where work
ing together was unheard of before.
Community development, as this
process is called, takes place in
both villages and urban areas. It
involves three steps.
First, the Volunteer must get to
know the people and be accepted
by them. This is described by Vol
unteers as one of their toughest
problems because it is a relatively
inactive period and they are unable
to see any tangible results from
their efforts. They may get to know
the people by talking to them in
cafes, meeting with them on the
street or helping them in small
• chores.
The second phase consists of
organizing the community to hold
meetings at which local problems
are presented. This stage is also
difficult. It may take many sessions
before the Volunteer can get an
orderly meeting.
In the third and final stage, the
Volunteer starts mobilizing the
community to work on its de
fined problem. In many foreign
countries, people are articulate and
thorough planners, but sometimes
become bored by the things they
have planned. As one Volunteer
said, "Our greatest enemy is the
'elaborate plan.' The idea becomes
the substitute for the work and
sweat that is really needed. We in
the United States are a country of
doers —we avoid elaborate plan
ning and speech-making and
quickly roll up our sleeves and go
to work. Our greatest efforts as
Volunteers are spent in getting the
sleeves up."
The Volunteer must get the peo
ple of the country to do the work
themselves. If the Volunteer does
it himself, his time is wasted. Many
Volunteers arrive in an area, and
the villagers ask shortly, "Where

are the bulldozers?" The Volunteer
then might tell the villager to ap
proach his own government about
supplying a bulldozer. The idea is
to get the people in the area to help
themselves.
One example of a rural commu
nity development project was a
cooperative vegetable-growing en
terprise in Chile. A Volunteer
talked 20 families into growing
three kinds of vegetables together
and marketing them together. By
cooperating, they were able to rent
a truck to take their harvest to
town instead of each having to use
his ox-cart. The profits were split
among the families with a small
amount to the cooperative to keep
it going.

made in two years working on
