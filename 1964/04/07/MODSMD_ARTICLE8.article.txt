# Students Assist Campus Liaisons
## 
### 
There are more than 500 student
Peace Corps committees working
with college liaison officers. Some
of the larger Peace Corps commit
tees are at the Universities of Cali
fornia, Kansas, Purdue, Oregon,
Minnesota and New Hampshire.
The University of California
Peace Corps Committee keeps the
office open throughout the day to
handle applications from prospec
tive Volunteers.
Bob Gale, director of Peace
Corps recruiting, said "The active
work being done by the California
committee, and the fact that they
are able to keep the office open
throughout the day is undoubtedly
one of the major reasons for the
large number of Volunteers that
come from California."
Other committees are presenting
Peace Corps programs to local
clubs, showing Peace Corps films
and coordinating visits from Peace
r orps personnel to the campus.
