# Peace Corps Stays In Spite of Trouble
## 
### 
From Panama City a worried
Peace Corps field representative
sent telegrams to the 57 Volunteers
in the country asking if they were
all right. And from Santa Fe, 150
miles away, came the laconic re
ply: "I'm fine, thanks. And you?"
The answer is one detail in a
story that is beginning to be stand
ard in the Peace Corps: the Volun
teer is rarely a victim of the daily
diplomatic crisis; he can expect to
continue his work virtually unhin
dered.
In the Panama crisis, six Volun
teers were away from their sites
when trouble erupted. They were
escorted back to their areas
by Panamanians and remained at
work throughout the crisis—includ
ing the break in diplomatic rela
tions.
Anti-American rioting in Are

quipa, Peru, seemed to pose a
danger- to the Volunteers there
until the people with whom they
were working staged a counter
demonstration supporting the Peace
Corpsmen.
Volunteers were also in Ghana,
Tanganyika, Brazil, Cyprus and a
dozen other African, Latin Amer
ican, and Asian countries during
strained or violent periods.
In the Dominican Republic, an
army-sponsored coup overturned a
democratic government and caused
the suspension of diplomatic rela
tions, but the Volunteers stayed on.
In many villages, Peace Corpsmen
say, the Volunteer is the only
American anyone has ever seen
and the news of a break in diplo
matic relations matters to them not
at all.
In Indonesia, the story is less
dramatic but as impressive. The 30
Volunteers there arrived in two
groups six months apart. The first
group was met by anti-American
demonstrations and the second wel
comed by government officials.
The Peace Corps field represen
tative in Indonesia, David Burgess,
likes to cite the case of Medan in
northern Sumatra. There, the news
papers launched a vicious attack
on the Peace Corps and three Vol
unteer coaches.
While the editorial attacks con
tinued—saying that Volunteers had
been ejected from many countries
and that they receive military and
espionage training — the three
coaches led the Medan city basket
ball team to the national champion
ship and the swimming team set an
Indonesian record.
I.eveo Sanchez, Peace Corps
desk officer for Central America
explains why the Volunteer is such
a successful diplomat. "He has
identified himself with the commu
nity," he says. "To the people he
is first a member of the community
and a friend, and second an Amer
ican."
He is the handsome American.

democratic government and caused
the suspension of diplomatic rela
tions, but the Volunteers stayed on.
In many villages, Peace Corpsmen
say, the Volunteer is the only
American anyone has ever seen
and the news of a break in diplo
matic relations matters to them not
at all.
In Indonesia, the story is less
dramatic but as impressive. The 30
Volunteers there arrived in two
groups six months apart. The first
group was met by anti-American
demonstrations and the second wel
comed by government officials.
The Peace Corps field represen
tative in Indonesia, David Burgess,
likes to cite the case of Medan in
northern Sumatra. There, the news
papers launched a vicious attack
on the Peace Corps and three Vol
unteer coaches.
While the editorial attacks con
tinued—saying that Volunteers had
been ejected from many countries
and that they receive military and
espionage training — the three
coaches led the Medan city basket
ball team to the national champion
ship and the swimming team set an
Indonesian record.
I.eveo Sanchez, Peace Corps
desk officer for Central America
explains why the Volunteer is such
a successful diplomat. "He has
identified himself with the commu
nity," he says. "To the people he
is first a member of the community
and a friend, and second an Amer
ican."
He is the handsome American.
From Panama City a worried
Peace Corps field representative
sent telegrams to the 57 Volunteers
in the country asking if they were
all right. And from Santa Fe, 150
miles away, came the laconic re
ply: "I'm fine, thanks. And you?"
The answer is one detail in a
story that is beginning to be stand
ard in the Peace Corps: the Volun
teer is rarely a victim of the daily
diplomatic crisis; he can expect to
continue his work virtually unhin
dered.
In the Panama crisis, six Volun
teers were away from their sites
when trouble erupted. They were
escorted back to their areas
by Panamanians and remained at
work throughout the crisis—includ
ing the break in diplomatic rela
tions.
Anti-American rioting in Are

quipa, Peru, seemed to pose a
danger- to the Volunteers there
until the people with whom they
were working staged a counter
demonstration supporting the Peace
Corpsmen.
Volunteers were also in Ghana,
Tanganyika, Brazil, Cyprus and a
dozen other African, Latin Amer
ican, and Asian countries during
strained or violent periods.
In the Dominican Republic, an
army-sponsored coup overturned a
democratic government and caused
the suspension of diplomatic rela
tions, but the Volunteers stayed on.
