is tin one pursued by the majority of people. This includes a life filled with
mat- rial cum forts anil pleasures, and dedicated to self-exaltation. However, there
arc reat moral laws in our universe which sooner or later will come to bear upon
all our lives as inescapably as the law of gravity. Life may seem to be a great,
free adventure today, but" ... it is appointed unto men once to die. but after
this the judgment." (Heb. 9:27).
If you are not a Christian, you are still subject to the law of sin and death.

friends could be gathered to plant you in the earth with sorrow, kind words, and
praises for the "good" life you have lived.

God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." Gal. <>:/.
"For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested." Mark 4:22.
Standing before a just and holy Gnd, no man can escape complete condemna
tion on the merits of his own life and works.
"For all have sinned and come .short of the glory of God." Rom. 3:2.1. "And
whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."
Rev. 20:15.
Hut conscious eternal torment need not be your fate. "For God so loved the
world that he gave bis only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should
not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16.
The Christian docs not fear physical death. . . . "If thou shall confess with
thy mouth the Lord Jesus Christ, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath
rai ed him from the dead, thou shalt be saved." Rom. 10:!>.

and escapes eternal damnation.

kingdom of heaven." John 3:3.
"Therefore, if any person is in Christ, the Messiah, lie is a new creation:
!tlie old lias pa-srd away. Heboid, the Irish and new has come." II Cor. i: 17.
Today you are on one of two roads Lu life—the road to eternal .separation
from Cod (eternal damnation) or the road of eternal life with Hitn. If you are
on the former road, won't you accept Jcsu> Christ as Lord and Saviour today.''

THIS IS YOUR LIFE
How are you spending it? In 20th century America we all have much free
dom to pursue the goals and interests of our choice. The easiest road to follow
is tin one pursued by the majority of people. This includes a life filled with
mat- rial cum forts anil pleasures, and dedicated to self-exaltation. However, there
arc reat moral laws in our universe which sooner or later will come to bear upon
all our lives as inescapably as the law of gravity. Life may seem to be a great,
free adventure today, but" ... it is appointed unto men once to die. but after
this the judgment." (Heb. 9:27).
If you are not a Christian, you are still subject to the law of sin and death.
You can never be sure that you will live to a ripe old age. A week from now your
friends could be gathered to plant you in the earth with sorrow, kind words, and
praises for the "good" life you have lived.
