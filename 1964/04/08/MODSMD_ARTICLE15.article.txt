# KU Bans Cigarette Sales
## 
### 
(CPS)â€”The Board of Regents of the University of Kansas lias
voted to remove all cigarette machines from all state-supported
campuses in Kansas.
The order came after a report by C. Frederick Kittle, asso
ciate professor of surgery at the Kansas University Medical Center

in Kansas City. "I could certainly
urge that cigarelte sales be
banned on the state university
campuses," Kiltie told the Board.
The order, which passed 1 h e
Board of Regenls unanimously,
will become effective April Ifj.
Kittle said, "I probably need not
remind you that no other non
, medical university or college of
which I am aware has banned
cigarette sales and certainly no
other state has taken such ac
tion."
TIIE EFFECT of the order on
KU was explained by Raymond
Nichols, vice-chancellor of finance.
"There will be no cigarettes sold
on the University campus or prop
erty," Nichols said. This included
vending machines and across-the
counter sale in the Kansas Union,
he said. Nichols did point out that
the university had no immediate
control over sororities and frater
nities.
The reaction was very familiar
on the part of Kansas students.
"The rule won't effect those who
don't smoke, and will annoy those
who do, but won't stop them,"
said one student.
"STUDENTS will only go off
campus and buy cigarettes by the
carton," another student quipped.
"It won't result in cutting down
on the number of students smok
ing."
A committee had been appointed

earlier in the year to look into
the problem of smoking on the
KU campus.
"The object of the committee
was not to ban smoking, but to
question whether the university
should facilitate smoking by pro
viding cigarette machines on ihe
campus," James R. Surface, vice
chancellor of the university, said
at the time the committee was ap
pointed.
