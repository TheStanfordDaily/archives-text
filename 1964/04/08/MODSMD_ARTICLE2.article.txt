# NEW HEALTH SERVICE
## Forty Beds, No Waiting 
### STEVE GRUBER 
A new Health Center Building
will replace Alpine House and
the old Health Service by fall
quarter, 1965. It will have a forty
bed infirmary, twelve physician's
treatment rooms, seven psychi
atrist's offices, and one dentist's
office.
The location of the Health Serv
ice will be in the triangle of land
bounded by Campus Drive and
Lane "C," convenient to Wilbur
Hall, Stern Hall, and the third
cluster of fraternities. Since Cam
pus Drive is destined to became
the main artery for inter-campus
travel, this location will also be
easily accessible for emergencies.
The need for a new Health
Service had been evident to the
staff of the Service at the com
mencement of the PACE pro
gram. according to Dr. Maurice
M. Osborne, executive director of
the Health Service. However, the
original PACE program did not
include any plans for the new
building.
It was only after a contribution
of $750,000 to PACE by the Cowell
Foundation of San Francisco,
marked exclusively for a new
Health Service, that the adminis
tration agreed to the plan. The
Cowell Foundation also provided
the funds for the student medical
center at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley.
The present Health Service
building was originally used for
women only. The Men's Health
Service was in the Encina gym.
The building now in use was
built for only 500 women stu
dents. The planners of the bind
ing never expected Stanford's en
rollment to reach 10,000.
Until fall quarter 1962. Huston
House and The Elms were used
for students with contagious dis
eases. In 1962, these two houses

] were converted to women's dorms
and patients were sent to Alpine
House, located several miles from
Ihe Health Service. "Alpine
House was built in 1912, is too
far from the campus, and is
dangerous," said Dr. Osborne.
The present staff of five doc
tors is the maximum that the
crowded quarters will allow.
Seven doctors will be added in
the new building.
Dr. Osborne feels that the over
crowding influences physicians to
concentrate more on quantity
than quality. According to a re
r»r»ri ho wrnln in 1 Qfi 1 "Vivo

working doctors can presently see
up to 40 patients a day with no
interruptions, but there are many,
so this allows about ten minutes
per patient.
"In practice, the pressure is
continual to 'get on' to the next
patient. This puts the emphasis
on getting rid of patients, rather
than caring for them, and makes
for impersonal, seemingly callous
human contact, long waiting lines,
and justified dissatisfaction."
Dr. Osborne continues, "Today's
students are much more sophisti
cated medically than even ten
years ago. They expect high qual
ity medical care. This new build
ing is designed to give the stu
dents the same high quality medi
cal care that they would receive
from their own physicians."
The seven planned psychi
atrist's offices mark the begin
ning of the Student Mental
Health Service. Clinical psychol
ogists as well as psychiatrists will
be available. Dr. Osborne's report
emphasizes this new service. "If
the national trends, and growing
demand by students, and faculty
alike, are valid there is every in
dication that the Mental Health
Division of Ihe Health Service
will within ten years grow to a
staff of eight to ten psychiatrists
and psychologists.
"To meet the demand for diag
nosis, consultation, and short
term therapy, a full time job for
four psychiatrists is not an un
reasonable estimate. These must
be backed by as many, and pre
ferably more, clinical psychol
ogists, for teaching, and counsel
ing on a clinical, as opposed to
an educational and vocational,
level."

will replace Alpine House and
the old Health Service by fall
quarter, 1965. It will have a forty
bed infirmary, twelve physician's
treatment rooms, seven psychi
atrist's offices, and one dentist's
office.
The location of the Health Serv
ice will be in the triangle of land
bounded by Campus Drive and
Lane "C," convenient to Wilbur
Hall, Stern Hall, and the third
cluster of fraternities. Since Cam
pus Drive is destined to became
the main artery for inter-campus
travel, this location will also be
easily accessible for emergencies.
The need for a new Health
Service had been evident to the
staff of the Service at the com
mencement of the PACE pro
gram. according to Dr. Maurice
M. Osborne, executive director of
the Health Service. However, the
original PACE program did not
include any plans for the new
building.
It was only after a contribution
of $750,000 to PACE by the Cowell
Foundation of San Francisco,
marked exclusively for a new
Health Service, that the adminis
tration agreed to the plan. The
Cowell Foundation also provided
the funds for the student medical
center at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley.
The present Health Service
building was originally used for
women only. The Men's Health
Service was in the Encina gym.
The building now in use was
built for only 500 women stu
dents. The planners of the bind
ing never expected Stanford's en
rollment to reach 10,000.
Until fall quarter 1962. Huston
House and The Elms were used
for students with contagious dis
eases. In 1962, these two houses

] were converted to women's dorms
and patients were sent to Alpine
House, located several miles from
Ihe Health Service. "Alpine
House was built in 1912, is too
far from the campus, and is
dangerous," said Dr. Osborne.
The present staff of five doc
tors is the maximum that the
crowded quarters will allow.
Seven doctors will be added in
the new building.
Dr. Osborne feels that the over
crowding influences physicians to
concentrate more on quantity
than quality. According to a re
r»r»ri ho wrnln in 1 Qfi 1 "Vivo

working doctors can presently see
up to 40 patients a day with no
interruptions, but there are many,
so this allows about ten minutes
per patient.
"In practice, the pressure is
continual to 'get on' to the next
patient. This puts the emphasis
on getting rid of patients, rather
than caring for them, and makes
for impersonal, seemingly callous
human contact, long waiting lines,
and justified dissatisfaction."
Dr. Osborne continues, "Today's
students are much more sophisti
cated medically than even ten
years ago. They expect high qual
ity medical care. This new build
ing is designed to give the stu
dents the same high quality medi
cal care that they would receive
from their own physicians."
The seven planned psychi
atrist's offices mark the begin
ning of the Student Mental
Health Service. Clinical psychol
ogists as well as psychiatrists will
be available. Dr. Osborne's report
emphasizes this new service. "If
the national trends, and growing
demand by students, and faculty
alike, are valid there is every in
dication that the Mental Health
Division of Ihe Health Service
will within ten years grow to a
staff of eight to ten psychiatrists
and psychologists.
"To meet the demand for diag
nosis, consultation, and short
term therapy, a full time job for
four psychiatrists is not an un
reasonable estimate. These must
be backed by as many, and pre
ferably more, clinical psychol
ogists, for teaching, and counsel
ing on a clinical, as opposed to
an educational and vocational,
level."
