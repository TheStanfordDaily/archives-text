# Frosh Lose To Broncos, 10-1
## 
### 
A few errors, a four-week lay
off, and a good Santa Clara frosh
baseball team sent the Stanford
frosh to their first loss of the
season, 10-1, yesterday at Santa
Clara.
The Broncos battered pitcher
Daro Quiring for all their runs
in the first five innings. Dropped
flies and several bad throws by
Stanford contributed to Santa
Clara's scores.
BRONCO hurler Jan Dukes
struck out 15 Papooses, eight of
them looking, and gave up just
six hits in going the distance.
Dukes is a former San Mateo
High star who pitched semi-pro
ball in Canada during the sum
mer, facing many of the present
CIBA players.
The lone Tribe run came on a
homer by lefthander Dave Sponee
against the lefty Dukes.
Shortstop Dick Swan picked up
two more Card hits, making it
four in the past two games. Jim
Blaschke poked a double. That's
five straight hits for the lefty
pitcher.
Coach Ray Young said that
lousy umpiring rattled Quiring,
who couldn't get strikes on his
patented low fast ball. When
Quiring brought his pitches up,
Santa Clara hit them.
The frosh now hold a 9-1 rec
ord. The Broncos are 13-0.
