# Rush Plan—A Fresh Approach To An Old Problem
## Editorial 
### 
Few Stanford institutions have been criti
cized as heavily — and justifiably — as rush.
And superficiality is the complaint most fre
quently heard, by fraternity and eating club
men as well as observers.
Monday night an impressive proposal w as
introduced before the Interfraternity Council
to help solve the problem. Prepared by a
live-man board (comprised of IFG, ICC and
IMC representatives), the proposal included
two recommendations that we were particu
larly impressed with:
• TWO OFF-CAMPUS RUSII PARTIES

—one near tlio end of winter quarter, the
other in the second week of spring quarter—
at which there will be 110 women, no enter
tainment and 110 hard liquor. It appears
ascetic by present rushing standards, but it is
a sound recommendation. First, and most
important, such parties will allow the mshee
and rusher to get to know each other with
out the brassy, boozey, bosomy interruptions
so rife at most rush parties. Hopefully, the
stage will be set for some sort of intellectual
communication, a difficult feat under the
present system. But there art? other advan

tages: such parties will cut down on the high
entertainment costs of rushing and w ill allow
freslimen to choose their living groups on
more meaningful criteria than the quality
of a group's party.
• LIMITING THE NUMBER OF AC
TIVITIES during the first week to only two
open houses; then permitting parties (one

each week only) during the second, third
and fourth weeks. The present arrangement
for the first week of spring quarter, with
the hectic scramble of parties after parties,
is insane. The new proposal allows some
time for breathing so freshmen can view
their rushing with proper perspective—and
not be stampeded into some hasty decision.
The latter is the problem 011 far tot) many
campuses, including this one. Indeed, some
here have said a rapid-paced rush is indis
pensable because it provides the proper
stimulus for men to accept bids. We like

to think, however, that the fraternity and
eating club systems are based on something
more substantial.
These recommendations are not going to
cure rush of its superficiality. We suspect it
will always be that way. And that's why it
bothers us that so many rushees take such a
fallible system so seriously.
But, at any rate, we think the new pro
posal is a step in the right direction. And,
at the least, it will encourage discussion and
examination of an institution — rushing —
that sorelv needs it.

The latter is the problem 011 far tot) many
campuses, including this one. Indeed, some
here have said a rapid-paced rush is indis
pensable because it provides the proper
stimulus for men to accept bids. We like

to think, however, that the fraternity and
eating club systems are based on something
more substantial.
These recommendations are not going to
cure rush of its superficiality. We suspect it
will always be that way. And that's why it
bothers us that so many rushees take such a
fallible system so seriously.
But, at any rate, we think the new pro
posal is a step in the right direction. And,
at the least, it will encourage discussion and
examination of an institution — rushing —
that sorelv needs it.
Few Stanford institutions have been criti
cized as heavily — and justifiably — as rush.
And superficiality is the complaint most fre
quently heard, by fraternity and eating club
men as well as observers.
Monday night an impressive proposal w as
introduced before the Interfraternity Council
to help solve the problem. Prepared by a
live-man board (comprised of IFG, ICC and
IMC representatives), the proposal included
two recommendations that we were particu
larly impressed with:
• TWO OFF-CAMPUS RUSII PARTIES

—one near tlio end of winter quarter, the
other in the second week of spring quarter—
at which there will be 110 women, no enter
tainment and 110 hard liquor. It appears
ascetic by present rushing standards, but it is
a sound recommendation. First, and most
important, such parties will allow the mshee
and rusher to get to know each other with
out the brassy, boozey, bosomy interruptions
so rife at most rush parties. Hopefully, the
stage will be set for some sort of intellectual
communication, a difficult feat under the
present system. But there art? other advan

tages: such parties will cut down on the high
entertainment costs of rushing and w ill allow
freslimen to choose their living groups on
more meaningful criteria than the quality
of a group's party.
• LIMITING THE NUMBER OF AC
TIVITIES during the first week to only two
open houses; then permitting parties (one

each week only) during the second, third
and fourth weeks. The present arrangement
for the first week of spring quarter, with
the hectic scramble of parties after parties,
is insane. The new proposal allows some
time for breathing so freshmen can view
their rushing with proper perspective—and
not be stampeded into some hasty decision.
