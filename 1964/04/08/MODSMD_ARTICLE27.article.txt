\ certain Senator lias been doing a lot of what we in polities
eall "shooting oil your lip. "
II it weren't for the fact that this Senator imagines the country
is confused enough to consider him a potential candidate, he might
never have questioned the country's defense security at all. In
fact, if it weren't for the fact that those he represents are mostly
octagenarians and gophers, we might have never even heard of
him.

THIS SENATOR believes our missile system to be unreliable.
An eontraire! Our missile program is in great hands. Listen to
this testimony of two great hands, one representing the Establish
ment, and the Senator, another Senator, representing another type
of establishment which supposedly ended in 1565.
Senator: Now you just got to believe our missiles are un
reliable.
Secretary: \\ hats the source of your belief, Senator.
Senator: Source? 1 don't got to show you no stinkin' sources.
Have our missiles been tested on people, huh? Well, what do
you say to that, Mr. Smarty Pants?
Secretary: Our missiles have been tested extensively, Sena
tor.
Senator: Yeah, but killing people is what we're interested
in. I mean, you know, can they be used in Mississippi?
Secretary: 1 understand our MINUTEMAN has been fired
four times, succesfully, Senator.
Senator: So how many were killed?
Secretary: Four technicians, two reporters, and a full-bred
blue sperm w hale.
Senator: Great, great.
Secretary: Now over here, we have a smart little mover,
TITAN 11. '
Senator: As 1 understand it the only time this missile was
tested, it blew up on the launching pad.
Secretary: Win a few, lose a few.
Senator: Fine, but what if we had to kill Russia, or China,
or North Vietnam, or South Vietnam, or any of the rest of the
Reds.
Secretary: Win a few, lose a few.

AS THIS DIALOGUE demonstrates, is it any wonder that a
few blockheads are calling for a revision of our missile program?
Are our missiles ready, now, to kill? Thank God for elections
w hen a few dedicated vote grubbers can rant and rave. And where
would we be without the ancients in the Senate who somehow
manage to hang on and vomit on progress?
Our missile program is definitely in great hands; after all, what
more can one expect than to win a few, lose a few?

THIS SENATOR believes our missile system to be unreliable.
An eontraire! Our missile program is in great hands. Listen to
this testimony of two great hands, one representing the Establish
ment, and the Senator, another Senator, representing another type
of establishment which supposedly ended in 1565.
Senator: Now you just got to believe our missiles are un
reliable.
Secretary: \\ hats the source of your belief, Senator.
Senator: Source? 1 don't got to show you no stinkin' sources.
Have our missiles been tested on people, huh? Well, what do
you say to that, Mr. Smarty Pants?
Secretary: Our missiles have been tested extensively, Sena
tor.
Senator: Yeah, but killing people is what we're interested
in. I mean, you know, can they be used in Mississippi?
Secretary: 1 understand our MINUTEMAN has been fired
four times, succesfully, Senator.
Senator: So how many were killed?
Secretary: Four technicians, two reporters, and a full-bred
blue sperm w hale.
Senator: Great, great.
Secretary: Now over here, we have a smart little mover,
TITAN 11. '
Senator: As 1 understand it the only time this missile was
tested, it blew up on the launching pad.
Secretary: Win a few, lose a few.
Senator: Fine, but what if we had to kill Russia, or China,
or North Vietnam, or South Vietnam, or any of the rest of the
Reds.
Secretary: Win a few, lose a few.

AS THIS DIALOGUE demonstrates, is it any wonder that a
few blockheads are calling for a revision of our missile program?
Are our missiles ready, now, to kill? Thank God for elections
w hen a few dedicated vote grubbers can rant and rave. And where
would we be without the ancients in the Senate who somehow
manage to hang on and vomit on progress?
Our missile program is definitely in great hands; after all, what
more can one expect than to win a few, lose a few?

\ certain Senator lias been doing a lot of what we in polities
eall "shooting oil your lip. "
II it weren't for the fact that this Senator imagines the country
is confused enough to consider him a potential candidate, he might
never have questioned the country's defense security at all. In
fact, if it weren't for the fact that those he represents are mostly
octagenarians and gophers, we might have never even heard of
him.
