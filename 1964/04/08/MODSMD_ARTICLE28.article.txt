# Preserve Freedom 112 From Thought, Anxiety
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I emphatically agree with
Mr. Bowers and Mr. Work
man, who objected to being
forced to re&d the subversive
literature handed out by the
Peace Caucus on Reg Day. I.
too. compulsively took one of
the Peace Caucus's sheets and
read it (not knowing what it
was) and was disturbed.
I have no objection if they
want to indulge in arousing
their own anxiety with s u c h
thoughts (after all. this is a
free country), but 1 must pro
test when they try to fore e
their anxiety on me!
This is no isolated example
of such doings. I think all
billboards should face away
from the road so that no one
will be forced to read them
who does not want to. i think
all advertisements in maga
zines should be covered with
a blank page so that we may
exercise our free choice in
deciding whether to read
them.
All around us are these
insidious attempts to mold
our thoughts, to arouse our
anxiety, to disturb our cher
ished way of life. Something
ought to be done about these
people who try to take away
our freedom by forcing us to
be exposed to new thoughts.
Something ought to be done
to preserve our four most
basic freedoms — freedom
from challenging ideas, free
dom from thought, freedom
from anxiety, and, above all.
the fredom to remain narrow
minded!

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Matzen's "destruction"
of Mr. Gillam's initial article
deserves a little attention.
Matzen's final indictment
suggests his essentially de
fensive posture: "It (the rush
system) isn't perfect, but it
works. If it. didn't, the r us h
system would have been
abandoned long ago." Ah. Mr.
Matzen, many of man's inven
tions "work," but how many
work well? To your second
point: Let us not be blinded

lo the inertia in ourselves to
be satisfied with that which
"works." an d yet works
poorly and lo the detriment
of many.
I want to enlarge the issue
somewhat. It seems to me
that abolishing the rush sys
tem entails eliminating fra
ternities and eating clubs
(though the eating club func
tion is not so dependent on
rigid selection procedures)
from this campus. 1 think it
is high time this possibility
be discussed quite openly.
So far in the discussion on
rush "The Defenders" have
asserted 1> Rush is all we
have, 2) We don't like it
either, 3) God only knows
what lies around the corner,
and 4) Fraternity men are
not all alike. But what do fra
ternities and eating clubs con
tribute to this campus? In my
opinion they erect artificial
barriers to the complete and
free intellectual and social ex
change among Stanford stu
dents. Groups include some
people and leave other people
out. They restrict us, perhaps
subtly, perhaps only occa
sionally. but they do limit the
range of our choice of action.
Some of us who will gradu
ate this year have seen how
little time there really is to
"take" from the "Stanford
atmosphere" (and what little
Stanford atmosphere there is
from which to take). I don't
think there will ever be a spe
cial way that Stanford is
(i.e., a Stanford atmosphere)
until these barriers have fal
len. I'm afraid it will be a
very long time.

Of those people with strong

is distressing how few have
bothered to acquaint them

With moderate effort, the

viciousness of (hat circle. To
begin, a clear, non-technical
introduction is "The Issue of

Is Burkhart for real? Pro

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Matzen's "destruction"
of Mr. Gillam's initial article
deserves a little attention.
Matzen's final indictment
suggests his essentially de
fensive posture: "It (the rush
system) isn't perfect, but it
works. If it. didn't, the r us h
system would have been
abandoned long ago." Ah. Mr.
Matzen, many of man's inven
tions "work," but how many
work well? To your second
point: Let us not be blinded

lo the inertia in ourselves to
be satisfied with that which
"works." an d yet works
poorly and lo the detriment
of many.
I want to enlarge the issue
somewhat. It seems to me
that abolishing the rush sys
tem entails eliminating fra
ternities and eating clubs
(though the eating club func
tion is not so dependent on
rigid selection procedures)
from this campus. 1 think it
is high time this possibility
be discussed quite openly.
So far in the discussion on
rush "The Defenders" have
asserted 1> Rush is all we
have, 2) We don't like it
either, 3) God only knows
what lies around the corner,
and 4) Fraternity men are
not all alike. But what do fra
ternities and eating clubs con
tribute to this campus? In my
opinion they erect artificial
barriers to the complete and
free intellectual and social ex
change among Stanford stu
dents. Groups include some
people and leave other people
out. They restrict us, perhaps
subtly, perhaps only occa
sionally. but they do limit the
range of our choice of action.
Some of us who will gradu
ate this year have seen how
little time there really is to
"take" from the "Stanford
atmosphere" (and what little
Stanford atmosphere there is
from which to take). I don't
think there will ever be a spe
cial way that Stanford is
(i.e., a Stanford atmosphere)
until these barriers have fal
len. I'm afraid it will be a
very long time.

• "Belly-Daiicing"
Editor, The Daily:
Is Burkhart for real? Pro
priety is one thing, but prud

Anyway, it's reassuring to

I emphatically agree with
Mr. Bowers and Mr. Work
man, who objected to being
forced to re&d the subversive
literature handed out by the
Peace Caucus on Reg Day. I.
too. compulsively took one of
the Peace Caucus's sheets and
read it (not knowing what it
was) and was disturbed.
I have no objection if they
want to indulge in arousing
their own anxiety with s u c h
thoughts (after all. this is a
free country), but 1 must pro
test when they try to fore e
their anxiety on me!
This is no isolated example
of such doings. I think all
billboards should face away
from the road so that no one
will be forced to read them
who does not want to. i think
all advertisements in maga

a blank page so that we may
exercise our free choice in
deciding whether to read
them.
All around us are these
insidious attempts to mold

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Matzen's "destruction"
of Mr. Gillam's initial article
deserves a little attention.
Matzen's final indictment
suggests his essentially de
fensive posture: "It (the rush
system) isn't perfect, but it
works. If it. didn't, the r us h
system would have been
abandoned long ago." Ah. Mr.
Matzen, many of man's inven
tions "work," but how many
work well? To your second
point: Let us not be blinded

lo the inertia in ourselves to
be satisfied with that which
"works." an d yet works
poorly and lo the detriment
of many.
I want to enlarge the issue
somewhat. It seems to me
that abolishing the rush sys
tem entails eliminating fra
ternities and eating clubs
(though the eating club func
tion is not so dependent on
rigid selection procedures)
from this campus. 1 think it
is high time this possibility
be discussed quite openly.
So far in the discussion on
rush "The Defenders" have
asserted 1> Rush is all we
have, 2) We don't like it
either, 3) God only knows
what lies around the corner,
and 4) Fraternity men are
not all alike. But what do fra
ternities and eating clubs con
tribute to this campus? In my
opinion they erect artificial
barriers to the complete and
free intellectual and social ex
change among Stanford stu
dents. Groups include some
people and leave other people
out. They restrict us, perhaps
subtly, perhaps only occa
sionally. but they do limit the
