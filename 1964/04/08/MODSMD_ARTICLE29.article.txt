## Viet Nam: We Have The Most To Offer

printing full-color pictures ((laming color, one says) of Buddhist
monks burning themselves in the streets of Saigon, the implication
being that such w as the extent of governmental oppression in Vict
Nam that no lesser form of protest would have been sufficient.
"Life,' though, ma\ have made the mistake of taking at face
\alue everything it saw. anil seeing what looked like a good news

further in October. 1963, and the transcript ot testimony it re

THE HUMAN PYRES, according to witnesses before the UN
group, were protesting the governments prevention of equal prac
tice of all religions. But it also appears from the testimony that
this discrimination depended on the particular Buddhist sect in
volved, and there was usually more favoritism toward Catholicism
! than persecution of Buddhism.
Most revealing, is the testimony dealing with the actual im
! molations. One young monk told of having been approached by
I a student w ho related many alleged atrocities by the government,
; and asked him to sacrifice himself in protest. The monk accepted,
and some time later, "the student came to see me again and at
| that time he told me that the Buddhist Association had changed
| its name and affiliation. The new Association worked for the eom
! munists."
The young monk was then told of plans to stage his "protest
for the benefit of the UN mission, how he would be given gaso
line-soaked robes, driven into the restricted area in a car with a
special sticker, given pain-killers and matches, and left to light
the fire himself.
He was next given three letters to sign: one to Diem, one to
the Chief Monk, and one to the UN, all alleging persecution of
the Buddhists and stating this as the reason for his suicide. On
the morning of the fateful day, however, government security
forces learned of the plan and stopped its execution.

OTHER TESTIMONY points out the ease with winch anyone
can become a monk, the many types of monks there are, and the
! subsequent ease with which Communist elements could to an e\-
; tent exploit the already tense situation.
Most of the genuine Buddhists, though, testify to their sym
pathy with tin* government, and opposition to Communism. There
is hope, though no prospect of a quick solution.
We could heed in this situation the late Ngo Dinh Diem, con
demning acceptance of a certain balance of strength and conform
ing in policy to that. "It is this 'conformist' policy," he said, "which
is usually called a 'realistic policy. . . . When we are faced with
an unfavorable balance of strength, we should strive tow ard break
ing this balance and making it favorable to us.
I believe we have more to offer Viet Nam than does Commu
nism, and I believe the Vietnamese are willing to be convinced
of this. The beginnings of a successful policy here must be a
determination to win the war, in conjunction with a prolonged
effort to win the Vietnamese people away from Communism. We
can afford to do no less.

He was next given three letters to sign: one to Diem, one to

THE HUMAN PYRES, according to witnesses before the UN
group, were protesting the governments prevention of equal prac
tice of all religions. But it also appears from the testimony that
this discrimination depended on the particular Buddhist sect in
volved, and there was usually more favoritism toward Catholicism
! than persecution of Buddhism.
Most revealing, is the testimony dealing with the actual im
! molations. One young monk told of having been approached by
I a student w ho related many alleged atrocities by the government,
; and asked him to sacrifice himself in protest. The monk accepted,
and some time later, "the student came to see me again and at
| that time he told me that the Buddhist Association had changed
| its name and affiliation. The new Association worked for the eom
