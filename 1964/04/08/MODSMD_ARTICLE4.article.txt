## Charity Marks New Spirit 
### WILEY RAMEN 
! "No sudden reunions should be
j expected, but good progress has
I already been made. A new a'mos
! phere and a new charity have
; been created, and, when one has
charity, one can expect miracles."
Thus, Father Bernard Leeming
set the tone of last night's Ecu
menical Dialogue, the second in
the current Tuesday Evening Lec
ture Series, in which Dr. Daniel
Jenkins also participated. Dr. Jen
kins, a Britisher, presented the
Protestant view of the current
ecumenical movement among
Catholics and Protestants, and
stressed the many things which
he felt Protestants have or could
learn from Catholicism.
"PROTESTANTS must move
out of their shells of isolationism
and grasp the sense of catholicity
I which has characterized the
i Roman Catholic Church in the
past," said Dr. Jenkins in his en
dorsement of thee c u m en i c a 1
| movement.
For his part, Father Leeming,
! also a Britisher, in presenting a
Catholic viewpoint, endorsed a
, feeling of humility and charity
I which he said was helped greatly
j by the late Jope John XXIII. "We
j don't want to decide who was
I wrong or right, just to come to
gether and end our divisions,"
said Father Leeming paraphras
ing Pope John.
BOTH MEN emphasized the
i positive aspects of the possibility
of reunification of the Christian
world, but at the same time were
cautiously unwilling to speculate
on any date for such an event.
