# RUSH RULES
## The 						Fraternities Speak 
### MIKE ROSTER 
Last Monday, the IFC first announced proposed
clianges in next year's rush program. The new
program would call for rush begun in the fall and
running throughout the year. The following are
some of the general reactions fraternity presidents
and rush chairmen have had:
Alpha Delta Phi, Bill Scattery: I would like to
be more familiar with them (the rush changes),
but it looks like a change for the better.
Alpha Sigma Phi, Randy Willard: Such a sys
tem, although it will have definite advantages to
both the freshmen and to the fraternities, will also
be a severe strain on both the houses and the
freshmen. My general attitude is we have reserva
tions and will have to consider it very seriously
before we can express approval.
Alpha Tan Omieron, Ed Ptacek: I don't think
that all the proposals should be put inlu effect next
year, but gradually instead. I think we should de
crease the pressure of rush by more natural rela
tionships.
Beta Chi, Shannon Clyne: The principal weak
ness is the way in which spring rush is handled
The schedule of parties doesn't really take the
pressure off the freshmen; it only prolongs the
agony and it doubles the pressure on the fraternity
members.

Chi ISi, Dunne Clapp: It would be a darn good
idea. I think it's long overdue.
Delia Chi, Pete McCreight: It will bear some
eiose consideration and analysis, but in the long
run the IFC in cooperation with the University
will be able to work out something more con
structive than this year's rush program. As the
proposal stands, it definitely needs some modifica
t ion.
Delia I psilon, Tom Fortmann: This proposal
would amount to an extension of dirty rushing for
one full year. It would be a preposterous waste of
time, money and effort by forcing the fraternities
to become full time rushing units.
IMii Delia Tlieta, Phil Zongker: The system we
have right now is just as good as the one they are
proposing, if not better. The new system will be
knock down, drag out all year.
I'lil Gamma Delia, Carey Cook: It's a contro
versial proposal, and I hope every house will look
closely at it before voting. We intend to do this
during this week.
Phi kappa INI, Jim Larson: The limited contact
during fall quarter will put too much pressure on
all year.
Tlieta ("111, Martin Gibson! Generally there is
no strong objection; we just don't think it will ac
complish what it intends to. It will he more expen
sive in the long run.

will be able to work out something more con
structive than this year's rush program. As the
proposal stands, it definitely needs some modifica
t ion.
Delia I psilon, Tom Fortmann: This proposal
would amount to an extension of dirty rushing for
one full year. It would be a preposterous waste of
time, money and effort by forcing the fraternities
to become full time rushing units.
IMii Delia Tlieta, Phil Zongker: The system we
have right now is just as good as the one they are
proposing, if not better. The new system will be
knock down, drag out all year.
I'lil Gamma Delia, Carey Cook: It's a contro
versial proposal, and I hope every house will look
closely at it before voting. We intend to do this
during this week.
Phi kappa INI, Jim Larson: The limited contact
during fall quarter will put too much pressure on
all year.
Tlieta ("111, Martin Gibson! Generally there is
no strong objection; we just don't think it will ac
complish what it intends to. It will he more expen
sive in the long run.
Last Monday, the IFC first announced proposed
clianges in next year's rush program. The new
program would call for rush begun in the fall and
running throughout the year. The following are
some of the general reactions fraternity presidents
and rush chairmen have had:
Alpha Delta Phi, Bill Scattery: I would like to
be more familiar with them (the rush changes),
but it looks like a change for the better.
Alpha Sigma Phi, Randy Willard: Such a sys
tem, although it will have definite advantages to
both the freshmen and to the fraternities, will also
be a severe strain on both the houses and the
freshmen. My general attitude is we have reserva
tions and will have to consider it very seriously
before we can express approval.
Alpha Tan Omieron, Ed Ptacek: I don't think
that all the proposals should be put inlu effect next
year, but gradually instead. I think we should de
crease the pressure of rush by more natural rela
tionships.
Beta Chi, Shannon Clyne: The principal weak
ness is the way in which spring rush is handled
The schedule of parties doesn't really take the
pressure off the freshmen; it only prolongs the
agony and it doubles the pressure on the fraternity
members.

Chi ISi, Dunne Clapp: It would be a darn good
idea. I think it's long overdue.
Delia Chi, Pete McCreight: It will bear some
eiose consideration and analysis, but in the long
run the IFC in cooperation with the University
will be able to work out something more con
structive than this year's rush program. As the
proposal stands, it definitely needs some modifica
