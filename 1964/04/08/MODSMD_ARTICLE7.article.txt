# Ibsen's 'Rosmersholm' Will Open Tomorrow
## 
### 
IJcnrik Ibsen's rarely performed masterpiece, Kosmersliolm,
| will be the Stanford Players' first production for spring quarter.
The play opens tomorrow night at 8:30 in the Little Theater. It
will'be repeated. Friday and Saturday and April 15th through 18th.
Dr. James Kerans, professor of dramatic literature in the Stan-

j ford Speech and Drama
i ment, will direct the production.
KERANS, who is currently
writing a critical study ol' Ibsen's
plays, calls the work "One of lb-
I sen's fiercest, most ironic denun
ciations of his society. In the tex-1
jture of the play are one of his I
; most dense and subtle dramas,'
and two of the great roles of the j
nineteenth century theater."
Rosmersholm is not the social
I problem play which students cus
tomarily expect of Ibsen. Rather,
j the drama probes the problems of
a woman's guilt and dissects the
! fears of a man struggling to over
come inhibiting traditions.
Tickets will be sold at the Tre
! sidder Box Office and the door of
j Little Theatre. eGneral admission
is SI.OO. students 75 cents.
