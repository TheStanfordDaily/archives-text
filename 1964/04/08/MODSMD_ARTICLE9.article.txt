ford Linear Accelerator."
The permit was approved by the
county planning commission on
March 9, with the condition that
the 220,000 volt line be erected
on tubular steel poles, and not
120-foot towers.
WOODSIDE residents fighting
overhead lines appealed to th e
Board of Supervisors to withdraw
the permit and force tlie Atomic
Energy Commission either to fur
nish underground lines or take
legal action to obtain the land
needed for overhead lines.
The AEC has indicated that if

stead of the less offensive 63-foot
poles.

San Mateo County Manager E. R.
Stallings told the Daily that "the
supervisors felt they had ade
quate information from the in
vestigation by Ihe planning com
mission." on which to decide

"many new factors of evidence
have entered into the picture since

ning commission."
