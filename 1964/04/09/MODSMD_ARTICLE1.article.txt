Douglas Mac Arthur, in a secret interview,
was quoted yesterday as saying the Chinese
Communists entered the Korean War "after
being assured by the British that Mac-Arthur

crushed them but was circumvented by the

"By accident, he said, Truman was in In

invaded the south and he 'reacted instinctively,
like the gutter fighter he is—and you've got
to admire him.'"
