# FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING
## Mississippi Profs Summon Educators 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN Feature Editor 
Two letters, one under the letterhead of
COFO I Council of Federated Organizations),
a civil rights coordinating agency composed
of all civil rights groups working within the
state of Mississippi, and the second written
by a group of professors at the University
of Mississippi, were mailed today to univer
sity faculty members all over the nation,
urging them to come to Mississippi this sum
mer to participate in COFO's "Operation
Mississippi," a massive attempt, involving
such programs as freedom schools, commu
nity centers, and voter registration, to bring
civil rights to all citizens of Mississippi, re
gardless of race.
"We wish to emphasize to faculty mem
bers of other universities the value of visits
to Mississippi," the letter written by the
University of Mississippi professors begins.
"Such visits can lead to solidly based knowl
edge and understanding of the situation here
. . . Professors who look at the problem and
talk with those in Mississippi who confront
this problem daily will be better able to tell

■the facts about Mississippi."
"IT IS OF VITAL importance," the pro
fessors' letter continues, "that the facts l>e
made known, because the state is such a cru
cial testing ground in the struggle to expand
and improve American democracy. All of
us are willing to talk with visitors and to
recommend others with whom they should
talk. We are also willing to answer questions
of professors who are interested in going to
Mississippi."
AH hough Mendy Sampstein of COFO was
unable to give the names of the University
of Mississippi professors who wrote the let
ter in a long distance call to Jackson, because
of the alleged possibility of the taping of
the phone conversation, he did note that Pro
fessor William Silver, critic of Mississippi's
"closed society," was one of the signers and
that the writers represented a wide range of
departments in the university.
The COFO letter states that the existing
situation in Mississippi shows that political
and social justice cannot be won in that state
without massive aid from outside. The letter
cites the invitalion to university faculty as
". . . an effort to involve the intellectual
community in America's most serious social

problem—racial discrimination."
Professors who go to Mississippi will
have the opportunity to work in four differ
ent project areas -as observers writing com
mentaries for university and news publica
tions, as lecturers at staff seminars, as direc
tors of research projects, as political ad
visors, writing speeches and campaign litera
ture, and leading seminars for election work
ers.
It is important that COFO know within
a short time the interests, skills, and num
ber of volunteers who will be in Mississippi
this summer, in order to plan more precisely
the projected programs, the letter empha
sizes.
The COFO letter is signed by Dr. Aaron
Henry, COFO President and State NAACP
President; Robert Moses, SNCC Mississippi
Project Director and COFO Program Direc
tor, and Dave Dennis, CORE Field Secretary
aand Assistant COFO Program Director.
