# Reform Crusade
## 
### 
The parents of Kit Malkin,
a Stanford graduate student
who was killed last November
in a Palo Alto auto crash, are
here from Canada on a cru
sade for reform.
Robert C. Malkin and his
wife want California to tough
en its laws against drunk
drivers and uninsured drivers.
Malkin, unsuccessful in an
earlier attempt to see Gov
ernor Brown, wishes to pre
sent a petition circulated hy
friends and former associates
of his son at Stanford, fol
lowing the death of his sou
and a fellow student in an
automobile accident, last No
vember.
Christopher Malkin anil
John Barth, two biology
graduate stud en t s, were
rammed broadside by another
auto which ran a red light
at University and Middlefield.
The driver of the other car,
K. G. Davis of Burlingame,
was booked on a felony drunk
driving charge after the ac
cident. In court he pleaded
guilty to two manslaughter
counts and was sentenced to
a year in jail.
Malkin believes that sterner
penalties for killing two

people while being drunk are
necessary.
"After conferring with of
ficials and citizens in Califor
nia, we have arrived at sev
eral conclusions," says Mal
kin. a lumber firm operator
in Vancouver:
1. A mandatory blood test.
(Honald Davis exercised the
current legal right in Cali
fornia to refuse to submit to
such a test.)
2. Compulsory insurance of
a similiar type to that up
north.
H. Control and checking of
drivers' licenses, "112 am in
formed that thousands drive
without licenses."
Malkin hopes to see the
Governor personally, to en
courage him to push for more
rigorous drunk driving con
trols at the next meeting of
th< k legislature.
Malkin summed up his
views: "The increasing num
ber of cars on the highway
in recent years and eonse
queii increased hazards of
driving demand either a re
vision of parts of the Vehicle
Code or their more stringent
enforcement, or both, in an
effort to make driving as safe
as possible."
