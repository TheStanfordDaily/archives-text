# Jedd Creates Controversy With Modern Art Exhibition
## 
### BOB COX 
Stanford's administrative center, Encina Hall, has ventured
into the field of modern art. In a bold attempt to stimulate inter
est and excitement in tin's enigmatic field, Joseph Jedd, Director
of Student Accounts, and K. D. Greigliton of the Controller's
Office, originated Enema's series of art exhibits.
On Creighton s suggestion that they brighten up the walls a

bit, Jedd went to the Stanford
Art. Department. Jedd was en
thusiastically received in his re
quest for the temporary loan of
some paintings, but arrangements
were somehow confused, and no
paintings were produced. He
turned to the outside world and a
well known Palo Alto artist, Mrs.
Ralph Dicker.
MRS. I) I C K IS It was kind
enough to lend some of her mod
ernistic works for a period of two
months at no charge. Her paint
ings proved quite controversial,
but a new exhibitor, Miss Lynn
Bostick. who then replaced Mrs.
Dicker in March seems sure to
outdo her.
Miss Bostick received her IVIA
from Stanford University in 1963
and served as a teaching assist
ant during the school year 1962-
63.
She says the following of her
paintings: "The landscape is rep

resented in my painting through
color and form to express the
shapes and proportions, I he move
ment and texture, the space and
solidity of natural forms as they
arc affected by sunlight."
>II*S BOSTICK'S paintings
now adorn the walls of Encina
Hall from Cashier's Office to
Ladies' Lounge. Jedd mentioned
that many of the employees who
had expressed dislike of Mr s.
Dicker's paintings now wished
them back, after having seen
those of Miss Bostick.
But Jedd takes a remarkably
serene and optimistic view of the
state of affairs he has created.
He himself was quite fond of
Mrs. Dicker's paintings and is
equally so of Miss Bostick's. Jedd
expresed gratitude to the Stan
ford Art Department and Keith
Boyle, from whom he first learned
of Miss Bostick.
Miss Bostick's paintings are
scheduled to bo taken down in the
near future. The Stanford Art De
partment has promised to provide
Jedd with a continual supply of
the work of Stanford graduate
students working for their MA
in art.
Jedd has certainly accomplished
his object of stimulating discus
sion and enthusiasm (be it pro
or con) among the employees and
visitors of Encina. He now looks
forward eagerly to giving s t u
dents further chance to exhibit
their skills. Jedd's office, 144 En
cina, is open to those who are in
terested.

Mrs. Dicker's paintings and is
equally so of Miss Bostick's. Jedd
expresed gratitude to the Stan
ford Art Department and Keith
Boyle, from whom he first learned
of Miss Bostick.
Miss Bostick's paintings are
scheduled to bo taken down in the
near future. The Stanford Art De
partment has promised to provide
Jedd with a continual supply of
the work of Stanford graduate
students working for their MA
in art.
Jedd has certainly accomplished
his object of stimulating discus
sion and enthusiasm (be it pro
or con) among the employees and
visitors of Encina. He now looks
forward eagerly to giving s t u
dents further chance to exhibit
their skills. Jedd's office, 144 En
cina, is open to those who are in
terested.
Stanford's administrative center, Encina Hall, has ventured
into the field of modern art. In a bold attempt to stimulate inter
est and excitement in tin's enigmatic field, Joseph Jedd, Director
of Student Accounts, and K. D. Greigliton of the Controller's
Office, originated Enema's series of art exhibits.
On Creighton s suggestion that they brighten up the walls a

bit, Jedd went to the Stanford
Art. Department. Jedd was en
thusiastically received in his re
quest for the temporary loan of
some paintings, but arrangements
were somehow confused, and no
paintings were produced. He
turned to the outside world and a
well known Palo Alto artist, Mrs.
Ralph Dicker.
MRS. I) I C K IS It was kind
enough to lend some of her mod
ernistic works for a period of two
months at no charge. Her paint
ings proved quite controversial,
but a new exhibitor, Miss Lynn
Bostick. who then replaced Mrs.
Dicker in March seems sure to
outdo her.
Miss Bostick received her IVIA
from Stanford University in 1963
and served as a teaching assist
ant during the school year 1962-
63.
She says the following of her
paintings: "The landscape is rep

resented in my painting through
color and form to express the
shapes and proportions, I he move
ment and texture, the space and
solidity of natural forms as they
arc affected by sunlight."
>II*S BOSTICK'S paintings
now adorn the walls of Encina
Hall from Cashier's Office to
Ladies' Lounge. Jedd mentioned
that many of the employees who
had expressed dislike of Mr s.
Dicker's paintings now wished
them back, after having seen
those of Miss Bostick.
But Jedd takes a remarkably
serene and optimistic view of the
state of affairs he has created.
