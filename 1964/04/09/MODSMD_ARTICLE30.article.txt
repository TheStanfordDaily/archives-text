# DISARMAMENT
## Russ Stand Precludes Negotiation 
### RICHARD WEINIG Member Young Republicans 
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is tlie
second in two articles being
published this week as a pre
lude to Saturday's disarma
ment conference.

Senator Barry Gold water is nol
particularly interested in how we
may disarm more rapidly. He
asks, rather, il' disarmament ne
gotiations are desirable at all.
Goldwater's reasoning bears
consideration.
He contends that genuine dis
armament, like marriage or re
conciliation, requires the assent
of two partners: in this case, the
United States and the Soviet
Union. The armed hordes of world
communism will neither become
less hostile nor melt away merely
because we wish they would. The
Soviet Union is not likely to cast
aside its aims without first dis
carding the reasons which prompt
their maintenance.
What, then, is the rationale
which undergirds both the pres
ent Soviet military posture and
Soviet disarmament proposals?
(.1) The massive Soviet mili
tary juggernaut stems, not from
defensive concern, but aggres
sive intent. Purely defensive con
siderations cannot justify m a i n
tenance on the Western front of
a Soviet advantage of better than
two to one in ground troops, with
probable parity in tactical nuclear
weapons and superiority in mobil
ity.

KHRUSHCHEV rea 1 i/es—even
if the West does not—that he is
at war with the United States and
has been for the last twenty
years.
Khrushchev intends to win this
war. His quarrel with the Red
Chinese is not whether to destroy
the West but how to do so most
effectively. To wit:
We are united by a common
struggle for the victory of com
munism: we have the same aim,
the same aspirations, the same
hopes . . . The Soviet people
have done and will do every
thing in our power to . . . in
sure the victory . . . of commu
nism throughout the world.
(I'ravda. July 14, 1963).
(2) In the speech generally re
garded as Khrushchev's Mein
Kampf that of January 6, 1961
the Premier was explicit in ex
plaining that the West could be
overcome only by construction of
Soviet forces so powerful that if
the Free World could not be inti
midated into surrender, it could
be bludgeoned into submission.
<3» In the same policy speech,
Khrushchev informed the high
est planning bodies of the Soviet
Communist Party that any dis
armament negotiations which he
entered into were but part of "an
active struggle against imperial
ism (the Free World) for restrict
ing its military capabilities" with
out impairing those of the Soviet
Union. He has yet to retract this
view.

(4) TO CLARIFY his intent
yet further, Khrushchev rarely
speaks of disarmament without
making it perfectly clear that he I
is following the "Leninist" con-'
cept of disarmament. Lenin was
rather explicit about the whole
affair:
Disarmament is the ideal of
socialism (communism). In so
cialist (communist) society
there will be no war and dis
armament will l>e realized.
However, he who expects to
achieve disarmament without
social revolution and the dicta
torship of the proletariat is not
a socialist. Dictatorship is state
authority resting directly upon
violence. Violence in the Twen
tieth century ... is neither a
fist nor a club, but an army.
Only after the proletariat has
disarmed the bourgeoise will it
be able, without betraying its
world-historic mission, to throw
all armaments on the scrap
heap: the proletariat will
undoubtedly do this, but only
after this condition has been
fulfilled and under no circum
stances before it." (Sochcniniia.
XIX. 313,300.)
Thus, when Khrushchev speaks
of his passionate devotion to the
goal of disarmament, he is only
telling his comrades-in-arms that
the Soviet Union will not disarm
until I lie forces of capitalism have
been vanquished and the world
placed under communist domina
tion.
So long as Khrushchev's posi
tion remains unchanged. Senator
Goldwater sees nothing to be
gained and. possibly, much to be
lost by negotiating the matter
v ith him.
