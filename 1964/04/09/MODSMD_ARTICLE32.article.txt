## More Effective Deterrence From Certain Retaliation 
### 
j Editor, The Daily:
At least one point in Mr. Sueh's
I article, "Motives for War Vanish,"
needs further discussion. It con
cerns the relation of deterrence to
real means of retaliation. Mr.
Such claims that "the nuclear de
terrence would work, and work
more satisfactorily than it ever
| did when it really existed." He
i means here, I think, that a prime
obstacle to a disarmed world.
I mutual distrust, could be the key
; to a disarmed world.
In addition to worrying about
the Soviet Union's hidden weap
ons, we should keep in mind the
Soviet Union's worry about our
hidden weapons. The law-provid
ing fear of real weapons in an
; armed world would become a law
i providing fear of hidden weapons
in a disarmed world.
This does not seem certain to
me. The deterrence of possible re
taliation may not be as effective
as the deterrence of certain relax
ation. Either side may decide to
take a chance-—a chance it does
not now have—on subduing th e
other side without reprisal or at
least with only limited reprisal.
The aggressor would in effect
be gambling on his ability to hide
weapons, much as aggressors
through history have gambled
on their ability to produce weap
ons. And we would again be at
the stage where victories could
be measured in terms of the mar
gin of Underkilled, that is, in
terms of surviving men, institu
tions, and property. At the pres
ent time. I believe, there is no
gamble (at least in the direct con
frontation of the major powers);
for there would be no margin of
Underkilled and thus no margin
of victory.

• America's Greatness
Editor, The Daily:
Mi\ Darryl R. Wold, in com
menting on Lord Bert rand Rus
sell's taped statement on Viet
nam, tells us that Lord Russell
doesn't think that our principles
are "worth the price." This seems
to me to be a rather strange way
of stating the case.
Lord Russell advocated Amer
ica's stopping of the war in Viet
nam partly in order that the great
suffering undergone by the people
of Vietnam through the many
years of war could be brought to
an end. Mr. Wold is willing to
"pay the price" when the price is
primarily the lives of people
whom he has never seen, i.e.,
Vietnamese.
However, there is a larger ques
tion involved. When Mr. Wold
asks if principles are "worth the
price" he is not speaking in the
limited context of Vietnam.
Rather he is speaking of the en
tire world situation.
He asks us not to worry about
saving our material wealth, which
he assumes would be destroyed in
an all out war. Instead he asks us
to save our principles which he
seems to think can be defended
by war or at least the threat of
war.
This, however, is very question
able. To me the reason that Amer
ica is a great nation is that
j America values the worth, dig
j nity and freedom of each individ
ual human being. For this prin
ciple to be consistant it must be
'applied not only in America but

| throughout the world.
Therefore, it seems to me 1o be
a contradiction to say that we can
defend our principles by destroy
ing or threating to destroy even
one human being, let alone mil
lions.
In placing this value on human
I worth I have never felt that I was
j being "reduced to a quivering or
: ganism fleeing in an animal re
| flex before the possibility of de
| struction."

• Plaza Fountain
j Editor, The Daily:
I would like to express my ad-
I miration and appreciation for Mr.
j Demetrios' inspiring and sincere
| work, which, it seems to me. adds
! a previously lacking dimension to
the pleasant atmosphere of the
Stanford architectural complex—
that of imagination and style.
The fact that some Stanford
students are motivated to hang
toilet paper, christmas-tree orna
ments, and wooden planks in
scribed with the names of fra
ternities on the new fountain,
however, indicates to me that
there are some individuals among
us who are relatively uncomfort
able because of the unfamilar,
new presence on White Memorial
Plaza.
To reassure these students and
to accommodate their tastes and
needs, perhaps additional funds
could be secured to build a jungle
gym and wading pool for their
restricted use on the Plaza near
the fountain.
The only reasonable alternative
I can conceive of would be for the
University to offer weekly excur
sions to the de Young Museum
and Palace of the Legion of Honor
| in San Francisco, provide th e
i participants with colored crayons,
! tissue paper, and marking pen
{ eils, and let them mark and de
face to their hearts' content.

• Corrections
Editor, The Daily:
Things are going to be pretty
confused around here next fall
if we introduce three out of five
new faculty appointments wit h
their names misspelled.
For the record, we have ap
pointed Dr. Julius Margolis of
the University of California, an
expert in the economics of public
| investment, as professor of engi
neering economics in the De
partments of Civil Engineering
and Economics.
We also have Prof. Michael J.
Boudart in chemical engineering
and chemistry, and Prof. Kaarlo
J. J. Ilintikka in philosophy.
Prof. Claude M. Simpson, Coo
professor of American Literature,
and Prof. Lan P. Watt in the Eng
lish Department are off to a good
} start. Their names were right.
