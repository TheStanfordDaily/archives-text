# PLAY REVIEW
## Plays Treat Problem Of Contact 
### FOSTER HIRSCH Drama Editor 
Modern theatre, like the other
forms of modern art, is absorbed
with the problem of communica
tion. In their current presenta
tion, Act and Idea has selected to
perform two short avant-garde
plays which cleverly and intelli
gently deal with this persistent
theme.
The first play, The Zoo Story
jby Edward Albee. resolves its
theme in the form of a conflict be-
I tween an archetype of the self
i satisfied, self-contained middle
i class businessman and an arche
| type of the disconnected, alien
ated young man who wanders
; forlornly on the fringe of an an
j tagonistie society.
As the businessman Peter sits
I complacently on a park bench,
; which he has assigned to himself,
jhe is approached by the young
I man Jerry who awkwardly b u 1
insistently pursues a conversation
with him. With increasing des
peration, Jerry tries to reach out
!to Peter; in an effort to involve
I Peter in his life, Jerry describes
to him the emptiness and horror
: of his anonymous existence in a
j dingy boardinghouse, and he tells
j the sad, absurdly comic story of
i his attempt to "make contact"
{with a flog.
★ ★ ★
TO BREAK DOWN Peter's wall
of passivity, Jerry provokes him
j into an argument over possession
of the park bench; ho cleverly
contrives to get Peter to stick a
knife into his stomach, for to
j die at the hands of another person
is most certainly a form of eon
tact. Having achieved this con-
J tact, Jerry no longer feels iso
lated. and he can die in triumph.
The play is shot through with
flashes of black humor and yet
•: the effort of the whole is one of
! disturbing seriousness. The fa-
| miliar theme is given a sense of
■ urgency and vitality by the auda
city, wit, and originality of Mr.
, Albee's prose.
The Stanford production, under
Sean Cunningham's direction, has
captured both the play's grim
ness and bizarre humor. Conrad
Bishop plays Jerry with the
proper tinge of madness and des
j peration, and he builds the tension
with a sure sense of momentum.
Dale Wilson does quite well as
Peter; his character is precisely
as irritating as he should bo, and
both he and Mr. Bishop generate
considerable excitement in their
struggle for possession of th e
bench.
★ ★ ★
THE SECOND offering, Eu
; gene lonesco's Bald Soprano,
states its theme in terms of farce.
In keeping with the tenet of the
theatre of the absurd, lonesco
demonstrates directly rather than
intellectualiz.es about the chasms
which separate people in a frus
trated and perhaps meaningless
world.
To indicate that people either
have nothing important to say to
each other or are simply unable
to relate. lonesco has his char
acters, by turns, speak trivia or
mere gibberish or entirely uncon
nected discourse.
The Stanford company succeeds
in realizing the irrational free
dom, the impudent orneriness,
and the wild hilarity of lonesco's
universe. It is briskly directed by
Sean Cunningham, who has seen
to it that the pace and the non
sense are relentless.
Carolyn White, though she has
difficulty in remembering her
British accent, is a delight as the
I domestic, loquacious, and exasper
ating Mrs. Smith; Jack Schmidt
complements her well as the re
strained and mildly exasperated
Mr. Smith.

moments as the coy and exceed
ingly peculiar maid, and Joe May
shark is appropriately blank as
the Fire Chief, who, most amus
ingly. makes an appearance for
no immediately discernible rea

THE SECOND offering, Eu
; gene lonesco's Bald Soprano,
states its theme in terms of farce.
In keeping with the tenet of the
theatre of the absurd, lonesco
demonstrates directly rather than
intellectualiz.es about the chasms
which separate people in a frus
trated and perhaps meaningless
world.
To indicate that people either
have nothing important to say to
each other or are simply unable
to relate. lonesco has his char
acters, by turns, speak trivia or
mere gibberish or entirely uncon
nected discourse.
The Stanford company succeeds
in realizing the irrational free
dom, the impudent orneriness,
and the wild hilarity of lonesco's
universe. It is briskly directed by
Sean Cunningham, who has seen
to it that the pace and the non
sense are relentless.
Carolyn White, though she has
difficulty in remembering her
British accent, is a delight as the
I domestic, loquacious, and exasper
ating Mrs. Smith; Jack Schmidt
complements her well as the re
strained and mildly exasperated
Mr. Smith.

perform two short avant-garde
plays which cleverly and intelli

The first play, The Zoo Story

I tween an archetype of the self
i satisfied, self-contained middle
i class businessman and an arche

ated young man who wanders

I complacently on a park bench,
; which he has assigned to himself,
jhe is approached by the young
I man Jerry who awkwardly b u 1
insistently pursues a conversation
with him. With increasing des
peration, Jerry tries to reach out

j peration, and he builds the tension
with a sure sense of momentum.
Dale Wilson does quite well as
Peter; his character is precisely
as irritating as he should bo, and
both he and Mr. Bishop generate
considerable excitement in their
struggle for possession of th e
bench.

THE SECOND offering, Eu
; gene lonesco's Bald Soprano,
states its theme in terms of farce.
In keeping with the tenet of the
theatre of the absurd, lonesco
demonstrates directly rather than
intellectualiz.es about the chasms
which separate people in a frus
trated and perhaps meaningless
world.
To indicate that people either
have nothing important to say to
each other or are simply unable
to relate. lonesco has his char
acters, by turns, speak trivia or
mere gibberish or entirely uncon
nected discourse.
The Stanford company succeeds
in realizing the irrational free
dom, the impudent orneriness,
and the wild hilarity of lonesco's
universe. It is briskly directed by
Sean Cunningham, who has seen
to it that the pace and the non
sense are relentless.
Carolyn White, though she has
difficulty in remembering her
British accent, is a delight as the
I domestic, loquacious, and exasper
ating Mrs. Smith; Jack Schmidt
complements her well as the re
strained and mildly exasperated
Mr. Smith.

AS THE MARTINS, "friends"
who drop by for a devastating
evening of prattle and inanities
and who stay to take over the
humdrum life of the Smiths, El
len Headley, a charming, clever
comedienne, and Jack Mayor, who
most happily looks and acts very
much like Jacques Tati, are splen
did. Ann Munro h;is a few bright
moments as the coy and exceed
ingly peculiar maid, and Joe May
shark is appropriately blank as
the Fire Chief, who, most amus
ingly. makes an appearance for
no immediately discernible rea
son.
This very pifne program plays
lonight through Saturday at the
Nightery. The seating capacity is
the utmost in intimacy, so bo sure
to report well ahead of the 8:30
curtain iti order to be assured of
a sent. Admission is free,
