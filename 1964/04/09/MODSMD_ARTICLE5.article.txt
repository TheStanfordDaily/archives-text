# Cal Law Teacher Resigns
## 'Administration Is Insensitive' 
### 
The current protest by San
Francisco State College profes
sors against "oppressive" state
wide administration hit hard else
where when UC-Berkele> La w
Professor Geoffrey Hazard an
nounced he will resign "for the
same reason." Hazard made this
surprise announcement during an
interview on the S.F. State dis
pute.
He stated I hat his reason for
leaving was "no big, complicated
thing": he said he used to look
out his window and see the Cam
panili, but that now all he sees
is a huge hulk of concrete which
will soon be the Environmental
Design Building. "The University
is like that building," lie said, "too
big, too crass, and its purpose not
all together clear."
Hazard said he will go to the
University of Chicago at the end
of this semester.
He blasted the California Mas
ter Plan for Higher Education;
he said it. was "running this Uni
versity into the ground." He
didn't think the University could
ever handle as many students as
the Master Plan calls for. "There
just isn't enough high quality
teaching which can be persuaded
to come here."
Turning to the S.F. State dis
pute, Hazard said the faculty
there has a good program, and
is an ambitious and articulate
group. He then stated, "The mea
sure of dissatisfaction a faculty
is willing to express is a measure
of its quality. There are certainly
signs of great strength and health
at S.F. State."
The majority of S.F. State pro
fessors several weeks ago signed
a petition charging that the
statewide administration was
"not fighting hard enough for
funds." The petition also called
for an investigation of the State
College Board of Trustees by
Sacramento.
Hazard accused t lie statewide
administration of being insensi
tive to frontline problems because
it does not have time to attend
to all the details and is unwilling
to delegate authority. "1 think
the University can be straight
ened out, Hazard said, "but not
if it continues this suicidal com
mitment to take more and more
students and try to force con
formity on its campuses."
