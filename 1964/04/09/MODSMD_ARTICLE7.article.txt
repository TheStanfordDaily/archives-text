# Ink-Blots And Artists
## 
### 
Dr. Robert E. Kantor, a Palo
Alto psychologist delivering the
second of the Spring Quarter
j Wednesday Lectures, described
the connections between art, am
j bivalence, and schizophrenia.
Dr. Kantor, a practicing psy
j chologist and staff member of the
| Mental Research Institute of the
Palo Alto Medical Foundation,
stated that, "Psychological health
and richness of perception go to
gether."
As evidence for the connection
between psychological health and
the artistic ability to resolve con
traditions between the impersonal
and the personal, the subjective
J and the objective, Dr. Kantor
alluded to his 1953 use of the
Rorschach ink-blot test to di s
, tinguish between types of schizo
; phrenia.
I Dr. Kantor discovered in these
: tests that the sickest perceptions
j "tended to be concrete, chaotic
1 in shape, and very simple or in-
I fantile," whereas the healthiest
perceptions were usually "com
! plex, elegant in shape and often
I abstract."
This Spring Quarter Lecture
lon Art, held in the Physics Lec
ture Hall, was co-sponsored by
the Stanford Art and Architecture
Department and the Committee
for Art at Stanford.
