## AAC Reverses Student Aid Stand 
### 
W ASHINGTON (CPS) — One of the nations largest college
organizations lias dramatically reversed its field to support a mas
sive federal aid program for U.S. college students.
The surprise came in testimony by the Association of American
Colleges (AAC) before a Senate Subcommittee holding hearings

lon a bill proposed by Sen. Vance - ?
! Hartke, D.-Ind.
The bill being considered would !
, liberalize the National Defense
Education Act (NDEA» i'or loans
I federal scholarships and govern
! menl insurance of private loans
I to students. It would also provide |
j a work-study program, similar to j
j the one proposed by President j
Johnson in his poverty message, i
AAC officials ha d previously
opposed the Hartke program.
But the group's president, the !
Very Rev. Edward B. Bunn, S.J., |
told the subcommittee that his!
organization solidly supported the !
basic features of the Hartke bill.;
The national organization rep-1
resents 84S colleges offering four- ]
year degree programs. Bunn is
President of Georgetown Univer-'
I sity.

Bunn said many members of his
organization have reluctantly
concluded thai a federal scholar
ship program "is indispensible to
realization of the principle of un
restricted educational opportun
ity,"
Bunn said members were polled
recently an d an overwhelming
majority voted for the four pro
visions. He described the Hartkc
bill as "an imaginative and com
prehensive attack on the problem
of student aid."
The AAC's traditional view.
Bunn said, has been that federal
aid is justified only when needed
to attain a goal of national im
portance not satisfactorily reach
able by state, local and private
action.
However, Bunn warned I h at.
there is a real danger that state
governments might be tempted to
cut back their own provisions for
scholarships and ultimately throw
the whole burden on the federal
government.
Bunn said the AAC still had
some misgivings about the bill.
He said one section of the bill
providing a cost of education al
lowance for colleges admitting
federal scholarship holders. Bunn
noted that the $350 payment
would be a "bounty" that would
tempt admissions to give first
consideration to scholarship stu
dents.
The AAC was also apprehen
sive, Bunn said, over the proposed
extension of the NDKA student
Joan program to two-year col
leges. The extension, he said,
would bring under the program
TOO to .Sito additional schools and
reduce the money available to
four-year colleges.
Bunn said the work-study pro
gram for students received th e
least favorable response from
members of his association. He
said they expressed fears that the
measure might foster sterile
"make-work" activities.
However. Bunn said many mem
bers hadn't read details of the
plan. He applauded the intention
of the bill to limit the work-study
programs to activities of "genu
ine educational value."

some misgivings about the bill.
He said one section of the bill
providing a cost of education al
lowance for colleges admitting
federal scholarship holders. Bunn
noted that the $350 payment
would be a "bounty" that would
tempt admissions to give first
consideration to scholarship stu
dents.
The AAC was also apprehen
sive, Bunn said, over the proposed
extension of the NDKA student
Joan program to two-year col
leges. The extension, he said,
would bring under the program
TOO to .Sito additional schools and
reduce the money available to
four-year colleges.
Bunn said the work-study pro
gram for students received th e
least favorable response from
members of his association. He
said they expressed fears that the
measure might foster sterile
"make-work" activities.
However. Bunn said many mem

of the bill to limit the work-study
programs to activities of "genu

W ASHINGTON (CPS) — One of the nations largest college
organizations lias dramatically reversed its field to support a mas
sive federal aid program for U.S. college students.
The surprise came in testimony by the Association of American
Colleges (AAC) before a Senate Subcommittee holding hearings

lon a bill proposed by Sen. Vance - ?
! Hartke, D.-Ind.
The bill being considered would !
, liberalize the National Defense
Education Act (NDEA» i'or loans
I federal scholarships and govern
! menl insurance of private loans
I to students. It would also provide |
j a work-study program, similar to j
j the one proposed by President j
Johnson in his poverty message, i
AAC officials ha d previously
opposed the Hartke program.
But the group's president, the !
Very Rev. Edward B. Bunn, S.J., |
told the subcommittee that his!
organization solidly supported the !
basic features of the Hartke bill.;
The national organization rep-1
resents 84S colleges offering four- ]
year degree programs. Bunn is
President of Georgetown Univer-'
I sity.

Bunn said many members of his
organization have reluctantly
concluded thai a federal scholar
ship program "is indispensible to
realization of the principle of un
restricted educational opportun
ity,"
Bunn said members were polled
recently an d an overwhelming
majority voted for the four pro
visions. He described the Hartkc
bill as "an imaginative and com
prehensive attack on the problem
of student aid."
The AAC's traditional view.
Bunn said, has been that federal
aid is justified only when needed
to attain a goal of national im
portance not satisfactorily reach
able by state, local and private
action.
However, Bunn warned I h at.
there is a real danger that state
governments might be tempted to
cut back their own provisions for
scholarships and ultimately throw
the whole burden on the federal
government.
