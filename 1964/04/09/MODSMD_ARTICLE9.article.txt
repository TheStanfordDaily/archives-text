# DISARMAMENT
## Kahn To Speak For IIR 
### 
Dr. Herman Kahn, world renowned physicist
and authority on thermonuclear war, will arrive
on campus today for a four day visit. Kahn,
formerly a military strategist for the RAND Cor
poration, is slated to deliver the keynote address
at the llR's Saturday conference. "Disarmament in
a Changing World."
Kahn, while preeminent in his field, is by n<>
means undisputed. Reacting to one of his books.
On Thermonuclear War, J. R. Newman, editor of
Scientific American, stated that the book is nothing
less than "a moral tract on mass murder: how to

plan it, how to commit it, how to
justify it." Newman continues:
"This evil and tenebrous book,
with its lose-lipped pieties and
its hay foot-si rawfoot logic, is
permeated with a blood-thirsty
irrationality such as I have not
seen in my years of reading."
Less critical was Max Lerner:
"Kahn has instructed, absorbed,
and shaken me, far more than
any writer in the field of military
strategy today."

Kahn will present his views on Saturday morn
ing in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, where the confer
ence will be held: he is a guest ol the Conference
Division of the 11R. During the noon break of tin

conference, students will be able to speak with the :
distinguished strategist at a coffee hour in Tresid-1
der Union. Kahn will reside on campus at the SAE ,
house.
The confluence, signups for which are being
taken this week at Engineering Corner and at thej
Post Office from <S a.m. to 1 p.m. for $1.50, con
cerns a topic which, according to chairman Warren !
Grimes, should be of interest to all students. The ,
afternoon session of the conference will discuss
the local economic effects of armaments spending,
a subject of particular concern to students seeking
employment.
Over nine per cent of all industrial employment
in California is in defense oriented industries, and
the figure runs higher in Washington, Alaska,
Virginia, and elsewhere. In certain local areas de
fense spending is crucial to economic prosperity.
Los Angeles, San Diego, Seattle. Boston, and Wash
ington. D.C. all qualify as areas of highly con- >
cent rated defense activities.
The panel discussing these problems is com
posed of the California state director of finance.
Hale Champion; a UAW regional director, Paul
Schrade; a vice president of Varian Associates, j
Emmett Cameron; a vice president of Lockheed
Aircraft Corporation. Dudley E. Brown; and mod
erator Carl SI over of (he Stanford Research Insti
tute.
