• Khrushchev Attacks Poking
BUDAPEST — Soviet Premier Khrushchev
declared yesterday Red China lias "maliciously
split the Communist movement" but predicted
its efforts will end "in shameful failure."
In a biting attack on Peking, he said the
Red Chinese answered Soviet conciliation
efforts by stepping up maneuvering to seize
the leadership of international communism.
"Under the coverup of Marxism-Leninism,
the Chinese leaders are trying to push the
Communist movement into a swamp of great-
Chinese chauvinism," he told a Soviet-Hun
garian friendship rally concluding his 10-day
visit to Hungary.
"The imperialists can rub their hands in
satisfaction," he continued. "The Chinese lead
ers have left the path of the revolutionary
class and base their policies on such elements
as the color of skin, race and continents."
This touched upon a common fear in the

Soviet bloc—that the Chinese will rally the
yellow race of Asia and the black race of
Africa against the white Communists—land
ing the movement beyond hope of ever restor
ing unity.
• Brazil's Military Purges Left
BRASILIA, Brazil — Brazilian armed
forces launched a drive yesterday apparently
aimed at sweeping extreme leftists from posi
tions of influence they enjoyed under Jouo
Goulart's administration.
The official text of the measure was not
made known, but it is understood to call for
termination of various forms of legal immun
ity and privileges held by Congressmen,
judges, professors and civil and military per
sonnel.
It also would suspend political parties
which permit known Communists and other
leftist extremists to run under their banners.
The Communist party is outlawed in Brazil,

though it flourished openly under Goulart's
regime.

• Kennedy Pleads Rights Hill
WASHINGTON — Sen. Edward M. Ken
nedy, D-Mass., invoked the memory of Presi
dent John F. Kennedy yesterday in an emo
tional appeal to the Senate for passage of the
civil rights bill.

Senate floor. Making his first speech since he
entered the Senate in January 1963, the young
est brother of the slain president spoke in a
voice that sometimes broke as he faltered and
struggled to control his emotions.
Tht 32-year-old senator said of the late
president's views: 'His heart and his soul are
in this bill. If his life and death had a mean
ing, it was that we should not hate but love
one another; we should use our powers not
to create conditions of oppression that lead to

violence, but conditions of fredom that lead
to peace."
