# Special Program Dropped
## Insufficient Funds Cause Changes 
### JIM SELNA 
The Administration has decided
to eliminate th e graduate pro
gram in Rhetoric and Public Ad
dress in the Speech and Drama
Department, The DAILY learned
yesterday.
Dean Richard Lyman, Assis
tant Dean of Arts and Sciences,
said that the University was not
prepared to make the larger out
lay of money and personnel which
would be necessary for a "major
committment." He further stated,
"We hope by concentrating on
the undergraduate level to do a
good job, and hold it at that."
PRESENTLY, students who
are working for doctorates in
speech are registered in the Grad
uate Special Programs. The ac
tion will not affect the position of
these graduates and their studies.
The doctorate in Rhetoric and
Public Address had been elimin
ated from the curriculum prior
to the present action.
According to Dr. Jon Erieson,
Acting Head of the speech divi
sion of the Speech and Drama
Department, the decision will
have some effect on the under
] graduate program as well.
Currently, five teaching assis
tants are used in the Speech 20
classes and in the Stanford de
bate program. Without these
teaching assistants from the grad
; uate department, Erieson said, it
i is questionable whether faculty
| direction will be given to the stu
| dent debate program.
THIS COULD have a major
affect on Stanford's eligibility in
numerous debate tournaments in
which the University now partic
ipates.
Arthur Hastings, an instructor
' in the department, has been ap-
I pointed assistant professor for
I the coming year. This is Hast
! ing's first year at Stanford. He
previously hold the position of
assistant professor at the Univer
i sity of Nevada.
Hastings told The DAILY that
i the action came as a "shock" to
i everyone in the Department." He
also said that there had not been
| a great deal of communication
between the Department and the
; Administration prior to the de
j cision.
