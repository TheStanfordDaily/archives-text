# Trackmen At Full Strength, Oppose Undefeated S.C.
## 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
Coach Payton Jordan says his
(Stanford track team will battle
I Southern Cal's defending national
champions for every point in to
morrow afternoon's Los Angeles
Coliseum meet. But it is this ob
server's frank opinion that the
Indians will be hard put to keep
Vern Wolf's Trojans under 100
points.
Jordan agrees, or at least did
agree on Tuesday, when he
voiced that very opinion in a tele
phone interview for the Los An
geles track writers' banquet. Wolf
accused Jordan of "breaking out
his crying towel again," when he
heard the Tribe mentor's com
ments.
Stanford does have something
going for it, even though that
may not be enough. That is the
fact that the Tribe will be healthy
and at full strength for the first

time since its opening victory
over San Jose State in the Stan
ford Relays back on March 7.
Jordan says he will do a mini
mum of doubling up, and the en
try list backs him up. The reason
ing behind this move is quite
sound, as every man will have to
be able to make a peak effort in
his best event if Stanford is to
come close to beating SC for the
first lime since 1933.
Only six Indians will either
double or triple in events outside
the relays. Foremost of these is
co-captain Sieve Cortright, who
will compete in ihc intermediate
hurdles, the triple jump, and the
high hurdles for the first time
since ihe Fresno State dual meet
and in the triple jump in the last
two meets and won at least one
of those events in each meet des
pite a gimpy leg which he could
not lift high enough to get it over
a high hurdle.
John Goode, who usually triples
in the broad, high and triple
jumps, will pass up Ihe high jump
tomorrow, as Jordan goes with
Clay Raaka against SC's brace of
seven-foot leapers, Lew Hoyt and
Joe Faust.
Bob Stoecker, another usual
Iriplcr, will pass up the shotput
this time to devote all his ener

gies to the javelin and his discus
specialty. Stoecker will be chal
lenged in his specialty by Les
Mills, the 1056 New Zealand
Olympic team captain. Mills has
never beaten the Stanford sopho
more in five attempts.
Others who will double up for
the Redskin squad will be Eric
Frische in the 100 and 220 as
well as the sprint relay; Bob Ma
in tyre, who will run at least one
sprint and will broad jump and
run a mile relay leg; and Ken
Fraser, who will go in the 220
and 440.
Jordan is holding both Paul
Schlicke and Harry McCalla out
of the mile, expecting llarlan An
drews and Dave Deubner to at
least give Bruce Bess, Troy's 1:09
miler, a run for his money.
Schlicke, McCalla and Weyn Kirk
land all will run the two mile,
in what should be the Tribe's
strongest event of the meet.
Southern Cal lost several good
men, people like Julio Marin and
Rex Cawley, from last year's
championship unit. But Coach
Wolf, like a true wolf, beat the
junior college bushes like mad,
and out fell men like Joe Faust,
a seven foot high jumper; Ma
honey Samuels, the British Em
pire triple jump champ from

Jamaica; Mills, the New Zealand
discus man; Don Castle, last
year's JC shotput champ from
Foothill at 59 plus; and Wellesley
Clayton, a 25-foot broad jumper.
All these men joined the Tro
jan cindermen after February's
semester break, and needless to
say, Wolf's boys got quite a shot
in the arm from them. There's
only one hitch â€” that's the fact
that most of these boys are not
eligible to compete in the NCAA
meet.
Bui this does Stanford no good,
because the AAWU eligibility
rules are far more lax than the
NCAA's in the cases of foreign
students and age limits. This
means that though they won't be
eligible to compete for SC in the
NCAA in Eugene in June, all
these men are permitted to com
pete in dual meet competition.
Payt Jordan summed it up
pretty well yesterday when he
said that if Stanford beats SC, it
would be the upset of this or any
other year.
