# Resurging Tribe Set For UCLA Double Header Sat.
## 
### 
Stopping a CIBA losing streak
at five when they pulled out two
one-run victories over Cal last
weekend, the Indians have a
chance to move further up the
ladder when they host. UCLA for
a double-header Saturday and
USC Monday. Game time Satur
day is 1 p.m.
UCLA presently holds down
third place in Ihe CIBA with a
16-4 record. Last place Cal has
i accounted for four of 1 h e vic
tories, and Stanford another, but
the big one for tho Ucians was a
3-2 upset of ihe defending nation
al champions, USC.
STARS in this game were
pitcher Larry Zeno, who present
ly has the lowest earned run aver
age in the circuit, and outfielder
Jerry Collet to, who accounted for
all Bruin runs with a timely
three-run homer. Another top hit
ter- for the visitors is first base
man Randy Swantz, swatting at
u .323 clip with seven CIBA runs
batted in.
In the first Stanford-UCLA duel
it was Zeno who limited the In
dians to seven hits and three wins
to get credit for the victory. Since
the Bruins play pacesetter Santa
Clara today and Zeno, the staff's
ace, will get the nod from Coach
Arthur Reichle, Stanford will
probably face Bill Brasher an d
southpaw Tom Pederson. Junior
college transfer Brasher current
ly sports a 2-1 record and is one
of the hardest throwers in the
conference.
Coach Dutch Fehring will pitch
either Dick Kovaeevieh or Terry
Docken in the first game and is
uncertain who will start the sec

ond game. Both Kovacevich and
Dooken appear to be in good form
as each turned in outstanding ef
forts against Cal. Doeken com
piled eight strikeouts and pitched
four-hit ball. Relieving starter
Mike Connelly in the first game
Kovacevich showed stuff expect
ed of him and retired eighteen
batters in a row except for one
error.
Providing a big part of the at
tack for the rejuvenated Indians
will be catcher Jim Hibbs, play-
I ing the circuit at .500, and center
fielder Bob Cox. at .400. the third
and sixth besi CIBA hitlers re
spectively.

tack for the rejuvenated Indians
will be catcher Jim Hibbs, play-
I ing the circuit at .500, and center
fielder Bob Cox. at .400. the third
and sixth besi CIBA hitlers re
spectively.
Stopping a CIBA losing streak
at five when they pulled out two
one-run victories over Cal last
weekend, the Indians have a
chance to move further up the
ladder when they host. UCLA for
a double-header Saturday and
USC Monday. Game time Satur
day is 1 p.m.
UCLA presently holds down
third place in Ihe CIBA with a
16-4 record. Last place Cal has
i accounted for four of 1 h e vic
tories, and Stanford another, but
the big one for tho Ucians was a
3-2 upset of ihe defending nation
al champions, USC.
STARS in this game were
pitcher Larry Zeno, who present
ly has the lowest earned run aver
age in the circuit, and outfielder
Jerry Collet to, who accounted for
all Bruin runs with a timely
three-run homer. Another top hit
ter- for the visitors is first base
man Randy Swantz, swatting at
u .323 clip with seven CIBA runs
batted in.
In the first Stanford-UCLA duel
it was Zeno who limited the In
dians to seven hits and three wins
to get credit for the victory. Since
the Bruins play pacesetter Santa
Clara today and Zeno, the staff's
ace, will get the nod from Coach
Arthur Reichle, Stanford will
probably face Bill Brasher an d
southpaw Tom Pederson. Junior
college transfer Brasher current
ly sports a 2-1 record and is one
of the hardest throwers in the
conference.
Coach Dutch Fehring will pitch
either Dick Kovaeevieh or Terry
Docken in the first game and is
uncertain who will start the sec

ond game. Both Kovacevich and
Dooken appear to be in good form
as each turned in outstanding ef
forts against Cal. Doeken com
piled eight strikeouts and pitched
four-hit ball. Relieving starter
Mike Connelly in the first game
Kovacevich showed stuff expect
ed of him and retired eighteen
batters in a row except for one
error.
Providing a big part of the at
tack for the rejuvenated Indians
will be catcher Jim Hibbs, play-
I ing the circuit at .500, and center
fielder Bob Cox. at .400. the third
and sixth besi CIBA hitlers re
spectively.
