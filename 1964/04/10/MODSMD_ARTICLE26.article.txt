# The 						Stanford Parent-Away-From-Home Syndrome
## Editorial 
### 
About a year ago some irate parents
wrote the University complaining that a
Stanford graduate student was having an
affair with their daughter. Shortly after
wards the University expelled the student.
Unusual? No—there have been a num
ber of cases here in which individuals have
been expelled for moral reasons.
And we don't like it.
IN A LETTER to the Harvard Crimson
last fall, John Kenneth Galbraith wrote that
Harvard had no business playing the role
of moral guardian over its students. We

think that applies to any sophisticated uni
versity—hopefully, including this one.
Although we do not necessarily condone
those activities which are considered im
moral, we cannot see what right the Univer
sity has to pass judgment and punishment
on them—as long as 110 other violation or
harm to the community in involved.
Moral values are a private matter. And
they vary greatly among individuals. Thus,
we do not understand why some administra
tors think they should enforce their morality
on all of us.

IN EFFECT, they are saying: We be
lieve we have found the truth.
But we ask: What justification do you
have for your beliefs?
Some might argue that Stanford will be
a better place by expelling the moral viola
tors in question. But Larry Sherwin, a mem
ber of Men's Council, has a perceptive reply
to this: "The excellence of Stanford is not
proportional to the number of virgins on

campus.
SINCE STANFORD does not necesarily
improve academically by expelling this type
of moral violator, does it improve morally?
If so, how? One less "sinner," yes. Hut if
his "sin' is being committed by many others
—which, as will be pointed out, it is—then
isn't the effect minimal?
After all, the harm done to the student
from expulsion should be compared to the
negligible good done to the University.
In recent months there have been many
national magazine articles concerning the

"new morality" in the United States. Sta
tistics have been bandied about — ranging
from the Kinsey Report to recent surveys —
showing that from 50 to 75 per cent of all
college students have had sexual intercourse
before graduation.
II this is so, shouldn't the University face
up to reality?

We deeply resent this parent-away-from
homc syndrome that has afflicted the admin
istration.
And we think it is time to grow lip.

Some might argue that Stanford will be
a better place by expelling the moral viola
tors in question. But Larry Sherwin, a mem
ber of Men's Council, has a perceptive reply
to this: "The excellence of Stanford is not
proportional to the number of virgins on

campus.
SINCE STANFORD does not necesarily
improve academically by expelling this type
of moral violator, does it improve morally?
If so, how? One less "sinner," yes. Hut if
his "sin' is being committed by many others
—which, as will be pointed out, it is—then
isn't the effect minimal?
After all, the harm done to the student
from expulsion should be compared to the
negligible good done to the University.
In recent months there have been many
national magazine articles concerning the

"new morality" in the United States. Sta
tistics have been bandied about — ranging
from the Kinsey Report to recent surveys —
showing that from 50 to 75 per cent of all
college students have had sexual intercourse
before graduation.
II this is so, shouldn't the University face
up to reality?

About a year ago some irate parents
wrote the University complaining that a
Stanford graduate student was having an
affair with their daughter. Shortly after
wards the University expelled the student.
Unusual? No—there have been a num
ber of cases here in which individuals have
been expelled for moral reasons.
And we don't like it.
IN A LETTER to the Harvard Crimson
last fall, John Kenneth Galbraith wrote that
Harvard had no business playing the role
of moral guardian over its students. We

think that applies to any sophisticated uni
versity—hopefully, including this one.
Although we do not necessarily condone
those activities which are considered im
moral, we cannot see what right the Univer
sity has to pass judgment and punishment
on them—as long as 110 other violation or
harm to the community in involved.
Moral values are a private matter. And
they vary greatly among individuals. Thus,
we do not understand why some administra
tors think they should enforce their morality
on all of us.
