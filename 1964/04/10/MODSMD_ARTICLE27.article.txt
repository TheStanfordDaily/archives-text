## White Plaza Fountain Reflects 'Ebb And Flow' 
### Ford Burkhart 
Here's an idea that's as felicitous on April 10 as the First Robin
of Spring.
(1 credit it to an undergraduate friend, who has a Hair for
whimsy.)
Whv not make the White Memorial Plaza a real center of
c reative relaxation?
Now that the bull-dozers and the cement-mixers are gone, the
Plaza seems mighty quiet.

HOWEVER, ONE OF THESE warm spring afternoons, jets
ol water will start to spray upwards from the now silent fountain
that looks like a three-headed demon. The streams of water will
reflect the "ebb and flow of the students, in the words of the
designer.
Hmmm. . . . The ebb and How of the students.
What fancy that connotes.
My friend visualized a Hood of sun-crowned students rushing
up to the water's edge for a quick dip, and then receding to sun
and beach towels on the nearby lawns.
Another student joined the conversation and offered the idea
of beach balls bouncing around during between-class-breaks, and
deckchairs near the bookstore to catch the best rays.
Nobody knew of any regulations against bermudas or bathing
suits in this particular area.
The romantics could bring along guitars, and the thirsty could
bring tall, cool glasses of refreshment. (It's the prig in us that
says the drinks in our fanciful scene would be non-alcoholic.)
Bathhouses could be set up behind the bookstore.
The bookstore could sell the sun-tan lotion.
Ilotdogs are a quarter at the union, just a few steps away.
It's a picture of real Friday afternoon Fun on the Farm.
We like it.

JUST OUT of curiosity, we looked up a definition of fountain- j
designer Demetrios' term "flow" of students. Our dictionary on
page 211 defines "How" as "to hang loose.
Ah, yes.
There may be no sand to get into your shoes on White Plaza.
but there is plenty of room on those green lawns for ebbing
and flowing.
Or hanging loose, if you please.
