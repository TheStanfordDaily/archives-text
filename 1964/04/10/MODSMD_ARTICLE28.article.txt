# Stanford Yesterday

### 
FIFTY YEARS AGO
Many changes completed over
the Christimas vacation have put
the Stanford Oval in splendid
shape. With the proposed improve
ments having become established

tacts, the Stanford Oval now
ranks with the finest. Recent al
terations in the arrangements of
the cages and stands have ren
dered it more commodious and at
present it is well arranged and
cared for. Daily, Feb. 3, 1914.
