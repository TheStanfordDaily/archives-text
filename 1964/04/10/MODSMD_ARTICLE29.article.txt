# Visits To Mental Patients Enriching
## The 						mailbox 
### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a letter submitted
to the Daily by one of the
mental patients at the Menlo
Park Veterans Adniinisl ra
tion Hospital. It is his desire
to express the general feel
ing's of the patients toward
the students in the Stanford
Mental Health Field Project
who visit the hospital, and to
give some insight into the
life of a mental patient.
Editor, The Daily:
Reflecting the unanimous
sentiment of the patients, I
would like to convey to the stu
dents that their presence has
been a most happy experience.
Chiefly, this has been due to
the spontaneity and human
warmth generated by the give
and take between the patients
and students. I myself am a
former university teacher of
English literature and phil
osophy and a Civil Service
Historian overseas and have
enjoyed the stimulation and in
tellectual exchange with the
students.
STUDENTS who have en
joyed the experience of con
tact have doubtlessly learned
that there exist large reserves
of health, and sense of reality
in many patients. Institutional
ization, at its best, contains
much that is depressing and
sterile.
The temptation to withdraw
and to make a dichotomy be
tween "insider" and "outsider"
is an ever present danger to
the patient. An experience such
as is afforded by the Stanford
student visits is a constant
stimulus and reminder of all
that is anti-institutional and
normal in the patients' own
sense of identity.
MANY A STUDENT, coming
here for the first time, ha d
only vague notions of the per
sonalities of mentally ill in
dividuals. Confrontation with
actual personalities in intimate
dialogue and social interaction
has proved to be an enriching
discovery and revelation to
them.
In conclusion. I would like
to make the student aware of

an important contribution that
ho can make through this con
tact. By acquiring a profounder
insight into the identity of the
mentally ill patient, he can
communicate, to society at
large, a truer and more authen
tic picture of the complexity
of the problems of the insti
t utionalizcd individual.
Despite the wide publicity
about the mentally ill, accept
ance of the latter as a person
ality with creative potentials
in many areas is still lacking.
There is irony in the fact
that many expat ients, who,
through their difficulties, have
acquired expanded phyc-hologi
cal and philosophical insight,
have at the same time gained
much that Ihey could contrib
ute to the social and cultural
enrichment of our time.

Editor, The Daily:
1 would like to correct an
important factual error in your
otherwise excellent article of
April 8 on the new Health Cen
ter - an error for which I
am probably at fault, a) by
inadvertently giving your re
porter the wrong impression
that the Cowell Foundation gift
of $750,000 preceded the Uni
versity's adoption of the plans,
and b) in not having been
aware of all aspects of the
early stages of PACE planning.
I have since learned that in
fact a new Health Center and
infirmary were planned from
the program's beginning, al
though not scheduled for con
struction as soon as some other
components. Later, in the Win
ter of 1961, the Health Service
project was moved up to an
earlier priority, and actual
plans for the building were
commenced
Two years later, in February
1963. the Cowell Foundation
made its original $750,000 gift
—to which it has since added
a further gift of $138,000. How
ever. the University had ae

ceptcd the project long before
this as a long range need in
1960, and as a high-priority
need in 1961.

• To Kill A Bird
Editor, The Daily:
I have a question: Who killed
the bird?
I saw a strange thing on the
Stanford' campus as I was
walking to my 8 o'clock Tues
day morning -- people were
smiling. Yes, and what's more
they were even laughing and
greeting each other with big
grins on their faces and paus
ing for just a moment to chat
and enjoy something wit h
someone they didn't even
know. II wasn't just the kids
either; everyone seemed hap
pier and friendlier than usual.
An old woman with a sly
chuckle in her voice and a
reminiscent twinkle in her eyes
stepped up to me and said,
"Isn't it great? Isn't it just
great! Why, this should win
the . . . They really should
give a prize for these things,
you know." And then she
laughed, and then I laughed.
And she slowly, reluctantly
strolled off; the twinkle was
still in her eye.
"What warmed the hearts of
so many people?" you ask. It
wasn't a great speech nor some
act of valor; it was a college
student's prank. It was a bril
liant-colored bird and egg in
a large nest placed in the
equally strange projections of
tho new sculpture in White
Memorial Plaza.
Just as I was going around
the Engineering Corner of
Quad, I glanced back to get one
last look at the Harmless, joke,
only to see what appeared to be
a girl holding some soggy
paper; the sculpture was bare.
I told myself it couldn't be
true; no Stanford girl could be
that cold-hearted, hut it was
true for I checked after class,
and the gay bird was gone.

• To Kill A Bird
Editor, The Daily:
I have a question: Who killed
the bird?
I saw a strange thing on the
Stanford' campus as I was
walking to my 8 o'clock Tues
day morning -- people were
smiling. Yes, and what's more
they were even laughing and
greeting each other with big
grins on their faces and paus
ing for just a moment to chat
and enjoy something wit h
someone they didn't even
know. II wasn't just the kids
either; everyone seemed hap
pier and friendlier than usual.
An old woman with a sly
chuckle in her voice and a
reminiscent twinkle in her eyes
stepped up to me and said,
"Isn't it great? Isn't it just
great! Why, this should win
the . . . They really should
give a prize for these things,
you know." And then she
laughed, and then I laughed.
And she slowly, reluctantly
strolled off; the twinkle was
still in her eye.
"What warmed the hearts of
so many people?" you ask. It
wasn't a great speech nor some
act of valor; it was a college
student's prank. It was a bril
liant-colored bird and egg in
a large nest placed in the
equally strange projections of
tho new sculpture in White
Memorial Plaza.
Just as I was going around
the Engineering Corner of
Quad, I glanced back to get one
last look at the Harmless, joke,
only to see what appeared to be
a girl holding some soggy
paper; the sculpture was bare.
I told myself it couldn't be
true; no Stanford girl could be
that cold-hearted, hut it was
true for I checked after class,
and the gay bird was gone.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a letter submitted
to the Daily by one of the
mental patients at the Menlo
Park Veterans Adniinisl ra
tion Hospital. It is his desire
to express the general feel
ing's of the patients toward
the students in the Stanford
Mental Health Field Project
who visit the hospital, and to
give some insight into the
life of a mental patient.
Editor, The Daily:
Reflecting the unanimous
sentiment of the patients, I
would like to convey to the stu
dents that their presence has
been a most happy experience.
Chiefly, this has been due to
the spontaneity and human
warmth generated by the give
and take between the patients
and students. I myself am a
former university teacher of
English literature and phil
osophy and a Civil Service
Historian overseas and have
enjoyed the stimulation and in
tellectual exchange with the
students.
STUDENTS who have en
joyed the experience of con
tact have doubtlessly learned
that there exist large reserves
of health, and sense of reality
in many patients. Institutional
ization, at its best, contains
much that is depressing and
sterile.
The temptation to withdraw
and to make a dichotomy be
tween "insider" and "outsider"
is an ever present danger to
the patient. An experience such
as is afforded by the Stanford
student visits is a constant
stimulus and reminder of all
that is anti-institutional and
normal in the patients' own
sense of identity.
MANY A STUDENT, coming
here for the first time, ha d
only vague notions of the per
sonalities of mentally ill in
dividuals. Confrontation with
actual personalities in intimate
dialogue and social interaction
has proved to be an enriching
discovery and revelation to
them.
In conclusion. I would like
to make the student aware of

an important contribution that
ho can make through this con
tact. By acquiring a profounder
insight into the identity of the
mentally ill patient, he can
communicate, to society at
large, a truer and more authen
tic picture of the complexity
of the problems of the insti
t utionalizcd individual.
Despite the wide publicity
about the mentally ill, accept
ance of the latter as a person
ality with creative potentials
in many areas is still lacking.
There is irony in the fact
that many expat ients, who,
through their difficulties, have
acquired expanded phyc-hologi
cal and philosophical insight,
have at the same time gained
much that Ihey could contrib

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a letter submitted
to the Daily by one of the
mental patients at the Menlo

tion Hospital. It is his desire
to express the general feel

the students in the Stanford
Mental Health Field Project
who visit the hospital, and to
give some insight into the
life of a mental patient.
Editor, The Daily:
Reflecting the unanimous
sentiment of the patients, I
would like to convey to the stu
dents that their presence has
been a most happy experience.
Chiefly, this has been due to
the spontaneity and human
warmth generated by the give
and take between the patients
and students. I myself am a
former university teacher of
English literature and phil
osophy and a Civil Service
Historian overseas and have
enjoyed the stimulation and in
tellectual exchange with the
students.
STUDENTS who have en
joyed the experience of con
tact have doubtlessly learned
that there exist large reserves
of health, and sense of reality
in many patients. Institutional
ization, at its best, contains
much that is depressing and
sterile.
The temptation to withdraw
and to make a dichotomy be
tween "insider" and "outsider"
is an ever present danger to
the patient. An experience such
as is afforded by the Stanford
student visits is a constant
stimulus and reminder of all
that is anti-institutional and
normal in the patients' own
sense of identity.
MANY A STUDENT, coming
here for the first time, ha d
only vague notions of the per
sonalities of mentally ill in
dividuals. Confrontation with
actual personalities in intimate
dialogue and social interaction
has proved to be an enriching
discovery and revelation to
them.
In conclusion. I would like
to make the student aware of

an important contribution that
ho can make through this con
tact. By acquiring a profounder
insight into the identity of the
mentally ill patient, he can
communicate, to society at
large, a truer and more authen
tic picture of the complexity
of the problems of the insti
t utionalizcd individual.
Despite the wide publicity
about the mentally ill, accept
ance of the latter as a person
ality with creative potentials
in many areas is still lacking.
There is irony in the fact
that many expat ients, who,
through their difficulties, have
acquired expanded phyc-hologi

have at the same time gained
much that Ihey could contrib

1 would like to correct an
important factual error in your
otherwise excellent article of
April 8 on the new Health Cen
ter - an error for which I
am probably at fault, a) by
inadvertently giving your re
porter the wrong impression
that the Cowell Foundation gift
of $750,000 preceded the Uni
versity's adoption of the plans,
and b) in not having been
aware of all aspects of the
early stages of PACE planning.
I have since learned that in
fact a new Health Center and
infirmary were planned from
the program's beginning, al
though not scheduled for con
struction as soon as some other
components. Later, in the Win
ter of 1961, the Health Service
project was moved up to an
earlier priority, and actual
plans for the building were
commenced
Two years later, in February
1963. the Cowell Foundation
made its original $750,000 gift
—to which it has since added
a further gift of $138,000. How
ever. the University had ae

ceptcd the project long before
this as a long range need in
1960, and as a high-priority
need in 1961.

• To Kill A Bird
Editor, The Daily:
I have a question: Who killed
the bird?
I saw a strange thing on the
Stanford' campus as I was
walking to my 8 o'clock Tues
day morning -- people were
smiling. Yes, and what's more
they were even laughing and
greeting each other with big
grins on their faces and paus
ing for just a moment to chat
and enjoy something wit h
someone they didn't even
know. II wasn't just the kids
either; everyone seemed hap
pier and friendlier than usual.
An old woman with a sly
chuckle in her voice and a
reminiscent twinkle in her eyes
stepped up to me and said,
"Isn't it great? Isn't it just
great! Why, this should win
the . . . They really should
give a prize for these things,
you know." And then she
laughed, and then I laughed.
And she slowly, reluctantly
strolled off; the twinkle was
still in her eye.
"What warmed the hearts of
so many people?" you ask. It
wasn't a great speech nor some
act of valor; it was a college
student's prank. It was a bril
liant-colored bird and egg in
a large nest placed in the
equally strange projections of
tho new sculpture in White
Memorial Plaza.
Just as I was going around
the Engineering Corner of
Quad, I glanced back to get one
last look at the Harmless, joke,
only to see what appeared to be
a girl holding some soggy
paper; the sculpture was bare.
I told myself it couldn't be
