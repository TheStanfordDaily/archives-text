## Pacifists' Simple Rule: 'Thou Shalt Not Kill' 
### Vivian Bozman 
To some people who have never known a pacifist, but have
heard the word thrown about, the name "pacifist" connotes a
bearded beatnick who gets a kick out of marching around with
! a sign.
For those who are willing to go beyond such superficialities
and stereotypes, the concept of a "War Tax Protest" may provide
I some food for thought, for it represents the fact that to a good
j many Americans today, pacifism is a way of life based upon the
fundamental principle that it is wrong to take another man's life,
even when justified by the rationalization of fighting for the ab
straction of one s "nation."
Next Wednesday night at 8 p.m. at Walden School in Berkeley
three men, for whom pacifism is indeed a creed of life, will speak
at a "War Tax Protest Rally," to explain the concept of refusing to
pay a portion of or all of one's income taxes in order to protest the
money which is used for military spending.
SPEAKERS wil be Roy Kepler, owner of Kepler's Books and
[Magazines and a World War 11 conscientious objector; Ira Sand
perl, school teacher and counselor for conscientious objectors for
the national organization Turn Toward Peace; and Marshall Pal
ley, College Secretary of the American Friends Service Commit
tee.
A 'Declaration of Independence from War Taxes," signed by
these men and thirty-two other war tax protestors, reads, "We be
lieve that the way to peace lies not in war or preparation for war,
but in using our wealth and technology to meet the human needs
and just aspirations of all people everywhere. . . . We believe
that it is among the highest duties of citizenship to resist the rush
toward war represented by this country's present defense posture.
We call upon all men of good will to join us in protesting or refus
ing to pay taxes for war and war preparations."
In explaining why lie refuses to voluntarily pay the sixty per
cent of his income tax which goes toward military spending, Ira
Sandperl calls his action, not civil disobedience, but, rather, obedi
ence to the international law that was agreed upon at Nuremberg.
"That law, Sandperl writes in a letter to the Internal Revenue
Service, "states that participation in or preparation for genocide
is a crime against humanity dnd cannot be justified by any national
law."
FOLKSINGER JOAN BAEZ, who has also joined the "War
I Tax Protest" says"it is enough to say that no man has the right
to take; another man's life."
But in addition, Miss Baez continues, "modern war is imprac
tical and stupid. We spend billions of dollars a year on weapons
which all agree must never be used. . . . [We] continue heaping
up one horrible kill machine upon another, until for some reason
or another a button will be pushed, and our world. . . . will be
blown to pieces. That is not security. That is stupidity.
A chance to listen to Kepler or Sandperl is an opportunity to
hear men of humanity and reason explain their grave concern
for a world in which inhumanity and irrationality seem to rule;
; to listen and, perhaps, if only for a few minutes, to think, and to
question:
What do we support—Defense? Murder? Stalemate:' freedom?
Hostility between peoples?

three men, for whom pacifism is indeed a creed of life, will speak
at a "War Tax Protest Rally," to explain the concept of refusing to
pay a portion of or all of one's income taxes in order to protest the
money which is used for military spending.
SPEAKERS wil be Roy Kepler, owner of Kepler's Books and
[Magazines and a World War 11 conscientious objector; Ira Sand
perl, school teacher and counselor for conscientious objectors for
the national organization Turn Toward Peace; and Marshall Pal
ley, College Secretary of the American Friends Service Commit
tee.
A 'Declaration of Independence from War Taxes," signed by
these men and thirty-two other war tax protestors, reads, "We be
lieve that the way to peace lies not in war or preparation for war,
but in using our wealth and technology to meet the human needs
and just aspirations of all people everywhere. . . . We believe
that it is among the highest duties of citizenship to resist the rush
toward war represented by this country's present defense posture.
We call upon all men of good will to join us in protesting or refus
ing to pay taxes for war and war preparations."
In explaining why lie refuses to voluntarily pay the sixty per
cent of his income tax which goes toward military spending, Ira
Sandperl calls his action, not civil disobedience, but, rather, obedi
ence to the international law that was agreed upon at Nuremberg.
"That law, Sandperl writes in a letter to the Internal Revenue
Service, "states that participation in or preparation for genocide
is a crime against humanity dnd cannot be justified by any national
law."
FOLKSINGER JOAN BAEZ, who has also joined the "War
I Tax Protest" says"it is enough to say that no man has the right
to take; another man's life."
But in addition, Miss Baez continues, "modern war is imprac
tical and stupid. We spend billions of dollars a year on weapons
which all agree must never be used. . . . [We] continue heaping
up one horrible kill machine upon another, until for some reason
or another a button will be pushed, and our world. . . . will be
blown to pieces. That is not security. That is stupidity.
A chance to listen to Kepler or Sandperl is an opportunity to
hear men of humanity and reason explain their grave concern
for a world in which inhumanity and irrationality seem to rule;
; to listen and, perhaps, if only for a few minutes, to think, and to
question:
What do we support—Defense? Murder? Stalemate:' freedom?
Hostility between peoples?

To some people who have never known a pacifist, but have
heard the word thrown about, the name "pacifist" connotes a
bearded beatnick who gets a kick out of marching around with
! a sign.
For those who are willing to go beyond such superficialities
and stereotypes, the concept of a "War Tax Protest" may provide
I some food for thought, for it represents the fact that to a good
j many Americans today, pacifism is a way of life based upon the
fundamental principle that it is wrong to take another man's life,
even when justified by the rationalization of fighting for the ab
straction of one s "nation."
