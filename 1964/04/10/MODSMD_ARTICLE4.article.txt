# Would Do It Again
## 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM 
"Of course there were
some rough days, hut I
would go back to do it
again." Georgianna Shine,
a Peace Corps recruiter, lias
these words to say about
her two years in Ghana,
where she taught secondary
school.
The youthful, suntanned
girl, has spent t lie past lew
days at the Peace Corps
desk near engineering cor
ner selling unusual wares.
The wares she sells are
Peace Corps assignments,
but she never tries to con
vince anyone to join. "You
have to want it," she says.
"I would hate to put some
one in a position where he
would be miserable. I refuse
to coil anybody."
Responding to a long-time
interest in Africa, Mi s s
Shine joined the first Peace
Corps group in I!)H1 and was
sent to Ghana to teach
eighth and ninth grade Eng-
Ii s h at a coeducational
boarding school. As the only
woman teacher, she received
the? job of liouseniistress for
the school's 4(» girls.
She also served as librar
ian, cordinator of the school
newspaper, drama director,
and track coach.
"I didn't know anything
about track, but someone
had to do it and since I had
dated a trackman in college,
I got the job," she explains.
Accommodations at her
school are described as "con

siderably better than aver
aye, sort of like summer
camp." The teachers live in
cinder-block houses which
are supplied with electricity
and water that requires
boiling before use.
The attractive girl regards
parts of her experience as
frustrating. Alter about six
months at the school she
experienced a period of de
pression and disillusionment
hut soon "gained perspec
tive."
" Began to see the s t u
dents making the same mis
takes over and over again.
I lived a fish bowl type life,
never alone, and everyone
constantly judging me as
white, as an American, and
as a Peace Corps worker. I
began to wonder if I were
really accomplishing an y
tliing," she states.
On reflection, however,
she admits that things
worked out much better
than she had expected. Her
greatest satisfaction came
from meeting and working
with people. "That is what
made my whole two years,
just people, the way th e y
took me in; suddenly it
occurs to you that they kind
of like you."
She concludes, "I don't
pretend for a minute that
the Peace Corps is the pan
acea for all the problems iu
the world. It may be just a
drop in the bucket, but at
least we are doing some
| thing."

" Began to see the s t u
dents making the same mis
takes over and over again.
I lived a fish bowl type life,
never alone, and everyone
constantly judging me as
white, as an American, and
as a Peace Corps worker. I
began to wonder if I were
really accomplishing an y
tliing," she states.
On reflection, however,
she admits that things
worked out much better
than she had expected. Her
greatest satisfaction came
from meeting and working
with people. "That is what
made my whole two years,
just people, the way th e y
took me in; suddenly it
occurs to you that they kind
of like you."
She concludes, "I don't
pretend for a minute that
the Peace Corps is the pan
acea for all the problems iu
the world. It may be just a
drop in the bucket, but at
least we are doing some

"Of course there were
some rough days, hut I
would go back to do it
again." Georgianna Shine,
a Peace Corps recruiter, lias
these words to say about
her two years in Ghana,
where she taught secondary
school.
The youthful, suntanned
girl, has spent t lie past lew
days at the Peace Corps
desk near engineering cor
ner selling unusual wares.
The wares she sells are
Peace Corps assignments,
but she never tries to con
vince anyone to join. "You
have to want it," she says.
"I would hate to put some
one in a position where he
would be miserable. I refuse
to coil anybody."
Responding to a long-time
interest in Africa, Mi s s
Shine joined the first Peace
Corps group in I!)H1 and was
sent to Ghana to teach
eighth and ninth grade Eng-
Ii s h at a coeducational
boarding school. As the only
woman teacher, she received
the? job of liouseniistress for
the school's 4(» girls.
She also served as librar
ian, cordinator of the school
newspaper, drama director,
and track coach.
"I didn't know anything
about track, but someone
had to do it and since I had
dated a trackman in college,
I got the job," she explains.
Accommodations at her
school are described as "con

siderably better than aver
aye, sort of like summer
camp." The teachers live in
cinder-block houses which
are supplied with electricity
and water that requires
boiling before use.
The attractive girl regards
parts of her experience as
frustrating. Alter about six
months at the school she
experienced a period of de
pression and disillusionment
hut soon "gained perspec
tive."
