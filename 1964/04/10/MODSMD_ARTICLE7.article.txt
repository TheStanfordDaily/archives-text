# LASSU Turns Into Hotbed Of Apathy
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
I LASSU fizzled like a faulty
Fourth of July skyrocket last
night, in its first meeting of
spring quarter.
An attempt was made to create
a five-man committee to review
or consider specific changes in
rush policy. This committe would
be composed of the presidents of
the ICC. IFC, and IHC, the head
Wilbur sponsor, and one member
of the Legislature.
ASSU PRESIDENT Bud Wedin
J moved that the proposed by-laws
(change be brought out of the By
> laws Committee where it had been
j resting since the proposal was
J made last quarter. Wedin felt
I that if the committee were
; formed, Legislature would gain
I proper control of rush policies,
such as the one recently pro
posed.
Under the proposed by-laws
change, the committe would re
| port to LASSU on any proposed
! rush changes, and t ho Legislature
would have final authority for en
actment of any rush policies.
However, the motion to bring

I lie proposal out of committee
tailed 27-33, forecasting a possible
delay in action on the current
rush proposal, and threatening
i the creation of a mechanism
through which LASSU might con
trol rush procedure.
WEDIN SOMEWHAT disturbed
by the Legislature's failure to act,
said, "It is unfortunate for th e
parties with vested interests that
we possibly have the prospect of
awaiting six more weeks for a
final decision on the rush policy."
Discussion by the Legislature
on the current rush proposal was
postponed to alow further inves
tigation by the parties concerned
with it.
THREE SPECIAL committees

were also appointed, including
one 1o investigate last quarter's
election of a head yell leader.
Gibson told LASSU, in request
ing that the investigative com
mittee he formed, that there have
I been complaints of unethical
J practices in that election.
Other business taken by the
Legislature included officially
opening Lake Lagunita to swim
ming from 1-5 p.m. on weekdays,
and from 11-5 p.m. on weekends,
and permitting swimming near
the AKL house.
LASSU also approved raising
the price of the Sunday flicks on
April 26 to thirty cents, with the
extra dime to the Con Home
I drive.

Fourth of July skyrocket last
night, in its first meeting of
spring quarter.
An attempt was made to create
a five-man committee to review
or consider specific changes in
rush policy. This committe would
be composed of the presidents of
the ICC. IFC, and IHC, the head
Wilbur sponsor, and one member
of the Legislature.
