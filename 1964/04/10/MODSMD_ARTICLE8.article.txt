# CONCERN FOR LAYMAN
## Callahan Speaks On Laity 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Editorial Director 
The Catholic layman's political experience in
democracy has led him to press for a position of
lull participation for the laily in the Catholic
Ch urch.
This thought will be explained by Daniel Calla
han, associate editor of "The Commonweal" in a
speech tonight at 7:45 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium.
Tin; SPEECH, titled "Social Change and the
Layman," will treat the development of lay partici
pation in the Church as a result of a rise in the
economic, cultural, political, and educational levels
of the layman.
In the past, according to Callahan, the laity
has had a secondary position in the Church, and
the authority has rested in the clergy. "The laity
has been the passive object of the clergy's atten
tion."
Tht authoritarian and paternalistic attitude of
the Church developed because, at one time, the
clergy were the only educated members of the
Church.
SINCE THE SECOND World War. a trend,
accentuated by the Vatican Councils, has heralded
a greater concern for the layman from the Catho
lie clergy.
This trend has taken in 1» lay participation at
the Vatican Councils. 2> lay members of parochial
school boards and ecumenical commissions, and
31 bishops' solicitation of lay opinion. In addition
the Second Council discussed the role of the lay
man and a decree on this subject may come from
this fall's Council.
In the future, Callahan envisions: first, a then
logical clarification of the position, rights, and p<»

tential of the layman in the Catholic Church.
"There is now an awareness that the layman has |
an active part to play in the Church;"
• fuller lay participation in the liturgy. "This
has already begun in lay members' reading of the j
epistle and gospel al Mass;"
• a movement in which increasing numbers ot
the laity will take over tasks of the clergy, such as !
education;
• (he establishment by bishops of formal
means of soliciting lay opinion.
Callahan feels "to be effective in society, the j
layman must have a greater part to play in the
Church. The Church prepares the layman for so
eiety, but he is prepared well only if the Church
is sensitive to society. This is one oft he roles ot
the layman: to inform che Church of what society
is like."
"MAKING KNOWN to the Church its moral
and spiritual needs and acting as a mediator be
tween the Church and world" are two other parts
of the layman's role in the Catholic Church.
This service of the layman to the Church comes
from the facts that "the Church exists for the
world, and the layman is in the world."
Professor of Religion Robert MacAfee Brown
says Callahan "represents a new and much needed
emphasis in the contemporary Catholic Church:
the articulate lay theologian. Through his speak
ing and writing, he gives energetic leadership to
his Church as it seeks to relate itself to the con
temporary world."
IN ADDITION to his post on "The Common
weal" (a Catholic journal of opinion edited by lay
men i. Callahan is the author of "The Mind of the
Catholic Layman," co-editor of "Christianity Di
vided," and will be visiting Professor of Religion
at Brown University next year.

economic, cultural, political, and educational levels
of the layman.
In the past, according to Callahan, the laity
has had a secondary position in the Church, and
the authority has rested in the clergy. "The laity
has been the passive object of the clergy's atten
tion."
Tht authoritarian and paternalistic attitude of
the Church developed because, at one time, the
clergy were the only educated members of the
Church.
SINCE THE SECOND World War. a trend,
accentuated by the Vatican Councils, has heralded
a greater concern for the layman from the Catho
lie clergy.
This trend has taken in 1» lay participation at
the Vatican Councils. 2> lay members of parochial
school boards and ecumenical commissions, and
31 bishops' solicitation of lay opinion. In addition
the Second Council discussed the role of the lay
man and a decree on this subject may come from
this fall's Council.
In the future, Callahan envisions: first, a then
logical clarification of the position, rights, and p<»

tential of the layman in the Catholic Church.
"There is now an awareness that the layman has |
an active part to play in the Church;"
• fuller lay participation in the liturgy. "This
has already begun in lay members' reading of the j
epistle and gospel al Mass;"
• a movement in which increasing numbers ot
the laity will take over tasks of the clergy, such as !
education;
• (he establishment by bishops of formal
means of soliciting lay opinion.
Callahan feels "to be effective in society, the j
layman must have a greater part to play in the
Church. The Church prepares the layman for so
eiety, but he is prepared well only if the Church
is sensitive to society. This is one oft he roles ot
the layman: to inform che Church of what society
is like."
"MAKING KNOWN to the Church its moral
and spiritual needs and acting as a mediator be
tween the Church and world" are two other parts
of the layman's role in the Catholic Church.
This service of the layman to the Church comes
from the facts that "the Church exists for the
world, and the layman is in the world."
Professor of Religion Robert MacAfee Brown
says Callahan "represents a new and much needed
emphasis in the contemporary Catholic Church:
the articulate lay theologian. Through his speak
ing and writing, he gives energetic leadership to
his Church as it seeks to relate itself to the con
temporary world."
IN ADDITION to his post on "The Common
weal" (a Catholic journal of opinion edited by lay
men i. Callahan is the author of "The Mind of the
Catholic Layman," co-editor of "Christianity Di
vided," and will be visiting Professor of Religion
at Brown University next year.
The Catholic layman's political experience in
democracy has led him to press for a position of
lull participation for the laily in the Catholic
Ch urch.
This thought will be explained by Daniel Calla
han, associate editor of "The Commonweal" in a
speech tonight at 7:45 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium.
Tin; SPEECH, titled "Social Change and the
Layman," will treat the development of lay partici
pation in the Church as a result of a rise in the
economic, cultural, political, and educational levels
of the layman.
