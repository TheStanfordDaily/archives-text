The Foolishness
Of Preaching
Many people believe that modern day Christians should spend most of
their time working for peace movements or for unity of world religions. They
claim that the Gospel message of Jesus Christ is out-of-date and irrelevant in
the 20th century. Naturally, all Christians are concerned about world peace
and religious freedom, but they know that the solution to man's problems is
not to be found apart form the Person of Jesus Christ. Christians wish that every
one could see the world from God's point of view. However, the majority of
people are blind to the saving power of the Gospel of Christ.
But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God
of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light
of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto
them. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves
your servants for Jesus sake.'' II Cor. 4:3-5.
I|ie terrible truth is that most of the world's inhabitants are slipping off
into eternal separation from God because they do not know Jesus Christ on a
personal basis.
He that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is
condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only
begotten Son of God." John 3:1 8.
The Christian message—that Jesus Christ came into the world to suffer and
die for our sins, that he was buried and rose again on the third day—is as all
important to every individual today as it was 2000 years ago.
For heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."
Matt. 24:35.
If you are not a Christian, that is, if you do not know Jesus Christ as Lord
and Saviour, then in all likelihood, the Gospel message is foolishness to you.
But won't you take a long hard look at your life and see how empty it is without
God. Your eternal fate hangs in the balance. God says that the wisdom of this
world, all the wisdom of mankind, will be completely brought fo nothing —
destroyed and put away.
"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . . . The Lord know
eth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain." "I Cor. 3:19-20.
The believer knows through the Holy Spirit that the Gospel is the Power of
God.
"For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto
us which are saved it is the power of God . . . For after that in the Wisdom
of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness
of preaching to save them that believe." Cor. LI 8, 21.

For heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."
Matt. 24:35.
If you are not a Christian, that is, if you do not know Jesus Christ as Lord
and Saviour, then in all likelihood, the Gospel message is foolishness to you.
But won't you take a long hard look at your life and see how empty it is without
God. Your eternal fate hangs in the balance. God says that the wisdom of this
world, all the wisdom of mankind, will be completely brought fo nothing —
destroyed and put away.
"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . . . The Lord know
eth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain." "I Cor. 3:19-20.
The believer knows through the Holy Spirit that the Gospel is the Power of
God.
"For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto
us which are saved it is the power of God . . . For after that in the Wisdom
of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness
of preaching to save them that believe." Cor. LI 8, 21.

The Foolishness
Of Preaching
Many people believe that modern day Christians should spend most of
their time working for peace movements or for unity of world religions. They
claim that the Gospel message of Jesus Christ is out-of-date and irrelevant in
the 20th century. Naturally, all Christians are concerned about world peace
and religious freedom, but they know that the solution to man's problems is
not to be found apart form the Person of Jesus Christ. Christians wish that every
one could see the world from God's point of view. However, the majority of
people are blind to the saving power of the Gospel of Christ.
But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God
of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light
of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto
them. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves
your servants for Jesus sake.'' II Cor. 4:3-5.
I|ie terrible truth is that most of the world's inhabitants are slipping off
into eternal separation from God because they do not know Jesus Christ on a
personal basis.
He that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is
condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only
begotten Son of God." John 3:1 8.
The Christian message—that Jesus Christ came into the world to suffer and
die for our sins, that he was buried and rose again on the third day—is as all
important to every individual today as it was 2000 years ago.
For heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."
