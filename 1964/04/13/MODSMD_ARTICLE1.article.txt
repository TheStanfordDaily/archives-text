# Second Sit-In Demonstration Hits Cadillac Agency
## 230 Arrested; Next Sit-in Set For Saturday 
### STEVE GRUBER 
I\vo hundred thirty civil rights
demonstrators were arrested in
San Francisco yesterday at Ihe
first sit-in in a month, staged Sat
urday afternoon. Three Van Ness
automobile agencies were in
volved Cadillac, Jim Wessman's
Lincoln-Mercury, and Chrysler-
Plymouth.
According to San Francisco
City Prison, only five of the dem
onstrators had not been hailed
out by Saturday night. The other
225 were booked for four charges
and released on $76 bail.
IN A SPECIAL interview, at
torney Vincent Hallinan told The
DAILY, "This will not be our
last demonstration. The demon
strators have negotiated long
enough with these people, with
nothing to show for it. We plan
another sit-in Saturday at 11
a.m. at the same agencies."
Hallinan, as the attorney for
the demonstrators, posted their!
total bail of $4122. The money [
came from the United Freedom !
Fund, which was organized fori
that purpose.
This was the most defiant dem
onstration of the year. The dem-!
onstrators, mostly white students,
invaded the executive's offices,
climbed into the cars in the show
rooms, continuously sang songs,
and chanted.
MOVIE ACTOR Sterling Hay
den was among those arrested.
Five officers were required to
carry him out. According to at
torney Halliman, Marlon Brando;
was also invited, but was unable
to come.
Hallinan, whose wife and four,
sons were arrested, stated, "These !
demonstrations were not spontan-j
eous. On the contrary, they have |
been carefully planned by the
NAACP and are a last resort i
after many long hours of nego-!
tiations." He emphasized that
most of the students were from
the University of California at
Berkeley and San Francisco State.
He said he knew that three Stan
ford students had been arrested.,
There will probably be no fine
for the demonstrators, according
to Hallinan. Charges were dis
missed last month for the persons
arrested at the first Cadillac agen
cy sit-in.
Only one injury was reported, j
John Tin ley was taken to Central
Emergency Hospital l'oi-examina
tion after he was reportedly hit
on the head by an ash tray wield
ed by a Chrysler executive.
THIS DEMONSTRATION was
similar in all respects to the
earlier sit-in, with the exception
that police seemed to have been
instructed in more gentle tech
niques for removing demonstra-i
tors. A plainclothes police ser
geant instructed several officers!
to keep the demonstrators' heads!
up, and in the case of women,
to keep their dresses down. This;
is in sharp contrast to the treat-j
ment the sit-in demonstrators re- !
ceived in 1960 at the "Black Fri-j
day" HUAC meeting.
This is the fifth civil rights
demonstration since November 2, |
when Mel's Drive-In became the I
scene of a sit-in. On March first, j
123 demonstrators were arrested j
for sitting outside the Sheraton-j
Palace Hotel. The first, auto- j
mobile agency sit-in was held on
March 6 and 7, when .107 people;
were jailed for sitting-in at the
Cadillac agency on Van Ness.

after many long hours of nego-!
tiations." He emphasized that
most of the students were from
the University of California at
Berkeley and San Francisco State.
He said he knew that three Stan
ford students had been arrested.,
There will probably be no fine
for the demonstrators, according
to Hallinan. Charges were dis
missed last month for the persons
arrested at the first Cadillac agen
cy sit-in.
Only one injury was reported, j
John Tin ley was taken to Central
Emergency Hospital l'oi-examina
tion after he was reportedly hit
on the head by an ash tray wield
ed by a Chrysler executive.
THIS DEMONSTRATION was
similar in all respects to the
earlier sit-in, with the exception
that police seemed to have been
instructed in more gentle tech
niques for removing demonstra-i
tors. A plainclothes police ser
geant instructed several officers!
to keep the demonstrators' heads!
up, and in the case of women,
to keep their dresses down. This;
is in sharp contrast to the treat-j
ment the sit-in demonstrators re- !
ceived in 1960 at the "Black Fri-j
day" HUAC meeting.
This is the fifth civil rights
demonstration since November 2, |
when Mel's Drive-In became the I
scene of a sit-in. On March first, j
123 demonstrators were arrested j
for sitting outside the Sheraton-j
Palace Hotel. The first, auto- j
mobile agency sit-in was held on
March 6 and 7, when .107 people;
were jailed for sitting-in at the
Cadillac agency on Van Ness.
I\vo hundred thirty civil rights
demonstrators were arrested in
San Francisco yesterday at Ihe
first sit-in in a month, staged Sat
urday afternoon. Three Van Ness
automobile agencies were in
volved Cadillac, Jim Wessman's
Lincoln-Mercury, and Chrysler-
Plymouth.
According to San Francisco
City Prison, only five of the dem
onstrators had not been hailed
out by Saturday night. The other
225 were booked for four charges
and released on $76 bail.
IN A SPECIAL interview, at
torney Vincent Hallinan told The
DAILY, "This will not be our
last demonstration. The demon
strators have negotiated long
enough with these people, with
nothing to show for it. We plan
another sit-in Saturday at 11
a.m. at the same agencies."
Hallinan, as the attorney for
the demonstrators, posted their!
total bail of $4122. The money [
came from the United Freedom !
Fund, which was organized fori
that purpose.
This was the most defiant dem
onstration of the year. The dem-!
onstrators, mostly white students,
invaded the executive's offices,
climbed into the cars in the show
rooms, continuously sang songs,
and chanted.
MOVIE ACTOR Sterling Hay
den was among those arrested.
Five officers were required to
carry him out. According to at
torney Halliman, Marlon Brando;
was also invited, but was unable
to come.
Hallinan, whose wife and four,
sons were arrested, stated, "These !
demonstrations were not spontan-j
eous. On the contrary, they have |
been carefully planned by the
NAACP and are a last resort i
after many long hours of nego-!
tiations." He emphasized that
