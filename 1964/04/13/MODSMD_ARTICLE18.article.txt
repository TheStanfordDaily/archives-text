## Stanford Nine Unable To Hack Bruin Pitching, Batting; Drops Doubleheader 
### PETE KING 
Unable to coordinate hitting
and pitching, the Tribe baseball
team dropped a pair of CIBA
games 1o UCLA Saturday in
Sunken Diamond, 16-7 and 1-0.
The Cards seek a measure of re
venge against the south with a
3 p.m. homo clash with USC to
day.
Things started off well enough
for tho Indians Saturday. Three
Indian hits loaded tho bases, and
a walk and a hit batter brought
across two runs in the first inn
ing.
AFTER THE Bruins had ral
lied in the third on 230-pound first
baseman Randy Schwartz's sharp
single to right field and a run
scoring walk, Stanford tied it
and went ahead.
The tie came whon catcher Jim
Hibbs belted a double down the
right field line, and took third
on the throwing error. Lon Ray

mond then singled him homo.
Hibbs also was responsible for
Iho go-ahearl runs, hitting as
weird a homo run as has ever
beon seen in Sunken Diamond.
Ho eamo up in tho fifth inning
wilh Bob Cox on first and
whisllod a hard lino drive to left;
field. The ball hit halfway up tho
grass near tho 360-foot mark.
Owing either to tho long grass
or his poor eyesight, loft fielder
Jerry Harmon couldn't find tho
ball. Cox and Hihbs had long
since scored whon an umpire
trotted out. and found the ball for
the embarrassed Harmon.
THEN THE roof fell in. In
the seventh, George Lawson
came in to relieve starter Terry
Docken. who had boon having
control troubles, walking nine
and allowing five earned runs.
Lawson quickly skyrocketed his
ERA whon five more earned
runs crossed the plate.
UCLA loaded the bases. Then,
a wild fielder's choice throw by
shortstop Gary Smith, a walk, a
Schwartz triple chased home the
live runs.
That finished Lawson, and
Coach Dutch Fohring sent in
Davo Dickson to end the inning.
But in the eighth, two triples,
two singles, and a walk resulted
in four more Bruin tallies.
SCHWARTZ MADE up for a
sluggish performance at first by

going three for three, walking
three times, and batting in five.
Infielder Bill Macri collected two
triples and three RBl's. For Stan
ford, Raymond had two singles
in throe trips, batting in three.
Even though the score was
close in tho second contest,
UCLA's Bill Brasher clearly won
his pitching duel with John Ma
son. Brasher allowed only one
Indian to roach first base — that
was Poto Middlehauff, and he did
it twice, the second time mak
ing Schwartz look like a ham

burger by sliding tinder the big
boy's feeble tag.
Mason struck out 10, but
j walked seven. A Fred Dyer
: double and a Macri single in tho
fourth were enough for victory.
UCLA left 12 runners on (26 for
the day), while Stanford had
none.
The twin loss kept Stanford in
fifih place in the CIBA, while
dropping their season record to
12-10. UCLA gained second place
with the sweep.
USC COMES here fresh from
h a n di n g Santa Clara its first
CIBA defeat Saturday. The Tro
jans are essentially the same
team that won tho NCAA title
last year. Leading the southern
ers are contorfielder (and part
time halfback* Willie Brown, All-
American catcher Bud Hollowell,
and outfielder Doug Gabriolson.

The Trojans are 16-11 on tho
year, but their losses include a
4-2 L.A. Dodger loss, and losses
to the Dodger All-Stars and Phil
lies rookies.
