# SCHLICKE RUNS BEST MILE
## Tribe Thinclads Trounced By Trojans 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
Southern Cat's undefeated de
fending national champions had
too much for Stanford's track
team Saturday and the result was
a 95-50 pasting for the Indian's
third straight defeat.
Bright spots were few and far
between for the few Tribe fans
who made the trek to the Los
Angeles Coliseum to watch the
meet. From the very first final
result to come in, the outcome
was a foregone conclusion.
Les Mills, the former captain
of the New Zealand Olympic team
set: the tone for the meet by win
ning that first event, the shot put,
with a 57-BV2 toss. Two other
Trojans place second and third to
sweep th e event and open the
rout.
But there were at least two
highlights that gave Indian back
ers a chance to do a little smiling.
These were the two events won by
junior distance star Paul Schlicke.
Schlicke opened his afternoon
with the best college mile of the
current season, a 4:03.1. Paul was
pressed into this best effort of
his career by Bruce Bess, th e
strong sophomore from La Habra.
Bess pushed Schlicke all the way
and wound up with a 4:03.2, the
second best collegiate clocking of
the season, to finish one yard
back.
The Stanford distance ace came
back a little over an hour later
to run his second best two mile

of the season. This one was an
8:58.8. McCalla, in a reversal of
last week's form, pushed Trojan
Sterling Jenkins down to the wire,
finishing third in 9:05.6, his best
effort of the year.
Bill Pratt provided another
bright spot for the Cards when
he put on another of his gutty
stretch runs in the 880 to edge
SC's Chris Johnson and Redskin
Bob Milt/, in 1:51.2.
Steve Cortright, competing in
four events, was again the lead
ing point-getter for tho Tribe. The
co-captain participated in four
events, one a relay. He set a meet
record in the only one he won,
the 330 intermediate hurdles. The
time in that, race was 37.2, best
college clooking of th e season,
beating Rex Cawley's old mark
by two tenths of a second. Cawley
set the record last year prior to
winning the NCAA championship
in tho event.
Mills, the victor in the shot and
the discus, was the only double
winner in the meet, except for
Schlicke. He beat Stanford soph
omore Bob Stoeeker for the first
time of his life in the discus with
a 176 foot toss.
Meet records were set in five
events, altogether, by both teams.
Stanford's two records were

right's in the* low hurdles. SC
Schlicke's in the mile and Cort
form in the print relay, running
a record 41.1, in the broad jump,
where Wellesley Clayton, a junior
college transfer, did 25''4" on his
. only jump, and in the pole vault,
where Mike Flanagan did 15-9 to
better Ron Morris' old, pre-fiber
glass, record.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
was not overly disappointed by
his team's showing. "We did
about as well as we had any right
to expect," he said on Sunday.
"Schlicke, Pratt and Cortright
again gave us their all-out, gutty
best and some of the other boys
came through quite well, too."
