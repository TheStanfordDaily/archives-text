# Who, What, When, Where, But Mainly Why?
## Editorial 
### 
1 here is something new under the sun.
It's a new University regulation.
The "administration" has announced a
new policy forbidding the posting of signs
in the windows of dormitories. We have
put the word "administration" in quotes
simply because we cannot find out who
made the decision.
John Forsberg, director of residences,
said that the rule was made in a meeting
ol the Housing and Food Service Commit
tee. Dean Clark, director of W ilbur Hall,
said that no decision regarding this matter
had been given him, and that he did not
think the decision came from the Housing
and Food Service Committee. Dean 11.
Donald Winbigler said that the decision

came as a result of a meeting of the direc
tors of the various residences. Miss Mulhol
lan, director of Roble, said that no new ac
tion had been taken and that the rule has
always been around. Fred Glover, execu
tive assistant to President Sterling, said he
has heard nothing about such a ruling.
Anyway, girls in Roble and Branner have
been ordered to remove signs from their
windows; the men at Wilbur and Stern have
received no such order.
Regardless of who promulgated the or
der. we simply want to ask: Why is the
University administration wasting its time
on such a petty matter?
11 there is such a great desire for Univer
sity betterment along parochial lines, by the

administration, then we suggest the follow
ing areas of distress:
1. There is a policy now which limits
stack hours to J-5 p.m. on Sunday afternoons
during Spring Quarter. Why? We would
like to sec this policy reviewed and revised.
After all, some people do study during
Spring Quarter.
2. The washroom facilities around th e
campus are in great need of attention, not
only periodic cleanings, but basic improve
ments.
3. The lighting in front of the Library
is non-existent. The chances of a fall on the

library steps present a clear danger. A little
light here would be most welcome.
These three suggestions, dealing w i th
"petty" subjects are a small sample of the
many constructive improvements which
might be made in and around the Univer
sity.
Hut instead we busy ourselves with signs
in dormitory windows. One can but wonder.

said that the rule was made in a meeting
ol the Housing and Food Service Commit
tee. Dean Clark, director of W ilbur Hall,
said that no decision regarding this matter
had been given him, and that he did not
think the decision came from the Housing
and Food Service Committee. Dean 11.
Donald Winbigler said that the decision

came as a result of a meeting of the direc
tors of the various residences. Miss Mulhol
lan, director of Roble, said that no new ac
tion had been taken and that the rule has
always been around. Fred Glover, execu
tive assistant to President Sterling, said he
has heard nothing about such a ruling.
Anyway, girls in Roble and Branner have
been ordered to remove signs from their
windows; the men at Wilbur and Stern have
received no such order.
Regardless of who promulgated the or
der. we simply want to ask: Why is the
University administration wasting its time
on such a petty matter?
11 there is such a great desire for Univer
sity betterment along parochial lines, by the

administration, then we suggest the follow
ing areas of distress:
1. There is a policy now which limits
stack hours to J-5 p.m. on Sunday afternoons
during Spring Quarter. Why? We would
like to sec this policy reviewed and revised.
After all, some people do study during
Spring Quarter.
2. The washroom facilities around th e
campus are in great need of attention, not
only periodic cleanings, but basic improve
ments.
3. The lighting in front of the Library
is non-existent. The chances of a fall on the

library steps present a clear danger. A little
light here would be most welcome.
These three suggestions, dealing w i th
"petty" subjects are a small sample of the
many constructive improvements which
might be made in and around the Univer
sity.
Hut instead we busy ourselves with signs
in dormitory windows. One can but wonder.
