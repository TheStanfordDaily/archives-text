# Democracy
## 
### 
With the filing dead line for the June 2
California primary officially past, we feel
free to speak out on what we consider a
grave distortion of the democratic process.

Republican candidates Nelson A. Rocke
feller and Harold Stassen employed a profes
sional name-gathering firm to collect the
necessary 13,702 valid signatures qualifying
them lor the ballot. Reports indicate t li e v
were paying from 35 cents to $1 per name
(plus 5 cents extra for each one certified).
DEMOCRACY SHOULD NOT be
limited to those with wealth.
At the same time, the requirement for a
minimum number of nominating signatures
is a proper means of keeping off the ballot
hordes of half-serious candidates or those
with little popular support
We believe that resorting to paid profes
sionals in this process is a perversion of the
original intentions of the law.
