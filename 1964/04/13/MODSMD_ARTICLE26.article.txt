# Perspective On The Future
## Scranton: Brinkmanship Necessary Policy Tool 
### Stephen Shefler 
Stuart Alsop, Theodore White, and U.S. New and World Re
port have all within the past two weeks stated that William Scran
ton is the logical Republican naminee in 1964. They feel that
Scranton's philosophy is most acceptable to both the conserva
tive and liberal wings of the Republican Party.
It has, however, been asserted by those opposing Scranton that
his appeal to both sides rests on the laet that people do not know
where he stands. If this is true, it is because the people have not
looked to find out. Governor Scranton stands on the major prob
lems of national importance are:
• Civil Rights: Governor Scranton unequivocally supports the
present bill before Congress. As Governor of Pennsylvania, how
ever, he feels this bill is insufficient, and has proposed a broad
program for action in the fields of housing, education, and em
ployment to help tire Negro community. In recent speeches
Scranton lias placed his major emphasis on the necessity for a
long range well planned program to help the Negroes.
• Labor: He supports the Taft-Hartley Act, and feels that the
restraints it imposes on union officials are both valuable and
necessary.
• Public Welfare: When in Congress, Scranton opposed Medi
care, the Public Works Act, and the establishment of an office of
urban affairs. He feels that the Democrats' "leave it to Washing
ton" attitude is detrimental, and favors public welfare action on
the state level except where national action is necessary.
Thus he supported the Area Redevelopment Bill when in Con
gress, and has enacted a broad program of public welfare meas
ures on the state level. According to the Saturday Review, "When
Scranton came into office, Pennsylvania's public welfare programs
were inadequate; now Pennsylvania is ahead of most states in
what it is doing to combat poverty and unemployment and ensure
the health of elderly people.
• Foreign Affairs: lie feels the policy of "brinkmanship is a
necessary tool in our foreign policy, and praises Kennedy's use of
it in the Cuban crisis. Where he differs from the present adminis
tration is in his belief that the cohesion of the West should take
priority over easing the tension between the Soviet Union and
the United States.

A strong Western Alliance should, according to Scranton, be
the primary goal of our foreign policy, and then in a strengthened
position we should do that negotiating with the Soviet Union j
which will be beneficial. Additionally, to improve the position of
the West, Scranton feels we should exploit the Sino-Soviet rift.
Regarding Castro, Scranton feels that Cuba is a menace to
the entiie Western Hemisphere and should not be allowed to
flourish. He advocates imposing a quarantine of Cuba designed
to keep allied ships out of Cuban ports; if that proved of no real |
value, he would re-impose a blockade.
It is important that the people have an ample opportunity to I
assess the philosophy of this potential draftee. Many of those who
have taken the time to evaluate the man and his program have
become Scranton supporters. Indications are many will follow.

restraints it imposes on union officials are both valuable and
necessary.
• Public Welfare: When in Congress, Scranton opposed Medi
care, the Public Works Act, and the establishment of an office of
urban affairs. He feels that the Democrats' "leave it to Washing
ton" attitude is detrimental, and favors public welfare action on
the state level except where national action is necessary.

the entiie Western Hemisphere and should not be allowed to
flourish. He advocates imposing a quarantine of Cuba designed
to keep allied ships out of Cuban ports; if that proved of no real |

assess the philosophy of this potential draftee. Many of those who
have taken the time to evaluate the man and his program have
become Scranton supporters. Indications are many will follow.

Stuart Alsop, Theodore White, and U.S. New and World Re

Scranton's philosophy is most acceptable to both the conserva
