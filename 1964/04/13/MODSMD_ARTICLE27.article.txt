# LASSU Would Control Rush Policies
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
On Thursday night of last
week there w r as a motion at
the LASSU meeting to bring
a proposal which would place
rush policies under the control
("final authority") of LASSU
out of the by-law committee in
order to vote on it and have
it passed.
This proposal was described
by its advocates as being a
harmless step, creating a me
chanism so that the new rush
proposal could be brought up
for discussion in LASSU. The
idea that this proposal, if
passed, would take the juris
diction over rush policies and
procedures away from t hose
bodies which engage in r us h
and give it to LASSU seems to
have been played down.
The proposal was explained
as a timely move to legalize
what has been happening in
the past.
In reality . . . the groups in
volved will no longer have the
last word on the policies they
will follow nor will they retain
the ability to ever have that
word again.
Another aspect of this pro
posal indirectly gives the en
dorsement of all groups in
volved to whatever policy
LASSU decides on. This en
dorsement stems from the
makeup of the proposed com
mittee..
Although it would seem that
all the fraternities support
this proposal, because their
president is a member of the
committee, there was never
any discussion of this pro
posal at an IFC meeting.
There seems to have been a
lack of representation of the
fraternities in forming these
proposals.
Fortunately the motion
failed and our jurisdiction
over our own problems was

not given away. Now it is up
1o all parties involved to dis
cuss the proposal with their
constituencies and to present
their opinions at the nexl
LASSU meeting. I hope that
the turnout will be a forceful
show of the will of the groups
involved to retain the author
ity to solve their own individ
ual and different problems in
their own individual and sepa
rate ways.

I saw the high heeled shoes
by t he door
Now whal on earth are they
there for
Joan's inside, she's talking on
war
Bare feet, and what's more
A beautiful voice and much
folklore
Now what on earth is this
about war?
War is bad you'll all agree
Except of course its kept men
free.
60 per cent, I heard her say,
60 per cent, I will not pay.
But what of the war on
poverty,
What if the Russians bomb
you and me.
40 per cent, for peace I'll pay
You'll fight no wars for mo
today.
But Joan I said, what can I
do
Except pay for war and not
peace too.
I'll withhold as Thoreau would
And keep the ratio as it stood.
Or perhaps I'll pay it all
And on each coin however
small
I'll write out clearly that I'm
right.
That peace will go if men
won't fight.

A few words in answer to
Mr. Heyl's letter criticizing
rush and pro p o sing open
discussion of the possibility of
abolishing eating clubs and
fraternities. This annual ex
change of opinions concerning
rush, fraternities, etc. may
bore some to tears.
1 tend to be one of those, par
ticularly in this, my fourth
year until somebody like Mr.
Heyl proposes abolishing what
exists and establishing some
idyllic dormitory system
(what else could it be?) where
everybody would enthusiasti
cally welcome every day the
opportunity for "complete and
free intellectual exchange"
(Mr. Heyl's words) with those
they liked, disliked and were
indifferent to.
The fact seems apparent to
me that people choose groups
to belong to whose members
they admire and enjoy. Re
ciprocally, groups accept those
whom they appreciate. Frater
nities and clubs are grou ps
that are institutionalized, a nd
I wholly support these ways
of living without condoning
Ihe immaturity which mani
fests itself from time to time
in all such groups. Shaping up
the drawbacks of fraternal liv
ing is one thing; abolishing
this way of living completely
is another.
People will assimilate with
those whom they have some
time in common with. It is
plausible and constructive to
make sure that such assimila
tions don't foster immature
thought and action. It is no
answer at all to attempt solu
tion of the problems by de
stroying the institution of
group living and throwing
everybody together in order to
make them freely exchange.
I'm sorry, Mr. Heyl, it won't
work; people aren't that way.

I saw the high heeled shoes
by t he door
Now whal on earth are they
there for
Joan's inside, she's talking on
war
Bare feet, and what's more
A beautiful voice and much
folklore
Now what on earth is this
about war?
War is bad you'll all agree
Except of course its kept men
free.
60 per cent, I heard her say,
60 per cent, I will not pay.
But what of the war on
poverty,
What if the Russians bomb
you and me.
40 per cent, for peace I'll pay
You'll fight no wars for mo
today.
But Joan I said, what can I
do
Except pay for war and not
peace too.
I'll withhold as Thoreau would
And keep the ratio as it stood.
Or perhaps I'll pay it all
And on each coin however
small
I'll write out clearly that I'm
right.
That peace will go if men
won't fight.

A few words in answer to
Mr. Heyl's letter criticizing
rush and pro p o sing open
discussion of the possibility of
abolishing eating clubs and
fraternities. This annual ex
change of opinions concerning
rush, fraternities, etc. may
bore some to tears.
1 tend to be one of those, par
ticularly in this, my fourth
year until somebody like Mr.
Heyl proposes abolishing what
exists and establishing some
idyllic dormitory system
(what else could it be?) where
everybody would enthusiasti
cally welcome every day the
opportunity for "complete and
free intellectual exchange"
(Mr. Heyl's words) with those
they liked, disliked and were
indifferent to.
The fact seems apparent to
me that people choose groups
to belong to whose members
they admire and enjoy. Re
ciprocally, groups accept those
whom they appreciate. Frater
nities and clubs are grou ps
that are institutionalized, a nd
I wholly support these ways
of living without condoning
Ihe immaturity which mani
fests itself from time to time
in all such groups. Shaping up
the drawbacks of fraternal liv
ing is one thing; abolishing
this way of living completely
is another.
People will assimilate with
those whom they have some
time in common with. It is
plausible and constructive to
make sure that such assimila
tions don't foster immature
thought and action. It is no
answer at all to attempt solu
tion of the problems by de
stroying the institution of
group living and throwing
everybody together in order to
make them freely exchange.
I'm sorry, Mr. Heyl, it won't
work; people aren't that way.

Editor, The Daily:
On Thursday night of last
week there w r as a motion at
the LASSU meeting to bring
a proposal which would place
rush policies under the control
("final authority") of LASSU
out of the by-law committee in
order to vote on it and have
it passed.
This proposal was described
by its advocates as being a
harmless step, creating a me
chanism so that the new rush
proposal could be brought up
for discussion in LASSU. The
idea that this proposal, if
passed, would take the juris
diction over rush policies and
procedures away from t hose
bodies which engage in r us h
and give it to LASSU seems to
have been played down.
The proposal was explained
as a timely move to legalize
what has been happening in
the past.
In reality . . . the groups in
volved will no longer have the
last word on the policies they
will follow nor will they retain
the ability to ever have that
word again.
Another aspect of this pro
posal indirectly gives the en
dorsement of all groups in
volved to whatever policy
LASSU decides on. This en
dorsement stems from the
makeup of the proposed com
mittee..
Although it would seem that
all the fraternities support
this proposal, because their
president is a member of the
committee, there was never
any discussion of this pro
posal at an IFC meeting.
There seems to have been a
lack of representation of the
fraternities in forming these
proposals.
Fortunately the motion
failed and our jurisdiction
over our own problems was

not given away. Now it is up
1o all parties involved to dis
cuss the proposal with their
constituencies and to present
their opinions at the nexl
LASSU meeting. I hope that
the turnout will be a forceful
show of the will of the groups
involved to retain the author
ity to solve their own individ
ual and different problems in
their own individual and sepa
rate ways.

Editor, The Daily:
On Thursday night of last
week there w r as a motion at
the LASSU meeting to bring
a proposal which would place
rush policies under the control
("final authority") of LASSU
out of the by-law committee in
order to vote on it and have
it passed.
This proposal was described
by its advocates as being a
harmless step, creating a me
chanism so that the new rush
proposal could be brought up
for discussion in LASSU. The
idea that this proposal, if
passed, would take the juris
diction over rush policies and
procedures away from t hose
bodies which engage in r us h
and give it to LASSU seems to
have been played down.
The proposal was explained
as a timely move to legalize
what has been happening in
the past.
In reality . . . the groups in
volved will no longer have the
last word on the policies they
will follow nor will they retain
the ability to ever have that
word again.
Another aspect of this pro
posal indirectly gives the en
dorsement of all groups in
volved to whatever policy
LASSU decides on. This en
dorsement stems from the
makeup of the proposed com
mittee..
Although it would seem that
all the fraternities support
this proposal, because their
president is a member of the
committee, there was never
any discussion of this pro
posal at an IFC meeting.
There seems to have been a
lack of representation of the
fraternities in forming these
proposals.
Fortunately the motion
failed and our jurisdiction
over our own problems was

not given away. Now it is up
1o all parties involved to dis
cuss the proposal with their
constituencies and to present
their opinions at the nexl
LASSU meeting. I hope that
the turnout will be a forceful
show of the will of the groups
involved to retain the author
ity to solve their own individ
ual and different problems in
their own individual and sepa
rate ways.

Editor, The Daily:
I saw the high heeled shoes
by t he door
Now whal on earth are they
there for
Joan's inside, she's talking on
war
Bare feet, and what's more
A beautiful voice and much
folklore
Now what on earth is this
about war?
War is bad you'll all agree
Except of course its kept men
free.
60 per cent, I heard her say,
60 per cent, I will not pay.
But what of the war on
poverty,
What if the Russians bomb
you and me.
40 per cent, for peace I'll pay
You'll fight no wars for mo
today.
But Joan I said, what can I
do
Except pay for war and not
peace too.
I'll withhold as Thoreau would
And keep the ratio as it stood.
Or perhaps I'll pay it all
And on each coin however
small
I'll write out clearly that I'm
right.
That peace will go if men
won't fight.

A few words in answer to
Mr. Heyl's letter criticizing
rush and pro p o sing open
discussion of the possibility of
abolishing eating clubs and
fraternities. This annual ex
change of opinions concerning
rush, fraternities, etc. may
bore some to tears.
1 tend to be one of those, par
ticularly in this, my fourth
year until somebody like Mr.
Heyl proposes abolishing what
exists and establishing some
idyllic dormitory system
(what else could it be?) where
everybody would enthusiasti
cally welcome every day the
opportunity for "complete and
free intellectual exchange"
(Mr. Heyl's words) with those
they liked, disliked and were
indifferent to.
The fact seems apparent to
me that people choose groups
to belong to whose members
they admire and enjoy. Re
