# Notes And Observations
## Missile Reliability II; LeMay, Possony Speak 
### John Bonine 
Ever since missile reliability became a political issue, Sccrctarv
<)l Defense Robert MeNamara has vowed 11 is hiitli in our missiles,
despite his testimony last year for the Senate, and contrary to
testimony b\ others.
AMONG I IIESE was Air Force Chiel of Stall Curtis hiAlav,
the man responsible for much of our strategic force. The follow-
J ing dialogue took place before the House Armed Services Com
j mittee on February 5, 1964:
Mil. Stratton. Now, (General, with regard to the MIN
UTEMAN you are not taking exception to the Secretary's
figures with regard to [missile reliability], are you?
General LeMay. 1 do have some differences of opinion.
Mr. Stha'Jton. W ell, is there a view similar to this one
on the part of the joint Chiefs of Staff that the figures that
the Secretary lias given us with regard to the reliability of
the MINUTEMAN are not correct?
General LeMay. Well, in this table the Secretary used
for a reliability rate of the surviving force . . . [deleted before

Other testimony brought out these facts: (1) McNamara's opti
mistic reliability estimates were projected figures for the fill are,
not current measurements; (2) although MeNamara asked for the
comments of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on his prepared testimony
to the House committee, and although the Defense Department
received the comments, MeNamara did not read them before testi
fying.
As for the dependability of the missiles themselves, five argu
ments were recently advanced by Stanford's Dr. Stefan Possony
in a January 21, 1964, letter to the San Francisco Examiner, re
printed in the Congressional Record of February 5:
"1. Ihe missile abort rate, while dramatically reduced, con
tinues to be high; unmanned systems are intrinsically less de
pendable than manned systems.
"2. No re-entry vehicle has yet been tested together with
its warhead. With the exception of a few not overly successful
Polaris high altitude shots, no U.S. missile has been tested from
launch to explosion-on-targct.
"3. The capability of the electric-electronic system in our
missiles (and other equipment) to withstand some critical
effects of high yield nuclear blasts is not accurately known.
"4. The capability of our hardened launch sites to protect
missiles undcrgound against nuclear hits and near-misses is not
accurately known.
"5. The effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the initial Soviet
antiballistie missile and its follownp system is not accurately
known.
"These uncertainties were not invented by Senator Gold
water. They were set forth at length by the most qualified wit
nesses testifying before Congress.'
After hearing testimony by both sides in this missile reliability
question, the House Armed Sendees Committee showed their faith
in MeNamara reliability by voting 33-4 to appropriate $52 million
for a manned bomber which the Secretary did not want.
