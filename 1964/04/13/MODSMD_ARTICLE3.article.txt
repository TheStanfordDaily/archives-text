• Salinger Speaks (hit On Civil Rights
LOS ANGELES The need for action will not end with passage
of the civil rights bill now pending in the Senate, U.S. senatorial
aspirant Pierre Salinger said yesterday.
"Where you have nonsegregated housing you have nonsegregated
schools. Where people can move up to better-paying jobs on the basis
of ability and can move around freely, you will have nonsegregated
housing," Salinger said.
"The best and surest way to keep the progress going," Salinger
