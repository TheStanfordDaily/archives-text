# Monkey Business Alarms Fire Dept.
## 
### 
An adolescent named Dennis
made u monkey out of 112 i ve.
lire companies last Wednesday.
When an alarm came in from
the Stitnford-Palo Alto II os
pital, several fire engines re
s|M>nded, only to discover that
it was a false alarm. The cul
prit was not hard to find, how
ever.
Dennis, a research monkey at
the hospital, had Immmi trained
to pull levers on a signal, and
to expect a banana pill in re
turn. When someone accidently
set his cage down next to a
hand-pull fire alarm, he decided
to impress his doctor-trainer
with his initiative.
Looking forward to another
hanana pill, he pulled the
bright red lever. No pill. But
lots of entertainment. And lots
of red faces.
Fire Inspector B<Â»l> Cleveland
was opposed to giving Dennis
any reward for this feat. The
practice might spread to Wil
bur.
