"Examining Iho whole spec
trum of possibilities from sur
render or appeasement to preven
tive war and doomsday machines,
it's clear that there are no clear
moral positions for the individ
uals his country.and the world."
This is the view of Dr. Herman
Kahn, keynote speaker in the In
stitute of International Relations'
conference on disarmament held
Saturday.
Kahn is currently director of
the Hudson Institute, an inde
pendent organization providing
analyses of problems relating to
national security.
IN THE AFTERNOON session,
a panel dealt with the local im
pact of disarmament 011 the de
fense industry. Dr. Carl Stover
of the Stanford Research Institute
moderated the discussion among
Dudley E. Brown, Group Vice
President of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation, Paul Schrade of the
United Auto Workers, Emmett
Cameron, Vice President of Va
rian Associates, and Hale Cham
pion, California Director of Fi
nance.
Brown stated, "We expect de
mands for defense production to
level off soon at a plateau. We
are at the end of a rapid growth
cycle, but rather than declining
production we are looking for a
more stable market."
Schrade expressed a pessimistic
attitude because "the 25 top de
fense producers feel no need to
plan for conversion from defense
to commercial production." He
stated, "There is no private or
government program to provide
for employment as disarmament
becomes a reality." "Industry's
horse and buggy attitude toward
employee relations has stymied
our efforts obtain them."
IN REPLY Cameron stated. "1
would take serious issue with Mr.
Sehrade's charge that industry is
disinterested with the dislocations
that will inevitably occur as de
fense spending levels off. Natur
ally there is a disinclination to
ward predicting doom for your
corporation it affects the stock
priceâ€”but actually it is matter
of life and death to know the fu
ture levels of demand."
He pointed out that this year
his industry has been going
through a "dress rehearsal" for
disarmament. Cameron noted fur
ther difficulties for industry in
preparing for conversion because
of the dangerously low profit
margins at which they are cur
rently forced to operate. But he
concluded, "We entered this situa
tion with our eyes open and of
our own volition. There is no cry
ing in the industry. We expect
little or no help from the govern
-1 ment nor do we want any. I think
any company that sits back and
waits for it is looking for trouble.
We should and ran work our
'own way on!."
