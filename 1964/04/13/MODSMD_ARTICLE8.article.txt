# Political Signs Banned From Dorm Windows
## But Politics Not A Motive 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Staff Editor 
Political posters, signs, and
bumper strips have been banned
! from dormitory windows because
of "unsightliness" and mainten
ance expense, the Daily learned
Friday.
Administration officials denied
that there were political motiva
tions behind the action.
THE "ORDER" itself came
from Director of Residences John
| Fovsberg. Upon questioning, he
1 said the policy would have to ap
; ply to all signs in windows, and
even empty liquor bottles, not
I just political posters.
Coeds in Branner and Roble
were ordered to remove posters
I immediately, although directors
deny that the action was a new
; policy. Posters in Stern and Wil
bur have not yet been removed.
The action in Branner and
Roble was evidently taken with
; out notifying the resident assis-
I tants.
ACCORDING TO one Branner
: freshman, a housekeeper told her
late last week that the poster in
her window had to come down.
Upon questioning, the housekeep
er told the coed that she was
\ working on "orders from Fors
i berg," whom she identified as
j "someone on Dean Allen's staff
| or something."
The coed said that at least a
I do/en posters had been removed
I over the weekend.
The action evidently caused
| some discussion in Branner. As
| this coed asked. "Why, if we're
i renting the rooms, don't we have
right to put posters in the win
dows as long as there is no per
manent damage?" A Branner di
rector, asked by ihe coed about
the policy, said that she had
"orders from above, and anyway,
it looks messy."
MISS ELIZABETH Parker, di
rector of Branner, denied that
there had been any policy change
over the way things had been
since she came to Stanford 1\[>
years ago.
She said just one coed had been
asked to take down a "campaign"
poster, and that was the only ac
tion taken.
In Roble one of the corridor
! presidents was told to sec that
all posters on her corridor be
: taken down. Finding that "not too
; many of the girls on my corridor
| liked it," she went to the Roble
[director, who stated that it was
i University policy. The coed
I thought that it was a new policy,
i since girls "have had posters up
;)ll vmv"

Til 10 REASONS for the now
policy, as stated by Forsberg, are
safety, aesthetics, and economy.
"In the first place, it is unsafe
! to be leaning out a window to
; put a bumper strip on it,"he
j said.
"Second is tlie aesthetic factor."
He stated that the signs look bad
land that the bottles in windows
; might be objected to "by little
old ladies from Palo Alto." He
i added lliat much of this problem
| could have been avoided if the
window sills had been constructed
| on a slant rather than level.
Till; THIRD REASON for the
I policy, he said, was increased
! maintenance costs. "We all pay
high room and board bills, and
tape on the windows makes them
even higher, since it has to be
cleaned off."
The circumstances of Fors
' berg's action remained unclear as
the Daily went to press. Forsberg
| told a Daily reporter that he had
issued the order, but was merely
I carrying out a policy of the Hous
! ing and Food Service Committee,
consisting of the Dean of Stu
i denls, Dean of Men, Dean of
Women, the residence and food
[ service directors, a n d Forsberg
' himself.
ACCORDING to Dean of Stu
j dents H. Donald Winbigler. who
I was away from Stanford at the
I time of the decision, the action
came as a result of a meeting of
several residence directors a n d
Forsberg.
Ho added that he could "gua
rantee beyond any shadow of a
doubt that there were no politic
al considerations involved."
Assistant Dean of Men and Di
j rector of Stern John Moore con
firmed this judgment. He said
i the topic merely came lip for dis-
I cussion at a meeting of the resi
j dence directors. Forsberg, he
j said, had noticed the posters and
I asked if they seemed "unseemly"
j or if there was any undue diffi
culty in removing the glue left
by bumper strips and tape.
MOORE SAID that it was Fors
berg's duty to "keep costs ai a
minimum." He emphasized that
there had been no "directive" and
that the decision had no political
; motivations.
Moore said that it was left up
to the directors to decide if main
tenance costs were being in
creased too greatly and to set the
policy accordingly. As director of
i Stern, he said, "lie had not given
! too much thought" to the policy.
Other directors of residences
! were unclear as to the authority
behind the action. Dean of Fresh
men Men and Director of Wilbur
Dwight Clark claimed that Wil
bur was not touched by the order
because "it was not regarded as
a problem." He thought that the
order had not come from th e
Housing and Food Services Com
mittee but from Forsberg him
self.
.â– Miss (iEKTKII)E Mulhollan.
director of Roble and assistant
1 dean of women, said that the no
! posters policy had been in effect
for man> years and that "no new
action" had been taken. She said
that Roble had awiiys been watch
ful for signs so that they could
! be removed immediately. The
| orders, Miss Mulhollan continued,
were always carried out through
student government.
1 Forsberg also said thai the Slit

dent-Faculty Committee on Em
ployment Services was involved
in the policy, but committee chair
woman Barbara Cochran said she
knows nothing of the policy.
The action evident! y was
prompted by bumper strips most
ly for "fair housing," in Stern
Hall, but the first posters an d
bumper strips removed in Bran
ner and Roble were boosting
Presidential candidate Barry Gold
water.

1 said the policy would have to ap
; ply to all signs in windows, and
even empty liquor bottles, not
I just political posters.
Coeds in Branner and Roble
were ordered to remove posters
I immediately, although directors
deny that the action was a new
; policy. Posters in Stern and Wil
bur have not yet been removed.
The action in Branner and
Roble was evidently taken with
; out notifying the resident assis-
I tants.
ACCORDING TO one Branner
: freshman, a housekeeper told her
late last week that the poster in
her window had to come down.
Upon questioning, the housekeep
er told the coed that she was
\ working on "orders from Fors
i berg," whom she identified as
j "someone on Dean Allen's staff
| or something."
The coed said that at least a
I do/en posters had been removed
I over the weekend.
The action evidently caused
| some discussion in Branner. As
| this coed asked. "Why, if we're
i renting the rooms, don't we have
right to put posters in the win
dows as long as there is no per
manent damage?" A Branner di
rector, asked by ihe coed about
the policy, said that she had
"orders from above, and anyway,
it looks messy."
MISS ELIZABETH Parker, di
rector of Branner, denied that
there had been any policy change
over the way things had been
since she came to Stanford 1\[>
years ago.
She said just one coed had been
asked to take down a "campaign"
poster, and that was the only ac
tion taken.
In Roble one of the corridor
! presidents was told to sec that
all posters on her corridor be
: taken down. Finding that "not too
; many of the girls on my corridor
| liked it," she went to the Roble
[director, who stated that it was
i University policy. The coed
I thought that it was a new policy,
i since girls "have had posters up
;)ll vmv"

Til 10 REASONS for the now
policy, as stated by Forsberg, are
safety, aesthetics, and economy.
"In the first place, it is unsafe
! to be leaning out a window to
; put a bumper strip on it,"he
j said.
"Second is tlie aesthetic factor."
He stated that the signs look bad
land that the bottles in windows
; might be objected to "by little
old ladies from Palo Alto." He
i added lliat much of this problem
| could have been avoided if the
window sills had been constructed
| on a slant rather than level.
Till; THIRD REASON for the
I policy, he said, was increased
! maintenance costs. "We all pay
high room and board bills, and
tape on the windows makes them
even higher, since it has to be
cleaned off."
The circumstances of Fors
' berg's action remained unclear as
the Daily went to press. Forsberg
| told a Daily reporter that he had
issued the order, but was merely
I carrying out a policy of the Hous
! ing and Food Service Committee,
consisting of the Dean of Stu
i denls, Dean of Men, Dean of
Women, the residence and food
[ service directors, a n d Forsberg
' himself.
ACCORDING to Dean of Stu
j dents H. Donald Winbigler. who
I was away from Stanford at the
I time of the decision, the action
came as a result of a meeting of
several residence directors a n d
Forsberg.
Ho added that he could "gua
rantee beyond any shadow of a
doubt that there were no politic
al considerations involved."
Assistant Dean of Men and Di
j rector of Stern John Moore con
firmed this judgment. He said
i the topic merely came lip for dis-
I cussion at a meeting of the resi
j dence directors. Forsberg, he
j said, had noticed the posters and
I asked if they seemed "unseemly"
j or if there was any undue diffi
culty in removing the glue left
by bumper strips and tape.
MOORE SAID that it was Fors
berg's duty to "keep costs ai a
minimum." He emphasized that
there had been no "directive" and
that the decision had no political
; motivations.
Moore said that it was left up
to the directors to decide if main
tenance costs were being in
creased too greatly and to set the
policy accordingly. As director of
i Stern, he said, "lie had not given
! too much thought" to the policy.
Other directors of residences
! were unclear as to the authority
behind the action. Dean of Fresh
men Men and Director of Wilbur
Dwight Clark claimed that Wil
bur was not touched by the order
because "it was not regarded as
a problem." He thought that the
order had not come from th e
Housing and Food Services Com
mittee but from Forsberg him
self.

; out notifying the resident assis-
I tants.
ACCORDING TO one Branner
: freshman, a housekeeper told her
late last week that the poster in
her window had to come down.
Upon questioning, the housekeep
er told the coed that she was
\ working on "orders from Fors
i berg," whom she identified as
j "someone on Dean Allen's staff
| or something."
The coed said that at least a
I do/en posters had been removed
I over the weekend.
The action evidently caused
| some discussion in Branner. As
| this coed asked. "Why, if we're
i renting the rooms, don't we have
right to put posters in the win
dows as long as there is no per
manent damage?" A Branner di
rector, asked by ihe coed about
the policy, said that she had
"orders from above, and anyway,
it looks messy."
MISS ELIZABETH Parker, di
rector of Branner, denied that
there had been any policy change
over the way things had been
since she came to Stanford 1\[>
years ago.
She said just one coed had been
asked to take down a "campaign"
poster, and that was the only ac
tion taken.
In Roble one of the corridor
! presidents was told to sec that
all posters on her corridor be
: taken down. Finding that "not too
; many of the girls on my corridor
| liked it," she went to the Roble
[director, who stated that it was
i University policy. The coed
I thought that it was a new policy,
i since girls "have had posters up
;)ll vmv"

Til 10 REASONS for the now
policy, as stated by Forsberg, are
safety, aesthetics, and economy.
"In the first place, it is unsafe
! to be leaning out a window to
; put a bumper strip on it,"he
j said.
"Second is tlie aesthetic factor."
He stated that the signs look bad
land that the bottles in windows
; might be objected to "by little
old ladies from Palo Alto." He
i added lliat much of this problem
| could have been avoided if the
window sills had been constructed
| on a slant rather than level.
Till; THIRD REASON for the
I policy, he said, was increased
! maintenance costs. "We all pay
high room and board bills, and
tape on the windows makes them
even higher, since it has to be
cleaned off."
The circumstances of Fors
' berg's action remained unclear as
the Daily went to press. Forsberg
| told a Daily reporter that he had
issued the order, but was merely
I carrying out a policy of the Hous
! ing and Food Service Committee,
consisting of the Dean of Stu
i denls, Dean of Men, Dean of
Women, the residence and food
[ service directors, a n d Forsberg
' himself.
ACCORDING to Dean of Stu
j dents H. Donald Winbigler. who
I was away from Stanford at the
I time of the decision, the action
came as a result of a meeting of
several residence directors a n d
Forsberg.
Ho added that he could "gua
rantee beyond any shadow of a
doubt that there were no politic
al considerations involved."
Assistant Dean of Men and Di
j rector of Stern John Moore con
firmed this judgment. He said
i the topic merely came lip for dis-
I cussion at a meeting of the resi
j dence directors. Forsberg, he
j said, had noticed the posters and
I asked if they seemed "unseemly"
j or if there was any undue diffi
culty in removing the glue left
by bumper strips and tape.
MOORE SAID that it was Fors
berg's duty to "keep costs ai a
minimum." He emphasized that
there had been no "directive" and
that the decision had no political
; motivations.
Moore said that it was left up
to the directors to decide if main
tenance costs were being in
creased too greatly and to set the
policy accordingly. As director of
i Stern, he said, "lie had not given
! too much thought" to the policy.
Other directors of residences
! were unclear as to the authority
behind the action. Dean of Fresh
men Men and Director of Wilbur
Dwight Clark claimed that Wil
bur was not touched by the order
because "it was not regarded as
a problem." He thought that the
order had not come from th e
Housing and Food Services Com
mittee but from Forsberg him
self.

for man> years and that "no new

that Roble had awiiys been watch

were always carried out through

in the policy, but committee chair
