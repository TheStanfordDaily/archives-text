and national peace activities, and
Ira Sand perl, a tax refuser a n <1
pacifist serving as a counselor

Tresidder on "Refusal of War
Taxes."
Following their talks, Kepler
and Sandpcrl will be questioned
by political science Professor Ar
nold Rogow, after which there
will be an open discussion.
NONPAYMENT of war taxes
by pacifists is a way of demon
strating non-support of military
spending and efforts directed to
ward preparation for war. Non
payment can take several forms
such as avoiding tax liability by
earning less 1h a n a taxable
amount, removing oneself as
much as possible from the war
economy) or incurring tax lia
bility by earning a taxable
amount and refusing to pay. This
latter method stresses the impor
tance of reaching the public with
a vigorous protest.
In 1956. in making his first re
fusal to pay war taxes, Kepler
wrote, "Now. not later, is the
time for men to refuse to be
silent acquiescers in a process
which ultimately promises tÂ«i
make them both victims and
executioners."
