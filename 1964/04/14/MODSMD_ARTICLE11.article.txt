## California Students Devote Vacations To Build, Not Blast, Tijuana 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
Traditionally California college students go to
Tijuana to cul loose, to raise havoc; this spring vaca
tion, some forty students journeyed southward with a
different motive. They were Stanford's representatives
to "Project Amigos," an experiment in international
aid and cooperation.
The outskirts of Tijuana seem an arid and hopeless
region to the American eye. But il is a veritable land
of milk and honey to a mass of impoverished Mexican
out landers who yearly move to Tijuana to live off the
town and its notorious tourist trade. For many, such
a move means an increase in yearly income from ap
proximately $74 to nearly $154.
The result of this internal immigration during the
past few years, has been the establishment of a popu
lation of over 80,000 in six or seven "eolonias," or squat
ter communities, on the fringes of Tijuana. Life in the
eolonias is characterized by a strange commingling of
lingering poverty and new pride. The houses are
nothing more than huts; sanitation facilities are clean,
but primitive. And. of course, from the eolonias come
the hordes of beggars that crowd the Tijuana streets.
Yet for every beggar, despondently "satisfied" with
his life, there is a man with aspirations that transcend
his condition. The squatter is eager for work, but his
skills and opportunities are few.
In March of 15W2 a corporation composed largely of
San Diego businessmen, was formed which dedicated
itself to "plan, share, coordinate and promote activities
and projects concerned with social welfare, health, rec
reation. and education in Tijuana, Mexico."
Immediately the government of Mexico donated land

for (he projects headquarters, and volunteer help con
verted ten war surplus buildings into a genuine Com
munity Center. The keystone of the new center is the
Laubach Literacy School, manned by a permanent staff
of Mexican and American instructors, and designed to
leach elementary Spanish and English to both children
and adults. Clustered around the Literacy School is a
community kitchen, a clinic and nurses' training school,
adults' and children's classrooms, a social work head
quarters. a warehouse for food and clothing, a youth
and group clubhouse, and a vocational and trade school.
Since Ihe project's inception, the responsibility for
the construction of new facilities has largely fallen to
volunteer help from California's collegiate population.
Stanford students formed only a small part of the
300-student work force that traveled to Tijuana this
spring vacation to teach and to build new "classrooms."
Student groups came from schools all over California,
each contingent with its specific project.
The volunteers at Project Amigos paid their own
way. They slept, free of charge, in a church across the
border in Chula Vista, and their construction tools were
furnished by the Palo Alto Kiwanis Club; but all other
expenses including the cost of the building materials
were met by the volunteers themselves.
Apparently, pride does not necessarily breed rancor
and hostility, for the Stanford students were welcomed
into the community, into the houses, and, indeed, into
the families. The enthusiasm was seemingly conta
gious: the Stanford group went down to Tijuana to
build one, all-purpose, single room branch "school
house"; it left Tijuana having constructed two school
houses, renovated several project buildings, and re
painted the interior of a local orphanage.

The basic area of endeavor is literacy, but beyond
lhat. the field of valid instruction becomes virtually un
limited. Ultimately the subject is less important than
the psychological climate created. "They arc so eager
to learn," explained Miss Paulson. "And what's vital
is that we're giving them this feeling of productivity
that they haven't had for so long."
Vocational skills are especially stressed in the Proj
ect Amigos program. The aim is to "start things on a
level where the Mexicans can continue it themselves."
The internal proliferation of knowledge through the
community is essential if outside efforts are going to
generate any lasting response.
The Stanford volunteers apparently have faith that,
in Tijuana, progress vvil indeed be self-perpetuating. In
this context, little victories seem great battles won.
Miss Paulson spoke with obvious pride of a Tijuana
boy. who had learned his English at the Laubach center,
and who now has a "scholarship'' to a high school in
Ihe United States. "They all think he's just wonder
ful."
Vet the very "hopefulness" of this example reveals
a sad and essential truth about life in Tijuana. Chil
dren grow up very fast there. They have to. But when
they grow up, the best ol them do not linger long. Op
portunity lies somewhere else.
In a very real sense. Tijuana is a human deadend.
Life seems to partake of the aridity of the land itself,
and the land cannot be changed overnight, if ever. Work
on Project Amigos continues, and will continue as long
as motley and volunteer help are forthcoming, but the
melancholy truth exists as Miss Paulson admitted in an
unguarded moment, that in Tijuana, "there is more ac
fivitv in the L'ravevard than aiivvvliure else."
