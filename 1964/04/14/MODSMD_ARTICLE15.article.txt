# Art By Diebenkorn, Chagall Shown

### WARREN G. WOOD, JR 
Drawings by Richard Dieben
korn, Stanford's artist-in-resi
dence, and etchings by Marc Cha
gall interpreting the Old Testa
ment reveal greatly differing ap
proaches to figurative art.
Lone figures seated or reclin
ing and immersed in private
reverie are the subject of nearly
all ihe Diebenkorn drawings on
display through April 26 at the
Stanford Art Gallery.
Clothed in baggy, sack-like gar
ments, the Biblical figures in

Marc Chagall's hand colored etch
ings, currently displayed upstairs
at Tresidder, manifest the s a m e
sorrow which seems to bathe Ihe
people in Diebenkorn's work, but
with one vital difference: the sor
row of Diebenkorn's subjects is
a silent, private one; that of Cha
gall's is relieved by dialogue â€”
the dialogue between man (speci
fically the Hebrew people) and
God (the Biblical Yahweh).
Sorrow in Chagall is mitigated
not only by dialogue but by the
fantasy and almost child-like
charm which characterizes hi s
work. The world of Diebenkorn's
figures is assuaged neither by
fantasy nor dialogue. Stretched
out forms sprawled in a chair or
resting on a bed converse neither
with God nor with others; theirs
is a monologue of the self with
the self. Even the few drawings
which depict two people, bodies
intertwined, have a contained
quality in which loneliness is not
vanquished but shared.
Loneliness permeates even
those drawings in which no fig
ures are depicted. An empty chair
faces a table strewn with ciga
rettes, letters and a pair of
frooming scissors. A monotonous
gray sky hangs low over clusters
of buildings and palm trees.
Occasionally a figure is seen
standing, nude except for a frock
draped over the shoulders, as if
looking in a mirror yet gazing at
the viewer. If Diebenkorn's draw
ings are moving, it is because
t hey hold up a mirror in which an
innermost part of our being is
reflected with utter honesty.
Some of the figures are done
in pen or pencil, others in ink
wash. The forms are delineated
with an economy of effort and a
sureness of line, infusing them
with spontaneity in spite of their
repose.
Diebenkorn and Chagall are
both best known for their o i 1
paintings; Diebenkorn for his
impasto figures and colors taken
from the local landscape; C h a

gall for his dreamlike pictures in
which mystic and religious ele
ments mingle with human experi
ence and memories of childhood.
Chagall, born in 1887 the son of
a poor Russian-Jewish herring
merchant in Vitebsk, created his
etchings interpreting the Bible
between 1931-39 and 1952-56. The
series of 100 prints, all of them
hand colored by the artist, depict
scenes ranging from the creation
of man to the stories of the pa
triarchs and prophets. As the
series progresses, the figures, at
first small and tranquil, become
larger and more agitated as the
prophets warn of the fate of
Israel.
Despite the increasing agitation
nearly all the pictures have an
element of humor. Even in the
scene of Jacob being attacked by
his brothers the violence is coun
tered by the almost ludicrously
happy smile of a goat in the cor
ner of the picture. The animals
in "Ezekial's Vision" look like
nothing so much as the figures
in "A Midsummer Night's
Dream."
What are wo to make of the
work of these two artists whose
work is figurative and yet so dif
ferent? No doubt we shall encom
pass the insight of both, for the
world is both a "Midsummer
Night's Dream" and a place of
lonely soliloquy. Nonetheless, one
seems to speak more deeply to
us.
If Chagall's illustrations of the
Bible engage us with the thought
of stories heard and half-remem
bered in Sunday School (What
was it Ezekial was so agitated
about?) and charm us with
lumpy angels and smiling goats,
they do not move us for long.
They have lost their mythic qual
ity and have become stories, de
lightful but no longer vital.
If angels and patriarchs pass
quickly from our thoughts, our
images of our aloneness do not.
It is this image to which Dieben
korn has given form.
