Stanford's rising young tennis
team scored a narrow 5-4 victory
over traditional rival Cal Satur
day morning on > the Stanford
courts. A highly enthusiastic au
dience witnessed this marathon
struggle the outcome of which
hung in the balance until the final
match.'
In the number one singles
match Stanford's Jim Beste de
feated Doug Sykes 3-6, 6-1, 6-3.
Although this match was marred
by much play of substandard cali
bre, there were flashes of bril
liance from both players that
created an atmosphere of tense
excitement.
WHEN HE HAD the inclina
tion, Beste alternated crushing
power with velvet touch that com
pletely dominated play. In mo
ments of crisis he invariably pro
duced stunning winners or re
markable retrieves that reduced
the hapless Sykes to a bewildered
spectator.

In the second singles match
Barry Baskin defeated Stanford's
Jerry Hurst 6-3, 6-4. Hurfet evi
denced a tendency that seems
characteristic of the Stanford
team in general a lack of that
tenacity that comes from serious
hard-nosed competition.
In the third singles match Ron
Preissman of Stanford fell before
a Dick Abramson 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
Preissman's defeat was largely
due to his inability to take full
advantage of his spinning left
handed serves.
PERHAPS THE most impres
sive performance on the Stanford
side was rendered by John Isaacs
in defeating Gene Cantin 6-2, 6-1.
Isaacs went about demolishing
Cantin with methodical effective
ness using a power serve and a
much subdued temper with good
result.
After a close first set Cal's Jan
Kucera, relying primarily on ag
gressive net play and sound court
tactics, overcame John Burt 7-5,
6-1. In the final singles match
Brad Hodgman of Stanford de
feated Don Adolphson.
With the singles matches tied
at three all, the margin of vic
tory was supplied in the doubles.
Stanford won the first two
doubles matches to take the dual
meet. In anticipation of next
week's encounters with USC and
UCLA, Stanford's tennis team ex
hibited a few weak spots but also
showed marked improvement. In
fact Ralston, Ashe, et al., are be
ginning to sweat.

tenacity that comes from serious
hard-nosed competition.
In the third singles match Ron
Preissman of Stanford fell before
a Dick Abramson 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
Preissman's defeat was largely
due to his inability to take full
advantage of his spinning left
handed serves.
PERHAPS THE most impres
sive performance on the Stanford
side was rendered by John Isaacs
in defeating Gene Cantin 6-2, 6-1.
Isaacs went about demolishing
Cantin with methodical effective
ness using a power serve and a
much subdued temper with good
result.
After a close first set Cal's Jan
Kucera, relying primarily on ag
gressive net play and sound court
tactics, overcame John Burt 7-5,
6-1. In the final singles match
Brad Hodgman of Stanford de
feated Don Adolphson.
With the singles matches tied
at three all, the margin of vic
tory was supplied in the doubles.
Stanford won the first two
doubles matches to take the dual
meet. In anticipation of next
week's encounters with USC and
UCLA, Stanford's tennis team ex
hibited a few weak spots but also
showed marked improvement. In
fact Ralston, Ashe, et al., are be
ginning to sweat.
Stanford's rising young tennis
team scored a narrow 5-4 victory
over traditional rival Cal Satur

courts. A highly enthusiastic au
dience witnessed this marathon
struggle the outcome of which
hung in the balance until the final
match.'
In the number one singles
match Stanford's Jim Beste de
feated Doug Sykes 3-6, 6-1, 6-3.
Although this match was marred
by much play of substandard cali
bre, there were flashes of bril
liance from both players that
created an atmosphere of tense
excitement.
WHEN HE HAD the inclina
tion, Beste alternated crushing
power with velvet touch that com
pletely dominated play. In mo
ments of crisis he invariably pro
duced stunning winners or re
markable retrieves that reduced
the hapless Sykes to a bewildered
spectator.

In the second singles match
Barry Baskin defeated Stanford's
Jerry Hurst 6-3, 6-4. Hurfet evi
denced a tendency that seems
characteristic of the Stanford
team in general a lack of that
tenacity that comes from serious
hard-nosed competition.
