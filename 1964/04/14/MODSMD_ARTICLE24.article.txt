## 
### 
Stanford crews were victorious
in all races but the four-man boat
contest in Saturday's regatta with
USC and Oregon State. The var
sity competition saw Stanford
get off to a bad start, but the
boat passed OSU and then USC
at 1000 meters, and won in a
time of 5:29, with USC 3%
lengths back at 6:43, and USU
514 lengths behind at 6:50.
The JV's also had a poor start,
as they were floating free while
the other boats were held at start
ing floats. But they won by two
lengths in a time of 6:40. The
frosh boat had the best start of
all, led by one length a f ter 1000
meters, and won by two in 6:31.
This Saturday the crew meets
Oregon State at Corvallis, and
the following Saturday takes on
Cal.
