### JOHN CALMORE 
In a game highlighted by bril
liant pitching, USC's 1963 Na
tional Champion baseball team
held out for a 3-2 victory over
Dutch Fehring's crew. The coach
felt that "we were only about a
hit away from victory."
The Cards were quick to get on
the scoreboard. Jerry■ Smith 1 e d
off the bottom of the first with
a double and advanced to third
on a throwing error by Thoy's
third-sacker Darryl' Wilkins.
Smith came home when catcher
Jim Hibbs hit into a double play.,
FINE PITCHING from Dick
Kovacevich blanked the Trojans
until the fifth inning. The big
right-hander retired twelve out
of the first 13 SC batters, setting
down eight in a row before giving
up a walk.
Marty Piscovich, Trojan catch
er, ended Southern Cal's search
for a hit when he opened the
fifth with a deep triple off the
left field wall. Wilkins singled
Pisco vich in to knot the score at
1-1.
The Trojans took the lead in
the eighth inning. Second base
man Larr.y .Sandell led off with
a single. After an SC batter
popped up, shortstop Gary Suth
erland boomed a 450-foot blast to
deep center field. The blast was
good enough for an inside-the
park home run. With Sandell
scoring too, this hit provided the
margin of victory.
AFTER THE first frame, Tro
jan hurler Larry Fisher really
settled down as he retired 19
straight Indian batters. But in

the ninth inning Stanford tried
desperately" to pull it out of the
fire. Outfielder Bob Cox singled,
Hibbs walked, and Pete Middle
kauff got a bunt single to load
the bases with nobody out.
Fisher was relieved by Walt
Peterson who had shut out
league-leading Santa Clara last
Saturday. With help from Suth
erland, Peterson successfully put
out the fire. Bob Hollman struck
out. George Thacher hit the ball
hard, seemingly a single, but
Sutherland came up with the play
of the day, making a diving back
hand stop and getting a force out
at second. Cox,, however, scored
to make it 3-2, Southern Cal.
Pinchhitter Ron Yelt recorded
the final out as he lined out to
Sutherland.

Peterson who had shut out
league-leading Santa Clara last
Saturday. With help from Suth
erland, Peterson successfully put
out the fire. Bob Hollman struck
out. George Thacher hit the ball
hard, seemingly a single, but
Sutherland came up with the play
of the day, making a diving back
hand stop and getting a force out
at second. Cox,, however, scored
to make it 3-2, Southern Cal.
Pinchhitter Ron Yelt recorded
the final out as he lined out to
Sutherland.


ACTION IN YESTERDAY'S game with Southern Cat. The Tribe fell
short by one run in trying to whip last year's National Champions.
In a game highlighted by bril
liant pitching, USC's 1963 Na
tional Champion baseball team
held out for a 3-2 victory over
Dutch Fehring's crew. The coach
felt that "we were only about a
hit away from victory."
The Cards were quick to get on
the scoreboard. Jerry■ Smith 1 e d
off the bottom of the first with
a double and advanced to third
on a throwing error by Thoy's
third-sacker Darryl' Wilkins.
Smith came home when catcher
Jim Hibbs hit into a double play.,
FINE PITCHING from Dick
Kovacevich blanked the Trojans
until the fifth inning. The big
right-hander retired twelve out
of the first 13 SC batters, setting
down eight in a row before giving
up a walk.
Marty Piscovich, Trojan catch
er, ended Southern Cal's search
for a hit when he opened the
fifth with a deep triple off the
left field wall. Wilkins singled
Pisco vich in to knot the score at
1-1.
The Trojans took the lead in
the eighth inning. Second base
man Larr.y .Sandell led off with
a single. After an SC batter
popped up, shortstop Gary Suth
erland boomed a 450-foot blast to
deep center field. The blast was
good enough for an inside-the
park home run. With Sandell
scoring too, this hit provided the
margin of victory.
AFTER THE first frame, Tro
jan hurler Larry Fisher really
settled down as he retired 19
straight Indian batters. But in

the ninth inning Stanford tried
desperately" to pull it out of the
fire. Outfielder Bob Cox singled,
Hibbs walked, and Pete Middle
kauff got a bunt single to load
the bases with nobody out.
