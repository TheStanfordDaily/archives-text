# Frosh Track Win
## 
### GEORGE KAMPE 
Led by Bruce Wilhelm's record
breaking throw in the shot-put,
the Stanford Freshmen, taking
firsts in all but five events, scored
an easy 100-31 victory over Reed
ley Junior College in last Fri
day's home meet. Noncompeting
Los Angeles State College scored
41 points.
Wilhelm, who once more broke
his own Frosh record with a
heave of 55'6", stands out as Stan
ford's number one shot-putter as
a freshman.
Stanford appeared weak only
in the 100 and 220-yard dashes.
The 100 was a star-spangled
mixed-up affair with Stanford's
erstwhile track star, Larry Que
stad, running unattached, finish
ing second to another unattached
runner from Arizona, both
clocked unofficially at 9.6.
RANDY HYRONEN and Bud
Walsh were Stanford's only
double winners. Hyronen easily
won the mile and 880 with times
of 4:23 flat and 1:59.6. Walsh
won the high jump at 5'10" and
the 330 intermediate hurdles in
38.9.
Stanford had one-two-three fin
ishes in the 880 and high jump,
the 880 sweep facilitated by an
all-Stanford field. Other Stanford
winners were Don Eshelman in
the pole vault, Ed Cadman in the
two-mile, Rich Wyatt in the triple
jump, and John O'Brien in 440.
