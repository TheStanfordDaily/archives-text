# BOTH MARXIANS
## Sweezy To Replace Baran? 
### 
With the death of Paul Baran,
Stanford has lost both a brilliant
scholar and teacher and a widely
respected advocate of Marxian
economics, an economic philoso
phy which few American stu
dents have the opportunity to
study without some type of a
negative interpretation.
Baran, the man and the profes
sor, was a vital asset to the uni
versity community, and Baran's
presence on the university faculty
symbolized both the reality of a
tradition of academic freedom, a
tradition which is unfortunately

often ignored in
practice in de
ference to the
principle of
pragmatic con
venience, and
th e opportun
tunity for a stu
dent body com-

posed mainly of middle-class
American youth to receive a sym
pathetic view of Marxian eco
nomics from one of its leading
supporters.

It would indeed be most valu
able, in view of these factors, for
both the university and its stu
dents if Stanford would extend
an invitation to Paul Sweezy, a
close associate of Baran, and, like
Baran, a leading Marxian econo
mist, to fill the vacant chair left
by Baran's death.

SWEEZY IS NOW serving as
editor of Monthly Review, which
has been called by the Depart
ment of Economics at Wellesley
College "the leading Marxist in
tellectual (non-Communist) eco
nomics journal published any
where in the world." Sweezy
taught at both Harvard and Cor
nell and was a visiting professor
at Stanford.
Pie published The Theory of
Capitalist Development in 1942,
a collection of essays of F. O.
Matthiesen in 1947, and The Pres
ent as History in 1953. Sweezy is
now working on a book, Amer
ican Capitalism, which he and Ba
ran were writing together.
The question of academic free
dom in hiring a professor is al
ways a delicate one. While regret
ting the necessity for any such
acknowledgment, the writer
recognizes the boldness required
of the university administration
to actively court a man of con
troversy who represents a minor
ity philosophy.
The problem is fundamentally
that of a university, which so
often, instead of setting an ex
ample for the alumni and com
munity at large, adjusts itself to
the mood, desires, and, often,
prejudices of alumni and com
munity. Inherent in this is the
fact that the role of an adminis
trator who seeks to retain his
position is one which seems to
call for caution (except perhaps
in fund raising), rather than bold
ness.

OTHER PROBLEMS, of course,
present themselves in choosing a
successor to Baran. To seek a
man simply because of similari
ties to the man whose seat he
must take is insufficient rationale
in itself. However, this is not the
case with Sweezy, whose similari
ties to Baran only enhance his
own high status as scholar and
Marxian economist.

When the quest for a successor
to Baran begins next fall, the
main need of the economics de
partment must be considered and
then the best man for this role
found. It is this writer's belief
that a vital aspect of a univer
sity department is the ability to
present an important philosophy
of the subject matter with some
sympathetic understanding and
depth of knowledge, and that
Paul Sweezy is the best man for
such a role.
An invitation to Sweezy could
perhaps begin to erase the mem
ory of the university administra
tion's lame defense of Baran's
position on the faculty on the
basis of the fact that he held
tenure.
More important to administra
tive concerns, an attempt to en
rich Stanford's faculty by offer
ing an appointment to Sweezy
would be far more than a fitting
tribute to the memory of Paul
Baran; it would mean an impor
tant step for Stanford toward
that so-greatly coveted "edge of
greatness" in the areas of both
scholarship and academic free
dom.
