# Stanford Collection's Curator Wants All Historic Papers
## 
### WILEY RAMEY 
"Lot us bo your wastebasket,"
pleaded Mr. Ralph Hanson, the
curator of the Stanford Collec
tion. He directed his appeal to
students, faculty members, and
other members of the Stanford
Community who might have in
their possession or know of the
whereabouts of any papers, pic
tures, files, etc. which might be
even remotely related to the Uni
versity. The shocked Mr. Hanson
pointed out that he knew of an
instance when old department
files were dumped into the trash
rather than deposited with the
Collection.
Besides asking members of the
Stanford Community to think
twice before dumping their old
trash. Mr. Hanson also is crusad
ing to make unsuspecting Stan
ford students aware that there
is a third floor in the library. Ac
tually, the Stanford Collection
has existed since 1907 in the in
ner reaches of the library.
IF YOU ever want to go there,

| you can. you know. Take the
j creaky old elevator up the shaft
j to the third floor. Never mind
the strange, twisted little char
acters with pale skin and hunched
backs that you may see on the
way up. They're perfectly harm
less, I'm told, as long as you
don't let them ride in the elevator
with you.
Once on the proper level, take
out your flashlight and begin
making your way down the dark,
foul corridor, making sure to
wipe away the cobwebs and spid
ers dangling all around your face.
If you have the path-finding abil
ity of a Theseus, soon you will
arrive at that section of the laby
rinth containing the archives of
the Stanford Collection, prosai
cally referred to as Room 310.
Once safely inside, you will j
heave a deep sigh of relief a n d
; the musty smell of old rotting
papers will happily replace the
foul ordor of the passageways.
To your right, observe a real,
live archivist, sitting under hi s
I framed "Code of the Archivist."
j That will be Mr. Hanson, an d,
happy to see another person, he
j will give you individual attention.
TOGETHER, you will content

I as: the minutes of the Student
I Affairs Committee of 189(5, ree-
I ords of early day administrative
i meetings, notes from Mrs. Stan
' fold to Dr. Jordan, and old files
: from the business office. Much
j good Stanford history is there
I for the adventurous student.

If you have the path-finding abil

Once safely inside, you will j

papers will happily replace the

"Lot us bo your wastebasket,"
pleaded Mr. Ralph Hanson, the
curator of the Stanford Collec
tion. He directed his appeal to
students, faculty members, and
other members of the Stanford
Community who might have in
their possession or know of the
whereabouts of any papers, pic
tures, files, etc. which might be
even remotely related to the Uni
versity. The shocked Mr. Hanson
pointed out that he knew of an
instance when old department
files were dumped into the trash
rather than deposited with the
Collection.
Besides asking members of the
Stanford Community to think
twice before dumping their old
trash. Mr. Hanson also is crusad
ing to make unsuspecting Stan
ford students aware that there
is a third floor in the library. Ac
tually, the Stanford Collection
has existed since 1907 in the in
ner reaches of the library.
IF YOU ever want to go there,

| you can. you know. Take the
j creaky old elevator up the shaft
j to the third floor. Never mind
the strange, twisted little char
acters with pale skin and hunched
backs that you may see on the
way up. They're perfectly harm
less, I'm told, as long as you
don't let them ride in the elevator
with you.
Once on the proper level, take
out your flashlight and begin
making your way down the dark,
foul corridor, making sure to
wipe away the cobwebs and spid
ers dangling all around your face.
