## 'Privileged Attendance' Clause Allows Arbitrary Expulsions 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
We are disturbed by the impli
cations of your "Syndrome" edi
torial to the effect that a gradu
ate student has been unjustly
expelled. Such a possibility does
not surprise us, however. For
some time now we have thought
that' the Administration demon
strates insufficient regard for
the rights of students and an un
healthy belief in its ability to
decide what morals and conduct
are "proper" for them.
Largely our unrest stems from
the November report of the Com
mittee on University Policy:
"President Sterling reported to
the Committee that, on the ad
vice of counsel, the Board of
Trustees had determined that it
is necessary to issue the attached
statement in order to make clear
the University's basic policy con
cerning the conduct of student
organizations and of students in
genera 1." Particular attention
was called to the last paragraph
of the statement [which now ap
pears on page 56 of the Bulletin]
as follows:
Attendance at the University
is a privilege, not a right. The
University may withhold regis
tration from or require the
withdrawal of any student
whose academic performance
is deemed unsatisfactory, who
fails to abide by University
regulations, or whose social
conduct, personal habits or
moral character are deemed
detrimental by the University.
Registration as a student con
stitutes full acceptance of the
Fundamental Standard and the
Honor Code as well as other
University rules and standards
of conduct." [Emphasis added.]
Professor Warren A. Seavey,
writing in the Harvard Law Re
view, has referred to a similar
clause as a "strange document
for a respectable college to pre
pare and for a court to uphold."
Nevertheless, a number of court
decisions have upheld these
clauses on the ground that rela
tions between a private univer
sity and its students are a matter
of contract. If these decisions are
to be followed in California, the
above clause, which is now part
of every Stanford-Student "con
tract," gives the Administration
the legal right to expel any stu
dent at any time for any reason
without giving him notice and
without granting him a hearing.
In our opinion the California
courts, which have never decided
a case involving such a clause,
will not allow Stanford to expel
a student for the sole reason that
the Administration happens to
deem detrimental his "social con
duct, personal habits or moral
character." Instead, we think the
University will be required to
show that the expelled student's
conduct interfered in some ma
terial way with the University's
educational and/or research func
tions.
What particularly upsets us is
that the University, after seek
ing the advice of counsel, has en
deavored to give itself legal pow
er to expel, under a wholly sub
jective standard, for conduct that
may amount to no more than a
breach of "Establishment"
values.
Even if the University's law
yers are right, we do not under
stand how Stanford has been
benefited. Surely the University
has no legitimate interest in suc
cessfully defending an arbitrary
expulsion. However, the losses,
or possible losses, flowing from
this clause are great. An Admin
istrator when given complete and

unreviewable power is encour
aged to act arbitrarily. Students
may be cowed into expressing
and conducting themselves in an
"acceptable" manner. And pros
pective students and faculty may
justifiably wonder whether they
can find here the climate of aca
demic freedom they desire.

How empty does university life
have to become before we realize
that its value depends on a moral
impact? Last Friday's editorial
on Stanford's "Home Syndrome"
clearly implied that the Univer
sity should refrain from total edu
cation on the grounds that "moral
values are a private matter." May
I suggest that Stanford will cease
to be a university the moment it
no longer demands academic and
social responsibility from its
students?
Wisdom is not having to repeat
every mistake of the last one
hundred generations. Straight
forward, empirical observation
convinces most students of the
need for both constraints outside
the individual and internalized
restraints within him. Unfortun
ately, personal restraint is a hard
position to maintain in our so
ciety because (1) we've been left
to decide the issue pretty much
for ourselves, (2) we encounter
so many people who demand
moral behavior yet do not prac
tice it themselves.
Discussion of the personal and
public aspects of morality should
(1) clearly distinguish between
that which is "personal" (the atti
tudes and behavior patterns
which affect only ourselves) and
that which is "public" (the atti
tudes and behavior patterns
which affect other people), (2)
include all the factors controlling
moral dynamics. We know that
every living society has experi
enced discrepancies between be
lief and behavior, yet we also
know they have somehow main
tained the individual and collec
tive vitality.
The incessant movement of
public and private standards
across the "line" of social order
continues to fascinate the
thoughtful observer. Even though
he may not like its contemporary
direction, he knows that its clock
pendulum regularity will eventu
ally return it towards equilib
rium.

the University's basic policy con
cerning the conduct of student
organizations and of students in
genera 1." Particular attention
was called to the last paragraph
of the statement [which now ap

as follows:
Attendance at the University
is a privilege, not a right. The
University may withhold regis
tration from or require the
withdrawal of any student
whose academic performance
is deemed unsatisfactory, who
fails to abide by University
regulations, or whose social
conduct, personal habits or
moral character are deemed
detrimental by the University.
Registration as a student con
stitutes full acceptance of the
Fundamental Standard and the
Honor Code as well as other
University rules and standards
of conduct." [Emphasis added.]
Professor Warren A. Seavey,
writing in the Harvard Law Re
view, has referred to a similar
clause as a "strange document
for a respectable college to pre
pare and for a court to uphold."
Nevertheless, a number of court
decisions have upheld these
clauses on the ground that rela
tions between a private univer
sity and its students are a matter
of contract. If these decisions are
to be followed in California, the
above clause, which is now part
of every Stanford-Student "con
tract," gives the Administration
the legal right to expel any stu
dent at any time for any reason
without giving him notice and
without granting him a hearing.
In our opinion the California
courts, which have never decided
a case involving such a clause,
will not allow Stanford to expel
a student for the sole reason that
the Administration happens to
deem detrimental his "social con
duct, personal habits or moral
character." Instead, we think the
University will be required to
show that the expelled student's
conduct interfered in some ma
terial way with the University's
educational and/or research func
tions.
What particularly upsets us is
that the University, after seek
ing the advice of counsel, has en
deavored to give itself legal pow
er to expel, under a wholly sub
jective standard, for conduct that
may amount to no more than a
breach of "Establishment"
values.
Even if the University's law
yers are right, we do not under
stand how Stanford has been
benefited. Surely the University
has no legitimate interest in suc
cessfully defending an arbitrary
expulsion. However, the losses,
or possible losses, flowing from
this clause are great. An Admin
istrator when given complete and

unreviewable power is encour
aged to act arbitrarily. Students

"acceptable" manner. And pros

How empty does university life

Wisdom is not having to repeat

convinces most students of the

the individual and internalized

position to maintain in our so

to decide the issue pretty much
for ourselves, (2) we encounter
so many people who demand
moral behavior yet do not prac

Discussion of the personal and

(1) clearly distinguish between
that which is "personal" (the atti

Professor Warren A. Seavey,
writing in the Harvard Law Re

Nevertheless, a number of court

the legal right to expel any stu
dent at any time for any reason

without granting him a hearing.
In our opinion the California
courts, which have never decided
a case involving such a clause,
will not allow Stanford to expel
a student for the sole reason that
the Administration happens to
deem detrimental his "social con
duct, personal habits or moral
character." Instead, we think the
University will be required to
show that the expelled student's
conduct interfered in some ma
terial way with the University's
educational and/or research func

What particularly upsets us is
that the University, after seek
ing the advice of counsel, has en
deavored to give itself legal pow
er to expel, under a wholly sub
jective standard, for conduct that
may amount to no more than a
breach of "Establishment"
values.
Even if the University's law
yers are right, we do not under
stand how Stanford has been
benefited. Surely the University
has no legitimate interest in suc
cessfully defending an arbitrary
expulsion. However, the losses,
or possible losses, flowing from
this clause are great. An Admin

How empty does university life

on Stanford's "Home Syndrome"
clearly implied that the Univer

values are a private matter." May
I suggest that Stanford will cease
to be a university the moment it
no longer demands academic and
social responsibility from its
students?
Wisdom is not having to repeat
every mistake of the last one
hundred generations. Straight
forward, empirical observation
convinces most students of the
need for both constraints outside
the individual and internalized
restraints within him. Unfortun
ately, personal restraint is a hard
position to maintain in our so
ciety because (1) we've been left
to decide the issue pretty much
for ourselves, (2) we encounter
so many people who demand
moral behavior yet do not prac
tice it themselves.
Discussion of the personal and
public aspects of morality should
(1) clearly distinguish between
that which is "personal" (the atti
tudes and behavior patterns
which affect only ourselves) and
that which is "public" (the atti
tudes and behavior patterns
which affect other people), (2)
include all the factors controlling
moral dynamics. We know that
every living society has experi

We are disturbed by the impli

not surprise us, however. For

that' the Administration demon
strates insufficient regard for

is necessary to issue the attached

was called to the last paragraph
of the statement [which now ap

as follows:
Attendance at the University
is a privilege, not a right. The
University may withhold regis
tration from or require the
withdrawal of any student
whose academic performance
is deemed unsatisfactory, who
fails to abide by University
regulations, or whose social
conduct, personal habits or
moral character are deemed
