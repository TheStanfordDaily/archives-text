## Legislature Not Steady, Only Slow 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
ASSU President Bud Wedin
keeps making the same mistake.
Periodically he goes into LASSU
meetings expecting fast action on
business. But the Legislature is
more a plough horse than a
throughbred, and when called
upon to race against time, it usu
ally finishes a distant second.
The latest case of LASSU fid
dling while Wedin burns is th e
potent combination of the rush
committee proposal and the latest
rush proposal. The former would

establish a five
man committee
of the IFC, IHC,
and ICC presi
dents, the head
Wilbur sponsor,
and a LASSU
member, which

Beck would discuss
rush proposals such as and in
cluding the latter. The committee,
it is hoped, would give the Legis
lature effective control over rush,
which Wedin feels is of concern
to most of the student body.
But, in an age of mass com
munication, someone neglected
to tell the Legislature about the
proposed By-laws change creating
the committee. The proposal had
a brief first reading on March 5,
and then procedled directly to
the By-laws committee, where it
was resting peacefully until last
Thursday.
AT THAT TIME Wedin tried
unsuccessfully to get it out of the
By-laws committee, failing main
ly because nobody on the Legis
lature knew what he was talking
about. LASSU's ignorance was
totally unnecessary because cop
ies of the proposal had been sit
ting in the ASSU Office for two
weeks prior to Thursday night's
meeting.
One representative from the
eating clubs did a marvelous job
of typifying the confusion of
Thursday night's meeting. When
Wedin brought up the committee
proposal, this representative im
mediately gained the floor and
began critizing the rush proposal.
When it was explained to him
that the two were entirely sepa
rate issues, he paused for a mo
ment and then began critizing the
committee idea, although his
criticism seemed mainly based on
suspicions that bad things for
the eating clubs come in pairs.
Even accepting the fact that
the new rush proposal leaves
something to be desired, the place
where it should be discussed is
in LASSU, where, in theory, the
entire student body is repre
sented, and where, in theory is
maintained, final student control
of student affairs.
If LASSU is going to create a
committee to handle problems of
rush policy, it seems only rea
sonable that the presidents of the
various living groups be on that
committee. But the Legislature
needed time to think this all out,
because, for the most part, the
proposed committee was some
thing new for them.
LEGISLATURE ignorance is
fairly commonplace on most mat
ters, because most proposals are
prepared outside the Legislature
and then presented, or sprung, on
LASSU. This means at least a two
week delay, if not longer, for the
Legislature, being a highly con
sciencious body, is quite reluctant
to approve of anything without
first thinking about it and per
haps getting an opinion from
its constituents.

Attempts have been made to
solve this problem, but up to now,
these attempts have resulted in
more words than actions. A By
law passed last quarter was sup
posed to correct matters, but it
has not been implemented, and
perhaps even if it were, it would
not be enough.
Wedin gave some very fine
arguments for the committee,
and probably the Legislature
agreed with him in principal that
it should have "final procedural
authority for enactment of an y
rush policies."
But considerable room for dis
agreement lies within the con
fines of principle, especially on
an issue as important and as
rush policy. LASSU was wisely
reluctant, for its own sake*. in
putting off any decision for a
couple of weeks.
Wedin said after the meeting
that the Legislature's indecision
created the possibility of an un
fortunate delay in deciding on a
rush policy. But until some im
provement is made in the means
of informing the Legislature of
its own agenda, Wedin and his
successors will be faced with
more delays, just as unfortunate.
