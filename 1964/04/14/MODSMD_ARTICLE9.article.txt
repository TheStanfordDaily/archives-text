# Studentâ€™s Retrial Opened To Public
## 
### 
In an unprecedented action,
the ASSU Judicial Council lias
moved to make public the re
trial of Frank Patrick Morse.
The original charge against
Morse arose out of an incident

Morse was found guilty of
damaging the building by the
Judicial Council of the Italy
campus. In its April 2 meeting,
the ASSU Judicial Council
moved to vacate the decision of
the Italy council.
The retrial of the case will
take place in the large lounge
of Tresidder Memorial Union
at 7:30 p.m. today.
