# Geomagnetic Observatory Will Be Dedicated To Varian
## 
### 
A completely automatic geomagnetic observatory, the first ol
its kind in the world, will be constructed near Palo Alto by \ arian
i Associates 011 land donated by the Varian Foundation.
The observatory is being erected by the two organizations as
a memorial to Dr. Hussell H. Varian, a pioneer in work in magnetic

instrumentation. Dr. Varian was
a member of the Stanford Phys
ics Department until liis death in
1959.
THIO COAST and Geodetic- Sur
vey of Ihe Dept. of Commerce
will operate Ih e observatory,
which will contain the latest auto
matic geomagnetic equipment
for recording changes in the
earth's magnetic field. The three
building complex will be co m
pleted sometime this summer.
The data from the observatory
will be available to all educational
institutions in the area. The in
formation collected by the in
struments will be especially use
ful at Stanford, according to Dr.
Joshua Soske, Salvatori profes
sor of Geophysics at Stanford.
"IT WILL 1510 a tremendous
help to the Stanford Geophysics
department"" he said. "It will
give us for the first time accu
rate measurements of the Earth's
magnetic field in this area to
[check our own instruments
against." He reported that th e
nearest laboratory at this time
is in Tucson, Arizona. Geomag
netic instruments at Stanford are
housed in the Henry Salvatori
i Laboiatory of Geophysics.
