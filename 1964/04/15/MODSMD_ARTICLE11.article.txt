# Morse Hearing Focuses On jurisdictional Issue
## Defendants Found Guilty Of Charges; Review Of Proceedings Requested 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN Feature Editor 
Judicial Council, in an unprecedented public hearing last night,
retried a ease, originating at the Stanford in Italy campus, and, in
doing so, raised the basic issue of who lias judicial jurisdiction.
The student judicial council considers itself constitutionally respon
sible for review of decisions made by judicial councils overseas:

the Dean's Office, according to*
Judicial Council, states that it |
has original jurisdiction in cases j
from overseas campuses.
THE CASE which the Council i
tried was the case of Frankj
Morse and Ron Langstaff,
charged with violation of the
fundamental standard for caus
ing damage to Stanford in Italy
premises by the breaking of two
door panels. Both men were found
guilty by the overseas judicial
council and required to serve five
.corporation yard hours. Judicial
Council last night found both
men guilty and did not accept
their explanations as mitigating
ithe circumstances of their ac
tions. Langstaff and Morse were
' both told to serve ten convales
cent home hours and directed to
pay damages upon demand.
The recommendation made by
the judicial council in Italy was
I overruled in the case of Morse,
by the Dean's Office, and, upon
his return to campus, Morse was
| notified that lie had been sus-
J pended.
THE JUDICIAL Council bases
jits right to review the case of
Morse on the procedural guaran-
I tee provided in the constitution'
of the Associated Students of'
Stanford University. Quoting)
| from a memorandum to Directors i
j of Overseas Campuses from Rob-1
| crt Walker, head of the overseas!
I campus program, Darrell Halver
! son, chairman of Judicial'Council.
[ noted that appeals from a deci
sion, "beyond the Director in
; charge of student affairs, will
j only be through regular student
appeal procedures on the home
â€¢campus." The position of the

Dean's Office is that il is the
regular channel for student ap
peals. Judicial Couneil contends
that, since the constitution for
overseas campuses is part of the
ASSU constitution, the overseas
judicial council is a subordinate
body of the home campus judicial
council, and, thus, it is Ihe regu
lar channel for student appeals.

lIALVEKSON emphasized the
fact that Judicial Council was not
questioning the fact that the
deans acted in good faith. "Wo
are only presenting our side," he
said. "We feel there may be con
tradictions in university state
ments and policies and inequities
in the system."
Morse stated that lie was never
given a written reason for his
suspension, but that it was im
plied he was being suspended for
psychological reasons, as well as
for the actual offense. A letter
from Health Service Psychiatrist
Dr. James Paulsen, whom Morse
saw soon after seeing Dean
Winbigler, was introduced as
evidence. Paulsen's letter stated
that Morse has no psychological
illness or significant emotional
problems.
Morse said he was also told a
"positive attitude" toward his
suspension would aid him in re
obtaining his scholarship upon re
turn to Stanford.
