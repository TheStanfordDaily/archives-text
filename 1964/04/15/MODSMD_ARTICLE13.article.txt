tempting to rec
ognize the au-

thority of the Roman Church and
still retain its evangelical theol
ogy, liturgy and distinct priest
hood.
As a rebel in Nazi Germany,
Lackmann spent three and one
half years in Dachau concentra

preaching. He was deposed from
the Evangelical Church in Ger

From the Church." Although he
was forced out of his parish, he
still considers himself "invested
with ecclesiastical office."
