# Foreign Students Reflect Nations

An analysis of Stanford's 1,000
foreign students and scholars re
veals general national develop
ment patterns, reports Dr. Wer
ner Warmbrunn, foreign student
adviser.
Stanford's 201 foreign scholars
â€”who engage in research, inde
pendent study or teaching- tend
to concentrate in the pure
sciences. The applied sciences,
however, attract Stanford's 800
foreign students defined as
those who are registered, usually
for a bachelor's or an advanced
degree.
ELECTRICAL engineering
skills, vital to developing nations,
attract the largest percentage of
foreign students, but only five
percent of the foreign scholars.
"Part of this can be explained
by the area of origin," Dr. Warm
brunn said. "Europe, obviously
the most highly developed group
of countries, sends us more than
half of our scholars, but our per
centage of European students is
constantly decreasing."
