# The
						Frank Morse Case And The Judicial Process
## Editorial 
### 
There are many distressing aspects of the
Frank Morse case. [See story, page one.]
But the one that bothers us the most is the
University's apparent disregard of the student
judicial process.
Morse was tried by the Stanford in Flor
ence judicial body on March 11 for knocking
a panel from a door on that campus. The
sentence recommended by the Italy Council
was five corp yard hours. Dean of Students
Donald Winbigler, however, upheld the pun

ishment to suspension for spring quarter.
And—since the Italy Council, as well as
all Stanford judicial bodies, is only advisory
in nature—Winbigler had every right to de
termine the penalty.
BUT THE TRANSGRESSION developed
when Morse appealed die case. The dean
ol students did not refer the appeal to the
Stanford Judicial Council. Instead, after con
sulting with the Disciplinary Subcommittee
of the Student Affairs and Services Commit

tee, lie simply refused to reverse his decision.
It is our understanding that the Italy
Council, like every other student judicial
body, is a subordinate branch of the Judicial
Council. 11 this is true, the latter should defin
itely have been consulted before the decision
on the appeal was made.
Frank Morse deserved a fair hearing on

Iiis appeal. He didn't get one.
