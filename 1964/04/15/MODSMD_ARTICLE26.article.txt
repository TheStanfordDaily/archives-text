## Direct Action In Civil Rights— It's Used Only As Last Resort 
### Judy Walborn 
From many Americans who to a greater or lesser extent favor
(lie overall aims oi the Civil Rights Movement one often hears the
comment: "Of course, I think the Negro should have equal oppor
tunities with the White in schooling, jobs, housing, and so forth
. . . but W HY do the Civil Rights leaders have to use such ex
treme measures like sitting-in in Mayor's offices, lying on
airport runways, blocking crowded intersections on city streets, !
etc. \\ hy can't leaders sit down and talk with those with whom '
they have grievances, instead ofemploying such tactics?"
The Reasonable Man approach to problems which is in nearly
all of us — partly the product of our democratic traditions—rebels
against the unorthodox measures employed by Negroes and their
white supporters to gain their freedom.

Win IS DIRECT ACTION used and why has it been stic
csessful. Certainly one of the reasons is to focus World attention
on the Negro struggle in the hope of forcing national leaders to
enact legislation which will bring an end to discriminatory hiring,
educational, housing, and other policies — thereby tidying-up
Uncle Sam's tarnished image in a world which is more than two
thirds non-white. The effectiveness of such a tactic cannot be
minimized.
A second reason is that very often it is the only tactic which
can be used. Last spring, in Atlanta, for example, a manager of
a large department store was approached and asked if he would
be willing to sit down and talk with Negro leaders about his hiring ;
policies, flis curt reply was: 'Damned if I'm going to sit down
with any ol them niggers.' After several months of steady picket
ing by Negro students, during which his business fell by as much
as 17 per cent, the manager called one Negro leader and requested
negotiations.
Whether North or South, however, direct action is rarely used
unless all other channels — all other attempts to settle the issue
peacefully — have failed. This fact is too often overlooked (or not
known) by all-too-ready critics of direct action.

FINALLY, DIRECT ACTION is used to call the attention of
the American people to the oppressive inequalities which have
been part and parcel of almost every Negro's life in this country,
in the hope that direct confrontation with these facts will help to
bring about the eradication of these inequalities.
Wherever Negro people (and their white supporters) have a
genuine grievance (and here, admittedly, it is increasingly diffi
cult for the public to assess the merits of each side, due to the i
complexities of the issues involved, the failure of both sides to
make clear their positions, and the inadequacy of the Press), and
wherever no other remedy which has been tried has been effec
tive, then direct action must and should be used.
