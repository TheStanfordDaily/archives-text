# University Doesn't Keep Half Of Agreement
## The 						Mailbox

Editor, The Daily:
The men of Junipero were
surprised Monday morning to
find a picture of two house
windows on the front page of
the Daily. Somewhat loss sur
prising was the announce
ment that the administration
was again meddling in affairs
in which it has no business.
Students cannot help b u t
have the feeling as expressed
in the Daily editorial that the
matter is "petty." And the ad
ministration could not likely
bo sincere in their reasons
for the policy. The first reason
was "safety," which is not
worth a comment. The second
was "aesthetics," particularly
in reference to the"lit tle old
ladies of Palo Alto." When
Stanford University starts
forming policies to satisfy "lit
tle old ladies," Die Luft der
Freiheit weht nicht, and we
may soon find the "Junior" of
Leland Stanford tied closer
and closer to the word, "Uni
versity."
If the administration were
actually serious about aesthe
tics, it would first have banned
those posters hung precari
ously on every stump and post
on campus. As for the third
"reason," maintenance costs,
students are well aware of
their personal financial re
sponsibility for any perman
ent damage to the room.
In a broader sense the mat
ter is not petty in the least.
It is, in a way, a violation of
the Fundamental Standard by
the administration. According
to the Stanford Handbook,
volume CD. "The Fundamental
Standard also recognizes that
students have rights as well
as responsibilities. Of greatest
import is the right of the stu
dent body to provide for its
own regulation by means of a
judicial system, . . . and the
obligation of the school admin
istration to inform the student
body of all University policies,
procedures, and regulations
applying to them and their or
ganizations."
The obvious violation of both
these rights transforms Fun-
Stan into a "double standard"
used by the University to keep

students in line while not re
specting the other half of the
agreement. Such policies as
banning posters are an insult
lo the intelligence and rights
of students.

• Freedom To Post
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Forsberg's ruling on the
placement of political posters,
signs, and bumper strips in
dormitory windows, even if
there aren't political motives,
is ridiculous and unnecessary.
The reasons that lie gave for
this ruling, which if it is not
new has certainly been ne
glected for t tie two quarters
that I have been at Stanford,
are equally absurd.
First, he states that it is un
safe to lean out of windows to
put on bumper strips. I would
like to know how many people
have been injured from doing
this in the past five or- ten
years. Furthermore, the win
dows ;it Wilbur Hall are so
dirty that one has to hang out
just to see what's going on
outside.
Mr. Forsberg's final point,
the economic factor, is perhaps
the most controversial. In the
average freshman dorms, t he
rooms cost almost SI 00 a
month (fifty dollars per stu
dent) and food is about $70
a month per student. Consid
ering the condition of the ac
commodations provided, and
the quality and amount of food
served, it would seem to those
of us living in the dorms that
we are paying enough money
to have some freedom of ac
tion in considering room decor.
To me, the posters announc
ing coming events which are
hanging on trees and pillars
all over campus and the gar
bage that is left for weeks
around the dorm area are
much more unsightly than a
few simple stickers on the
windows.
Since this ruling proves that
the students are paying only
for the right to live in the

room, the next step will be to
regulate what the students do
to the interiors of their rooms.
Eventually even the Playboy
pictures will have to come
down because the "little old
cleaning ladies" might object.

• To Pay Or Not
Editor, The Daily:
In agreement witn Miss Box
man, I, too, commend the
"War Tax Protest." But have
we gone far enough? I know
people who feel our foreign
aid program is just pouring
their tax money down a hole,
and others who do not like
Bobby spending their hard
earned on tear gas in Missis
sippi. and still others who do
not feel it is right for them
to have to help Tennesseans,
et. al., with their electric bill
via TVA. In short, I doubt that
there is a person in this na
tion who agrees with all Fed
eral spending. Should we keep
paying for these activities we
dislike? Of course not!
But this could become a
mess for the Internal Revenue
Service. The answer is for the
IRS to add another page to
Form 1040. This page would be
a listing of all Federal expen
ditures, together with the per
centage of the tax dollar spent
for each.
One would merely calculate
his tax in the normal manner.
Ho would then go down this
list, checking all projects he
felt like supporting, and add
up the percentages from those
checked. This percentage
would be multiplied by the
previously figured tax. and
the resulting amount would
be the net tax due.
After this system has be
come firmly established, per
haps a similar program could
be set up on the state an d
local level. I am sure the sales
people in Macy's and Wool
worth's would not mind listen
ing to every customer list
which of Governor Brown's
projects he approves of before
they could add the sales tax
to his purchase.
