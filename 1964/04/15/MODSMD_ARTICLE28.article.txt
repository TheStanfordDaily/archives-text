## Use UN As Forum To Expose Commission 
### Darryl R. Wold 
Largely ignored last week was a radical proposal b\ the
Secretary-General of the I nitcd Nations, U Thant of Burma, who
says it is time the I N he empowered to interfere in the domestic
aflairs of a country.
Ilis justification lor this is roughly as follows: some domestic
policies (such as racial discrimination in South Africa and South
ern Hhodesia) can threaten international peace; the preservation
oi peace is the UN's first purpose; domestic intervention ought
to be an accessory of peace-keeping.
It can easily he said that this proposal is the logical result oi
j the trend of UN practices over the last several years, from votes
of censure of domestic policies of other countries to the bloody
operation against Katanga.
★ ★ ★
EVEN SO, U Thant should recognize that concern with the
interna] affairs oi another country is justified only when these inter
nal policies are themselves aggressive, and not whenever they in
vite aggression from another country in simple disagreement with
the policies. But with this in mind, the UN might be forced to
conclude that the real threat to peace is the overtly-aggressive
tendency of the Communist countries, and the double standard
! iu the UN of ignoring Communist aggression while being overly
concerned with other peaceful nations would either have to stop,
or would become a farce.
Of crucial concern to us, however, is how this conflict with
| Communism would be resolved under UN auspices. We can
! only surmise what standards would be applied in alleviating
domestic threats to peace. U Thant himself, though he asks for
the power, seems somewhat unclear as to what would be done
with it.
"It is not Burma's business,' lie once said, "to pass judgment
on the internal affairs of other countries. The recognition of this
basic fact enables us to subscribe to the principles of peaceful co
existence. Our attitude should be governed solely by considera
tions of peace.
But peace alone is only a status, a veneer, and infers nothing
substantive. We have historically valued freedom over peace, but
the UN's concern with freedom might best be described as dis
interested. We cannot rely on the UN, as most of our government
officials recognize, as a substitute for our own foreign policies.
Further, we cannot allow it to interfere in domestic matters, be
cause of its unrecognition of some of our basic principles.
★ ★ ★
THE REAL QUESTION U Thant's proposal raises is with
respect to what our policy toward the UN should be. We cannot
aflord to take the UN as an independent organization too seri
ously. lest we tend to conform our policies to it.
Outright withdrawal has been advocated by many, but this
: probably isn't necessary, although the UN becomes more mean
ingless and hypocritical as more Communist nations are admitted.
We would do well, though, to take more seriously our opportunity
; to use the UN as a forum to expose the failures and transgressions
j of Communism, and tell the world what the West has to offer.
Charles Malik of Lebanon, former president of the General
Assembly, has strongly urged the United States to abandon its
guilt complex in front of the new nations, and use the UN as a
showplace for the ideals and achievements of the West. Surely
we can take the offensive here without running the risk of starting
a war.

concerned with other peaceful nations would either have to stop,
or would become a farce.
Of crucial concern to us, however, is how this conflict with
| Communism would be resolved under UN auspices. We can
! only surmise what standards would be applied in alleviating
domestic threats to peace. U Thant himself, though he asks for
the power, seems somewhat unclear as to what would be done
with it.
"It is not Burma's business,' lie once said, "to pass judgment
on the internal affairs of other countries. The recognition of this
basic fact enables us to subscribe to the principles of peaceful co
existence. Our attitude should be governed solely by considera
tions of peace.
But peace alone is only a status, a veneer, and infers nothing
substantive. We have historically valued freedom over peace, but
the UN's concern with freedom might best be described as dis
interested. We cannot rely on the UN, as most of our government
officials recognize, as a substitute for our own foreign policies.
Further, we cannot allow it to interfere in domestic matters, be
cause of its unrecognition of some of our basic principles.

THE REAL QUESTION U Thant's proposal raises is with
respect to what our policy toward the UN should be. We cannot
aflord to take the UN as an independent organization too seri
ously. lest we tend to conform our policies to it.
Outright withdrawal has been advocated by many, but this
: probably isn't necessary, although the UN becomes more mean
ingless and hypocritical as more Communist nations are admitted.
We would do well, though, to take more seriously our opportunity
; to use the UN as a forum to expose the failures and transgressions
j of Communism, and tell the world what the West has to offer.
Charles Malik of Lebanon, former president of the General
Assembly, has strongly urged the United States to abandon its
guilt complex in front of the new nations, and use the UN as a
showplace for the ideals and achievements of the West. Surely
we can take the offensive here without running the risk of starting
a war.

Largely ignored last week was a radical proposal b\ the
Secretary-General of the I nitcd Nations, U Thant of Burma, who
says it is time the I N he empowered to interfere in the domestic
aflairs of a country.
Ilis justification lor this is roughly as follows: some domestic
policies (such as racial discrimination in South Africa and South
ern Hhodesia) can threaten international peace; the preservation
oi peace is the UN's first purpose; domestic intervention ought
to be an accessory of peace-keeping.
It can easily he said that this proposal is the logical result oi
j the trend of UN practices over the last several years, from votes
of censure of domestic policies of other countries to the bloody
operation against Katanga.

EVEN SO, U Thant should recognize that concern with the
interna] affairs oi another country is justified only when these inter
nal policies are themselves aggressive, and not whenever they in
vite aggression from another country in simple disagreement with
the policies. But with this in mind, the UN might be forced to
conclude that the real threat to peace is the overtly-aggressive
tendency of the Communist countries, and the double standard
! iu the UN of ignoring Communist aggression while being overly
concerned with other peaceful nations would either have to stop,
or would become a farce.
