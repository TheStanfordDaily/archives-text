## 
### GUY FUNABIKI 
A substantial number of Freshmen Class men polled last Mon
day night indicated dissatisfaction with the present rush system.
Out of over three hundred responses to a questionnaire prepared
by the Committee on the Necessity of Considering the Errors of
Hush Now (CONCERN ) 258 expressed dissatisfaction with certain
! aspects of Rush — namely, its

superficiality (175 votes) and
its tendency to place too much
pressure on freshmen (140).
About 80 freshmen said that it
takes too much time and that it
hurts too many feelings.
IX RESPONSE to a question
about the Stanford system of up
porclass living in general, 214
men indicated dissatisfaction as
against 88 who were content with
post-Wilburian living.
Doug Sorensen and Jan Jacobi
of the steering committee of
CONCERN said that CONCERN
is not part of an anti-fraternity
campaign. CONCERN originated
from an informal discussion
among freshmen and a realiza
tion that, granted the current dis
satisfaction with Rush, "impetus
for change should and must come
from the Freshmen class."
Although CONCERN, said
Corenson, is strictly a "freshmen
movement," it has "conferred
with the presidents of the IFC.
the lIIC. and the ASSU, and they
all support our program."
A MEETING will be held to
night at 8 p.m. in ph. 102 for all
freshmen interested in further
CONCERN ac t ion. Discussion
will attempt to formulate both
specific, immediate improvement
and long term, future plans.
