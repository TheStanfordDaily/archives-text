# Negro Termed Prisoner

### BARBARA SCHNUR 
In last night's Tuesday Evening
Series presentation. Paul Jacobs
expressed his concern about 1 h e
problem of communicating the
middle-class values of discipline
and a regular income to the
Negroes whom he termed "per
manent prisoners of a glass tube
that lights up a world they can
always see but never achieve."
Mr. Jacobs stated that if society
does not take immediate and ef
fective steps to achieve commu
nication between middle-class
Americans, both Negro and white,
and the group of "permanent
paupers" who live on the lowest
level of American society, we
may see a "continuous and rapid
deterioration of race relations."
ONK OF THE greatest hind
rances to effective communica
tion in Mr. Jacobs' opinion is the
stereotype of the Negro who is
called by some middle-class Amer
icans "a credit to his race." Ja
cobs pointed out that what one
usually means by that term is
that the Negro in question is like
what one thinks his race ought
to be.
In regard to current civil rights
demonstrations, Jacobs stated
that the major problems of un
employed Negroes are not going
to be solved at the Cadillac show
room in San Francisco. When
questioned about exactly what
will solve those problems, he re
plied that the basic nature of our
present society has to be changed
in order to provide enough jobs
for the people in it.
When asked what he thought
about President Johnson's War
on Poverty, Jacob, said that he
considered it more of a recon
naissance mission than an all-out
war.
