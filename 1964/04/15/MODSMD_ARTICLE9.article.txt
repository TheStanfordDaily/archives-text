# March For Civil Rights Continues
## 
### LINDA HESS 
EDITOR'S NOTE: On April 23-25 Stan
ford will host an All Western Slates Civil
Rights Conference, featuring national civil
rights leaders and students and professors
from schools throughout the West. This
is one of several articles to precede the
conference.
The distance from the Washington Monu
ment to the Lincoln Memorial is aboul two
miles. Last year, on August 28, 210,000
people walked those iwo miles together, sing
ing and carrying banners and wearing in
signia decorated in two main colors: black
and white. Many Washingtonians closed up
their stores and offices and stayed off the
streets, fearing outbreaks of violence and
mass disorder. But there was no violence.
There were speeches and songs and cheers,
a lot of heat in the air and a lot of fire from
the podium. When the last speaker came for
ward he read a list of ten demands from a
card, and 210,000 people pledged that the
March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom
would not be the end, but the beginning, of

a massive and relentless campaign to end
racial discrimination in tho United States.
THE DISTANCE from California to Mis
sissippi is about two thousand miles. This
year, from June through September, thou
sands of students from Stanford and other
schools throughout the nation will cover the
distance between their home states and Mis
sissippi. With the students there will be
teachers, lawyers, nurses, and various other
specialists. They will be working to register
Negro voters, set up schools and community
centers, launch legal offensives against
those who attempt to obstruct voting rights,
and focus national and international atten
tion on Mississippi in the year I after the
March on Washington.
At the beginning of last summer Wash
ington was swarming with rumors of what
was going to take place in August, ranging
from lie-ins across the main streets of the
Capital to camp-outs in congressional offices.
Hate literature from all over the country
piled up on the desks of Congressmen and
Senators, depicting Negros as ape like beasts,
allying Christ with Governor Wallace, and

prophesying disaster on August 28.
YVAKiJKK KUMKIJNCiS are likewise be
ing heard from I lie South. Although Project
Mississippi proposes to do nothing more omi
nous or revolutionary than to further educa
tion and encourage American citizens to
vote, white citizens and political leaders are
mobilizing as if for war.
SUCCKSS WILI, not bo so quick or so
clear-cut this year as it was last. The March
was a dramatic demonstration of unity and
commitment. The Mississippi Project will
be a sustained effort, an enormously com
plex and unprecedented endeavor. There will
be no preliminary meetings and pledges of
cooperation between civil rights leaders and
the Governor of Mississippi, as there were
with President Kennedy.
But what happens this summer in Mis
sissippi will demonstrate to the whole world
whether America is capable of reforming it
self according to the legal and moral prin
ciples by which it claims to be governed. If
we prove to be incapable of reforms, we are
not likely to have another hundred years in
which to play with our pretensions.

THE DISTANCE from California to Mis
sissippi is about two thousand miles. This
year, from June through September, thou
sands of students from Stanford and other
schools throughout the nation will cover the
distance between their home states and Mis
sissippi. With the students there will be
teachers, lawyers, nurses, and various other
specialists. They will be working to register
Negro voters, set up schools and community
centers, launch legal offensives against
those who attempt to obstruct voting rights,
and focus national and international atten
tion on Mississippi in the year I after the
March on Washington.
At the beginning of last summer Wash
ington was swarming with rumors of what
was going to take place in August, ranging
from lie-ins across the main streets of the
Capital to camp-outs in congressional offices.
Hate literature from all over the country
piled up on the desks of Congressmen and
Senators, depicting Negros as ape like beasts,
allying Christ with Governor Wallace, and

prophesying disaster on August 28.
YVAKiJKK KUMKIJNCiS are likewise be
ing heard from I lie South. Although Project
Mississippi proposes to do nothing more omi
nous or revolutionary than to further educa
tion and encourage American citizens to
vote, white citizens and political leaders are
mobilizing as if for war.
SUCCKSS WILI, not bo so quick or so
clear-cut this year as it was last. The March
was a dramatic demonstration of unity and
commitment. The Mississippi Project will
be a sustained effort, an enormously com
plex and unprecedented endeavor. There will
be no preliminary meetings and pledges of
cooperation between civil rights leaders and
the Governor of Mississippi, as there were
with President Kennedy.
But what happens this summer in Mis
sissippi will demonstrate to the whole world
whether America is capable of reforming it
self according to the legal and moral prin
ciples by which it claims to be governed. If
we prove to be incapable of reforms, we are
not likely to have another hundred years in
which to play with our pretensions.
EDITOR'S NOTE: On April 23-25 Stan
ford will host an All Western Slates Civil
Rights Conference, featuring national civil
rights leaders and students and professors
from schools throughout the West. This
is one of several articles to precede the
conference.
The distance from the Washington Monu
ment to the Lincoln Memorial is aboul two
miles. Last year, on August 28, 210,000
people walked those iwo miles together, sing
ing and carrying banners and wearing in
signia decorated in two main colors: black
and white. Many Washingtonians closed up
their stores and offices and stayed off the
streets, fearing outbreaks of violence and
mass disorder. But there was no violence.
There were speeches and songs and cheers,
a lot of heat in the air and a lot of fire from
the podium. When the last speaker came for
ward he read a list of ten demands from a
card, and 210,000 people pledged that the
March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom
would not be the end, but the beginning, of

a massive and relentless campaign to end
racial discrimination in tho United States.
