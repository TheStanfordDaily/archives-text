Moral Standards
Are Not Relative
The system of moral and written standards in the universe originated
with God, not with man, and God's laws are perfect, unchanging, and ab
solute.
The word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous
judgments endureth forever.'' Psalm 119:160.
Modern man has tried to build theologies which deny God's absolute
standards and infinite righteousness, asserting instead, that all moral prin
ciples are relative. Man s attempts to explain away what God is and what
He has declared in His Holy Word, the Bible, in no way affects God. How
ever, the results on our planet are disastrous. All that one need do is look
at our own country, the United States, to see that something is terribly wrong.
Our nation, in the midst of the greatest material prosperity in history, is
torn by racial strife. Our mental institutions are filled to capacity. Man in
the midst of plenty is turning to alcohol, pills, drugs, and other escapist
remedies to try to rid himself of anxiety, confusion, and despair. For mankind
without God is empty, dissatisfied, and unhappy. It is simply not possible to
set aside God's holy laws without reaping a life of misery.
Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy
statutes: for their deceit is falsehood." Psalm 119:116, 117.
Now, no one can live up to the standards of God and His law. There
fore, the whole world stands condemned before God. Partial fulfillment of
His standards is insufficient in God's sight.
Now we know that what things soever the law sciith, it saith to them
who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world
may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall
no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin "
(Romans 3:19, 20).
For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point,
he is guilty of all." James 2:10.
How then can anyone be judged perfect and holy in the sight of God?
Luckily for mankind, God has provided the means by which man can meet
His exacting and perfect standards of righteousness. God sent Jesus Christ
into the world, and He was crucified on the cross so that man might be freed
from the condemnation of the law. This opened the way for the present "Age
of Grace," wherein God credits to our account the righteousness of Christ
the moment we accept Christ as our Saviour. We do not have to earn our
salvation by fulfilling the law. All that is required is that we accept God's
wonderful free gift.
Christianity is not a set of rules for clean living nor is it a format for i
good behaviour. Christianity is accepting a Person, Jesus Christ, as God Who
came to earth in human form 2000 years ago and is alive now and able |
to have them to the uttermost that come unto God by him" . . . Hebrews
7:25. This Person, Christ, gives each Christian the Holy Spirit of God so that
the individual can have strength to live a holy and righteous life.
For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the felsh,
God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, con
demned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled
in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit Romans 8.3, A.
If you are trying to live by God s standards today in your own strength,
or if you are struggling to convince yourself that God s laws are all relative,
why not read your Bible and sec what God really expects of you. Th< Bible
is the Word of God, and Jesus is 'he Word made flesh.

Moral Standards
Are Not Relative
The system of moral and written standards in the universe originated
with God, not with man, and God's laws are perfect, unchanging, and ab
solute.
The word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous
judgments endureth forever.'' Psalm 119:160.
Modern man has tried to build theologies which deny God's absolute
standards and infinite righteousness, asserting instead, that all moral prin
ciples are relative. Man s attempts to explain away what God is and what
He has declared in His Holy Word, the Bible, in no way affects God. How
ever, the results on our planet are disastrous. All that one need do is look
at our own country, the United States, to see that something is terribly wrong.
Our nation, in the midst of the greatest material prosperity in history, is
torn by racial strife. Our mental institutions are filled to capacity. Man in
the midst of plenty is turning to alcohol, pills, drugs, and other escapist
remedies to try to rid himself of anxiety, confusion, and despair. For mankind
without God is empty, dissatisfied, and unhappy. It is simply not possible to
set aside God's holy laws without reaping a life of misery.
Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy
statutes: for their deceit is falsehood." Psalm 119:116, 117.
Now, no one can live up to the standards of God and His law. There
fore, the whole world stands condemned before God. Partial fulfillment of
His standards is insufficient in God's sight.
Now we know that what things soever the law sciith, it saith to them
who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world
may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall
no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin "
(Romans 3:19, 20).
For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point,
he is guilty of all." James 2:10.
How then can anyone be judged perfect and holy in the sight of God?
Luckily for mankind, God has provided the means by which man can meet
His exacting and perfect standards of righteousness. God sent Jesus Christ
into the world, and He was crucified on the cross so that man might be freed
from the condemnation of the law. This opened the way for the present "Age
of Grace," wherein God credits to our account the righteousness of Christ
the moment we accept Christ as our Saviour. We do not have to earn our
salvation by fulfilling the law. All that is required is that we accept God's
wonderful free gift.
Christianity is not a set of rules for clean living nor is it a format for i
good behaviour. Christianity is accepting a Person, Jesus Christ, as God Who
came to earth in human form 2000 years ago and is alive now and able |
to have them to the uttermost that come unto God by him" . . . Hebrews
