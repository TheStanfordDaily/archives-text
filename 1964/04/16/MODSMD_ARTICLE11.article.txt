# Gershoy Presents Views On History
## 
### 
''The most immediate an d
pressing task of history today
is to throw light upon the des
perate international political
scene," Leo Gershoy declared last
night to an audience in Cubberley
Auditorium.
In the second of two lectures
inaugurating the Leon Sloss Jun
ior Memorial Lectures in the Hu
manities at Stanford, Prof. Ger
shoy noted that because the mod
ern historian is better equipped
than his predecessors, he should
not rely upon the journalist to
write "what is inelegantly called
hot history."
WHILE acknowledging the in
herent difficulties, the New York
University professor held that
"it is the duty and the responsi
bility of the historian to give
mankind the needed data on
which it can work. If national pol
icy ultimately depends on the in
terests and desires of the mass
of our citizens, then the teaching
of history must replace indiffer
ence, ignorance and prejudice
with informed public opinion . . .
from time to time individuals and
societies are given opportunities
to make significant choices. They
can do so well only if informed."
Dr. Gershoy began the second
of his two-part address "The Di
mensions of History" with a ser
ies of witty and scholarly obser
vations on man's changing c o n
cept of history, pointing out that
nineteenth century faith in a pro
gressively better world has been
jolted by the events of this cen
tury, "an age of disruption, vio
lence, and war."
BUT HE expressed the view
that the relativistie attitude to
ward history is being encroached
upon by a new breed of historian,

delving with scientific fervor into
"tangible residues of man's activ
ity" long neglected.
Dr. Gershoy concluded by point
ing out that "the prospects for
the future of history are exhila
rating. History remains a narra
tive inquiry with a new dimen
sion of humanist understanding.
It is both art and science."
The first group of addresses in
the Sloss series will be concluded
next week with two talks given
by art historian Leo Steinberg
April 22 and 23.
