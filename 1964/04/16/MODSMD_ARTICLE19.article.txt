## ATHLETIC SPORTS BULLETIN New Pavilion Seen Ready In 3 Years 
### PETE KING 
An 8000-seat basketball pavilion
and greatly expanded intramural
facilities are the bright spots in
Ihe hazy future of athletics on
the Farm.
One of the most important —
and most needed—new facilities
in Stanford's current building
program will be a new pavilion.
The existing one, built way back
in 1920, has been an anachron
ism for over 20 years. Seating
only 2700, it is a quarter the size
of most major college pavilions
on the West Coast. Every game
has a turned-away crowd, some
times numbering hundreds. Most
students are fortunate to see two
of the team's 13 home games.
Each year the freshmen are sub
jected to a baptism o 1 ' fire in the
chaos of registration, held in the
too-cramped confines of the Pa
vilion. Rival coaches curse it as
a "cracker-box."
If well-laid plans materialize,
this situation will be gone in less
than three years.
TARGET DATE SET
Completion of a 6000-seat pa
vilion, with ample parking and
ticket-line facilities, is planned for
December, 1906. The site will be
on the far side of Campus Drive,
next to the soccer field, and vis
ible across the grassy flats from
Wilbur Hall.
The seating will be enlargeable
to 8000, with addition of "end
zone" bleachers. There will be no
posts to block the view. While it
could hardly equal Ihe intimacy
of ihe present Pavilion, the seats
will come right down to the play
ing court. Furthermore, there
will be ample room for TV and
radio coverage, as opposed to the
current set-up, where cameramen
and announcers have to shove
students out of the way to get
elbow-room.
With over double the present
seating, Stanford will be able to
attract Midwestern and Eastern
teams who previously have
shunned the Pavilion because
meager gate receipts couldn't
cover travel expenses.
Stanford basketball coaches ex
tolling the virtues of the Farm
to high school stars will find the
task of recruiting easier with
modern facilities as a lure.
Aside from athletics, the new
Pavilion would enable twice as
many people ot hear visiting lec
tures. For instance, the 1500 per
sons turned away from an Arnold
Toynbee lecture last year in Mem.
Aud. would have easily fit into
the planned pavilion.
MURALS YYOULl) TRIPLE
Intramural facilities would
practically triple with a new pa
vilion. Last year, 273 intramural
games were played on the two
existing courts. This number
could be upped to 2000 with three
more basketball courts, providing
space for intramural and P.E.
Badminton, at present not a sport
here. More room for volleyball
and tennis would enable more
participation.
Intercollegiate volleyball could
be initiated, similar to the present
inter-school bowling program.
The Pavilion is part of the Ath
letic Department's Master Plan,

The Daily Palo Alio made the
following comments on the Pa
vilion when it was being: fin
ished in January of 1922:
"With the spring 1 floor, light
ing system, and ventilating sys
tem, the Stanford Pavilion will,
in Ihe opinion of comptroller
Kotli, take ils place as the finest
court on the coast. It is said to
he the only building* of any size
in the country devoted primarily
to basketball ..."
Prior to the opening game in
the new pavilion, which Stan
ford won 30-21, the Daily com
mented editorially, "There are
several features that should at
tract the curious. It is the larg
est building that is devoted
primarily to basketball in this
section of the country and pos
sibly in the United States. Spe
cial construction arrangements
were made to aid the players of
the court game."

whereby all athletic facilities will
be concentrated eventually on the
other side of Campus Drive, ne
cessitating less walking and less
of a danger in crossing busy
Campus Drive.
Unfortunately, there a hitch to
all this. That hitch is, not sur
prisingly, money. Lack of money
lias been the sole reason so far
for the distressing lack of, and
in some cases total absence of,
indoor sports facilities at Stan
ford.
A new pavilion was one of the
projects of the successful PACK
program. However, most dona
tions were earmarked by the giv
er for specific projects. A n d

there are many alumni whe
would rather leave behind a lib
rary or a fountain than a new bas
ketball pavilion.
ONLY 5 PER CENT
As a result, only five per cent of
the necessary $2,050,000 to build
the pavilion has been contributed
and the University isn't about to
divert many more funds to the
Athletic Department.
So a group called the Commit
tee for the Stanford Pavilion has
been formed and is conducting a
small-scale PACE program of its
own, searching for wealthy alum
ni who can spare a few dollars
for a much-needed pavilion.
Considering the success of the
recent PACE drive and the small
er amount of money needed, it
might seem a simple task. But
fund-raising projects are unpre
dictable. "We'd like to think of
January, 1966, as a completion
date if we get going right away,"
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor
has said. "But we don't have the
money now. We just have to wait
for it to come in."
Until the money does come in,
Stanford sports fans are going to
have to put up with at least two
more years of Pavilion Claustro
phobia and rival coaches will con
tinue to curse the crackerbox.



PUBLISHED HERE for the first time anywhere are architect's drawings of the proposed new athletic
pavilion to be built near the Harry Moloney Soccer Field on Campus Drive. Above is a drawing of the
front of the building, based on a seating plan for 8,000 persons. An alternate plan exists for a 6,000
seating capacity without "end zone" seats. Below is a closer-up view of the entrance to the pavilion.
