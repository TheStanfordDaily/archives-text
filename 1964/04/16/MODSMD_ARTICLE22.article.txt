# Winter Seasons Only Fair
## 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
"Well, you can't win them all."
That was the consensus of most
Stanford partisans in reviewing
the winter of our moderate dis
content in intercollegiate athle
tics.
As usual, there were stretches
where the Tribe was as untouch
able as a Hindu Leper, and then
of course, there were stretches
where its play in the various
sports was as confusing as the
recent University action banning
political stickers on windows.
But mostly it was run-of-the
mill.

In basketball, Howie Dallmar's
unit started off as quickly as a
cuckold's consort caught in the
act, as they sped to six straight
victories to open what looked like
a most promising season.
The Indians gained successive
wins over Oregon (twice), San
Jose, Kansas, St. Mary's, a n d
Southern Methodist, before star
center Tom Dose was injured and
forced out of the line-up.
The cagers sustained their first
defeat, with Dose not playing,
against Arizona State at Tempe.
Next they split with USC, and
rolled over Washington twice.
At this point the Indians had
a more than respectable record
of 9-2. But to come was the road;
five long weeks without a single
home game; five Jong weeks
which included five straight de
feats, and little to show but
blisters.
UCLA started the decline. The
Indians blew an early lead under
the withering pressure of the
famed Bruin fast break in the
first game, and were never in the
second one at all.
Next came the Beavers of Ore
gon State, in their last year un
der the wizard-like aegis of Slats
Gill, and Ihe Tribe discovered
they were eight points worse than
their northern neighbors, no
more no less, as they dropped
two by identical 65-57 scores.
After a split with Cal, each
winning on the other's floor, the
NCAA champions to be, the
UCLA Bruins, invaded the Pa
vilion to do battle with the In
dians for 1 hn third limp 1 li i << s»<j i.

son, and the results were similar
to the first two.
A record Card fans will cherish
with somewhat more glee was
that tallied by Tom Dose when,
while the Indians were beating
WSU on the Farm, the depend
able and often great center
poured in 42 points, and set a Pa
vilion and all-time team record.
Stanford finished the season
with a 15-10 record overall and a
9-6 Big Six performance, netting
a second place for Dallmar's war
riors, ahead of third place Cal.

Stanford swimmers looked bet
ter in the water than Marilyn
Monroe in "Something's Got To
Give," as they proved themselves
second only to National champion
Southern Cal among West Coast
splashers, and gained a twelfth in
the NCAA meet at Yale Univer
sity in New Haven, Connectieutt.
Mike Doscher set a Stanford
school record as he placed eighth
in the 200-yard freestyle.
Standouts for the Indians were
Illka Suvanto, who plans to swim
for Finland in the next Olympics
and who won points consistently,
Marty Hull, a butterfly specialist,
and Mike Doscher, a sophomore
whose best times have come in
the freestyle events.

The Gymnastics team has not
been one of the more notably
auspicious Stanford specialities in
recent winter sports seasons.
But this year, under first year
interim coach John Gilmore, the
Tribe's gymnasts registered some
"firsts" which bode better things
for their future fortunes.
One consistent performer was
A 1 Miyamoto who gained ninth
place nationally for his consider
able abilities on a side horse.
Needing only polish and ex
pected, along with Miyamoto, to
form the nucleus for next year,
are three sophomores who picked
up some valuable points for the
Indians this season.

Rugby was possibly the bright
est spot in a foggy winter, as
Pete Kmetovic's boys rolled up a
13-1 season won-loss record.
Their victories ranged from a j
64-0 drubbing of USC, to a 3-3 !

squeaker over the Peninsula
Ramblers at Monterey.
It was a team with a great sup
ply of veterans, including star
grad student Gordon Waddell. a
versatile fullback who showed his
versatility by handling all the In
dian kicking chores as well.
Leading Stanford's rushes along
with Waddell were Steve Van
Nort, Dick Shaw, Clark Weaver,
and Dick Ragsdale at fullback.
Anchoring the Indian's tough
line were Dick Leeuwenberg, Jack
Chappie, Tom Fortmann, Randy
Vahan, and Ron Fraboni.
Using these leaders, the rug
gers managed to turn in excel
lent and consistent play, espe
cially in both contests with Cal's
Golden Bears, winning the first
one 15-14, and losing the second,
13-6.

The debut of new wrestling
coach Bill Leland was also a suc
cess, if a somewhat unspectac
ular one, as the grappling Indians
wrestled to a 4-4 season record.
Led by co-captain Phil Kendall,
who went through the regular
season undefeated at 157 pounds,
the matmen rumbled well, despite
early injuries which forced some
of Leland's competitors into
heavier weight classes.
Aside from Dick Anderson at
123, the lower weights proved to
be the Indian's Sherman Adams,
Bobby Baker, Waterloo, or what
ever.
At 167, Joel Kay and Steve
Schaum alternated, both of whom
gave more than they took, and
both of whom should become the
nucleus around which next year's
squad can be built.
In the unlimited class, big Dun
can Ross and water polo All-
American Don Buchler took
turns, with Buehler or Ross usu
ally the Stanford starter.

Such the winter for Stanford
at hletes.
Some flashes of greatness,
fewer spurts of ineptness, and
general solid performances
; throughout. But mostly run-of
-1 I lie-mill.
