# 88 CANDIDATES
## Ralston Greets Grid Hopefuls 
### TOM ELIAS Daily Sports Editor 
Stanford's head football coach John Ralston expects a big
turnout of over 85 men for the first of 20 spring drills this Satur
day, April 18. Beginning his second second season at Stanford,
ex-Cal man Ralston is out to improve considerably on last season's
3-7 record.
Only one change has been made in the coaching staff for the

now year. Mike White, whe
played under Ralston at Cal wher
tho Tribe headman was an assist
ant there, has replaced Frank
Williams, who moved over tc
Utah State as athletic director
two months ago. White has been
in charge of out of state recruit
ing since coming to the Farm,
and will help with the ends and
backfield during the drills.
22 LETTERMEN OUT
A' large contingent of letter
men, 22 in all, will lead the way
through the practice sessions.
Thirty candidates will be up from
the freshman team which went
2-1-1 last year, including a tie
with the unbeaten California
Cubs.
The biggest holes in the lineup
caused by graduation will be at
center, middle linebacker, end
and fullback. Kent Colberg and
Marv Harris are gone from the
middle of the line, Frank Pati
tucci and Bob Burke from t h e
ends, and three of the top four
fullbacks, Tony DeLellis. Ken
Babajian and Dan Conaway, are
gone.
This means a heavy responsi
bility will fall on the broad shoul
ders of sophomore Otis Smith, a
former All-State center from
Evanston, Illinois, senior B o b
Howard, a second-string end last
year, and Glenn Myers, a junior
fullback who came on very strong
toward the end of last season.
OB JOB WIDE OPEN
The quarterback position, a big
problem last year after Clark
Weaver was injured in the IJCLA
game, may once more be a
problemâ€”at present it is nothing
but a big question mark. The
Daily sees four strong candidates
now in the running for the regu
lar job.
These would be Mike Connelly,
who won't participate in Spring
practice because he is a baseball
pitcher; Dick Berg, who emerged
as the regular as last season pro
gressed; Terry DeSylvia, a trans
fer from Oregon; and Dave Lew
is, up from the freshmen and
called by some potentially the
best seen on the Farm since
Frank Albert.
Ralston had said that Connelly
would not hurt his chances by
staying with baseball this spring.
One other position which will
take quite a bit of filling will be
Steve Thurlow's old left halfback
spot. Strongest candidates to be
returnee Dick Ragsdale's running
mate in the backfield are transfer
John Guillory, a 175 pound speed
ster who played for Oakland City
College last year, and Bob Blunt
and Bob Oar, two 180 pounders
up from last year's freshman
team.
Coach Ralston told the Daily
this week that he expects to make
no major changes in his style of
play for next season. He did say,
however, that the new substitu
tion rule passed by the NCAA
could not help but have some
effect.
TO FIELD THREE UNITS
As a result of the new rules,
Ralston expects to field three dis
tinct units of specialists. His first
team, the eleven best men he has,
says the coach, can expect to be
a defensive platooon and spend
about 80 per cent of their prac
tice time on defense. His next
best eleven can expect to be the
offensive unit, spending most of
their time finding new ways 1o
penetrate enemy defenses.
There should also be a third
unit, capable of going either way,
but the men on this team will not
be as good athletes as those on
the first two.
This system is actually a vari
ation of the system used by Paul
Diet/el at LSI! prior to his mov
ing to West Point. But Ralston
rates his team in the reverse or
der that Dietzel used his boys.
The Army coach's first team, his
"White" unit, was made up of
his top eleven players. The sec
ond team, called the "Go" team,
worked entirely on offense and
the third team, the "Chinese

! Bandits," was an exclusively de
i fensive team.
Ralston does concede that if one
of his top eleven men is a great
quarterback or an exceptionally
speedy flanker, he will be used
on offense rather than defense,
j But he did say that Dick Rags
dale, for instance, certainly one
[ of the best eleven players on the
team, might very well play de-
I fense in 19(54.
Rags went both ways in 1963,
i playing on the first unit that went
both ways. Another possible de
fensive starter is halfback Craig
Ritchey, the speedster who ran
several punts and kickoffs back
for scores last fall. Playing de
fense would be no new experi
ence for Ritchey, though, as he
played first-string defense
through the last half of the sea
son last year.
Almost certain stalwarts on Ihe
defensive forward wall will be
j Dic k Leeuwenberg and Bob Nich-
I ols. two bruisers who have al
! ready been drafted as "futures"
j by teams in both professional
I leagues. John Wilbur and Joe
! Neal are another pair who appear
certain to establish themselves on
, Stanford's first line of defense.
Jack Chappie is another who
is almost certain of a first string
berth, even though he will not
practice this spring. Chappie is
excused from spring workouts
because he is one of the top shot
putters on Payton Jordan's track
team.
DEFENSE IS KEY
Ralston's reasoning in setting
up his three units the way he in
tends is simple. The Tribe mentor
figures that the way to win
games is to keep the other guys
from scoring. If they don't score,
the worst you can do is a 0-0 tie.
Hence, an all-out effort to keep
the other team from scoring is
the way to do the most to insure
victory.
One man Ralston is counting
on heavily, particularly since so
much emphasis is being placed on
defense, is kicking specialist
Braden Beck. Last fall, Beck was
successful on all twelve of his
extra point attempts, and on
eight field goal tries. Ralston has
so much faith in his kicker, in
fact, that he has indicated that he
will frequently have his quarter
backs call for field goal attempts
from as far out as thirty yards.
With the usual caution and re
serve of coaches speaking with
reporters, Ralston would not go
out on a limb and name the prob
able first eleven that will emerge
from the spring drills.
He did name seven men up
from the frosh who he feels
could be a big help next fall.
These would be John Read, a 216
pound fullback from Alameda;
Mike Ilibler, a 211 pound fullback
from Palo Alto; Bob Blunt, a
halfback from Escondido; Bob
Oar, another halfback, from Aber
deen, Washington; Jack Longi
notti, a 222 pound tackle from
San Jose; A1 Wilbur, a 6-1 end
from Madera; and Dave Lewis,
the quarterback from Clovis.
Spring practice will end on Sat
urday, May 23, with Ihe annual
Alumni-Varsity game in Stanford
Stadium.
