# Varsity Preps For Tough Alumni Game
## 
### TOM ELIAS Daily Sports Editor 
Football, intercollegiate at least
in slyle, returns to the Farm with
a bang on Saturday, May 23,
when a star-studded Alumni
squad bumps heads with a hope-
Cully well-oiled gridiron machine
called the Stanford Indians.
Paul Wiggin of the Cleveland
Browns, John Brodie of the San
Francisco 19ers, Dr. Dick Home
and Norm Manugian, coaches all,
will do their best to keep their
charges sober for the game. And,
if they are sober', the Alumni
should prove a challenge for any
team to beat, even John Ralston's
Redskins.
QB'S ARE DEEP
Even though Brodie, still in the

process of strengthening his pass
ing arm after last season's break,
will .just sit on the bench, the
quarterback position, kop to any
team's success, won't be at all
weak. Dick Norman will most
likely make the trip out to the
Farm, and if he does, he will gel
the starting nod.
But. the Big Game hero of two
years ago, Clark Weaver, recent
ly graduated and more recently
married, will see some action if
the Army doesn't require him 1o
be elsewhere.
If neither of these two make
it, Brodie can call on Jack Taylor,
a quarterback and flanker for
Jack Curtice for several years.
HARRIS ON GUARD
Marv Harris, last season's cap

tain and middle linebacker, is the
closest thing to a guard on their
rosier. Harris, an All-Coast selec
tion the last two years, played
guard his first two varsity cam
paigns and most likely will be
used there by line coach Wiggin.
The big Brown defender him
self heads up the strong tackle
corps. He will be backed up
strongly by 19(52 standout C. B.
Simons, 1960 captain Dean Hen
shaw and 1963 Pittsburgh Steeler
rookie Frank Atkinson, a key
man in his team's drive for the
Eastern Division title.
With current senior class presi
dent Kent Colberg backing up
Harris, the middle of the line will
be able to hold its own.
BACKFIELD DEEPEST
But: the backfield and the ends
are where Ihe Alumni are tough
est and deepest. Five good ends,
some of them men that Ralston
must wish he had back again this
year, buoy the flanks, along with
former flanker and Olympic hur
dler Chuck Cobb. The live are
Frank Patitucci and Bob Burke
off last year's team and Sam
Morely, George oHnore and Dr.
Gary Van Galder off earlier
teams.
In the backfield, the fullback
spol will be deepest, with five
men raring to go. Skip Face, full
back and place kicker par excel
lence on the Dick Norman teams
of a few years ago, heads the list,
closely followed by such as Tony
DeLellis and Dan Conway off the
1963 team, and Hick McMillan
and El Stuber off earlier days.
AI the halves will be New York
Giant draftee Steve Thurlow, the
run-pass ihreat. of a year ago,
Tim Hansel and Jim Schroyer, de
fensive specialists of the past two
years, and Larry Royce, a half
back and student body president
in 1961-2.

strongly by 19(52 standout C. B.
Simons, 1960 captain Dean Hen
shaw and 1963 Pittsburgh Steeler
rookie Frank Atkinson, a key
man in his team's drive for the
Eastern Division title.
With current senior class presi
dent Kent Colberg backing up
Harris, the middle of the line will
be able to hold its own.
BACKFIELD DEEPEST
But: the backfield and the ends
are where Ihe Alumni are tough
est and deepest. Five good ends,
some of them men that Ralston
must wish he had back again this
year, buoy the flanks, along with
former flanker and Olympic hur
dler Chuck Cobb. The live are
Frank Patitucci and Bob Burke
off last year's team and Sam
Morely, George oHnore and Dr.
Gary Van Galder off earlier
teams.
In the backfield, the fullback
spol will be deepest, with five
men raring to go. Skip Face, full
back and place kicker par excel
lence on the Dick Norman teams
of a few years ago, heads the list,
closely followed by such as Tony
DeLellis and Dan Conway off the
1963 team, and Hick McMillan
and El Stuber off earlier days.
AI the halves will be New York
Giant draftee Steve Thurlow, the
run-pass ihreat. of a year ago,
Tim Hansel and Jim Schroyer, de
fensive specialists of the past two
years, and Larry Royce, a half
back and student body president
in 1961-2.
Football, intercollegiate at least
in slyle, returns to the Farm with
a bang on Saturday, May 23,
when a star-studded Alumni
squad bumps heads with a hope-
Cully well-oiled gridiron machine
called the Stanford Indians.
Paul Wiggin of the Cleveland
Browns, John Brodie of the San
Francisco 19ers, Dr. Dick Home
and Norm Manugian, coaches all,
will do their best to keep their
charges sober for the game. And,
if they are sober', the Alumni
should prove a challenge for any
team to beat, even John Ralston's
Redskins.
QB'S ARE DEEP
Even though Brodie, still in the

process of strengthening his pass
ing arm after last season's break,
will .just sit on the bench, the
quarterback position, kop to any
team's success, won't be at all
weak. Dick Norman will most
likely make the trip out to the
Farm, and if he does, he will gel
the starting nod.
But. the Big Game hero of two
years ago, Clark Weaver, recent
ly graduated and more recently
married, will see some action if
the Army doesn't require him 1o
be elsewhere.
If neither of these two make
it, Brodie can call on Jack Taylor,
a quarterback and flanker for
Jack Curtice for several years.
HARRIS ON GUARD
Marv Harris, last season's cap

tain and middle linebacker, is the
closest thing to a guard on their
rosier. Harris, an All-Coast selec
tion the last two years, played
guard his first two varsity cam
paigns and most likely will be
used there by line coach Wiggin.
The big Brown defender him
self heads up the strong tackle
corps. He will be backed up
strongly by 19(52 standout C. B.
Simons, 1960 captain Dean Hen
shaw and 1963 Pittsburgh Steeler
rookie Frank Atkinson, a key
man in his team's drive for the
Eastern Division title.
