## IM Director Bugge About To Terminate 35 Year Job 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
Intramural Director Elvvyn B. Bugge, the Invisible Man of Stan
ford athletics, is a living example that old Stanford men never die,
they devote themselves to the betterment of their alma mater.
With 35 years on the Stanford staff, and 14 years in his present
position, the story of Bugge's career is the story of the growth of
a University.
And when he steps down after summer quarter as an Associate
Professor of Physical Education and Educatio emeritus, he finishes
an active association with Stanford that began when he enrolled
here in 1922.
Back then, Charlie Davis was Director of Intramurals and the

vogue of campus dress was
"cords, the dirtier the better, and
sombreros." Bugge procured the
proper attire, and graduated with
a B.A. in Economics in 1926.
In 1929, he officially became an
instructor at Stanford under
fencing coach Harry Maloney,
whom he had assisted during his
undergraduate years, and began
teaching tennis, a sport he has
taught throughout his tenure.
TENNIS COACH
He served as Varsity and Fresh
man tennis coach from 1911 to
1950, when he assumed control
of intramurals in 1950 on the
departure of Chuck Taylor, who
left to become a coach with the
San Francisco 49'ers, before

eventually coming back to the Farm to rise to the post of Athletic
Director.
But a bare biographical sketch doesn't take into account the man
who has gone about his job of arranging schedules in 16 sports,
whih encompass 4,104 participants, with a minimum of fanfare and
a maximum of effort.
It also doesn't take into account a man who has had to overcome
the sundry and irritating pitfalls of his profession including: fresh
man sports desk workers who haven't yet familiarized himself with
Greek letters and have to ask three time how "Zete" is spelled; in
clement weather; and last minute changes in murals schedules.
VERSATILITF
But throughout the irritations and drudgeries. Bugge's versatility
has always marked his work. Besides teaching tennis and running
the intramural program, he has taught a class in intramural direc
tion. been (he official timer for track and football, been a member
of the 1960 and 1964 U.S. Olympic Fencing Committee, is in his
final year as a member of the NCAA Fencing Rules Committee, and
taught that sporl here from 1938, until it was dropped in 1955.
Fencing was taken away for the twin reasons of lack of space
and lack of student interest. Bugge avers that there is little space
for the sport, but cites his tutoring of several fencers at Stanford
and the founding of a Fencing Club as proof that there is interest
yet in the ancient sport.
He has continued his involvement in fencing through volunteer
ing his efforts as a teacher of advanced fening in the women's de- I
partment, and for his ativity on the NCAA, and Olympic Committees. |
He was instrumental in acting to introduce the idea of having a j
committee for the accreditation of fencing masters, and helped j
formulate the plan for this which was accepted by the Fencing
Coaches of America at Harvard just last month. Bugge has always
been one of the leaders in national fencing circles.
He also has established a reputation for Stanford as having one
of the outstanding intramural programs in the nation, and has ex
changed ideas with «-ome of the best physical education experts in
the country.
"TMK SHADOW"
But for his many laurals, his fencinge xpcrtise, his continually
well coordinated administration of complex intramural schedules, he
remains, as old radio melodrama would have it,"The Shadow," the
unseen figure who makes sure everything comes out all right in the
end.
There have been a loi of changes since the twenties, when the
Farm was just that, when registration totaled 4,000, and when the
faculty used to go over to the Faculty Club and shoot pool after a
difficult day of teaching.
But. intramurals haven't really changed too much. Programs
have been dropped and programs have been added but the purpose
and goals of the program has remained essentially the same: to
involve those students in athletics who aren't able to play in the ever
more competitive realm of college varsity athletics; and draw in
those who live off campus into campus activities.
The success of Bugge in achieving these goals shows in those
2,115 individuals last year alone who took part in "Murals." The im
provement of the department has been slow but steady, and. in the
future, Bugge expects co-recreational activities plus a fencing club
to advance the activities yet further.
But now, the future seems less important than the past and when
Bugge speaks, he speaks humbly with a nostalgic glint in his eye
as he reviews three and one-half decades at Stanford, the years of
Harry Maloney, of Charlie Davis, of A 1 Masters, and of the athletes
who will always be enshrined in the annals of Stanford sports heroes.
He goes from topic to topic.
CORDS WERE THE STYLE
"Yes, things haven't really changed very much. Students have
about the same enthusiasm in sports students always have had and
always, I hope will have- where we once wore cords and som
breros the new breed wears beards.
"Intramural Directors have to live and learn. I remember once
when I stated that all games in touch football would be played rain
or shine. A week later, with the rain pouring down so heavily that
you couldn't see ten yards, a couple of teams tried to make me live
up to my promise, and were quite angry when 1 had to call the game
off. I don't know if modern Stanford students would do that.
"I guess I'll miss this place, in some ways, but then again I'm
looking forward to retirement. It won't really be a complete retire
ment; I'll keep timing track and football as long as they'll have me.
If I go to a game, I figure as though 1 might as well be doing some
thing instead of just sitting and watching.
"The Tthletic Department has always given Intramurals their ,
complete support, they always have been most generous."
And so his reminiscences go. Sometimes disconnected, somolimes !
rambling, but always revealing a genuine, well-rounded person.

Stanford has a recognized top-notch intramural program flue
largely to the persistent, and dedicated efforts of Flwyn B. Bugge.
the Invisible Man of Si an ford athletics.


ELWYN BUGGE
Intramural Director Elvvyn B. Bugge, the Invisible Man of Stan
ford athletics, is a living example that old Stanford men never die,
they devote themselves to the betterment of their alma mater.
With 35 years on the Stanford staff, and 14 years in his present
position, the story of Bugge's career is the story of the growth of
a University.
And when he steps down after summer quarter as an Associate
Professor of Physical Education and Educatio emeritus, he finishes
an active association with Stanford that began when he enrolled
here in 1922.
Back then, Charlie Davis was Director of Intramurals and the

vogue of campus dress was
"cords, the dirtier the better, and
sombreros." Bugge procured the
proper attire, and graduated with
a B.A. in Economics in 1926.
In 1929, he officially became an
instructor at Stanford under
fencing coach Harry Maloney,
whom he had assisted during his
undergraduate years, and began
teaching tennis, a sport he has
taught throughout his tenure.
TENNIS COACH
He served as Varsity and Fresh
man tennis coach from 1911 to
1950, when he assumed control
of intramurals in 1950 on the
departure of Chuck Taylor, who
left to become a coach with the
San Francisco 49'ers, before

eventually coming back to the Farm to rise to the post of Athletic
Director.
But a bare biographical sketch doesn't take into account the man
who has gone about his job of arranging schedules in 16 sports,
whih encompass 4,104 participants, with a minimum of fanfare and
a maximum of effort.
It also doesn't take into account a man who has had to overcome
the sundry and irritating pitfalls of his profession including: fresh
man sports desk workers who haven't yet familiarized himself with
Greek letters and have to ask three time how "Zete" is spelled; in
clement weather; and last minute changes in murals schedules.
VERSATILITF
But throughout the irritations and drudgeries. Bugge's versatility
has always marked his work. Besides teaching tennis and running
the intramural program, he has taught a class in intramural direc
tion. been (he official timer for track and football, been a member
of the 1960 and 1964 U.S. Olympic Fencing Committee, is in his
final year as a member of the NCAA Fencing Rules Committee, and
taught that sporl here from 1938, until it was dropped in 1955.
Fencing was taken away for the twin reasons of lack of space
and lack of student interest. Bugge avers that there is little space
for the sport, but cites his tutoring of several fencers at Stanford
and the founding of a Fencing Club as proof that there is interest
yet in the ancient sport.
He has continued his involvement in fencing through volunteer
ing his efforts as a teacher of advanced fening in the women's de- I
partment, and for his ativity on the NCAA, and Olympic Committees. |
He was instrumental in acting to introduce the idea of having a j
committee for the accreditation of fencing masters, and helped j
formulate the plan for this which was accepted by the Fencing
Coaches of America at Harvard just last month. Bugge has always
been one of the leaders in national fencing circles.
He also has established a reputation for Stanford as having one
of the outstanding intramural programs in the nation, and has ex
changed ideas with «-ome of the best physical education experts in
the country.
"TMK SHADOW"
But for his many laurals, his fencinge xpcrtise, his continually
well coordinated administration of complex intramural schedules, he
remains, as old radio melodrama would have it,"The Shadow," the
unseen figure who makes sure everything comes out all right in the
end.
There have been a loi of changes since the twenties, when the
Farm was just that, when registration totaled 4,000, and when the
faculty used to go over to the Faculty Club and shoot pool after a
difficult day of teaching.
But. intramurals haven't really changed too much. Programs
have been dropped and programs have been added but the purpose
and goals of the program has remained essentially the same: to
involve those students in athletics who aren't able to play in the ever
more competitive realm of college varsity athletics; and draw in
those who live off campus into campus activities.
The success of Bugge in achieving these goals shows in those
2,115 individuals last year alone who took part in "Murals." The im
provement of the department has been slow but steady, and. in the
future, Bugge expects co-recreational activities plus a fencing club
to advance the activities yet further.
But now, the future seems less important than the past and when
Bugge speaks, he speaks humbly with a nostalgic glint in his eye
as he reviews three and one-half decades at Stanford, the years of
Harry Maloney, of Charlie Davis, of A 1 Masters, and of the athletes
who will always be enshrined in the annals of Stanford sports heroes.
He goes from topic to topic.
CORDS WERE THE STYLE
"Yes, things haven't really changed very much. Students have
about the same enthusiasm in sports students always have had and
always, I hope will have- where we once wore cords and som
breros the new breed wears beards.
"Intramural Directors have to live and learn. I remember once
when I stated that all games in touch football would be played rain
or shine. A week later, with the rain pouring down so heavily that
you couldn't see ten yards, a couple of teams tried to make me live

and goals of the program has remained essentially the same: to
involve those students in athletics who aren't able to play in the ever
more competitive realm of college varsity athletics; and draw in
those who live off campus into campus activities.
The success of Bugge in achieving these goals shows in those
2,115 individuals last year alone who took part in "Murals." The im
provement of the department has been slow but steady, and. in the

to advance the activities yet further.
But now, the future seems less important than the past and when
Bugge speaks, he speaks humbly with a nostalgic glint in his eye
as he reviews three and one-half decades at Stanford, the years of
Harry Maloney, of Charlie Davis, of A 1 Masters, and of the athletes
who will always be enshrined in the annals of Stanford sports heroes.
He goes from topic to topic.
CORDS WERE THE STYLE
"Yes, things haven't really changed very much. Students have
about the same enthusiasm in sports students always have had and
always, I hope will have- where we once wore cords and som
breros the new breed wears beards.
"Intramural Directors have to live and learn. I remember once
when I stated that all games in touch football would be played rain
or shine. A week later, with the rain pouring down so heavily that
you couldn't see ten yards, a couple of teams tried to make me live
up to my promise, and were quite angry when 1 had to call the game
off. I don't know if modern Stanford students would do that.
"I guess I'll miss this place, in some ways, but then again I'm
looking forward to retirement. It won't really be a complete retire
ment; I'll keep timing track and football as long as they'll have me.
If I go to a game, I figure as though 1 might as well be doing some
thing instead of just sitting and watching.
"The Tthletic Department has always given Intramurals their ,
complete support, they always have been most generous."
And so his reminiscences go. Sometimes disconnected, somolimes !
rambling, but always revealing a genuine, well-rounded person.

Bugge leaves, one of Stanford's institutions will be leaving with i
him. But leaving only after 35 years of coordinating the coordinating
the activities of tens of thousands of Stanford students,, usually even
without their knowledge.
Stanford has a recognized top-notch intramural program flue
largely to the persistent, and dedicated efforts of Flwyn B. Bugge.
the Invisible Man of Si an ford athletics.


ELWYN BUGGE
Intramural Director Elvvyn B. Bugge, the Invisible Man of Stan
ford athletics, is a living example that old Stanford men never die,
they devote themselves to the betterment of their alma mater.
With 35 years on the Stanford staff, and 14 years in his present
position, the story of Bugge's career is the story of the growth of
a University.
And when he steps down after summer quarter as an Associate
Professor of Physical Education and Educatio emeritus, he finishes
an active association with Stanford that began when he enrolled
here in 1922.
Back then, Charlie Davis was Director of Intramurals and the

vogue of campus dress was
"cords, the dirtier the better, and
sombreros." Bugge procured the
proper attire, and graduated with
a B.A. in Economics in 1926.
In 1929, he officially became an
instructor at Stanford under
fencing coach Harry Maloney,
whom he had assisted during his
undergraduate years, and began
teaching tennis, a sport he has
taught throughout his tenure.
TENNIS COACH
He served as Varsity and Fresh
man tennis coach from 1911 to
1950, when he assumed control
of intramurals in 1950 on the
departure of Chuck Taylor, who
left to become a coach with the
San Francisco 49'ers, before

eventually coming back to the Farm to rise to the post of Athletic
Director.
But a bare biographical sketch doesn't take into account the man
who has gone about his job of arranging schedules in 16 sports,
whih encompass 4,104 participants, with a minimum of fanfare and
a maximum of effort.
It also doesn't take into account a man who has had to overcome
the sundry and irritating pitfalls of his profession including: fresh
man sports desk workers who haven't yet familiarized himself with
Greek letters and have to ask three time how "Zete" is spelled; in
clement weather; and last minute changes in murals schedules.
VERSATILITF
But throughout the irritations and drudgeries. Bugge's versatility
has always marked his work. Besides teaching tennis and running
the intramural program, he has taught a class in intramural direc
tion. been (he official timer for track and football, been a member
of the 1960 and 1964 U.S. Olympic Fencing Committee, is in his
final year as a member of the NCAA Fencing Rules Committee, and
taught that sporl here from 1938, until it was dropped in 1955.
Fencing was taken away for the twin reasons of lack of space
and lack of student interest. Bugge avers that there is little space
for the sport, but cites his tutoring of several fencers at Stanford
and the founding of a Fencing Club as proof that there is interest
yet in the ancient sport.
He has continued his involvement in fencing through volunteer
ing his efforts as a teacher of advanced fening in the women's de- I
partment, and for his ativity on the NCAA, and Olympic Committees. |
He was instrumental in acting to introduce the idea of having a j
committee for the accreditation of fencing masters, and helped j
formulate the plan for this which was accepted by the Fencing
Coaches of America at Harvard just last month. Bugge has always
been one of the leaders in national fencing circles.
He also has established a reputation for Stanford as having one
of the outstanding intramural programs in the nation, and has ex
changed ideas with «-ome of the best physical education experts in
the country.
"TMK SHADOW"
But for his many laurals, his fencinge xpcrtise, his continually
well coordinated administration of complex intramural schedules, he
remains, as old radio melodrama would have it,"The Shadow," the
unseen figure who makes sure everything comes out all right in the
end.
There have been a loi of changes since the twenties, when the
Farm was just that, when registration totaled 4,000, and when the
faculty used to go over to the Faculty Club and shoot pool after a
difficult day of teaching.

He has continued his involvement in fencing through volunteer
ing his efforts as a teacher of advanced fening in the women's de- I
partment, and for his ativity on the NCAA, and Olympic Committees. |
He was instrumental in acting to introduce the idea of having a j
committee for the accreditation of fencing masters, and helped j
formulate the plan for this which was accepted by the Fencing
Coaches of America at Harvard just last month. Bugge has always
been one of the leaders in national fencing circles.
He also has established a reputation for Stanford as having one
of the outstanding intramural programs in the nation, and has ex
changed ideas with «-ome of the best physical education experts in
the country.
"TMK SHADOW"
But for his many laurals, his fencinge xpcrtise, his continually
well coordinated administration of complex intramural schedules, he
remains, as old radio melodrama would have it,"The Shadow," the
unseen figure who makes sure everything comes out all right in the
end.
There have been a loi of changes since the twenties, when the
Farm was just that, when registration totaled 4,000, and when the
faculty used to go over to the Faculty Club and shoot pool after a
difficult day of teaching.
But. intramurals haven't really changed too much. Programs
have been dropped and programs have been added but the purpose
and goals of the program has remained essentially the same: to
involve those students in athletics who aren't able to play in the ever
more competitive realm of college varsity athletics; and draw in
those who live off campus into campus activities.
The success of Bugge in achieving these goals shows in those
2,115 individuals last year alone who took part in "Murals." The im
provement of the department has been slow but steady, and. in the
future, Bugge expects co-recreational activities plus a fencing club
to advance the activities yet further.
But now, the future seems less important than the past and when
Bugge speaks, he speaks humbly with a nostalgic glint in his eye
as he reviews three and one-half decades at Stanford, the years of
Harry Maloney, of Charlie Davis, of A 1 Masters, and of the athletes
who will always be enshrined in the annals of Stanford sports heroes.
He goes from topic to topic.
CORDS WERE THE STYLE
"Yes, things haven't really changed very much. Students have
about the same enthusiasm in sports students always have had and
always, I hope will have- where we once wore cords and som
breros the new breed wears beards.
"Intramural Directors have to live and learn. I remember once
when I stated that all games in touch football would be played rain
or shine. A week later, with the rain pouring down so heavily that
you couldn't see ten yards, a couple of teams tried to make me live
up to my promise, and were quite angry when 1 had to call the game
off. I don't know if modern Stanford students would do that.
"I guess I'll miss this place, in some ways, but then again I'm
looking forward to retirement. It won't really be a complete retire
ment; I'll keep timing track and football as long as they'll have me.
If I go to a game, I figure as though 1 might as well be doing some
thing instead of just sitting and watching.
"The Tthletic Department has always given Intramurals their ,
complete support, they always have been most generous."
And so his reminiscences go. Sometimes disconnected, somolimes !
rambling, but always revealing a genuine, well-rounded person.
lIIGGINS NEW MAN
When Joe liiggins takes over the reins next Fall and Eleyn B. I
Bugge leaves, one of Stanford's institutions will be leaving with i
him. But leaving only after 35 years of coordinating the coordinating
the activities of tens of thousands of Stanford students,, usually even
without their knowledge.
Stanford has a recognized top-notch intramural program flue
largely to the persistent, and dedicated efforts of Flwyn B. Bugge.
the Invisible Man of Si an ford athletics.
