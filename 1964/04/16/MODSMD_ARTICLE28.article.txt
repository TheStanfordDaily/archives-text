# Long-Range View Of SU Sports Good
## 
### PETE KING 
Are Stanford athletics, cur
rently a little below the level of
some Coast colleges, going to im
prove in the future? The habit
ual Farm sports addict, wearily
accustomed to moral victories,
might say no. But times are
changing and the picture actually
looks fairly bright.
Most predictions of college
sports are ridiculously optimistic,
envisioning great athletes and
conference championships galore.
This one will attempt to be re
alt istic. The level of Stanford ath
letics is not going to increase a
great deal, mainly because of the
University's high admissions
standards. But the slow trend is
definitely upward.
ADMISSIONS GAP
This isn't due so much to Stan
ford's efforts, but to the rapidly
rising admissions standards at i
other schools. Stanford is one of
only two private universities in
the eight-team conference. For
the rest, the policy often has been
to admit anyone with a high school
GPA over 2.5 (or even lower).
However, schools like Washing
ton have raised their require
ments half a grade point in five
years, due to the increased pres
sure to get in.
Since Stanford's standards (and
the size of the entering class) j
have remained fairly constant,!
this means that the "admissions
gap" is rapidly closing between
Stanford and olher conference
schools.
Thus, fewer so-called "profes
sional athletes," to whom athle
tics comes first and academics
second, can enter or even stay j
in school. The number of such
athletes has always been low on
the Farm for obvious reasons, but
they have proliferated at some
other campuses so much that
Stanford teams have often swept
debate tournaments while suffer
ing through 0-10 football seasons.
COSTS HURT
What about finances? Since
Stanford costs far more than pub
lic universities, the Athletic De
partment has had to rely on Buck !
Club tuition grants and hashing
jobs to eliminate the difference.
To a degree, this help enables
over 100 athletes a year to attend
Stanford, who otherwise couldn't
come here.
Despite these efforts, the strict!
admissions standards and high
cost means that Stanford teams ;
will have to make up in quality
what they will generally lack in ;
quantity.
Stanford's superior coaching I
staff can bolster the quality, but ;
these comparative disadvantages:
Stanford has can'l help but hurt !
the athletic program.
MORE SPORTS?
It looks like the sports program |
will be enlarged, also. Up to now.
mediocre football gate receipts
have had to support the whole
athletic program, with inevitable
cutbacks resulting. The univer- 1
sity is now chipping in more I
money for the intramural pro
gram, freeing other funds fori
transportation expenses. With '
even more university money and |
hopefully better football receipts,
Stanford could sponsor intercol- j
legiate handball and volleyball, i
for example, or send Stanford
teams back east.
In all likelihood, the improve

ments and enlargements men- \
tioned in Stanford sports won't S
he obvious for several years. But \
then one can always come to
Stanford games as an alum. L

Are Stanford athletics, cur
rently a little below the level of
some Coast colleges, going to im
prove in the future? The habit
ual Farm sports addict, wearily
accustomed to moral victories,
might say no. But times are
changing and the picture actually
looks fairly bright.
Most predictions of college
sports are ridiculously optimistic,
envisioning great athletes and
conference championships galore.
This one will attempt to be re
alt istic. The level of Stanford ath
letics is not going to increase a
great deal, mainly because of the
University's high admissions
standards. But the slow trend is
definitely upward.
ADMISSIONS GAP
This isn't due so much to Stan
ford's efforts, but to the rapidly
rising admissions standards at i
other schools. Stanford is one of
only two private universities in
the eight-team conference. For
the rest, the policy often has been
to admit anyone with a high school
GPA over 2.5 (or even lower).
However, schools like Washing
ton have raised their require
ments half a grade point in five
years, due to the increased pres
sure to get in.
Since Stanford's standards (and
the size of the entering class) j
have remained fairly constant,!
this means that the "admissions
gap" is rapidly closing between
Stanford and olher conference
schools.
Thus, fewer so-called "profes
sional athletes," to whom athle
tics comes first and academics
second, can enter or even stay j
in school. The number of such
athletes has always been low on
the Farm for obvious reasons, but
they have proliferated at some
other campuses so much that
Stanford teams have often swept
debate tournaments while suffer
ing through 0-10 football seasons.
COSTS HURT
What about finances? Since
Stanford costs far more than pub
lic universities, the Athletic De
partment has had to rely on Buck !
Club tuition grants and hashing
jobs to eliminate the difference.
To a degree, this help enables
over 100 athletes a year to attend
Stanford, who otherwise couldn't
come here.
Despite these efforts, the strict!
admissions standards and high
cost means that Stanford teams ;
will have to make up in quality
what they will generally lack in ;
quantity.
Stanford's superior coaching I
staff can bolster the quality, but ;
these comparative disadvantages:
Stanford has can'l help but hurt !
the athletic program.
MORE SPORTS?
It looks like the sports program |
will be enlarged, also. Up to now.
mediocre football gate receipts
have had to support the whole
athletic program, with inevitable
cutbacks resulting. The univer- 1
sity is now chipping in more I
money for the intramural pro
gram, freeing other funds fori
transportation expenses. With '
even more university money and |
hopefully better football receipts,
Stanford could sponsor intercol- j
legiate handball and volleyball, i
for example, or send Stanford
teams back east.
In all likelihood, the improve

ments and enlargements men- \
tioned in Stanford sports won't S
he obvious for several years. But \
