# Spring Teams Start Fast, Slow Up Soon
## 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
II started out like a pretty
good spring sports season for
Stanford this year—but so far
that hasn't been Ihe way it's
turned out. Stanford got to
laugh first, and a loud chuckle
il was, but now Indian rooters
in almost all sports have quiet
ed down.
The track team started the
spring sports season off with
a loud bang when it sped to a
117-103 win over San Jose State
in the Stanford Relays and
followed wilh an 80-65 whip
ping of the Fresno State Bull
dogs.
Meangme, Dutch Fehring's
basebaH team was racking up
seven straight wins against
non-conference competition, be
fore being brought down 1o
earth by a Santa Clara team
currently ranked first in iho
nation.

The bubble first burst for
the track team when it
dropped an 85-60 meet to the
same San Jose State team il
had defeated earlier in there
lay meet. The Spartans, coach
Payton Jordan said later,
"were better than we thought
they were. VVe had thought
we'd be able to beat them."
The coach was not so philos
ophical the next week, after a
heartbreaking 74-71 loss to Bill
Bowerman's Oregon squad. All
he had for reporters after lhat
one was a big "No comment."
And rightly so, for Jordan
was sick of making excuses
for the men on his team who
had not come through. Some
did come through, however,
last weekend at Southern Cal.
The Redskins dropped the

meet by a 95-50 count, but did
get some come-through jobs
anyway.
Co-captain Steve Cortright
was one who did the job. Corf
right won the intermediate
hurdles wit ha 37.2 time, sec
ond best collegiate time in the
nation this year. Cortright also
got seconds in the triple jump
and in the high hurdles to
score a meet high of 11 points.
Paul Schlicke was another
who came through in that
meet, just as he has all year.
The junior distance star,
pressed by Bruce Bess in the
mile, posted the best college
time of Ihe year, winning in
4:03.1, and came back to win
the two mile in 8:58, the out
standing double by a Stanford
track man this year.
The rest of the way may be
a littlo easier for Jordan's
boys, as their remaining dual
meets are with teams from
UCLA, Washington State and
Cal, none of whom have im
pressed this season.

The baseball team has been
hurting for a dependable pitch
er all season. Occasional flash
es of brilliance have marked
Ihe otherwise mediocre per
formance of Dick Kovacevich,
Terry Docken and Mike Con
nelly, the top three starters.
All these men have looked
impressive against non-league
opponents, but have been in
effective in CIBA play. Th e
only exceptions to this rule
have been Docken's route-go
ing job against Cal two weeks
ago, Kovacevich's six innings
of shutout relief against. Cal
in the first game of the Big
Series, and a 1-0 defeal that
John Mason, a second-liner,

suffered in the second game
of the UCLA doubleheader.
The hitting has also been
spotty. The team average to
dale is .265, and Jim Hibbs is
responsible for most of it with
his personal .44S average. Gary
Smilh is another who has de
veloped into a good hitter of
late. And Pete Middlekaufl', the
first baseman, has recently
showed signs of developing
into a good batter.

The tennis team, led by soph
omore Jim Beste, has done a
better job than any other of
the spring sports teams. Bud
Renker's unit has won the
Northern California intereol
legiates, with Beste taking Ihe
individual title.
The only defeats they have
suffered have come in the two
dual meets played in Los An
geles two weeks ago. And those
losses came at the hands of
defending NCAA champ USC,
led by Davis Cupper Dennis
Ralston, and UCLA, led by Ar
thur Ashe, and favored to win
the NCAA this year.
The Indians get a rematch
with SC this weekend, when
they take on the Trojans on
the Farm.
Stanford's crew got off to an
auspicious start: this season
when it whipped Southern Cal
and Oregon State in a three
team race at Redwood City
harbor last weekend.
Earlier, the senior boat had
pulled an upset in beating the
sophomores in the interclass
race.

That's the way it's gone this
spring. Some wins, some losses,
a lew outstanding individual
performances and half a sea
son has gone bv.
