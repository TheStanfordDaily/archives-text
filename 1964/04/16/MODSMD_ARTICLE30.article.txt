## Stanford Encourages All-Around Stars Like Ken Lilly 
### PETER EAKLAND 
Specialization and division of
labor were a long time in coming
to industry, and looking around
at the sports scene today we see
that they have entered this area
also. Hitters who are good only
at pinch-hitting are valued mem
bers of major league baseball
teams. Football players adorn the
lineup whose specialties are kick
ing, passing offense, and defense.
The fate of the multiple sports
star at Stanford, coaches remark
in unison, is safe from creeping
specialization despite overlapping
seasons. Athletes at some nearby
schools are not as lucky.
SC FOOTBALL coach John Mc-
Kay prohibits his players from en
gaging in rugby. Cal's new head
football coach is Ray Willsey.
Last quarter he said he would
not let his star quarterback Craig
Morton, a star baseball outfielder,
compete for the Cal sawpitters
this year. He wanted him out for
spring football, and that is where
Craig is now. In his first year,
Willsey has a legitimate gripe in
wanting the mason of his attack
to learn but whether his wishes
should deprive the baseball team
of needed manpower is another
question.

The sports department recently
received a letter from attorney
James Reavis about I ho exploits
of Ken Lilly. He entered Stanford
in 1915 at the youthful age of 16,
and before graduating with hon
ors degrees in liberal arts he ac
cumulated nine Block "S" Awards
in four different sports. Both
achievements have never been
equaled since.
He began his-Stanford athletic
career rather inauspiciously, only
going out for baseball in his fresh
man year. Next fall, playing
rugby, a game he knew nothing
about, he scored all 15 points in
the big game of Ihe year for the
leam against Santa Clara.
IN SPRING, his abilities over
flowed onto two sports arenas as
he piled up three letters in both
track and baseball. Ho played
centerfield for Ihe baseball team,
which he both captained and
coached in his junior year. Rais
ing his letter total to nine were
two letters in basketball. Lilly's
ball-handling ability enabled the
Indians to lop Cal and win the
Coast Championship his senior
year.
What happened to versatile ath
letes like Ken Lilly at Stanford?
Nothing. This year, Jack Chappie,

has played instrumental roles in
the success of three varsity
sports. He bolstered the football
line from the guard position,
played a strong front row for the
rugby team during the winter,
and now is Stanford's best var
sity shot putter, putting the lead
ball consistently in llie 54' re
gion.
Athletes with two sports 1o
their credit are numerous, too
numerous to mention all. Differ
ent sports that involve primarily
the same skills are easy to double
up in. Football players such as
! Dick Leeuwenberg, Bob Nichols,
i Dick Ragsdale, and Dick Shaw
find the transition to rugby an
easy and enjoyable one. For
swimmers Marty Hull, Pete Pclti
grew, Bill Ready, Bill Lorton, and
Ron Kovas switch over 1o water
I polo with little trouble, also.
TYCE FITZMOKRIS, a reserve
halfback, this spring is backing
up Eric Frische in the flashes.
Clayton Raaka, Mister Defense
and Mister Rebound of this year's
basketball team, is also a top
track star, this spring having
cleared the crossbar at 6'6" in
thehigh .jump. Mike Connelly, one
of the quarterbacks in the thick
of (he fight for (he first string
assignment, is currently pitching

for the baseball team. Like Chap
pie, he will miss spring practice.
Athletic Director Chuck Tay
lor says that a player can go o' t Â«i
for as many sports as he wishes
as long as he is contributing
to the performance of a varsity
sport. All freshman football can
didate must go out for spring
practice because participating in
another sport would not add to a
varsity sport. An athlete, supefl)
in one sport but only mediocre in
another, would be encouraged to
stick with his best sport.
Skills and strategy in sports
change in sports from year to
year so that a coach would want
a player if possible to attend
practices. But seasons have been
getting longer and longer so that,
baseball and track practice the
year r'ound. A player who plays
more than one sport often finds
he must make up for lost time.
THE RISE in academic stand
ards hinders many would-be iTuft
tiple sports stars. Coaches make
sure that a student is sound acad
emically before permitting him to
play two or three sports. Iron
ically, many athleles find Ihey get
their best grades during the sea
sons they compete because
know they are short on time ami
accordingly do not waste it.
