THE BEST RACE in Saturday's home track meet with UCLA promises
to be the mile. Speedy Bruin sophomore Bob Day, shown here, had
the fastest AAWU time of 4:07.5 until Stanford's Paul Schlicke ran
the year's fastest collegiate mile of 4:03.1 last week. The duel
should produce a time close to four minutes.
