# Crews To Race OSU On Tricky Course
## 
### 
Stanford's three unbeaten]
crews head north Saturday for!
a traditionally no-holds-barred!
race with Oregon State.
The races will be held on the
Williamette River, wi I h ex
tremely tricky currents. The Bea
ver boatmen know these waters
well enough to force opposing
boats into the places of swift
running water, slowing th e m
down.
Last year, however, a cagey
Stanford coxswain practically
forced the Beavers up the river
bank with clever maneuvering.

This year OSLT, fresh from im
pressive. three-length defeats by
Stanford last week, should be out
for revenge.
The Indian varsily will be seek
ing its eighth straight win over
Oregon State on the mile-long
course. The win string may be
longer, but that's as far back as
ihe senior crewmen can remem
ber.
This will be Stanford's second
race for varsity, .TV, and frosh
boats. OSU two weeks ago lost
by six lengths to Long Beach
State.
There are four sophomores in
the eight-man senior boat, with
two juniors and two seniors.
They are: Peter Whelan, Bruce
Erickson. Larry Hough, Carl
Longley, Dave Bobbins, Frank
Hubbard, and John Elder. Stroke
is Larry Klaussen. Coxswain
will be either Hie Cedervvall or
