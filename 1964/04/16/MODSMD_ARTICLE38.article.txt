# MOVIE REVIEW
## McCarthy Movie Electric 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Staff Editor 
Few men in recent American
history compare to Senator Jo
seph R. McCarthy in the total
opprobrium and condemnation
connected with his name. In the
past ten years no individual hat
been so totally identified with
black hypocrisy, ruthless dema
goguery, and the "forces of evil
eating at the foundations of de
mocracy."
Given the totality of this pre
vailing judgment, the film "Point
of Order" is a most remarkable
production, for it presents with
comparative objectivity an elec
trifying sketch of McCarthy in
action, a sketch which catches the
issues at ihe heart of the Mc-
Carthy era and exposes the roots
of the incredible furor of those
years. At the same time it helps
to explain the remarkable popu
larity followed by the rapid de
cline of the junior Senator from
Wisconsin.

"POINT OF ORDER" is a ser
ies of excerpts from films of the
Army-McCarthy heari 11 g s of
spring 1954. Its only stars are
those actually involved in the
high-tension political drama of
the hearings, which lasted some
IKK hours over 36 days and wore
recorded with some 2.00(1.000
words transcribed onto 7.124
pages.
The context of the hearings in
the McCarthy career is left un
told. The hearings, specifically,
were to investigate charges by
the Army that McCarthy and
members of his staff had sought
to obtain special privileges for
Private G. David Sehine, a staff
assistant who had been drafted
in November 1953.
McCarthy's counter-charge, also
under investigation, was that
the Army was using Sehine as a
"hostage" to "blackmail ' McCar
thy into discontinuing the long
series of often damning investi
gations of Defense Department
security procedures.
The hearings came at a time
when McCarthy's popularity was
on a decline. Even top Republi
cans were beginning to react to
the Senator's attacks. In the tele
vised Sehine case, he was fight
ing for his political life while
trapped into a prolonged debate
about his own honesty.
The second problem of editing
in the film is the disjointedness
of the episodes, few of which are
followed long enough to establish
their signifeance in the whole
case. One can never be sure that
the picture is not distorting by
omission. But it must be rea
lized that the film is not a sum
mary of the hearings; it is,
rather, a presentation of the most
dramatic or revealing segments,
designed to capture the issues in
volved and to picture McCarthy's
"method."

TIIE CENTRAL ISSUE of the
McCarthy era, stated by the Sena
tor as the film opens, is the en
forcement of security regulations
necessary to keep Soviet espion
age agents out of key positions
in the government. Regulations
had been disturbingly lax in the
late forties and early fifties, al
lowing persons of questionable
loyalty to influence policy and
obtain top secret defense informa
tion. McCarthy's power came
from a certain validity to th e
case for which he fought.
But it was the McCarthy
method that came under attack.
1 le was guilty of smear and name
calling. of attributing guilt by
association, of blatant exaggera
tion in accusing disloyalty and
Communist leanings.
"Point of Order" shows Mc-
Carthy at his best and at his
worst while refusing to white
wash either the Army or the
Democratic members of the In
vestigations Subcommittee.
Most important, the film shows
something that is usually forgot
ten amidst the floods of abusive
verbiage emotionally heaped on
McCarthy; namely, that he was a
home-grown politician using the
methods, the rhetoric, the kind
of insinuation, and the ethics of
common, petty politics.
When the Army-McCarthy hear
ings were televised, people saw
the desperate maneuverings of a
petty politician indulging exces
sively in th e all-too-common
"dirt" of everyday politics, and
even those who supported tighter
security measures were revulsed.
Raise what points of older he
would, by the end of 1954 the
political McCarthy was dead.
