## New Rush Proposal Fails; Old Faults Not Eliminated 
### DANIEL DEWEY Eating Club Manager 
! The new rush proposal to be
discussed by LASSU fails to
I achieve its two objectives: the
j elimination of the "superficiality
and pressure" of rush and the 1
preservation of the Wilbur House
program.
The committee that designed)
{ this proposal failed its objectives
! because of the multitude of com
-1 promises that had to be struck
i between the fundamentally dif
ferent groups that were to parti
cipate.
For discussion, let us define j
"superficiality" as meaning that;
: freshmen are choosing ;i group I
j without adequate knowledge of!
! its composition and the groups'

| are choosing freshmen without
; knowing them and "pressure" as
I meaning that freshmen are under
j the strain of having to choose too
quickly and that the upperclass
living groups are under the strain
of selling themselves to the fresh
men.
THE PROPOSAL, Section B,
j states that there may be three
I open houses starting the fifth
week of Winter Quarter, contact
at meals after the first open
house, and "one off-campus rush
party, at which there will be no
hard' liquor, no dates, and no en
tertainment from outside the
group may tie held the week be-
I fore 'dead' week," in other words,
a beer-bust.
1 The faults of these provisions

are twofold. First, the timing oi
i the open houses places them in
• competition with mid-terms and
i term papers and therefore re
; duces the probability that either
, ihc freshmen or the living groups
will tfive each other much con
sideration. 'I'llis problem is par
tially alleviated by contact at
I meals, but few organizations can
.afford to carry a regular body ol'
non-paying guests (and the
J choice of who would be invited to
I meals would by regulation be con
fined to impressions received in
the "stand up, smile, shake
.hands" situation of open house).
Secondly, the prime function of
| winter rush is to allow the l'resh
| men a chance to explore various
groups, make initial contact with
members, and gain a general idea
|of 1 he* choice he will eventually
make and. conversely, to enable
the living groups to get a gen
eral view of the freshman's char
! acter.
★ ★ ★
Till] KKGIKTKATIOXS of the
j proposal negate its good inten
jtions; the lucky freshman with
1 the "Rush Image" who is invited
j to meals will be able to get very
little insight into a group. llt
I will at best get to know some
| members fairly well from an in-
I tellectual standpoint it intel
lectuality is an attribute of the
group's meal hour but he will
know nothing of the myriad of
other factors thai compose a
s t r u e t e r e d organization. Sup
posedly. the beer-bust would help
to correct this, but it is doubtful
that beer-busts represent the
principle focus of many organi
zations' social calendar. This
i added to the fact that few people
would be willing to attend a beer
bust at the beginning of 1 >ead
Week makes this event a doubt
ful sou; e of information.
Sect' '"jertaining to Spring
Quarter, x cif'e.s thai there will
e two ■ houses 'he first week
with no ' arties. a beer-bust Fri
day of the second week, and a
third open house the third week.
Unrestricted parties will he al
lowed on Friday of the third week
and Saturday of the fourth week.
Formal acceptance of the bids
may he made through the Dean's
j office on Wednesday of the fifth
: week.
The problems with this section
i are essentially the same as those
of Winter Quarter. The restric
tions prevent the freshmen and
'the upperelassmen from know-
I ing very much about each other
until the time for exploration has
passed. Open houses represent
j the height of superficiality, and
; meal hours represent only on e
i facet of life in an upperclass or
ganization. A freshman joining
an organization will want to
! know as much as he can about
that organization: what the mem
bers are like, what kind of social
! events they enjoy, how they con
duct themselves at these events,
and what other group or sub-
I group activities they participate
in. Conversely, the organizations j
want to know the same things
; about the freshmen they are to
j accept as members. Under the
; new proposal, all groups are
painted alike and the representa
tion of true character can only
be communicated verbally a
i poor substitute for participation.
★ ★ ★
As KIXiAKDS pressure, the
new proposal would act to in-'
I crease the pressure. Restricted j
I from knowing the overall make
up of an organization until the
third week of Spring Quarter, the
| freshman would then either have
to drop everything in an effort
j to locate the organization that is
j most appealing to him or join i
one that is not appealing to him. j
The upperclass groups, pre- j
I vented from showing the true!
j advantages and nature of their I
i organization, would have to use J
every means of pressure an d I
subterfuge they can contrive to
insure an adequate pledge class j
for their continued existence.
The second objective of the
| proposal, the preservation of the
Wilbur House system, is being
approached from an unfair and,
I unintelligent direction.
I To be sure, the House program ,
lis important and beneficial: but
i it is time that the sponsors recog-!
! nizo that it can best he preserved i
|by improvement, not by the [
I elimination of competition. Thev!
have a captive audience, and if
! they cannot provide a program!
interesting enough to keep fresh '
j men there, they should not be al
lowed to confine the freshmen to J
j quarters. (The .sponsors are not
'the representatives of the fresh-]

For discussion, let us define j
"superficiality" as meaning that;
: freshmen are choosing ;i group I
j without adequate knowledge of!
! its composition and the groups'

| are choosing freshmen without
; knowing them and "pressure" as
I meaning that freshmen are under
j the strain of having to choose too
quickly and that the upperclass
living groups are under the strain
of selling themselves to the fresh
men.
THE PROPOSAL, Section B,
j states that there may be three
I open houses starting the fifth
week of Winter Quarter, contact
at meals after the first open
house, and "one off-campus rush
party, at which there will be no
hard' liquor, no dates, and no en
tertainment from outside the
group may tie held the week be-
I fore 'dead' week," in other words,
a beer-bust.
1 The faults of these provisions

are twofold. First, the timing oi
i the open houses places them in
• competition with mid-terms and
i term papers and therefore re
; duces the probability that either
, ihc freshmen or the living groups
will tfive each other much con
sideration. 'I'llis problem is par
tially alleviated by contact at
I meals, but few organizations can
.afford to carry a regular body ol'
non-paying guests (and the
J choice of who would be invited to
I meals would by regulation be con
fined to impressions received in
the "stand up, smile, shake
.hands" situation of open house).
Secondly, the prime function of
| winter rush is to allow the l'resh
| men a chance to explore various
groups, make initial contact with
members, and gain a general idea
|of 1 he* choice he will eventually
make and. conversely, to enable
the living groups to get a gen
eral view of the freshman's char
! acter.

I will at best get to know some

duct themselves at these events,
and what other group or sub-
I group activities they participate
in. Conversely, the organizations j
want to know the same things
; about the freshmen they are to
j accept as members. Under the
; new proposal, all groups are
painted alike and the representa

be communicated verbally a
