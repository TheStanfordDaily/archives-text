## Why Not Post Signs Saying 'No Posters In Dorm Windows' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Oh humm, what a quandry!
My poli sci I teacher told me that
Stanford students are apathetic,
politically stagnate. My art his
tory teacher told me Stanford
students are not aesthetic, that
they can't appreciate the beauty
in common things, i.e.. campus
signs. My sociology prof, told me
that Stanford students tie incap
able of an "I-Thou" relationship,
that they treat people as objects.
I was plunged into the depths
of despair, until the little old
maid, corridor 38, Stern Hall
solved my re-entry problem. She
kept asking me if there wasn't
some little something she could
do for me (hang the economy!)
like furnish scotch-tape to hang
up a poster (if political protest on
my window. In this way she
could feel herself needed, loved,
a "Thou" to my "I." Here w a s
my opportunity for authentic ex
istence in ail three areas.
E QUICKLY took up a political
cause, heated and slightly trivial
as all campus politics are. I ex
pressed my enthusiasm in ma
terial terms onto a poster mod
eled after Marc Chagall to do my
small part for beauty at Stan
ford. Of course, I included a note
at the bottom saying, "I loved
God and hated Communists" for
the sake of little old Palo Alto
ladies and to achieve the proper
aesthetic balance.
Taking my life in my hands, I
reached out of my window sill
to tape on the chef-d'oeuvre. My
head whirled as I looked down
into the terrifying, perilous
heights to the ground three feet
below. This I dared, endured to
boldly implant my protest against
Stanford political and aesthetic
apathy before the critical eyes of
an inauthentie world. My little
old maid beamed approval.
BUT ALAS, today I learned I
must take down my little sign,
must again be inauthentie in the
vital political and aesthetic
modes. Must I live forever an
"I-him?" Will my hunger for an
"I-thou" never be filled? But I
say no to inauthentieity.
I will create a new and more
beautiful sign a sign with a pre
cise political commitment. It will
say in Van Goghian colors: "Thou
shalt put no posters on d orm
windows." My little maid will
again feel authentic, I'll be politi
cally and aesthetically fulfilled,
and the administration, God
knows, should be satisfied. How
meaningful when they can say
"aye" to my "thou."

Editor, The Daily:
I am willing to accept the fact
that a pacifist is not necessarily
a marching, sign-wielding beat
nik. 1 know few of this breed but
think I can agree that they have
a genuine love of humanity
(whatever that means).
I like such people: they are
warm and sympathetic to the:
needs of others. I do not believe
that the pacifists are either rea-1
sonable or rational in refusing to j
pay income taxes. 60 per cent of
which goes for a "defense" effort.
They have substituted emotion
for reason; sentiment for
thought.
There is perhaps a slim minor
ity of people in our government
in our country that believe in
war or killing as a way of life.
But war is fought between na
tions. not between people. Even
a demagogue could not convince
the mass man that each and
every Russian, including Mr. Pet
roviteh (for example), desires to

I annihilate the United States.
BUT HE CAN convince him
j that "the Russians" cannot be i
trusted, and we can deduce that
"the Russians" do not think radi-1
j cally differently from John Dot 4
I If Ivan does battle, you can be
reasonably certain that it will be
with the impression that he is
fighting a defensive war. which
must (of course) be pushed to
ward "victory."
. . . Unless the pacifists really j
think and question whether or not
they are getting through to those
j who would "bury us," then the,\
| are only making pointless exhibi
| tions.
I believe that people like Miss
Baez and Miss Bozman will be a
positive force for peace if the>
will fight not governments
but the intangible forces of fea;
J and suspicion. That they believe
as they do is far less important
than that many others come to
hold their beliefs. The refusal to
pay war taxes is appealing CI) to
ihe so-called intellectuals and 12>
to the tax-dodger.
Stanford has a commendable i
record of support for the Peace
Corps. This, and similar projects,
is the way to win the peace.

..." 'The second is the aesthe- j
j tic factor! ... the signs look bad
and the bottles in the windows'
might be objected to 'by the little
old ladies from Palo Alto.'"
We fee) <1) it is a little late to
be worried about the aesthetic
[qualities of the buildings con
cerned (2) that the posters were
not made to be beautiful but to |
j express a commitment to a man j
i or a belief (3) that the little old
1 ladies should be no concern of
this university if they lead to
such travesties as this. We have,
howe v e r ineontrovertible evi-'
I denee to dispute this statute on!
such grounds.
A RECENT POLL, the Little
Old Ladies Lucid and Indifferent
| Poll On Prejudices (or LOLLI
POP). taken in a random fashion
: from an infintely large sampling
I of little old ladies in and around
the sewing circles and magazine
i stands of Palo Alto, has come to
the conclusion that 72 per cent I
| of the ladies interviewed agreed
strongly with the statement that
i they could not see far enough to j
read a billboard much less see a j
bottle in a window. (What are!
they doing looking in windows
anyway?)
"We all pay high room and
board bills, and tape on the win
dows makes them even higher, I
since it has to be cleaned off."
We do. indeed, pay every high
room and board bills, but we can
not find evidence of the win
dows being cleaned more than I
once a year, if at all. Perhaps the
University considers it too dan
gerous for their employees to!
clean them more frequently?

As members of the Stanford
community and as freshmen, we
strongly feel < that questions
raised Tuesday night during the!
| Frank Morse case warrant fur '
ther consideration. We believe |
that the investigation was incon
clusive and would like to see a
thorough re-examination by con- i
stituted authorities.
