## Judicial Council To Investigate Possible Administration Inequities 
### BILL SMITH Associate Editor 
"Frank P. Morse is suspended and the ease is closed."
This is the final word from Dean of Students H. Donald Win
biglcr, according to Jeff Littleboy of the University News and Pub
lications Service. Winbiglcr was not available for comment today.
Morse, whose unprecedented public retrial before the ASSU

Judicial Council took place Tugs-'
day evening, was found guilty of
I punching out the panel of a door
j in the Stanford-in-Italy campus.
THK JUDICIAL council of the
j campus in Italy had decided upon
restitution and five corp yard
j hours <is the punishment for the
i act. Morse when he returned to
j campus learned that Winbigler
; had reviewed the decision and,
j acting with the advice of a sub
committee of the Student Affairs
and Services Committee, decided
. on suspension for one quarter as
punishment.
At Morse's request the ASSU
' Judicial Council agreed to vacate
i the decision of the Italy council
land grant Morse a public retrial.
THK SECOND part was an in
icfuiry into the procedural ele
| ments of the Morse-Langstaff
j trial in Italy and an examination
| of the events surrounding
! Morse's suspension. Langstaff
I has not been suspended.
Several facts became clear dur
j ing the trial.
First, Morse had been involved
; in another incident which had re
sulted in damage to the Florence
'campus. Both times, apparently,
there was no malicious intent.
Ron Langstaff willfully, in retri
bution for Morse damaging his
door, broke the panel in Morse's
| door.
SKCONI), no minutes were
j kept of the proceedings of the
I Judicial Council in Italy, as far
' as is now known. The only state
| ment of fact about the matter is
i contained in a letter to one of the
Italy campus's administrators,
Dr. Guelfe Frulla, sent by To m
Connoughton, head of the council
t here.
Third, the Administrative Re
view Committee of the Italy cam
pus is supposed to be composed
of four members. One of the
members was not present. Ac
cording to Darnell Halverson.
chairman of Men's Council, there
was not unaminity among the
members present on the punish
ment for the act.
| FOURTH. Morse was not told
I where he could appeal the deci
sion made in Italy. This right is
I guaranteed by the ASSU Consti
j tut ion, adopted by the Board of
Trustees in 1963. Additionally,
Morse was not informed of hi s

lights during the Italy Council
meeting and he was not given
adequate time to prepare a de
fense. Both of these rights are
guaranteed by the ASSU Consti
tution.
Fifth, when Dean Winbigler re-
I viewed the decision, he relied
j solely on the letter Connaughton
| sent to Frulla, and on the letters
| ho received from the other mem
i ho is of the Administrative Com
mit too.
According to Connaughton, no
students were interviewed by the
! Dean's office to verify the infor
mat ion already on hand.
JUDICIAL COUNCIL C h a i r
man Darrell Halverson said Tues-
I day, "WO do not question that the
i Deans acted in good faith. Wo
| are only presenting our side. Wo
j feel Ihere may be contradictions
j in University statements and poli
cies and inequities in the system."
Transcripts of the proceedings
: from Tuesday evening are being
sent to Ernest Bosig, a lawyer
I for the American Civil Liberties
j Union, to Judge Benjemin Duni
i way, of the Circuit Court in San
j Francisco and a member of the
; Board of Trustees of the Univer
j sity. to Dean Winbigler, to Presi
dent Sterling, and to ASSU Prosi
j dent Bud Wedin.
The belief of the Judicial Coun
cil that Morse's rights have been
infringed have led the council to
send transcripts to both the
ACLU and Judge Duniway.
ERNEST BESIG, of the ACLU.
told the Daily, "We are interested
in students receiving due process
of law. Their careers are at stake.
And a valuable right should not
Ibo taken without duo process.
| What wo will do will depend on
the facts of the record and what
the student wants us to do."
Professor Jack Friedenthal of
the Stanford Law School said,
"The University's position is all
| right legally. There was a clear
i act for which ho is being pun
| ished. The issue of who shall de
eide the punishment and by what
channels is one of policy and not
| legality.
"But if the follow never had a
chance to present his ease, or it
was done in a way which was
detrimental to him, then that is
' both unfair and illegal."
