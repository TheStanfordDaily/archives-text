# FOSTER PARENTS' PLAN
## Arnold Air Society Adopts Chinese Orphan 
### 
Chan Doun, a fatherless nine-year-old boy liv
ing in Hong Kong, has recently acquired fifteen
foster fathers, and fifteen foster mothers in addi
tion to his own female parent.
Doun's new folks are members of the Arnold
Air Society, cadets selected for academic and lead
ership abilities, and members of "The Princess
Flight," ;i group of Stanford women who usher
at ROTC functions and generally build morale.
DOL'N IS ONK of 76.000 children of 27 coun
tries who has been financially "adopted" through
the Foster Parents' Plan, an organization with
headquarters in New York City.
In addition to their stateside headquarters.
PLAN has centers in Italy, Greece, Korea, Hong
Kong, Vietnam, the Philippine Islands, Colombia,
and Ecuador which discover needy children and
provide them with on-the-spot guidance and coun
selling.
Once enrolled, a foster child remains under
PLAN care until he reaches maturity or indepen
dence. Contributions by donors not wishing to be
come parents provides the General Fund which
helps support and counsel the children who have

not been adopted.
Till-; ADOPTION through PLAN is financial
not legal. The foster parents are obliged to send
$13 each month for at least ;i year to help the for
eign child.
In Doun's case, this seemingly tiny sum lias
given the boy a new hope. I lis father disappeared
while working on a ship in the summer of 1961.
Since then, Doun's mother has supported the fam
ily of four with a steadx job in a plastic factory
and sewing in the evenings at home, all of which
supplies $33.35 a month.
Their "home" is double bedspace in the hallway
of a concrete house for which they pay $7.02. Doun
and his younger brothers must pay $1.00 a month
for their education. Outside help of the sort the
Arnold Society and PLAN are giving them is
much appreciated.
HIT PLAN care is more than just a cash
grant of $!S and clothing supplies and medical care.
Important as the material aid is, Doun needs the
warmth of friendship to assure him of a brighter
and more secure future.
PLAN's foster children are more than just

numbers. The foster parents receive a photograph
of the boy or girl they are helping, as well as Id -
i(>rs, the original and a translated copy. The par
rents, in turn, are asked to send their "adopted"
child letters of their own. These also, perhaps
even more than the clothing and medicine, are
much appreciated. When Dr. Meredith M. Hogue
of Milwaukee visited the Korean Foster Child
given him by his congregation to celebrate the
23th anniversary of his pastorate, he found that
his letters had been soiled and tattered from con
stant rereading. He wrote, "1 was especially
pleased with the attitude of the Foster Parents'
social worker her relation to the child andher
family and her cordiality to me. We were not
just numbers to her . .
Being a foster parent, like being a real parent,
is not just a for-a-timc proposition. The child's
gratitude continues long after he has gene out on
his own when PLAN'S care ends. Letters to "Dear
Foster Parent" continue to come, telling the Amer
ican couple about the marvelous help they have
provided. Gills like these are not easily hist or
i'nrirot ten.
