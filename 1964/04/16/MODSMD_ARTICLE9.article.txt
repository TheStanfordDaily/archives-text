# Bicyclists Organize For Safety
## 
### 
An informal group of bicyclists
in Palo Alto has organized to
work toward their own and pe
destrians' greater safetv. It is
called SAFE.
Mrs. Molly Coot/, SAFE'S
prcsi d en t , summarized th o
group's objectives. She said that
there are several interests her
organization is trying to protect.
The safety of bike-riding school
children is the most important of
these, but the committee is also
working for the members of cycl
ing clubs as well as bicycle com
muters.
THE SEQUOIA District School
j Board recently sent a letter to all
[parents strongly advising them
I to forbid their sons and daughters
i to ride bicycles to school, Mrs.
Gootz felt that this is a situation
which should be corrected. Many
parents would rather see their
children ride bicycles to school
than ride buses, and they fool
adequate measures, such as paths
over busy streets or highways
and sidelanes, should be intro
duced.
SAFE has already brought a
specific request into the City
Council agenda, concerning this.
The Yacht Harbor and Foothill
1 Park both lie beyond the Bay
shore Freeway, and ma ny
: mothers are frankly tired of driv
; ing their children to these places.
I The organization has proposed
that a now foot-and-bicyclo
; bridge be built across the Free
way in order that the children
could go across alone. The pro
posal will bo discussed and voted
upon on May 4 or 18.
Members of cycling clubs, who
| make trips of up to seventy miles
ion their ten-speed bicycles, have
i entirely different problems. The
j increased traffic in the Palo Alto
area, however, affects the more
I serious cyclists, too.
SAFE is interested in men and
women who commute by bicycle
to work, as well as in the "Sun
day drivers." Mr. Alan Grund
man of the Physics Department
ia! Stanford (who bikes to the
| tank himself) is making a survey
of students and professors w ho
j comnumtc from off-campus by
| cycle. He is seeking information
i for SAFE on numbers, so that the
; group can give its case statistical
I significance when it is presented
. to the City Council. Ho urges the
affected people to leave the re
quested information in his name
i at extension 4345.

An informal group of bicyclists
in Palo Alto has organized to
work toward their own and pe
destrians' greater safetv. It is
called SAFE.
Mrs. Molly Coot/, SAFE'S
prcsi d en t , summarized th o
group's objectives. She said that
there are several interests her
organization is trying to protect.
The safety of bike-riding school
children is the most important of
these, but the committee is also
working for the members of cycl
ing clubs as well as bicycle com
muters.
THE SEQUOIA District School
j Board recently sent a letter to all
[parents strongly advising them
I to forbid their sons and daughters
i to ride bicycles to school, Mrs.
Gootz felt that this is a situation
which should be corrected. Many
parents would rather see their
children ride bicycles to school
than ride buses, and they fool
adequate measures, such as paths
over busy streets or highways
and sidelanes, should be intro
duced.
SAFE has already brought a
specific request into the City
Council agenda, concerning this.
