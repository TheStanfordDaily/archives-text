Come As You Are
"... Father, I have sinned . . . and am no more worthy to be called
I I thy son. But the father said . . . Bring forth the best robe ..." Luke 15,
21, 22.
The prodigal son was dressed in rags and tatters when he decided to return
to his father s house and ask for forgiveness for all that he had done. He did
not stop to clean up, shave or buy a new suit. He did not make excuses or
alibis. Rather, he came as he was and said "Father I have sinned."
Now all mankind has sinned in the eyes of a righteous and holy God. "All
have sinned and come short of the glory of God." "There is none righteous,
no not one." However, providentially for mankind, a merciful and gracious
God sent His Son Jesus Christ to Earth 2000 years ago so that sinful man could
| be reconciled to God. All that God asks is that we "come as we are" —
miserable sinners—and accept His free gift of salvation which is made possible
I through the sacrifice of His Son Jesus Christ.
I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniqiuty have I not hid. I
I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the
I iniquity of my sin." Psalm 32:5.
"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt be-
I lieve in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou salt be
I saved." Rom. 1 0:9.
Aren't we thankful that God does not require that we work our way to
heaven and salvation? Were God to accept the sinner on his own merit and
righteousness, none of us could be saved.
He hath not dealth with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to
our iniquities. Psalm 103:10.
"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his
mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
Ghost; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour."
Titus 3:5, 6.
If you are not a Christian and do not know the peace and joy of real
fellowship with God, why not humble yourself before God today? He does not
require that you take a bath, dress up pretty, or earn His favor by good works;
He merely wants you to COME AS YOU ARE" in humility and sincerity and
I accept His provision to become a child of God.
