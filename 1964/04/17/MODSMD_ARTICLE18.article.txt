### 
Stanford's tennis team gets a
chance this weekend to revenge
j itself for the pair of (i-3 defeats
hung on ii two weeks ago in Los
Angeles by USC and UCLA.
This afternoon at one o'clock,
coach Rob Renker's team takes
the court against the defending
national champions from the Uni
versity of Southern California.
LFD BY DAVIS Cup star Den
nis Ralston. Troy has swept all
its dual meets this spring with
the exception of the UCLA con
test. Jim Beste, Stanford's first
singles player, will meet Ralston.
SC's second man, Bill Bond, an
other Ail-American, will be op
posed by Jerry ITurst. Ralston and
Bond will also play first doubles
against Beste and Hurst in the
second of the day's featured con
test s.
UCLA, currently rated number
one in the nation due to its eon
quest of Troy, will invade 1 h e
Farm on Saturday afternoon at
one.
LKD BY ARTHUR Ashe, the
first Negro Davis Cupper ever
to play for the United States, the
Bruins have yel to lose. No slouch
either is the second Bruin,
Charles Pasaroll.
Currently the fifth-rated men's
player in the United Slates, ac
cording to World Tennis maga
zine, the most authoritative ten
nis journal, Paserell is the best
player ever to come out of Puerto
Rico.
In the meet between SC and
UCLA last week, which the latter
won, 5-4, Ralston beat Ashe and
teamed with Chuck Rambeau to
flown him and Pasarell in the first

! doubles.
STANFORD'S BKSTR, who
must face both Ralston and Ashe,
is faiily convinced thai Jie will
be able at least to give the latter
a better match than he did lasl
time.
In the first UCLA meet, Beste
was bested 6-0, 6-4. The sopho
more from Raton Rouge believes
| his improvement in the second
set against Ashe indicates that he
j will be able eventually to beat
the big Negro, and possibly will
be able to handle him this week
-1 end. Bostc's loss to Ashe in L.A.
came in the first match the two
had ever contested.
Stanford's tennis fortunes have
been on Ihe rebound since the
twin losses down South. Last
i weekend, the Tribe downed Cal
I by a 5-4 count, and then came
j back on Wednesday to whip
I neighboring San Jose State by
j Ihe same score.
j Admission will be charged for
both matches. The general pub
j lie will be admitted for a dollar,
and students for 50 cents.
