# JUSTICE DONE?
## Professors Voice Doubts About Morse Suspension 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Staff Editor 
Doubts ami concern about the suspension of Frank P. Morse
were expressed yesterday by faculty members wlio attended the
Tuesday hearings.
But there was no change in the status of the ease. Dean of Stu
dents 11. Donald \\ inbigler, w ho overruled the judicial council of

Stanford in Italy and ordered
Morse's suspension for punching
out the panel of a door at the
Italy campus, said only that
Morse was not suspended for
"'psychological reasons."
EDWIN M. GOOD, associate
professor of religion, told The
Daily that the most important
issue raised by the hearings is
whether Morse has been told the
whole reason for his suspension.
The question of whether there is
.justification for the suspension,
(Jood said, cannot be decided until
this issue is settled.
"We need to hear the other side
of the case," Good continued, "but
until the dean tells us something
to the contrary, Morse is right,
and one has to assume that t tie
suspension was unjustified."
Gooci said he could not under
stand why more lias not been said
about the reasons for the suspen
sion. "Is the dean trying to pro
tect Morse? II so, he has said

nothing about it. And apparently
Morse does not want to be pro
tected."
CHARLES DKEK3I E I E R ,
assistant professor of political
science, raised the same issue:
"I find it difficult to understand
why an offense of this nature
should be punished so severely;
there does not appear to be a
clear precedent for such action."
Referring to the issue of judi
cial authority raised by t he Morse
hearings, Drekmeier said that al
though he was not well acquaint
ed with the procedural aspects of
the case, he suspected "that the
Dean has not exceeded his auth
ority in this respect."
Drekmeier expressed concern
about the vagueness of the "psy
chological" factor in Morse's sus
pension. "The alleged 'personality
problems' of Mr. Morse," stated
Drekmeier, "are a matter for the
professionally competent to deter
mine.
THE VAGUENESS of such ex
pressions makes them particular
ly dangerous. They sound as
though t hey explain much when
in fact they say nothing."
Drekmeier concluded, "Until
more information is available,
many of us must wonder if they
has been complete justice here."
He expressed his belief that
"those who invoke the principles
that justify academic protection
must also insist that proper pro
tection be extended to students.
Attendance at Stanford is no
privilege without rights."
Assistant Chaplain John A.
Tirrell, impressed by the "great
number" of students present at
the trial, said, "It is apparent that
the solution of this problem is
of tremendous concern not just
with regard to the Frank Morse
case, but also as an assurance of
a better understanding between
the students and the administra
tion in all areas of University
life."
Most of those faculty members
who attended the trial expressed
satisfaction at the way it was
handled.
