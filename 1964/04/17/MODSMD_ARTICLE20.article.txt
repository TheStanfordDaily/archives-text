# Cindermen In Breather Vs. Bruins
## 
### TOM ELIAS 
Stanford's track team gets what
seems like a breather when it
takes on UCLA tomorrow morn
ing on the Stanford Stadium oval.
Starting time has been moved up
to 10:30 a.m. so Ihat the meet
will not conflict with Cal's meet
against Washington, also sched
uled for tomorrow.
Although Payton Jordan, true
to Ihe coach's creed, refuses to
say so, the meet looks like a
romp for Ihe Cards. So much of
a romp, in fact, that the Daily
scratch sheet lists the likely score
at 100-45 for Stanford. Jordan, the
Tribe mentor, told the Daily yes
terday "I've lost too many to take
anything for granted. And UCLA
has some real outstanding per
formers, too."
THK BRUINS do indeed have
a few good men on their team,
but none to match the C. K.
Yangs and Rafer Johnsons thai
have marked Ducky Drake's
teams in the past few years.
Unfortunate for the Bruins,
also, is ihe fact that in every
case, Stanford also has good men
in the events where UCLA's will
compete. This will make for a few
good events, but not for a bal
anced score in the meet.
Probably ihe best man on the
UCLA team is javelin thrower
Hermann Spegel, a 231 foot man.
Bill Stanford has Cieorge Porter,
225, in this event, so Spegel will
definitely be threatened. At the
very least, the Tribe can expect
to pull 1 points out of the event
with second and third.
NK\T MOST dangerous man
on the Bruins is miler Bob Day,
a 1:07.4 man. But here Stanford
has Paul Schlieke, owner of the
best outdoor collegiate time of the
season. Should Day pull an upset,
Stanford could still expect to get
four points of this event, too.
So it goes all through the entry
list. Where UCLA is strong, so is
Stanford, and where the Tribe is
weak, the Bruins are weaker.
