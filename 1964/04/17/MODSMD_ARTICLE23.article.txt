# Attendance At This University Does Bring Rights
## 
### 
Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler
has declared the case of Frank Morse closed.
This is his right.
But there are issues that have been raised
by this case that must be fully discussed.
THE RELATION between the student
and the University is painfully clear. Present
policy states: Attendenee at tin's University
is a privilege and not a right.
This policy is unacceptable.
Rather, we believe, that entrance to the
University is a privilege, but that after ma
triculation certain rights accrue to the individ
ual student.
The basic tenet of the present University
policy is that the student comes to the Uni
versity simply to take and not to contribute.
He is here to learn and that is a privilege.
WE CANNOT ACCEPT this view. Any
student who has put several thousand dol
lars, four or more years of his life and a quan
tity of effort into the pursuit of a college edu
cation, must be guaranteed that he shall have
certain rights. What is done by him, and more
importantly, what is done to him, will have
a great effect on his future.
The University administration has clari
fied its policy, to a degree, stating that con
tinued attendenee shall be predicated upon
the adequacy of the academic work under
taken and the conduct of the individual stu
dent. The conduct of the student is to be
judged on the basis of the Fundamental

Standard.
Sadly, the Fundamental Standard itself is
of such an ambiguous and general nature as
to leave the future of the student open to the
arbitrary and capricious will of persons in
authority. If that person is the dean of stu
dents or some other important University offi
cial, the channels of appeal are practically
closed.
WE DO NOT DENY the right of the
deans of the University to act as they deem
necessary; any other stand would be patently
stupid. Yet there was a degree of arbitrary
action in the Morse case that is still unex
plained.
Dean Robert Wert has announced that a
complete re-evaluation of the whole system
will be made by a faculty-student committee,
to be appointed shortly. We congratulate the
University for taking this much-needed step.
It is our hope that such an examination
might produce a workable arrangement, yet
one in which the rights of all involved, as well
as the responsibilities of the University offi
cials and students, could be asured. We are
asking, in short, for a student Bill of Rights.
