On the front pages of both The Chronicle
and 'The Examiner appeared articles "report
ing" on The Daily editorial of last Friday
("The Stanford Parent-Away-From-llome
Syndrome"). The Chronicle piece was head
lined, "Stanford Fuss over Sex"; The Exami
ner, " 'S' Is for Sin at Stanford."
And, as usual, both papers followed their
well-earned reputation of digging up the sor
did and completely glossing over anything
beyond the second dimension.
Consequently, we were advocating sin
naturally—when we questioned the right ol
the University to expel students for having
affairs.
The Chronicle even wrote that 'The Stau
forcl Daily said yesterday that 'many' students
at the University engage in sexual intercourse
before marriage"—when, in fact, we merely
cited national, not Stanford, surveys that indi
cate a large percentage of college students
have had intercourse. (We never said "many
Stanford students, as quoted by The Chron
icle. )
We only asked editorially: "If this is so,
shouldn't the University face up to reality?"
The Chronicle then took a ({notation we
ran made by a student ("The excellence of

Stanford is not proportional to the number of
virgins on campus.") and twisted it so com
pletely out of context that it appeared as if
the student were saying the excellence of
Stanford is proportional to the number of stu
dents who are unchaste.
Both The Chronicle and The Examiner,
true to form, reported that the editorial ap
peared on the front page Wednesday. The
editorial appeared in its regular position on
this page—and on last Friday.
We could go on, ad nauseam, with the
irresponsibility of the articles.
But underlying all this is something that
bothers us much more. And that is the appall
ing mentality that governs such news play in
these surrogate "newspapers.
During the past year San Francisco front
page coverage on Stanford student activities
has been limited to such flamboyant cases as
the suspension of ZetaPsi and the band strike.
There has been practically no coverage
of the truly important, profound events on
this campus—such as the religion issue, the
Mississippi civil right effort and the East Palo
Alto and Ravenswood tutoring program.
Where is the sense of responsibility of
that great, oldtimc San Francisco journalist,
Fremont Older?
Surely he would shudder painfully il lie
were alive today to see the journalistic pyg
mies who have inherited his S;in Francisco
newspaper world.

We only asked editorially: "If this is so,
shouldn't the University face up to reality?"
The Chronicle then took a ({notation we
ran made by a student ("The excellence of

Stanford is not proportional to the number of
virgins on campus.") and twisted it so com
pletely out of context that it appeared as if
the student were saying the excellence of
Stanford is proportional to the number of stu
dents who are unchaste.
Both The Chronicle and The Examiner,
true to form, reported that the editorial ap
peared on the front page Wednesday. The
editorial appeared in its regular position on
this page—and on last Friday.
We could go on, ad nauseam, with the
irresponsibility of the articles.
But underlying all this is something that
bothers us much more. And that is the appall
ing mentality that governs such news play in
these surrogate "newspapers.
During the past year San Francisco front
page coverage on Stanford student activities
has been limited to such flamboyant cases as
the suspension of ZetaPsi and the band strike.
There has been practically no coverage
of the truly important, profound events on
this campus—such as the religion issue, the
Mississippi civil right effort and the East Palo
Alto and Ravenswood tutoring program.
Where is the sense of responsibility of
that great, oldtimc San Francisco journalist,
Fremont Older?
Surely he would shudder painfully il lie
were alive today to see the journalistic pyg
mies who have inherited his S;in Francisco
newspaper world.
On the front pages of both The Chronicle
and 'The Examiner appeared articles "report
ing" on The Daily editorial of last Friday
("The Stanford Parent-Away-From-llome
Syndrome"). The Chronicle piece was head
lined, "Stanford Fuss over Sex"; The Exami
ner, " 'S' Is for Sin at Stanford."
And, as usual, both papers followed their
well-earned reputation of digging up the sor
did and completely glossing over anything
beyond the second dimension.
Consequently, we were advocating sin
naturally—when we questioned the right ol
the University to expel students for having
affairs.
The Chronicle even wrote that 'The Stau
forcl Daily said yesterday that 'many' students
at the University engage in sexual intercourse
before marriage"—when, in fact, we merely
cited national, not Stanford, surveys that indi
cate a large percentage of college students
have had intercourse. (We never said "many
