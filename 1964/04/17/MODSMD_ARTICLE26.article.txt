Yesterday's San Francisco Examiner article
quoted a "University spokesman" whose pro
found utterances provide the best argument
for our position we have seen so far:
"'The administration makes no attempt to
enforce its morality on students. Besides, the
editorial had it all wrong. There was an inci
dent last year involving a girl student. Her
grades went down, down, and she w as eventu
ally suspended, for general academic defi
ciency.' "
[On lite contrary, the ease we cited in
last Friday's editorial teas true: A graduate
student was expelled last year for having an
affair with a girl. It is now painfully evident,
however, that there was another similar ease,
and we thank the spokesman for providing
ns with this information.]
". . . the spokesman said . . . at heart
the administration is really against sin as well
as had grades. Its just that sin and good
grades don't go together. Hardly ever, any
way. . . .
"'All students, the University spokesman
said, 'must conform to standards which are
the explicit expression of the unwritten ethical
conscience of the Stanford community. '
How does it go, now? Give them enough
rope, and they w ill hang themselves.
