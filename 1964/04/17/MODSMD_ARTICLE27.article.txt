## Can Lax Woodside Demand Stringent Standards Of AEC? 
### Dr. Wolfgang Panofsky Director Stanford Linear Accelerator Center 
KIHTOK'S NOTh: This edi
torial was prepared for radio
station KCBS in rebuttal to the
station's editorial on SLAC
power lines.
From t lit? start of planning of
the laboratory, aesthetic consid
erations have always played a
major part. The first money spent
on the site was for protection of
our native trees". An eminent
architect and planner was hired
to preserve the local atmosphere
and the existing vegetation. Our
extensive landscaping program
is designed to screen unsightly
apparatus.
Actually, the Linear Accelera
tor Center and Stanford Univer
sity have assumed leadership in
placing utilities underground. At
considerable expense, many miles
of utility lines are already buried.
AEC support for these measures
was obtained because Stanford
itself and the more progressive
communities in the immediate
area place such circuits under
ground.
THE NEIGHBORING City of
Woodside is the principal oppo
nent of overhead lines to the proj
ect. Woodside has not buried any
of its own electrical utilities. In
fairness, however, it should be
said that Woodside is a new city,
and inherited about 1,400 power
poles and 60 miles of overhead
lines when it incorporated. Since
its incorporation, however, it has
added about 250 poles. Even since
the current protests began, Wood
side has added 25 poles for over
head distribution of power. These
poles range in height from 45
to 75 feet. By comparison, 1 h e
painted tubular steel poles pro
posed by PG&E will average 70
feet in height.
Installation of the transmission
line to the Accelerator would in
volve 34 poles in all — 24 of them
on Stanford property. Th ere
would be only five of t ho poles
in Woodside — and three of these
would be on Stanford land. These
figures indicate that the issue,
whatever its merit, has been ex
aggerated. Words like "desecra
tion" and "rape of the landscape"
make good and exciting reading,
but they are hardly related to this

situation.
The region in question is par
tially wooded, beautiful hilly
countryside, but it is already
zoned for subdivision. Therefore,
this is not a situation in which
one can say that "works of man"
are evil in themselves. What
should be called for is good de
sign. The new pole is actually a
tremendous improvement over
the towers which previously have
carried equally high-voltage cir
cuits.
I believe that in the future an
increasing number of utilities
must be placed out of sight. The
economic value our citizens arc
willing to place on aesthetics
must increase. But oven this ar
gument makes a very weak case
for placing 220,000-volt lines un
derground. This would cost about
$400,000 a mile.
It costs only $30,000 to bury
this same mileage of the low
voltage circuits now strung on
wooden poles, which infest the
countryside. Therefore, investing
anyone's money in underground
ing the most expensive circuits
first is a poor bargain indeed.
TIIIO CRUCIAL public question
is: "Can the Federal Government
be forced by local jurisdiction to
adopt standards which are very
much moi-e stringent and costly
than the local powers demand of
themselves?"
The government could choose
to initiate a major national effort
on undergrounding high-voltage
power lines: a program which
would involve hundreds of mil
lions of dollars. However, such
a program must be preceded by a
lengthy engineering effort to re
duce the cost of underground con
struction, so that such tax ex
penditures would be most effec
tively spent.
But Congress has not author
ized any agency of government,
such as AEC, to pioneer such a
program. Considering the facts
presented, and the imperative
need of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator for power, I believe the
tubular steel pole line to be a
reasonable solution. It would be,
in fact, a step toward much
needed improvement in power
transmission practice.

TIIIO CRUCIAL public question
is: "Can the Federal Government
be forced by local jurisdiction to
adopt standards which are very
much moi-e stringent and costly
than the local powers demand of
themselves?"
The government could choose
to initiate a major national effort
on undergrounding high-voltage
power lines: a program which
would involve hundreds of mil
lions of dollars. However, such
a program must be preceded by a
lengthy engineering effort to re
duce the cost of underground con
struction, so that such tax ex
penditures would be most effec
tively spent.
But Congress has not author
ized any agency of government,
such as AEC, to pioneer such a
program. Considering the facts
presented, and the imperative
need of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator for power, I believe the
tubular steel pole line to be a
reasonable solution. It would be,
in fact, a step toward much
needed improvement in power
transmission practice.

From t lit? start of planning of

THE NEIGHBORING City of
Woodside is the principal oppo
nent of overhead lines to the proj
ect. Woodside has not buried any
of its own electrical utilities. In
fairness, however, it should be
said that Woodside is a new city,
and inherited about 1,400 power
poles and 60 miles of overhead
lines when it incorporated. Since
its incorporation, however, it has
added about 250 poles. Even since
the current protests began, Wood
side has added 25 poles for over
head distribution of power. These
poles range in height from 45
to 75 feet. By comparison, 1 h e
painted tubular steel poles pro
posed by PG&E will average 70
feet in height.
Installation of the transmission
line to the Accelerator would in
volve 34 poles in all — 24 of them
on Stanford property. Th ere
would be only five of t ho poles
in Woodside — and three of these
would be on Stanford land. These
figures indicate that the issue,
whatever its merit, has been ex
aggerated. Words like "desecra
tion" and "rape of the landscape"
make good and exciting reading,
but they are hardly related to this

situation.
The region in question is par
tially wooded, beautiful hilly
countryside, but it is already
zoned for subdivision. Therefore,
this is not a situation in which
one can say that "works of man"
are evil in themselves. What
should be called for is good de
sign. The new pole is actually a
tremendous improvement over
the towers which previously have
carried equally high-voltage cir
cuits.
I believe that in the future an
increasing number of utilities
must be placed out of sight. The
economic value our citizens arc
willing to place on aesthetics
must increase. But oven this ar
gument makes a very weak case
for placing 220,000-volt lines un
derground. This would cost about
$400,000 a mile.
It costs only $30,000 to bury
this same mileage of the low
voltage circuits now strung on
wooden poles, which infest the
countryside. Therefore, investing
anyone's money in underground
ing the most expensive circuits
first is a poor bargain indeed.
