# Virgin Quote Refers To Academic Excellence

Editor, The Daily:
A recent statement quoted in
Daily editorial of April 10, has
been quoted, out of context,
in a number of Bay Area pap
ers. I would not wish to in
sinuate that they did this with
malice; it. may be that they
just do not know better. The
context of the article should
make it very clear that I meant
'academic' excellence and not
the general excellence of Stan
ford when I said: "The exel
lence of Stanford is not pro
portional to the number of s ir
gins on campus." The point of
the article was to set forth pos
sible justifications for suspend
ing a student who has violated
(he Administration Command
ment: "Thous shalt not engage
in pre-marital sexual inter
course.'' The editorial sa i d
that someone might say: we
can suspend such a 'sinner' in
order to make Standford a bet
ter academic institution. My
response to this is that anyone
who has this belief has some
peculiar insight that is no t
justifiable on any empirical
basis. It seems ludicrous to be
lieve that a student's academic
standing is necessarily related
to his chastity. There are, for
example, some people who sin
quite regularly and still get

good grades. On the other
hand, there are people who do
not 'sin' who get good grades
also. Chastity then is not
necessarily related to good or
bad grades in any way - and
neither is non-chastity.
I would like, also, to apolo
gize to the Judicial Council for
a ny embarrassment caused
them by the mistake which
added that 1 was a member of
Judicial Council. I spoke as a
student and not as someone
with any additional responsi
bility.

• Judicial Council
Editor, The Daily:
After the open hearing of
Frank Morse on Tuesday, 1
was impressed by the dignity
of the proceedings and by the
restraint with which all mem
bers of the Judicial Council,
the defendants, and witnesses
conducted Ihemselves. As the
issues spoke for themselves, so
also the calm behavior of those
who were involved spoke of
their concern for those issues.

Members of Judicial Coun
cil arc, of course, responsible
only to facts, not factions
the commitment to justice
must always stand above less
equitable commitments. Judi
cial Council has shown itself
to be concerned with this re
sponsibility to weigh issues
rather than interests.
Judicial Council seems also
to be concerned with the mat
ter of communication. In this
university community, no ob
stacle to understanding is
greater than the barriers
which stand between Adminis
tration, faculty, and students.
More than anything else,
Frank Morse is the victim of
lapses in communication. Judi
cial Council is the advocate
more of open communication
than of Frank Morse, more of
justice than of faction. But
Judicial Council is embattled
by bureaucracy.
Stanford in indeed a "pri
vate" university, but if the
most dignified institutions of
our students are really a sham,
then this community and th e
world at large should at least
recognize that the winds of
freedom that blow about this
campus blow nobody good.
