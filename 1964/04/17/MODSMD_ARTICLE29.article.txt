## 'Rosmersholm' Transitional, Can't Decide What To Stress 
### John Thayer 
Installed at the Little Theatre
and confidently flying a new ban
ner the Stanford Players have
dug up and presented, unfortun
ately without dusting, Ibsen's
Rosinersliolm, whose ingredients
are as follows: one part social
drama, one part melodrama, and
one part psychological drama,
making a grand total of four or
five parts bewilderment and at
least two more of banality.
ROSMKRSHOLM is a transi
tional play and as such suffers
from one overweening flaw: it
can't make up its mind what it is
or what it's talking about.
The plot line in incredibly com
plex. It concerns an eternal tri
angle, one of whose sides is dead
when the curtain rises, the other
two dying together before the
curtain falls.
Tin; SOCIAL DRAMA s e em s
clearly to be subordinate to the
psychological drama; yet psychol
ogy all too often is conquered by
the ugly head of pathetic melo
drama. The result is excruciating
self-questioning and vitriolic so
cial comment in some parts of Ihe
play, but a serious damaging of
others and of the play as a whole
by sickly sentimentality.
The blame for this lies partly
with Ibsen for writing such an
ambiguous piece. However, he
suffers somewhat at the hands
of the actors and the director.
James Kerans, the director, was
apparently unable to decide what
he was dealing with; so he em
phasized all three of the play's
possibilities equally and allowed
the piece to procede at a slow
crawl in hopes that it would all
be clear to the audience.
The actors couldn't or wouldn't

make up their minds either, and
what emerges is often motiva
tional chaos. As Mr. Kroll, th e
upper-middle-class bigot, Jack
Fisher is neither dastardly
enough nor sufficiently arrogant
to be totally convincing.
LINDA BISHOP has the dig
nity of Rebeka West, the loved
one. but she lacks the depth and
the strength of will for which
her part cries out. She has made
an icy exterior cover hollowness.
Richard Risso has solved the
problem of John Rosmer, the wid
ower and platonic lover, no better
than the others; he wavers be
tween being a number of things,
some violently incompatible,
others merely confusing.
On the brighter side. Muriel
Rice as the servant (Mrs. Hal
soth) moves through her part
with the impressive dignity. Both
Mark Hammer (Peter Mortens
gard) and Stan Weese (who as
Ulric Brendel adds a few desper
ately-needed comic scienes to the
goings-on), come to terms with
their parts, although with some
what less success than Miss Rice.
Technically speaking, congratu
lations must go to Judith Bur
gess for Rebeka's marvelous
dresses, and to Wendell Cole for
the set, which threatens to make
Victorian beautiful, no mean feat
with so little to work on. These
and Mrs. Halseth, Mortensgard,
and Brendel make the evening
as enjoyable as il is, though the
battle with must and boredom
is a losing one. But, Ibsen is not
to be missed under any circum
stances, and so seeing Rosmer
sholm is worth all the intestinal
fortitude which the current off
ering demands.
