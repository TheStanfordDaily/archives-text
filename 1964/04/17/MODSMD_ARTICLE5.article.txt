A DEMONSTRATOR MODEL of the 70-foot tubular steel pole pro
posed to bring high voltage (220 KV) power overhead to the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) is examined by Lawrence
Mohr, Palo Alto manager of the Atomic Energy Commission, and
Herman Halperin, power transmission engineer who designed the
pole and suggested its use while a SLAC consultant. Installed by
the Pacific Gas & Electric Company, the pole is 50 feet shorter in
average height than conventional four-legged power towers. It
would be used in a majority of the 34 installations required to
bring power from PG&E's Monte Vistci-Jefferson line to SLAC.
Twenty-four of the. installations would be on Stanford land (part
of which lies in Woodside), eight in San Mateo County, and two
in Woodside off Stanford property.
