On most college campuses when spring comes
a young man's fancy turns to love. But not at
Stanford. The last throe nights the Wilbur fresh
men have waged some of the wettest water fights
that the campus has seen ill quite a while.
The warm evenings have provided the impetus
that the frosh need for their high-jinx. The cur
rent series of aqueous insurrections began Mon
day night with limited combat between the W il
bur houses.

horizons with an all out attack on Stern. Activi
ties reached fever pitch Wednesday evening when
a SternWilbur water fight drifted over to Bran

Nearly 500 shouting Stanford men released
their pent up emotions in a battle that lasted for
three hours. For the tii i hour the Stern and
Wilbur men drenched each othei on tlv li'Md I"'

was hurt.
The fro.sh have advanced the state of technology
with such water dispursing devises as surgical
tubing, plastic bags and fire extinguishers. One
house in Wilbur is reported to be giving medals for
such meritorious deeds as drenching officers and
tossing water balloons under the nose of sponsors.
In one humorous incident several policemen
were doused when a student claiming that he had
lost his contact lens had the good natured officers
down on their hands and knees searching for the
lens. The officers found themselves in the midst
of a barrage of water balloons, and the student
who "lost" his lens disappeared.
