# By-Laws Committee Deadlocked On Rush
## Fraternities, Eating Clubs Fear Loss Of Control, Request Smaller Board 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
I lie By-laws committer of LASSU failed to roach any decision
yesterdax in its hearing on the proposed rush committee. Another
meeting w ill he held next Tuesday, according to the committee
chairman Uurkc Hurright.
I he proposal the By-laws committee is discussing calls for a

! five-man committee consisting of"
the ICC, IFC, and IHC Presi
dents, the head Wilbur sponsor,
i and a LASSU member to review
rush policy. This committee
would then make a report to the
Legislature which could either
approve the policy, or reject the
report, sending it back to the
committee with recommenda
tions. Final authority for ap
proval of the policy would rest
with the Dean of Students.
Till; DIFFICULTY that the
By-laws committee has had with
the proposal is the reluctance of
| some fraternity and club mem-j
bet s to have any of the power of j
| determining rush policy given to
! people who they feel are not fully
aware of the particular problems
i of rush.
The By-laws committee is at
tempting to resolve this problem
j in t wo areas, the power of LASSU
! whose membership to a large ex
i tent, is not directly affected by
i rush, to determine rush policy,
j "and the makeup of the rush..."
committee itself.
One s u g g e s t e d amendment
made to the committee by Lind
sey Kalal, president of El Toro,
would be to have the IFC and
ICC make separate proposals to
LASSU, which could reject those
proposed rush policies by a three
: fourths vote.
KALAL'S PROPOSAL would,
j in essence, allow the fraternities
and eating clubs to make their
| won policies.
Paul Strasburg, head Wilbur
sponsor, told the committee, how
lever. that the idea that eating
j clubs and fraternities could sepa
i lately draw up rush policies had
j been dropped two years ago be
j cause of the feeling that rush
I was "a matter that concerned all
! of the campus."
Strasburg also told the com
jmiltee that separate rush policies
{tended to confuse freshmen, and
I create animosity among the fra
; ternities, eating clubs, and inde
| pendent houses who are all in
'competition for freshmen.
ON'K PROPOSED compromise
on committee membership was
[made by By-laws members Bob
i Curry. He suggested that the
j ASSLJ member on the proposed
rush committee be made a non
voting chairman, in'order to pre
vent the committee, by a 3-2 vote.

presenting a rush policy that both
the IFC and ICC presidents would
be opposed to.
Strasburg. a member of the
current ad hoc committee work
ing on rush policy also said that
reducing the committee to four
voting members would help
create "a spirit of compromise"
such as the current committee
has operated under.
Ed Shaw, outgoing student fi
| nancial manager, gave the opin
| ion that Legislative approval is
| necessary for any rush policy. He
said that Ihc student judicial
(councils could not enforce any
j policy that the Legislature has
rejected, even if such policy was
jmade university policy. This
would mean that the judicial
I councils could not try a living
i group for any infraction of rush
{procedure that the Legislature re
jects.
