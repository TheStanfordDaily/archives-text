Sin Is Deeper
Than You Think
I
Sins are commonly thought to bo specific misdeeds like lying, stealing,
cheating, fornication, or diunkenness which should be avoided and which
can be overcome with a little will power. While it is correct to speak of
specific deeds as sinful, these actions are merely a surface manifestation of
a much deeper disorder—the depraved nature of man. To sin is to live inde
pendently from God. That which is done apart from God, regardless of how
innocent or harmless it may seem, is sin.
"For whatsoever is not of faith is sin." (Rom. 14.23)
Only those who know Jesus Christ and have His Holy Spirit can live a
| life free from the power of sin. The unregenerate man is helpless to over
come sin and by nature is in enemy of God.
"... The mind set on the flesh is hostile towards God; for it does not
subject itself to the Law of God, for it is not even able to do so; and those
who are in the flesh cannot please God. However, you are not in the flesh
but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone
does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him. And if Christ
is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive
because of righteousness." Rom. 8:7-10
The Holy Spirit convinces individuals that they are sinful, that their lives
without Christ are empty. They are then in a position to accept the salvation
which Jesus Christ offers.
Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body
of sin might bo destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he
that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe
that we shall also live with him." Rom. 6: 6, 7, 8.
A life lived in sin without Christ may provide "pleasure for a season,"
but leads inevitably to misery, sorrow, and grief for an individual. Sin, like
a cancer, eats away at families, societies and nations.
' Now the deeds of the flesh are evident which are: immorality, impurity,
sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger,
disputes, dissensions, factions, envyings, drunkenness, carousings, and things
like these, of which I forewarn you just as I have forewarned . . . Those
I who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit
of the (Holy) Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith-
I fulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. Now
| those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and
desires. If wo live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. Galatians
5:19-25.
Do you know Jesus Christ and the reason for His visit to this planet?
The apostle Paul testified: "It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full accep- I
tance, that Christ Jesus came info the world to save sinners, among whom
I am foremost of all. And yet for this reason I found mercy in order that
in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience,
cis an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life. Now I
to the King, eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory
forever and ever, Amen ' I Tim, 1:15-17.
