## Civil Rights Protest Successful 
### STEVE GRUBER Staff Writer 
SAN FRANCISCO A long-awaited victory was
finally won on Van Ness Avenue Saturday.
The Automobile Association of this city has agreed
to a list of demands by the NAACP.
"You have won a victory," announced Dr. Nathaniel
Burbridge to a sea of demons!rators crowded across Van
Ness.
A CHIIKK WENT UP but it seemed like a unani
mous sigh of relief by the 2,000 demonstrators, many ol'
whom had already spent lung hours in the two earlier
auto agency sit-ins and the Sheraton-Palace sit-in.
Stanford's contingent, totaling five students, took an
active part in the picketing. Stu Mcßae, a Peace Caucus
member, commented: "The Chrysler agency locked its

doors after the demonstration began. I don't know
what we would have done if the agreement hadn't been
signed and the NAACP decided to sit-in."
The other Stanford students involved were Warren
Phillips, Jim Klein, Larry Freudinger and Ron Kenyon.
Asked if they knew anything about the demonstra
tion, the salesmen at the Chevrolet and Cadillac agen
cies shrug' ;od their shoulders and pleaded ignorance.
The Daily's reporter and photographer were 'eventually
thrown out of the Cadillac agency for "not being mem
bers of the working press"—although they both carried
Daily press cards.
In the sea of signs proclaiming "Equality Now," and
"II Cadillac Won't Talk, Then We Will," there was a
lone dissenting sign. It was carried by Richard Ric
mann, a teacher at Altaloma Junior High School.
Riemann's sign claimed, "No One Owes Anyone Else
A Job." Riemann explained that he felt the current

demonstrations were an affront to initiative.
"Cuba is the logical result of this type of activity.
These demonstrations are based on a falacious economic
right—the right lo a job," said Riemann.
PERCY JONES, one of the leaders of the demon
stration, admitted that Jim Wessman Lincoln-Mercury
had been picketed by mistake a week ago. Jones waved
a friendly hello to ihe salesmen at Jim Wessman's as
he led a group of demonstrators to Ellis-Brooks Chev
rolet.
Wessman had been carrying on a training program
for minorities previous to the current demonstrations.
The crowd—gathered on Van Ness Avenue before
Burbridge's speech—sang "We Shall Overcome." They
also joined in a favorite cheer, "Jim Crow must go!"
About 90 per cent of the demonstrators were white.
A majority were students, but several elderly women
were seen in the picket lines.

A CHIIKK WENT UP but it seemed like a unani
mous sigh of relief by the 2,000 demonstrators, many ol'
whom had already spent lung hours in the two earlier
auto agency sit-ins and the Sheraton-Palace sit-in.
Stanford's contingent, totaling five students, took an
active part in the picketing. Stu Mcßae, a Peace Caucus
member, commented: "The Chrysler agency locked its

doors after the demonstration began. I don't know
what we would have done if the agreement hadn't been
signed and the NAACP decided to sit-in."
The other Stanford students involved were Warren
Phillips, Jim Klein, Larry Freudinger and Ron Kenyon.
Asked if they knew anything about the demonstra
tion, the salesmen at the Chevrolet and Cadillac agen
cies shrug' ;od their shoulders and pleaded ignorance.
The Daily's reporter and photographer were 'eventually
thrown out of the Cadillac agency for "not being mem
bers of the working press"—although they both carried
Daily press cards.
In the sea of signs proclaiming "Equality Now," and
"II Cadillac Won't Talk, Then We Will," there was a
lone dissenting sign. It was carried by Richard Ric
mann, a teacher at Altaloma Junior High School.
Riemann's sign claimed, "No One Owes Anyone Else
A Job." Riemann explained that he felt the current

demonstrations were an affront to initiative.
"Cuba is the logical result of this type of activity.
These demonstrations are based on a falacious economic
right—the right lo a job," said Riemann.
PERCY JONES, one of the leaders of the demon
stration, admitted that Jim Wessman Lincoln-Mercury
had been picketed by mistake a week ago. Jones waved
a friendly hello to ihe salesmen at Jim Wessman's as
he led a group of demonstrators to Ellis-Brooks Chev
rolet.
Wessman had been carrying on a training program
for minorities previous to the current demonstrations.
The crowd—gathered on Van Ness Avenue before
Burbridge's speech—sang "We Shall Overcome." They
also joined in a favorite cheer, "Jim Crow must go!"
About 90 per cent of the demonstrators were white.
A majority were students, but several elderly women
were seen in the picket lines.
