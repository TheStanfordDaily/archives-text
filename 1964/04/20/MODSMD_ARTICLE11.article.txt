# FRESHMAN MAGAZINE
## First Printing Of 'Zeitgeist' On Sale 
### JIM SELNA 
The new freshman literary magazine Zeitgeist goes
on sale this morning. The magazine has drawn from
freshmen writers to present a creditable selection of
fiction and poetry.
The feature story, "Skeleh," by Norman Bailiff, tells
the humorous tale of a genius who almost flunks out of
college while trying to keep up with his love life. The
twist ending is perhaps the funniest part of Bailiff's
short story.
"SKETCH," like a good deal of the material in tho
magazine, draws on college and past experiences for
theme. James Freeman's "Thoughts of a French Stu
dent" uses the stream of consciousness style exception
ally well in analyzing the emotional problems of a teen
age boy.
David Hansom, an English teaching assistant and fac
ulty adviser for Zeitgeist, told the Dally that the idea for
such a magazine had been mulled over by the freshmen
English teachers with little result. Early in winter quar
ter, Ransom and Miss Elizabeth Lyon, also of the En;j

lish Department, called a meeting of interested fresh
men.
Out of that meeting sprung the framework for Zeit
geist. Ransom said that the magabine was designed to
give freshman writers an opportunity to publish their
work. He viewed the magazine not as a protest against
the Sequoia, but rather a recognition of the limitations
of the older magazine which prevents it from accepting
a good deal of freshman work.
JOHN KEEIX, who shares the editorship with Bob
Fellmcth and A 1 Braunmuller, said that the magazine
"reflects the common impulses, the common experiences
of the class which have not yet been expressed." The
magazine was able to begin operation with a grant from
the English Department.
The poetry in the magazine shows a wider scope than
the rest of the material and in some ways outshines the
fiction. Antony Holdsworth's "Would You" and "Early
Time" have a distinct lyrical quality to them. "Dialogue
with a Girl in a Tree." by Janeon Kerpcr, tells of a
"shiny-haired girl siltine high in a tree."

"A Warning to Conscientious Americans." I\v Ken
Skinner, satirizes 1 he recent talk of labelling cigarettes
with "Danger!" notices. Skinner does a neat bit of axe
work with his dry sense of luimor which falls into the
vein of "The Week That Was."
The cover design, clone by Mark Kane, attempts to
show the driving spirit of the Class of '67 through an
overlapping sketch picturing Michelangelo's David, the
front of Memorial Church, and a girl resembling Rodin's
Thinker sitting on the steps of the Quad.
RANSOM KXI'ItKISSKH considerable satisfaction
with the members of staff who have taken the maga
zine from inception to reality principally on their own
initiative. Zeitgeist will be on sale this week in front of
the Post Office and at the Engineering Corner.
For its second issue, the magazine is sponsoring a
poetry contest limited to freshmen. Cash prizes will be
awarded to the three poems judged the best by the Eng
lish Department, and the poems will be published in
'Zeitgeist Entries must be submitted in triplicate by
May 1.
