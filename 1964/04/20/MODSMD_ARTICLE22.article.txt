## INDIANS CLOBBER UCLA Track Machine Rolls, 103-42 
### PETE KING 
Helped along by lapses on the
part of UCLA runners, the Stan
ford track machine rolled over
iho Bruins, 103-42, Saturday in
Stanford Stadium. It was tho
highest score run up on UCLA
by tho Indians in 25 years.
Even though Stanford domin
ated the moot, the day's top hon
ors went to a thin UCLA sopho
more named Bob Day. Day ran
tho fastest outdoor collegiate mile
of the season—4:oB.B.
DAY HELD a slim lead at the
three-quarter mark, then saw
Stanford's Paul Schlicke whiz by
him on the final backstretch.
Then the speedy Bruin put on a
burst of speed in the last turn to
wipe out Schlieke's bid. Schlicke,
who previously had run Iho fast
est outdoor mile, was timed in
4:02.3.
Most experts figured a 95-50
Stanford win. But then the In
dians won the 440-yard relay by
30 yards, as expected, only to be
disqualified for passing the baton
in iho wrong lane.
That cut it to 90-55, but in event
after event, Bruins ineptitude and

I steady Indian performances
; pushed the score over 100.
CJREATEST Tribe dominance
j was in the hurdles. Led by de
pendable Steve Cortright. in 1 1.4,
I Stanford swept the highs. Cort
right didn't even run the inter-
I mediates (where he holds the
Card record), but the Indians
swept that event anyway.
Cortright also copped the triple
I jump with a 45-10 leap, a below
; par effort that wouldn't win in
; many other meets, but beat what
Coach Ducky Drake's Bruins had
! to offer.
Best Stanford performance was
sophomore Chuck Smith's 15-foot,
2-inch polo vault. Smith cleared
that height on his first try to tie
I Phil White's 1963 Stanford rec
ord. lie then barely missed at
15-6.
FIVE MEN accounted for 42
Tribe points. Besides Cortright's
two firsts. Eric Frische, Bob
Stoecker, Phil Arnaudo, and John
Goodo each scored a first and a
second.
Frische got a poor start in the
100 and was nipped at the wire
by UCLA's Len Dodson in 9.8
seconds. He came back to lead a
Stanford sweep in the 220. Dod
son, who won the 220 in 20.9 in
last year's meet, could manage
only 22.2 for fourth this time.
Stoecker sailed the javelin sev
en feet past his all-time best to
win at 221-0 1 2. It was a timely
effort, because Bruin Hermann
Spegel, who was favored, w a s
right behind at 219-10. Stoeekor's
161-8 took second in the discus.
ARNAUDO BEAT teammate
Rick Scherer by a nose in the

[ 120 highs for second in 14.9, Ihcn
won the intermediates in 38.2.
Goode won the broad jump and
settled for second in the triple
jump.
The meet marked the first vic
tory of the year for Harry Mc-
Calla. McCalla, last year's top
distance man on the team, had
been hurting lately. But Saturday
he avoided tripping over a fallen
UCLA man in Hie SBO, then
fought off a challenge by Bruin
Gerry Gary Irving to win in
1:55.4.
Sophomore Dave D e u b n e r
sprinted easily away from Stan
ford teammate Bill Pratt for a
9:ini.2 two-mile win, breaking Me-
Calla's meet record and setting a
personal best.
ALTHOUGH records aren't
kept in this category, Stanford
Coach Payton Jordon probably
set a record for running a fast
track meet. The meet was over
in just one hour, 50 minutes,
which this writer doubts has been
equalled in the U.S. this season.
Stanford Junior Jack Chappie
bested Senior Steve Arch for the
third straight week in the shot
put, giving him two victories in
three meets so far.
Bob Mclntyre was another
point-grabber for the Indians. He
leaped for second in the
broad jump, ran 22.1 for second
in the 220, ran the anchor lap
for the winning mile relay squad,
and also tho final leg for the
superior, but disqualified, Card
team.
Stanford now has won 17 of
2.8 meets with UCLA. Saturday's
victory margin was the largest

[since Iho 98 T 3 1o 32-M massacre
in 1950. Saturday, Stanford won
11 ho track events, H2-20, and the
I field event. '11-22.

pendable Steve Cortright. in 1 1.4,
I Stanford swept the highs. Cort
right didn't even run the inter-
I mediates (where he holds the
Card record), but the Indians
swept that event anyway.
Cortright also copped the triple
I jump with a 45-10 leap, a below
; par effort that wouldn't win in
; many other meets, but beat what
Coach Ducky Drake's Bruins had
! to offer.
Best Stanford performance was
sophomore Chuck Smith's 15-foot,
2-inch polo vault. Smith cleared
that height on his first try to tie
I Phil White's 1963 Stanford rec
ord. lie then barely missed at
15-6.
FIVE MEN accounted for 42
Tribe points. Besides Cortright's
two firsts. Eric Frische, Bob
Stoecker, Phil Arnaudo, and John
Goodo each scored a first and a
second.
Frische got a poor start in the
100 and was nipped at the wire
by UCLA's Len Dodson in 9.8
seconds. He came back to lead a
Stanford sweep in the 220. Dod
son, who won the 220 in 20.9 in
last year's meet, could manage
only 22.2 for fourth this time.
Stoecker sailed the javelin sev
en feet past his all-time best to
win at 221-0 1 2. It was a timely
effort, because Bruin Hermann
Spegel, who was favored, w a s
right behind at 219-10. Stoeekor's
161-8 took second in the discus.
ARNAUDO BEAT teammate
Rick Scherer by a nose in the

[ 120 highs for second in 14.9, Ihcn
won the intermediates in 38.2.
Goode won the broad jump and
settled for second in the triple
jump.
The meet marked the first vic
tory of the year for Harry Mc-
Calla. McCalla, last year's top
distance man on the team, had
been hurting lately. But Saturday
he avoided tripping over a fallen
UCLA man in Hie SBO, then
fought off a challenge by Bruin
Gerry Gary Irving to win in
1:55.4.
Sophomore Dave D e u b n e r
sprinted easily away from Stan
ford teammate Bill Pratt for a
9:ini.2 two-mile win, breaking Me-
Calla's meet record and setting a
personal best.
ALTHOUGH records aren't
kept in this category, Stanford
Coach Payton Jordon probably
set a record for running a fast
track meet. The meet was over
in just one hour, 50 minutes,
which this writer doubts has been
equalled in the U.S. this season.
Stanford Junior Jack Chappie
bested Senior Steve Arch for the
third straight week in the shot
put, giving him two victories in
three meets so far.
Bob Mclntyre was another
point-grabber for the Indians. He
leaped for second in the
broad jump, ran 22.1 for second
in the 220, ran the anchor lap
for the winning mile relay squad,
and also tho final leg for the
superior, but disqualified, Card
team.
Stanford now has won 17 of
2.8 meets with UCLA. Saturday's
victory margin was the largest

[since Iho 98 T 3 1o 32-M massacre
in 1950. Saturday, Stanford won
11 ho track events, H2-20, and the
I field event. '11-22.
Helped along by lapses on the
part of UCLA runners, the Stan
ford track machine rolled over
iho Bruins, 103-42, Saturday in
Stanford Stadium. It was tho
highest score run up on UCLA
by tho Indians in 25 years.
Even though Stanford domin
ated the moot, the day's top hon
ors went to a thin UCLA sopho
more named Bob Day. Day ran
tho fastest outdoor collegiate mile
of the season—4:oB.B.
DAY HELD a slim lead at the
three-quarter mark, then saw
Stanford's Paul Schlicke whiz by
him on the final backstretch.
Then the speedy Bruin put on a
burst of speed in the last turn to
wipe out Schlieke's bid. Schlicke,
who previously had run Iho fast
est outdoor mile, was timed in
4:02.3.
Most experts figured a 95-50
Stanford win. But then the In
dians won the 440-yard relay by
30 yards, as expected, only to be
disqualified for passing the baton
in iho wrong lane.
That cut it to 90-55, but in event
after event, Bruins ineptitude and

I steady Indian performances
; pushed the score over 100.

win at 221-0 1 2. It was a timely
effort, because Bruin Hermann
Spegel, who was favored, w a s
right behind at 219-10. Stoeekor's
161-8 took second in the discus.
ARNAUDO BEAT teammate
Rick Scherer by a nose in the

[ 120 highs for second in 14.9, Ihcn
won the intermediates in 38.2.
Goode won the broad jump and
settled for second in the triple
jump.
The meet marked the first vic
tory of the year for Harry Mc-
Calla. McCalla, last year's top
distance man on the team, had
been hurting lately. But Saturday
he avoided tripping over a fallen
UCLA man in Hie SBO, then
fought off a challenge by Bruin
Gerry Gary Irving to win in
1:55.4.
Sophomore Dave D e u b n e r
sprinted easily away from Stan
ford teammate Bill Pratt for a
9:ini.2 two-mile win, breaking Me-
Calla's meet record and setting a
personal best.
ALTHOUGH records aren't
kept in this category, Stanford
Coach Payton Jordon probably
set a record for running a fast
track meet. The meet was over
in just one hour, 50 minutes,
which this writer doubts has been
equalled in the U.S. this season.
Stanford Junior Jack Chappie
bested Senior Steve Arch for the
third straight week in the shot
put, giving him two victories in
three meets so far.
Bob Mclntyre was another
point-grabber for the Indians. He
leaped for second in the
broad jump, ran 22.1 for second
in the 220, ran the anchor lap
for the winning mile relay squad,
and also tho final leg for the
superior, but disqualified, Card
team.
Stanford now has won 17 of
2.8 meets with UCLA. Saturday's
victory margin was the largest

[since Iho 98 T 3 1o 32-M massacre
in 1950. Saturday, Stanford won
11 ho track events, H2-20, and the
I field event. '11-22.
Helped along by lapses on the
part of UCLA runners, the Stan
ford track machine rolled over
iho Bruins, 103-42, Saturday in
Stanford Stadium. It was tho
highest score run up on UCLA
by tho Indians in 25 years.
Even though Stanford domin
ated the moot, the day's top hon
ors went to a thin UCLA sopho
more named Bob Day. Day ran
tho fastest outdoor collegiate mile
of the season—4:oB.B.
DAY HELD a slim lead at the
three-quarter mark, then saw
Stanford's Paul Schlicke whiz by
him on the final backstretch.
Then the speedy Bruin put on a
burst of speed in the last turn to
wipe out Schlieke's bid. Schlicke,
who previously had run Iho fast
est outdoor mile, was timed in
4:02.3.
Most experts figured a 95-50
Stanford win. But then the In
dians won the 440-yard relay by
30 yards, as expected, only to be
disqualified for passing the baton
in iho wrong lane.
That cut it to 90-55, but in event
after event, Bruins ineptitude and

I steady Indian performances
; pushed the score over 100.
CJREATEST Tribe dominance
j was in the hurdles. Led by de
pendable Steve Cortright. in 1 1.4,
I Stanford swept the highs. Cort
right didn't even run the inter-
I mediates (where he holds the
Card record), but the Indians
swept that event anyway.
Cortright also copped the triple
I jump with a 45-10 leap, a below
; par effort that wouldn't win in
; many other meets, but beat what
Coach Ducky Drake's Bruins had
! to offer.
Best Stanford performance was
sophomore Chuck Smith's 15-foot,
2-inch polo vault. Smith cleared
that height on his first try to tie
I Phil White's 1963 Stanford rec
ord. lie then barely missed at
15-6.
FIVE MEN accounted for 42
Tribe points. Besides Cortright's
two firsts. Eric Frische, Bob
Stoecker, Phil Arnaudo, and John
Goodo each scored a first and a
second.
Frische got a poor start in the
100 and was nipped at the wire
by UCLA's Len Dodson in 9.8
seconds. He came back to lead a
Stanford sweep in the 220. Dod
son, who won the 220 in 20.9 in
last year's meet, could manage
only 22.2 for fourth this time.
