### 
By JOE HERNANDEZ
The Stanford Indians split a
pair of baseball games with Cal
Poly of Pomona last weekend,
Friday Stanford won 7-6. Satur
day the tables were reversed as
Cal Poly won by the same score.
The series was highlighted by
a fend between Cal Poly coach
John Scolinas and umpire Dr.
Ross. Although the Cal Poly team
identified the umpire with the
national label of the same name
the truth is that Ross is a Ph.D.
and supervisor of Contra Costa
schools.
IN FRIDAY'S game the fiery
Cal Poly coach was removed
from the field after vigorously
protesting pitches, and Saturday
j he came close when he charged
Ross after Ross had called one
of the Cal Poly players out on a
close play at second and Ihen
kicked hi m out for protesting.
Scolinas kept a cooler head about
him this lime and sulked back
j to the dugout before gelling the
i boot.
Cal Poly broke the ice in the
j initial encounter with four runs

in the second inning. Four singles
and an error did the damage.
THK SMCONI) inning was the
icebreaker again Saturday as
Cal Poly scored one run.
Cal Poly scored two more in
the third with two walks followed
by two singles.
In their half of the third Stan
ford missed a golden opportunity
to break the game wide open.
With bases loaded and no outs
Smith flied to shallow right to
get across a run and Raymond's
sharply hit ball turned into a
double play turning Stanford
away empty handed.
SINGLES IN the fourth by
Raymond, Middlekauff, and Hoi
mann plus a walk to Hibbs, play
ing rightfield, put across one run.
An error by the shortstop on a
! hard hit ball by Seckler scored
| two more runs. This put Stanford
within one run of Cal Poly.
A single by Thacher and a
double by Smith plus a wild
pitch accounted for ihree more
Indian tallies. Unfortunately Cal
Poly had scored three runs in
the same inning so Stanford did
not close any ground.
Line scores:
R If K
Cal Poly 040 Oil 000—6 9 1
Stanford 010 050 01x- 7 12 1

The Stanford Indians split a
pair of baseball games with Cal
Poly of Pomona last weekend,
Friday Stanford won 7-6. Satur
day the tables were reversed as
Cal Poly won by the same score.
The series was highlighted by
a fend between Cal Poly coach
John Scolinas and umpire Dr.
Ross. Although the Cal Poly team
identified the umpire with the
national label of the same name
the truth is that Ross is a Ph.D.
and supervisor of Contra Costa
schools.
IN FRIDAY'S game the fiery
Cal Poly coach was removed
from the field after vigorously
protesting pitches, and Saturday
j he came close when he charged
Ross after Ross had called one
of the Cal Poly players out on a
close play at second and Ihen
kicked hi m out for protesting.
Scolinas kept a cooler head about
him this lime and sulked back
j to the dugout before gelling the
i boot.
Cal Poly broke the ice in the
j initial encounter with four runs

in the second inning. Four singles
and an error did the damage.
THK SMCONI) inning was the
icebreaker again Saturday as
Cal Poly scored one run.
Cal Poly scored two more in
the third with two walks followed
by two singles.
In their half of the third Stan
ford missed a golden opportunity
to break the game wide open.
With bases loaded and no outs
Smith flied to shallow right to
get across a run and Raymond's
sharply hit ball turned into a
double play turning Stanford
away empty handed.
SINGLES IN the fourth by
Raymond, Middlekauff, and Hoi
mann plus a walk to Hibbs, play
ing rightfield, put across one run.
An error by the shortstop on a
! hard hit ball by Seckler scored
| two more runs. This put Stanford
within one run of Cal Poly.
A single by Thacher and a
double by Smith plus a wild
pitch accounted for ihree more
Indian tallies. Unfortunately Cal
Poly had scored three runs in
the same inning so Stanford did
not close any ground.
