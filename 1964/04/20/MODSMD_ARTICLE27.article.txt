# Changes In Senior Colloquia May Be Forthcoming
## Editorial 
### 
The only sure things in life are death,
taxes and senior colloquia. Nobody can do
much about death or taxes, but the Student
Academic Affairs Committee of Legislature
has made some suggestions about colloquia
w Inch, we feel, will greatly improve the pres
ent situation.
One student described her colloquium as
"the most rewarding academic experieneeof
her Stanford education. Another student
in the majority, sadly—described his collo
quium as a "tedious waste of time."
THE STUDENT ACADEMIC' Affairs
Committee has been discussing the collo
quium program with students and faculty for

several months. Their conclusions and recom
mendations are worth careful consideration.
"First, there are at present an insufficient
number of colloquia. Some students are
forced into taking eolloqs in which they have
no interest, which defeats the whole purpose
of the program. Providing more colloquia is,
of course, a very difficult scheduling problem,
but one with which we have dealt. . . .
"Second, unfortunately some instructors
are not familiar with the purposes of the col
loquia program, with the result that certain
eolloqs lack any sense of direction, purpose
or academic value. This problem is beyond
the committee's scope."

THESE RECOMMENDATIONS h a v c
been made to deal with the problems:
• Tile number of eolloquia should be in
creased. This is the opinion almost unani
mously expressed by student evaluation sur
veys and eehoed by most professors inter
viewed.
• New sourees of instruetor talent should
besought. Many professors tea eh eolloquia in
areas other than that of their academic dis
cipline. We believe this to be valuable for

both professor and student. We also believe
people outside the university community
should be invited to teach eolloquia. Men in
voked in such areas as civil rights, commu
nity work and mental health could be invited
to give eolloquia on these topics.
• Students should be allowed to approach
a professor with a request to teach a topic
selected by the students and or professor.
Also, eolloquia formed by living groups —
with a membership made up of 50 per cent
from that living group and 50 per cent from
the student body in general—should be con
sidered.
• The senior eolloquia program should

he opened to juniors w ho have finished their
majors. This would allow students six quar
ters to choose their ccjllocjs and would par
tially alleviate the problem of students being
"stuck with a colloq because of the time
limit. Additionally, it would allow students
time to explore new fields of interest devel
oped by the colloqs.
• The colloquia program should be ex
panded so thai il can be made available on
a voluntary basis to students in the sciences.
Dr. Ilobert Walker and the General Stud
ies Committee are now studying these pro
posals. We hope they w ill support them.
We do—wholeheartedly.
