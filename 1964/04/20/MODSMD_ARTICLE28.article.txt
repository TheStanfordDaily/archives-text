## Pacifists Irresponsible, Hurt Cause Of Peace 
### Stephen Shefler 
The decision of those pacifists who have refused to pay that
portion of their Federal income Tax that goes toward military
operations is both irresponsible and detrimental to the cause of
peace.
In recent times individuals with radical opinions have acted in
disregard of the law under the banner ol freedom when making
their protests. Students traveled to Cuba against the express wishes
of the Congress and the State Department; members of peace or
ganizations vandalized the signs and equipment in Civil Defense
Shelters; and now pacifists have declared they will not pay their
federal Income Tax for military operations.

ALL THIS It as been done under the label of freedom, the free
dom to protest. What is wrong is that these individuals have con
fused the free with the tree and easy.
They define freedom as an absolute, but as the learned jurist
Chief Justice Vinson stated in the Dennis case; "Nothing is more
certain in modern society than the principle that there are no ab
solutes. that a name, a phrase, a standard has meaning only when
associated with the considerations which gave birth to the nomen
clature ... To those who would paralyze our Government in the face
of impending threat by encasing it in a semantic straightjacket we
must reply that all concepts are relative."
Madison's famed Federalist Number 10 points to the tact that
the founding fathers felt preservation must take precedence over
dissent. In order to preserve freedom in general, it is necessary to
limit that absolute freedom which endangers the perpetuation of
our system of government.
If we were to accept the non-payment of taxes by the pacifist
for military purposes, could we reject a non-payment of taxes by
conservatives for public welfare and farm aid measures? Certainly,
anarchy would result if each group of citizens could apply their
personel veto to national decisions.
The concepts that denied the state of South Carolina the right
to nullify a national law are fully as applicable today as they were
one hundred and thirty years ago. When an individual accepts the
Responsibility of citizenship, he agrees to those limitations on free
dom necessary for national preservation.

IN ADDITION to being irresponsible, however, these pacifists
are detrimental to the cause of peace. A recent cartoon by I lerblock
shows two Southern Senators pointing to the dove of peace and
stating that it is part of a conspiracy. We may laugh at the ignor
ance of the Southern Senator, but when are faced by the irrespon
sible acts of pacifists, laughter must be turned to concern. Indeed
the word pacifist has come to take on the connotation of radical,
irrational, and irresponsible.
To those who sincerely desire peace, the irresponsible acts of
the pacifists are deeply distressing. The cflorts for peace and dis
armament have been cornered bv a group whose actions discour
age the sincere and responsible peace loving individuals. It should
be our hope that the peace movements and their leadership will be
soon returned to responsible individuals, and that the day w ill not be
distant when all citizens w ill gladly call themselves pacifists.
