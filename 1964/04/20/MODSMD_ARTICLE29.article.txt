# Morse Case: Student Judiciary Shammed
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
For the first time in the
three years I have attended
Stanford. 1 am truly ashamed
of the University I attend. I
realize that in the arbitrary
community in which we live
(I believe it was once referred
to as "the Stanford family"*
there is nothing a student pro
test can actually accomplish,
but I feel nevertheless that a
few things cannot go unsaid.
In the case of the suspension
of Frank Morse, the adminis
tration lias committed either
one or the other, or more prob
ably both, of two gross off
enses. Not only has a complete
sham been made of student
judicial process, but the aca
demic future of an outstand
ing student and person has
needlessly been put in jeop
ardy.
The first offense is certainly
true. The administration com
pletely ignored the recommen
dation of not one, but two,
legally constituted student
judicial bodies, that is the
Stanford-in-Italy Judicial
Board and the ASSU Judicial
Council. The second case is
also most certainly true, if the
complete facts have been pre
sented to the student judicial
bodies.
If printed information has,
in fact, been withheld from the
student bodies, as may be the
case since the administration
has refused to let the Judicial
Council review a report sent
in by Dr. Frulla, the director
of the Italian campus, then stu
dent judicial procedure has
been bypassed and ignored
again.
As a past member of a Stan
ford-in-Italy group. I am well
aware of the form which the
report of Dr. Frulla likely
took. It is a tragedy that this
report be used as the sole rea
son for Frank Morse's suspen
sion (which must be the case
since the facts brought out at
the public hearing seem to
warrant little more than fi
nancial restitution for the
minor damages caused). This
case requires much more sober
and unemotional analysis than

that of which Dr. Frulla is
capable.
If it lived once, student judi
cial power is now dead at Stan
ford, and the academic career
of a member of "the Stanford
family" has been needlessly
and uselessly interrupted. In
addition, the entire foreign
campus program has been
jeopardized by such irrespon
sible action. How many stu
dents will risk suspension for
minor offenses for the chance
to study overseas?

Editor, The Daily:
One of the most important
battles ever fought in the civil
rights struggle will be decided
on the California November
ballot. This is the California
Real K state Association's
Initiative which would not
only nullify existing fair hous
ing legislation (the Rumford
Act), but would forever after
make it impossible for state,
county or city governments to
pass legislation designed to
cope with discrimination in
housing.
If the Initiative is approved,
California would thus have
segregation built into its state
constitution, with no redress
possible for minority groups
who have been discriminated
against in the area of housing.
In an effort to combat this
proposal, a group of people in
the area have formed a Mid-
Peninsula Citizens Committee
Against the Initiative. The im
mediate need of this Commit
tee is to get as broadly repre
sentative a list of names as
possible of individuals who are
willing to go on record as
opposing the C.R.E.A. Initia
tive.
This letter constitutes an
invitation to all members of
the Stanford University fac
ulty and staff to send me their
names, so that the University
can be well represented in this
community effort. It is also

an appeal to students to volun
teer to help in the work of the
Citizen's Committee. Such in
formation, from either faculty
or students, can be sent to my
office, Room 51-F.

The unstoppered essence of
our fraternity system has bo
gun deterring some pledge
oriented freshmen. Will a new
rush plan or contact policy re
bottle it? . . . I think not. Real
improvement in fraternity
rushing demands the houses'
becoming in fact what their
constitutions say they are
distillations of America's high
est ideals.
Fancy brochures and sexy
hostesses don't have the
"snowrpower" they used to.
The jaded freshman now rea
lizes that three years of
pranks, parties, and fornica
tion are meager fai-e in a char
acter-straved soci e t y. He's
looking for today's real he-men
with the guts not to conform.
Rut where does he find
them? He will find these men
right in "his" fraternity try
ing to convince stereotyped,
studly brothers that fraterni
ties are dead without renewed
academic and social values.
We ask. "Can fraternities
change?" The answer is they
must change for Ihe sake of
our country and future greek
letter men. Therefore a sum
mons should be nailed to every
house door to: "Wake up,
clean up. look up, to the chal
lenges confronting social fra

For the first time in the
three years I have attended
Stanford. 1 am truly ashamed
of the University I attend. I
realize that in the arbitrary
community in which we live
(I believe it was once referred
to as "the Stanford family"*
there is nothing a student pro
test can actually accomplish,
but I feel nevertheless that a
few things cannot go unsaid.
In the case of the suspension
of Frank Morse, the adminis
tration lias committed either
one or the other, or more prob
ably both, of two gross off
enses. Not only has a complete
sham been made of student
judicial process, but the aca
demic future of an outstand
ing student and person has
needlessly been put in jeop
ardy.
The first offense is certainly
true. The administration com
pletely ignored the recommen
dation of not one, but two,
legally constituted student
judicial bodies, that is the
Stanford-in-Italy Judicial
Board and the ASSU Judicial
Council. The second case is
also most certainly true, if the
complete facts have been pre
sented to the student judicial
bodies.
If printed information has,
in fact, been withheld from the
student bodies, as may be the
case since the administration
has refused to let the Judicial
Council review a report sent
in by Dr. Frulla, the director
of the Italian campus, then stu
dent judicial procedure has
been bypassed and ignored
again.
As a past member of a Stan
ford-in-Italy group. I am well
aware of the form which the
report of Dr. Frulla likely
took. It is a tragedy that this
report be used as the sole rea
son for Frank Morse's suspen
sion (which must be the case
since the facts brought out at
the public hearing seem to
warrant little more than fi
nancial restitution for the
minor damages caused). This
case requires much more sober
and unemotional analysis than

that of which Dr. Frulla is
capable.
If it lived once, student judi
cial power is now dead at Stan
ford, and the academic career
of a member of "the Stanford
family" has been needlessly
and uselessly interrupted. In
addition, the entire foreign
campus program has been
jeopardized by such irrespon
sible action. How many stu

minor offenses for the chance

• Housing Initiative
Editor, The Daily:
One of the most important
battles ever fought in the civil
rights struggle will be decided
on the California November
ballot. This is the California
Real K state Association's
Initiative which would not
only nullify existing fair hous
ing legislation (the Rumford
Act), but would forever after
make it impossible for state,
county or city governments to
pass legislation designed to
cope with discrimination in
housing.
If the Initiative is approved,
California would thus have
segregation built into its state
constitution, with no redress
possible for minority groups
who have been discriminated
against in the area of housing.
In an effort to combat this
proposal, a group of people in
the area have formed a Mid-
Peninsula Citizens Committee
Against the Initiative. The im
mediate need of this Commit
tee is to get as broadly repre
sentative a list of names as
possible of individuals who are
willing to go on record as
opposing the C.R.E.A. Initia
tive.
This letter constitutes an
invitation to all members of
the Stanford University fac
ulty and staff to send me their
names, so that the University
can be well represented in this
community effort. It is also

an appeal to students to volun
teer to help in the work of the

Editor, The Daily:
One of the most important
battles ever fought in the civil
rights struggle will be decided
on the California November
ballot. This is the California
Real K state Association's
Initiative which would not
only nullify existing fair hous
ing legislation (the Rumford
Act), but would forever after
make it impossible for state,
county or city governments to
pass legislation designed to
cope with discrimination in
housing.
If the Initiative is approved,
California would thus have
segregation built into its state
constitution, with no redress
possible for minority groups
who have been discriminated
against in the area of housing.
In an effort to combat this
proposal, a group of people in
the area have formed a Mid-
Peninsula Citizens Committee
Against the Initiative. The im
mediate need of this Commit
tee is to get as broadly repre
sentative a list of names as
possible of individuals who are
willing to go on record as
opposing the C.R.E.A. Initia
tive.
This letter constitutes an
invitation to all members of
the Stanford University fac
ulty and staff to send me their
names, so that the University
can be well represented in this
community effort. It is also

an appeal to students to volun
teer to help in the work of the
Citizen's Committee. Such in
formation, from either faculty
or students, can be sent to my
office, Room 51-F.

The unstoppered essence of
our fraternity system has bo
gun deterring some pledge
oriented freshmen. Will a new
rush plan or contact policy re
bottle it? . . . I think not. Real
improvement in fraternity
rushing demands the houses'
becoming in fact what their
constitutions say they are
distillations of America's high
est ideals.
Fancy brochures and sexy
hostesses don't have the
"snowrpower" they used to.
The jaded freshman now rea
lizes that three years of
pranks, parties, and fornica
tion are meager fai-e in a char
acter-straved soci e t y. He's
looking for today's real he-men
with the guts not to conform.
Rut where does he find
them? He will find these men
right in "his" fraternity try
ing to convince stereotyped,
studly brothers that fraterni
ties are dead without renewed
academic and social values.
We ask. "Can fraternities
change?" The answer is they
must change for Ihe sake of
our country and future greek
letter men. Therefore a sum
mons should be nailed to every
house door to: "Wake up,
clean up. look up, to the chal
lenges confronting social fra

FRED MIEEER
Editor, The Daily:
For the first time in the
three years I have attended
Stanford. 1 am truly ashamed
of the University I attend. I
realize that in the arbitrary
community in which we live
(I believe it was once referred
to as "the Stanford family"*
there is nothing a student pro
test can actually accomplish,
but I feel nevertheless that a
few things cannot go unsaid.
In the case of the suspension
of Frank Morse, the adminis
tration lias committed either
one or the other, or more prob
ably both, of two gross off
enses. Not only has a complete
sham been made of student
judicial process, but the aca
demic future of an outstand
ing student and person has
needlessly been put in jeop
ardy.
The first offense is certainly
true. The administration com
pletely ignored the recommen
dation of not one, but two,
legally constituted student
judicial bodies, that is the
Stanford-in-Italy Judicial
Board and the ASSU Judicial
Council. The second case is
also most certainly true, if the
complete facts have been pre
sented to the student judicial
bodies.
If printed information has,
in fact, been withheld from the
student bodies, as may be the
case since the administration
has refused to let the Judicial
Council review a report sent
in by Dr. Frulla, the director
of the Italian campus, then stu
dent judicial procedure has
been bypassed and ignored
again.
As a past member of a Stan
ford-in-Italy group. I am well
aware of the form which the
report of Dr. Frulla likely
took. It is a tragedy that this
report be used as the sole rea
son for Frank Morse's suspen
sion (which must be the case
since the facts brought out at
the public hearing seem to
warrant little more than fi
nancial restitution for the
minor damages caused). This
case requires much more sober
and unemotional analysis than

that of which Dr. Frulla is
capable.
If it lived once, student judi
cial power is now dead at Stan
ford, and the academic career
of a member of "the Stanford
family" has been needlessly
and uselessly interrupted. In
addition, the entire foreign
campus program has been
