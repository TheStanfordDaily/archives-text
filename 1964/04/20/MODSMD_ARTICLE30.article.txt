# Notes And Observations
## Goldwater Leads Rocky In California Showdown 
### John Bonine 
Sen. Harry Goldwater and Gov. Nelson Rockefeller arc squaring
ofi for a final priman battle in California.
Although most observers, including Rockefeller lieutenants at
Stanford, feel 11k* New York governor stands little chance ol w in
ning the nomination regardless of the California results, there is a
strong feeling that Senator Coldwater would be propelled toward
the nomination b\ a \ ictory here. Both President Johnson and Rieh
i:rd Nixon expressed this view on Saturday.

THE MOST RECENT California poll shows Goldwater in the
lead at present in the primary contest with 43 per cent of the He
publican vote, Rockefeller has 3J per cent and Harold Stassen 10'
per cent. Stassen has since been disqualified from the ballot.
An April poll of California's county GOP chairmen by the Asso
ciated Press shows 38 of 56 believe Goldwater w ill win the primary,
while 5 pick Rockefeller.
Goldwater has the official endorsement of the Young Republi
! cans and the Republican Assembly, and will w in the backing of the
| United Republicans of California on May 1. The Federation of Re
publican Women and the Republican Associated prefer him, but
neither endorses candidates. •
Rockefeller has the sympathy of the formal leadership of the
California GOP, as well as his own well-financed operation. Sena
tor Kuchel and Joseph Martin arc in Rockefeller's corner. Former
Senate Majority Leader William know land heads Go Id water's drive
I and Secretary of State Frank Jordan, the state's biggest vote-getter,
is also backing Goldwater.
On the college level, Goldwater clubs — many in existence for
four years—are being brought into coordination with the campaign
by "Youth for Goldwater." Rockefeller forces are setting up "Stu
i dents for Rockefeller" and even have one Stanford student as a paid
| staff member.
The College Federation of the California Young Republicans is
jin the Goldwater camp. The California College Republicans, a
much smaller group formed last year by dissidents w ho lost at the
YR College Federation convention, is controlled by Rockefeller
forces, but its mock convention endorsed Governor William Scran
i ton.

A SIGNIFICANT INDICATION of enthusiasm for the two
candidates was the petition filing for the priman ballot. Goldwater
! qualified on the first day with what the Los Angeles l imes cliar
| acterizcd as "historic ease. Volunteers got 70,000 signatures in the
first few hours, with 13,702 being the minimum requisite number.
Rockefeller engaged a professional name-gathering firm which, ob
servers thought, "would run away from Goldwater s amateurs.

I tire 30-day filing period to get the minimum number. Goldwater
thus will appear in the number one spot on the ballot, worth 5 per
cent to 10 per cent, according to the Monitor.
Most signs point to a Goldwater victory in the nation's largest
primary, and California's (SO delegates would be an important addi
tion to his strength. Me now has 102 delegates: Rockefeller has
none.
