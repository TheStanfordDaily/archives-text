# Sports Equipment Needed For Drive
## 
### 
A Peace Corps Drive for base
ball equipment for children in
Stantiago, Dominican Republic,
starts today and will continue all
week.
The drive is in answer to a rc
quesl from a Stanford graduate
and member of the Peace Corps,
Roger Johnston, who is stationed
in a slum district of Santiago.
Recreation is. according 1o a
letter from Johnston, a vital part
of the Peace Corps program to
aid the impoverished people of
the slums of Santiago to realize
". . . that they can (and indeed
must) work together lo build a
better life for themselves and
their families."
Unfortunately, baseball equip
ment is hard to find in the Do
minican Republic due to the
high tariff imposed on it. As a
result, "il is a common thing to
see crowds of youngsters playing
with sticks, handmake cloth
mitts, and balls of tape and
string."
