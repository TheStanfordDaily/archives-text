• Military Coup Collapses In Laos
SAIGON, Viet Nam U.S. diplomatic sources said yesterday a
right wing military coup in neighboring Laos collapsed a day after j
the overthrow of the coalition regime of neutralist Premier Prince
Souvanna Phouma.
Il was generally believed in Saigon diplomatic circles that U.S.
Ambassador to Laos Leonard Unger, probably had applied pressure
on the coup leaders.
A group of army officers led by Gen. Kouprasith Abhay over- i
threw Souvanna's coalition government in a pre-davvn coup yester
day.
Kouprasith, described as a tough anti-communist professional
soldier, set up a military executive committee of 15 to rule the coun
try, with himself as committee president.
The American source in Saigon said reports from Laos were still ,
fragmentary and the picture somewhat confused, but diplomatic dis- s
patches from Vientiane reported Souvanna had been released from
house arrest and leaders of the coup had apologized for their at-j
tempt to overthrow the government.
