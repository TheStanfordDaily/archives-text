# Grad Law Association At Odds With Stanford
## Fund Handling Causes Clash 
### BOB COX 
The Stanford Law Association \
and the University are at odds as ■
to how the graduate students' or- i
ganization is to handle its funds.
Under Stanford regulations, ai
prospective student organization
may submit its constitution to a!
live-member subcommittee of the
Student Affairs and Services j
Committee, whose function is to .
review the constitution and to j
either reject it or give it formal j
approval.
THE STUDENT Affairs sub !
committee has found the Law |
Association's constitution lacking,
in its provision for dealing with i
finances.
Mrs. Judith Hanneman, social;
coordinator in the Dean's Office,
has the official role of reading I
the constitutions and submitting j
them to the subcommittee if they |
do not conform to regulations.
"They register with me and]
file all their information with
me," said Mrs. Hanneman. She
added that the subcommittee set
up objective criteria which must
be met if an organization is to
gain formal recognition.
"ONE OF THESE criteria,"
Mrs. Hanneman said, "is that the i
constitution indicate that all j
funds be deposited with the Stu- j
dents Organization Fund (SOF)."
The Law Association handled;
its expenses through SOF this
year, but its constitution does not
specifically provide for it.
Chuck Cale, president of the
Law Association, was notified
that the constitution would have
to be amended within two weeks.
A GENERAL meeting last Wed- j
nesday of the law students' or
ganization rejected the proposed
amendment.
"Since we are an organization
of graduate students, we feel our
selves responsible en o ugh to
handle our own funds," Cale
pointed out.
As is. they have been channel
ing their finances through SOF
against the will of most members.
Said Cale, "If the University is
going to impose this regulation
on us anyway, the facade of
amending the constitution is<
silly."
The Law Association's funds]
are now frozen. Mrs. Hanneman j
indicated that the Students Af-j
| fairs subcommittee would meet!
| this week but that she was un-1
sure of what would take place.
