# 'Fat Blond' Living In Cedro?

A woman bus been sleeping in Cedro house, the Daily
learned yesterday. At any rate, a resident of the Wilbur Hall
freshmen dorm paddled as the feminine half of the winning
eo-Â«>d canoe team in yesterday's Hydrofollies.
Racing under the name of "Mary Swenson," John Brandt
combined with Brock Gowdy to vanquish all opposition. The
racers modestly credited the real Mary Swenson, a Branner
Hall resident, with a large share of the victory berause of her
talent at transforming the soccer-playing Brandt into an allur
ing picture of femininity.
'lust prior to the canoe races the Hydrofollies announcer
apparently succumbed to Brandt's intestable charms. He
dublx'd "her" a "fat blond." The insulted team of "Swenson"
and Gowdy was spurred on by this slur and put forth an anrn/.-
ing performance in gaining victory.
The real Mary Swenson was, in fact, later congratulated for
her fine paddling job. Now her genuine talent is known.
