ONLY ONE WAY TO GOD
Enter by the narrow gate. The gate is wide that leads to perdition, there
is plenty of room on the road, and many go that way; but the gate that
leads to life is small and the road narrow, and those who find it are few."
Matt. 7:13-1 NE.
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh
unto the father, but by me." I Tim. 2:5 KJ.
Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice and
opens the door, I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with
me. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even
as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne." Rev.
3:20-21 KJ.
. . Here is the answer, for all of you and for all the people of Israel:
it was by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom
God raised from the dead . . . This Jesus is the stone rejected by the
builders which has become the keystone — and you are the builders: There
is no salvation in anyone else at all, for there is no other name under
heaven granted to men, by which we may receive salvation." Acts 4:10-12
NE.
"For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, Himself
man, Christ Jesus." I Tim. 2:5 Douay.
"Religions" are man's attempts to reach God, to work out his own salvation,
to find peace with God by his own efforts. The words for "religion" in
the Bible are almost always used in a bad sense, and most Christians do
not like to be called "religious" because it often implies a self-righteous
hypocricy similar to that of the Pharisees. Christians realize that it is God
who has come to them through Christ, entirely apart from their own efforts
to earn His favor.
"For at the very time when we were still powerless, then Christ died for
the wicked. Even for a just man one of us would hardly die, though per
haps for a good man one might actually brave death; but Christ died for
us while we were yet sinners, and that is God's own proof of his love toward
us." Rom. 5:6-8.
"Time was when you were dead in your sins and wickedness, when you
followed the evil ways of this present age, when you obeyed the commander
of the spiritual powers of the air, the spirit now at work among God s
rebel subjects. We too were of their number: we lived all our lives in sen
suality, and obeyed the promptings of our own instincts and notions. In j
our natural condition, we like the rest, lay under the dreadful judgment of
God. But God, rich in mercy, for the great love he bore us, brought us to
life with Christ even when we were dead in our sins: For it is by grace you
are saved, through trusting him, it is not your own doing. It is God's gift,
>■>*>' o 'f»w<-i-H for work done. There is nothing for anyone to boast of."
Eph. 2:1-10 NE.
There is only one way an individual becomes a Christian: it is by receiv
ing Jesus Christ on a personal basis, and letting God bring about the miracle
of the new birth.
Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to tfis
mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing, of the
Holy Ghost." Titus 3:5.
