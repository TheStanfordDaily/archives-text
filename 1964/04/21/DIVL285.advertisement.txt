NEW GRRR IN TOWN
Ford Mustang ... a car as American as its name. And one that aptly fits the dictionary definition:
small, hardy and half-wild. Conceived as a nimble, sporty car, the Mustang offers distinctive
styling in two tasty packages—Convertible and Hardtop. Both are 2-door, 4-passenger vehicles.
The price? Sporty going never came more economically.
It took a lot of hard work and many people with creativity, imagination and drive to get the"grrrr"
to town. All kinds of skills were involved: styling, research, manufacturing, marketing, product
planning and many others were needed and will be needed in the future. For the Mustang is merely
ihe latest expression of Ford Motor Company's ability to anticipate modern tastes in driving.
In Ford Motor Company's search to find better ways to do the unexpected, there is the constant
need to enlist people with a flair for the future.This year, approximately 1,000 college graduates in
all areas of study and with all kinds of majors can enjoy the challenge of creating new automotive
marketing and manufacturing concepts. If you're interested in joining a leader in a growing indus
