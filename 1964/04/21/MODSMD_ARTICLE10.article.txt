Ernes! Besig, Northern Cali

Civil Liberties Union, declared
yesterday that he will come to
Stanford to see that Frank Morse
obtains a formal explanation for
his suspension from the Univer

Darrell Halverson, chairman of
the University Judicial Council,
told The Daily of a telephone con
versation with Besig in which he
learned that Morse had not con
tacted the ACLU for help, con
trary to what was reported in
the Palo Alto Times and the San
Francisco newspapers.
HALVERSON stated, "M or s e
could have gone to the ACLU to
get information about his legal
rights to pursue his case, but he
did not."
Besig, upon learning of Morse's
case from the press, has now de
cided to take action anyway.
Halverson related a statement
made to him by Besig: "We in
tend to pursue this matter with
Dean Winbigler, the President's

office, and the trustes if need be,
unless we get satisfaction in the
meantime."
THK PURPOSE of the ACLIJ
is to aid citizens without finan
cial means by providing counsel
and legal advice in instances
where rights may have been in
fringed or abridged.
Morse was originally found
guilty of violation of Hie Funda
mental Standard for breaking in
a door panel at the Stanford in
Italy campus.
He was ordered to serve five
corporation yard hours by the
overseas judicial council.
