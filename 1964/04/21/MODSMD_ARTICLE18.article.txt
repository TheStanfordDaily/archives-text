# Students Respond To Peace Corps
## 
### 
Forty-one Stanford students
submitted questionnaires and
took the Peace Corps Placement
Test during last week's member
ship drive.
Twenty-six of the 41 students
will be available for service this
year, the rest in 1965. Of the
three other schools visited last
week, San Jose State, San Fran
cisco State and Cal Berkeley, only
Berkeley topped Stanford on a
per capita enrollment.
Those who missed the test can
take it on Saturday, May 9 at
8:30 a.m. in the Civil Service Rm.
in the basement of the Palo Alto
Main Post Office. Questionnaires
are available at the Peace Corps
Desk in lIR, or in the Registrar's
Office.
