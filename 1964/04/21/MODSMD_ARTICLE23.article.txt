## Stanford Lacrosse Unit Splits Pair With Claremont, Marines In Southland 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Carrying the honor of Stanford
Lacrosse into Ihc southland this
last weekend, IS members of the
Tribe Club routed a strong Clare
mont group 6-1 then the next day
fell just short of toppling the un
defeated Camp Pendleton Marines
Stanford's showing marks it
as one of the top teams in the
West.
The referee of the Marine game
praised the play of both sides in
saying that the game was the fin
est he had seen played on the
coast since the Olympics of 1932.
(iOAME JOHN FONT played
two excellent games in the net,
frustrating opposing attackmen
and midfielders. He also directed
the clears which had improved
considerably since the team's first
outing against Colorado.
Ai Claremont Saturday, the
Card laxmen had little trouble.
Soon after settling the ball down,
attackman Toby Hayes maneuv
ered around his del'enseman and
bounced one into the far corner.
The . Claremont middies, th e
strong point of the host's attack,
were almost a match for Stan
lord's in hustle and ability so that
much of Stanford's scoring punch
had to come from the attack.
Grady Watts, a former great at
Harvard, scored from the left side.

I Lew Van Amerongen did like-
I wise, and Hayes added another
j scol-tug play to give Stanford a
4-0 lead at halftime.
HIvAI.IZINCi fh e game's out
| come had been decided, Coach Hal
Locheim used his players freely,
substituting whenever a player
was tired. In the second half,
player-coach Locheim, working
out of the midfield position picked
up a loose ball and with daylight
between him and the goal went
to the leftside and fired the ball
into the upper right hand corner
of the net. Bob Murphy also
scored for Stanford. Others play
ing well for Stanford were Wick
Rowland, Parker Llewellyn,
Bruce Bowdoin, and Peter Falk
land.
The Camp Pendleton affair,
Stanford's big game of the sea
son, was fast, rough and nip and
tuck all the way.
Stanford was without the serv
ices of Grady Watts, who aggrav
ated a previous knee injury dur
ing the Claremont game, an d
Woody Woods, first middie who
twisted his ankle and missed the
second half of the Marine con
test.
The Marines, capitalizing on
Stanford penalties, scored twice
on extra man situations before
the Tribe could master the goalie.
Feeding from behind the cage, the

[Pendleton attackmen passed to
cutting middies who somehow
I battled the hall in.
HOUNDED by ;t lough, experi
lenced group of defensemen, the
attackmen found themselves more
confined than the previous day.
George Peters, starting center
imiddie, started Hie Stanford scor
ing from outside with a hard
| bounce shot that eluded the net
i minder and found the upper right
i hand corner. Stanford's extra
j man play then worked to per-
I feet ion as Howie Taylor became
free on tho left side and bounced
another into the goal, \fter the
first period Of play, the Marines
j due to its strong midfield led 1-2.
From this point on, Stanford's
i defense of Jungle Jim Sehembs,
Burly Bill Heyn, Chip Greening,
and Dick Anderson combined with
the middies 1o limit the Marines
to but two goals in the last three
periods.
THE MIDSHIPS, realizing the
goalie's weaknes on bounce shot s,
kept the pressure on, and Bob
Murphy and Ilal Locheim both
tallied to make the score M at
halftime.
The Marines went ahead .1-1 in
the third quaner and then added
an insur a n c e goal halfway
through the Courtli stanza. But
Stanford was not through. With
two minutes 10 go. the Indians
called time out to regroup forces.
Seconds later, Jerry Liles picked
up a loose ball in front of the
goal and lired the ball into the
lower left-hand coiner. Stanford
got the ball again and the crowd
was on its feet. But the game
ended before the midfield could
get a shot off.
