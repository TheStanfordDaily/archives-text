### Our Correspondent 
Over the weekend Stanford's
tennis fortunes vacillated between
the nadir of humiliation and a
glimmer of hope as the Farm was
invaded bv southern rivals USC
and UCLA.
Friday afternoon the Trojans
of USC, led by Davis Cupper Den
nis "The Menace" Ralston anni
hilated the Indians 8-1. In the
feature match Ralston waxed Jim
Beste 6Â»1, 6*2.
Tll E MEN A (' E constantly
forced the psyched out Beste into
submission with well placed serv
ices and sharply angled volleys.
Beste rather consistently bungled
his rare opportunities for success
by plummeting into an abyss of
wild errors.
In the second singles Stanford's
Jerry Hurst almost surprised the
skeplics as he came within two
points of defeating Bill Bond.
Bond's cannonball serves and
giraffe-like reach finally enabled
Bond to make his escape at 4-t>,
10-10, 6-3.
In tense situations Bond inevit
ably came up with the right shot
that placed the slightly hesitant

Hurst in a defensive position. In
other matches of note Stanford's
Bradley Hodgeman and .John
Isaacs narrowly missed victory
in tight eonlests.
AGAINST l < LA on Saturday
the Indians approached a major
upset victory before falling 6-8.
In a ploy of prematch games
manship the rival coaches altered
their lineups with no benefit to
Stanford. In the first singles
Arthur Ashe made Jerry Hurst
eal crow at 6-2, 6-3.
Ashe's whiplash forehand and
streaking backhand found the
corners 100 frequently for a be
dazzled Hurst.
In the second singles flamboy
ant Charles Pasarell edged Beste
6-4, 7-5. Beste clutched too often
in the crucial situations to take
advantage of numerous chances
for Victory.
The high-point of the after
noon for the Indians came with
Ron Preissman's straight set de
feat of David Reed who is ranked
fifteenth nationally.
