### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Staff Editor 
University policy toward
signs in dormitory windows
may In* re-examined soon to
establish whether or not it
is "unreasonable," Director
of Residences John Fors
berg told The Daily yester
day.
The postor controversy,
which arose last week when
coeds in Brainier and Roble
were told to remove politic
al posters from their win
dows. was due to "problems
of communication," Fors
berg said.
Actually there was "no
memorandum, no directive,
no order, given, no r any
new policy made, he con
tinued. It has always been
a part of residence hail po
licy "to refrain from these
(signs)."
( larifying tli e circum
stances of last week's action.
Forsberg said that in re
sponse to th e many new
signs appearing in windows
from election year activity,
tlx- problem was placed on
the agenda of the monthly
meeting of the residence di
rectors. There was a "sug
gestion that we work
through tin- students them
selves to see whether or not
we could improve the clut
tered aspects of the resi
liences," lie stated.
Forsberg said that some
of the residence directors
directors had left the meet
ing intending to discuss
with the houses whether the
posters were unsightly, but
it had been up to the in
dividual directors to inter-

pre! policy.
"Students have to pick up
some sort of responsibility
for the way their residences
look," Forsberg sai d. "I
think the students of each
house have to do something
in the way of setting a stand
ard for the conduct of the
houses, and I assume ex
teriors of buildings are as
important to students as to
the administrators who have
to maintain them."
When asked about c o ni
plaints that the dormitories
were already anaesthetic,
Forsberg said that, contin
gent on the receipt of funds,
plans were under way for
the exterior improvement of
Stern, Brainier. Toynii a n <1
Kohlc.
Maintenance costs are a
in aj or concern, Forsberg
said. It costs approximately
$3,00(1 each year to <• 1 e a n
dormitory windows, which,
lie said, is another pressure
for higher room and hoard
rates.
"We want to give the stu
dents the best service we
can . . . and do it within
the limit of the amount of
board and room rate that
the students and their par
ents can afford."
J" Referring to the safety
factor involved iu the poster
policy, Forsberg stated that
"the safety of a student is
certainly not involved in
putting signs in windows,
and I did not refer to this."
He said that he was con
cerned with students' tying
long banners from rooftops.
"We don't want a ii yon e
hurt," ho emphasized.

J" Referring to the safety
factor involved iu the poster
policy, Forsberg stated that
"the safety of a student is
certainly not involved in
putting signs in windows,
and I did not refer to this."
He said that he was con
cerned with students' tying

University policy toward
signs in dormitory windows
may In* re-examined soon to
establish whether or not it
is "unreasonable," Director
of Residences John Fors
berg told The Daily yester
day.
The postor controversy,
which arose last week when
coeds in Brainier and Roble
were told to remove politic
al posters from their win
dows. was due to "problems
of communication," Fors
berg said.
Actually there was "no
memorandum, no directive,
no order, given, no r any
new policy made, he con
tinued. It has always been
a part of residence hail po
licy "to refrain from these
(signs)."
( larifying tli e circum
stances of last week's action.
Forsberg said that in re
sponse to th e many new
signs appearing in windows
from election year activity,
tlx- problem was placed on
the agenda of the monthly
meeting of the residence di
rectors. There was a "sug
gestion that we work
through tin- students them
selves to see whether or not
we could improve the clut
tered aspects of the resi
liences," lie stated.
Forsberg said that some
of the residence directors
directors had left the meet
ing intending to discuss
with the houses whether the
posters were unsightly, but
it had been up to the in
dividual directors to inter-

pre! policy.
"Students have to pick up
some sort of responsibility
for the way their residences
look," Forsberg sai d. "I
think the students of each
house have to do something
in the way of setting a stand
ard for the conduct of the
houses, and I assume ex
teriors of buildings are as
important to students as to
the administrators who have
to maintain them."
When asked about c o ni
plaints that the dormitories
were already anaesthetic,
Forsberg said that, contin
gent on the receipt of funds,
plans were under way for
the exterior improvement of
Stern, Brainier. Toynii a n <1

Maintenance costs are a
in aj or concern, Forsberg
said. It costs approximately
$3,00(1 each year to <• 1 e a n
dormitory windows, which,
lie said, is another pressure
for higher room and hoard
rates.
"We want to give the stu
dents the best service we
can . . . and do it within

board and room rate that
the students and their par
