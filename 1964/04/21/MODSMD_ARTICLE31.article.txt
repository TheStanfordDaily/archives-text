# Separate Rush Systems Simple, Fair
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
Editor,Tlu* Daily:
Mr. Strasburg's statement that
separate rush policies w ere
matters that concerned all the
campus is a rather blatant fiction.
As most juniors and seniors in
the clubs and fraternities remem
ber. the single rush policy was
pushed by a group of zealous
sponsors anxious to promote the
Wilbur house system.
The curious part of this was
thai prior to that transition, these
sponsors had lauded the club rush
system while certain criticizing
aspects of the fraternity system.
In fact, these sponsors were con
cerned with the indiscretions of
a few fraternities- but why then
did these idealistic young men not
raise their objections against the
specific houses that disturbed
them. Fairness would certainly
dictate such a course, but con
demning fraternties and clubs
alike — though they are very
much unalike — and writing
a blanket rush policy was, to
them, apparently preferable to
supporting a specific complaint
against specific injustices.
Till: CONTENTION, "t ha t
separate rush policies tended to
confuse freshmen." just doesn't
square with the fact that Stan
ford freshmen are not mental
midgets. Every aspect of Univer
sity life is covered by a separate
set of regulations. If the fresh
men leave Wilbur unable to cope
with such diversity, then perhaps
the Sponsors have failed in their
duty.
As to the objection that sepa
rate ru s h policies tended to
"create animosity among the fra
ternities, eating clubs, and inde
pendent houses," the parties in
question make better judges. The
last two years have seen more
extended, hard-sell, high-pressure
competition under the joint rush
policy than under the previous
system.
Under the system of separate
policies, a large degree of co
operation existed to prevent
working at cross-purposes. How
ever, the enforced coordination
under a single policy which suits
neither the fraternities nor clubs
has led to considerable friction.
Having spent two years under
two joint committee policies and
having seen a third, we have yet
to hear a proposal which ap
proaches the fairness and sim
plicity for freshmen and organi
zations alike that was embodied
in the former system.
THE EATING CLUBS prefer
a system of completely open con
tact. with low-pressure rushing
carried on in an informal manner
during Winter quarter and th e
first half of Spring quarter. The
fraternities, having their own
problems, prefer a different sys
tem which we are unable to fully
understand and therefore judge.
The fraternities are in the best
position to establish their rush
policy and the clubs also are in
the best position to establish their
policy. The proposal to have ICC
and IFC submit their own rush
policies to LASSU is a far better
system than having a four or five
nlan committee trying to regu
late rush.
Submitting the policies to
LASSU where they can be vetoed
by a three-fourth vote, gives the
rest of the campus an opportun
ity to express their views on
those aspects of rush which may
affect them, yet leaves practical
control of dates, times, and other
technicalities in the hands of
ICC and IFC. the bodies best
suited to deal with them.

Enclosed is a petition that has
been circulated in Wilbur Hall
during the last few days in regard
to the pressing issue of Civil
Rights. I feel that is necessary to
interject a little sanity and ob
jectivity into the movement by.
humorsly [sicJ I hope, an exami
nation of some of the claims and
premises of the Civil Rights
groups by carying them to their
logical conclusions.
NOTING The Daily's policy of
publishing all notices and infor
mation that pretains |sic| to the
Civil Rights struggle, I am confi
dent that you will publish this
petition. Indeed, this is a chal
lenge to your objectivity and sin
cerity and I trust you will not
fail. (The names on the petition,
we received 30 in Soto House
alone, have been blotted out here
to prevent embarrasment to any
who fear they will be labeled
bigots because of their criticism
of some defects in Ihc move
ment's supports [sic |.)

The petition:
.national INSTITUTE for
the INTEGRATION of
GROUPS for
EQUAL RIGHTS
Noting that the present racial
imbalance in "Civil Rights'' or
ganizations constitutes tie facto

segregation of the most insidious
variety, we demand the complete,
| total integrations of these groups
immediately: NAACP, CORE,
SNCC, COFO, etc.
Our goal is a membership that
reflects a cross-section of present
flay American life: 80% white,
11</, Negro, and 9'other. And
WE WANT IT NOW!!!
Sign here to remove the blot of
segregation from our nation for
ever. Since we plan to picket the
coming Civil Rights Conference
at Stanford University, we need
your immediate a n d whole-

• Student Rights
Editor, The Daily:
I have become increasingly an
noyed by letters to the Editor
supporting the rights of students
and student organizations to de
termine . University policy. The
climax was capped by Craig Pen
ington's statement in the Mail
to the recent ban on political
posters, that, "the admin
istration was again meddling in
affairs in which it has no busi
ness."
WHETHER IT concerns fallout
shelters, student suspensions, or
political posters, many brash stu
dents forget that attendance at
Stanford is a privilege, not a
right. The "administration" is re
sponsible to the trustees, not to
the students. The "administra
tion" may graciously solicit stu
dent opinion, but it is by no
means required to, nor need it
justify its actions to the students.
With particular reference to
student administration, these bod
ies relieve the "administration"
of many time-consuming tasks,
but this delegation is frequently
misconstrued as an authorization
of student autonomy. When stu
dent organizations forget the role
allowed them by the "adminis
tration," they soon find that their
policy is subject to review. This
is the rule, not the exception, but
with each occurrence, students
cry again about encroachment
upon rights they never had any
way.

• lax Refusers
Kilitor, The Daily:
I take issue with Jim Bridges'
statement that pacifists are not
"reasonable or rational in refus
ing to pay income taxes, GO per
cent of which goes for a 'defense'
effort."
In the first place, a belief in
j pacifism is not a prerequisite to
such a refusal or an expressed
sympathy for these recusants.
One need not be a beatnik, "go
limper," or a folk singer to be
deeply hurt over the incineration
i of people with napalm bombs in
I Viet Nam and Cambodia. It may
be that refusal of taxes for these
purposes is not immediately
effective in halting such barbari
ties, but immediate effectiveness
is not the exclusive defining char
acteristic of rationality.
MORE IMPORTANT, tax re
fusers (and their less stalwart
sympathizers) simply don't want
i to pay the bill for sanctioned mur
der. It may also be that they feel
that an Eichmann can be judged
with a less sullied conscience if
one does not "simply follow
orders."
These people apparently feel
that it is important to lake a
clear and evident stand some
where, and that one sensible ap
proach is to try to turn off the
I gas that feeds the flaming phoe
: nix. There are obviously m a ny
other means of protest, but it
will take some little time for us
to learn which were the most
effective.
In any case, I doubt that all
tax refusers get their kicks by
carrying a sign of protest out*
: side of the IRS building in a hot
jS.F. sun. I believe the appeal of
| this type of protest is not ex
clusively to the "so-called intel
lectuals" and the "tax-dodger," as
Jim Bridges asserts.
We can hope that egg heads,
! real or putative, are not immune
I from shame when they look at
their own kids and realize that
they are helping to burn other
people's kids in southeast Asia
with their tax dollars. We can
also hope that non-egg heads,
I made of sterner stuff, will also
j feel just a worm of doubt when
they ponder that crops are laid
waste in Viet Nam by germicides
and pesticides that they too, are
helping to pay for.
AS EOR the tax dodger, both
individual and corporate, does
Mr. Bridges really believe they
are so deficient in resources that
they need the assistance of ama
teurs to con the government (and
the rest of us?)
In my opinion, it boils down to
j this: do we really want to live
I with murder in southeast Asia as
| we were willing to do with the
murder of over 20 million people

by Nazi bestiality? The question
is not idle nor academic. Burning
flesh stinks whether the order
is given at Dachau or by a clean
cut helicopter pilot whose salary
we are helping to pay.

• Answers, Please
Editor, The Daily:
There are a number of ques- i
tions raised by the Morse ease |
that I would like answered, but j
I am concerned here with just
two.
First: What are all the circum
stances that resulted in the sus
pension of Frank Morse? The
breaking of a door panel does
not seeem especially serious to
me, in itself. The only aspect ol
this incident that I can be sure
of is that Mr. Morse does not
have a close relative who con
tributes large amounts of money
to Stanford fund-raising drives.
SECOND: Why have a student
judicial council without the power |
to make final decisions on cer
tain matters? Apparently, the:
present judicial council is merely
another part of an elaborate
game that students are supposed
to want to play: the game of be
ing an adult. Rather than give
students Ihe actual adult respon
sibility involved in a student
judicial council that has limited
power, the administration
chooses to encourage them to pre
tend that they have responsibility
by letting them exercise token
authority.
If someone would clarify tliej
above mentioned matters for me.!
I would be grateful . . . but would j
probably have little more faith j
in the Stanford administration |
than I have now.

A Bitter Senior's Legacy
I This letter is directed to those
unfortunate individuals who may
find their grade point average
! is settling somewhere below the
! 3.0 mark, but who still entertain
| some thought of going on to
j graduate school.
As a graduating senior in such
a situation who has gained some
very recent experience in apply
ing to graduate schools. I feel
that I may have something of
interest to say to those fresh-j
men, sophomores, and juniors'
who will one day take my place.
THE FACT is that a grade re- j
ceived from Stanford which is 1
below 3.0—2.5, and even 2.9—is 1
regarded by the vast majority ofj
graduate schools as no better
than an equivalent grade from
Oregon State, Arizona State.
Milpilas University, or Long
Beach Poly.
So this is the advice I would
pass along to you. If you are go
ing to cross the finish line with
anything under a 3.0 — and a
great many of you will as long
as Stanford persists in using the
15 C ,; 3.i'» 35'; -15' - grade
distribution — give up all hope i
of attending a graduate school j
which has anything to offer. That
is, unless you see the light and
transfer NOW to one of those
"lesser" institutions where you
can pick up that grade point
which was so carelessly discarded
coming down Palm Drive.
THIS MAY sound a bit drastic.
But if you desire to continue
your education, you can do so
only if you have the grades. All
of the "sympathetic" professors
at Stanford softly cooing that
grades don't really matter, as
they pass out their 50'r of "C's"
and "D's," won't get you past
the sidewalk of San Jose State.
Now 1 don't want anybody to
think I haven't received anything
from Stanford other than a $10,-
000 bank deficit. I have been giv-t
en a superior education, and I
tell myself this everytime 1 open |
another letter of rejection from i
another Podunk U Curse their
stupidity and audacity.
