## Doors Privilege, Not A Right 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
Last night the highly select
Door Committee finished its in
vestigation and submitted to the
administration for approval a re
port on University poliey.
"I believe a copy of the report i
will be in the office of the Dean
of Students in the morning," said i
the chairman of the committee,!
whose name like many other i
things 011 campus is thought to
be highly confidential.
"It is a deep honor to develop |

a policy for the
university in a
time of great
need," said the
chairman. "B u 1
of course there
are s e v oral
points on policy
formulation that
1 should clear

up before taking credit for de
veloping a door policy. After all
I believe in giving credit where
credit is due."
First of all, no policy is ever
new on this campus. Like laws of
nature, policies here have always
existed, and, I believe, always
will exist. It only remains for
mortals like us to determine what
the policy is in a particular mat
ter.

"SECOND. DO NOT believe
that this select committee has
usurped any of the administra
tion's power in discovering policy.
Everyone knows that the Deans
do not make policy their humble
task in life is but to approve poli
cies made by others. And, if you
don't believe me. go ask the
Deans.
"Third, the making of policy!
at ibis University is a privilege,
not a right. Permission to make
policy may bo denied at any
time."
Attention was drawn to the
work of the Door Committee by
the action of Dean of Doors H.
Donald Binwigler in suspending
a student for damaging a door at
the Stanford-in-Italy campus. The
policy suggested by the Commit
tee is concerned primarily with
such incidents.
"The problem of doors," the
reports reads, "is an important
one to any institution of higher
learning, for, without them we
could not get from one classroom
to another. In view of this fact,
any student who maliciously, will
fully, or unintentionally destroys,
damages, dents, or mars any door
which is the property or within
the jurisdiction of Stanford Uni
versity is guilty of a violation of
the Fundamental Standard. A
habitual offender who damages
two or more doors within the
space of six months may be sub
ject to suspension.
"Actually," said the chairman,
"There are several other reasons
why we thought up, errr, dis- J
covered this policy. Some of them '
of course, are highly confidential,
but don't worry about that — be
thankful we didn't make the
whole policy confidential.

"ONE REASON that we use
doors here at Stanford is so that
we may discuss our confidential
material behind them. Suppose,"
ho said, "that a proven door dam
ager got into the deans offices,
and destroyed all the doors. And
believe me, recent evidence has
shown that some so-called Stan
ford students are capable of such
a deed.
"It is entirely possible that
after such an occurence, we
might have to reveal secret,
highly confidential things, such
as telling a student why we arc
kicking him out of school."
Other influential members of
the Stanford community have
refused to comment on the com
mittee report. One member of
the administration did make a
guarded statement however.
"Doors at this University are
are a privilege, not a right. Pos
session or use of doors by stu
dents may be revoked at any
time." said Dean of Doors, Bin
wigler.

"ONE REASON that we use

Last night the highly select
Door Committee finished its in
vestigation and submitted to the
administration for approval a re
port on University poliey.
"I believe a copy of the report i
will be in the office of the Dean
of Students in the morning," said i
the chairman of the committee,!
whose name like many other i
things 011 campus is thought to
be highly confidential.
"It is a deep honor to develop |

a policy for the
university in a
time of great
need," said the
chairman. "B u 1
of course there
are s e v oral
points on policy
formulation that
1 should clear

up before taking credit for de
veloping a door policy. After all
I believe in giving credit where
credit is due."
First of all, no policy is ever
new on this campus. Like laws of
nature, policies here have always
existed, and, I believe, always
will exist. It only remains for
mortals like us to determine what
the policy is in a particular mat
ter.

Deans.

Attention was drawn to the
work of the Door Committee by
the action of Dean of Doors H.
Donald Binwigler in suspending
a student for damaging a door at
the Stanford-in-Italy campus. The
policy suggested by the Commit
tee is concerned primarily with
such incidents.
"The problem of doors," the
reports reads, "is an important
one to any institution of higher
learning, for, without them we
could not get from one classroom

any student who maliciously, will
fully, or unintentionally destroys,
damages, dents, or mars any door

the Fundamental Standard. A
