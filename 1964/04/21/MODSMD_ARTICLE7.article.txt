# ICC RUSH PROPOSAL
## ASSU Control Protested 
### ROD PECK 
"The Inter-Club Council's rush
proposal is not an attempt to
strike out in a totally different
direction by taking an indepen
dent stand." stated Roger Cowan,
ICC President, last night concern
ing the new statement of policy
disc used at their April fith meet
ing.
The ICC reached two conclu
sions. First, the proposed ASSU
By-laws amendment that would
place "procedural authority for
the enactment of any rush poli
eies" under the Legislature
is not a suitable format for
asuring a fair policy for Eating
Club rush. Second, they decided
that the clubs should draft their
own rush proposal and press for
the adoption of a policy which
would allow the clubs i<> operate
under different regulations from

tliusc appropriate to the fraterni
ties or Stern.
Till-; COUNCIL then drew up
the following general policy state
ment and specific proposal:
There should be a period of
relaxed and essentially open eon
tact with freshmen prior to when
bids may first be extended. Each
club can have two or three guests
at meals on a regular basis, and
more than that only on occasion.
Contact at meals should be al
lowed for nearly a full quarter.
If bids are given out at the be
ginning of Spring Quarter, then
contact at meals should be initi
ated at or near the beginning of
Winter Quarter. One or two open
houses in the early part of Win
ter Quarter, and another later in
Ihe quarter, would be held.
MM;SII MIN should be allowed
to participate as much as possible
in the selection of their pledge

classes. That is, those freshmen
who accept bids Soon after they
are given should be allowed to
participate in the giving of sub
sequent bids. They should have
complete freedom to introduce
new rushees to the clubs.
Finally, the regulations should
be aids to. rather than substi
tutes for good judgment.
Willi these things in mind, the
Inter-Club Council, adopted the
folowing rush proposal.
Fall Quarter No rushing
contact with freshmen.
Winter Quarter The ICC ma\
set dates for three open houses,
which may be followed by of I
campus rush parties. Hushing
contact wil be allowed at meals.
Spring Quarter Open rush
ing contact with freshmen except
as limited or regulated by ICC.
1 -}j(ls may be accepted b\ fresh*
men upon reccipt.
