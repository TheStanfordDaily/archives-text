I Enemy-Held
Territory
Many people are quite unaware tliat the present world-system belongs not to God,
hut to Satan who is referred to in the Bible as the "sod of this world" and"the prince
of the power of the air." This evil creature controls all those who do not belong' to
Jesus Christ. Blinded and misled by Satan's subtle ways, non-Christians run merrily
along believing that they are in charge of their own lives and in control of their own
destinies.
"Love not the world, neither the. things that are in the world. If any man love
the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust
of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, arid the pride of life, is not of the Father, but
is of the world." (I John: 15, 16)
The Christian, who it a member of Christ's universal church, is not of this world,
but rather has his citizenship in heaven. On earth the Christian is living in enemy
held territory and as a pilgrim should live only to serve the Lord and Saviour, Jesus
Christ.
"So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are. fellow-citizens with
the saints, and are of God's household, having been built upon the foundation of the
apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole
building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom
you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit." (Kph. 2:19 -22,
NASV) . '
Set free from the chains of sin and the power of Satan, Christians recognize that
life in heaven will be far better than the best that earth can offer.
"And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked
according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that now is working in
the sons of disobedience. Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our
flesh, indulging the desires of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even
as the rest. But God, being rich in mercy because of His great love with which He
loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with
Christ (by grace you have been saved) and raised us up with Him, and seated us with
Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus." (Eph. 2:1-6)
"For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a
building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in heaven. For indeed in
this house (body) we groan, longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven."
(II Cor. 5:1,2)
Christian warfare is very real, though invisible and not understood by those who
do not know Jesus Christ. The battle is going on around you today; without Jesus
Christ you are not only a tool of Satan, but doomed to a life which will get worse, not
better. Won't you let Christ set you free today? You can then join in as a fully
equipped soldier in the Army of the Lord. God provides the armor and weaponry
you'll need (Eph. 6:10-18), and ultimate victory is assured to those who know and
love the Lord Jesus Christ.
"God remains unproved or a myth until we commit ourselves to the way of Christ.
The forces of evil, the 'devil,' 'Satan,' and all such conceptions remain as a laugh
able. superstitious hangover until we seriously attempt to lead Christian lives. I have,
therefore, no hesitation in challenging any agnostic who wants to test the truth of the
Christian faith. Let him commit himself, and before long he will know both the splen
dor of the truth and the seriousness of the struggle." J. B. Phillips, GOD OUR
COX TEMPORARY.
