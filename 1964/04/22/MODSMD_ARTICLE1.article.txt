UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — U.N. Secre
tary-General U Thant said yesterday he agrees
with Sen. J. William Fulbright's appeal for
some new thinking of "unthinkable thoughts"
about foreign policy.
He said that "basic plea" from the Arkan
sas Democrat to resist clinging to old myths
of foreign policy in the face of new realities,
"should be the guiding principle for all of us."
Thant opened his news conference by ex
pressing "heartfelt gratification" at t ho U.S.-
Soviet agreement cutting back the production
of materials for nuclear arms.
Meanwhile, French officials said the agree
ment seemed to have little practical meaning
except to show that Washington and Moscow
are talking to each other again.
This restrained reaction was in keeping
with President Charles de Gaulle's policy of
staying aloof from big power nuclear accords

while developing French atomic weapons and
planes and ships to carry them.

• Russians Defeat U.S. Team
MOSCOW - The Russian national basket
ball team, using a tight zone defense, defeated
a somewhat disorganized United States AAIJ
team 82-65 yesterday in the opening game of
the Americans' eight-game tour of the Soviet
Union.
The U.S. players, who had been together
for only two games in Poland before coming
here, lacked cohesion and were unable to score
on shots from the outside.
During and after the game the Americans
complained about the officiating of referees.
It was the first time an American team had
lost on Soviet soil since Russian-American
competition began in 1958.

• Russians Defeat U.S. Team
MOSCOW - The Russian national basket
ball team, using a tight zone defense, defeated
a somewhat disorganized United States AAIJ
team 82-65 yesterday in the opening game of
the Americans' eight-game tour of the Soviet
Union.
The U.S. players, who had been together
for only two games in Poland before coming
here, lacked cohesion and were unable to score
on shots from the outside.
During and after the game the Americans
complained about the officiating of referees.
It was the first time an American team had
lost on Soviet soil since Russian-American
competition began in 1958.

UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — U.N. Secre
tary-General U Thant said yesterday he agrees
with Sen. J. William Fulbright's appeal for
some new thinking of "unthinkable thoughts"
about foreign policy.
He said that "basic plea" from the Arkan
sas Democrat to resist clinging to old myths
of foreign policy in the face of new realities,
"should be the guiding principle for all of us."
Thant opened his news conference by ex
pressing "heartfelt gratification" at t ho U.S.-
Soviet agreement cutting back the production
of materials for nuclear arms.
Meanwhile, French officials said the agree
ment seemed to have little practical meaning
except to show that Washington and Moscow
are talking to each other again.
This restrained reaction was in keeping
with President Charles de Gaulle's policy of
staying aloof from big power nuclear accords

while developing French atomic weapons and
planes and ships to carry them.
