# An Absent President
## 
### BILL, MOORE Editor 
"Nobody is saying: 'My God,
Wally's not here.' The key
thing is that people who
worked around him knew what
he wanted done. And they're
doing il in his absence."
That's how one administra
tor summed up t lie effect of
President Wallace Sterling's
illness on University opera
tions. The president has been
convalescing since March 30,
when he underwent abdominal
surgery.
HK IS NOT expected to re
turn to his fulltime job duties
until July.
Sterling has been suffering
off and on for a year from
chronic intestinal inflamma
tion. In February doctors or
dered him to rest at home after
his condition medically diag
nosed as divertieulous ( prot
rusion in the intestine) - be
came complicated by acute
peritonitis. He will leave May
18 for a two-month vacation in
Europe resting at his home on
the campus until then.
But acting as president in
his absence is Provost Freder
ick Terman.
"IT'S BEEN a very smooth
transition." said Bob Beyers,
director of News and Publica
tions. "Of course, we do tend
to lose some momentum, but
the University doesn't disin
tegrate while he's out."
And Frederick Glover, assis
tant to the president, pointed
out:
"He's always available at
the end of a phone since he's
still on campus. But we've
tried not to bother him too
much. He's been home for the
past week and has started
working about an hour or two
a day. He's rapidly regaining

his strength."
BUT GLOVER added that
Terman is still making most
of the decisions.
"The president has been
away months at a time before,"
said Glover. "For instance, his
two- or three-month trips to
Europe. So you see this is not
a situation we haven't gone
through before. And. as now,
we are always able to reach
him if we need him.
"Any fundamental question
will be taken to him, of
course, before a decision is
made."
Glover said he thought stu
dents had an exaggerated idea
of how administrative deci
sions were made.
"IT'S NOT JUST one guy,
the president, cracking a whip.
Many things come to him from
staff officers who have al
ready made decisions. Th is
university is run by discussion.
Believe me, there's no unanim
ity of opinion over here.

"The administration is many
voices which argue with them
selves."
A number of these differ
ences are thrashed out each
morning from 9:30 to 10 when
the provost, staff officers,
deans of undergraduate and
graduate education, vice pro
vost and director of university
relations meet for their reg
ular conference.
"THINGS REALLY haven't
been that different dur ing Ster -
ling's absence," pointed out
Sears, dean of humanities and
sciences. "The policy has al
ready been long since estab
lished. Hi s absence would
make a difference if there
were some serious policy issue,
however. Then we woidd be
stalled.
"Suppose a serious proposal
were made to increase the
total number of graduate stu
dents by 20 per cent. Nobody
would be even willing to talk
much about it until Sterling
had been consulted."
Admitted Sears: "It would
be rough if he were out of con
tact for a whole year because
important decisions would
come up."
HAS THERE been any hint
of the president retiring?
"There is every indication
that he will be back," said one
administrator. "He, like every
body else, needs time to charge
his battery. I haven't heard
anybody say that he might re
tire.
"After all, he's only 57 years
old and 70 is the normal re
tirement age for most univer
sity presidents."
Said another administrator:
"I don't think his illness will
presage his retirement. I don't
think anybody does.
"I hope to God it won't."

Regaining Strength
