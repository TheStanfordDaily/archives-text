# Gleason: 'Jazz Is Reality'
## 
### GUY FUNABIKI 
Jazz critic Ralph Gleason told a Tuesday Evening Series audi
ence last night that one thing our society cannot stand is "raw
reality. flie real,' the San Francisco Chronicle columnist said,
"is what jazz is all about. Its appeal is to the youngâ€”who really
care."
At the basis oi jazz is improvisation. In tliis way. the develop*

ment of jazz can be paralleled
with the development of Amer
ica, for America too "has impro
vised in the face of new fron
tiers."
THK I'IiKSONAL touch of the
musician adds human dignity to
jazz, for it becomes unique and
cannot be duplicated. "The jazz
musician is a reflection of the
society. His work is a "personal
statement of courage and hope."
Jazz, which has its roots in
American Negro culture, also re
flects that curious ambivalence
which is white America's attitude
towards its black citizens. Ray
Charles' hit recording of "You
Arc My Sunshine" sold one mil
lion copies and made approxi
mately $20,000 for its author, who
endorsed the Negro artist's work.
Yet, il would be difficult imagin
ing the gifted pianist and the
songwriter on the stage together,
for the author was once the gov
ernor of Louisiana.
"Till-! COLOR of the skin of
the jazz artist has always inter
fered with the hearing in this
country." This is not so in Eur
ope?, where since World War II
jazz music symbolizes the de
sired American dream of free
dom and planning.
In Europe, the Negro musician
is considered an artist, and is
; received by all countries, but not
here. Miles Davis once refused
;i jazz award from Playboy Maga
zinc because it has never had a
Negro Playboy of the Month*

Although Negro sports figures
were the first to enter the white
world some years ago. the "first
acceptable interracial microcos
mos besides the whore house
and the old plantation was the
jazz society."
THK JAZZ message is th us
the dignity of man. "And in real
ity." he said, "it is the message
of life itself. The attitude of so
ciety to its art contains an im
plicit self-judgment."
