## 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
Spring practice continues on tho
Farm this afternoon and Friday
and Saturday as coach John Ral
ston (trills his men in fundamen
tals and readies them for the
Alumni game on May 23.
Ralston told The Daily yester
day that the team's first real con
tact work would come Saturday
afternoon in a scrimmage. The
first team, the Reds, will ho pitted
against one of the lesser units in
this action.
AT PRESENT there are no
sophomores running with the
Rods. The first unit is dominated

by juniors, with only four sen
iors on it. These four are left
end Guy Rounsaville, center Carl
Sehrader, right tackle Dick Leeu
wenberg and halfback Dick I lags
dale.
Others on the Red forward wall
are John Wilbur at left tackle,
left guard Bruce Kehrli, right
guard Ed Ptacek, and right end
Gary Pettigrew.
Dick Berg, the regular most of
last season, is the Red quarter
back, with Ray Handley, G 1 en n
Myers and Ragsdale behind him.
THE ONLY noticeable m a ,jo r
innovation thus far has been ihe
T formation, which Ralston says
will give his offense more "vari
ability."
In this formation, used by
Southern Cal and Washington
last year, two backs line up di
rectly behind the quarterback,
shifting just before the snap. The
fourth member of the baekfield is
set out on the wing.
Ralston indicated yesterday

| that any sophomore who cracks i
j the Red team will have to be)
plenty good. At present Dave
Net to and A 1 Wilburn, a guard
and an end, rate the highest. Both
are on the Blue team, ihe third
unit.
A third sophomore, Dave Lewis,
is presently iho quarterback on!
ihe fourth, Gold, team. This
means he is currently playing tie
hind Berg, Don Cook and Terry
DeSylvia in the quarterback slot.
THE MAKEUP of the current
Red team, subject 10 continual
change, of course, seems to re
flect the emphasis Ralston lias
indicated he intends to place wi
de fense in 19G1.
This is particularly true in the
end position. Both Rounsaville
and Pettigrew, the present incum
bents, were outstanding on de
fense last. fall. Neither distin
guished himself particularly on
offense, though.
Asked about this situation, end
coach Mike White indicated he is

"not looking for basketball play
ers who can jump way up like
the pros.
