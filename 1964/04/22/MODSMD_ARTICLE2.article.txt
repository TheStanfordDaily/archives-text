istered voter in the State of Vir
ginia and has not resided in Cali
fornia in over five years.
In delaying 1 lie announcement
of his candidacy due to the con
dition of Clair Engle's health,
Salinger said. "This was a very
hard decision. I had to delay a
long, long time. I have always ad
mired Clair Engle. I wouldn't be
out here today if he could cam
paign or represent the state effec
tively."
SALINGER has e x pr e s se d
strong sentiments on the civil
rights question and favors the
Rumford Fair Housing Act. He
is "totally opposed to the present
effort to repeal the Rumford
Act." In putting forth the "goal
of full equality of opportunity,
job equality, housing equality, ed
ucation," Salinger has called for
the speedy passage of the Civil
Rights Bill currently before the
Congress.
Contrary to some reports, Salin
