# Students Deserve Same Constitutional Priviliges
## Editorial 
### 
With Stanford seething over the iron
rule — and iron mentality — of the dean's
offiee, Dr. Isabelle Terrill, an Illinois State
Normal University administrator, lias fin
ished a timely doctoral study on campus dis
cipline.
Her main finding: Many colleges deny
their students basic Constitutional rights.
AND, ALTHOUGH she conducted in
terviews at 34 colleges, examining 167 dis
cipline cases, her project might just as well
have been a diagnosis of the ills of one cam
pus—this one.

Dr. Terrill reports that the main concern
of administrators is the welfare of the insti
tution; rarely are the offenders' rights taken
into consideration. Her investigations show
that more than half of all eases are decided
within 4S hours, with few pending more than
a week.
Dr. Terrill was quoted in this months
College and University Business magazine
as saying:
"EVERY COLLEGE student must have
the right to know the explicit charges against
him, must have the right to counsel, the

right to call witnesses, the right to question
accusers and the right to appeal. . . .
"The student offender should be able to
expect that the college student-personnel
officer will honor his civil liberties. This is
the challenge to the dean. He has the power
to coerce, the opportunity to stimulate. He
can stille student surges of independence or
place the responsibility for conduct on the
student himself. Coercion, repression of in

dependence and authoritarianism certainly
are not acceptable in the university."
All of these transgressions have been
readily apparent in Dean H. Donald Win
bigler's handling of the Morse case.
MORSE HAS not yet been told what the
explicit charges are against him. He has re
ceived nothing in writing. He has not had
the right to question his accusers. His right
to appeal has been farcical; the same people
w ho passed sentence on him heard his case
again (Winbigler and the Disciplinary Sub
committee of the Student Affairs and Serv

ices Subcommittee); the Student Judicial
Council was completely ignored, although
it is supposed to handle such an appeal.
When, we would like to know, is this
University going to recognize that a student
should be entitled to the same rights that
are guaranteed to any citizen of this nation?
As College and Uuiiersihj Business
summed up:
"Isn't it ironic that colleges, centers of
freedom and defenders ol rights and causes,
should too often deny these rights to their
own students?"
