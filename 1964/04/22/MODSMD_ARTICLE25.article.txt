## Non-Payment Of Taxes Not Taken Literally 
### Pell Fender 
Stephen Shefler, author of the vveeklv column, "Perspective on
the Future," complained Monday that the pacifists who are declin
ing to pay their Income Taxes this year are injuring the cause of
"peace."
As is obvious from each one's conceptualization of the term
"peace, Mr. Shefler and Miss Baez are not talking about the same
thing. Basically, Mr. Shefler believes there can be peace with
nuclear weapons, and Miss Baez does not.
THE PRINCIPLES of pacifism do not, however, seem to be
as much at fault, according to Mr. Shefler, as much as do the
methods through which the pacifist view is sometimes facilitated:
"To those w ho sincerely desire peace, the irresponsible acts of the
pacifists are deeply distressing. Civil rights groups who constantly
agitate receive, undoubtedly, the same sort of comment. The fact
remains, however, that the demonstrations have been largely
effective."
Quite seriously, Mr. Shefler, nothing conies without sacrifice,
and change does not arise out of stagnation. Your statement.
"What is wrong is that these individuals have confused the free
with the free and easy. . . ." is ill-considered.
Miss Baez, as she herself knows, w ill not escape paying her i
taxes. She w ill be forced to pay her original taxes, an additional
(and probably quite severe) fine, and may possibly go to prison, j
Miss Baez's action simply cannot, be called one of the "free and j
easy" types.
Shell pay for her protest, and the magnitude of her act demon
strates that she has the courage of her convictions, unlike Mr.
Shefler's mythical characters who are "sincere and responsible
peace-loving individuals."
However, the following words are most subject to question:
"II we were to accept the non-payment of taxes by the pacifist for
military reasons, could we reject a non-payment of taxes by con
servatives for public welfare and farm-aid measures?
MR. S HEELER'S QUESTION is irrelevant because nobody is
accepting Miss Baez's non-payment of taxes, in a literal or legal
sense. Miss Baez asks that people consider and accept her act
as a moral judgment upon the fact that approximately 60 per cent
of our national budget goes for defense.
No, Miss Baez is no more privileged than a conservative who
objects to welfare. Just as there is no provision in the Constitution
allow ing a Negro to be served in a cafeteria, there is no clause
which allows Miss Baez to escape her taxes.
Neither the Negro at the lunch counter nor Miss Baez is acting
lor specific gain, but for an ideal, a principle. Miss Baez has
found the legal modes of expression of protest inadequate. So
has the Negro, in many cases.
As Americans we have a certain freedom of choice, but this
choice requires that we adhere to its consequences. I'm sure Miss
Baez w ill gladly go to prison for her actions. Would we for ours?

Miss Baez, as she herself knows, w ill not escape paying her i
taxes. She w ill be forced to pay her original taxes, an additional
(and probably quite severe) fine, and may possibly go to prison, j
Miss Baez's action simply cannot, be called one of the "free and j
easy" types.
Shell pay for her protest, and the magnitude of her act demon
strates that she has the courage of her convictions, unlike Mr.
Shefler's mythical characters who are "sincere and responsible
peace-loving individuals."
However, the following words are most subject to question:
"II we were to accept the non-payment of taxes by the pacifist for
military reasons, could we reject a non-payment of taxes by con
servatives for public welfare and farm-aid measures?
MR. S HEELER'S QUESTION is irrelevant because nobody is
accepting Miss Baez's non-payment of taxes, in a literal or legal
sense. Miss Baez asks that people consider and accept her act
as a moral judgment upon the fact that approximately 60 per cent
of our national budget goes for defense.
No, Miss Baez is no more privileged than a conservative who
objects to welfare. Just as there is no provision in the Constitution
allow ing a Negro to be served in a cafeteria, there is no clause
which allows Miss Baez to escape her taxes.
Neither the Negro at the lunch counter nor Miss Baez is acting
lor specific gain, but for an ideal, a principle. Miss Baez has
found the legal modes of expression of protest inadequate. So
has the Negro, in many cases.
As Americans we have a certain freedom of choice, but this
choice requires that we adhere to its consequences. I'm sure Miss
Baez w ill gladly go to prison for her actions. Would we for ours?

Stephen Shefler, author of the vveeklv column, "Perspective on
the Future," complained Monday that the pacifists who are declin
ing to pay their Income Taxes this year are injuring the cause of
"peace."
As is obvious from each one's conceptualization of the term
"peace, Mr. Shefler and Miss Baez are not talking about the same
thing. Basically, Mr. Shefler believes there can be peace with
nuclear weapons, and Miss Baez does not.
THE PRINCIPLES of pacifism do not, however, seem to be
as much at fault, according to Mr. Shefler, as much as do the
methods through which the pacifist view is sometimes facilitated:
"To those w ho sincerely desire peace, the irresponsible acts of the
pacifists are deeply distressing. Civil rights groups who constantly
agitate receive, undoubtedly, the same sort of comment. The fact
remains, however, that the demonstrations have been largely
effective."
Quite seriously, Mr. Shefler, nothing conies without sacrifice,
and change does not arise out of stagnation. Your statement.
