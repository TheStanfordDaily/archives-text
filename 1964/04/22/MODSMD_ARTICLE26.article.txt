# Criteria For Judging Social Action
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
Editor, Tin* Daily:
In a letter in last Monday's
Daily, Frank Miller attacked
the concept of direct action as
advanced in a commentary by
Judy Walborn, stating that her
article "advocated the sell
righteous principle that genu
inely held beliefs of any group
or individual justify any means
to any end.'' He suggested that.
"Hitler acted accordingly."
Aside from the particular
fact that Miss Walborn's arti
cle was concerned with the
use of direct action as a
method of asserting equality
of a minority, rather than su
periority of a majority, there
is the more general fact that
her article was concerned with
non-violent direct action, not
armed coercion.
NON-VIOLENT direct action
has two effects. Firstly, it
forces society to face an issue
which it has failed to face un
der pressure of more usual
means of protest. This, how
ever, is not to say that it can
force society to decide the
issue in favor of the demon
strators.
Secondly, non-violent direel
action does exert an economic
pressure on the person or per
sons against whom it is di
rected. But. surely, economic
pressure could not force these
persons to take any action
which strongly conflicted with
their values. Many men have
asserted their willingness to
die for their principles; to im
ply that economic pressure
could force them to abandon
essential values would be the
cynical sort of materialism.
Non-violent direct action is
not a potentially useful force
for totalitarian. l -;. In fact, with
reference to the commentary
of Stephen Shefler, also in
Monday's Daily, I should like
to examine the possibility that
non-violent direct action is a
vital weapon against totalitar
ianism.
Mr. Shefler asserted that:
"In recent times individuals
with radical opinions have
acted in disregard of the law
under the banner of freedom
when making their protests."
He then cites the fact that:
"Students traveled to Cuba
against the expressed wishes

of the Congress and the State
Department."
Let us ignore the fact that
the State Department has been
unwilling to allow the Supreme
Court to decide the legality of
its travel ban and simply note
t>i<it the action of the students
was a non-violent direct act
against established authority.
As such, it meets with Mr.
Shefler's disapproval.
T suggest that Mr. Shefler
would do well to read two
articles: Bruno Bettelheim's
review of Ilanah Arendt's hook
Eiclunaiiii in Jerusalem: A
Report on the Banality of Evil
(Tlie New Republic, June 15.
1963) and an article by a Ger
man professor. Horst-Eberhard
Riehter, "Psychoanalysis of a
Nazi," translated from Die
Zeit (Atlas, October, 1963).
BOTH ARTICLES touch on
the question of how the ordi
nary middleclass Germans
came to participate in the
crimes of the Nazis. In a sim
plified statement, they find
that it was because within the
context of the Na/i society
these crimes were not crimes,
but actions sanctioned by law
and by authority. Because no
significant group existed with
in the society which willingly
and directly violated the laws
in order to force the society
to consider the moral issues,
the ordinary citizen never
faced them.
What I wish to point o u t
here is that legality and sanc
tion of authority are not suffi
cient criteria for judging an
act. Non-violent direct action
plays a vital role in assuring
that the issues are faced.

• Painful Reporter
Editor, The Daily:
One additional point needs
to be made concerning your
editorial, "Painfully Evident."
which appeared Friday, April
17.
As the University spokes
man involved in a lengthy con
versation with Reporter Lisa

Hobbs of the San Francisco
Examiner, I was asked for
an explanation of the Ho nor
Code and the Fundamental
Standard. In the course of this
explanation, I read to her ver
batim the Statement on page
15 of the ASSU 1963-64 Hand
book, which says:
"Basically, the Fundamental
Standard is an explicit ex
pression of the unwritten
ethical conscience of the
Stanford community."
As is painfully evident, the
handbook does not say nor
did I say that all students
must conform to the standard.
The remainder of Miss Hobbs'
story contains bowlerized and
otherwise distorted fragments
of the conversation which Miss
Hobbs chose to put into direct
quotes to satisfy her prefabri
cated ideas of sex morals at
Stan ford.

• Joe Martin
liditor, The Daily:
Your front page story in the
issue of April 21, "Martin Raps
Radicals in Republican Party"
is a school example of biased
reporting.
The gathering your reporter,
Mr. Joe Rosenbloom, describes
was certainly not a lecture,
given by Mr. Joseph Martin
Jr.. past Republican National
Committeeman from Califor
nia. It was a panel discussion
in which three other speakers
participated.
While two of them just
mumbled a few words, the
third one. Dr. Stefan T. Pos
sony of the Hoover Institution
On War, Revolution, and Peace
presented a most vigorous de
fense of Senator Barry Go 1 d
water. Dr. Possony disproved
many of Mr. Martin's unjusti
fied statements. The audience
repeatedly applauded Dr. Pos
sony's contribution to the dis
cussion.
I do not understand why Mr.
Roscnbloom's report com
pletely omitted any reference
to Dr. Possony's presence and
his discussion of Goldwatcr
versus Rockefeller. Or, let me
express myself in other words:
I only understand too well!
