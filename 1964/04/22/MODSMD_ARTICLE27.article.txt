## Do Russia, United States Have Like Interests? 
### Darryl R. Wold 
I lie New Hepublic has added volume il not reason to the ex
peeted Liberal line. I( says that now, when the ideological split
! between Hussia and China has Khrushchev with his back to the
wall, we should step in and befriend him, lor that will surclv make
him a friend of the West.
I his theorv that a well-fed Communist is a content and peace
ful Communist is adopted from the current British view—although
Britain s record iu dealing with totalitarian regimes hasn't been
too sterling—but doesn t sav why there is any neccssarv correlation
between the amount of wheat back home and the number of
Czechoslavakian arms in Cuba and throughout Latin America, or
the number of trained agents in revolutionary Africa.
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT aspect of the New Republic's
argument, however, is the analysis of what is called the American
: and Russian national interest: "in both cases that interest is in
peace and a rising standard of liv ing. All else is secondary*.' This
is fairly typical ol Liberalism's view ol the East-West conflict, and
| explains the willingness and readiness to reach a detente with
Russia, for it is a concern with the surface and not the substance
of the two opposing ideologies.
To determine where the real conflict between the United States
and Hussia lies it is necessary to go underneath the surface, and
! it is here that Liberalism fails to understand the essence of Ameri
canism, adopting instead its own ideas of man's aspirations.
T he characterization of the end and purpose of our society
as attaining a higher standard of living is consistent with the
rationale of most welfare programs being pushed on the domestic
front, w here "war" is much more readily declared. Liberalism has
an overriding concern with calorie intake and economic output,
rather than with the basis of the system that produces. Applica
tion ol this to international politics manifests a misconception of
j the East-West conflict, and an inability to deal effectively with
J Communist aggression.
What Communism threatens is not so much the productive
capacity of a nation as its hope of achieving or maintaining any de
gree of freedom and individual liberty. This latter, though, has
traditionally been our first concern. Are we being asked to aban
don it now in a vain hope of easing tensions?
ll' YVE YVEIIE to remain true to principles other than a higher
standard of living, though, we could not so easily reach an "accom
modation with Communism, and settle for a peace on their terms.
The idea of peace as the goal of both countries is in the first place
! acceptance of a double standard.
In the past it has often proven to be a facade and an illusion,
and that is precisely the use the various Communist powers seek
to make of it. The Russian concept of peaceful coexistence is not
a concept that can be accepted by anyone who values freedom
first.
1 lie best way to achieve this freedom around the world is, of
course, a matter of much controversy. I, along with most Conser
vatives, leel that the best policy is a strong commitment to freedom
as the first goal, and a willingness to use force when necessary to
oppose Communist advances that threaten freedom.
But an ideology that views man's goals simply in terms of a
facade of peace and a higher material standard of living is neither
facing squarely nor equipped to deal with the Communist chal
lenge to our institutions.
