contradictions, according to a spe
cial KZSU program last night.
In a transatlantic telephone call
with KZSU, Dr. Guelfo Frulla,
director of studies of the Italian
Campus, stated that lie had writ
ten a letter to Stanford in which
he recommended the suspension

He added that all members of the
disciplinary committee in Italy
agreed on the decision.
THIS COMMITTEE consisted
of Frulla, his resident assistant.
Dr. Guiseppe Mammarella, a n d
two Stanford professors sent with
each group.
In direct contradiction to Frul
la's allegation of accord between
the members of the committee,
KZSU presented a recorded state
ment from one of the Stanford
professors, Dr. Morris Zelditeh.
of the Sociology Department, in
which Zelditeh remarked that he
had not voted for Morse's suspen
sion and in fact was still not in
favor of it.
The program also noted that
the Disciplinary Subcommittee of
the Student Affairs and Services
committee had confirmed Dean
Winbigler's final decision for sus
pension.
But. upon questioning the mem
bers of this committee, it was

any written evidence placed be
fore them. They were read se
lected exei'pts from the file on

ANOTHER POINT raised by
the broadcast was the apparent
lack of familiarity of certain Uni
versity officials with their obliga
tions in the case.
