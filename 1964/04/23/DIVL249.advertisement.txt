THE FAITH WHICH SAVES
Chrsiti.an faith is not the acceptance of certain historical facts and doctrines, but
trusting in a Person, ancl that Person is Jesus Christ. Faith is abandoning all re
liance on rule's own resources and casting oneself without reservation on the mercy
of God. To have faith is to lay hold of the promises of God in Christ, relying on
the finished work of God in Christ for salvation and the power of the indwelling
Holy Spirit for daily strength. Faith implies complete reliance on <i"il and obediencc
to Iliin. Christian faith is as relevant to God's world of the twentieth century as
it was to His World of two thousand years ago.
Man has many substitutes for faith. Everyone believes in something, and puts
his trust, consciously or ttnconciously, in the "laws'' of nature, his own resources,
of men always leave one wondering if there, is something more to life a plan, a
purpose, an intelligence greater than our own at work behind the scen< s. (Juestions
of our own uniqueness, the mystery of birth, and the fear of death linger in our
minds unless we arc anchored to a faith in the living God. When troubh strikes,
man's bravado vanishes in a moment and he quickly reveals how helpless he is
without God.
"Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and niaketh flesh bis arm. and whose heart
dep.arteth from the Lord." Jcr. 17 :5.
"He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool; hut who so walketh wisely, he shall
be delivered." Prov. 28:20.
Many think of Christian faith as a philosophy of living which needs constant revision
and up-dating. They fail to realize that faith is a process whereby any sinful, way
ward man can become reconciled to His Creator, and transformed into His image.
After being saved by faith, the Christian then grows and lives by faith, experienc
ing when he does so an increasing closeness to God.
"The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer: my God, my strength, in
whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my tower."
Ps. 18:2.
One acquires faith by learning about God, from the II"ly Scriptures and then acting
on the promises of God which are declared:
"We conclude that faith is awakened by the message, and the message that awakens
it conies through the word of Christ." Rom. 10:17. When Christian faith is put
to the test it invariably "works!"
When a person upts his trust, in sincere humility, in Jestis Christ, God always
responds in a real and unmistakably way:
"And you too, when you had heard the message of truth, the good news of your
salvation, and had believed it, became incorporated in Christ and received the seal
of the promised Holy Spirit; and that Spirit is the pledge that we shall enter upon
our heritage, when God has redeemed what is bis own, to bis praise and glory."
Eph. 1:13 NE.
To call the name of William Shakespeare or Ralph Waldo Emerson for help and
salvation is of no avail; to trust and depend on the "faith of our fathers ' without
a decision for Christ is empty faith, to rely on the wisdom of theologians i- to
have misplaced faith which never works. To trtiM in Christ, to accept Him and to
call on llis name is to draw from the very source sprite.' - of lief itself.
"I am Alpha and Oiuega, the beginning and the end. the first and the last . . .
And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take of the water
of life freely." Rev. 22'.13, 17. NE.
"There is no salvation in anyone else at all, for there is no other name under heaven
granted to men, by which we may receive salvation." Apts 4:12.
Is your faith properly placed in the Person of Jesus Christ, the living God? Tf it is
you'll have no doubts about His reality and your own d< -tiny. li not, consider the
claims of Christt and his promises offered free of chary to all who come to Hint,
Test Christian faith and see for yourself. You'll never be sorry.
