# ANIMAL, THAT IS
## It's Crackers To Slip The Rozzer A Dropsy In Snide

Nine thousand, six hundred and
forty four.
That's how many boxes of ani
mal crackers the Tresidder store
has ordered this year almost
enough to feed the entire student
body once around. People are
munching the bland cookies all
over campus: on the library
lawn, in LASSU meetings, even
in professors' offices.
ANIMAL CRACKER eaters are
devoted to their snack. "They
come in here every day, just as
regular as clockwork," smiled
one of the Tresidder clerks. "Pro
fessors and staff people too I
know what they're going to get
right when they come in." There

arc even cases of two- and three
box-a-day eaters.
Low cost for the quantity is cer
tainly one factor in animal crack
er popularity, but very few fans
referred to it. One girl called tho
cookies "the most innocuous
things you can go around eating."
though she wouldn't let herself
be quoted by name as an animal
cracker-caterâ€”they're not. that
innocuous.
A more hostile but equally
nameless student said, "Well, if
we eat the animal crackers, they
won't eat us!"
Till] TYPICAL RESPONSE,
"Oh, I'm buying them for a
friend . . ." turned out to be:
"Whenever anybody on the staff
buys animal crackers or Playboy
Magazine," explained the sales
lady. "It's ALWAYS for some
body else!"
Variations of this excuse are
sometimes so implausible as to
be believable. A haggard y o u n g
man. hastily buying three boxes,
turned and snapped. "I've just:
gone through my Ph.D. exam, I
haven't seen my kids for a week,
and I figure I'd better give 'cm
something!"
NOT ONK animal cracker eater
polled would permit his (or her)
name to be printed. Is there some
thing about animal crackers
which makes these people Not
Want Their Friends To Know?
The followers of other modern
escape vehicles such as LSD are
eager for publicity.
Some bystanders did hypothe
size that animal crackers repre
sent a retreat to childhood
"They don't bring their comfort
blankets, but they still want ani
mal crackers!" and as an ex-ad
dict ihe reporter can testify that
there is a certain dreamy satis
faction to curling up with a book
and a box. . . .
The point can probably never
be decided precisely. A dark
haired co-ed, passing the cash reg
ister without buying anything,
provided perhaps the definitive
comment to dale: "I'll tell you one
thing about animal crackers.
They never have enough ele
phants in them!"
