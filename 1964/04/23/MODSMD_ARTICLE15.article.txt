### 
A hot new development
in (lie traditional Stanford-
California rivalry — a fire
fighting foulest — is set for
fliis Saturday in Modesto.
Stanford student firemen
have challenged their coun
terparts at the University
of California, Davis, to a
"make-and-break" race at
the annual meeting* of the
Califoriua liural Fire Chiefs
Association. A "make-and
break" contest pits four
man teams of firefighters
against each other to see
which can connect and dis
connect 420 feet of fire hose
to a pumper in the shortest
possible time.
At; the first contest,
held last year in Santa
Rosa, t lie Davis crew un
coupled Stanford by a four
second margin, winning 1 a
miniature fire axe donated
by a fire equipment firm.
Stanford firemen, still hot
under the collar, taunted
the Davis firefighters in a
written challenge.
