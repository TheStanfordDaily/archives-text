# Marathon Broadcast By KZSU
## 
### 
Beginning at 9 this morning
KZSU will attempt a 64-hour
marathon radio broadcast as part
I of Con Home week. "Fabulous 64"
j will include a variety of programs
—from music and interviews to
class lectures — in addition to
i regularly scheduled broadcasts.
As a special feature, remote
j broadcasts will originate from
| such places as Hoover Tower,
; Engineering Corner, Tresidder
Union, and a well-known wom
en's dormitory.
KZSU invites offers of dona
tions to the Con Home drive
"with stipulations." Program Di
rector, Dave Alkire explains, "If
;a student is willing to donate at
least five dollars on the condition!
i that someone in the Stanford
community will perform a certain
act — such as singing, reading
poems, or telling a story — the
station will negotiate to put that
act on the air." The viclim may
demand higher Con Home
"wages" and KZSU will attempt
to find contributors to finance Ihe
venture.
Offers of "stipulation" dona
tions should be made as soon as
possible so the station may make
appropriate arrangements.
