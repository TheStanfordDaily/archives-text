The Stanford varsity baseball
team extended their season rec
ord to lfj-12 Tuesday with a non
league victory over San Francisco
State, 5-2. The victory was due to
Ihe clutch hitting of Bob Holl
mann and the power hitting of lit
tle second baseman George
Thacher.
Stanford's first run of the game
came in the bottom of the first
inning when Ron Yett, who col
lected a single and a double in Ihe
contest, sprinted to third on an
apparent easy fly-out to the right
fielder. Stanford then success
fully executed a delayed-steai of
second which brought Yen across
the plate with the first run of the
game.
San Francisco tied the score
with a run in the fourth on a
booming triple by Christman
which brought across one run.

score but was thrown out at home
on a disputed call. Christman

argued the umpire's decision and
was removed from the game. Los
ing Christman was a big blow to
San Francisco. Besides his triple
he had gotten a single his first
time up and was considered t lie
best hitter on the team.
The fourth inning proved to be
the deciding inning for Stanford
also. The inning began with a
single by Jim Hibbs and ;i free
pass to Pete Middlekauff. Timeli
er then smashed a long 350-foot

out of the inning with the Gaters
scoring only one run.
