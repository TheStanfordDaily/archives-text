# South Africa Victim Of Distortions
## 
### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing article is a reply to
Mark Aculf's story on the ra
cial situation in South Africa
published in the Daily last
quarter. This article was rts
reived by the Daily through a
Stanford graduate who is a per
sonal acquaintance of (lie au
thor. "For reasons of personal
safety," the article was signed
only with the noin-de-plume
Serut Abor.
First let me establish my cre
dentials. I was born and educated
in England and emigrated to
South Africa some seventeen
years ago, and now have consid
erable business interests in vari
ous parts of this Continent and
Europe.
My professional responsibilities
dem a n d extensive travelling
throughout this Continent and I
am in almost daily contact with
Cabinet Ministers and Senior
Government Officials. Ambassa
dors. Trade Commissioners, Bank
Presidents and other individuals
whose lives have an impact on j
national policy.
FROM CAIRO to Cape Town, j
from Dakar to Mombasa, 112 move!
around Afrira and am subjected 1
to the kaleidoscope of its rapidly
changing political scenes, and
bombarded with facts and propa
gan d a, statistics and special
pleadings from the sources men
tioned above and many more be
sides.
South Africa is a victim of over-;
simplified distortions and any
method, fair or foul, that can be;
used to deride its present rulers
or its white population is consid
ered quite fair by people who
normally have the highest stand
ards of integrity.
Even the opponents of the Ver
woerd regime in South Africa,
are being driven into a common
front with him in order to defend
their country against the tidal j
wave of hate and invective t ha t
pours out continuously from
many who are in no position to
criticize.

I AM AN opponent of the Vcr
vvoerd regime and have consist
ently voted against it in our elec
tions. However, this does not
mean that I believe that Ver- j
woerd and his Cabinet are insin-1
cere men or are stupid. In fact I !
believe the opposite to be the case ;
from personal contact with many j
of them.
Further, world reaction is driv
ing many white South Africans
to accept that Verwoerd's view of
the situation may have a great
deal of merit. Thus the overseas
critics of Verwoerd and his poli
cies arc achieving the precise op- j
posite of what they set out to at
tain. that is. unless their object
is the destruction of South Africa
by making it impossible for coun
sels of reason and tolerance to
prevail.
Unfortunately, the article in
question will have this kind of re
sult since it is full of half truths
and blatant falsehoods.
★ ★ ★
THE FIRST sentence starts
with one of these and was to the
effect that one in every twelve
adult South Africans is in jail.
The facts are that in December
1963 there were 68,732 people in
prison in this country out of a
total population of 16Ms million.
Under the 90-day clause, 3,350
people were detained, but by the
end of the year all except one had
either been released after ques
tioning or charged with sabotage.
At present, in February 1964,
there are 70 people so detained.
You go on to say that the only
person a 90-day prisoner may see
is the Federal Minister of Justice
who put him away in the first
place. This is not true, such a per
son is entitled to be visited by a
Magistrate once a week, and so
far no criticism from overseas
has been made of our Courts —
which are acknowledged to be im
partial.
Political meetings are held by
these and other organzations and
th e government is criticized
openly and in the strongest terms.
The death penalty can only be in
voked if high treason is involved,
but I believe this is the same in
your country.
In the fourth paragraph, a fur
ther statement is made which is
flagrantly untrue. This is to the
effect that any person in South
Africa not of the white race must
carry on his person at all times
a complicated set of identification
papers and a pass to bo in the
area where he works and perhaps
lives.
THE TRUTH is that Coloreds'
and Indians have identity cards
in the same way as the whites do,'
and only Africans carry reference!
books. Some sort of document is
necessary for control, since there
are believed to be a million for
eign Africans in South Africa who
drift across the borders to find ;
work. When Americans go to!
Kuropr they have to carry n pass- 1

port which they have to produce
even when they check in at a
hotel. I do not defend our pass leg
islation, but at least let us try
and put it in perspective.
In paragraph eleven, it is stated
that the Strydom Administration
eliminated the Cape Coloreds
from the voting rolls, the infer
ence presumably being that, the
Cape Coloreds are deprived of
the vote.
★ * ★
THIS IS NOT true, they were
placed in separate voter rolls be
cause it was alleged that they
held a balance of power in several
Constituencies a n d candidates
were making appeals directed
largely at the Coloreds in order to
get into Parliament in those areas.
This contention may not be cor
rect, but it does not alter the fact
that your statement is totally
wrong.
It is true that Albert Luthuli
lis under house arrest and there
lis much vocal opposition to this
tin our country. However, your
I statement that all citizens are pro
hibited from conversing with him
is untrue. Only t ho very small
number of persons who, like
Chief Luthuli, are banned under
the Suppression of Commuism
Act, for obvious reasons, pre
vented from conversing with him.
All others are free to do so.
Paragraph eighteen contains
the most extraordinary statement
j in your whole article and this is
! to the effect that the only organ
ized white opposition is the Lib
eral Party, headed by Alan Pa
ton. This statement is complete
fantasy since we have an elected
Parliament with 106 Government
Party members and -19 members
in the official Opposition headed
by Sir de Villicrs Graaff.
THI-] PROGRESSIVE Party has
j one member in Parliament, Mrs.
Helen Su/man. There are also
numerous organized opposition
groups such as the Black Sash
movement and anti-Government

organizations such as the S.A. In
stitute of Race Relations. Most
English-language newspapers are
outspokenly anti-Government.
The further statement that the
government is even considering
the drafting of women, has obvi
ously been included to give th e
impression that the whole coun
try is like an armed camp.

YOUR ARTICLE was shown by
me to many Americans living in
this country, and their reaction
was the same as mine in every
case. Would it not tie better for
you to use your considerable in
fluence to promote a calmer at
mosphere where sound and rea
sonable reforms become a p o s
sibility.
To use the words of Pope John
"there are some souls, particu
larly endowed with generosity,
who. in finding situations w li e r e
the requirements of justice are
not satisfied or are not satisfied
in full, feel enkindled with the de
sire to change the state of things,
as if they wish to have recourse
to something like a revolution."
"It must l>e borne in mind that
to proceed gradually is the law of
life in all its expressions. There
fore in human institutions, too,
it is not possible to renovate for
the better, except by working
from within, and gradually."
The last part of the article in
question is so at variance w i th
the spirit of understanding and
compassion typified by this quota
tion that I feel it does you little
credit. You appear to be looking
forward with some relish to the
prospect of a civil war in South
Africa, and to encourage sanc
tions which can only make the
situation more rigid and make
peaceful change more difficult to
achieve.
FURTHER, THE hardship en
gendered by sanctions would fall,
of course, upon the poorest sec
tion of the population - namely
the Africans, Coloreds and In
dians and the unspeakable suffer

ing of a civil war would fall upon
all inhabitants of this country.
Have you forgotten the misery
of the Congo, which was largely
brought about bv the pressure of
misguided and so-called progres
sive elements overseas which ex
erted every pressure to bundle the
Belgian Administration out of
the territory in the first place?
In spite of your dire predictions
of disaster for South Africa, in
the short space of time since the
article appeared there have been
militaiy revolts in Zanzibar,
Kenya, Tanganyika and the Ga
bon. Ten thousand Watusis have
been slaughtered or mained in
Rwana, but according to views
which are fashionable among the
Afro-Asian Block at the United
Nations, these are simply "inter
nal affairs" which can be loft to
the 1 Africans themselves to sort
out.
Quite rightly, the United States
is taking a strong lino against
what it calls "Cuban subversion
and aggression" in South Amer
ica. Naturally, we support the
United States in this view, but
lit is strange that nobody at thoi
| United Nations appears to feci I
: that there is anything wrong in
the training of Communist sabo
teurs in Red China, Russia, Al
geria and the Congo, with t he
avowed intention of indiscrimi
nately murdering civilians by
sabotage and, if possible, plung
ing Angola, Mozambique, Rhode
sia and South Africa into the
j chaos of civil war.
j It is in the light of the above;
that we must view what you term j
"preparations for war" in So nth
Africa. If your neighbor threatens
to cut your throat, I presume i
there is nothing wrong in seeing
that the front door is bolted.
Your article, and the political
'action which it suggests is just
lone further step along a sordid
{path. Its lack of objectivity, its,
I failure to present a reasonably
l balanced picture and its blatant i
! misrepresentations are cause for
j despair among those, like myself,
who wish to see change come
'peacefully and rationally. The
heady emotions generated by
your type of hot-house presenta
tion can do nothing but hinder ■
I this objective.
Obviously, we can have little
I respect for United Nations Com-j
| mittees, bearing in mind that the
i last one to visit this country was
1 headed by a man who was an
alcoholic. After extensive investi
gation of affairs down here, he
i finally signed a statement to the
; effect that nothing in this country
constituted a threat to world
j peace. He retracted this statc
; ment as a result of pressure from
; the Afro-Asian Block when he
reached New York and accused
, his fellow committee members,
who refused to retract with him,
of accepting bribes.

THE FACTS concerning this
I last mission are well-known in
! South Africa, but are probably
not well-known to Americans
i since they do not fit in with the
1 public image of the United Na
tions as a repository for all the
| justice and wisdom in the world.
In conclusion, it is apparent that
the stigma of the world is being
! applied to all South Africans sim
ply because of the policy of apar
theid. However much one may
criticize this country, it is weil
i to realize that to find a practical
I alternative is by no means easy.
Many of us believe in the equality
of all races under the law, b u t
freedom does not mean license,
nor does it mean the facile accep
| tance of policies like "one man
| one vote" which clearly lead to
bamboozling a primitive electro
rate and ultimate enslavement
I through the ballot box.
! In spite of its problems, South
j Africa is a happier, more pro
gressive and stable country than
I anywhere else on this continent.
I As an example, our African hous
! ing and hospitalization schemes
I are unequalled. The standard of
living of our Colored population
iis infinitely higher than else-
I where.
! Our gross national product in
creases at an average of 8 per
cent per annum. We have never
defaulted on an international obii
| gation, paid our Lease-Land Debt
I in cash, and we fought side by
side with the United States in
two World Wars and in Korea. i
! The Roman Catholic Archbishop j
of Bloemfontein stated that t he)
present situation in South Africa,
despite its defects, is stable, se
cure and full of prospects for fu- j
! ture development. He said he was
disturbed by the present situa-.
; tion in South Africa only in so
I far as South Africa had been
made the object of criticism that
! was largely prejudiced or, to say
the least, uninformed.
It would indeed be a pity if j
j malice and hysteria were allowed j
to destroy so much good, and if
the whole tree were burned down t
because some people allege that i
'one of its branches is withered.
