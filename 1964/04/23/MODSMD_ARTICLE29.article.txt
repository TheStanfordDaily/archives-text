## Administration Closing Door To More Than Just Morse 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Frank Morse is suspended;
the administration refuses to
reinstate him. At this point,
even if Mr. Morse were allowed
to register, he probably would
not be able to make up time
already lost and complete the
quarter.
Why then does Mr. Morse
persist in pounding on a closed
door (this time quite intention
ally)? And why do LASSU.
ASSU Judicial Council, KZSU,
the Daily, the members of
Italy Group VII, all past over
seas campus students, other
Stanford students who are
aware of the case, many fac
ulty members, and a few mem
bers of the administration in
sist on watching, encouraging,
even adding their own knocks?
Because Mr. Morse hopes
this door might open, even
after those behind it have
proven deaf to questions,
statements, pleas, and mass
entreaties. And because all the
rest of us, students, faculty,
employees, under the terms of
our respective contracts with
Stanford, could at any lime
suddenly encounter the same
closed door.
The University, we realize,
is probably legally right (cf.
Friedcnthal/Carter letter to
Daily of 14 April). If we con
sider such administrative ac
tion as occurred in the Morse
Case to be morally, humanly
wrong, then is our only choice
to leave Stanford or to aban
don our opinions and convic
tions while we remain?
This is the choice offered
thus far. Then why do we not
pack up our minds and leave?
Perhaps we entertain the hope
that a law is not necessarily
always right, that what is
right is more important than
what is legal, and that there
fore wrong laws can be
changed, wrong decisions re
versed.
We care about. Stanford
enough to want to improve it,
contrary to popular belief, and
want the legal powers that be
to know that their action such
as demonstrated in the case of
Frank Morse vs. Authority can
only result in a Leland Stan
ford Junior University popu
lated by unaware, unthinking.

| afraid to express their views
j or holding no views at all, and

j their jobs well but rather ac
cording to what will least in

of their superiors.
Frank Morse's case is the
case of anyone connected with
Stanford University; the ad
ministration is closing the door
to more than one person.

Editor, The Daily:
A scandalous situation, of
which most people are un
aware. exists on this campus.
The figures of Adam and Eve,
on the mosaic facade of Memo
rial Church arc pictured with
out Navels.
Thus impressionable fresh
men catch sight of these per
nicious pictures, put two and
two together, and decide: "If
Adam was made in the image
of God, and Adam has no
navel; therefore, since I have
a naval I am not made in
Adam's image, and thus I am
not made in the image of God."
No wonder so many Stanford
students loose their religious
faith in Christian teachings.
As a climax to the contro
versy that has arisen over
these umbrageously un-umbil
ical mosaics, we have formed
a committee to counteract
their effect. It is known as the
Navel .ROTC, (Navel Retouch
ing On Triangular Church
facades) and is now petition
ing Dean Winbigler for the
right to add these anatomical
symbols of faith to Adam and
Eve.
But the Dean says adding
navels would be a defacing of
University property, and peo
ple have been suspended for
less. Meanwhile this vicious
limerick circulates through the
undergraduate population:
There was a young man from
Ford Old
Who went to Mem Clui and ex

When he looked up and roared,
"Adam had no umbilical cord!"
