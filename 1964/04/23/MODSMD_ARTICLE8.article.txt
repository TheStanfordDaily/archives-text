# SENATE RACE
## Salinger Campaigns Here 
### JOE KOSENBLOOM 
Pierre Salinger urged that a
"fundamental solution" be found
for the civil rights problem in an
address to a main floor crowd in
Memorial Auditorium yesterday
afternoon.
Campaigning for the Democra
tic nomination for the United
States Senate, he discussed civil
rights and other key issues.
"THE DENIAL of civil rights
particularly the denial of civil
rights to Negroes — has been a
weight on America's conscience
since before we became a nation."
he said. "The discussion period is
really over. Now we have to get
down to the fundamental solu
tion."
The former press secretary for
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson
called the question of civil rights
a "moral issue" which is at the
"heart of our nation's conscience."
He stated, "Our goal is a n d
must be equality of opportunity
the right of access to the fields
that make for human happiness.
Let everyone, of every color and
persuasion, have exactly th e
same opportunity to find himself
good housing, a good job. good
education. This is not only what
we have to do, but what we
should and will do because it is
morally and ethically the right
thing to do."
IN HOPES OF achieving this
goal, the senatorial candidate is
a supporter of the proposed Givil
Rights hill and of the Rumford
Fair Housing Act. But he does
not believe that racial quotas in
employment or the bussing of Ne
gro school children to all-white

schools will solve the problem.!
"If our housing was genuinely I
color-blind there would be no need j
of bussing," he said.
Commenting on foreign policy, j
he said that he favored continued |
United States disarmament since)
his gradual effort is necessary!
to pull the world away from nu- i
clear war," yet he is opposed to
ihe recognition of Red China by!
ihe United States because "t he!
lime is past when that would
have been an effective way to'

! change Chinese policy."
"PLUCKY" PILKKK had much
to say about his attachment to
1 President Kennedy and the years
he spent in Washington. Speak
! ing of Kennedy, he said, "1 try to
i carry out his ideal of public serv-
I ice."
All was not strictly business,
however, as Salinger humorously
i spoke of himself as "an unfit"
j who backed out of a planned 50-
| mile hike "for the best national
• interest."

Pierre Salinger urged that a
"fundamental solution" be found
for the civil rights problem in an
address to a main floor crowd in
Memorial Auditorium yesterday
afternoon.
Campaigning for the Democra
tic nomination for the United
States Senate, he discussed civil
rights and other key issues.
"THE DENIAL of civil rights
particularly the denial of civil
rights to Negroes — has been a
weight on America's conscience
since before we became a nation."
he said. "The discussion period is
really over. Now we have to get
down to the fundamental solu
tion."
The former press secretary for
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson
called the question of civil rights
a "moral issue" which is at the
"heart of our nation's conscience."
He stated, "Our goal is a n d
must be equality of opportunity
the right of access to the fields
that make for human happiness.
Let everyone, of every color and
persuasion, have exactly th e
same opportunity to find himself
good housing, a good job. good
education. This is not only what
we have to do, but what we
should and will do because it is
morally and ethically the right
thing to do."
IN HOPES OF achieving this
goal, the senatorial candidate is
a supporter of the proposed Givil
Rights hill and of the Rumford
Fair Housing Act. But he does
not believe that racial quotas in
employment or the bussing of Ne
gro school children to all-white

schools will solve the problem.!
"If our housing was genuinely I
color-blind there would be no need j
of bussing," he said.
Commenting on foreign policy, j
he said that he favored continued |
United States disarmament since)
his gradual effort is necessary!
to pull the world away from nu- i
clear war," yet he is opposed to
ihe recognition of Red China by!
ihe United States because "t he!
lime is past when that would
have been an effective way to'

! change Chinese policy."
"PLUCKY" PILKKK had much
to say about his attachment to
1 President Kennedy and the years
he spent in Washington. Speak
! ing of Kennedy, he said, "1 try to
i carry out his ideal of public serv-
I ice."
All was not strictly business,
however, as Salinger humorously
i spoke of himself as "an unfit"
j who backed out of a planned 50-
| mile hike "for the best national
• interest."
