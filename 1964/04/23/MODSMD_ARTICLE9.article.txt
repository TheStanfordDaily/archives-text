# MORSE CASE
## Student Resentment High 
### STEVE GRUBER 
Student opinion was running strongly and
unanimously against the administration on the
Frank Morse ease.
That was the finding of an informal, random
poll taken by The Daily yesterday.
Naney Saks, of Faisan House in Florence
Moore, said. "I was at the Italy campus during
the incident. I hadn't heard of il until the trial.
"I talked with one of the professors who was
overseas with us. He told me I hat there was no
unanimous decision to throw Frank out."
Saks continued. "As far as I knew Frank, I held
him in high respect for laking his mother's death
in October as well as lie did. There cannot be any
grounds for dismissal on phychiatric grounds."
Les Brown. Alpha Delta Phi. commented. "Per
haps the University doesn't feel any need to jus
tify this decision to the student body, but the stu
dent body certainly doesn't feel this way. There
could probably be a further meeting of the minds
and a furtherance of understanding it those in
volved would divulge their reasons for the deci
sion."
Mimi Wells, of Brainier, said. "I think it is un
fair to him and for his future if the administra
lion can't give any valid reasons for expelling
him."
A freshman from 'Francos, Jack O'Brien, told
The Daily, "I don't think all the facts have been
brought out. The letter from the professor 111 Italy

has not been brought out, either. The whole thing
has been bungled somewhere along the line."
George Soule, Burbank House, Stern Hall, said,
"If a person can't tie one on and kick in a lew doors
oven in Italy, things arc pretty bad. Unless the
door was in the Vatican, I can't see any point in
i lie suspension."
Another student from Burbank. Bob IVarce,
commented, "1 know of other incidences in Stern
Hall this year which would be better grounds for
suspension. Frank Morse hasn't been treated
fairly.'"
A Chi I J si member, John Bailey, noted that.
"They're being a little strict on Morse. People on
this campus, and particularly Cedro House of Wil
bur Hall, where I lived last year, have done worse
things without any action by the administration."
Dick Curtis. Delta Kappa Epsilon, said. "I do
not agree with this decision. Maybe the University
has something up its sleeve. Why don't they just
take the money for the damages out of his room
deposit ?"
Jane Tiemann, of Branner. told The Daily, "1
think it was unjust to suspend him for an inade
quate reason such as kicking in a door or for
vague phychologieal reasons. Furthermore. I don't
think that ho did it for psychological reasons.
David Ransom commented. "There is an appar
ent dichotomy between how much voice the ad
ministration says the students have in their gov
ernment and how milch voice the} actually have.''
