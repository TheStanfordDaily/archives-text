# Steinberg On Art
## 
### 
"Has contemporary art turned its back on the human condi
dition?" Leo Steinberg, Professor of Art at New York City's Hun-

ter College, probes this question
in a series of two lectures on "The
Human Figure in Art."
The final lecture will be given
today in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
at 4:15 p.m.
TWO DIFFERENT approaches
characterized ancient figurative
sculpture, said Mr. Steinberg in
yesterday's lecture, "The Figure
as Artifact and Ideal."
One approach, that of the Egyp

tian, conceived of sculpture as
squared block. The same concept
governed th e i r architecture:
monolithic, immovable, the decor
ations and hieroglyphics scraped
into the rock.
The other approach, that of the
Greeks, consisted not in modifi
cation but in construction. Greek
sculpture expressed a sense of
plasticity springing from Greek
architecture. Just as a Doric tem
ple consisted of a lintel or cross
piece resting on columns and
crowned by a gable, so a Greek |
statue such as the famous late
Hellenic "Pugilist" was made up
of verticals (legs and a tree
stump > supporting lintelâ€”like
thighs which in turn hold up arms
arranged like gables.
Renaissance art built upon the
ideal of a continuum and in addi
tion discovered the human waist
as a source of movement. In Mi
changelo's God in the Sistine
Chapel, the waist is a central
powerhouse with limbs shooting
out as channels for energy.
Do Vinci's sketches indicate
figures whoso proportions con
form to those the circle and the
square. Thus the artifact of the
Renaissance figure took its form
from an ideal of geometric per
fection.
Today's talk, last in a series of
Leon Sloss. Jr. Memorial Lec
tures in the Humanities, is titled
"The Figure Lost and Retrived."
