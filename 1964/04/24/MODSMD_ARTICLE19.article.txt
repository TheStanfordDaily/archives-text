# Firemen Restore Antique Fire Engine
## 
### 
Stanford firemen are putting
the finishing touches on the lat
est in mid-Victorian fire fighting
equipment — their 1883 model
Ramsey hand-operated fire pump.
The antique, recently exhumed
from the basement of the Stan
ford Museum, has been put into
mint condition by off-duty men,
with three colors of enamel and
plentiful Victorian curlicues in
gold striping.
THE FIREMEN will enter it
in the annual Firemen's Muster
put on by the Mother Lode Fire
men's Association of Sonora in
Columbia State Park May 2
and 3.
Ten of Stanford's huskiest fire
fighters will man the old pumper
in a parade, in a pumping contest,
and later in an all-out water fight
with other old-time pumping
teams.
"HAND - OPERATED doesn't
really describe this thing," noted
Assistant Chief Frank Jurian of
the Stanford Fire Department.
"This pumper requires brute
force — eight men on the side
bars of the pump and two men
holding the hose."

Jurian and his ctew hope to
better a mark of in; : e« set
many years ar ) i: ; .rs of
the same en to.:; r

country.
THE STANFOi.'* | o

when tuned to the ultimate state
of the art, can throw 200 gallons
per minute from its four-inch pis
ton through a 1%-inch hose,
either from a self-contained tank
filled by water bucket, or from
the nearest creek or pool.
It was purchased from a New
York firm eight years before the
University was founded by Sen
ator Stanford to protect his home
and horse-barns.
It remained on active duty until
about 1912, when it was replaced
by automated equipment.
