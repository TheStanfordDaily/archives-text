## 
### 
K.ZSU Radio, in a special
broadcast Tuesday night, pre
sented u |i r o ra in entitled
"!>830." It w is an "exploration
of (he irregularities in the
Morse Case."
The name •»!' tin- program re
ferred to the number of stu
dents who would have liecn
enroled i•> Stanford had Frank
Morse not heen suspended.
The program included a
taped interview with Dr. Mor
ris Zclditch, one of the mem
bers of Ihe council which re
viewed tie* case in Florence,
in answer to a cpiestion, Zel
diteh stated, "5 don't recall
over saying I was in favor of
suspension and in fact, I am
not in favor of suspension."
Tlie program also included
a statement obtained over
transAtluntic cable from Dr.
(auedo Frnlla, Director of
Studies at Florence stating
that his understanding was
that all the member of the
council had agreed on the
susjwnsion and that each had

sent a letter on the case to
Stanford.
Frulla was also quoted from
a statement by Tom Connaiigh
ton, student body president of
the Florentine group, as say
ing "No matter what you guys
do, I'll get to the bottom of
this and there will be more
serious action that any Judicial
Council will take."
The station attempted to
point out the lack of commu
nication between Stanford and
Italy. The program indicated
that the initial decision of the
Dean's office, made with a rec
ommendation of the Disciplin
ary S a 1> c o m ni i t t e e of the
President's Student Affairs
and Services Committee, was
reached without the opinions
of Dr. Zelditeh, who was and
is decidedly opposed to the sus
pension.
The program concluded by
examining the actions of Dr.
Robert Wert, Vice President
and Dean of Undergraduate
Education, in the case. It was

stated that Wert upheld the.
decision to suspend Morse
011 the grounds of former
agreement. The station took
the position I hat Wert, as a
"Court «d Last Resort," should
have looked directly at the
evidence itself with an eye to
ward changing the decision if
necessary.
En a coming broadcast early
next week, station manager
Hal Williams plans to make
the f«illowing statement
"In pointing to these irreg
ularities. we are not saying
that the persons involved have
compromised their integrity.
With regard (o the"Court of
Last Resort" we realized that
Dr. Wert, based his decision
on past agreement, yet we are
suggesting that this is not the
thing to do iu a judicial proc
ess within the University. Here
the student defendant 111 us t
ha\c a true last appeal on the
basis of the evidence and the
verdict, or a channel of final
appeal is a farce."
