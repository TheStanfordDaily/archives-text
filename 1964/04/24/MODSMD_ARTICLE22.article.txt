Bruce Klunder died in a national contest still undcciil 1 It 1
was one hundred years ago between sections of I'
neighbor, and even inside many of us: fear ayainst fanb: 1
despair contesting hope.
"Bruce Klunder was a private soldier in the kittle foi ;
now joineil in all the land.
"Ili.s death was in the mud of an excavation, si ran I
soldier in trench or foxhole: sudden, not expected tin n
seemingly so useless and against the dark back. ■ un.i
made fatherless.

"And if for one soldier we say. "Right and proper is it to die for one's fatherland,"
then of this other soldier we must say. "Greater lvoe hath no man than this, that
man lay down his life for his friends."
"I! nice Klunder did not seek to be a martyr. He did not expect to die last Tuesday
afternoon. Hut lie was one of those ministers of the church who had joined up,
n -.ponding to the call of Jesus Christ, refusing in the national crisis to stand safe
and eloquent behind a pulpit.
He died for the cause of racial justice. He died for equal opportunity for all Amer
irails. He died for freedom for men to he men. And he died iti the front lines of
those who. having pledged themselves to non-violcnce. are pledged aslo to stay in
the struggle until the victory is won,
I low shall we best remember the Christian soldier? Cleveland has often led the
nation. Let Cleveland now again show us all the way. Let this city build the best
racially-integrated school system in all America.
"Out of this sacrifice there must arise new unity and dedication of the whole com
munity to the new pattern of justice which this day demands. Let there be no
attempt to assess the blame. Let there be no further divisions. It will be futile to
protest that this should no have happened here.
"(Snce more let death mark a new beginning."
Bruce Klunder's death was an accident. Yet his being in the place where such
an event could occur was no accident. He knew that faithfulness requires this
kind of involvement and risk. Few of us are required to give our lives as he
did; but all of us are called to the same faithfulness and the same involvement.
This week we at Stanford have the unusual opportunity of sharing in a confer
ence kcynotcd by Martin Luther King and given leadership by persons of wide
experience. It is an opportunity that should not be missed. For some it will
be a time of preparation for participation in this summer's Mississippi project.
However, Mississippi is not the only, or even the most important, battleground
in the revolution. For many the conference can be a time of preparation for
the struggle in our home communities and here in Palo Alto.
Significant opportunities for involvement in the sturggle right here in the Mid-
Peninsula area arc many. In addition to tutoring, study hall, and service proj
ect in East Palo Alto sponsored by the Stanford Christian Council. This project
will involve exploration and service in the social problem areas of urbanization,
industrialization, and automation.
We must begin with confession, but let us hasten to involvement in the revolu
tion in which we perceive the activity of God,
