## Stanford Opens Peru Campus

St nfords' newest foreign cam

South America's first school of
bt siness operating exclusively on
I the graduate level.

i( ia, and the Universidad

j Lima.

In general, the new institution's
curriculum will be patterned
after that of the Graduate School
of Business here at Stanford. Its
initial 10-man faculty, drawn
mainly from Stanford, will be
phased out steadily, placing the
graduate school in the hands of a
full-time Peruvian faculty by
1969.
INDIVIDUALS successfully
completing an 11-month acad
emic program will be certified
by the faculty to receive appro
priate advanced degrees from
their undergraduate Peruvian uni
versity. Courses offered will pa
rallel those normally given stu
dents seeking a Master of Busi
ness Administration degree in
this country.
Assistant Prof. Alan Coleman
of the Stanford Graduate School
of Business will direct the new
school during its first three years.
Other members of the faculty
from Stanford include Frank
Shallenberger, professor Indus
trial management, Lylc JacoT>sen,
associate professor of accounting,
and Robert Rehder, lecturer in
business management.
Stanford's decision to invest ap
proximately 20 man-years of fac
ulty time in this new project
stems from recognition of the
key role of education in the Alli
ance for Progress and the respon
sibility of major universities in
helping achieve its goals, says
GBS Dean Ernest Arbuckle.
ACCORDING TO a 4-man sur
vey team from Stanford, three
factors have produced "a genuine
demand for rapid expansion in
the supply of managers" for
Peru:
• 1) population growth of
more than three per cent annu
ally—one of the highest in South
America;
• 2) the desire for higher liv
ing standards, sought by the Alli
ance for Progress; and
• 3) recognition that primary
production activities alone can
not generate the needed increase
in production and employment.
Most important from the sur
vey group's standpoint is the
"widespread and conscious aware
ness" of the need for trained man
agerial talent in Peru. Many new

and expanded programs have
been started by some of the Peru
vian universities to help plug up
the managerial holes in Peru.
ESAN will supplement rather
than compete with these pro
grams.
Development of human re
sources has become the most re
alistic and reliable measure of
national advancement, said Dean
Arbuckle. A recent study cover
ing 75 countries showed a strong
relationship between educational
achievements and national eco

nomic development.
"IN THE WORLD market
place of today, no nation can al
ford to be without the services
of competent managers, \v hose
tools, whose knowledge and skills
in administration are fully com
petitive. And in an economy
which is changing and expanding
as rapidly as Peru's there must
be an acceleration of the devel
opment of managerial talent if
economic growth is not to be cur
tailed for lack of business leader
ship."

ACCORDING TO a 4-man sur
vey team from Stanford, three
factors have produced "a genuine
demand for rapid expansion in
the supply of managers" for
Peru:
• 1) population growth of
more than three per cent annu
ally—one of the highest in South
America;
• 2) the desire for higher liv
ing standards, sought by the Alli
ance for Progress; and
• 3) recognition that primary
production activities alone can
not generate the needed increase
in production and employment.
Most important from the sur
vey group's standpoint is the
"widespread and conscious aware
ness" of the need for trained man
agerial talent in Peru. Many new

and expanded programs have
been started by some of the Peru
vian universities to help plug up
the managerial holes in Peru.
ESAN will supplement rather
than compete with these pro
grams.
Development of human re
sources has become the most re
alistic and reliable measure of
national advancement, said Dean
Arbuckle. A recent study cover
ing 75 countries showed a strong
relationship between educational
achievements and national eco

nomic development.
"IN THE WORLD market
place of today, no nation can al
ford to be without the services
of competent managers, \v hose
tools, whose knowledge and skills
in administration are fully com
petitive. And in an economy
which is changing and expanding
as rapidly as Peru's there must
be an acceleration of the devel
opment of managerial talent if
economic growth is not to be cur

"IN THE WORLD market
place of today, no nation can al
ford to be without the services
of competent managers, \v hose
tools, whose knowledge and skills
in administration are fully com
petitive. And in an economy
which is changing and expanding
as rapidly as Peru's there must
be an acceleration of the devel
opment of managerial talent if
economic growth is not to be cur
tailed for lack of business leader
ship."
