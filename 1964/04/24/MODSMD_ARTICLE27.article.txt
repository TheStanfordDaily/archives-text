## Dean Arbuckle Reports 
### 
Total expenditures of the Stan
ford Graduate School of Business
neared the $2 million mark las
year—and will increase 50 per
cent by 1970, Dean Ernest C. Ar
buckle recently reported. Less
than half this amount comes from
student tuition and fees, Arbuckle
noted. The balance is provided
through alumni, foundations, cor
portations, and other pxdvate
sources.
Arbuckle presented the School's
first comprehensive annual report
at a news conference preceding
a joint meeting of the Stanford
and Harvard Business School
Alumni Clubs at the St. Francis
Hotel. During the past decade, he
said, the number of students re
cciving master's degrees in busi
ness administration has nearly
doubled nationally. Anticipating
a sharply increased demand for
college professors in business ad
ministration, the university has
nearly tripled its PH.D. enroll
ment in the past five years (from
59 to 64.
"Management today is in tran
sition — from an art based pri
marily upon experience and ad
ministrative skills to a profession
based on an increasingly struc

tured body of knowledge of sub
stantial intellectual content," Ar
buckle commented.
"A business school provides a
logical bridge between the busi
nessman and the scholar. In this
capacity, we have the obligation
of making available to the busi
ness community the applied
knowledge of our faculty who
represent a cross-section of dis
ciplines."
Stanford has also made a ma
jor commitment to management
education on a world-wide basis.
Through its International Cerner
for the Advancement of Manage
ment Education, financed by a
$3.5 million Ford Foundation
grant, the Business School h a s
established long-term ties with
40 institutions in 23 countries in
Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
