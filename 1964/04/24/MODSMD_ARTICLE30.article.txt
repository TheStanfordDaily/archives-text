## 
### ROBERT HARTER 
Metropolitan Opera bass, Je
rome Hines, will present what
promises to be the best concert
of the spring season at St a n
ford, tonight at 8 : 15 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium.
Currently celebrating his seven
teenth nationwide tour under the
direction of impressario Sol Hur
ok, the great basso will sing ex
cerpts from Rossini's "The Bar
ber of Seville," and in costume,
will sing and perform parts of
Mozart's "Don Giovanni" and the
final scene from Moussorgsky's
"Boris Godounov." Also on the
program will bo Italian and Ger
man songs, including Shubert's
"Der Erlkoenig."
IIINES WAS the first Ameri
can-born singer to perform "Boris
Godounov" in the Soviet Union,
and he thrilled his listeners with
his powerful portrayal of the Rus
sian Tsar. His overwhelming suc
cess was complimented by his
ability to converse with his hosts
in their language, and was con
firmed by their invitation which
will take him back to Russia in
the fall of 1964.
He is meticulous in the study of

the characters he portrays; it was
by eliciting the opinions of twelve
prominent psychiatrists that he
gained insight into the psychologi
cal motivations of his protagonist
and by studying historical writ
ings of the time that he acquired
a feeling for the Tsar's external
situation.
His actual performance is as
exacting as his mathematics de
gree from UCLA implies, and it
was while he was a freshman at
UCLA that Hines made his pro
fessional debut with the Los An
geles Civic Light Opera Company.
THE FOLLOWING season he
made his bow wilh the San Fran
cisco Opera Company as Monte
rone in "Rigoletto," and by the
time he received his B.A. degree
in 1943. he had already appeared
as a soloist at the Hollywood Bowl
(where he was the winner of the
Young Artists Competition) and
as a soloist with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic under John Bar
birolli. It was while he was doing
graduate work in physics at
UCLA however, that he began the
ascent which has placed him
among the top operatic bassos in
the country.

IIINES WAS the first Ameri
can-born singer to perform "Boris
Godounov" in the Soviet Union,
and he thrilled his listeners with
his powerful portrayal of the Rus
sian Tsar. His overwhelming suc
cess was complimented by his
ability to converse with his hosts
in their language, and was con
firmed by their invitation which
will take him back to Russia in
the fall of 1964.
He is meticulous in the study of

the characters he portrays; it was
by eliciting the opinions of twelve
prominent psychiatrists that he
gained insight into the psychologi
cal motivations of his protagonist
and by studying historical writ
ings of the time that he acquired
a feeling for the Tsar's external
situation.
His actual performance is as
exacting as his mathematics de
gree from UCLA implies, and it
was while he was a freshman at
UCLA that Hines made his pro
fessional debut with the Los An
geles Civic Light Opera Company.
THE FOLLOWING season he
made his bow wilh the San Fran
cisco Opera Company as Monte
rone in "Rigoletto," and by the
time he received his B.A. degree
in 1943. he had already appeared
as a soloist at the Hollywood Bowl
(where he was the winner of the
Young Artists Competition) and
as a soloist with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic under John Bar
birolli. It was while he was doing
graduate work in physics at
UCLA however, that he began the
ascent which has placed him
among the top operatic bassos in
the country.
