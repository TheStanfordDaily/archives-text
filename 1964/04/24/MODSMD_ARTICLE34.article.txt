# WSU POTENT OPPONENT
## Thinclads In Tough Meet 
### TOM ELIAS 
Stanford's track team hits the
road this afternoon in quest of!
its third dual meet victory of the
season. The opponent this week
end is a surprisingly strong team
of Cougars at Rogers Field on
the campus of Washington State |
University in Pullman.
Stanford's coach, Payton Jor
dan. pessimistic as usual, hesi
tates to predict a victory. But
he does say that his team is
"ready to compete. We've got a
few minor injuries a n d Steve
Arch won't be with us up there,
but we're in as good shape as
we've been in all season."
The Daily scratch sheet bears
out Jordan's reluctance to take
anything for gianted. Conceding
victories to Stanford in both re
lays, the scratch sheet comes up
with the Tribe a winner by the
smallest possible margin, 73 72.
Shotputter Steve Aich, as his
coach mentioned, will not partic
ipate in the meet. Arch must
stay on the Farm to take a Biol
ogy test. This will cost Stanford
at least three points, but it is

the only spot where the Indians
will have a lack of their usual
! talent.
Another graduate test, the Med
ical College Admissions tost, will
be taken in Spokane tomorrow
morning by Paul Schlicke an d
Jack Chappie. This will not affect
Chappie at all, as he will still
compete in his shotput specialty
and is expected to win it.
But Schlicke, because of the
tests, will be unable to run his
usual double of the mile and two
mile. The star junior will only
run the two mile. He should win,
but c a n expect some pressure
from Indian Weym Kirkland,
whom Jordan feels is finally
ready for a good race, and WSU's
John Valiant, who has posted a
9:06.3 on a slow track.
Jordan is using Harry MeCalla,
Dave Deubner and Harley An
drews in the mile. He figures An
drews will be able to handle any
opposition WSU coach Hod Enos
can throw his way. And MeCalla
and Deubner may just be able to
beat Valiant in the first event of
his double.

The meet will also be marke 1
by a double by Redskin 801.
Milt/ in the 440 and the hall' mile.
This will be the first time Miltz
has run this double this season.
Competing on Rogers Field
has a special signifiance for In
dians Schlicke and Bill Pratt.
Both Schlicke and 88<) man Pratt
set state high school records that
still stand on the same track
where they will be running to
morrow. At the time Pratt was
running for YVenatchee High and
Schlicke was running for Gon
zaga Prep of Spokane. Pratt's
time was 1:55.9 an d Schlieke's
4:19.3 when in high school.
Stanford will have a big advan
tage over the Cougars in the dis
tances and in two field events.
But there the domination ends. !
Steve Cortright, second place j
winner in the NCAA high hurdles
last summer, will be lucky to win
tomorrow in that event. This will

be only the second high hurdles
race for Corlright since the be
ginning of March. And WSU
boasts two 14.5 men.
Corlright will also have to
hustle to beat Jim Allen in the
intermediate hurdles. Allen, the
fourth best intermediate hurdler
in the world last year, appears to
be fully recovered from the mus
cle pull that was bothering him
earlier this spring.
Javelin throwers George Porter
and Bob Stoecker will have to
better their all-time bests to beat
Cougar Buck Kipe, who hurled
the spear 245-5 last week.
Stoecker and Cortright will be
Ihe real workhorses for the Tribe
tomorrow. Corlright competes in
at least three events, both hur
dles and the triple jump, and
Stoecker, in the absence of Arch,
will have to throw the s'.iot in
addition to his usual discus and
javelin duties.

Both Schlicke and 88<) man Pratt
set state high school records that
still stand on the same track
where they will be running to
morrow. At the time Pratt was
running for YVenatchee High and
Schlicke was running for Gon
zaga Prep of Spokane. Pratt's
time was 1:55.9 an d Schlieke's
4:19.3 when in high school.
Stanford will have a big advan

tances and in two field events.
But there the domination ends. !
Steve Cortright, second place j
winner in the NCAA high hurdles
last summer, will be lucky to win
tomorrow in that event. This will

be only the second high hurdles
race for Corlright since the be
ginning of March. And WSU
boasts two 14.5 men.
Corlright will also have to
hustle to beat Jim Allen in the
intermediate hurdles. Allen, the
fourth best intermediate hurdler
in the world last year, appears to
be fully recovered from the mus
cle pull that was bothering him
earlier this spring.
Javelin throwers George Porter
and Bob Stoecker will have to
better their all-time bests to beat
Cougar Buck Kipe, who hurled
the spear 245-5 last week.
Stoecker and Cortright will be
Ihe real workhorses for the Tribe
tomorrow. Corlright competes in
at least three events, both hur
dles and the triple jump, and
Stoecker, in the absence of Arch,
will have to throw the s'.iot in
addition to his usual discus and
javelin duties.
Stanford's track team hits the
road this afternoon in quest of!
its third dual meet victory of the
season. The opponent this week
end is a surprisingly strong team
of Cougars at Rogers Field on
the campus of Washington State |
University in Pullman.
Stanford's coach, Payton Jor
dan. pessimistic as usual, hesi
tates to predict a victory. But
he does say that his team is
"ready to compete. We've got a
few minor injuries a n d Steve
Arch won't be with us up there,
but we're in as good shape as
we've been in all season."
The Daily scratch sheet bears
out Jordan's reluctance to take
anything for gianted. Conceding
victories to Stanford in both re
lays, the scratch sheet comes up
with the Tribe a winner by the
smallest possible margin, 73 72.
Shotputter Steve Aich, as his
coach mentioned, will not partic
ipate in the meet. Arch must
stay on the Farm to take a Biol
ogy test. This will cost Stanford
at least three points, but it is

the only spot where the Indians
will have a lack of their usual
! talent.
Another graduate test, the Med
ical College Admissions tost, will
be taken in Spokane tomorrow
morning by Paul Schlicke an d
Jack Chappie. This will not affect
Chappie at all, as he will still
compete in his shotput specialty
and is expected to win it.
But Schlicke, because of the
tests, will be unable to run his
usual double of the mile and two
mile. The star junior will only
run the two mile. He should win,
but c a n expect some pressure
from Indian Weym Kirkland,
whom Jordan feels is finally
ready for a good race, and WSU's
John Valiant, who has posted a
9:06.3 on a slow track.
Jordan is using Harry MeCalla,
Dave Deubner and Harley An
drews in the mile. He figures An
drews will be able to handle any
opposition WSU coach Hod Enos
can throw his way. And MeCalla
and Deubner may just be able to
beat Valiant in the first event of
his double.

The meet will also be marke 1
by a double by Redskin 801.
Milt/ in the 440 and the hall' mile.
