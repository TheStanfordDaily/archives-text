# Cal Rowers Favored Over Tribe Saturday
## 
### DOUG SCHWAB 
The big meet of the year for
ihe crew comes up this Saturday
against Cal. It will begin at !>
a.m. at the Redwood City Yacht
Harbor. In the past three years
Stanford has not fared well
against the perennially strong
Cal varsity boat, and this year's
crew will tie no exception as
nranv people expect Cal to re
present the United States in the
Olympics this summer at Tokyo.
This year's Cal boat beat UCLA
and USC in a three-way meet, but
two weeks ago Stanford outlasted
USC in a regatta at Redwood
City, and has made easy fare of
Oregon State in iwo meets in the
last two weeks.
Cm I is expected to take an early
lead Saturday as they take their
start at 44 strokes per minute
;ind then drop to 36. Stanford will
start at 36 or 37, and drop to 32
speeding up at the finish. The
varsity boat has moved very well
at the low rate, and the outcome
of the race will be determined by
how well it compares with the
faster 1 Cal speed.
The result of the meet will de
pend very heavily on the JV and
frosh boats. Stanford has a very
strong JV crew, and it will use
the same race plan as the varsity
boat. The frosh have always done

well against Cal. and are very
fast this year. They will row the
body of their race at a 35.
The Stanford varsity boating is
as follows: Bow, Frank Hubbard;
2, Bruce Erickson; 3, Dave Rob
bins; 1. John Elder; 5, Carl Long
lev; 6, Pete Whelan (captain i; 7,
Larr> Hough; Stroke, Larry
Claassen: Coxswain, Ric Ceder
