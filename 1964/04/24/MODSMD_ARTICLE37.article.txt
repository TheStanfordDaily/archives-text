# The 						Inside Pitch,
## Strongest Conference Is Together Again PETE KING 
### 
Just about the most encouraging sports news on ihe Coast this
year (with the possible exception of the success of Walt Hazzard
& Co.), is the rejuvenation of the Pacific Coast Conference. Just
three weeks ago, Oregon and Oregon Slate were welcomed back into
the fold completing the former eight-s-hool league, with the excep
tion of Idaho, which hardly matter .-; since Idaho teams merely served
the purpose of keeping everyone else out of the cellar.
At any rate, the resurrection means that the conference with the
most all-round power in the country is once again halo and hearty.
One glance at the record-book confirms that statement. The PCC
(or whatever its name is) is completely dominant in spring sports,
and is definitely above average in the rest.
The most consistent power is in tennis, where CSC and UCLA
have traded the NCAA title, with one exception, for 13 years. It?
track, conference schools have won the NCAA meet 10 times since
1945, with six seconds and six thirds. Last year, the finish was USC,
Stanford, Oregon. No less than 22 world records and 12 more Ameri
can records have been set since the war.
One of the eight baseball teams has finished in the top five 11
times in that period, with six first places.
COAST CLEANS I I*
In crew, the West Coast consistently cleans up. Washington ami
California have finished first or second in the IRA lace 10 times
since 1
In swimming, the conference is second only to the Big Ten. USC
won the NCAA meet this year, and Si an ford had ('hp nation's bes'
water polo squad. Stanford has boasted two championship golf teams ;
since the war.
Football is a touchier point, with only a 193-171 intetsectional !
record: But recent Rose Bow-s and also some upsets over Big Ten
teams have indicated growing strength. As it is, only the Big Ten j
and ihe Southeast Conference have any claim to superiority. But
football is only one sport.
In basketball, too, although the Coast isn't supreme, the league
is better than most. Twelve All-Americans and 13 NCAA finishes
of at least fifth in the past 45 years isn't bad. For five of the last six
years, a conference team has made the four-team finals, the most
recent entrant being the most successful.
LEGACY OF BITTERNESS
If tiie PCC is that great, why did it break up? When one reads
the newspapers of eight years ago, the amazing Ihing is that then !
ever WAS a resurrection. For in 19.16 and the ensuing two years, tin'
conference was engulfed in such vicious, imid-slinging bitterness and
mutual distrust as has rarely been seen in collegiate athletics.
The first shocker came when Washington was banned for two j
years from conference ratings and post-season activity and fined
$53,000. The drastic penalty was for a "slush fund" with which a
private club was handing out money to athletes above and beyond j
the letter of the league rules.
Two weeks later came the big bomb. UCLA was put on proba- >
tion in all sports for throe years, fined $100,000 and its football sen- j
iors allowed to play only five games. The charge was thai booster
groups had sneakily passed under-the-table money to help pay an
athlete's way through school. Another charge was made that ath
letes with a job were working only a few hours a week, yet receiv
ing full pay.
Immediately UCLA sportsmen lashed back at tlie conference di
rectors. claiming the other colleges were equally guilty. "Why us?"
they wailed. "The $75 per quarter limit on student aid is way too
low. Cal and USC pay their athletes just as much, if not more. They
have to, for Ihe men to afford to stay in school."
The upshot was that USC and Cal received lighter probation, and
that USC football seniors, including Jon Arnett, wore ineligible for
five games.
STANFORD CAUGHT IN MIDDLE
Stanford was caught in the middle. Other schools disliked Stan- !
ford's purist attitude and were resentful that they wore slapped with j
penalties, but Stanford somehow got free.
Tempers were short for quite a while. Finally, (he four penalized
schools withdrew from the conference, causing its collapse. Tempers
cooled enough for Stanford < > enter the Hiu Fhe. Three years later,
WSU made il the Iliu" Si v.
Chief factor' in the re-grouping was the return of mutual trust,
although money was a compelling reason. With only lour league
football games, the Big Five schools were forced to schedule more
intersections! games. This necessity deeply cut into the gate. Old
timers didn't want to see Cal play Kansas State, when the big game
in their day was Cal-Oregon.
So that means that for several years, man} team* will play only
four conference football games, because of a sillv college scheduling
custom of booking games seven years in advance.
But in all other sports there should be a full eight team schedule
next year for the nation's most powerful conference.

The first shocker came when Washington was banned for two j
years from conference ratings and post-season activity and fined
$53,000. The drastic penalty was for a "slush fund" with which a
private club was handing out money to athletes above and beyond j
the letter of the league rules.
Two weeks later came the big bomb. UCLA was put on proba- >
tion in all sports for throe years, fined $100,000 and its football sen- j
iors allowed to play only five games. The charge was thai booster
groups had sneakily passed under-the-table money to help pay an
athlete's way through school. Another charge was made that ath
letes with a job were working only a few hours a week, yet receiv
ing full pay.
Immediately UCLA sportsmen lashed back at tlie conference di
rectors. claiming the other colleges were equally guilty. "Why us?"
they wailed. "The $75 per quarter limit on student aid is way too
low. Cal and USC pay their athletes just as much, if not more. They
have to, for Ihe men to afford to stay in school."
The upshot was that USC and Cal received lighter probation, and
that USC football seniors, including Jon Arnett, wore ineligible for
five games.
STANFORD CAUGHT IN MIDDLE
Stanford was caught in the middle. Other schools disliked Stan- !
ford's purist attitude and were resentful that they wore slapped with j
penalties, but Stanford somehow got free.
Tempers were short for quite a while. Finally, (he four penalized
schools withdrew from the conference, causing its collapse. Tempers
cooled enough for Stanford < > enter the Hiu Fhe. Three years later,
WSU made il the Iliu" Si v.
Chief factor' in the re-grouping was the return of mutual trust,
although money was a compelling reason. With only lour league
football games, the Big Five schools were forced to schedule more
intersections! games. This necessity deeply cut into the gate. Old
timers didn't want to see Cal play Kansas State, when the big game
in their day was Cal-Oregon.
So that means that for several years, man} team* will play only
four conference football games, because of a sillv college scheduling
custom of booking games seven years in advance.
But in all other sports there should be a full eight team schedule
next year for the nation's most powerful conference.
Just about the most encouraging sports news on ihe Coast this
year (with the possible exception of the success of Walt Hazzard
& Co.), is the rejuvenation of the Pacific Coast Conference. Just
three weeks ago, Oregon and Oregon Slate were welcomed back into
the fold completing the former eight-s-hool league, with the excep
tion of Idaho, which hardly matter .-; since Idaho teams merely served
the purpose of keeping everyone else out of the cellar.
At any rate, the resurrection means that the conference with the
most all-round power in the country is once again halo and hearty.
One glance at the record-book confirms that statement. The PCC
(or whatever its name is) is completely dominant in spring sports,
and is definitely above average in the rest.
The most consistent power is in tennis, where CSC and UCLA
have traded the NCAA title, with one exception, for 13 years. It?
track, conference schools have won the NCAA meet 10 times since
1945, with six seconds and six thirds. Last year, the finish was USC,
Stanford, Oregon. No less than 22 world records and 12 more Ameri
can records have been set since the war.
One of the eight baseball teams has finished in the top five 11
times in that period, with six first places.
COAST CLEANS I I*
In crew, the West Coast consistently cleans up. Washington ami
California have finished first or second in the IRA lace 10 times
since 1
In swimming, the conference is second only to the Big Ten. USC
won the NCAA meet this year, and Si an ford had ('hp nation's bes'
water polo squad. Stanford has boasted two championship golf teams ;
since the war.
Football is a touchier point, with only a 193-171 intetsectional !
record: But recent Rose Bow-s and also some upsets over Big Ten
teams have indicated growing strength. As it is, only the Big Ten j
and ihe Southeast Conference have any claim to superiority. But
football is only one sport.
In basketball, too, although the Coast isn't supreme, the league
is better than most. Twelve All-Americans and 13 NCAA finishes
of at least fifth in the past 45 years isn't bad. For five of the last six
years, a conference team has made the four-team finals, the most
recent entrant being the most successful.
LEGACY OF BITTERNESS
If tiie PCC is that great, why did it break up? When one reads
the newspapers of eight years ago, the amazing Ihing is that then !
ever WAS a resurrection. For in 19.16 and the ensuing two years, tin'
conference was engulfed in such vicious, imid-slinging bitterness and

the purpose of keeping everyone else out of the cellar.
At any rate, the resurrection means that the conference with the
most all-round power in the country is once again halo and hearty.
One glance at the record-book confirms that statement. The PCC
(or whatever its name is) is completely dominant in spring sports,
and is definitely above average in the rest.
The most consistent power is in tennis, where CSC and UCLA
have traded the NCAA title, with one exception, for 13 years. It?
track, conference schools have won the NCAA meet 10 times since
1945, with six seconds and six thirds. Last year, the finish was USC,
Stanford, Oregon. No less than 22 world records and 12 more Ameri
can records have been set since the war.
One of the eight baseball teams has finished in the top five 11
times in that period, with six first places.
COAST CLEANS I I*
In crew, the West Coast consistently cleans up. Washington ami
California have finished first or second in the IRA lace 10 times
since 1
In swimming, the conference is second only to the Big Ten. USC
won the NCAA meet this year, and Si an ford had ('hp nation's bes'
water polo squad. Stanford has boasted two championship golf teams ;
since the war.
Football is a touchier point, with only a 193-171 intetsectional !
record: But recent Rose Bow-s and also some upsets over Big Ten
teams have indicated growing strength. As it is, only the Big Ten j
and ihe Southeast Conference have any claim to superiority. But
football is only one sport.
In basketball, too, although the Coast isn't supreme, the league
is better than most. Twelve All-Americans and 13 NCAA finishes
of at least fifth in the past 45 years isn't bad. For five of the last six
years, a conference team has made the four-team finals, the most
recent entrant being the most successful.
LEGACY OF BITTERNESS
If tiie PCC is that great, why did it break up? When one reads
the newspapers of eight years ago, the amazing Ihing is that then !
ever WAS a resurrection. For in 19.16 and the ensuing two years, tin'
conference was engulfed in such vicious, imid-slinging bitterness and
mutual distrust as has rarely been seen in collegiate athletics.
The first shocker came when Washington was banned for two j
years from conference ratings and post-season activity and fined
$53,000. The drastic penalty was for a "slush fund" with which a
private club was handing out money to athletes above and beyond j
the letter of the league rules.
Two weeks later came the big bomb. UCLA was put on proba- >
tion in all sports for throe years, fined $100,000 and its football sen- j
iors allowed to play only five games. The charge was thai booster
groups had sneakily passed under-the-table money to help pay an
athlete's way through school. Another charge was made that ath
letes with a job were working only a few hours a week, yet receiv
ing full pay.
Immediately UCLA sportsmen lashed back at tlie conference di
rectors. claiming the other colleges were equally guilty. "Why us?"
they wailed. "The $75 per quarter limit on student aid is way too
low. Cal and USC pay their athletes just as much, if not more. They
have to, for Ihe men to afford to stay in school."
The upshot was that USC and Cal received lighter probation, and
that USC football seniors, including Jon Arnett, wore ineligible for
five games.
STANFORD CAUGHT IN MIDDLE
Stanford was caught in the middle. Other schools disliked Stan- !
ford's purist attitude and were resentful that they wore slapped with j
penalties, but Stanford somehow got free.
Tempers were short for quite a while. Finally, (he four penalized
schools withdrew from the conference, causing its collapse. Tempers
cooled enough for Stanford < > enter the Hiu Fhe. Three years later,
WSU made il the Iliu" Si v.
Chief factor' in the re-grouping was the return of mutual trust,
although money was a compelling reason. With only lour league
football games, the Big Five schools were forced to schedule more
intersections! games. This necessity deeply cut into the gate. Old
timers didn't want to see Cal play Kansas State, when the big game
in their day was Cal-Oregon.
So that means that for several years, man} team* will play only
four conference football games, because of a sillv college scheduling
custom of booking games seven years in advance.
But in all other sports there should be a full eight team schedule
next year for the nation's most powerful conference.
Just about the most encouraging sports news on ihe Coast this
year (with the possible exception of the success of Walt Hazzard
& Co.), is the rejuvenation of the Pacific Coast Conference. Just
three weeks ago, Oregon and Oregon Slate were welcomed back into
the fold completing the former eight-s-hool league, with the excep
tion of Idaho, which hardly matter .-; since Idaho teams merely served
the purpose of keeping everyone else out of the cellar.
