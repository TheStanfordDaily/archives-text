# Card Batsmen In Spoiler Role In Southland Games
## 
### 
Struggling to keep its record
over .500 and avoid the CIBA
cedar, the Stanford baseball team
is looking up a long hill as it
journeys to L.A. for three games
this weekend.
On Friday the Indians face
UCLA, to whom they have lost
thrice. Then on Saturday they
take on (JSC in a doubleheader.
The Trojans are 11th ranked na
tionally, having basically the
same team that won the NCAA
title last season.
OVERALL, Stanford is 15-12,
but this doesn't reflect the team's
ineptitude in the CIBA. They have
fattened up on teams such as St.
Mary's, USF, and San Jose for
a 13-4 outside record, but stand
a sickly 2-8 in the tough confer
ence.
Coach Dutch Fehring will send
either Mike Connelly or John Ma
son against the Bruins on Friday.
In an earlier contest at Stanford.
Mason pitched a fine game, but
lost. 1-0. He struck out 10 UCLA
batters and walked seven. Mason
leads Connelly in ERA, 5.79 to

(j.I)T.
TWO WEEKS • go Stanford had
USC on the ropes in the ninth inn
ing before Peters n saved a 3-2
USC win. Stanford's pitcher, Dirk
Kovaeevich, hurled some fine
baseball until Gary Sutherland,
USC's top hitter, belted a home
run. Kovaoevich and Terry Dock
en will be the Tribe's mound
hopes for the Saturday double
header. Docken's ERA is a lowly
2.615, best on the team.
Both Kovaoevich and Docken
hold the Cards' only two C T BA
victories, over California.
Lately, team hitting has perked
up a bit. First baseman Bob Iloll
mann, who has been in a slump,
hit two singles against S.F. S.a «-•
Tuesday. He's now playing third
! to leave room for Pete Middle
! kauff at base no. 1. Middlekauff
j has recently added hitting to his
flashj fielding, now averaging
1.250.
IT LOOKS I.IKE Larry Ze no
will pitch Friday. The inconsis
tent Bruin hurler is more often
good than poor, but has been

known to have a disastrous in
ning now '.nd then. On Saturday,
Larry Fisher, who beat the In
dians before, and A 1 Lasas will
probably gei the nod.
