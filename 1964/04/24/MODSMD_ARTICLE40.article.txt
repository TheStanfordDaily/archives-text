An address given in Atlanta, Georgia, by

C&ne hundred years ago and more, President Lincoln
? signed his proclamation of emancipation. It v.as a
revolutionary aim. Today our aim is more revclulCanary
and more far-reaching 1 in fulfillment. It is a revolution
for every red-blooded American. And I must remind you
that even American's blood is red.
Some people are afraid of the word "revolution". No
man of faith should be. "Thy Kingdom come. Thy will he
done on earth as it is in Heaven." ft' that phrase b'ccmes
110 longer a pious drone but a passionate commitment,
it is more revolutionary than the filthy paraphernalia
of Fascism or anything Karl Marx concocted.
I and my friends have just been marching with Raj
mohan Gandhi, grandson of the Mahatma, in the heat
and dust of India. He has led a peaceful march 1,000
miles in protest against the corruption, hatred, impurity
and caste prejudice that is weakening his land.
Gandhi says not everyone who praises his grandfather
lives the Mahatma's spirit. He tells the Indians it is
exploitation to call on Gandhi's name unless you possess
the power to change human nature and turn enemies
into friends.
In new patterns of power unfolding across every con
tinent, revolution to change the aim and character of
humanity is blazing. Let us ensure that blaze creates
more light and less heat. At a time when it is God's will
and man's desiring for everybody—black, brown, while,
yellow and red—to walk with head upheld in dignity,
equality and peace, selfishness alone breaks homes,
divides races, multiplies hate, bedevils the hope of a
moral maturity to match the technological and indus
trial opportunity of our times.
Supposing America, with her Negro and Latin Ameri
can and Caucasian and Indian minorities were able
to proclaim in honesty to the listening earth, 'Tome and
see how all men everywhere are meant to live. We need
you all in our bid to change world history. In this
essential task, black men, white men, all men are needed.
Here in th is land we live like sons and daughters of the
God who created all men equal, planting in each human
heart the knowledge of right and wrong that makes man
different from a beast."
Africa, emerging into freedom, would leap with joy
and clasp hands across the ocean. Asia would turn her
eyes to the West. Latin America would forget the flirta
tion of Fidel Castro and follow the advances of her
comrade in the North. Peking and Moscow would cease
to glare, yellow to red eyeball, at each other as they
realized their plan to take over Mr. U.S.A. was outmoded.
This brings me to a question no man can answer.

What color is God's skin? In fifty years half the earth's
population will he Chinese. The South African govern
ment seems to think Chinese are black. Contrariwise,
because South Africa does much trade with Japan, the
same government says Japanese are white.
Laws are essential. I believe legislation must often
march ahead of the growth in man's character that
makes much legislation unnecessary. But laws—though
in South Africa they change the color of a human f-Uin
—cannot by themselves alter the character of a human
heart.
On the day President Kennedy was assassinated, I
talked with two Negroes. They agreed a civil rights bill
with teeth would probably pass Congress. Then one said,
"Whatever laws pass Congress, I can never trust a white
man. It is in my bones to hate them all." I nless you've
been a white man, you don't know what it means to have
that said to you.
I told those Negroes how I, an ordinary Englishman,
had made the experiment of listening to the voice of
God, the inner voice that speaks to each human heart.
I saw it was the selfishness, arrogance and pride of men
like myself which had caused untold suffcvi? ' '"i
-justice.
When I spoke to the Man Man, detained i?i the Ami
River Camp in Kenya, they covered their laces.
They would not look at a white man. My first words
were, "I was born white. 1 could not help it, could I?"
They began to look at me. It began to slide upon their
understanding il was as immature and ignorant to
hate a man because he was born white, as to hate him
because he was born black, brilliant, foolish, ugly, beau
tiful, big, small, Jew or Arab. When I had finished,
their leaders said, "If we had dreamed white men could

think as we heard you speak today, there would have
been no Mau Mau in Kenya."
Some of these former Mau Mau leaders have become
my friends. They saw white men change. The> learned
that black men, too, could change. They changed. They
now are fighting with people of all races to bring God's
revolution to Africa. They understand thai violence,
sometimes regarded as a good servant, can swifth he
come a bad master, and that history never long remains
on the side of hate. Hate knows no color bar. Neither
does love. Heart power is America's strength. Hate
power is her weakness.
The two Negroes said to me "I)o you think education
and environment can change human nature V"i long
for every man, woman and child io have (he best educa
tion and environment civilization can provide, but
neither environment nor education changed me. God did.
God made men in different colors. A white man's
world—in the sense that a white man because of the
color of his skin, is closer to God than his neighbor—
affronts the will of the Almighty and the conscience of
humanity. So does a black man's wor'cl. So d«'.es a world
of yellow or red domination We need a wonci where al!
men walk ihe earth with the dignity of brotherhood
that should be normal to all who accept the fatherhood
of God.
The Ncsfk'o is neither worse nor Ih I er lhan his
neighbor. The same is true of the white man. We all
have our loftier side, and our more debased.
America will sel the continents free wivri she experi
ences lasting freedom—freedom from the immaturity ol
hate, the underdevelopment of selfish vie.- ; s, am? the in
fantility of impurity and dirt. We exploit our wiie or
somebody else's wife, our neighbor, our business rival,
and scream out against exploitation.

tAfo while men are prone to tell everybody else what
WW to do. Hut we are too proud to listen to the voice of
(*od and, in obedience, learn what to do ourselves. We
preach unity and call ourselves the United kingdom or
the United States. We transfer idealism to the United
Nations but we remain, behind the doors of homes,
offices, churches, deeply divided by jealousy, ambition,
greed or prejudice. 1 pray the black man does not I all
into the white man's ways in this regard.
Today, the long-awaited tide of history Hows toward
the non-white races. That tide will lift burdens of
centuries and wipe out bloodstains in the sands ot time.
He sure it elevates all humanity. You cannot expect
every Negro, any more than every white man, to be a
genius of ability, a paragon of virtue, a miracle of
grace. Hut I hope, pray and expect that the Negro
people of the United States will have the wisdom and
human greatness to avoid mistakes that men like my
self have made.
The black man's chance is surely coming. What will
he do with it? I do not say, "He patient." I say, "Be
passionate for something far bigger than color. Be
passionate for an answer big enough to include even -
body, powerful enough to change everybody, fundamen
tal enough to satisfy the longings for bread, work and
the hope of a new world that lies in the heart of the
earth's teeming millions."
Segregation yesterday. Confrontation today. Trans
formation tomorrow. Let the hands of the black man
stretch out above the heads of governments and nation
alities to welcome all people ready with them to remake
the modern world.
Q jnless we accept a world aim, we may be lost in
narrow disputations. It is difficult, if not impossible,
for others to place confidence in a system of democracy
that preaches inalienable rights of the individual with
its lips but robs men of their rights with its customs.
Yet, nothing would suit the enemies of freedom more
than to see this country tear itself apart, preoccupy ing
itself with internal strife, while dictatorship takes over
the world. Some demagogues, white and black, inside
and outside America, desire to push the problem for the
sake of personal power instead of curing it for the sake
of all people.
It remains my belief that crossless Christians do more
to camouflage the reality of Christ's revolution from
humanity than any Communist or Fascist.
There are sincere men who have no faith in God. To
them it can be said, "Accept the challenge of living

the way you wo*ild wish to see your neighbor live.
Absolute moral standards of honesty, purity, unselfish
ness and love are a yardstick by which all men can
measure their conduct. II you have a standard, it must
be absolute. Otherwise, it is no standard. And those lour
standards may prove a ladder that leads a man toward
faith.
v faith is in modern America. I believe Americans
will arise with a character that convicts, capti
vates and changes nations. I believe those who have
suffered most will show the greatest passion and com
passion lor long-si.ft'cring humanity. I believe those
who have been victims ol the worst discrimination
will be the first to heal the hates and fears of others
because they themselves are Iree Irom fear and hate.
J am convinced men and women who for generations have
drunk the water of tears and eaten the bread ol bitter
ness will give living water and the bread ol lile to
millions, trembling, longing, hoping, waiting, praying,
for the new type of man and the new type ol society that
w ill lead the world into lasting justice, liberty and peace.
Those who have passed through the fires of persecu
tion can hold forth one hand to persecutors and perse
cuted alike, and with the ot v :er uplift o • h 'v">Hom
to illuminate the earth.
