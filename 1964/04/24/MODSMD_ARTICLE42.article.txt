# Student Organizations Should Be Less Regulated
## Editorial 
### 
Tin* refusal ol the Stanlord Law Asso
ciation to deposit its hinds with the Students
Organization Fund has raised the issue of
control of student organizations again.
The Student Affairs and Services Com
mittee is charged with regulating 'on-cam
piis" student organizations and requires them
to deposit all funds with the SOI .
TIIE ORGANIZATIONS must then do
all their hanking according to SOF regula
tions, which include making purchases only
with the approval of the SOF. applying to
the SOF for a "purchase order" tor each item
and in some cases performing some strange
contortions to satisiy the SOF.
This situation applies to "voluntary politi
cal organizations as well as such bodies as
the Stanford Law Association and living
groups.
The purpose of the requirement to sub
mit to financial control of the SOI* is vari
ously given. One verson .says it is to make
sure no student organization runs up hills

for which the University would he liable.
Another says it is to make sure that each pur
chase is done only by authorized individuals.
IN THE FIRST CASE — and this ease
applies particularly to political groups — we
feel other arrangements could be worked
out which would be at the same time more
workable and less restrictive for the groups.
Legal steps could be 4 taken to insure that au
tonomous groups would be totally respon
sible for their own financial obligations.
At the very least, political groups whose
major "ou-campus" activity is merely the
use of University facilities for presenting
speakers or holding meetings could be ex
empted.
If there were a desire on the part ol the
I Diversity to make sure that such a group
did not run up obligations io I lie U niccr.sili/
or ASS( (such as poster costs, auditorium
charges, etc.) it could require a deposit of,
saw 525 to cox ( r costs.
lit most cases even tin's is not applicable.

however, inasmuch as the Political Union '
covers many ol these expenses for public
programs and requires co-sponsorship with
them.
In the second case — authorization of pur
chases — we do not feel the argument is .it
all valid. For one thing, it restores the con
trol over student organizations whfcli the
ASSU gave up last year.
FOR ANOTHER, most student groups
require their president and treasurer to co
sign all purchases, and the SOF does no
more. Finally, no hanks will accept w i t h
drawais from ai: account without the proper
signatures on the checks.
In any event, we feel the University
should recognize a certain amount of sell
control by student organizations. (The eat
ing clubs have "outrolled their own finances
E _

lor years, and quite successfully.)
\\ here possible obligations for their ex
penditures can be levied against the Univer
sity, we feel the University lias a valid case
(>l self interest and sell protection. But we
Feel it could insure its position by some
means oilier than direct control of the organi
zations. lu the second case, we feel the regu
lation is an undesirable one and should be
extended at the most only to residence
groups.
TO MANY ORGANIZATIONS - and
we are confident the Law Association is one
- Stanford is only a small part of their total
program. And regulation should onlv extend
to that part of their program.
