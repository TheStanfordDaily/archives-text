# Our Problem
## 
### 
The meaning of the civil rights confer
ence now in session at Stanford.
The meaning of Martin Luther king Jr.
speaking to an almost all-white audience of

students whose own lives lime been almost
completely free oi discrimination and ma
terial hardship.
I lie meaning is that civil rights lor the
Negro is no longer a problem "oxer there
somewhere,' to be discussed in political
science classes and lorgotten when tin- stu
dents close the classroom door behind them.
The door cannot be shut. The classroom
i-« the United States today. \nd civil rights
for the Negro is our problem. It is ours be
cause we, the white \nuricans, made the
Negro problem, created the stereotype that
equates black with inferior — and it we who
must change our ideas and our actions. Even
'I we personally do not share the slcreotvped
picture ol the Negro — as. hopefully is the
case with most well-educated citi/.ens — we
no longer play the sole of silent bystander.
Ilenn Thereau's dictum is still true to
day: The citizen who silenth watches the
perpetuation ol a wrong is as guilt\ as lie
who activeh participates in the deed itself.
