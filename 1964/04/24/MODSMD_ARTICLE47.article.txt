# Stanford: A Totalitarian System
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
Editor, Tin* Daily:
This problem of student
rights and administration pre
rogatives comes up again and
to be enough said on the basic
versity to assume pervasive
control over just about every
aspect of its students' lives?
Does the University have a
special claim upon people that
no employer, no government,
no church, in fact none but the
U.S. Army demands?
According to the scholar's
defin i t i on we all live
under what might be called a
miniature totalitarian system,
~ in the sense that it "leaves no
aspect of life outside its con
trol. that permits no 'island of
separateness' to which men or
groups may retreat." (Prof.
Gordon Wright's definition>.
To be sure, the University is
a reasonable an d benevolent
master, but it does, after all.
ask to oversee everything from
our personal morality and
drinking habits to the affairs
of each and every voluntary
campus organization we join,
in addition to its usual role of
telling us what to think.
Sure, attendance at Stanford
is voluntary, and it's a "privil
ege. not a right," and all that.
Nevertheless, the individual
who does not attend this or
some other college is heavily
penalized and he who fails to
conform to their demands may
as well have been convicted of
of a felony for the damage it
does to his earning power and
his place in society.
Institutions with as much
power over individuals as this
University has, ought to tem
per their demands and be much
less petulant in telling students
and stud''nt <>r.:ani/.alions what
to do and how to do it.

Is there really any excuse in
;i free society for a totalitarian
situation, even such a very fine
one all bul overflowing with
lhe winds of freedom?

A lot of people have been
questioning the cultural value
of the White Memorial Plaza
fountain. However, I believe
that they have missed the ob
vious interpretation Aristides
Dimitrios meant for it. When
Mr. Dimitrios made an overall
sin vey of the outstanding phys
ical characteristics of Stan
ford, no doubt the overpower
ing dominance of Hoover
Tower lopped Ihe list. What
could be more appropriate to
him than to create an artistic
partner for it. An Eve for
Adam. The resulting female
symbol, a gigantic womb, fin

I am pleased to acknowledge
the response of A. Bernstein
lo my remarks on pacificism.
Clearly he does not accept a
philosophy without first giv
ing ii a great deal of thought.
This is precisely the atl'lude
necessary to evaluate the
worth of any philosophy, an
attitude which many Stanford
students Would di> well to ac
quire. They who would c a I I

J
I themselves liberal-minded are
often slaves to contemporary
thought.
I wish to defend some of my
remarks on the basis that
the\ were misinterpreted.
First. I believe that the clear
est meaning of the word "ra
tional" involves .choice of
means toward a goal.
THIS GOAL .MAY BE laud
able or ignoble," If 1 decide to
murder someone, 1 will con
struct a rational plan to
achieve my goal.
Second, in curing any illness,
the symptoms are too often
mistaken for the cause. I
don't try to cure a virus infec
tion by bathing in ice water
in hopes of reducing my fever.
In analogy, world armament is
not the cause, but the symp
tom. of deep-seated mistrust
and fear. Now, clearly il is
easier to attack Ihe symptom
rather than the cause, but is
this not nonsense?
I disagree that everything
boils down to the question, "Do
we want to live with murder
in southeast Asia?" This is
simplifying the matter. There
are many questions more basic.
One of the basic problems is
getting the man on Ihe street
to live without fear, mistrust
and superstition. This is a for
midable task but a far more
worthwhile project. Il involves
imhiding him with an attitude
of critical doubt on all issues.
I restate my opinion that il
is far less important that we

simplifying the matter. There

Editor, Tin* Daily:
This problem of student
rights and administration pre
rogatives comes up again and
to be enough said on the basic
versity to assume pervasive
control over just about every
aspect of its students' lives?
Does the University have a
special claim upon people that
no employer, no government,
no church, in fact none but the
U.S. Army demands?
According to the scholar's
defin i t i on we all live
under what might be called a
miniature totalitarian system,
~ in the sense that it "leaves no
aspect of life outside its con
trol. that permits no 'island of
separateness' to which men or
groups may retreat." (Prof.
Gordon Wright's definition>.
To be sure, the University is
a reasonable an d benevolent
master, but it does, after all.
ask to oversee everything from
our personal morality and
drinking habits to the affairs
of each and every voluntary
campus organization we join,
in addition to its usual role of
telling us what to think.
Sure, attendance at Stanford
is voluntary, and it's a "privil
ege. not a right," and all that.
Nevertheless, the individual
who does not attend this or
some other college is heavily
penalized and he who fails to
conform to their demands may
as well have been convicted of
of a felony for the damage it
does to his earning power and
his place in society.
Institutions with as much
power over individuals as this
University has, ought to tem
per their demands and be much
less petulant in telling students
and stud''nt <>r.:ani/.alions what
to do and how to do it.

Is there really any excuse in
;i free society for a totalitarian
situation, even such a very fine
one all bul overflowing with

Editor, The Dsiily:
A lot of people have been
questioning the cultural value
of the White Memorial Plaza
fountain. However, I believe
that they have missed the ob
vious interpretation Aristides
Dimitrios meant for it. When
Mr. Dimitrios made an overall
sin vey of the outstanding phys
ical characteristics of Stan
ford, no doubt the overpower
ing dominance of Hoover
Tower lopped Ihe list. What
could be more appropriate to
him than to create an artistic
partner for it. An Eve for
Adam. The resulting female
symbol, a gigantic womb, fin
ally gives sexual balance to

I am pleased to acknowledge
the response of A. Bernstein
lo my remarks on pacificism.
Clearly he does not accept a
philosophy without first giv

This is precisely the atl'lude
necessary to evaluate the
worth of any philosophy, an
attitude which many Stanford
students Would di> well to ac
quire. They who would c a I I
