1 wo mouths ago oni group o{ 2S "I than Commuuitv Devel
opers arrived in the Dominican Republie to begin 2i) months of
work with the Pcac: Corps. We were stationed throughout the
urban areas of the eountry in groups of out' or two. and I am Ii\ -
ing in the country s second largest citv witli a (ail grad
I thought it might be interesting for both prospective Peace
Corps \ olnnteers and those interested in w hat it is doing il I were
to describe onr job and li\ ing conditions here. 1 would then like
to take the opportunity to ask a favor of the student bodv.
Essentially, as Community Developers, we are supposed to act
lis catalysts in the process of improving'living conditions by such
means an intiating community programs and organizations, shar
ing ideas, etc.

\n ('OMPANEKO and I live in a waterless, poorlv built little
house :n one of the Hive large "barrios" (slums) of our city. The
homes around us are one story, thatched or tin roof affairs with
walls of hastily nailed together thin pine boards, and with floors
ol dirt or cement.
The)' are terribly overcrowded, mainly w ith children, some of
whom go to school for two or three hours a day, and then spend
the rest ol their time with the other neighborhood children running
around the dirty, often muddy, streets raggedly clothed or naked.
The sons of the wealthier barrio dwellers may continue their
education through high school, but the large majority go no lur
tlier than the sixth grade, and then look for work. There is high
unemployment and wages are low. The average is $60-$70 a
I month, I .S. buying value. The steady three meal diet is rice,
' bananas, and beans, with fruit and a bit of meat added at lunch
time for most facilies. As volunteers, we eat about the same thing
with a family across the street.
One big problem ol the people here is that, after 30 years of
J complete dictatorship, they are unaccustomed to doing anything
for themselves. I'nder Trujillo, every community improvement
from recreation to street lighting was administered In the govern
ment with no heed given to local leadership or involvement.
Our job is to bring to as many people as we can the realization
that they can (and indeed must) work together to build a better
lile for themselves and their families. For example, the local gov
ernment has the funds to pave the streets here, but heretofore has
not felt the "need to do anything.
W e are trv ing to get the people in our barrio, numbering sev -
eral thousands, to work together as voters and petition the govern
, uknt to improve the streets.

A LAHGK PART of our work is in the field ol sports, and, ol
course, the most popular sport in this land ol Juan Marichal, Felipe
Alou, and others is baseball. It is a common thing to see crowds
ol youngsters playing with sticks, homemade cloth mitts, and balls
of tape and string.
Big landholders and industrialists are enthusiastic about pro
viding better recreation sites, but there is a high dutv on imported
equipment and the kids cannot allord it.
So (to get back to that favor) we were thinking that a collec
tion of equipment — old bats, balls, and gloves might be taken up
i at Stanford and Cal. The) can be sent in duty free through the
\merican Finbassy.
In keeping with the Communitx Development process, we will
; distribute them to organized groups ol boys w ho will be able to
use the equipment to form teams. For many, this will be the first
experience in being a member of an organization and working to
wards a goal with others.
The teams will learn more in self help bv paying small dues to
pax lor baseball caps, maintenance, etc. W hatever is received will
be great!) appreciated. Thank you for your interest.
