# LASSU PETITIONS
## Suspension Policy Asked 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
LASSU approved a resolution
i last night petitioning the Presi
dent of the University to author
ize certain procedures in the case
' of suspension, principally that
I the student be "notified in writing
as to the date upon which the
suspension is effective, and t li e
! period over which il is effective."
Other parts of the petition, pre
sented to the Legislature by Bob
Curry, called for a student being
suspended to be notified either
j orally or in writing of the causes
of his suspension, and that provi
sion for appeal, "incorporating
the common legal principals of
defense" be made available to the
student.
LASSU became concerned with
the methods used in suspension
I because of the recent (vise of
Frank Morse, who was suspended
from the University for a door
breaking incident at the Slanloid
in-Italy campus.
Two By-laws changes were also
I proposed by Curry and were re
ferred to tho Bv laws committee.

The first would make certain that
the judicial councils of the over
seas campuses are subordinate
to and under the jurisdiction of
the Judicial Council. The second
would require the judicial coun
| cils at Iho foreign campuses to re
fer their records to iho Judicial
Council.
Steve Stern also a member of
I the Legislature committee on the
I Morse case, proposed anot her
! resolution, requiring the Judicial
| Council to brief the councils go
i ing overseas on the student judi
cial process. The resolution
passed unanimously.
STKKN ALSO mentioned that
in the course of the LASSU in
vestigation, reports of certain ii
| regular practices by station KZSU
j had come up. LASSU will fur-
I ther investigate these reports.
The proposed by-laws change
a rush committee
was reported on by the By-laws
committee. The committee, how
ever. adviser] the Legislature to
take no action on the proposal
I until the IFC and ICC have met
I again to discuss their feelings on

A report on investigation of ir
regularities in the head yell lead
er lections held last quarter was
made by Jim Bins. Although there
were certain irregularities in the
election, Bins felt that it was too
late to do anything about it. The
Legislature, however, moved that
the election of Carey Cook to head
yell leader not be approved until,
former elections commissioner J.
D. Lodato reports the results,
A DIIIVK for donations for a
student financed loom in the
planned John F. Kennedy Me
morial Library'in Boston was
also approved. The diive will be
held May 5-9.
Two matters were brought up
concerning the upcoming ASSU
elections. Paul Holdorf moved
that len polling places be used in
the spring elections. The proposal
was' defeated following a report
by Skip Martin, the election com
missioner on the problems of
staffing additional polling places.
Martin also announced that nomi
nations are open for ten off-cam
pus LASSU representatives. Peti
tions may be picked up in I he
ASSU office.
A motion that the Legislature
direct its Finance committee to
reconsider a request for $1,000
lor the Stanfordifi-Washington
