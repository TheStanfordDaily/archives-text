# King Calls For Further Action Before Crowd Of Over 1800
## Defines Rights Movement On Historical Terms 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
"Human progress never merely
rolls in on (lie wheels of inevi
tablity. There is always a right
time In do righl; t . . and that
time is now."
This was the explanation and
the plea delivered by the Rever
end Martin Luther King to an au
dience of more than 1,800 Stan
ford students ami Conference
delegates who packed Memorial
Auditorium yesterday af i.ernoon
to hoar this the keynote address
io the All Western Slates Civil
Rights Conference currently be
ing held on the Stanford campus.
DURING THE course of his
speech, which was interrupted
more than a half-dozen times by
prolonged applause from the au
dienee, King attempted to define
the civil rights movement in
terms of its own history ex
ploding the myths of "those who
remain silent" with economic and
social fact, exploring the philoso
phy and tactics of non-violent ac
tion, and stressing always that
"we-ve come a long, long way;
but we still have a long, long way
to go."
King's recurrent tone was one
of positive "realism" a tenable
middle ground between foolish
optimism and overt pessimism;
but his stand on so-called "mod
eration" was unequivocal.
"If 'moderation' means moving
toward justice with wise re
straint, then it is a great virtue.
If. however, it means 'slowing
up,' capitulating to evil, then it
is a tragic vice."
KING, AS head of the South
ern Christian Leadership Con

ference, emphasized the funda
mental civil rights problems af
flicting the South and stressed
the absolute necessity of outside
intervention.
"In the Mississippi power struc
ture, justice has no meaning. . . .
Civil rights issues cannot be re
solved from within the state;
help must come from the out
side."
In King's view, the bulk of this
"help from the outside "must
necessarily come from the stu-
U'lii community. "Students have
taken the groans and the pas
sionate yearnings of these people
the Southern Negroes for free
dom and have? molded them into
a creative force."
"I AM SI'KK that 'old ma n
segregation' is on his death bed,"
King continued, "but old social
nrdecM have a notorious ability
to catch a final breath. . . . The
real question is how costly the
segregationists will make the
funeral. . . . Now, more than ever,
we cannot afford to slow up."
King stressed that the fight for
civil rights in the South an d
elsewhere is essentially a fight
to save the American democracy
itself, a fight in the name of hu
man dignity which is beyond re
gion and above politics.
Widespread public conscious- 1
ness that the civil rights situation i
represents a state of national
crisis is crucial to the success of |
any action.
"IT MAY BID true that you
can't legislate integration, but
you can legislate desegregation.
. . . It may be true that you can't
make a man love me. but you can
keep him from lynching me; and
that's important, too, you know."
King spoke at length on the
civil rights bill now pending in
the Senate the bill whose pas
sage he feels would be the best
tribute to tin 1 late President Ken
nedy.
The present danger, from King's
point of view, is that in the ensu
ing debate the bill will be stripped
of its essential provisos. In this
case, King would prefer no bill
at all.
KING'S FINAL words were
addressed to the philosophy of
non-violent action, and the virtues
of creative "maladjustment." He
stressed first that for all its tacti
cal justification, non-violence is,
or should be essentially a philoso
phy based on a capacity for com
passionate understanding.
Ideally, non-violence combines
both means and end in a continu
ous process of definition. It is an
idea in action, "a goal in the mak
ing."
But most of all, non-violence "al
lows the love impulse to be alive
in the movement an under
standing, creative, redemptive
love for all mankind. Thus we can
love the person who does the evil
jdeed, while hating the deed it
self. . . . The arc of the moral
j universe is long, but it bends to
| ward justice."
At the conclusion of King's
speech, the audience rose and
| gave him a five minute standing
\ ovation.

REV. MARTIN LUTHER KING
We Still Have A Long Way To Go.
"Human progress never merely
rolls in on (lie wheels of inevi
tablity. There is always a right
time In do righl; t . . and that
time is now."
This was the explanation and
the plea delivered by the Rever
end Martin Luther King to an au
dience of more than 1,800 Stan
ford students ami Conference
delegates who packed Memorial
Auditorium yesterday af i.ernoon
to hoar this the keynote address
io the All Western Slates Civil
Rights Conference currently be
ing held on the Stanford campus.
DURING THE course of his
speech, which was interrupted
more than a half-dozen times by
prolonged applause from the au
dienee, King attempted to define
the civil rights movement in
terms of its own history ex
ploding the myths of "those who
remain silent" with economic and
social fact, exploring the philoso
phy and tactics of non-violent ac
tion, and stressing always that
"we-ve come a long, long way;
but we still have a long, long way
to go."
King's recurrent tone was one
of positive "realism" a tenable
middle ground between foolish
optimism and overt pessimism;
but his stand on so-called "mod
eration" was unequivocal.
"If 'moderation' means moving
toward justice with wise re
straint, then it is a great virtue.
If. however, it means 'slowing
up,' capitulating to evil, then it
is a tragic vice."
KING, AS head of the South
ern Christian Leadership Con

ference, emphasized the funda
mental civil rights problems af
flicting the South and stressed
the absolute necessity of outside
intervention.
"In the Mississippi power struc
ture, justice has no meaning. . . .
Civil rights issues cannot be re
solved from within the state;
help must come from the out
side."
In King's view, the bulk of this
"help from the outside "must
necessarily come from the stu-
U'lii community. "Students have
taken the groans and the pas
sionate yearnings of these people
the Southern Negroes for free
dom and have? molded them into
a creative force."
"I AM SI'KK that 'old ma n
segregation' is on his death bed,"
King continued, "but old social
nrdecM have a notorious ability
to catch a final breath. . . . The
real question is how costly the
segregationists will make the
funeral. . . . Now, more than ever,
we cannot afford to slow up."
King stressed that the fight for
civil rights in the South an d
elsewhere is essentially a fight
to save the American democracy
itself, a fight in the name of hu
man dignity which is beyond re
gion and above politics.
Widespread public conscious- 1
ness that the civil rights situation i
represents a state of national
crisis is crucial to the success of |
any action.
"IT MAY BID true that you
can't legislate integration, but
you can legislate desegregation.
. . . It may be true that you can't
make a man love me. but you can
keep him from lynching me; and
that's important, too, you know."
King spoke at length on the
civil rights bill now pending in
the Senate the bill whose pas
sage he feels would be the best
tribute to tin 1 late President Ken
nedy.
The present danger, from King's
point of view, is that in the ensu
ing debate the bill will be stripped
of its essential provisos. In this
case, King would prefer no bill
at all.
KING'S FINAL words were
addressed to the philosophy of
non-violent action, and the virtues
of creative "maladjustment." He
stressed first that for all its tacti
cal justification, non-violence is,
or should be essentially a philoso
phy based on a capacity for com
passionate understanding.
Ideally, non-violence combines

keep him from lynching me; and
that's important, too, you know."
King spoke at length on the
civil rights bill now pending in
the Senate the bill whose pas
sage he feels would be the best
tribute to tin 1 late President Ken
nedy.
The present danger, from King's
point of view, is that in the ensu
ing debate the bill will be stripped
of its essential provisos. In this
case, King would prefer no bill
at all.
KING'S FINAL words were
addressed to the philosophy of
non-violent action, and the virtues
of creative "maladjustment." He
stressed first that for all its tacti
cal justification, non-violence is,
or should be essentially a philoso
phy based on a capacity for com
passionate understanding.
Ideally, non-violence combines
both means and end in a continu
ous process of definition. It is an
idea in action, "a goal in the mak
ing."
But most of all, non-violence "al
lows the love impulse to be alive
in the movement an under
standing, creative, redemptive
love for all mankind. Thus we can
love the person who does the evil
jdeed, while hating the deed it
self. . . . The arc of the moral
j universe is long, but it bends to
| ward justice."
At the conclusion of King's
speech, the audience rose and

\ ovation.

REV. MARTIN LUTHER KING
We Still Have A Long Way To Go.
"Human progress never merely
rolls in on (lie wheels of inevi
tablity. There is always a right
time In do righl; t . . and that
time is now."
This was the explanation and
the plea delivered by the Rever
end Martin Luther King to an au
dience of more than 1,800 Stan
ford students ami Conference
delegates who packed Memorial
Auditorium yesterday af i.ernoon
to hoar this the keynote address
io the All Western Slates Civil
Rights Conference currently be
ing held on the Stanford campus.
DURING THE course of his
speech, which was interrupted
more than a half-dozen times by
prolonged applause from the au
dienee, King attempted to define
the civil rights movement in
terms of its own history ex
ploding the myths of "those who
remain silent" with economic and
social fact, exploring the philoso
phy and tactics of non-violent ac
tion, and stressing always that
"we-ve come a long, long way;
but we still have a long, long way
to go."
King's recurrent tone was one
of positive "realism" a tenable
middle ground between foolish
optimism and overt pessimism;
but his stand on so-called "mod
eration" was unequivocal.
"If 'moderation' means moving
toward justice with wise re
straint, then it is a great virtue.
If. however, it means 'slowing
up,' capitulating to evil, then it
is a tragic vice."
KING, AS head of the South
ern Christian Leadership Con

ference, emphasized the funda
mental civil rights problems af
flicting the South and stressed
the absolute necessity of outside
intervention.
"In the Mississippi power struc
ture, justice has no meaning. . . .
Civil rights issues cannot be re
solved from within the state;
help must come from the out
side."
In King's view, the bulk of this
"help from the outside "must
necessarily come from the stu-
U'lii community. "Students have
taken the groans and the pas
sionate yearnings of these people
the Southern Negroes for free
dom and have? molded them into
a creative force."
"I AM SI'KK that 'old ma n
segregation' is on his death bed,"
King continued, "but old social
nrdecM have a notorious ability
to catch a final breath. . . . The
real question is how costly the
segregationists will make the
funeral. . . . Now, more than ever,
we cannot afford to slow up."
King stressed that the fight for
civil rights in the South an d
elsewhere is essentially a fight
to save the American democracy
itself, a fight in the name of hu
man dignity which is beyond re
gion and above politics.
Widespread public conscious- 1
ness that the civil rights situation i
represents a state of national
crisis is crucial to the success of |
any action.
"IT MAY BID true that you
can't legislate integration, but
you can legislate desegregation.
. . . It may be true that you can't
make a man love me. but you can
keep him from lynching me; and
that's important, too, you know."
