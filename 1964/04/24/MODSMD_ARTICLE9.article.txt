# King Tells Reporters No Reds In Movement
## 
### LINDA HESS 
Buffeted by crowds of report
ers, photographers, and camera
men, and buffeted by two staff 1
assistants, Martin Luther King
made his way from the plane to
the airport reception room where]
he conducted a half-hour press l
conference before coming to
speak at Stanford yesterday after
noon.
In a prepared statement re-,
sponding to J. Edgar Hoover's re
cent charge that the civil rights
movement is infiltrated by Com
munists, King expressed the hope
that we were not about to witness i
a renaissance of McCarthyism in
this country.
"II is natural and inevitable
that communists have made ef
forts to infiltrate the civil rights
groups and to exploit the racial
situation," said King, quoting At
torney General Robert Kennedy.
The more significant fact is that
the Communists have had so
little success in attracting the
Negro, who might easily be.
tempted by what looked like an
easy way out of his desperate
situation.
King challenged the FBI child'
or anyone else raising the "red"
issue to produce evidence that the
organization he leads is devoted
to any other goal than there
alization of ideals of freedom,
ideals wholly alien to the Com ;
munist philosophy.
King was asked if he thought

a wave of race violence would be
set off in California if Ihc Hum
foid Fair Housing Act were re
pealed. His answer: there would
certainly be more demonstrations,
and there would be deep bitter
ness and disillusionment. Negro
leaders would have a very hard
time keeping the spirit of coop
oration and nonviolence alive in
their followers.
Throughout th e conference
King's voice was slow and evenly
measured, as were his answers.
Unruffled in the midst of the
jostling newsmen, ho once again
affirmed in simple terms the goal
of Ihe civil rights movement as
the achievement, through non
violent persuasion and direct ac
tion. of an America free of dis
crimination.
"It would be encouraging to
us," lie said, concluding his re
marks, "if Mr. Hoover and the
FBI would be as diligent in appre
hending those responsible for
bombing churches and killing
little children as they are in seek
ing out alleged Communist infil
tration in the civil rights move
ment.''
