STATE AND LOCAL
• Stale Legislature Stands Still
SACRAMENTO Like everything else in this drowsy state
Capitol, Gov. Brown's 1964 legislative program appeared yesterday
to hang in a stale of suspended animation.
Trying to tote up a success-failure score for the Democratic chief
executive was impossible, since the final fate of most items remained
to be determined.
As the el; lion-year session moved into its 10th week, it aptly filled
the dictionary definition of suspended animation: "temporary suspen
sion of the vital function."
The 53.67 billion budget, which partisan bickering and a Senate-
Assembly parliamentary argument forced into a special session after
an abortive regular 30-day session, still gathered dust on committee
shelves in each house.
Observers, many of whom expected to see the session end by May
1, now won't be to surprised to be in the Capitol on June 1.
SPORTS
• ( cities Take Sixth Straight NBA Title
BOSTON The proud Celtics, spurred by Bill Russell, mustered
all their detense and teamwork for a rough 105-99 victory over San
Francisco and an unprecedented sixth straight National Basketball
Association championship' last night.
Boston thus extended its basketball dynasty to heights never be
fore attained by professional athletes.
But the Warriors aggressively battled to the wire before the
Celtics could climax a year of dedication by wrapping up in five
games the final NBA playoff series.
Russell rebounded a Tom Heinsohn miss and dunked it in with
12 seconds left for the clincher. A parade to the foul line had enabled
San Francisco to close to 101-99 at the 19-seeond mark.
In the annals of pro playoff sports the highest previous string of
consecutive titles was five. It has been shared by the Celtics, the
New York Yankess of 1919-53 and Montreal's Stanley Cup hockey
kings of 1956-60.
