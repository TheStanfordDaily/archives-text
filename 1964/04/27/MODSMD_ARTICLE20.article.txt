# CORTRIGHT INJURY HURTS BUT...
## Tribe Tracksters Triumph Over WSU 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
A muscle cramp in the leg of
Stanford co-captain Steve Cort
right pul the Indians in the hole
in the very first event of their
dual meet with the Cougars of
Washington State in Pullman
Saturday afternoon, but clutch
performances by Phil Arnaudo,
Bill Pratt, Eric Frische and F J aul
Schlicke pulled the meet out of

the fire for Stanford, 78-67.
Cortright, running the third leg
of the opening running event, the
440 relay, fell to the cinders with
a sudden muscle cramp while
leading the race by what assis
tant coach Jess Bova estimated
at a good 20 yards.
THIS COST the Tribe an im
mediate five points, plus what
ever Cort right would have scored
later. And considering that eleven
is the least he has scored in any
single meet this season, that
meant Stanford was giving away
at least 15 points before the meet
even got started.
li was only the clutch doubles
of Phil Arnaudo and Eric Frische
and the close wins of Bill Pratt,
and Paul Schlicke that wound up
giving the meet to the Indians.
Arnaudo is normally the num
ber two hurdler on the Redskin
team. But on almost any other
team, he would be first man. The
value of having a man like this
on your team was seen in gold

face letters when Cortright was
hurt.
STANFORD NEEDED wins in
both th(> hurdle events to win the
meet. With Cortright running,
these were a malter of course.
And with Arnaudo taking over as
the hig man in the events, t lie
Tribe also wound up getting
t hem.
Arnaudo opened his afternoon
by taking on two men, Kill Gas
kins and Bill Bleakney, who had
already this season posted limes
in the high hurdles better than
any he had ever run. The big In
dian countered this by running
the best of his life, 1 1.0, and win
ning.
In the second event, these
same two rivals were at least
Arnaudo's equals on form. Un
daunted, Arnaudo went out and
posted a 3S.(i coming home a
double winner and the hig Stan
ford hero.
ERIC FRISCHE was the only
other double winner. Stanford

needed Iho points in his events,
the 100 and 220 just as badly as
it had the hurdle points. Frische
got tlio ones for first place both
times, his first 100 yard dash win
of the year being among them.
Bob Melntyre, Ihe broad jump
winner, also came through in (lie
sprints with a third in the 100
and a second in the 220. On top
of the winning 23-11'2 broad
jump and the live points it netted,
these other places gave Melntyre
a total of nine for the afternoon.
Pratt's 880 victory was also a
big one, as was the one point
Harry McCalla picked up for
third in that event. Pratt, the
Wenatchce, Wash., native posted
a 1:52.6 to beat his nearest rival
by four tenths of a second.
BUT TlfM MEET was never in
the bag until, with Stanford lead
ing by only four points a 1 67-63.
Paul Schlicke rang up a win in
the two mile. Leading all the way,
Schlicke's time was 0:01.5, a new
track record.

right pul the Indians in the hole
in the very first event of their
dual meet with the Cougars of
Washington State in Pullman
Saturday afternoon, but clutch
performances by Phil Arnaudo,
Bill Pratt, Eric Frische and F J aul
Schlicke pulled the meet out of

the fire for Stanford, 78-67.
Cortright, running the third leg
of the opening running event, the
440 relay, fell to the cinders with
a sudden muscle cramp while
leading the race by what assis
tant coach Jess Bova estimated
at a good 20 yards.
THIS COST the Tribe an im
mediate five points, plus what
ever Cort right would have scored
later. And considering that eleven
is the least he has scored in any
single meet this season, that
meant Stanford was giving away
at least 15 points before the meet
even got started.
li was only the clutch doubles
of Phil Arnaudo and Eric Frische
and the close wins of Bill Pratt,
and Paul Schlicke that wound up
giving the meet to the Indians.
Arnaudo is normally the num
ber two hurdler on the Redskin
team. But on almost any other
team, he would be first man. The
value of having a man like this
on your team was seen in gold

face letters when Cortright was
hurt.
STANFORD NEEDED wins in
both th(> hurdle events to win the
meet. With Cortright running,
these were a malter of course.
And with Arnaudo taking over as
the hig man in the events, t lie
Tribe also wound up getting
t hem.
Arnaudo opened his afternoon
by taking on two men, Kill Gas
kins and Bill Bleakney, who had
already this season posted limes
in the high hurdles better than
any he had ever run. The big In
dian countered this by running
the best of his life, 1 1.0, and win
ning.
In the second event, these
same two rivals were at least
Arnaudo's equals on form. Un
daunted, Arnaudo went out and
posted a 3S.(i coming home a
double winner and the hig Stan
ford hero.
ERIC FRISCHE was the only
other double winner. Stanford

needed Iho points in his events,
the 100 and 220 just as badly as
it had the hurdle points. Frische
got tlio ones for first place both
times, his first 100 yard dash win
of the year being among them.
Bob Melntyre, Ihe broad jump
winner, also came through in (lie
sprints with a third in the 100
and a second in the 220. On top
of the winning 23-11'2 broad
jump and the live points it netted,
these other places gave Melntyre
a total of nine for the afternoon.
Pratt's 880 victory was also a
big one, as was the one point
Harry McCalla picked up for
third in that event. Pratt, the
Wenatchce, Wash., native posted
a 1:52.6 to beat his nearest rival
by four tenths of a second.
BUT TlfM MEET was never in
the bag until, with Stanford lead
ing by only four points a 1 67-63.
Paul Schlicke rang up a win in
the two mile. Leading all the way,
Schlicke's time was 0:01.5, a new
track record.
