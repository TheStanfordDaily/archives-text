# Stanford Nine Loses Three Straight In Southland Swing
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball miseries
grew considerably over the week
end as the Indians dropped three
games to UCLA and IJSC down
south. The losses evened the,
team's overall record at 15-15 and :
cemented them in last place in Ihe j
CIBA with a 2-11 record.
On Friday, the Tribe was edged '
by UCLA, 4-3, in 11 innings by
an unearned run. Saturday, USC
heat them, 5-4 in 11 innings, and;
11-4 with 11 runs in one inning.
THINGS started well enough
against UCLA. Sophomore
catcher Jim Hibbs started a phe
nomenal weekend by clouting a
home run to right field in the
first inning. Later, Hibbs cracked
a line drive double that came six
inches from going out of the
park. He scored when second
baseman George Thacher singled.
The Cards got another run for
a 3-0 lead when Bob Cox singled,
stole second, and scored on a Bob
Hollmann single.
But then Bruin Randy Schwartz
once again proved the Card nem
esis. His two-out double in the j
fifth scored two. Then, in the'
11th Indian rightfielder Lon Ray-1
mond had trouble handling a
Schwartz drive, letting it fall for
a single. Speedy Jerry Harmon,
who had walked, scored all the
way from first base.
THAT WAS IT. giving UCLA a
four-game sweep over Stanford
this year. Schwartz was the Bruin
who did the most damage in each
of them.

The doublo header with USC
was a woeful case of missed op
portunities. The Indians broke lo
a 4-1 lead, helped by a Pete Mid
dlekauff homer and a double by
pitcher Dick Kovacevich.
The unheralded Jim Rees, who
had been playing JV ball for USC
until then, belled a three-run hom
er to tie it up in the sixth.
Stanford had loaded the bases
with none out in the fifth inning
on three hits by Hibbs, Middle
kauff, and Cox. Then a sure
double play grounder by George
Thacher hit Middlekauff. Middle
kauff was out and the runners
had to hold; Hollmann and Rich
Berra then went out. Had there
been a double play, Stanford
would have scored the eventual
winning run.
IN THK KIGHTII, the bases
were again loaded, with one out.
But two weak ground balls ended
Iho Tribe threat.
Part-time football star Willie
Brown sank Stanford in Iho lllh;
with the bases loaded, one out,
and the Card outfield playing in,
ho sent a fly ball just far enough
beyond leftfielder Ron Yett for
a single, and the-winning run
scored.
The game was a heartbreaker
for Kovacevich. who allowed only
eight hits in 11 innings and
struck out seven.
In the nightcap, the Trojans
struck for 11 runs in the first in
ning after two men were out.
Three-run homers by Brown and
Larry Sandel, and a single and
double by Bud Hollowell which
scored four runs, were the fatal
blows.
lIIHKS continued his heroics
for the Tribe, belting another op
posite field home run. He was
taken out in the third inning due
to a minor leg cramp. Overall,
he was five for nine for the week
end .
' The 5-4 USC win was the fourth
straight CIBA game that Stan
ford had lost by one run. Stan
ford has 10 games remaining in
the season, seven in the CIBA.
