# Civil Rights '64: Reasonable Vs. Extremist Approach
## Editorial 
### 
There was one word that summed up the
Stanford m il rights conference.
I )ignity.
II was one of those events Stanford can
I()11ht' proud of — conducted on a low key,
educational, non-emotional level.
AND THIS REASONABLE approach is
sort'h needed in today's national civil rights
effort. Witness the chilling success the ex
tremists have had in capturing segments of

the movement, as evidenced by the stall-in
tactics of Brooklyn CORE and the shop-ins
in San Francisco.
It is a frightening irony that now — on
the eve of what could be the greatest civil
rights breakthrough in U.S. history, i.e., the
bill in Congress — that more moderate ele
ments in the movement are being squeezed
out by irresponsible extremists. Extremists,
who by incensing public opinion through

their acts, jeopardize those goals which have
been so diligently fought for in the past 20
years.
The Stanford civil rights conference was
refreshing testimony to the fact that there
are reasonable elements in the movement.

And the remarkably high attendance
(more than 400 Western college delegates
were here) indicates that there is deep con
cern in the student community over civil
rights — and that the movement is supported
strongly by whites as well as Negroes.
THIS SUMMER'S Mississippi voter reg
istration and education drive, which was the
focal point of much ol the conference, is a
noble, constructive project — in which 1,000

college students are expected to participate.
Instead of stalling traffic on New York ex
pressways and loading San Francisco gro
cery carts, the COFO workers will be en
gaged in a project which will take far greater
vision and far greater effort.
We can only hope that their calm, rea
sonable approach will be emulated.
There is too much at stake to do other
wise.
