## Lodge Fails To Offer More Than 'Me Too' 
### Stephen Shefler 
The Oregon Priniar\ is less than a month away and from all
indication the Oregonians will follow the citizens of New Hamp
shire in casting their ballots for Henry Cabot Lodge. (The most
recent Harris Poll gave Lodge 46 per cent to 17 per cent for Nixon
liis closest rival.)
In spite of the fact that Lodges popularity has boomed na
tionally among Republican regulars, the national leadership lias
remained lukewarm toward our Ambassador in Saigon. While this
lias been attributed to the fact that Lodges campaign performance
in the 1960 election was excessively poor, the more pervasive rea
son that appears in the comments ol the Republican leadership is
that Lodge oilers no alternative to the current administration's
policies. While "me too" accusations right wing Republicans use
against their fellow party members can normally be easily an
swered, this is not the case with Lodge.

WHEN THE OREGON voters were asked to rate the poten
tial Republican candidates as to their probable performance on
domestic issues, Goldwater scored noticeably higher than Lodge.
Probably, this is because these voters have no idea ol w here Lodge
stands 011 domestic issues.
When the Associated Press and the Congressional Quarterly
collaborated on an article on where Lodge stands, they w ere forced
to go back to 1937 to relate his position on domestic issues.
liver since Lodge was defeated by John Fitzgerald Kennedy
for llie 1952 Senate race in Massachusetts he has remained silent
on domestic issues except for his parroting the stands of Richard
Nixon iu the 1960 Presidential Race. Unlike Scranton, Rockefeller,
and Goldwater, w ho have come out in favor of returning respon
sibility to state governments in speeches made this year—Lodge's
stand on this fundamental domestic question has not been stated.
The remainder of important domestic issues (e.g., welfare legis
lation and farm aid) like the Federal-National issue have remained
untouched by Lodge during the last decade. Lodge's silence lias
made the Republican leaders wan - ; they do not want a candidate
whose stands w ill mirror those of President Johnson.

ON FOREIGN POLICY most voters feel Lodge is strongest;
the) believe lie would be more aggressive toward the Communist
nations than the current administration. But when one considers
the fact tlial Lodge plays an important role in the Administration's
foreign policy on Vietnam which has been the central foreign pol
icy issue this year, tliey question what alternative can he offer.
Can a man who plays an intregal part in the formulation of the
Administration's policy toward Vietnam effective!} criticize that
polics or w ill he merely offer the same program Johnson offers?
The Republican Leadership feels that if Lodge disagrees with
Johnson's handling of Vietnam, he should step down from his post
and sa\ so. Compared with Nixon and Goldwater, who have stood
for an aggressive Vietnam policy, Lodge seems weak.
While the Lodge boom continues therefore among the rank and
file Republican adherents, the boom has not caught hold with the
Republican leadership who feel his failure to offer an alternative
will turn a prc-eonvention boom into a post-convention bust.
