# Who Cares About Frank Morse?
## The 						Mailbox

Editor, The Daily:
Now that poor Frank Morse
has been booted around th e
campus satisfactorily, I'm sure
the Administration is su
premely proud of itself. After
all. they sit back with the smug
satisfaction that their decision
is moral because it is based on
some secretive information
which is quite obviously to o
shocking and damaging to be
publicly released.
I WONDER IF they know of
a fellow named Henry Miller?
I should think it would take
quite a tasty morsel of infor
mation to outdo him. Bui
really, it's a good tiling the Ad
ministration doesn't release
these secret bits of evidence.
They might destroy Frank's
life!
Any you see, regardless of
popular opinion, by giving the
student body a moral issue to
debate, thai "old goal of edu
cation" has been attained. We
have all learned something
about society and its laws from
the Morse absurdity, and, as a
side-light, we also picked up a
little first-hand knowledge
about tyranny.
Who really cares about Frank
Morse, the person? I don't. For
all I know, he may be an en
tirely disagreeable individual.
And as long as it isn't me the
Administration is abusing, why
should I care about Frank? So
they kick him out of college
because of some Castro-like evi
dence. I'm still here, and be
sides, what could I do. one
small, disgruntled cog, even
if I cared?
LET THE Administration run
rampid with Anti-Window Sign
and Frank Morse campaigns.
With the vast number of stu
dents here, if I keep to myself
and continue to be respectfully
submissive, the odds are in my
favor that they will never come
and search me out because I
knocked a bicycle down, inten
tionally, out of meanness and
rebellion, in the first quarter
when I was frustrated.
Excuse me while I go back
into my room for an Adminis
tration-hate session so I can
vindicate my honor and say I
helped poor Frank all that I
could. I have to be able to look
at myself in the mirror tomor
i'ow morning, you know.

• Box 11791
Editor, The Daily:
Does "The Stanford Daily"
have any editorial policy co n
eerning the content of adver
tisements. or is it so financially
desperate as to accept any and
all copy submitted?
I feel that the intelligence of
the entire Stanford community
is being dealt a daily insult in
the form of the medieval propa
ganda inserted by the holder (s>
of Box 11791, Palo Alto. Eight
double - column inch e so 1'
"laughable, superstitious hang
over" would be disagreeable
enough once a week, but in
daily doses il is well nigh in
tolerable.
While such proslyl izing
would be disgusting even in a
rural environment, it is thrice
so in the Stanford area. Is this
material intended for a group
of supposedly educated individ
uals in Hie year 19(54, or would
il be more appropriately ad
dressed to naive and unen
lighted Hock of bovine peas
ants wallowing in the slime of
bygone ignorance?
No, I am not forced to read
this tripe (I made that mistake
only once), but I strenuously
object to il) having it thrust
before me, and (2) the result
ing waste of space in our news
paper (some fraction of our tui
tion helps to support the opera
tions of "The Daily").
As one of those "non-Chris
tians (who) run merrily along
believing that they are in
charge of their own lives a n d
in control of their own des
tinies." I would suggest that
in the future the editors dis
regard the lure of the almighty
dollar and exercise some dis
cretion in accepting advertise
ments for publication.

• New Republic
Editor, The Daily:
Darryl Wold, in Wednesday's
Daily, grossly misinterpreted
an article from The New Re
public. 1 quote from Mr. Wold's
column. "It (The New Repub
lic i says thai now, when the
ideological split between Rus
sia and China has Khrushchev
with his back to the wall, we
should step in and befriend
him, for that will surely make
him a friend to the West."
I now quote, verbatim, t li e
statement he referred to from
The New Republic, which is a
commentary on Senator Ful
bright's suggestion for a re
assessment of our Far Eastern
and Soviet policies.
"There are two basic facts
about China, apart from its
current quarrel with Russia.
One is thai the Peking re
gime resembles that of Sta
lin. whom Mao Tse-tung pro
fesses to admire: its bellico
sity much exceeds its capa
city for aggression, with the
result that its foreign policy
is considerably more cauti
ous than its whirling words
might suggest. The second
fact is that China, though
comparatively feeble, can be
a magnet for great masses
of resentful people in have
not countries, as Russia was
for 30 years under Stalin
and Lenin. Neither fact re
ceives due recognition in
U.S. foreign policy as no w
practiced. We are tempted
to side with Russia against
China, or to play one off
against the other. Yet both
have to be lived with, some
how, and the relative rea
sonableness of Krushchev
ought to suggest that China
is capable of becoming more
reasonable in its turn. Mean
while the U.S. should be
concerned to frustate Chi
nese attempts to depict it
to the have-not countries as
a bloated imperialist that is
also anti-colored. We can
counter that by what we do
here at home with our own
race problem and by avoid
ing any appearance <»l gang
ing up with Hussia against
China."
