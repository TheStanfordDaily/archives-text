# Notes And Observations
## Barry's Death Reports Greatly Exaggerated 
### John Bonine 
The kaleidoscopic Republican picture show s the strongest surge
by Sen. Barry Goklwater since November 22, according to politi
cos, while other candidates remain static. Here is the way it looks:
Riding atop a temporary crest in the Gallup Poll, Henry Cabot
Lodge fails to excite party pros or delegates, although a "stop-
Goldwater" movement around him is stirring, reports indicate.
Riding an increasingly permanent trough of rejection by pros
and the public. Nelson Rockefeller suJiers setback alter setback,
now cannot depend even on the support of his own state, where
most delegates are running uncommitted, some for Goklwater.

STANDING IN THE DRAFT and occasional!) tning to close
the door, \\ illiam Serai it on is still "a town in Pennsylvania" to most
voters. Some feel a vote ot less than 80 per cent lor him in tomor
row's Pennsylvania primary will be a setback.
Also standing in the draft — and trying to keep the door open-
Richard Nixon is acting remarkably friendly to Goidwater.
And starting to mount a new wave of political strength that
could carry him to nomination on the first or second ballot. Harry
Goidwater is recouping many of the losses he suffered from the
assassination last November. He continues to "niekel-and-dime
his opponents in state and district conventions, picking up two
delegates here, six there, ten elsewhere. Support among party
leaders is twice that for any other candidate (48 per cent, accord
ing to A/').
The hopes of Lodge, Seranton, and Nixon had depended on a
deadlock in the convention; that seems unlikely now. Each is
reluctant to get into the race as the stop-Goldwater candidate,
knowing he would be the sacrificial lamb, ipso facto having to give
way himself for a compromise candidate at best, being buried un
der the Goidwater bandwagon at worst. Each has declared his
refusal to become the focal point of a stop-Goldwater move.
Contrary to the impression given by some news media, dele
gates are not waiting for the first chance to jump off the Goidwater
drive. Any hesitation about pledging themselves to liim "stems
from uncertainties about his ultimate success.
On Saturday, however, Nevada Republicans pledged their
delegates to Goidwater — the first such pledge in the history of
their party. In Kansas, regarded as the Midwest bastion of anti-
Goldwater sentiment, the convention rejected their own governor
as a favorite son and twelve to sixteen of their twenty votes will go
for Goklwater.

ALL AGREE NOW that Goldwaters delegate strength will ex
ceed all others even without California — 450, figures Rockefeller
strategist Joe Martin; 510, estimates U.S. News and World Report;
500 minimum, says Richard Nixon; 500 to 525, Goklwater feels.
It now stands at 180, with 14 for Lodge and 5 for Nixon, says A/\
II Goidwater should win in California, "there will be no stop-
Goldwater movement," believes Joe Martin. "Everybody likes to
back the winner and delegates will scramble for the bandwagon.
Goidwater would probably agree with Mark Twain s comment
at seeing his obituary: "Reports of my death are greatly exag
gerated.'
