# MORSE CASE
## Dr. Frulla Blamed For Suspension 
### JIM BRISCOE 
"I think the decision to suspend Frank Morse defin
i itely came from Dr. Frulla," Tom Connaughton, chair
i man of the Florence Judicial Council stated in an inter
view with the Daily yesterday.
Connaughton revealed that Frulla was "quite upset"
on the morning following the incident. "My impression
was that his concern was over Tom Webber, however,"
Connaughton continued. "I was completely unaware
that he was considering suspension in Morse's case."
THIS WAS confirmed by Dr. Morris Zelditch, one
of the Stanford professors on the Florence campus who
sat on Ihe faculty board which reviewed the Morse Case.
"To my knowledge we never considered suspension in
regard to Frank Morse" Zelditch told Ihe Daily.
Many other facets of the story remain in obscurity,
however. The following is a summary of the events
which have unfolded since Frank Morse put his fist
through Ron Langstaff's door on tVie afternoon of
March 11.
According to Morse, this was done "without mali
! cious intent," but Langstaff immediately reciprocated

by knocking an identical panel out of Morse's door.
SOMETIME LATER in the afternoon, apparently,
Tom Webber, Frank Morse's roommate, undertook to
restore the architectual symmetry of the floor by knock
ing out three other panels.
A Judicial Council hearing was called that evening,
but according to Tom Connaughton, Judicial Council
chairman, none would reveal the guilty parties. Dr.
Frulla, who entered the room at one point, apparently
became quite angry with this. According to Connaugh
ton, Frulla then said that he would take "more serious
action than any student judicial council will take."
Tom Webber, Frank Morse, and Ron Langstaff later
confessed. Morse and Langstaff were sentenced to five
Corporation yard hours and Webber to twenty-five
hours.
WHEN FRANK Morse arrived on campus for regis
tration March 30 he was informed he was be considered
for suspension. Two days later he was notified of the
suspension. He appealed the decision but it was with
held by Vice Provost Wert.
The following day the Student Judicial Council
moved to vacate the decision of the Florence council
and to retry the case. They sent invitations to Deans

YVinbigler and Gordon lo attend the retrial but theix*
was no reply.
The Judicial Council also offered to meet with the
Deans to discuss the case, hut this request was refused.
ON APRIL 14, the Judicial Council held a hearing
and retrial fo the Morse Case. They found Frank Morse
and Hon Langstaff guilty of destroying property in
Florence and recommended that each of them be
assigned ten hours in the Stanford Convalescent home.
The Dean's office, however, stated that they regarded
the case as closed and upheld the suspension of Frank
Morse. The original sentence of the Florence Council
is apparently still in effect for Ron Langstaff.
Frank Morse attempted to register on April 20 and
was refused on the grounds that he must obtain the
approval of the Dean of Students.
KZSU RADIO, in an interview with Dr. Frulla via
transatlantic cable, obtained from him a statement that
to his understanding all members of the Florence fac
ulty board had agreed on suspension. Dr. Zelditch, a
member of that board, has denied this however, stating
that he was and is opposed to the suspension.
The Frank Morse case officially, at least, is closed,
but student interest remains high.

The Dean's office, however, stated that they regarded
the case as closed and upheld the suspension of Frank
Morse. The original sentence of the Florence Council
is apparently still in effect for Ron Langstaff.
Frank Morse attempted to register on April 20 and
was refused on the grounds that he must obtain the
approval of the Dean of Students.
KZSU RADIO, in an interview with Dr. Frulla via
transatlantic cable, obtained from him a statement that
to his understanding all members of the Florence fac
ulty board had agreed on suspension. Dr. Zelditch, a
member of that board, has denied this however, stating
that he was and is opposed to the suspension.
The Frank Morse case officially, at least, is closed,
but student interest remains high.
"I think the decision to suspend Frank Morse defin
i itely came from Dr. Frulla," Tom Connaughton, chair
i man of the Florence Judicial Council stated in an inter
view with the Daily yesterday.
Connaughton revealed that Frulla was "quite upset"
on the morning following the incident. "My impression
was that his concern was over Tom Webber, however,"
Connaughton continued. "I was completely unaware
that he was considering suspension in Morse's case."
THIS WAS confirmed by Dr. Morris Zelditch, one
of the Stanford professors on the Florence campus who
sat on Ihe faculty board which reviewed the Morse Case.
"To my knowledge we never considered suspension in
regard to Frank Morse" Zelditch told Ihe Daily.
Many other facets of the story remain in obscurity,
however. The following is a summary of the events
which have unfolded since Frank Morse put his fist
through Ron Langstaff's door on tVie afternoon of
March 11.
According to Morse, this was done "without mali
! cious intent," but Langstaff immediately reciprocated

by knocking an identical panel out of Morse's door.
SOMETIME LATER in the afternoon, apparently,
Tom Webber, Frank Morse's roommate, undertook to
restore the architectual symmetry of the floor by knock
ing out three other panels.
A Judicial Council hearing was called that evening,
but according to Tom Connaughton, Judicial Council
chairman, none would reveal the guilty parties. Dr.
Frulla, who entered the room at one point, apparently
became quite angry with this. According to Connaugh
ton, Frulla then said that he would take "more serious
action than any student judicial council will take."
Tom Webber, Frank Morse, and Ron Langstaff later
confessed. Morse and Langstaff were sentenced to five
Corporation yard hours and Webber to twenty-five
hours.
WHEN FRANK Morse arrived on campus for regis
tration March 30 he was informed he was be considered
for suspension. Two days later he was notified of the
suspension. He appealed the decision but it was with
held by Vice Provost Wert.
The following day the Student Judicial Council
moved to vacate the decision of the Florence council
and to retry the case. They sent invitations to Deans

YVinbigler and Gordon lo attend the retrial but theix*
was no reply.
The Judicial Council also offered to meet with the
Deans to discuss the case, hut this request was refused.
ON APRIL 14, the Judicial Council held a hearing
and retrial fo the Morse Case. They found Frank Morse
and Hon Langstaff guilty of destroying property in
Florence and recommended that each of them be
assigned ten hours in the Stanford Convalescent home.
