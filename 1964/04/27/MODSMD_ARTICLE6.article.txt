# ELDERLY SCHOLAR
## Enter Into Another World 
### 
The old man's hand shook as he opened Ihe
floor, hut his eyes were clear and his bearing as
straight and stiff as his mahogany cane. To step
across the threshold was to enter a different world,
an older world, perhaps a better world — Hugh A.
Moran's world.
Hugh Moran at S2 years of age is as much a
part of the intellectual life of this intellectual com
munity as lie was in 1905 as a Stanford under
graduate, Such menial longevity is in itself re
rnarkable; but then, Hugh Moran has always been
a rather remarkable man.
AT T\Vi;XTY FOUR years of age, Moran left
Stanford, an A.15. degree in Greek tucked under
his arm. to go to Oxford as Stanford University's
first Rhodes scholar. At this time lie was already
an ordained Presbyterian minister. After studying
theology for several years, he decided to follow
his beliefs to China to work as a missionary.
In the ensuing years, the scope of his intellec
tual interests and tin* extent of his travels were
legion but all 1 his was unknown when me first
Moran settled back heavily in his deep arm
chair; il was remarkable how much a part of the
room he seemed, as if he and his house, through
long association, had become one. He began to
reminisce. It was 15M>7 in London and Herbert
Hoover had just returned from the Orient, "hav
ing made all the inonc\ he felt he needed."
"UK < \l l,i;i> me up and said he wanted to see
me I was a student at Oxford at the time. He
said to meet him down at a beer hall a nice place
for a missionary meeting, huh? When 1 arrived.

he took mo ot'i to a table al the side and said
that he had heard I was planning to go to China.
'China's had it. . . . Come with me, and I'll see you
don't suffer for it."
It must have been a tempting offer to a young,
rather impoverished student, but Moran's ryes
shone with a certain amused pride as he recalled
his response: "I told him thank you very much but
that I would just have to decline because I'd al
ready decided to go on my mission.
"What I didn't tell him was that I wouldn't be i
a tail to anybody's kite, not anybody's."
Moran went on to recount Hoover's stories of
his adventures in China, his part in the Boxer re- I
hellion, his technical innovations in the C/.arist
Russia mining industry, frequently adding, "This!
is not in any history book; I'm just, telling you
what he told me then."
TIIK Ol.n theologian began to tell how he had
"aided in Hoover's spiritual development." but j
philosopher Moran gradually began to assert him
self. He spoke at length, in surprisingly modern ;
terms, of the psychological and developmental mo
tives linking Christianity and the scientific revo
lut ion.
And then, suddenly, the time was gone. And
we said thank you and good-by and left. But it
was not without a certain genuine amount of re
gret that we stepped out again into a very differ
cut world, nor not without a blessed sense of hope- !
fulness and reassurance that, the mind is indeed
the measure of the man and can sustain itself by
it's own power.

his response: "I told him thank you very much but
that I would just have to decline because I'd al

a tail to anybody's kite, not anybody's."
Moran went on to recount Hoover's stories of
his adventures in China, his part in the Boxer re- I

Russia mining industry, frequently adding, "This!
is not in any history book; I'm just, telling you
what he told me then."
TIIK Ol.n theologian began to tell how he had
"aided in Hoover's spiritual development." but j
philosopher Moran gradually began to assert him
self. He spoke at length, in surprisingly modern ;
terms, of the psychological and developmental mo
tives linking Christianity and the scientific revo
lut ion.
And then, suddenly, the time was gone. And
we said thank you and good-by and left. But it
was not without a certain genuine amount of re

the measure of the man and can sustain itself by

The old man's hand shook as he opened Ihe
floor, hut his eyes were clear and his bearing as
straight and stiff as his mahogany cane. To step
across the threshold was to enter a different world,
an older world, perhaps a better world — Hugh A.
Moran's world.
Hugh Moran at S2 years of age is as much a
part of the intellectual life of this intellectual com
munity as lie was in 1905 as a Stanford under
graduate, Such menial longevity is in itself re
rnarkable; but then, Hugh Moran has always been
a rather remarkable man.
AT T\Vi;XTY FOUR years of age, Moran left
Stanford, an A.15. degree in Greek tucked under
his arm. to go to Oxford as Stanford University's
first Rhodes scholar. At this time lie was already
an ordained Presbyterian minister. After studying
theology for several years, he decided to follow
his beliefs to China to work as a missionary.
In the ensuing years, the scope of his intellec
tual interests and tin* extent of his travels were
legion but all 1 his was unknown when me first
Moran settled back heavily in his deep arm
chair; il was remarkable how much a part of the
room he seemed, as if he and his house, through
long association, had become one. He began to
reminisce. It was 15M>7 in London and Herbert
Hoover had just returned from the Orient, "hav
ing made all the inonc\ he felt he needed."
"UK < \l l,i;i> me up and said he wanted to see
me I was a student at Oxford at the time. He
said to meet him down at a beer hall a nice place
for a missionary meeting, huh? When 1 arrived.

he took mo ot'i to a table al the side and said
that he had heard I was planning to go to China.
'China's had it. . . . Come with me, and I'll see you
don't suffer for it."
It must have been a tempting offer to a young,
rather impoverished student, but Moran's ryes
