# Conference Gives Active Program
## Wasserstrom Paints Bleak Picture; Moses Offers Plan For Action 
### BOB PICKUS 
In two eloquent speeches, a ven bleak picture of segregation
in the Deep South and a program for action were presented to
the Civil Mights Conference here this weekend.
Richard Wasscrstroni, former professor of law and philosophy
at Stanford, tackled the topic "Separate Hut Unequal" in a Friday

afternoon speech at DinkelspieP
Auditorium.
BASED upon his experience in
Alabama, Wasserslrom outlined
what he termed a representative,
but hypothetical community in
tho Deep South. Though thp com
munity has two Negroes for every
white, Wasserstrom stated that
there will be no Negroes holding
public positions. All facilities will
be segregated, including those
raised by taxes paid by both Ne
groes and whites.
Negro schools and homes, he
continued, will be far below those
of the white in quality.
A former worker in vtoer regis
tration efforts in the South,
Wasserstrom told his listeners
that discrimination in that area
limits the Negroes to few, if any,
registered voters, while often in
eligible white are given the fran
chise.
"THE PROCESSES of law are
utterly corrupted," Wasserstrom
charged.
Often Negroes attempting to
register are required to be
"vouched for" by registered vot
ers. Since there may be no other
Negroes registered in the area,
this often prevents registration.
In other areas, the application
is used as a test. The speaker told
of cases in which Negroes with
masters degrees have "failed"
these tests.
THE MOST blatant form of dis
crimination in voter registration,
according to Wasserstrom, comes
when Negroes are threatened
with personal injury or loss of
employment, should they attempt
to register. Present ly Dean of the
School of Arts and Sciences at
Tuskegee Institute. A 1 a b a m a ,
Wasserstrom attacked southern
society as "totalitarian." He de
clared, "It is the threat hanging

over the Negro in the South that
gives it the horror of the total
itarian society. There is no con
ception of the Negro as a person
and possessor of rights . . ."
808 MOSES, chairman of the
Council of Federated Organiza
tions' "Project Mississippi," dis
cussed that program and related
topics in his Cubberly Auditorium
speech Friday evening.
Speaking before a gathering of
several hundred, Moses, who is
also the director of the Student
Non-Violent. Coordinating Com
mittee in Mississippi, placed great
importance upon the Mississippi
effort this summer.
"It's a question," he stated, "of
whether in this country we can
find people who are committed,
who care, who will sacrifice, and
who are willing to do their
share. . . ."
THE RECIPIENT of a masters
degree from Harvard in philos
ophy. Moses outlined the tasks to
be assigned the Mississippi volun
teers this summer. These include
massive attempts at voter regis
tration and the establishment of
"freedom schools" throughout the
state.
The civil rights leader described
the move that will be made in
Atlantic City this summer to chal
lenge the seating of the Missis
sippi state delegation to the Dem
ocratic National Convention. The
challenge will be made on the
basis that, because of discrimina
tion in voter registration, the dele
gates do not really represent the
people of Mississippi.
Moses spent a few moments in
defense of the recent "stall-in"
at the New York City World's
Fair. He said he was disgusted
by the "whole idea of New York
City spending millions of dollars
... to build a fair to show people
how they will live in the year
2000, when people in that city are
having 'rent strikes' because rats
are running around their houses

speech Friday evening.
Speaking before a gathering of
several hundred, Moses, who is
also the director of the Student
Non-Violent. Coordinating Com
mittee in Mississippi, placed great
importance upon the Mississippi
effort this summer.
"It's a question," he stated, "of
whether in this country we can
find people who are committed,
who care, who will sacrifice, and
who are willing to do their
share. . . ."
THE RECIPIENT of a masters
degree from Harvard in philos
ophy. Moses outlined the tasks to
be assigned the Mississippi volun
teers this summer. These include
massive attempts at voter regis
tration and the establishment of
"freedom schools" throughout the
state.
The civil rights leader described
the move that will be made in
Atlantic City this summer to chal
lenge the seating of the Missis
sippi state delegation to the Dem
ocratic National Convention. The
challenge will be made on the
basis that, because of discrimina
tion in voter registration, the dele
gates do not really represent the
people of Mississippi.
Moses spent a few moments in
defense of the recent "stall-in"
at the New York City World's
Fair. He said he was disgusted
by the "whole idea of New York
City spending millions of dollars
... to build a fair to show people
how they will live in the year
2000, when people in that city are
having 'rent strikes' because rats
are running around their houses
In two eloquent speeches, a ven bleak picture of segregation
in the Deep South and a program for action were presented to
the Civil Mights Conference here this weekend.
Richard Wasscrstroni, former professor of law and philosophy
at Stanford, tackled the topic "Separate Hut Unequal" in a Friday

afternoon speech at DinkelspieP
Auditorium.
BASED upon his experience in
Alabama, Wasserslrom outlined
what he termed a representative,
but hypothetical community in
tho Deep South. Though thp com
munity has two Negroes for every
white, Wasserstrom stated that
there will be no Negroes holding
public positions. All facilities will
be segregated, including those
raised by taxes paid by both Ne
groes and whites.
Negro schools and homes, he
continued, will be far below those
of the white in quality.
A former worker in vtoer regis
tration efforts in the South,
Wasserstrom told his listeners
that discrimination in that area
limits the Negroes to few, if any,
registered voters, while often in
eligible white are given the fran
chise.
"THE PROCESSES of law are
utterly corrupted," Wasserstrom
charged.
Often Negroes attempting to
register are required to be
"vouched for" by registered vot
ers. Since there may be no other
Negroes registered in the area,
this often prevents registration.
In other areas, the application
is used as a test. The speaker told
of cases in which Negroes with
masters degrees have "failed"
these tests.
THE MOST blatant form of dis
crimination in voter registration,
according to Wasserstrom, comes
when Negroes are threatened
with personal injury or loss of
employment, should they attempt
to register. Present ly Dean of the
School of Arts and Sciences at
Tuskegee Institute. A 1 a b a m a ,
Wasserstrom attacked southern
society as "totalitarian." He de
clared, "It is the threat hanging

over the Negro in the South that
gives it the horror of the total
itarian society. There is no con
ception of the Negro as a person
and possessor of rights . . ."
