BETWEEN TWO WORLDS
Prayer is man's two-way link with Cod. Prayer bridges the gap between two
worlds: the material world and the unseen sipritual world. Man, who can readily
I see and explore the material world, tends to think of it as the most important
world, and relegates the spiritual to a shadow or ghostly realm. In actual fact,
however, the unseen world created the visible, and will endure after the visible
world has passed away.
"By faith we. understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so
that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible." Hebrews 11:3
XASV. "... For the things which arc seen are temporal, hut the things which
arc not seen arc eternal." II Cor. 4:18.
God Himself is Spirit, and lie must be approached in prayer through the in
dwelling Holy Spirit, which is given to us by God when we put our faith in
Jesus Christ. "For God is Spirit and they that worship Hint must worship Hint
in Spirit (the Holy Spirit) and in Truth (Jesus Christ: the Way, the Truth, and
the Life)". John 4:24.
The promised power of prayer is seldom put to work. "Ye have not because
ye ask not." Yet Jesus shows that prayer plays a vital role in God's way of
doing things:
"If you abide in Me, and my words abide in yoit, ask whatever you wish, and
it shall be done for you." John 15:7.
"Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you will receive,
I that your joy may be full." John 16:24.
Have you seen God's power working: in your life? Lack of faith is the reason
many Christian prayers are not answered. Claim on faith that which Jesus Christ
says He will do for all who seek to know His will and strength for their lives.
"But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all men
generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him. But let him a>k in
faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea
driven and tossed by the wind. For lit not that man except that he vill receive
I anything from the Lord. .. . F.very good thing bestowed and every perfect gift
I is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no
variation, or shifting shadow." (James 1:5-8,18).
If you know Jesus Christ personally and if you belong to Him (there will be
no doubt about this if it is true), your Christian life can lie as joyful and rich
as you are willing to let God make it. The power of prayer is limited by yonr
lack of faith and not by God. He has neither turned off the power nor changed
lis mind, hut is ready and able to do "exceeding abundantly above all that we
ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us." (Ephe-iati; ' .'id.

Prayer is man's two-way link with Cod. Prayer bridges the gap between two
worlds: the material world and the unseen sipritual world. Man, who can readily
I see and explore the material world, tends to think of it as the most important
world, and relegates the spiritual to a shadow or ghostly realm. In actual fact,
however, the unseen world created the visible, and will endure after the visible
world has passed away.
"By faith we. understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so
that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible." Hebrews 11:3
XASV. "... For the things which arc seen are temporal, hut the things which
arc not seen arc eternal." II Cor. 4:18.
God Himself is Spirit, and lie must be approached in prayer through the in
dwelling Holy Spirit, which is given to us by God when we put our faith in
Jesus Christ. "For God is Spirit and they that worship Hint must worship Hint
in Spirit (the Holy Spirit) and in Truth (Jesus Christ: the Way, the Truth, and
the Life)". John 4:24.
The promised power of prayer is seldom put to work. "Ye have not because
ye ask not." Yet Jesus shows that prayer plays a vital role in God's way of
doing things:
"If you abide in Me, and my words abide in yoit, ask whatever you wish, and
it shall be done for you." John 15:7.
"Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you will receive,
I that your joy may be full." John 16:24.
Have you seen God's power working: in your life? Lack of faith is the reason
many Christian prayers are not answered. Claim on faith that which Jesus Christ
says He will do for all who seek to know His will and strength for their lives.
"But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all men
generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him. But let him a>k in
faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea
driven and tossed by the wind. For lit not that man except that he vill receive
I anything from the Lord. .. . F.very good thing bestowed and every perfect gift
I is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no
variation, or shifting shadow." (James 1:5-8,18).
If you know Jesus Christ personally and if you belong to Him (there will be
no doubt about this if it is true), your Christian life can lie as joyful and rich
as you are willing to let God make it. The power of prayer is limited by yonr
lack of faith and not by God. He has neither turned off the power nor changed
lis mind, hut is ready and able to do "exceeding abundantly above all that we
ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us." (Ephe-iati; ' .'id.
