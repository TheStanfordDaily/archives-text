• y/o//rz To Lose Union Funds
WASHINGTON — A high Teamster Union

official said yesterday the union will "prob
ably" stop paying President James R. Hoffa's
legal expenses until the legality of such ex
penditures can be determined.
Harold J. Gibbons, a Teamster vice presi
dent, made the statement after another mem
ber of the Teamsters' executive board asked
that such expenditures be halted pending a
full review of the question.
The legality of paying Hoffa's heavy legal
bills arose when Teamsters' General Counsel
Edward Bennett Williams advised that it was
against the law and that executive board mem
bers could be held responsible for reimburs
ing the union treasury for any such funds.
Hoffa's legal expenses are estimated in the
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
• Tribunal Rejects Appeal
WASHINGTON — The lingering railroad
work-rules dispute moved another giant step
toward settlement yesterday when the Su
preme Court let stand an arbitration ruling

which could eliminate up to 48,000 jobs.
The tribunal rejected, X to 0, an appeal by
four on-train brotherhoods from the congros
sionally created arbitration board's ruling of
last November to allow dropping of firemen
and other crewmen whose jobs the carriers
find unnecessary.
The brotherhood could ask the Supreme
Court to reconsider its decision but the unani
mous vote is likely to discourage any such
step. The way is left open for the brother
hood to strike later on the job elimination
issue, after the arbitration runs out in 1966.
