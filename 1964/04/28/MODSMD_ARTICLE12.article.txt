The Frosh baseball team had to
come from behind twice last
weekend lo sweep a doubleheader
with San Jose State. Stanford
won the two seven-inning games
by 9 I and 3-1 margins.
In lhe first contest San Jose
scored twice in both the first and
the third before Stanford hit Ihe
scoreboard in the bottom of the
third. But once started, San Jose
couldn't turn the Frosh off as
the Indians scored in every frame
from that point on.
AT Tin: SAME time starting
pitcher Jim Blaschke was throw
ing goose-eggs at the Staters.
Blaschke finished up in fine style
as he didn't allow a run in any of
the last four innings.
Right fielder Dave Spe n c e
started the ball rolling in the
Stanford half of the third. With
a mate aboard he blasted a shot
between the centerfielder and
right fielder for a homerun.
Second baseman Mike Ottmar
and centerfielder Steve Hovley
kept the runs coming. Ottmar had
3 hits in 5 at bats and Hovley
knocked a triple.
TIIE FROSH had to go three
extra innings to defeat San Jose
in the,second game. San Jose
scored a single unearned run in
the third and made it last until
the seventh when Stanford scored
a run on a single by Pat Concan
non to score pinch-runner Marc
Evans.
With Daro Quiring blanking
San Jose from the third when he
came on, Frosh hitters finally
solved the opposing pitchers for
two runs in the tenth.
Mike Ottmar singled, Steve
Hovley tripled him home, and
Dick Swan hit a sacrifice fly to
bring across Hovley. In the bot
tom of the tenth the Frosh pulled
off a double play after a single,
and they won 3-1.
