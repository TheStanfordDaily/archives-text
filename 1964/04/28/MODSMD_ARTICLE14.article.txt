# Indian Rowers Downed By Cal
## 
### 
It was a sad day for four Stan
ford crews as Cal swept the dual
meet held Saturday morning at
Redwood City.
The first frosh boat with Don
Reider as Coxswain put up th e
best Indian effort of the flay as
it lost by only one length in the
2000-meter race with a time of
6:39.2 against a 6:35 recorded by
Cal.
The difference in times between
Stanford and Cal for the 1 varsity,
.TV, and second frosh races were
virtually identical. The varsity
boat, coxed by Gene Hermit 10,
lost by 10.2 seconds with a time of
6:22.2, after gelling off 1o a bad
start as the No. 4 man missed a
stroke.
In spite of a sprint at the end.
Ceil won by 2 1 lengths. The Cal
JV boat was clocked at 6:23
against 6:33 for Stanford, and the
Cal second frosh won with a time
of 6:40 against 6:50.2 for Stan
ford.
