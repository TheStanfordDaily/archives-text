# Gaels Next Tribe Foe; Then Bears
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball team goes
out after its sixteenth win of the
season this afternoon at St.
Mary's in a warmup for the Big
Series. A victory would put th e
Tribe one game over .500.
The game looks to be a breather
for Coach Dutch Fehring's boys,
and after the last weekend, which
saw three straight losses in Los
Angeles, they need a respite. The
three weekend defeats dropped
the Indian season record to 15-15,
with a dismal 2-11 in the CIBA.
THE TRIBE and the Gaels have
done battle once before this sea
son. on March 31, and Stanford
emerged an 11-1 victor. Dick
Kovacevich and Bob Hartwig han
dled the mound chores on that
flate.

Chances arc that tomorrow
Fehring will so with three pitch
ers in an effort to leave his staff
fairly fresh for the final two
games of the Big Series, coming
up this weekend. Off their per
formances last weekend, Hartwig,
Dave Dickson and Mike Connelly
are the most likely candidates.
St. Mary's had a disappointing
two days last weekend, in action
against San Jose State. They lost
both games lo the Spartans, one
on a no-hitter by Jim Fischer.
CHANCES ARE that either
Jerry Fitzpatrick or Steve Pruitt.
both of whom were pounded the
last time the two teams met, will
pitch for the Gaels today.
Leading batters for St. Mary's
are Harry Laiolo, who had a
double and single the last time he
faced Tribe pitching, and George
Peterson, who tripled and doubled
and scored the only Gael run.
