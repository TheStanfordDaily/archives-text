## How's The South? -It's Hell 
### PELL FENDER 
Miirlin Luther King, Jr. begins
the conference with a speech in
which he says he's glad the Bible
didn't ask him him to "like" his
enemy. To love your enemy with
a universal love is one thing, but
lo like Governor Wallace is an
other.
Robert Moses, speaking on Fri
day to Dr. McCord's Sociology 60
class, is asked the question,
"What do you think about inter
racial marriages?"
In his soft-spoken and mild

manner, Moses
r eco u nts in
slances in which
white babies
were born to
you n g Negro
girls, he talks
about Mississip
pi's guilt com-

plex over miscegenation. After a
few more sentences, Moses can
say no more, and there is silence
for half a minute. Finally another
student asks a question.
A SNCC Field Secretary, spend
ing his three days at a Stanford
fraternity, is asked by one of
the brothers, "How's the South?"
The Field Secretary replies in a
Mississippi drawl, "It's hell, man,
it's hell."
A Negro and a white are seen
walking together towards Cubber
ley Auditorium just before dark
on Friday night. They are talking
and laughing in subdued voices.
From time to time they sing a
freedom song.
Then, with more speeches, and
a party, the conference ends.
Delegates return to their respec
tive schools, Robert Moses and
his Field Secretaries are back in
Mississippi, and we're still in our
country club, wondering what
happened. Somehow, the silence is
deafening.
Up until a few days ago, Mis
sissippi was a no man's land, ex
plored only by people unknown
to most of us. Some of lis thought
them crazy to be lighting the
segregationists of Mississippi,
others of us thought them heroes.
But for a few days Mississippi
and her gadflies came alive.
With sympathy, and in some
cases, empathy, we tried to un
derstand and to comprehend stor
ies of lynehings, murders, and a
thousand other injustices; and we
failed to understand, because
we're white.
MOSES AND his workers took
back with them our self-assur
ance that we were doing some
thing. They took back with them
a lot of our pride in America. And.
perhaps most significantly, they
took back with them to Missis
sippi, our hearts.
For just a moment they got us
to see why New York City Ne
groes pull a stall-in, they got us
to see why Negroes face death
in order to get one man registered
in Greenwood, and they got us
to admit to ourselves that we
have a commitment, a commit
ment that goes to universal ex
tremes; and they gave us a chance
to drag ourselves down the road
of action.
One girl asked what she could
do for now. "Give money," was
one reply. "Oh, I feel so awful
giving money, it does so little."
SNCC workers haven't drawn a
s;ilary for six weeks; the Student
Voice, SNCC's nwespaper, hasn't
been published for a month.

tremes; and they gave us a chance
to drag ourselves down the road
of action.
One girl asked what she could
do for now. "Give money," was
one reply. "Oh, I feel so awful
giving money, it does so little."
SNCC workers haven't drawn a
s;ilary for six weeks; the Student
Voice, SNCC's nwespaper, hasn't
been published for a month.

Miirlin Luther King, Jr. begins
the conference with a speech in
which he says he's glad the Bible
didn't ask him him to "like" his
enemy. To love your enemy with
a universal love is one thing, but
lo like Governor Wallace is an
other.
Robert Moses, speaking on Fri
day to Dr. McCord's Sociology 60
class, is asked the question,
"What do you think about inter
racial marriages?"
In his soft-spoken and mild

manner, Moses
r eco u nts in
slances in which
white babies
were born to
you n g Negro
girls, he talks
about Mississip
pi's guilt com-

plex over miscegenation. After a
few more sentences, Moses can
say no more, and there is silence
for half a minute. Finally another
student asks a question.
A SNCC Field Secretary, spend
ing his three days at a Stanford
fraternity, is asked by one of
the brothers, "How's the South?"
The Field Secretary replies in a
Mississippi drawl, "It's hell, man,
it's hell."
A Negro and a white are seen
walking together towards Cubber
ley Auditorium just before dark
on Friday night. They are talking
and laughing in subdued voices.
From time to time they sing a
freedom song.
Then, with more speeches, and
a party, the conference ends.
Delegates return to their respec
tive schools, Robert Moses and
his Field Secretaries are back in
Mississippi, and we're still in our
country club, wondering what
happened. Somehow, the silence is
deafening.
Up until a few days ago, Mis
sissippi was a no man's land, ex
plored only by people unknown
to most of us. Some of lis thought
them crazy to be lighting the
segregationists of Mississippi,
others of us thought them heroes.
But for a few days Mississippi
and her gadflies came alive.
With sympathy, and in some
cases, empathy, we tried to un
derstand and to comprehend stor
ies of lynehings, murders, and a
thousand other injustices; and we
failed to understand, because
we're white.
MOSES AND his workers took
back with them our self-assur
ance that we were doing some
thing. They took back with them
a lot of our pride in America. And.
perhaps most significantly, they
took back with them to Missis
sippi, our hearts.
For just a moment they got us
to see why New York City Ne
groes pull a stall-in, they got us
to see why Negroes face death
in order to get one man registered
in Greenwood, and they got us
to admit to ourselves that we
have a commitment, a commit
ment that goes to universal ex
tremes; and they gave us a chance
to drag ourselves down the road
of action.
