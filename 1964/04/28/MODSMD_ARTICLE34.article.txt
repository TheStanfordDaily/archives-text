## Former Daily Co-Editor Writes Of Paul Baran 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Two years ago, when i was co
editor of the Daily, I went to Paul
Baran with some letters. They
were from Stanford graduates
and the gist of them was that
Baran was a Marxist and because
he admired Fidel Castro he should
he fired. Those letters, Ihe Stan
ford administration's reply to
them and Baran's comments be
came the heart of a series of
articles in the Daily.
Writing the articles was ab
surdly simple. All I had to do
was copy down Baran's thoughts
about how poorly academic free
dom was being defended by th e
president of a university that
aspired to greatness, lie knew
that by speaking for publication
he would be displeasing the ad
ministration. but he never hesi
tated.
Irony followed on irony and
the heirs of William Randolph
Hearst awarded me enough prize
money for that series to go a
long way in financing a year of
graduate school in New York.
While in the midst of that year
it struck me that I ought to in
form Baran of my good fortune
and his part in it. You may be
interested in some of his reply.
The letter was dated Feb. 19, 1963.
"Many thanks for your encour
aging words; they always help
sustain morale in what is, as you
well know, a rather lonesome
place. On the whole all is quiet
in the West. . . . My contacts with
the administration are zero: a
perfectly satisfactory situation as
far as I am concerned. I hope
you have a good time in New
York; keep in touch and let me
know how things develop."
I never answered, though I
guess I always meant to. Paul
Baran was the wisest and most
charming man I ever met and I
wish I had paid more attention
lo him while he was alive.

• Whose Problem?
Editor, The Daily:
Since you attack the stereotype,
"Black is Inferior," why do you
bulwark the stereotype, "White

is to Blame?" Your doctrine is
no more than a stale variant on
"Original Sin of Adam."
IF YOU WISH to discover who
is to blame for the violation of
certain citizens' rights, observe
that individual inalienable rights
can be violated only by initiating
the use of physical force. Since
no man is obliged to live for the
Isake of another, and since justice
cannot be rendered by vigilante
(committee, a bystander to any act
of violence is innocent.
Nor is every person within U.S.
I borders, or even every U.S. voter,
i responsible for "the plight of 'the
Negro.'" The actions taken by
I U.S. officials to end public school
segregation are farcical, because
j Federal government (and state
igovernment, as well) has no right
| to regulate education in any way
i whatsoever.
Further, residents and citizens
j who work for the cause of In
dividualism are not to blame for
the "social inequities" claimed by
a mob of parading "Righters."
The truth is that most such "in
equities" result not from society,
but from its absence: certainly,
J every man has the right to asso
ciate as he pleases, and every pri
jvate enterpriser has the right to
i sell to whomever he will.
DO NOT CONFUSE someone's
i claim on your life and liberty
in the name of his happiness -
with the individual inalienable
rights — which need not be
claimed — of Life, Liberty, a n d
i the Pursuit of Happiness. If you
wish to abolish legal inequity,
start by repealing the Poll Tax,
the graduated Income Tax, the
Rum ford Act, and Federal Wel-
I fare.

Editor, The Daily:
I wish lo point out some mis
representations in Mr. Lucas' at
| lack on Civil Rights groups in
last week's Daily.
.
; I. The petition was not "circu
lated in Wilbur Hall," but only
'in Soto House. "Soto House
! alone's" suggestion of other sup
port being misleading lo say the
j least. This is a small point per
' haps, but indicative of the qual
ity of Mr. Lucas' letter.
2. I very seriously question Mr.
Lucas' assertion" of "30 names"
from Soto. I have no written
: proof of my assertions, other
' than what I and others saw of
Ihe petitions. But. on the petition
on the third floor, I saw only 10
I signatures at the generous most,
and at least two of them were
those of the writers of the peti
tion. Also, according to a resident
i of the second floor, there were
1(5 signatures on that petition.
! Strangely enough, only one of
those people live in Soto, and that
one person didn't sign his na me
himself, nor did he want it there.
| The other 15 "names" were
I jokes in form and in intent, per
haps to ridicule Mr. Lucas' "san
' ity and objectivity."
Of course none of these asser
tions can be proved, as Mr. Lucas
has blotted out the 20 "names" he
! gave the Daily, "to prevent em
harassment" (whose. I wonder?).
In short Mr. Lucas: T chal
lenge your "objectivity and sin
j eerily."
