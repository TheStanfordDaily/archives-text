# MOVIE REVIEW
## 'Easy Life' Looks Honestly 
### FOSTER HIRSCH 
While (ho French haven't made
a really good film since "Last
Year al Marienbad," the Italians
keep adding to their ranks first
class directors with first-class
films. Dino Risi and"The Easy i
Life" are latest additions to this ;
; illustrious group.
Risi's film (now at the Guild in j
Menlo Park) follows the episodic
format which Ihe Italians have
mastered so well; the prototype]
[of this tradition, of course, is
Federico Fellini's "La Dolce
Vita" which was shown last Sat
urday night at Tresidder.
To be sure, both the structure
as well as the I heme of "The
Easy Life" bears a marked re-;
semblance to Fellini's film. The i
attention in both is focused on !
one character whose constant j
presence unites a series of other-1
wise disconnected episodes. Both
films, as well, portray essentially
| the same world of the Italian up
j perclass.
THE VIEWPOINTS from which
this society are seen, however, are j
different. "La Dolce Vita," for j
1 instance, follows the career of
i Marcello, a newspaper reporter*,
i who is at first uninvolved with
j "the sweet life" in which he tra
j vels; gradually and passively he
: submits to its decadence and dis
enchantment.
Risi's film, on the other hand,
is concerned with a person who
is from the begining a member
of (his easy life. He is, however,
a better representative of such;
a life than any of the people in
j "La Dolce Vita," for, unlike the
latter, he embodies the appeal as
well as the disillusionment of a
person who persistently uses his t
freedom to seek temporary thrills >
and excitement.
He introduces his way of life j
, to a rigid young law student, and
after a weekend of sports cars,
j villas, yachts, parties, and women,
; the inhibited student, like Mar-;
I cello, is entrapped; both are will
ing to renounce the conventional
: life of responsibility and system
' for the easy life of no work and
no thoughts but for the moment.
In "The Easy Life," the play
boy escapes as his car runs off a
I cliff, while the defenseless stu
i dent plunges to his death. For
I him, the easy life has led to the
j easy death.
Of the two films "La Dolce
Vita" is decidedly more ambi
tious. For almost every minute
of its three hours, it is a searing
j and profound indictment of that
| entire cross-section of modern so
ciety which has mislaid its pur
pose. It: is a relentless attack on
a society in which human rela
tions are based solely on sex,
aimless pleasure is the only goal,
and religion has become a sham.
"TIIE EASY LIFE" is appre
ciably smaller in scope and light
er in mood. Most of the way, in i
fact, il is a briskly paced comedy; !
indeed, the character of the play
boy, in his zest for life and in j
his ability for dealing with peo
pie, has been justly compared to
Tom Jones.
The comedy in the latter part
| of the film, however, becomes bit
tersweet, and the ending ap
proaches tragedy. The attitude
toward the world it depicts is as
shifting as the mood. The film by
turns applauds and criticizes the
world view of both the student
land Ihe playboy; if is, therefore,
, a more balanced piece than "La
Dolce Vita," which is after all
one-sided in its condemnation.
Nevertheless, "The Easy Life"
j lacks the depth and inclusiveness
of Fellini's film. While the inter
action between Ihe man and the
boy is beautifully realized, il re
it remains throughout a superbly
drawn, but basically limited char
acter study.
As ALWAYS among these top
rank Italian films, the perform
ances transcend mere acting.
Both Marcello Mastroianni in "La
1 Dolce Vita" and Vittorio Gassman
; in "The Easy Life," in their seem- j
jing effortlessness and natural
t ness, manage to create real peo-!
I Plo-
Typical, too, is the genuine at-;
! mosphere of modern Italy which j
j these films capture. Unlike many
American films, which glamorize!
everything they touch, the Ita
lians aren't afraid to look at them- :
selves unflatteringly and with
complete honesty.
Both Risi and Fellini are now
at work on their next films; one j
can only hope that they maintain
their high standard and thereby i
j continue to inspire new l'ilm-mak- j
ers in Italy and elsewhere
throughout the world wherever
film* are taken seriously.
