### 
"If academic freedom were to
disappear from the American
campus, it would be because the
faculty and the students had
neither the nerve nor the intelli
gence to sustain it." said Dr. Rus
sell Kirk yesterday afternoon in
an address to the Stanford Politi
cal Union in Cubberley Audito
rium.
Kirk, who has been termed "the
leading conscravtive political phil
osopher in America" by such
noted conservatives as Barry
Goldwatcr, listed two conditions
which are necessary for the pres
ervation of academic freedom.
His first condition is the exist
ence within the academy of h
body of professors with active
and just minds men dedicated to
truth, not to the indoctrination of
students with their own pet ideas
and theories.
His second condition is a body
of students genuinely interested
in and prepared for the considera
tion of first principles. Kirk
warned that if the students are
not competent to challenge and
encourage the professor, he will
lie tempted to become an indoc
trinator since his students seem
to want nothing more than indoc
trination.
