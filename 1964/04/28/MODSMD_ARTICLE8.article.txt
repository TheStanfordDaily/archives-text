# NEGRO PROBLEMS
## Solution Involves Nation 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN Feature Editor 
The problems facing the Negro today arc so
tightly interwoven that in essence their solution
lies in the correction of national problems the
need to create an economy strong enough to pro
vide jobs for the unemployed, the need to give the
laws of the country enough force to guarantee the
rights of citizenship to all citizens.
These are the terms in which Bob Moses, pro
gram director <>112 COFO and head of the Mississippi
Summer Project, in an interview with The Daily,
characterized the problem of obtaining equal
rights for the Negro. "The tactics aimed at individ
ual areas fail," Moses said, "and they really fall
because the problem of, say, schools, can't be
solved independently of an approach which in
cludes the question of jobs and housing."
TIIK (JUKSTION ultimately becomes one of
what action the federal government will be willing
to take. Moses stated. "And the federal govern
ment reflects the mood of the country," he noted.
"It is only willing to do a little more than the
country is prepared to see happen.
"In order to change southern politics, you will
need a national concensus on Hie problem." he
continued. "Democrats and Republicans, inde
pendent of politics, will have to agree to refuse
to cater to the Dixiecrats." The challenging of the
Mississippi delegation by COFO at the Democratic
National Convention this summer will represent
an attempt to make the Democratic parly act ac
cording to integrity instead of to politics, and, in
doine so. alter tin- basic structure of Mississippi

politics.
The southern politicians' domination of Con*
gress i.s reflected in the administration's inability
to pass programs which attempt to deal with
problems of northern ghetto areas on an inte
grated basis. "As it is now, there is no government
agency to pull together regional slum clearance,
school planning, and other urban problems." Moses
noted, blaming the defeat of Kennedy's proposed
cabinet post for "Urban Affairs" on southern
power in Congress.
"ANYTHING that moves toward the two-party
system will be a move toward ousting southern
politicians now in power precisely because of the
lack of opposition in elections," Moses noted.
"Hopefully," he said, "the project might prove
it is possible for the country to send its people
and resources to do constructive work and to act
as a eatylist for change. It might spur other na
tional agencies, including Ihe federal government,
to give support and funds." The students and fac
ulty coming from the north represent political
power and pressure from other areas of the coun
try, and both increased political pressure and
power will be necessary if the situation in Missis
sippi is to be changed.
THIS SUMMKK'S program is also concerned
with building a strong organization of Mississippi
Negroes, aimed toward such goals as voler regis
tration and election of delegates to challenge the
Mississippi Democratic delegation.
"One thing lhat might happen from this sum
mer's project." Moses added, "is a beginning of
the concept of people earning Iheir living in terms
oi hclDinc otilers."
