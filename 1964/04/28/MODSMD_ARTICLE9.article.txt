# MORSE CASE
## Confusion, Bad Timing Plagued Italy Hearings Pertinent Facts Overlooked On Last Day Of Residence 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Staff Writer 
FLORENCE, Italy (Special to The Daily) — As seen from the
Florence campus, the case of Frank Morse was a combination of
poor timing, hasty proceedings and reluctant student cooperation.
The public retrial of Morse before the Judicial Council of the
Associated Students of Stanford Universit\ (ASSI ) raised ques-

tions of judicial procedure at the
home campus that needed to be
cleared up, but in the furor over
jurisdiction, some pertinent facts
about the case were either mis
stated. omitted, or. perhaps, un
known.
ACCORDING TO Dr. Guelfo
Frulla, director of studies, two
facts hampered and confused the
first Morse trial, which took place
at the Florence campus:
First, and most importantly,
Morse's vandalistic act was com
mitted on the last day of resi
dence for the Italy VII group
Wednesday, March 11. This meant
that Morse's case had to go before
the Cabinet —• five student offi
cers elected for the Winter Quar
ter — that night.
"THUS," declared Frulla,
"Morse's contention (as stated in
an article in the April 1(5 Daily)
that he was not given adequate
time to prepare a defense is in
valid. The whole group was break
ing up the next day; indeed, two
members of the Cabinet were
going to leave early the following
morning."
The hasty Cabinet meeting that
was summoned that Wednesday
night to discuss the problem soon
ran into difficulty. Although five
door panels had been smashed,
the Cabinet had not been able to
collect any evidence by 11:30 p.m.
that evening. At that time, Tom
Connoughton, president of th e
group, reported that the Cabinet
had run into a "wall of silence"
and was unah'r ,o make any find
ings.
Frulla went to t lie room where
the Cabinet was meeting and told
the Cabinet two things:
• He would have to launch an
investigation if the Cabinet could
not solve the case.

• It would be intolerable to
drop the case.
"This was the worst act of van
dalism at Villa San Paolo in our
three years of existence," Dr.
Giuseppe Mammarella. director
of administration, declared, "yet
many of the students felt that
since they had only one night
left at the campus they could
wash their hands of the whole
affair and forget it."
THK CABINET continued their
investigation.
Finally, around 2 a.m., a deci
sion was reached. Morse and Ron
ald Langstaff were both given
five corp yard hours and re
quested to pay damages. Morse
left the villa immediately to tra
vel. Connaughton wrote a letter
to Frulla explaining the Cabinet's
decision "a routine procedure
since there are no minutes of
Cabinet meetings and investiga
tions." Frulla explained.
When the Administrative Re
view Committee met the next day,
Frulla discovered the second ma
jor fact that has since confused
the issue: the Cabinet was un
aware that this was Morse's sec
ond infraction.
MOUSE IIAI) broken a panel
once before in November, Frulla
continued. "But at that time we
decided to drop the charge since
Frank was under a strain due to
a family tragedy. He was only
given some library hours and
charged for the damage." This
case was handled by the Cabinet
elected for the Fall Quarter; thus
the new Cabinet was not aware
of Morse's previous infraction.
Of the four members of the
Review Committee Frulla,
Mammarella, Professor Lawrence
Ryan of the English Department,
and Professor Morris Zelditch of
the Sociology Department three
were present at the first meeting
the next morning, and Ryan
joined the group in the afternoon
meeting. All fo u r members
agreed that the decision in
Morse's case was too lenient, both
directors said, and all four wrote
concurring reports to the home
campus.
(This contradicts a statement
made by Darrell Halverson, chair
man of Men's Council, printed in
the April 1(5 Daily, 1o the effect
that "One of the members was
not present. . . . (and> there was
not unanimity among the mem
bers present on the punishment
for the act.")
ANOTHER REASON lor the
committee's recommendation was
that Father Ilienzi, the repre
sentative of the Barnabiti Order
that owns the Villa, said that the
incident was extremely regret
table (and since the incident, each
student must now pay ;i $.">() room
deposit before coming to Italy).
After adding the committee's
recommendation to the Cabinet's
findings, Frulla sent the letter to
Dr. Walker, Director of Overseas
Campuses, for further action
since it was impossible to recall
the Cabinet, which was now scat
tered over two continents.
Frulla did not know whether
Walker would send the case to
Men's Council or the Dean of
Students; this decision was made
at the Farm and is the butt of
the current ASSU-Adminislration
clash over jurisdiction.

collect any evidence by 11:30 p.m.
that evening. At that time, Tom
Connoughton, president of th e
group, reported that the Cabinet
had run into a "wall of silence"
and was unah'r ,o make any find
ings.
Frulla went to t lie room where
the Cabinet was meeting and told
the Cabinet two things:
• He would have to launch an
investigation if the Cabinet could
not solve the case.

• It would be intolerable to
drop the case.
"This was the worst act of van
dalism at Villa San Paolo in our
three years of existence," Dr.
Giuseppe Mammarella. director
of administration, declared, "yet
many of the students felt that
since they had only one night
left at the campus they could
wash their hands of the whole
affair and forget it."
THK CABINET continued their
investigation.
Finally, around 2 a.m., a deci
sion was reached. Morse and Ron
ald Langstaff were both given
five corp yard hours and re
quested to pay damages. Morse
left the villa immediately to tra
vel. Connaughton wrote a letter
to Frulla explaining the Cabinet's
decision "a routine procedure
since there are no minutes of
Cabinet meetings and investiga
tions." Frulla explained.
When the Administrative Re
view Committee met the next day,
Frulla discovered the second ma
jor fact that has since confused
the issue: the Cabinet was un
aware that this was Morse's sec
ond infraction.
MOUSE IIAI) broken a panel
once before in November, Frulla
continued. "But at that time we
decided to drop the charge since
Frank was under a strain due to
a family tragedy. He was only
given some library hours and
charged for the damage." This
case was handled by the Cabinet
elected for the Fall Quarter; thus
the new Cabinet was not aware
of Morse's previous infraction.
Of the four members of the
Review Committee Frulla,
Mammarella, Professor Lawrence
Ryan of the English Department,
and Professor Morris Zelditch of
the Sociology Department three
were present at the first meeting
the next morning, and Ryan
joined the group in the afternoon
meeting. All fo u r members
agreed that the decision in
Morse's case was too lenient, both
directors said, and all four wrote
concurring reports to the home
campus.
(This contradicts a statement
made by Darrell Halverson, chair
man of Men's Council, printed in
the April 1(5 Daily, 1o the effect
that "One of the members was
not present. . . . (and> there was
not unanimity among the mem
bers present on the punishment
for the act.")
ANOTHER REASON lor the
committee's recommendation was
that Father Ilienzi, the repre
sentative of the Barnabiti Order
that owns the Villa, said that the
incident was extremely regret
table (and since the incident, each
student must now pay ;i $.">() room
deposit before coming to Italy).
After adding the committee's
recommendation to the Cabinet's
findings, Frulla sent the letter to
Dr. Walker, Director of Overseas
Campuses, for further action
since it was impossible to recall
the Cabinet, which was now scat
tered over two continents.
Frulla did not know whether
Walker would send the case to
Men's Council or the Dean of
Students; this decision was made
at the Farm and is the butt of
the current ASSU-Adminislration
clash over jurisdiction.
FLORENCE, Italy (Special to The Daily) — As seen from the
Florence campus, the case of Frank Morse was a combination of
poor timing, hasty proceedings and reluctant student cooperation.
The public retrial of Morse before the Judicial Council of the
Associated Students of Stanford Universit\ (ASSI ) raised ques-

tions of judicial procedure at the
home campus that needed to be
cleared up, but in the furor over
jurisdiction, some pertinent facts
about the case were either mis
stated. omitted, or. perhaps, un
known.
ACCORDING TO Dr. Guelfo
Frulla, director of studies, two
facts hampered and confused the
first Morse trial, which took place
at the Florence campus:
First, and most importantly,
Morse's vandalistic act was com
mitted on the last day of resi
dence for the Italy VII group
Wednesday, March 11. This meant
that Morse's case had to go before
the Cabinet —• five student offi
cers elected for the Winter Quar
ter — that night.
"THUS," declared Frulla,
"Morse's contention (as stated in
an article in the April 1(5 Daily)
that he was not given adequate
time to prepare a defense is in
valid. The whole group was break
ing up the next day; indeed, two
members of the Cabinet were
going to leave early the following
morning."

was summoned that Wednesday
night to discuss the problem soon

meeting. All fo u r members
agreed that the decision in
Morse's case was too lenient, both
directors said, and all four wrote
concurring reports to the home
campus.

FLORENCE, Italy (Special to The Daily) — As seen from the
Florence campus, the case of Frank Morse was a combination of
poor timing, hasty proceedings and reluctant student cooperation.
The public retrial of Morse before the Judicial Council of the
Associated Students of Stanford Universit\ (ASSI ) raised ques-

tions of judicial procedure at the
home campus that needed to be
cleared up, but in the furor over
jurisdiction, some pertinent facts
about the case were either mis
stated. omitted, or. perhaps, un
known.
ACCORDING TO Dr. Guelfo
Frulla, director of studies, two
facts hampered and confused the
first Morse trial, which took place
at the Florence campus:
First, and most importantly,
Morse's vandalistic act was com
mitted on the last day of resi
dence for the Italy VII group
Wednesday, March 11. This meant
that Morse's case had to go before
the Cabinet —• five student offi
cers elected for the Winter Quar
ter — that night.
"THUS," declared Frulla,
"Morse's contention (as stated in
an article in the April 1(5 Daily)
that he was not given adequate
time to prepare a defense is in
valid. The whole group was break
ing up the next day; indeed, two
members of the Cabinet were
going to leave early the following
morning."
The hasty Cabinet meeting that
was summoned that Wednesday
night to discuss the problem soon
ran into difficulty. Although five
door panels had been smashed,
the Cabinet had not been able to
collect any evidence by 11:30 p.m.
that evening. At that time, Tom
Connoughton, president of th e
group, reported that the Cabinet
had run into a "wall of silence"
and was unah'r ,o make any find
ings.
Frulla went to t lie room where
the Cabinet was meeting and told
the Cabinet two things:
• He would have to launch an
investigation if the Cabinet could
not solve the case.

• It would be intolerable to
drop the case.
"This was the worst act of van
dalism at Villa San Paolo in our
three years of existence," Dr.
Giuseppe Mammarella. director
of administration, declared, "yet
many of the students felt that
since they had only one night
left at the campus they could
wash their hands of the whole
affair and forget it."
THK CABINET continued their
investigation.
Finally, around 2 a.m., a deci
sion was reached. Morse and Ron
ald Langstaff were both given
five corp yard hours and re
quested to pay damages. Morse
left the villa immediately to tra
vel. Connaughton wrote a letter
to Frulla explaining the Cabinet's
decision "a routine procedure
since there are no minutes of
Cabinet meetings and investiga
tions." Frulla explained.
When the Administrative Re
view Committee met the next day,
Frulla discovered the second ma
jor fact that has since confused
the issue: the Cabinet was un
aware that this was Morse's sec
ond infraction.
