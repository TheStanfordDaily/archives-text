You Think There Is No God?
Atheists all agree on at least one thing: that there is no God. They reject
Theism, Deism, Pantheism, Polytheism, and Animism as inadequate, false, or
foolish —or a bit of all three.
Our enemy is Gcd. Hatred of God is the beginning of wisdom." Gus
tave Flourens.
' There is no God; it is clear as the sun and as evident as the day that
there is no God, and still more that there can be none." Feuerbach.
There are several discernable groups among the atheists. The Dogmatic
Atheists believe that God absolutely does not exist and give certain alleged
evidence of this fact. The Skeptical Atheists claim that man does not have
the ability to ascertain whether or not there is a God. Therefore, the ques
tion is senseless. (This is quite different from the claim of the Agnostic who
says "We just don't know if there is a God"). The Critical Atheists reject
the existence of God which has been presented. And then there is Practical
Atheism which is not a kind of thought or opinion, but a mode of life. It
may coexist with an unconscious belief in the being of God and is essentially i
the living of life as if there were no God.
The statement "There is no God' is in direct contrast to the claims of
Christianity. For Christians assert that history was invaded by God Himself
in the Person of Jesus Christ.
The Bible reserves its strongest words for those who deny the existence
of God:
"The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God." Ps. 14:1.
"The fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise j
wisdom and instruction." Proverbs 1:7.
"For all that may be known of God by men lies plain before their eyes;
indeed, God himself has disclosed it to them. His invisible attributes, that is |
to say his everlasting power and deity, have been visible ever since the world
began, to the eye of reason, and in the things which are made. There is,
therefore, no possible defence for their conduct; knowing God, they have
refused to honor him as God or to render him thanks. Hence all their think
ing has ended in futildy, and their misguided minds are plunged in dark
ness. They boast of their wisdom, but they have made fools of themselves."
Romans 1:19-22 (N.E.)
These are fighting words. Christians claim that the atheists, while giving
great attention to careful reasoning, have become fools because of their re
jection of God.
God ir» a Person. He can be met, talked to, and communed with on a
personal basis. However, it is not possible to know Him through intellectual I
sophistry. He asks for your total commitment to Jesus Christ after which he
unfailingly reveals Himself to the individual.

Romans 1:19-22 (N.E.)
These are fighting words. Christians claim that the atheists, while giving
great attention to careful reasoning, have become fools because of their re
jection of God.
God ir» a Person. He can be met, talked to, and communed with on a
personal basis. However, it is not possible to know Him through intellectual I
sophistry. He asks for your total commitment to Jesus Christ after which he
unfailingly reveals Himself to the individual.

You Think There Is No God?
Atheists all agree on at least one thing: that there is no God. They reject
Theism, Deism, Pantheism, Polytheism, and Animism as inadequate, false, or
foolish —or a bit of all three.
Our enemy is Gcd. Hatred of God is the beginning of wisdom." Gus
tave Flourens.
' There is no God; it is clear as the sun and as evident as the day that
there is no God, and still more that there can be none." Feuerbach.
There are several discernable groups among the atheists. The Dogmatic
Atheists believe that God absolutely does not exist and give certain alleged
evidence of this fact. The Skeptical Atheists claim that man does not have
the ability to ascertain whether or not there is a God. Therefore, the ques
tion is senseless. (This is quite different from the claim of the Agnostic who
says "We just don't know if there is a God"). The Critical Atheists reject
the existence of God which has been presented. And then there is Practical
Atheism which is not a kind of thought or opinion, but a mode of life. It
may coexist with an unconscious belief in the being of God and is essentially i
the living of life as if there were no God.
The statement "There is no God' is in direct contrast to the claims of
Christianity. For Christians assert that history was invaded by God Himself
in the Person of Jesus Christ.
The Bible reserves its strongest words for those who deny the existence
of God:
"The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God." Ps. 14:1.
"The fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise j
wisdom and instruction." Proverbs 1:7.
"For all that may be known of God by men lies plain before their eyes;
indeed, God himself has disclosed it to them. His invisible attributes, that is |
to say his everlasting power and deity, have been visible ever since the world
began, to the eye of reason, and in the things which are made. There is,
therefore, no possible defence for their conduct; knowing God, they have
refused to honor him as God or to render him thanks. Hence all their think
ing has ended in futildy, and their misguided minds are plunged in dark
ness. They boast of their wisdom, but they have made fools of themselves."
