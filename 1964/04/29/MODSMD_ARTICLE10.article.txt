# Disputed Election Rule Declared Null And Void
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Staff Editor 
An ASSU by-law which in of
! feet disqualifies most of the pres
] ont candidates for senior class.
I offices is invalid, according to Ed '
I Shaw. Student Financial man
ager.
The by-law defines a senior as ;
a student with at least 145 aca
demic units; the average senior
j does not have that many units un- j
! til the beginning of winter quar
j ter.
SHAW told The Daily that the j
i requirement may in fact be a
"typographical error" or a mis- (
take in transcribing. Hut it is in '
any case invalid, he said, because j
it was not included in the min- i
jules of the LASSU meeting at
! which it was passed.
Shaw said that any rulings that
j may have to be made on eligibil
ity will have to fall back on the
old by-law deadling with the mat
ter. That by-law defines a senior j
as a member of the class with!
which he wishes to graduate.
His opinion was the result of |
an investigation he conducted as
ja result of several queries he has
i received from persons connected
| with the current: campaign.
THIS 145-UNIT requirements is
; part of a set of by-laws passed
i last spring in connection with the
j referendum that abolished the
i freshman, sophomore, and junior
! classes.
At that time it was decided to
j retain the senior class, and the
i by-laws concerning class govern
ment were re-written.
But although the disputed re
quirement has been printed as a
by-law. it was never included as
part of t lie minutes, which is a re
' quircment which must be met for
, legislation to go into force.
