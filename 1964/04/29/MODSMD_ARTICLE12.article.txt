# Wert Forecasts 'Rebirth' Of Liberal Arts Education

### 
WASHINGTON, D.C. — The American liberal arts college is
neither dead nor dying, Vice-Provost Robert J. Wert said Sunday.
In fact, undergraduate institutions now have "the finest op
portunity in their history to educate liberally the most exciting
students they've ever had," he told the 1964 Stanford Conference

in Washington.
RECENTLY named Stanford's
first dean of undergraduate edu
cation, Wert said "astonishing
improvements" in high school ed
ucation plus rapidly rising expec
tations for graduate study have
set the stage for a "resplendent
rebirth" of undergraduate liberal
education.
"Colleges may now seriously

consider devoting all four under
graduate years to general or lib
eral studies," he said. "They are
no longer hampered by the pool
preparation of freshmen or en
tangled with the necessity to of
fer majors or concentrations for
students who will not have a later
chance to specialize."
Four out of five Stanford fresh
men now intend to pursue grad
uate work, Wert noted—and it's
not uncommon for more than hall"
the graduates of many colleges
to proceed beyond the bachelor's
degree.
THE KEY question is whether
the best colleges of the future
will specialize in the'pattern of
graduate schools or capitalize on
what Wert called "a superb op
portunity to broaden (their* edu
cational base and lengthen (their>
course of liberal studies."
The best undergraduate pro
grams will be based on the liberal
approach, he predicted, because
this is what society needs and
what talented students seek.
Stanford's approach to improv
ing its undergraduate program
will be evolutionary not revolu
tionary, Dean Wert added:
"Revolutionary reforms in com
plex universities are neither very
possible any more nor very de
sirable.
"If enough ideas have been
tested, the net effects over time
will approximate the effects of
radical revolution without risk of
the invidious side effects which
revolutions can spawn."
