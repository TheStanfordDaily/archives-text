# ACCION Calls For Volunteers
## 
### HILDA KOSSOFF 
ACCION, the Venezuelan community development project, is
recruiting at Stanford this week for the next group of workers, to
start work in June. Volunteers wil leave for training soon after
graduation.
They will spend 15 months in Venezuela, paired with Venezue-

Lan partners in the "barrios," poor
urban districts which surround
Caracas, Valencia, and other largo
cities. Barrio-dwellers are mostly
rural people, newly come to the
cities. Housing is poor, schools
few, job opportunities meagre —
and problems are worsened by an
old tradition of patrnalism which
generally leaves these people
waiting for aid to come from
above.
ACTION WORKERS live in the
barrios. They get to know their
neighbors, and learn the problems
that trouble them. The program

stresses organizing an attack on
conditions the citizens find bother
some.
"The community decides th e
project —- we don't," explained
Stanford graduate Talton Ray,
Assistant Director of ACCION
for ihe past two years. The first
project in an area is usually a
small one, like building a flight
of stairs or a game court. Volun
teers help out and see that the
people follow through. As confi
dence and a sense of responsibil
ity grows, more ambitious things
are undertaken a community
center, a night school program.
Seventy per cent of the financ
ing comes from Venezuelan
firms; the remainder from the
United States. ACCION is still
localized in Venezuela, but hopes
to expand soon.
TALTON RAY and his wife
Lilli, once an exchange student
from Germany, are on campus
this week to contact interested
students. They will be talking to
professor's and addressing classes
in political science and geog
raphy.
Organizational ability and in
terest am needed qualifications;
technical knowledge is not neces
sary. Even the Spanish language
will be taught in an intensive 6-
week program. Volunteers are
paid travel costs and expenses
while in Venezuela, but no other
salary.
Ray will be available for con
sultation in the Placement Office
this afternoon from 1 to 4. Any
one wishing to contact him at an
other time should leave a mes
sage with Mr. Lowe in the Office.

project in an area is usually a
small one, like building a flight
of stairs or a game court. Volun
teers help out and see that the
people follow through. As confi
dence and a sense of responsibil
ity grows, more ambitious things
are undertaken a community
center, a night school program.
Seventy per cent of the financ
ing comes from Venezuelan
firms; the remainder from the
United States. ACCION is still
localized in Venezuela, but hopes
to expand soon.
TALTON RAY and his wife
Lilli, once an exchange student
from Germany, are on campus
this week to contact interested
students. They will be talking to
professor's and addressing classes
in political science and geog
raphy.
Organizational ability and in
terest am needed qualifications;
technical knowledge is not neces
sary. Even the Spanish language
will be taught in an intensive 6-
week program. Volunteers are
paid travel costs and expenses
while in Venezuela, but no other
salary.
Ray will be available for con
sultation in the Placement Office
this afternoon from 1 to 4. Any
one wishing to contact him at an
other time should leave a mes
sage with Mr. Lowe in the Office.
