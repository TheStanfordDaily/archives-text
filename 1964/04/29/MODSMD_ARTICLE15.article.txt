# TV Teaching Shown Today
## 
### 
A new method of using televi
sion in the training of teachers
will be demonstrated today at
Stanford.
The TV project, directed by
Prof. Robert N. Bush and sup
ported by the Ford Foundation,
enables a prospective teacher to
see himself in action, just as the
members of the class see him
from their seats.
THE STANFORD demonstra
tion, entitled "TV Recording and
Teacher Training," will be held
at noon in Room B2 of the Edu
cation Building. The demonstra
tion, sponsored by the Education
Council, will be conducted by
Prof. Bush's two research assist
ants Keith A. Acheson and A 1
Robertson.
Reactions to the project have
so far been favorable, according
to Education Council President
Wadleigh. Interns feel the taped
teaching performances offer more
of an opportunity for objective
criticism. Both the intern and the
superior can evaluate the presen
tation from the same vantage
point, rerunning the tape in order
to assess the strengths and weak
nesses of the performance.
