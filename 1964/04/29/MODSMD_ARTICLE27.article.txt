# Spring Football
## 
### 
Four of the Iwenty spring
practices arc over, and what the
sideline fans and the coaches have
seen so l'ar has been for the mosi
part impressive.
AH or the firsl serious head
knocking Salurday. the coaches
made numerous switches in the
lineups. Several freshmen, who
had not landed places on the first
two units in the initial placings,
i among them A 1 Wilhurn. John
Read, and Dave Lewis, showed
well and have moved up.
Wilhurn, shone at the defensive
end position, turning in plays and
making tackles.
Head Coach John Ralston, w ho
deals out unqualified compliments
rarely, said quarterback Lewis's
; Saturday performance was "out
standing for a freshman." Guard
Bruce Kehrli, of the oldlimers,
looked especially good.
The three top units, the Red,
j Green, and Blue squads, are all
| getting equal attention from the
! coaches. Quarterbacks Dick Berg,
i Terry DeSylvia, Don Cook, and
Lewis, as much as possible spend
I the same amount of time with
each of the four top squads so
I that they will have an equal
chance to show their worth.
