## Edgar-UP; A Sparkling New Mix 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
A couple of months ago. a
group calling itself the University
Party suddenly appeared on cam
pus, and, in a few brief days, just
as suddenly disappeared. But the
HP's ghost lives on, in the camp
of ASSU Presidential candidate
Edgar Kaiser.
For it seems that Edgar, in a
dramatic coup, captured the lead
ership of that late, defunct cam
pus party, or perhaps visa versa.
But no matter who captured
whom, the result is the same, Ed-

gar and 1 he boys
from the Univer
sity Party arc
running hand in
hand toward tho
soon to bo va
cated office of
President Bu d
Wed in.

Greatest among the spoils of
war now in Edgar's camp, is the
UP's platform, which, with a
few tactical alterations to fit the
situation, gives Edgar the pretti
est platform of any candidate for
the office.

ONE OK THE planks in the
Edgar-UP all-purpose Presiden
tial platform calls for the estab
lishment of campus political par
ties, an understandable request
for Edgar to make since parties
have already shown their value
by supplying him with a whole
cartload of ideas for his cam
paign. With a two-party system,
we might find Edgar with two
sets of ideas, or perhaps two sets
of Edgars.
Edgar's carrying the ball for
the University Party now, and
only one question remains to he
answered: Who's calling the sig
nal's, Edgar or his teammates?
One clue to the answer might be
a comment by a friend of Edgar:
"I nsp i t e of what everyone
thinks," ho said, "Hd's not a
leader."
But Edgar does have other ad
vantages besides a stable of clever
platform writers, and a slightly
time-worn nucleus of a political
party. First, he is a pleasant per
son. Second, he's had experience
planning card stunts for the foot
ball games, and has done a fine
job as President of Axe Commis
sion. Third, he is well known, and
possibly closer to the University
hierarchy than any of the other
candidates.
He leaves no doubt that the ad
ministrators think he's a grand
fellow, and that ideas by Edgar
count double in their minds. Of
course Edgar, as a friend to stu
dents. does not count their ideas
double, but at least, Edgar main
tains. tho disagreement would be
kept between friends. As 1 said,
Edgar is a very friendly guy.
Another candidate on the ballot
with Edgar is definitely suffer
ing from lack of UP's advice. That
is Steve Gruber, a sophomore
whose major qualification for the
office of ASSU President is. as he
admits, that he is a student here.
★ ★ ★
IF THE University Party has
any extra platforms, I suggest i
that they see Gruber. In fact, they j
might even loan Edgar's platform
to Gruber for a couple of days,
if he promises to return it when
he's finished. After all, if the
UP's platform is good enough for
Edgar Kaiser, it ought to be good
enough for any of the other can
didates.
Gruber does maintain that he
really has a program for Stan
ford. However, he has only re
vealed part of it at this time. And
perhaps if he wishes to bo re
garded as a genuine candidate, ho
might be wiser to keep the rest of
his ideas secret. For abolishing
the Legislature and in its place
holding mass student meetings in
the Stadium, docs not. really seem
practical.
For example, what would be
done during football season? Be
sides ttie Legislature might be
more inclined to abolish Gruber
than themselves, that is, of course
if tho voters fail to eliminate him
first.
But with Edgar-UP and Gruber
running, this election ought to be
interesting, if not stimulating, at
least until after the primary elec
tion. For with four candidates
running, two will be gone after
the May (i-7 election. Anil I've got
;i feeling i know which two will
lie watching the final election
I mm Iho sidelines.
