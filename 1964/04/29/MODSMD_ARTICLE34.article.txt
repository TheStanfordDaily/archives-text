## Philosophy Of Individual Devoid Of Any Humanity 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Such a noted conservative as
Russell Kirk has said that to en
joy academic freedom, that is, to
speak freely in iho academy, one
j must be wise and good. Wisdom,
j however defined, implies being in
j some ways aware of the world
around oneself.
Then perhaps it is enough com
i ment on Fred Havvley's letter of
the 29th of April, to say that a
constitutional amendment pro
hibiting poll taxes was passed
two months before Mr. Hawley
sounded the clarion call for their
repeal.
BUT ONE should not reject his
letter for one egregious inaccu
racy. Still there are enough
others. Yet life is too short and
three hundred words too precious
to examine every one. His ex ca
thedra announcement, however,
that 'no man is obliged to live for
another' is worthy of comment
even if rather unoriginal.
In such enlightened places as
great universities, perhaps it is
unwise to quote the Bible in oppo
sition to Ayn Rand.
In Genesis -1:9, God asks Cain
where his brother is? Cain, Iho
original 'innocent bystander.' says
he does not know and anyway, is
he his brother's keeper? Whether
! the conversation took place is
: open to question, but the view it
I expresses is one which Judao-
Christian tradition has ascribed
to for a long time now.
LIKE CAIN, like the Russians
who waited outside Warsaw while
the Germans crushed the Poles
in 1944, like the thirty-odd people,
in Now York, who watched a
woman be attacked three times,
watched her die on their door
step, and then called the police,
Mr. Hawley would like to believe
he is an 'innocent bystander.'
Like them, Mr. Hawley says
even if we hear the bell toll, we
should not ask for whom. A pity,
for it tolls lor him since his phil
osophy of individuality is just
as devoid of humanity as a dead
carcass is.

I would like to express my
sympathy for Mr. Hawley's ex
treme misfortune in being born
in the 20th century. It: is a shame
to see the intellectual talents of
one so obviously suited for the
19th century go to waste in the
| modern world.
Or perhaps wasteful is not the
adjective. Might I suggest, with
all flue temerity in the face of
Mr. Hawley's forceful if not logi
cal arguments, that his thoughts
are, rather, harmful, even evil?
YOU SAY that physical force
alone can violate right, Mr. Haw
ley. Ait 1 you physically forced to
pay Income Tax, which you feel
is a denial of your rights? Intel
ligent people have recognized for
over a hundred years now that
. physical force is only the last re
' sort, when all the many other,
more subtle means of denying
rights have failed.
You speak of the "innocent by
stander." Would you call a man
who merely stood by and watched
you being killed, while capable of
j preventing it, innocent? I don't
I think so.
What then of your "residents
and citizens who work for the
I cause of Individualism?" I ehal
j lenge you to show me one person
who works for the right lo !><•

denied any protection or privi
leges provided him by the gov
ernment or society, to rely on
himself alone in the face of op*
presion for that is what your
■ brand of individualism implies Mr.
j Hawley.
I THINK your residents a n d
| citizens are more afraid of being
pushed into a position where they
j have to think for once, where
they have to look beyond the
I warm cocoon of the good life and
i realize the misery existing out
' side that very small area. They
might feel badly then; heavens,
they might even feel a little
guilty.
You say "every man" has th e
right to associate with whom he
pleases. I wasn't aware that the
word every meant white today
Mr. Hawley.
The Negro's rights, to use an
oft quoted phrase, end where
your nose begins as I'm sure
you would agree. But the neces
sary corollary is that your rights
end where his nose begins. When
and only when this is achieved
will it be possible, perhaps, to
think again of your precious "In
dividualism."

Stanford Today and Tomor
row is a student organized activ

structure -whose programs aim
to create closer and warmer con
tact between students and mem
bers of the faculty and adminis
tration, and to provide students
with the opportunity to hear and
to voice opinions concerning the
future of the University.
THE FOUR YEARS of college
represent a considerable invest
ment: of energies, time, money,
and thought for any undergradu
ate, particularly an undergradu
ate at a private university such
as Stanford. The concentration of
great and articulate minds and
of divergent ideas which char
acterize a university, and the rela
tive freedom of most undergadu
ates from the responsibilities of
a full-time job, and of a wife and
family allow for an immeasurably
worthwhile experience of growth,
learning, and self-development, or
a four year continuum of missed
opportunities.
Viewed in the broadest sense,
the purpose of the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee is
to increase the number of these
opportunities made use of, and to
enrich the worth of every stu
dent's years at Stanford. S.T.&T.
acts toward this general aim on
the supposition that knowledge
of. participation in. and construc
tive and sometimes critical loy
alty to Stanford are essential in
gredients of the most worthwhile
four years experience of Stan

Such a noted conservative as
Russell Kirk has said that to en
joy academic freedom, that is, to
speak freely in iho academy, one
j must be wise and good. Wisdom,
j however defined, implies being in
j some ways aware of the world
around oneself.
Then perhaps it is enough com
i ment on Fred Havvley's letter of
the 29th of April, to say that a
constitutional amendment pro
hibiting poll taxes was passed
two months before Mr. Hawley
sounded the clarion call for their
repeal.
BUT ONE should not reject his
letter for one egregious inaccu
racy. Still there are enough
others. Yet life is too short and
three hundred words too precious
to examine every one. His ex ca
thedra announcement, however,
that 'no man is obliged to live for
another' is worthy of comment
even if rather unoriginal.
In such enlightened places as
great universities, perhaps it is
unwise to quote the Bible in oppo
sition to Ayn Rand.
In Genesis -1:9, God asks Cain
where his brother is? Cain, Iho
original 'innocent bystander.' says
he does not know and anyway, is
he his brother's keeper? Whether
! the conversation took place is
: open to question, but the view it
I expresses is one which Judao-
Christian tradition has ascribed
to for a long time now.
LIKE CAIN, like the Russians
who waited outside Warsaw while
the Germans crushed the Poles
in 1944, like the thirty-odd people,
in Now York, who watched a
woman be attacked three times,
watched her die on their door
step, and then called the police,
Mr. Hawley would like to believe
he is an 'innocent bystander.'
Like them, Mr. Hawley says
even if we hear the bell toll, we
should not ask for whom. A pity,
for it tolls lor him since his phil
osophy of individuality is just
as devoid of humanity as a dead
carcass is.

I would like to express my
sympathy for Mr. Hawley's ex
treme misfortune in being born
in the 20th century. It: is a shame
to see the intellectual talents of
one so obviously suited for the
19th century go to waste in the
| modern world.
Or perhaps wasteful is not the
adjective. Might I suggest, with
all flue temerity in the face of
Mr. Hawley's forceful if not logi
cal arguments, that his thoughts
are, rather, harmful, even evil?
YOU SAY that physical force
alone can violate right, Mr. Haw
ley. Ait 1 you physically forced to
pay Income Tax, which you feel
is a denial of your rights? Intel
ligent people have recognized for
over a hundred years now that
. physical force is only the last re
' sort, when all the many other,
more subtle means of denying
rights have failed.
You speak of the "innocent by
stander." Would you call a man
who merely stood by and watched
you being killed, while capable of
j preventing it, innocent? I don't
I think so.
What then of your "residents
and citizens who work for the
I cause of Individualism?" I ehal
j lenge you to show me one person
who works for the right lo !><•

denied any protection or privi
leges provided him by the gov
ernment or society, to rely on
himself alone in the face of op*
presion for that is what your
■ brand of individualism implies Mr.
j Hawley.
I THINK your residents a n d
| citizens are more afraid of being
pushed into a position where they
j have to think for once, where
they have to look beyond the
I warm cocoon of the good life and
i realize the misery existing out
' side that very small area. They
might feel badly then; heavens,
they might even feel a little
guilty.
You say "every man" has th e
right to associate with whom he
pleases. I wasn't aware that the
word every meant white today
Mr. Hawley.
The Negro's rights, to use an
oft quoted phrase, end where
your nose begins as I'm sure
you would agree. But the neces
sary corollary is that your rights
end where his nose begins. When
and only when this is achieved
will it be possible, perhaps, to
think again of your precious "In

with the opportunity to hear and

THE FOUR YEARS of college

great and articulate minds and
of divergent ideas which char
acterize a university, and the rela

ates from the responsibilities of
a full-time job, and of a wife and
family allow for an immeasurably
worthwhile experience of growth,
learning, and self-development, or
a four year continuum of missed
opportunities.
Viewed in the broadest sense,
the purpose of the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee is
to increase the number of these
opportunities made use of, and to
enrich the worth of every stu

acts toward this general aim on

Such a noted conservative as
Russell Kirk has said that to en
joy academic freedom, that is, to
speak freely in iho academy, one
j must be wise and good. Wisdom,
j however defined, implies being in
j some ways aware of the world
around oneself.
Then perhaps it is enough com
i ment on Fred Havvley's letter of
the 29th of April, to say that a
constitutional amendment pro
hibiting poll taxes was passed
two months before Mr. Hawley
sounded the clarion call for their
repeal.
BUT ONE should not reject his
letter for one egregious inaccu
racy. Still there are enough
others. Yet life is too short and
three hundred words too precious
to examine every one. His ex ca
thedra announcement, however,
that 'no man is obliged to live for
another' is worthy of comment
even if rather unoriginal.
In such enlightened places as
great universities, perhaps it is
unwise to quote the Bible in oppo
sition to Ayn Rand.
In Genesis -1:9, God asks Cain
where his brother is? Cain, Iho
original 'innocent bystander.' says
he does not know and anyway, is
he his brother's keeper? Whether
! the conversation took place is
: open to question, but the view it
I expresses is one which Judao-
Christian tradition has ascribed
to for a long time now.
LIKE CAIN, like the Russians
who waited outside Warsaw while
the Germans crushed the Poles
in 1944, like the thirty-odd people,
in Now York, who watched a
woman be attacked three times,
watched her die on their door
step, and then called the police,
Mr. Hawley would like to believe
he is an 'innocent bystander.'
Like them, Mr. Hawley says
even if we hear the bell toll, we
should not ask for whom. A pity,
for it tolls lor him since his phil
osophy of individuality is just
as devoid of humanity as a dead
carcass is.

more subtle means of denying
rights have failed.

you being killed, while capable of

I think so.

watched her die on their door
step, and then called the police,
Mr. Hawley would like to believe
he is an 'innocent bystander.'
Like them, Mr. Hawley says
even if we hear the bell toll, we
should not ask for whom. A pity,
for it tolls lor him since his phil
osophy of individuality is just
as devoid of humanity as a dead
carcass is.

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to express my
sympathy for Mr. Hawley's ex
treme misfortune in being born
in the 20th century. It: is a shame
to see the intellectual talents of
one so obviously suited for the
19th century go to waste in the
| modern world.
Or perhaps wasteful is not the
adjective. Might I suggest, with
all flue temerity in the face of
Mr. Hawley's forceful if not logi
cal arguments, that his thoughts
are, rather, harmful, even evil?
YOU SAY that physical force
alone can violate right, Mr. Haw
ley. Ait 1 you physically forced to
pay Income Tax, which you feel
is a denial of your rights? Intel
ligent people have recognized for
over a hundred years now that
. physical force is only the last re
' sort, when all the many other,
more subtle means of denying
rights have failed.
You speak of the "innocent by
stander." Would you call a man
who merely stood by and watched
you being killed, while capable of
j preventing it, innocent? I don't
I think so.
What then of your "residents
and citizens who work for the
I cause of Individualism?" I ehal
j lenge you to show me one person
who works for the right lo !><•

denied any protection or privi
leges provided him by the gov
ernment or society, to rely on
himself alone in the face of op*
presion for that is what your
■ brand of individualism implies Mr.
j Hawley.
I THINK your residents a n d
| citizens are more afraid of being
pushed into a position where they
j have to think for once, where
they have to look beyond the
I warm cocoon of the good life and
i realize the misery existing out
' side that very small area. They
might feel badly then; heavens,
they might even feel a little
guilty.
You say "every man" has th e
right to associate with whom he
pleases. I wasn't aware that the
word every meant white today
Mr. Hawley.
The Negro's rights, to use an
oft quoted phrase, end where
your nose begins as I'm sure
you would agree. But the neces
sary corollary is that your rights
end where his nose begins. When
and only when this is achieved
will it be possible, perhaps, to
think again of your precious "In
dividualism."

Stanford Today and Tomor
row is a student organized activ
ity — independent of the ASSU
structure -whose programs aim
to create closer and warmer con
tact between students and mem
bers of the faculty and adminis
tration, and to provide students
with the opportunity to hear and
to voice opinions concerning the
future of the University.
THE FOUR YEARS of college
represent a considerable invest
ment: of energies, time, money,
and thought for any undergradu
ate, particularly an undergradu
ate at a private university such
as Stanford. The concentration of
great and articulate minds and
of divergent ideas which char
acterize a university, and the rela
tive freedom of most undergadu
ates from the responsibilities of
a full-time job, and of a wife and
family allow for an immeasurably
worthwhile experience of growth,
learning, and self-development, or
a four year continuum of missed
opportunities.
Viewed in the broadest sense,
the purpose of the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee is
to increase the number of these
opportunities made use of, and to
enrich the worth of every stu
dent's years at Stanford. S.T.&T.
acts toward this general aim on
the supposition that knowledge
of. participation in. and construc
tive and sometimes critical loy
alty to Stanford are essential in
gredients of the most worthwhile
four years experience of Stan
ford.
Programs which S.T.&T. spon
sor vary from President Ster
, ling's Winter Quarter Convoca
tion to a "Majors Program," (to
i be held May 12 and 13 this year)
! designed to better acquaint Fresh
! men with the men, the program,
I and the "quirks" of the various
! academic departments in which
they might be interested in ma
joring.
Tryouts for membership on
; S.T.&T. will be held toda.y and
j tomorrow, April 29th and 30th
from 1:30 to 5:30 at Bowman
Alumni House.
