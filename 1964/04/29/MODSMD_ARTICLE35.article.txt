## Trade With Russia Dangerous 
### DARRYL WOLD 
An article in (he Now Republic,
referred lo last week in this
column and in a letter Monday,
says (1) by not trading with
Russia, we may be passing up an
opportunity to test Khrushchev's
professions of amiability, and <2)
| it is in everyone's interest to give
1 a fair test to the assumption that
a plump Communist will be more
i dovelike.
I therefore though a fair para
; phrase of the article was "We
should step in and befriend (trade
I with) Khrushchev, for that will

[surely make
him a friend of
i Iho West."
When the same
i article says we
: should avoid any
appearance o 1'
ganging up with
Russia against

i China. I am willing to give the
| writer the benefit of any doubt
: of consistency and assume this
doesn't mean we shouldn't trade
'with Khrushchev.
The New Republic seems to en
vision trade both as a profession
i of friendship on our part and as
a pacifier of unfortunate re vol u
i tionary tendencies in Commu
nists. The question immediately
arises, as the article pointed out.
whether this trade woidd have
; the hoped-for effect of easing ten
i sions, and if we should try it to
find out.
★ ★ ★
TIIKKK SEIOMS to be little evi
j dence that any increase in the
material standard of living in
i Russia resulting from trade with
; the West would dampen revolu
i tionary ardor of the type Russia
' now manifests. The search for
food is not, after all, what stimu
lates her interest in Cuba.
There are, moreover, serious
i drawbacks to extensive trade
with Russia, and trade for its
! own sake, with payment to us in
gold or products in return, is of
insufficient value to us to war
rant running these risks of engag
j ing in it. In the first place, 1 h e
items Russia wants to receive
(e.g., wheat) arc of far more
value to her than the standard
payment (gold) is to us. The rela
tive benefit lies in favor of Rus
sia.
Secondly, it should always be
remembered that trade given to
Russia is trade that could have
been given to friendly nations
struggling for economic develop
; ment. Russian oil we take in pay
ment, for instance, is that much
[ less oil we need from Venezuela.
Thirdly, substantial unregulated
'rade with Russia could allow her
to attain a position of importance
in one of our markets where by a
sudden price-cutting or dumping
of a product on the market she
could seriously jeopardize the
i position of private firms in t he
i market, which can't compete with
a total state monopoly, and
threaten the stability of a part
of a free nation's economy. The
threat of this could give Russia
important leverage in bargaining
! for political position vis a vis the
j United States.

ADMITTEDLY, trade with the
Communist bloc could under cer
tain circumstances be used to
our advantage. The character of
our present trade with Russia is
not that of a steady flow of goods
between two countries, but rather,
carefully-negotiated transactions
involving fairly large purchases
of particular items, such as the
recent wheat deal.
It is often evident that the Rus
sians want the particular item
fairly badly, possibly to fill a gap
in their planned economy or to
supply a captive country with,
and when we are sure that the ob
ject of the transaction has not
potential military application, we
could use Communist desire 112 or
the particular transaction as a
bargaining point in attempting
to win a tactical concession in the
Cold War ourselves.
This would not be inconsistent
| with a laissez-faire policy toward
j private trade, for it is a relaxing
jof restrictions on trade, rather
than government control or sub
sidy of private firms. If Russia is
willing to give up something be
sides rubles, il might be worth
| while to us to allow trade of that
I particular item.
But there seems to lie little cvi-
{ dence of such a concept of trade
i on the part of the Administration,
l which still views commerce with
j Communist countries as part of
I a "normalization" of relations, in
an over-all policy of accommoda
tion.

ment, for instance, is that much
[ less oil we need from Venezuela.
Thirdly, substantial unregulated
'rade with Russia could allow her
to attain a position of importance
in one of our markets where by a
sudden price-cutting or dumping
of a product on the market she
could seriously jeopardize the
i position of private firms in t he
i market, which can't compete with
a total state monopoly, and
threaten the stability of a part
of a free nation's economy. The
threat of this could give Russia
important leverage in bargaining
! for political position vis a vis the
j United States.

ADMITTEDLY, trade with the
Communist bloc could under cer
tain circumstances be used to
our advantage. The character of
our present trade with Russia is
not that of a steady flow of goods
between two countries, but rather,
carefully-negotiated transactions
involving fairly large purchases
of particular items, such as the
recent wheat deal.
It is often evident that the Rus
sians want the particular item
fairly badly, possibly to fill a gap
in their planned economy or to
supply a captive country with,
and when we are sure that the ob
ject of the transaction has not
potential military application, we
could use Communist desire 112 or
the particular transaction as a
bargaining point in attempting
to win a tactical concession in the
Cold War ourselves.
This would not be inconsistent
| with a laissez-faire policy toward
j private trade, for it is a relaxing
jof restrictions on trade, rather
than government control or sub
sidy of private firms. If Russia is
willing to give up something be
sides rubles, il might be worth
| while to us to allow trade of that
I particular item.
But there seems to lie little cvi-
{ dence of such a concept of trade
i on the part of the Administration,
l which still views commerce with
j Communist countries as part of
I a "normalization" of relations, in
an over-all policy of accommoda
tion.
