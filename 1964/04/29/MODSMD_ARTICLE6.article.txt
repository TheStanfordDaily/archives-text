# Yanofsky Cited For Research
## 
### 
WASHINGTON -Prof. Charles
Yanosfsky. a Stanford biologist,
has been selected for one of the
highest honors in his field, the
i $5000 Award in Molecular Biology
I presented annually by th e Na
i tional Academy of Sciences.
He received Ihe 196-1 award and
scroll at ceremonies here Mon
day during the Academy's 101st
annual meeting. The award is
sponsored by the United States
j Steel Foundation.
Yanofsky was cited by the Acad
emy's selection committee for his
distinguished research in mole
cular biology, particularly in fur
thering the study of the genetic
cole by relating mutational events
with a mino acid sequences in
! proteins.
Working with a bacterium
j called Escherichia coli, he used
j radiation to produce mutations or
changes in genes of the organ
; ism.
i The discoveries of Yanofsky
J and others have revealed many
i hitherto unknown relationships
between genes and enzymes which
| may someday enable man to di
! red and control growth itself.
