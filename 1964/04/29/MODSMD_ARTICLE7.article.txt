### BARBARA SCHNUR 
"The statesmen of the West had the luxury of time."
In these words Gabriel Almond, director of Stanford's Institute
for Political Studies, stressed the difference between democratiza
tion in the West and the process going on in the new and mod
ernizing nations of Asia, Africa and Latin America.

Failure to realize "how recent*
and how partial was democratiza
tion in the West" has led to un
founded pessimism about (he
prospects for democratic govern
ment in the new nations, Almond
stated in last night's Tuesday
Evening Series presentation.
"NAIVE HOPE and impulses
toward panic commingle in most
of us and confuse our foreign
policy makers." Almond said.
This ambivalence has led to two
extreme approaches to the prob
lem based upon various myths.
These "tough" and "tender" ap
proaches are both erroneous.
Those who take the "tender"
approach are likely to be disap
pointed when faced with the real-j
ity that the democracy which took '
centuries of "groping and trial
and error to develop in the West"
cannot be easily transplanted in

t
the new nations, according to Al
mond.
On the other hand, the "tough"
approach is just as erroneous in
considering the new nations
ready for nothing more than en
forced stability under militaristic
regimes. Almond considers I lie
"tough" approach based upon the
myth that "stable" military re
gimes are truly permanent in na
ture.
A REALISTIC approach to
the problem of democracy in the
new nations lias to be founded
upon an awareness of the prob
lems native leaders face.
Almond stated that the develop
' menl of participation and welfare
j will be largely a result of broad
j modernizing processes like educa
tion. industrialization, urbaniza
tion, and the emancipation of
women.
