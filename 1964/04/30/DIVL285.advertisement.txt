HOW TO MEET GOD
Religion is for the birds. Don't bother to search through religions if you are
looking for God. Religions are man-made towers of Babel reaching skyward,
but not heavenward—man s attempts to reach Cod.
Christianity is something quite different. The Christian message is that God
has come down to man and meets man on God's terms. A great chasm sep
arates a holy and just God from sinful man. But God Himself bridged this gulf
by taking the form of man 2000 years ago in the Person of Jesus Christ. When
Christ died on the cross, He paid the penalty for all our sins, and as a result,
IF WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE CHRIST AS LORD AND SAVIOUR, WE CAN BE
RECONCILED TO GOD.
But many people will not accept God s marvelous free gift of salvation.
This is because man is filled with pride and desires to exalt himself. In order
to become a Christian, man must submit to the Lordship of Christ and "honor
the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth
not the Father." John 5:23.
God does not require that we be all cleaned up on the outside, but says
that IF THOU SHALT CONFESS WITH THY MOUTH THE LORD JESUS, AND SHALT
BELIEVE IN THINE HEART THAT GOD HATH RAISED HIM FROM THF. DEAD,
THOU SHALT BE SAVED." Romans 10:9.
The problem is not with God, it is with you. God alone give salvation. Why
not meet Him today?

HOW TO MEET GOD
Religion is for the birds. Don't bother to search through religions if you are
looking for God. Religions are man-made towers of Babel reaching skyward,
but not heavenward—man s attempts to reach Cod.
Christianity is something quite different. The Christian message is that God
has come down to man and meets man on God's terms. A great chasm sep
arates a holy and just God from sinful man. But God Himself bridged this gulf
by taking the form of man 2000 years ago in the Person of Jesus Christ. When
Christ died on the cross, He paid the penalty for all our sins, and as a result,
IF WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE CHRIST AS LORD AND SAVIOUR, WE CAN BE
RECONCILED TO GOD.
But many people will not accept God s marvelous free gift of salvation.
This is because man is filled with pride and desires to exalt himself. In order
to become a Christian, man must submit to the Lordship of Christ and "honor
the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth
not the Father." John 5:23.
God does not require that we be all cleaned up on the outside, but says
that IF THOU SHALT CONFESS WITH THY MOUTH THE LORD JESUS, AND SHALT
BELIEVE IN THINE HEART THAT GOD HATH RAISED HIM FROM THF. DEAD,
THOU SHALT BE SAVED." Romans 10:9.
The problem is not with God, it is with you. God alone give salvation. Why
not meet Him today?
