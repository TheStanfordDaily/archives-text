# V.P. Candidates Differ On Duties
## 
### HILDA KOSOFF 
What duties are appropriate
for the ASSU Vice President?
Steve Fosset and Mary Ann
Odegaard, the two candidates for
the office, differ basically on this
point. According to Fossett, the
VP should use his initiative to
promote special programs of in
terest to the student body, besides
taking over in the absence of the
President and organizing the so
cial calendar.
ODECAAKI), on the other hand,
holds that constitutional duties,
particularly the social program,
should take up the primary at
tention of the officer. In this area,
"the Vice President is ultimately
responsible for what happens,"
she said. "You can't just appoint
a committee and expect things to
get done." Any extra energy
should be devoted to a thorough
study of the powers of the posi
tion a study she feels would be
best conducted from the inside.
One idea which Fossetl would
work on if elected is an extended
program of low-interest loans to
students, particularly those whose
parents are "technically able" to
pay their tuition but refuse. The
difference between the 5 percent
interest charged by the bank and
the rate offered students would
be made up by subscriptions from
the Alumni Association.
These loans would, Fossett be
lieves. make it possible for many
to come to Stanford who would
otherwise be unable. "This uni
versity ought to be for the best
who apply, bar none." be said.
BOTH CANDIDATES believe
that the ASSU social calendar
should include big-name enter
tainers, who are too expensive
for smaller groups to sponsor.
Now that Frost has been fenced
off, Odcgaard points, out, the
University has a theatre large
enough to make such engage
ments pay.
Odcgaard, a junior, is a director
of Axe Comm. which she has
been active in for two years. She
has helped organize the Con
Home Hydrofollies, and worked
in their fund drive. She has also
been social chairman of her house
three times.
Fossett is a transfer student
from Cal, where he was active
in student, government.
Both are concerned about the
election, and feel that the Vice
President has great potential for
improvement.

best conducted from the inside.
One idea which Fossetl would
work on if elected is an extended
program of low-interest loans to
students, particularly those whose
parents are "technically able" to
pay their tuition but refuse. The
difference between the 5 percent
interest charged by the bank and
the rate offered students would
be made up by subscriptions from
the Alumni Association.
These loans would, Fossett be
lieves. make it possible for many
to come to Stanford who would
otherwise be unable. "This uni
versity ought to be for the best
who apply, bar none." be said.
BOTH CANDIDATES believe
that the ASSU social calendar
should include big-name enter
tainers, who are too expensive
for smaller groups to sponsor.
Now that Frost has been fenced
off, Odcgaard points, out, the
University has a theatre large
enough to make such engage
ments pay.
Odcgaard, a junior, is a director
of Axe Comm. which she has
been active in for two years. She
has helped organize the Con
Home Hydrofollies, and worked
in their fund drive. She has also
been social chairman of her house
three times.
Fossett is a transfer student
from Cal, where he was active
in student, government.
Both are concerned about the
election, and feel that the Vice
President has great potential for
improvement.
