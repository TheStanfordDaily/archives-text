# NEW FEDERAL AGENCY
## Humanities Foundation Proposed 
### 
CHICAGO (CPS) - A report
recommending Hie establishment
of an independent National Hu
manities Foundation (NHF), simi
lar to the Nat ional Science
Foundation (NSF>, will be issued
next month by the Commission on
the Humanities.
The mission of the proposed hu
manities foundation would be
broad — including support of "so
cial sciences not supported by the
NSF," scholarly research and "cre
ative arts" projects, teacher insti
tutes, student fellowships, and the
construction of needed facilities in
relevant areas.
The Commission on the Human
ities is composed of twenty distin
guished educators and humanists

and the chairman of IBM. It is
sponsored by the American Coun
cil of Learned Societies, the Coun
cil of Graduate Schools in the U.S.,
and the United Chapters of Phi
Beta Kappa.
The forthcoming report, which
is still in the draft stage, was out
lined at a session of the National
Conference of the Association of
Higher Education Tuesday (April
21 » by Charles Blitzer, the Com
mission's staff director.
The immediate goal of the
Foundation's supporters is the rec
ognition of the principle that there
should be a federal agency sup
porting the humanities for their
own sake rather than for any con
tributions their study might make

to national defense or any other
particular concern of the federal
government.
Opposition among Commission
members to the proposed founda
tion centered in a fear of federal
control or limitations on sponsored
research, particularly in "sensi
' ive" areas or in fields not related
to the nation's defense.
Congressional opposition is anti
cipated to the Commission's basic
conclusion that the federal gov
ernment should provide support
for the humanities because the
health of the humanities at all
levels in an issue of national con
cern. The "hard cases" put forth
i by Blitzer were justifying federal
I support for folklore and church
music, two fields studied by hu
| manists.
The proposed NHF, like the gov
| ernment-run Smithsonian Insti
tute, would be authorized and ex
j peeted to receive private dona
tions, according to Blitzer, One
j purpose of such donations would
be to enable the Foundation to
' use its own, rather than federal
funds to support extremely con
troversial or sensitive projects
that might otherwise arouse the
ire of congressional critics.
