# Lowenstein To Arrive Here Today
## All-Campus Speech Planned 
### 
Author, professor, lawyer, and
civil rights leader Allard K. Low
enstein arrives on campus today
for a three-day stay.
Lovvenstein, who served as Ad
visory Committee chairman for
the "Aaron Henry for Governor"
mock election in Mississippi last
November, will meet in Tresidder
Room 275 tonight at 7:30 with all
Stanford students who plan to
work in Mississippi this summer.
TIIK MKKTING is open only to
those students who will be taking
part in the project, and is the first
of their orientation and training
sessions which will be concluded
at the National Council of
Churches Pro.j e c t Mississippi
Training Center in Berea, K e n
tucky June 15-19.
Lowenstein will make an ad
dress open to the campus on "Tac
tics and Trends in Civil Rights
North and South" tomorrow
afternoon at 1:15 in the large
lounge of Tresidder. His speech
is sponsored by the Civil Rights
Secretariat.
Lowenstein's activity in Civil
Rights has been both as a policy
maker and as a lawyer. His close
involvement in Mississippi and in
North Carolina, where he is cur
rently Professor of Political
Science at North Carolina State
College, as well as his deep fa
miliarity with movements in the
North, lends him a perspective
upon trends of "militancy and less
non-violence" as well as tactics
such as "stall-ins" and "lie-ins"
that differ from that held by sev
eral of Stanford's guests at the
All Western States Civil Rights
Conference last week.
Lowenstein is a person not
only in direct contact with major
civil rights leaders which enables
him to see the policies behind the
trends, but he is also a person
with a lengthy background of
high level political and academic
involvement which enables him
to analyze these trends.
Lowenstein will be open to ques
tions at the close of his speech
tomorrow, including those dealing
with the Aaron Henry campaign,
and Project Mississippi, as well as
current civil rights demons! ra
t ions.
