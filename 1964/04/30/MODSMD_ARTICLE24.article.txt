# USC Trackmen Dominate AAWU Track Standings
## 
### 
Very little has changed in the]
world of AAWU track statistics
in the past week. Only two
changes were made among th e
leading performers in the various
events, and both involved Les
Mills, the former Olympic team
captain from New Zealand now
competing for USC.
Mills had been the leading dis
cus thrower in the league with a
179-4 effort prior to Saturday's
action. He came oul of that action
in second place both for the after
noon and the year in his specialty, i
DON SCHMIDT, the big Cal
weightman who poses such a
threat to Stanford in the Big Meet
this weekend, beat Mills with a
lifetime best throw of 180-10, good
enough to become the leading
twirier in the conference.
But Mills made up for his de

feat in the discus by flinging the I
shotput r>B feet 5 inches to wrest |
the lead in that event from hisj
teammate Don Castle, whose .iS-3 j
throw had been the previous best.
Stanford has pretty good repre
sentation in the top echelons of
these two events, although its per
formers don't nearly match the
men mentioned above.
Steve Arch and Jack Chappie,
the football guard turned shot
putter who will turn back into a
guard or linebacker on Monday,
are fourth and fifth best men
among the league's shotputters
with 55-4 and 55-3 efforts.
IN THIO DISC, the Tribe can
not number one of its men in the
top five, although Bob Stoecker
ranks only inches below Cal's
Randy Schneider and his fifth
place 106-6 throw.
Stanford's only league leaders
are its co-captain, Steve Cortright,
and Paul Schlicke. Cort right's
times in the high hurdles and the
intermediates are the best in the
Big Six (or Great Eight or PCC or
whatever name the athletic direc
tors decide to give it later t his
month).
His 14.3 in the highs ties him
with USC's Then Viltz, to whom
he lost three weeks ago by a hair,
and his 37.2 in the intermediates
fully three tenths of a second
better than Viltz' second place
time.
Schlicke and Bill Pratt are the
next best Stanford performers.
Schlicke's 8:56.6 is the best in the
conference in the two mile and
his 4:02.3 mile, third best in the
nation, is second best in the con
ference.
PRATT'S 1:50.8 in the 880 puts
him second to SC's Bruce Bess in
the league, and is one of the top
seven in the country. Bob Miltz
is only a tenth of a second back,
tied with Trojan Chris Johnson
for third at 1:50.9.
Stanford's big weaknesses ap
pear to be in the sprints, where
there are no Indians in the top
eight men in the hundred and
only one, Ken Fraser, the fifth
man, in the top five in the 220.
So far, in conference dual meet
competition, USC is undefeated.
The won-lost record means
nothing, since the final six-team
meet determines the champion.
Here are the standings, anyway:
