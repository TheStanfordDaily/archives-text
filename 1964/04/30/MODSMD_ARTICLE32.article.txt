# SOCIALISTS SPEAK
## American Myth Exposed 
### EDWARD APPLEBAUM Member Socialist Caucus 
.lust as the American public
w;is considering the meaning of
Fulbright's speech on the myths
and realities of American foreign
policy, it was treated to a classic
example of that very thing: 1 he
leftist government of Joao Gou
lart was overthrown, democracy
triumphed, and the Brazilian con
stitution was preserved.
There are several problems
dealing with the official U.S. posi
tion: the government of Goulart
was. in fact, consistently conser
vative in its makeup and concilia
tory to the right wing in its do
mestic policies; democracy had
been made a shambles of while
the constitution had been de
stroyed by the coup, to the extent
that a military man became presi
dent. which the Brazilian consti
tution specifically forbids.
In a country where six million
children under 16 years of age die
annually, and 70-85 per cent of
the voters are disfranchised, Gou
lart had attempted to take some
long-delayed action in the realm
of public welfare.

AFTER THE COUP, anyone
who had supported agrarian re- j
form, urban rent control, govern-1
ment control of oil industries, in
creased voting rights or expand
ing trade with socialist countries
was subject to arrest as a com- 1
munist. In other words, by enact-1
ing the provisions of the Alliance j
for Progress, Goulart was "mov-1
ing into the communist camp." !
Goulart's biggest problem seems ;
to have been that he was too con
ciliatory to the right and too hesi
tant in enacting reforms. But. it
must be noted, he did challenge
the U.S. in two vital areas, and
like two of his predecessors. Var
gas and Quadros, he was quickly
deposed after so doing (Vargas
committed suicide, blaming his
failures on foreign intervention).
Goulart was one of the five
OAS leaders who refused to sane-!
tion U.S. policy towards Cuba: the !
new government has withdrawn j
recognition from Cuba.
And, under Goulart, Brazil was !
one of the leaders from the "have j
not" nations of the world at the j
Geneva World Trade Conference, ]
demanding U.S. guarantees of |
stablization of raw materials' j
prices, especially coffee: the new :
government has promised greater 1
cooperation with U.S. business in-1
terests.

TIIE NEW VORK Times has
termed the U.S. government's!
position on the Brazilian coup
"pure Alice in Wonderland stuff," j
and rightly so. The numerous j
warnings of Goulart and his min- I
isters were not even printed in !
the American press, but they j
were constantly stating their posi- j
tions, and nothing in their actions
could possibly warrant being
labeled "communist."
There already were two com
munists in the Brazilian govern
ment. and Goulart sought to legal
ize the party as a balance against
the growing threat of the fascis
tic right. However, the new gov
ernment has imprisoned no less
than forty congressmen.
The myth of the situation is
that the good guys have won
again, and that everything will be
OK now. The reality is that the
entire continent is stirring, and
only through an upheaval which
completely revises the social and
economic basis of Latin American
governments, will the people
themselves be brought out of
their medieval existences.

AFTER THE COUP, anyone

ment control of oil industries, in
creased voting rights or expand
ing trade with socialist countries
was subject to arrest as a com- 1
munist. In other words, by enact-1

Goulart's biggest problem seems ;
to have been that he was too con
ciliatory to the right and too hesi
tant in enacting reforms. But. it
must be noted, he did challenge
the U.S. in two vital areas, and
like two of his predecessors. Var
gas and Quadros, he was quickly
deposed after so doing (Vargas
committed suicide, blaming his
failures on foreign intervention).
Goulart was one of the five
OAS leaders who refused to sane-!
tion U.S. policy towards Cuba: the !
new government has withdrawn j
recognition from Cuba.
And, under Goulart, Brazil was !
one of the leaders from the "have j

"pure Alice in Wonderland stuff," j

warnings of Goulart and his min- I
isters were not even printed in !
the American press, but they j
were constantly stating their posi- j
tions, and nothing in their actions
could possibly warrant being

There already were two com

the growing threat of the fascis

The myth of the situation is
that the good guys have won
again, and that everything will be
