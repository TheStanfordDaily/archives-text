## Bystanders Not Innocent 
### 
iMlitor, The Daily:
In his letter of April 28, Fred
Hawley states that "no man is
obliged to live for the sake of an
other." In other words, we are to
do away with friendship, love,
mercy, and all the acts of human
kindness which make man more
than an animal. If all men de
cided to live only for their own
sakes, there would be no human
society, and eventually no human
life.
Mr. Hawley takes this state
ment as given and derives from
it the contention that "a bystand
er lo any act of violence is inno
cent." Mr. Hawley, if someone
threatened to shoot your mother,
and you could prevent it, but did
nothing, would you be innocent?
A bystander to an act of vio

lenee is innocent only when there
is nothing he can do lo prevent it.
The problem of racial discrimi
nation can be solved, therefore
those who do nothing to solve it
share in the guilt.
Mr. Hawley contends that ac
tion to end discrimination is a vio
! latlon of individual rights. We all
have an inalienable light to life
and liberty. That liberty, how
ever. includes neither the liberty
to take away another's life not
! the liberty to take away another's
j liberty.
Those who discriminate are
1 taking away the liberty of the
| Negro, and those who attempt to
'end discrimination are attempting
|to end this unjust removal of
rights.
