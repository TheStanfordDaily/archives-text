## Fair Housing Laws Allow Free Access To Markets 
### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing 1 article is written by four
Stanford law professors:
Charles Meyers, Gerald G u n
tlier, Joseph Sneetl, and Howard
Williams. Two of the writers
are Democrats and two Repub
licans and all lour "are strongly
opposed to the housing amend
ment and urge all citizens to
vote against it."
Before the extremists on both
sides of the civil rights debate
take over, we would like to bring
to the attention of open-minded
citizens some considerations bear
ing on the proposed housing
amendment to the state constitu
tion.
1. The amendment is not a ref
erendum and would not, in fact,
repeal all of the Rumford Act. It
would nullify parts of that Act,
and would also do much more.
In particular, it would nullify the
Unruh Act of 19.09 as applied to
the sale of tract houses by real
'estate developers and to th e
rental of apartments by land
lords.
This five-year-old law prohibits
racial discrimination "in all busi
ness establishments of every kind
whatsoever." Tract developers tin
the business of selling lots and
houses) and landlords (in the
business of renting apartments)
are covered by the Unruh Act —
and would be excluded if the pro
posed amendment passes.
We can see no justification for
exempting two kinds of busi
nesses from the Unruh Act while
all other business establishments
remain subject to it. If it is sound
policy, as we think it is, to forbid
racial discrimination by drug
stores, hotels, movie theatres, res
taurants, real estate brokers,
mortgage lenders and every other
business establishment, it is sound
policy to forbid racial discrimina
tion by tract developers and land
lords. The amendment should be
voted down, if for no other rea
son, because it seeks to write into
the constitution a special privilege

for two kinds of business estab
lishments.
THE INITIATORS of the
amendment are less than candid:
they style the amendment as one
protecting individual property
rights; in fact the amendment
will have no effect on owners of
single- family homes without gov
ernment insured mortgages, in
fact the principal effect of the
amendment is to grant special
privileges to real estate operators
and landlords.
2. It is, of course, true that the
amendment would also nullify
parts of the Rum ford Art. This
statute prohibits racial discrimi
nation in the sale or rental of pub
licly assisted housing (except for
duplexes )and of other housing
containing five units or more. In
the main, publicly assisted hous
ing is housing with a government
insured mortgage or other loan.
The Rumford Act docs not touch
privately financed housing except
for apartment buildings with 5
or more units.

AS TO HOUSING that is cov
ered. the Rumford Act does not
require the owner to sell or rent
I to Negroes. II an owner does not
wish to rent to tenants with chil
dren or dogs, or if any prospec
tive tenant fails to meet the own
i er's standards of cleanliness, fi
| nancial responsibility or m o ra 1
character, the owner is free to
'refuse to deal with the applicant,
be he Negro or white. The law
merely insists that any require
ments the owner imposes be ap
i plied equally to Negroes a n d :
j whites.
3. We believe that fair housing I
; laws regulate property for the
purpose of maximizing freedom
of choice and equality of oppor- j
1 tunity. We disagree with the initi
ators' contention that such laws!
i curtail freedom and destroy prop-
I erty right.
Regulation of indivdual conduct
i to increase freedom for all in
| dividuals is a well established,
nart of American tradition. And

regulation for that purpose is con
sistont with our constitutional re
quirements as well as our his
torical heritage, for the Constitu
tion has always permitted reason
able exercise of the police power.
Since 1890, for example, the
Sherman Act has forbidden com
binations to suppress competition
and fix prices. For centuries the
common law has denied a land
owner the power to forbid the
sale of property he transfers to
another. These and many other
desirable regulations prevent one
person from denying access to the
market by others.
★ * ★
IN OUR OPINION, the R u m
ford and Unruh Acts are in this
tradition. They move in the direc
tion of permitting every family to
acquire the kind of housing it can
afford. By thus granting access
to the market, these laws promote
the goal of equality of opportun
ity. The Rumford and Unruh Acts
therefore deserve the support of
all citizens who believe in the
free market system.
4. The fear has been expressed
that the enforcement of the Rum
lord Act by ;i state agency will
oppress the individual. We believe
these fears are unfounded.
The procedure to be followed
in a case of alleged violation of
the Act is. in essence, this: An ag
grieved person files a sworn com
plaint, which is investigated by
the State Fair Employment Prac
tices Commission. If the investi
gation shows that probable cause
does not exist for believing a vio
j lation occurred, the complaint is
j dismissed and the matter ended.
If probable cause does exist, an
j official will contact the property
owner privately and seek to elimi
nate the discrimination.
If these efforts at conciliation
! fail, the matter goes for the first
time to a public hearing. From
that point on, it is handled like
any malt or before an administra
tive agency. There is, of course,
1 the right to judicial review.
5. FEAR HAS also been ex
pressed that the Rumford Ac t
will lead to a quota system 112 or
allocating goods and sendees to
Negroes or other ethnic groups.
This fear is also unfounded if the
Act is properly interpreted and
! administered.
The Act declares it to be against
' public policy to discriminate in
the sale or leasing of certain hous
1 ing accommodations on the basis
of race, color, religion, national
! origin, or ancestry. The Act con-
I templates that upon proof of such
discrimination the property will
be sold or rented to the agrrieved
person who applied for it, if it is
still available.
If not, a like accommodation is
; to be offered, if available. If not.
i the next vacancy in a like ac
■ commodation is to be offered. Fin
| ally, if none of these remedies is
, available, damages in an amount
i not to exceed $500 must be paid
: to the aggrieved person.

PROPERLY construed, the
principle is plain: first come, first
served, if all other things are
equal. Clearly, this principle
countenances neither the total ex
; elusion of a racial group nor its
I limited inclusion to achieve a
| proper racial balance.
Thus, we believe that if the
I owner of an apartment building
with 100 units has a waiting list,
I he would be in full compliance
! with the law if he added each
1 qualified applicant, white or Ne
j gro, to the list and offered each
vacant apartment to the first per
son on the list.
We recognize, however, that the
principle of the Rumford Act.
applied as we have indicated, may
not solve all the ethnic problems
in housing. It does not, for ex
ample, eliminate the possibility
! of a flight of white home owners
or tenants following occupancy
by several Negro families.
But it does make such flight
less probable because of its state
wide application. In essence, how
ever, the Act proceeds on the as
sumption that the people of Cali
fornia are prepared to live in ac
cordance with the policy of non
discrimination.
In this sense the Rumford Act
is an expression of faith in t he
tolerance of the people of this
state. Its partial nullification by
passage of the amendment or its
distortion in the course of admin
istration will signify that this
faith was misplaced.
The regulations of property in
the fair housing laws are reason
able regulations designed to
achieve an important jzoal of
American society: freedom of ac
cess to the market of goods and
services. And that freedom is
basic to the larger goal of equal
ity of opportunity for all.
