## Student Criticism Of China Smuggled To Free World 
### 
| "Facing the enemy, my eyes are :
red with anger and I would risk j
losing my head and shedding my ,
blood; but facing the dictatorship
of the Communist Party I am
: cowardly and powerless. How
small and pitiful is one individual!
Party, you are now betraying our
nation and the innate goodness
of our young people; you havcj
i smashed the peace. This is how I
! feel about you from the bottom
j of my heart."
This quote is taken from a
pamphlet smuggled into Ii ong
Kong in li)(>2 by a Chinese student
who fled from the mainland. It
is believed that only one copy of
this pamphlet exists in the Free
World.
CONTAINING SOME of the
most outspoken criticism of life
I in Communist China ever to reach
I the West, the pamphlet is now
available in English translation;
from The Hoover Institution un
der the title "Communist China:
The Politics of Student Opposi-1
tion" (70 pp., $1.50). The transla
tion is by Assistant Prof. Dennis
J. Doolin of the Stanford Depart
ment of Political Science, who j
also supplied a substantial intro
duction and annotations.
The occasion for these student j
■essays was a decision by the Chi-1

nese Communist Party to permit
freedom of expression for a brief
period in 1957. The so-called
"Hundred Flowers" movement
"let a hundred flowers bloom, let
a hundred schools of thought con
lend"—attempted to solidify the
intellectual support of the Com
munist regime — • particularly
among the future leaders, the stu
dents.
Chairman Mao Tse-tung ap
parently believed that the griev
ances of non-Communists could be
aired without damaging the re
gime's popularity. Instead, intel
lectuals from all over China came
forward with bitter and impas
sioned complaints.
THIS CONTINUED through
May and early June of 1957, dur
ing which time the Party was
stunned by the volume and tenor
of criticism. The campaign was
halted, the dissidents were pun
ished, and the "'Hundred Flow
ers.' " one Communist official de
clared, were plowed under to be
used as fertilizer."
The student criticisms contained
in the new Hoover Institution
pamphlet transcend the level of
mere polemic, Prof. Doolin notes.
Politically, these young Chinese
men and women can be seen as
dedicated Communists, yet their
intelligence and sense of justice
were revolted by what they saw of
Communism in mainland China.
The students drew a distinction
between "the abstract, infallible
Communist Party; and the real
Communist Party, with real men
and in a definite place in time."
ONE WRITER c o nclud ed,
"There are only two ways out for
our people: either obey the rob
ber . . . or snatch the knife from
the robber and live like men." It
is little wonder that the Commu
nist Party felt threatened and
summarily terminated the "Hun
dred Flowers" campaign.
As the Si no-Soviet dispute wors
ens, political theory may yet take
a back seat to the economics of
survival. But whether the myopia
induced by Marxist-Maoist "len
ses" can be corrected still remains
to be seen, he concludes.
EDITOR'S NOTE: If is a Uni
versity policy that members of
the University News Service
be referred io not by their
names but only as "University
spokesmen."
