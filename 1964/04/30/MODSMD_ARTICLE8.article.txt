# KZSU To Review Frank Morse Case
## 
### 
KZSU will present, the second
part of "9830," an analysis of the
Morse Case, tonight at 8:30. In
the form of an editorial com
mentary, the program will begin
by an updating of the first part
of "0830."
Other relevant considerations
will then be covered, including
the first incident involv ing Morse,
Dr. Frulla's performance in past
disciplinary cases with other
groups, and the recurring "end
quarter" problem 011 the Floren
tine campus. The program will
conclude with a viewpoint of the
fairness of the decision and spec
ulation on why it was made and
upheld.
"9830" Part I will be rerun pro
ceeding Part 2 at B=o.l p.m. A
station spokesman indicated that
although reaction to the program
by certain administrative offices
has been strong and explicit, no
facts presented in the case have
proven to be in error.
