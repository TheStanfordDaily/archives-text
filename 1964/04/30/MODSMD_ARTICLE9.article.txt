# ASSU Campaigns Underway; Candidates Speak To Groups
## More Student Interest Wanted 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
Presidential candidates Jo h n
Bryson and Soot I Mcßride opened
their campaigns for the May 6-7
ASSU primary election last night,
with informal talks on campus.
Mcßride, speaking at Eucalyp
to, told his audience that one of
the major faults of student gov
ernment at Stanford is a lack of
student interest. "One way this
can be corrected is by presenting
some constructive student ideas
in areas of direct student involve
ment and concern," he said.
BKYSON »ISCL T KSKI> some
points in his platform with a
group of students in Bowman
Alumni House. He generally ad
vocated "a wider base of student
participation and a broadened
view of the role of student gov
ernment."
Mcßride stressed "experimen
tation" in student government,
presenting several ideas, princi
pally concerned with increased
student, faculty and administra
tion communication. "Maybe
some of these things won't work,"
he said, "but I think that they
have to be tried."
Some of the proposals that he
presented included an open forum
of student officers, administra
tors and faculty members to im
prove communication between
these groups, a hostel during fall
quarter for ASSU officers and
University officials to discuss
general goals and ideas of each,
and a committee of student, fac
ulty, and administration which
would act as a type of "continu
ing scratch sheet." which could
make recommendations in areas
of academic concern.
BKYSON COVERED a wide
range of student activities in his
discussion including a student bill
of rights amendment to the ASSU
Constitution. It would guarantee
due process, establish a "Court of
Last Appeals" with student and
faculty members, and establish
other guarantees similar to those
requested by the Legislature in
its last meeting.
He also called for consideration
of a liberalized meal exchange
program, possible initiation of a
student exchange program with
Negro universities.
One method of increasing inter
est in student government, hesug

gested was an intern program in
which students could participate
in a number of the organizations
in the ASSU. Bryson also sug
gested the election of three of the
six NSA delegates in order to
make the lelogatcs more repre
sentative, and to generate more
interest in the NSA and issues
with which it is concerned.
THE ItOLK of LASSU was one
area of difference between th e
two candidates. Mcßride felt that
the Legislature should concern
itself with only matters of direct
student concern, using the debate
in (he Legislature of March .3 on
the SLAC powcrlines as an ex
ample of wasted time and effort
in student government.
