THE TROUBLE WITH SPORTS SHIRTS IS
WHEN YOU WEAR AN ORDINARY TIE WITH ONE
YOU LOOK LIKE A GANGSTER
HOWEVER there are times that are a little too dressy for an unadorned throat (as when you're
wearing a blazer), and for these the Ascot is finding increasing favor. Women apparently find
them madly attractive, and men like their go-to-hell feel once they get around to wearing them. The
trick seems to be in tying them; actually, there is nothing to it. All you do is slip the Ascot around
your neck, inside the collar, and loop one end over the other below your adam's apple; and loop it
twice so it won't slip down your chest after awhile. ★ It just so happens that, foreseeing this demand,
we have gone into the Ascot game. You will tind a nice selection at your Eagle Ascot store, which
is the same store where you buy Eagle Shirts. ★ Not to change the subject, but this magnificent
short-sleeve sports shirt at about $9.00 which we have portrayed here is an exclusive Eagle pattern
in two-ply cotton oxford, and conies in blue, green, or burgundy stripes alternating with skinnier
black ones on an Eagle's Cream ground. * We also have a magnificent matching check; let's see if
we can describe it: it's something as though we ran transverse stripes in the same colors across this
pattern. No, that's a terrible description, you'd better go take a look for yourself. If you don't
know where that would be, drop a line to Miss Afflerbach and she U write right back with the news.
