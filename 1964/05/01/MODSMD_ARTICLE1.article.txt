• Soviets Seek Concessions
WASHINGTON — U.S. officials are in
trigued by evidence thai the Soviet Union now
would like this country to give her a hand in
Moscow's struggle with Red China.
This seems to be what the Russians are
aiming at with their lecture to the American
press yesterday about printing Red Chinese
charges against Soviet communism.
Beneath the surface, however, the Soviets
actually appear to be trying to use their dis
pute with the Red Chinese in an effort to
wring concessions from the United States in
fields of disarmament, nuclear arms for
NATO, or the future of Germany and Berlin.
• The fact that the Soviet would suggest a
greater community of interest with the United
States than with the Red Chinese is an indica
tion of how far Premier Khrushchev and his
advisers think the situation has gone.
Provda published an article yesterday criti
cizing U.S. newspapers for printing what the
paper called "rude, gross, anti-Soviet inven

tion" of the Chinese. It said one effect is to
perpetuate the "myth about the aggressive na
ture of the Soviet."
The Pravda article implied that the U.S.

• Soviets Seek Concessions
WASHINGTON — U.S. officials are in
trigued by evidence thai the Soviet Union now
would like this country to give her a hand in
Moscow's struggle with Red China.
This seems to be what the Russians are
aiming at with their lecture to the American
press yesterday about printing Red Chinese
charges against Soviet communism.
Beneath the surface, however, the Soviets
actually appear to be trying to use their dis
pute with the Red Chinese in an effort to
wring concessions from the United States in
fields of disarmament, nuclear arms for
NATO, or the future of Germany and Berlin.
• The fact that the Soviet would suggest a
greater community of interest with the United
States than with the Red Chinese is an indica

advisers think the situation has gone.
Provda published an article yesterday criti

paper called "rude, gross, anti-Soviet inven

perpetuate the "myth about the aggressive na
