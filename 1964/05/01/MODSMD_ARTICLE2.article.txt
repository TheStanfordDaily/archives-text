# Candidates Differ On Secretariat
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
ASSU Presidential candidate
Scott Mcßride charged last night
that the Civil Rights Secretariat
was "inappropriately established."
Mcßride, speaking in a debate
with John Bryson, another can
didate for the office, said that
appropriate voluntary organiza
tions exist for off-campus issues
without involving the ASSU.
Bryson maintained that there
was enough student interest in
the civil rights program to justify
making it a permanent, indepen
dent body within student govern
ment.
Bryson had advocated several
programs such as tutorial work
in East Palo Alto and student ex
change programs with Negro
universities. "The Civil Rights
Secretariat could be the organ
through which these programs
woulci be implemented."
The role of LASSU was also an
area of sharp difference between
the two candidates. Mcßride said,
"I don't think that the Legislature
should spend its time of proposals
that can't result i?i direct action."
Bryson agreed that it was
"fruitless" for LASSU to discuss
the powerlines. However, he
added, "In certain areas the stu
dents can't legislate, but can only
make proposals to the Adminis
tration."
Both candidates also discussed
the Frank Morse case which has
aroused considerable student in
terest in judicial processes at tho
University. Bryson has suggested
certain amendments to the ASSU
Constitution to insure student due
process a' establishing a Court
of Last Appeals with student and
faculty members.
Mcßride feels that more inves
tigation of the actual facts is
needed. He also advocates the cre
ation of a board of faculty and
student members of the judicial
council to which appeals from the
student judicial council would be
made.
Steve Fossett, a candidate for
ASSU vice-president, withdrew
from the race yesterday. He
stated in withdrawing from the
race, "I cannot afford the time
necessary to organize a competi
tive campaign and I believe Mary
Ann Odegard would be competent
in the office."
