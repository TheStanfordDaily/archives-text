# Batsmen's Job: Stop Losing Streak, Sweep Cal Series
## 
### PETE EAKLAND 
The Stanford baseball squad,
which this week fell below 1 h e
.500 mark while extending its los
ing streak to five, will get a
chance to get back in the black
and to sweep the season series
when it plays a two-game series
against Cal this weekend.
So far this season Stanford has
had the Midas touch when playing
the Bears, winning both contests
by one-run margins, 5-4 and 2-1.
Saturday's home game begins at
3 p.m.
By winning one of the two week
end tilts, Stanford will win for
the first time since 1952 a season
series against Cal.
THE WINS against Cal have
been the only wins in ils 13 league
outings. Cal's fortunes aren't
much better as it has lost all but
three games against Santa Bar
bara.
Pitching was the key to the
first two Cal wins, and Coach
Dutch Fehring is hoping for simi
lar performances from his mound
aces this weekend. Dick Kovace
vich, 1-4 in CIBA play, pitched six
perfect innings against Cal the
last time around and will prob
ably pitch when Stanford plays
at Berkeley this afternoon. Oppos
ing him will be Cal's Ray Evans,
a 4-0 hurler on the season.
Terry Docken, who received
credit for the other win against
Cal, will probably start Saturday's
game for the Indians. St. Mary's
hit him hard this week, and Coach
Fehring might go instead with
righthander John Mason, who
pitched well in relief in his last
j appearances on the mound.
FACING THE Indians at home
will be either Larry Colton or
Bill Harrison, both of whom have
lost to the Cards this year.
The hitting on both squads is
marked by several outstanding
batsmen, but not strong depth.
For the Tribe, both catcher Jim
Hibbs, who is hitting, 462, and
I Bob Cox are over .300. Gloveman
Pete Middlekauff, after a bad be
■ ginning, is the number three swat
| tor for the Indians.

Top batsmen for Cal are out
fielder Mike Epstein and infielder
Rich Mortola. Epstein has plenty
of power having five homeruns to
his credit.

Pete Middlekauff, after a bad be
■ ginning, is the number three swat
| tor for the Indians.

Top batsmen for Cal are out
fielder Mike Epstein and infielder
Rich Mortola. Epstein has plenty
of power having five homeruns to
his credit.
The Stanford baseball squad,
which this week fell below 1 h e
.500 mark while extending its los
ing streak to five, will get a
chance to get back in the black
and to sweep the season series
when it plays a two-game series
against Cal this weekend.
So far this season Stanford has
had the Midas touch when playing
the Bears, winning both contests
by one-run margins, 5-4 and 2-1.
Saturday's home game begins at
3 p.m.
By winning one of the two week
end tilts, Stanford will win for
the first time since 1952 a season
series against Cal.
THE WINS against Cal have
been the only wins in ils 13 league
outings. Cal's fortunes aren't
much better as it has lost all but
three games against Santa Bar
bara.
Pitching was the key to the
first two Cal wins, and Coach
Dutch Fehring is hoping for simi
lar performances from his mound
aces this weekend. Dick Kovace
vich, 1-4 in CIBA play, pitched six
perfect innings against Cal the
last time around and will prob
ably pitch when Stanford plays
at Berkeley this afternoon. Oppos
ing him will be Cal's Ray Evans,
a 4-0 hurler on the season.
Terry Docken, who received
credit for the other win against
Cal, will probably start Saturday's
game for the Indians. St. Mary's
hit him hard this week, and Coach
Fehring might go instead with
righthander John Mason, who
pitched well in relief in his last
j appearances on the mound.
FACING THE Indians at home
will be either Larry Colton or
Bill Harrison, both of whom have
lost to the Cards this year.
The hitting on both squads is
marked by several outstanding
batsmen, but not strong depth.
For the Tribe, both catcher Jim
Hibbs, who is hitting, 462, and
I Bob Cox are over .300. Gloveman
