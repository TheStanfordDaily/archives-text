# CAL FAVORED BUT...
## Big Meet Up For Grabs 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
"1 just can't make a prediction I
! on Hi# Moot. It's up for grabs like
it always is, and it oould bo the I
closest since I've been at Stanford
or even the closest ever."
That's how Stanford track coach
Pay ton Jordan describes the Rig
j Meet that will unfold before an
expected ten thousand fans to
morrow afternoon in Stanford
Stadium. Freshman competition
begins at 12:15 with the varsity
meet kicking oft" at 1:30.
BASED ON the results of meets
run earlier this year, it looks like
Jordan has a point. The Daily
scratch sheet lists Cal as a paper
thin 73-72 choice, and if all the
athletes run lo their expected
form, that's the way it will turn
out.
A 73-72 meet would be the clos
est since Jordan began coaching
at Stanford in 19:77. His closest
thus far has been a 69-62 defeat
in 1961. Jordan has a two-game
winning streak against Brutus
Hamilton's Golden Bears. The
closest margin of victory in the j
I 68 meet series which extends back
to 1893 was 61 1/5 to 60 4/5 for
Stanford in 1922. There also have
been two ties.
Jordan's record in Big Meet
competition has been a rather
mediocre 2-5. But this is some
what misleading, as his two vic
tories have come in the last two
years, last year's being by a
whopping 92-53 margin.
THE TRIBE coach maintains
j that his team must produce all
j up and down tho line in order.
"This means that our veterans
and seniors must produce better
than they have all season. It's up
to the seniors, and since that is

their last Big Meet, we expect
| their pride to m:ike t hem do
i hotter than they have at any time
I this year."
j Brutus IT ami 11 on, Jordan's
counterpart at Berkeley, sounded
just as cautious as the Stanford
coach when contacted by Th e
Daily yesterday. "It'll lie tight if
we win it. They're deeper than
we are, but we'll give them a good
light," was all he could say.
Hamilton expects his top per
formances to come from sprinter
Dave Archibald, who will double

in the 220 and 440 and run both j
relays; Gene Johnson, who will ,
double in the high jump and the ,
broad jump; and Roger Olson, the j
1962 NCAA high jump champ, j
who wil double in the javelin as !
well as his specialty.
BRUCE BALLMER, Cal's fine
48 foot triple jumper, hurt last
week in Ihe Bear's near upset of
USC, will compete, but Hamilton !
says he has done nothing but trot
around all week during practice.
The Cal coach indicated he did
not think Ballmer would be much '

|of a throat to Stanford's Stove
I Cortright.
Both coaches named several
I events that they felt could swing
the meet one way or the other.
The javelin is tho main one of
these, as Olson and Stanford's
George Porter and Bob Stoecker,
are all extremely closely matched.
Other key events should be the
880, where three runners each
could win, and the hurdles, where
Steve Cortright's leg remains a
question mark.
