# Issues That Need To Be Aired In ASSU Campaign
## Editorial 
### 
Its enough to make W ashington look like
a country town on a Monday night.
All tin 1 controversies at Stanford this
spring, that is.
FROM FRANK MORSE to rush to civil
rights to religion — there's the whole gamut
of issues, many of them intertwined with deep
philosophical questions.
Because of this, then, we would like to see
a lull discussion of these issues in the present
ASSU elections campaign.
Hut, so far, we have been disappointed.
AS MUCH AS a dialectic is sorely needed,
the Elections Commission has scheduled only

a very minimum number of debates between
the presidential candidates. We cannot un
derstand why.
And one of the candidates has refused to
show up at several meetings, has vetoed sug
gestions that there be qucstion-and-answer
periods and has dodged Daily reporters the
entire week.
Two other presidential candidates—both
highly qualified and articulate otherwise —
have taken ambiguous stands on the rush
policy, completely skirting any discussion of
the proposals recommended by the five-man
rush committee in early April.
THIS IS LUDICROUS. The rush policy

lias been a big issue at Stanford for a month.
There is absolutely no reason why these can
didates are not prepared to take definite
stands.
We could go on with other examples of
isucs that have been clouded in this campaign.
But the point is simple:
There are many issues and many views
on campus. They need to be aired in this cam
paign.
So far they have not been.

The Barrier
I'Yw aspects ol Stanford life are as disap
pointing as the overall lack of informal stu
dent-faculty contact.
I he misleading <S-to-J ratio lias led many
a new comer here into believing that the stage
is perpetually set for that great Socratic dia
logue.
Well, it's not.
I he problem is that there's very little dia
logue ol any kind. Most students and most
professors simply do not make the effort to
meet each other — even when it can be done
so easily with existing facilities and under

the present ineal system.
The student-comprised Trcsidder Un i o u
Hoard, however, is attempting to remedy the
problem. Among their planned innovations:
Student-faculty coffee hours, the first ones
scheduled for next Wednesday and Friday in
the small lounge, from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Other ideas being considered by the board
are departmental teas and a separate area in
the grill room set aside especially for student
faculty use.
Wo congratulate the board 112 or opening up
new and much-needed student-faculty chan
nels. Perhaps at last those barriers w ill begin
to crumble.
