## Williams 'Night Of The Iguana' Electric In Spite Of Defects 
### Foster Hirsch 
"The Night of the Iguana,' now being presented by the Actor's
Workshop is playwright I ennessee Williams latest excursion into
that psvchosexual universe so definitely his own. True to form
his characters are conceived in chaos and set down in hvstcria; thev
are not so much people as they are monstrous caricatures. Unless
our experience has been unusual, it is not possible to identifv with
them.
il we are willing, they do assume an identitv ol their own
in a world parallel to ours, a world in which luxurious aberrations
are investigated with a eobra-longued acerbity and offered to the
audience with the subtlety of a Mack Sennett pie.
As in the other plays, the atmosphere ol a nightmare fantasy
informs Ihe Night of the Iguana. Ilie horrors this time, however,
take place in a smoldering and exotic Mexican jungle instead of that
degenerate South which has been such fertile ground for Williams
in the past.
ON THE VERANDAH of a singularlv dilapidated hotel, Wil
liams has gathered together a quartet of incongruous, monumen
tally dramatic characters. Ihe first is an earthy, rccentlv-widowed
harridan who is as much at loose ends as the hotel which she owns.
Next in sight is a minister who has been defrocked for "forni
cation and atheism. He has become a leader of guided tours, and
as the play opens he faces expulsion for having seduced tlx' young
est member of his present part}', lie is, as well, on the verge of a
nervous collapse.
A fragile New England spinster and her "97-ycar-young" grand
father complete the group. To pay for their expenses, the woman
paints and the old man recites his own poetry. They live in a charm
ing dream world totally at odds with the realitv of their poverty and
loneliness.
These people, like the captured iguana w ho hovers svinbolicallv
in the background, are all at the end of their ropes. They reach
out to each other as their lives briefly cross in this luxuriant, suffo
cating jungle, and they leave each other a step beyond despair.
These are among Williams' most happy creations; they are
vividly realized, volatile, and of course extravagantly theatrical.
The blend of raw comedy and high-powered drama makes us
both amused and moved by these damned and dispossessed people.
For all its richness of character, however, the play lacks a unify
ing theme; failing to integrate his diverse themes into a cohesive
w hole, Williams deals briefly and inconclusively with atheism, des
pair. sexual 1 rigidity, loneliness, the fragility of human relationships,
and Nazi sadism. lie has further marred his play by some obvious
symbolism (the captured iguana, a tropical thunderstorm, rambling
dialogue about living on "realistic and fantastic" levels) which is
simply unworthy of him.
The Actor s Workshop Production, while always competent, is
not quite as exciting as the play itself. Thev have realized only par
tially the electricity w Inch, despite imperfections, any Williams play
generates. Williams greatest achievement is the bravura roles
which he so generouslv supplies his actors, yet in this production
all the actors arcn t lully aware of their good fortune.
"The Night of the Iguana continues through May 15 at The
Marines Memorial Theatre at Sutter and Mason in San Francisco.
