# Individualism Far Ahead Of Its Time
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In their recent letters de
noucing Individualism, Carroll
Blend and Pamela Ruben paid
my philosophy their highest
compliment, by distorting and
augmenting it in order to at
tack it. Since they chose not
to examine my thesis that
Classes and Class Obligations
do not exist - 1 will correct
some of their misstatements.
First I do not speak for
Ayn Hand. She is the greatest
living philosopher, and I re
spect her, but I think for my
self.
SECOND —the constitutional
amendment prohibiting the
Poll Tax applies only to Fed
eral elections, leaving a loop
hole for any state to tax special
local elections. Thus, the Poll
Tax still exists in principle.
Moreover, to cite my seeming
ignorance of the amendment
as a refutation of my philoso
phy is a juvenile trick.
Third I quote Mr. Blend:
"Perhaps it is unwise to quote
the Bible in opposition to Ayn
Rand." It is.
Fourth Cain was not an
innocent bystander he de
liberately killed his brother. If
you hold that bystanders are
guilty of a crime, then you
must sponsor mob rule by
the former bystanders.
FIFTH I quote Miss Ru
ben: "Arc you physically
forced to pay Income Tax ...?"
The government fines or con
fines anyone who refuses to
pay. and thus physically, forc
ibly, violates his right to Lib
erty. By 'right' I mean 'sanc
tion for independent action
that which may bo exercised
without anyone's permission.'
Observe thai without the right
to private property, no inde
pendent action is possible.
Do not "brand" Individual
ism do not stamp it wit h
fallacies you wish il implied.
It is not a vanguard for white

supremacists, but the defender
of each man's Individual Rights
and so it will not tolerate
vandalism via "shop-in."
It does not hold that the self
is so evil that man must secure
this blessing on the sacrificial
altars of God and Society, but
that the self is so good that
man should not degrade it for
the sake of leeches and so
it will not condone bleeding the
innocent for the crimes of the
guilty.
It is not a nineteenth cen
tury doctrine, but a philosophy
so far ahead of its "time" that
il is reviled by a crowd of .jeer
ing cowards and even so, it
will not excuse their vain eva
sions and smears.

Editor, The Daily:
I wish to go on record for
protesting the "art" exhibit
that we at Encina Hall are cur
rently exposed to. The previ
ous exhibit has been difficult
enough to swallow, but t hesc
things that are hanging now
why, this is a bit too much.
No amount of intellectual
trickery in terms of the most
sophisticated art-critical jargon
could elevate this crude and
primitive kind of ugliness into
anything more than what it
really is: stuff that would be
thrown out of a grade school
competition without a second
glance. Why, then, is it being
displayed in the busy Admin
istration building of a first
rate University?
I DO NOT know the poor
hobbyist who produced it, and
in no way do I mean to offend
personally. No one will deny
to anyone absolute sovereignty

in whatever he does with paint
on a flat surface in the privacy
of his home.
But I feel strongly about the
demand that a painting will
have to fulfill a sot of require
ments the moment it is in
tended to be displayed in a
public place (other than mu
seums and art galleries, of
course, where anything may
have a legitimate chance to
test itself). II will have to be
acceptable to be lived with by
ihe average eye in much the
same way that a beautiful
piece of music is more accept
able to the average ear and
more rewarding psychologi
cally than the noise of heavy
construction work.
The requirements are simple,
obvious and realistic. Roughly,
they are that a painting, even
if representational, is to have
consistency, balance, harmony,
variety and, last but not least,
skill of execution. And these
requirements are not arbitrary
rules, indeed they have a
physiological bearing on the
visual sensibilities as crucial
as the right kind and propor
tion of ingredients in 1h e
preparation of a meal have
on taste and stomach (and that
includes the proper serving of
it».
.IIIKiKIJ BY such realistic
measuring sticks, these things
now on display reveal a most
pitiful and chaotic state, not to
mention the unnecessary off
ence to Ihe people in Eneina
who daily do a job infinitely
more valuable compared with
these fruits of an awkward
and ugly way of killing time.
1 hope that they be removed
and, if nothing more appropri
ate for us to live with is avail
able. the delightful innocence
of blank walls be left undis
turbed.

I wish to go on record for
protesting the "art" exhibit
that we at Encina Hall are cur
rently exposed to. The previ
ous exhibit has been difficult
enough to swallow, but t hesc
things that are hanging now
why, this is a bit too much.
No amount of intellectual
trickery in terms of the most
sophisticated art-critical jargon
could elevate this crude and
primitive kind of ugliness into
anything more than what it
really is: stuff that would be
thrown out of a grade school
competition without a second
glance. Why, then, is it being
displayed in the busy Admin
istration building of a first
rate University?
I DO NOT know the poor
hobbyist who produced it, and
in no way do I mean to offend
personally. No one will deny
to anyone absolute sovereignty

in whatever he does with paint
on a flat surface in the privacy
of his home.
But I feel strongly about the
demand that a painting will
have to fulfill a sot of require
ments the moment it is in
tended to be displayed in a
public place (other than mu
seums and art galleries, of
course, where anything may
have a legitimate chance to
test itself). II will have to be
acceptable to be lived with by
ihe average eye in much the
same way that a beautiful
piece of music is more accept
able to the average ear and
more rewarding psychologi
cally than the noise of heavy
construction work.
The requirements are simple,
obvious and realistic. Roughly,
they are that a painting, even
if representational, is to have
consistency, balance, harmony,
variety and, last but not least,
skill of execution. And these
requirements are not arbitrary
rules, indeed they have a
physiological bearing on the
visual sensibilities as crucial
as the right kind and propor
tion of ingredients in 1h e
preparation of a meal have
on taste and stomach (and that
includes the proper serving of
it».
.IIIKiKIJ BY such realistic
measuring sticks, these things
now on display reveal a most
pitiful and chaotic state, not to
mention the unnecessary off
ence to Ihe people in Eneina
who daily do a job infinitely
more valuable compared with
these fruits of an awkward
and ugly way of killing time.
1 hope that they be removed
and, if nothing more appropri
ate for us to live with is avail
able. the delightful innocence
of blank walls be left undis

In their recent letters de
noucing Individualism, Carroll
Blend and Pamela Ruben paid
my philosophy their highest
compliment, by distorting and
augmenting it in order to at
tack it. Since they chose not
to examine my thesis that
Classes and Class Obligations
do not exist - 1 will correct
some of their misstatements.
First I do not speak for
Ayn Hand. She is the greatest
living philosopher, and I re
spect her, but I think for my
self.
SECOND —the constitutional
amendment prohibiting the
Poll Tax applies only to Fed
eral elections, leaving a loop
hole for any state to tax special
local elections. Thus, the Poll
Tax still exists in principle.
Moreover, to cite my seeming
ignorance of the amendment
as a refutation of my philoso
phy is a juvenile trick.
Third I quote Mr. Blend:
"Perhaps it is unwise to quote
the Bible in opposition to Ayn
Rand." It is.
Fourth Cain was not an
innocent bystander he de
liberately killed his brother. If
you hold that bystanders are
guilty of a crime, then you
must sponsor mob rule by
the former bystanders.
FIFTH I quote Miss Ru
ben: "Arc you physically
forced to pay Income Tax ...?"
The government fines or con
fines anyone who refuses to
pay. and thus physically, forc
ibly, violates his right to Lib
erty. By 'right' I mean 'sanc

rently exposed to. The previ
ous exhibit has been difficult
enough to swallow, but t hesc
things that are hanging now
why, this is a bit too much.
No amount of intellectual
trickery in terms of the most
sophisticated art-critical jargon
could elevate this crude and
primitive kind of ugliness into
anything more than what it
really is: stuff that would be
thrown out of a grade school
competition without a second
glance. Why, then, is it being
displayed in the busy Admin
istration building of a first
rate University?
I DO NOT know the poor
hobbyist who produced it, and
in no way do I mean to offend
personally. No one will deny
to anyone absolute sovereignty

in whatever he does with paint
on a flat surface in the privacy
of his home.
But I feel strongly about the
demand that a painting will
have to fulfill a sot of require
ments the moment it is in
tended to be displayed in a
public place (other than mu
seums and art galleries, of
course, where anything may
have a legitimate chance to
test itself). II will have to be
acceptable to be lived with by
ihe average eye in much the
same way that a beautiful
piece of music is more accept
able to the average ear and
more rewarding psychologi
cally than the noise of heavy
construction work.
The requirements are simple,
obvious and realistic. Roughly,
they are that a painting, even
if representational, is to have
consistency, balance, harmony,
variety and, last but not least,
skill of execution. And these
requirements are not arbitrary
rules, indeed they have a
physiological bearing on the
visual sensibilities as crucial
as the right kind and propor
tion of ingredients in 1h e
preparation of a meal have
on taste and stomach (and that
includes the proper serving of
it».
.IIIKiKIJ BY such realistic
measuring sticks, these things
now on display reveal a most
pitiful and chaotic state, not to
mention the unnecessary off
ence to Ihe people in Eneina
who daily do a job infinitely
more valuable compared with
these fruits of an awkward
and ugly way of killing time.
1 hope that they be removed
and, if nothing more appropri
ate for us to live with is avail
able. the delightful innocence
of blank walls be left undis

In their recent letters de
noucing Individualism, Carroll
Blend and Pamela Ruben paid
my philosophy their highest
compliment, by distorting and
augmenting it in order to at
tack it. Since they chose not
to examine my thesis that
Classes and Class Obligations
do not exist - 1 will correct
some of their misstatements.
First I do not speak for
Ayn Hand. She is the greatest
living philosopher, and I re
spect her, but I think for my
self.
SECOND —the constitutional
amendment prohibiting the
Poll Tax applies only to Fed
eral elections, leaving a loop
hole for any state to tax special
local elections. Thus, the Poll
Tax still exists in principle.
Moreover, to cite my seeming
ignorance of the amendment
as a refutation of my philoso
phy is a juvenile trick.
Third I quote Mr. Blend:
"Perhaps it is unwise to quote
the Bible in opposition to Ayn
Rand." It is.
Fourth Cain was not an
innocent bystander he de
liberately killed his brother. If
you hold that bystanders are
guilty of a crime, then you
must sponsor mob rule by
the former bystanders.
FIFTH I quote Miss Ru
ben: "Arc you physically
forced to pay Income Tax ...?"
The government fines or con
fines anyone who refuses to
pay. and thus physically, forc
ibly, violates his right to Lib
erty. By 'right' I mean 'sanc
tion for independent action
that which may bo exercised
without anyone's permission.'
Observe thai without the right
to private property, no inde
pendent action is possible.
Do not "brand" Individual
ism do not stamp it wit h
fallacies you wish il implied.
It is not a vanguard for white

supremacists, but the defender
of each man's Individual Rights
and so it will not tolerate
vandalism via "shop-in."
It does not hold that the self
is so evil that man must secure
this blessing on the sacrificial
altars of God and Society, but
that the self is so good that
man should not degrade it for
the sake of leeches and so
it will not condone bleeding the
innocent for the crimes of the
guilty.
It is not a nineteenth cen
tury doctrine, but a philosophy
so far ahead of its "time" that
il is reviled by a crowd of .jeer
ing cowards and even so, it
will not excuse their vain eva
sions and smears.
