## Does Academic Freedom Include Communists?

Mullord Sibley, political science professor at the University of
Minnesota, in an article on academic freedom, writes, "The univer
sity campus as a \\ hole 1 should welcome .ill kinds of propaganda and
discussion groups, from those who challenge tin* status <|iio at all
points to those who support it on even score. . . .
Sil > ic\ s comments are important for their relexanec to the ever
present philosopliical question oi what the responsibility of the uni
versity is ni the realm oi academic freedom if its prime function is
to he the pursuit of truth, a quest which may require looking at con
tradicting opinions, even ii one opinion is that of a minority and an
unpopular minority, at that.
HIS COMMENTS, howt •ver. have particular relevance in view
oi a current situation at the College of San Mateo, w here opponents
ol a proposed speech by Communist Mickey Lima at the College
are attempting to get a court injunction against Lima's talk.
The injunction attempt is based on a claim that the college tailed
to give proper notice of the Lima speech. However, this is only
'he legal basis. 'I hi' real basis ol opposition seems to be the assump
tion that by letting a communist speak on campus, the college is in
viting propaganda which may convert students to the speakers
philosophy.
An advertisement, entitled "Should your tax money be used to
support communist speakers on campus?" and placed by opponents
of Lima's visit, states "By now every real (emphasis added) Ameri
can realizes that communism is wrong. . . . With real Americans
Communism is a closed question; there is nothing to discuss."
AN EDITORIAL IN THE San Mateo Times further states,
"Academic freedom calls for information, but not for opportunities
to make converts."
It is ironic that on the same day on which \l Lowcnstein speaks
at Stanford about the Civil Bights Movement to create a more free
and democratic society, only several miles away at San Mateo,
people termed by the I inies as "good citizens," fight to make our so
ciety a closed and defensive one, afraid to allow the free expression
of ideas in opposition to the status quo.
The opposition to Lima's talk raises several questions by the
very method in which it states its case. First, it would be most in
teresting to hear the definition of a "real" American — would a civil
rights worker, a pacifist, or, for that matter, anyone w ho dares to
question stereotype of the American way of life, meet the require
ments?
II the definition of a "real American is that ol someone who sees
communism as all wrong, would he not want to see communist
speakers on all university campuses exposing the untruth of their
ideology? Or does he lack real understanding of his own ideology,
and avoid questions for fear lie max - be unable to answer them?
But, then by the simple fact of raising these questions, we seem
to cross onto dangerous ground, for the basic creed of those oppos
ing communist speakers at the university seems to be, "To question
is to oppose, and to oppose is wrong." Which raises a question—
The creed of "no questioning, only closed questions," is this the creed
of a democratic society?

The opposition to Lima's talk raises several questions by the
very method in which it states its case. First, it would be most in
teresting to hear the definition of a "real" American — would a civil
rights worker, a pacifist, or, for that matter, anyone w ho dares to
question stereotype of the American way of life, meet the require
ments?
II the definition of a "real American is that ol someone who sees
communism as all wrong, would he not want to see communist
speakers on all university campuses exposing the untruth of their
ideology? Or does he lack real understanding of his own ideology,
and avoid questions for fear lie max - be unable to answer them?
But, then by the simple fact of raising these questions, we seem
to cross onto dangerous ground, for the basic creed of those oppos
ing communist speakers at the university seems to be, "To question
is to oppose, and to oppose is wrong." Which raises a question—
The creed of "no questioning, only closed questions," is this the creed
of a democratic society?

Mullord Sibley, political science professor at the University of
Minnesota, in an article on academic freedom, writes, "The univer
sity campus as a \\ hole 1 should welcome .ill kinds of propaganda and
discussion groups, from those who challenge tin* status <|iio at all
points to those who support it on even score. . . .
Sil > ic\ s comments are important for their relexanec to the ever
present philosopliical question oi what the responsibility of the uni
versity is ni the realm oi academic freedom if its prime function is
to he the pursuit of truth, a quest which may require looking at con
tradicting opinions, even ii one opinion is that of a minority and an
unpopular minority, at that.
HIS COMMENTS, howt •ver. have particular relevance in view
oi a current situation at the College of San Mateo, w here opponents
ol a proposed speech by Communist Mickey Lima at the College
are attempting to get a court injunction against Lima's talk.
The injunction attempt is based on a claim that the college tailed
to give proper notice of the Lima speech. However, this is only
'he legal basis. 'I hi' real basis ol opposition seems to be the assump
tion that by letting a communist speak on campus, the college is in
viting propaganda which may convert students to the speakers
philosophy.
An advertisement, entitled "Should your tax money be used to
support communist speakers on campus?" and placed by opponents
of Lima's visit, states "By now every real (emphasis added) Ameri
can realizes that communism is wrong. . . . With real Americans
Communism is a closed question; there is nothing to discuss."
AN EDITORIAL IN THE San Mateo Times further states,
"Academic freedom calls for information, but not for opportunities
to make converts."
It is ironic that on the same day on which \l Lowcnstein speaks
at Stanford about the Civil Bights Movement to create a more free
and democratic society, only several miles away at San Mateo,
people termed by the I inies as "good citizens," fight to make our so
ciety a closed and defensive one, afraid to allow the free expression
of ideas in opposition to the status quo.
