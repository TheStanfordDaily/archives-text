# 'Amicable' Agreement Gained In Law Association Dispute
## 
### BOB COX 
Tlu'Stan lord Law Association and I lie L'nix ersit\ officially re
solved their dispute yesterday over tlie Law Association s handling
ol its finances.
The disagreement originated two weeks ago when the Student
Affairs and Services subcommittee objected to the Law Vssocia-

tion's failure to include within its
constitution a provision for chan
nelling its funds through the Stu
dents Organization Fund.
YESTERDAY'S resolution cen
tered around the definition of a
"voluntary organization." The
Student Affairs subcommittee re
quires that only "Voluntary" or
ganizations provide in their con
stitutions for banking with the
SOF.
Mrs. Judith Hanneman, whose
function it is to read the constitu
tions of prospective organizations
and submit them to the subcom
mittee. told the Daily that a vol
untary organization hud been
carefully defined by Iho Trustees
last year. It is one in which "mem
bership is not mandatory."
Since ail registered law stu
dents are automatically members
of the Stanford Law Association,
it was officially' decided that the

f â€”
J graduate students' organization
| was not a voluntary one.
MRS. HANNEMAN added, "Un
der the ASSU constitution the
Law Association still has to bank
with the SOF, but only voluntary
organizations must provide for
it in their constiulions."
Chuck CaJe, Law Association
president, expressed satisfaction
with the agreement and described
i it as an "amicable settlement."
