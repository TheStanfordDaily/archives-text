## Lowenstein Speaks Today 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
Allard K. Lowenstein North Carolina State
College pi'ofessor and long-time civil rights leader
will discuss the "Trend and Tactics in Civil
Rights North and South" in an all-campus speech
in the large lounge of Tresidder at 1:1.1 this after
noon.
Lowenstein, who acted as Advisory Commit
tee Chairman for lite "Aaron Henry for Governor"
mock election in Mississippi last November, has
long been a moving force in the civil rights move
ment across the nation. However, in a brief inter
view with The Daily yesterday afternoon, he sug
gested that, at this crucial moment, his views on
increased civil rights "militancy" have begun to
diverge from those of many others actively in
volved in the movement: "Recently, I've had some
deeply disturbing disagreements with some of the
leaders I've worked with in 1 ho past concerning the
tactics best employed."
"IT'S IMPORTANT to assess whether what
one's doing is getting one toward one's goal or
not," Lowenstein continued. Undoubtedly, just
such an assessment will form the basis for his
address this afternoon.
In recent months, the controversy over tactics
has become increasingly strident within the civil
rights movement itself.
Robert Moses. Program Director for the Con
gress of Federated Organizations (COFOi in Mis
sissippi, speaking to the All Western States Civil
Rights Conference ;ii Stanford last week, stronglv
defended the "stall ins" and "lie ins" inerea.sinjjlv

employed by northern-based eivil rights groups.
Lowenstein, however, indicated that he could not
conscientiously support Moses' position. "The
problem." he said, "is one of increasing frustration,
leading to increasing alleged militancy, leading to
reaction, at the very moment when progress
seemed possible."
LOVVMNSTKIN emphasized that the immediate
question confronting many concerned civil rights
leaders does not involve the possibility of armed
rebellion in the Black Muslim style: "The issue
now is not violence or non-violence; it is civil dis
obedience or no civil disobedience, and the so-called
militants are for civil disobedience."
Lowenstein agreed that the more moderate fac
tions are gradually being forced out of the civil
rights movement. This does not necessarily indi
cate that "fanatics" are taking over. Lowenstein
stressed that true "extremism" is a function of
personality and that such extremist personalities
are inevitable in any movement as extensive and
emotional as the civil rights struggle. "What is dif
ferent now," Lowenstein explained, "is that the
mass of the Negro community is beginning to re
spond to the idea that nothing else but extremism
will work."
IN KKCKNT WKKKS, Lowenstein has been
speaking to various groups across the country,
describing the existing conditions in Mississippi
'where much of his personal civil rights work has
been centered! and stressing the importance of the
civil rights hill now pending in the U.S. Senate.
He arrived on the Stanford campus yesterday
afternoon for a three-day stay, during which time
he will be a guest nf Stern Hall.

emotional as the civil rights struggle. "What is dif
ferent now," Lowenstein explained, "is that the
mass of the Negro community is beginning to re
spond to the idea that nothing else but extremism
will work."
IN KKCKNT WKKKS, Lowenstein has been
speaking to various groups across the country,
describing the existing conditions in Mississippi
'where much of his personal civil rights work has
been centered! and stressing the importance of the
civil rights hill now pending in the U.S. Senate.
He arrived on the Stanford campus yesterday
afternoon for a three-day stay, during which time
he will be a guest nf Stern Hall.
Allard K. Lowenstein North Carolina State
College pi'ofessor and long-time civil rights leader
will discuss the "Trend and Tactics in Civil
Rights North and South" in an all-campus speech
in the large lounge of Tresidder at 1:1.1 this after
noon.
Lowenstein, who acted as Advisory Commit
tee Chairman for lite "Aaron Henry for Governor"
mock election in Mississippi last November, has
long been a moving force in the civil rights move
ment across the nation. However, in a brief inter
view with The Daily yesterday afternoon, he sug
gested that, at this crucial moment, his views on
increased civil rights "militancy" have begun to
diverge from those of many others actively in
volved in the movement: "Recently, I've had some
deeply disturbing disagreements with some of the
leaders I've worked with in 1 ho past concerning the
tactics best employed."
"IT'S IMPORTANT to assess whether what
one's doing is getting one toward one's goal or
not," Lowenstein continued. Undoubtedly, just
such an assessment will form the basis for his
address this afternoon.
In recent months, the controversy over tactics
has become increasingly strident within the civil
rights movement itself.
Robert Moses. Program Director for the Con
gress of Federated Organizations (COFOi in Mis
sissippi, speaking to the All Western States Civil
Rights Conference ;ii Stanford last week, stronglv
defended the "stall ins" and "lie ins" inerea.sinjjlv

employed by northern-based eivil rights groups.
Lowenstein, however, indicated that he could not
conscientiously support Moses' position. "The
problem." he said, "is one of increasing frustration,
leading to increasing alleged militancy, leading to
reaction, at the very moment when progress
seemed possible."
LOVVMNSTKIN emphasized that the immediate
question confronting many concerned civil rights
leaders does not involve the possibility of armed
rebellion in the Black Muslim style: "The issue
now is not violence or non-violence; it is civil dis
obedience or no civil disobedience, and the so-called
militants are for civil disobedience."
Lowenstein agreed that the more moderate fac
tions are gradually being forced out of the civil
rights movement. This does not necessarily indi
cate that "fanatics" are taking over. Lowenstein
stressed that true "extremism" is a function of
personality and that such extremist personalities
are inevitable in any movement as extensive and
emotional as the civil rights struggle. "What is dif
ferent now," Lowenstein explained, "is that the
mass of the Negro community is beginning to re
spond to the idea that nothing else but extremism
will work."
