# ACLU Asks Winbigler Opinion On Morse Case
## Do Students Get Justice? 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Staff Editor 
A letter listing several "prob
lems" in the handling fo the sus
pension of Frank Morse has been
sent by the American Civil Liber
tics Union to Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler.
The letter, signed by Ernest
Bessig, executive director of the
ACLU of Northern California, ex
pressed concern as to "whether
students at Stanford University
who arc subject to disciplinary
proceedings receive due process."
LISTING six aspects of the
Morse case, the letter requested
Winbigler's comments and sug
gested that "this is a matter on
which the Associated Students
should press for investigation,
and, if need bo, remedial action."
Stated the letter: "In our read
ing of the record in the Morse
ease we have been struck by the
following:
"1. The apparent failure of
your office to apprise Morse ex
plicit y of the grounds for his sus
pension.
"2. THE DENIAL of an oppor
tunity to Morse to handle undis
clo s e d allegations, assertedly
made by a faculty committee in
Florence which has not accorded
him a hearing.
"3. The imposition of a harsh
penalty, which is patently exces
sive of Morse's only offense was
breaking the panel of a door.
"4. The offering of no reason
for treating Morse differently
from two other students who had
assumedly committed the same
offense.
"5. THE ALLEGED attempt by
your office to suppress consid
eration of the case and the failure
of your office to cooperate with
the Judicial Council in its con
sideration of the matter.
"6. The need for clarifying pro
cedures for handling disciplinary
cases of students residing on for
eign campuses."
At the conclusion of the letter,
Bessig stated "I suppose it is too
late to do much about the injury

done to the academic career of
Morse, except to make sure that
the damage does not extend be
yond the current quarter.
"The underlying problem," he
continued, "ought to be examined
in order to insure all Stanford
students that t hey will receive
fair dealings in the event of dis
ciplinary action by the Univer
sity."
Copies of the letter were also
sent to Darrell R. Halvcrson,
chairman of the Judicial Council,
and Vernon E. Wedin, ASSU pres
ident.
