# Bryson Men At Work In Active Campaign
## 
### BOB PICKUS (First of a Series) 
"VVe want this to be a cam
paign based on issues and
qualifications, rather t li a n
less important factors such
as living groups and person
alities."
Witli this statement by
the candidate as their im
mediate goal, and with his
election as their ultimate
hope, John Bryson, his as
sociates and supporters
have begun their campaign
for the AKKU presidency. As
with every campaign, their
problem is to carry the im
age of the candidate.to the
voters with whom his fate
will rest.
"The trend at Stanford."
says Bryson, "is one of the
realization of the |M>tential
of stud en t government.
The major question in this
election is which of the can
didates has the deepest un
derstanding of this trend."
One need not ask the Bryson
people the answer to this
question, hut one might
wonder how they will go
about getting the student
body to agree with them.
Herein lies their task.
Pulling a page out of the

book of many a political fig
ure, the Bryson campaign
coordinators will stage a 75
cent-per-plate dinner tomor
row evening at the Women's
Clubhouse. The time is 0:00
and ticket-seekers should
call campaign "headquar
ters" at 322-4039.
What, then, are the issues
as the candidate sees them,
and his qualifications as he
presents them?
"I feel that I have pre
sented explicit, creative pro
grams that I would insti
tute, that they (the other
candidates) do not have,"
Bryson explains. He places
major emphasis upon hi s
plans for a student exchange
program with Negro univer
sities: the proposed student
government int e r n pro
gram; liberalization of the
meal guest exchange,
John's past experience in
cludes a term as president
of Arroyo House, Wilbur
Hall; the presidency of his
sophomore class, and the
presidency of his Stanford
in Germany group. A Dean's
List student, Bryson has
been active on the Honors
and Social Thought program
of student and faculty lead
ers.
