# GARNER 80-65 VICTORY
## Stanford Thinclads Hustle Past Bears 
### 
By PETE KING
Paced by Eric Frische's brilliant
upset victory in the 100-yard dash,
Stanford's hustling young track
men hung an 80-65 defeat on their
Cal rivals in the 69th Big Meet
Saturday in Stanford Stadium.
Halfway through the meet, Cal
held a 36-32 lead and it looked
like a light finish. The Bears were
favored to increase that margin
by taking first and second in the
100.
FRISCHE'S victory burst what
ever hopes Cal had for victory.
After that, it was easy for the
Indians. Steve Cortright picked
tip his expected three victories
and Ken Fraser and Frische
slipped by Cal's demoralized 220
sprinters for second and third.
It was the third straight Stan
ford track triumph over the Col
den Bears. Stanford's seniors, who

won as freshmen in 1.961, have I
never lost to Cal. Stanford leads I
the series, 35 32, with two ties.
STANFORD Coach Pay ton Jor
dan had called on his seniors to |
put forth the supreme effort in i
their last dual meet. They didn't
let him down. Cort right., nursing
a slightly sore leg, loafed to a 14.9 j
win in the high hurdles, took the
intermediates in 37.6, a meet rec
ord, then triple jumped his best
of the year, with a 49- 3 4 effort: for
first place.
Other fine senior performances
were Fraser's 21.7 clocking in the
220 for second, when he'd been
figured for third. Bill Pratt turned
in another of his gutty 880 fin
ishes, sprinting past Cal's Dave
Fishback in the final turn for a
1:51.1 win.
Due to coolish weather and a
finicky wind, the athletes didn't

record tremendous times.
HOWEVER, for sophomore pole
vaulter Chuck Smith, who goes
higher every week, even the wind
wasn't a hindrance. Smith got
one of the biggest cheers of the
afternoon from the crowd of
5,700 when he soared over 15 feet,
3 inches to set a Stanford record,
lie then .just missed at 15-7.
Probably the season's strangest
file finish was recorded by Paul
Schlicke, Harlan Andrews, a n d
Harry McCalla. who swept th e
event for Stanford. Coming down
the home stretch three abreast
and a good 14 seconds ahead of
the nearest Cal runner, they
joined hands in brotherly tri
umph as they jogged across the
finish line.
SOPH 808 STOECKER came
through with a workhorse perfor
mance. He sailed the javelin 220
feet 2 inches to edge two fine Bear
trowers, then flipped the discus
165-4 la for second.
An upset 1-2 Stanford finish

in I ho broad jump was led by Rob
Mclntyre, at 23-7'^.
Jordan dedicated the meet to
Garnet t Young, long-lime fol
lower of Stanford track who has
served as a timer for over 2.1
years.
