# Indian Nine Splits With Cal; Cops Big Game Season Series
## 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
The Stanford baseball squad
was somewhat iconoclastically in
clined this weekend, as they
crushed a tradition that seemed
hoarier than its 12 years — that
of losing a season series to arch
rival Cal — by splitting a home
and-home series with the Bears.
The Cards clinched the season
series on Friday as star twirier
Dick Kovacevich outduelled rival
hurler Ray Evans on Berkeley's
Edward Diamond, in a 12-inning,
3-2 contest, which marked the
third straight time the Bears had
fallen to the Indians by one run.
The first game was a classic.
After eleven innings, with the
game knotted up at 2-2. and both
pitchers having evidenced splen
did control throughout — Kovace
vich walking only one, and that
intentionally, and Evans walking

four — the Indians finally broke
it up in the top of the twelfth.
With two outs and Pete Middle
kaul'f on first with a single, Eon
Yett cracked a double into left
centerfield which scored Middle
kauff, and won the game and the
series for the Tribe.
IN THE second encounter, Ihe
Indians bowed to the Bears at Iho
,Sunken Diamond, 2-0. And it
wasn't easy.
In order to lose, Stanford had
to let the brilliant 13 strikeout
pitching of John Mason go for
naught. Not only that, they also
had to blow a ninth inning rally
that saw the bases loaded with
nobody out. But then again, it was
a game with many missed oppor
tunities.
With one out in the second inn
ing, second baseman George
Thachor lined a triple into left
center. Then, in a call which was
baffling when first seen and still
more baffling in reflection, Yett
darted towards the plate on a sui
cide squeeze play. As bad luck j
would have it, batter Lon Ray
mond couldn't lay his bat on the
ball. Needless to say he was dead
as prohibition. Also needless to
relate, Raymond stroked a single
to center on the next pitch.
CAL SCORED their two runs
in the top of the eighth. Bill Har
rison singled, Ri c h Mortola
bunted safely, and. after they
each advanced on a groundout,
they were driven in by Dave
Myers' single to left.
It looked in the bottom of the
ninth, as if the Indians simply
couldn't help but score. George
Thacher an d Lon Raymond
singled and Cal's Harrison bob
bled a bunt attempt by Tom Mel
zer, and the sacks were loaded to
capacity with none out.
BUT pinchhitter Bob Hollmann j
popped up and Gary Smith 1
grounded into a double play, and J
the inning and the game were!
summarily ended.

series for the Tribe.
IN THE second encounter, Ihe
Indians bowed to the Bears at Iho
,Sunken Diamond, 2-0. And it
wasn't easy.
In order to lose, Stanford had
to let the brilliant 13 strikeout
pitching of John Mason go for
naught. Not only that, they also
had to blow a ninth inning rally
that saw the bases loaded with
nobody out. But then again, it was
a game with many missed oppor
tunities.
With one out in the second inn
ing, second baseman George
Thachor lined a triple into left
center. Then, in a call which was
baffling when first seen and still
more baffling in reflection, Yett
darted towards the plate on a sui
cide squeeze play. As bad luck j
would have it, batter Lon Ray
mond couldn't lay his bat on the
ball. Needless to say he was dead
as prohibition. Also needless to
relate, Raymond stroked a single
to center on the next pitch.
CAL SCORED their two runs
in the top of the eighth. Bill Har
rison singled, Ri c h Mortola
bunted safely, and. after they
each advanced on a groundout,
they were driven in by Dave
Myers' single to left.
It looked in the bottom of the
ninth, as if the Indians simply
couldn't help but score. George
Thacher an d Lon Raymond
singled and Cal's Harrison bob
bled a bunt attempt by Tom Mel
zer, and the sacks were loaded to
capacity with none out.
BUT pinchhitter Bob Hollmann j
popped up and Gary Smith 1
grounded into a double play, and J
the inning and the game were!
summarily ended.
The Stanford baseball squad
was somewhat iconoclastically in
clined this weekend, as they
crushed a tradition that seemed
hoarier than its 12 years — that
of losing a season series to arch
rival Cal — by splitting a home
and-home series with the Bears.
The Cards clinched the season
series on Friday as star twirier
Dick Kovacevich outduelled rival
hurler Ray Evans on Berkeley's
Edward Diamond, in a 12-inning,
3-2 contest, which marked the
third straight time the Bears had
fallen to the Indians by one run.
The first game was a classic.
After eleven innings, with the
game knotted up at 2-2. and both
pitchers having evidenced splen
did control throughout — Kovace
vich walking only one, and that
intentionally, and Evans walking

four — the Indians finally broke
it up in the top of the twelfth.
With two outs and Pete Middle
kaul'f on first with a single, Eon
Yett cracked a double into left
centerfield which scored Middle
kauff, and won the game and the
series for the Tribe.
