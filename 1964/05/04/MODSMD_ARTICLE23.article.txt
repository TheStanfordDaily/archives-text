# Moral Re-Armament: Emotionalism, Generalities
## Editorial 
### 
We ran a big display advertisement Fri
day.
It was from Moral lie-Armament, an or
ganization that w ants to "rebuild the modern
world"' through "absolute moral standards."
'L'lie Daily lias nothing against rebuilding
modern worlds, mind you.
WE WERE surprised, however, to find
that this ad was actually aimed at a college
audience. And, even worse, that it was writ
ten by college students.
An excerpt: "We are in revolt against the
gutlessness of 'good' Americans . . . who sit
silently while one woman forces God out of
our schools, who permit men committed to
atheism and anti-God to proceed unchecked."

First, we believe that, since God is u su
preme being, it would lie a monumental task
for one mere human — even a woman — to
force Him out of any place against His will.
BUT THIS ASIDE, we recommend that
the ad's author read the Supreme Court de
cision on school prayers and then the article
in the Constitution providing for the separa
tion of church and state.
We were also a bit disturbed at the ad's
admonishment of those who permit atheists
to go "unchecked." The latter word has an
ugly ring to it — so ugly that we recommend
the author read the first amendment to the
Constitution. Twice.
There was one point we agreed whole
hearted Iv with — the. author's disdain for those

"who proclaim one set of standards and live
another."
But, unfortunately, that applies to the au
thor himself, who in the next few lines had
tlio gall to urge making "freedom a reality
again." Except for atheists, evidently.
Even the very name of the organization
is an interesting contradiction: Moral He-
Armament.
But that's not all. MHA officials have told
this newspaper that they welcome atheists
as members, as long as they are "morally up

light.' Yet the ad clearly states that in MRA's
ideal stage one must "he governed by God."
For a world movement, which it claims to
he, MHA seems remarkably parochial. Its ad
states: "Wo know that if America fails, the
world fails."
I HERE'S A BIT of anti-intelleetualism,
too. Professors, among others, are blamed for
[forcing] down our throats ' the "new moral
ity."
And there are the glittering generalities,
(e.g., "absolute moral standards," "stand up
for what is right in the country," "the captive
world looks to us to make freedom a realit\
again," "take humanity forward").
MR A might be a worthwhile organization.
Certainly few can dispute such a noble uoal

as peace. Or bettering humanity.
BUT PEOPLE have espoused this for a
long time, and some of them have been pretty
insincere. Take, for example, Hitler and Sta
lin.
History has demonstrated to us all too
painfully the danger ol swallowing nice,
broad, meaningless declarations.
That's why we're tired of such nonsense
in the MHA ad. If this organization wants to
convince us, it had better do so with some
rational arguments.
It had better tell us about its goals — in
detail — and about the means for attaining
them — in detail.
And without the emotionalism and bla
tant generalities, thank vou.
