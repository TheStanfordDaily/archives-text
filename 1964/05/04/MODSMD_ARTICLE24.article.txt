## Rocky, Lodge: Divided We Fall To Goldwater 
### Stephen Shefler 
With tlif California Presidential Primary less than a month
away, political observers are beginning to ask can Goldwater be
stopped. Joe Martin of the Rockefeller camp has stated, "if Gold
water were to w in in California, there would be no stopping the
Goldwater movement." More astute political observers such as
Time, Newsweek, and The National Observer do not concur with
Mr. Martin s estimation.
The most recent California Poll, shows that Goldwater has tak
en the lead from New York's Governor.
THE PRIME SOURCE of Gold water's recent strength is apathy
(in the part of liberal Republicans opposed by dedication and or
ganization in the Goldwater camp. The apathy on the part of the
liberal Republicans stems from the fact that Rockefeller has gener
ated little enthusiasm for his candidacy.
\\ hile, as has been clearly shown by national polls, the vast
majority of Republicans oppose Mr. Goldwater, they do not like
rockefeller either. The liberal Republican sentiment rests with
Lodge, Nixon, and Scranton, but they are not candidates.
The supporters of those Presidential possibilities, not entered in
the California Primary, rather than supporting Rockefeller to whom
they are more philosophically inclined have been sitting on the
fence hoping that these two gentlemen will kill one another off.
But while Rockefeller at this point is all but dead, Goldwater is
very much alive. The result of the stand aside attitude by those in
the Nixon, Lodge and Scranton camps has been apathy on the part
of those Republicans who support these candidates. As a result,
many of these indiviluals have decided to stay away from the polls,
rather than vote in a contest where neither candidate is appealing.
A further result is that many potential campaign workers for
the Rockefeller camp are staying home rather than going to work
for Rockefeller.
WHILE THE ROCKEFELLER forces are insufficiently staffed
and financed, the Goldwater forces are well staffed and financed.
\s James Reston said last week the Goldwater followers are mili
tant and dedicated. The organizational apparatus is both thorough
and efficient; the Goldwater people; are calling all registered Re
publicans.
All this is rather discouraging to the liberal Republicans and
moderates in general, but the political winds seem to be changing.
The Lodge forces are making overtures with the Rockefeller fol
lowers for a united effort.
It the Lodge forces can be effectively mobilized, Goldwater will
be most surely defeated. The Rockefeller forces while initially hes
itant now seem to realize only by a united effort will the Republi
can Party be kept out of the hands of irresponsible reactionary lead
ership.
The question remains can the Lodge forces be mobilized to work
lor Rockefeller or merely to vote for him. Many political pros feel
that it is now the time for Lodge to come out of hiding and start
fighting.
