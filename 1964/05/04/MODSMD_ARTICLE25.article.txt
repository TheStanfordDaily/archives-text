Editor, The Daily:
A point of conflict with his
| Fred Hawley's] hypothesis
that "Classes and Class Obliga
tions do not exist," appears as
the nature of our society, not
the social order unique to any
particular go v e r n me nt or
state, but merely the institu
tion of men living together.
1 FULLY RESPECT the doc
trine of freedom of action, but
with a firm realization of the
interdependency of social ac
tion, I could not advocate it. not
the freedom of action that Mr.
Hawley professes. Such a free
dom is a repudiation not mere
ly of the existing order, but of
all orders of men living to
gether anywhere and at any
time.
Yes. the individual is defin
itely "so good that man should
not degrade it for the sake of
leeches." But he <1 prefer the
use of "he" to the use of "it"
when speaking of the individ
ual) is also so good that we
should respect him. and active
ly support him if we feel that
we should. In this way I re
spect Mr. Hawley.
YES' IT IS convenient that
Mr. Hawley should draw his
lines too; we all do. And lines,
once drawn, make all things
much simpler, much easier
all things, that is, except in
dividualism. Whether society
draws a line, or the individual
draws a line, it is one and the
same.
Taking the line too seriously,
too absolutely, that is the real
denial of independence. Do you
have enough faith in individual
ism to be willing to subject it
to the rigors of personal rela
tions? Of living together with
other people? Then and only
then does individualism become
more than flag wavi n g,
speeches, and brash acts. Then
individualism might become a
philosophy.
But as long as it is "branded"
by such people as Mr. Hawley
(who neatly defines it while de

crying those who would do
likewise), then it is much,
much less than a philosophy.

• Freedom
Editor, The Daily:
800, hoo, and hoo for those
young ladies who were scan
dalized by the daring sugges
tion of Fred Hawley (April 281
that not every white in this
world is responsible. for 1 h e
miseries of every black, that
innocent bystanders are indeed
innocent, and lhat the tough
nosed individualism that built
this country is still respectable
in a culture now so degenerate
ihal naive, college-age, s e 1 f
s I y 1 e d love-mongers have
nothing better to do with their
idle time than malign the phil
osophy that pays for what they
squander.
IF HAWLEY lets his mother
be shot, as Ingrid Jacobsen
(April 30) proposes, then sure
enough he's a rotten ingrate of
a son and an all-around baddy.
But the fact is, that while good
ness and brother-keeping are
everywhere admired, they are
nowhere required of men in
a non-theocratic society; what
is required is that every man
be guaranteed the right to be
a saint or a bastard as he damn
well pleases —and that applies
even to such a matter of pub
lic concern as selling the house
his money, earned by the sweat
of his brow, went to pay for.
If the Negroes are in such a
sorry situation that special
legislation, overtly designed to
prop them up to a level of
equality with the rest of the
community by abridging the
traditional lights of property
owners, is required (and I re
fuse to think that the Negroes
I know are in such a state)

then let this legislation bo
known for what it is: no pre
server of liberty or human dig
nity, but a crutch for people
too backward to take care of
themselves.

• Absolute Rights
ICriitnr, The Daily:
I challenge, not the concept
of individual liberty, in which
1 believe mosl highly, but the
use Mr. Hawley makes of this
concept. The basic points on
which we disagree are the ques
tions of how absolute these
rights are absolute it would be
shall be extended. The answer
id the first in pari determines
the answer to Ihe second. If
right are absolute it would be
hard to extend them to all be
cause at) solute individual
lights would include the right
to limit the rights of others.
Mr. Hawley supports this
absolute conception of rights.
RIGHTS are absolute, but
they are obviously limited to
a certain portion of society
those who hold property. Mr.
Hawley implies that these
rights include the right to dis
c rimi nat e. Discrimination
limits the rights of the Negro.
He may live. buy. and work
only where the owners of prop
erty permit.
I feel that the level of in
dividual freedom in a society
must be measured by the free
dom of those who have Ihe
least amount of it. A limita
tion on the absolute freedom
of property increases the free
dom of those who own no prop
erty and thus increases th e
level in the society.
To be true freedom, it must
extend to all. A dictatorship is
not free merely because the
ruler is free, and America is
not free merely because busi
nessmen are free.
