## Secretariat Separates Presidential Candidates 
### Justin Beck 
'I lie Civil Rights Secretariat, sponsor of the Civil lights Con
f ere nee, April 23-25, is currently under (ire in the ASSU Presidential
j race.
Scott Mcl-Jri.de, one ol the candidates ven much in the running,
stated I hursday night in a debate with |ohn Uryson, that he felt
the Secretariat was "inappropriately established."
Uryson, on the other hand, is highly sympathetic toward stu
dent government involvement in such ventures, and has said that
j lie favors making it an independent body within the ASSU, and, in
the process, expanding its duties.
1 HE SECRETARIAT WAS established last quarter as a part
| oi the President s office. At the time, Student Body President Hud
; Wedin felt that if the Secretariat proved successful, and if there
; was w ide enough student interest, it could be made into a perman
j cut organization ol the type now advocated bv Brvson.
Mcßrides principle argument against the Secretariat is not
! that there is no student interest in it or that the Secretariat has not
been successful, but that civil rights is a partisan issue, on which
| ASSU organizations cannot speak, and that student government
| should be more concerned with events directly affecting the campus.
\\ hen \\ edin first proposed the Secretariat, or rather told LASSU
I that he had established one and needed money for it, the spectre
ol KPFA and Annul Rosencranz immediately came to the minds of
the Legislature, whose memories, like their debates, are often fright
fully long.
Rosencranz, W edins predecessor, sent a letter to Senator Dodd
expressing "graveconcern" over a delay in renewing KPFAs broad
casting license. LASSU passed three resolutions on the matter, sup
porting the right of students to speak out on public issues, support
ing Rosencranz, and expressing some concern of their own on KPFA.
j Dean Winbigler, speaking for the President of the University, op
posed the action ol the Legislature in speaking out on a public issue
and, to put it mildly, the resulting conflict was a very messy affair.
HOWEVER, WEDIN stilled legislative fears by assuring that
the Secretariat was non-partisan and merely an information agency,
providing information to segregationists and civil lighters alike,
making it about as partisan as the Associated Press.
Of course it hasn't worked out that way, because ven few seg
regationists have volunteered to work for it, and few er vet have been
providing information to distribute. That absence of half the civil
rights argument has left the Secretariat clearly standing as a pro
civil rights both'.
In effect then, by making the Secretariat a regular organ of stu
dent government, ASSU would be taking a stand on civil rights.
Whether or not the student body feels that it can or should make
that stand is one of the questions that this election may in part
determine, and in determining, direct the course of student govern
ment in the coming year.

Rosencranz, W edins predecessor, sent a letter to Senator Dodd
expressing "graveconcern" over a delay in renewing KPFAs broad
casting license. LASSU passed three resolutions on the matter, sup
porting the right of students to speak out on public issues, support
ing Rosencranz, and expressing some concern of their own on KPFA.
j Dean Winbigler, speaking for the President of the University, op
posed the action ol the Legislature in speaking out on a public issue
and, to put it mildly, the resulting conflict was a very messy affair.
HOWEVER, WEDIN stilled legislative fears by assuring that
the Secretariat was non-partisan and merely an information agency,
providing information to segregationists and civil lighters alike,
making it about as partisan as the Associated Press.
Of course it hasn't worked out that way, because ven few seg
regationists have volunteered to work for it, and few er vet have been
providing information to distribute. That absence of half the civil
rights argument has left the Secretariat clearly standing as a pro
civil rights both'.
In effect then, by making the Secretariat a regular organ of stu
dent government, ASSU would be taking a stand on civil rights.
Whether or not the student body feels that it can or should make
that stand is one of the questions that this election may in part
determine, and in determining, direct the course of student govern
ment in the coming year.

stated I hursday night in a debate with |ohn Uryson, that he felt
the Secretariat was "inappropriately established."
Uryson, on the other hand, is highly sympathetic toward stu

the process, expanding its duties.

Mcßrides principle argument against the Secretariat is not

been successful, but that civil rights is a partisan issue, on which
