### 
One of the lour candidates for ASSU president, Edgar Kaiser,
charged The Daily with "stressing what it wants to stress, covering
and ignoring what it chooses to" in a statement to be printed tomor
row.
lie staled. however th;il these ehnrws did net nerhiiti hi The

Daily's coverage of the present
campaign but rather to the
paper's general policy over the
past few years. All the same, he
would not agree to make this ex
plicit in his statement.
TIIE CANDIDATE did make it

[clear <hat lie was not accusing
the paper of "blacking out" his
campaign.
One reporter approached him
on at least three occasions but
was never granted an interview.
, After agreeing twice to answer a
few questions concerning his or
ganization and campaign p 1 a n s,
Kaiser changed his mind and said.
! "I am not ready to make a state
' mcnt at this time."
AS YET, he has offered no ex
planation for his refusal to co
operate with The Daily although
; he did say, "I am not running a
typical campaign."
kaiser's atypical campaign has
also included a kind of seclusion.
The candidate did not appear for
any of his scheduled engagements
last week. He failed to attend the
| organizational meeting for (lie
I candidates last Tuesday, and he
declined an invitation to speak on
KZSU radio Wednesday night. In
| addition, he did not show up for
: a scheduled debate Thursday eve
j ning in Branncr, although he sent
a message expressing his regrets
for not being able to attend.
DESPITE his "not typical" cam
I paign he emphasized. "I am not
i running an R.F. campaign." On e
| candidate commented, "I am con
vinced that he (Kaiser) would not
i win by running a typical cam*
I paign."
