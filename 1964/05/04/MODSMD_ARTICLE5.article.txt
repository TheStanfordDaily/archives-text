# Gruber's GRIPE
## 
### 
(Second of a series on the po
litical strategy, background and
platform of the ASSU presidential
candidates.)
Steve Gruber is the only sopho
j more in the presidential race. Ho
is also the only candidate missing
a well-oiled, smoothly functioning
i machine behind him. His platform
is called GRIPE (Gruber's Revul
; sion at Inane Political Efforts),
j and his slogan is "I will not serve
unless elected."
I His platform can hardly lie
i called a "me too" program. Ho
j plans to abolish LASSU, replac
! ing it with mass meetings in the
Stadium. "Direct democracy is
our only hope," said Gruber.
EXAMINATION of Stanford's
I grading system is another main
j point in his program. "I feel that
) it is up to the individual profes
sor to devise a fairer grading sys
tem. Otherwise, reprisals should
be taken against him, preferably
by the Stanford Area Minute
j men," said Gruber.
! Encouragement of student pub
lication ventures is necessary, ac
cording to Gruber. "We should
buy an offset duplicator printing
press in order to preserve the

gross comments at the flicks."
Gruber also thinks that it will
be necessary to liberalize the meal
exchange system. "For example,
we could print a small picture of
Karl Marx on each meal ticket,"
suggested Gruber.
ENCOURAGEMENT of interest
in areas of social concern is also
important to Gruber. "I feel that
we should initiate student ex
change programs with some of
the more backward universities in
the United States," commented
Gruber. "We could start with
Berkeley."
Gruber says that he will appeal
to the many students who have
heard the other candidates' plat
forms and have experienced a
feeling of intense disinterest. He
also advises his supporters to
write in his name for off-campus
LASSU representative in the
event that he does not win the
presidency.
Gruber plans to speak on the
first floor of the stacks in the
Main Library today at 4:2(1
p.m. His topic w i 11 be "Sex."
After the speech there will bo a
$2.") a plate dinner at 104.1 Laurel
St. in Menlo Park.

a well-oiled, smoothly functioning
i machine behind him. His platform
is called GRIPE (Gruber's Revul
; sion at Inane Political Efforts),
j and his slogan is "I will not serve
unless elected."
I His platform can hardly lie
i called a "me too" program. Ho
j plans to abolish LASSU, replac
! ing it with mass meetings in the
Stadium. "Direct democracy is
our only hope," said Gruber.
EXAMINATION of Stanford's
I grading system is another main
j point in his program. "I feel that
) it is up to the individual profes
sor to devise a fairer grading sys
tem. Otherwise, reprisals should
be taken against him, preferably
by the Stanford Area Minute
j men," said Gruber.
! Encouragement of student pub
lication ventures is necessary, ac
cording to Gruber. "We should
buy an offset duplicator printing
press in order to preserve the

gross comments at the flicks."
Gruber also thinks that it will
be necessary to liberalize the meal
exchange system. "For example,
we could print a small picture of
Karl Marx on each meal ticket,"
suggested Gruber.
ENCOURAGEMENT of interest
in areas of social concern is also
important to Gruber. "I feel that
we should initiate student ex
change programs with some of
the more backward universities in
the United States," commented
Gruber. "We could start with
Berkeley."
Gruber says that he will appeal
to the many students who have
heard the other candidates' plat
forms and have experienced a
feeling of intense disinterest. He
also advises his supporters to
write in his name for off-campus
LASSU representative in the
event that he does not win the
presidency.
Gruber plans to speak on the
first floor of the stacks in the
Main Library today at 4:2(1
p.m. His topic w i 11 be "Sex."
After the speech there will bo a
$2.") a plate dinner at 104.1 Laurel
St. in Menlo Park.
