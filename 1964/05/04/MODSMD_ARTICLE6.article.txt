# Military Threatens Civil Rights Movement
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Editorial Director 
The Civil Rights movement was within striking
distance of a breakthrough for the first time a few
months ago, but that position has since been endan
gered by militant tactics.
The observation came from Allard K. Lowen
stcin - lawyer, teacher, and civil rights leader
in a Tresidder speech Friday afternoon.
Professor Lowenstein thinks the course of civil
rights has moved in the wrong direction this year;
"there is increased frustration among Negroes and
greater resent fulness in Whites. A great, chasm
is developing because of the lack of communica
tion.
While he feels civil disobedience is tactically
stupid, Lowenstein urges that it is to be seen in
the perspective of increased frustration. "The
Whites have not responded fast enough to the Ne
gro demand for justice."
HE LIKENED the Negroe's position to that of
occupants of Hell: they have nothing but they can
see all around them those who have everything.
Why has the great push for civil rights come
at this time? "The Negro now has an awareness
that poverty is neither universal nor necessary.
And he is incensed at the failure of the White
community to respond to his demands for equal
ity-"
The Negro feels compelled to step up the pace
of progress by using militant tactics. This change
in attitude reflects a possible shift in the Negro

leadership. Men like Roy Wilkins who were only
a few years ago considered radicals — are now
moving too slowly for many Negroes.
BUT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, such as the stall
ins. is helpful in contrasting the White inconveni
ence of a few hours with the century-long oppres
sion of the Negro. "The greatest stall-in of history
is the Southern senators' use of the filibuster to
prevent civil rights legislation."
Lowenstein expressed the optimistic hope that
"disobedience and indifference both would go if
people of goodwill on both sides are brought to
gether. Now, as never before, is the time for people
with residual goodwill to move in." This means
churches and schools, among others.
The Stanford work in Mississippi last fall was
cited as changing the nature of the civil rights
issue. "There is now hope felt in the Negro com
munity. They feel gratitude and indebtedness to
Stanford."
MISSISSIPPI, last year called a "national wild
erness area," has become "part of our conscious
ness and life." The nation, too. lias become part of
the White Southerner's consciousness; violence di
minishes, according to Lowenstein, when the South
knows that the whole nation is watching.
Stanford can assist Mississippi in two ways, re
lated Lowenstein. The Negroes there cannot vote,
picket or march. They can do nothing short of vio
lence to help themselves. Stanford can provide
assistance from the outside. It can also help de
velop the needed outside awareness.

ness and life." The nation, too. lias become part of
the White Southerner's consciousness; violence di
minishes, according to Lowenstein, when the South
knows that the whole nation is watching.
Stanford can assist Mississippi in two ways, re
lated Lowenstein. The Negroes there cannot vote,
picket or march. They can do nothing short of vio
lence to help themselves. Stanford can provide
assistance from the outside. It can also help de
velop the needed outside awareness.
The Civil Rights movement was within striking
distance of a breakthrough for the first time a few
months ago, but that position has since been endan
gered by militant tactics.
The observation came from Allard K. Lowen
stcin - lawyer, teacher, and civil rights leader
in a Tresidder speech Friday afternoon.
Professor Lowenstein thinks the course of civil
rights has moved in the wrong direction this year;
"there is increased frustration among Negroes and
greater resent fulness in Whites. A great, chasm
is developing because of the lack of communica
tion.
While he feels civil disobedience is tactically
stupid, Lowenstein urges that it is to be seen in
the perspective of increased frustration. "The
Whites have not responded fast enough to the Ne
gro demand for justice."
HE LIKENED the Negroe's position to that of
occupants of Hell: they have nothing but they can
see all around them those who have everything.
Why has the great push for civil rights come
at this time? "The Negro now has an awareness
that poverty is neither universal nor necessary.
And he is incensed at the failure of the White
community to respond to his demands for equal
ity-"
The Negro feels compelled to step up the pace
of progress by using militant tactics. This change
in attitude reflects a possible shift in the Negro

leadership. Men like Roy Wilkins who were only
a few years ago considered radicals — are now
moving too slowly for many Negroes.
BUT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, such as the stall
ins. is helpful in contrasting the White inconveni
ence of a few hours with the century-long oppres
sion of the Negro. "The greatest stall-in of history
is the Southern senators' use of the filibuster to
prevent civil rights legislation."
Lowenstein expressed the optimistic hope that
"disobedience and indifference both would go if
people of goodwill on both sides are brought to
gether. Now, as never before, is the time for people
with residual goodwill to move in." This means
churches and schools, among others.
The Stanford work in Mississippi last fall was
cited as changing the nature of the civil rights
issue. "There is now hope felt in the Negro com
munity. They feel gratitude and indebtedness to
Stanford."
MISSISSIPPI, last year called a "national wild
erness area," has become "part of our conscious
ness and life." The nation, too. lias become part of
the White Southerner's consciousness; violence di
minishes, according to Lowenstein, when the South
