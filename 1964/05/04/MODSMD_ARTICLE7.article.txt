## Czech Students Riot In Prague 
### MICHAEL ROSTER 
Friday's May Day riot in Prague, Czechoslovakia reportedly
involving nearly 3,000 students came as a surprise to a number
of Stanford students who hav(> visited the country.
Approximately 15 months ago students at the Stanford-in-Ger
many campus had traveled Ihrough Czechoslovakia and spent two
days in Prague. The Daily spoke with several of I hem and asked
their general impressions of conditions in Prague at that time.
ACCORDING to Gary Messinger, most of the Czech students with
whom he spoke supported the present government. However, Mes
singer emphasized, students who might oppose the government can
not be too vocal without endangering their own liberties.
"Many of the students," continued Messinger, "said they were
pro-government because conditions were better than they used to
be." In general, the people did not want any blood-shed and were
thus willing to sacrifice some of their freedoms just to keep peace.
The student uprising last Friday is one of several within the past
few years. Messinger pointed out that student organizations in Eu
rope have had traditional histories of significant student activism
far more so than in the United States.
DON IH si;, another Stanford student who had toured Prague,
guessed thai one possible explanation for this latest uprising was

llie slow progro.sK presently being made in Czechoslovakia. Govern
ments in nearby Poland and Hungary have far more liberal policies,
and are thus making more rapid advancement culturally and eco
nomically.
There are also many African students studying at Charles Uni
versity. the major university in Prague. "I wouldn't be surprised if
these African students were taking a basic part." Huso stated.
According to Mcssinger, however, foreign students at Prague
receive exceptionally lucrative scholarships with liberal allowances
for spending money. It would therefore be doubtful, he said, that
these visiting students would actively engage in Friday's demonstra
tions.
TIIE (IENKKAL impressions of Stanford students weit? quite
varied since they had met with people under different conditions.
Anne Muller, for example, had stayed with a professor who had won
the Nobel prize.
The professor's son was treated quite well by the government and
was even allowed to leave the country to study at Cambridge. The
son was thus generally satisfied with present conditions.
Students who might be opposed to the regime and might have
been a part of the May Day protest remain in special areas of the
city. Stanford students thus didn't have the chance t<Â» meet with
these people.
