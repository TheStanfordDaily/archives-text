# Discussion Continues In Morse Controversy
## ACLU Waits For Dean; KZSU Analyzes Decisions 
### 
Ernest Besig, of the American Civil Liberties Union, said there
are two prerequisites necessary before the ACLU can support court
action for Frank Morse. The Stanford administration must be al
lowed a "reasonable amount of time" to respond to a letter sent by
ACLU and Frank Morse must request ACLU support.
To date, neither of these pre-*

requisites has been fulfilled.
C'AMI'IJS discussion continues.
A KZSU editorial commentary,
consisting of taped statements of
men involved and moderated by
a commentator, was aired last
Thursday.
The program stated that Dr.
Frulla's recommendation to ex
pell Morse had been strongly in
fluenced by his emotional state.
Frulla's communication of his de
cision as well as his decision itself
were made in the heat of emotion.
This viewpoint was first sup
ported by a number of students
expressing the opinion that Frul
la had, in the past, become ex
tremely excited by incidents of
minor property damage.
THE STATION also demon
strated that Frulla began the
quarter with an unsolved crime on
his hands, a broken bar room door
left by group six. The pattern was
familiar. At the end of previous
quarters, a chair had been thrown
through a greenhouse and a sink
ripped partially from the wall.
As the third support the sta
tion examined Frulla's behavior
in an earlier suspension case, in
group six. Here the student coun
cil rendered as heavy a verdict as
possible s ho r t of suspension.
Frulla advised council members to
reconsider the case on the grounds
that all four faculty members had
agreed that suspension was called.
THE COUNCIL, feeling that
they had let the faculty down, re
considered the case and asked for
suspension, only to have it later
revealed that one of the faculty
had not been in favor of suspen
sion and had made his feelings ex
plicit. Thus the program estab

| lished a precedent for Frulla's be
j havior of stating that "all agree"
when in fact all do not agree.
The station then offered two
possible interpretations: either
there has been some type of ir
regular practice on a conscious
level, or that there is little choice
but to acept that the behavior was
strongly motivated by an emo
tional state that precluded a poll
ing of all members of the faculty
review council.
Although the station does
recognize that academic proce
dure often demands a unified
front, an explicit statement which
is not true must not be taken
lightly if the judicial process is
to be valid.
THE PROGRAM left Frulla
j with an expression of unhappi
[ ness that reticence on the part
I of home offices made necessary
! the focus on Frulla and his ra
j tionale in judicial matters.
The hope was expressed that
j more students in Italy would
i make t ho effort to know Frulla
i in the academic situation. "For we
j have found that those that criti
! eize him most strongly know him
least."
The decision by the dean's of
fice was called in question by the
station stating that the wrong fac
tors were stressed. Frulla's letter,
the station feels, was given too
much weight in that ii was less
than a calm, considered viewpoint
representing the opinion of f o u r
men.
TIIK STATION also felt that
too much stress was placed on
"psychological factors" by those
not qualified to interpret them.
Great concern was expressed that
University offices had made no at
tempt to check into these deeply,
and thus Morse felt the need to
seek a psychiatric examination on
his own.
This appears inconsistent, said
the broadcast, with the policy of
protecting students, offered as the
reason for silence on the part of
authorities who made t he decision.
I THE STATION concluded by
I emphasizing that the most alarm
ing aspect of the Morse case is the
lack of communication which has
resulted in much pettiness by most
persons involved, and which has
| made the judicial system quite in
| flexible and far from explicit in the
I academic context.

A KZSU editorial commentary,
consisting of taped statements of
men involved and moderated by
a commentator, was aired last
Thursday.
The program stated that Dr.
Frulla's recommendation to ex
pell Morse had been strongly in
fluenced by his emotional state.
Frulla's communication of his de
cision as well as his decision itself
were made in the heat of emotion.
This viewpoint was first sup
ported by a number of students
expressing the opinion that Frul
la had, in the past, become ex
tremely excited by incidents of
minor property damage.
THE STATION also demon
strated that Frulla began the
quarter with an unsolved crime on
his hands, a broken bar room door
left by group six. The pattern was
familiar. At the end of previous
quarters, a chair had been thrown
through a greenhouse and a sink
ripped partially from the wall.
As the third support the sta
tion examined Frulla's behavior
in an earlier suspension case, in
group six. Here the student coun
cil rendered as heavy a verdict as
possible s ho r t of suspension.
Frulla advised council members to
reconsider the case on the grounds
that all four faculty members had
agreed that suspension was called.
THE COUNCIL, feeling that
they had let the faculty down, re
considered the case and asked for
suspension, only to have it later
revealed that one of the faculty
had not been in favor of suspen
sion and had made his feelings ex
plicit. Thus the program estab

| lished a precedent for Frulla's be
j havior of stating that "all agree"
when in fact all do not agree.
The station then offered two
possible interpretations: either
there has been some type of ir
regular practice on a conscious
level, or that there is little choice
but to acept that the behavior was
strongly motivated by an emo
tional state that precluded a poll
ing of all members of the faculty
review council.
Although the station does
recognize that academic proce
dure often demands a unified
front, an explicit statement which
is not true must not be taken
lightly if the judicial process is
to be valid.
THE PROGRAM left Frulla
j with an expression of unhappi
[ ness that reticence on the part
I of home offices made necessary
! the focus on Frulla and his ra
j tionale in judicial matters.
The hope was expressed that
j more students in Italy would
i make t ho effort to know Frulla
i in the academic situation. "For we
j have found that those that criti
! eize him most strongly know him
least."
The decision by the dean's of
fice was called in question by the
station stating that the wrong fac
tors were stressed. Frulla's letter,
the station feels, was given too
much weight in that ii was less
than a calm, considered viewpoint
representing the opinion of f o u r
men.
TIIK STATION also felt that
too much stress was placed on
"psychological factors" by those
not qualified to interpret them.
Great concern was expressed that
University offices had made no at
tempt to check into these deeply,
and thus Morse felt the need to
seek a psychiatric examination on
his own.
This appears inconsistent, said
the broadcast, with the policy of
protecting students, offered as the
reason for silence on the part of
authorities who made t he decision.
