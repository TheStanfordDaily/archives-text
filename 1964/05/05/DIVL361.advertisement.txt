THE WAY TO PRAY
"... men ought always to pray and not to faint." (Luke 18.1)
Man was designed by His Creator for fellowship with Him. God is the
source of all life and truth and to live independently from God is to be
energized by powers of darkness and confusion. Infected so completely by
sin, man by nature prefers the darkness and hesitates to come to the light
to seek the strength and help of God. Yet God is all-sufficient and anxious
to impart to us His strength and power, if man will not come to Him in
prayer. Prayer does not come naturally and must be cultivated as a habitual
communion with God which eventually becomes nearly unbroken and con
tinuous throughout the day. As a result, the individual is drawn very close
to God and can experience His immediate strength and help. The alternative
to prayer is "fainting'' which means not only that problems and burdens
mount, but that the believer's life ceases to bear eternal fruit.
Before prayer can work for any individual, it is necessary to be on pray
ing ground with God. The basis of prayer is established when any person
recognizes and acknowledges that Jesus Christ died on his behalf:
"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
Our Lord Jesus Christ: By whom also we have access by faith into this grace
wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God." (Romans
5:1, 2)
In prayer the Christian does not seek to change God, but to be drawn
into accord with His will and plan.
Prayer properly begins with worship of God, confession of sin, and rec
ognition of Christ as Lord and Saviour. Prayer should be addressed to God,
Whose plans and purposes are carried out according to His sovereignity
and unfailing goodness. Prayer is to be in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ, Whose perfect sacrifice for sin has bridged the gulf between God
and man:
"For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man
Christ Jesus, Who gave Himself as ransom for all , . ." (I Timothy 2:5, 6)
As High Priest, Jesus Christ actively intercedes on behalf of believers
when they pray:
"Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the
heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have
not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities;
but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore
come boldly unto the throng of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find
grace to help in time of need." (Hebrews 4:15-16)
The Holy Spirit, Who resides in the bodies of all believers, also plays a
vital role in prayer:
"Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what
we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for
us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts
knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for
the saints according to the will of God." (Romans 8:26-27)
Prayer knows no bounds, for God Himself enters into the prayers of all
Christians, making the bodies of all his children His prayer room in which
Father, Son and Holy Ghost work together to accomplish all that God desires
and purposes to do.
It is not God Who is limited or unable, but men who are unwilling to
commit everything to God in prayer. The life of any Christian is only as vic
torious and successful as the believer is willing to let God make it. Try
proyer and sec for yourself.
