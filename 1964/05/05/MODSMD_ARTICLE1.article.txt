• Cyprus: A Military Hasv?
MOSCOW — Premier Khrushchev charged
yesterday that the Atlantic Alliance "war
bloc" was trying to convert Cyprus into an un
sinkable aircraft carrier, lie said his govern
ment opposes all foreign interference in the
affairs of the troubled island.
At the same time, the Communist party
newspaper Pravda said the United States,
Britain and their allies want Cyprus as a nu
clear rocket base. It accused Britain of ham
stringing the U.N. peace force now trying to
end the Greek-Turkish Cyprus fighting.
Khrushchev's words apparently were aimed
primarily at Britain, which has military bases
in the former colony, and the United States,
which supports British and U.N. efforts to end
the bloodshed.
The Soviet Union has supported the posi
tion of President Markarios, a Greek Cypriot,
who wants to erase the Turkish Cypriot minor

ity's rights of veto over important legislation.

SACRAMENTO — The Senate Elections
Committee killed yesterday a bill to allow
Democratic U.S. Sen. Clair Engle to withdraw
his name from the June 2 primary ballot.
Sen. Edwin J. Regan, D-Weaverville, ad
mitted his measure was dead after no mem
ber of the committee would make any kind of
motion on it.
Backed by Gov. Brown, the bill as amended
would have let Engle, by a written request,

take his name oil the Democratic senatorial
primary ballot.
The first-term senator, voeuperating from
two brain operations, withdrew from the race
lor re-nomination last week. The action, how
ever. came too late to remove his name from
the seven million ballots under current law.
Since Engle's name is first on the ballot,
it was expected by many he would draw a
sizeable vote, even after his withdrawal.
