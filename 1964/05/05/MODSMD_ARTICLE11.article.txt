## 
### 
The Palo Alto-Stanford Hos
pital's board of directors, on a
split vote, has defeated a propo
sal to abolish cigarette vending
machines from its premises. The
I hospital's medical board had
made the original proposal, also
on a split vote.
The medical board had said
I nothing about the sale of cigar
ettes in the hospital gift shop,
| however, the distinction being
I based partly on the availability of
cigarettes to minors. Some of the
j staff had been concerned about
candy stripers (young girls work
ing as hospital help) using the
I machines, as it is easier for the
girls to purchase cigarettes from
; the machines than from the shop.
A member of the board of di
rectors argued against this rea
soning by stating that Prohibition
had not done much good, a n d
that banning the vending ma
chines Would be similarly ineffec
tive. Another board of directors
| member insisted that cigarettes
bo banned completely, or not at
all, from the entire hospital, and
an amendment was added to tin 4
proposal to this effect. It was in
this final form that the proposal
was defeated in a split vote by
the board of directors.
One of the ideas that was
brought up in making the deci
sion was that cigarettes often aie

! an "absolute necessity" in reliev
ing the tension of fathers-to-be
or persons worrying over sick
! relatives.
Argument in support of the
proposal was 1 hat people smok
; ing in the patients' rooms are a
1 definite nuisance to the patients
themselves.
