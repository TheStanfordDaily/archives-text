# Frosh Baseballers Split Pair

### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The Stanford Frosh baseball;
team had a rough time of it last I
weekend. Friday they had to go !
i an extra inning to edge past Wil- j
low Glen High School. Saturday
j they suffered their second defeat 1

of the season to the Cal frosh.
The score was 2-1 in favor of
Stanford Friday. Cal out scored
the Frosh 6-3 the next day.
Starter Stan Smith no-hit Wil
low Glen for six innings in the
first game. He tired in the sev
enth, when Willow Glen scored its
only run. Kent Borchard came in
and restored order, but he had
some trouble of his own in the
next frame. Jim Blaschke came
in, threw one pitch which was
turned into a double play, and re
turned to the bench. Blaschke
got cirdit for the win running his
record to 6-0.
In the bottom of the eighth (it
was a seven inning game) Ottmar,
Hovley, and Spence walked with
no outs. Then on an attempted
squeeze play the catcher dropped
the ball after the batter had
missed the bunt and the winning
run scored.
Seven stolen bases and numer
ous errors told the story of the
Cal game. The Cal players stole
on almost every opportunity.
Whether Cal forced Stanford into
the many miscues or whether Cal
was just at the right place at the
right time is a moot point.
