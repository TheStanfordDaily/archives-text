The Stanford Women's Recrea-
I tion. Association has potential not
'yet sufficiently realized. It is my
objective to create, through im
ginative development and applica
tion of that potential, a new VVRA
—an effective, unified organiza
tion that IS an organization—able
i to serve not just the highly skilled
! individual, but the Stanford femi
nine community as a whole.
