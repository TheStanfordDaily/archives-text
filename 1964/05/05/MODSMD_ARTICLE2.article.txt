# Backstage: ‘Guys And Dolls’
## 
### BOB CON 
The spirit backstage before the opening night
performance of "Guys and Dolls" Saturday was
akin to that of opening nights in countless thea
ters across the nation a curious combination
of confidence, anxiety and nervous elation.
In the stage area, last-minute preparations
are being made. Stage hands give the floor a
quick mop job. push castor-based scenery sets
into position and balance atop a 30-foot ladder,
arranging overhead lighting.
TEN MINUTES BEFORE curtain time, the
wood-reinforced base of a piece of scenery col
lapses, and inconcealed panic momentarily
dominates, before clutch carpenter work re
stores normality.
In the dressing rooms, a state of mild pande
monium prevails. Performers ransack their
rooms for misplaced costume parts and squat
at long metal tables with adjacent wall mirrors,
applying black cork-base makeup to their faces.
The finished products parade to the Little

Theater for final instructions from directors
Larry Madison and David Quad rone. They run
through some choruses and laugh nervously be
fore scattering to take positions on stage.
DENNIS FALIvS, WHO, in the role of
"Nicely Nicely Johnson," must leap into a man
hole in search of a card game, limps courage
ously down the hall, having hurt his back while
rehearsing his role.
One of the lead actresses, while hurrying to
the stage, remarks that the cough drop con
sumption of the voice-conscious cast has been
high enough to support the Tresidder Union
drugstore
A loudspeaker in the hall begins to announce
The Countdown.
Abrupt silence descends over the entire back
stage area. "All right," whispers Bob Johnson,
one of the crew heads. "This curtain lias got
to fly."
It's 8:39 p.m. and suddenly another open
ing.
