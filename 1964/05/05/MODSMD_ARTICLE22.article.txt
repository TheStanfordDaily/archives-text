# Odegaard Is Candidate For ASSU Vice-President
## 
### 
The Vice President of ASSU is
constitutionally responsible for
the coordination of social activi
ties, a job which is very time con
suming. But in addition 1 believe
that she should be in contact with
the ASSU President's Office and
be ready to cooperate with him
when necessary.
There has been some student
faculty cooperation on the making
of certain policies including the
overnight policy. I would like to
see this type of cooperative effort
extended.
I would like to make available
to students on low budgets more
activities. If 1 am elected I will
look forward to meeting with stu
dents from all over campus.
