In my platform the emphasis is
on tangible benefits to SENIORS.
If I am elected, I will work for
the establishment of activities and
program oriented toward the in
terest of the Senior during the
Senior year and continuing after
graduation. I ask you to give me
the chance and I will do the job.

i The Senior year affords an op
! portunity for productivity and ex
! pression as a class. Achieving this
demands hard work, but there

cusing on specific, traditional ac
j tivities, yet not limited to these
I pledge my efforts to make these
I traditional and new endeavors
