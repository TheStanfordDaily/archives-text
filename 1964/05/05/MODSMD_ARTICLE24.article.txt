As anti-prohibitionist candidate
for Senior Class Vice-President, I
promise to maintain all the tradi
tions perpetrated by those wit h
a true fun-loving spirit.
For a candidate with an active
interest in the affairs of the Sen
ior Class, vote for Phil King for
Vice-President.
Philip King

The Senior Class Vice President
must show responsibility and ini
tiative in coordinating class activi
ties with the Ex-Com. After work
ing on both the Freshman and
Sophomore Ex-Coms I know the
necessity of having an imagina
tive and representative group.
Working with them I would hope
to make our Senior year the best
ever.
