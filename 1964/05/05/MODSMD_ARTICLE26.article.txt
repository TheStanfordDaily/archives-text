The Vice President of Women's
Recreation Association is in
charge of coordinating all the
separate sports and functions. My
goal is to establish for these ac
tivities a unifying aim: this aim
will be the facilitation of initial
interest and involvement for all
women, and particularly for in
coming freshmen.

In addition to serving as fenc
ing manager for two years, I am
assisting the WRA Vice-President
in publishing the WRA Hand
book. 1 propose closer communi
cation between the sport manag
ers and advisors and the women
student body. Through publicity
I will find and encourage those
sports which the majority of
women are interested in.
