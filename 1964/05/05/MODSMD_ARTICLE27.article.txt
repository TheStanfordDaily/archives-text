# Four Vie For ASSU President's Post
## 
### 
I wish to commend I ho present
staff of the Daily for its vigorous
format now featured in this vital
document of student information.
This format is no doubt aided by
the Daily policy of stressing what
it wants to stress, covering and
ignoring whal it chooses to.
For these reasons I have risked
the disfavor of those 1 cannot
journalistically respect instead of
prostituting my personal and
political eonviclions for their sup
port. I find it hard to believe that
a newspaper so aloof to the inter
ests of Stanford students can con
sider itself a power over those
students and exploit that "power"
whenever it wishes.
The other candidates, who have
sought the favor of the Daily have
run typical campaigns and have

I become typical candidates. When
I this happens, someone of tradi
tional caliber is then typically
i elected, and for another year we
I discard hope for progress and
; continue to sow dirt, on the grave
j of a d\ ing dream.
Thus my campaign has been
limited, almost withheld pur
j pose fully, because you cannot
change a system by conforming.
1 have not been a typical cam
| paigner, because 1 will not be a
' typical president. For Stanford
I student government to assume
I meaning or purpose, it must be
[changed. I have committed myself
; to this change before the election,
jto leave no doubts as to what
I kind of president I would he in the
year to come.
lid Kaiser

YVithoul mincing words, I wish
to si alp my important views on
issues lacing our campus:
LASSU: 11 should he abolished,
substituting in its place mass
meetings in the Stadium at which
vital matters would he discussed
in the democratic manner of
Athens.
<oed Housing: This is a matter
which should he left up to ihe in
dividual roommate.
Administration disputes: Lie
ins, march-ins, and vigil-ins are
a tool which has not yet been ex
ploited sufficiently to protest Uni
versity policies. 1 propose imple
menting this technique.
Finances: Here 1 equivocate in
no uncertain terms.
Am I a serious candidate? Can
anyone ho a serious candidate for
this office?
Steve Gruber

The student body president is
in a unique position to infuse stu
dent government with a spirit of
dynamism. In my view, the
ASSU should be a catalyst — an
instigator of new policies; an ac
tive force in coordinating not only
traditional student organizations
and affairs, but inspiring creative
ideas and energetic new pro
grams. The following outlines
several specific proposals for
creating new and worthwhile
areas for student action:
( li A special academic affairs
seminar should be established to
evaluate the 1 present academic
system and possible changes, such
as expansion of honors programs
and examination of the grading
system.
(2» An exchange program with
Negro universities in the South
should bo established and the
election of NSA delegates should
be initiated in order to further
promote student social concern.
l 3) Wider involvement in stu
dent government can be facili
tated by establishing an intern
program, giving interested in
dividuals the opportunity to par
ticipate in a variety of student
organizations on a rotational ba
sis.
(4) The Frank Morse case re
vealed ambiguities and confusion
in the present judicial system. My
platform outlines four specific
statements for insertion into Arti
cle I, Section I of the Constitu
tion, to overcome the weaknesses
in existing judicial procedure.
(5) The IFC, ICC, and lIIC
should have greater autonomy in
determining rush policy.
John 10. Bryson

The primary role of student
government at Stanford should be
lo stimulate student involvement
in the affairs of this campus and
to stimulate discussion and action,
through voluntary groups, on
issues of national and interna
tional concern. Student govern
ment. to achieve these aims, must
not merely solve problems as they
arise, bul experiment in new
areas of student involvement.
LASSU should confine its ac
tivities to campus affairs, while
involvement in issues beyond the
scope of the university should be
handled through voluntary
groups.
The recommendations of fresh
men and sophomores should lie
forwarded to IHC, ICC. and IFC,
but these organizations must have
the sole responsibility for the
formulation of their own rush
policies.
An investigation of the entire
judicial procedure should be un
dertaken. A right of appeal from
foreign campus decisions to judi
cial councils here and the crea
tion of a supreme court of appeal
—made up of students, faculty,
and administration • should be
considered.
As experiments 1 propose: dis
cussion of current issues in a bi
monthly forum of student officers
and deans before interested stu
dents; a committee of faculty,
students, and administrators to
provide quality control in all
areas of academic concern.
I offer criticism, solutions, and
experimentation. I offer dynamic
and creative student government.

YVithoul mincing words, I wish

issues lacing our campus:
LASSU: 11 should he abolished,
substituting in its place mass
meetings in the Stadium at which
vital matters would he discussed
in the democratic manner of
Athens.
<oed Housing: This is a matter
which should he left up to ihe in
dividual roommate.
Administration disputes: Lie

The student body president is
in a unique position to infuse stu
dent government with a spirit of
dynamism. In my view, the
ASSU should be a catalyst — an
instigator of new policies; an ac
tive force in coordinating not only
traditional student organizations
and affairs, but inspiring creative
ideas and energetic new pro
grams. The following outlines
several specific proposals for
creating new and worthwhile
areas for student action:
( li A special academic affairs
seminar should be established to
evaluate the 1 present academic
system and possible changes, such
as expansion of honors programs
and examination of the grading
system.
(2» An exchange program with
Negro universities in the South
should bo established and the
election of NSA delegates should
be initiated in order to further
promote student social concern.
l 3) Wider involvement in stu
dent government can be facili
tated by establishing an intern
program, giving interested in
dividuals the opportunity to par
ticipate in a variety of student
organizations on a rotational ba
sis.
(4) The Frank Morse case re
vealed ambiguities and confusion
in the present judicial system. My
platform outlines four specific
statements for insertion into Arti
cle I, Section I of the Constitu
tion, to overcome the weaknesses
in existing judicial procedure.
(5) The IFC, ICC, and lIIC
should have greater autonomy in
determining rush policy.
John 10. Bryson

The primary role of student
government at Stanford should be
lo stimulate student involvement
in the affairs of this campus and
to stimulate discussion and action,
through voluntary groups, on
issues of national and interna
tional concern. Student govern
ment. to achieve these aims, must
not merely solve problems as they
arise, bul experiment in new
areas of student involvement.
LASSU should confine its ac
tivities to campus affairs, while
involvement in issues beyond the
scope of the university should be
handled through voluntary
groups.
The recommendations of fresh
men and sophomores should lie
forwarded to IHC, ICC. and IFC,
but these organizations must have
the sole responsibility for the
formulation of their own rush
policies.
An investigation of the entire
judicial procedure should be un
dertaken. A right of appeal from
foreign campus decisions to judi
cial councils here and the crea
tion of a supreme court of appeal
—made up of students, faculty,
and administration • should be
considered.
As experiments 1 propose: dis
cussion of current issues in a bi
monthly forum of student officers
and deans before interested stu
dents; a committee of faculty,
students, and administrators to
provide quality control in all
areas of academic concern.
I offer criticism, solutions, and
experimentation. I offer dynamic
and creative student government.

I wish to commend I ho present
staff of the Daily for its vigorous
format now featured in this vital
document of student information.
This format is no doubt aided by
the Daily policy of stressing what
it wants to stress, covering and
ignoring whal it chooses to.
For these reasons I have risked
the disfavor of those 1 cannot
journalistically respect instead of
prostituting my personal and
political eonviclions for their sup
port. I find it hard to believe that
a newspaper so aloof to the inter
ests of Stanford students can con
sider itself a power over those
students and exploit that "power"
whenever it wishes.
The other candidates, who have
sought the favor of the Daily have
run typical campaigns and have

I become typical candidates. When
I this happens, someone of tradi
tional caliber is then typically
i elected, and for another year we
I discard hope for progress and
; continue to sow dirt, on the grave
j of a d\ ing dream.
Thus my campaign has been
limited, almost withheld pur
j pose fully, because you cannot
change a system by conforming.
1 have not been a typical cam
| paigner, because 1 will not be a
' typical president. For Stanford
I student government to assume
I meaning or purpose, it must be
[changed. I have committed myself
; to this change before the election,

The primary role of student
government at Stanford should be
lo stimulate student involvement
in the affairs of this campus and
to stimulate discussion and action,
through voluntary groups, on
issues of national and interna
tional concern. Student govern
ment. to achieve these aims, must
not merely solve problems as they
arise, bul experiment in new
areas of student involvement.
LASSU should confine its ac
tivities to campus affairs, while
involvement in issues beyond the
scope of the university should be
handled through voluntary
groups.
The recommendations of fresh
men and sophomores should lie
forwarded to IHC, ICC. and IFC,
but these organizations must have
the sole responsibility for the
formulation of their own rush
policies.
An investigation of the entire
judicial procedure should be un
dertaken. A right of appeal from
foreign campus decisions to judi
cial councils here and the crea
tion of a supreme court of appeal
—made up of students, faculty,
and administration • should be
considered.
As experiments 1 propose: dis
cussion of current issues in a bi
monthly forum of student officers
and deans before interested stu
dents; a committee of faculty,
students, and administrators to
provide quality control in all
areas of academic concern.
I offer criticism, solutions, and
experimentation. I offer dynamic
and creative student government.

I wish to commend I ho present
staff of the Daily for its vigorous
format now featured in this vital
document of student information.
This format is no doubt aided by
the Daily policy of stressing what
it wants to stress, covering and
ignoring whal it chooses to.
For these reasons I have risked
the disfavor of those 1 cannot
journalistically respect instead of
prostituting my personal and
political eonviclions for their sup
port. I find it hard to believe that
a newspaper so aloof to the inter
ests of Stanford students can con
sider itself a power over those
students and exploit that "power"
whenever it wishes.
The other candidates, who have
sought the favor of the Daily have
run typical campaigns and have

I become typical candidates. When
I this happens, someone of tradi
tional caliber is then typically
i elected, and for another year we
I discard hope for progress and
; continue to sow dirt, on the grave
j of a d\ ing dream.
Thus my campaign has been
limited, almost withheld pur
j pose fully, because you cannot
change a system by conforming.
1 have not been a typical cam
| paigner, because 1 will not be a
' typical president. For Stanford
I student government to assume
I meaning or purpose, it must be
[changed. I have committed myself
; to this change before the election,
jto leave no doubts as to what
I kind of president I would he in the
year to come.

YVithoul mincing words, I wish
to si alp my important views on
issues lacing our campus:
LASSU: 11 should he abolished,
substituting in its place mass
meetings in the Stadium at which
vital matters would he discussed
in the democratic manner of
Athens.
<oed Housing: This is a matter
which should he left up to ihe in
dividual roommate.
Administration disputes: Lie
ins, march-ins, and vigil-ins are
a tool which has not yet been ex
ploited sufficiently to protest Uni
versity policies. 1 propose imple
menting this technique.
Finances: Here 1 equivocate in
no uncertain terms.
Am I a serious candidate? Can
anyone ho a serious candidate for
this office?

The student body president is
in a unique position to infuse stu
dent government with a spirit of
dynamism. In my view, the
ASSU should be a catalyst — an
instigator of new policies; an ac
tive force in coordinating not only
traditional student organizations
and affairs, but inspiring creative
ideas and energetic new pro
grams. The following outlines
several specific proposals for
creating new and worthwhile
areas for student action:
( li A special academic affairs
seminar should be established to
evaluate the 1 present academic
system and possible changes, such
as expansion of honors programs
and examination of the grading
system.

should bo established and the
