The office of President is both ex
citing and challenging.
I offer experience: President, of
Roble Freshman year. Adminis
trative Assistant, Vice-President
of A.W.S. this year, and attend
ance at a regional and national
convention of the Intercollegiate
Associated Women Students.
I sincerely believe that this ex
perience will help to alleviate the
problems of wasted time, and help
in the reevaluation of programs.
More information should be made
convenient to the dorms. Job in
formation in uppcrelass dorms
and information on majors in the
Freshman dorms should be on file
so that it can be looked at in
leisure time. Guests in residence
programs with well-known
people could be worked out.

What is the Associated Women
Students al Stanford? It is a
loosely-amalgamated organization
of women students. The student
is often unaware of it, unless she
comes into contact with a com
mittee, such as Women's Council,
which exerts direct control over
her life.
The potentialities of this organ
ization have yet to lie realized.
A lack of communication exists
but could easily be remedied be
tween the student and ihe com
mittees or executive bodies.
An unusel function of the
board and cabinet is to act as a
clearinghouse for general prob
lems. This representative group
could present the problems 1o the
administration and be more effee
live than the present small group
action.
