# How To Create A Bogus Issue
## Editorial

It's a shame awards aren't given for du
plicity in ASSU campaigns.
Because if they were, presidential can
didate Edgar Kaiser would receive our
unanimous nomination for the honor. Few
have deserved it more than he has.

porters and phone calls from The Daily.
lie canceled his scheduled speaking en
gagements last week — giving his audiences
only last minute notice. He refused to show
up for a forum on KZSU radio. He failed
to attend the organizational meeting for
ASSU candidates. He did not reply to
Daily requests for his schedule and for a
photograph.
Not until Fridav afternoon was a re

he asked Kaiser for an interview, as part of
a series we are running on the candidates.
In a meeting at Kaiser's fraternity
house, the reporter asked only a few broad
questions (e.g., "What do you tliink the
main issue is in the campaign?" "What are
your qualifications?" "Describe your cam
paign organization").
KAISER AT FIRST refused to answer
anything. Then he said he would grant an
interview if the reporter would go back to
The Daily office and read his statement for
today's paper.
When the reporter returned from the
office, Kaiser informed him that he had
changed his mind: "I am not ready for a
statement at this time. His campaign
workers, however, gave the reporter a car
toon they wanted run, plugging Kaiser.

On Saturday he met with the reporter
again — this time at Tlic Daily — and lie
intimated that lie would allow an interview.
But shortly after he arrived, Kaiser said he
would have to leave lor "15 minutes" to
confer with his campaign staff. He didn't
return until an hour and a half later, at
which time he announced he would grant
no interview.
KAISER, UPON QUESTIONING, did
confide to the reporter that Ins statement
this morning did not mean that he thought
the paper was "blacking out" liis campaign.

obvious inference, Kaiser said: "You print
