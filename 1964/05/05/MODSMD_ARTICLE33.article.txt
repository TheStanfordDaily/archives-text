## Frulla Acted In Good Faith, Is Sensitive Administrator 
### 
Editor, The Daly:
Coverage of the Frank Morse
ease during the last four weeks
has tended to focus on person
alities rather than issues. Al
though KZSU and The Daily
have raised questions about
jurisdictional procedure, the
negative commentary has ob
scured the fact that Dr. Frulla
is a good administrator, and is
concerned about the interest in
students. Particularly objec
tionable was the Daily head
line of April 27, 1961: "Dr.
Frulla Blamed for Suspension."
ACTING IN his capacity as
Dean of Students at Stanford
in-Italy, Dr. Frulla sent what
we presume he believed to be
a just recommendation regard
ing Frank Morse. We believe
Dr. Frulla acted in good faith.
On the basis of our experi
ence working with Dr. Frulla,
we would like to emphasize to
Stanford students, particularly
to those students going to
Stanford-in-Italy, that he is a
sensitive, competent, concerned
administrator.

Editor, The Daily:
Miss Ruben, in attempting to
refute Hawley's statement that
the only way that a person's
rights may be violated is by
the use of physical force (or
the threat of its use), asks, by
way of counterexample, if Mr.
Hawley is being physically
forced to pay his Income Tax.
If Miss Ruben believes that the
government is not prepared to
use force in tax collection she
should contact Sonny Liston or
former-governor St rat ton for
a rude awakening.
SHE ALSO ASKS to be
shown "one person who works
for the right to be denied any
protection or privileges pro
vided him by the govern
ment. . . While I would cer
tainly not work for the gov
ernment's suspending its ef
forts to protect my rights
(since the protection of individ
ual rights is the purpose of
government), I do not seek or
desire any privileges from the
government.
The reason for this is, of
course, that the government
has no sanction to grant me
"special privileges" and their
granting would necessarily en
tail the violation of someone
else's rights for my benefit.
Miss Ruben also expresses
the belief, that Mr. Hawley and
his fellow objective individual
ists should feel some great
guilt when, while they enjoy
the fruits of their own produc
tive efforts, they look upon
those who are not enjoying
such fruits for the obvious rea
son t hat t hey prod u c e d
nothing. I share Mr. Hawley's
refusal to accept any such
guilt.

Editor, The Daily:
Having read Hans Werhli's
highly informative letter, I only
wish to correct what I feel
to be two minor but significant
errors on his part.
One, his erroneous assump
tion that this is a first rate
university, and Two, that the
only way to keep it first rale
is the complete homogenization
of its parts.
Even if the first was true,
a top-rate university does not
thrive on the suppression of in
dividuality among its constitu
ents. Without wishing to pass
judgment upon the paintings
of Harshbarger, I will venture
to say }hat they possess that
individuality upon which a pro
gressive and productive edu
cational institution thrives. It
is only unfortunate that they
be shown in such a garish and
unfavorable surrounding.

As a "veteran" alumna (B.A.
; '60; M.A. '62, Ph.D. still in prog
ress) of Stanford, I am ex
tremely distressed at the tone
which the PACE Program lit
erature has been assuming. In
particular, I object to the sen
tence in the recent Annual
Fund solicitation letter which
read "By your past support you
have given your approval of
Stanford's program." Let it be
clearly understood that I in
tended no such blanket ap
proval and in fact plan to with
draw all support both financial
and moral if such implications
of PACE donations continue to
appear in PACE literature.
ANY (SMALL) financial and
moral support I may have giv
en to Stanford's PACE Pro
gram reflects only that I be
lieve education is the most im
portant investment of funds
one can make, that I believe
Stanford educated me well, and
that I would like to sec others
benefiting from such opportun
ities as Stanford provides.
And, oh yes, the PACE liter
ature's claim that the dear old
farm takes care of its own is
substantially correct; In my
case these "fringe benefits"
ranged from jobs to a tonsil
lectomy "on the house" to a
man from '59.
In no sense, however, does
any past or future contribu
tion of mine represent a blan
ket approval of Stanford's en
tire program ranging from the
physics "water tank" down to
every new light bulb in dear
old Roblc Hall. Please, dear
Alma Mater, would you that
such uncritical approval should
befall you as your thanks from
the ones whose education you
provide?

Coverage of the Frank Morse
ease during the last four weeks
has tended to focus on person
alities rather than issues. Al
though KZSU and The Daily
have raised questions about
jurisdictional procedure, the
negative commentary has ob
scured the fact that Dr. Frulla
is a good administrator, and is
concerned about the interest in
students. Particularly objec
tionable was the Daily head
line of April 27, 1961: "Dr.
Frulla Blamed for Suspension."
ACTING IN his capacity as
Dean of Students at Stanford
in-Italy, Dr. Frulla sent what
we presume he believed to be
a just recommendation regard
ing Frank Morse. We believe
Dr. Frulla acted in good faith.
On the basis of our experi
ence working with Dr. Frulla,
we would like to emphasize to
Stanford students, particularly
to those students going to
Stanford-in-Italy, that he is a
sensitive, competent, concerned

Miss Ruben, in attempting to
refute Hawley's statement that
the only way that a person's
rights may be violated is by
the use of physical force (or
the threat of its use), asks, by
way of counterexample, if Mr.
Hawley is being physically
forced to pay his Income Tax.
If Miss Ruben believes that the
government is not prepared to
use force in tax collection she
should contact Sonny Liston or
former-governor St rat ton for
a rude awakening.
SHE ALSO ASKS to be
shown "one person who works
for the right to be denied any
protection or privileges pro
vided him by the govern
ment. . . While I would cer
tainly not work for the gov
ernment's suspending its ef
forts to protect my rights
(since the protection of individ
ual rights is the purpose of
government), I do not seek or
desire any privileges from the
government.
The reason for this is, of
course, that the government
has no sanction to grant me
"special privileges" and their
granting would necessarily en
tail the violation of someone
else's rights for my benefit.
Miss Ruben also expresses
the belief, that Mr. Hawley and
his fellow objective individual
ists should feel some great
guilt when, while they enjoy
the fruits of their own produc
tive efforts, they look upon
those who are not enjoying
such fruits for the obvious rea

refusal to accept any such

Having read Hans Werhli's
highly informative letter, I only
wish to correct what I feel
to be two minor but significant
errors on his part.
One, his erroneous assump
tion that this is a first rate
university, and Two, that the
only way to keep it first rale
is the complete homogenization
of its parts.
Even if the first was true,
a top-rate university does not
thrive on the suppression of in
dividuality among its constitu

judgment upon the paintings
of Harshbarger, I will venture

; '60; M.A. '62, Ph.D. still in prog
ress) of Stanford, I am ex
tremely distressed at the tone
which the PACE Program lit
erature has been assuming. In
particular, I object to the sen
tence in the recent Annual
Fund solicitation letter which
read "By your past support you
have given your approval of
Stanford's program." Let it be
clearly understood that I in
tended no such blanket ap
proval and in fact plan to with
draw all support both financial
and moral if such implications
of PACE donations continue to
appear in PACE literature.
ANY (SMALL) financial and
moral support I may have giv
en to Stanford's PACE Pro
gram reflects only that I be
lieve education is the most im
portant investment of funds
one can make, that I believe
Stanford educated me well, and
that I would like to sec others
benefiting from such opportun
ities as Stanford provides.
And, oh yes, the PACE liter
ature's claim that the dear old
farm takes care of its own is
substantially correct; In my
case these "fringe benefits"
ranged from jobs to a tonsil
lectomy "on the house" to a
man from '59.
In no sense, however, does
any past or future contribu
tion of mine represent a blan
ket approval of Stanford's en
tire program ranging from the
physics "water tank" down to
every new light bulb in dear
old Roblc Hall. Please, dear
Alma Mater, would you that
such uncritical approval should
befall you as your thanks from
the ones whose education you
provide?

Coverage of the Frank Morse
ease during the last four weeks
has tended to focus on person
alities rather than issues. Al
though KZSU and The Daily
have raised questions about
jurisdictional procedure, the
negative commentary has ob
scured the fact that Dr. Frulla
is a good administrator, and is
concerned about the interest in
students. Particularly objec
tionable was the Daily head
line of April 27, 1961: "Dr.
Frulla Blamed for Suspension."
ACTING IN his capacity as
Dean of Students at Stanford
in-Italy, Dr. Frulla sent what
we presume he believed to be
a just recommendation regard
ing Frank Morse. We believe
Dr. Frulla acted in good faith.
On the basis of our experi
ence working with Dr. Frulla,
we would like to emphasize to
Stanford students, particularly
to those students going to
Stanford-in-Italy, that he is a
sensitive, competent, concerned
administrator.

Editor, The Daily:
Miss Ruben, in attempting to
refute Hawley's statement that
the only way that a person's
rights may be violated is by
the use of physical force (or
the threat of its use), asks, by
way of counterexample, if Mr.
Hawley is being physically
forced to pay his Income Tax.
If Miss Ruben believes that the
government is not prepared to
use force in tax collection she
should contact Sonny Liston or
former-governor St rat ton for
a rude awakening.
SHE ALSO ASKS to be
shown "one person who works
for the right to be denied any
protection or privileges pro
vided him by the govern
ment. . . While I would cer
tainly not work for the gov
ernment's suspending its ef
forts to protect my rights
(since the protection of individ
ual rights is the purpose of
government), I do not seek or
desire any privileges from the
government.
The reason for this is, of
course, that the government
has no sanction to grant me
"special privileges" and their
granting would necessarily en
tail the violation of someone
else's rights for my benefit.
Miss Ruben also expresses
the belief, that Mr. Hawley and
his fellow objective individual
ists should feel some great
guilt when, while they enjoy
the fruits of their own produc
tive efforts, they look upon
those who are not enjoying
such fruits for the obvious rea
son t hat t hey prod u c e d
nothing. I share Mr. Hawley's
refusal to accept any such
guilt.

Having read Hans Werhli's
highly informative letter, I only
wish to correct what I feel
to be two minor but significant
errors on his part.
One, his erroneous assump
tion that this is a first rate
university, and Two, that the
only way to keep it first rale
is the complete homogenization
of its parts.
Even if the first was true,
a top-rate university does not
thrive on the suppression of in
dividuality among its constitu
ents. Without wishing to pass
judgment upon the paintings
of Harshbarger, I will venture
to say }hat they possess that
individuality upon which a pro
gressive and productive edu
cational institution thrives. It
is only unfortunate that they
be shown in such a garish and
unfavorable surrounding.
