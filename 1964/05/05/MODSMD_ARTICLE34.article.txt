## 'Guys And Dolls' Enjoyable In Spite Of Unevenness 
### John Thayer 
Productions of musical comedies arc nearly always an uneasy
truce between singing and acting, wherein the singers can t act,
the actors can t sing, and some can do neither.
However, in the current Ram's Head gala allair, C-iii/s and
Dolls, there are a goodly number ol glowing exceptions to this
rule, and they are largely responsible lor the enjoyable, i! uneven
and at times strained, evening that results.
The very durable material the actors have to work with, pro
vided of course by Frank Loesser and Abe Burrows, is about w hat
happens when irresistible force (handsome gambler guy Sky Mas
terson) meets immovable object (Salvation Army doll Sarah
Brown).

THE OUTCOME is naturally love, and the backdrop is The
Oldest Established Permanent Floating Crap Game in New York
et al versus the Save-a-Soul Mission, complete with bass drum and
American flag. The comic relic! is provided by Nathan Detroit,
who runs The Oldest Established, his partners in crime, Nieely-
Nieely Johnson and Bennie South street, and Nathans fiance of
fourteen years, Miss Adelaide.
The first remarkable tiling about Guys and Dolls is the sets.
Apparently Ram's Head has spawned the awesome technical geni
us and vision of a master craftsman. W alls descend out of the
darkness with frightening speed, or float in from the wings to
meet the ceiling that is on its way down. Boxes and stacks of
newspapers propel themselves out to stage center, and the out
side of it night club splits open to become the inside of one.
Never have scene changes been so enjoyable. The sets them
selves are stylizations of The Real New York, but with the atmos
phere and all the necessary items unmistakably there.
The orchestra and choruses perform well and behave them
selves under David ( v )uattrone s sensitive yet energetic direction.
Minor chaos does ensue whenever there is a male dance number,
the blame for this, however, lying somewhere between the choreo
grapher and the two left feet of most of the male chorus.
Of the principals, the best musical performances are those ol
Dennis Fales (Nicely-Nicely) and David Getty (Bennie). They
also give the best dramatic performances, very nearly stealing the
show. Susan Leich (Sarah) and Ruth Hunt (Miss Adelaide) are
close behind, each with good ideas about the songs and enough
vocal talent to bring them off.
But the problem is not the singing: the problem is Lawrence
Madison's directing and Steve Bradley s acting. First of all, the
show is played as a broad comedy, very nearly a farce. Farce can
not be maintained continuously, even with heroic efforts, for three
hours. Some kind of change-of-pace is needed; and certainly Bur
rows and Loesser knew that.

GUYS AND DOLLS as written is a bittersweet comedy if it is
anything at all, and it loses a great deal of its impact and becomes
noticeably strained when its bitters are so sugar-coated. Also, in
playing it as a farce, the characters themselves tend to become no
more than very small paper dolls with vocal cords instead of being
charaeters-in-the-round who are so tremendously alive that they
can grow until they nearly fill the stage with their vitality.
This over-simple, one-sided approach to character is disastrous
in the ease ol Steve Bradley, w ho does a w retched job as Sky Mas
tcrson. His timing and delivery are bad, and his characterization
is practically nonexistent, mainly because he liasn I bothered to
decide what kind of a man Sky Mastcrson really is. Worst of all,
he is nearly inaudible during his biggest scene, when he should
carry over all the chorus singing around him.
Fortunately, he can be. largely ignored when lie is onstage and
happily forgotten when he is oil. I'or the antics and singing ol
David Getty and Dennis Kales, the delightful siinplemindcdncss of
Ruth Hunt, the unobtrusive but solid acting of Al Novikofl as Na
than Detroit, and Susan Leich s hall-hearted Salvation Army ser
geant are what carry the show triumphantly into the flittering ros
ier ol Rams Mead Successes.
