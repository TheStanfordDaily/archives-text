"The basic issue is that student
government must he an honest
and open government, by and
for the students."
With these words Ed Kaiser
presented what he sees as the key
issue in his campaign for ASSU
president. The candidate stated
that, if he were elected, he would
create this kind of student gov
ernment.
"I stand firm in my belief that
every point on my platform can,
and will, be accomplished under
the condition that I receive the

support and active interest of the
entire student body," ho said.
He also stressed his student Kill
of Rights which he feels is an im
portant part of his platform. His
opponents are opposed to this
type of bill, lie said.
