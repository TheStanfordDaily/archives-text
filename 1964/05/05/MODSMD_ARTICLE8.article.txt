### ROD PECK 
John Bryson, Scott Mcßride and
Edgar Kaiser, ASSU presidential
| candidates, delivered campaign
| statements and answered ques
| tions before 100 freshman men
} and women yesterday afternoon
| in the Rineonada lounge.
j Kaeh of the candidates made a
! short statement on the following
(question: "As ASSU President,
i what do you feel would be your
J duties and responsibilities to the
(student body?" A question and
j answer period followed.
BRYSON spoke first and pre
-1 faced his platform with the feel
ing that "not enough distinction
; had been made between the can
didates in this campaign." He
stated, "Student government
could continue to exist adminis
! tered by the various boards of
| ASSU, but I call for a complete
! expansion of student involvement.
We must criticize, question, and
demand change where we find it
j necessary."
lie cited such proposals as con
tinuation of the Civil Rights Sec
! ret aria t and exchanges wit h Ne
jgro universities, election of NSA
(delegates, and increased involve-
I ment in areas of national and in
ternational concern, to aeeom
i plish his goal.
McBRIDE urged a stimulation
j of student concern in all areas,
I but felt that once the project was
j started we should move on to
other areas of prime importance,
j He said, "We must be prepared
to offer information to ail stu
dents on all affairs. An open for
um composed of administrators
and students is one way this can
be done."
He also called for active inves
j ligation and subsequent pressure
jto accomplish changes in situa
tions similar to the Morse case.
"It is urgent that we have new
ideas and new experiments," he
concluded.
KAISER asserted, "We believe
we should be knowledgeable and
intelligent citizens. Therefore, the
ASSU President must represent
students in all areas of concern
; including national and interna
tional. I am running on a plat
form of change. I call for support
and interest ncxl year. I want to
put the student back in student
government."
He concluded, "We should not
j surrender our rights as human
I beings upon entering Stanford
I University."
The candidates were questioned
ias to their respective qualifica
tions. Mcßride replied, "1 feel I've
; had the most participation in the
various boards and commissions,
i and have served this year as Po
j litical Union President." Kaiser
j remarked that he had been on
I both sides of the fence." "Al
j though I may not be one of the
Daily's favorite people." he joked,
I "I'm not just an individual repre-
I senting a living group. I represent
all students."
Bryson felt that, it "hinges on
j attitude. I put the emphasis on a
working relationship with stu
dents learned while serving as
sophomore class president and
president of my Stanford-in-Ger-
I many group."
