THE CRITICAL ATHEIST
I
There have been many through the ages that have looked about
them and exclaimed:
"The heavens declare the glory; and the firmament showeth
his handiwork." (Psalm 19:1)
Others have peered out at this universe, sometimes wondering
at their fellow mortal's mentality and have come up with another
story:
"There is no God; it is clear as the sun and as evident as the
day that there is no God, and still more that there can be none."—
Gustave Flourens.
The critical atheist is by and large the largest group among
the atheists. His concern is an honest one: he is convinced, as are j
Christians, that it is morally wrong to believe something for which
one does not have god evidence. Doubts and misgivings are to be
confronted and not sweetly soothed by ignoring them; nor are j
they to be supressed by mechanical continuance of meaningless
religious ritual. The critical atheist has found, as have Christians,
that one cannot believe what one's mind cannot accept.
The position Christians find themselves in has often been in
terpreted by outsiders to be one of unmitigated pride. For Chris
tians claim to comprehend evidence that is conclusive in affirm- !
ing that God invaded human life and history in the Person of Jesus
Christ, evidence that is available to all men. This claim would
indeed be presumptious if Christians did not possess the evidence
of which they speak. But only personal investigation can verify
the claims that Christians make. One simply must see for oneself.
Christians have at least three observations to make concerning
critical atheism's rejection of God on the basis of insufficient
! evidence:
(1) The denial of the evidence by some people is not tanta- :
1 mount to concluding that there is no evidence, or that the evidence |
j is not adequate for the conclusion. For example, the tribesmen of j
Amazonia may be considered as tribal heroes for denying the
existence of the white man's 'microorganisms' (they consider
the white man as rather pretentious for his claim), but only be
cause they have not seen the evidence, or refuse to look at the
evidence, or deny the force of the evidence. Yet we all know that
microorganisms still exist.
(2) It is strange but true that most skeptics are secondhand.
Few who deny that Jesus Christ is God have carefully considered
the evidence in the New Testament since they have become
thinking adults. Most are satisfied with accepting someone else's
disparagement without giving themselves time for a fair examina
! tion of the relevant documents.
(3) It is true that the crux of Christianity rests on the resur
-1 rection of Jesus Christ. Those who have taken the time and
trouble as thinking adults to study the evidence carefully and
exhaustively have frequently reached the conclusion that the
events described in I Corinthians Chapter IS and the end of the
Gospels did in fact take place. One famous intellectual, Frank
Morrison, who set out to disprove the resurrection, has captured
his devastating, well-reasoned conclusions in Who Moved the
Stone? He records that fair consideration of the evidence led
him to lose faith in his disbelief and discover Jesus Christ as a
person who can be known as well as one knows his human friends.
Christians are confident (largely because they have gone
through the very same experience) that there is no one with an
adult mind who can seriously and honestly consider the Person of
Jesus Christ without concluding that He had to be whom He said
He was—He had to be God to have done the things He did, to
have said the things He said, and to have been the Person He was.
Christians speak with boldness, confidence and authority be
cause they have met Jesus Christ and know Him now. He is neither
remote nor mythical nor imaginery. He is not a hero of the past
but a living Person. Since we each have but one life to live, it
behooves us to make very sure about Jesus Christ. And to this
day, nearly two millenia after His earthly visit, He has never been
known to fail any man, woman, or child who has asked for His
j life love and help. BOX 11701, PALO ALTO.

Christians have at least three observations to make concerning
critical atheism's rejection of God on the basis of insufficient
! evidence:
(1) The denial of the evidence by some people is not tanta- :
1 mount to concluding that there is no evidence, or that the evidence |
j is not adequate for the conclusion. For example, the tribesmen of j
Amazonia may be considered as tribal heroes for denying the
existence of the white man's 'microorganisms' (they consider
the white man as rather pretentious for his claim), but only be
cause they have not seen the evidence, or refuse to look at the
evidence, or deny the force of the evidence. Yet we all know that
microorganisms still exist.
(2) It is strange but true that most skeptics are secondhand.
Few who deny that Jesus Christ is God have carefully considered
the evidence in the New Testament since they have become
thinking adults. Most are satisfied with accepting someone else's
disparagement without giving themselves time for a fair examina
! tion of the relevant documents.
(3) It is true that the crux of Christianity rests on the resur
-1 rection of Jesus Christ. Those who have taken the time and
trouble as thinking adults to study the evidence carefully and
exhaustively have frequently reached the conclusion that the
events described in I Corinthians Chapter IS and the end of the
Gospels did in fact take place. One famous intellectual, Frank
Morrison, who set out to disprove the resurrection, has captured
his devastating, well-reasoned conclusions in Who Moved the
Stone? He records that fair consideration of the evidence led
him to lose faith in his disbelief and discover Jesus Christ as a
person who can be known as well as one knows his human friends.
Christians are confident (largely because they have gone
through the very same experience) that there is no one with an
adult mind who can seriously and honestly consider the Person of
Jesus Christ without concluding that He had to be whom He said
He was—He had to be God to have done the things He did, to
have said the things He said, and to have been the Person He was.
Christians speak with boldness, confidence and authority be
cause they have met Jesus Christ and know Him now. He is neither
remote nor mythical nor imaginery. He is not a hero of the past
but a living Person. Since we each have but one life to live, it
behooves us to make very sure about Jesus Christ. And to this
day, nearly two millenia after His earthly visit, He has never been
known to fail any man, woman, or child who has asked for His
j life love and help. BOX 11701, PALO ALTO.

THE CRITICAL ATHEIST
I
There have been many through the ages that have looked about
them and exclaimed:
"The heavens declare the glory; and the firmament showeth
his handiwork." (Psalm 19:1)
Others have peered out at this universe, sometimes wondering
at their fellow mortal's mentality and have come up with another
story:
"There is no God; it is clear as the sun and as evident as the
day that there is no God, and still more that there can be none."—
Gustave Flourens.
The critical atheist is by and large the largest group among
the atheists. His concern is an honest one: he is convinced, as are j
Christians, that it is morally wrong to believe something for which
one does not have god evidence. Doubts and misgivings are to be
confronted and not sweetly soothed by ignoring them; nor are j
they to be supressed by mechanical continuance of meaningless
religious ritual. The critical atheist has found, as have Christians,
that one cannot believe what one's mind cannot accept.
The position Christians find themselves in has often been in
terpreted by outsiders to be one of unmitigated pride. For Chris
tians claim to comprehend evidence that is conclusive in affirm- !
ing that God invaded human life and history in the Person of Jesus
Christ, evidence that is available to all men. This claim would
indeed be presumptious if Christians did not possess the evidence
of which they speak. But only personal investigation can verify
the claims that Christians make. One simply must see for oneself.

He was—He had to be God to have done the things He did, to
have said the things He said, and to have been the Person He was.
Christians speak with boldness, confidence and authority be
cause they have met Jesus Christ and know Him now. He is neither
remote nor mythical nor imaginery. He is not a hero of the past
but a living Person. Since we each have but one life to live, it
behooves us to make very sure about Jesus Christ. And to this
day, nearly two millenia after His earthly visit, He has never been
known to fail any man, woman, or child who has asked for His
j life love and help. BOX 11701, PALO ALTO.
