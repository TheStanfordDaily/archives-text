• Cuba Boycott To Continue
WASHINGTON — The U.S. campaign to
tighten an economic boycott around Cuba will
continue despite a new setback: the sale by a
French firm of 20 diesel locomotives to the
government of Prime Minister Fidel Castro.
That was the word yesterday from Under

secretary of State George W. Ball, who said
the boycott policy has been succeeding and
will be pushed further to make it more effec

• Wallace Falters hi Indiana
INDIANAPOLIS -- Democratic Gov. Mat
thew E. Welsh held the field for President
Johnson last night, winning Indiana's presi
dential primary while Alabama Gov. George
C. Wallace apparently fell short of his showing
in Wisconsin.

Democratic fears of a heavy Republican
cross-over vote for Wallace in protest against
Welch's sales tax and civil rights demonstra
tors apparently failed to materialize. Scattered
polling places which reported on the cross
over said it was light.
Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Barry Gold
water grabbed Indiana's 32 GOP National Con
vention votes despite a stronger-than-expected
turnout for former Minnesota Gov. Harold E.
Stassen.
