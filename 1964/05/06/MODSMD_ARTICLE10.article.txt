## Elections To Be Held Today And Tomorrow 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
Presidential candidates John 1
Bride staged their last three-way
last night, prior to the primary el
The debate produced sharp di
on virtually every question raise
In an opening statement Bryson *
developed his philosophy of stu
dent government, saying that
"Student government must go be
yond the basic operations of the
President's office and the boards
and commissions."
HE IDENTIFIED the respon
sibilities of the ASSU President
as developing programs to involve
the maximum number of students
in creative projects, to bring stu
dent voice to bear on shortcom
ings within the Stanford commu
nity, to raise the level of student
interaction with the faculty, and
to present a creative philosophy
in student government.
Mcßride said that the role of
the student body president should
be to stimulate interest, revitalize
defunct organizations such as the
Stu-Fac Board, to disseminate in
formation on student affairs, and
to act as a coordinator between
the various boards and commis
sions.
Kaiser missed tlie first few min
utes of the debate due to another
speaking engagement, and was
unable to make any introductory
remarks.
THE CANDIDATES' proposals
on judicial process was one of the
major areas of disagreement. All
three have proposed some form of
Court of Last Appeals, but differ
on its makeup, and its place in
student-administrative procedure
'in handling disciplinary cases.
Mcßride favors a Board com
posed of Judicial Council mem
bers, and distinguished faculty
to which students could appeal
from the Judicial Council.
Kaiser proposes a five member
committee which would serve as
an appeal board from the judicial
council prior to final decision by
the administration. The commit
tee would be composed of the
heads of men and women council,
a member appointed by the
[ASSU president, a faculty mem
ber, and the Dean of Students. A
law student would also serve to
insure that the students brought
before the committee were aware
I of their rights under the judicial
process.
BKYSON OPPOSED this, feel
ing that it would create an un
necessary stop in judicial proce
'dure. He has proposed that a stu-

dent and a faculty member be
placed on the Student Affairs and
Services subcommittee which ad
vises the Dean on disciplinary
matters.
Kaiser maintains that under the
present judicial setup, some cases
go directly to the judicial council
and that an appeal board from
that is necessary.
Kaiser's proposal to create some
restaurants on campus which
could capture some of the flavor
of the overseas campuses came
under heavy fire from the other
candidates. Mcßride said that re
search that he has done on the
matter, indicated that the propos
al was "not practical."
BKYSON AGREED, pointing
out that "The I-Club's Sidewalk
Cafe is a losing venture."
Kaiser said that it could be
tried by using Ihe small dining
areas in Tresidder "two or three
times a week to see if any of
the restaurants might be success
ful."
The candidates also disagreed
on political parties on campus, a
proposal made in Kaiser's plat
form. Mcßride felt that there is
'no congruity of issues" between
students on which to base two
parties. Bryson felt, that parties
might prevent interested people
from working in student govern
ment.
KAISER AND Mcßride agreed
that the Civil Rights Secretariat
should be placed under the Poli
tical Union. Both feel that it
would operate best as a volun
tary organization.
Bryson said that it should be
made an administrative board,
similar to the lIR, with certain
expanded functions.
