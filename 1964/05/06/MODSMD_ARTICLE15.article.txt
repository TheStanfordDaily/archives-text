# Architects Asked To Restore Town
## 
### 
Plans to restore and maintain
the historic Old Town area of Be !
nicia have been assigned to 13
architecture students as a class
project.
Prof. Thomas T. Williamson's
class in Architecture 101, elemen
tary design, accepted an invita
tion by the Benicia City Council
earlier this year to study the
city's growth problems and make
recommendations and plans for
its future.
The class has been divided into
three groups, which will study the
city's general plan, the Old Town
proper, and the development of
the scenic waterfront.
They are under way with a
contour map of the areas involved,
large map-type drawings, and
models which indicate suggested
remodeling of older buildings and
the installation of new.
Everything will be reproduced
on 35-millimeter color slides and
sequenced for oral presentation
at an all-afternoon affair June 10
in Benicia. The materials will be
give to the city administration
afterwards.
