## Repeal Will Hurt Many 
### BARBARA SCHNUR 
Much more than specific sec
tions of the Rumford Act would
be repealed by the proposed
amendment to the California con
stitution which comes before vot
ers in November.
That was the conclusion of a
panel discussion presented by the
Stanford Students for Fair Hous
ing yesterday afternoon. Members
of the panel included Robert Mc-
Afee Brown, professor of religion;
Charles Meyers, professor of law;
John Howard, past president of
Palo Alto CORE; Howard Lewis,
a Palo Alto realtor, and Ann
Weaver, head of the Vallejo work
camp project.
THE AMENDMENT sponsored
by the California Real Estate As
sociation would also nullify the
general fair practices law known
as the Unruh Act. The CREA, ac
cording to members of the panel,
has been using the Rumford Act
as a "smoke-screen" to cloud the
more basic constitutional changes
that the bill would cause.
Meyers noted that the most ex
isting fair housing legislation can
do is eliminate one criterion for
selling or renting property. Sup
porters of the amendment who
are worried about their "freedom
to sell" must realize that they are
still free to establish other cri
teria to limit prospective pur
chasers. Panel members empha
sized that "freedom to buy" is
just as important as the property
owner's right to sell.
Two other objections raised by
supporters of the amendment
were summarized by Howard.
The alleged arguments are that
owners or managers can he too
easily subjected to harassment
and ihat it's difficult to prove dis
crimination has occurred. On re
ply Howard brought forth several
case studies which domonstrated
the following facts.
FIRST, in actual cases it has
been fairly easy to determine acts
of discrimination. Also, Howard
said, cases have been solved very
rapidly, averaging around one or
two days. Finally, Howard pointed
out that very few cases ever reach
the stage when intervention by
the Fair Employment Practices
Commission is necessary.
Stanford students who worked
in Vallejo found that most of the
people they encountered outside
of the Negro area were either
totally ignorant of or misin
formed about what the amend
ment will do.
Lewis, a former member of tin?
board of directors of the CREA
and an avowed conservative,
stated that the amendment would
not help real estate brokers at all.
He stressed the fact that "the very
conservative values that business
men are trying to protect arc in
danger from this amendment."
