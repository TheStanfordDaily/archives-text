## 
### O. Correspondent 
At Berkeley on Saturday it was
tennis in a speculative key. In a
performance that stunned even
I Ik* so-called experts the highly
unpredictable l Stanford Indians
j routed Cal 9-0.
Recent anti-Indian editorializing
in the Cal newspaper. The Daily
Californiai), aroused the S I a 11-
i lord team to the brink ol rage and
1 inspired a determined effort on
the part of each player.
IN Till: FKATM.'K s ingle s
.match Jim Beste defeated Doug
J Sykes in three sets. With his
! wrathful strokes Beste casually
j flicked winning shots around tin 1
: court at will until he reached 6 2.
I l.
At that point intense boredom
! set in and he .just as casually pro
duced five double faults in the
sixth game and proceeded to lose
i the set. After a set and a half of
: absurd errors he escaped at 0-1
| in the third set.
JKKKY lIUKST overcame his
; syndrome nemesis in the second
: singles with a victory over a
I bounding Barry Baskins 6-1, ■ 1 -(»,
16-3. Hurst countered Baskin's
I powerful drives with sharply
jangled placements to win the
{first set. But Baskin swept the
I second and advanced to a 3-1 lead

in the third before Hurst could
turn the tide.
On important points the image
conscious Baskin seemed oblivi
ous to the situation and invariably
whaled balls over the has'line or
into the fence. In the aftermath
no one was more startled with
the outcome than Hurst himself.
HON I'l{ KISS MAN avenged an
earlier loss by defeating Dick Ab
rahmson 6-3, 10-8. Preissman's hiy
ugly left handed serve and loop
ing forehand drives left Abrahm
son too puzzled to respond.
In other noteworthy events of
the day John Isaacs axed Gene
Cantin in straight sets and John
Burt produced an amazing voca
bulary of shots that overwhelmed
self-exiled Czech Jan Klicera.
The final singles match saw
Bradley Hodgeman's formless ap
proach to the game wipe out Don
Adolphson (»-(), 62. Ilodgman's
crackling serve and intriguing
style left Adolphson in dismay.
Indeed it was a day for the im
aginative rather than the con
scientious.
