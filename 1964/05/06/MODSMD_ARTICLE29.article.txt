# FENDER
## A 						Confused Presidential Campaign 
### PELL FENDER 
In the midst of this presidential
campaign we are somewhat con
fused: Steve Gruber is farcing
the presidency, Scott Mcßride
offers "criticism, solutions, and
experimentation," John Bryson
maintains that he as president
can "infuse student government
with a spirit of dynamism," and
Edgar Kaiser refuses "to sow
dirt on the grave of a dying
dream."
The three serious candidates
offer much the same platform in
certain areas: each intends to in
stitute action in the realm of stu-

dent rights and
rush proposals.
The two top
contenders, how
ever, Bryson and
Kaiser, have pre
sented more ex
tensive and more
expl i c i t plat-

forms: each has taken a some
what similar stand on a Student
Hill of Rights, the election of NSA
delegates, academics, and the Civil
Rights Secretariat.
John Bryson is an honors stu
dent and "has been president of
something every year while at
Stanford" (namely his freshman
house, the sophomore class he
abolished class government—and
his Stanford in-Germany group).
Kaiser has not been president,
of something every year while at
Stanford; he was president of Axe
Com. and has worked with the
Student Advisory Committee.
★ ★ ★
BRYSON'S campaign has been
one of the straightforward type.
Kaiser held back until yesterday,
and then flooded the market. Bry
son has run a consistent, diy, and
somewhat typical campaign which
will impress, probably, consistent,
dry, and somewhat typical people
(who support Bryson's "dynamic"
government).
Who is behind John Bryson?
Bryson is the latest addition to the
political family of Rosencranz,
Wedin and Strolitz. He is the lat
est proponent of the "force it
down the mouth of the adminis
tration" approach to student gov
ernment.
He is backed by the present In
group which, incidentally, mid
way through Bryson's campaign,
suggested that Sandy McKenzie
run in lieu of Bryson.
Kaiser is supported by Univer
sity Party, a body founded last
quarter to prevent stagnation in
student government by providing
an alternative to the heretofore
unchallenged way in which stu
dent government has been run.
★ ★ ★
THE ISSUE between the two
top contenders seems to be a con
test between "dynamism" (Bry
son), and pragmatism (Kaiser).
Bryson's "dynamism" will be in
stituted, presumably, with the
same methods employed by his
predecessors and backers, specifi
cally, Rosencranz and Wedin. Bry
son seems to have had only
limited experience with the ad
ministration, a vital key to the
efficiency of student government.
Kaiser represents a more prag
matic, and at this point necessary,
change which will result in re
integration of student govern
ment. Kaiser is qualified in more
ways than one for co-existing
with the administration without
loss to the students. He will put
student government back in its
proper perspective.

Wedin and Strolitz. He is the lat
est proponent of the "force it
down the mouth of the adminis
tration" approach to student gov
ernment.
He is backed by the present In
group which, incidentally, mid
way through Bryson's campaign,
suggested that Sandy McKenzie
run in lieu of Bryson.
Kaiser is supported by Univer
sity Party, a body founded last
quarter to prevent stagnation in
student government by providing
an alternative to the heretofore
unchallenged way in which stu
dent government has been run.

THE ISSUE between the two
top contenders seems to be a con
test between "dynamism" (Bry
son), and pragmatism (Kaiser).
Bryson's "dynamism" will be in
stituted, presumably, with the
same methods employed by his
predecessors and backers, specifi
cally, Rosencranz and Wedin. Bry
son seems to have had only
limited experience with the ad
ministration, a vital key to the
efficiency of student government.
Kaiser represents a more prag
matic, and at this point necessary,
change which will result in re
integration of student govern
ment. Kaiser is qualified in more
ways than one for co-existing
with the administration without
loss to the students. He will put
student government back in its
proper perspective.

In the midst of this presidential
campaign we are somewhat con
fused: Steve Gruber is farcing
the presidency, Scott Mcßride
offers "criticism, solutions, and
experimentation," John Bryson
maintains that he as president
can "infuse student government
with a spirit of dynamism," and
Edgar Kaiser refuses "to sow
dirt on the grave of a dying
dream."
The three serious candidates
offer much the same platform in
certain areas: each intends to in
stitute action in the realm of stu-

dent rights and
rush proposals.
The two top
contenders, how
ever, Bryson and
Kaiser, have pre
sented more ex
tensive and more
expl i c i t plat-

forms: each has taken a some
what similar stand on a Student
Hill of Rights, the election of NSA
delegates, academics, and the Civil
Rights Secretariat.
John Bryson is an honors stu
dent and "has been president of
something every year while at
Stanford" (namely his freshman
house, the sophomore class he
abolished class government—and
his Stanford in-Germany group).
Kaiser has not been president,
of something every year while at
Stanford; he was president of Axe
Com. and has worked with the
Student Advisory Committee.

BRYSON'S campaign has been
one of the straightforward type.
Kaiser held back until yesterday,
and then flooded the market. Bry
son has run a consistent, diy, and
somewhat typical campaign which
will impress, probably, consistent,
dry, and somewhat typical people
(who support Bryson's "dynamic"
government).
Who is behind John Bryson?
Bryson is the latest addition to the
political family of Rosencranz,
Wedin and Strolitz. He is the lat
est proponent of the "force it
down the mouth of the adminis
tration" approach to student gov
ernment.
He is backed by the present In
group which, incidentally, mid
