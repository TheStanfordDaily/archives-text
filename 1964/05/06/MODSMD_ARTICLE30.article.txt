# Stanford Yesterday

### 
TEN YEARS AGO
Having classes six mornings
a week, we get a very special
pleasure out of sleeping late on
Sunday. We are quite sure that
our objections to having the lux
ury of Sunday morning sack
shared hy many other students.
Would it hp possible to have
those beautiful notes stifled until
sometime after noon? Letter to
Ihe Editor, Daily, Feb. 3, 1954
The blood-curling serials that
used to be a weekly feature at the
Sunday night 'flicks' are gone but
not forgotten. A campus wide
campaign to bring them back is
being planned by a group of stu
dents who are circulating a peti
tion reading "As members of the
Stanford student body, we request
that the Sunday night flicks shall
include a serial on the program."
Many students complained when
the serials were discontinued, but
nobody took any action. At the
beginning of the quarter, we de
cided to do something ;ibout it.
