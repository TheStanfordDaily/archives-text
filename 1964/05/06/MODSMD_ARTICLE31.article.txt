## South Africa: Censorship Blocks Free Expression 
### HELEN BENJAMIN 
EDITOR'S NOTE: Tliis is the
first of three articles on South
Africa written by Helen Ben
jamin, veteran of Crossroads
Africa and head of this quar
ter's "South Africa Today" pro
gram.

Since the Africaner Nationalists
gained control of the South Afri
can government in 1918, no less
than eight major censorship laws
have been written into the statute
books. Their combined punch has
delt all but the most obsequious
a sobering pause. Where have the
major blows landed?
The Nationalist government is
fast establishing a totalitarian
pattern of censorship: it is at
tempting to suppress anything it
finds offensive or prevent its in
troduction altogether whether

newspaper, periodical, book,
movie, art work, record, or play.
The latest bill passed by Parlia
ment to further (his aim. the
Publications and Entertainment
Bill, would establish a "Publica
tions Control Board" to rule over
the desirability of publications to
circulate in the Republic.
"Undesirable" is partly defined
as "harmful to the relations be
tween any of the inhabitants of
Ihe Republic . . . prejudicial to the
safety of the state, the general
welfare, disturbing the peace or
good older, or is otherwise on any
ground objectionable." It is t li c
more blatent because it proposes
an explicit form of pre-publication
censorship. Prior approval would
have to be obtained rather than
following the channels of a judica
tion after an alleged abuse of a
specified law had occurred.

THE ENTERTAINMENT and
Publications Bill thus joins the
battery of South African censor
ship laws already eroding th e
channels of free expression, both
politically and culturally in South
Africa today.
Under the Suppression of Com
munism Act (1950) the Governor
General is empowered to suppress
any publication that he is satis
fied has among its purposes "to
propagate the principles or pro
mote the spread of communism or
further the achievement of any of
the objects" there defined as
i "communism."
The act was used in 1952 to ban
The Guardian, a left-wing weekly
; with a sizable European following.
When the same publication reap
peared with a new name, Ad
vanee, it was again banned. A
third attempt, New Age, survived
until 19G2 when the government
was sure it could prevent New
Age's recurrence. By virtue of the
j Sabotage Act (1962), the govern
ment has been empowered to pull
| the financial rug out from under
I a possible successor to New Age
whenever it choses to do so.
Under the pertinent section, new
| newspapers are required to reg
ister with the government and
i deposit an amount up to 20,000
Rand (approximately $30,000)
which will be forfeited if the news
paper is banned under the Sup
j pression of Communism Act.
i Quite a neat trick.

THE CRIMINAL LAW Amend
ment Act (1953) was a direct re
Isponse to the African National
Congress-Indian Congresses-spon
; sored Defiance Campaign of 1952.
The campaign's purpose had
been to protest the Union's un
just laws of segregation, curfews,
and passbooks imposed upon the
African and other non-Europeans.
Before it was over more than
S.OOO demonstrators had been ar
rested.
The act is a threat to free ex
pression as it provides that "any
person who . . . uses any language
or does any act or thing calculated
to cause any person or persons
in general to commit an offense
| by way of protest against a law
or in support of any campaign
against any law or in support of
any campaign for the repeal or
modification of any law or the
I variation or limitation of the ap
plication or administration of any
law shall be guilty of an offense
and liable upon conviction to (i)
a fine not exceeding 600 pounds;
or (ii) imprisonment not exceed
ing five years; or (iii) a whipping
not exceeding ten strokes; or (iv)
both such fine and such imprison
ment; or (v) both such fine a nd
such whipping; or (vi) both such
imprisonment and such a whip
ping."
(Floggings in South Africa are
now running at the rate of 80,-
000 strokes a year on 17,000 off
enders, an eight-fold increase in
the last twenty years. The Crimi
nal Law Amendment Act is only
one of many which employs flog
gings as an alternative punish
ment.)
★ ★ ★
THE CUSTOMS ACT (1955)
; prohibits importation into th e
Union of "goods which are inde
cent or obscene or on any ground
whatsoever objectionable unless
imported for research purposed
by educational institutions under
a permit issued by the Minister
of the Interior."
An "objectionable" publication
will appear in the Government
Gazette and "any person who
knowingly has in his possession
or deals in any such publications
shall be guilty of an offense and
liable on conviction to a fine of
one thousand pounds, or to im
prisonment for a period not ex
ceeding five years, or to both
such fine and imprisonment."
With over 8,000 titles (the
Catholic Index only has 5,000 and
that is soon to be halted), the
Government Gazette is a virtual
literary Who's Who. John Stein
beck, Richard Wright, Robert
Graves. D. H. Lawrence, Ernest
Hemingway, and Basil Davidson
are among the authors who have
had their writings circumscribed.
A good number of the banned
writings are serious sociological
works such as John Dollard's
Caste and Class in a Southern
i Town.
Even Africa Digest, a monthly
summary of events on the conti
nent published by the African Bu
reau in London was permanently
banned on the grounds that "the
general nature and tenor of read
j ing matter in the publication over
I a number of issues were such that
the entry thereof was considered
■to be prejudicial to the peace and

THE CRIMINAL LAW Amend

been to protest the Union's un
just laws of segregation, curfews,
and passbooks imposed upon the
African and other non-Europeans.
Before it was over more than
S.OOO demonstrators had been ar

The act is a threat to free ex

person who . . . uses any language
or does any act or thing calculated
to cause any person or persons
in general to commit an offense

or in support of any campaign

not exceeding ten strokes; or (iv)
both such fine and such imprison

The Nationalist government is
fast establishing a totalitarian

newspaper, periodical, book,

ground objectionable." It is t li c
more blatent because it proposes
an explicit form of pre-publication
censorship. Prior approval would
have to be obtained rather than
following the channels of a judica
tion after an alleged abuse of a
specified law had occurred.

THE ENTERTAINMENT and
