## Kaiser Story Intentional Misrepresentation Of Fact 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
During the three years that I
have been at Stanford, I have
noticed in the Daily many articles
demonstrating both inaccurate,
irresponsible reporting and lack
of editorial integrity. Perhaps a
majority of these cases could be
explained by lack of communica
tion, poor reporting, or simple
oversight; Monday, however, an
article appeared which can only
be construed as the results of in
tentional misrepresentation and
irresponsibility. I am referring to
the column entitled "Edgar Kaiser
Criticizes Daily."
This article quotes a state
ment released to the Daily by Ed
Kaiser with the explicit under
standing of both parties that it
would be printed on Tuesday, not
Monday, along with statements
by the other candidates. For the
Daily to quote fragments of this
statement out of context, before
the statement itself has been re
leased, witho u t Ed Kaiser's
knowledge or permission, seems
to me to be at best highly un- j
ethical and dishonest.
It is disappointing to see a news
paper run by college students of
reputed intelligence and respon
sibility react to serious criticism
by impugning the motives and
competence of the criticizer,
rather than attempting to answer
these criticisms with some degree
of objectivity. 1 would suggest
that the proper place for this
article (if, indeed, such an article
has a proper place in a respon
sible newspaper) is on the edi-1
torial page, with the author's by-1
line, AFTER the statement io
which it refers has been released. j
When a newspaper such as the i
Daily enjoys a journalistic mo-1
nopoly within a community, a \
great deal of responsibility is do- !
manded of the editors in present-!
ing news coverage with a mini- j
mum of editorial bias. Monday's i
article is a clear indication that !
this responsibility is not being!
cxercised.

EDITOR'S NOTES
• We agree with Mr. Cotton
that the Monday article was
only a fragmented version of
Edgar Kaiser's statement (al
though the statement had only
three sentences criticizing the
paper). We do not think this
was good journalism.
However, there is nothing
"highly unethical or dishonest"
about quoting the statement in
a news story. This is perfectly
valid journalism — especially
if the statement, as this one, is
newsworthy. There was never
an "explicit understanding" on
our part that the statement
could not l>e quoted elsewhere
as part of a news story or that
it could not he quoted in ad
vance of Tuesday.
Our reporter was sincere in
attempting to report Kaiser's
criticism of The Daily—a criti
cism which he had aired in the
campaign. The article was writ
ten also as an explanation for
our not having news coverage
or interview material on Kais
er's campaign. And that was en
tirely responsible journalism.
• Contrary to a dittoed sheet
l>eing circulated on campus (en
titled, "What The Daily Didn't
Print") —which states the above
letter was "submitted to The
Daily before 2:15 Monday" —
Mr. Cotton did not submit it to
us until after 8:80 p.m. Our edi
torial page, including the letters
column, had already l>ecn
processed by I p.m. Our editor
ial page copy must be at the
University Press by 8:">0 p.m.
Contrary to the inference of the
dittoed sheet, we do not tremble
at the prospects of running let
ters critical of us. If that were
the case, we would long a«;o
have developed a rather severe
case of apoplexy. All we ask is
that Mr. Cotton A: Co. not turn
in letters two hours alter our
latest deadline and then expect,
(hem to be published the next
da.v.
