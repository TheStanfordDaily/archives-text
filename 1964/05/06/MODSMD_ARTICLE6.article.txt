# Gratis Do Not Want Politics
## 
### 
"We want to stay out of poli
tics," was the viewpoint expressed
at yesterday's meeting of the
Graduate Student Association.
Members of the organization
emphasized that the proposed
formation of a commission or
council for the Association is in
no way an attempt to acquire for
the group powers of graduate stu
dent government.
THE WHOLE question to the
members of the group is only a
matter of how best to perform
their function: to provide an or
ganization for grad students that
will satisfy social and service
needs.
Accordingly, the proposed coun
cil or commission would have as
a primary function co-ordination
of inter-departmental activities.
By taking one member from each
of the graduate departments, it
would provide representation.
Examples of the service func
tions of tho Association are t he
group's sponsoring of temporary
dormitories and a pre-reg pro
gram for new graduate students
in the fall. Social functions are
the sponsorship of coffee hours,
happy hours, or any other activi
ties desired by the membership.
ONE OF THE eventual goals
of the group is the organization
of a graduate student center simi
lar in function to the I-Center. Ac
cording to one member, at present
"every grad students feels the
lack of such an organization."
