## Autonomy And Cooperation 
### JIM HAUSER 
Editor's Note: This is th<> last in a series of
articles on the candidates for ASSIJ President.

Individual initiative autonomy tempered by co
operation are the beams supporting Scott Mr-
Bride's platform for ASSU president.
Two examples of Mcßride's plans are the civil
rights secretariat and the rush system.
McBKIDF: WOULD transfer the ASSU civil
rights secretariat from ASSU to the Political
Union. At present, the secretarat is a civil rights
information dispensing agency created and fi
nanced by ASSU.
The agency collects and dispenses information
on both sides of the civl rights issue.
Meßride believes that "if it's going to take
action, it must be a voluntary group." The LASSU
constitution forbids an ASSU agency to be partial
or to use ASSU funds for active civil rights sup
port.
RUSH I'KOtiKAM, Meßride says, must be
determined by each living system separately. IFC,
IHC, and ICC must each be responsible for its own
policy but should have a voluntary clause "written
into the program of each system" to cooperate
with the other two systems. This will "give the

freshmen coordinated rush programs."
(LASSU is now considering a proposal to estab
lish a rush committee to develop one rush policy
for all three living systems.)
"The recommendations of freshmen and soph
omores, through the channel of a LASSU com
mittee, should definitely be considered; but . . .
the Stern Houses, Eating Clubs, and Fraternities
must be entirely responsible for their own rush
rules."
McKKIDK THINKS that LASSU cannot sub
mit opinions on "off-campus" issues because "the
expression of personal views about significant
matters . . . can only bo achieved through volun
tary groups ... or through a revitalized and
representative student congress . . ."
Religion is an example of an on campus issue
which LASSU may deal with, he said.
The Meßridc "machine" has close to 100 work
ers. Each living group has one representative.
Freshman residences have one for each floor.
The machine's candidate has been speaking 2-3
times a day for the past two weeks. "I haven't
eaten a meal here (Kappa Sigma) for about a
week a week and a half." lie also attends 2-3 or
ganizational meetings a da\
