Margaret Webster's anthology
of dramatic readings from Shake
speare was given lasl night be
fore a near-capacity Tuesday Eve

lecturer, author, and Shakespear
ean director, presented "His Infi
nite* Variety," one of the first
events of Stanford's pre-festival
program celebrating the quadri
centennial anniversary of Shake

MAK(iAKhiT Websler read se
lections from Shakespeare's ro
mances. comedies, and tragedies,
to illustrate his infinite variety,
ending the evening wilh Ihe final
words of the Egypt ion princess in
"Anthony and Cleopatra."
She opened with the prologues
lo "Henry V" and "Henry VII",
the difference 1 being thai in tlie
latter. Shakespeare "doesn't so
much ask the audience's help as
tell them how to behave."

Selections from "As You Like
It" showed theatre philosophy be
ing applied to the world and tin
scanning of two sonnets reflected
the poet's youthful exuberance at
St rat ford-on-Avon.
"lIK < KKATKI) every sort ot
man . . . caught in the passion of
love," she said, from young love
in "Romeo and Juliet." to exas
perated love in "Love's Labour's
Lost." to Porsha in "The Mer
chant of Venice" to laga, "one ol
the few wholly evil men Shake
speare ever drew." to whom "love
was another name for lust," in
"Othello."
she read Faistaff's speech i<
one "filled with his usual repre
hensible sentiments about alco
hoi which is suitable for a dry
campus," from one of Shake
speare's farcical plays and several
lines from the tragedies, in which
Shakespeare castigates mankind
yet treats them with much "com
passion and understanding"
