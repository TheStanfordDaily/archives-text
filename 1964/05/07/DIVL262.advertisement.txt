DOGMATIC ATHEISM
Among the atheists, there is a philosophical group which claims that there
definitely is no God and that this can be proved. Yet a little reasoning
will show that no one knows enough to conclusively prove that God does not
exist.
If a mail landed on a strange desert island, a footprint, a feather, a scratch
on the bark of a tree, or the upheaval of a little earth would be sufficient to
show that some living creature either inhabited the island or had visited it.
: But if such evidence were lacking and the explorer decided to prove that
there had never been any living creature on the island, this would be a much
more difficult task. He would have to traverse its length and breadth, in
| vestigatc every nook, cranny, and object. The larger the territory, the more
difficult it would be to prove this negative proposition.
For all practical purposes, it would be an impossible task for the dogmatic
atheist to prove that there definitely is no God. He would have to survey the
entire universe, boundless space and all of history—all events which have
occurred in time and all objects in space. In other words, before a mail could
safely affirm that there is no God, he would have to have seen the entire
universe and comprehended it all. He would have to be omnicient. Thus, we
sec the twisted end of the dogmatic atheists's reasoning: in order to prove
that there is no God. he would have to possess the capacities and attributes
of the God which he denies—omnicience, omnipresence, and infinite wisdom j
| and knowledge.
Christians are not disturbed by the assertions of the dogmatic atheists
because they realize that disbelief in the existence of a divine being is not
j equivalent to proof that there is no God. Jesus Christ told them:
'"Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free." (John 8:32)
I And down through the ages thousands have told the same story — that
they have had a personal encounter with Jesus Christ which changed their
I lives and drove away forever any doubts about the existence of God. They
have said something surprisingly audacious like this:
j "I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed . . (I Tiin. 1:12)
To many it may sound conceited and strange. But not to those who like
wise have had a personal experience with Jesus Christ: "This is eternal life:
to know thee who alone art truly God. and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent."
(John 17:3) N.E.
There is no reason for anyone to remain in doubt about the reality of the
living God or to he misled by those who say there is no God. God will reveal
Himself to anyone who will acknowledge Christ as I.ord and Saviour. Why
not let Jesus enter your heart today. The best way to prove there is a God
is to meet Him personally.
