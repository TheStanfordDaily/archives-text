# Golfers Risk 14-Year Win String At Cat
## 
### 
Stanford's golfers put an amaz
ing 14-year record of success
against Cal tomorrow when they
| meet the Bear stickmen on an
East Bay course.

The Indians haven't lost a dual
match to Cal since 19."i0, defeat
ing them earlier this year, 19-X.
Stanford coach Bud Finger is a
mite worried, though, because the
Bears have gradually been im
proving over the years, while the
Cards have been going downhill.
On Saturday, Stanford tussles
with unbeaten, untied San Jose
State on the Indians' course,
starting at noon. SJS won the
first match. 20-7. but Finger's
men arc ready for an upset.
TIIEY ALMOST got one last
week against USC down south.
The Trojans are about i ho host
in iho conference this year, but
Stanford had the match tied, 9-9,
going into the final two matches.
Only a lack of Stanford depth
gave SC a 1 (Â» 1 -10 1 win.
Next day, against an inferior
UCLA squad, the Tribe .just
couldn't get going again after
losing to USC, and the Bruins
sneaked by with an 18'--8 1 - vic
tory. The twin losses dropped the
Stanford record below .500.
Leading the Stanford team are
Jim Rheim and Jerry Hanweck.
Both have toured Stanford's
tough course in below-par rounds.
If the Indians are to win this
weekend, Finger says, these two
men will have to win most of the
points.
ENJOYING somewhat more
success are tiie freshman golfers,
whose record is 7-1. They face
Cal and San Jose also this week
end.
In the past, the frosh team
hasn't been able to win, but this
season's team, with Walter Driv
er. John Bottom ley, Bob Bou
cher, and Loy Martin leading the
way, offers Finger hope of fur
ther varsity success in the fu
ture.
