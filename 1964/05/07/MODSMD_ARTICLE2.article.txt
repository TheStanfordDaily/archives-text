# LSF Newspaper Walkout Protests Jesuit Control
## 
### JIM HORNE Managing Editor 
The stall of the University of San Francisco Foghorn lias
walked out in protest against appointment of an editor who alleg
edly sympathizes with administrative efforts "to reduce the paper
to a public relations blurb for the University.
Halpb Felieiello, business manager of the Foghorn, and sym-

pathetic to the cause of the rebels,"
estimated that 14 of the 18 mem
bers on the staff resigned when
the Board of Publications ap
pointed junior Donald Chase edi
tor last week. Only three mem-1
bers of the sports staff and a j
movie reviewer remained.
According to Feliciello, two
candidates applied for the editor
ship. "One," said Feliciello, "was
Gordon Bowker who stood for
the Foghorn as a free agent on
campus with the right to criti
cize where necessary and the
freedom to express editorial
opinion on any subject."
"Chase, however, maintained
that this was irresponsible jour
nalism." explained Feliciello. Sid
ing with administrative efforts
to prevent the newspaper from
becoming "an opinion sheet."
Chase asked in his first editorial,
"Where can we be safer than in
the arms of our Jesuit benefac
tors?"
THE BOARD of Publications,
consisting of six students, four
Jesuits, and the Dean of Students,
voted six to five in favor of
Chase.
Former assistant managing edi
tor Tom Fit/pat rick claimed that
Chase was pushed through the
Publications Board by Dean of
Students Father John Lo Shiavo
because Chase would "follow his
own (the Dean's) party line."
Chase has denied that he was
an administrative candidate, ex
plaining that students have a ma
jority of tlie votes on the Publi
cation Board and that "only two
of the four Jesuits voted for me."
"IT HAS BEEN charged," said
Chase in his editorial, "that t he
administration talked the present
editor (Chase) into running for
the post. We would like to point
out that the new editor has been
hungrily eyeing the editorial
chair ever since his freshman
year."
The recent debate over the role
of the newspaper on campus
stemmed from several stories and
editorials which have appeared
in the Foghorn during recent
weeks.
The paper had defended the
right of a student group to have
the anti-Catholic movie "Joan of
Angels" shown on campus and
had rapped administrative "pa
ternalism" after disqualification
of a candidate for (he student
body vice-presidency who h a d
staged a beer party in Golden
Gate Park as a campaign promo
tion.
THE ISSUE which contained
the editorial and a story about
1 h e vice-presidential candidate
was confiscated by a Student
Board of Control.

The stall of the University of San Francisco Foghorn lias
walked out in protest against appointment of an editor who alleg
edly sympathizes with administrative efforts "to reduce the paper
to a public relations blurb for the University.
Halpb Felieiello, business manager of the Foghorn, and sym-

pathetic to the cause of the rebels,"
estimated that 14 of the 18 mem
bers on the staff resigned when
the Board of Publications ap
pointed junior Donald Chase edi
tor last week. Only three mem-1
bers of the sports staff and a j
movie reviewer remained.
According to Feliciello, two
candidates applied for the editor
ship. "One," said Feliciello, "was
Gordon Bowker who stood for
the Foghorn as a free agent on
campus with the right to criti
cize where necessary and the
freedom to express editorial
opinion on any subject."
"Chase, however, maintained
that this was irresponsible jour
nalism." explained Feliciello. Sid
ing with administrative efforts
to prevent the newspaper from
becoming "an opinion sheet."
Chase asked in his first editorial,
"Where can we be safer than in
the arms of our Jesuit benefac
tors?"
THE BOARD of Publications,
consisting of six students, four
Jesuits, and the Dean of Students,
voted six to five in favor of
Chase.
Former assistant managing edi
tor Tom Fit/pat rick claimed that
Chase was pushed through the
Publications Board by Dean of
Students Father John Lo Shiavo
because Chase would "follow his
own (the Dean's) party line."
Chase has denied that he was
an administrative candidate, ex
plaining that students have a ma
jority of tlie votes on the Publi
cation Board and that "only two
of the four Jesuits voted for me."
"IT HAS BEEN charged," said
Chase in his editorial, "that t he
administration talked the present
editor (Chase) into running for
the post. We would like to point
out that the new editor has been
hungrily eyeing the editorial
chair ever since his freshman
year."
The recent debate over the role
of the newspaper on campus
stemmed from several stories and
editorials which have appeared
in the Foghorn during recent
weeks.
The paper had defended the
right of a student group to have
the anti-Catholic movie "Joan of
Angels" shown on campus and
had rapped administrative "pa
ternalism" after disqualification
of a candidate for (he student
body vice-presidency who h a d
staged a beer party in Golden
