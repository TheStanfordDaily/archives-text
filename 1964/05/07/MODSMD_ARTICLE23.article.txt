## A 						Confused Columnist 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In his column "A Confused
Presidential Campaign," Foil Pon
der (sic) states that he is con- i
fused. Ho then goes on to prove j
ii with an array of babblings that i
lead lo a conclusion supported
only by his confusion.
First, wo are told that tliore is j
no ideological difference between j
Kaiser and Bryson: each has tak- !
en a similar stand on a Student !
Bill of Rights, etc. Now, what dif- j
ferences do exist? Well, Bryson
has distinguished himself by be-j
ing an honors student and by be
ing "president of something every
year lie's been at Stanford." Kais
er has not distinguished himself
except that he has been on a stu
dent advisory committee. So let's
support Kaiser because he ha s
less experience. Also, he ran Axe
Com and that makes him inordi
nately cool.
BRYSON HAS RUN a straight
forward campaign. That's bad.
Kaiser has had an unusual one: he
held back and then flooded the
market. Isn't that wonderful?
Perhaps the most exotic part of
his campaign is that he has been
accused of fraud, duplicity, by the
Daily. Let's support Kaiser be
cause he isn't, always straight
forward.
Kaiser is said to represent a
"pragmatic change," More im
portant, he is "qualified in more
ways than one for coexisting with
the administration without loss
to students."
So far, Fender has not shown
us even a glimpse of Kaiser's ex
perience and neither has Kaiser.
Further, if both Kaiser and Bry- j
son have the same platforms, why
does Kaiser represent a "prag :
matic change?"
