## Fair Housing Legislation And The CREA Initiative If Passed, Makes Discrimination Constitutional 
### ROBERT McAFEE BROWN 
Despite all attempts to demonstrate the con
trary, the central issue at stake in Ihe CREA
Initiative vote is not the nature of the Rum
ford Fair Housing Act. but the nature of the
Initiative itself. Whether one thinks the Rum
ford Act is good or bad, whether one is a Re
publican or a Democrat, a liberal or a conser
vative, he should work for the defeat of the
Initiative.
1. A clear grasp of the Initiative is made
difficult by ihe smokescreen of distortion and
false issues created by Ihose supporting the
Initiative. It is falsely charged, for example,
that the Rumford Act is a "forced housing" act.
It is falsely charged that those "prosecuted"
under it will be tried by "kangaroo courts." It
is falsely alledged that the Rumford Act is simi
lar to a recently defeated Berkeley Housing
Ordinance.
THE FALSE ISSUE of "absolute property
rights" is constantly invoked, as though prop
erty rights were ever "absolute." A Baptist
minister in Burbank is claiming that the Rum
ford Act is "communist-inspired." Real estate
men charge that opponents of the Initiative
are "demagogues." Other assert that "moral
ity cannot be legislated." without going on to
point out that immoral practices (such as the
affront to human dignity expressed in racial
segregation) can be curbed by legislation.
Such tactics are disturbing examples of an
attempt to divert the attention of voters from
the true nature of the CREA Initiative. Atten
tion must be focussed on it.
2. The Initiative is in reality legislation de
signed to benefit a special interest group,
chiefly tract developers and landlords. It grants
this group exemption from legislative action
designed for the common good. If the Initia
tive passes, neither state, country nor city gov
ernment will be able in the future to enact any
legislation dealing with the right of a tract de
veloper or landlord ". . . to decline to sell, lease
or rent such property to such person or per
sons as he, in his absolute discretion, chooses."
(bold face added.)
That such a group should be given prefer
ential treatment denied to other groups is a
denial of the democratic concept of fair play
and equal privilege for all groups. Further
more, if one special interest group can thus
remove itself from the realm of possible legis
lation designed for the good of all, other special
interest groups will seek similar immunities
for themselves in the future.
3. The Initiative will freeze present inequi
ties in housing opportunities, and thus in effect
build racial segregation into the state con
stitution. It will ensure that no legal steps can
be taken in the future to make available to all
persons the housing privileges now available
only to some.
THE "ABSOLUTE DISCRETION" that can
be exercised by the seller makes it possible for
him to refuse housing to persons solely on the
basis of race or color. This has been the hous
ing pattern in the past; the Initiative would
insure that it remain the housing pattern in
the future.
It would make the "right" of discrimination
a constitutional right, foster the continuation of
segregated patterns of housing, and make pos
sible any legal means of working to remove
such patterns. I see no way in which a sup
porter of the Initiative can deny that it legis
lates in favor of continued racial segregation.
The Initiative is thus legislation for a spe
cial interest group, and legislation against racial
minority groups.
4. But Californians must also face the dis
astrous consequences that will follow in the
civil rights struggle elsewhere if the Initiative
is adopted. Until now it has been possible to
say to minority groups, "The law works in your
favor. Every legal decision is helping to bring
about the extension of equal rights for all
groups."
But if the Initiative is adopted, and Cali
fornia incorporates racial discrimination into
its constitution, minority groups will have
every right to say, "The promise of increasing
help through law was a lie. The California
constitution now works not as an instrument
of equal privilege for all people, but of special
privilege for white people."
Most political issues are morally ambiguous.
This one is unequivocally clear-cut. Fortun
ately. the Initiative is being opposed by increas
ing numbers of Catholic priests, Protestant
ministers, Jewish rabbis, and their religious
bodies. It is an issue on which all men of good
will, who believe in the dignity of every person
and not just the dignity of some persons, can
join forces to work for the Initiative's defeat.
Those who do not will become guilty of what
Martin Luther King described last week at
Stanford as "the appalling silence of the good
people."
The effect of the Initiative, then, will be to
legislate for a special interest group, to give
constitutional approval to discriminatory prac
tices, and to serve notice to all minority groups
that their incredible patience through a hun
dred years of indignity is being answered with
a slap in the face.
On all of these counts, the Initiative must be
defeated.

THE QUESTION: Should tin

ciation Initiative oil the Novell!
