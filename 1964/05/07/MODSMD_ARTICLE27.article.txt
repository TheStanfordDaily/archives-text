# Property Rights Of Individuals Threatened
## 
### HENRY U. CHASE 
Realtors from all over America are con
cerned about the attack on private property
rights by various branches of government.
They believe the general public does not
realize that their individual freedom is being
destroyed by laws like the Rumford forced
housing act, which grants special rights to spe
cial groups of people. They think the voting
public is entitled to understand and realize that
their inherent and basic lights and their God
given freedom is under attack.
The contention of realtor Floyd Lowe that
the matter is one properly to be decided by the
legislature is expressly denied. Our basic rights
to life, liberty and property do not stem from
government. To the contrary, both state and
federal Constitutions expressly deny to gov
ernment all authority to interfere or to abridge
the rights and freedom of the' people. Freedom
and rights are inherent in the individual and
are derived from higher authority.
Opponents of the referendum on the Rum
ford Bill are fond of deploring the fact that
the new Constitutional Amendment would de
prive the legislature of any right to enact future
legislation in the field of private property. It
should be emphasized hero that the legislature
never has had and does not now have this
power.
The preamble to the Stale Constitution
speaks of inalienable rights. They are rights
retained by the people with the right of en
croachment by government specifically denied.
Property rights more correctly stated as the
human right to own and use property are
among the basic human rights retained by the
people. We cannot, in truth therefore speak
of taking away or of abridging such powers of
the legislature as are and always have been
nonexistent.
CHURCHES ANI) denominations which
been swept into this all absorbing preoccupa
tion with so called Civil Rights legislation have
forsaken the way shown by the Gospel of
Christ. By their constant agitation and partici
pation in unlawful mob demonstrations and
their pressing for more and more restrictive
measures on the majority of the people they
confess that they have lost faith in Ihe power
of the Gospel of Christ to change men from
within and thus inevitably to change outward
social relationships — and yet human toler
ance, understanding and love is the only way
the problem of social equality will ever be
solved: Legalism in this area destroys and en
slaves by giving power to government to dii-ect
the lives of men - the result of which is des
potism and totalitarian government.
Regrettably, the civil rights movement ap
pears to have been seduced by self-seeking
politicians and demagogues who would cure all
social ills by passing laws and spending the
taxpayers' money. But there are many social
ills which cannot be cured by these means, as
witnessed by the failure of FEPC and fair
housing legislation in other states to signifi
cantly improve the economic condition of min
ority groups.
There can be little doubt that the Rumford
Act — together with the Federal Civil Rights
legislation is basically Communist inspired. It
serves too well the cause of race and class strug
gle which has been a major tenet of the Commu
nist Line for over 40 years. The Communists
and their fellow travelers plan to intensify the
social struggle until the whole nation is caught
in social upheaval and anarchy at which time
they expect to move in and take command and
mercilessly destroy all opposition including the
churches that now unwittingly serve their
cause.
GOVERNOR BROWN has said that the
Initiative if successful will permanently legalize
bigotry in race relations. It will do no such
thing. It provides equality under law for all
citizens, leaving (he moral issue of religious
and racial descrimination to be resolved by
individuals and not: by legislative force.
The great Negro educator and founder of
Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, Booker T.
Washington, once said, "The wisest among my
race understand that agitation of questions of
social equality is the extremist folly, and that
progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges
that will come to us must be the result of
severe and constant struggle rather than of arti
ficial forcing. No race that has anything to
contribute to the markets of the world is long
in any degree ostracized.
"It is important and right that all privileges
of the law be ours, but it: is vastly more im
portant that we be prepared for the exercise
of these privileges." Will it be said that wisdom
is obsolete because it was uttered a few decades
ago? Do we revere any less the fundamental
principles of justice written into the Constitu
tion of the United States and into the Constitu
tion of the State of California along with the
ten amendments known as the Bill of Rights
just because much time has elapsed since they
were adopted?
The Rumford Housing Act would control all
property owners including ultimately those it
has now singled out for special privilege treat
ment. The only winner in big bureaucratic
government, the loser, all Californians.
It is therefore an imperative of our time
that the Rumford forced housing measure bo
expunged for all time from the statute books.
It is indeed disturbing to note that the propo
nents of this measure remain unabashed in
taking a position which ignores the Constitu
tional Rights of every citizen of California.
