### 
The Rumford Fair Housing: Act
(Assembly Bill 1240) begins
with this preamble:
"The practice of discrimination
because of race, color, religion,
national origin or ancestry in
housing accommodation is de
clared to lie against public policy.
"This part shall be deemed an
exercise of the police power of
the state for the protection of the
welfare, health and peace of the
people of this state."
The scope of the law:
HOUSING COVERED
All pubicly-assisted (FHA, VA,
Cal Vet) single family dwellings
occupied by the owner.
All publicly-assisted housing in
use or to be used for a multiple
dwelling.
All multiple dwellings of five
or more units.
HOUSING NOT COVERED
No n- pr of i t accommodations
operated by religious, fraternal
or charitable operations when
the housing is used "in further
ance of the primary purposes of
the organization."
Single family dwelling without
public financing.
ACTS PROHIBITED
It is illegal in dealings involv
ing housing covered by the ad
to refuse to sell or rent to any
one because of race, color, reli
gion, national origin or ancestry.
It is unlawful to discriminate
against any person in setting
terms, conditions or privileges of
multiple dwellings or in financ
ing of housing by banks or other
lending institutions.
Real estate brokers and sales
men are specifically prohibited
from discriminating in any trans
action.
The California Fair Employ
ment I* ract i c e s Commission
(FEPC) enforces the Rumford
Act
The FEPC is given power to
issue cease and desist orders to
persons found violating the law.
FEPC can require violators to (1)
sell or rent the housing in ques
tion to the complainant, or (2)
sell or rent similar housing if
the original unit is not available,
or (3) pay up to $">OO to the com
plainant.
On finding that "probable
cause" exists, the FEPC has the
right to obtain a temporary order
in Superior Court restraining the
owner for up to 30 days from
doing anything with his property.
The right to appeal the FEPC
decision is written into the law.
To use the law, a citizen must,
within 60 days after the alleged
discrimination, file a written and
verified complaint with the
FEPC. In so doing, the complain
ant waives his right to take court
action under other state antidis
crimination laws.
The FEPC under the Rumford
Act also is given powers to
"create such advisory agencies
and conciliation councils, local or
otherwise, as in its .judgment will
aid in effectuating the purposes
of the antidiscrimination law."
