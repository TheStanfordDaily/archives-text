# Bonine Wins YR Election
## 
### 
John Bonine, columnist for the
j Stanford Daily, was unanimously
I elected President of the 250-mem
ber Stanford Area Young Repub
licans last night.
Bonine, who has just completed
| a term, as State Director, Area 3,
! of the California Young Repub
lican College Federation pledged j
that the SAYR's will become in
creasingly active both on campus
and off campus. SAYR Executive
Board members are working in
the campaigns of three of the
four candidates for ASSU presi
dent.
"However, our efforts, will re
main in the realm of partisan
politics as a volunteer arm of the
Republican party. The SAYR's
will take an active part in the
1964 election campaign."
The SAYR's are the largest
Y.R. club west of the Rocky
Mountains, according to the cre
dentials report of the most recent
state convention. Bonine set a
goal of 300 members for next
year.
He said the speaker program
will be stepped up, with seminars
j on issues such as the Rumford
Act. foreign policy, campaign
strategy and practical politics.
The most important part of the
SAYR's activity is, however, elec
'ton work. Bonine said that they
| had distributed over 75,000 pieces
! of literature in the 19G2 campaign.
The next SAYR program will
: be senatorial c audi d a t e Lee
Kaiser who will speak on May 20.
There were some skirmishes
for the other offices, with P. J.
DeWolf elected executive vice
president, and Gar r ett Pagon and
Paul Finney elected membership
and program vice presidents, re
spectively.
Others elected were Darryl
Wold, treasurer; Karen Bisgaard,
corresponding secretary; and Jim
DeCou'cey, Carl Anderson. Pat
Halligan, Jacki Sedore, Linda
I Clements, Sharon Crawford, and
j Mike Hall, executive board mem-
I bers.
