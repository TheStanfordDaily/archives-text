# Legislature Defeats Rush Committee Resolution
## Revises Judicial Procedure 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
LASSU buried the long-dying
rush committee proposal last
night, in response to strong fra
ternity pressure. The proposal,
despite attempts by the By-laws
Committee to reach a suitable
compromise, failed to satisfy a
simple majority of the Legisla
ture, failing by a 20-33 vote.
Bob Curry, in a last attempt
to produce some kind of Legisla
tive action, succeeded to getting
approval of an amendment chang
ing what had started out as a by
laws change into a resolution sug
gesting the proposal to the Dean
of Men. After approving the
amendment. LASSU defeated the
resolution.
But try as they could, the Leg
islature simply couldn't get rush
out of their minds. No sooner
than they defeated the rush com
mittee proposal than three fresh
men representatives proposed a
by-law establishing a draw sys
tem for upperclass men's living
groups.
Since the proposal would elimi
nate fraternities, and eating clubs
as they now exist, their repre
sentatives were highly perturbed
by the proposal. However, it was
referred to the By-laws Commit
tee by a 31-11 vote.
By-laws Committee also report
ed out the proposals made two
weeks ago on revising certain
aspects of the judicial set-up. The
propose 1 had been made in re
sponse to inadequacies shown by
the Morse case.
The proposal requires overseas
judicial councils to keep their
records, and to file a copy with
the judicial council here.
Steve Stern proposed one
amendment granting students the
right of appeal to the Judicial
Council if an infraction occurs
in the last ten days of the second
quarter at an over-seas campus.
LASSU approved the amend
ment which was designed to pre
vent any reccurance of the con
fusion which marked the Morse
suspension.
The legislature spent most of
the evening refering matters to
the By-laws Committee, pausing
only while Ed Shaw, student fi
nancial manager, and the LASSU
Finance Committee straightened
out some financial matters,
mainly in the realm of account
juggling.
A proposal which the Legisla
ture had put into the By-laws Com
mittee last week, came back out
and was promptly tabled for fur
ther study. The proposal which
would have changed the Wilbur
Sponsor's Selection Committee to
consist of three sponsors, one rep
resentative of the Dean, and the
IFC, lIIC, and the ICC Presidents,
had been reported out unfavor
ably by the By-Laws Committee.
A report on the work of the
Civil Rights Secretariat was read,
detailing the expenses of the Sec
retariat, and its expected future
expenses.
A resolution requiring that all
ASSU boards a n d commissions
keep complete records was passed.
The files in the past have been
inaccurate so that it's been diffi
cult to determine what the ac
tivities of those bodies have been.
