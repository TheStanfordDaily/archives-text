Rafael Monde/, the golden
notecl trumpeter who was called
"the greatest trumpeter in the
world" by the late conductor Ed
win Franko Goldman, will be the
guest artist at the annual Spring
Concert of the Menlo-Atherton
High School band at 8 p.m. to
night in the high school
gymnasium. The concert will be
conducted by the band's instruc
tor, Donald Harriss.
Mendez, now a Southern Cali
fornia resident, exhibited his mu
sical talent at a very early age
in his native Mexico. When he
was only 10 he spent six months
as a "guest musician" with the
Mexican bandit chief Pancho
Villa. He now attracts thousands
to concerts with the clarity of his
open horn tone and his spectac
ular tonguing of the instrument.
The program for the gala band
concert will include Monti's
"Czardas," "Londonderry Air,"
Saint-Saen's "First Symphony in
E Flat" and Mozart's "Trauermu
sik." The Menlo-Atherton High
School band is widely known for
the musical quality of its per
formances.
The concert admission will be
$1.50 for adults and $1 for stu
dents. Reserved seats are $1.75.
