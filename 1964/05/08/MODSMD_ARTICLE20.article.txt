# Tribe In Relays
## 
### 
The rlual moot phase of tho
track team's schedule has ended,
and tho season is all but over.
Beginning with the West Coast
Relays at Fresno this weekend,
Payton Jordan's troops will com
pete in live more meets, the last
of which are tho NCAA Cham
pionships at Eugene, Oregon the
weekend of June 18.
Coach Jordan has named a 24-
man team to compote at Fresno,
and ho will spread them out over
every event except tho high
jump.
Terming his squad "a cham
pionship lype team" because of
its solid performers in some
events but lack of depth in
others, he thinks ilio squad's dual
meet record of four wins against
three losses is not an indication
of how Stanford will do in tho
weeks ahead. It will, he thinks,
be battling San Jose St.. Fresno
St., and USC for the college title
at Fresno, the Indians lost out
to the Trojans, ."56-53. USC has

won 19 straight Fresno titles.
With many Olympic hopefuls
suited up for action, the competi
tion will be stiff in all events.
Stove Cortright, entered in both
tho triple jump and the 120-yard
high hurdles, could be a double
winner.
Me has had little stiff competi
tion this campaign and his log
has been bothering him, but his
leg seems to be in good shape,
he won't bo lacking for competi
tion, and he could possibly soar
49 feet and break tho II second
barrier in his specialty.
Tho two relay teams Jordan is
depending on to show well are the
distance medley and two-mile re
lay quartets. Tho medley group
of Ken Fraser, Bill Pratt, Ilarlan
Andrews, and Paul Schlicke has
run a 9:46.2 in its only timing
this year, second best in tin 1 na
tion.
Pratt and Andrews will com
bine with Bob Milt/, and Harry
McCalla to form a formidable
two-mile relay group whose best
effort has boon a 7:17.8.
Two stars of tho freshman
squad which compiled a 6-1 sea
son in duel meet competition will
make tho trip. Bruce Wilholm has
put tho shot 56' 2U" so far this
year and has tho strength to go
60'. Jim Eshelman vaulted 14'
7U" and is tho second best vani
ter on tho Farm behind Chuck
Smith.

Pratt and Andrews will com
bine with Bob Milt/, and Harry
McCalla to form a formidable
two-mile relay group whose best
effort has boon a 7:17.8.
Two stars of tho freshman
squad which compiled a 6-1 sea
son in duel meet competition will
make tho trip. Bruce Wilholm has
put tho shot 56' 2U" so far this
year and has tho strength to go
60'. Jim Eshelman vaulted 14'
7U" and is tho second best vani
ter on tho Farm behind Chuck
Smith.
The rlual moot phase of tho
track team's schedule has ended,
and tho season is all but over.
Beginning with the West Coast
Relays at Fresno this weekend,
Payton Jordan's troops will com
pete in live more meets, the last
of which are tho NCAA Cham
pionships at Eugene, Oregon the
weekend of June 18.
Coach Jordan has named a 24-
man team to compote at Fresno,
and ho will spread them out over
every event except tho high
jump.
Terming his squad "a cham
pionship lype team" because of
its solid performers in some
events but lack of depth in
others, he thinks ilio squad's dual
meet record of four wins against
three losses is not an indication
of how Stanford will do in tho
weeks ahead. It will, he thinks,
be battling San Jose St.. Fresno
St., and USC for the college title
at Fresno, the Indians lost out
to the Trojans, ."56-53. USC has

won 19 straight Fresno titles.
With many Olympic hopefuls
suited up for action, the competi
tion will be stiff in all events.
Stove Cortright, entered in both
tho triple jump and the 120-yard
high hurdles, could be a double
winner.
Me has had little stiff competi
tion this campaign and his log
has been bothering him, but his
leg seems to be in good shape,
he won't bo lacking for competi
tion, and he could possibly soar
49 feet and break tho II second
barrier in his specialty.
Tho two relay teams Jordan is
depending on to show well are the
distance medley and two-mile re
lay quartets. Tho medley group
of Ken Fraser, Bill Pratt, Ilarlan
Andrews, and Paul Schlicke has
run a 9:46.2 in its only timing
this year, second best in tin 1 na
tion.
