# Batsmen Meet SC
## 
### 
The Sunken Diamond will bo
the scene of three big CIBA bat
tles as USC, probably behind the
strong pitching arm of Walt
Peterson, will take on tho In
dians this afternoon at 3 p.m. and
Santa Barabara will arrive for
a doubleheader tomorrow.
Although only three victories
have come Stanford's way in the
tough CIBA conference, a good
weekend could boost it into
fourth place.
Stanford has played wo 1 I
against USC, and in the three
games played two were decided
by one run. Peterson, whose
stuff has boon responsible for
several key victories over Santa
Clara, will probably also pitch in
tomorrow's doublehead which are
the last games in the Trojans
regular season. Dick Kovacovieh
will be on the mound for the
Indians.
Doubleheaders have not been a
Stanford strong point this season
as Santa Barbara, USC, an d
UCLA have all taken two in an
afternoon from Tribe batsmen.
The pitchers for Stanford Sat
urday will be John Mason and
Bob Hartwig. Mason has pitched
well recently but has not received
good support. Against Cal, he lost
a 2-0 game in the last two innings.
Hartwig has also pitched well of
late, and Fohring thinks he de
serves another chance as a
starter.
Hendriekson and Foster wore
UCSB's winning pitchers for tho
last doubleheader, the former al
lowing but throe hits, all by Jim
Hibbs.
