## Schoolnik Explains Rights Secretariat 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Because (he status of the Stan
ford Civil Rights Secretariat has
become an issue in the current
ASSU presidential campaigns,
the following will attempt to
clarify the charge given to the
Secretariat by LASSU and the
position of the organisation with
regard to the Board of Trustees
Policy Statement of March 21,
1963 on student organizations.
The policy statement reads:
Students are encouraged to
study, discuss, debate and be
come knowledgeable about con
temporary affairs. The ex
pressing of opinions or taking
of positions with respect to
these matters is up to the
individual student or to vol
unteer groups of students so
constituted that they are au
thorized to speak for their
member. This is not a function
of student government at Stan
ford.
All students are required to
become members of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford
University, which represents
them with respect to student
affairs on the Stanford campus.
The student government, under
this policy, is not authorized
to speak for students on other
matters.
The Secretariat was formed be
cause of the interest and concern
manifested on the part of a large
number of Stanford students in
the contemporary civil rights
movement in general and th e
Mississippi summer project in
particular.
As stated in t lie information
brochure published by the Secre
tariat: "The only involvement of
ASSU as a body will be to re
spond to the immense interest
demonstrated by the student
body . . . by making available all
information about summer proj
ects." That is. the purpose of the
Secretariat is to provide those
students contemplating their ac
tive involvement in the move
ment, with sufficient information
for them to make a responsible
decision based on objective a n d
complete evidence.
The charge given to the Secre
tariat then is essentially one of
information dispensation, both
to the Stanford community and
to interested parties that lie with
out the Stanford community. It
is non-partisan in nature, and
does not seek to promote any par
ticular project or point of view.
As a purely informative organi
zation. it falls within the frame
work delimited by the trustees
policy statement.
The central portion of that
statement is especially concerned
with "expressing of opinion," and
to "taking positions." The civil
rights Secretariat is not em
powered to take any official
stands for the students of this
University; its purpose is to
meet certain needs that have
arisen as a result of stands that
individuals have taken. The for
mal charge of the civil rights Sec
retariat is as follows:
To make available and di s
pense information to all inter
ested parties, concerning the
available work and education
opportunities in the South (as
explicated at greater length in
(he Secretariat's information
brochure) and to refrain from
promotion of its aims and pur
poses insofar as this promotion
would subject unwilling indi
viduals to undesired conse
quences.
In contrast with the activities
of the Secretariat, the Stanford

| Civil Liberties Caucus, which is
presently submitting its constitu
tion to the Deans Office for ap-!
proval, is interested in the active
promotion and direct involvement
of its members and others of the
Stanford Community in the vari
ous facets of the civil rights
movement.
It presents programs of a parti- \
sail nature with a view toward;
changing opinions, and unlike the :
Secretariat, is not responsible to
LASSU. It is primarily not ad- j
ministrativc as is the Secretariat,
but is a membership organization
actively involving itself as a vol- j
untary group in the promotion of !
the ideals of the movement.
It is hoped that the above clari
fies the diverse interest of the
Secretariat and the Civil Liber
ties Caucus. Both organizations
: have their own particular purvue
| and as such, answer different
needs of the Stanford Commu
ity. There is, therefore, abundant i
cause for both organizations to
be maintained in their present
status during the following year.

• Dr. Frulla
Editor, The Daily:
The article "Discussion Con
tinues in Morse Controversy," re-
I porting in your May 4 issue a
KZSU editorial commentary, con
tains a passage which does grave
injustice to Professor Frulla and [
(which, insofar as it concerns me
directly, I have a duty to correct, i
The passage refers to " . . . j
j Frulla's behavior in an earlier
suspension case, in group six. j
Here the student council rendered
as heavy a verdict as possible >
short of suspension. Frulla ad
vised council members to recon
sider the case on the grounds that
| all four faculty members had
agreed that suspension was |
I called.
The council, feeling that they
had let the faculty down, recon
j sidered the case and asked for
' suspension, only to have it later
revealed that one of the faculty
had not been in favor of suspen
sion and had made his feelings
explicit. Thus the program estab
i lished a precedent for Frulla's be
havior stating that 'all agree'
when in fact all do not agree."
Though the facts reported are
true, because they are incomplete,
(he conclusion drawn from the
facts is false. It is true that "one
of the faculty had not been in
favor of suspension and had made
his feelings explicit." I happen
1 to be the one. It is not true that
I this establishes "a precedent for
Frulla's behavior stating that 'all
; agree' when in fact all do not
j agree."
This apparent contradiction is
explained by the fact that before
taking up the case, the Faculty
| Council unanimously agreed to
make its decision unanimous: re
gardless of conflicting opinions
during discussions, the minority
was to endorse the majority view.
It is important to stress that this
preliminary decision was neither
requested nor suggested by Pro- j
! fessor Frulla.
As a matter-of-fact, I believe I
must be held responsible for
| originating what appears to me
now as ;> questionable suggestion.
The point is that, despite my dis
agreement. Professor Frulla com
mitted no impropriety in inform
ing the Student Council that "all
agreed:" all members of the Fac
! ulty Council did agree to turn

out a unanimous decision, includ
ing myself, and Professor Frulla
was simply carrying out the
Council's instructions in making
the announcement he made.
Though I can not pass judg
ment on the merits of Mr. Morse's
case, I believe that six months
at the "Villa" place me in a good
position to evaluate certain gen
eralizations made in your column,
about Stanford-in-Italy and about
its academic director.
Since I know your space is
limited. I shall restrict myself to
one similar incident, which does
not confirm the program's conten
tion that "Frulla had, in the past
become extremely excited by in
cidents of minor property dam
age."
At the end of last year's Spring
quarter, I happened to witness an
incident in which a student found
release from the accumulated
pressure of examination week
and from the disappointment of a
grade below expectations by
smashing two chairs in the Villa's
garden.
I advised him to anticipate
Council action by taking the initi
ative to personally inform Profes
sor Frulla of the incident, and by
offering apologies as well as
compensation.
This he did and, to my knowl
edge, the matter was settled and
closed then and there: apologies
w ere accepted, no disciplinary
action taken, and, if I am no t
wrong, no compensation re
quested, all of which hardly
agrees with the KZSU conclusion
about Professor Frulla's "ex
tremely excited reaction to minor
property damage" in the past.
This is only one among many
reasons why I do not recognize
the man I know in the emotional
and insensitive ogre depicted in
your pages for the benefit of the
campaign on Mr. Morse's behalf.
It would be sad if injustice to
Dr. Frulla were the price to be
paid for justice to Mr. Morse.

• Enciiia Gallery
Editor, the Daily:
Mr. Wehrli's criticisms natur
ally reflect his taste, cultural
level, and awareness of the his
tory of art, and are perfectly
valid in the specific context. They
ai'e, in my opinion, irrelevant to
much of the art of the past half
century, including that of Mr.
Harshbarger.
The significant point made by
his outburst, however, is of some
consequence : the lack of ade
quate gallery space and other
facilities for serious students of
the visual arts at this University
is rather appalling. Certainly En
cina is not the ideal environment
for small shows of student work,
but it seems to be the only place
made available.
A room or two converted into
a small gallery for the graduate
students would be far more suit
table, as well as shielding th e
"average eyes" of personalities
such as Mr. Wehrli.

• Revealed Truths
Editor, The Daily:
As has long been marked by
observers of such phenomena,
the manifest answer to the ques
tion fashioned in Miss Bozman's
column of May 1 is that in the
democratic society a general con
sensus determines certain funda
mentals of belief, which are then
removed from further considera
tion.
Any efforts to drag these Re
vealed Truths back into the arena
can only be interpreted by the
majority as wanton aggression,
an act of perfidy beyond atone
ment. Only when these points of
orthodoxy are not in question can
a certain diversity be indulged.
Unfortunately, the elite can
take no comfort in believing that
this malady is confined to the
uninitiated or to the canaille,
wallowing in ignorance of some

necessary connection between
democracy and liberty.
Look at the astounding invec
tive, the accusations of being one
with the Devil (in his secularized,
updated form as a reactionary
white suprcmatist who is enrap
tured by butchery) that were
hurled against tho heretic who
denied the original sin of a sus
piciously unproductive intelli
gentsia.
Consider, even more patently,
the demand th a t Encina be
purged of paintings offensive to
Renaissance taste, an action
against contamination by that
which is alien.

• Ay 11 Hand
! I'Mitor, The Daily:
Ayn Rand belittles involvement
with people because, she says,
when you become involved with
people, you gel nothing back in
return; whereas with machines
and ideas, tangible returns are
possible, and man is basically
selfish.
All right. Granted: man is
basically selfish. But why does
Rand not acknowledge the fact
that to allow a person to be de
pendent on you, to help him,
when done in the right way, re
sults in his growth and develop
ment to tiio point where he can
stand alone, independent?
Why does she not acknowledge
; the immense satisfaction that ■
! comes from being a part of 1 his j
| process: seeing another person)
I grow and develop successfully j
i because of your own involvement
and risk?
Rand clearly and rightly points
out the perversions of this "sac
i rifice:" people who would "help"
j others out of guilt or fear, but
' without risking any threat of
their own security, which comes
i from detachment. She acknowl
edges the satisfaction that comes
from risk and involvement in de
veloping a successful material
creation or idea. Why not the
same for another person? Is not
this satisfaction a worthwhile re
i turn?
She fears such an involvement.
She finds involvement in mate
rial things and abstractions safer
{than involvement with people.
' She finds that machines and ideas
are always under control. They
will never make any demands on
{ her beyond what she wants to
give.
But people are less dependable.
| They may make demands on you
1 which you cannot meet. Or they
J may suddenly create a situation
which you cannot handle. Or they
may do things which are con
trary to the goals you are trying
to achieve by your involvement.
They are unpredictable. You
cannot control them; you can
only offer them a base of secur
ity from which they can develop
the potential inherent in every
one of them, Ayn Rand does not
have the guts to offer this base.
So she cannot achieve the sat
isfaction of seeing it work — a
more authentic and deeper satis
faction than can come from a
machine, because a human being
has greater potential than a
machine. She denies the possibil
ity of that satisfaction to avoid
recognizing her fear.
She points out the guilt that
arises when a person denies him
self his potential, and then goes
on to deny her own human poten
tial with her notion of "freedom
of action."
No man has the "freedom" to
do anything lie wants to do or to
be anything he wants to be. He
only has the freedom to become
what lie really is. The other is
not freedom at all. It is a com
pulsive attempt to escape the
fear of involvement.

| all four faculty members had
agreed that suspension was |
I called.
The council, feeling that they
had let the faculty down, recon
j sidered the case and asked for
' suspension, only to have it later
revealed that one of the faculty
had not been in favor of suspen
sion and had made his feelings
explicit. Thus the program estab
i lished a precedent for Frulla's be
havior stating that 'all agree'
when in fact all do not agree."
Though the facts reported are
true, because they are incomplete,
(he conclusion drawn from the
facts is false. It is true that "one
of the faculty had not been in
favor of suspension and had made
his feelings explicit." I happen
1 to be the one. It is not true that
I this establishes "a precedent for
Frulla's behavior stating that 'all
; agree' when in fact all do not
j agree."
This apparent contradiction is
explained by the fact that before
taking up the case, the Faculty
| Council unanimously agreed to
make its decision unanimous: re
gardless of conflicting opinions
during discussions, the minority
was to endorse the majority view.
It is important to stress that this
preliminary decision was neither
requested nor suggested by Pro- j
! fessor Frulla.
As a matter-of-fact, I believe I
must be held responsible for
| originating what appears to me
now as ;> questionable suggestion.
The point is that, despite my dis
agreement. Professor Frulla com
mitted no impropriety in inform
ing the Student Council that "all
agreed:" all members of the Fac
! ulty Council did agree to turn

out a unanimous decision, includ
ing myself, and Professor Frulla
was simply carrying out the
Council's instructions in making
the announcement he made.
Though I can not pass judg
ment on the merits of Mr. Morse's
case, I believe that six months
at the "Villa" place me in a good
position to evaluate certain gen
eralizations made in your column,
about Stanford-in-Italy and about
its academic director.
Since I know your space is
limited. I shall restrict myself to
one similar incident, which does
not confirm the program's conten
tion that "Frulla had, in the past
become extremely excited by in
cidents of minor property dam
age."
At the end of last year's Spring
quarter, I happened to witness an
incident in which a student found
release from the accumulated
pressure of examination week
and from the disappointment of a
grade below expectations by
smashing two chairs in the Villa's
garden.
I advised him to anticipate
Council action by taking the initi
ative to personally inform Profes
sor Frulla of the incident, and by
offering apologies as well as
compensation.
This he did and, to my knowl
edge, the matter was settled and
closed then and there: apologies
w ere accepted, no disciplinary
action taken, and, if I am no t
wrong, no compensation re
quested, all of which hardly
agrees with the KZSU conclusion
about Professor Frulla's "ex
tremely excited reaction to minor
property damage" in the past.
This is only one among many
reasons why I do not recognize
the man I know in the emotional
and insensitive ogre depicted in
your pages for the benefit of the
campaign on Mr. Morse's behalf.
It would be sad if injustice to
Dr. Frulla were the price to be
paid for justice to Mr. Morse.

Mr. Wehrli's criticisms natur

valid in the specific context. They
ai'e, in my opinion, irrelevant to
much of the art of the past half

The significant point made by
his outburst, however, is of some
consequence : the lack of ade
quate gallery space and other

is rather appalling. Certainly En

for small shows of student work,

A room or two converted into

Editor, The Daily:
As has long been marked by
observers of such phenomena,
the manifest answer to the ques

democratic society a general con
sensus determines certain funda

removed from further considera

Any efforts to drag these Re

can only be interpreted by the
majority as wanton aggression,
an act of perfidy beyond atone

orthodoxy are not in question can
a certain diversity be indulged.
Unfortunately, the elite can
take no comfort in believing that
this malady is confined to the
uninitiated or to the canaille,
wallowing in ignorance of some

necessary connection between
democracy and liberty.
Look at the astounding invec
tive, the accusations of being one
with the Devil (in his secularized,
updated form as a reactionary

! I'Mitor, The Daily:
Ayn Rand belittles involvement
with people because, she says,
when you become involved with
people, you gel nothing back in
return; whereas with machines
and ideas, tangible returns are
possible, and man is basically
selfish.
All right. Granted: man is
basically selfish. But why does
Rand not acknowledge the fact
that to allow a person to be de
pendent on you, to help him,
when done in the right way, re
sults in his growth and develop
ment to tiio point where he can
stand alone, independent?
Why does she not acknowledge
; the immense satisfaction that ■
! comes from being a part of 1 his j
| process: seeing another person)
I grow and develop successfully j
i because of your own involvement
and risk?
Rand clearly and rightly points
out the perversions of this "sac
i rifice:" people who would "help"
j others out of guilt or fear, but
' without risking any threat of
their own security, which comes
i from detachment. She acknowl
edges the satisfaction that comes
from risk and involvement in de
veloping a successful material
creation or idea. Why not the
same for another person? Is not
this satisfaction a worthwhile re
i turn?
She fears such an involvement.
She finds involvement in mate
rial things and abstractions safer
{than involvement with people.
' She finds that machines and ideas
are always under control. They
will never make any demands on
{ her beyond what she wants to
give.
But people are less dependable.
| They may make demands on you
1 which you cannot meet. Or they
J may suddenly create a situation
which you cannot handle. Or they
may do things which are con
trary to the goals you are trying
to achieve by your involvement.
They are unpredictable. You
cannot control them; you can
only offer them a base of secur
ity from which they can develop
the potential inherent in every
one of them, Ayn Rand does not
have the guts to offer this base.
So she cannot achieve the sat
isfaction of seeing it work — a
more authentic and deeper satis
faction than can come from a
machine, because a human being
has greater potential than a
machine. She denies the possibil
ity of that satisfaction to avoid
recognizing her fear.
She points out the guilt that
arises when a person denies him
self his potential, and then goes
on to deny her own human poten
tial with her notion of "freedom
of action."
No man has the "freedom" to
do anything lie wants to do or to
be anything he wants to be. He
only has the freedom to become
what lie really is. The other is
not freedom at all. It is a com
pulsive attempt to escape the
fear of involvement.
BILL MADLKNER
Editor, The Daily:
Because (he status of the Stan
ford Civil Rights Secretariat has
become an issue in the current
ASSU presidential campaigns,
the following will attempt to
clarify the charge given to the
Secretariat by LASSU and the
position of the organisation with
regard to the Board of Trustees
Policy Statement of March 21,
1963 on student organizations.
The policy statement reads:
Students are encouraged to
study, discuss, debate and be
come knowledgeable about con
temporary affairs. The ex
pressing of opinions or taking
of positions with respect to
these matters is up to the
individual student or to vol
unteer groups of students so
constituted that they are au
thorized to speak for their
member. This is not a function
of student government at Stan
ford.
All students are required to
become members of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford
University, which represents
them with respect to student
affairs on the Stanford campus.
The student government, under
this policy, is not authorized
to speak for students on other
matters.
The Secretariat was formed be
cause of the interest and concern
manifested on the part of a large
number of Stanford students in
the contemporary civil rights
movement in general and th e
Mississippi summer project in
particular.
As stated in t lie information
brochure published by the Secre
tariat: "The only involvement of
ASSU as a body will be to re
spond to the immense interest
demonstrated by the student
body . . . by making available all
information about summer proj
ects." That is. the purpose of the
Secretariat is to provide those
students contemplating their ac
tive involvement in the move
ment, with sufficient information
for them to make a responsible
decision based on objective a n d
complete evidence.
The charge given to the Secre
tariat then is essentially one of
information dispensation, both
to the Stanford community and
to interested parties that lie with
out the Stanford community. It
is non-partisan in nature, and
does not seek to promote any par
ticular project or point of view.
As a purely informative organi
zation. it falls within the frame
work delimited by the trustees
policy statement.
The central portion of that
statement is especially concerned
with "expressing of opinion," and
to "taking positions." The civil
rights Secretariat is not em
powered to take any official
stands for the students of this
University; its purpose is to
meet certain needs that have
arisen as a result of stands that
individuals have taken. The for
mal charge of the civil rights Sec
retariat is as follows:
To make available and di s
pense information to all inter
ested parties, concerning the
available work and education
opportunities in the South (as
explicated at greater length in
(he Secretariat's information
brochure) and to refrain from
promotion of its aims and pur
poses insofar as this promotion
would subject unwilling indi
viduals to undesired conse
quences.
In contrast with the activities
of the Secretariat, the Stanford

| Civil Liberties Caucus, which is
presently submitting its constitu
tion to the Deans Office for ap-!
proval, is interested in the active
promotion and direct involvement
of its members and others of the
Stanford Community in the vari
ous facets of the civil rights
movement.
It presents programs of a parti- \
sail nature with a view toward;
changing opinions, and unlike the :
Secretariat, is not responsible to
LASSU. It is primarily not ad- j
ministrativc as is the Secretariat,
but is a membership organization
actively involving itself as a vol- j
untary group in the promotion of !
the ideals of the movement.
It is hoped that the above clari
fies the diverse interest of the
Secretariat and the Civil Liber
ties Caucus. Both organizations
: have their own particular purvue
| and as such, answer different
needs of the Stanford Commu
ity. There is, therefore, abundant i
cause for both organizations to
be maintained in their present
status during the following year.

(which, insofar as it concerns me

Ayn Rand belittles involvement
with people because, she says,
when you become involved with
people, you gel nothing back in
return; whereas with machines
and ideas, tangible returns are
possible, and man is basically
selfish.
All right. Granted: man is
basically selfish. But why does
Rand not acknowledge the fact
that to allow a person to be de
pendent on you, to help him,
when done in the right way, re
sults in his growth and develop
ment to tiio point where he can
stand alone, independent?
Why does she not acknowledge
; the immense satisfaction that ■
! comes from being a part of 1 his j
| process: seeing another person)
I grow and develop successfully j
i because of your own involvement
and risk?
Rand clearly and rightly points
out the perversions of this "sac
i rifice:" people who would "help"
j others out of guilt or fear, but
' without risking any threat of
their own security, which comes
i from detachment. She acknowl
edges the satisfaction that comes
from risk and involvement in de
veloping a successful material
creation or idea. Why not the
same for another person? Is not
this satisfaction a worthwhile re
i turn?
She fears such an involvement.
She finds involvement in mate
rial things and abstractions safer
{than involvement with people.
' She finds that machines and ideas
are always under control. They
will never make any demands on
{ her beyond what she wants to
give.
But people are less dependable.
| They may make demands on you
1 which you cannot meet. Or they
J may suddenly create a situation
which you cannot handle. Or they
may do things which are con
trary to the goals you are trying
to achieve by your involvement.
They are unpredictable. You
cannot control them; you can
only offer them a base of secur
ity from which they can develop
the potential inherent in every
one of them, Ayn Rand does not
have the guts to offer this base.
So she cannot achieve the sat
isfaction of seeing it work — a
more authentic and deeper satis
faction than can come from a
machine, because a human being
has greater potential than a
machine. She denies the possibil
ity of that satisfaction to avoid
recognizing her fear.
She points out the guilt that
arises when a person denies him
self his potential, and then goes
on to deny her own human poten
tial with her notion of "freedom
of action."
No man has the "freedom" to
do anything lie wants to do or to
be anything he wants to be. He
only has the freedom to become
what lie really is. The other is
not freedom at all. It is a com
pulsive attempt to escape the
fear of involvement.
BILL MADLKNER
Editor, The Daily:
Because (he status of the Stan
ford Civil Rights Secretariat has
become an issue in the current
ASSU presidential campaigns,
the following will attempt to
clarify the charge given to the
Secretariat by LASSU and the
position of the organisation with
regard to the Board of Trustees
Policy Statement of March 21,
1963 on student organizations.
The policy statement reads:
Students are encouraged to
study, discuss, debate and be
come knowledgeable about con
temporary affairs. The ex
pressing of opinions or taking
of positions with respect to
these matters is up to the
individual student or to vol
unteer groups of students so
constituted that they are au
thorized to speak for their
member. This is not a function
of student government at Stan
ford.
All students are required to
become members of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford
University, which represents
them with respect to student
affairs on the Stanford campus.
The student government, under
this policy, is not authorized
to speak for students on other
matters.
The Secretariat was formed be
cause of the interest and concern
manifested on the part of a large
number of Stanford students in
the contemporary civil rights
movement in general and th e
Mississippi summer project in
particular.
As stated in t lie information
brochure published by the Secre
tariat: "The only involvement of
ASSU as a body will be to re
spond to the immense interest
demonstrated by the student
body . . . by making available all
information about summer proj
ects." That is. the purpose of the
Secretariat is to provide those
students contemplating their ac
tive involvement in the move
ment, with sufficient information
for them to make a responsible
decision based on objective a n d
complete evidence.
The charge given to the Secre
tariat then is essentially one of
information dispensation, both
to the Stanford community and
to interested parties that lie with
out the Stanford community. It
is non-partisan in nature, and
does not seek to promote any par
ticular project or point of view.
As a purely informative organi
zation. it falls within the frame
work delimited by the trustees
policy statement.
The central portion of that
statement is especially concerned
with "expressing of opinion," and
to "taking positions." The civil
rights Secretariat is not em
powered to take any official
stands for the students of this
University; its purpose is to
meet certain needs that have
arisen as a result of stands that
individuals have taken. The for
mal charge of the civil rights Sec
retariat is as follows:
To make available and di s
pense information to all inter
ested parties, concerning the
available work and education
opportunities in the South (as
explicated at greater length in
(he Secretariat's information
brochure) and to refrain from
promotion of its aims and pur
poses insofar as this promotion
would subject unwilling indi
viduals to undesired conse
quences.
In contrast with the activities
of the Secretariat, the Stanford

| Civil Liberties Caucus, which is
presently submitting its constitu
tion to the Deans Office for ap-!
proval, is interested in the active
promotion and direct involvement
of its members and others of the
Stanford Community in the vari
ous facets of the civil rights
movement.
It presents programs of a parti- \
sail nature with a view toward;
changing opinions, and unlike the :
Secretariat, is not responsible to
LASSU. It is primarily not ad- j
ministrativc as is the Secretariat,
but is a membership organization
actively involving itself as a vol- j
untary group in the promotion of !
the ideals of the movement.
It is hoped that the above clari
fies the diverse interest of the
Secretariat and the Civil Liber
ties Caucus. Both organizations
: have their own particular purvue
| and as such, answer different
needs of the Stanford Commu
ity. There is, therefore, abundant i
cause for both organizations to
be maintained in their present
status during the following year.

• Dr. Frulla
Editor, The Daily:
The article "Discussion Con
tinues in Morse Controversy," re-
I porting in your May 4 issue a
KZSU editorial commentary, con
tains a passage which does grave
injustice to Professor Frulla and [
(which, insofar as it concerns me
directly, I have a duty to correct, i
The passage refers to " . . . j
j Frulla's behavior in an earlier
suspension case, in group six. j
Here the student council rendered
as heavy a verdict as possible >
short of suspension. Frulla ad
vised council members to recon
sider the case on the grounds that
| all four faculty members had
agreed that suspension was |
I called.
The council, feeling that they
had let the faculty down, recon
j sidered the case and asked for
' suspension, only to have it later
revealed that one of the faculty
had not been in favor of suspen
sion and had made his feelings
explicit. Thus the program estab
i lished a precedent for Frulla's be
havior stating that 'all agree'
when in fact all do not agree."
Though the facts reported are
true, because they are incomplete,
(he conclusion drawn from the
facts is false. It is true that "one
of the faculty had not been in
favor of suspension and had made
his feelings explicit." I happen
1 to be the one. It is not true that
I this establishes "a precedent for
Frulla's behavior stating that 'all
; agree' when in fact all do not
j agree."
This apparent contradiction is
explained by the fact that before
taking up the case, the Faculty
| Council unanimously agreed to
make its decision unanimous: re
gardless of conflicting opinions
during discussions, the minority
was to endorse the majority view.
It is important to stress that this
preliminary decision was neither
requested nor suggested by Pro- j
! fessor Frulla.
As a matter-of-fact, I believe I
must be held responsible for
| originating what appears to me
now as ;> questionable suggestion.
The point is that, despite my dis
agreement. Professor Frulla com
mitted no impropriety in inform
ing the Student Council that "all
agreed:" all members of the Fac
! ulty Council did agree to turn

out a unanimous decision, includ
ing myself, and Professor Frulla
was simply carrying out the
Council's instructions in making
the announcement he made.
Though I can not pass judg
ment on the merits of Mr. Morse's
case, I believe that six months
at the "Villa" place me in a good
position to evaluate certain gen
eralizations made in your column,
about Stanford-in-Italy and about
its academic director.
Since I know your space is
limited. I shall restrict myself to
one similar incident, which does
not confirm the program's conten
tion that "Frulla had, in the past
become extremely excited by in
cidents of minor property dam
age."
At the end of last year's Spring
quarter, I happened to witness an
incident in which a student found
release from the accumulated
pressure of examination week
and from the disappointment of a
grade below expectations by
smashing two chairs in the Villa's
garden.
I advised him to anticipate
Council action by taking the initi
ative to personally inform Profes
sor Frulla of the incident, and by
offering apologies as well as
compensation.
This he did and, to my knowl
edge, the matter was settled and
closed then and there: apologies
w ere accepted, no disciplinary
action taken, and, if I am no t
wrong, no compensation re
quested, all of which hardly
agrees with the KZSU conclusion
about Professor Frulla's "ex
tremely excited reaction to minor
property damage" in the past.
This is only one among many
reasons why I do not recognize
the man I know in the emotional
and insensitive ogre depicted in
your pages for the benefit of the
campaign on Mr. Morse's behalf.
It would be sad if injustice to
Dr. Frulla were the price to be
paid for justice to Mr. Morse.

• Enciiia Gallery
Editor, the Daily:
Mr. Wehrli's criticisms natur
ally reflect his taste, cultural
level, and awareness of the his
tory of art, and are perfectly
valid in the specific context. They
ai'e, in my opinion, irrelevant to
much of the art of the past half
century, including that of Mr.
Harshbarger.
The significant point made by
his outburst, however, is of some
consequence : the lack of ade
quate gallery space and other
facilities for serious students of
the visual arts at this University
is rather appalling. Certainly En
cina is not the ideal environment
for small shows of student work,
but it seems to be the only place
made available.
A room or two converted into
a small gallery for the graduate
students would be far more suit
table, as well as shielding th e
"average eyes" of personalities
such as Mr. Wehrli.

this policy, is not authorized
to speak for students on other
matters.
The Secretariat was formed be
cause of the interest and concern
manifested on the part of a large
number of Stanford students in
the contemporary civil rights
movement in general and th e
Mississippi summer project in
particular.
As stated in t lie information
brochure published by the Secre
tariat: "The only involvement of
ASSU as a body will be to re
spond to the immense interest
demonstrated by the student
body . . . by making available all
information about summer proj
ects." That is. the purpose of the
Secretariat is to provide those
students contemplating their ac
tive involvement in the move
ment, with sufficient information
for them to make a responsible
decision based on objective a n d
complete evidence.
The charge given to the Secre
tariat then is essentially one of
information dispensation, both
to the Stanford community and
to interested parties that lie with
out the Stanford community. It
is non-partisan in nature, and
does not seek to promote any par
ticular project or point of view.
As a purely informative organi
zation. it falls within the frame
work delimited by the trustees
policy statement.
The central portion of that
statement is especially concerned
with "expressing of opinion," and
to "taking positions." The civil
rights Secretariat is not em
powered to take any official
stands for the students of this
University; its purpose is to
meet certain needs that have
arisen as a result of stands that
individuals have taken. The for
mal charge of the civil rights Sec
retariat is as follows:
To make available and di s
pense information to all inter
ested parties, concerning the
available work and education
opportunities in the South (as
explicated at greater length in
(he Secretariat's information
brochure) and to refrain from
promotion of its aims and pur
poses insofar as this promotion
would subject unwilling indi
viduals to undesired conse
quences.
In contrast with the activities
of the Secretariat, the Stanford

| Civil Liberties Caucus, which is
presently submitting its constitu
tion to the Deans Office for ap-!
proval, is interested in the active
promotion and direct involvement
of its members and others of the
Stanford Community in the vari
ous facets of the civil rights
movement.
It presents programs of a parti- \
sail nature with a view toward;
changing opinions, and unlike the :
Secretariat, is not responsible to
LASSU. It is primarily not ad- j
ministrativc as is the Secretariat,
but is a membership organization
actively involving itself as a vol- j
untary group in the promotion of !
the ideals of the movement.
It is hoped that the above clari
fies the diverse interest of the
Secretariat and the Civil Liber
ties Caucus. Both organizations
: have their own particular purvue
| and as such, answer different
needs of the Stanford Commu
ity. There is, therefore, abundant i
cause for both organizations to
be maintained in their present
status during the following year.

• Dr. Frulla
Editor, The Daily:
The article "Discussion Con
tinues in Morse Controversy," re-
I porting in your May 4 issue a
KZSU editorial commentary, con
tains a passage which does grave
injustice to Professor Frulla and [
(which, insofar as it concerns me
directly, I have a duty to correct, i
The passage refers to " . . . j
j Frulla's behavior in an earlier
suspension case, in group six. j
Here the student council rendered
as heavy a verdict as possible >
short of suspension. Frulla ad
vised council members to recon
sider the case on the grounds that
| all four faculty members had
agreed that suspension was |
I called.
The council, feeling that they
had let the faculty down, recon
j sidered the case and asked for
' suspension, only to have it later
revealed that one of the faculty
had not been in favor of suspen
sion and had made his feelings
explicit. Thus the program estab
i lished a precedent for Frulla's be
havior stating that 'all agree'
when in fact all do not agree."
Though the facts reported are
true, because they are incomplete,
(he conclusion drawn from the
facts is false. It is true that "one
of the faculty had not been in
favor of suspension and had made
his feelings explicit." I happen
1 to be the one. It is not true that
I this establishes "a precedent for
Frulla's behavior stating that 'all
; agree' when in fact all do not
j agree."
This apparent contradiction is
explained by the fact that before
taking up the case, the Faculty
| Council unanimously agreed to
make its decision unanimous: re
gardless of conflicting opinions
during discussions, the minority
was to endorse the majority view.
It is important to stress that this
preliminary decision was neither
requested nor suggested by Pro- j
! fessor Frulla.
As a matter-of-fact, I believe I
must be held responsible for
| originating what appears to me
now as ;> questionable suggestion.
The point is that, despite my dis
agreement. Professor Frulla com
mitted no impropriety in inform
ing the Student Council that "all
agreed:" all members of the Fac
! ulty Council did agree to turn

out a unanimous decision, includ
ing myself, and Professor Frulla
was simply carrying out the
Council's instructions in making
the announcement he made.
Though I can not pass judg
ment on the merits of Mr. Morse's
case, I believe that six months
at the "Villa" place me in a good
position to evaluate certain gen
eralizations made in your column,
about Stanford-in-Italy and about
its academic director.
Since I know your space is
limited. I shall restrict myself to
one similar incident, which does
not confirm the program's conten
tion that "Frulla had, in the past
become extremely excited by in
cidents of minor property dam
age."
At the end of last year's Spring
quarter, I happened to witness an
incident in which a student found
release from the accumulated
pressure of examination week
and from the disappointment of a
grade below expectations by
smashing two chairs in the Villa's
garden.
I advised him to anticipate
Council action by taking the initi
ative to personally inform Profes
sor Frulla of the incident, and by
offering apologies as well as
compensation.
This he did and, to my knowl
edge, the matter was settled and
closed then and there: apologies
w ere accepted, no disciplinary
action taken, and, if I am no t
wrong, no compensation re
quested, all of which hardly
agrees with the KZSU conclusion
about Professor Frulla's "ex
tremely excited reaction to minor
property damage" in the past.
This is only one among many
reasons why I do not recognize
the man I know in the emotional
and insensitive ogre depicted in
your pages for the benefit of the
campaign on Mr. Morse's behalf.
It would be sad if injustice to
Dr. Frulla were the price to be
paid for justice to Mr. Morse.

• Enciiia Gallery
Editor, the Daily:
Mr. Wehrli's criticisms natur
ally reflect his taste, cultural
level, and awareness of the his
tory of art, and are perfectly
valid in the specific context. They
ai'e, in my opinion, irrelevant to
much of the art of the past half
century, including that of Mr.
Harshbarger.
The significant point made by
his outburst, however, is of some
consequence : the lack of ade
quate gallery space and other
facilities for serious students of
the visual arts at this University
is rather appalling. Certainly En
cina is not the ideal environment
for small shows of student work,
but it seems to be the only place
made available.
A room or two converted into
a small gallery for the graduate
students would be far more suit
table, as well as shielding th e
"average eyes" of personalities
such as Mr. Wehrli.

• Revealed Truths
Editor, The Daily:
As has long been marked by
observers of such phenomena,
the manifest answer to the ques
tion fashioned in Miss Bozman's
column of May 1 is that in the
democratic society a general con
sensus determines certain funda
mentals of belief, which are then
removed from further considera
tion.
Any efforts to drag these Re
vealed Truths back into the arena
can only be interpreted by the
majority as wanton aggression,
an act of perfidy beyond atone
ment. Only when these points of
orthodoxy are not in question can
a certain diversity be indulged.
Unfortunately, the elite can
take no comfort in believing that
this malady is confined to the
uninitiated or to the canaille,
wallowing in ignorance of some

necessary connection between
democracy and liberty.
Look at the astounding invec
tive, the accusations of being one
with the Devil (in his secularized,
updated form as a reactionary
white suprcmatist who is enrap
tured by butchery) that were
hurled against tho heretic who
denied the original sin of a sus
piciously unproductive intelli
gentsia.
Consider, even more patently,
the demand th a t Encina be
purged of paintings offensive to
Renaissance taste, an action
against contamination by that
which is alien.

• Ay 11 Hand
! I'Mitor, The Daily:
Ayn Rand belittles involvement
with people because, she says,
when you become involved with
people, you gel nothing back in
return; whereas with machines
and ideas, tangible returns are
possible, and man is basically
selfish.
All right. Granted: man is
basically selfish. But why does
Rand not acknowledge the fact
that to allow a person to be de
pendent on you, to help him,
when done in the right way, re
sults in his growth and develop
ment to tiio point where he can
stand alone, independent?
Why does she not acknowledge
; the immense satisfaction that ■
! comes from being a part of 1 his j
| process: seeing another person)
I grow and develop successfully j
i because of your own involvement
and risk?
Rand clearly and rightly points
out the perversions of this "sac
i rifice:" people who would "help"
j others out of guilt or fear, but
' without risking any threat of
their own security, which comes
i from detachment. She acknowl
edges the satisfaction that comes
from risk and involvement in de
veloping a successful material
creation or idea. Why not the
same for another person? Is not
this satisfaction a worthwhile re
i turn?
She fears such an involvement.
She finds involvement in mate
rial things and abstractions safer
{than involvement with people.
' She finds that machines and ideas
are always under control. They
will never make any demands on
{ her beyond what she wants to
give.
But people are less dependable.
| They may make demands on you
1 which you cannot meet. Or they
J may suddenly create a situation
which you cannot handle. Or they
may do things which are con
trary to the goals you are trying
to achieve by your involvement.
They are unpredictable. You
cannot control them; you can
only offer them a base of secur
ity from which they can develop
the potential inherent in every
one of them, Ayn Rand does not
have the guts to offer this base.
So she cannot achieve the sat
isfaction of seeing it work — a
more authentic and deeper satis
faction than can come from a
machine, because a human being
has greater potential than a
machine. She denies the possibil
ity of that satisfaction to avoid
recognizing her fear.
She points out the guilt that
arises when a person denies him
self his potential, and then goes
on to deny her own human poten
tial with her notion of "freedom
of action."
No man has the "freedom" to
do anything lie wants to do or to
be anything he wants to be. He
only has the freedom to become
what lie really is. The other is
not freedom at all. It is a com
pulsive attempt to escape the
fear of involvement.

Because (he status of the Stan
ford Civil Rights Secretariat has
become an issue in the current
ASSU presidential campaigns,
the following will attempt to
clarify the charge given to the
Secretariat by LASSU and the
position of the organisation with
regard to the Board of Trustees
Policy Statement of March 21,
1963 on student organizations.
The policy statement reads:
Students are encouraged to
study, discuss, debate and be
come knowledgeable about con
temporary affairs. The ex
pressing of opinions or taking
of positions with respect to
these matters is up to the
individual student or to vol
unteer groups of students so
constituted that they are au
thorized to speak for their
member. This is not a function
of student government at Stan
ford.
All students are required to
become members of the Asso

make its decision unanimous: re
gardless of conflicting opinions
during discussions, the minority
was to endorse the majority view.
It is important to stress that this
preliminary decision was neither
requested nor suggested by Pro- j
! fessor Frulla.
As a matter-of-fact, I believe I
must be held responsible for
| originating what appears to me
now as ;> questionable suggestion.
The point is that, despite my dis
agreement. Professor Frulla com
mitted no impropriety in inform
ing the Student Council that "all
agreed:" all members of the Fac
! ulty Council did agree to turn

out a unanimous decision, includ
ing myself, and Professor Frulla
was simply carrying out the
Council's instructions in making
the announcement he made.
Though I can not pass judg
ment on the merits of Mr. Morse's
case, I believe that six months
at the "Villa" place me in a good
position to evaluate certain gen
eralizations made in your column,
about Stanford-in-Italy and about
its academic director.
Since I know your space is
limited. I shall restrict myself to
one similar incident, which does
not confirm the program's conten
tion that "Frulla had, in the past
become extremely excited by in
cidents of minor property dam
age."
At the end of last year's Spring
quarter, I happened to witness an
incident in which a student found
release from the accumulated
pressure of examination week
and from the disappointment of a
grade below expectations by
smashing two chairs in the Villa's
garden.
I advised him to anticipate
Council action by taking the initi
ative to personally inform Profes
sor Frulla of the incident, and by
offering apologies as well as
compensation.
This he did and, to my knowl
edge, the matter was settled and
closed then and there: apologies
w ere accepted, no disciplinary
action taken, and, if I am no t
wrong, no compensation re
quested, all of which hardly
agrees with the KZSU conclusion
about Professor Frulla's "ex
tremely excited reaction to minor
property damage" in the past.
This is only one among many
reasons why I do not recognize
the man I know in the emotional
and insensitive ogre depicted in
your pages for the benefit of the
campaign on Mr. Morse's behalf.
It would be sad if injustice to
Dr. Frulla were the price to be
paid for justice to Mr. Morse.

Editor, the Daily:
Mr. Wehrli's criticisms natur
ally reflect his taste, cultural
level, and awareness of the his
tory of art, and are perfectly
valid in the specific context. They
ai'e, in my opinion, irrelevant to
much of the art of the past half
century, including that of Mr.

The significant point made by
his outburst, however, is of some
consequence : the lack of ade
quate gallery space and other
facilities for serious students of
the visual arts at this University
is rather appalling. Certainly En
cina is not the ideal environment
for small shows of student work,
but it seems to be the only place

A room or two converted into

Editor, The Daily:
As has long been marked by
observers of such phenomena,
the manifest answer to the ques
tion fashioned in Miss Bozman's
column of May 1 is that in the
democratic society a general con
sensus determines certain funda
mentals of belief, which are then
removed from further considera

Any efforts to drag these Re

can only be interpreted by the
majority as wanton aggression,
an act of perfidy beyond atone

orthodoxy are not in question can
a certain diversity be indulged.
Unfortunately, the elite can
take no comfort in believing that
this malady is confined to the
uninitiated or to the canaille,
wallowing in ignorance of some

necessary connection between
democracy and liberty.
Look at the astounding invec
tive, the accusations of being one
with the Devil (in his secularized,
updated form as a reactionary
white suprcmatist who is enrap
tured by butchery) that were

! I'Mitor, The Daily:
Ayn Rand belittles involvement
with people because, she says,
when you become involved with
people, you gel nothing back in
return; whereas with machines
and ideas, tangible returns are
possible, and man is basically
selfish.
All right. Granted: man is
basically selfish. But why does
Rand not acknowledge the fact
that to allow a person to be de
pendent on you, to help him,
when done in the right way, re
sults in his growth and develop
ment to tiio point where he can
stand alone, independent?
Why does she not acknowledge
; the immense satisfaction that ■
! comes from being a part of 1 his j
| process: seeing another person)
I grow and develop successfully j
i because of your own involvement
and risk?
Rand clearly and rightly points
out the perversions of this "sac
i rifice:" people who would "help"
j others out of guilt or fear, but
' without risking any threat of
their own security, which comes
i from detachment. She acknowl
edges the satisfaction that comes
from risk and involvement in de
veloping a successful material
creation or idea. Why not the
same for another person? Is not
this satisfaction a worthwhile re
i turn?
She fears such an involvement.
She finds involvement in mate
rial things and abstractions safer
{than involvement with people.
' She finds that machines and ideas
are always under control. They
will never make any demands on
{ her beyond what she wants to
give.
But people are less dependable.
| They may make demands on you
1 which you cannot meet. Or they
J may suddenly create a situation
which you cannot handle. Or they
may do things which are con
trary to the goals you are trying
to achieve by your involvement.
They are unpredictable. You
cannot control them; you can
only offer them a base of secur
ity from which they can develop
the potential inherent in every
one of them, Ayn Rand does not
have the guts to offer this base.
So she cannot achieve the sat
isfaction of seeing it work — a
more authentic and deeper satis
faction than can come from a
machine, because a human being
has greater potential than a
machine. She denies the possibil
ity of that satisfaction to avoid
recognizing her fear.
She points out the guilt that
arises when a person denies him
self his potential, and then goes
on to deny her own human poten
tial with her notion of "freedom
of action."
No man has the "freedom" to
do anything lie wants to do or to
be anything he wants to be. He
only has the freedom to become
what lie really is. The other is
not freedom at all. It is a com
pulsive attempt to escape the
fear of involvement.
BILL MADLKNER
Editor, The Daily:
Because (he status of the Stan
ford Civil Rights Secretariat has
become an issue in the current
ASSU presidential campaigns,
the following will attempt to
clarify the charge given to the
Secretariat by LASSU and the
position of the organisation with
regard to the Board of Trustees
Policy Statement of March 21,
1963 on student organizations.
The policy statement reads:
Students are encouraged to
study, discuss, debate and be
come knowledgeable about con
temporary affairs. The ex
pressing of opinions or taking
of positions with respect to
these matters is up to the
individual student or to vol
unteer groups of students so
constituted that they are au
thorized to speak for their
member. This is not a function
of student government at Stan
ford.
All students are required to
become members of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford
University, which represents
them with respect to student
affairs on the Stanford campus.
The student government, under
this policy, is not authorized
to speak for students on other
matters.
The Secretariat was formed be
cause of the interest and concern
manifested on the part of a large
number of Stanford students in
the contemporary civil rights
movement in general and th e
Mississippi summer project in
particular.
As stated in t lie information
brochure published by the Secre
tariat: "The only involvement of
ASSU as a body will be to re
spond to the immense interest
demonstrated by the student
body . . . by making available all
information about summer proj
ects." That is. the purpose of the
Secretariat is to provide those
students contemplating their ac
tive involvement in the move
ment, with sufficient information
for them to make a responsible
decision based on objective a n d
complete evidence.
The charge given to the Secre
tariat then is essentially one of
information dispensation, both
to the Stanford community and
to interested parties that lie with
out the Stanford community. It
is non-partisan in nature, and
does not seek to promote any par
ticular project or point of view.
As a purely informative organi
zation. it falls within the frame
work delimited by the trustees
policy statement.
The central portion of that
statement is especially concerned
with "expressing of opinion," and
to "taking positions." The civil
rights Secretariat is not em
powered to take any official
stands for the students of this
University; its purpose is to
meet certain needs that have
arisen as a result of stands that
individuals have taken. The for
mal charge of the civil rights Sec
retariat is as follows:
To make available and di s
pense information to all inter
ested parties, concerning the
available work and education
opportunities in the South (as
explicated at greater length in
(he Secretariat's information
brochure) and to refrain from
promotion of its aims and pur
poses insofar as this promotion
would subject unwilling indi
viduals to undesired conse
quences.
In contrast with the activities
of the Secretariat, the Stanford

| Civil Liberties Caucus, which is
presently submitting its constitu
tion to the Deans Office for ap-!
proval, is interested in the active
promotion and direct involvement
of its members and others of the
Stanford Community in the vari
ous facets of the civil rights
movement.
It presents programs of a parti- \
sail nature with a view toward;
changing opinions, and unlike the :
Secretariat, is not responsible to
LASSU. It is primarily not ad- j
ministrativc as is the Secretariat,
but is a membership organization
actively involving itself as a vol- j
untary group in the promotion of !
the ideals of the movement.
It is hoped that the above clari
fies the diverse interest of the
Secretariat and the Civil Liber
ties Caucus. Both organizations
: have their own particular purvue
| and as such, answer different
needs of the Stanford Commu
ity. There is, therefore, abundant i
cause for both organizations to
be maintained in their present
status during the following year.

• Dr. Frulla
Editor, The Daily:
The article "Discussion Con

I porting in your May 4 issue a
KZSU editorial commentary, con
tains a passage which does grave
injustice to Professor Frulla and [
(which, insofar as it concerns me
directly, I have a duty to correct, i
The passage refers to " . . . j
j Frulla's behavior in an earlier
suspension case, in group six. j
Here the student council rendered
as heavy a verdict as possible >
short of suspension. Frulla ad
vised council members to recon
sider the case on the grounds that
| all four faculty members had
agreed that suspension was |
I called.
The council, feeling that they
had let the faculty down, recon
j sidered the case and asked for
' suspension, only to have it later
revealed that one of the faculty
had not been in favor of suspen
sion and had made his feelings
explicit. Thus the program estab
i lished a precedent for Frulla's be
havior stating that 'all agree'
when in fact all do not agree."
Though the facts reported are
true, because they are incomplete,
(he conclusion drawn from the
facts is false. It is true that "one
of the faculty had not been in

! I'Mitor, The Daily:
Ayn Rand belittles involvement
with people because, she says,
when you become involved with
people, you gel nothing back in
return; whereas with machines
and ideas, tangible returns are
possible, and man is basically
selfish.
All right. Granted: man is
basically selfish. But why does
Rand not acknowledge the fact
that to allow a person to be de
pendent on you, to help him,
when done in the right way, re
sults in his growth and develop
ment to tiio point where he can
stand alone, independent?
Why does she not acknowledge
; the immense satisfaction that ■
! comes from being a part of 1 his j
| process: seeing another person)
I grow and develop successfully j
i because of your own involvement
and risk?
Rand clearly and rightly points
out the perversions of this "sac
i rifice:" people who would "help"
j others out of guilt or fear, but
' without risking any threat of
their own security, which comes
i from detachment. She acknowl
edges the satisfaction that comes
from risk and involvement in de
veloping a successful material
creation or idea. Why not the
same for another person? Is not
this satisfaction a worthwhile re
i turn?
She fears such an involvement.
She finds involvement in mate
rial things and abstractions safer
{than involvement with people.
' She finds that machines and ideas
are always under control. They
will never make any demands on
{ her beyond what she wants to
give.
But people are less dependable.
| They may make demands on you
1 which you cannot meet. Or they
J may suddenly create a situation
which you cannot handle. Or they
may do things which are con
trary to the goals you are trying
to achieve by your involvement.
They are unpredictable. You
cannot control them; you can
only offer them a base of secur
ity from which they can develop
the potential inherent in every
one of them, Ayn Rand does not
have the guts to offer this base.
So she cannot achieve the sat
isfaction of seeing it work — a
more authentic and deeper satis
faction than can come from a
machine, because a human being
has greater potential than a
machine. She denies the possibil
ity of that satisfaction to avoid
recognizing her fear.
She points out the guilt that
arises when a person denies him
self his potential, and then goes
on to deny her own human poten
tial with her notion of "freedom
of action."
No man has the "freedom" to
do anything lie wants to do or to
be anything he wants to be. He
only has the freedom to become
what lie really is. The other is
not freedom at all. It is a com
pulsive attempt to escape the
fear of involvement.
BILL MADLKNER
Editor, The Daily:
Because (he status of the Stan
ford Civil Rights Secretariat has
become an issue in the current
ASSU presidential campaigns,
the following will attempt to
clarify the charge given to the
Secretariat by LASSU and the
position of the organisation with
regard to the Board of Trustees
Policy Statement of March 21,
1963 on student organizations.
The policy statement reads:
Students are encouraged to
study, discuss, debate and be
come knowledgeable about con
temporary affairs. The ex
pressing of opinions or taking
of positions with respect to
these matters is up to the
individual student or to vol
unteer groups of students so
constituted that they are au
thorized to speak for their
member. This is not a function
of student government at Stan
ford.
All students are required to
become members of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford
University, which represents
them with respect to student
affairs on the Stanford campus.
The student government, under
this policy, is not authorized
to speak for students on other
matters.
The Secretariat was formed be
cause of the interest and concern
manifested on the part of a large
number of Stanford students in
the contemporary civil rights
movement in general and th e
Mississippi summer project in
particular.
As stated in t lie information
brochure published by the Secre
tariat: "The only involvement of
ASSU as a body will be to re
spond to the immense interest
demonstrated by the student
body . . . by making available all
information about summer proj
ects." That is. the purpose of the
Secretariat is to provide those
students contemplating their ac
tive involvement in the move
ment, with sufficient information
for them to make a responsible
decision based on objective a n d
complete evidence.
The charge given to the Secre
tariat then is essentially one of
information dispensation, both
to the Stanford community and
to interested parties that lie with
out the Stanford community. It
is non-partisan in nature, and
does not seek to promote any par
ticular project or point of view.
As a purely informative organi
zation. it falls within the frame
work delimited by the trustees
policy statement.
The central portion of that
statement is especially concerned
with "expressing of opinion," and
to "taking positions." The civil
rights Secretariat is not em
powered to take any official
stands for the students of this
University; its purpose is to
meet certain needs that have
arisen as a result of stands that
individuals have taken. The for
mal charge of the civil rights Sec
retariat is as follows:
To make available and di s
pense information to all inter
ested parties, concerning the
available work and education
opportunities in the South (as
explicated at greater length in
(he Secretariat's information
brochure) and to refrain from
promotion of its aims and pur
poses insofar as this promotion
would subject unwilling indi
viduals to undesired conse
quences.
In contrast with the activities
of the Secretariat, the Stanford

| Civil Liberties Caucus, which is
presently submitting its constitu
tion to the Deans Office for ap-!
proval, is interested in the active
promotion and direct involvement
of its members and others of the
Stanford Community in the vari
ous facets of the civil rights
movement.
It presents programs of a parti- \
sail nature with a view toward;
changing opinions, and unlike the :
Secretariat, is not responsible to
LASSU. It is primarily not ad- j
ministrativc as is the Secretariat,
but is a membership organization
actively involving itself as a vol- j
untary group in the promotion of !
the ideals of the movement.
It is hoped that the above clari
fies the diverse interest of the
Secretariat and the Civil Liber
ties Caucus. Both organizations
: have their own particular purvue
| and as such, answer different
needs of the Stanford Commu
ity. There is, therefore, abundant i
cause for both organizations to
be maintained in their present
status during the following year.

• Dr. Frulla
Editor, The Daily:
The article "Discussion Con
tinues in Morse Controversy," re-
I porting in your May 4 issue a
KZSU editorial commentary, con
tains a passage which does grave
injustice to Professor Frulla and [
(which, insofar as it concerns me
directly, I have a duty to correct, i
The passage refers to " . . . j
j Frulla's behavior in an earlier
suspension case, in group six. j
Here the student council rendered
as heavy a verdict as possible >
short of suspension. Frulla ad
vised council members to recon
sider the case on the grounds that
| all four faculty members had
agreed that suspension was |
I called.
The council, feeling that they
had let the faculty down, recon
j sidered the case and asked for
' suspension, only to have it later
revealed that one of the faculty
had not been in favor of suspen
sion and had made his feelings
explicit. Thus the program estab
i lished a precedent for Frulla's be
havior stating that 'all agree'
when in fact all do not agree."
Though the facts reported are
true, because they are incomplete,
(he conclusion drawn from the
facts is false. It is true that "one
of the faculty had not been in
favor of suspension and had made
his feelings explicit." I happen
1 to be the one. It is not true that
I this establishes "a precedent for
Frulla's behavior stating that 'all
; agree' when in fact all do not
j agree."
This apparent contradiction is
explained by the fact that before
taking up the case, the Faculty
| Council unanimously agreed to
make its decision unanimous: re
gardless of conflicting opinions
during discussions, the minority
was to endorse the majority view.
It is important to stress that this
preliminary decision was neither
requested nor suggested by Pro- j
! fessor Frulla.
As a matter-of-fact, I believe I
must be held responsible for
| originating what appears to me
now as ;> questionable suggestion.
The point is that, despite my dis
agreement. Professor Frulla com
mitted no impropriety in inform
ing the Student Council that "all
agreed:" all members of the Fac
! ulty Council did agree to turn

out a unanimous decision, includ
ing myself, and Professor Frulla
was simply carrying out the
Council's instructions in making
the announcement he made.
Though I can not pass judg
ment on the merits of Mr. Morse's
case, I believe that six months
at the "Villa" place me in a good
position to evaluate certain gen
eralizations made in your column,
about Stanford-in-Italy and about
its academic director.
Since I know your space is
limited. I shall restrict myself to
one similar incident, which does
not confirm the program's conten
tion that "Frulla had, in the past
become extremely excited by in
cidents of minor property dam
age."
At the end of last year's Spring
quarter, I happened to witness an
incident in which a student found
release from the accumulated
pressure of examination week
and from the disappointment of a
grade below expectations by
smashing two chairs in the Villa's
garden.
I advised him to anticipate
Council action by taking the initi
ative to personally inform Profes
sor Frulla of the incident, and by
offering apologies as well as
compensation.
This he did and, to my knowl
edge, the matter was settled and
closed then and there: apologies
w ere accepted, no disciplinary
action taken, and, if I am no t
wrong, no compensation re
quested, all of which hardly
agrees with the KZSU conclusion
about Professor Frulla's "ex
tremely excited reaction to minor
property damage" in the past.
This is only one among many
reasons why I do not recognize
the man I know in the emotional
and insensitive ogre depicted in
your pages for the benefit of the
campaign on Mr. Morse's behalf.
It would be sad if injustice to
Dr. Frulla were the price to be
paid for justice to Mr. Morse.

• Enciiia Gallery
Editor, the Daily:
Mr. Wehrli's criticisms natur
ally reflect his taste, cultural
level, and awareness of the his
tory of art, and are perfectly
valid in the specific context. They
ai'e, in my opinion, irrelevant to
much of the art of the past half
century, including that of Mr.
Harshbarger.
The significant point made by
his outburst, however, is of some
consequence : the lack of ade
quate gallery space and other
facilities for serious students of
the visual arts at this University
is rather appalling. Certainly En
cina is not the ideal environment
for small shows of student work,
but it seems to be the only place
made available.
A room or two converted into
a small gallery for the graduate
students would be far more suit
table, as well as shielding th e
"average eyes" of personalities
such as Mr. Wehrli.

• Revealed Truths
Editor, The Daily:
As has long been marked by
observers of such phenomena,
the manifest answer to the ques
tion fashioned in Miss Bozman's
column of May 1 is that in the
democratic society a general con
sensus determines certain funda
mentals of belief, which are then
removed from further considera
tion.
Any efforts to drag these Re
vealed Truths back into the arena
can only be interpreted by the
majority as wanton aggression,
an act of perfidy beyond atone
ment. Only when these points of
orthodoxy are not in question can
a certain diversity be indulged.
Unfortunately, the elite can
take no comfort in believing that
this malady is confined to the
uninitiated or to the canaille,
wallowing in ignorance of some

necessary connection between
democracy and liberty.
Look at the astounding invec
tive, the accusations of being one
with the Devil (in his secularized,
updated form as a reactionary
white suprcmatist who is enrap
tured by butchery) that were
hurled against tho heretic who
denied the original sin of a sus
piciously unproductive intelli
gentsia.
Consider, even more patently,
the demand th a t Encina be
purged of paintings offensive to
Renaissance taste, an action
against contamination by that
which is alien.

does not seek to promote any par
ticular project or point of view.
As a purely informative organi
zation. it falls within the frame
work delimited by the trustees
policy statement.
The central portion of that
statement is especially concerned
with "expressing of opinion," and
to "taking positions." The civil
rights Secretariat is not em
powered to take any official
stands for the students of this
University; its purpose is to
meet certain needs that have
arisen as a result of stands that
individuals have taken. The for
mal charge of the civil rights Sec
retariat is as follows:
To make available and di s
pense information to all inter
ested parties, concerning the
available work and education
opportunities in the South (as
explicated at greater length in
(he Secretariat's information
brochure) and to refrain from
promotion of its aims and pur
poses insofar as this promotion
would subject unwilling indi
viduals to undesired conse
quences.
In contrast with the activities
of the Secretariat, the Stanford

| Civil Liberties Caucus, which is
presently submitting its constitu
tion to the Deans Office for ap-!
proval, is interested in the active
promotion and direct involvement
of its members and others of the
Stanford Community in the vari
ous facets of the civil rights
movement.
It presents programs of a parti- \
sail nature with a view toward;
changing opinions, and unlike the :
Secretariat, is not responsible to
LASSU. It is primarily not ad- j
ministrativc as is the Secretariat,
but is a membership organization
actively involving itself as a vol- j
untary group in the promotion of !
the ideals of the movement.
It is hoped that the above clari
fies the diverse interest of the
Secretariat and the Civil Liber
ties Caucus. Both organizations
: have their own particular purvue
| and as such, answer different
needs of the Stanford Commu
ity. There is, therefore, abundant i
cause for both organizations to
be maintained in their present
status during the following year.

• Dr. Frulla
Editor, The Daily:
The article "Discussion Con
tinues in Morse Controversy," re-
I porting in your May 4 issue a
KZSU editorial commentary, con
tains a passage which does grave
injustice to Professor Frulla and [
(which, insofar as it concerns me
directly, I have a duty to correct, i
The passage refers to " . . . j
j Frulla's behavior in an earlier
suspension case, in group six. j
Here the student council rendered
as heavy a verdict as possible >
short of suspension. Frulla ad
vised council members to recon
sider the case on the grounds that
| all four faculty members had
agreed that suspension was |
I called.
The council, feeling that they
had let the faculty down, recon
j sidered the case and asked for
' suspension, only to have it later
revealed that one of the faculty
had not been in favor of suspen
sion and had made his feelings
explicit. Thus the program estab
i lished a precedent for Frulla's be
havior stating that 'all agree'
when in fact all do not agree."
Though the facts reported are
true, because they are incomplete,
(he conclusion drawn from the
facts is false. It is true that "one
of the faculty had not been in
favor of suspension and had made
his feelings explicit." I happen
1 to be the one. It is not true that
I this establishes "a precedent for
Frulla's behavior stating that 'all
; agree' when in fact all do not
j agree."
This apparent contradiction is
explained by the fact that before
taking up the case, the Faculty
| Council unanimously agreed to
make its decision unanimous: re
gardless of conflicting opinions
during discussions, the minority
was to endorse the majority view.
It is important to stress that this
preliminary decision was neither
requested nor suggested by Pro- j
! fessor Frulla.
As a matter-of-fact, I believe I
must be held responsible for
| originating what appears to me
now as ;> questionable suggestion.
The point is that, despite my dis
agreement. Professor Frulla com
mitted no impropriety in inform
ing the Student Council that "all
agreed:" all members of the Fac
! ulty Council did agree to turn

out a unanimous decision, includ
ing myself, and Professor Frulla
was simply carrying out the
Council's instructions in making
the announcement he made.
Though I can not pass judg
ment on the merits of Mr. Morse's
case, I believe that six months
at the "Villa" place me in a good
position to evaluate certain gen
eralizations made in your column,
about Stanford-in-Italy and about
its academic director.
Since I know your space is
limited. I shall restrict myself to
one similar incident, which does
not confirm the program's conten
tion that "Frulla had, in the past
become extremely excited by in
cidents of minor property dam
age."
At the end of last year's Spring
quarter, I happened to witness an
incident in which a student found
release from the accumulated
pressure of examination week
and from the disappointment of a
grade below expectations by
smashing two chairs in the Villa's
garden.
I advised him to anticipate
Council action by taking the initi
ative to personally inform Profes
sor Frulla of the incident, and by
offering apologies as well as
compensation.
This he did and, to my knowl
edge, the matter was settled and
closed then and there: apologies
w ere accepted, no disciplinary
action taken, and, if I am no t
wrong, no compensation re
quested, all of which hardly
agrees with the KZSU conclusion
about Professor Frulla's "ex
tremely excited reaction to minor
property damage" in the past.
This is only one among many
reasons why I do not recognize
the man I know in the emotional
and insensitive ogre depicted in
your pages for the benefit of the
campaign on Mr. Morse's behalf.
It would be sad if injustice to
Dr. Frulla were the price to be
paid for justice to Mr. Morse.

• Enciiia Gallery
Editor, the Daily:
Mr. Wehrli's criticisms natur
ally reflect his taste, cultural
level, and awareness of the his
tory of art, and are perfectly
valid in the specific context. They
ai'e, in my opinion, irrelevant to
much of the art of the past half
century, including that of Mr.
Harshbarger.
The significant point made by
his outburst, however, is of some
consequence : the lack of ade
quate gallery space and other
facilities for serious students of
the visual arts at this University
is rather appalling. Certainly En
cina is not the ideal environment
for small shows of student work,
but it seems to be the only place
made available.
A room or two converted into
a small gallery for the graduate
students would be far more suit
table, as well as shielding th e
"average eyes" of personalities
such as Mr. Wehrli.

• Revealed Truths
Editor, The Daily:
As has long been marked by
observers of such phenomena,
the manifest answer to the ques
tion fashioned in Miss Bozman's
column of May 1 is that in the
democratic society a general con
sensus determines certain funda
mentals of belief, which are then
removed from further considera
tion.
Any efforts to drag these Re
vealed Truths back into the arena
can only be interpreted by the
majority as wanton aggression,
an act of perfidy beyond atone
ment. Only when these points of
orthodoxy are not in question can
a certain diversity be indulged.
Unfortunately, the elite can
take no comfort in believing that
this malady is confined to the
uninitiated or to the canaille,
wallowing in ignorance of some

necessary connection between
democracy and liberty.
Look at the astounding invec
tive, the accusations of being one
with the Devil (in his secularized,
updated form as a reactionary
white suprcmatist who is enrap
tured by butchery) that were
hurled against tho heretic who
denied the original sin of a sus
piciously unproductive intelli
gentsia.
Consider, even more patently,
the demand th a t Encina be
purged of paintings offensive to
Renaissance taste, an action
against contamination by that
which is alien.

• Ay 11 Hand
! I'Mitor, The Daily:
Ayn Rand belittles involvement
with people because, she says,
when you become involved with
people, you gel nothing back in
return; whereas with machines
and ideas, tangible returns are
possible, and man is basically
selfish.
All right. Granted: man is
basically selfish. But why does
Rand not acknowledge the fact
that to allow a person to be de
pendent on you, to help him,
when done in the right way, re
sults in his growth and develop
ment to tiio point where he can
stand alone, independent?
Why does she not acknowledge
; the immense satisfaction that ■
! comes from being a part of 1 his j
| process: seeing another person)
I grow and develop successfully j
i because of your own involvement
and risk?
Rand clearly and rightly points
out the perversions of this "sac
i rifice:" people who would "help"
j others out of guilt or fear, but
' without risking any threat of
their own security, which comes
i from detachment. She acknowl
edges the satisfaction that comes
from risk and involvement in de
veloping a successful material
creation or idea. Why not the
same for another person? Is not
this satisfaction a worthwhile re
i turn?
She fears such an involvement.
She finds involvement in mate
rial things and abstractions safer
{than involvement with people.
' She finds that machines and ideas
are always under control. They
will never make any demands on
{ her beyond what she wants to
give.
But people are less dependable.
| They may make demands on you
1 which you cannot meet. Or they
J may suddenly create a situation
which you cannot handle. Or they
may do things which are con
trary to the goals you are trying
to achieve by your involvement.
They are unpredictable. You
cannot control them; you can
only offer them a base of secur
ity from which they can develop
the potential inherent in every
one of them, Ayn Rand does not
have the guts to offer this base.
So she cannot achieve the sat
isfaction of seeing it work — a
more authentic and deeper satis
faction than can come from a
machine, because a human being
has greater potential than a
machine. She denies the possibil
ity of that satisfaction to avoid
recognizing her fear.
She points out the guilt that
arises when a person denies him
self his potential, and then goes
on to deny her own human poten
tial with her notion of "freedom
of action."
No man has the "freedom" to
do anything lie wants to do or to
be anything he wants to be. He
only has the freedom to become
what lie really is. The other is
not freedom at all. It is a com
pulsive attempt to escape the
fear of involvement.
