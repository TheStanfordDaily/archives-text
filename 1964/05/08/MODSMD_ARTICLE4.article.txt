# CORE Leader Analyzes Bay Area Rights Movement
## 
### BILL WERTZ 
An analysis of the civil rights
movement in the San Francisco
ai-ea and an examination of the
question of civil disobedience was
given yesterday by Bill Bradley,
San Francisco's director of the
Congress on Racial Equality
(CORE).
Bradley, sponsored on Ih e
Stanford campus by the Stanford
Young Democrats, attempted to
explain recent Negro "sit-ins,"
"shop-ins," and "lie-ins" which
have caused much controversy
in the Bay Area.
•TKOI'LK SAY that civil dis
obedience is wanton, and that it
causes bitter feelings and hurts
the Negro's cause," said Bradley.
He emphasized, however, that sit
ins and shop-ins are the only
course of action left to the Negro,
whose hopes have been frustrated
at every turn.
The recent Lucky Stores shop
in was cited by Bradley as an ex
ample of successful action, al
though many condemned it as
being irresponsible. CORE, said
Bradley negotiated with the
Lucky Stores for five months
and finally secured an agreement
for "equitable and reasonable"
hiring of Negroes.
"Bad faith surrounded Ih e
agreement," however, Bradley
said. When CORE negotiators
found that the Lucky Stores had
not lived up to their part of the
bargain, pickets were attempted.
It was only wheti these were un
successful that the shop-in was
begun.

"OUR OBJECTIVE for the
shop-in was lo place so many
people in the stores that it would
become unprofitable for Lucky
to practice discrimination." Ne
groes wheeled large baskets of
food to check-out counters and
then refused to pay for il. In
many instances the shop-in was
so effective that virtually no pur
chases could be made as long
lines jammed check-out counters.
"We placed San Francisco in
an untenable position." said Brad
ley, "In this instance we brought
about an agreement with th e
mayor which would not ha v e
otherwise been made."
Tracy Sims, leader of the Shera
ton-Palace sit-in, was supposed
to speak along with Bradley, but
she was unable to come.
