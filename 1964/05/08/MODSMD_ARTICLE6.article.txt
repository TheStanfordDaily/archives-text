standard marking instrument.
MARTIN SAII) that the ballots
were marked largely for Steve
Gruber, who ran last of the four
candidates.
The fraudulent ballots are not
included in ihe elections total.
Martin commented that there is
"still a possibility of some more
ballot stuffing of a minor na
ture. It won't affect any but the
senior class elections."
Rumors of the attempted vote
fraud were widespread yesterday

Kaiser told The Daily: "I have
no gripes to make at all. It was
a good election."
Steve Gruber stated: "I had

stuffing. I feel ce'tain that none
of my supporters were in any
way connected with this."


JOHN BRYSON and Scott Mcßride, winners in the primary race for
ASSU president, will vie next week in the finals.
