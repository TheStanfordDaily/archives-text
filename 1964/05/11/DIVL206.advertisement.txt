THE NARROW GATE TO TRUTH
Sometimes we don't like to admit our inner emptiness and anxiety. Behind
the most cheerful face may be deep despair and loneliness. All of us at one
time or another have pretended to be what we are not; somhow it's the thing
to do, the way we are supposed to act. Yet, we are all seeking to be filled,
searching in our diverse ways for truth.
Jesus said: "Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide, and the
way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter it.
For the gate is small that leads to life and few are those who find it."
(Mat. 7:13, 14 NASV). The narrow gate is this: any man can meet God
personally and individually through Jesus Christ. He said "I am the way,
the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."
It is most important to recognize this simple truth—that the way to meet
God is narrow. For Jesus warned ' Beware of false prophets who come to
you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves." (Mat. 7:15).
Even among those who call themselves Christians there are many false teach
ers who have NOT found the narrow gate. They teach complicated theology,
beefed up with smooth language and clever rhetoric which appeals to in
tellectual pride. Let us not forget the words of the Apostle Paul, who before
he was humbled by God and accepted Christ, was one of the foremost
scholars of his day:
"And brethern, I come to you, not with excellency of speech or of wis
dom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know
any thing among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified . . . And my
speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom,
but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: That your faith should not
stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God." I Cor. 2:1-4.
And Paul also wrote: "But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent
beguiled Eve through his subtility, so your minds should be corrupted from
the SIMPLICITY THAT IS IN CHRIST." It Cor. 11.3.
God will take care of false teachers, for they are among the most con
demned of all men: of false prophets, the Bible says: "These are spots in
your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves with
out water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit,
twice dead, plucked up by the roots; raging waves of the sea, foaming out
their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of
darkness forever." Jude: 1, 12, 13.
You as an individual need not rely on the claims of others or on the
statements in this article. We ask that you find out the truth for yourselves
as we have done. It is quite simple to verify in your life the promise that
"... if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature, the old things passed
away; behold new things have come." (2 Cor. 5:17). The moment you
humble yourself before God, surrender your pride totally, and ask Jesus to
come into your heart, you will meet God personally and enter the abundant
life. "... for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that He may
exalt you." I Poter 5:5, 6.

any thing among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified . . . And my
speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom,
but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: That your faith should not
stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God." I Cor. 2:1-4.
And Paul also wrote: "But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent
beguiled Eve through his subtility, so your minds should be corrupted from
the SIMPLICITY THAT IS IN CHRIST." It Cor. 11.3.
God will take care of false teachers, for they are among the most con
demned of all men: of false prophets, the Bible says: "These are spots in
your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves with
out water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit,
twice dead, plucked up by the roots; raging waves of the sea, foaming out
their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of
darkness forever." Jude: 1, 12, 13.
You as an individual need not rely on the claims of others or on the
statements in this article. We ask that you find out the truth for yourselves
as we have done. It is quite simple to verify in your life the promise that
"... if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature, the old things passed
away; behold new things have come." (2 Cor. 5:17). The moment you
humble yourself before God, surrender your pride totally, and ask Jesus to
come into your heart, you will meet God personally and enter the abundant
life. "... for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that He may
exalt you." I Poter 5:5, 6.

THE NARROW GATE TO TRUTH
Sometimes we don't like to admit our inner emptiness and anxiety. Behind
the most cheerful face may be deep despair and loneliness. All of us at one
time or another have pretended to be what we are not; somhow it's the thing
to do, the way we are supposed to act. Yet, we are all seeking to be filled,
searching in our diverse ways for truth.
Jesus said: "Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide, and the
way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter it.
For the gate is small that leads to life and few are those who find it."
(Mat. 7:13, 14 NASV). The narrow gate is this: any man can meet God
personally and individually through Jesus Christ. He said "I am the way,
the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."
It is most important to recognize this simple truth—that the way to meet
God is narrow. For Jesus warned ' Beware of false prophets who come to
you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves." (Mat. 7:15).
Even among those who call themselves Christians there are many false teach
ers who have NOT found the narrow gate. They teach complicated theology,
beefed up with smooth language and clever rhetoric which appeals to in
tellectual pride. Let us not forget the words of the Apostle Paul, who before
he was humbled by God and accepted Christ, was one of the foremost
scholars of his day:
"And brethern, I come to you, not with excellency of speech or of wis
dom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know
any thing among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified . . . And my
speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom,
but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: That your faith should not
stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God." I Cor. 2:1-4.
