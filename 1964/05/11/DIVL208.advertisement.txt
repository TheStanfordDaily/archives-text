| We're In Mourning I
All great things have to come to an end. At
least temporarily. And now it's The Stan
ford Daily—just for today, of course. The
occasion: The newspaper's annual fresh
man edition, when the young and uniniti
ated ones take over.
So on this grievous occasion, the editorial
board and upper classmen of The Stanford
Daily proclaim this, the eleventh day of
May, a period of mourning. The whole
newspaper is pretty sad. We apologize to
our readers for the inconvenience.
