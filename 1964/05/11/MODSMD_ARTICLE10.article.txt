# Wilbur Roommates

Is there really a malig
nant power choosing room
mates in Wilbur llall? "Not
so," says Dvvight Clark,
Dean of Freshman Men.
According to the dean, the
selection is done by per
sonal and psychological con
st rasts. All freshmen know
that. Remember when your
roomie got his FM?
Dean Clark said that edu
cational surveys show that
students will learn more
when they are brought into
contact with other stu
dents whose backgrounds
and ideas are different from
their own.
"We do not seek to pair
opposites, but rather to
bring together students
whose differences will com
plement each other." The
most important and obvi
ous difference which is tak
en into account by Dean
Clark's Office is geographi
cal. With almost fifty per
cent of the student body
coming from California, an
out-of-stater is almost sure
to get a Golden State room
mate.
After this has been done,
there are not very many
factors that can be of aid.
Dean Clark says,"The
really important differences
are those of personality,

about which we can know
nothing/' The offices tries
to anticipate some of these.
Private school students
are always put int-o rooms
with boys who have gone to
pub 1 i c school. Economic
backgrounds, broadly, are
also taken into considera
tion. That way each room
is sure to have a phono
graph.
Finally, interests an d
prospective majors are tak
Â«'ii into account. If your
roommate is an engineer,
you should be proud of it
because it indicates that
the Dean's Office thinks
you are creative.
The fact that all the
houses are quite different
poses a problem. When
asked about the reason why,
Dean Clark stated, "We
wish we knew." Perhaps it
is the herd instinct.
Arbitrary as the system
may seem, it works out well
in practice. There are rela
tively few changes made in
roommates. Many of th e
houses, however, have un
dertaken mass-change cam
paigns. In winter quarter
Madera House switched all
the roommates. The ration
ale for the change was that
new pairs would further en
hance the educational value
of meeting new and differ
ent people.
