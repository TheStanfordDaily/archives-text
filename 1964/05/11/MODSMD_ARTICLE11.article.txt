# Election Results Incomplete; Returns From France Lacking

### JON ROISE 
The winner of the contest for
senior class presidency and the
final tabulations in last week's
ASSU primary election are still
unknown pending the arrival of
voting results from the Stanford
in-France campus in Tours.
According to Skip Martin, elec
tions committee chairman, there
suits should have been sent to
the home campus by telegraph on
election day, as were those from
Germany and Italian campuses.
However, it now appears that the
absentee tabulations were sent
through the mails.
If the deciding votes are not
received by later today. Martin

will telephone the Freneh campus
so that the count may be com
pleted.
Martin also stated that a count
of the voters' signatures uncov
ered no fraud beyond the hun
dred stolen ballots that were
voided Thursday night. Although
the number of ballots tabulated
was nine higher than the signa
ture count, this slight difference
is attributable to people not sign
ing the rolls before voting, he;
said.
