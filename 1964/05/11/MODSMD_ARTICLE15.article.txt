# DISPUTES, RECORDS, MARK MEET
## Indians Second In West Coast Relays 
### 
It was tight, but no banana for
Stanford's track team in this
weekend's West Coast Relays at
Fresno's Ratcliffe Stadium.
The Indians came within one
thin point of beating San Jose
State for the learn crown, losing
34 to 33 in a meet alternately
marked by record-breaking per
formances and disputed calls.
A SMALL group of Stanford
alums, competing under th e
colors of the Indian Track Club,
also put on a good show, taking
home two firsts, two thirds and
a fifth.
As a team, Stanford was
strongest in the relay events,
bringing home twenty of the 33
points in three of the five relay
events. The only winning event
for Stanford in the long weekend
was the university distance med
ley event. And even this came on
a disputed call.
Stanford's first three runners
in this event, Ken Fraser, Bill
Pratt and Ha r ley Andrews,
handed anchor man Paul Schlicke
a slim lead as he started his mile
leg.
OREGON STATE was the team

running second, but it was by no
means out of the race, as Morgan
Groth was the Beaver anchor
man. Groth is the defending
NCAA mile champ. Groth actu
ally overtook Schlicke on th e
final lap of their mile, but cut in
when only a foot in front of the
Stanford man, rather than the re
quired two strides.
So incensed at this violation
was the Stanford runner that
after the finish, instead of offer
ing the customary congratula
tions to Groth, Schlicke turned to
his opponent and merely said
"You unmentionable."
Schlieke's anger, it turned out,
was deemed justifiable by the
meet officials, who disqualified
Groth and Oregon State, award
ing first place to the Tribe team.
Spits for the Stanford team
showed Fraser running a 48.6
440, Pratt at 1:50.7 for 880, An
drews at 2:57.3 for 1.320 and
Schlicke. letting down a little
after the foul, at 4:06.fi for the
mile.
INTERESTING!EY nnough, just
last week Groth was disqualified
for the same violation against

Archie San Romani in the Oregon
State-Oregon dual meet.
In other events, Stanford got a
second in the two-mile relay and
a fifth in the mile relay.
The two-mile relay event saw
San Jose's Ben Tucker and John
Garrison both crack 1:49 as they
paced their team to a meet rec
ord 7:22.0 time. Stanford's team
of Harry McCalla, Bob Milt/,
Pratt and Andrews posted a
7:31.5, but just didn't have il to
beat the sterling Spartan quartet.
THE .MIEE relay saw Cal's
quick Forrest Beatty, A 1 Cour
chesnc, Dave Fishback and Dave
Archibald speed to a 3:08.9 while
Stanford's team finished a dis
tant fifth at 3:14.
About the only other performer
of note for Stanford was Weym
Kirkland. with a sixth in the 5.000
meter run. Kirkland's finish was
good enough to gain the third
place points in the university
scoring race, though, as three
men who finished ahead of him
were not running for any college
team.
For Indian TC fans the out
standing events of the meet were

the open discus and triple jump.
Dave Weill, the current NCAA
| disc champ now throwing lor the
track cluh, hurled the disc 187'-
! 11 " to win that event.
DARKELE lIOKN, managed
a first in the triple jump at 51'-
4U" as well as a third place in
the long jump at 2.V-BV.
Dan Moore, former Stanford,
broad jumper now competing for
the track club got off an excel
lent 24'-22 ; M" leap to take fifth
i in the broad jump.
Phil White, the former Stan
ford pole vault record holder,
closed out the placing for the In
dian TC with a 1.7 (Â»V leap for
third place.
THK WEEKEND marked the
end of an 18-year Southern Cal
winning streak in the West Coast
Relays. SC\ represented only by
a token delegation of 10 men, due
to injuries to many of its stars,
still managed 26Va points and
got fourth place, less than eight
behind the winners. Fresno State,
the host, had 29 points for third.
