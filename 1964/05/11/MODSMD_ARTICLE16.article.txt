# Mason's Mastery Wins For Stanford Saturday But Gauchos Get A Split, Trojans Rout Tribe
## 
### 
The Stanford Indians, baseball
variety, will not win more 1 games
than they lose this season.
That's about the only signifi
cant result of a weekend of base
ball action wherein the Indians
bowed to Southern Cal, 92, and
split with Santa Barbara, win
ning the first 4-0 on the brilliant
four-hit pitching of John Mason,
and dropping the second, 3-2.
WERE THE Tribe to win all
three remaining games, they
woidd end the season even, 20-20,
and likely find themselves in
fourth place in the CIBA.
Southern Cal wrapped up the
CIBA race by winning a single
game against Stanford and a
doubleheader from Cal. Friday
afternoon. Stanford faced the
Trojans for the last time this sea
son, which is fortunate, for the
Indians still had not located the
victory formula and lost their
fourth straight to them, 9-2.
Walt Peterson, the ace of USCs
mound staff, went seven innings,
allowing five hits and two runs,
and received credit for thf win.
: Dick Kovacevich kept opposing
I batsmen with reasonable limits
i until the sixth inning. In the sixth
| and the seventh against Kovace
vich and in the eighth and ninth
j against Dave Dixon, the souther
; ners pushed across six of their
: nine runs. When Kovacevich left
in the eighth, he had given up 10
j hits and 6 runs.
GARY Southerland, brother of
Darrell Southcrland, Stanford's
pitching star of last year, drove
in four runs, with three singles in
five at bats.
Daryl Wilkins and Marty Pis-
I covich hammered triples to add
i to the Trojan cause.
Top batters for Stanford were
Jim Hibhs and Gary Thacher.
Gary Thacher got two singles
during the game. Hibbs hit triples
into center and right-center for
I two hits in four times at the
; plate. One of his clouts came in
the fourth and it knocked in Bob
Cox, who had walked. Hibbs then
scored on a sacrifice fly by Ron
Yett and the Indians had evened
tho score, 2-2. The tie, however,
was not longlasting.
USC added a single in the fifth
to go ahead, and staying in the
habit, the vistors increased their
lead with one or two runs in each
of the remaining innings.
On Saturday, the Indians split
a doubleheader with Santa Bar
bara.

Tho Tribe benefitted from the
four-hit pitching of John Mason
and tho four-error playing of the
Santa Barbara fielders.
STANFORD DREW first blood
in Ihe bottom of the third stanza.
Successive singles by leftfielder
' Cliff Harris and first baseman
Bob Cox. on the hit and run, put
runners on first and third. Cox
stole second, and Thacher drove
both of them in with a sharp
single.
The Cards gained two security
tallies in the fourth, as Rich
Berra singled to lead off Ihe inn
| ing. Ron Yett laid down a sacri
fice but a rattled Gaucho pitcher,
Jim Hendrickson, threw the ball
away and there were Indians on
first and second.
Then Tom Melzer laid down
another sacrifice, Hendrickson re
peated the performance, and two
runs scored.
IN THE first game. Mason was
never in really serious difficulty,
with the longest hit off him a
double, in the fif Ih. by "Scriv"
Pickens.
In the second of the twin bill,
: Santa Barbara came out on top
by a run, gaining the victory mar
gin in the top of the ninth in a
3-2 contest.
The Gauehos scored first in the
top of the third. Ray Ford
whiffed, but the pitch was wild
enough to escape Indian back
stop Jim Seckler. and Ford was
on first. Ron Ramsey was given
a free pass by starter Bob Hart
wig, and both runners were ad

vanced by Jerry Livesey's bunt.
Then, right fielder Tony Gaeh
ring found Hartwig for a two
run single and Santa Barbara had
a 2-0 lead.
THE TRIBE bounced back in
Ihe sixth, loading the sacks with
none out on a walk to Harris.
Cox hit by a pitched ball, and
an infield single surrended to
Thacher.
Garry Smith then picked up an
RBI as he grounded inlo a field
er's choice plating Harris, but
the Indians were unable to push
home any more.
The third Gaucho tally came in
the seventh as Gaehring, on third
with a triple, was singled home
by Gary Perkins.
IN THE last half of the sev
enth, the Stanford nine attempted
a last ditch rally as Harris'
double drove in Jack Wood, who
had walked and advanced to sec
ond on a groundball. But again
the Tribe was stopped short by
Gaucho pitcher Gary Ford, who
went the distance and got the
win
Stanford closes out the season
this weekend with a game against
San Francisco State, and a pair
against Santa Clara.
