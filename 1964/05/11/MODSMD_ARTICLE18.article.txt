# Bruins Top Cards For Harbach Cup
## 
### 
Each school participating won
a raco at the Harback Cup Race
Saturday but the important var
sity boat duel between Stanford,
USC, and UCLA went to the up
set-minded Bruins as the Indian
rowers' bid to get the Harbach
Trophy back fell short by ono
quarter of a length.
Stanford only the week before
had out pulled UCLA for a one
length victory but couldn't match
its boat Saturday on USC's home
course at Ballona Creek. UCLA's
victory gave it its second consecu
tive Harbach win after a long
Stanford domination.
The Tribe freshmen salvaged
some glory for Stanford by de
feating both UCLA and USC. The
Trojans won the JC race in
which the Cardinal oarsmen fin
ished third.
