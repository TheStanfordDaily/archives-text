# Ruby Defense Counsel To Speak Tomorrow
## 
### 
Melvin M. Belli, controversial Suit Francisco attorney, will speak
in Memorial Auditorium, on "Black Date: Dallas." tomorrow at -1:15
p.m., under the auspices ol the Political Union. Belli, author of
twenty-nine law hooks, was the defense counsel in the Dallas trial
of Jack Ruby, accused slayer of Lee Harvey Oswald.
Following the verdict of the trial. Belli publicly indicted the

jury, the judge, and Dallas, "the
city of hate," for their gross in
justice.
When this accusation drew a
charge of "unethical conduct"
from Walter E. Craig. President
of the American Bar Association,
Belli answered him in a twenty
six page letter which began: "I'll
l>e damnei now if I'll resign
quietly from the American Bar
Association. . . ."
CHARGING Craig and Mr.
Kuhn, the President-elect of the
American Bar Association, in
turn with unethical conduct, Belli
defended the traditional lawyer
as ethical, fair, and courageous.
He accused Craig of wanting
"the American lawyer to be a
conforming, second-rank profes
sional, a sort of athletic sup
porter to insurance companies
and big business."
Belli submitted that his refusal
to resign from the American Bar
Association might encourage an
examination into Craig's ethics.
Belli charges that Ruby was
railroaded, his complaint that
Dallas is a "City of Hate," th e
American Bar Association's prac
tice of having different sets of
ethics for individual lawyers, and
a re-evaluation of the freedom of
speech in our country.
