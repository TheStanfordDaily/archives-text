"The measure is full. Away from the pure springs, ye filthy
swine. Out from the sanctuary, ye cursed peddlers Can
ye not see that the winds of freedom arc blowing; that men are
wearied of the present state of tilings and want to bring about
a change?"
—Ulrieh van Hutten, quoted in Stanford Review,
March, 1982. Dr. Jordan, first President of the Uni
versity, selected a portion of the poem for the newly
founded University's unofficial motto. Mrs, Stan
ford "heartily approved."

"Attendance at the University is a privilege, not a right. The
University may withhold registration from or require the with

unsatisfactory, who fails to abide by University regulations, or
whose social conduct, personal habits or moral character are
deemed detrimental by the University.'
