# STUDENT POLL
## Frosh Express Reactions To First Stanford Year 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Editor 
"Now that you've been to college . . .
what do you think about Stanford?"
This, in effect, is the question The Daily
asked of about a third of the freshman class.
And, in general, they're disappointed.
Although most considered Stanford an
outstanding university and would return as
freshmen it' they could do it again, the fresh
men who replied to The Daily questionnaire
were extremely critical of Stanford's aca
demic offerings.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL, the weather is nice,
but the work is easier than 112 expected,"
wrote one Stanford male. "Students can't
follow their true interests."
A Roble girl replied. "As tired high school
seniors, we naturally looked forward to col
lege as a big. exciting, challenging, and in
teresting new experience.
"Maybe we've been disappointed with
Stanford because we've been disappointed
with life."
STUDENTS, from the trend of their
responses, had expected an intellectually
centered climate. They don't feel that their
freshman year has offered this.
"I rather expected Stanford to be a Reed
College on a large scale," wrote an Otero
House resident. "I imagined that the univer
sity would he populated by persons abso
utely dedicated to scholarly achievement.
"In other words, I expected to find a
somewhat more serious intellectual atmos
phere."
But students put much of the blame for
a hick of intellectual interest on themselves.
Wrote Chuck Ludlam in Madera House, "The
students in general do not have the confi
dence to go beyond themselves, to experi-

ment, to fail, and, above all, to contribute to
others and the university community."
BLAME was also placed heavily upon the
TA's. Students realized that teaching assist
ants are necessary, but expressed a desire
that more careful selection be made.
Size, too, was occasionally criticized. "You
meet people in classes and you meet people
at parties, and never the twain shall meet,"
wrote one girl. Most, however, liked a large
university.
Another said that girls should be allowed
to live off campus. "That's an education in
itself," she wrote.
FRED FINK in Otero House expressed
the feeling that there are "too many 'jocks'
here on scholarships for an 'intellectually in
clined' university.
"Athletics are fine, but not at the expense
of intelligence. They turned down 50 vale
dictorians this year. How many football
players didn't get in?"
Stanford women also came in for criti
cism. "The girls are all too self-conscious
about presenting the 'all-American girl' im
age. Girls should bo robust, full of life, ad
venturous, willing to stand up and argue,
and be aggressive once in a while."
IN SPITE of heavy criticism, most stu
dents polled plan to be back next year. In
deed, Stanford claims to have a low one
per cent drop-out rate, although Dean of
Freshmen Men Dwight Clark said the fig
ure is closer to two or three per cent.
Students who do drop out, Dean Clark
said, feel they're not being as productive as
they'd like to be. Many eventually return
with renewed motivation and spirit.
For most drop-outs, the dean summar
ized. it's "the right place but not the right
time."

ACCORDING to Dean Clark, freshmen
are inclined to be highly critical of their
selection of universities. Yet he saw this as
a healthy attitude in that they are altempt
ing to evaluate closely their lives at this
point.
Among Stanford's strong points, students
listed a fine faculty, excellent location and
climate, a surprisingly diverse student body,
and the General Studies program. Especi
ally admired was the Western Civ course.
One Roble girl was elated about "having
a Nobel prize winner teach little old Physics
20."
Said another Roble girl in corridor 3A,
"1 expected a half-way challenging curricu
lum, a collection of really outstanding stu
dents, plus a very social campus life. All
three criteria were fulfilled."
The Questionnaire
Last Thursday, 400 questionnaires were
distributed throughout the freshman dorms.
By Saturday, over 75 had been returned
and tabulated.
The following questions were asked:
(1) You have been at Stanford for al
most a full year now, and you probably
still have a clear image of what you had ex
pected at Stanford. Has Stanford, in general,
been what you expected? Please explain.
(2) What, in your opinion, are some of
Stanford's strong points?
(3) What, in your opinion, are some of
its major shortcomings?
(4) If you could start all over again,
would you re-apply to Stanford? Please
explain.
Students were also asked if they planned
to return next year and what they looked
forward to in their sophomore year.

ACCORDING to Dean Clark, freshmen
are inclined to be highly critical of their
selection of universities. Yet he saw this as
a healthy attitude in that they are altempt

point.
Among Stanford's strong points, students
listed a fine faculty, excellent location and

One Roble girl was elated about "having
a Nobel prize winner teach little old Physics

Said another Roble girl in corridor 3A,

three criteria were fulfilled."
The Questionnaire
Last Thursday, 400 questionnaires were
distributed throughout the freshman dorms.
By Saturday, over 75 had been returned
and tabulated.
The following questions were asked:
(1) You have been at Stanford for al
most a full year now, and you probably
still have a clear image of what you had ex
pected at Stanford. Has Stanford, in general,
been what you expected? Please explain.
(2) What, in your opinion, are some of
Stanford's strong points?
(3) What, in your opinion, are some of
its major shortcomings?
(4) If you could start all over again,
would you re-apply to Stanford? Please
explain.
Students were also asked if they planned
to return next year and what they looked
forward to in their sophomore year.
"Now that you've been to college . . .
what do you think about Stanford?"
This, in effect, is the question The Daily
asked of about a third of the freshman class.
And, in general, they're disappointed.
Although most considered Stanford an
outstanding university and would return as
freshmen it' they could do it again, the fresh
men who replied to The Daily questionnaire
were extremely critical of Stanford's aca
demic offerings.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL, the weather is nice,
but the work is easier than 112 expected,"
wrote one Stanford male. "Students can't
follow their true interests."
A Roble girl replied. "As tired high school
seniors, we naturally looked forward to col
lege as a big. exciting, challenging, and in
teresting new experience.
"Maybe we've been disappointed with
Stanford because we've been disappointed
with life."
STUDENTS, from the trend of their
responses, had expected an intellectually
centered climate. They don't feel that their
freshman year has offered this.
"I rather expected Stanford to be a Reed
College on a large scale," wrote an Otero
House resident. "I imagined that the univer
sity would he populated by persons abso
utely dedicated to scholarly achievement.
"In other words, I expected to find a
somewhat more serious intellectual atmos
phere."
But students put much of the blame for
a hick of intellectual interest on themselves.
Wrote Chuck Ludlam in Madera House, "The
students in general do not have the confi
dence to go beyond themselves, to experi-

ment, to fail, and, above all, to contribute to
others and the university community."
BLAME was also placed heavily upon the
TA's. Students realized that teaching assist
ants are necessary, but expressed a desire
that more careful selection be made.
Size, too, was occasionally criticized. "You
meet people in classes and you meet people
at parties, and never the twain shall meet,"
wrote one girl. Most, however, liked a large
university.
Another said that girls should be allowed
to live off campus. "That's an education in
itself," she wrote.
FRED FINK in Otero House expressed
the feeling that there are "too many 'jocks'
here on scholarships for an 'intellectually in
clined' university.
"Athletics are fine, but not at the expense
of intelligence. They turned down 50 vale
dictorians this year. How many football
players didn't get in?"
Stanford women also came in for criti
cism. "The girls are all too self-conscious
about presenting the 'all-American girl' im
age. Girls should bo robust, full of life, ad
venturous, willing to stand up and argue,
and be aggressive once in a while."
IN SPITE of heavy criticism, most stu
dents polled plan to be back next year. In
deed, Stanford claims to have a low one
per cent drop-out rate, although Dean of
Freshmen Men Dwight Clark said the fig
ure is closer to two or three per cent.
Students who do drop out, Dean Clark
said, feel they're not being as productive as
they'd like to be. Many eventually return
with renewed motivation and spirit.
For most drop-outs, the dean summar
ized. it's "the right place but not the right

students in general do not have the confi
dence to go beyond themselves, to experi-

ment, to fail, and, above all, to contribute to
others and the university community."
BLAME was also placed heavily upon the
TA's. Students realized that teaching assist
ants are necessary, but expressed a desire
that more careful selection be made.
Size, too, was occasionally criticized. "You
meet people in classes and you meet people
at parties, and never the twain shall meet,"
wrote one girl. Most, however, liked a large
university.
Another said that girls should be allowed
to live off campus. "That's an education in
itself," she wrote.
FRED FINK in Otero House expressed
the feeling that there are "too many 'jocks'
here on scholarships for an 'intellectually in
clined' university.
"Athletics are fine, but not at the expense
of intelligence. They turned down 50 vale
dictorians this year. How many football
players didn't get in?"
Stanford women also came in for criti
cism. "The girls are all too self-conscious
about presenting the 'all-American girl' im
age. Girls should bo robust, full of life, ad
venturous, willing to stand up and argue,
and be aggressive once in a while."
IN SPITE of heavy criticism, most stu
dents polled plan to be back next year. In
deed, Stanford claims to have a low one
per cent drop-out rate, although Dean of
Freshmen Men Dwight Clark said the fig
ure is closer to two or three per cent.
Students who do drop out, Dean Clark
said, feel they're not being as productive as
they'd like to be. Many eventually return
with renewed motivation and spirit.
For most drop-outs, the dean summar
ized. it's "the right place but not the right
time."

ACCORDING to Dean Clark, freshmen
are inclined to be highly critical of their
selection of universities. Yet he saw this as
a healthy attitude in that they are altempt
ing to evaluate closely their lives at this
point.
Among Stanford's strong points, students
listed a fine faculty, excellent location and
climate, a surprisingly diverse student body,
and the General Studies program. Especi
ally admired was the Western Civ course.
One Roble girl was elated about "having
a Nobel prize winner teach little old Physics
20."
Said another Roble girl in corridor 3A,
"1 expected a half-way challenging curricu
lum, a collection of really outstanding stu
dents, plus a very social campus life. All
three criteria were fulfilled."
The Questionnaire
Last Thursday, 400 questionnaires were
distributed throughout the freshman dorms.
By Saturday, over 75 had been returned
and tabulated.
The following questions were asked:
(1) You have been at Stanford for al
most a full year now, and you probably
still have a clear image of what you had ex
pected at Stanford. Has Stanford, in general,
been what you expected? Please explain.
(2) What, in your opinion, are some of
Stanford's strong points?
(3) What, in your opinion, are some of
its major shortcomings?
(4) If you could start all over again,
would you re-apply to Stanford? Please
explain.
Students were also asked if they planned
to return next year and what they looked
forward to in their sophomore year.
"Now that you've been to college . . .
what do you think about Stanford?"
This, in effect, is the question The Daily
asked of about a third of the freshman class.
And, in general, they're disappointed.
Although most considered Stanford an
outstanding university and would return as
freshmen it' they could do it again, the fresh
men who replied to The Daily questionnaire
were extremely critical of Stanford's aca
demic offerings.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL, the weather is nice,
but the work is easier than 112 expected,"
wrote one Stanford male. "Students can't
follow their true interests."
A Roble girl replied. "As tired high school
seniors, we naturally looked forward to col
lege as a big. exciting, challenging, and in
teresting new experience.
"Maybe we've been disappointed with
Stanford because we've been disappointed
with life."
STUDENTS, from the trend of their
responses, had expected an intellectually
centered climate. They don't feel that their
freshman year has offered this.
"I rather expected Stanford to be a Reed
College on a large scale," wrote an Otero
House resident. "I imagined that the univer
sity would he populated by persons abso
utely dedicated to scholarly achievement.
"In other words, I expected to find a
somewhat more serious intellectual atmos
phere."
But students put much of the blame for
a hick of intellectual interest on themselves.
