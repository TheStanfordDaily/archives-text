# Individualism And The Search For Identity
## 
### SCOTT DONAHEY 
The Conservative element today puts much stress on individual
ism, which is purported to be the most meaningful way a man can
establish his identity.
The opportunity to do as one's individual conscience dictates is
at the foundation of Conservative philosophy. This raises two ques
tions in one's mind: It Is individualism the sole method by which
man can establish his identity? and, 2) How far should the philoso
phy of individualism extend?
AMERICAN society has approached the question of identity by
emphasizing differences among men. A man should be himself, be
different from the rest. The word identity has two definitions. Iden
tity means the condition ot some specific person or thing. But iden
tity also means the condition of being the same as someone or some
thing.
Identity is really a combination of differences and similarities.
This may sound contradictory, but if one looks at the whole man
one can see the logic of the statement. For all in a man that is not
different must be similar. The conservatives have chosen to empha
size only one-half of man's make up. Not only should one emphasize
man's ability to be different from other men, to work harder, to
think for himself, but one should also emphasize man's basic simi
larities as well.
We are all sharers of the human condition. We are mortal beings,
we have the ability to reason, we can be emotional, we feel love,
we hate, we can be compassionate, or we can bo unfeeling. These
are things universal to all men. It is the recognition of these similari
ties that emphasizes man's responsibility to man. When one denies
any obligation to his fellow man, he is de-emphasizing his basic shar
ing of the human condition, and through this his own identity.
IT IS IMPORTANT, then, to emphasize similarities as well as
differences in establishing identity. How far should one go in his
emphasis of men's differences? Where is the dividing line between
the freedom of the individual of the Conservative and the so-called
welfare state of the Liberal?
Both sides agree that the state should allow freedom of the in
dividual as long as it does not interfere with the freedom of any
other individual. The disagreement comes as to when this interfer
ence starts. Acts of violence such as murder and assault are univer
sally considered infringements of rights. So is theft. It seems then
that any act of coercion by physical force is agreed upon as an
infringement on another's rights.
But what about coercion by non-physical force? Conservatives
deny that such a force exists. You cannot mentally force a man to
do that which he does not wish to do. But such a force not only
exists; it is in practice in the United States today. This force is dis
crimination.
CITIZENS are forced to live in certain sections of the nation, to
go to certain schools, and to enjoy certain rights, as a majority sees
lit. Even if one has the price ot a meal and behaves in an acceptable
manner, he is denied admittance to public restaurants. Even if one
has the mental capacity to attend a state institution, lie is denied the
right of attendance. A majority by simple agreement can dictate
just exactly what living standard the minority can attain. A man by
exercising his individual discretion sets up arbitrary standards of
sameness, be they standards of color, religion, or creed, and anyone
that does not meet these standards is denied use of the facility. This
then is an encroachment on the freedom of the individual by a pri
vate party who demands sameness from his fellow individuals. This
then is a place where the government must insure the freedom of the
minority to be individuals.
Man is both the same as, and different than, other men. His differ
ences should be emphasized as long as they don't prevent the right of
others lo be different. His similarities, though, should bo emphasized
equally. For if man's basic search is one for identity, he cannot
hope to find it by ignoring an important pari of himself—his shar
ing of I In* human condition with .'ill men,

the freedom of the individual of the Conservative and the so-called
welfare state of the Liberal?
Both sides agree that the state should allow freedom of the in
dividual as long as it does not interfere with the freedom of any
other individual. The disagreement comes as to when this interfer
ence starts. Acts of violence such as murder and assault are univer
sally considered infringements of rights. So is theft. It seems then
that any act of coercion by physical force is agreed upon as an
infringement on another's rights.
But what about coercion by non-physical force? Conservatives
deny that such a force exists. You cannot mentally force a man to
do that which he does not wish to do. But such a force not only
exists; it is in practice in the United States today. This force is dis
crimination.
CITIZENS are forced to live in certain sections of the nation, to
go to certain schools, and to enjoy certain rights, as a majority sees
lit. Even if one has the price ot a meal and behaves in an acceptable
manner, he is denied admittance to public restaurants. Even if one
has the mental capacity to attend a state institution, lie is denied the
right of attendance. A majority by simple agreement can dictate
just exactly what living standard the minority can attain. A man by
exercising his individual discretion sets up arbitrary standards of
sameness, be they standards of color, religion, or creed, and anyone
that does not meet these standards is denied use of the facility. This
then is an encroachment on the freedom of the individual by a pri
vate party who demands sameness from his fellow individuals. This
then is a place where the government must insure the freedom of the
minority to be individuals.
Man is both the same as, and different than, other men. His differ
ences should be emphasized as long as they don't prevent the right of
others lo be different. His similarities, though, should bo emphasized
equally. For if man's basic search is one for identity, he cannot
hope to find it by ignoring an important pari of himself—his shar
ing of I In* human condition with .'ill men,
The Conservative element today puts much stress on individual
ism, which is purported to be the most meaningful way a man can
establish his identity.
The opportunity to do as one's individual conscience dictates is
at the foundation of Conservative philosophy. This raises two ques
tions in one's mind: It Is individualism the sole method by which
man can establish his identity? and, 2) How far should the philoso
phy of individualism extend?
AMERICAN society has approached the question of identity by
emphasizing differences among men. A man should be himself, be
different from the rest. The word identity has two definitions. Iden
tity means the condition ot some specific person or thing. But iden
tity also means the condition of being the same as someone or some
thing.
Identity is really a combination of differences and similarities.
This may sound contradictory, but if one looks at the whole man
one can see the logic of the statement. For all in a man that is not
different must be similar. The conservatives have chosen to empha
size only one-half of man's make up. Not only should one emphasize
man's ability to be different from other men, to work harder, to
think for himself, but one should also emphasize man's basic simi
larities as well.
We are all sharers of the human condition. We are mortal beings,
we have the ability to reason, we can be emotional, we feel love,
we hate, we can be compassionate, or we can bo unfeeling. These
are things universal to all men. It is the recognition of these similari
ties that emphasizes man's responsibility to man. When one denies
any obligation to his fellow man, he is de-emphasizing his basic shar
ing of the human condition, and through this his own identity.
IT IS IMPORTANT, then, to emphasize similarities as well as
differences in establishing identity. How far should one go in his
emphasis of men's differences? Where is the dividing line between
the freedom of the individual of the Conservative and the so-called
welfare state of the Liberal?
