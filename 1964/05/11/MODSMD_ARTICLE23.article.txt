# Totemization Of Human Rights
## 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
The votarian sensibilities of campus civil rights activists have
informed the establishment of the Stanford Students For Fair Hous
! ing, an organization bent on the once and for all time interment of
i the Rumford Housing Initiative.
j Its graveside manner, we are told, will be simply lo illuminate the
j devious (illegal, unfair) implications of the initiative to an impetu
i ous, but generally hcalthy-souled, electorate.
AND THIS, and other such organizations, should be downright
I devastating opposition for the realtors and their cohorts. For, after
. all, opposition to the Rumford Act usually implies either a decided
! lack of information, or an incorrigible misanthropy. And quite often
) both.
But the group's main attribute, aside from the dedication and
{mental agility of its members, has to be its seductive rationale, ex
pressed best perhaps as the "totemization of human rights syn
| drome." (The student group, indeed, is whispered to have a pole of
| its very own.)
Atop the totem, colorfully carved by Eleanor Roosevelt in the
! U.N. Declaration of Human Rights, in the smiling image of Earl
j Warren, is represented the basic human l ight of association with
every other human.
RIGHTS DECREASE in importance 011 the way down, with such
contract freedoms as the right to marry, the right to holidays with
j pay, and the right to a thirty-five hour week, carved in the respective
j likenesses of Tommy Manville, Samuel Gompers, and Eleanor, her
self.
(The right to do with property as you wish is on the bottom, rep
resented by Fl. L. Hunt. Which is the part pounded into the ground.)
And having swallowed this seductive rationale whole, our diges
tive juices stimulated by the sociological erudition of Bishop Pike
and a few statements by Alan Cranston, and lying prostrate before
the totem, we now can only wonder whether this group, and other
civil rights groups throughout the country, is setting its goals high
enough â€” whether indeed it is completely following the wishes and
commands of the totem.
WE THINK NOT. Rather the problem of bigotry in housing re
quires a two-fold answer, and a simple support for Rumford is not
sufficient. It's like a pacifist without sandals, a socialist without
long brown hair, a Birchei 1 without tennis shoes.
For the Rumford Act. and similar housing legislation throughout
the country, only allows for the desegregation of a district; it doesn't
stop the majority from resegregating it again. The messy alterations
in the Washington, D.C. school system, while admittedly an all too
hoary example, show that integration is 1101 enough. Unless, that
is, you find a way to keep the integrated integrated.
Which is where the totem could come in. And should, if it ever
wants to see the proper hierarchy of rights established. For when
the whites move out after the Negroes have moved in, we see a
conflict between the one's propertied (bigoted, selfish) interests, and
the other's right to be accepted without prejudice. And the quickest
glance at Ihe totem must resolve the conflict in favor of the latter.
SEEING THIS unfair distribution of rights, the followers of the
totem should make an honest effort lo sandal the pacifist, shoe the
Bircher, or whatever, by proposing and supporting legislation (is
there any other way?) to keep members of majority groups from
moving out of recently integrated neighborhoods. With the disobedi
ent drawing fines or imprisonment, or both.
With a catchy name like "Fair Play For All Earth's Brethren."
or something of the 4 sort, we should think that campus totemists
could easily organize their considerable propagandizing abilities,
and sharp minds, behind such a positive measure. And, in a few
years, we may all be shouting, "Property freedom is not property
I license." and singing, "red and yellow, black and white, integrated
Iby our might . . And everyone will love each other whether they
want to or not.
