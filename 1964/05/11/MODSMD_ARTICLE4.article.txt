# Christian Church Undergoing Revolt
## 
### 
The Christian Church is under
going a revolution, a renewal, ac
cording to Rev. Harold Bredeson,
who spoke at Memorial Church
yesterday. Bredeson, a Calvinist,
is minister at the First Reformed
Church, Mt. Vernon, New York.
"That a revolution is needed
I think we are all agreed," Brede
son started. He compared th e
today as "a museum of Christian
doctrine" and he referred to Ber
tram! Russell's comment that we
are living in the "post-Christian
era." Bredeson said many church
men today are like "spiritual
zombies" going about the busi
ness of believing without believ
ing.
"SPONTANEITY." he said, "is
the key word in thinking of Jesus
Christ." But unlike the first cen
tury Christians, most modern
Christians are not fountains of
faith, but rather "pumps that
have to be primed."
Nevertheless, Bredeson believes
that the Christian Church is now
being revitalized. "The words of
Joel are being fulfilled . . . Young
men are dreaming dreams and
seeing visions . . ." The time has
come.
