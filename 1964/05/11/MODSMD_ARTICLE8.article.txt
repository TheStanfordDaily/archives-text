# Freshmen Present Plan For New Housing Draw
## To Be Considered By LASSU 
### JIM SELNA News Editor 
Motivated by dissatisfaction
with the present upperclass men's
living system and the method
of selection, three freshmen laid
a proposal before LASSU last
Thursday which would radically
change the men's living system.
Otto Schatz, Jan Jacobi, and
Doug Sorenson are the propo
nents of a hill referred to the
By-Laws Committee which would
assign upperclass men to one of
the living groups a university
residence, an eating club, or a
fraternity on the basis of a
draw.
Tllli TllliKK agreed that th e j
greatest faults in the present sys- i
tem are the selectivity of the I
fraternities and eating clubs and |
the lack of diversity in all groups. |
Schatz fold The Daily that he i
did not want to "Wilburize the;
campus." He also pointed out that i
rush, by its "discriminatory na- i
lure," denies freshmen full choice !
in determining where they will j
live,
Schatz criticized the fraternities
and eating groups for breeding a
philosophy of "living only with
the people you like." He stated
that this type of living eliminates
diversity and restricts the student
in his learning opportunities by
associating with only "mirror
images of himself."
In stressing the importance of
the living group as a place of
learning, Jacobi and Schatz stated
that the university had a duty to
impose a beneficial diversity in
the living groups, though they
hoped that their proposal might
be initialed by student rather
than university action.
THE PROPOSAL would require i
all male students wishing to live)
on campus or join an eating club
to participate in a draw similar I
to the one now in use for women.;
Men would have the right to draw ;
individually or in group up to ]
eight. On the basis of the draw
the students would be assigned i
to a living group. Schatz admit- i
tod that the proposal would in ef-1
feet eliminate national fraternities â– 
at Stanford.
Jacobi denied the right of a
living group to select its mem
bers. Referring to the present
methods of rush for fraternities
and eating clubs, he stated that
the groups "do not have Ihc right
to make value judgments on peo
ple." He further noted that the I
present form of appraisal used !
by these groups is invalid and a j
denial of Ihe student's dignity
and basic rights.
COMMENTING on the recently i
presented changes in rush proce-1
dure they said that the problem i
was not in rush but in the system \
itself. Schatz pointed out that!
freshman dissatisfaction with the!
method of choosing a living group
has increased despite the annual j
efforts of LASSU to improve the j
system.
