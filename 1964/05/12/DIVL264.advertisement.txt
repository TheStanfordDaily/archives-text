THE CRUX OF THE MATTER
All men cringe at the thought of a thermonuclear war triggered by a care
less statesman, a religious zealot, or an errant computer. But very soon most
of lis turn back to every day problems, crowding these unpleasant thoughts
out of our minds—for the world situation, if looked at realistically, is over
whelming.
Many people arc also inclined to put aside day after day questions about
| God and their own eternal destiny. These thoughts, too. may seem incom
prehensible and perplexing. However, the truth of God is readily available
and can be understood, and we owe it to ourselves to set aside the debris of
20th century living and gain a knowledge of God's eternal truths.
The reality of God is not to be found in the pronouncements of those
modern day theologians or sophisticated philosophers who appeal to intellec
tual pride. The truth is the truth. It never changes. The best test of the
truth is that it never changes. One reality which has not changed in two
I millenia is Jesus Christ. He has been misrepresented, maligned, and counter*
I feited by other religions and cults (reason enough to suspcct that someone
I or something wants to keep you from believing in Him), but Jesus remains the
i same—complete, necessary and sufficient. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is:
. . . How that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and
that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the
scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that
he was seen of above 500 brethren at once; . . . And last of all he was seen
of me also. ..." I Cor. 15:1-8.
The Christian message is addressed not only to the world, but to you
personally. If you have not done anything about Jesus Christ, if you have
not acceptcd Him personally and individually, you arc as lost as any man
could be, regardless of your upbringing or your religious beliefs. If you
belong to Christ, there will be no douht in your mind. Whatever you do, j
don't take some elscs word for it or go along with the crowd. The crowd
is dead wrong and always has been.
"But now apart from the Law, the righteousness of God has been mani* j
festcd, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteousness |
of God through faith in jesus Christ for all who believe, for there is no dis
tinction; for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, being jus- j
tified as a gift by His gracc through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; .
Whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in Mis blood through faith.
. . ." ( Romans 3 :21-25).
The one ultimate reality in this universe is Jesus Christ, the risen Lord
and Saviour. He is the One that really counts. This is the heart of the truth,
this is the crux of the matter.

THE CRUX OF THE MATTER
All men cringe at the thought of a thermonuclear war triggered by a care
less statesman, a religious zealot, or an errant computer. But very soon most
of lis turn back to every day problems, crowding these unpleasant thoughts
out of our minds—for the world situation, if looked at realistically, is over
whelming.
Many people arc also inclined to put aside day after day questions about
| God and their own eternal destiny. These thoughts, too. may seem incom
prehensible and perplexing. However, the truth of God is readily available
and can be understood, and we owe it to ourselves to set aside the debris of
20th century living and gain a knowledge of God's eternal truths.
The reality of God is not to be found in the pronouncements of those
modern day theologians or sophisticated philosophers who appeal to intellec
tual pride. The truth is the truth. It never changes. The best test of the
truth is that it never changes. One reality which has not changed in two
I millenia is Jesus Christ. He has been misrepresented, maligned, and counter*
I feited by other religions and cults (reason enough to suspcct that someone
I or something wants to keep you from believing in Him), but Jesus remains the
i same—complete, necessary and sufficient. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is:
. . . How that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and
that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the
scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that
he was seen of above 500 brethren at once; . . . And last of all he was seen
of me also. ..." I Cor. 15:1-8.
The Christian message is addressed not only to the world, but to you
personally. If you have not done anything about Jesus Christ, if you have
not acceptcd Him personally and individually, you arc as lost as any man
could be, regardless of your upbringing or your religious beliefs. If you
belong to Christ, there will be no douht in your mind. Whatever you do, j
don't take some elscs word for it or go along with the crowd. The crowd
is dead wrong and always has been.
"But now apart from the Law, the righteousness of God has been mani* j
festcd, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteousness |
of God through faith in jesus Christ for all who believe, for there is no dis
tinction; for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, being jus- j
tified as a gift by His gracc through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; .
Whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in Mis blood through faith.
. . ." ( Romans 3 :21-25).
The one ultimate reality in this universe is Jesus Christ, the risen Lord
and Saviour. He is the One that really counts. This is the heart of the truth,
this is the crux of the matter.

THE CRUX OF THE MATTER
All men cringe at the thought of a thermonuclear war triggered by a care
less statesman, a religious zealot, or an errant computer. But very soon most
of lis turn back to every day problems, crowding these unpleasant thoughts
out of our minds—for the world situation, if looked at realistically, is over
whelming.
Many people arc also inclined to put aside day after day questions about
| God and their own eternal destiny. These thoughts, too. may seem incom
prehensible and perplexing. However, the truth of God is readily available
and can be understood, and we owe it to ourselves to set aside the debris of
20th century living and gain a knowledge of God's eternal truths.
The reality of God is not to be found in the pronouncements of those
modern day theologians or sophisticated philosophers who appeal to intellec
tual pride. The truth is the truth. It never changes. The best test of the
truth is that it never changes. One reality which has not changed in two
I millenia is Jesus Christ. He has been misrepresented, maligned, and counter*
I feited by other religions and cults (reason enough to suspcct that someone
I or something wants to keep you from believing in Him), but Jesus remains the
i same—complete, necessary and sufficient. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is:
. . . How that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and
that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the
scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that
he was seen of above 500 brethren at once; . . . And last of all he was seen
of me also. ..." I Cor. 15:1-8.
The Christian message is addressed not only to the world, but to you
personally. If you have not done anything about Jesus Christ, if you have
not acceptcd Him personally and individually, you arc as lost as any man
could be, regardless of your upbringing or your religious beliefs. If you
belong to Christ, there will be no douht in your mind. Whatever you do, j
don't take some elscs word for it or go along with the crowd. The crowd
is dead wrong and always has been.
"But now apart from the Law, the righteousness of God has been mani* j
festcd, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteousness |
of God through faith in jesus Christ for all who believe, for there is no dis
tinction; for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, being jus- j
tified as a gift by His gracc through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; .
Whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in Mis blood through faith.
. . ." ( Romans 3 :21-25).
The one ultimate reality in this universe is Jesus Christ, the risen Lord
and Saviour. He is the One that really counts. This is the heart of the truth,
this is the crux of the matter.
