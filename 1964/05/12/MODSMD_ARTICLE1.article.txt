• Cuban Invasion Is IS ear
MIAMI. Fla. — Cuban exiles said yester
day they believe zero hour is near for begin
ning a long, hard-fought campaign of land
ings in Cuba by anti-Communist action groups
seeking the overthrow of Fidel Castro.
For months, various militant organizations
of Cuban refugees, many with guerrilla ex
perience under Castro or training in the U.S.
Army, have been planning such attacks.
Under this program, small groups of ex
iles, starting from outside U.S. territory,
would invade their homeland for- purposes of
sabotage, subversion and harrassment of the
Communist regime. They would hope for an
uprising among Cubans in general and Cas
tro's military in particular to help them.
Months ago they fixed May 20, anniver
sary date of Cuban independence, as the dead
line for their infiltration.

MIAMI. Fla. — Cuban exiles said yester

seeking the overthrow of Fidel Castro.
For months, various militant organizations
of Cuban refugees, many with guerrilla ex

Army, have been planning such attacks.
Under this program, small groups of ex

would invade their homeland for- purposes of
sabotage, subversion and harrassment of the
Communist regime. They would hope for an
uprising among Cubans in general and Cas
