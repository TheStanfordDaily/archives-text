# Bryson, McBride Split Over Housing Issue
## Also Disagree On Rush Policy 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
Presidential candidates Jo h n
Bryson and Scott Mcßride held
two debates yesterday as the
ASSU presidential race neared a
close.
ONE OF THE sharpest splits
between the two candidates was
on the matter of university hous
ing. Bryson supports the creation
of a student committee on hous
ing which could make recom
mendations to the administrative
offices concerned with the formu
lation of housing policy.
Mcßride, while favoring pre
sentation of student ideas on
housing, suggested that "rather
: than reconstituting a committee,
I student officers and other stu
dents should offer suggestions"
: to the administration.
ANOTHER area of disagree
ment between the two candidates
was in the matter of LASSU's
handling of the rush committee
proposal which was defeated by
i he Legislature last Thursday.
Mcßride said flatly that he
feels that rush is a matter "out
side the Legislature." Bryson
maintained that the Legislature,
| as the supreme body for deter
mining student policy, has to ap
{prove matters involving rush,
even if this approval is only a
"rubber stamp."
McBRIDE said that the stand
ing committees of the Legislature
are now appointed by the ASSU
President at the start of the year.
He feels that if independence of
the Legislature is to be main
tained this would have to be
changed.
He also called for more coordi
nation of the activities of th e
! ASSU boards and commissions
by the president, suggested meet
j ings of the President and the Vice
i President with the heads of these
i bodies at least once a month.
Bryson noted that there is now
} a lack of communication between
1 the executive and the st u dent
j body, and a lack of student inter
i est in the government.
When asked if either of them
i had promised a political job to
jget more supporters, both can
didates answered with an em
phatic, "No!" and stressed that
any rumors of patronage were
false.
Ed Kaiser, who was defeated in
primary election held last week,
yesterday issued a statement to
The Daily urging his supporters
to continue to work actively for
whichever candidate they favor.
"In the heat of a political cam
paign we as participants often
lose sight of the basic ideals and
beliefs which all the candidates,
supporters and students share
