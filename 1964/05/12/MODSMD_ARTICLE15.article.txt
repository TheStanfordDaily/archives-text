PETITION Ol' REFERENT)I'M
According; to tlie Constitution of the Asso- |
ciated Students of Stanford University, Ar- j
tiele IV. Section 3, Clause B:
The Women's Council shall have original \
jurisdiction in nil eases involving a viola- |
tion by a woman of the Fundamental Stand- I
ard. and all rules, except those eases properly \
under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Colin- \
cil or recognized subordinate councils. It \
shall hear appeals from the decisions of alt '
subordinate teamen's councils.
and Article IV. Section 5, Clause D:
The Judicial Council, Men's Council, or I
Women's Council may refer cases to any
subordinate council for action ?eith the ap
proval of Stanford University.
THE IWDERSMJNEI) feel the following
proposal should be presented for referendum
to the undergraduate women students of
Stanford University:
I. That the Auxiliary Committee in upper
class residences have the power to appeal
and explain late minutes, to reprimand habit
ual carelessness, and have the authority to
hear the following cases: fust offense viola
tions involving poor judgment or gross negli
gence which have resulted in IS minutes or
more of lateness. That they have, for the
handling of these cases, all the punitive
powers of Women's Council within the rec
ognized bounds of Council precedent, and
that they have full authority to call wit
nesses and gather information which may
be pertinent to ihe individual case.
11. Women's Council will retain the right
to hear all other cases, and will review the
minutes of each case handled by the Auxil
iary Committee. The Council will retain the
right to call a new trial of any case which
I it feels has been mishandled. Appeal of an
I Auxiliary Committee's decision may be di
rected to Women's Council. In these cases.
Women's Council .reserves the right to set
aside a decision of the Auxiliary Committee.
111. In special eases, the defendant may,
with permission of the area Women's Coun
cil representative and a representative of
the aria Auxiliary, request a hearing before
the Council, even if her offense falls within
the categories delegated to the Committee.
Such eases are to be exceptional.
I \ . T he Council retains the right to with
draw from any Auxiliary Committee the
authority delegated to it, if at any time the
Council feels that the Auxiliary Committee

is acting in an irresponsible or incompetent
manner. Also, should an area Auxiliary
Committee withdraw their approval of Un
delegated powers. Women's Council would
reassume that committee's powers and re
sponsibilities in all Fundamental Standard
violation cases.
V. These are the only respects in which
the system will change. All Auxiliary Com
mittees will submit complete minutes of
cases handled within two weeks to the area
Woman's Council representative. Freshman
Auxiliary Committees will function as he
fore. All cases of Fundamental Standard
violations committed by freshman women
will be heard by Women's Council.
CEN ERA I. PROCEDURE for upperdass
Auxiliary Committees will remain as fol
lows:
A, A Women Council member will be pres
ent in the role of consultant. She will
not have a vote but should he a source
of informamtion on precedent.
I!. Possible Fundamental Standard Viola
tions will still be referred to the Women's
Council representative and she will then
refer them to Women's Council or the
Auxiliary Committee.
C. The Council member is responsible for
bringing to the hearing the permanent
record cards of the girls whose cases are
being heard, and recording the Commit
tee's decision of the case.
1). The decision of the Auxiliary Committees
and of Women's Council arc always
recommendations to the Dean.
