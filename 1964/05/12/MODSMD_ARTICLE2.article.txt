## 
### 
The AWS Judicial Council ref
erendum on tomorrow's ballot
has as its primary purpose the
breaking down of the isolation of
Women's Council, according to
Marian Leib. chairman of th e
Women's Judicial Council.
The members of the individual
houses will also have a greater
idea of student judicial processes,
she added.
The system that would bo in
stituted by the referendum,
printed in full on page two, has
been working on a trial basis for
one quarter.
According to Miss Leib, mem
bers of the judicial council are
satisfied with the new method of
operation. The referendum, she
said, will determine whether
women undergraduates as a
whole think it has worked out.
The new system consists pri
marily of a delegation of some
of Women's Judicial Council
power to other councils in the
living groups themselves.
