# DeSYLVIA SHINES
## Inconsistent Play Marks Scrum 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
Football in earnest returned to the Farm Sat
urday afternoon in sun-drenched Stanford Sta
I dium.
A crowd of about a hundred sun-worshippers
and/or gridiron fanatics was on hand to see John
Ralston run some six units of his charges through
their paces in their thirteenth drill and second
real scrum.
BECAUSE OF the new semi-free substitution
rules the scrimmage was able to simulate game
conditions, even though changes in the alignment
were constantly being made.
This reporter, and the several other spectators
who had seen a few of the other practices 1 his
spring, sat in anxious expectation of some specta
cular aerial fireworks. We were rewarded only
once.
About midway through the scrimmage. Terry
DeSylvia, by far the best-looking of the four men
who saw action, hit Dale Rubin, a recent transfer
from Cal by way of Oakland City College, for 15
yards and what would have been a score had any
one been keeping score.
THE INTERESTING thing about the play was
| that it came on what would have been fourth
| down and long yardage. This means that had it.
i actually been a game, the play would never even
| have been tried as the Cards would have punted.
DeSylvia was the only one of the quarterbacks
who managed to get off any good throws at all.
Dave Lewis, the freshman standout, was not a

standout at all on Saturday, His passes were
wobbly, with two exceptions, and generally off the
mark.
Dick Berg, listed on the third team before ihe
practice, and last year's regular, was his usual un
spectacular self. One improvement was noticeable
in Berg's playing, though when running the
ball, he seemed a lot shiftier than he had been
last fall.
DON COOK and John Propstra, the other two
quarterbacks who worked, both failed to impress.
So far as the actual play went, the scrimmage
was marked by an extremely inconsistent defense.
The line and the linebackers were quite effective
in stopping most passing plays before they got
off the ground.
But when passes were gotten off and thrown
well, the target was usually open, wide open. On
several occasions, the defensive backs were very
lax — on Rubin's 45-yard reception, he evaded
five would-be lacklers, all of whom had good shots
at him.
STRANGELY, considering how effective the
pass rush was, the defense was extremely weak
on rushing plays. Fullbacks John Read, Mike Hib
ler and Glenn Myers were consistently able to
grind out four or five yards and halfback Bob
Blunt got off several good jaunts, two of ihem for
scores.
The offense showed some flashes of brilliance,
particularly when DeSylvia was at the helm and
Blunt at half. In four attempts, DeSylvia led his
team 1o three scores. The ot her series was halted
by an interception by a defending interior lineman.

i actually been a game, the play would never even
| have been tried as the Cards would have punted.
DeSylvia was the only one of the quarterbacks
who managed to get off any good throws at all.
Dave Lewis, the freshman standout, was not a

standout at all on Saturday, His passes were
wobbly, with two exceptions, and generally off the
mark.
Dick Berg, listed on the third team before ihe
practice, and last year's regular, was his usual un
spectacular self. One improvement was noticeable
in Berg's playing, though when running the
ball, he seemed a lot shiftier than he had been
last fall.
DON COOK and John Propstra, the other two
quarterbacks who worked, both failed to impress.
So far as the actual play went, the scrimmage
was marked by an extremely inconsistent defense.
The line and the linebackers were quite effective
in stopping most passing plays before they got
off the ground.
But when passes were gotten off and thrown
well, the target was usually open, wide open. On
several occasions, the defensive backs were very
lax — on Rubin's 45-yard reception, he evaded
five would-be lacklers, all of whom had good shots
at him.
STRANGELY, considering how effective the
pass rush was, the defense was extremely weak
on rushing plays. Fullbacks John Read, Mike Hib
ler and Glenn Myers were consistently able to
grind out four or five yards and halfback Bob
Blunt got off several good jaunts, two of ihem for
scores.
The offense showed some flashes of brilliance,
particularly when DeSylvia was at the helm and
Blunt at half. In four attempts, DeSylvia led his
team 1o three scores. The ot her series was halted
by an interception by a defending interior lineman.
Football in earnest returned to the Farm Sat
urday afternoon in sun-drenched Stanford Sta
I dium.
A crowd of about a hundred sun-worshippers
and/or gridiron fanatics was on hand to see John
Ralston run some six units of his charges through
their paces in their thirteenth drill and second
real scrum.
BECAUSE OF the new semi-free substitution
rules the scrimmage was able to simulate game
conditions, even though changes in the alignment
were constantly being made.
This reporter, and the several other spectators
who had seen a few of the other practices 1 his
spring, sat in anxious expectation of some specta
cular aerial fireworks. We were rewarded only
once.
About midway through the scrimmage. Terry
DeSylvia, by far the best-looking of the four men
who saw action, hit Dale Rubin, a recent transfer
from Cal by way of Oakland City College, for 15
yards and what would have been a score had any
one been keeping score.
