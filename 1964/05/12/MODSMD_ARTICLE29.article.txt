# The 						Press And Vote Counting
## Editorial 
### 
LASSU voted down a resolution Thurs
day to allow the press — The Daily and
KZSU — to sit in on the counting of ASSU
ballots.
It was a miserable display of faith in
democratic institutions.
EVEN MORE MISERABLE was the
Election Commission's handling of the vote
counting Thursday. According to the pol
icy established this year by chairman Skip
Martin, die tallying is to be closed to the
press and student body until the final re
sults are announced.
Not even so much as a bulletin board,
listing the candidates and their votes, was
put up in Tresidder Thursday.
Vet word of election developments was
leaked out to certain people during the en
tire evening. And rumors became rampant.
At one point a KZSU reporter entered
the election counting room, lie was brus
quely told by Martin: "I don't care who
you are. Out!"
EARLIER ON THURSDAY Martin
remarked to a Daily stall member that lie

had heard no reports of illegal voting prac
tices. Yet it is now known that 100 fraudu
lent ballots were discovered the night be
fore, on Wednesday.
Thursday evening Martin slammed the
door in the face of a Daily reporter who
politely asked him if he could confirm re
ports of these 100 ballots.
Martin told the reporter later, without
apologizing: "The least 1 have to worry
about are Daily reporters and KZSU."
THE ARGUMENTS used in LASSU to
kill the "open counting" resolution were as
stuffy as an ASSU ballot box. Items:
• The counting has never been open
before. This is not true. Just last year a
newsman sat in on the counting session.
And in past years a board has been set up
giving a running account of the election
figures.
• // would add to the general confusion
to have newsmen in the room. With this

argument, why have elections at all? They
get pretty contusing, too. Think of how
much less confusing it would be to have
no ballots to worry about.
• If something went wrong — for in
stance, a mistake in the counting — the stu
dent body shouldn't know about it until it
has been corrected. This is a very good
argument — for opening the? counting ses
sions. It is precisely for this reason that the
press and the entire student body should
know what is going on. Martin and his
commission fail to understand that one of
the most important responsibilities of the
press is to hold public officials in public
accountability. This watch dog principle
has been a basic tenet of freedom of the
press in America.
California law even opens the ballot
counting to the entire public. When ad
vised of this, LASSU By-Laws Committee
Chairman Burke Burright said: 'We're dii
ferent from California and, for that matter,
the nation."
Ho sounded as if Stanford student gov
ernment should be proud of it.
