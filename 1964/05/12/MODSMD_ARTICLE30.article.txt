## Worship Should Be Confined To Church, Home 
### 
Kditor, The Daily:
The founding fathers of this
great Republic were painfully
aware of those nations of Europe
where State and Church were
bound together and they wanted
none of it for their country. They
laid it down as a Constitutional
law that there shall be a separa
tion of church and state, and they
forbade their children ever to
make religion either a qualifica
tion or a barrier to office.
Furthermore, the separation of
church and state ought to be
carefully guarded if you wish to
avoid the terrible history of those
nations where a church controlled
a state, and where a state eon
trolled a church. Religion is a
man's personal affair and to in
vade his private life of faith is
both desecration and tyranny.
Some Americans believe that
religion has great virtue and is
of supreme value. But in a free
society a man can be a good
American and be an atheist, and
conversely, he can be a religion
ist and be a poor American. In a
free society a man ought to have
a right not to believe in God.
Some of you believe that he is in
error, but he should have a right
to believe that you are in error.
There is a tendency in Amer
ica today to make religion a form
of public devotion and to invade
the private sanctuary of the in
dividual. The fact is that you are
a nation composed of people with
a wide variety of religious beliefs
and forms of worship which
should be respected and confined
to the church and the home.
It is one thing to hope that
your public schools will develop
young people with moral con
victions, and quite something else
to confuse them with formal ex
pressions of particular religions.
This kind of religion in your
public schools, as in any political
institution, is both improper and
harmful.
Why should the state do some
thing for you that you fail to
achieve by your own efforts in
your churches, and homes. For
mal religious practices bearing
the stamp of political approval
arc terribly embarrassing and
dangerous.

Editor, The Daily:
Some significant facts were
omitted from the story about the
ballot box stuffing in Friday's
Daily. In case they are never
brought out on the front page, I
wish to present them here.
Of the 100 fraudulent ballots
mentioned, 98 were cast for Gru
her, and two for Mcßride. Due to
the RF nature of Grubor's cam
paign, it seems that the offenders
Kreportedly a single fraternity
house) either intended to water
the RF ballots or tried to push
some candidate for some closely
contested office on the ballot.
All 100 disqualified ballots
were reportedly east for McKen
zie for Senior President. There
is no doubt that McKenzie did not
condone this action. However,
this fact should he reported just
as much as the "votes" for Gru
her.
McKenzie is, as a matter of
fact, a quite serious candidate.
Although ho was asked to run
for ASSU President by the group
who also asked John Bryson (and
Dennis Weaver), he refused the
candidacy on the grounds of lack
of lime.

A conference oi Wedin - phil
osophy student leaders during
nomination time . . . resolved this
difficulty. He has stated in cam
paigning for his present aspira
tion that he would use the Senior
Presidency as a platform 112 r o m
which he could help run ASSU
government.
I fail to understand how either
the voters or Mr. Bryson can ap
prove of this unusual power of
the Senior Class government.
Whether or not McKenzie is bet
ter qualified for this office, th e
ASSU President should run his
own job, because he is elected for
it. I encourage whoever wins to
do so.
In case one gets the impression
that the Bryson-McKenzie camp
was making such vital decisions
as who should run at quite a late
date, it was not until April 22
that Scott Mcßride, a "compro
mise candidate," decided to run.
By the following weekend he
had produced the complete (but
generally considered weak) plat
form which is so similar to that
of the other candidates, except in
the excellent proposal for Politi
cal Union. That body, inciden
tally, was run by Mcßride in a
quite unpraised fashion. Its first
significant event is tentatively
scheduled for the day before the

election finals.
In passing, I would like to com
mend Skip Martin and Election
Com for the impartial and highly
efficient counting of a record
number of ballots, and the de
tecting of all the fraudulent bal
lots.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Elections
Chairman Skip Martin reports
that of the total bad ballots, the
Elections Committee found 95.
They presume the others did
not make it into the election
box. The bad ballots have 88
votes for Gruber, six for Mc-
Bride. For Senior Class I'resi
dent, the votes were: (i~> for Mc-
Kenzie, two for liuvood, two
for Curry, and four for Crock
well.
• Civil Kijslits Action
Editor, The Daily:
To those students interested in
the civil rights movement who
are not participating in the Mis
sissippi Summer Project or who
are not working to defeat the
Amendment proposed by Ihe
CREA initiative that would nul
lify extant fair-housing legisla
tion as well as prevent any future
state consideration of fair-hous

ing proposals, to you I suggest
the following course of summer
action:
1. Familiarize yourself in depth
with the issues involved in Ihe
initiative (if you are a Califor
nian), in the Mississippi Project,
2. Increase others' awareness
2. Increase other's awareness
of the magnitude and implica
tions of the civil rights revolu
tion. Send information to rela
tives, friends, local organizations
and your hometown newspaper.
3. Encourage informed discus
sion of the pros and cons of spe
cific issues whenever possible.
4. Become aware of any racial
problems in your own community
and the possibilities for action.
If you are committed to Ihe
civil rights movement, be willing
to let others know of your deci
sion. Write to your local news
paper to inform the eommuity
of your concern, of the work
Stanford students are doing in
California and Mississippi, and of
the necessary decision we each
must make as to where we stand.
Well-informed, con c erne d
United States voters can make
intelligent and just decisions.
Make your presence and your
convictions known t<> them.

• Hawley's Thesis
Editor, The Daily:
We regret that we were unable
to find and thus to examine Mr.
Hawley's thesis that "classes and
class obligations do not exist."
Bui perhaps Ihe three hundred
word limit prevented Mr. Hawley
from achieving coherency in his
presentation, leading us to sug
gest that the "wave of the future"
surely demands more elucidation
than three-hundred words can
provide. Since we apparently
neither have thought for our
selves, nor read Ayn Rand, could
Mr. Hawley enlighten us on these
points in a series of letters or a
column?
Does Mr. Hawley argue t hat
"classes and class obligations" do
not, in fact exist today, or that
they should not?
If by rights, he means "sanction
i for independent action," who
[gives this sanction?
Does the philosophy of Individ
ualism allow for the equality of
i human beings?
If justice is not to be rendered
j by a "vigilante committee," then
by whom? The government? Is
| this not, by his definition a tra-
I vesty of the individual? By the
| individual? Is anarchy then to re
place "mob rule?"
How do inequities result from
the absence of soceity? Does not
[inequity imply at least to people,
and therefore a society?
Is the mere possession of "in
alienable rights" enough? Is it
not meaningless to possess some
thing without being able to enjoy
it? Are Negroes able to enjoy
I their rights?
We hope Mr. Hawley will an
swer these questions in the same
spirit that we ask them, without
resorting again to such juvenile
rhetorical devices as "It is" in
place of logical answers, and
without such purile polemics as
denouncing any opposition to his
ideas as that of "jeering cowards."
Name-calling has no place in a
reasonable argument, and its ap
pearance leads to Ihe natural sus
picion that the name-caller is in
capable of ;i reasonable argument.
All too often, in fact, it is the sign
of fanaticism.
