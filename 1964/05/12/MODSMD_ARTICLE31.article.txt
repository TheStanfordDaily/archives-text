# Notes And Observations
## Presidential Candidates: The 'Important' Issues 
### John Bonine 
Battling down to the wire, the
candidates for ASSU president are
once again raising the political
temperature of Stanford to a
fever pitch.
The outcome of this vital elec
tion will affect the lives of 10,000
students and the issues being
earnestly debated can be ignored
only at our peril.
So we are told.
In truth, student government
at Stanford is largely irrelevant.
In probability, student govern
ment at any university is irrele
vant. Students at Columbia Uni
versity saw this several years ago
and abolished theirs. Stanford is
beginning to come around to
this point of view: a poll taken by
The Daily last year showed 22
per cent in favor of abolition.
But wo are probably stuck with
what we have got and we must
make the best of it (or ignore it).
There is a considerable amount
of dissatisfaction with the candi
dates running because there is a
considerable amount of dissatis
faction with the issues on which
they are basing their efforts. "Dy
namism" in student government
interests very few of us.
Steve Gruber's suggestion that
LASSU be abolished is not en
tirely farcical. Last year's Daily
poll showed only 53 per cent felt
student government was "worth
while." On the question, "Do you
think the ASSU Legislature
serves a useful purpose?" 41 per
cent replied No. 37 per cent Yes.
The Civil Rights Secretariat has
caused a certain minimal amount
of dissension in the otherwise pla
cid campaign. Scott Mcßride has
come out in favor of making the
Secretariat a voluntary organiza
tion and self-supporting, like
other political groups on campus.

(The Secretariat was originally
granted $300 by LASSU as an "in
formation center." It got an adrii
tio n a 1 "bailing out" after
the Civil Rights Conference, be
cause promises of an additional
LASSU appropriation had been
given to the dean as a condition
of the Conference's taking place.)
The issue of voluntary political
organizations at Stanford has not
been raised. For the first time in
Stanford history, partisan groups
were allowed on campus last
spring. The regulations imposed
on them were so harsh as to dis
courage their activities, however.
No candidate for the ASSU presi
dency has offered to do anything
to liberalize both University and
ASSU policy toward such groups.
One of the oddest proposals in
this campaign is the election of
tliree of the six Stanford NSA
delegates. Why three? (A little
patronage for the other three?)
No candidate has raised the basic
issue of continued Stanford par
ticipation in NSA, and continued
expenditure of over $2,000 per
year to send the half-dozen chosen
few for a week's paid vacation.
Thus far, most of the "issues"
discussed by the candidates have
been bogus, created specifically
for the campaign. There has been
a general avoidance of what
might be termed important issues.
Very probably this is because
there are no important issues.
Indeed, Steve Gruber's state
ment last week is worth consider
ation: he said, in part, "If you
think I am going to run all over
campus holding inane little dis
cussions in living groups and
wasting my time and money on
posters, you are out of your cot
ton-picking minds."
Amen,

think the ASSU Legislature
serves a useful purpose?" 41 per
cent replied No. 37 per cent Yes.
The Civil Rights Secretariat has
caused a certain minimal amount
of dissension in the otherwise pla
cid campaign. Scott Mcßride has
come out in favor of making the
Secretariat a voluntary organiza
tion and self-supporting, like
other political groups on campus.

(The Secretariat was originally
granted $300 by LASSU as an "in
formation center." It got an adrii
tio n a 1 "bailing out" after
the Civil Rights Conference, be
cause promises of an additional
LASSU appropriation had been
given to the dean as a condition
of the Conference's taking place.)
The issue of voluntary political
organizations at Stanford has not
been raised. For the first time in
Stanford history, partisan groups
were allowed on campus last
spring. The regulations imposed
on them were so harsh as to dis
courage their activities, however.
No candidate for the ASSU presi
dency has offered to do anything
to liberalize both University and
ASSU policy toward such groups.
One of the oddest proposals in
this campaign is the election of
tliree of the six Stanford NSA
delegates. Why three? (A little
patronage for the other three?)
No candidate has raised the basic
issue of continued Stanford par
ticipation in NSA, and continued
expenditure of over $2,000 per
year to send the half-dozen chosen
few for a week's paid vacation.
Thus far, most of the "issues"
discussed by the candidates have
been bogus, created specifically
for the campaign. There has been
a general avoidance of what
might be termed important issues.
Very probably this is because
there are no important issues.
Indeed, Steve Gruber's state
ment last week is worth consider
ation: he said, in part, "If you
think I am going to run all over
campus holding inane little dis
cussions in living groups and
wasting my time and money on
posters, you are out of your cot
ton-picking minds."
Amen,

Battling down to the wire, the
candidates for ASSU president are
once again raising the political
temperature of Stanford to a
fever pitch.
The outcome of this vital elec
tion will affect the lives of 10,000
students and the issues being
earnestly debated can be ignored
only at our peril.
So we are told.
In truth, student government
at Stanford is largely irrelevant.
In probability, student govern
ment at any university is irrele
vant. Students at Columbia Uni
versity saw this several years ago
and abolished theirs. Stanford is
beginning to come around to
this point of view: a poll taken by
The Daily last year showed 22
per cent in favor of abolition.
But wo are probably stuck with
what we have got and we must
make the best of it (or ignore it).
There is a considerable amount
of dissatisfaction with the candi
dates running because there is a
considerable amount of dissatis
faction with the issues on which
they are basing their efforts. "Dy
namism" in student government
interests very few of us.
Steve Gruber's suggestion that
LASSU be abolished is not en
tirely farcical. Last year's Daily
poll showed only 53 per cent felt
student government was "worth
while." On the question, "Do you
think the ASSU Legislature
serves a useful purpose?" 41 per
cent replied No. 37 per cent Yes.
