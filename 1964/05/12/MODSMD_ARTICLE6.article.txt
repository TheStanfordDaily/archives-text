# Journalists Charge Bias
## 
### JIM HORNE Managing Editor 
Four candidates for the editor
ship of the San Francisco State
College Gold en Gater have
charged that interviews conduct
ed of them by the Board of Pub
lications "inferred . . . that a
candidate was to be selected be
cause of his political views"
rather than his journalistic abil
ities.
IN A LETTER written to the
Board, the candidates claimed
that the Board members were
looking for an editor who would
be "expected to become a mouth
piece of a political pressure
group."
"It is a consensus that qualif
ications for the editorship, as im
plied by certain members of the
| board . . .are based on each can
; didate's view of campus student
| government." said the letter.
THE CHARGE came after the
: Board had deliberated eleven
hours last week before announc
ing that it could not make a deci
sion from among the four candi
dates.
The Board called another meet
ing for last Thursday, at which
tlie protest letter from the four
candidates was read.
The letter asked that the four
applications bo placed in abeyance
until "the Board resolves its prob
lems." Only then "will a com-
I potent journalist lie willing to
accept its vote of confidence."
BOARD MEMBERS were in
censed at the candidates' charges
and expressed "deep disappoint
ment" in their actions while ex
; tending the deadline for applica
tions until Thursday, May 11.
Assistant Dean of Students
Charles Earlendaugh said that
I the candidates were ridiculous "in
assuming that we would permit
someone to be chosen on the basis
of his political beliefs. 1 could
i neither do that nor stand by and

see it be done," said Earlendaugh.
Board member Bob Rinaldo be
lieved that misunderstanding may
have resulted from questions
which were intended to insure
that the editor "have a broader
background than just journalistic
experience."
JIM NIXON, another Board
member, claimed that the length
of the meeting (from 3 p.m. Tues
day afternoon to 2 a.m. Wednes
day morning) caused the four
candidates, who were waiting out
side the room in anticipation of
an announcement, to "react emo
tionally," and to "make intempor
ate and ill-considered charges."
Earlendaugh concurred with
Nixon, stating that "it was tough
to avoid misunderstanding under
the circumstances."
The four candidates have since
indicated that they will reapply

for the editorship before Thurs
day's deadline. The Publications
Board, consisting of seven stu
dents, two faculty members, and
two representatives of the admin
istration, will meet again next
Tuesday to reconsider applica
tions from the original four can
didates and any others who have
expressed an interest in the posi
tion.
LOU SALGADO, the present
managing editor and a candidate
for editorship, does not believe
that any other students will apply
for the post before Thursday.
"It appears," said Salgado,
"that Edward Brazil (the Gater
City Editor), Geoffrey Link (a
Gater night editor), and Brian
Farley (a staff reporter), and I
will remain the only candidates
from which the Board can
choose."
