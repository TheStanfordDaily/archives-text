## 'Judge Read The Funnies' 
### 
Lawyer Melvin Belli, widely j
known for his defense of J a e k I
Ruby, spoke yesterday on the
Ruby trial and Ihe city of Dallas, j
and the flamboyant, colorful per
sonality that has neeome his
trademark was evident through-1
out his speech.
Speaking before an almost ca
pacity audience in Memorial Audi
torium, Belli quickly abandoned
both podium and microphone to
deliver his speech in a courtroom
style, walking and gesturing as
he spoke.
BKLIJ'S KPKKCII mixed both
humor and seriousness. Although
he spoke seriously about the prob
lems he faced during the trial
and about the underlying prob
lems he found in Dallas, he inter
jected many amusing stories
about his experiences which kept
the audience laughing much of
the time.
"I'm not making a ny money
speaking here," he said, "so let's
have a little fun."
"I can make the definite prog
nosis that Jack Ruby will not be
executed," Belli said. Medical evid
ence. according to Belli proves be
yond a doubt that Ruby has or
ganic brain damage and was not
responsible for his actions when
he fatally shot Lee Harvey Os
wald.
RUBY'S SANITY was the point
around which Belli's defense was
centered. "But while I was show
ing to tlie jury graphs which
proved conclusively that Jack
Ruby's mind was abnormal . . .
his honor was reading a funny
book."
According to Belli, he was
forced to present the most im
portant part of his defense late
at night, when jurors were
sleepy and yawning.
Till) JURY'S mind was diverted
from his defense. Belli charged,
by Judge Brown and others in Ihe
court who lit cigars, spit into spit
oons and reading funny books
while important points were being
made.
"Don't get me wrong," Belli
said, "I think Brown is a good
guy. and he doesn't profess to
know anything about law any
way."
His voice rising and falling I
rlramalically. Belli accused the
Dallas Morning News of "doing
moiv to ferment the feeling of
hale in Dallas than any other
cause" and expressed the belief
that last November's tragedy
noukl have happened only in Dal
las, "a city of hate and shame." ,

Lawyer Melvin Belli, widely j
known for his defense of J a e k I
Ruby, spoke yesterday on the
Ruby trial and Ihe city of Dallas, j
and the flamboyant, colorful per
sonality that has neeome his
trademark was evident through-1
out his speech.
Speaking before an almost ca
pacity audience in Memorial Audi
torium, Belli quickly abandoned
both podium and microphone to
deliver his speech in a courtroom
style, walking and gesturing as
he spoke.
BKLIJ'S KPKKCII mixed both
humor and seriousness. Although
he spoke seriously about the prob
lems he faced during the trial
and about the underlying prob
lems he found in Dallas, he inter
jected many amusing stories
about his experiences which kept
the audience laughing much of
the time.
"I'm not making a ny money
speaking here," he said, "so let's
have a little fun."
"I can make the definite prog
nosis that Jack Ruby will not be
executed," Belli said. Medical evid
ence. according to Belli proves be
yond a doubt that Ruby has or
ganic brain damage and was not
responsible for his actions when
he fatally shot Lee Harvey Os
wald.
