here Cranston received his B.A.
from Stanford in 1936. Three
years later, his anti-Nazi version
of Hitler's Mein Kumpf sold 500,-
000 copies in the United States,
before Hitler's agents halted pub
lication with an injunction claim
ing infringement of Hitler's copy
right.
Cranston is also the author of
The Killing of the Peace, a major
work on the failure of the League
of Nations. The book, published
in 1945, was chosen by the New
York Times as one of the ten best
books of the year.
The Stanford graduate served
as president of the Northern Cali
fornia chapter of the United World
Federalists and, in 1949, was un
animously elected national presi
dent of that organization.
Cranston was a leading figure
in the formation of the California
Democratic Council in 1953. The
CDC founding convention chose
him by unanimous vote as its
first president. He served in that
capacity for five years, until his
election in 1958 as State Control
ler the first Democrat to win
that post in seventy-two years.
In 1902, Cranston was re-elected
Controller, receiving the largest
vote and largest majority ever
given a candidate in a contested
state-wide race anywhere.
The candidate is presently run
ning against Pierre Salinger and
six minor contenders for the
Democratic Senatorial nomination
in the June 2 primary. The winner
of that contest will face the He
publican nominee in the Novem
ber general election. Republican
candidates are headed by Fred
Hall, Leland Kaiser, and George
Murphy.
Cranston will move on to the
Berkeley campus of the Univer
sity of California for u speech
Friday at Dwindle Plaza.
