# HOT LINE TO THE SIDELINE
## A 						Tale Of Two Ballplayers 
### TOM ELIAS 
This is a lale of two ballplayers. Only one played l'or Stanford. '
(but ho was just aboul the best the Farm has ever scon. The other I
played at the University of Utah and was just about the best that
j place over saw. Their names are Jack Shepard and Billy Cowan.
Jack Shepard, now Stanford's Director of Development, was a
| star catcher for the loams of Everett Dean from 1 Dfsl to 19.i3. Billy
Cowan was an All-Amoriean for throe years from 19fi9 to 1962 in
Salt Lake City.
Jack Shepard stepped right into a Pittsburgh Pirate uniform and
'singled to loft off Wilmer "Vinegar Bond" Mi/ell of the Cardinals in
his second major league trip to the plate.
Billy Cowan injured his arm in his last college year and wound
up getting a skimpy four thousand dollar bonus and a three-year j
minor league sentence. Ho finally made the big time this spring
'when tho Chicago Cubs installed him in Ihe ocnter field spot from j
I which ho has yet to be displaced.
The views those two men hold of college baseball are as far aparl I
; as the times at which thev played i — —

j their college ball.

Cowan, speaking in the visitors'
locker room at Candlestick Park
a week ago today, told mo ho
fools that, most of the real good
| college teams he saw wore barely
the equals of most Class C teams
in Organized Baseball. Just a
few, ho said, were as good as a
' mediocre Class B team.
The reasons ho pinpoints for
this poor quality are that very
few good college teams have con
sistently good pitching, oven as

consistently good as that in C
ball, and that every college team
he saw had at least one weakness,
something he could not say about
Class C teams.

Shepard never played an in
ning of minor league baseball.
Therefore, he maintains that col
lege ball in his day was nothing
to bo sneezed at. "We used to play
the old San Francisco Seals and
Oakland Oaks and even the Sacra
mento Solons as part of our regu
lar schedule. We didn't schedule
teams like Chico State."
Indeed, the baseball teams in
Jack Shepard's day played a nor
mal .">1 game schedule, as opposed
to the 11 games of today.
In addition to that, there were
the semi-pro leagues and inde
pendent: teams. Shepard played
three summers in leagues in Min
nesota, Idaho, and California with
players like Sam "Toothpick"
Jones. Paul Giel, Larry Jackson,
Gene Conley, and Andy Carey. All
these men and many more like
ihom played summers in those
leagues with Ihe result that the
gulf between college and semi-pro
ball to the pros was not terribly
wide.

This has changed today, Shep
ard says, because "the majors
can't afford to let a kid go to
college. After he's played there
for a. couple of seasons, everyone
knows about him and under the
present bonus rules, they become
too much of a draft risk."
The whole complexion of the
game seems to have changed since
Shepard played ball, yet. he con
tinually received offers to come
out of retirement until about
three years ago.
This is a rather short tale of
two ballplayers and study in the
contrasts that a decade in time can
bring in even the most stable of
sports, which baseball certainly
is.
