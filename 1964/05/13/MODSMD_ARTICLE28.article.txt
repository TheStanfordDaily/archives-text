## Worship On Wrong Side Of Quad 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
Remarkable tilings arc always
happening at LASSU meetings.
Just the other clay the President
of the IFC, Bill McGee, dropped
by to tell Ihe Legislature that it
had no business messing around
with matters that affect the fra
ternities. "Quite right," said the
Legislature.
"Let the Dean decide how rush
is to be formulated," said McGee.
"Let the Dean decide," answered
I lie Legislative chorus.
In this rousing spirit of good

feeling and ac
cord LASS U
killed the rush
committee pro
posal, and, in ef
fect, killed a ny
chance of s t u
dents determin
ing the manner

in which rush policies may be
formed.
It wasn't that tho committee
proposal before LASSU was so
bad. McGee admitted that any
suggestion that Iho IFC makes to
the Dean would he about the
same as the one that they wore
so unanimously opposing in the
Legislature. It's just that the IFC
would rather have the Dean de
fide except, on matters of the
most blatant trivia, of course, for
Deans are very busy people.

Tin: IFC DIDN'T even want
LASSU making any suggestions
to the Dean on rush. Apparently if
LASSU wants to make any sug
gestions to the Deans, it will have
to be to the Dean of Students, be
cause the fraternities seem to re
gard the Dean of Men as their ex
clusive property.
Another view of the matter was
taken by the eating clubs. When
tho initial proposal on a rush
committee was made, the ICC op
posed it unanimously.
But. unlike the fraternities,
1 hey made some proposals to the
Legislative committee working on
the proposal, and got, in return,
an amended proposal which they
considered satisfactory. The ICC
was not opposed to student gov
ernment making a decision on the
matter, but rather to its making
a wrong decision.
It's unfortunate that rush is
such an emotional issue, and that
fraternities cannot trust the rest
of the student body to discuss
I he matter. Three rush policies in
three years is a very tramatie ex
perience and. parts of the current
policy are quite expensive.
All that suffering has caused
the IFC to start imagining things.
They imagine that the committee
proposed by LASSU would fail to
agree with whatever the IFC pro
poses, ignoring the fact that the
committee members was weight
ed to give the IFC and ICC a 4-3
majority, and that there really
must, be something, wrong with a
proposal that the ICC, IHC, fresh
man, and freshman sponsors can't
accept. Very likely the Dean
couldn't accept it either.
But even if the fraternities feel
that there is a real problem, then
they should have proposed the
necessary amendments. If they
had the votes to defeat the pro
posal they had the votes to amend
it.
★ ★ ★
Tin; ACTION of the IFC in tak
ing rush out of the hands of stu
dent. government is doubly foolish
when one considers t ho power that
fraternities can have in the Legis
lature. The fraternities' 23 votes
are only one short of the combined
total of Wilbur, Stern, and the
eating clubs.
They don't have to be afraid of
student government, if only for
the simple reason that they can
run it if they chose, which I think
outweighs any influence that they
might have in the Dean's office. '
If the IFC has the votes to get
what it wants in the way of a
rush committee proposal out of
LASSU, it seems odd that it
should turn to the Dean hoping to
a better deal.
The IFC is apparently worship- i
ping on the wrong side of Inner j
Quad. Although the administra
tion must be pleased by the fra
ternities' attitude. University poli
cy restricts worship to Memorial
Church. The Deans' offices are,
clearly out. i

proposal before LASSU was so
bad. McGee admitted that any

the Dean would he about the

Tin: IFC DIDN'T even want
LASSU making any suggestions
to the Dean on rush. Apparently if
LASSU wants to make any sug
gestions to the Deans, it will have
to be to the Dean of Students, be
cause the fraternities seem to re
gard the Dean of Men as their ex
clusive property.
Another view of the matter was
taken by the eating clubs. When
tho initial proposal on a rush
committee was made, the ICC op
posed it unanimously.
But. unlike the fraternities,
1 hey made some proposals to the
Legislative committee working on
the proposal, and got, in return,
an amended proposal which they
considered satisfactory. The ICC
was not opposed to student gov
ernment making a decision on the
matter, but rather to its making
a wrong decision.
It's unfortunate that rush is
such an emotional issue, and that
fraternities cannot trust the rest
of the student body to discuss
I he matter. Three rush policies in
three years is a very tramatie ex
perience and. parts of the current
policy are quite expensive.
All that suffering has caused
the IFC to start imagining things.
They imagine that the committee
proposed by LASSU would fail to
agree with whatever the IFC pro
poses, ignoring the fact that the
committee members was weight
ed to give the IFC and ICC a 4-3
majority, and that there really
must, be something, wrong with a
proposal that the ICC, IHC, fresh
man, and freshman sponsors can't
accept. Very likely the Dean
couldn't accept it either.
But even if the fraternities feel
that there is a real problem, then
they should have proposed the
necessary amendments. If they
had the votes to defeat the pro
posal they had the votes to amend
it.

They don't have to be afraid of

the simple reason that they can
run it if they chose, which I think
outweighs any influence that they
