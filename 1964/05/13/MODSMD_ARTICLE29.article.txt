## ASSU Candidates Debate Issues Strengthen Judicial System 
### JOHN BRYSON 
THE QUESTION: What
is your position 011 Academic
Affairs, the Stanford Judi
cial System, ami tlx* Civil
Kit;lds Secretariat?

In two weeks of campaigning I have offered
a philosophy based on 1) thorough knowledge
of facts—of what the ASSU is and can do; 2)
awareness of the potential of student govern
ment to instigate change and to broaden its
scope of activity; 3» emphasis on the need to
more actively involve a large number of stu
dents in the various functions of the Associated
Students. This is my over-all attitude- an at
titude which I believe may be translated into
action in the following ways:
• ACADEMIC AFFAIRS: During the past
two years I've investigated experimental ideas
in education and general problems in the area
of academic affairs. Last quarter in working
with the Academic Affairs Committee, I laid
the necessary groundwork for establishing a
seminar under the ASSU which would spend a
year studying and evaluating the present under
graduate system at Stanford. Several members
of the faculty and administration have ex
pressed enthusiasm about the possibility of such
a seminar and have offered to occasionally sit
in with the students and present some of their
ideas.
The scope of such a seminar is almost un
limited. It could research and make recom
mendations on many aspects of the Stanford
undergraduate system, such as excessive grade
orientation, lack of close contact between facul
ty and students, the problem of no true "dead"
week, and the 17-unit science requirement.
• JUDICIAL SYSTEM: The Frank Morse
case brought 1o public attention the many con
fusions and ambiguities in the Stanford judicial
system. Dean Wert recently announced the ap
pointment of a committee of faculty and stu
dents to investigate the entire system.
With the aid of Darrell Halverson, head of
Men' Council, and Frank Morse, I investigated
the existing system and am recommending the
insertion of four specific and pragmatic state
ments into Article 1, Section 1 of the Constitu
tion to overcome weaknesses in the present
judicial system: 1) Guarantee of due process
of law through establishment of an explicitly
defined system of superordinate and subordinate
courts; 2) Guarantee of written notification of
reasons for and exact length of all suspensions;
3) Maintenance of standardized records of all
judicial proceedings; 4) Establishment of a
Court of Last Appeals, with student and faculty
representation.
• CIVIL RIGHTS SECRETARIAT: Such an
institute would not be empowered to take of
ficial stands for the university or even for any
large segment of the university. This institute
would thus be non-partisan and would not pro
mote any particular point of view. Rather it
would provide objective and complete informa
tion for students contemplating their own posi
tion on civil rights.
In direct contrast to such an institute is the
present Civil Liberties Caucus wheih is now
presenting its constitution to the Dean's Office
for approval. The Caucus is a voluntary or
ganization under the structure of the Political
Union. "It presents programs of a partisan
nature with a view toward changing opinions"
and "is interested in active promotion and direct
involvement ... in the various facets of the
civil rights movement."
I feel there is strong justification for having
two distinct and separate bodies—-one providing
objective information for students contemplat
ing their own position; the other promoting
direct action and advocating a partisan stand on
civil rights.

large segment of the university. This institute
would thus be non-partisan and would not pro
mote any particular point of view. Rather it
would provide objective and complete informa
tion for students contemplating their own posi
tion on civil rights.
In direct contrast to such an institute is the
present Civil Liberties Caucus wheih is now
presenting its constitution to the Dean's Office
for approval. The Caucus is a voluntary or
ganization under the structure of the Political
Union. "It presents programs of a partisan
nature with a view toward changing opinions"
and "is interested in active promotion and direct
involvement ... in the various facets of the
civil rights movement."
I feel there is strong justification for having
two distinct and separate bodies—-one providing
objective information for students contemplat
ing their own position; the other promoting
direct action and advocating a partisan stand on
civil rights.

THE QUESTION: What
is your position 011 Academic
Affairs, the Stanford Judi
cial System, ami tlx* Civil
Kit;lds Secretariat?

In two weeks of campaigning I have offered
a philosophy based on 1) thorough knowledge
of facts—of what the ASSU is and can do; 2)
awareness of the potential of student govern
ment to instigate change and to broaden its
scope of activity; 3» emphasis on the need to
more actively involve a large number of stu
dents in the various functions of the Associated
Students. This is my over-all attitude- an at
titude which I believe may be translated into
action in the following ways:
• ACADEMIC AFFAIRS: During the past
two years I've investigated experimental ideas
in education and general problems in the area
of academic affairs. Last quarter in working
with the Academic Affairs Committee, I laid
the necessary groundwork for establishing a
seminar under the ASSU which would spend a
year studying and evaluating the present under
graduate system at Stanford. Several members
of the faculty and administration have ex
pressed enthusiasm about the possibility of such
a seminar and have offered to occasionally sit
in with the students and present some of their
ideas.
The scope of such a seminar is almost un
limited. It could research and make recom
mendations on many aspects of the Stanford
undergraduate system, such as excessive grade
orientation, lack of close contact between facul
ty and students, the problem of no true "dead"
week, and the 17-unit science requirement.
• JUDICIAL SYSTEM: The Frank Morse
case brought 1o public attention the many con
fusions and ambiguities in the Stanford judicial
system. Dean Wert recently announced the ap
pointment of a committee of faculty and stu
dents to investigate the entire system.
With the aid of Darrell Halverson, head of
Men' Council, and Frank Morse, I investigated
the existing system and am recommending the
insertion of four specific and pragmatic state
ments into Article 1, Section 1 of the Constitu
tion to overcome weaknesses in the present
judicial system: 1) Guarantee of due process
of law through establishment of an explicitly
defined system of superordinate and subordinate
courts; 2) Guarantee of written notification of
reasons for and exact length of all suspensions;
3) Maintenance of standardized records of all
judicial proceedings; 4) Establishment of a
Court of Last Appeals, with student and faculty
representation.
• CIVIL RIGHTS SECRETARIAT: Such an
institute would not be empowered to take of
ficial stands for the university or even for any
large segment of the university. This institute
would thus be non-partisan and would not pro
mote any particular point of view. Rather it
would provide objective and complete informa
