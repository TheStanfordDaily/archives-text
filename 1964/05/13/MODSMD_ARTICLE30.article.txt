# Needed: Student Government Forum
## 
### SCOTT McBRIDE 
During the primary campaign I stressed
issues. In this article I wiLl reiterate my stand
on two of them, the Civil Rights Secretariat and
judicial procedure, but first 1 would like to
present some of my ideas on new programs in
the academic field.
1 propose a program of inter-departmental
majors such as sociology-psychology-political
science be offered to undergraduates who wish
lo specialize less and acquire a broader basic
education.
I suggest that freshmen be offered a number
of one or two units colloquia. These would
provide an opportunity for detailed study and
contact with distinguished faculty, both of
which are notably lacking in the freshman year.
I propose that the Eastern Civilization course
planned next year for sophomores and above
be opened to freshmen as an alternative for
those already qualified in Western Civ.
THKSK IDEAS are practical; they arc fea
sible. I have talked to professors and Deans
about each of them.
Ideas are important in any campaign, but
choices are more often made on the basis of
issues. The proper place of the Civil Rights
Secretariat is one of the primary issues of this
campaign. I have advocated the formation of a
voluntary group which could work in a partisan
manner to implement the goals of the civil
rights movement, and I am happy to read that
the Civil Liberties Caucus, defunct since
Autumn Quarter, is now being revitalized.
This however, was only half of my proposal.
1 also believe that as an impartial information
service the Civil Rights Secretariat belongs un
der the Political Union, just as the Overseas In
formation Service is under the ILR.
Another much talked about issue is how the
judicial procedure should be revised. I have
proposed, first of all, an investigation to be
undertaken by members of the administration,
including the Dean of Students, and representa
tives from the judicial councils.
A proposal that I would like lo have consid
ered in such an investigation is a final court of
appeals. It would be composed of deans and
faculty as voting members and judicial council
representatives as advisors. This court, in place
of the Dean of Students, would make the final
decision in the judicial process.
I PROPOSE representatives from the judicial
council so that the council's view can be more
completely presented and minority opinions ex
pressed. The representatives would serve only
in an advisory capacity since they could not re
view their own previous decision. The final
court of appeals would correct poor communica
tion. preclude a potentially arbitrary review by
the Dean of Students, and still leave the final
decision with the administration and the faculty.
Finally, I would like to present some of my
ideas for new programs in student government.
Among them is a regularly scheduled open
forum in which student officers would discuss
current problems with members of the admin
istration. All interested students would be in
vited to attend and an agenda would be pub
lished ahead of time in the Daily.
I also believe that student officers, in the in
terest of more contact with students, should
dine frequently in the various living groups,
and that the ASSU organize informal meetings
between university officials and interested
groups.

completely presented and minority opinions ex
pressed. The representatives would serve only
in an advisory capacity since they could not re
view their own previous decision. The final
court of appeals would correct poor communica
tion. preclude a potentially arbitrary review by
the Dean of Students, and still leave the final
decision with the administration and the faculty.
Finally, I would like to present some of my
ideas for new programs in student government.
Among them is a regularly scheduled open
forum in which student officers would discuss
current problems with members of the admin
istration. All interested students would be in
vited to attend and an agenda would be pub
lished ahead of time in the Daily.
I also believe that student officers, in the in
terest of more contact with students, should
dine frequently in the various living groups,
and that the ASSU organize informal meetings
between university officials and interested
groups.

During the primary campaign I stressed
issues. In this article I wiLl reiterate my stand
on two of them, the Civil Rights Secretariat and
judicial procedure, but first 1 would like to
present some of my ideas on new programs in
the academic field.
1 propose a program of inter-departmental
majors such as sociology-psychology-political
science be offered to undergraduates who wish
lo specialize less and acquire a broader basic
education.
I suggest that freshmen be offered a number
of one or two units colloquia. These would
provide an opportunity for detailed study and
contact with distinguished faculty, both of
which are notably lacking in the freshman year.
I propose that the Eastern Civilization course
planned next year for sophomores and above
be opened to freshmen as an alternative for
those already qualified in Western Civ.
THKSK IDEAS are practical; they arc fea
sible. I have talked to professors and Deans
about each of them.
Ideas are important in any campaign, but
choices are more often made on the basis of
issues. The proper place of the Civil Rights
Secretariat is one of the primary issues of this
campaign. I have advocated the formation of a
voluntary group which could work in a partisan
manner to implement the goals of the civil
rights movement, and I am happy to read that
the Civil Liberties Caucus, defunct since
Autumn Quarter, is now being revitalized.
This however, was only half of my proposal.
1 also believe that as an impartial information
service the Civil Rights Secretariat belongs un
der the Political Union, just as the Overseas In
formation Service is under the ILR.
Another much talked about issue is how the
judicial procedure should be revised. I have
proposed, first of all, an investigation to be
undertaken by members of the administration,
including the Dean of Students, and representa
tives from the judicial councils.
A proposal that I would like lo have consid
ered in such an investigation is a final court of
appeals. It would be composed of deans and
faculty as voting members and judicial council
representatives as advisors. This court, in place
of the Dean of Students, would make the final
decision in the judicial process.
I PROPOSE representatives from the judicial
council so that the council's view can be more
completely presented and minority opinions ex
pressed. The representatives would serve only
in an advisory capacity since they could not re
view their own previous decision. The final
court of appeals would correct poor communica
tion. preclude a potentially arbitrary review by
