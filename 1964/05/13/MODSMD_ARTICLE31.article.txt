# Bryson: IFC, IHC, ICC Should Handle Rush
## The 						Mailbox 
### 
Editor, Tlii' Daily:
I'm very disturbed by the Daily's
coverage of last night's (Mon
day's) debate. Tuesday's article
completely misrepresented my
position on rush. Scott and I were
questioned about I lie existing con
stitutional policy on rushing regu
lations. I pointed out that at
present, according to (lie Con
stitution. LASSU must give the
final affirmation to any rushing
regulation for any living group.
At no time did I indicate that 1
approved of this policy—exactly
the opposite.
Throughout this campaign T
have maintained that rush policy
should NOT bo handled in the
Legislature, but rather by the
IFC. IHC. and ICC.
I consider this to be a matter of
the greatest importance because
it directly affects all the male
students on the Stanford campus.
I am concerned that my position
on rush policy be made absolutely
clear.

Socialist Judy Walborn flaunts
a scorn for individual rights that
is characteristic of the totali
tarianism she seeks to establish.
She has asked. "Why do the
Civil Rights leaders have to use
such extreme measures?" and
yet has concluded that the initia
tion of the use of physical force
In blockade private concerns is

just; It because it focuses World
attention on the civil rights
1 struggle; 2) because it is often
I the "only" tactic which can be
'used; 3) because it leads to the
eradication of certain inequalities.
I answer: 11 world attention
; does not exist, any attempt to in
j fluence a nonentity is ridiculous;
2> vandalism, as employed in
j "shop-in's," is never justified, be
cause it violates the individual
property right; 3) the only in
equalities which the government
can rightfully redress are legal in
equalities.
Government is a product of a
social code: to know the function
of government, one must under
stand the power of society. The
crucial questions is' Is the power
of society limited or unlimited?
Individualism answers: The power
of society is limited by the in
alienable, individual rights of
man. Society may make only such
laws as do not violate these
rights. Collectivism answers: The
power of society is unlimited. So
j ciety m a y make any laws it
I wishes, and force them upon any
| one in any manner it wishes.

As Professor .Midland's faculty

applaud his defense of Professor

Frulla. I wish to join him, too, in
his protest against inaccurate re- j
porting by local news media.
Infantilism on the part of some j
s t ude nt s has given Professor j
Frulla severe provocation. There
are instances in which he has
made gentle allowances and done
nothing; others in which he has
remarked on the difference be
tween mature and immature j
members of his groups. There has
been punishment, but it has been !
more moderate in the cases that I
have known than standards of j
civilized behavior would require,

I'm very disturbed by the Daily's
coverage of last night's (Mon
day's) debate. Tuesday's article
completely misrepresented my
position on rush. Scott and I were
questioned about I lie existing con
stitutional policy on rushing regu
lations. I pointed out that at
present, according to (lie Con
stitution. LASSU must give the
final affirmation to any rushing
regulation for any living group.
At no time did I indicate that 1
approved of this policy—exactly
the opposite.
Throughout this campaign T
have maintained that rush policy
should NOT bo handled in the
Legislature, but rather by the
IFC. IHC. and ICC.
I consider this to be a matter of
the greatest importance because
it directly affects all the male
students on the Stanford campus.
I am concerned that my position
on rush policy be made absolutely
clear.
