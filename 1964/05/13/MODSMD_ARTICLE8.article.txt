count yesterday which reversed

didate Henry Billingsley and gave !

THK INITIAL tabluation of the
primary balloting last Thursday I
evening gave Billingsley a one :
vote edge over MacKenzie, thus I
seemingly assuring his place on
the final ballot along with the)
primary leader, Craig Croekwell. 1

j) r i ma r y winner was withcld
pending receipt of anticipated bal
lots from Stanford-in-France and
yesterday's re c o unt; however,
MacKenzie, believing himself to
have been defeated, virtually dis
mantled his campaign effort.
When the expected vote from j
Stanford-in-France did not ma-

terializc, the election results were
finalized, pending a prefuncfory
re-tabulation of the votes.
THEN, YESTERDAY after
noon, during the final re-check,
the Elections Commission, headed
by Skip Martin, discovered a dis-1
erepancy in the totals. Apparent

totals of Gary Lepper. another J

and Mackenzie's name was placed
on today's final ballot.

re-tabulation of the votes.
THEN, YESTERDAY after
noon, during the final re-check,
the Elections Commission, headed
by Skip Martin, discovered a dis-1
erepancy in the totals. Apparent
ly, during the rush of the tabula
tion last Thursday evening, four
votes for Billingsley had been
added into the totals twice.
In addition, it was discovered
that one vote intended for Mac
kenzie had boon added into the
totals of Gary Lepper. another J
primary candidate.
The original totals put Billings
ley aheaci 184 to 18-1. After the
recount, however, the totals read
Billingsley ISO, MacKenzie 181,
and Mackenzie's name was placed
on today's final ballot.
