THIS MAN ADAM
There are two widely differing views about the origin of man. Even those
who firmly hold to the theory that man evolved from simple life forms usually
agree that the Genesis account contains valuable symbolic meaning. Individ
uals who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ have been led by God the
Holy Spirit into an understanding of Genesis which views Adam as one specific
man created with great intelligence and wisdom. In his state of near perfec
tion before the fall, Adam was a magnificent man, by no means a primitive
creature newly emerged from animal predecessors. Those who accept Genesis
by faith are immediately led by God into a broader view of reality and are
given a majestic picture of the un : verse which the unregenerated man, regard
less of his knowledge and wisdom, does not have. Here as elsewhere faith
is the prerequisite to understanding the things of God, and those who seek
God are always rewarded:
But without faith it is impossible to please Him; for he that cometh to
God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarded of them that dili
gently seek Him." (Hebrew 1 1.-6)
Men today like to believe that they are evolving upward on a scale
from sub-human ancestors, to primitive tribesman, to modern-day intellectual
man. However, the Word of God shows that man has fallen from the daz
! zlinq heights of the created beginning to the depths of depravity.
Because there are so few churches today who are faithful to the Word
of God, one seldom hears a good exposition on Genesis and the fall (fortu
nately God's truths are available to all who sincerely desire to be taught by
the Holy Spirits).
Yet the Book of Beginnings contains the deepestt truths concerning man
and his moral and spiritual plight today.
To understand the magnitude of the great redemptive work of Jesus
Christ, God, the Eternal Son, the Genesis account must be given reverant
attention:
"... but we also rejoice and exultingly glory in God through our
Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom we have now received and enjoy recon
ciliation. Therefore as sin came into ihe world through one man and death
as a result of sin, so death spread to all men, (no one being able to stop
if or escape its power) because all men sinned. (To be sure), sin was in
the world before the law was given, but sin is not charged to men's account
where there is no law (no transgress). Yet death held sway from Adam to
Moses, even over those who did not themselves transgress (a positive com
mand) as Adam did. Adam was a type (prefigure) of the One Who to come,
(in reverse, the former destructive, the Latter saving). But God's free gift
is not at all to be compared to the trespass—His grace is out of all propor
tion to the fall of man. For if many died through one man's falling away—
his lapse, his offense—much more profusely did God's grace and the free
gift (that comes) through the undeserved favor of the one man Jesus Christ,
abound and overfloow to and for the benefit of many.'* (Romans 5:11-15
Ampl. NT)
Death, the penalty imposed by God for disobedience to Him, entered the
world with Adam. Men were not created to die, but to live in everlasting
fellowship with God. It was Satan who led Eve to doubt what God had
said, and finally to fall, committing the sin which God had declared would
result in death:
"Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the
Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,
ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the
serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, God hath said,
Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent
said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the
days ye ea thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods,
knowing good and evil. "And when the woman saw that the tree was good
for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
mcike one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and did eat, and gave also unto
her husband and he did eat.' (Genesis 3:1 -6)
The New Testment (which invariably reaffirms all of the Old Testa
ment) tells us that Eve was deceived by Satan, but Adam was not:
"For Adams was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but
the woman being deceived was in the transgression." (I Timothy 2:13, 14)
Adam, because of his love for Eve (seeing that she had sinned and fallen
and would die) consciously chose to be with his wife and took also of the
forbidden fruit. Thus was the whole human race plunged into sorrow and sin.
Adam is called in the Bible a type of Christ. ' As Adam gave himself in
love for his wife knowing that death would result, so Jesus Christ the sin
less Son of God, gave Himself for his church, his purchased people bought
with His own blood:
"Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to min
ister, and to give life a ransom for many." (Matthew 20:288)
If you have doubts about Adam, begin with lesus Christ. If you haven't
met Jesus Christ you havent's lived:
"And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this
life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the
Son hath not life (I John 6:11, 1?)
