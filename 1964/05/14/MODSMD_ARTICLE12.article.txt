# Elections Turnout Declines
## 1800 Votes Cast In ASSU Race 
### JUSTICE BECK Political Editor 
Turnout for the first day of
the ASSU final election was es
timated at around 1800 by Elec
tion Commission Chairman Skip
Martin.
This would make yesterday's
voting slightly lighter than in
last week's primary, when an es
timated 2000 students voted. The
heaviest vote ever recorded in a
final election at Stanford was
two years ago when 3601 votes
were cast.
A TOTAL of 3338 votes were
cast in the primary election last
week. The vote is expected to be
somewhat smaller in the final
election.
ALSO TO BE decided in the
election is Senior Class Presi
dent. Craig Crockwell and Sandy
MacKonzie are the two candi
dates for that office, following an
extremely close primary.
Bill Moore, editor of the Daily,
yesterday denied rumors that
copies of the Daily were .stolen
to prevent their delivery yester
day. "Our shop foreman was
sick Tuesday, and, as a result,
we had a much later press run.
Many papers could not be distri
buted," he said.
Today is the final day for vot
ing. Four polls will be open, at
Engineering Corner from 7:45
a.m. to 5 p.m.; at the Post Office
from 8:45 a.m. to 3:15 p.m.; at
Tresidder Union from 11:30 a.m.
| to 1:30 p.m. and at the Physics
I Tank from 8:45 to 12 noon.
