# Tobacco Sales Survive Surgeon General's Report
## 
### BILL WERTZ 
Tobacco, "the sovereign
remedy to all diseases," still
holds its sway oil the Stan
lord campus, hut only af
ter a rigorous battle.
After five months, Stan
ford students have shrug
ged off the grim warnings
of the Surgeon General's
report on smoking, and a
tidal tobaeoo sales on cam
pus are climbing back to
normal after a long battle.
Cigarette sales plummeted
in the first few weeks after
the Surgeon General's of
fice released its now fam
ous report linking heavy
smoking with lung cancer.
According to manager
Miss Frances Silva, cigar
ette sales in the Tresidder
Union Store showed a "very
definite decline" during this
period. Sales from cigarette
vending machines placed in
campus living units reflect
ed a similar decline.
Not surprisingly, sales of
cigars all <1 pipes, which
were not linked as closely
to lung cancer as cigarettes,
shot up almost as fast as
cigarette sales de <• 1 in ed.
"Many students switched to
pipes and those little cig
ars," said Miss Silva.
Even girls 111 a<l e the
switch. Girls would pick up
boxes of cigars or a pipe
rather sheepishly, Miss Sil
va said. Embarrassed to IK'
seen purchasing such mas-

culine items, they would
hlushingly m 11111 bI e that
they were buying the cigars
as a gift or for a friend.
This unusual reversal in
the sales of cigarettes, cig
ars and pipes lasted for only
a short while. According to
Miss .Silva, cigarette sales
at Tresidder are almost
back to normal. "I'd say it's
back to about SO per cent
now."
Student reaction to th e

Surgeon General's report
shows clearly the reasons
for the sudden drop and
slow revival of cigarette
sales. "1 quit for three
months," one .junior said,
"but then 1 couldn't take it
and 1 had to start again."
This reaction was typical
of many students who tried
to stop or cut down on their
smoking and then gave up
the attempt. The reasons
given for this ranged from

the usual "I was getting
nervous," or "I was gaining'
weight," lo "1 was blaming:
my lark of concentration on
the tact that I had slopped
smoking. I started again s<>
that i wouldn't have that
excuse not to study."
.Many smokers 112 rankly ad
mit that they lack the ne
cessary will power to stop
smoking. They can. perhaps,
take comfort from an old
poem from I'enn. State
Froth:
Tobacco is a dirty weed —I
like it.
It satisfies no normal need
—I like it.
It makes you thin, it makes
you lean,
It takes the hair right off
your bean.
It's the worst darn stuff I've
ever seen —I liki* it.
Some smokers who like it
have stopped. Others who
haven't are trying: to. But
the main effect of the Sur
geon General's report, at
least on the Stanford cam
pus, seems to have been on
the non-smokers, who use
it to buttress t heir case for
not smoking". One sopho
more said: "I'm ever glad
der that I don't smoke, now
that I know it's really harm
ful."
The scare is over now;
rising: cigarette sales indi
cate that hazy, smoke filled
rooms, cigarette burns on
tables, and dirty ash trays
are signs of the future.

Tobacco, "the sovereign
remedy to all diseases," still
holds its sway oil the Stan
lord campus, hut only af
ter a rigorous battle.
After five months, Stan
ford students have shrug
ged off the grim warnings
of the Surgeon General's
report on smoking, and a
tidal tobaeoo sales on cam
pus are climbing back to
normal after a long battle.
Cigarette sales plummeted
in the first few weeks after
the Surgeon General's of
fice released its now fam
ous report linking heavy
smoking with lung cancer.
According to manager
Miss Frances Silva, cigar
ette sales in the Tresidder
Union Store showed a "very
definite decline" during this
period. Sales from cigarette
vending machines placed in
campus living units reflect
ed a similar decline.
Not surprisingly, sales of
cigars all <1 pipes, which
were not linked as closely
to lung cancer as cigarettes,
shot up almost as fast as
cigarette sales de <• 1 in ed.
"Many students switched to
pipes and those little cig
ars," said Miss Silva.
Even girls 111 a<l e the
switch. Girls would pick up
boxes of cigars or a pipe
rather sheepishly, Miss Sil
va said. Embarrassed to IK'
seen purchasing such mas-

culine items, they would
hlushingly m 11111 bI e that
they were buying the cigars
as a gift or for a friend.
This unusual reversal in
the sales of cigarettes, cig
ars and pipes lasted for only
a short while. According to
Miss .Silva, cigarette sales
at Tresidder are almost
back to normal. "I'd say it's
back to about SO per cent
now."
Student reaction to th e

Surgeon General's report
shows clearly the reasons
for the sudden drop and
slow revival of cigarette
sales. "1 quit for three
months," one .junior said,
"but then 1 couldn't take it
and 1 had to start again."
