## Initiative Legalizes Discrimination 
### 
Editor, Tlx' Daily:
Mr. Chase's article of May 7
blatantly distorts many facts in
his support of the CREA Initia
tive. The Rumford Act grants no
special rights to anyone, but
makes it illegal to use race, reli
gion or ancestry as a criterion for
the selling or renting of real
property. Other criteria may still
be considered by the owner in his
dealings with a prospective client.
The Rumford Act: merely pro
hibits discrimination on the basis
of race, and thereby creates a
situation which is conducive to
the furtherance of equality in
many other areas. Admittedly
moral codes cannot be legislated,
but .just as laws against rape and
child-beating create a social con
text that reduces these acts, so
do the Rumford Act and other
antidiscrimination laws create a
context to reduce racial inequal
ity.
It is foolish to assert that con
stitutions "deny to government
all authority to interfere or
abridge the rights and freedom
of the people." If this were the
case, we would have? no traffic
laws, no zoning laws, no schools
(paid for by taxes); we would
have anarchy.
Government is based on the
controlled limitation of individual
action for the benefit of the gov
erned, and as such has the right
to limit certain actions when
necessary in the public interest.
Discrimination in housing is a
great wrong to a large segment
of our population, and therefore
may legally be controlled by the
legislative processes of govern
ment. This is the same process
that prohibits the construction of
factories in a residential zone.
The Rumford act does not force
you to sell to anyone because he
is a Negro or a Jew. The Initia
tive violates the principle of
equality under the law by legaliz
ing racial discrimination based on
personal prejudice, and prevents
any branch of state or local gov
ernment to limit such discrimi
nation. RANDY IRK SOX
• Plagiarism
Editor, The Daily:
The time has come for us at
Stanford to appraise the Hon or
Code, for it seems to have be
come largely disregarded. A 11
through Freshman English we
are drilled with the dogma that
plagiarism, in addition to being
against the law. is a Stanford
Honor Code violation, punishable
by suspension from our Great
Western University; however,
when specific abuses occur, both
the administration and the stu
dent body calmly ignore the vio
lations.
For example: an "A" paper
cannot be left in a teacher's box
in the English Department with
out being stolen almost immedi
ately. Disregarding the fact that
stealing is also given lip service
in the Fun Stan, such a theft by
a culprit who will turn in the
paper as his own the next time
the course is offered is the most
flagrant type of plagiarism. I
know many people who have lost
valuable papers in this way; last
week a paper of mine had van
ished less than two hours after
it had been placed in the teacher's
box.
For example: the feature sports
article in Monday's Daily was an
obvious paraphrase of the report
which had appeared in The
Chronicle Sunday, including even
the misquote attributed to me.
Writing of this sort, besides
showing remarkable laziness on
the part of a reporter who does
not bother to go directly to the
people involved, but merely re
words someone else's account, is
also plagiarism.
May I suggest that if this
Great Western University wishes
to boast about its Honor Code, il
is about time that we recognize
obvious violations for what they
are and deal with them accord
ingly. or else the Honor Code is
a hypocritical misrepresentation
of what Stanford really is.

• iMcßride.s Proposal
Editor, The Daily:
Scott Mcßride, in yesterday's
Daily statement, offered some
fascinating and beguiling pro
posals. For example, he has ad
vocated a public forum in which
students and administrators
would come together to discuss
"current problems." Everyone
(students, that is), would be most
enthusiastic about such a pro
gram, and in certain fields it is
already being done.
Administration officials are
happy to discuss general policy
if there is no specific case in
question. But when a controver
sial issue has created a public stir,
the administration is inclined to
regard open discussion itself as
a concession as the Frank
Aloise case and last Spi ing's fall

out shelter debate have demon
strated. Candidates should be
ware of promising more than
they can possibly deliver within
their framework of power and in
fluence.
We pass over Mr. Mcßride's
recommendation of interdepart
mental majors; such a proposal
ignores the freedom which al
ready exists within the majors
system and the interdepartmental
honors programs.
The third proposal was that the
Eastern Civilization course be
opened to freshmen who might
pass out of Western Civ. A rec
ommendation of this nature in
volves too many changes in the
existing system to carry much
weight unless it is part of a com
prehensive survey of the whole
undergraduate program.
The formal seminars next year
(obtained by the efforts of Mr.
Bryson), which will publish the
results of their findings on the
undergraduate situation, are the
appropriate channel for such sug
gestions. Now that we have such
a study group, it seems inappro
priate for any candidate to base
his appeal on a proposal which he
can do Jit tie to implement.
Mr. Mcßride has centered hi s
campaign around the Civil Rights
Secretariat, a strange and totally
trivial issue, involving only a
bureaucratic matter. It is a false
issue, unworthy of a major can
didate. One might ask, if Mr.
Mcßride feels so strongly about
the issue, why he did not make
some noise when the Secretariat
was formed. He was, after all,
the President of Political Union.

• Rush By l)r aw
Editor, The Daily:
After a cursory reading of the
philosophy behind the new hous
ing system proposed by masters
Schatz, Jacobi, and Sorenson. I
was struck by a glaring incon
sistency of ideals. Master Schatz
decries the "fact" that rush ". . .
denies freshmen full choice where
they will live," and then shortly
thereafter asserts that "the uni
versity has a duty to impose a
beneficial diversity in the living
groups."
Untutored though I am in the
nuances of Philosophy 3. even
my unenlightened mind perceives
a certain logical dichotomy in the
concepts of freedom and compul
sion. Is it possible that Master
Schatz suggests that the univer
sity coerce me to live with him
if I choose not to? This seems to
me an unjust assertion of his will
over mine, certainly not in the
spirit of "freedom of choice."
Need I remind Master Schatz
that if he truly fears "'. . . mir

ror images of himself,'" and
pines for the halcyon days of life
in diversified Wilbur Hall, there
are alternatives to the fraternity
club system — university resi
dence being the frequently men
tioned? Certainly this latter insti
tution offers him the Russian
roulette thrill of a draw system.
Although I feel it best to leave
to a more convincing advocate of
fraternities and eating clubs the
defense of the system as a whole,
I feel compelled to remind these
dissident young men that rush is
not solely a choice of new men
by the houses and clubs; it in
volves choice and value judgment
on the part of the freshmen as
well.
No such system can survive un
less il offers a philosophy an d
way of life attrative to the large
majority of its freshman judges.
As I contemplate this point my
self, a vague suspicion arises sur
reptitiously in my mind that the
fear that plagues these three dis
senters most is that everyone
might not share in the monto
nous mirror image one finds in
their planned diversity.

• Tact, Intelligence
Editor, The Daily:
Like Kuhn, Smith, and Prof.
Juilland. I am disturbed by the
reported tendency of students to
blame Prof. Frulla for what hap
pened to Frank Morse. An im
pression has been created that
dire things might happen to one
at the villa because Prof. Frulla
is "emotional." With this impres
sion goes the idea that life at the
villa is a series of disciplinary in
fractions punctuated by occa
sional suspensions.
If the decision in Frank
Morse's case was a mistake,
blame should be placed, not on
any single person, but on the ab
sence of judicial process at Stan
ford. Villa San Paolo is run w i th
great tact and intelligence by two
exceptional administrators. Guel
fo Frulla is an unusually warm,
imaginative man. His warmth is
communicated to students in
many personal contacts; his im
agination shows in the many crea
tive ideas he has had for im
proving the intellectual life of the
villa.
And he executes with particular
subtlety one of his more vital
functions, which is to train the
faculty that arrives every six
months from Stanford to become
useful and involved participants
in villa life. If one wants to re
duce the villa to a single impres
sion, it must be that the intellec
tual opportunities of Florence
and the experience in the group
itself are so valuable that any
student who wants something out
of Stanford should get to Stan
ford-in-Italv as soon as possible.
