## They Don't Want Whites Dictating What To Want

The United States inherited the
Vietnamese struggle from the
French in 1956. Since that time,
the nature and results of the
fighting has duplicated that of
the French. Like the French, we
are no closer to defeating the
Communists.
In the foreword of The (Juiet
American, by Graham Greene,
run the words, "Many Americans
will not agree with this book
but all of us ought to read it
because it is what a very large
part of the world really thinks
of us."
The story contrasts the repre
sentatives of two counries. One,
Fowler, is a cynical foreign cor
respondent who sends home to
England what th e democrats
want to hear, and what is not cen
sored by the French. The other.
Pyle, is an American diplomat,
recently weaned from Harvard,
who comes to Vietnam on a
secret mission for our State De
part ment.
FOVVI JO It'S experience clashes
with Pylc's altruism. Pyle con
tinually babbles about the wis
dom of his favorite political au
thor. t lie mythical York Harding,
and Fowler counters Pylc's book
gathered wisdom with the reali
ties of war. In a dialogue which
takes place in a small hut, forti
fied by a terrified pair of South
Vietnamese peasants and at
tacked by the Victcong, Pyle and
Fowler are stranded:
(Fowler) ". Sometimes the
Viels have a better success with
a megaphone than a bazooka. I
don't blame them. They don't

believe in anything either. You
and your like are trying to make
a war with the help of people
who just aren't interested.'"
(Pyle) " 'They don't want Com
munism.' "
"They want enough rice,' I
said. They don't want to be shot
at. They want one day to be much
the same as another. They don't
want our white skins around tell
ing them what they want.' "
" 'If Indochina goes '
"I know that record. Siam goes.
Malaya goes. Indonesia goes.
What does 'go' mean? If 1 be
lieved in your God and another
life, I'd bet my future harp
against your golden crown that
in five hundred years there may
be no New York or London, but
they'll be growing paddy in these
fields, they'll be carrying their
produce to market on long poles,
wearing their pointed hats. The
small boys will be sitting on the
buffalos. I like the bufl'alos,
they don't like our smell, the
smell of Europeans. And remem
ber — from a buffalo's point of
view you are a European too.'"
" 'They'll be forced to believe
what they are told; they won't
be allowed to think for them
selves.' "
" 'Thought's a luxury. Do you
think the peasant sits and thinks
of God and democracy when he
gets inside his mud hut at
night?'"
Perhaps Graham Green's work
is only fiction, and perhaps Pyle,
Ihe naive American, is an un
justly inflated straw man, yet
the impact of Graham Greene's
message is still vitally relevant.

Perhaps Graham Green's work
is only fiction, and perhaps Pyle,
Ihe naive American, is an un
justly inflated straw man, yet
the impact of Graham Greene's
message is still vitally relevant.

The United States inherited the
Vietnamese struggle from the
French in 1956. Since that time,
the nature and results of the
fighting has duplicated that of
the French. Like the French, we
are no closer to defeating the
Communists.
In the foreword of The (Juiet
American, by Graham Greene,
run the words, "Many Americans
will not agree with this book
but all of us ought to read it
because it is what a very large
part of the world really thinks
of us."
The story contrasts the repre
sentatives of two counries. One,
Fowler, is a cynical foreign cor
respondent who sends home to
England what th e democrats
want to hear, and what is not cen
sored by the French. The other.
Pyle, is an American diplomat,
recently weaned from Harvard,
who comes to Vietnam on a
secret mission for our State De

with Pylc's altruism. Pyle con
tinually babbles about the wis

gathered wisdom with the reali
ties of war. In a dialogue which
takes place in a small hut, forti
fied by a terrified pair of South
Vietnamese peasants and at
tacked by the Victcong, Pyle and
Fowler are stranded:
(Fowler) ". Sometimes the
Viels have a better success with
a megaphone than a bazooka. I
don't blame them. They don't

believe in anything either. You
and your like are trying to make
a war with the help of people
who just aren't interested.'"
(Pyle) " 'They don't want Com
munism.' "
"They want enough rice,' I
said. They don't want to be shot
at. They want one day to be much
the same as another. They don't
want our white skins around tell
ing them what they want.' "
" 'If Indochina goes '
"I know that record. Siam goes.
Malaya goes. Indonesia goes.
What does 'go' mean? If 1 be
lieved in your God and another
life, I'd bet my future harp
against your golden crown that
in five hundred years there may
be no New York or London, but
they'll be growing paddy in these
fields, they'll be carrying their
produce to market on long poles,
wearing their pointed hats. The
small boys will be sitting on the
buffalos. I like the bufl'alos,
