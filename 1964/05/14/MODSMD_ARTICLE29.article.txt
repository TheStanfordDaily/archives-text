## Role Of Academic Freedom 
### 
The multitude of uses to which
academic freedom has been put
this past year raises both the
immediate question of the nature
of academic freedom, and the
perennial question of the role of
academic freedom in a university
such as Stanford.
It is said to be absolute enough
to include, with little other justi
fication, the hiring of Marxist
professors and the inviting of
Communist speakers to college
campuses. It is interpreted as be
ing broad enough to be enhanced
by advocacy of nudism, tree love

and atheism,
and to be im
paired by Ih e
possibilty of ar
bitrary expul
sion of a student
on non-academic
grounds. And in
most of these

I situations it appears lo be a goal
! in itself.
These uses, 1 hough, seem to be
better examples of what academic
freedom is not, rather than what
i it is and what its use should be.
' Academic freedom is not. first of
all, academic license. Daily read
' ers are familiar with the case of
Mulford Q. Sibley, former Stan
ford professor now carrying on
at the University of Minnesota.
Sibley's latest claim to fame
| seems to be a statement that, in
the interest of academic freedom,
he would like to see professors,
individuals, or clubs advocating
communism, nudism, free love,
and atheism. (To be fair, he added
later that Christianity and celi
bacy should also have their "au
dible advocates.")

THIS PERFORMANCE should
i not be .justified by raising the
spectre of academic freedom
as I lie Minnesota Board of Re
gents said in response to the Sib-
I iey controversy, a university
; should cherish freedom, but
| equally it must cherish respon
sibility, "the natural corollary of
I freedom."
j Secondly, academic freedom is
; not a goal in itself. Presentation
and discussion of any particular
I topic must he justified by some
I reason other than serving aea
! demic freedom.
In this light, if there is any
thing to be learned from hearing
! a Communist speak on campus,
i then let us hear him, but I sub
| mit there are few aberrant ide
; ologues from which less will be
learned than from an American
j Communist. The president of the
College of San Mateo challenges
his Communist speaker, and the
students cheer. But this straw
man has long ago been hit and
has flown apart, and further
swinging will only create a
breeze.
If there is value to having a
Marxist professor of repute on
the faculty, then let us have him.
A good case should be made for
this on (he basis of the signifi
cance of his philosophy and the
challenge it presents to us in the
world today, but not for the rea
j son of academic freedom, saying
|Ihat all views have an equal
j right to be heard.

BUT DOES DENIAL of the
right of such views to be pre
sented in their.own right consti
i tute the heresy of closing a ques
; tion? May we not have an open
j society, though, and for the sake
of progress still have some ques
tions that are, for practical pur
poses, closed the value of an
open society, for instance? For
| example, the Regents' statement
i referred to earlier also said "The
most American activity of them
all is to think, to speak, and to
I inquire freely. The un-American
I activity is to deny such freedom."
An open question?
As this statement itself sug
gests, this doesn't mean that only
one point of view should be pre
sented a university with only
one idea will become dogmatic in
that view, and stagnant in intel
i lectual development. There is a
definite advantage in having
one's basic assumptions chal
lenged and various ideas pre
sented and this is the role of
a Sibley and a Baran, and.it
should be noted for those who
doubt, a Willmoore Kendall, also
a former Stanford professor.
Their .justification is not "aca
demic freedom."
What, then, is the role of aca
demic freedom? II could be said
to constitute a policy against ar
bitrary exercise of a university's
power to stifle questioning, de
bate, and controversy, but pri
marily in the university's own in
terest, and not for the sake of
academic freedom itself. This is
its purpose and its extent.
