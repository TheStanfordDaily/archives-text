### JIM HAUSER 
The Kenneth-Johnson Civil Rights Bill is unconstitutional.
It presupposes the accused is guilty until lie proves himself inno
cent and it violates the 13tli Amendment by forcing "involuntary
servitude" of citizens to persons of different race, color, or religion.
Dick We inig, past president of the Stanford Young Republicans,

defended this, the YR view lasH
night, against Joel Davidow, repre
sentative of the Young Democrats,
and teaching fellow at the S t a n
ford Law School, in a debate in the
Large Lounge of Tresidder.
WEI NIG said the bill violates
"the very basis of the Anglo-Sax
on legal tradition." He said il lays
the burden of proof on the accused
by requiring him to provide proof
that he is not discriminating
against another citizen.
Davidow said, "We arc dealing
wilh a civil rather than criminal
proceeding." First an effort is
made to reel i fy I he sit nation on t he
local level. That failing, the issue
is taken to the stale. Only il t he
state fails to take action does the
federal commission order the dis
crimination to stop.
ON THE SIX ON I) violation, the
commission may prescribe a pun
ishment up to $51)0 or 30 days in
jail. Any punishment exceeding
this requires that the accused be
granted a jury trial with all rights
guarantee I
Weinig said the bill enforces
"involuntary servitude" in that it
"forces a person against bis will'
to labor for another with or with
out pay. This is forbidden by the
13th amendment, the outlawing of
slavery.
In rebut tel. Davidow cited an
English law of the early 1700's for
bidding innkeepers to refuse lodg
ing to travelers of good character
if the lodge were not already full.
He asked if this were "involuntary
servitude."
WEINIG also charged that the
bill nowhere defines the word "dis
crimination." He said it is "un
limited power to achieve an undc
' lined objective.'"

Davidow said thai this is "true
bul typical" of national legislation.
"Neither 'unfair labor practices'
nor 'discrimination against a
un i on worker' are defined," yet
the Federal Trade Commission
and I he National Labor Relations
Board have been working success
fully for nearly 15 years.
