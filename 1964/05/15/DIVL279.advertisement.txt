What Is Man?
In recent times psychologists have joined with theologians and philosophers
in monumental efforts to answer the age-"ld question WHAT IS MAN? Ego
id, and collective unconscious have been added the terms used to describe
the non-material and invisible in each of us. Even in this materialistic age
few claim that man is just a physical organism, for each of us is forced to
recognize that he "loves" and "hates" and "thinks." Our brains may store
discreet bits of information, but also emotions, memories, and experiences
are somehow recorded in the mind. And something in us continually generates
new ideas and creates new thoughts which had not previously existed. Our
unique individual identity is unchanged since childhood, but personality or
soul clearly is growing and changing day by day.
Although man's own insights into his nature may be deep, greater clues
to the invisible in man are to be found by a careful study of God's revela
tion in the Holy Bible. God's Word tells us that the immaterial part of man
(soul and spirit) which "dwells" in the body is by far the most important
part.
Because man has a "body," he has, thrbugh the gates of his five senses,
an awareness of the physical, material world. Because he is "soul," man is
aware of himself and has a unique personality all his own. The soul is the
seat of affections, emotions, desires, imagination conscience, the self, Man
is also "spirit." Spirit is the capacity to be conscious of God and to com
mune with Him.
"For God is Spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in
spirit and in truth. (John 4:24).
However, each of us is born into this world "spiritually dead," which
means out of touch with God. It takes a "spiritual birth" to bring an individ
ual into fellowship with God. God the Holy Spirit takes up residence in
the inner man the moment "natural man" becomes "spiritual man" which
occurs whenever any individual accepts Jesus Christ.
After a person is born spiritually, he directs his attention and the activ
ities of his soul toward God. admonished by Scripture to desert the lusts of
his old nature and his love for the perishable and temporal things of the
material world. The indwelling Holy Spirit remolds the entire life of the
believer so that eventually he will be transformed into the likeness of Christ.
"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed
to the image of his Son. that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he
called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified."
Horn. 8:29, 30.
Man is God's great creation fallen to the depths of sin. With foresight and
j be the one perfect sacrifice for sin that all who would come to Christ might
j be the one perfect sacrifice for sin that all who would come to Christt might
j be restored and spend eternity with God.
Amound the world men fall into just two classes: the vast majority who
} have ignored God's provisions and love for them, and the Christians who
rejoice in daily fellowship with God. There is no need for you to be left
j outof the greatest adventure imaginable—eternal life with God. There is
I no need for you to be incomplete as a person or to live a shallow life.
It is our prayer that "Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith and
| that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with
j all the saints what is the breadth and height and depth, and to know the
j love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with the
I fullness of God." Eph. (3:17-19)

unique individual identity is unchanged since childhood, but personality or
soul clearly is growing and changing day by day.
Although man's own insights into his nature may be deep, greater clues
to the invisible in man are to be found by a careful study of God's revela
tion in the Holy Bible. God's Word tells us that the immaterial part of man
(soul and spirit) which "dwells" in the body is by far the most important
part.
Because man has a "body," he has, thrbugh the gates of his five senses,
an awareness of the physical, material world. Because he is "soul," man is
aware of himself and has a unique personality all his own. The soul is the
seat of affections, emotions, desires, imagination conscience, the self, Man
is also "spirit." Spirit is the capacity to be conscious of God and to com
mune with Him.
"For God is Spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in
spirit and in truth. (John 4:24).
However, each of us is born into this world "spiritually dead," which
means out of touch with God. It takes a "spiritual birth" to bring an individ
ual into fellowship with God. God the Holy Spirit takes up residence in
the inner man the moment "natural man" becomes "spiritual man" which
occurs whenever any individual accepts Jesus Christ.
After a person is born spiritually, he directs his attention and the activ
ities of his soul toward God. admonished by Scripture to desert the lusts of
his old nature and his love for the perishable and temporal things of the
material world. The indwelling Holy Spirit remolds the entire life of the
believer so that eventually he will be transformed into the likeness of Christ.
"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed
to the image of his Son. that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he
called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified."
Horn. 8:29, 30.
Man is God's great creation fallen to the depths of sin. With foresight and
j be the one perfect sacrifice for sin that all who would come to Christ might
j be the one perfect sacrifice for sin that all who would come to Christt might
j be restored and spend eternity with God.
Amound the world men fall into just two classes: the vast majority who
} have ignored God's provisions and love for them, and the Christians who
rejoice in daily fellowship with God. There is no need for you to be left
j outof the greatest adventure imaginable—eternal life with God. There is
I no need for you to be incomplete as a person or to live a shallow life.
It is our prayer that "Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith and
| that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with
j all the saints what is the breadth and height and depth, and to know the
j love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with the
I fullness of God." Eph. (3:17-19)
