shirtsleeve theology
Fuller's new "core" curriculum stresses shirtsleeve theology—shirt
sleeve theology that comes to grips with the gloom and grime as
well as the grace and glory of life, a theological curriculum that
includes fewer hut more intensive courses, special-interest seminars,
team teaching and independent study.
The first-year program begins like this. Under D. P. Fuller, stu
dents will receive the ground rules for biblical interpretation, and
E. J. Carnell will lay the spiritual and intellectual foundation for
their faith. These courses will prepare them for New Testament
Interpretation and Theology from E. F. Harrison and G. E. Ladd
as well as Church History and Theology from G. W. Bromiley and
I*. K. Jewett. At the same time, students will take courses in the
ministry and will be working continuously ai the task of putting
across the eternal gospel in speech and homiletic workshops.
In the midst of these changes one thing doesn't change —Fuller's
relentless commitment to the full authority of the Word of God and
the power of the Gospel as the only answer to the despair and
meaninglessness of contemporary life.
Fuller Theological Seminary is accredited by the American
Association of Theological Schools. For a closer look at Fuller's
