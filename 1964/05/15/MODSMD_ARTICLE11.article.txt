States and Red China is the poor U.S. news reporting, said Felix
Greene in his speech on Bed China last evening.
Greene estimates he is one"of only two or three United Stales
reporters who have been inside lied China in the last fourteen

years. "J
China, with the longest con
tinuous unbroken culture in the)
world, has made many important !
contributions to civilization. The
people are very proud of I hi s ,
heritage, he emphasized.
In spite of the immense hard-j
ship the country lias seen in re-j
cent years, the Chinese people
have faith in their leaders and a
solid confidence in their future.
The "seething unrest" against |
the present regime popularly as
sumed in our country, simply is |
not present, he stressed. Mu c h
confidence stems, he feels, from .
the tremendous improvement un
der the present regime in educa
tion and medeeine.
TIIE RECENT illiteracy rate ot
83-90 per cent has been much de
creased. Every child receives at
