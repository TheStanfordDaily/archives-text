including the entire canon, design

Douglas Russell, the costume de
signer at Stanford Players. Such
is not the case.
"When Carl Weber, the director,
spoke of the early Renaissance
simplicity of the script, I turned
to quite different sources for cos
tume designs, the naive frescoes
by Pierre della Francesca," said
Russell. "We use woolens and
monochrome brocades to get
that matte surface effect of the
plaster frescoes."
"FIRST I DRAW a small color
sketch, and then we go shopping
for fabrics to match the drawings.
With swatches in front of me, I
then paint a full costume plate,
imitating the plaster texture of
Francesca's frescoes, and then I
make patterns for the seamstress
es to use in cutting the cloth."
Five full-time seamstresses and
three part-time assistants have
been working at top speed to make
some thirty costumes in time for
the opening night on May 26.
"We make the lining first, out
of muslin, and the actor is called
in for his first fitting. It's cheaper
that way. Then we cut the good
cloth to the shape of the lining."
"THE TWO gentlemen of Vero
na" will play every evening from
May 26 to May 30 with matinee
planned for May 30 and 31. Tickets
and information may be obtained
at the Tresidder Union Box Office.
