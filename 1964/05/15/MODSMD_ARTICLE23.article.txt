# Red, White Teams Tangle Saturday
## 
### 
Coach John Ralston plans to
make good use of the football
team's last Saturday practice be
fore the Fifth Annual Varsity-
Alumni Game. He has divided the
68 players out for spring ball into
two squads theoretically equal
in both offensive and defensive
capabilities and will let ihem
tangle under actual game condi
tions.
Beginning at 2 p.m., the Red
squad will meet the White squad
in Stanford Stadium, referees and
all. Three coaches will handle each
team. Bob Gambold, Rod Rust,
and Len Davis are with the Reds,
and Leon McLaughlin, Bill Walsh,
and Mike White are with the
Whites.
FOR TIIE first throe weeks of
spring practice, Ralston has been
working all players on both of
fense 1 and defense. This Saturday,
he wants to tost the new substitu
tion rule. To do this, he has desig
nated offensive and defensive
units for each squad. No player is
listed as a starter on both units.
However, Ralston has indicated
that players such as Dick Rags
dale, Jack Chappie, and Bob How

lard, who are outstanding on both
offense and defense, will probably
; go both ways during the regular
I season.
The Red offense will have Dick
i Berg and Dave Lewis alternating
at the quarterback slot. Freshman
' Bob Blunt will tie th e running
| back, Glenn Myers the fullback,
and Phil Humphreys the flanker.
TRYING TO stop 1 h e m is a
capable defense that has Guy
Rounsaville and Gary Pelligrew
at the defensive ends. In between
them are DeLollis Brown, Bill
Ogle, Bob Nichols, and Bob Anion.
Allan Curr, Dick Shaw, and J. D.
Lodato make up the defensive
backfield.

The White offense can match
its opponent position for position.
Terry QeSylvia, Don Cook, a n d
John Propstra will each see action
directing the unit. Cook and Prop
stra. contrary to a story in Tues
day's Daily, did not play in last
week's scrim.
FORMING THE I will he run
ning hack Ray Handley, who has
impressed observers in earlier i
scrimmages, and John Read, a top
freshman prospect. Dick Rags- j
dale, who is a fine blocker and j
pass receiver, is the flanker.
The Red defense has a strong j
secondary in Craig Rilchey, Greg ;
Ford, and Rubin. The "Mac" and
"Mike" linebackers are Bob Ruth j
and Jack Chappie.
