# Baseball Team Meets Broncs
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
The Stanford baseball te a m
closes its season this weekend
with a two game series against
the CIBA runner-up, Santa Clara.
Today's game will be played a t
Santa Clara, and Saturday the two
teams will move to the Sunken
Diamond where at p.m. Jo h n
Mason will be on the mound for
the Indians in tin' season finale.
Santa Clara, who led the CIBA
for the early portion of the season,
has a tight grip on the second
place position but has no chance
of overtaking USC's Trojans.
Although the Bronco's fate has
already been decided, the Indians
I have a chance to move up two
! notches to fourth place from their
j present cellar position.
Mason has been a mound marvel
I of late, owning on the season a
respectable ERA of 2.7 Sand a
CIBA record of 1-2. he has struck
i out 29 while yielding a paltry three
runs in his last three trips to the
! mound.
Getting the nod for the first
game by Fehring is Dick Kovaee
vich, who is2-o in league play with
i a 4.39 ERA.
Expected pitchers for the strong
I Broncos from Santa Clara are
! Pete Magrini and southpaw Larry
j Loughlin.
Four players in the Stanford
lineup are over .300 in league play.
I Jim Hibbs, who bats in the num
ber three spot, leads the squad
with .361. Rightfielder Rich Berra
I bats sixth and is right behind with
j .360. Cliff Harris and Bob Cox,
j who bat 1-2, are at .333 and .323
respectively.
California has finished its sea
wit h two games to go against
UCLA, is 5-13. Stanford, which at
present is 4-14, would pass both
teams if it wins both games this
weekend and UCSB loses both its
contests. A split could possibly
; mean a three-way tie for fourth.
! Two losses would keep the status
quo.
1-Ie has respect for Santa Clara.
Pitching against them earlier in
the year, he went but two and one
third innings and absorbed the
loss.
