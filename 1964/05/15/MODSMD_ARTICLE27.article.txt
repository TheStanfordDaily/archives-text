# Toward A More Representative Student Congress
## Editorial 
### 
We haven't been exactly ecstatic about
the new regulation requiring voluntary poli
tical organizations to register their member
ship with the University.
As a matter of fact, we think it's rather
silly. And strict. And bureaucratic.
WE HAVE WATCHED with glee the
University's attempt to have the Student
Congress register its "membership." Th e
problem, of course, is simple: The congress,
under its present organization, is a political
forum open to any students who want to de
bate on the given topic. It has no regular
membership.

So how can an organization with no
membership' register its membership?
The University, however, does have a
good criticism of the present structure of
the congress. The Student Affairs and Serv
ices Committee lias pointed out that the con
gress is irresponsible because it leaves itsell
open to domination by any political faction.
But there's a remedy. One that would
certainly make the University membership
registration requirement look less farcical.
And one that would insure a more respon
sible congress.
REGULAR MEMBERS - one elected

from each living group — should be elected
to sit in the congress. Hopefully, they would
be elected because their political views rep
resented those oi the majority of their con
stituency.
This would give teeth to resolutions
passed by the congress. It would stimulate
campus political awareness — if only be
cause students would have to examine their
own views before choosing persons to rep

resent them. The Young Democrats, Young
Republicans and Political Union caucuses
could actively recruit candidates to run in
each of the living groups.
To still retain the open forum, the con
gress could grant all students the right to
speak — but not vote — on the floor.
THE UNIVERSITY might howl a bit.
Somebody might even cite the trustees' re
fusal last year to allow LASSU to speak out
on "off-campus" issues.
(LASSU is not officially representative
of the student body — that was the trustees
"reason." Nothing was mentioned about em

barrassing political stands. Or fund raising.)
A representative congress, however,
would still be in compliance with the trus
tees ruling. Its resolutions could still carry
disclaimers stating they were not "officially"
representative of the student body.
Perhaps such a re-organized congress
would eventually pave the way for LASSU's
right to speak out on political issues. Per
haps the trustees would even wake up to
the folly of shackling the Legislature.
Perhaps.
But, at any rate, parochialism will have
been dealt a nastv blow.

on "off-campus" issues.
(LASSU is not officially representative
of the student body — that was the trustees
"reason." Nothing was mentioned about em

barrassing political stands. Or fund raising.)
A representative congress, however,
would still be in compliance with the trus
tees ruling. Its resolutions could still carry
disclaimers stating they were not "officially"
representative of the student body.
Perhaps such a re-organized congress
would eventually pave the way for LASSU's
right to speak out on political issues. Per
haps the trustees would even wake up to
the folly of shackling the Legislature.
Perhaps.
But, at any rate, parochialism will have
been dealt a nastv blow.
We haven't been exactly ecstatic about
the new regulation requiring voluntary poli
tical organizations to register their member
ship with the University.
As a matter of fact, we think it's rather
silly. And strict. And bureaucratic.
WE HAVE WATCHED with glee the
University's attempt to have the Student
Congress register its "membership." Th e
problem, of course, is simple: The congress,
under its present organization, is a political
forum open to any students who want to de
bate on the given topic. It has no regular
membership.

So how can an organization with no
membership' register its membership?
The University, however, does have a
good criticism of the present structure of
the congress. The Student Affairs and Serv
ices Committee lias pointed out that the con
gress is irresponsible because it leaves itsell
open to domination by any political faction.
But there's a remedy. One that would
certainly make the University membership
registration requirement look less farcical.
And one that would insure a more respon
sible congress.
REGULAR MEMBERS - one elected

from each living group — should be elected
to sit in the congress. Hopefully, they would
be elected because their political views rep
resented those oi the majority of their con
stituency.
This would give teeth to resolutions
passed by the congress. It would stimulate
campus political awareness — if only be
cause students would have to examine their
own views before choosing persons to rep

resent them. The Young Democrats, Young
Republicans and Political Union caucuses
could actively recruit candidates to run in
each of the living groups.
To still retain the open forum, the con
gress could grant all students the right to
speak — but not vote — on the floor.
THE UNIVERSITY might howl a bit.
Somebody might even cite the trustees' re
fusal last year to allow LASSU to speak out
on "off-campus" issues.
