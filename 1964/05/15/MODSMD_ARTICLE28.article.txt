## Sid Caesar, 'Little Me' Adhere To Musical Comedy Customs 
### Foster Hirsch 
"Little Me," wliicli inaugurates the San Francisco Civic Light
Opera Season at the Cumin Theatre, adheres for the most part to
the established and workmanlike conventions of musical comedy.
Its subject matter recounts in the form of a memoir the rise of
a dumb, monstrous blonde named Belle Poitrinc to fame, culture,
and social position in, ol all places, Hollywood, California.
This variation 011 the Horatio \lger theme remains well within
the bounds appropriate to the musical coined \ form; nothing here
is unsuitably romanticized ("West Side Story and Oliver come
readilv to mind as offenders on this account). Also obedient to the
form, the score is slight and vaguely charming, the sets and cos
tumes are extravagantly colorful, the choreography is athletic, the
dialogue is undemanding, slick, and forgettable.

THE CAST , with one grievous exception, behaves exactly as
musical comedy performers ought to behave: they speak much
louder and more distinctly than they really should, they talk their
songs, they work devilishly hard at exuding personality, their de
livery is timed with an almost ruthless precision, and, fortunately,
they don't bear the slightest resemblance to any person who ever
lived on the other side of the footlights. Far Irom being offensive,
all of these conventionalized mannerisms are in impeccable har
mony with the material.
Regrettably ', the one grievous exception is the shows star, who
happens to be Sid Caesar, the television and night club comedian.
Mr. Caesar is a comedian; he is not, by even the most charitable
stretch of the imagination, an actor, lie is here called upon to
plav seven men who figure in Miss Poitrincs memoirs, and he
doesn't do us the* honor ol even attempting to differentiate his
characters.
His identical approach to each is reminiscent of the devices he
used years ago w hen he appeared on television with lmogene Coca
in "Your Show ol Shows, The sameness and limitations of his
comic talents are all too prominent when he is confronted with a
task which rightfully demands the protean versatility of a Peter
Sellers.
His diction is unforgivabh sloppy, and his timing — complete
with mumbling and stuttering — lacks the economy needed to keep
pace with his colleagues.

IN THUS FASHIONING their play as a showcase for Sit 1 Cae
sar rather than as a satire 011 Hollywood stars, the adapters of
Patrick Dennis' very funny novel have played their cards ill, for
the story of belle's struggle for stardom is in itself profitable if not
altogether original material. Indeed, her story provides ample
opportunity for satirizing the tinsel, ugly-glamorous, eccentric
world of Hollywood.
As is, this world is realized only partially, for too often the
focus reduces Belle to a backdrop for Comedian Caesars extran
eops antics, liven the roles he plays, except for a screwball movie
director and a Monte Carlo prince, have only a tangential rela
tion to Belle and her career.
"Little Me continues at the Curran through June 19; you go
at your own risk.
