## Proposed Admission To College By Draw 
### 
K<litor, Tlie Day:
I am one of the 23 men living
in those big white houses on the
row (there used 10 be 21 of us.
but one was kicked nut because
he was straying from our image 1.
and I was interested in reading
about the New Housing Draw
Plan proposed to LASSU by the
three members of the freshman
class. It brings up a similar pro
posal which I plan to present to
LASSU next week, but on a more
general level.
It seems to me that the present
system of selection by the differ
ent American Universities of the
students who may attend them
is invalid and a denial of the stu
dent's dignity and basic rights.
No University should assume the
right to make value judgments on
people. When this happens (as it
does at Stanford where only well
rounded, intellectual, creative,
athletic people are admitted), the
student's learning opportunities
are restricted because he associ
ates with only those '"mirror im
ages."
Therefore, I propose a two
point program in which:
(1) All American Universities
will give their powers of selection
to a central drawing committee,
who will place students in univer
sities according to the results of
this drawing, and will disregard
all qualifications, etc.
(2i In expressing a preference,
each student must list eight
people who he hates and would
like to room with, so as to create
an intellectual atmosphere.
If this proposal is passed by
LASSU, of which I have no fear
(they recently sanctioned a test
ban treaty with Russia), then
Schatz, Jacobi, Sorenson, Inc.,
don't have to worry about trying
to get their proposal passed, for
Ihe problem will tie solved. How
ever. if by some chance it doesn't
pass, may I suggest they talk to
Dean Allen and try to get in on
this year's row house drawing.

Reading the article on "To
tem ization of Human Rights," I
wonder if the sports desk's Roger
Magnuson has developed totems
on-the-brain. He has used his evi
dent satirical talents to pile on
one another a number of seduc
tive (sneaky, unfair) insinuations
and phallaeies.
References to Tommy Manville
and 1984 are beside the point.
Placing "the basic human right
of association with every other
human" above the "property
right" is misleading. Suggesting
the imprisonment of bigots flee
ing minority group members in
their neighborhoods is imagina
tive. but inaccurate. II is com
paratively easy to lie "charmingly
irrelevant," but is Mr. Magnuson,
as an opponent of the Rum ford
Act misinformation or misan
thropy?
The ethical question at stake is
whether or not one citizen is to
be allowed the same inalienable
rights as another citizen. The
right to be set over "property
right" is the right to a society in
which Magnuson. if he were
turned black today, could expect
no catastrophic change in behav
ior from his parents, teachers,
neighbors or employers. In par
ticular, the right to live in a home
financed by public tax money
Mr. Magnuson's own tax money
(or an apartment of five units
or more) is set above the "prop
erty right."
Let Mr. Magnuson be reminded
that this "property right" is de
nied citizens who wish to sell
liquor to minors or avoid taxes.
It is time that opponents of the
Rumford Act stop crying "coer
cion!" talking of imprisonment
of violators — and consider that it
might be as important as liquor
and tax laws to rid our state of
the ethically absurd denial to par
ticular members of our society of
the opportunity for life and lib

erty guaranteed to all in the
United States Constitution.

The author of the Daily editor
ial on Moral Re-Armament, man
aged to misunderstand some of
the points being made in the paid
•advertisement. One such point
made by the display was that we
should not allow complete free
dom to those who do not believe
in God if we do not allow it to
those who do. After misconstru
ing this point the editorial says
Moral Re-Armament is one of
v 1 hose "who proclaim one set of
standards and live another."
In another misinterpretation
the editorial accuses Moral Re-
Armament of "anti-intellectual
ism." The Daily writer believes
this is the obvious conclusion of
the display statement which says
"we are in revolt against the line
of the 'new morality' which is
forced down our throats by
books, magazines, television,
films, professors and so m e
churchmen." Moral Re-Armament
is not anti-intellectual.
The author also seemed to have
misplaced his journalistic integ
rity while writing this editorial.
It is a pretty cheap trick to com
pare anyone whose goal is to "bel
ter humanity." to quote the
Daily, to Hitler and Stalin. Equa
tion with these two men has be
come a catch-all for ihe things
some people react to.
The Gestapo made a 126-page
attack on Moral Re-Armament.
Radio Moscow says it is "a glo
bal ideology with bridgeheads in
every nation in its final stage of
total expansion throughout the
world. It has the power to cap
ture 1 radical revolutionary minds.
It is contaminating the minds of
Ihe masses, li subsitiutes for the
inevitable class war, the eternal
struggle between good and evil."
This is the same outfit the Daily
editorial referred to as "paro
chial."
On another issue, Moral Re-
Armament certainly realizes the
importance of not swallowing
meaningless phrases, but impor
tant declarations of principle
have to be made. That is why the
Daily should have done some
thinking about the declarations
in ihe display before it regurgi
tated. The Daily acted a bit like
a spoiled child who upon seeing
a new type of pudding immedi
ately hollers he does not want
any without lasting it.
The challenge before the Uni
versity students of today is to
think responsibly about what we
want our generation to accom
plish in the next ten years. Where

do we want to take the world?
The best minds, including Daily

Editor, The Daily:
We at the I-Center wore pleased
to gather from the story on the
: Graduate Student Association in
i the Wednesday, May 6, Daily that
. the success of the Bochtel Inter
; national Student Center in i Is
first year of operation has led the
! Association to consider as one of
its eventual goals "the organiza
i tion of a graduate student center
i similar in function to the I-Cen
! ter."
Perhaps the construction of a
separate building or of an exten
sion of the Tresidder Union for
j a graduate center should be seri
ously considered. In the mean
, time however it should be known
' that from the beginning the I
j Center was thought of as a grad
uate student center, especially
since almost ninety per cent of
j Stanford's foreign students are
j graduates.
More than that, the I-Center is
I designed for the entire Stanford
j community and particularly for
, students who look for a quiet eor
; ner to think or to read, or for con
: versation about topics other than
! grades and dates. Anyone hesi-
I tant to enter "a room full of
; turbans" should know that half
i the people using the I-Center are
Americans many of them in
graduate school or at work in the
community.
i In short, the International Cen
j ter is not a special club for spe
j cial people. It seeks to serve Stan-
I ford in the same fashion and in
i many ways for the same educa
i tional and social purposes as the
; Library, the Bookstore and the
j Union. The (red) carpet is out to
all (come and research the
color!) and most particularly
to graduate students.

Editor, The Daily:
We, the ten Keio University
students from Japan, would like
to extend our deepest thanks to
tlie Students of Stanford Univer
sity and the Stanford Community
as a whole for hosting us on our
recent exchange to Stanford.
Although we lived at Stanford
for only half the quarter, we feel
Jwe gained a keen insight into the
,life of American students. Hot h
those who lived in fraternities
and those in dormitories fou nd
the Stanford students anxious to
both learn about Japan and help
jus learn about the United States.
More important to us person
ally, however, are the large num
ber of close friends that we all
'made. We know, that although
we are now returning to Japan,
jwe have established friendships
which will last for the years to
come. In this way we can hope
lo repay in part the debt we feel
we owe to Stanford.
Specifically, we would like to
thank those directly involved with
i the program, those who took their
time to insure us a worthwhile
visit. Jack Sclntler, along with
the entire Keio committee of the
| lIR, deserves special thanks, as
jdoes Dr. Warmbrunn, the Foreign
Studenl Advisor.
'■ We are looking forward to host
ing the Stanford Students in
I Japan this summer, and we only
hope that the students of Stan-
I ford will continue the exchange
lin future years so that others
I many enjoy the experience as we
j did.
Thank you very much.

Editor, The Daily:
We, the ten Keio University
students from Japan, would like
to extend our deepest thanks to
tlie Students of Stanford Univer
sity and the Stanford Community
as a whole for hosting us on our
recent exchange to Stanford.
Although we lived at Stanford
for only half the quarter, we feel
Jwe gained a keen insight into the
,life of American students. Hot h
those who lived in fraternities
and those in dormitories fou nd
the Stanford students anxious to
both learn about Japan and help
jus learn about the United States.
More important to us person
ally, however, are the large num
ber of close friends that we all
'made. We know, that although
we are now returning to Japan,
jwe have established friendships
which will last for the years to
come. In this way we can hope
lo repay in part the debt we feel
we owe to Stanford.
Specifically, we would like to
thank those directly involved with
i the program, those who took their
time to insure us a worthwhile
visit. Jack Sclntler, along with
the entire Keio committee of the

jdoes Dr. Warmbrunn, the Foreign

hope that the students of Stan-

I am one of the 23 men living
in those big white houses on the
row (there used 10 be 21 of us.
but one was kicked nut because
he was straying from our image 1.
and I was interested in reading
about the New Housing Draw
Plan proposed to LASSU by the
three members of the freshman
class. It brings up a similar pro
posal which I plan to present to
LASSU next week, but on a more
general level.
It seems to me that the present
system of selection by the differ
ent American Universities of the
students who may attend them
is invalid and a denial of the stu
dent's dignity and basic rights.
No University should assume the
right to make value judgments on
people. When this happens (as it
does at Stanford where only well
rounded, intellectual, creative,
athletic people are admitted), the
student's learning opportunities
are restricted because he associ
ates with only those '"mirror im
ages."
Therefore, I propose a two
point program in which:
(1) All American Universities
will give their powers of selection
to a central drawing committee,
who will place students in univer
sities according to the results of
this drawing, and will disregard
all qualifications, etc.
(2i In expressing a preference,
each student must list eight
people who he hates and would
like to room with, so as to create
an intellectual atmosphere.
If this proposal is passed by
LASSU, of which I have no fear
(they recently sanctioned a test
ban treaty with Russia), then
Schatz, Jacobi, Sorenson, Inc.,
don't have to worry about trying
to get their proposal passed, for
Ihe problem will tie solved. How
ever. if by some chance it doesn't
pass, may I suggest they talk to
Dean Allen and try to get in on
this year's row house drawing.

Reading the article on "To
tem ization of Human Rights," I
wonder if the sports desk's Roger
Magnuson has developed totems
on-the-brain. He has used his evi
dent satirical talents to pile on
one another a number of seduc
tive (sneaky, unfair) insinuations
and phallaeies.
References to Tommy Manville
and 1984 are beside the point.
Placing "the basic human right
of association with every other
human" above the "property
right" is misleading. Suggesting
the imprisonment of bigots flee
ing minority group members in
their neighborhoods is imagina
tive. but inaccurate. II is com
paratively easy to lie "charmingly
irrelevant," but is Mr. Magnuson,
as an opponent of the Rum ford
Act misinformation or misan
thropy?
The ethical question at stake is
whether or not one citizen is to
be allowed the same inalienable
rights as another citizen. The
right to be set over "property
right" is the right to a society in
which Magnuson. if he were
turned black today, could expect
no catastrophic change in behav
ior from his parents, teachers,
neighbors or employers. In par
ticular, the right to live in a home
financed by public tax money
Mr. Magnuson's own tax money
(or an apartment of five units
or more) is set above the "prop
erty right."
Let Mr. Magnuson be reminded
that this "property right" is de
nied citizens who wish to sell
liquor to minors or avoid taxes.
It is time that opponents of the
Rumford Act stop crying "coer
cion!" talking of imprisonment
of violators — and consider that it
might be as important as liquor
and tax laws to rid our state of
the ethically absurd denial to par
ticular members of our society of
the opportunity for life and lib

erty guaranteed to all in the
United States Constitution.

The author of the Daily editor
ial on Moral Re-Armament, man
aged to misunderstand some of
the points being made in the paid
•advertisement. One such point
made by the display was that we
should not allow complete free
dom to those who do not believe
in God if we do not allow it to
those who do. After misconstru
ing this point the editorial says
Moral Re-Armament is one of
v 1 hose "who proclaim one set of
standards and live another."
In another misinterpretation
the editorial accuses Moral Re-
Armament of "anti-intellectual
ism." The Daily writer believes
this is the obvious conclusion of
the display statement which says
"we are in revolt against the line
of the 'new morality' which is
forced down our throats by
books, magazines, television,
films, professors and so m e
churchmen." Moral Re-Armament
is not anti-intellectual.
The author also seemed to have
misplaced his journalistic integ
rity while writing this editorial.
It is a pretty cheap trick to com
pare anyone whose goal is to "bel
ter humanity." to quote the
Daily, to Hitler and Stalin. Equa
tion with these two men has be
come a catch-all for ihe things
some people react to.
The Gestapo made a 126-page
attack on Moral Re-Armament.
Radio Moscow says it is "a glo
bal ideology with bridgeheads in
every nation in its final stage of
total expansion throughout the
world. It has the power to cap
ture 1 radical revolutionary minds.
It is contaminating the minds of
Ihe masses, li subsitiutes for the
inevitable class war, the eternal
struggle between good and evil."
This is the same outfit the Daily
editorial referred to as "paro
chial."
On another issue, Moral Re-
Armament certainly realizes the
importance of not swallowing
meaningless phrases, but impor
tant declarations of principle
have to be made. That is why the
Daily should have done some
thinking about the declarations
in ihe display before it regurgi
tated. The Daily acted a bit like
a spoiled child who upon seeing
a new type of pudding immedi
ately hollers he does not want
any without lasting it.
The challenge before the Uni
versity students of today is to
think responsibly about what we
want our generation to accom
plish in the next ten years. Where

do we want to take the world?
The best minds, including Daily

We at the I-Center wore pleased
to gather from the story on the

. the success of the Bochtel Inter

first year of operation has led the
! Association to consider as one of
its eventual goals "the organiza

i similar in function to the I-Cen

Perhaps the construction of a
separate building or of an exten
sion of the Tresidder Union for
j a graduate center should be seri
ously considered. In the mean
, time however it should be known
' that from the beginning the I
j Center was thought of as a grad

• I-Center Success
Editor, The Daily:
We at the I-Center wore pleased
to gather from the story on the
: Graduate Student Association in
i the Wednesday, May 6, Daily that
. the success of the Bochtel Inter
; national Student Center in i Is
first year of operation has led the
! Association to consider as one of
its eventual goals "the organiza
i tion of a graduate student center
i similar in function to the I-Cen
! ter."
Perhaps the construction of a
separate building or of an exten
sion of the Tresidder Union for
j a graduate center should be seri
ously considered. In the mean
, time however it should be known
' that from the beginning the I
j Center was thought of as a grad
uate student center, especially
since almost ninety per cent of
j Stanford's foreign students are
j graduates.
More than that, the I-Center is
I designed for the entire Stanford
j community and particularly for
, students who look for a quiet eor
; ner to think or to read, or for con
: versation about topics other than
! grades and dates. Anyone hesi-
I tant to enter "a room full of
; turbans" should know that half
i the people using the I-Center are
Americans many of them in
graduate school or at work in the
community.
i In short, the International Cen
j ter is not a special club for spe
j cial people. It seeks to serve Stan-
I ford in the same fashion and in
i many ways for the same educa
i tional and social purposes as the

Editor, The Daily:
We, the ten Keio University
students from Japan, would like
to extend our deepest thanks to
tlie Students of Stanford Univer
sity and the Stanford Community
as a whole for hosting us on our
recent exchange to Stanford.
Although we lived at Stanford
for only half the quarter, we feel
Jwe gained a keen insight into the
,life of American students. Hot h
those who lived in fraternities
and those in dormitories fou nd
the Stanford students anxious to
both learn about Japan and help
jus learn about the United States.
More important to us person
ally, however, are the large num
ber of close friends that we all
'made. We know, that although
we are now returning to Japan,
jwe have established friendships
which will last for the years to
come. In this way we can hope
lo repay in part the debt we feel
we owe to Stanford.
Specifically, we would like to
thank those directly involved with
i the program, those who took their
time to insure us a worthwhile
visit. Jack Sclntler, along with
the entire Keio committee of the
| lIR, deserves special thanks, as
jdoes Dr. Warmbrunn, the Foreign

hope that the students of Stan-

I am one of the 23 men living
in those big white houses on the

but one was kicked nut because
he was straying from our image 1.
and I was interested in reading
about the New Housing Draw
Plan proposed to LASSU by the
three members of the freshman
class. It brings up a similar pro
posal which I plan to present to
LASSU next week, but on a more
general level.
It seems to me that the present
system of selection by the differ
ent American Universities of the
students who may attend them
is invalid and a denial of the stu
dent's dignity and basic rights.
No University should assume the
right to make value judgments on
people. When this happens (as it
does at Stanford where only well
rounded, intellectual, creative,
athletic people are admitted), the
student's learning opportunities
are restricted because he associ
ates with only those '"mirror im
ages."
Therefore, I propose a two
point program in which:
(1) All American Universities
will give their powers of selection
to a central drawing committee,
who will place students in univer
sities according to the results of
this drawing, and will disregard
all qualifications, etc.
(2i In expressing a preference,
each student must list eight
people who he hates and would
like to room with, so as to create
an intellectual atmosphere.
If this proposal is passed by
LASSU, of which I have no fear
(they recently sanctioned a test
ban treaty with Russia), then
Schatz, Jacobi, Sorenson, Inc.,
don't have to worry about trying
to get their proposal passed, for
Ihe problem will tie solved. How
ever. if by some chance it doesn't

Reading the article on "To
tem ization of Human Rights," I
wonder if the sports desk's Roger
Magnuson has developed totems
on-the-brain. He has used his evi
dent satirical talents to pile on
one another a number of seduc
tive (sneaky, unfair) insinuations
and phallaeies.
References to Tommy Manville
and 1984 are beside the point.
Placing "the basic human right
of association with every other
human" above the "property
right" is misleading. Suggesting
the imprisonment of bigots flee
ing minority group members in
their neighborhoods is imagina
tive. but inaccurate. II is com
paratively easy to lie "charmingly
irrelevant," but is Mr. Magnuson,
as an opponent of the Rum ford
Act misinformation or misan
thropy?
The ethical question at stake is
whether or not one citizen is to
be allowed the same inalienable
rights as another citizen. The
right to be set over "property
right" is the right to a society in
which Magnuson. if he were
turned black today, could expect
no catastrophic change in behav
ior from his parents, teachers,
neighbors or employers. In par
ticular, the right to live in a home
financed by public tax money
Mr. Magnuson's own tax money
(or an apartment of five units
or more) is set above the "prop
erty right."
Let Mr. Magnuson be reminded
that this "property right" is de
nied citizens who wish to sell
liquor to minors or avoid taxes.
It is time that opponents of the
Rumford Act stop crying "coer
cion!" talking of imprisonment
of violators — and consider that it
might be as important as liquor
and tax laws to rid our state of
the ethically absurd denial to par
ticular members of our society of
the opportunity for life and lib

erty guaranteed to all in the
United States Constitution.

The author of the Daily editor
ial on Moral Re-Armament, man
aged to misunderstand some of
the points being made in the paid
•advertisement. One such point
made by the display was that we
should not allow complete free
dom to those who do not believe
in God if we do not allow it to
those who do. After misconstru
ing this point the editorial says
Moral Re-Armament is one of
v 1 hose "who proclaim one set of
standards and live another."
In another misinterpretation
the editorial accuses Moral Re-
Armament of "anti-intellectual
ism." The Daily writer believes
this is the obvious conclusion of
the display statement which says
"we are in revolt against the line
of the 'new morality' which is
forced down our throats by
books, magazines, television,
films, professors and so m e
churchmen." Moral Re-Armament
is not anti-intellectual.
The author also seemed to have
misplaced his journalistic integ
rity while writing this editorial.
It is a pretty cheap trick to com
pare anyone whose goal is to "bel
ter humanity." to quote the
Daily, to Hitler and Stalin. Equa
tion with these two men has be
come a catch-all for ihe things
some people react to.
The Gestapo made a 126-page
attack on Moral Re-Armament.
Radio Moscow says it is "a glo
bal ideology with bridgeheads in
every nation in its final stage of
total expansion throughout the
world. It has the power to cap
ture 1 radical revolutionary minds.
It is contaminating the minds of
Ihe masses, li subsitiutes for the
inevitable class war, the eternal
struggle between good and evil."
This is the same outfit the Daily
editorial referred to as "paro
chial."
On another issue, Moral Re-
Armament certainly realizes the
importance of not swallowing
meaningless phrases, but impor
tant declarations of principle
have to be made. That is why the
Daily should have done some
thinking about the declarations
in ihe display before it regurgi
tated. The Daily acted a bit like
a spoiled child who upon seeing

We at the I-Center wore pleased
to gather from the story on the
: Graduate Student Association in
i the Wednesday, May 6, Daily that
. the success of the Bochtel Inter
; national Student Center in i Is
first year of operation has led the
! Association to consider as one of
its eventual goals "the organiza
i tion of a graduate student center
i similar in function to the I-Cen
! ter."
Perhaps the construction of a
separate building or of an exten
sion of the Tresidder Union for
j a graduate center should be seri
ously considered. In the mean
, time however it should be known
' that from the beginning the I
j Center was thought of as a grad
uate student center, especially
since almost ninety per cent of
j Stanford's foreign students are
j graduates.
More than that, the I-Center is
I designed for the entire Stanford
j community and particularly for
, students who look for a quiet eor
; ner to think or to read, or for con
: versation about topics other than
! grades and dates. Anyone hesi-
I tant to enter "a room full of
; turbans" should know that half
i the people using the I-Center are
Americans many of them in
graduate school or at work in the
community.
i In short, the International Cen

i many ways for the same educa

We, the ten Keio University
students from Japan, would like
to extend our deepest thanks to
tlie Students of Stanford Univer
sity and the Stanford Community
as a whole for hosting us on our
recent exchange to Stanford.
Although we lived at Stanford
for only half the quarter, we feel
Jwe gained a keen insight into the
,life of American students. Hot h
those who lived in fraternities
and those in dormitories fou nd
the Stanford students anxious to
both learn about Japan and help
jus learn about the United States.
More important to us person
ally, however, are the large num
ber of close friends that we all
'made. We know, that although
we are now returning to Japan,
jwe have established friendships
which will last for the years to
come. In this way we can hope
lo repay in part the debt we feel
we owe to Stanford.
Specifically, we would like to
thank those directly involved with
i the program, those who took their
time to insure us a worthwhile
visit. Jack Sclntler, along with
the entire Keio committee of the

I am one of the 23 men living
in those big white houses on the

but one was kicked nut because
he was straying from our image 1.
and I was interested in reading
about the New Housing Draw
Plan proposed to LASSU by the
three members of the freshman
class. It brings up a similar pro
posal which I plan to present to
LASSU next week, but on a more
general level.
It seems to me that the present
system of selection by the differ
ent American Universities of the
students who may attend them
is invalid and a denial of the stu
dent's dignity and basic rights.
No University should assume the
right to make value judgments on
people. When this happens (as it
does at Stanford where only well
rounded, intellectual, creative,
athletic people are admitted), the
student's learning opportunities
are restricted because he associ
ates with only those '"mirror im
ages."
Therefore, I propose a two
point program in which:
(1) All American Universities
will give their powers of selection
to a central drawing committee,
who will place students in univer
sities according to the results of
this drawing, and will disregard
all qualifications, etc.
(2i In expressing a preference,
each student must list eight
people who he hates and would
like to room with, so as to create
an intellectual atmosphere.
If this proposal is passed by
LASSU, of which I have no fear
(they recently sanctioned a test
ban treaty with Russia), then
Schatz, Jacobi, Sorenson, Inc.,
don't have to worry about trying
to get their proposal passed, for
Ihe problem will tie solved. How
ever. if by some chance it doesn't
pass, may I suggest they talk to
Dean Allen and try to get in on
this year's row house drawing.

• Toteniizalion
Kditor, Tlie Daily:
Reading the article on "To
tem ization of Human Rights," I
wonder if the sports desk's Roger
Magnuson has developed totems
on-the-brain. He has used his evi
dent satirical talents to pile on
one another a number of seduc
tive (sneaky, unfair) insinuations
and phallaeies.
References to Tommy Manville
and 1984 are beside the point.
Placing "the basic human right
of association with every other
human" above the "property
right" is misleading. Suggesting
the imprisonment of bigots flee
ing minority group members in
their neighborhoods is imagina
tive. but inaccurate. II is com
paratively easy to lie "charmingly
irrelevant," but is Mr. Magnuson,
as an opponent of the Rum ford
Act misinformation or misan
thropy?
The ethical question at stake is
whether or not one citizen is to
be allowed the same inalienable
rights as another citizen. The
right to be set over "property
right" is the right to a society in
which Magnuson. if he were
turned black today, could expect
no catastrophic change in behav
ior from his parents, teachers,
neighbors or employers. In par
ticular, the right to live in a home
financed by public tax money
Mr. Magnuson's own tax money
(or an apartment of five units
or more) is set above the "prop
erty right."
Let Mr. Magnuson be reminded
that this "property right" is de
nied citizens who wish to sell
liquor to minors or avoid taxes.
It is time that opponents of the
Rumford Act stop crying "coer
cion!" talking of imprisonment
of violators — and consider that it
might be as important as liquor
and tax laws to rid our state of
the ethically absurd denial to par
ticular members of our society of

Therefore, I propose a two
point program in which:
(1) All American Universities
will give their powers of selection
to a central drawing committee,
who will place students in univer

all qualifications, etc.
(2i In expressing a preference,
each student must list eight
people who he hates and would
like to room with, so as to create

If this proposal is passed by
LASSU, of which I have no fear
(they recently sanctioned a test
ban treaty with Russia), then
Schatz, Jacobi, Sorenson, Inc.,
don't have to worry about trying
to get their proposal passed, for

Reading the article on "To
tem ization of Human Rights," I
wonder if the sports desk's Roger
Magnuson has developed totems
on-the-brain. He has used his evi
dent satirical talents to pile on
one another a number of seduc
tive (sneaky, unfair) insinuations
and phallaeies.
References to Tommy Manville
and 1984 are beside the point.
Placing "the basic human right
of association with every other
human" above the "property
right" is misleading. Suggesting
the imprisonment of bigots flee
ing minority group members in
their neighborhoods is imagina
tive. but inaccurate. II is com
paratively easy to lie "charmingly
irrelevant," but is Mr. Magnuson,
as an opponent of the Rum ford
Act misinformation or misan
thropy?
The ethical question at stake is
whether or not one citizen is to
be allowed the same inalienable
rights as another citizen. The
right to be set over "property
right" is the right to a society in
which Magnuson. if he were
turned black today, could expect
no catastrophic change in behav
ior from his parents, teachers,
neighbors or employers. In par
ticular, the right to live in a home
financed by public tax money
Mr. Magnuson's own tax money
(or an apartment of five units
or more) is set above the "prop
erty right."
Let Mr. Magnuson be reminded
that this "property right" is de
nied citizens who wish to sell
liquor to minors or avoid taxes.
It is time that opponents of the
Rumford Act stop crying "coer
cion!" talking of imprisonment
of violators — and consider that it
might be as important as liquor
and tax laws to rid our state of
the ethically absurd denial to par
ticular members of our society of
the opportunity for life and lib

erty guaranteed to all in the
United States Constitution.

The author also seemed to have

Perhaps the construction of a

' that from the beginning the I

since almost ninety per cent of

More than that, the I-Center is

for only half the quarter, we feel
Jwe gained a keen insight into the
,life of American students. Hot h
those who lived in fraternities
and those in dormitories fou nd
the Stanford students anxious to
both learn about Japan and help
jus learn about the United States.
More important to us person
ally, however, are the large num
ber of close friends that we all
'made. We know, that although
we are now returning to Japan,
jwe have established friendships
which will last for the years to
come. In this way we can hope
lo repay in part the debt we feel
we owe to Stanford.
Specifically, we would like to
thank those directly involved with
i the program, those who took their
time to insure us a worthwhile
visit. Jack Sclntler, along with
the entire Keio committee of the
| lIR, deserves special thanks, as
jdoes Dr. Warmbrunn, the Foreign
Studenl Advisor.
'■ We are looking forward to host
ing the Stanford Students in
I Japan this summer, and we only
hope that the students of Stan-
I ford will continue the exchange
lin future years so that others
I many enjoy the experience as we
j did.
Thank you very much.

K<litor, Tlie Day:
I am one of the 23 men living
in those big white houses on the
row (there used 10 be 21 of us.
but one was kicked nut because
he was straying from our image 1.
and I was interested in reading
about the New Housing Draw
Plan proposed to LASSU by the
three members of the freshman
class. It brings up a similar pro
posal which I plan to present to
LASSU next week, but on a more
general level.
It seems to me that the present
system of selection by the differ
ent American Universities of the
students who may attend them
is invalid and a denial of the stu
dent's dignity and basic rights.
No University should assume the
right to make value judgments on
people. When this happens (as it
does at Stanford where only well
rounded, intellectual, creative,
athletic people are admitted), the
student's learning opportunities
are restricted because he associ
ates with only those '"mirror im
ages."
Therefore, I propose a two
point program in which:
(1) All American Universities
will give their powers of selection
to a central drawing committee,
who will place students in univer
sities according to the results of
this drawing, and will disregard
all qualifications, etc.
(2i In expressing a preference,
each student must list eight
people who he hates and would
like to room with, so as to create
an intellectual atmosphere.
If this proposal is passed by
LASSU, of which I have no fear
(they recently sanctioned a test
ban treaty with Russia), then
Schatz, Jacobi, Sorenson, Inc.,
don't have to worry about trying
to get their proposal passed, for
Ihe problem will tie solved. How
ever. if by some chance it doesn't
pass, may I suggest they talk to
Dean Allen and try to get in on
this year's row house drawing.

• Toteniizalion
Kditor, Tlie Daily:
Reading the article on "To
tem ization of Human Rights," I
wonder if the sports desk's Roger
Magnuson has developed totems
on-the-brain. He has used his evi
dent satirical talents to pile on
one another a number of seduc
tive (sneaky, unfair) insinuations
and phallaeies.
References to Tommy Manville
and 1984 are beside the point.
Placing "the basic human right
of association with every other
human" above the "property
right" is misleading. Suggesting
the imprisonment of bigots flee
ing minority group members in
their neighborhoods is imagina
tive. but inaccurate. II is com
paratively easy to lie "charmingly
irrelevant," but is Mr. Magnuson,
as an opponent of the Rum ford
Act misinformation or misan
thropy?
The ethical question at stake is
whether or not one citizen is to
be allowed the same inalienable
rights as another citizen. The
right to be set over "property
right" is the right to a society in
which Magnuson. if he were
turned black today, could expect
no catastrophic change in behav
ior from his parents, teachers,
neighbors or employers. In par
ticular, the right to live in a home
financed by public tax money
Mr. Magnuson's own tax money
(or an apartment of five units
or more) is set above the "prop
erty right."
Let Mr. Magnuson be reminded
that this "property right" is de
nied citizens who wish to sell
liquor to minors or avoid taxes.
It is time that opponents of the
Rumford Act stop crying "coer
cion!" talking of imprisonment
of violators — and consider that it
might be as important as liquor
and tax laws to rid our state of
the ethically absurd denial to par
ticular members of our society of
the opportunity for life and lib

erty guaranteed to all in the
United States Constitution.

• Stanford Garage
Editor, The Daily:
Blocking the entrance to the
main library stacks is a door
which might better grace an auto
motive repair shop. Idling out
side this door on Sunday eve. we
think of way to gel in for a last
minute "timing up." Running
downstairs, we find that the Engi
neering library has also, provi
dently, been locked up for the
night.
The $109.000,000 Pace Program
success and the $1,410 tuition pay
ments of 10,000 students has l'il
lipped tin 1 financial arguments
against extending weekend li
brary hours. Such irony. S t a n
ford invests so much in research
teaching and publication and then
lets an iron door drop on it all!
If the University is preparing
us for the ft to psychology of
Lou's garage, then I suggest that
a time clock be installed by the
stack enl ranee. This way each
student < in verify having com
pie'ed exactly two hours of study
for each lecture hour, feel secure
l hat he hasn't done any uncom
pensated overtime, and spare the
overpatched library budget th e
fraying it should get from "hot
rod" academians.

• VIKA
Editor, The Daily:
The author of the Daily editor
ial on Moral Re-Armament, man
aged to misunderstand some of
the points being made in the paid
•advertisement. One such point
made by the display was that we
should not allow complete free
dom to those who do not believe
in God if we do not allow it to
those who do. After misconstru
ing this point the editorial says
Moral Re-Armament is one of
v 1 hose "who proclaim one set of
standards and live another."
In another misinterpretation
the editorial accuses Moral Re-
Armament of "anti-intellectual
ism." The Daily writer believes
this is the obvious conclusion of
the display statement which says
"we are in revolt against the line
of the 'new morality' which is
forced down our throats by
books, magazines, television,
films, professors and so m e
churchmen." Moral Re-Armament
is not anti-intellectual.
The author also seemed to have
misplaced his journalistic integ
rity while writing this editorial.
It is a pretty cheap trick to com
pare anyone whose goal is to "bel
ter humanity." to quote the
Daily, to Hitler and Stalin. Equa
tion with these two men has be
come a catch-all for ihe things
some people react to.
The Gestapo made a 126-page
attack on Moral Re-Armament.
Radio Moscow says it is "a glo
bal ideology with bridgeheads in
every nation in its final stage of
total expansion throughout the
world. It has the power to cap
ture 1 radical revolutionary minds.
It is contaminating the minds of
Ihe masses, li subsitiutes for the
inevitable class war, the eternal
struggle between good and evil."
This is the same outfit the Daily
editorial referred to as "paro
chial."
On another issue, Moral Re-
Armament certainly realizes the
importance of not swallowing
meaningless phrases, but impor
tant declarations of principle
have to be made. That is why the
Daily should have done some
thinking about the declarations
in ihe display before it regurgi
tated. The Daily acted a bit like
a spoiled child who upon seeing
a new type of pudding immedi
ately hollers he does not want
any without lasting it.
The challenge before the Uni
versity students of today is to
think responsibly about what we
want our generation to accom
plish in the next ten years. Where

do we want to take the world?
The best minds, including Daily
editorialists and Wilbur fresh
men, need to work on this ques
tion and find some answers.

• I-Center Success
Editor, The Daily:
We at the I-Center wore pleased
to gather from the story on the
: Graduate Student Association in
i the Wednesday, May 6, Daily that
. the success of the Bochtel Inter
; national Student Center in i Is
first year of operation has led the
! Association to consider as one of
its eventual goals "the organiza
i tion of a graduate student center
i similar in function to the I-Cen
! ter."
Perhaps the construction of a
separate building or of an exten
sion of the Tresidder Union for
j a graduate center should be seri
ously considered. In the mean
, time however it should be known
' that from the beginning the I
j Center was thought of as a grad
uate student center, especially
since almost ninety per cent of
j Stanford's foreign students are
j graduates.
More than that, the I-Center is
I designed for the entire Stanford
j community and particularly for
, students who look for a quiet eor
; ner to think or to read, or for con
: versation about topics other than
! grades and dates. Anyone hesi-
I tant to enter "a room full of
; turbans" should know that half
i the people using the I-Center are
Americans many of them in
graduate school or at work in the
community.
i In short, the International Cen
j ter is not a special club for spe
j cial people. It seeks to serve Stan-
I ford in the same fashion and in
i many ways for the same educa
i tional and social purposes as the
; Library, the Bookstore and the
j Union. The (red) carpet is out to
all (come and research the
color!) and most particularly
to graduate students.
