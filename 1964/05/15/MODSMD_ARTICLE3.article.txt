Moro than 800 Stanford students
will raise their voices in song in
Frost Amphit heater Sunday night,
May 17, at the 23rd annual all-uni

based on the theme, "A Fable of
Spring," begins at 8:00.
This popular songfcst was ori
ginally conceived in 1941 when
Mr. Thomas Howard decided that
the Stanford Rally Committee
should have a spring project.
Howard's production was so well
received that it became an annual
evfent at the Farm.
Tin: MATCH LIGHTING cere
mony, traditionally .associated
with Spring Sing, and to be led
this year by Prince Lightfoot, was
originated in 1949. In this ritual,
the amphitheater is darkened, at
which time all present hold up a
lighted match and join in the sing
ing of the Stanford Hymn.
As in the past, judging this year
will be based on four primary con
siderations: selection, originality,
appearance, and technique in pre
sentation. Weighing the merits of
the participants will be Dean of
students, H. Donald Winbigler;
Dean of freshmen men, Dwight D.
Clark; ASSU vice president, Stevie
Aden; and Dennis de Coteau, a
student in the Graduate School of
Music.
COMPETING for this years
awards will be sixteen campus
groups, including the Medical
School, last year's sweepstakes
winner. In addition to these, the
"Mendicants," a Stanford men's
singing group, and a trio of folk
singers shall provide entertain
ment at intermission and just be
