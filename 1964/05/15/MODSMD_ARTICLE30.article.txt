# Stanford And Beyond
## The 						Cage Is Big, Roomy; But The Bars Are Iron 
### Vivian Bozman 
No more than twelve Stanford students heard a talk a little over
a week ago given l>y l oin Morgan, a student at tlie University of
Indiana charged with violating the Indiana Vnti-Communism Act
for the "crime' of attending a speech in which a Negro, in a pub
lic meeting on civil rights, advocated Negro self defense in the
face of plivsieal attack.
The significance of Morgan's speech for the student commu
ity at large is the fact that the Bloomington Case is the first case
in American history in which students have been charged witli
sedition for campus activities. Traditionally, the campus has been
the home of free debate, censured mainly by the university ad
ministration and community opinion.
Perhaps, students have been humored and allowed to advocate
minority views, because die powers-that-bc have considered stu
dents harmless.
At any rate, the indictment of Morgan and two other students,
all members of the Young Socialist Alliance, shows that freedom
on the university campus is tolerated within certain limits which
such men as Hlooniington Prosecutor Thomas Ileadley will set
when and where they see fit.
STUDENTS MAY PLAY their games; they may think they are
free â€” but, though the cage may be large and roomy, the bars are
still made of iron.
In a March trial the state Anti-Communism Act under which
the students had been charged with advocating violent overthrow
of the government (if Indiana and the United States, was declared
unconstitutional. The final decision is still in doubt, for the case
is being appealed by Ileadley to the State Supreme Court.
If the higher court rules the law is constitutional, the students
will have to face trial under the Anti-Communism Act. The charge
of advocating violent overthrow of the state and federal govern
ments will have to be based on the fact that the students attended
the civil rights meeting open to the public.
Beyond the fact ol the unprecedented indictment itself is the
atmosphere of hatred and fear created by the press and prosecu
tor's office. Unfounded charges that "Moscow trained agents" or
ganized the YSA exemplified the witch hunt to which the students
were subjected.
In "A Message to the Students and All the Citizens of Our Com
munity,' 142 faculty members at Indiana University stated, . .
It seems clear to us that the action (the YSA indictment) has not
been motivated by zeal for Jaw enforcement, but by a desire to
dictate to Indiana University that it shall not permit the use of
University facilities for the expression of ideas repugnant to the
Prosecutor."
THIS COUNTRY is a country ol laws, so those who frown on
civil disobedience by Negro civil rights groups say. But, it is men
who make, intcprct, and enforce laws. The crusade against the
Bloomington students was begun by one man who said that, once
lie finished with the* three YSA members, he was going to take on
other elements of the university community which he believed
should be eliminated.
Attacks 011 civil liberties may begin with communists, followed
by socialists, but, if men like Ileadley decide when the attacks
will stop, they may go right on down the line, even sucking in
a few moderate conservatives.
