felt that the newspaper had been *
irresponsible in its preview cover- j
age of the UCLA Spring Sing.
THE COUNCIL was critical of
a headline and story in last Fri
day's issue which warned that the
weather would be cold for the an
nual event. The censure also re
sulted from another front-page!
article promoting the USC Song
l'est, which was being held the
same night as the UCLA Spring
Sing.
Ostrov said that the council re
garded the warning about cold i
weather and the USC article as a j
deliberate attempt to sabotage the '
UCLA event.
In his editorial, Ostrov objected j
to student legislature action, tic- j
cause an Independent Communica-1
tions Board had just been estab
lished to administer the Bruin and
other campus publications.

Board had ('ensured the ISruiii
earlier this week for the article, j
but the student council did not ic- :
gard the censure as severe enough
punishment.
"In a state of blind, vengeful, j

A front-page editorial in this morning's UCLA DaiK hruin
attacks the school s student council for censuring the newspaper.

Communications Board."
"There was no effort on the part
of the student council to conduct a
complete investigation. They
jumped into the flames with an
irresistable compulsion," conti
nued Ostrov.
IN RUGAKD to the suspension
of the staff member who edited
the issue considered offensive,
Ostrov charged that ihe action
represented "a dangerous prece
dent."
''The fury-bent council consi
dered and passed judgment with
out the accused . . . being invited
to defend himself."
Ostrov claimed that the student
legislature had no power to sus
pend the staff member, because
the ASUCLA Constitution says
that only the editor-in-chief may
be removed by the student council.
In phone calls last night, Ostrov
received the Daily's endorsement
for his front-page editorial, along
with that of the University of Cali
fornia campuses at Santa Barbara
and Berkeley.
