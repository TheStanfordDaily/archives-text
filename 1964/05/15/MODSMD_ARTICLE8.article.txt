Special to tin' Daily from Our War Correspondent
The piil tor of not-so-tiny foot mixed vvilh the
thud of exploding water balloons resounded
through Roble last night as sixty Wilbur visitors
sought revenge.
This climaxed a series of springtime skirmishes
which began Tuesday night with "an elaborate
plan" of thirteen Roble coeds.
Having researched Eliot Ness' strategy, the
sweatshirted girls chose Rinconada and Junipero
as the most vulnerable spots for their water bal
loon attack A warm night would insure open win
clows. A getaway car would prevent retaliation.
So they thought.
Their plan went awry as they attacked Rincon
ada, apparently the house best versed in the art
of water ballooning
Counter attack followed in live seconds, cutting
planned escape time by twenty-five seconds and
nreeliidimr .r sanll oil Juninelo.

Wilbur's first effort netted three captives, who
were promptly dumped in the showers and doused
with shaving cream, compliments of Rinconada.
Although tree, their comrades returned, bound
by a pact to "sink or swim together." The get
away car was surrounded, and its occupants met
a similar fate.
This fifteen minute interlude make for a "good
study break."
Wilbur, insulted that anyone could oven think
of defying its fortress, attempted retaliation last
night. Although almost outnumbered by police
called to the scene, the boys made a "valiant ef
fort" before retiring. Major victims of the attack
were the sign-out cards, which were dampened
but not damaged. The balloon brigade made it a
chore to return dates to the dorm.
The defenders joined in the fun. besieging with
water the hapless attackers below.
Informed sources report that participants agree
that everyone "showed a lot of haii.'
