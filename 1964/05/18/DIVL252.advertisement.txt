What Is God's Plan
For Mankind?
A whole host of men and women today seem to think that God is on "our
side" come what may . . . that His Spirit strives to bring about peace on
earth and unity of all world religions. However, such claims are not to be
found in the Holy Bible, the inspired Word of God. It may surprise you to
learn that God considers the world lost and not getting any better. It is vitally
important that everyone be aware of what God has done in the past, is now
doing, and what He will do in the future.
After the fall of man into the present sinful state, God set in motion a
redemptive plan to undo the disastrous effects of sin. He chose one nation,
Israel, to proclaim that there was one true God to the world which then, as
now, was primarily idolatrous:
"What advantage then hath the Jew? Or what profit is there of circum
cision? Much every way: Chiefly, because that unto them were committed the
oracles of God." (Romans 3:1, 2)
It was through the Jewish nation and the earthly line of Abraham and
David that God sent His Eternal Son, Jesus Christ, into the world to accomplish
the great redemptive work of the Cross:
"... namely that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, j
not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the
Word of reconciliation." (II Cor. 5:1 9)
The Jews had rejected their Messiah and the Apostle Peter told them:
' Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested j
to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed
through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know—this man delivered up
by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross
by the hands of godless men and put Him to death. And God raised Him up
again, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him
to be held in its power . . . The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God
of our fathers, hath glorified His servant Jesus, the One whom you delivered
up, and disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release
Him. But you disowned the Holy and Righteous God and asked for a murderer
to be granted to you. Acts 2:22-24, 3:13-15.
The rejection of Jesus Christ by the Jews caused the nation of Israel to
be set aside temporarily, giving opportunity for the Gospel message of God's
grace to be spread to all the world:
The Apostle Paul, writing as led by the Holy Ghost says: "I say then, Goa
has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite,
a descendent of Benjamin. God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew.
. . . But by their transgression salvation has come to the gentiles to make
the Jews jealous . . . From the standpoint of the Gospel they are enemies for
your sakes, but from the standpoint of God's choice they are beloved for the
sake of the fathers; for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocably For just
as you once were disobedient to God but now have been shown mercy because
of their basic disobedience, so these also now have been disobedient in order
that because of mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy. For
God has shut up all in disobedience that He might show mercy to all. Oh the
depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearch
able are His judgments and unfathomable His ways. (Rom. 1 1:1-2, 11, 28-33)
What is God doing in the world today? With the nation Israel now tem
porarily set aside, God is dealing with another group of chosen people: the
Church (Greek: Ecdesia—called out). He is adding to and building up His true
Church, the ' Bride of Christ," which is not bounded by walls, limited by de
nominational differences, or divided by theology. All those who know Jesus
Christ personally are members of His church, which is His body, a living spiritual
building:
' You also as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a
holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus
Christ. For this is contained in Scripture: Behold I lay in Zion a choice stone, a
precious cornerstone, and he who believes in Him (Christ) shall not be dis
appointed. This precious value, then, is for you who believes, but for those
who disbelieve, the stone which the builders rejected, this became the very
cornerstone, and, a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, for they stumble
because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also
appointed. But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people
for God's own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who
has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; for you once were
not a people, but now you are the Deople of God; you had not received mercy,
but now you have received mercy. (I Peter 2:3-10 NASV)
What of the future?
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a
witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come." (Matthew 24:14).
At the appointed time when the Church is completed, the wrath of God will
be poured out upon an unbelieving and idolatrous world. This period which
will last 7 years is called in the Bible the Tribulation. At the end of this terrible
time Jesus Christ will return to Earth to rule the nations from Jerusalem in peace
and righteousness.
It's all in the Bible—what God has done and what He plans to do. Read
the record which demonstrates conclusively man s failures and God's faithful
ness. And don't fail to meet the author of this grand plan of salvation. He
can bo known in a personal way through Jesus Christ as Redeemer and lord
Rejoice with us at the greatness of Almighty God.
