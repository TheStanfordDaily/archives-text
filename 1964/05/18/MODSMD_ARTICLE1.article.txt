VIENTIANE, Laos Premier Souvanna Phouma said yesterday j
that Communist forces have launched a large-scale attack on neu- I
11-alist positions in the strategic Plaine des Jarres region in north-j
s central Laos.
The International Control Commission, set up by the 1902 Geneva j
accords to supervise Laos' beleaguered neutrality, underlined the |
gravity of the situation by hastily evacuating its observer team from '
the area.
A Canadian observer said the situation at Gen. Kong Le's head
quarters at Muong Phanh, 100 miles northeast of Vientiane, was
"pretty hot" and that the neutralist troop commander was no longer
' at that village. He declined to give Kong Le's whereabouts or com
ment further pending a report to Souvanna and commission officials
here.
Military sources said the Reds were shelling Kong Le's command
post and that Pathet Lao troops had advanced to within 500 yards
of his headquarters. They said fighting was heavy.

youth brought to East Berlin for a huge rally. They said Red police
moved in with nightsticks drawn to break up the rows.
Unruly crowds gathered in scat tered districts of Plast Berlin j
after the breakup of a big march by hundreds of thousands of young !
11 people staged as a massive propaganda display.

main street.

• IJiJ Eliminates Federal Jolts
WASHINGTON Under the prodding of President Johnson gov
ernment departments and agencies again have lowered their person
nel ceilings.
The White House said a second round of personnel reductions
will cut an additional 8,665 .jobs by the end of the year. Johnson an- i
nounced on March J) that personnel ceilings would be cut 6,."326 by the
end of 1964.
The White House said reductions in Interior and Agriculture re
sulted largely from a recent directive by Johnson to hold down the
usual seasonal spring employment increases. These increases result !
largely from the hiring of college students for summer jobs.
• I tali Teachers To Consider Strike
WASHINGTON If Utah teachers decide to boycott their class- !
rooms next fall and it's a good bet right now they will other
teacher rebellions may be expected to break out like a rash across
the country.
It is a good bet also that the 900,000-member National Education
Association will support tin 1 Utah teachers with money, manpower,
and a request that no member teacher take a job in Utah.
Utah teachers have not yet signed contracts for the 1964-65 school
year, although this normally is done much earlier in the year.
They are expected to decide at a mass meeting in Salt Lake City
tomorrow whether to sit the next school year out if Gov. George D.
Clyde continues to refuse their demands for more state aid to educa
tion.
