## 
### 
Job offers to Stanford engineer
ing graduates in 1964 seem few
er but fatter, according to th e
latest (May 1964) issue of Stan
ford Engineering News.
Though the scoring isn't over,
the University's Placement Serv
ices report that engineering mas
ter degree holders are getting
$625 to $900 a month to start. The
average offer to masters wavers
around $750, with Ph.D.'s being
offered about $.300 a month more.
Bachelor degrees are worth

about $100 less than masters, but
four out of five engineering sen
iors plan to continue into gradu
ate studies. A few have even been
attracted to the Peace Corps.
The average value of job offers
!to Stanford engineering gradu
| atcs is well above the national
I figure, adds the News.
"THE NUMBER of offers on
i which this year's data are based
is drastically reduced from last
year," says the publication.
; "There seems to he a sharp reduc
tion in demand for below-average
or not-so-well-qualified graduates.
"This seems to be a reflection
of economic trends, particularly
; in California, based on real or
projected Department of Defense
cutbacks. Partly as a result, more
graduating students are inter
ested in non-defense firms, large
and multi-product industries, gov
ernment, and even teaching."
TIIE NUMBER of firms recruit
ing graduate engineers at Stan
i ford this year is about the same
j or slightly higher than last year.
: Employers are showing stronger
j interest in the applied, economic,
| and practical aspects of engineer
ing. There is a continuing de
mand for experienced engineers
willing to assume project or pro
duction responsibilities.
