# Santa Clara Defeats Indian Nine Twice As Both Clubs Close Out CIBA Season
## 
### PETE KING 
The 1%! collegiate baseball
season ended on a dislinct note
of familiarity for what few fol
lowers of Stanford baseball that
there are. Inconsistent pitching
and consistently lousy hitting,
which have plagued the Indians
all year, resulted in two losses,
10-2 and 3-0, to Santa Clara over
the weekend.
Long-suffering fans may have
guessed that they were seeing
precedents set. The Tribe's over-

all 18-22 record was its first los
ing season in 18 years, and its
4 16 CIBA mark for last place
has been surpassed in recent his
tory only by the 1-10 record of
(ho 1912 squad.
NEEDLESS to say, il was also
Coach Dutch Fehring's first los
ing season in his nine years here.
On Friday at Santa Clara,
everything went wrong as Stan
ford batters collected only four
hits, two of them doubles by Jim
Hibbs, and allowed 13 in return.
The Indians were at the mercy

of Bronco hurler Pete Magrini,
who fanned 11 and walked only
(wo. Magrini ran his season rec
ord to 11-1.
Stanford scored its only two
runs in ihe fourth inning. First
baseman Bob Cox drew a base on
balls, one of the two Magrini
rendered all afternoon, and was
driven in by one of Hibbs'
doubles.
HIBBS HIMSELF came around
to score when George Thacher
slapped a ground ball to 1 hird
baseman Mike Cullen, who fielded
it cleanly but fired a hurried
throw into left field.
On Saturday, back at the
Farm, the pitching was vastly
better, but the hitting was worse.
John Mason, a "late season"
pitcher, who has hurled several
excellent ball games of late, gave
Santa Clara only seven hits, strik
ing out five and walking four in
his eight-inning stretch.
On most other days hew o u I d
have won. He fell behind in t he
first, 1-0, on two Bronco singles.
Hungry for a win, Mason got one

of the Indians' two hits in the
third inning after Boh Hollmann
reached first on an error and Jim
Seckler looked al a third strike.
Then, outfielder Cliff Harris
struck out and Bob Cox walked,
loading the bases. Mason, perched
on second base, watched his hopes
die as .370 hitter Hibbs lofted a
foul fly to right for the final out.
TWO ERRORS in the fifth, one
on a grounder by shortstop Gary
Smith and one on a wild pick-off
throw by Seckler, allowed the sec
ond Santa Clara run. A walk, a
passed ball, and a double by Tom
Brogan in the ninth ended the
Bronco scoring.
Pitcher Larry Loughlin picked
up his eighth CIBA win while
fanning seven and walking three,
equalling the modern conference
record for victories. His ERA
ended at an amazing 1.37.
Mason put the clamps on Char
lie Marcenaro, third in I he league
in hitting. Marcenaro flied three
times (one of them was dropped)
and grounded out.
Santa Clara finished with a 16-4
CIBA mark, one game behind de
fending champion USC. Overall,
the Broncos were 28-8.

In tennis, Dennis Kalslon
easily defeated Arthur Ashe
6-3, 6-2 to win the AAWTJ
singles championship at (lie
Stanford Courts Saturday. The
women's singles competition
sow Janie Albert upset Julie
Heldman, 6-2, 6-1, while in the
doubles Kalston and Bill Bond
teamed up to whip Ashe and
Charles l'assarell, 4-6, 6 3, 6-2.
The 1%! collegiate baseball
season ended on a dislinct note
of familiarity for what few fol
lowers of Stanford baseball that
there are. Inconsistent pitching
and consistently lousy hitting,
which have plagued the Indians
all year, resulted in two losses,
10-2 and 3-0, to Santa Clara over
the weekend.
Long-suffering fans may have
guessed that they were seeing
precedents set. The Tribe's over-

all 18-22 record was its first los
ing season in 18 years, and its
4 16 CIBA mark for last place
has been surpassed in recent his
tory only by the 1-10 record of
(ho 1912 squad.
NEEDLESS to say, il was also
Coach Dutch Fehring's first los
ing season in his nine years here.
On Friday at Santa Clara,
everything went wrong as Stan
ford batters collected only four
hits, two of them doubles by Jim
Hibbs, and allowed 13 in return.
The Indians were at the mercy

of Bronco hurler Pete Magrini,
who fanned 11 and walked only
(wo. Magrini ran his season rec
ord to 11-1.
Stanford scored its only two
runs in ihe fourth inning. First
baseman Bob Cox drew a base on
balls, one of the two Magrini
rendered all afternoon, and was
driven in by one of Hibbs'
doubles.
HIBBS HIMSELF came around
to score when George Thacher
slapped a ground ball to 1 hird
baseman Mike Cullen, who fielded
it cleanly but fired a hurried
throw into left field.
On Saturday, back at the
Farm, the pitching was vastly
better, but the hitting was worse.
John Mason, a "late season"
pitcher, who has hurled several
excellent ball games of late, gave
Santa Clara only seven hits, strik
ing out five and walking four in
his eight-inning stretch.
On most other days hew o u I d
have won. He fell behind in t he
first, 1-0, on two Bronco singles.
Hungry for a win, Mason got one

of the Indians' two hits in the
third inning after Boh Hollmann
reached first on an error and Jim
Seckler looked al a third strike.
Then, outfielder Cliff Harris
struck out and Bob Cox walked,
loading the bases. Mason, perched
on second base, watched his hopes
die as .370 hitter Hibbs lofted a
foul fly to right for the final out.
TWO ERRORS in the fifth, one
on a grounder by shortstop Gary
Smith and one on a wild pick-off
throw by Seckler, allowed the sec
ond Santa Clara run. A walk, a
passed ball, and a double by Tom
Brogan in the ninth ended the
Bronco scoring.
Pitcher Larry Loughlin picked
up his eighth CIBA win while
fanning seven and walking three,
equalling the modern conference
record for victories. His ERA
ended at an amazing 1.37.
Mason put the clamps on Char
lie Marcenaro, third in I he league
in hitting. Marcenaro flied three
times (one of them was dropped)
and grounded out.
Santa Clara finished with a 16-4
CIBA mark, one game behind de
fending champion USC. Overall,
the Broncos were 28-8.

The 1%! collegiate baseball
season ended on a dislinct note
of familiarity for what few fol
lowers of Stanford baseball that
there are. Inconsistent pitching
and consistently lousy hitting,
which have plagued the Indians
all year, resulted in two losses,
10-2 and 3-0, to Santa Clara over
the weekend.
Long-suffering fans may have
guessed that they were seeing
precedents set. The Tribe's over-

all 18-22 record was its first los
ing season in 18 years, and its
4 16 CIBA mark for last place
has been surpassed in recent his
tory only by the 1-10 record of
(ho 1912 squad.
NEEDLESS to say, il was also
Coach Dutch Fehring's first los
ing season in his nine years here.
On Friday at Santa Clara,
everything went wrong as Stan
ford batters collected only four
hits, two of them doubles by Jim
Hibbs, and allowed 13 in return.
The Indians were at the mercy

of Bronco hurler Pete Magrini,
who fanned 11 and walked only
(wo. Magrini ran his season rec
ord to 11-1.
Stanford scored its only two
runs in ihe fourth inning. First
baseman Bob Cox drew a base on
balls, one of the two Magrini
rendered all afternoon, and was
driven in by one of Hibbs'
doubles.
HIBBS HIMSELF came around
to score when George Thacher
slapped a ground ball to 1 hird
baseman Mike Cullen, who fielded
it cleanly but fired a hurried
throw into left field.
On Saturday, back at the
Farm, the pitching was vastly
better, but the hitting was worse.
John Mason, a "late season"
pitcher, who has hurled several
excellent ball games of late, gave
Santa Clara only seven hits, strik
ing out five and walking four in
his eight-inning stretch.
On most other days hew o u I d
have won. He fell behind in t he
first, 1-0, on two Bronco singles.
Hungry for a win, Mason got one

of the Indians' two hits in the
third inning after Boh Hollmann
reached first on an error and Jim
Seckler looked al a third strike.
Then, outfielder Cliff Harris
struck out and Bob Cox walked,
loading the bases. Mason, perched
on second base, watched his hopes
die as .370 hitter Hibbs lofted a
foul fly to right for the final out.
TWO ERRORS in the fifth, one
on a grounder by shortstop Gary
Smith and one on a wild pick-off
throw by Seckler, allowed the sec
ond Santa Clara run. A walk, a
passed ball, and a double by Tom
Brogan in the ninth ended the
Bronco scoring.
Pitcher Larry Loughlin picked
up his eighth CIBA win while
fanning seven and walking three,
equalling the modern conference
record for victories. His ERA
ended at an amazing 1.37.
Mason put the clamps on Char
lie Marcenaro, third in I he league
in hitting. Marcenaro flied three
times (one of them was dropped)
and grounded out.
Santa Clara finished with a 16-4
CIBA mark, one game behind de
fending champion USC. Overall,
the Broncos were 28-8.
