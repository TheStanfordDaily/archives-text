## Scranton Gives GOP Positivism 
### STEPHEN SHEFLER 
The need for a positive Repub- i
liean platform is clearly seen in
light of the negativism of the j
Landon, Taft, Goldwater school :
of the past three decades.
"For 30 years the Republican >
Party has made life easy for its I
opposition. For 30 years it has
managed to look negative. For
30 years. Republicans have tele
graphed every punch they have
thrown. All of that can change.
Republicans can form a new
coalition with themselves."
This is the description of the

crossroads that j
t h o Ropulican ;
Party faces, by j
the man who is
offering a posi
tive answer, Wil
liam Warren
Scran ton.

answer would be the rejuvena
tion of the federal system of gov
ernment. While some individuals
state that federalism should be
discarded due to its inefficiency.
Governor Scranton has refuted j
this, showing at times it can be ;
more efficient both financially i
and what is more important in i
human terms.

BEFORE WE discard the small
Republic theory elucidated by
R ousse a u, Montesquieu, a n d
Hume, we should realize its im
portance in adding a human pro
portion to the state, rather than
reducing man to a cog in a well
oiled machine.
Indeed the exigencies of mod
ern times call for a new set, a
federal-state relationship in or
der for the system to work effec
tively Governor Scranton off
ered such a proposal in a speech
prepared for delivery at Yale
University Law School where lie
received this year's Law School
Association Citation of Merit
award:
"How much better it would be
if the Republican Party would
implement a legislative program
that recognized that though the
Federal Government has the tax
resources, the state governments
are often far more capable of
using the money efficiently and
effectively."
"The Republican Party, as a
matter of national policy, ought
to embrace a program whereby
the Federal Congress would out
line in broad terms a national
goal in meeting the national do
mestic problem, appropriate the
money to meet it, but give maxi
mum authority for implementa
tion to strong effective state gov
ernment."
"Such a policy, I am convinced,
could be the first step toward
waging a new political change. It
would give the Republican Party
its best chance of regaining a
political majority because: (1 »
of its potential of solving a prob
lem without handing over exces
sive authority to the central gov- :
ernment; (2> it would give the
Republican Party a positive ap
proach; (3) such an approach is
a practical way of getting this
country moving."
In enunciating this political
philosophy we must make it clear
what delineation there is between
national needs that can be met
through the implementation of
state goverments and those which
are clearly most effectively ac
complished by the Federal Gov
ernment."

THE SCRANTON philosophy
is not negative. Unlike Barry
Goldwater, he does not use Fed
eralism as an excuse for doing
nothing, but feels it is a positive
solution.
His stand on Civil Rights clearly
illustrates his belief for a co
operative federal-state poli c y:
"This (civil rights), is a joint
problem for the states and the
federal government. The reluc- j
tance, indeed the refusal of some
states to recognize the rights of,
minorities makes it mandatory!
for Washington to step in. The
time is past when the matter of
racial inequality can be hidden
behind the screen of state's i
rights."
This is the Scranton answer, i
certainly it is a refreshing hope
for a positive Republican p I a t
form that "can meet the basic
govrniment.il challenge for tile
remainder "• the century."
