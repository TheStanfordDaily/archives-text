## Censorship Legislation Gags South Africa's English Press 
### Helen Benjamin 
How "free" is the press in South
! Africa today?
There is no doubt that the in
fluential English Press still re
mains critical of the Govern
ment's Apartheid policies, but its
voice is growing weaker and,
along with the remaining inde
pendent papers, may eventually
be silenced.
A forecast of eventual acquies
cence or gagging is based: 1) on
the trend of censorship legisla
tion since the Nationalists came
to power in 1948 culminating in
the Publications and Entertain
ment Act of 1963 and increasing
Nationalist pressures accompany
ing this trend; and 2) on the stra
tegy of big business interests to
attract foreign capital, in part by
affecting a show of solidarity in
the white community.
THERE ARE at least nine laws
in South Africa limiting freedom
of the press; of these, eight were
passed since the Nationalists
came to power, and at least seven
are politically oriented.
The Riotous Assemblies Act
(1936i empowers the Governor-
General to prohibit publication
of "documentary information"
which is in his opinion "calcu
lated to engender feelings of hos
tility between the European in
habitants of the Union on the
one hand and any other section
of the inhabitants of the Union
on the other hand."
Both the Criminal Law Amend
ment Act (1953) and the Suppres
sion of Communism Act (1950)
severely limit the right to pub
licly advocate changes in the
status quo. The Prison Act (1959)
attempts to suppress pictures or
stories of the often brutal treat
ment of prisoners in South
Africa's jails.
Mr. Donald B. Molteno, a mem
ber of the Cape Bar, says of this
legislation en toto that it creates
"offenses committed by the spok
en word of so vague a nature that
it is well nigh impossible for the
individual to judge whether he is
infringing the law or not."
Freedom of speech and of the
press is further threatened, he
contends, "by equipping the ex
ecutive with administrative pow
ers to banish, confine and other
wise penalize individuals and to
suppress publications on equally
vague grounds."
The editor of the Johannesburg'
Star once remarked that "editing
a newspaper under these condi
tions is like walking blindfold
through a minefield."
Under the banners of trust
busting and responsible press, the
government established an in
vestigating committee, the Press
Commission, in 1950 to look into
among other things "accuracy in
the presentation of the news:
tendencies towards monopoly . . .
and its effects on editorial opin
ion and comment and presenta
tion of news; existing restraints
on the establishment of new news
papers in South Africa and the
desirability or otherwise thereof;
and the adequacy or otherwise
of existing means of self-control
and discipline by the Press over
its editors, journalists and cor
respondents.
By 1960 the long-overdue report 1
of the Press Commission had not j
yet boon made, but the report it i
self might have proved an anti
climax to the Commission's activi-!
ties.
The threat implicit in such a

body's sheer existence was cer- j
tainly one of the factors influenc- j
ing the Newspaper Press Union, I
an association of the Republic's j
big papers, to adopt in early 1962
a Code of Conduct and a volun-!
tary Board of Reference. It is
worth noting that these voluntary
measures were opposed by the
South African Society of Journa- j
lists as being neither voluntary
nor statutory and that the Code |
itself contained "sinister implica
tions of a curb on political com-;
ment."
By imposing censorship on it
self. however, members of t li e
N.P.U. were exempted from ihe
provisions of the Publications and
Entertainment Act which do ap
ply to the smaller independent,
and usually more democratic
papers.
Will the Nationalists be satis
fied to stop here? Only, I con
tend, to the extent that they gain
control over the smaller papers
and the cooperation of the larger.
With the combined circulation
of the anti-government English
language papers running to four
times that of the pro-government
Afrikaans, and with their influ
ence abroad, the English Press
have proved the most vocal and
lasting critics of Apartheid poli
cies, and the most embarrassing
to the government.
For example, during the bus
boycott campaign of 1957, Mr. j
Swart, the Minister of Justice, ;
charged that the English-lan-;
guage papers were publishing pic-;
tures of policemen beating up j
; Africans "in a deliberate attempt |
â€¢ to stir up the non-Whites against i
| the police."
The same situation provoked a
Nationalist M.P., Mr. J. C. Grey
ling, to declare: "No Press in
j South Africa has ever acted more
j recklessly and irresponsibly . . .
! Supposing we could get the Eng- (
1 lish Press to keep silent for four
months in South Africa, we would
have a different South Africa."
ACCUSED BY the Afrikaans
Press of "angling for control of
the powerful Argus group of Eng
lish paper'," mining magnate
Harry Oppenheimer replied:
"This is only part of a long and
sinister campaign which the Na
tional Party has been conducting
to create an atmosphere in which
it can carry through its plans to
muzzle the free Press in South
Africa."
It may prove ironic that Mr.
Oppenheimer was instrumental in
establishing the South Africa
Foundation, a n organization
whose purpose is "the promotion
of international understanding of
the South African way of life,
achievements and aspirations"
and "positive campaigns which
shall present to the world at
large the true picture of South
Africa."
The Foundation's sponsors in
clude controllers of the most pow
erful English papers. This judici
ous effort to win friends and in
fluence people abroad has already
paid handsome dividends.
American investment alone
amounts to over half a billion dol
lars and is increasing. General
Motors, Ford. Firestone and Good
year announced expansions in
j their South African operations
j last year amounting to more than
$."50 million, and the profits are
! fantastic.
The consequences for the Press j
remain lo be seen.

How "free" is the press in South
! Africa today?
There is no doubt that the in
fluential English Press still re
mains critical of the Govern
ment's Apartheid policies, but its
voice is growing weaker and,
along with the remaining inde
pendent papers, may eventually
be silenced.
A forecast of eventual acquies
cence or gagging is based: 1) on
the trend of censorship legisla
tion since the Nationalists came
to power in 1948 culminating in
the Publications and Entertain
ment Act of 1963 and increasing
Nationalist pressures accompany
ing this trend; and 2) on the stra
tegy of big business interests to
attract foreign capital, in part by
affecting a show of solidarity in
the white community.
THERE ARE at least nine laws
in South Africa limiting freedom
of the press; of these, eight were
passed since the Nationalists
came to power, and at least seven
are politically oriented.
The Riotous Assemblies Act
(1936i empowers the Governor-
General to prohibit publication
of "documentary information"
which is in his opinion "calcu
lated to engender feelings of hos
tility between the European in
habitants of the Union on the
one hand and any other section
of the inhabitants of the Union
on the other hand."
Both the Criminal Law Amend
ment Act (1953) and the Suppres
sion of Communism Act (1950)
severely limit the right to pub
licly advocate changes in the
status quo. The Prison Act (1959)
attempts to suppress pictures or
stories of the often brutal treat
ment of prisoners in South
Africa's jails.
Mr. Donald B. Molteno, a mem
ber of the Cape Bar, says of this
legislation en toto that it creates
"offenses committed by the spok
en word of so vague a nature that
it is well nigh impossible for the
individual to judge whether he is
infringing the law or not."
Freedom of speech and of the
press is further threatened, he
contends, "by equipping the ex
ecutive with administrative pow
ers to banish, confine and other
wise penalize individuals and to
suppress publications on equally
vague grounds."
The editor of the Johannesburg'
Star once remarked that "editing
a newspaper under these condi
tions is like walking blindfold
through a minefield."
Under the banners of trust
busting and responsible press, the
government established an in
vestigating committee, the Press
Commission, in 1950 to look into
among other things "accuracy in
the presentation of the news:
tendencies towards monopoly . . .
and its effects on editorial opin
ion and comment and presenta
tion of news; existing restraints
on the establishment of new news
papers in South Africa and the
desirability or otherwise thereof;
and the adequacy or otherwise
of existing means of self-control
and discipline by the Press over
its editors, journalists and cor
respondents.
By 1960 the long-overdue report 1
of the Press Commission had not j
yet boon made, but the report it i
self might have proved an anti
climax to the Commission's activi-!
ties.
The threat implicit in such a

body's sheer existence was cer- j
tainly one of the factors influenc- j
ing the Newspaper Press Union, I
an association of the Republic's j
big papers, to adopt in early 1962
a Code of Conduct and a volun-!
tary Board of Reference. It is
worth noting that these voluntary
measures were opposed by the
South African Society of Journa- j
lists as being neither voluntary
nor statutory and that the Code |
itself contained "sinister implica
tions of a curb on political com-;
ment."
By imposing censorship on it
self. however, members of t li e
N.P.U. were exempted from ihe
provisions of the Publications and
Entertainment Act which do ap
ply to the smaller independent,
and usually more democratic
papers.
Will the Nationalists be satis
fied to stop here? Only, I con
tend, to the extent that they gain
control over the smaller papers
and the cooperation of the larger.
With the combined circulation
of the anti-government English
language papers running to four
times that of the pro-government
Afrikaans, and with their influ
ence abroad, the English Press
have proved the most vocal and
lasting critics of Apartheid poli
cies, and the most embarrassing
to the government.
For example, during the bus
boycott campaign of 1957, Mr. j
Swart, the Minister of Justice, ;
charged that the English-lan-;
guage papers were publishing pic-;
tures of policemen beating up j
; Africans "in a deliberate attempt |
â€¢ to stir up the non-Whites against i
| the police."
The same situation provoked a
Nationalist M.P., Mr. J. C. Grey
ling, to declare: "No Press in
j South Africa has ever acted more
j recklessly and irresponsibly . . .
! Supposing we could get the Eng- (
1 lish Press to keep silent for four
months in South Africa, we would
have a different South Africa."
ACCUSED BY the Afrikaans
Press of "angling for control of
the powerful Argus group of Eng
lish paper'," mining magnate
Harry Oppenheimer replied:
"This is only part of a long and
sinister campaign which the Na
tional Party has been conducting
to create an atmosphere in which
it can carry through its plans to
muzzle the free Press in South
Africa."
It may prove ironic that Mr.
Oppenheimer was instrumental in
establishing the South Africa
Foundation, a n organization
whose purpose is "the promotion
of international understanding of
the South African way of life,
achievements and aspirations"
and "positive campaigns which
shall present to the world at
large the true picture of South
Africa."
The Foundation's sponsors in
clude controllers of the most pow
erful English papers. This judici
ous effort to win friends and in
fluence people abroad has already
paid handsome dividends.
American investment alone
amounts to over half a billion dol
lars and is increasing. General
Motors, Ford. Firestone and Good

j their South African operations
j last year amounting to more than
$."50 million, and the profits are

How "free" is the press in South
! Africa today?
There is no doubt that the in
fluential English Press still re
mains critical of the Govern
ment's Apartheid policies, but its
voice is growing weaker and,
along with the remaining inde
pendent papers, may eventually
be silenced.
A forecast of eventual acquies
cence or gagging is based: 1) on
the trend of censorship legisla
tion since the Nationalists came
to power in 1948 culminating in
the Publications and Entertain
ment Act of 1963 and increasing
Nationalist pressures accompany
ing this trend; and 2) on the stra
tegy of big business interests to
attract foreign capital, in part by
affecting a show of solidarity in
the white community.
THERE ARE at least nine laws
in South Africa limiting freedom
of the press; of these, eight were
passed since the Nationalists
came to power, and at least seven
are politically oriented.
The Riotous Assemblies Act
(1936i empowers the Governor-
General to prohibit publication
of "documentary information"
which is in his opinion "calcu
lated to engender feelings of hos
tility between the European in
habitants of the Union on the
one hand and any other section
of the inhabitants of the Union
on the other hand."
Both the Criminal Law Amend
ment Act (1953) and the Suppres
sion of Communism Act (1950)
severely limit the right to pub
licly advocate changes in the
status quo. The Prison Act (1959)
attempts to suppress pictures or
stories of the often brutal treat
ment of prisoners in South
Africa's jails.
Mr. Donald B. Molteno, a mem
ber of the Cape Bar, says of this
legislation en toto that it creates
"offenses committed by the spok
en word of so vague a nature that
it is well nigh impossible for the
individual to judge whether he is
infringing the law or not."
Freedom of speech and of the
press is further threatened, he
contends, "by equipping the ex
ecutive with administrative pow
ers to banish, confine and other
wise penalize individuals and to
suppress publications on equally
vague grounds."
The editor of the Johannesburg'
Star once remarked that "editing
a newspaper under these condi
tions is like walking blindfold
through a minefield."
Under the banners of trust
busting and responsible press, the
government established an in
vestigating committee, the Press
Commission, in 1950 to look into
among other things "accuracy in
the presentation of the news:
tendencies towards monopoly . . .
and its effects on editorial opin
ion and comment and presenta
tion of news; existing restraints
on the establishment of new news
papers in South Africa and the
desirability or otherwise thereof;
and the adequacy or otherwise
of existing means of self-control
and discipline by the Press over
its editors, journalists and cor
respondents.
By 1960 the long-overdue report 1
of the Press Commission had not j
yet boon made, but the report it i
self might have proved an anti
climax to the Commission's activi-!
ties.
The threat implicit in such a

body's sheer existence was cer- j
tainly one of the factors influenc- j
ing the Newspaper Press Union, I
an association of the Republic's j
big papers, to adopt in early 1962
a Code of Conduct and a volun-!
tary Board of Reference. It is
worth noting that these voluntary
measures were opposed by the
South African Society of Journa- j
lists as being neither voluntary
nor statutory and that the Code |
itself contained "sinister implica
tions of a curb on political com-;
ment."
By imposing censorship on it
self. however, members of t li e
N.P.U. were exempted from ihe
provisions of the Publications and
Entertainment Act which do ap
ply to the smaller independent,
and usually more democratic
papers.
Will the Nationalists be satis
fied to stop here? Only, I con
tend, to the extent that they gain
control over the smaller papers
and the cooperation of the larger.
With the combined circulation
of the anti-government English
language papers running to four
times that of the pro-government
Afrikaans, and with their influ
ence abroad, the English Press
have proved the most vocal and
lasting critics of Apartheid poli
cies, and the most embarrassing
to the government.
For example, during the bus
boycott campaign of 1957, Mr. j
Swart, the Minister of Justice, ;
charged that the English-lan-;
guage papers were publishing pic-;
tures of policemen beating up j
; Africans "in a deliberate attempt |
â€¢ to stir up the non-Whites against i
| the police."
The same situation provoked a
Nationalist M.P., Mr. J. C. Grey
ling, to declare: "No Press in
j South Africa has ever acted more
j recklessly and irresponsibly . . .
! Supposing we could get the Eng- (
1 lish Press to keep silent for four
months in South Africa, we would
have a different South Africa."
ACCUSED BY the Afrikaans
Press of "angling for control of
the powerful Argus group of Eng
lish paper'," mining magnate
Harry Oppenheimer replied:
"This is only part of a long and
sinister campaign which the Na
tional Party has been conducting
to create an atmosphere in which
it can carry through its plans to
muzzle the free Press in South
Africa."
It may prove ironic that Mr.
Oppenheimer was instrumental in
establishing the South Africa
Foundation, a n organization
whose purpose is "the promotion
of international understanding of
the South African way of life,
achievements and aspirations"
and "positive campaigns which
shall present to the world at
large the true picture of South
Africa."
The Foundation's sponsors in
clude controllers of the most pow
erful English papers. This judici
ous effort to win friends and in
fluence people abroad has already
paid handsome dividends.
American investment alone
amounts to over half a billion dol
lars and is increasing. General
