## GOP Unity Even With Goldwater? 
### JOHN E. BONINE 
One of (ho most important de
velopments in the Republican
Presidential race last week w a s
the declaration by President
Eisenhower that he would have
no part in any pre-convention
skirmishing between the various
candidates.
The Eisenhower statement was j
widely interpreted as a boost for
Senator Goldwater, for backers
of the other candidates had been
hoping Ike would lend his pres
tige to a "stop-Goldwater" move.
Instead, he said that his job

would be unity
ins 'ho parly,
| both now and
: after the convcn-
I tion.
Party unit y
! does not soem to
!be foremost in
i the minds of a

j number of Republicans. Indeed, j
I some prominent "liberal" Repub-1
j lieans have indicated recently ;
! that Ihey may bolt the national 1
i GOP ticket if Goldwater is nomi- j
i nated.
Party unity is a willingness of
! party members to back the choice
I of the party consensus as ex
j pressed at the nominating c on-1
I ventions even if he be not their i
j first preference.
In 1952, Robert Taft got behind i
| General Eisenhower, just as had
) defeated candidates before him.
| In 1960, Governor Rockefeller and
| Senator Goldwater both backed
j Richard Nixon. The Democrats,
: except in 1918. have shown an
amazing resiliency also, best ex
emplified by Lyndon Johnson's
, consent to run on the same ticket
! as John F. Kennedy.
! The Wall Street Journal re
| cently analyzed the present Re
(publican situation and the
charges 1 hat Goldwater was!
wrecking the party:
"But it is fair to ask who is |
wrecking what. The choice of the :
convention, if he |Goldwater J is!
it. or those who refuse to support :
the convention's choice? As Gold
water himself put it the other eve
ning, loyalty to faction cannot
supercede loyalty to party, at
least if the party is to survive. A
better way to guarantee electoral
defeat is hard to imagine. . . .
"Actually, political realities be
ing what they are, reconciliation
need not be all that difficult. A j
Presidential candidate will almost j
always be willing to make com-l
promises with other factions in
his party. In the same way, if the
candidate becomes President, he j
knows he has to adjust; he can
not do all Ihe things he might
think theoretically desirable to
; do. . . .
; "[Senator Goldwater'sJ prin
; eiples include emphasis on in
| dividual dignity and freedom and
j action instead of Federal pater
; nalism; local, state or regional
| handling of all problems that can
best be so handled; establishment ;
of priorities in Government pro
grams. putting needs against re
sources. . . .
"Why that political philosophy,
especially in view of the wide lee
way it provides for specific pol
icy-making, should be unaccept
able to any Republican is not easy
to understand. If it is unaccept
able. then il can be asked why
there should be a Republican
Party at all; the country may as
well settle for a a one-party pater
nalistic state.
"And to avoid that, of course,
is what Goldwater is trying to do:
To show that the GOP, at any
rate in its origins in Lincoln, is
a party of limited Government
and regard for the individual, and
hence constitutes an alternative
to the Democrats. He is trying to
state its essence."
One of the defeated candidates
at the February convention of
the California Young Republi
cans summed up party unity this
way:
"Party unity is built by those
who lose. We can only have party
unity if those who lose get behind
those who win."
To those concerned with the
future of the Republican pa rt y
and of the two-party system, the
decision to back the nominee
even if lie he Harry Goldwater
should not be difficult.
