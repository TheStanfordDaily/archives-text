# TOUGALOO GETS AID
## Brown University To Play 'Big Brother' 
### 
(Associated Press) — Brown
University is about to play a "Big
Brother" role to tiny Touglaoo
College, just outside Jackson,
Miss.
In a joint announcement Sun
day, the Ivy League school a n d
the predominantly Negro college
disclosed a program tu improve
education at Tougaloo.
Most of Tougaloo's 520 students
are Negroes. The college has a
few white students, and about
half of the faculty members are
white. Brown has an enrollment
of about 4,000.
Dr. Buna by C. Keeney, Brown
president, and A. D. Bittle, Tou
galoo president, said the program
is being backed virtually by two
grants totalling $245,000 from the
fund for the Advancement of
Education, an organization estab

lished by the Ford Foundation.
Five other foundations and one
individual have made additional
pledges of $118,000, and officials
are seeking more support else
where.
Keeney said Tougaloo was se
lected because of "its unique posi
tion as the only voluntarily into
grated liberal arts institution in
the State of Mississippi, its com
mitment to the highest ideals of
academic freedom, its realistic
recognition of the problems that
confront Negro students, and its
willingness to experiment."
