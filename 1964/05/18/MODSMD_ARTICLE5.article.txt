# Student Editor Attacks 'The Boss' in Oakland, Michigan Squabble
## 
### 
The recently fired editor of the
Oakland University student news
paper Wednesday leveled further
charges at the man who dismissed
him.
Wolf Metzger, fired from hi s j
i post last Monday, asserted that !
i Oakland Chancellor Durward B. '
: Vainer:
II A I) SUCCESSFULLY re
quested that the Observer give its
printing business to a printing
concern partly owned by a trus
tee of Michigan State University,
Oakland's parent institution, des
pite the fact that this printer was
more expensive.
—Was willing to take "any
steps necessary" to reverse Oak
land's declining enrollment, and
j that the Chancellor's dismissal ac
tion was partly based on the
| fear that I lie survey's publication
would deter potential students

from enrolling there.
Had "trumped up" enrollment
i figures in making budget repre
sentations to the state legislature
by listing part-time night stu
j dents as full-time students.
—HAD BANNED the fired edi
tor from using mimeographing
! facilities normally open to stu
dents. Met/.ger went off campus
| to publish an "open letter" pro
testing the chancellor's action,
j The controversy centers on two
Observer articles, the first of
which never saw print and the
second of which led to the firing
j of Met/for and the restriction of
j the paper in which it was printed.
The first article is a survey of
sexual activities of Oakland stu
dents which Vainer claims was
(1) not authorized for circulation
j in the dorms, (2) of "highly ques
tionable propriety," (3) answered
I "as a joke" by Oakland students,

i1) inaccurate and (5) aimed
solely at providing a "sensational
story."
"TiIEKE is a possibilty that
we could have been taken into
court for this survey for damag
ing the character of the girls at
the university," Vainer said
Wednesday.
Met/.ger, admitting that he has
not had experience in poll-taking,
said that he had planned to make
qualifying remarks in writing up
th<> poll. He denied Valuer's alle
gation that it had been answered
dishonestly by students. Never
theless, Met/.ger said, he agreed
not to print the story.
The second article was a news
story after Varner had asked that
the survey not be printed and
had threatened to suspend Me'z
ger if il appeared. The article de
scribed the chancellor's action
and the survey.
