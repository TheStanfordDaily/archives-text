# THE 						'THINK TANK'
## Advanced Study Center: It's 'Heaven' 
### 
By SUSAN KKNT
"Think Tank," "incubator," and
"leisure of the theory class":
These labels are among the many
applied to the Center for Ad
vanced Study ih Iho Behavioral
Sciences.
Located on a knoll overlooking
Lake Lag and the Stanford Golf
Course, the center annually
selects 50 students of human be
havior to come on post-doctor al
fellowships. The "Fellows," most
of whom hold university appoint
ments, receive one year of free
time for study without any of the
usual publish-or-perish pressures.
Til 10 FOKI) Foundation leased
the 10-aero site from Stanford
and established the center in
1954. With the aim of developing
the behavorial sciences in their
broadest sense, the center selects
scholars from a wide variety of
fields. The 1963-64 Fellows in
clude philosophers, psychologists,
anthropologists, historians, sociol
ogists, political scientists, a biol
ogist. a mathematician, a lin
guist, and two lawyers. As Pres
ton Cutler, assistant director at
the center, remarks, "The real
resource here ... is the people
who come. They teach and learn
from one another."

I Fellows do benefit from a
wealth of facilities and services
at the center. Each scholar gets
a generous financial grant, at
least equal to his previous salary.
The center encourages him to
bring his family and locates near
j by furnished housing for rent.
Each fellow has a private study
and access to a secretarial service
and library at the center. In addi
j tion (he center has a contract
with the Stanford library for ma
; terials n<Â»l available in the work
ing collection. If a Fellow needs a
special source, he merely gives a
I slip to the center's librarian and
j she scouts around for il at Stan
ford. "The center is designed to
free the mind from irksome de
| tails." comments Professor Je
; rome Shaffer, current Fellow in
'philosophy from Swart hmore
| College. "Il will bo difficult to go
back where professors are no I
: treated so luxuriously."
TIIK LOOK of leisure, however,
j may be misleading. "Some people
think a university career is a re
treat from life," explains Assis
tant Director Cutler. "This is a
retreat from the hustle and bustle
l of university life. Yet the Fel
lows have proved to bo tremen
dous workers." Past fellows have
attributed over I U> books to their
i time at the Center. Among these

professors are Stanford's Sanford
M. Dornbusch (A Primer or So
cial Statistics); Kenneth J. Ar
row (Studies in Linear and Non-
Linear Programming), and Wil
bur Schramm (Television in 11n*
Lives of Our Children), Noted
authors Crane Brinton and Eu
gene Burdick have also been Fel
lows at the center.
Most of the work done at the
center on an individual level lies
in writing books and planning
future research. Also, Fellows dis
cuss problems together and share
perspectives. Professor Shaffer,
who is studying Hie philosophical
connection of man's conscious
ness to his physical body, finds
it helpful to talk with psychia
trists and sociologists and see
"man as a whole with reality."
Some collaborative enterprises
arise, such as a recent study of a
Bay Area school district to iden
tify the social forces that influ
ence the attitudes of high school
social studies teachers.
The Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences now
has over 9,000 applicants on file
for fellowship grants. Nominees
are divided into lists by academic
fields and then sent to a panel
of from five to seven social scien
tists in that lilc field. Final ap
proval is made by the board of

directors. Among the eight mem
bers of this board are Clark Kerr,
chancellor of the University of
California at Berkeley, and Rob
ert R. Sears, psychologist, Stan
ford.
Sura,jit Sinha, anthropologist
from India, summing up his feel
ings about the center Says, "It's
one of the most civilized human
congregations I have observed
and one of the best examples of
how affluence can best be util
ized." As a general recommenda
tion, the center posts this com
ment from the office of Kenneth
Burke, literary critic and former
Fellow:
"Some time back our hero had
the good fortune to spend a year
in residence at the Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences, Stanford. California. By
the rules of the game there, he
was free 1o think, write, talk,
listen, and, of course, argue to
his heart's content (and all "on
the house"). While he was there
in the thick of this rich dream
life, a fellow-Fellow, member of a
"grievance committee," came to
interview him, asking if he had
any grievances he wanted pre
sented to the administration.
Whereupon our hero exclaimed,
"Grievances? My God, I'm in
Heaven."
