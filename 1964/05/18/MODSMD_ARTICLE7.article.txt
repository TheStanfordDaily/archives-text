## Examples Of Brutality In South In Report Given To Stanford Girls 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN Feature Editor 
Florence Moore's Loro House,
in a special meeting Thursday
night, pledged $60 of the house
social budget for use by students
currently in Mississippi.
The action was taken following
a description by Civil Rights Sec
retariat Chairman Ilene Strelitz
of recent events in that state.
Letters received in the past week
from Project Mississippi head
quarters in Jackson stated that
"thousands of answers to in
quiries, acceptances, and informa
tion for accepted volunteers are
sitting on the desk, unable to be
mailed out for lack of postage
funds."
Increased harrassment and jail
ing of volunteers with subsequent
brutal treatment in Mississippi
jails by white prisoners have
necessitated increased expenditure
for bail funds and payment of
fines, it has been reported.
Eight signed affidavits testify
ing to recent: acts of intimidation
in Mississippi were also received
by the Secretariat. The affidavits
were presented in order to pro
vide? documentary evidence of the
continual harrassment and intimi
dation of Negroes and civil rights
workers. The COFO statement
notes that almost no press reports
of these incidents have appeared
in Northern papers and no major
Federal investigation has been
conducted in any of the eight
cases mentioned.
In the past month, six white
workers have been beaten in the
Jackson jails. The last two people
beaten were told that the pur
pose of the beatings was to pre
sent an example of what civil

rights workers coming to Missis
sippi for the summer can expect.
"Few factors have as much in
fluence on Mississippi's Negroes
and on efforts to organize for
civil lights as the ever-present
and brutal system of intimida
tion," the COFO statement reads.
"Nevertheless, for some reason,
these incidents have not been con
sidered important enough to be
brought to the attention of the
nation."
The affidavit describes different
forms of physical, political, and
economic intimidation in th ree
different areas of the state. The
first statement, that of Archie
Curtis of Natchez, a Negro active
in civil rights, describes violence
by a vigilante group. Curtis and
an employee were beaten by sev
eral armed white men. "I believe
we should have protection from
lawless elements, and I will con
tinue to be active in anything that
will better our people without
harming anyone else," Curtis' af
fidavit states.
A statement by Willis Wright
presents an example of economic
intimidation with police involve
ment in Greenwood. Wright, who
was fired from his job without
any warning or reason given,
states, "I believe that the sole
reason that I was fired was this
policeman telling my boss to fire
me because of my voter registra
tion activities."
Statements by Richard Jewett
and Eli Hochstedler describe the
arrest and l)eatings while in jail
to which civil rights workers are
subjected. Jewett, arrested for
"drunkness" while walking down
the street after having eaten din
ner, during which he had drunk
nothing but coffee, was beaten by
a police officer in the police sta
tion booking room. After the
beating, the several officers in
I the room decided to add "resist-
I ing arrest" to the charges against
i the beaten prisoner,
j Hochstedler was sevcrly beaten
| by white prisoners in his cell in
j the Hinds County Jail. "In my
! opinion, the life of any white civil
| rights person is in danger in a
; Mississippi jail," Hochstedler
writes.
