cAll Without Excuses
We humaus by nature tend to fill our lives with idolatries and ex
cuses in order to keep from confronting the Living God. Some people
have denied God for so long that they are certain He does not exist.
Others have fooled themselves into believing that their own concocted
theories fit the truth or that God will adapt Himself to their every whim.
God is not changed by man's pronouncements about Him, and His power
is not diminished by any denial of Ilis attributes. Rather, He tells men
that they are without excuse because they have not acknowledged Him
nor sought His will for their lives. He neither overlooks nor ignores the
sins of man:
"For God's (holy) wrath and indignation are revealed from heaven
against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who in their wick
edness repress and hinder the truth and make it inoperative. For that
which is known about (iod is evident to them and made plain in their
inner consciousness bccause (iod (Himself) has shown it to them. For
ever since the creation of the world, His invisible nature and attributes,
that is, His eternal power and divinity have been made intelligible and
clearly discernible in and through the things that have been made—His
handiworks. So (men) are without excuse—altogether without any de
fense or justification (Romans 1 :18-20 Ampl. NT).
God did not intend for us to think of Him only at night before bed,
or at church, or in times of great trial and stress. He means for us to
walk with Him in close fellowship in everything we do. God holds men
accountable and guilty before Him because they have not acknowledged
and gratefully received His own death on the Cross on their behalf:
"For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that He (even)
gave up His only-begotten (unique) Son, so tbat whoever believes in
(trusts, clings to, relies on) Him shall not perish—comes to destruction,
be lost—but have eternal (everlasting) life. For God did not send the
Son into the world in order to judge, to reject, to condemn, to pass sen
tence on the world; but that the world might find salvation and be made
safe and sound through Him. He who believes on Him—who clings to,
trusts in, relies on Him—is not judged (he who trusts in Him never
comes up for judgment, for him there is no rejection, no condemnation ;
he incurs no damnation). But he who does not believe is judged already
(he has already been convicted, has already received his sentence) because
he has not believed on and trusted in the name of the only begotten Son
of God. He is condemned for refusing to let his trust rest in C hrist's
name." (John 3:16-18 Amp. NT),
God does not expect, you to clean up your life first nor does Tic want
to deprive, you of any good thing in order to become a Christian. I le wants
to give you as a free gift eternal life and sweet fellowship with Himself.
"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through
Jesus Christ our Lord." Rom. 6:23.
Today the living and risen Lord Jesus Christ makes this offer to any
and all:
"Behold I stand at the door and knock; if any one hears My voice
and opens the door, T will come in to him and will dine with him and he
with Me." (Rev. 3:19)
God Who rules His great creation with infinite care according to im
mutable laws asks only that you open the door of your heart to Him and
receive His love and forgiveness. As wayward and lost creatures cut-off
from Him, this is what man desperately needs. This is the only solution
to individual and group problems, and if men neglect or turn away from
?o great salvation, they are without excuse.!
