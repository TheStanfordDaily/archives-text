## State Party Head Will Speak Today 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM 
Albert Lima, controversial
chairman of th e Communist
Party in Northern California,
will speak in Cubberley Audito
rium this afternoon on "Tiie Com
munist Party in th e United
States."
According to a Palo Alto Times
story of May 2, a similar visit by
I the communist leader to the Col
| lege of San Mateo resulted in con
siderable criticism, especially
from the American Legion. Lima
spoke to a large gathering of stu
dents there on April 30.
Following his appearance, th e
American Legion accused San
Mateo's president. Dr. Julio Bor*
tallaz/.0, of "bad judgment" and
responded by canceling a June 13
speaking engagement. The Presi
dent was to have addressed 1 h e
! Legion's annual Boys State lunch
| eon in San Carlos.
The Legion's stand was adopted
by about 50 delegates from 22
posts in the 26th District of the
American Legion, the paper said.
One post commander said th e
State Legion was opposed to Com
munists speaking on college and
university campuses "on th e
basis they are traitors."
Bortallazzo was quoted as fol
lows: "They say I am a good
American and yet they won't
let me speak. I believe in th e
American way of life. I am op-
I posed to communism. Our differ-
I ence is how to attack this insidi
ous philosophy." He said lie was
"disappointed" that his speaking
j invitation had been retracted.
According to the paper, the Le-
I gion made it clear that it was not
I questioning the president's loy
; alty in its action but only hi s
| judgment.
The Times also reported in the
i same article that there was a
("strong community controversy"
; proceeding Lima's appearance,
but il did not elaborate on this
1 statement.
Authorities at Stanford say
(here have been no complaints of
any kind regarding the Commu
nist's visit here today. Both Bob
Byers, Director of the Stanford
j University News Service, and
Frederic Glover, executive assist
ant to the president, said jester
day that they had heard no com
ments or objections.
