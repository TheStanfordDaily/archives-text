# "Baroque Era' Now Exhibited In Main Libe
## 
### 
An exhibition on "The Baroque
I Era" can be seen in the Albert
| M. Bender Room of the Stanford
Library. The highlights of Baro
( que culture are presented through
rare books, manuscripts and
maps from the Stanford Division
of Special Collections and a group
of eight drawings which are on
loan from the California Palace
J of the Legion of Honor.
Separate showcases depict how
ithe different aspects of this pe
riod took varying forms in the
different parts of Europe. There
is a showcase for every possible
cultural area, from art to archi
tecture, from science to witch
craft.
THE COLLECTORS of the
time are scholars and emperors.
The literature of the time is rep
resented by books from the Eng
lish poet Richard Crashaw and
by Grimmelshausen, who de
scribes horrors of the Thirty
Years War in detail.
In another showcase, Bible
illustrations of Rembrandt are
juxtaposed with drawings of
Breccioli, who was close to the !
surrealists of today. Diagrams of
ships and carriages explain the;
way of travel and a beautiful il- j
lust rated set of folios tells the i
story of the discovery of Her
culaneum.
Each unit in the exhibit tries to !
be different not only in content,
but also in style, in order to give
the observer an idea about the
colorful aspects of Baroque cul
ture and the tension between real
istic and idealistic expression.
The exhibit is the work of Dr.
Susan V. Lensky, a Rare Books
librarian and a teacher of the
History of the Book here at Stan
ford. The exhibit will continue
I throughout Spring quarter.
I Those groups which are inter
ested in a guided tour in English,
German or Hungarian are invited
to contact Dr. Lenkey at exten
sion 2015.
