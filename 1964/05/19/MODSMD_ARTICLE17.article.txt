# DeSYLVIA LEADS WAY
## White Team Clips Reds 
### PETER EAKLAND 
The throwing; arm of Terry De-
Sylvia and the running of Ray
Handloy and John Road built up
an early lead to give Coach Leon
McLaughlin's White squad a 26-13
victory over a sometimes impres
sive, sometimes ragged, Red
squad Saturday afternoon in the
Stadium.
The position that fans and
coaches watched most carefully
was the quarterback slot in which
four actors took the stage. For
the last few years, several players
have been in the running for the

! important position and this year
is no exception.
I>eSYI,VIA proved himself as
a capable field general. Playing
a fine, consistent game, he di
! rected his White team on several
: good drives climaxing in touch
downs.
His prime target on passes was
flanker Dick Ragsdale, w ho
made good catches on three spot
j pass patterns.
j Don Cook, last year's number
1 three signal caller, spelled Do
-1 Sylvia occasionally and pulled off
several fine plays. Off a jump
pass pattern, lie faked twice then
nailed Phil Wagner who stumbled
into the end zone.
From the freshman squad
comes Dave Lewis, who alone of
the quarterbacks distinguished
himself through the air and on
the ground. Firing a hard spiral, I
he connected with end Bob Mont-i
gomery on several short passes j
and also with Phil Humphries.
ALSO THROWING long well,
ho missed a couple Saturday but j
the coaches remember the 40-
yarder he threw in the final min- 1
uto of the Little Big Game.
Lewis supplied the day's long
est gainer, a 10-yard jaunt around
right end. Ho fumbled several
times on bad pitchouts, but these
can probably be checked by extra |
j work on the option. A potential :
I triple throat, ho also boorticd out
! long punts.
The incumbent in the fight fori
quarterback is Dick Berg. Ii is j
! performance Saturday was not j
I up to par, but he did do some ;
good running and passed well on :
occasion.
THIS WIIITK running baokfield
I of Ray Handlev contributed

ihtoo scores. John Road, a big 6*,
216-pounder, got in tho scorebook
with a 13-yard gallop and a two
yard plunge.
Ilandley was tho outstanding
runner of the afternoon. He
worked his way through the line
tor good gains and powered for
a couple of extra yards when hit.
John Guillory, Handlcy's suh,
showed good speed and agility in
his several appearances.
Glenn Myers, who scored th e
Red's first touchdown, and run
ning mate Bob Blunt also looked
good.
Running punts hack for the
Red team were Craig Ritchey
and Dale Rubin. Ritchey is a
proven performer in this area
and Rubin appears to have equal
talenis since he maneuvered for
7.1 yards only t<> be called back
by a penalty.
RALSTON singled out lineman
Bob Rath as a promising line
hacker who, along with Jack
Chappie, will help fill ihe shoes
of Marv Harris. Freshman defen
sive ends Al Wilbtirn and Don
DeSomery also distinguished
themselves.
Fans can rest assured that two
elements of last year's games
will still be around fumbles and
penalties. Between both squads,
there were nine fumbles. The list
of the guilty includes most of the
backfields on Hot h sides Lewis,
DeSylvia, Berg, and Handley.
West Coast referees are the
most prolific whistle blowers in
the country and Saturday was a
good warm up for them. They
whistle just about as much, at
any sign of body contact, as an
Italian male out for a sidewalk
stroll.
