# Ralston Defeats Ashe In Stanford Tennis Tourney
## 
### JIM BESTE 
II was bitter news for S t a n
ford tennis as the Southern fac
tories swept all honors in th e
AAVVU tournament played on the
Stanford courts over the week
end. The field was dominated by
USC and UCLA with the Trojans
taking the team title by a narrow
16-15 margin.
Formerly tempermental Dennis
Ralston encountered little resili
ence in annexing his second con
i ference title in as many years. In
the finals the Menace put down
Arthur Ashe of UCLA 6-3, 6-2. On
occasion Ashe is capable of great
things, but the Menace totally
subdued him with sizzling and
accurate serves and brilliant vol
leys.
TIIIC ONLY Stanford player to
survive the second round was
that enigmatic figure Jim Besto.
Bcstc lost a titanic struggle to
highly regarded Charles Pasarell
1-6. 6 1, 9-7.
To the discerning eye Beste's
estotoric approach is a lovely

sight. His services are shattering,
his backhand impenetrable, and
his volleying superb — all per
formed with ethereal grace. Y el
he never wins.
The swarthy, Tarzan-like Puer
; to Rican was virtually paralyzed
; by the barrage of winners that
! descended upon him in the first
I and third sets, but he managed
, to hold on and escaped in time
I for lunch. In the semi-finals Ral
ston was too good for Pasarell at
6-1, 9-7 and Ashe etiminated an
l exhausted Bill Bond 6-2, 6-1.
The deciding match was th e
[doubles final \von by Bond-Ral
jston over Pasarell-Ashe 4-6, 6-3,
'6-2. Ralston is an instinctive
doubles player. Once again he
! quieted the critics by proving he
;is the finest amateur doubles
! player in the world.
As an afterthought the out
come of the tournament can be
rationalized. Perhaps it was a
case of the jock of the South over
j the intellegentsia of the North.
'And so it goes.
