# Beutelsbachers Stage 'My Fair Madchen'

### MARY KAY BECKER Staff Writer 
STUTTGART, Germany —
"My Fair Madchen."
So read the hlack letters
on the new marquee over the
classroom door. And a grand
opening night (and closing,
too) it was: assuredly the
most outstanding' Fest, ac
cording to informed students,
ever presented by a group on
the Burg. (These Fests are
put on by the Burg students
at the end of every quarter
for their German families in
Beutelsbach a n d Enders
bach.)
A musical with a continu
ous plot rather than the
usual collection of skits, "My
Fair Madchen" was based on
"My Fair Lady." Through the
scholarship of those writing
the German script, the earn
est efforts of an orchestra
consisting of recorders, gui
tars, cellos, and a piano
(what Bnrg students lack in
musical variety they make
up in quality), not to men
tion the fine acliug of the
stars, transformed the origi
nal into an all-surpassing
German version.
Tom, the hero, is an all-
American Stanford student
who has recently arrived at
the Burg. As the musical be
gins, he and others are in
attendance at a Fasching car
nival party in Beutelsbach.
He immediately espies a
charming German Madchen
name<l Grctchen — but th e
antithesis ami basis for the
plot is set up when he acci
dentally insults her because
of his inadequate German.
Grctchen slaps his face and
retorts with the classic
Schwabisch sent e 11 e e: "I
gang alloi hoiin!" ("I'll go
home by myself!")
Gretchen leaves the next
day for a month's trip; Tom
resolves th a t while she's

away he'll learn German so
well (hat he can take her to
a restaurant, order a meal,
and have everyone take him
tor a German.
Ilis German does gradually
improve through visiting his
Bentelshaeh family, taking
train rides (and missing t he
right one, of course), etc. —
until finally the big day
comes and he and Grctchen
go out to dinner.
Unknown to him, however,
his true friend, Jerry, tells
the waiter beforehand, who
agrees to play along. All goes
well during the meal until
Tom and Grctchen leave —
haf check girl disrupts all by
asking Tom to sign th e
American guest book! He
realizes that he has fooled
no one.
But at this point, the real
moral of the story is ex
pressed by sweet and stout
hearted Grctchen, who con
soles Tom and says be has
not come to Germany to be
come a German, but to learn
from the people and the cul
ture. Tom is reassured, the
chorus returns, and the cur
tain falls on a happy scene to
the tune of "I Could Have
Danced All Night."
Incidentally, the curtain
did not actually fall, since
there was actually no cur
tain. The inimitable ingenu
ity of the director, however,
provided the solution of a
curtain consisting of seven
students who walked in after
each scene carrying signs
which spelled out "Yorhang"
(curt a in.)
Quite co ordinated for the
most part, the Yorhang was
such a hit that it led to the
introduction of a new, posi
tiveadjective almost equiva
vent to "cool" —into that odd
German dialect known as
Burgdcutsch; namely, Yor
hanglich.
