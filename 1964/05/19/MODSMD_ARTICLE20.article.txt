# Schlicke, Relay Star Down South
## 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
Paul Schlicke and a swift Iwo
mile relay team highlighted Stan
ford's evening last Friday in the
annual Los Angeles Coliseum.
i Racing in what his coach, Pay
j ton Jordan, called "one of the
best miles I've ever watched,"
Schlicke posted a 4:03.0 to take
fourth place in what was billed
as a "Miracle Mile." That it didn't
turn out as a miracle was no
fault of (he participants, as they
gave the crowd one of its ihree
big thrills of the evening.
JOHN CAMIEN, the'national
cross-country champion from
Emporia, Kansas State Teachers,
was the favorite at the opening
gun as almost all of the big name
milers scheduled to run cancelled
out at the last minute.
Tom O'Hara, Dyrol Burleson,
Morgan Groth and Cary Weisiger
all dropped out of the race before
it ever started, leaving Camien
and the LA Track Club's J i m
Grelle ihe class of the field.
Bob Schul, Miami of Ohio's
4:00.9 standout was another
strong entrant, along with
Schlicke and the LATC's Phil
Clark.
THE RACK itself was extreme
ly exciting, with Schul and Grelle
alternating as the pacesetters and
Camien and Schlicke just off the
pace. Camien eventually came on
to win in 4:00.7. Grelle hung on
for second with Schul third and
Schlicke just behind.
Stanford's two-mile relay was
even better than its top miler,
though. The team of Harley An
drews, Harry McCalla, Bill Pratt
'and Bob Milt/ set a school record
of 7:24.3 in finishing fifth be
! hind Villanova, San Jose State,
IJCLA and Texas. Villanova's
winning time of 7:19.0 was good
enough to tie the world standard.
Andrews was the Card unit's
top individual with a clocking of
1:49.5 for his leg. McCalla was
next, at 1:150.5, Pratt ran a 1:51.3
and Milt/ was in at 1:52.0.
THE OUTSTANDING single
! leg on any relay team was run
|by UCLA sophomore Bob Day.
winner of the mile race earlier
! this season in which Schlicke ran
i his all-time best. Day was in at
1:46.5, only a slim 1.1 second
worse than the world mark.
Other highlights of the meel
j were the 100-meter dash and the
200-meter event. Most American
meets are running metric dis
tances this season because Ihat.
is what is done at the Olympics.
In Ihe 100-meter event, little
Grambling College's Vemus
Ragsdale scampered across the
line in 10.2, only a tenth of a sec
ond off the world standard.
The 200 was tho much-heralded
duel between Arizona State's
| Henry Carr and Bob Hayes of
Florida A&M. Carr, the underdog,
j raced to a sterling 20.6 in beating
i his rival who came in at 20.8.
