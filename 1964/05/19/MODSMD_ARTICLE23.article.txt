# Play Review
## Vanya Re-Creates Old Russia 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
The International Repertory
Theater's production of "Uncle
Vanya" recreates much of the
nostalgic uniqueness of one of
Anton Chekhov's major plays.
Chekhov is a dramatist remark
able for his subtlety, for his in
tuntive perception and depth. His
plays, although nearly plotless,
have a tremendous dramatic im
pact that seems to stem from the
inner force of the characters
themselves.
"Uncle Vanya," a family comic
tragedy set in the disenchanted
Russia of the late nineteenth cen
tury, portrays Ivan Voynitzky, af
fectionately called Vanya, a lyri
cal but regretful and aging ideal
ist who finds himself disillu
sioned by his dead sister's hus
band, the retired professor Alex
andre Serebryakov, and fatally
attracted to the professor's sec
ond wife.

VANYA IS alternately repelled
and attracted by his best friend,
the suave and handsome doctor
Mihail Astrov. It is only by a
long and painful process th a t
Vanya discovers his real identity
with his niece Sonya, whose
beauty of soul surpasses her
plainness of face.
Ernest B. Lonner's direction not
only recreates the delicate moods
and pathos for which we most
prize Chekhov, but intermingles
these with the genuine humor,
the high comedy that pervades
"Uncle Vanya" and speaks elo
quently of Chekhov's intuitive
sense of tragic-comic balance.
Mr. Lonner has at his disposal
a high quality cast. Arthur L.
Meyer as Vanya is a giant, a wild
eyed figure of mobile and dy
namic features, standing out in
his family surroundings like an
embodiment of the mythical old
Russia. When he roars it is the
roar of a lion yet of a lion
wounded long ago.
Roger Larson as Serebryakov
the professor by contrast, plays
the raspy and self-indulgent old
egotist, basking in memories of
his former prowess with women,
securely sure in his position as
head of the household, quite
aware of the burden he has
placed upon them yet stubbornly
resolved to enjoy himself in spite
of them.
Jercd Fey as Doctor Astrov,
Vanya's best friend, portrays a
compelling man who carries his
own faded idealism with a flair
that is impressive to men and
attractive to women, yet which
at times masks a deep-seated mis
anthropy and a cynical superfi
ciality.

BILLIK DIXON as the plain
featured Sonya, projects a warm
simplicity, an inner radiance,
especially in her soliloquy. Doro
thy Rodin as Marina the nurse,
Leonard Austin as "Waffles,"
and Mary Helen Bailey as th e
Maid (a role apparently added by
the director to contain the play
within one set), round off Chek
hov's picture of close family life
and give it warm solidity.
Karyl Hoff's interpretation of
Yelena Andrcyevna. the profes
sor's second wife, raises the only
real problem in the production.
Certainly hers is a difficult role
to play: the actress must be half
the gracious and suffering wife
and hostess of the house, and half
the maddening "wood demon" of
Chekhov's earier title, the
charming, cold, bored beauty with
mermaid's blood in her veins.
And Karyl Hoff does create a
detached, affected, nominally un
aware woman, with sudden mo
ments of exalted concern an d
charm. But she makes faces, is
off in another world in the midst
of total family crises, and seems
constantly posing for effect. She
exaggerates Yelena's character
istics until she becomes almost a
caricature.
Nevertheless Miss Hoff man
ages to convey Chekhov's general
impression, and the overall pro
duction saves her. Jerry Miller's
period set is highly effective, and
the blending-in of melanchoic,
surging Russian music rounds
off a lively and sensitive produc
tion of Chekhov's play.
"Uncle Vanya" will continue at
the International Repertory Thea
ter in San Francisco Fridays and
Saturdays at 8:30 p.m., Sundays
at 2:30 p.m., through the end of

BILLIK DIXON as the plain

especially in her soliloquy. Doro
thy Rodin as Marina the nurse,
Leonard Austin as "Waffles,"
and Mary Helen Bailey as th e
Maid (a role apparently added by
the director to contain the play
within one set), round off Chek
hov's picture of close family life
and give it warm solidity.
Karyl Hoff's interpretation of
Yelena Andrcyevna. the profes
sor's second wife, raises the only
real problem in the production.
Certainly hers is a difficult role
to play: the actress must be half
the gracious and suffering wife
and hostess of the house, and half
the maddening "wood demon" of
Chekhov's earier title, the
charming, cold, bored beauty with
mermaid's blood in her veins.
And Karyl Hoff does create a
detached, affected, nominally un
aware woman, with sudden mo
ments of exalted concern an d
charm. But she makes faces, is
off in another world in the midst
of total family crises, and seems
constantly posing for effect. She
exaggerates Yelena's character
istics until she becomes almost a
caricature.
Nevertheless Miss Hoff man
ages to convey Chekhov's general
impression, and the overall pro
duction saves her. Jerry Miller's
period set is highly effective, and
the blending-in of melanchoic,
surging Russian music rounds
off a lively and sensitive produc
tion of Chekhov's play.

The International Repertory
Theater's production of "Uncle
Vanya" recreates much of the
nostalgic uniqueness of one of
Anton Chekhov's major plays.
Chekhov is a dramatist remark
able for his subtlety, for his in
tuntive perception and depth. His
plays, although nearly plotless,
have a tremendous dramatic im
pact that seems to stem from the
inner force of the characters
themselves.
"Uncle Vanya," a family comic
tragedy set in the disenchanted
Russia of the late nineteenth cen
tury, portrays Ivan Voynitzky, af
fectionately called Vanya, a lyri
cal but regretful and aging ideal
ist who finds himself disillu
sioned by his dead sister's hus
band, the retired professor Alex
andre Serebryakov, and fatally
attracted to the professor's sec
ond wife.

VANYA IS alternately repelled
and attracted by his best friend,
the suave and handsome doctor
Mihail Astrov. It is only by a
long and painful process th a t
Vanya discovers his real identity
with his niece Sonya, whose
beauty of soul surpasses her
plainness of face.
Ernest B. Lonner's direction not
only recreates the delicate moods
and pathos for which we most
prize Chekhov, but intermingles
these with the genuine humor,
the high comedy that pervades
"Uncle Vanya" and speaks elo
quently of Chekhov's intuitive
sense of tragic-comic balance.
Mr. Lonner has at his disposal
a high quality cast. Arthur L.
Meyer as Vanya is a giant, a wild
eyed figure of mobile and dy
namic features, standing out in
his family surroundings like an
embodiment of the mythical old
Russia. When he roars it is the
roar of a lion yet of a lion
wounded long ago.
Roger Larson as Serebryakov
the professor by contrast, plays
the raspy and self-indulgent old
egotist, basking in memories of
his former prowess with women,
securely sure in his position as
head of the household, quite
aware of the burden he has
placed upon them yet stubbornly
resolved to enjoy himself in spite
of them.
Jercd Fey as Doctor Astrov,
