## Students Failed To Penetrate Belli's Flamboyant Exterior 
### 
' Editor, The Daily:
After Mr. Belli's talk Tuesday
| 1 was somewhat surprised, per
: haps shocked is a better word, at
the attitude of too many students
I toward him. Their lack of ability
j to see through his flamboyant ex-
I terior was astonishing.
I am not saying that he is not
a clever man; however history
has known many clever, infamous
men who were certainly far from
great. Then, to hear a student re
fer to him as "one of the great
minds of law," is to compare
Ruby to Jesus Christ (which Mr.
Belli managed to accomplish sev
eral times).
Such great men as Learned
j Hand and John Marshall would
! turn over in their graves. A good
I idea of Mr. Belli's contribution to
! justice would be the recent case
' that he proudly cited in which he
j obtained $300,000 for his client
who had been called a dirty name;
which, in my opinion, is another
example of perverting and ma
nipulating the law for one's own
benefit.
How he has been able to dupe
juries all these years left me puz
zled, until we got a first hand
view of his tactics. However, his
tactics would seem to only insult
the average intellect. His digres
sions to irrelevances were humor
ous, his distorsions of fact a n d
truth were ludicrous, and his as
sociations were absurd.
One example should make the
point amply clear. He told us. in
a voice ringing with evangelical
seriousness, that he noticed the
foreman of the jury remove a
piece of lint from his pants as he
was handing the judge the ver
dict, which, Mr. Belli then tells
us, is obviously symbolic of the
man "washing his hands of t he
matter." And with Pontious Pilot
removing the lint from his trou
sers, we are left with the conclu
sion that Christ is about to be
crucified again.

• Direct Action
Editor, The Daily:
Having been twice attacked in
The Daily for my views advocat
ing non-violent direct action in
civil rights in certain circum
stances — once by Fred Miller,
who equated my views with those
of Hitler, and by Fred Ilawley,
who said that I advocate a totali
tarianism which would crush in
dividuality — 1 feel compelled to
respond.
Mr. Hawlcy maintains, first,
that it is possible to consider the
problem of civil rights in a vac
uum vis-a-vis the rest of the
world because "world attention
does not exist."
I suggest that Mr. Hawley ex
amine the Survey of the China
Mainland Press in order to see
how the Communist Chinese are
able 1o exploit the issue of race
relations in the United States to
their own advantage. I suggest
also that Mr. Hawley talk wi 1 h
Americans who have traveled
abroad and have been questioned
closely by people in other coun
tries, including friendly countries,
about events in Birmingham and
I Little Rock.
I refer him also to recent stu
j dent demonstrations in Australia
I protesting discrimination and

segregation in America. Finally,
I ask him to consider what poten
tial exists for good relations be
tween the U.S. and the African
countries so long as an 'apartheid'
policy operates in Mississippi,
Alabama, and other parts of our
country which is comparable in
many respects to the apartheid
policy in the Republic of South
Africa. In the face of this evi
dence, can anyone maintain that
world attention does not exist?
The remainder of Mr. Hawley's
letter is muddied by his apparent
desire to debate the merits of
capitalism vs. the merits of so
cialism (which for him becomes
Individualism vs. Collectivism),
rather than to discuss the merits
of Negro claims to equality in our
society.
Nevertheless, Mr. Ilawley does
say that Government can redress
only legal inequalities; and he
implies that property rights are
among the inalienable rights of
man and are therefore beyond
the reach of Law.
The Supreme Court, in the re
cent 'Sit-In Cases,' has held that
private ownership of public prop
erty is not an absolute right —
that it can be subject to regula
tion in the public interest with
regard to the question of serving
all persons without regard to race
or color.
Whether or not employment
policies in privately owned a n d
operated establishments open to
the public can be similarly regu
lated by law so as to forbid dis
crimination in hiring remains an
open question. The Supreme
Court lias held thus far only
that civil rights groups picketing
establishments and demanding
non-discriminatory hiring policies
may not demand that specific
quotas of minority persons be
hired. (Hughes vs. the Superior
Court of California.)

May I congratulate you on the
excellent editorial that appeared

gence with which you have ap

I feel that your editorial h a s

uted throughout California.

• Frost Fenced
Editor, The Daily:
It has recently come to my at
tention that Frost Ampitheater
has been fenced off and is to be
closed for the duration.
Where on this campus is a man
supposed to indulge in his hob
bies, if the best places arc re
moved from circulation?
