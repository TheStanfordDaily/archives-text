## President Is Scott-Free Of Program 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
What kind of a President will
Scott Mcßride be? Trying to an
swer that right now is about like
guessing what the Administra
tion's next policy will be. You
can't be sure until it happens.
Mcßride was fairly decisively
chosen by the voters last week,
winning for himself bigger head
lines than President Sterling has
even gotten out of Tlu> Daily. But
the voters even now are not
quite sure what they chose.
It would be interesting if Mc-

Bride sho u 1 d
s ud d only ex
plain wh a I he
thought about
student govern
ment, in a way
rather exciting.
After all he has
been scattering

| hints about like bread crumbs all
| during the campaign, building up
lan incredible amount of suspense.
One thing does seem apparent,
i Mcßride conceives the function
! of administrator as a major part
lot' his role as President. It's prob
' bably a good thing, too, for th e
past couple of ASSU Presidents
have not exactly been balls of fire
{ in the paper clip department.

| did vanish for a couple of months.
Besides speaking up strongly
ion a tidy President's office, Mc
: Bride came out for an efficient
ILASSIT. He suggested that
LASSU only concern itself with
matter on which it could take di
rect action, or — as he added
later on on matters in which
! it might effect some direct action
| in 1 he future.
Actually, he never made it too
clear why he was taking it upon
himself to set the agenda of the
Legislature. LASSU, when it
Wishes, is perfectly capable of
deciding what it may consider
and what it will not. And Mcßride
himself pointed out several times
during the course of Hie cam
paign that he did not approve of
executive interference in the Leg
islature.
The biggest fear that members
of Stanford's outgoing Establish
ment have about Mcßride is that
he will put the students back to
sleep, just at a moment when stu
dent activism was beginning to
make inroads in some very hard
to reach places.
It is true that Mcßride lacks
the dramatic sense of Armin Ros
encranz, or the fire of Bud Wed
in. or the tenacity of Bob Saylor.
and probably lacks the firm phil
osophic grounding of John Bry
son. Which all means that Mc-
Bride is lacking a great deal.
But he does have a great deal
of personal charm, and, I think,
an awareness that he has much
to learn before he will be much
more than a paperweight in the
President's chair.

HOPEFULLY what he will
I learn, will be to continue the poli
cies of recent student body
i Presidents and to accept their
j view of student government in
volvement in far more student ac
tivities than those which fall under
the exclusive jurisdiction of the
ASSU and of a realization of the
contributions which student gov
ernment at Stanford can make to
the Stanford community.
As Wedin said in a message to
the student body last Jan. 23,
"There are implications of stu
dent government concern and in
volvement in policy decisions, cur
riculum evaluation, teacher pro
motion. university in loco paren
tis, admissions policies, social
regulations, eel ucat io na I pro
gramming and the like. Within
all of these areas . . . student gov
ernment is deligated to take some
interest and action. If student
government did not. it would be
abrogating its responsibility to
the university and to the student
community."
Scott Mcßride was elected with
out clearly explaining his pro
gram, and in the process giving
some doubts as to his intentions,
if, indeed he has any.
But, although it is possible to
be elected without considering the
, role of student government and
presenting a program to fulfill
that role, Mcßride will find it
far more difficult to serve a
trusting student body, lacking
{ those magic ingredients of a con-
I copt of student government's role.
I and a program.
