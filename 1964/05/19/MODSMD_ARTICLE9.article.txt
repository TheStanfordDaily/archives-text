cent of the state's 122.000 Negroes of voting age
| are registered.
The Freedom Democratic Party will conduct a
; "Freedom Registration" and "Freedom Election"

eral Courts and Congress on the grounds that "a

significant portion of the voting-age population j
has boon denied the l ight lo vote because of color ;
or race."
A Freedom Democratic Parly delegation to the
Democratic National Convention will challenge,
(lie regular Mississippi delegation on the basis that
its members were elected undemocratieally and
that the Mississippi Democratic Party has been

groes, saying that whiles are also victims of the
tight one-party political structure in Mississippi.

mation. inadequate housing, health care, educa
tion. and rural development are the real issues in i
Mississippi, not 'Slates Rights' or 'Federal Kn

REV JOHN E. CAMERON, a Freedom Candi
date for the House of Representatives who is now
