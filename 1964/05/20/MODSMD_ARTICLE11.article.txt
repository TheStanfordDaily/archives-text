## White Plaza Dedication 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
White Memorial Plaza whose austere con
crete houses the free-form, free flowing "Mem
Claw" will be formally dedicated during cere
monies at 11:30 a.m. Saturday.
The dedication is part of this year's Stanford
Conference which will bring some 1,200 alumni
and friends of Stanford back to the campus for an
all-day session of lectures, seminars, and informal
discussion with members of the University's fac
ulty and administration. Conference activities in
clude a varsity-alumni football game scheduled for
Sat unlay a fternoon.
Till-: CKKKMOMKS officially opening White
Memorial pla/a will serve as a reunion for many
of the classmates of Jack White, one of the
brothers lor whom the pla/a is named.
A $1200.000 gift from Mr. and Mrs. Raymond B.
White of Kansas City in their sons' names made
construction of the plaza possible.
JACK WHIT 10, who graduated in 1919. was
drowned in a surfing accident off San Onofre
Beach in 19.32. His death was ironic: He had been
a Navy Frogman during the Second World War
and was considered an excellent swimmer.
The younger While brother, Bill, attended Stan

foid for one year (luring which ho apparently
managed to raise a great deal of havoc and then
left to join the Air Force, lie was killed in a train
ing plane accident at Randolph Field, Texas, in
1948.
AKOKDING to at least one of Jack White's
classmates, the unrestrained lines of "Mem Claw"
constitute an apt memorial to the two boys, who
were themselves a rather gloriously unrestrained
part of the Stanford student community two dec
ades past. "After all." Jack White's friends con
tinued, "you couldn't very well have had a bronze
statue or a classical fountain."
Apparently, there was very little of the "classi
cal" about the White brothers. Nostalgia has
blurred the sharpness of any real rowdyism, and
friends remember their "stunts" with appropriate
affection recalling the day when Jack White
bought up all the surplus dye markers in the area
and colored the whole of lake Lag a brilliant vol
low for llydrofollies.
Indeed, some of the members of the class of
'19 expressed a half-serious concern that efforts
to decorate the Plaza's "Memorial Hat Rack" didn't
show more gusto and imagination. The Whiles
would have been disappointed: "If .lack and Hill
were still in school. 'Mem (.'law' would have been
uprooted and installed on top of the church. . .
