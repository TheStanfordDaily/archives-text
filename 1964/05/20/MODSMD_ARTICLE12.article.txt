## Sees Socialism Coming To Favor 
### LIZ FREEMAN 
Albert J. Lima, in a speech
sponsored by the Political Union
yeste r d a y afternoon, said
Communists believe that eventu
ally Americans will come to be
in favor of Socialism.
The chairman of the Commu
nist Party in Northern California
pointed out that Socialism has
not yet found much support in
this country because capitalism
has been basically successful.
MR. LIMA stated that lie? has
refused to register with the
United States government as a
member of a Communist action
organization. His reason for re
fusal was that the MeCarran Act
defines a Communist action or
ganization as "one that engages
in espionage, treason, sabotage,
I force and violence, etc."
i In 19."i7. the Department of Jus
tice dropped charges against him
; which had involved a six-year
i trial, for lack of evidence that he
j was a member of a violent, troa
i sonous organization, he said.
COMMUNISTS consider each
! of the basic evolutions of man
kind, including capitalism, to
| have brought about great social
and economic improvements, he
said. They feel that Socialism is
the next step in man's social de
velopment, which will be followed
by Communism.
He noted that in the last forty
years. Socialism has been rapidly
replacing capitalism throughout
1 the world, and now incorporates
| fourteen countries, and one bil
lion people. In addition, many of
the new nations of Africa and
Asia are adopting socialist econ
I omies.
UNDLIt Socialism. Mr. Lima
explained, men contribute to so
ciety according to their abilities,
and are paid in proportion to
their contribution. In Commu
i nism, people would utilize their
] abilities toward the gain of all,
i and would be paid according to
i their needs.
