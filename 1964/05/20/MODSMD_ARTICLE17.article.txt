# CREATION: By God Or By Chance?

### 
"In the beginning Cod created the heaven and the earth." Gen. 1:1.
Now Christ is the exact likeness of the unseen—God tlie visible
j representation of the invisible; He is the firstborn—of all creations. For
it was in Him that all things were created, in heaven and on earth, things
| seen and things unseen, whether thrones, dominions, rulers, or author
ities; all things were created and exist through Him and in Him and
for Him. And He Himself existed before all things and in Him all tilings
j consist—cohere, are held together. (Col. 1:16-17 Ampl.)
The Bible does not say when the universe was created nor does it
1 say how. The "when" and "how" are matters of scientific speculation.
However, where the Bible' touches on matters scientific, it is reliable
and authoritative (for example, Isaiah 40, which was written 700 8.C.,
affirms that the earth is a sphere).
Scientific knowledge is subject to constant revision and change, and
many changes have been made in recent years concerning man's picture
of cosmology. Until recently, there were two main opposing theories of
creation: the "big bang" hypothesis of the Abbe Lemaitre and George
Caniow, and the theory of "continuous creation" advanced by Hoyle,
Bondi, and Gold. This latter theory suggests that there never was a
beginning. However, it is now falling out of favor because very recent
radio star data and rocket probe measurements strongly support the
theory of a definite beginning some billions of years ago.
In 1929 Hubble and Humason discovered that spectral light from
distant galaxies was shifted towards the red. This "red shift" seems to
indicate that the galaxies are receding from one another at velocities
which approach the velocity of light at the outermost limits of the uni
verse. Such evidence points towards the origin of the universe in the
explosion of a "primeval atom." Scientists theorize that in the beginning
all the stars, the intersetllar dust, and the interconnecting electro mag
netic energy may have been contained within a veiy small space. It is
staggering to the imagination to realize that a billion nebulae over a
distance of billions of light years may at one time have been compressed
into one small ball. Because scientists love to make calculations, they
can reconstruct what the early history of such a primeval atom might
have been like as it began its outward expansion. When such a universe
was one second old, it may have been 186.000 miles in diameter and
15 billion degrees K; at one year it may have been 3 million degrees K
and after a million years, 3 thousand degrees k. "Heaven" only knows
how hot it was at earlier times or how small the primeval atom was
"in the beginning." While it is mathematically possible for the universe
to have originated at a point source or to have had a previous history
before t 0, the physical interpretation of eternity past and the infinitely
small is an impossible task.
Albert Einstein established the equivalence of mass and energy. His
famous E inc- expresses the relationship he discovered between mass,
energy, and (lie velocity of light. This discovery made the thermonuclear
bomb possible and led scientists to study the physics of high temperature
thermonuclear reactions where mass can be converted into energy. This
new physics was then applied to the study of the hypothetical, expand
ing primeval atom. It can be shown that at the high temperatures which
must ha\'e existed in the primeval atom, solid matter could not exist.
All matters would be entirely converted into energy, powerful x-rays,
radio waves, light and radiation. Or, if you prefer, the universe may have
begun with one gigantic burst of light!
Tn this connection we not that the Gospel makes reference to Jesus
Christ as the "light of the World." The brilliance of the hypothetical
primeval atom suggests the splendor of His presence shining into the
darkness of the void which "comprehended it not." The elaborate and
elegent "big-bang" theory of the origin of the universe does not in any
way disagree with the Biblical picture of creation. However, we must
remember that all of man's theories on the origin of the universe are
speculative.
Unbelievers may prefer to think that this remarkable universe and
its miraculous origin came into being by "chance" rather than by the
hand of an almighty Creator. How much perfect order, and later, how
conscious, rational man could come about "by chance" makes a very
farfetched story, especially when compared to the clear revelation of
God given to man in the Holy Scriptures and in the Person of the Lord
Jesus Christ. An acceptance of God as Creator leads not only to a rever
ence and respect for the magnificent intelligence behind creation, but
to a much more logical and reasonable picture of "reality"!
Even more marvelous is the knowledge which Christians have that
(his God of creation is interested in individuals and that He has entered
human life and history in a real and personal way.
"For it has pleased (the Father) that all the divine fullness—the sun
total of (he divine perfection, powers, and attributes, should dwell in
Him (Christ) permanently. And God purposed that through Him—by
the service and intervention of Him (the Son) all things should be com
pletely reconciled back (o Himself, whether on earth or in heaven, as
through Him the Father made peace by means of the blood of His cross.
And although you at one time were estranged and alienated from Him
and from Him and of hostile attitude of mind in your wicked activities,
yet now lias Christ the Messah reconciled you to God in the body of His i
flesh through death, in order to present you holy and faultless and irre
proachable in His Father's presence. And this He will do provided that
you continue to stay wi(h and in the faith in Christ, well-grounded and
settled and steadfast, not shifting or moving away from the hope which
rests on and is inspired by the glad tidings of the Gospel, which you
heard and wlich lias been preached as being designed for and offered
without restrictions to every person under heaven . . ."(Col. 1:19-23 j
Ampl).
Many scientists know Jesus Christ on a personal basis and with
other Christians can reverently say:
"Holy, holy, holy, is God (lie sovereign Lord of all. who was and
is, and is to come . . . Thou art worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glorv
and honor and power, because thou didst create all things, by they will
they were created, and have their being." Bev. 4:8, 11.
Have you met the Holy God of Creation? You can know Him per
sonally if youll claim Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour.
