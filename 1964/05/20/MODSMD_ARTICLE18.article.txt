# Stanford Sweeps Girl's AAWU Tennis Tourney
## 
### PETE KING 
Contrary to a story in yester
day's Daily, the recent AAWU
1 tennis match was not- totally a
j matter of southern jocks over
northern intelligentsia. The Stan
ford women's team won every
single match in sweeping to a
team victory with 14 points. USC
and UCLA were distant seconds
with four, Cal had three, and
WSU had one.
In the singles, Janie Albert,
11th ranked nationally, beat Julie
Heldman, Kith ranked, in an all-
Stanford final, 6-2, 6-1. Janie ap
peared stronger as the match
went along, forcing Julie to
scramble for difficult returns.
IT WAS the fifth win for
Janie in six matches between the
girls. Last year Julie, from New
York, lopped Janie in the finals

| of the national junior girls singles
tournament, one of the rare times
i that an Eastern girl has won it.
THE DOUBLES competition
was an inter-school affair only to
the semi-finals. Carole Lepper
j and Marianne Pietschmann of
| Stanford overcame teammates
: Patricia Parish and Judy Tarlton,
3-6. 6-2. 6-3, to win the event.
Patricia and Judy, third seeded
j in the tournament, won their ini
jtial two matches over WSU and
j USC teams, 6-2. 6-0 and 6-2, 6-2.
IThen they upset favored Cindy
Madura and Gail Wilson of USC,

3-6, 6-2, 6-4, to gain a berth in the
1 finals.
Meanwhile the eventual cham-
I pions were breezing through
| teams from UCLA and USC by
| 6-2, 6-1 scores.
Combining the men's and wom
en's scores, as the Russians love
to do, Stanford won with 21
points, beating USC (20) and
UCLA (19). However, the unen
lightened AAWU counts the
| meets separately.
WHY SO MAW goorl girl ten
nis players at Stanford when Ihe
team doesn't even have a coach?
Sunny California may have some
thing to do with it. but rumor has
it that Admissions Director Rix
ford Snyder is a tennis fan.
One quite noticeable difference
between the men's and women's
meets was individual behavior.
The men, especially the UCLA
and USC players, threw rackets
around, blasted balls out of the
court, and occasionally cursed in
their frustration. On ihe con
trary, it seemed like the gills
were having a wonderful time,
win or lose.

northern intelligentsia. The Stan
ford women's team won every
single match in sweeping to a
team victory with 14 points. USC
and UCLA were distant seconds
with four, Cal had three, and
WSU had one.
In the singles, Janie Albert,
11th ranked nationally, beat Julie
Heldman, Kith ranked, in an all-
Stanford final, 6-2, 6-1. Janie ap
peared stronger as the match
went along, forcing Julie to
scramble for difficult returns.
IT WAS the fifth win for
Janie in six matches between the
girls. Last year Julie, from New
York, lopped Janie in the finals

| of the national junior girls singles
tournament, one of the rare times
i that an Eastern girl has won it.
THE DOUBLES competition
was an inter-school affair only to
the semi-finals. Carole Lepper
j and Marianne Pietschmann of
| Stanford overcame teammates
: Patricia Parish and Judy Tarlton,
3-6. 6-2. 6-3, to win the event.
Patricia and Judy, third seeded
j in the tournament, won their ini
jtial two matches over WSU and
j USC teams, 6-2. 6-0 and 6-2, 6-2.
IThen they upset favored Cindy
Madura and Gail Wilson of USC,

3-6, 6-2, 6-4, to gain a berth in the
1 finals.
Meanwhile the eventual cham-
I pions were breezing through
| teams from UCLA and USC by
| 6-2, 6-1 scores.
Combining the men's and wom
en's scores, as the Russians love
to do, Stanford won with 21
points, beating USC (20) and
UCLA (19). However, the unen
lightened AAWU counts the
| meets separately.
WHY SO MAW goorl girl ten
nis players at Stanford when Ihe
team doesn't even have a coach?
Sunny California may have some
thing to do with it. but rumor has
it that Admissions Director Rix
ford Snyder is a tennis fan.
One quite noticeable difference
between the men's and women's
meets was individual behavior.
The men, especially the UCLA
and USC players, threw rackets
around, blasted balls out of the
court, and occasionally cursed in
their frustration. On ihe con
trary, it seemed like the gills
were having a wonderful time,
win or lose.
Contrary to a story in yester
day's Daily, the recent AAWU
1 tennis match was not- totally a
j matter of southern jocks over
northern intelligentsia. The Stan
