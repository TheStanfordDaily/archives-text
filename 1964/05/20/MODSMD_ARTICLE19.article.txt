# Frosh Baseballers Ends Fine Season
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
With a 23-2 record the Frosh
baseball team finished its most
| successful season in recent his
tory. Fifteen of the games wore
against high school teams, an d
Stanford suffered nary a loss. The
other ton games pitted the Frosh
against local colleges. In these
encounters the Frosh were 8-2.
Against the other portion of the
j big three in local college frosh
baseball circles ihe Indians played
| .500 ball. Santa Clara, boasting of
their best team in a decade, lost
I their second encounter with Stan
ford after winning ihe first. With
Cal the Frosh won the first one
and lost the second.
LKADING the seasonal way at
the plate were Steve Hovley and
Mike Ottmar. Hovley sizzled most
of the season swatting the ball
at a .472 clip for the first fifteen
games. Ottmar was the same as
he was good for a .420 average
going into the last few tilts.
Unfortunately both boys got
caught in a tailspin just at the
wire. The result was to "lower"
their averages to .397 and .395
respectively.
Behind these two were short
stop Dick Swan, a good fielder
who hit .368; catcher Bill Boles, a
fine defensive player who hit
j .340; and slugger Dave Spence
1 who hit .315 and had 21 RBl's.
| Centerfielder Hovley was no
, slouch in the power department
as he hit five homers and drove
' in 33 runs.
STKICTLY against college com
! petition Ottmar and Swan were
most effective. Ottmar had a per
! centage of .410 and Swan an even
.400.
The top pitchers for Hie squad
were Hovley, Jim Blaschko, an d
Daro Quiring. Hovley, handi
capped by a sore hand, had a 3-0
record and a 0.82 earned run aver
age. He threw a no-hitter against
Oceana High School, striking out
17.
Blaschke had a perfect 6-0 slate
plus a good 1.72 ERA. Quiring
was Coach Ray Young's choice as
number one moundsman and as
such lie drew the most challeng
ing assignments. He finished with
eight wins, two losses, and a 2.6 I
FRA. Among his eight victories |
was a no-hitter versus Menlo Col j
lege in which he struck out 19 of
the 21 men he faced.

capped by a sore hand, had a 3-0
record and a 0.82 earned run aver
age. He threw a no-hitter against
Oceana High School, striking out

and lost the second.
LKADING the seasonal way at
the plate were Steve Hovley and
Mike Ottmar. Hovley sizzled most
