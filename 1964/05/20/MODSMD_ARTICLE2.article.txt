## Southern Legislators Act To Block Rights Project 
### BILL MOORE Editor 
The Mississippi legislature is expected speedily to pass a l>ill
re(|uiring all persons who plan to conduct "schools or community
centers for certain subjects to tile affidavits with the state outlin
ing their purpose.
The state can then decide whether to grant permission to the

applicants.
"AND THEY most certainly
won't to those of us who will be
working on the Mississippi |civil
rights| Project." reported Rick
Seifert, a Stanford student now
working with the lights move
ment in Jackon, Miss.
In a telephone interview wit h
The Daily, Seifert said: "This bill
was aimed right at us. When
Senators Dye and Collins intro
duced it. they simply said. 'You
know what l his is for.' There has
been no debate."
The penalty stipulated in the
bill is "not more than 60 days and
not more than $200."
MISSISSIPPI'S legislature "has
turned out a number of other
laws directed against the Sum
mer Project," Seifert pointed out.
Among them:
• A law permitting quarantines
to restrict the movement of citi
zens "when there is imminent
danger to public safety."
• A law making it a felony to
circulate material that encourages
boycotts.
• A law allowing communities
to lend "police equipment" to each
other in the event of civil dis
turbances.
• An appropriation providing
for 200 extra highway patrolmen
bringing the total force up to
•175. The measure, when coupled
with the construction price of a
new stale police academy, will
cost $-1 million.
OFFICIALS at the Council of
Federated Organizations' (COFO)
headquarters in Jackson have
charged that harrassment of their
aetivites has increased greatly in
the past three weeks.
Seven COFO workers, they de
clared, were arrested Friday night
in Belzoni on suspicion of stealing
their own car.
Seven others, COFO said, were
arrested recently in Hattiesburg
for picketing. Hattiesburg police
claimed they violated the state's
anti-picketing law because 'too
many were picketing."
Five students were arrested
while transporting books to Holly
Springs for the Summer Project's
library there. A COFO worker
told The Daily that the students
were charged with carrying books
that advocated the overthrow of
the state governmnet. They were
also charged with stealing the
books. They were later able, how
ever. to prove that tHe books were
donated to them by northerners
sympathetic to the movement.

new stale police academy, will
cost $-1 million.
OFFICIALS at the Council of
Federated Organizations' (COFO)
headquarters in Jackson have
charged that harrassment of their
aetivites has increased greatly in
the past three weeks.
Seven COFO workers, they de
clared, were arrested Friday night
in Belzoni on suspicion of stealing
their own car.
Seven others, COFO said, were
arrested recently in Hattiesburg
for picketing. Hattiesburg police
claimed they violated the state's
anti-picketing law because 'too
many were picketing."
Five students were arrested
while transporting books to Holly
Springs for the Summer Project's
library there. A COFO worker
told The Daily that the students
were charged with carrying books
that advocated the overthrow of
the state governmnet. They were
also charged with stealing the
books. They were later able, how
ever. to prove that tHe books were
donated to them by northerners
sympathetic to the movement.
The Mississippi legislature is expected speedily to pass a l>ill
re(|uiring all persons who plan to conduct "schools or community
centers for certain subjects to tile affidavits with the state outlin
ing their purpose.
The state can then decide whether to grant permission to the

applicants.
"AND THEY most certainly
won't to those of us who will be
working on the Mississippi |civil
rights| Project." reported Rick
Seifert, a Stanford student now
working with the lights move
ment in Jackon, Miss.
In a telephone interview wit h
The Daily, Seifert said: "This bill
was aimed right at us. When
Senators Dye and Collins intro
duced it. they simply said. 'You
know what l his is for.' There has
been no debate."
The penalty stipulated in the
bill is "not more than 60 days and
not more than $200."
MISSISSIPPI'S legislature "has
turned out a number of other
laws directed against the Sum
mer Project," Seifert pointed out.
Among them:
• A law permitting quarantines
to restrict the movement of citi
zens "when there is imminent
danger to public safety."
• A law making it a felony to
circulate material that encourages
boycotts.
• A law allowing communities
to lend "police equipment" to each
other in the event of civil dis
turbances.
• An appropriation providing
for 200 extra highway patrolmen
bringing the total force up to
•175. The measure, when coupled
with the construction price of a
new stale police academy, will
cost $-1 million.
