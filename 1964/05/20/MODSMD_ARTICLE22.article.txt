# Political Union Power Grab Should Be Stopped
## Editorial 
### 
The Political Union is engaged in a
power grab.
Its officers are trying to disenfranchise
political groups on campus from their tradi
tional voice in the choice of Poli U officers.
Their action is only compounded by the fact
that they are trying to do it in a manner
which is itself unconstitutional.
At the last LASSU meeting, a proposed
amendment to the Poli U by-laws was off
ered for approval which, if adopted, would
make the Poli U a self-perpetuating body of
five, in which the criterion for success would
of necessity be pleasing the incumbent bu
reaucrats.
THE WHOLE situation stems from the
year-old University policy of allowing "par
tisan political groups" to use on-campus fa
cilities. As a matter of fact, that policy was
a result of the adoption last year of a new

ASSU constitution, under which the ASSU
gave up its power to approve or disapprove
groups seeking on-canipus status.
The Poli U executive board met to up
date their by-laws, in light of the new ASSU
constitution and new University policy.
The executive board of Political Union,
which theretofore had been comprised of
both Political Union officers and chairmen
of the caucuses, was reduced to consist
merely of the Poli U officers. But it was
unanimously agreed to give caucus (now
group) chairmen a vote in electing new offi
cers and in changing the by-laws.
Needless to say, the former would not
have survived without the latter, because
Poli. U could simply amend the by-laws at
the first opportunity to disenfranchise the
groups.
In the present instance, what was feared

is exactly what happened. The Poli U offi
cers took it upon themselves to eliminate
the caucuses (now "groups") front any voice
whatsoever in Poli U. And they did so in an
unconstitutional manner, without notifying
groups of an intent to change the by-laws.
Unfortunately for the Poli U officers, the
president of one of the groups happened to
be attending the LASSU meeting when the
bill came up for a second reading. When he
raised an objection and pointed out how Poli
U had. flaunted their own by-laws, the bill
was unanimously tabled.
REBUFFED BY 7 the tabling of the by
laws proposal, the Poli U officers have now
gone ahead and scheduled the spring elec

tion. When? 10:30 p.m. Thursday, May 28
—an hour-und-a-half before dead week!
Just a coincidence that Tlw Daily will
have ceased publication then?
Just a coincidence that LASSU will not
he able to pass upon the results (as constitu
tionally required) until fall quarter?
Just an oversight that the "sufficient pub
licity" required by their by-laws consisted
only of an unobtrusive OATQ announce
ment, which tried to disguise the fact that
groups have votes in the election?
The important issue here is the structure
of the political situation on this campus. The
Board of Trustees policy revision last spring
was caused by ASSU action and the express
intent of the ASSU to eliminate student con
trol over other student groups.
THE CHAIRMEN of the on-eainpus
political groups have never been consulted

about a viable policy toward them. Several
have shown great reluctance to come on
campus because of University and ASSU
regulations. The present system of Poli U
regulation is unrealistic and duplicative.
Since the University Committee on Public
Exercises assumes responsibility for sched*
uling programs and preventing conflicts,
there is no reason that l J oli U should do the
same.
In addition, there is no reason that a
group should have all its affairs subject to
ASSU or University regulation just because
it conducts a part—often a minor part—of
its activities on campus.
lu short, we ask for a liberalization ol
both University and ASSU policies toward
voluntary political groups.
We also ask that Poli U end its shenani
gans.
