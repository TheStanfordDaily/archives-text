## The 						Annual Student Art Show: A Live Bird In Academe 
### Raymond A. Prier 
A university without artists is a university without the unit}'
ol creativity, with no value and little meaning. The artist we de
mand in biochemistry many times is a phenomenon too subtle to
be judged, but if the fine arts thrive in academe, rest assured that
the more obscure nests are not as dead as they might appear.
The Stanford art gallery, so long a receptacle of the mediocre
has turned its blank walls over to students, and once again this
generation has proven that what our elders can do with more
technique we can do with more understanding.
THE STUDENT ART SHOW displays pieces so bad they
might be good and so good that the kudos of the entire university
should well up in admiration. Strewn throughout the serious slip
lighter, more playful intermezzi (Loquereir's sunning Stanford
bush, Golden's feather-light cloud of fanciful seabirds, Dutton's
aristocratically fragile still life, Hughes' web-caught lithograph)—
even these show a refinement of sensitivity little anticipated by
the more vitriolic critics of the Stanford scene, and where Cortriglit
literal!) presents us with garbage in his unfocused and old-maidish
attempts on canvas, his 'Goldwater-or-bust' candler's nightmare
is probably one of the funniest things in the world of art where a
horselaugh can still destroy petunia-faced paranoics.
The really bad is ensconced somewhere between Moore, Ba
laam, and a disasterously arranged rear gallery which buries the
real potential of Begstrom's Tree-scape in a mass of diffusion ac
cented by the chartreuse and blood error of Mrs. Harold. Mr.
Moore, if you must ape Boyle at least develop some sense of color.
Miss Balaam, switch out of pastels.
ENOUGH OF THE ILL, for in our midst moves sensibility
and craftmanship we have never suspected. Louis Mendelowitz
who scores but a partial success with his Two While Men in Red
( hind has created two outstanding, almost lyrical, works in bronze.
In a happy wedding of the artist and designer, Williams with a
care and richness seen now here else displays two perfect goblets
in red velvet. Noel Bennett balances the best study in the show,
her Piruncsiesque, with a drawing of childhood itself. Keep an
eye on her. She can't miss.
However, il it were the case—and it's not—that not one other
work passed the level of Grandma Moses—do I dare say Margaret
Keane?—the three chef-d'oeuvres of Tom Lerrigo would be well
worth the time required to understand and appreciate this show.
In a consummate artistry, a highly-communicative synthesis of
color and symbol, power and tenderness, this artist—he's made the
grade, admit it—has created three of the most integral and satisfy
ing works of art you II ever experience. Intermediaries as they are
between the sensual and the ideal they reveal paths Stanford
treads but seldom knows it's reached.

The show \\ill remain on display in the University Art Gallery
through May 23. The second part of annual exhibit will be a dis
play of works of architectural students and will show May 29 to
June I I. Art Gallery hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through
Saturday; and 1 to 5 p.m. on Sunday.
