## Belli Audience Has Duty To Judge 
### 
| Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Collins' unfair criticism of
I Melvin Belli which appeared in
; Monday's Daily contains inade
; quacies impossible to ignore.
His only lucid point seems to
| be that a student had mistakenly
referred to Mr. Belli as "one of
! the great minds of law." Mr. Belli
| would probably not be classified
as one of the great minds of law
I (whatever that is). But at this
point Mr. Collins efficacy stops.
fie claims in the next sentence
that Mr. Belli managed to "com
pare Ruby to Jesus Christ . . .
several times." The only thing
Mr. Belli said about Jack Ruby
several times was that the man
had brain damage and that evi
dence to that fact was available.
(Perhaps Mr. Collins is prepared
to state that Christ had brain
damage.)
Mr. Collins then claims that he
was puzzled over how Mr. Belli
had been able to "dupe juries" un
til he got a first hand view. < 1 >
This was definitely not a court
room situation. (2) Whatever hu
mor or association Mr. Belli used
cannot be criticized as though this
were a courtroom situation; Mr.
Belli's purpose was to give his
frank and personal opinions of
the situation in which he was one
of the major participants.
Mr. Collins seems disturbed
that Mr. Belli was able to "obtain
$300,000 for his client who had
been called a dirty name."
Mr. Collins neglects to mention
(1) that the client was a judge,
(2) that the case concerned the
printing of the "dirty word" in a
newspaper, (3) (and most impor
tant) that the defense in this case
was unable to prove that the
money should not be awarded.
Are we to assume from Mr. Col
lins' statements that Mi*. Belli is
a flamboyant fiend who if left to
his own course would destroy
justice. The fact remains that no
matter how flamboyant Mr. Belli
chooses to be in a courtroom he
would never, under our laws, be
unopposed.

| Mr. Belli has obviously de
veloped his own communicative
| powers to a very high level. It is,
therefore, the duty of his listen
ers to weigh the man and his
ideas against their own concepts
of justice and fair play.
Of course, to get a complete
picture of the event the student
should be exposed to ,the entire
opposing side of the Dallas situa
i lion. Mr. Collins' irresponsible
I criticism can only confuse the
I mat ter.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing letter was sent to Stan
lord Foreign Student Adviser
Werner Warm brum. It is an
appeal lor volunteers to teach
in the Awo Omamma Educa
tion Project In Nigeria.
Volunteers should have a mini
mum of a masters' degree or a
strong bachelors' degree and
should be able 1o teach any of the
following subjects: English Lan
guage. English Literature,
French. Chemistry, Physics, Biol
ogy. Mathematics, Metal work,
any branch of Engineering, Sur
vey, Architecture and Mechanics,
Agriculture, Stenography, Busi
ness, Accounts, Home Economics
or general elementary school sub
jects. Volunteers should be able
to pay their passage to Nigeria,
but a return fare will be guaran
teed by the Project. Also a salary
approved by the Ministry of Edu
cation will be paid by the project.
This ranges from 1,300 dollars to
2,."500 dollars and is usually very
ample for life in Eastern Nigeria.
This is an opportunity for
young men and women who are
desirous of enhancing their
knowledge and experience.
Those interested should address
their requests to Dr. B. Uzoukwu

Editor, The Daily:
I am at a loss to understand
what Stephen Shefler mean s
when he states in his May 18 col
umn: "the negativism of the Lan
don. Taft, Goldwater school." Ac
cording to the Wall Street Jour
nal: "(Senator Goldwater's) prin-
J oiples include emphasis on in
dividual dignity and freedom and
action instead of Federal paternal
ism ... to show that the GOP
... is a party of limited Govern
ment and regard for the individ
ual . . ." That sounds quite posi
tive to me.
When will Shefler stop insult
ing his readers' intelligence by
improperly manipulating rational
categories to his own advantage,
inappropriate categories such as
"positive and "negative" w hi c h
only obscure clear perspectives on
political positions? What he calls
"negative" I may call "positive,"
etc. For Shefler, "negativism" is
only a polemic in disguise.
To the list of Rousseau, Mon
tesquieu, and Hume he should
add Hegel and carefully read the
latter's Phenomenology of Mind
to learn all about "positive" and
"negative."

Since I am in the habit of writ
ing letters to the editor mostly of
a critical nature, it gives me great
pleasure, for a change to be able
to write one of praise, it concerns
the cafeteria in Tresidder Union,
which I .just noticed in the "Daily"
is managed by a student-run

The food in the cafeteria is ex

Werner Warm brum. It is an
appeal lor volunteers to teach
in the Awo Omamma Educa
tion Project In Nigeria.
Volunteers should have a mini
mum of a masters' degree or a
strong bachelors' degree and
should be able 1o teach any of the
following subjects: English Lan
guage. English Literature,
French. Chemistry, Physics, Biol
ogy. Mathematics, Metal work,
any branch of Engineering, Sur
vey, Architecture and Mechanics,
Agriculture, Stenography, Busi

teed by the Project. Also a salary
approved by the Ministry of Edu
cation will be paid by the project.
This ranges from 1,300 dollars to

I am at a loss to understand
what Stephen Shefler mean s
when he states in his May 18 col
umn: "the negativism of the Lan
don. Taft, Goldwater school." Ac
cording to the Wall Street Jour
nal: "(Senator Goldwater's) prin-
J oiples include emphasis on in
dividual dignity and freedom and
action instead of Federal paternal
ism ... to show that the GOP
... is a party of limited Govern
ment and regard for the individ
ual . . ." That sounds quite posi
tive to me.
When will Shefler stop insult
ing his readers' intelligence by
improperly manipulating rational
categories to his own advantage,
inappropriate categories such as
"positive and "negative" w hi c h
only obscure clear perspectives on
political positions? What he calls
"negative" I may call "positive,"
etc. For Shefler, "negativism" is
only a polemic in disguise.
To the list of Rousseau, Mon
tesquieu, and Hume he should
add Hegel and carefully read the
latter's Phenomenology of Mind
to learn all about "positive" and
"negative."

Mr. Collins' unfair criticism of
I Melvin Belli which appeared in
; Monday's Daily contains inade
; quacies impossible to ignore.
His only lucid point seems to
| be that a student had mistakenly
referred to Mr. Belli as "one of
! the great minds of law." Mr. Belli
| would probably not be classified
as one of the great minds of law
I (whatever that is). But at this
point Mr. Collins efficacy stops.
fie claims in the next sentence
that Mr. Belli managed to "com
pare Ruby to Jesus Christ . . .
several times." The only thing
Mr. Belli said about Jack Ruby
several times was that the man
had brain damage and that evi
dence to that fact was available.
(Perhaps Mr. Collins is prepared
to state that Christ had brain
damage.)
Mr. Collins then claims that he
was puzzled over how Mr. Belli
had been able to "dupe juries" un
til he got a first hand view. < 1 >
This was definitely not a court
room situation. (2) Whatever hu
mor or association Mr. Belli used
cannot be criticized as though this
were a courtroom situation; Mr.
Belli's purpose was to give his
frank and personal opinions of
the situation in which he was one
of the major participants.
Mr. Collins seems disturbed
that Mr. Belli was able to "obtain
$300,000 for his client who had
been called a dirty name."
Mr. Collins neglects to mention
(1) that the client was a judge,
(2) that the case concerned the
printing of the "dirty word" in a
newspaper, (3) (and most impor
tant) that the defense in this case
was unable to prove that the
money should not be awarded.
Are we to assume from Mr. Col
lins' statements that Mi*. Belli is
a flamboyant fiend who if left to
his own course would destroy
justice. The fact remains that no
matter how flamboyant Mr. Belli
chooses to be in a courtroom he
would never, under our laws, be
unopposed.

| Mr. Belli has obviously de
veloped his own communicative
| powers to a very high level. It is,
therefore, the duty of his listen
ers to weigh the man and his
ideas against their own concepts
of justice and fair play.
Of course, to get a complete
picture of the event the student
should be exposed to ,the entire
opposing side of the Dallas situa
i lion. Mr. Collins' irresponsible

Mr. Collins' unfair criticism of
I Melvin Belli which appeared in
; Monday's Daily contains inade
; quacies impossible to ignore.
His only lucid point seems to
| be that a student had mistakenly
referred to Mr. Belli as "one of
! the great minds of law." Mr. Belli
| would probably not be classified
as one of the great minds of law
I (whatever that is). But at this
point Mr. Collins efficacy stops.
fie claims in the next sentence
that Mr. Belli managed to "com
pare Ruby to Jesus Christ . . .
several times." The only thing
Mr. Belli said about Jack Ruby
several times was that the man
had brain damage and that evi
dence to that fact was available.
(Perhaps Mr. Collins is prepared
to state that Christ had brain
damage.)
Mr. Collins then claims that he
was puzzled over how Mr. Belli
had been able to "dupe juries" un
til he got a first hand view. < 1 >
This was definitely not a court
room situation. (2) Whatever hu
mor or association Mr. Belli used
cannot be criticized as though this
were a courtroom situation; Mr.
Belli's purpose was to give his
frank and personal opinions of
the situation in which he was one
of the major participants.
Mr. Collins seems disturbed
that Mr. Belli was able to "obtain
$300,000 for his client who had
been called a dirty name."
Mr. Collins neglects to mention
(1) that the client was a judge,
(2) that the case concerned the
printing of the "dirty word" in a
newspaper, (3) (and most impor
tant) that the defense in this case
was unable to prove that the
money should not be awarded.
Are we to assume from Mr. Col
lins' statements that Mi*. Belli is
a flamboyant fiend who if left to
his own course would destroy
justice. The fact remains that no
matter how flamboyant Mr. Belli
chooses to be in a courtroom he
would never, under our laws, be
unopposed.

| Mr. Belli has obviously de
veloped his own communicative
| powers to a very high level. It is,
therefore, the duty of his listen
ers to weigh the man and his
ideas against their own concepts
of justice and fair play.
Of course, to get a complete
picture of the event the student
should be exposed to ,the entire
opposing side of the Dallas situa
i lion. Mr. Collins' irresponsible
I criticism can only confuse the
I mat ter.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing letter was sent to Stan
lord Foreign Student Adviser
Werner Warm brum. It is an
appeal lor volunteers to teach
in the Awo Omamma Educa
tion Project In Nigeria.
Volunteers should have a mini
mum of a masters' degree or a
strong bachelors' degree and
should be able 1o teach any of the
following subjects: English Lan
guage. English Literature,
French. Chemistry, Physics, Biol
ogy. Mathematics, Metal work,
any branch of Engineering, Sur
vey, Architecture and Mechanics,
Agriculture, Stenography, Busi
ness, Accounts, Home Economics
or general elementary school sub
jects. Volunteers should be able
to pay their passage to Nigeria,
but a return fare will be guaran
teed by the Project. Also a salary
approved by the Ministry of Edu
cation will be paid by the project.
This ranges from 1,300 dollars to
2,."500 dollars and is usually very
ample for life in Eastern Nigeria.
This is an opportunity for
young men and women who are
desirous of enhancing their
knowledge and experience.
Those interested should address
their requests to Dr. B. Uzoukwu

I am at a loss to understand
what Stephen Shefler mean s
when he states in his May 18 col
umn: "the negativism of the Lan
don. Taft, Goldwater school." Ac
cording to the Wall Street Jour
nal: "(Senator Goldwater's) prin-
J oiples include emphasis on in
dividual dignity and freedom and
action instead of Federal paternal
ism ... to show that the GOP
... is a party of limited Govern
ment and regard for the individ
ual . . ." That sounds quite posi
tive to me.
When will Shefler stop insult
ing his readers' intelligence by
improperly manipulating rational
categories to his own advantage,
inappropriate categories such as
"positive and "negative" w hi c h
only obscure clear perspectives on
political positions? What he calls
"negative" I may call "positive,"
etc. For Shefler, "negativism" is
only a polemic in disguise.
To the list of Rousseau, Mon

add Hegel and carefully read the
