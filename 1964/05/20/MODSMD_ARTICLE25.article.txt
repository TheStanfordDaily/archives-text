## 'Rocky' Fells Oregon... But Can He Topple California? 
### Walter Beebe 
Who knows? At least it doesn't take a Teddy White to realize
that both Rockefeller and Goldwater tliink their side can win —
otherwise they wouldn't have come this far. As Newsweek and
others have pointed out, California will decide it. W'itli Califor
nia's 86 delegates, Goldwater would have ill least 600 votes on
the first ballot, and if a bandwagon hasn't formed bv then it cer
tainly will on the second ballot when the favorite sons have to re
lease more pro-Barry strength than he will lose.
Hnt il Rockefeller wins California, the convention will pick a
moderate because Goldwater does not have enough reserves to
build up from the 515 or so votes he would start with to the 655
needed.
11 IS I'OR'I UNATE for Rocky that this was a long campaign.
His steady, intellectual, thoughtful style takes a while to sink in.
In Oregon, and perhaps in California, more voters than polls
reach are impressed by the approach to government that he rep
resents.
in Oregon's primary last Friday, most of the 93,000 voting for
Rockefeller (78,000 for Lodge, 50,000 for Goldwater, and 48,000
for Nixon) probably represent the thinking man's vote. American
political campaigns today have to appeal to the college or self
educated man simply because there are so many of them; alumni
oi Stanford and the few other institutions graduating sceptical
adults probably accounted for Rocky's strength in Oregon.
A candidate who devotes his only political speech on the pen
insula to the merits and demerits of the U.N. is bound to impress
people that this is how they want the President's office run.
The days of hoop and hollar candidates who could buffalo
their way into office are over, at least for the Presidency.
Lodge, Nixon and Scranton supporters are in an interesting
trap. Before Oregon they eoukl safely back Nelson completely
in California because he was apparently no threat at the Conven
tion. Now they still have to back him to keep their hopes alive
and the Lodge field workers now have been told to call the Rocke
feller offices and plug for him.
EISENHOWER is in the same delicate position. Apparently
he favors Scranton and disfavors Goldwater, but hopes that the
other moderates will fight the good fight so that his boy will have
a chance at the Convention. If Ike decides that his endorsement is
needed to put Rocky over the top, he just might surprise everyone
and give it.
Although Rockefeller antagonized him in 1960 by suggesting
that his presidency had represented less than perfect government,
Ike supports the same Republican tradition that Rocky has been
working to preserve.
Oregon may show that the wheels of a moderate bandw agon
are starting to turn. The moderate's message, to put it plainly,
just sits better with those who think about it aw hile.

lease more pro-Barry strength than he will lose.
Hnt il Rockefeller wins California, the convention will pick a
moderate because Goldwater does not have enough reserves to
build up from the 515 or so votes he would start with to the 655
needed.
11 IS I'OR'I UNATE for Rocky that this was a long campaign.
His steady, intellectual, thoughtful style takes a while to sink in.
In Oregon, and perhaps in California, more voters than polls
reach are impressed by the approach to government that he rep
resents.
in Oregon's primary last Friday, most of the 93,000 voting for
Rockefeller (78,000 for Lodge, 50,000 for Goldwater, and 48,000
for Nixon) probably represent the thinking man's vote. American
political campaigns today have to appeal to the college or self
educated man simply because there are so many of them; alumni
oi Stanford and the few other institutions graduating sceptical
adults probably accounted for Rocky's strength in Oregon.
A candidate who devotes his only political speech on the pen
insula to the merits and demerits of the U.N. is bound to impress
people that this is how they want the President's office run.
The days of hoop and hollar candidates who could buffalo
their way into office are over, at least for the Presidency.
Lodge, Nixon and Scranton supporters are in an interesting
trap. Before Oregon they eoukl safely back Nelson completely
in California because he was apparently no threat at the Conven
tion. Now they still have to back him to keep their hopes alive
and the Lodge field workers now have been told to call the Rocke
feller offices and plug for him.
EISENHOWER is in the same delicate position. Apparently
he favors Scranton and disfavors Goldwater, but hopes that the
other moderates will fight the good fight so that his boy will have
a chance at the Convention. If Ike decides that his endorsement is
needed to put Rocky over the top, he just might surprise everyone
and give it.
Although Rockefeller antagonized him in 1960 by suggesting
that his presidency had represented less than perfect government,
Ike supports the same Republican tradition that Rocky has been
working to preserve.
Oregon may show that the wheels of a moderate bandw agon
are starting to turn. The moderate's message, to put it plainly,
just sits better with those who think about it aw hile.

Who knows? At least it doesn't take a Teddy White to realize
that both Rockefeller and Goldwater tliink their side can win —
otherwise they wouldn't have come this far. As Newsweek and
others have pointed out, California will decide it. W'itli Califor
nia's 86 delegates, Goldwater would have ill least 600 votes on
the first ballot, and if a bandwagon hasn't formed bv then it cer
tainly will on the second ballot when the favorite sons have to re
lease more pro-Barry strength than he will lose.
