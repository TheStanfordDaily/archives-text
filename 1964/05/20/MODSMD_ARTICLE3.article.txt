### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
ASSLJ President Bud Wedin,
speaking on KZSU last night,
t er m e d University restrictions
passed this year, "a last flourish"
of the in loco partenlis doctrine
on this campus.
Wedin predicted that such re
strictive policies as have been
adopted by th e Administration
would eventually be dropped.
"We've made long term gains and
these things will fall by the way
side," lie said, although he does
not expect the change to be im
mediate.
THE ASSU President singled
out five policies which he felt
represented "an unfortunate re
action by the University, to the
new student attitude of "involve
ment. action, and questioning."
These include the statement by
the Board of Trustees on Sep
tember 19. 1963, "attendance at
the University is a privilege and
not a right," and the change in
open house policy which Wedin
said represents a regression in
the direction of a more strict Uni
versity policy of in loco parentis,
a development which, if carried
too much farther, will indeed
prove detrimental to Stanford
University."
A recent policy adopted by the
University regulating speakers in
individual living groups was also
criticized by the President.
WEDIN ALSO mentioned the
policy on registration of volun
tary groups, which he said could
provide "a framework which
could lend itself all too easily to
University censorship." Wed in
added (hat another policy on stu
dent demonstration has been pro
posed by the Administration
which is "negative and restrictive
in character and which again
limits the flexibilty which one
would hope the University would
afford to its students."
