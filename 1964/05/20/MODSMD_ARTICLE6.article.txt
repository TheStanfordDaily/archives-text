Islam, the religion of inhabi
tants of one fifth of the earth's
surface, is a primary factor in to
day's struggle between East and
West. This was emphasized in
last night's talk. "The Caliphs
and the Colonels: Islam Yester
day and Today," given by George
Rent/, Curator of the Hoover In
stitution's Middle East Collection.
This religion now prevails in
much of the northern half of
Africa and the southern half of
Asia, he said. It has gone far be
yond its Arabian origins, and its
present-day followers include
members of the earth's three
main races. Its "opposition to rac
ial discrimination" is one of the
sources of its appeal.
THE MOSLEM world is experi
encing many changes, according
to Rentz. The present seculariza-.
tion of traditionally theocratic
governments in the Moslem
world is "as momentous a change
as the separation of church and
state ... in Europe." New consti
tutions and legal systems derived
from foreign sourccs are now
being established.
"We must reexamine our eval
uation of contemporary rulers as
mere military dictators and ex
travagant kings," Rentz said. The
monarchs and colonels "are
largely products of a system
deeply rooted in the Islamic past.
THE CALIPHS and Mohammed
himself were men of the sword."
Military rule, though possibly not
the best or the most desirable" is
"not the worst or the most repre
hensible."
Socialism is also rooted in Is
lamic tradition. Arabs say the
Prophet was the first Socialist,
and their Socialism is therefore
"indigenous rather than bor
rowed."
