# IIR Book Commitment Is Unfulfilled
## Promised Books Not Collected 
### JON ROISE 
! The lIR Desk, which last fall
j agreed to supply about ten Af
! rican and Asian universities with
i some needed books, lias suddenly
i discovered that it has more prom- j
ises than volumes on its hands, j
According to former lIR Area'
Projects Chairman Jin Haas, thej
j National Student Association and I
I the Asia Foundaton last year
i asked the* Stanford group if they j
! would be willing to supply refer-!
I once books to some twenty for-1
eign universities.
THE lIR AGREED, and sent
; letters to the various universities
requesting that they each send
j lists of 750 needed volume, of
| which the lIR would attempt to
j supply about 500.
Kay Weisman, who was Over
j seas Books Chairman for the lIR
! fall quarter, stated to The Daily
that most of the universities re-'
i
i plied; however, she added, due to
| foreign publication, many of the
j books were unobtainable. In ad-;
l dition, to complicate the situa
! tion. some of the lists were lost
! over the summer.
In the meanwhile, no action was !
taken to contact any American j
| publishers, who were to be re-1
quested to contribute the needed I
! books. [
THEN, RECENTLY, one of the 112
I universities in Tanganyika wrote
i the Stanford group, asking when
| it could expect delivery of thej
j books. The lIR found itself in an
[embarrassing positon. It could. I
| said Haas, either, send letters oi
j regret to the universities, or start i
! contacting publishers.
j As of now, nothing lias been
i done. However, Jeff Mason, who i
j was recently elected to Haas'j
j former postion, hopes to see the
I project completed.
"I INTEND to appoint a new J
book charman." he lokl The)
Daily," "and, although its late in
the year, I plan to see that the;
lIR gets the universities then
books as soon as possible. We'll
meet our commitment, if I have
anything to say about it."
