THE LIVING WORD OF GOD
In the Bible Jesus Christ is called the "Word of Cod (Greek: Logos).
This implies that Christ is the expression and manifestation ol the iu
f I visible God in full and complete form:
"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and !
the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came
into being through Him; and apart from Him nothing came into heing
that lias come into heing . . . And the Word became flesh, and dwelt
among us. and we beheld His glory, glory as the Only Begotten from
the father, full of grace and truth." (John 1:1-3. 14).
Logos is used not only to rctrr to Jesus Christ, the Living Word, but
also to refer to the written Word which is the Bible.
' lint tlie \\ ord of the Lord abides forever, and this is the Word which
| was preached to you." (I Peter 1:2).
Tor the Word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness,
but to us who are being saved it is thi' power of Cod." (I Cor. 1: IS).
'Sanctify them iu the truth; the Word is truth." (John 17:17.
"I leaven and earth shall pass away, but my Words shall not pass
away." (Matt. 24:35).
\o amount of scholarship, human reasoning, or intellectual gymnas-
I ties has ever ied a person to Cod or to a deep understanding of the
Word. Cod reveals Himself only to those who receive on faith Jesus
Christ, acknowledging and confessing Him as Lord and Saviour.
Let no man deceive himself, II any man among you thinks that he
is wise in (his age, let him become loolish that he may become wise.
lor tlie wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. I"or it is written.
He is the one who catches the wise in their craftiness' and again 'the
Lord knows the reasonings ol the wise, that they are useless' . (1 Cor.
j 2:18-20).
It you haven't personally accepted Jesus Christ, the Living Word ol
God. vou can hardly expect to understand His written Word. But after
becoming a horn-again believer, the Holy Spirit will teach you as you
! read tl ic Bible:
"But the Helper, the Hob Spirit, whom the Father will send in Mv
name Hew ill teach you all ihings, and bring to your remembrance all
that I said to you . . . that is the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him, but you know
II mi because He abides with you and will be in you." (John I I:26, 27) .
"Therefore, I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit
of God says 'Jesus is accursed': and no one can say 'Jesus is Lord except
by the I loly Spirit."' (I Cor. 12:3).
The one ultimate reality, the one prime fact in this universe is not
man nor his wisdom, it is the Living Lord of all—Jesus Christ, "the wis
j dom of Cod.' ip«
"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, tomorrow and forever.
I (Heb. 13.8).

THE LIVING WORD OF GOD
In the Bible Jesus Christ is called the "Word of Cod (Greek: Logos).
This implies that Christ is the expression and manifestation ol the iu
f I visible God in full and complete form:
"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and !
the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came
into being through Him; and apart from Him nothing came into heing
that lias come into heing . . . And the Word became flesh, and dwelt
among us. and we beheld His glory, glory as the Only Begotten from
the father, full of grace and truth." (John 1:1-3. 14).
Logos is used not only to rctrr to Jesus Christ, the Living Word, but
also to refer to the written Word which is the Bible.
' lint tlie \\ ord of the Lord abides forever, and this is the Word which
| was preached to you." (I Peter 1:2).
Tor the Word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness,
but to us who are being saved it is thi' power of Cod." (I Cor. 1: IS).
'Sanctify them iu the truth; the Word is truth." (John 17:17.
"I leaven and earth shall pass away, but my Words shall not pass
away." (Matt. 24:35).
\o amount of scholarship, human reasoning, or intellectual gymnas-
I ties has ever ied a person to Cod or to a deep understanding of the
Word. Cod reveals Himself only to those who receive on faith Jesus
Christ, acknowledging and confessing Him as Lord and Saviour.
Let no man deceive himself, II any man among you thinks that he
is wise in (his age, let him become loolish that he may become wise.
lor tlie wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. I"or it is written.
He is the one who catches the wise in their craftiness' and again 'the
Lord knows the reasonings ol the wise, that they are useless' . (1 Cor.
j 2:18-20).
It you haven't personally accepted Jesus Christ, the Living Word ol
God. vou can hardly expect to understand His written Word. But after
becoming a horn-again believer, the Holy Spirit will teach you as you
! read tl ic Bible:
"But the Helper, the Hob Spirit, whom the Father will send in Mv
name Hew ill teach you all ihings, and bring to your remembrance all
that I said to you . . . that is the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him, but you know
II mi because He abides with you and will be in you." (John I I:26, 27) .
"Therefore, I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit
of God says 'Jesus is accursed': and no one can say 'Jesus is Lord except
by the I loly Spirit."' (I Cor. 12:3).
