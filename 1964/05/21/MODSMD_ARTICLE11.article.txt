# 1964 QUAD Recaptures Stanford in Photo Essay
## 
### BOB BJORING 
Stanford in the spring is a lovely experience. This year's
Quad recaptures this and other Stanford experiences worth
remembering.
Under a striking black cover, head photographer Ralph
Peer II has constructed a fair photo essay. The idea is a some
what overused one: what we remember about Stanford. The
captions are over-sentimental and occasionally obtuse. But the
pictures are beautiful.
ESSAYS LIKE THESE cannot be comprehensive. They are
not intended to be. Next year's head photographer. Bruce Wil
cox, has compared them to poetry's "compression." Yet one
still misses important scenes like the Hydrofollies. And in a
book dedicated to the late President Kennedy, scattered pictures
of student reaction to his death, sometimes misplaced, and a
short paragraph under "traditions" are not enough.
In many sections pictures are simply out of place or incor
rectly captioned. A photograph of a window in the Memorial
Church depicting the crucifixion and Mary Magdalen is cap
tioned "Memorial Church is a non-denominational church,
where campus services are held every week." Above it is a
picture of the Red Vest Band, and a short paragraph on the page
describes the Chapparul.
ORGANIZATIONS, by their nature, make for uninteresting
pictures. This year's Quad staff rose to the occasion. Interest
ing poses were tried. Several groups are shown doing some
thing. The Latter Day Saints were shot during a party.
Variety seems to have been a key for the Quad staff mem
bers this year. The seniors, as tradition decrees, have their
portraits in color. An engineering professor is shown looking
confused. Fraternity candids are illuminating. If this is some
times carried to extremes, as when a Wilbur bookshelf is titled,
"What was the Zeta Psi house had an ideal location on the
banks of Lake Lag," nevertheless it makes for interesting look
ing and reading.
Every creation has faults. One Junior Queen is very poorly
photographed. Two Daily staff members have their faces cut
in half by the bottom of a page. The wrong date is given for
Big Game. Dean Walker's picture is captioned as Dean Gor
don's.
YET THESE ARE small things. The Quad has pretty pic
tures. It has funny copy. It has portraits of all your friends.
It has memories of the year gone by.
Overall, it makes for pleasant leading and remembering.
