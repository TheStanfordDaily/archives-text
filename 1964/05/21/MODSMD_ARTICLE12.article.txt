# Kaiser Scores Waste
## 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
Leland Kaiser, Republican can
didate for U.S. Senator, mounted
the white palomino of American
ism yesterday afternoon in a
speech at Cubberley Auditorium â– 
and gave his audience a breathtak- \
ing ride through governmental
junkyard of "immorality, ineffi-!
ciency. and incompetency."
Representing himself as the di
alectical synthesis of "the hard-1
h e a d e d . pragmatic, economical
businessman" and the "church
going. highly ethical human being
with a highly developed social
consciousness," Kaiser forged an j
aggressive attack against both
state and federal administrations
on a whole gamut of foreign and j
domestic policies.
ALWAYS e m p h a si z in g an
"American first, ethical" outlook
toward political issues, he decried
aid to communist nations, t he i
"wheat swindle" with the Soviet
Union, "aequisence to ephemeral j
world opinion" and called a "real- j
istic" foreign policy.
lie asked that we need to "call
our friends friends, our enemies!
enemies, and neutralists neutral
ists. and treat each of them accord
ing to our own best interest.
On domestic issues, Kaiser ex- j
eoriated the theories of the Keyne
viiui school ol economics as the

"silliest thing I have ever seen,"
and asked the audienee rhetoric
ally whether "anyone can cite one
instance where these policies have
worked without leading to wild in
flation."
NO ONE responded.
"I have nothing against theo
ries," he said, "only theories that
don't work practically and prag
matically."
Shooting straight from tin* hip.
and usually getting his gun fully
out of the holster, Kaiser gave
many instance of a "widespread
immorality" in government, in
cluding a million metric tons of
wheat "mysteriously" lost en
route to Austria.
KAISER ALSO scored t hi- ad
ministration of Gov. Brown, term
ing the Governor a man "with
seemingly no ethical standards at
all," and citing the j>eccadillos of
Brown's hrolher Harold, a regis
tered Republican.
After giving his illustrations of
governmental abuse, "fuz/y-mind
edness, soft-headedness and plain
immorality," Kaiser mused, "If
the administration were only sim
ply sofl-headed, or simply unethic
al. it would have a hard time ac
complishing this (the loss of the
shiploads of wheat to Alistraia).
But. unfortunately, it's both, a n d
it's that unbeatable combination
I'd like to try to stop."
