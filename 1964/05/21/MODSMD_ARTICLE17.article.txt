# Costumes For Play Opening
## 
### 
Five full-time hemstresses and
three part-time assistants have
been working at top speed to
make some thirty costumes in
time for the May 26th opening
night of Shakespeare's "The Two
Gentlemen of Verona" which will
play in Stanford Players Little
Theatre until May 31st.
i Mr. Douglas Russell is in
charge of the costumes. "When
J Carl Weber, the director, spoke
; of the early Renaissance simpli
city of the script, I turned to the
Italian painters of the 16th cen
tury," said Russell.
The stage design will copy
Francesca's geometric architec
ture and his central point per
spective. The costumes and the
sets_ will have matte surfaces
like* a plaster fresco. "We use
woolens and monochrome br o -
chades to get that cffcct," said
Russell. Some of the costumes
are remodelled from stock, but
the costumes for the leading
characters are built from scratch.
