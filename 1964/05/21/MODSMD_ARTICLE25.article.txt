# LAST PLACE IN CIBA
## Mason, Hibbs Standouts In Bleak Baseball Season 
### PETE KING 
Although S t a n 112 or d recently
completed its worst baseball sea
son in 18 years, there were
flashes of brilliance, most notably
the batting of sophomore catcher
Jim Hibbs, in an olherwi.se drab
season.
Hibbs wound up third in the
CII3A batting race with .348, but
ho smashed enough extra-base
hits to win the slugging title with
47 total bases, was tops in doubles
with eight, tied foi first in triples
with three, and tied for second
in home runs with three.
HIBBS' only weakness al the
plate failure to drive in runs
hurt Stanford, as he collected only
seven in the 20 league games.
Other better-than average hit
ters were outfielder Bob Cox,
with a .2% average, and first
baseman Pete Middlekauff, with

.280, who didn't play the final
five games because he broke his
right hand while chasing a foul
ball.
But Stanford's team batting
average was a sickly .219 for
league play, which is the reason
the team finished last. Five
league games were lost to oppo
nents who scored three runs or
less. Even at .219, Stanford should
have won more than four of 20
games; however, in the category
of clutch hitting, on which sta
tistics aren't kept, the Tribe prob
ably finished last.
Several stars from last year
failed to produce. First baseman
Bob Hollmann, a power hitter
last year at .278, was more than
100 points below that figure. Sec
ond baseman George Thacher
slumped from a .309 CIBA aver
age to below .250.
The pitchers allowed the most

runs in the CIBA. an average of i
six a game. Bui thai figure is de- 1
ceptive. Nearly half tho runs
came in four nightmare defeats.
STANFORD'S sophomore right
bander won tho Ken Johnson
award for rotten luck. Mason was
brilliant in defeat. Against UCLA
he struck out 10 men and lost,
1-0. Next, he fanned 13 Cal men,
but lost again, 2-0. Last weekend
Mason tried for the last time
against Santa Clara, the league's
second best hitting club. He
whiffed five, scattered seven hits,
and got one of Stanford's t wo
hits, but lost, as usual, 3-0. The
New York Mots need pitchers of
bis calibre and luck, and he may
get an offer.
Mason's earned run average
was a sparkling 2.17, seventh best
in the league and he averaged a
strikeout an inning. After him
came the team workhorse, Dick
Kovacevich. at 4.60. Reliefer Bob
Hart wig had a 2.11 average.
Stanford's weakness, then, was
not pitching. Aside from Hie bad
clutch hitting lhat left 104 men
on base, Stanford was last in
fielding and its baserunnors stole
a mere five bases iir 20 games.
That doesn'l mean they weren't
trying, but that they were thrown
out on nearly every attempt.
All in all, it was a frustrating
season for home fans, who suf
fered through 12 defeats. Coach
Dutch Fehring finds some solace
in the fact that four freshmen hit
ting .340 or better will be with
him next season to support his
12 returning pitchers.
Stanford was a young team 1 his
year, with 10 sophomores, eight
juniors and only three seniors,
which explains in large part their
18-22 record. With Stanford's best
frosh team in years to back up
the nine regular starters who will
all be back, next season will show
an improvement, hopefully.
