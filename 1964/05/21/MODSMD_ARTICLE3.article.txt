# Help Needed For Gaieties: Script Writers In Demand
## 
### 
Ram's Head's 1964 Gaieties
producer has just been elected,
and already lie is preparing for
the coming Fall (a pun perhaps).
Supplies of No-Doz and Compoz
are being laid in. Thoughts how
ever are also being turned to the
more serious side of production.
Gaieties is Ram's Head's tradi
tional Fall show sometimes bad,
sometimes good, but always hard
work, fun, and a real experience
in production (acting, writing,
publicity, business, and public re

lations) beyond the book and class
room level.
THK PRIMARY concern a t
present is the script. People who
are interested in writing, both for
aesthetic and monetary reasons,
should call) ext. 4336 and leave
their name.
They will be contacted later as
to the time of a precisely undeter
mined meeting in the latter half
of the week.
A staff is already beginning to
be assembled. Those interested in
any phase of production: business,
publicity, designing (especially

costume) directing, art, and staff
work, should call the Ram's Head
office ext. 4336 between 12 and 1
on weekdays or stop by the Ram's
Head office (second floor TMUi.
GAIETIES IS an all-Stanford
show in which nothing is sacred.
The skits are almost always mu
sical and the theme, although
somewhat I rue to life, t rys to show
the humorous aspects with the be
lief that nothing, especially in a
university, is too serious not to
have its funny side.
1964 Gaieties will be based on
this philosophy.
