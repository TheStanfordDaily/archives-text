# The 						Need For Study Space
## Editorial 
### 
Stanford is no place to study.
In quiet.
And it will remain that way until the
University recognizes the need lor better
facilities.
TIIE MAIN LIBRARY, for instance, is
about as eonducive to study as the Harlem
Tunnel at rush hour. The RBR, the stacks
and the Humanities Reading Room sutler
from an acute case of distraction — with
miserable lighting, a constant How of traf
fic and noise.
The Quad classrooms presently open
(or study have uncomfortable seats and
desks, with cramped writing space.
On the weekends the entire problem is
compounded. Most of the Quad buildings
and classrooms are locked. The library

closes on Saturday night. And the dorms,
usually noisy at any time, become prepos
terously so on weekends.
YET MANY PLACE a premium on
weekend studying. It is a time for exten
sive work without the interruption of
classes and the week-day routine. But the
availability of study places decreases at this
time — when it should increase.
The student-comprised Academic Af
fairs Committee made a brief study of the
problem in February. Their recommenda
tions:
—The Quad libraries — such as Philoso

phy, Political Science, Classics, Communi
cations — should be opened at night and
on the weekends. Most of them arc only
open now until 5 p.m., Monday through
Friday. They are comfortable, quiet — and,
unfortunately, closed too much of the time.
—Quad seminar rooms, seldom available
to students for non-class use, should be
opened.
—The private collections rooms in the
Main Library (not the manuscripts rooms)
—off limits to practically everybody practi
cally all of the time — should be opened.
The University would be wise — and, in
deed, has a responsibility — to carefully
consider these recommendations. So far,
it lias been negligent in not responding to
the glaring need for study facilities.
