## Must Faculty Publish Or Perish? 
### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: The au
thor, currently a professor of
philosophy at Tufts University,
Medford, Mass., has recently
been informed that his contract
will not be renewed due to in
sufficient publication. The fol
lowing article first appeared in
the Tufts Weekly.
By WOODROW WILSON SAVRE

Members of the Tufts Adminis
tration argue that the ideal fac
ulty member is the individual who
is both a good teacher and a pub
lishing scholar. They go on to
say that rewards in the form of
promotions, salary increases, and
tenure will go, where possible, to
those who satisfy both require
ments.
In other words, if you are
merely a good teacher you will
probably not be promoted, you
will not be given tenure, and you
will most likely get only mini
mum raises. By a hard-to-follow
logic, this is not called a policy of
"publish or perish," although for
the teacher who is let go because
of it.it is going to seem a pretty
close facsimile.
But leaving the semantics aside,
what assumptions underlie this
policy? It assumes that effective
teaching is good, that scholarly
publication is good, and that the
two combined are even better.
I have no quarrel with the first
assumption. It is the common
sense view of most people that
the main business of a teacher is
to teach. I believe the common
sense view here is also the cor
rect view.
The second assumption needs
to be looked at much harder than
it has been. In what circum
stances is scholarly publication
good? For instance, who is helped
by it ?

DO THE STUDENTS benefit?
By and large, no. The more in
volved the teacher is in research,
the less time the teacher will have
foi- the student. Preoccupation
with research may even gradu
ally throttle any interest he has
in the student and sometimes
even in (lie art of teaching itself.
Students and parents are pay
ing thousands of dollars for an
education. Haven't they the right
to expect that the main focus of
the faculty will be the growth and
development of t lie stud en t,
rather than the advancement of
the faculty member through pub
lication?
Of course all publication does
not conflict with one's teaching
duties. Especially in a graduate
school they may reinforce each
other. But all too often they do
not reinforce each other.
It may bo argued that indirectly
publication may help the student
by improving the quality of the
professor's teaching. This brings
up the next question.

DOES SCHOLARLY publica
tion benefit the teacher? Cer
tainly it enhances his reputation,
but does it improve his teaching?
More unsupported generaliza
tions have been advanced in this
question than on almost any
other. Some argue, as in a recent
article in the Boston Globe, that
it is extremely rare to have a
first-rate teacher that is not also
a first-rate scholar.
Others claim that the rare event
is to have both a gifted teacher
and a gifted scholar combined in
one person and certainly there
aren't enough of them to go
around. The truth, I think, lies
somewhere in between, but in any
event no across (lie board gen
eralizations can be made that
p u b 1 ie a t i on necessarily helps
teaching.
From, experience I know top
teachers who have never pub
lished, I do nol see how it could

be proved that they would be still
j better if they had. Also from ex
-1 perienee, I have encountered pro
-1 ii £i c publishers who we r e
wretched teachers. It is doubtful
that they would have been any
worse if they had not published.
T know that some teachers feel
that their ideas are sharpened
and clarified by the necessity of
publishing. Others find publish
ing a distraction from the busi
ness of teaching. A vast mass of
material must be mastered, much
of it of little significance. The
subject matter may have little or
no relevance to the course ma
terial. And then there is all the
Itime and energy wasted in try
ling to get someone actually to
I publish the result.

I THINK an important distinc
' tion must be made. Good teach
j ing does involve keeping up with
one's field. To reread and rethink
j old material is essential. This
i kind of scholarship, yes! But that
such research and evaluation
I should necessarily lead to publiea-
I tion has not at all been demon
st rated.
It may be the case that admin-
I istrations have no way of judg
ing whether a teacher is keep
ing up with his field except by
looking at publication. That is a

hazard they must face. It can
best be solved perhaps, by relying
on the firsthand appraisal of the
Department Chairman. But in
any case the important issue
should be: is the teacher a scholar
in the sense that he has kept
abreast of his field, not the super
ficial question: has he published?
Does scholarly publication bene
fit any other groups? In the aca
demic community today a col
lege gains status by the publica
tions of its faculty members. I
would guess that a hundred fac
ulty members who have published
would add more prestige to an
institution than would accrue if
those hundred faculty members
were simply good teachers. But
surely it is actual excellence of
teaching and s c ho 1 a r s hi p
(whether or not resulting in pub
lication) with which a university
should be concerned and not the
opinion of others.
Does scholarly publication bene
fit humanity? Well of course
much that has been published
has had tremendous significance
for the whole human race. But
even here the importance can be
exaggerated. So much is p u b
lished today that a single individ
ual can keep up with only a small
specialized part of it.
MOKE AND MORE is being
published and less and less is be

ing read and assimilated. As one
industrial research man said In
me: II is cheaper for our com
pany to run experiments tor our
selves than to search I In 1 immense
literature and discover if the ex
periment has already been done.
Practically, what does this do to
the idea of every experiment and
publication adding to the sum
total of human knowledge?
In summary, actual scholarly
publication may cheat the student
of a good deal of time and atten
tion from the faculty members
thai he might otherwise get. Cer
tainly pressure on all faculty
members to publish is going to
have this result in many cases.
Scholarly publication may help a
teacher's training, but it may hin
der it.
Certainly it is an unreliable
guide either to the teaching com
petence of a faculty member or
to the scholarship of that mem
ber. For many who have pub
lished are not really keeping up
with their field, and many who
have not published are.
Finally, although extensive pub
lications may enhance the image
of a university, it may in fact
interfere with the total enterprise
of human knowledge. Such a
flood of words and publication!
Often new publications are
started simply to serve as a ve
hicle for yet more undistinguished
articles.

Til 10 SKAKCII for truth can
drown in such a sea. I almost
think that a greater blow for real
excellence could be struck if uni
versities penalized teachers for
publishing. Let the first article
be free, but a rising schedule of
fines for each subsequent article
and a big one for a book.
At one blow this would deter
people from publishing unless
they felt they had something
really vital to say, and also it
would cut down to manageable
proportions the great yearly out
pouring of the printed word. It
would be a victory for rationality.
I will end with a brief consid
eration of liie third assumption,
namely that the combination of
effective teaching and scholarly
publication is better than either
alone. Actually I think that such
an ideal if adhered to will result
in a rather bland mediocrity. You
will tend to get teachers who are
fair at writing and who are fair
at teaching, but who are not par
ticularly outstanding at either.
By insisting that every teacher
to the degree possible be compe
tent in two arts (the art of teach
ing and the art of writing and
[publishing) you are likely im
mediately to lose those who are
outstanding in only one of these
arts.
★ ★ ★
CAN EDUCATION stand such
a policy? I think a university
needs all types. It needs great re
searchers, even if they can't
teach. And it needs gifted teach
ers, even if they can't write. It
is reasonable to balance the dif
ferent types throughout the fac
i ulty as a whole.
But the point is that if this is
clone, then no single teacher
I should be rejected merely on the
ground that he has not demon
strated both talents.
A general policy of insisting on
both teaching and publication
then is a policy that in fact will
encourage mediocrity. It immedi
ately eliminates the uniquely
gifted individual whose gifts lie
in one direction only.
It encourages the man who is
reasonably good al many things,
but is perhaps masler of none.
Only on the assumption that writ
ing and leaching are inseparably
joined together in an indissoluble
union does such a policy make
sense. But. while this may be the
ease for some individuals it pa
tently is not the imsso for all.
