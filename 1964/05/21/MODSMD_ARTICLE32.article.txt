## Need For Student Contact 
### 
Editor, Tlie Daily:
A number of members of the
faculty and staff have become
aware of a need, expressed and
unexpressed, for contact with stu
dents at a different level th a n
classroom and office hours seem
presently to afford. Questions of
the relevance and meaning of our
intellectual efforts toward per
sonal standards and 'real-world'
values seem to be of great con
cern. The need has also been ex
pressed for an environment for
discussion of these values in
which student and professor can
accept each other on a more give
and-take relationship than that
of the classroom, and one in
which the student can take more
initiative in probing these basic
questions.
The following faculty and staff
members feel that standards and
goals of lasting value are discern
ible, and invite more contact with
students to explore such issues.
Those listed are actively search
ing for ways to meet these an d
other student needs, and would
welcome suggestions.
Faculty or staff desiring fur
ther information may contact Dr.
Lagerslrom, or Dr. Kincheloe at
the Stanford Electronics Labora
tories.

• Crooks In Picture
Editor, The Daily:
May a visiting professor (of
Statistics and Genetics) register
a comment? The English lan
guage is a tool of communication
which has been evolved painstak
ingly over millenia, and should lie
treated, one would think, with the
respect it deserves. It is not some
thing to be mutilated and mis
used. Consider then, the state
ment made by Mr. Mcßride, the
next ASSU President, as reported
by Mr. Black in Friday's Daily, j
"I want to thank the 1,600 people
that voted for me, and to especi
ally thank the 150 people that
were directly involved in my cam
paign." I was led to think, before
my visit, that Stanford was one !
of the pillars of education in the
West, with real attention to the
arts, which I suppose to include i
our language. 1 infer that there 1
are some cracks in this beautiful ;
picture? Or should I infer t hat
there are no cracks, and the usage
is acceptable? I object to the sec
ond possibility and I hope th e
English faculty here would agree.
I have also been interested by
ot her correspondence dealing
with social questions. Perhaps, a
course or two in basic social |
values, including language, thei
dignity of any human being, re- I
gardless of race, color, creed, i
number of legs, 1.Q., riches, and j
so on. should be required if Stan
ford is to contribute to the lead
ership of our country, which in
cludes all our citizens. Perhaps,
also, a school like Stanford should
have remedial measures for in
dividuals who are clearly in need
of repair. I suggest that a thou
sand-word essay on "What 1
Would Do If I Were A Negro"
should be required of all students.
Or would such a measure inter
fere with the education that is
being "pumped into the students" j
here and elsewhere?
