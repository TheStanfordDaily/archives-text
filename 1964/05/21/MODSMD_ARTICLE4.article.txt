## Architecture School: Small, Growing 
### FRED WARNICK 
With ten 1o fifteen leading ar
chitects of the Bay area as a high
light to its program, Stanford has
offered a professional architectur
al degree since 1948.
This opportunity at Stanford
for students to come in contact
with several accomplished and
practicing architects is not com
mon to many schools or architec
ture. Tlit student is subjected to
a different visiting architect-critic
each quarter of his study, and
thus continuous constructive cri
ticism from varying viewspoints.
Till: SCHOOL here does not
dictate any one design philosophy,

! nor is any one "master" deliber
ately lifted to a pedestal for emula
tion. It is expected that the stu
dent can assimilate the direct in*
j spirations of t lie visiting critics
into a meaningful design sensibil-
I ity and understanding of arehi-;
lecture for himself.
In past years, visiting faculty
has included Ernest Kump, El- 1
jdridge Spencer, Edward Stone,
I Jaraslav Polivka, Robert Royston,
and Henry Elder.
The permanent faculty in archi
tecture here consists of two men,
I headed by Professor Victor j
I Thompson since 1918. Stanford j
j architecture graduate Tom Wil-
I liamson has assisted him in recent
i years.
THE RELATIVE success of the |
Stanford graduate is evidenced by
the percentage of graduates t hat |
later qualify for the state arehi- j
! tecturariieen.se about TO percent, j
higher than any other school in
the state.
Visiting critics this year include j
Henry Hill. Aaron Green, George!
Rockrise, Francis Joseph Mc-
Carthy, and Robert Marquis, all
from San Francisco. Also. Warren !
Callister from Marin County, and
; Bilge Clark. Walter Stromquist, |
i and Robert Peterson from Palo I
Alto are criticizing work at Stan-!
ford this year.
The visiting faculty give I heir;
time and effort to criticize Stan
ford classes for token honorarium,
: their only compensation.
THE ARCHITECTURAL educa
tion here emphasizes a broad lib
eral arts background, as well as
courses in architectural design,
theory, structures, met hods of con
struction, and materials. A Baehe- j
lor of Arts degree in Pro-Architec
ture is awarded to the student ,
after 1 years of study, and a Bache
lor of Architecture degree after 6 i

years.
The Pro-Architecture degree is
non-professional, and most of the
courses in the curriculum can be
taken by students majoring in
other fields.
Thompson has used the small
ness of the department to advan
tage, maintaining close student
critic contact and informal, small
classes. The visiting critic system
is not a large monetary drain, and
yet has proved highly effective.
FOR MANY years the architec
ture office was in the basement of
the Art Gallery, across from the
History Corner. Classes are still
held in the rear and along the side
of the Ai l Gallery. Recently, how
ever, some graduate students and
the architecture office itself have
moved to the old Frenchman's
Tower House on Eseondido Road.
The chief drawback in facilities
is the lack of a reasonable archi
tectural library.
Asa result of a deficient library,
and, of a low number of perma
nent staff and of a low square
footage of drafting area the
latter two reasons due primarily
to t he small ness of the depai t ment
the school is not accredited.
This is not a testimony on th e
quality of the program here, neces
sarily, but rather on the insuffici
encies of I lie administrative a n d
physical facilities, which fall short
of the standards set by the nation
al accreditation board.
TO TIIE architecture graduate,
non-accreditation means, prima
rily. that the period of apprentice
ship prior to licensing is a year
longer for him in most states.
Nevertheless, the ability to
achieve licensing has not been ap
preciably hampered, and serious
Stanford graduates have had little
difficulty in graduate architecture
work elsewhere.
