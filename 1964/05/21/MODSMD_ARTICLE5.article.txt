## Will McBride Alter ASSU? 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
Did Scot I Mcßrido's election as
ASSU president indicate a clear
mandate for a njy substantial
changes in Stanford student gov
ernment ?
And will there be such change?
This was the question many stu
dents were asking this week.
McBRIHE HIMSELF has said
that he "will not drastically
change the course of government
here."
"1 will rely quite heavily on the

advice of those people who h-a v e
experience in student govern
ment." Mcßride said last night. "I
will welcome any ideas and help
that they wish to offer."
ONE CHANGE THAT will be
made, he indicated, would be in
the attitude of the executive in
speaking on certain issues.
Mcßride feels that while the
ASSU President should press for
student involvement in many off
campus areas, this involvement
should not be organized and di
rected through the president's

office.
He feels that the president
should hesitate before taking an
! outspoken position of leadership
j in these areas of involvement, due
i to his position as spokesman for
j the entire student body, and the
' fact that activities should be di
; rectcd by the various agencies of
i the ASSU which have been de
signed to handle such things.
.McßßiniO WON last week's
election by a decisive 295-vote
margin over John Bryson.
But both he and Bryson admit

that no one issue dominated the
campaign, leading to a belief that
the election is neither a decisive
rejection of the policies that have
guided student government for
the past several years, nor a
sweeping endorsement of any
new policies.
Mcßride said that one of the
biggest factors in his victory was
his highly efficient group of 150
campaign workers. In the last
week of campaigning, the group
was extremely successful in
swinging votes, he said.
Mcßride finished second iti the
primary by 70 votes, but one week
later topped Bryson 1,649 to 1.-
354.
Several factors indicate that Mc-
Bride's victory cannot be inter
preted as a major change in stu
dent opinion, or a rejection of the
work being done by the current
ASSU Presdient Bud Wedin.
IT CANNOT be denied that
there has been student dissatis
faction with Wedin, particularly
on the Row.
But again Mcßride's support
was not confined to the Row. but
was campus wide. For example.
Mcßride said last night that straw
polls taken in Wilbur before the
election showed him running close
to Bryson there, a place believed
to strongly support Wedin's poli
cies.

Mcßride said last night that straw
polls taken in Wilbur before the
election showed him running close
to Bryson there, a place believed
to strongly support Wedin's poli
cies.
Did Scot I Mcßrido's election as
ASSU president indicate a clear
mandate for a njy substantial
changes in Stanford student gov
ernment ?
And will there be such change?
This was the question many stu
dents were asking this week.
McBRIHE HIMSELF has said
that he "will not drastically
change the course of government
here."
"1 will rely quite heavily on the

advice of those people who h-a v e
experience in student govern
ment." Mcßride said last night. "I
will welcome any ideas and help
that they wish to offer."
ONE CHANGE THAT will be
made, he indicated, would be in
the attitude of the executive in
speaking on certain issues.
Mcßride feels that while the
ASSU President should press for
student involvement in many off
campus areas, this involvement
should not be organized and di
rected through the president's

office.
He feels that the president
should hesitate before taking an
! outspoken position of leadership
j in these areas of involvement, due
i to his position as spokesman for
j the entire student body, and the
' fact that activities should be di
; rectcd by the various agencies of
i the ASSU which have been de
signed to handle such things.
.McßßiniO WON last week's
election by a decisive 295-vote
margin over John Bryson.
But both he and Bryson admit

that no one issue dominated the
campaign, leading to a belief that
the election is neither a decisive
rejection of the policies that have
guided student government for
the past several years, nor a
sweeping endorsement of any
new policies.
Mcßride said that one of the
biggest factors in his victory was
his highly efficient group of 150
campaign workers. In the last
week of campaigning, the group
was extremely successful in
swinging votes, he said.
Mcßride finished second iti the
primary by 70 votes, but one week
later topped Bryson 1,649 to 1.-
354.
Several factors indicate that Mc-
Bride's victory cannot be inter
preted as a major change in stu
dent opinion, or a rejection of the
work being done by the current
ASSU Presdient Bud Wedin.
IT CANNOT be denied that
there has been student dissatis
faction with Wedin, particularly
on the Row.
But again Mcßride's support
was not confined to the Row. but
was campus wide. For example.
