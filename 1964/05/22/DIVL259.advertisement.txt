Will America Fall?
j "Righteousness exalteth a nation, hut sin is a reproach to any people."
i (Proverbs 14:34).
i Your own life may not he 100 per cent clean and moral, hut certainly
j you do not enjoy hearing about teenagers hooked on heroin, or young
i husbands who slaughter their wives and small children. And surely you
i too are alarmed at the current California divorce rate which is near
| 50 per cent! The papers are full of stories of sexual depravity and im
' moral living, and you don't have to look far to see the same thing on
j campus. Perhaps it has not occurred to you that there is an underlying
connection between the moral and spiritual health of individual citizens
and the prosperity of an entire nation, but this is precisely what the
Bible tells us,
' Nfavbe you've wondered if America will decline and fall as Rome and
| other great civilization have done.
1 For a frightening description of what happens to nations which turn from
Cod to idolatry and moral decay, read the Old Testament record of the
rise and fall of Israel, the Ammonites, Tyrus, Ancient Egypt, Mount Seir,
and Babylon (see Ewkiel, Chapters H>, 25, 26, 29, 35, and Jeremiah
25:12). The exciting Old Testament record is very much relevant today,
ior it reveals Cod's attitude towards sin and His unrelenting and com
plete dealing with all those who turn from Ilini.
From His viewpoint in eternity, Cod sees the beginning from the end.
How descriptive of life in modern America is His picture concerning the
end time:
"Hut understanding this, that in the last davs there will set in perilous ,
times of great stress and trouble—hard to deal with and hard to bear, j
I''or people will be lovers of self and utterly self-centered, lovers of money
and aroused by an inordinate desire lor wealth, proud and arrogant and
contemptuous boasters. They will be blasphemous scoffers, disobedient
to parents, ungrateful, unholy, and profane. They will he without natural '
affection, callous and inhuman, relentless—admitting of no truce or ap- j
peasement. They will be slanderers—false accusers, trouble makers; in
temperate and loose in morals and conduct, uncontrolled and fierce,
haters of good. They will be treacherous betrayers, rash and inflated with
self-conceit. They will he lovers of sensual pleasures and vain amuse
ments more than and rather than of God. For although they hold a form
of true religion, they deny and reject and are strangers ot the power of
it—their conduct belies the genuineness of their profession." (2 Timothy
3:1-5 Ampl.)
Those who have studied the fall of nations find good reason to be con
concerned about the United States. The widespread moral decay and
spiritual degeneration in our land are eetainly danger signs flashing
bright red warnings.
To the small remnant of Christians standing firm for Jesus Christ, Cod
indicates that the road ahead may not always be smooth and easy. Codly
living and a solid stand for the Truth often make sinful men who have
not been Uherated by Jesus Christ antagonistic. Paul writes these words
of exhortation to Christians:
"Indeed all who delight in piety and are determined to live a godly and
devoted life in Christ Jesus will meet with persecution—that is will he
made to suffer for their religions stand. Hut wicked men and imposters
will go on from had to worse, deceiving themselves. But as for you,
continue to hold to the things that you have learned and of which you
are convinced know ing from whom you learned them. And how from
your childhood you have had a knowledge ol and been acquainted with
the sacred writings which are able to instruct you and give you the un
standing for salvation which comes through faith in Christ Jesus (that
! is, through tho leaning of the entire personality on Cod in Christ Jesus
1 in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom and goodness).
| Every Scripture is Cod-breathed—given hv His inspiration—and profit
i able for instruction, for reproof and conviction of sin, for correction of
error and discipline in obedience, and for training in righteousness (that
j is, in holy living, in conformity to Cod's w ill in thought, purpose and
action). So that the man of Cod may be complete and proficient, well
| fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work, 112 charge you in
I the presence of Cod and ol Christ Jesus Who is to judge the living and
1 the dead—and by the light of his coming and his kindoin: Herald and
j preach the Word! Keep your sense of urgency (stand by, be at hand
[ and ready, whether the opportunity seems to he favorable or unfavorable,
j whether it is convenient or inconvenient, whether it be welcome or un
welcome, you as preacher of the Word are to show people in what ways
i their lives are wrong) and convince them, rebuking and correcting,
I warning and urging and encouraging them, being unflagging and in
j exhaustahle in patience and teaching. For the time is coming when
| people will not tolerate sound and wholesome instruction, but having
| ears itching for something pleasing and gratifying, they will gather to
! themselves one teacher after another to a considerable number, chosen
j to satisfy their own liking and to foster the errors that they hold, and
j will turn aside from hearing the truth and wander off into myths and
j man-made fictions." (II Timothy 3:12, 1:4).
j In this age of confusion when our great nation may indeed be on
j the way down, what can we as individuals do to stem the tide and strengt
en our country? Our nation is made up of individuals, and by getting
' right with Cod yourself and proclaiming the Gospel, you will be helping
the United States,
Truth is not an abstract principle. Truth is a Person. The answer for you j
and for our nation is the living Person, Jesus Christ. Jesus did not only
say that lie had the truth, or that Ho knew the Truth, He also said that
I le was the Truth:
"I am the Way and the Truth and the Life; no one comes to the Father
except through Me. If you had known Me—had learned to recognize Me—
you would also have known My Father. From now on you know Him
and have seen Him." (John If ;0. 7).
Will Jesus Christ one day say to you "1 never knew you"; or will it he |
instead. "Come you blessed of my Father, inherit—receive as your own— I
the kindom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."

"I am the Way and the Truth and the Life; no one comes to the Father

you would also have known My Father. From now on you know Him

j "Righteousness exalteth a nation, hut sin is a reproach to any people."
i (Proverbs 14:34).
i Your own life may not he 100 per cent clean and moral, hut certainly
j you do not enjoy hearing about teenagers hooked on heroin, or young
i husbands who slaughter their wives and small children. And surely you
i too are alarmed at the current California divorce rate which is near
| 50 per cent! The papers are full of stories of sexual depravity and im
' moral living, and you don't have to look far to see the same thing on
j campus. Perhaps it has not occurred to you that there is an underlying
connection between the moral and spiritual health of individual citizens
and the prosperity of an entire nation, but this is precisely what the
Bible tells us,
' Nfavbe you've wondered if America will decline and fall as Rome and
| other great civilization have done.
1 For a frightening description of what happens to nations which turn from
Cod to idolatry and moral decay, read the Old Testament record of the
rise and fall of Israel, the Ammonites, Tyrus, Ancient Egypt, Mount Seir,
and Babylon (see Ewkiel, Chapters H>, 25, 26, 29, 35, and Jeremiah
25:12). The exciting Old Testament record is very much relevant today,
ior it reveals Cod's attitude towards sin and His unrelenting and com
plete dealing with all those who turn from Ilini.
From His viewpoint in eternity, Cod sees the beginning from the end.
How descriptive of life in modern America is His picture concerning the
end time:
"Hut understanding this, that in the last davs there will set in perilous ,
times of great stress and trouble—hard to deal with and hard to bear, j
I''or people will be lovers of self and utterly self-centered, lovers of money
and aroused by an inordinate desire lor wealth, proud and arrogant and
contemptuous boasters. They will be blasphemous scoffers, disobedient
to parents, ungrateful, unholy, and profane. They will he without natural '
affection, callous and inhuman, relentless—admitting of no truce or ap- j
peasement. They will be slanderers—false accusers, trouble makers; in
temperate and loose in morals and conduct, uncontrolled and fierce,
haters of good. They will be treacherous betrayers, rash and inflated with
self-conceit. They will he lovers of sensual pleasures and vain amuse
ments more than and rather than of God. For although they hold a form
of true religion, they deny and reject and are strangers ot the power of
it—their conduct belies the genuineness of their profession." (2 Timothy
3:1-5 Ampl.)
Those who have studied the fall of nations find good reason to be con
concerned about the United States. The widespread moral decay and
spiritual degeneration in our land are eetainly danger signs flashing
bright red warnings.
To the small remnant of Christians standing firm for Jesus Christ, Cod
indicates that the road ahead may not always be smooth and easy. Codly
living and a solid stand for the Truth often make sinful men who have
not been Uherated by Jesus Christ antagonistic. Paul writes these words
of exhortation to Christians:
"Indeed all who delight in piety and are determined to live a godly and
devoted life in Christ Jesus will meet with persecution—that is will he
made to suffer for their religions stand. Hut wicked men and imposters
will go on from had to worse, deceiving themselves. But as for you,
continue to hold to the things that you have learned and of which you
are convinced know ing from whom you learned them. And how from
your childhood you have had a knowledge ol and been acquainted with
the sacred writings which are able to instruct you and give you the un
standing for salvation which comes through faith in Christ Jesus (that
! is, through tho leaning of the entire personality on Cod in Christ Jesus
1 in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom and goodness).
| Every Scripture is Cod-breathed—given hv His inspiration—and profit
i able for instruction, for reproof and conviction of sin, for correction of
error and discipline in obedience, and for training in righteousness (that
j is, in holy living, in conformity to Cod's w ill in thought, purpose and

Those who have studied the fall of nations find good reason to be con
concerned about the United States. The widespread moral decay and
spiritual degeneration in our land are eetainly danger signs flashing
bright red warnings.
To the small remnant of Christians standing firm for Jesus Christ, Cod
indicates that the road ahead may not always be smooth and easy. Codly
living and a solid stand for the Truth often make sinful men who have
not been Uherated by Jesus Christ antagonistic. Paul writes these words
of exhortation to Christians:
"Indeed all who delight in piety and are determined to live a godly and
devoted life in Christ Jesus will meet with persecution—that is will he
made to suffer for their religions stand. Hut wicked men and imposters
will go on from had to worse, deceiving themselves. But as for you,
continue to hold to the things that you have learned and of which you
are convinced know ing from whom you learned them. And how from
your childhood you have had a knowledge ol and been acquainted with
the sacred writings which are able to instruct you and give you the un
standing for salvation which comes through faith in Christ Jesus (that
! is, through tho leaning of the entire personality on Cod in Christ Jesus
1 in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom and goodness).
| Every Scripture is Cod-breathed—given hv His inspiration—and profit
i able for instruction, for reproof and conviction of sin, for correction of
error and discipline in obedience, and for training in righteousness (that
j is, in holy living, in conformity to Cod's w ill in thought, purpose and
action). So that the man of Cod may be complete and proficient, well
| fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work, 112 charge you in
I the presence of Cod and ol Christ Jesus Who is to judge the living and
1 the dead—and by the light of his coming and his kindoin: Herald and
j preach the Word! Keep your sense of urgency (stand by, be at hand
[ and ready, whether the opportunity seems to he favorable or unfavorable,
j whether it is convenient or inconvenient, whether it be welcome or un
welcome, you as preacher of the Word are to show people in what ways
i their lives are wrong) and convince them, rebuking and correcting,
I warning and urging and encouraging them, being unflagging and in
j exhaustahle in patience and teaching. For the time is coming when
| people will not tolerate sound and wholesome instruction, but having
| ears itching for something pleasing and gratifying, they will gather to
! themselves one teacher after another to a considerable number, chosen
j to satisfy their own liking and to foster the errors that they hold, and
j will turn aside from hearing the truth and wander off into myths and
j man-made fictions." (II Timothy 3:12, 1:4).
j In this age of confusion when our great nation may indeed be on
j the way down, what can we as individuals do to stem the tide and strengt
en our country? Our nation is made up of individuals, and by getting
' right with Cod yourself and proclaiming the Gospel, you will be helping
the United States,
Truth is not an abstract principle. Truth is a Person. The answer for you j
and for our nation is the living Person, Jesus Christ. Jesus did not only
say that lie had the truth, or that Ho knew the Truth, He also said that
I le was the Truth:
"I am the Way and the Truth and the Life; no one comes to the Father
except through Me. If you had known Me—had learned to recognize Me—
you would also have known My Father. From now on you know Him
and have seen Him." (John If ;0. 7).
Will Jesus Christ one day say to you "1 never knew you"; or will it he |
instead. "Come you blessed of my Father, inherit—receive as your own— I
the kindom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."

1 For a frightening description of what happens to nations which turn from
Cod to idolatry and moral decay, read the Old Testament record of the
rise and fall of Israel, the Ammonites, Tyrus, Ancient Egypt, Mount Seir,
and Babylon (see Ewkiel, Chapters H>, 25, 26, 29, 35, and Jeremiah
25:12). The exciting Old Testament record is very much relevant today,
ior it reveals Cod's attitude towards sin and His unrelenting and com
plete dealing with all those who turn from Ilini.
From His viewpoint in eternity, Cod sees the beginning from the end.

Will America Fall?
j "Righteousness exalteth a nation, hut sin is a reproach to any people."
i (Proverbs 14:34).
i Your own life may not he 100 per cent clean and moral, hut certainly
j you do not enjoy hearing about teenagers hooked on heroin, or young
i husbands who slaughter their wives and small children. And surely you
i too are alarmed at the current California divorce rate which is near
| 50 per cent! The papers are full of stories of sexual depravity and im
' moral living, and you don't have to look far to see the same thing on
j campus. Perhaps it has not occurred to you that there is an underlying
connection between the moral and spiritual health of individual citizens
and the prosperity of an entire nation, but this is precisely what the
Bible tells us,
' Nfavbe you've wondered if America will decline and fall as Rome and
| other great civilization have done.
1 For a frightening description of what happens to nations which turn from
Cod to idolatry and moral decay, read the Old Testament record of the
rise and fall of Israel, the Ammonites, Tyrus, Ancient Egypt, Mount Seir,
and Babylon (see Ewkiel, Chapters H>, 25, 26, 29, 35, and Jeremiah
25:12). The exciting Old Testament record is very much relevant today,
ior it reveals Cod's attitude towards sin and His unrelenting and com
plete dealing with all those who turn from Ilini.
From His viewpoint in eternity, Cod sees the beginning from the end.
How descriptive of life in modern America is His picture concerning the
end time:
"Hut understanding this, that in the last davs there will set in perilous ,
times of great stress and trouble—hard to deal with and hard to bear, j
I''or people will be lovers of self and utterly self-centered, lovers of money
and aroused by an inordinate desire lor wealth, proud and arrogant and
contemptuous boasters. They will be blasphemous scoffers, disobedient
to parents, ungrateful, unholy, and profane. They will he without natural '
affection, callous and inhuman, relentless—admitting of no truce or ap- j
peasement. They will be slanderers—false accusers, trouble makers; in
temperate and loose in morals and conduct, uncontrolled and fierce,
haters of good. They will be treacherous betrayers, rash and inflated with
self-conceit. They will he lovers of sensual pleasures and vain amuse
ments more than and rather than of God. For although they hold a form
of true religion, they deny and reject and are strangers ot the power of
it—their conduct belies the genuineness of their profession." (2 Timothy
3:1-5 Ampl.)
Those who have studied the fall of nations find good reason to be con
concerned about the United States. The widespread moral decay and
spiritual degeneration in our land are eetainly danger signs flashing
bright red warnings.
To the small remnant of Christians standing firm for Jesus Christ, Cod
indicates that the road ahead may not always be smooth and easy. Codly
living and a solid stand for the Truth often make sinful men who have
not been Uherated by Jesus Christ antagonistic. Paul writes these words
of exhortation to Christians:
"Indeed all who delight in piety and are determined to live a godly and
devoted life in Christ Jesus will meet with persecution—that is will he
made to suffer for their religions stand. Hut wicked men and imposters
will go on from had to worse, deceiving themselves. But as for you,
continue to hold to the things that you have learned and of which you
are convinced know ing from whom you learned them. And how from
your childhood you have had a knowledge ol and been acquainted with
the sacred writings which are able to instruct you and give you the un
standing for salvation which comes through faith in Christ Jesus (that
! is, through tho leaning of the entire personality on Cod in Christ Jesus
1 in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom and goodness).
| Every Scripture is Cod-breathed—given hv His inspiration—and profit
i able for instruction, for reproof and conviction of sin, for correction of
error and discipline in obedience, and for training in righteousness (that
j is, in holy living, in conformity to Cod's w ill in thought, purpose and
action). So that the man of Cod may be complete and proficient, well
| fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work, 112 charge you in
I the presence of Cod and ol Christ Jesus Who is to judge the living and
1 the dead—and by the light of his coming and his kindoin: Herald and
j preach the Word! Keep your sense of urgency (stand by, be at hand
[ and ready, whether the opportunity seems to he favorable or unfavorable,
j whether it is convenient or inconvenient, whether it be welcome or un
welcome, you as preacher of the Word are to show people in what ways
i their lives are wrong) and convince them, rebuking and correcting,
I warning and urging and encouraging them, being unflagging and in
j exhaustahle in patience and teaching. For the time is coming when
| people will not tolerate sound and wholesome instruction, but having
| ears itching for something pleasing and gratifying, they will gather to
! themselves one teacher after another to a considerable number, chosen
j to satisfy their own liking and to foster the errors that they hold, and
j will turn aside from hearing the truth and wander off into myths and
j man-made fictions." (II Timothy 3:12, 1:4).
j In this age of confusion when our great nation may indeed be on
j the way down, what can we as individuals do to stem the tide and strengt
en our country? Our nation is made up of individuals, and by getting
' right with Cod yourself and proclaiming the Gospel, you will be helping
the United States,
Truth is not an abstract principle. Truth is a Person. The answer for you j
and for our nation is the living Person, Jesus Christ. Jesus did not only
say that lie had the truth, or that Ho knew the Truth, He also said that
I le was the Truth:
"I am the Way and the Truth and the Life; no one comes to the Father
except through Me. If you had known Me—had learned to recognize Me—
you would also have known My Father. From now on you know Him
and have seen Him." (John If ;0. 7).
Will Jesus Christ one day say to you "1 never knew you"; or will it he |
instead. "Come you blessed of my Father, inherit—receive as your own— I
the kindom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
