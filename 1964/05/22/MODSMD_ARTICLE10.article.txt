### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
LASSL last night approved the changes in llie Folitieal Union
By-Laws removing the ehairnien of voluntary groups From the
voting for members of the Lvxecutive Hoard. The measure had
been opposed by the President of the Stanford Area Young Ke
publieans, John Honine beeause ot fears that it would make the

Executive Board of Political"
Union a self-perpetuating group.
Members of the E xe e u live
Board had favored ihe change be
cause it was felt that the volun
tary groups under the Political
Union, pointed out that tho only
with the Politcal Union Board.
Andy Williams, speaking for Poli
Union, pointed out that the only
connection lhat the Board has
with these groups is one of "spon
sorship."
ANOTHER proposed By-laws
change was defeated by the Leg
islature. The change would have
eliminated from the By-laws a
section of the rights guaranteed
lo students by the ASSU, that
records of disciplinary action not
be placed on a student's tran
script.
Recommending that the section
be eliminated, Bob Curry pointed
out to the Legislature that, the
Administration felt the section
could not be guaranteed by th e
ASSU since the matter was well
covered by University policy.
An amendment to the By-law
was defeated 18-23, but the Legis
lature also defeated the proposed
change, 16-23, a two-thirds ma

jority being necessary for a ny
change in existing By-laws.
IN OTHFR business a commit- i
tec which had been investigating
possible executive reorganization!
made several proposals, although j
no action will be taken on them !
until next year. Keith Kanaga, the j
committee chair m a n, recom
mended several assistants to Ihe
Vice President be appointed, that
t lie Vice President be given the
job of coordination between th e
ASSU boards and commissions,
and that the salaries of the ASSU
President', Vice President, an d
LASSU Speaker be increased to
1,000, 600, and SOO dollars, respec
tively.
Speaker Mat tin Gibson ap
pointed a committee to conduct
hearings on the proposed change
in upperclass men's living sys
tems. However no action was tak
en on the draw system which had
been proposed two weeks ago.
Ed Shaw, in closing out several
accounts which have not been
active for the past two years, also
reported that the Stanford Flying
Club had gone deeply in debt, and
that the ASSU would have to
make up a deficit of $1,250, which
the club had incurred, m a in 1 y
through the purchase of an air
; plane.
Student financial manager Ed
j Shaw submitted the proposed
, ASSU master budget to LASSU
: last night. It is a deficit budget,
I $5,000 in t lie red.
The deficit spending is a new
i policy, designed to reduce the
! substantial ASSU reserves.
"This deficit spending is good
| business practice if the reserves
: are too large," commented Shaw.
The total expenses for the 19(51-
165 school year will be $78,700.
j Each student will contribute $3.65
from his tuition to the ASSU per
