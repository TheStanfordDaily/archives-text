## Chemical Proves Toxic 
### JAMES BRISCOE 
Plans for a Roach Control Program at Stan
ford Village were altered this week when it was
discovered that one of the chemicals used in the
operation might be dangerous to the inhabitants
of the village.
The chemical. Chloradane was to have been
sprayed on the exterior walls and shrubbery of
the section used for married student housing. The
program called for each building to be vacated for
at least five hours while it was being sprayed.
JOHN HI<;NNT;TT t a medical student living in
the Village, noted that Chloradane would retain its
taxie effects for at least a week. He feared it
might prove dangerous to children who would ab
sorb it daily from shrubs and walls.
Dr. Hubert Rreisbach. of the Stanford Pharma
cology* Department was consulted and he stated

around children.
"I fell that lhis ichloradanet was a fairly taxic
compound that would remain around for quite a
lime 1 and that there would be at least a remote
chance of injury to children," ho told The Daily.
"It has been iii the past a reasonably effective
roach control element, although I think there are
more elective compounds now."
Till: ( IIh.MH All < lII.OKADANK has now
been replaced with DDT according to Director of
Married Housing F. E. Gallapher. and there is a
possibility that the entire program may be post
poned until after Finals Week.
The program, which is mandatory, was ap
proved by the Universit.v Health Officer and the
San Mateo County Vector Control Specialist.
Chloradane was apparently used in an ant control
program at Escondido Village earlier this year
with no bad elTects.
