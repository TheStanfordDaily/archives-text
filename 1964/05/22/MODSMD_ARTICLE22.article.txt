# Improved Varsity Vs. Rugged Alumni
## 
### 
Tho Varsity-Alumni Game Sat
urday at 2:45 p.m. marks tho end
of five weeks of spring training
and matches an improved Stan
ford football team against a
rugged, star-studded Alumni
squad.
The main reasons for the im
provement over last spring,
Coach John Ralston says, are an
increase in baekfield speed and a
stronger defense, especially on

Terry DoSylvia, a transfer who
led the Whites to an intrasquad
victory last Saturday, will be the
starting quarterback. Three lot -
termen will complete tho starting
baekfield- Ray Handley, Dick
Ragsdale, and Glenn Myers.
The Alumni are 17 strong and
have as coaches John Brodie,
Norm Manoogian, and Paul Wig
gin. They have had less than a
week of practice but are certain
they can break a three-game los
ing streak and even the series
at three apiece.

Quarterback Dick Norman, who
holds many Stanford passing rec
ords, will direct Iho attack. Run
ning backs Steve Thurlow and
Skip Face also can pass well. Tar
gels for their aerials will include
ends Sam Morley, Gary Van Gal
dor, Bob Burke, and Frank Pati
tucci.
On the line are two pro regu
lars, Frank Atkinson of the Steel
ers and Paul Wiggin of the
Browns.
Admission is 50 cents for stu
dents and $1.50 for adults.
