# Stanford's Hopes Slim In Conference Meet
## 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
Pay)on Jordan takes an 18-man
Stanford track team south this
afternoon for tomorrow's AAWU
championships to be hosted by
USC in the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Jordan labels the host Trojans
and the Cal team his men man
handled in the recent Big Meet
as tho teams to beat. "We'll be
happy to get third place" was all
the coach would say yesterday.
SCORING for all events in the
meet will be on a 5-4-3-2-1 basis.
Scoring on this basis is an aid to
teams with a number of premium
"championship performers." A
few really good men can get Hie
best of considerable depth in a
meet of 1 his type.
That's tho kind of teams both
SC and Cal have this year. Gene
Johnson and Roger Olson, ster
ling high Jumpers for Cal should
dominate the field there as Tro
jans Lew Hoyt and Joe Faust are
injured and will be below par.
Dave Archibald a n d Forrest
Boaty of Cal are similar cham
pionship performers who will be
competing against the likes of
Dick Cortese, Wellesley Clayton
and Gary Comer in the sprints.
Troy's big men extend further
than Cal's, though. Don Castle
and Les Mills in the weights and
Larry Stuart in the javelin give
SC depth and potential wins
there. Add triple jumper Ma
honey Samuels, if healthy, and
you have a mighty strong team
both in depth and championship
J men.
TO WIN the meet, or to come
close, Stanford will have to com
! pletely dominate every event on
the track from the SSO up. Bill
Pratt and Bob Miltz, the defend
i ing champ, will head the Tri be
entries in the half mile.
The mile will see Paul Schlicke
in a duel with UCLA's Bob Day
for first. Stanford must: get points

from either Harlan Andrews or
Harry McCalla also, if the Cards
are to figure strongly in the meet.
Schlicke. also running the three
mile later in the afternoon, will
be trying to duplicate the fan
tastic double run by Julio Marin
of SC last year, when Marin set
meet records in both the mile and
three-mile. Dave Deuhner and
Weym Kirkland, the other Indian
entries here, figure to place and
must in fact do so for Stanford
to make a respectable showing.
STEVE CORTKIGIIT, ailing al
most all season, must also come
through with wins in both hur
dles and points in the triple .jump.
Points from Bob Stoecker in the
discus, Chuck Smith in the pole
vault, Eric Frisrhe in the sprints
and Ken Fraser in the sprints and
broad jump would also be a great
aid to the Redskin cause.
