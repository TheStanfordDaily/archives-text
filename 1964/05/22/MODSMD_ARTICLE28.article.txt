# MOVIE REVIEW
## 'Henry Orient': A Curious Blend 
### FOSTER HIRSCH 
There are two facts worth men
tioning about "The World of
lienry Orient," which can now be
seen at the Stage Door in San
Francisco. The first is that it has
been selected as the official U.S.
representative at the Cannes
film F estiva 1, the second
is that it had its American pre
miere at that mammoth monu
ment to mediocrity, the Radio
City Music Flail.
To be sure, there are elements
in the film which make it worthy
of competition in a film festival,
and there are elements as well
which make ii appropriate thai it
received I he kiss of death by
screening at the Music Hall. In
almost every aspect of the film,
there is this curious and dis
turbing blend of artistry and com
promise.
The screenplay, written by
Nora Johnson in collaboration
with her father Nunnally John
son, concerns the history of two
young girls' infatuation with a
foppish, self-styled concert pian

ist. While the film deals with the
secret and imaginative world
which the girls create, it is a
charming and witty portrait of
early adolescent behavior, and the
dialogue is bright and fresh with
out ever striking a false note.
BUT >lISK JOHNSON and her
father pad the script unnecessar
ily by shifting the emphasis mid
way to concentrate on the girls'
relations with their parents. The
parents, less believable and less
honestly drawn than the girls, are
in fact little more than stereo
types; consequently, the film
loses its bounce, and the mood be
comes hackenyed and sentimental.
The heroines are played by two
young ladies who go by the im
probable names of Merrie Spaeth
and Tippy Walker. Since they
were chosen to play characters
very close to themselves, they
manage to do quite well. They
both have a fine sense of humor
and they present contrasting, but
engaging, personalities.
Peter Sellers seems content to
take a back seat to his young

compatriots, but his performance
as the playboy pianist is by no
means careless. It is, as is almost
always the case with him, effort
less and immaculate; it is partic
ularly subtle when he suggests
the shallowness of his character
by switching in harried moments
from an affected Continental ac
cent to colloquial Brooklyne.se.
Paula Prentiss as the latest ob
ject of his amorous pursuits is a
stylish and clever comedienne.
Angela Lansbury plays M is s
Walker's unworthy mother. Her
role, as indicated, is not well-inte
grated into the mood or the plot,
but that is certainly not her fault.
Though it would benefit the unity
of the film were she not involved
in the proceedings, ii is a pleasure
to see such a superlative actress
at work regardless of context, for
she plays here what she can play
better than anyone else: a vitu
perative, domineering, ruthless
harridan.
PHYLLIS THAXTFR plays
Miss Spaeth's impossibly noble
mother with very much the air

(if a Good Housekeeping model.
Bibi Osterwald as her wise-crack
ing friend, and Tom Boslcy as
Miss Lansbury's cuckolded hus
band give performances worthy
of a situation comedy series on
television.
There are some lovely shots of
Central Park in autumn, winter,
and spring and some effective
slow motion photography of the
girls romping around New York.
There is also an inventively edited
scene during one of Mr, Seller's
concerts.
For the rest, New York, for
the first and probably the last,
i time, looks like a spotless fairy
land of gingerbread houses, most
of the interiors are straight from
the latest California Home Furn
ishing Exposition, the lighting is
j overdone and artificial, the color
lis too slick and bright, the music
i by Elmer Bernstein, is a bit too
I syrupy.
"The World of Henry Orient"
iis a way-above-average Holly
! wood effort, but it not quite good
i enough.

There are two facts worth men
tioning about "The World of
lienry Orient," which can now be
seen at the Stage Door in San
Francisco. The first is that it has
been selected as the official U.S.
representative at the Cannes
film F estiva 1, the second
is that it had its American pre
miere at that mammoth monu
ment to mediocrity, the Radio
City Music Flail.
To be sure, there are elements
in the film which make it worthy
of competition in a film festival,
and there are elements as well
which make ii appropriate thai it
received I he kiss of death by
screening at the Music Hall. In
almost every aspect of the film,
there is this curious and dis
turbing blend of artistry and com
promise.
The screenplay, written by
Nora Johnson in collaboration
with her father Nunnally John
son, concerns the history of two
young girls' infatuation with a
foppish, self-styled concert pian

ist. While the film deals with the
secret and imaginative world
which the girls create, it is a
charming and witty portrait of
early adolescent behavior, and the
dialogue is bright and fresh with
out ever striking a false note.
BUT >lISK JOHNSON and her
father pad the script unnecessar
ily by shifting the emphasis mid
way to concentrate on the girls'
relations with their parents. The
parents, less believable and less
honestly drawn than the girls, are
in fact little more than stereo
types; consequently, the film
loses its bounce, and the mood be
comes hackenyed and sentimental.
The heroines are played by two
young ladies who go by the im
probable names of Merrie Spaeth
and Tippy Walker. Since they
were chosen to play characters
very close to themselves, they
manage to do quite well. They
both have a fine sense of humor
and they present contrasting, but
engaging, personalities.
Peter Sellers seems content to
take a back seat to his young

compatriots, but his performance
as the playboy pianist is by no
means careless. It is, as is almost
always the case with him, effort
less and immaculate; it is partic
ularly subtle when he suggests
the shallowness of his character
by switching in harried moments
from an affected Continental ac
cent to colloquial Brooklyne.se.
Paula Prentiss as the latest ob
ject of his amorous pursuits is a
stylish and clever comedienne.
Angela Lansbury plays M is s
Walker's unworthy mother. Her
role, as indicated, is not well-inte
grated into the mood or the plot,
but that is certainly not her fault.
Though it would benefit the unity
of the film were she not involved
in the proceedings, ii is a pleasure
to see such a superlative actress
at work regardless of context, for
she plays here what she can play
better than anyone else: a vitu
perative, domineering, ruthless
harridan.
PHYLLIS THAXTFR plays
Miss Spaeth's impossibly noble
mother with very much the air

(if a Good Housekeeping model.
Bibi Osterwald as her wise-crack
ing friend, and Tom Boslcy as
Miss Lansbury's cuckolded hus
band give performances worthy
of a situation comedy series on
television.
There are some lovely shots of
Central Park in autumn, winter,
and spring and some effective
slow motion photography of the
girls romping around New York.
There is also an inventively edited
scene during one of Mr, Seller's
concerts.
For the rest, New York, for
the first and probably the last,
i time, looks like a spotless fairy
land of gingerbread houses, most
of the interiors are straight from
