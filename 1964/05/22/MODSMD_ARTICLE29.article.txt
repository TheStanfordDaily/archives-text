## Daily Exhibited Paranoia On Elections, KZSU 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In the last four years I
have seen the Stanford Daily
go through cycles of sophisti
cation from ludicrous to
worthwhile. Currently it is
riding at what I consider the
high mark of its career: na
tional and local news is clear
and concise; articles of stu
dent interest are presented
with vigor; and its handling
of campus affairs has demon
strated remarkable ability.
But at the same time I note
some characteristics that
seem to predict the cyclical
demise of the Daily:
1 1 Instead of confining it
self to the discussion of
issues in the last primary
campaign, it stepped into a
mire of personality conflict
that spread from the individ
ual columns to the front page
and the editorials. If the
Daily felt that one candidate
was superior then it was
their duty to say so. But it
should have been done fairly
and with respect to the issues
not just as a reaction
against criticism (perhaps
justified) of the Daily.
2) After a great deal of
space was devoted to the
"KZSU scandal," no mention
was made of the fact that a
special Legislative committee
had declared the charges un
founded and had exonerated
KZSU.
3) The editorial of Tues
day, May 12, entitled "The
Press and Vote Counting,"
was a blatant misrepresenta
tion of purpose and fact:
A 1 The purpose of exclud
ing the press during count
ing was in order to let the
Elections Judgments Board
determine whether or not
the fradulent ballots seri
ously affected the election.
If the results had been re
leased prematurely, and then
the election had been voided,
untold and totally unneces
sary damage would have
boon done to the enthusiasm
and morale of the separate
campaign groups.
B) The fradulent ballots
were not discovered on Wed
nesday as reported because
all but two of the boxes were
under lock and key at th e
ASSU Office. On Wednesday
Skip knew he could not ac
count for 100 ballots but
thought this was due to bal
lot transfer from poll to poll.
The actual fraud was not dis
covered until Thursday after
noon.
The Daily has improved tre
mendously in four years, but
I doubt that it will ever ap
proach the sophistication
worthy of the Stanford cam
pus until it can cure itself
of the paranoia it exhibits
when any criticism is made.

Editor, The Daily:
1 was listening to the radio
today 'Sunday morning) to a
conversation being held by

Gargiola, a minister; an d
Jackie Robinson, an athlete
of UCLA.
The subject was morality
in sports.
Each spoke very nicely but
the main theme seemed to
be in l'avor of athletic schol
arships, rather than under
the table pay, or handouts,
like tuitions and keep, for the
athletes' services rendered to
a school, in track, football or
other athletic events.
And as I listened I began
to think in terms of property
left to heirs, which is taxed
for inheritance tax. Then, as
income and finally, if it is
a corporation, corporation
taxes.
All along the line morality
is based on money or remun
eration in the realms cash.
Thus, if a property is loft
to an heir, and it was not
taxed, the property would be
the same.
Now, it is taxed — which
makes the property 110 more
or any less, as property.
Only the tax issue is the
extra basis on which the
property is transferred as a
gift - but, taxes makes this
a fallacious statement.
Now, if an athlete is given
his living, rent free, and even
some of his clothing bought
for him, does that make him
any better or any worse, as
an athlete? What of con
science, if any? The moral
issue here, is not seemingly
based on how much money
the athlete gets, but that he
loses his amateur standing.
No longer can he compete as
an amateur.
The morality of this "pay
as you go" venture, in ath
letic business -which is big
business today —- with the
scouting, and the binoculars
to watch better with, cheat
ing a little as it were, with
mechanical or scientific
methods of detecting what the
opposing players are up to,
stealing signals with high
powered glasses, even to
using television as a source
of close up information.
Managers all d trainers,
etc. use methods once we
might have considered as not
completely moral. But, I re
call many a little "crooked''
thing we kids did, when I was
a youngster and we played
games amongst ourselves.
Ah yes. we cheated, quite a
lot — but we didn't consider
it immoral to do it. It was
protecting ones self, and the
team, from getting caught
with pants down. We even
traded signals, and exchanged
players between us. It vv a s
part of the game. . . . This
constant intrigue and plan
ning to beat the other guys,
was an accepted spy system.
Maybe life is like that, like it
or not. Moral or not.
We may trade off our ama
teur standing for profes
sional, but does it make any
difference as to what we do
as professionals in our chosen
employment or athletic activi
ties or is it immoral?

the athlete gets, but that he
loses his amateur standing.
No longer can he compete as
an amateur.
The morality of this "pay
as you go" venture, in ath
letic business -which is big
business today —- with the
scouting, and the binoculars
to watch better with, cheat
ing a little as it were, with
mechanical or scientific
methods of detecting what the
opposing players are up to,
stealing signals with high
powered glasses, even to
using television as a source
of close up information.
Managers all d trainers,
etc. use methods once we
might have considered as not
completely moral. But, I re
call many a little "crooked''
thing we kids did, when I was
a youngster and we played
games amongst ourselves.
Ah yes. we cheated, quite a
lot — but we didn't consider
it immoral to do it. It was
protecting ones self, and the
team, from getting caught
with pants down. We even
traded signals, and exchanged
players between us. It vv a s
part of the game. . . . This
constant intrigue and plan
ning to beat the other guys,
was an accepted spy system.
Maybe life is like that, like it
or not. Moral or not.
We may trade off our ama
teur standing for profes
sional, but does it make any
difference as to what we do
as professionals in our chosen
employment or athletic activi
ties or is it immoral?
It. VV. MADISON
Editor, The Daily:
In the last four years I
have seen the Stanford Daily
go through cycles of sophisti
cation from ludicrous to
worthwhile. Currently it is
riding at what I consider the
high mark of its career: na
tional and local news is clear
and concise; articles of stu
dent interest are presented
with vigor; and its handling
of campus affairs has demon
strated remarkable ability.
But at the same time I note
some characteristics that
seem to predict the cyclical
demise of the Daily:
1 1 Instead of confining it
self to the discussion of
issues in the last primary
campaign, it stepped into a
mire of personality conflict
that spread from the individ
ual columns to the front page
and the editorials. If the
Daily felt that one candidate
was superior then it was
their duty to say so. But it
should have been done fairly
and with respect to the issues
not just as a reaction
against criticism (perhaps
justified) of the Daily.
2) After a great deal of
space was devoted to the
"KZSU scandal," no mention
was made of the fact that a
special Legislative committee
had declared the charges un
founded and had exonerated
KZSU.
3) The editorial of Tues
day, May 12, entitled "The
Press and Vote Counting,"
was a blatant misrepresenta
tion of purpose and fact:
A 1 The purpose of exclud
ing the press during count
ing was in order to let the
Elections Judgments Board
determine whether or not
the fradulent ballots seri
ously affected the election.
If the results had been re
leased prematurely, and then
the election had been voided,
untold and totally unneces
sary damage would have
boon done to the enthusiasm
and morale of the separate
campaign groups.
B) The fradulent ballots
were not discovered on Wed
nesday as reported because
all but two of the boxes were
under lock and key at th e
ASSU Office. On Wednesday
Skip knew he could not ac
count for 100 ballots but
thought this was due to bal
lot transfer from poll to poll.
The actual fraud was not dis
covered until Thursday after
noon.
The Daily has improved tre
mendously in four years, but
I doubt that it will ever ap
proach the sophistication
worthy of the Stanford cam
pus until it can cure itself
of the paranoia it exhibits
when any criticism is made.

Editor, The Daily:
1 was listening to the radio
today 'Sunday morning) to a
conversation being held by

Gargiola, a minister; an d
Jackie Robinson, an athlete
of UCLA.
The subject was morality
in sports.
Each spoke very nicely but
the main theme seemed to
be in l'avor of athletic schol
arships, rather than under
the table pay, or handouts,
like tuitions and keep, for the
athletes' services rendered to
a school, in track, football or
other athletic events.
And as I listened I began
to think in terms of property
left to heirs, which is taxed
for inheritance tax. Then, as
income and finally, if it is
a corporation, corporation
taxes.
All along the line morality
is based on money or remun
eration in the realms cash.
Thus, if a property is loft
to an heir, and it was not
taxed, the property would be
the same.
Now, it is taxed — which
makes the property 110 more
or any less, as property.
Only the tax issue is the
extra basis on which the
property is transferred as a
gift - but, taxes makes this
a fallacious statement.
Now, if an athlete is given
his living, rent free, and even
some of his clothing bought
for him, does that make him
any better or any worse, as
an athlete? What of con
science, if any? The moral
issue here, is not seemingly
based on how much money
the athlete gets, but that he
loses his amateur standing.

today 'Sunday morning) to a
conversation being held by

Gargiola, a minister; an d
Jackie Robinson, an athlete
of UCLA.
The subject was morality
in sports.
Each spoke very nicely but
the main theme seemed to
be in l'avor of athletic schol
arships, rather than under
the table pay, or handouts,
like tuitions and keep, for the
athletes' services rendered to
a school, in track, football or
other athletic events.
And as I listened I began
to think in terms of property
left to heirs, which is taxed
for inheritance tax. Then, as
income and finally, if it is
a corporation, corporation
taxes.
All along the line morality
is based on money or remun
eration in the realms cash.
Thus, if a property is loft
to an heir, and it was not
taxed, the property would be
the same.
Now, it is taxed — which
makes the property 110 more
or any less, as property.
Only the tax issue is the
extra basis on which the
property is transferred as a
gift - but, taxes makes this
a fallacious statement.
Now, if an athlete is given
his living, rent free, and even
some of his clothing bought
for him, does that make him
any better or any worse, as
an athlete? What of con
science, if any? The moral
issue here, is not seemingly
based on how much money
the athlete gets, but that he
loses his amateur standing.
No longer can he compete as
an amateur.
The morality of this "pay
as you go" venture, in ath
letic business -which is big
business today —- with the
scouting, and the binoculars
to watch better with, cheat
ing a little as it were, with
mechanical or scientific
methods of detecting what the
opposing players are up to,
stealing signals with high
powered glasses, even to
using television as a source
of close up information.
Managers all d trainers,
etc. use methods once we
might have considered as not
completely moral. But, I re
call many a little "crooked''
thing we kids did, when I was
a youngster and we played
games amongst ourselves.
Ah yes. we cheated, quite a
lot — but we didn't consider
it immoral to do it. It was
protecting ones self, and the
team, from getting caught
with pants down. We even
traded signals, and exchanged
players between us. It vv a s
part of the game. . . . This
constant intrigue and plan
ning to beat the other guys,
was an accepted spy system.
Maybe life is like that, like it
or not. Moral or not.
We may trade off our ama
teur standing for profes
sional, but does it make any
difference as to what we do
as professionals in our chosen
employment or athletic activi
ties or is it immoral?
It. VV. MADISON
Editor, The Daily:
In the last four years I
have seen the Stanford Daily
go through cycles of sophisti
cation from ludicrous to
worthwhile. Currently it is
riding at what I consider the
high mark of its career: na
tional and local news is clear
and concise; articles of stu
dent interest are presented
with vigor; and its handling
of campus affairs has demon
strated remarkable ability.
But at the same time I note
some characteristics that
seem to predict the cyclical
demise of the Daily:
1 1 Instead of confining it
self to the discussion of
issues in the last primary
campaign, it stepped into a
mire of personality conflict
that spread from the individ
ual columns to the front page
and the editorials. If the
Daily felt that one candidate
was superior then it was
their duty to say so. But it
should have been done fairly
and with respect to the issues
not just as a reaction
against criticism (perhaps
justified) of the Daily.
2) After a great deal of
space was devoted to the
"KZSU scandal," no mention
was made of the fact that a
special Legislative committee
had declared the charges un
founded and had exonerated
KZSU.
3) The editorial of Tues
day, May 12, entitled "The
Press and Vote Counting,"
was a blatant misrepresenta
tion of purpose and fact:
A 1 The purpose of exclud
ing the press during count
ing was in order to let the
Elections Judgments Board
determine whether or not
the fradulent ballots seri
ously affected the election.
If the results had been re
leased prematurely, and then
the election had been voided,
untold and totally unneces
sary damage would have
boon done to the enthusiasm
and morale of the separate
campaign groups.
B) The fradulent ballots
were not discovered on Wed
nesday as reported because
all but two of the boxes were
under lock and key at th e
ASSU Office. On Wednesday
Skip knew he could not ac
count for 100 ballots but
thought this was due to bal
lot transfer from poll to poll.
The actual fraud was not dis
covered until Thursday after
noon.
The Daily has improved tre
mendously in four years, but
I doubt that it will ever ap
proach the sophistication
worthy of the Stanford cam
pus until it can cure itself
of the paranoia it exhibits
when any criticism is made.
