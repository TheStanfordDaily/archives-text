## Friends In The North: Adopt A Freedom School 
### Vivian Bozman 
"The purpose of the Mississippi Freedom Schools is to help
Negro youth begin to question," a bulletin describing the role of
the Freedom Schools iu COFO's summer project, Operation Mis
sissippi, states.
Describing the Negro youth of Mississippi as living in an atmos
phere which has deprived them of a good education, free expres
sion, and free thought, the "Overview of the Freedom Schools"
emphasizes that the Freedom Schools will sock to make it possible
for Negro youth "to challenge the myths ot our society, to perceive
more clearly its realities, and to find alternatives, and, ultimately,
new directions for action.
In practical, day-to-day terms, this goal of opening the mind
of Negro youth to new questions and new opportunities means a
curriculum which will concentrate on three general areas: aca
demic work, recreation and cultural activities, and leadership de
velopment.

A TYPICAL DAY at a Freedom School will include both the
regular academic curriculum and concentrated individual work in
areas of the students' particular need or interest. The afternoon
work will focus on the non-academic curriculum, recreation, cul
j tural activities, and some tutoring. Evening activities will often
i center on voter registration work in order to provide the students
with a better understanding of the political problems and needs
of their community.
Funds for Freedom Schools are very limited. Mendy Samstein,
a COFO worker, in describing the problem ot the lack of funds,
writes, "Most Freedom Schools will have tobe held in church base
ments, homes, back yards, etc. . . . There will rarely be classrooms,
certainly no bells, and blackboards only if they can be scounged."
In order to help meet the problem of high aims and no money,
COFO has issued "A Proposal to Friends Outside the South," ask
ing clubs and community organizations to "Adopt a Freedom
School in Mississippi."
Adoption of a Freedom School would mean both provision of
material support in the way of funds, and, perhaps, what is ulti
mately more important, a breach in the wall between the two
worlds of the allluent white in the North and the impoverished
black in the South.

ORGANIZATIONS ARE URGED to begin soliciting funds
I necessary for renting buildings, feeding teachers and students,
furnishing the schools, and paying overhead expenses, reference
books, and major equipment.
Plans for creating a link of friendship between the adopting
organizations and the adopted students include correspondence
of individual students with individual members of the organiza
tions, the exchange of tape recordings or art exhibits, visits to the
school bv club members, and a possible joint-field trip to such
events as the Democratic Party Convention in Atlantic City.
Each Freedom School will have about fifty students from the
tenth and eleventh grades taught by fifteen teachers. The teachers
will be professional teachers and college students who have vol
unteered to work with COFO in Mississippi for the summer.
No Freedom Schools will be held in a community unless the
people of that community have expressed a desire for one and
have shown their support by finding low-cost housing for teachers
and seeking a location for the school itself.
In the atmosphere of the "Closed Society" of Mississippi, a
state whose legislators are even now in the process of formulating
more laws to limit free expression and restrict educational oppor
tunities, the promise of the Freedom Schools to create a new cur
rent of free thought in Mississippi's stilling air becomes even more
. significant.
An organization's adoption of a Freedom School provides that
group with the opportunity of aiding the beginning of the crea
tion of a free society, a type of society which has been a long
time coming.
