### 
A Stanford biochemist whose
i research has contributed toward
: understanding and ultimate con
, trol of heredity was honored last
j light as California Scientist of Ihc
Year.
| Dr. Paul Berg. 3S, professor of
i biochemistry at The Stanford
i School of Medi-

|ci n e, received

Dr. Berg re
j ceived an award

sentation was

made by Dr. Arthur Kornberg,
Stanford Nobel laureate and a
member of the .jury 1 hat selected
the science category winner.
Dr. Berg is the third Stanford
professor to win the prestigious
award and the first biochemist.
The other two are Dr. Robert
Hofstadter and Dr. William M.
Fairbank, both professors of
physics.
Dr. Berg was selected for his
accomplishment in work con
cerned with decoding the gen
etic or patterns which
determine how living cells make
proteins.
A full understanding of this
process as sought by Dr. Berg and
his research team, is felt to be es
sential for eventual prevention,
treatment and hopefully cure of
such hereditary diseases.
