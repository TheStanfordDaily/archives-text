SACRAMENTO, Calif. A changed outlook marks California's
presidential primary campaign as it heads into the final noisy round.

his supporters and turned his California contest with Sen. Barry
Goldwater into more of a race than anyone had expected.

last week declaring he can win the state's 80 delegates to the Re
publican National Convention if enough GOP voters turn out for
the June 2 election.
