### GUY FUNABIKI 
Last Thursday night, LASSU moved to cover a 34,250 delieit
account left by the Stanford Flying Club, which disbanded in
November, 1963.
According to Student Financial Manager Ed Shaw, rarely has
such a figure been paid by the LASSU Underwriting Reserve, a

fund which provides financial
backing for all student organiza
tions.
THI<; STANFORD Flying Club,
which was organized after World
War II by war veterans, has a his
lory of financial difficulties due
to a sparse membership w hi c h
cannot meet the high costs of air
plane ownership.
In 1961, the club borrowed $3.
200 from a private bank to buy a
new Piper Colt airplane. The Stu
dent Financial Manager paid off
the bank loan after hearing about
llie transaction, and transferred
the club's account to the Student
Organization Fund, granting them
a note of $5,200. (All student or
ganizations must work financially
with LASSU.) After $300 had
been paid by the club, no further
payments were made, leaving $4,-
700 on the airplane and a $1,600
deficit in their account.
"FltO.M then until the present,'"
said Shaw, "the flying club has
been allowed to continue in hopes
that it could lift itself up." But, he
said, "it is impossible for a flying
club to operate at Stanford and
use Iheir own plane there
aren't enough member. "
