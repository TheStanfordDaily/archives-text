# IMPROVED BUT INCONSISTENT
## Varsity Overcomes Alums 
### PETER EAKLAND 
Running was tho strong: poinl
of tho Stanford attack Saturday
during tho Alumni-Varsity con
test and tho passing was com
mendable when resorted to, but
Coach John Ralston deplored the
inconsistency, both on offense
and defense, a trait which seems
to bo ingrained in even the ablest
of Stanford eleven.
Tho final score was 3819, and
the Stickney awards presented t<
tho outstanding player on each
side went to Ray Hundley and
Steve Thurlow.
Junior Ray Handley, who last
year placed in the shadow of Dick
Ragsdale and Steve Thurlow
proved his billing as tho Cards'
top rusher next fall. He swept
end and went through the line
14 times and netted 101 yards and
two DT's.
HE USES his blockers woll and
even when a tackier gets his hand
on him ho spins free or falls for
word for several yards.
Ralston, although elated with
several well-executed offensive
drives that Terry DeSylvia and
Dave Lewis directed, was worried
that his forces couldn't keep the 1
pressure on all the time and
didn't have t ho killer instinct
necessary for a winning season.
Ho did, however, say tho team
at this stage of development looks
better than last year's team elid
after spring training. One reason
has been his emphasis on physic
al conditioning.
THE CROWD of over 3,000 saw
tho Alumni take an early load as
Dick Norman connected on a
slant in pass to Steve Thurlow
good for 57 yards. Gary Van
Galder threw a block on tho only
Stanford player with a chance to
catch the Giant-bound Thurlow.
But tho game was not going to
be a Norman conquest.

I Tho varsity needed but nine
i plays to even the count at 7-7.
Ray Handley and Terry DeSylvia
came up with tho big plays. Do-
Sylvia swept the end twice, once
i for 20 yards, and again for 4
J yards and the TD.
DICK BERG and DeSylvia com
! bined to move the ball into field
goal distance the next time Stan
ford got possession. From 35
I yards out, Braden Bock split tho
| uprights.
Alumni fumbles by Jack Taylor
and Thurlow helped the Stanford
! cause.
The first drive faltered, b u t.
i the 1 second produced a 46 yard
drive climaxing in Dave Lewis's
11 yard TR run. Rolling left and
finding t he outside congested, ho
j cut inside and found tho nocos
! sary running room.
I Before the half eneled, the
Alumni behind the strong right
arm of Norman narrowed the de
ficit to 17-13. Thurlow was again
tho receiver, this lime on a 19
yard sideline pass.
STANFORD quarterbacks com
pletod only three passes in the
first half but opened up their at
tack in Hie soconel half. DeSylvia

directed two of tho varsity's three
IT") drives in ihis half and movet
tho team primarily through t h<
air, completing five passes with
out an ineompletion.
His targets on the first driv<
were Handley who converted ;
short pass into a 28 yard gain
and "Flip" Wagner, who grabbe<
one over the middle for 11 yards
Ragsdale hauled in passes o
33 and 12 yards to move tho bal
to the IT in the last drive. A
this point, DoSylvia connecte<
with Handley and Handley rat
into tho end zone.
THE OTIIKR scoring drive o
tho second half took place at lh<
end of the third quarter. Handle}
again provided the long gainer:
on the ground. Bob Blunt anc
Myers also ran well. Myers wen
tho last yard for tho TD.
Dick Norman, boosted his pass
ing yardage to 169 yards with si:
completions when ho led ai
Alumni scoring drive in th<
fourth quarter. The clincher wa:
to Frank Patitucci on a slant ii
pattern netting 15 yards. Othei
receivers wore Thurlow, Rick Mc
Millan, Tom Williams, and Skij
Face.
