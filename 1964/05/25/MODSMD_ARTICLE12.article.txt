# Tribe Trackmen Disappoint: Finish Fourth In AAWU
## 
### TOM ELIAS Sports Editor 
j Payton Jordan was quoted be-
I fore the weekend as saying he
: would be happy if his Stanford
track team finished third in the
AAWU meet in Los Angeles. He
came home quite unhappy as his
, team placed fourth with 37 points
| to USC's 73. Cal's 41 and WSU's
40.
Stanford only had two real
highlights in the Saturday after-
I noem meet. Those came in the
j mile and the 880. Paul Se-hlicke,
the improving junior miler,
avenged an earlier loss to UCLA's
Bob Day when he captured his
I event in a meet record of 4=02.5.
DAY WAS fourth behind South
! ern Cal's Bruce Bess and WSU's
John Valiant, but diel sneak in
ahead of the Tribe's Harry Mo
1 Calla.
The other highlight came in the
XBO, where gutty Bill Pratt eked
j out a 1:50.3 victory over Cal's
Dave Fish back. Bob Miltz was a
1 big disappointment here, as the
j defending champ could not get
even one of tho first five places.
The real Stanford track high
; light of the weekend came in the
! California Relays at Modesto on
i Saturday night. Big Dave Weill,
the Tribe's NCAA discus champ
I last year, mewed into clear focus
i in the Olympic picture by becom
; ing only the seventh man and the
I fourth American to hurl tho disc
over 200 fee^t.
WEILL FLUNG his projectile
200'2" to take seconel behind
! world record holder A 1 Oeiior
! and ahead of former Olympians

Rink Babka and Jay Silvester.
Stanford's ono bis disappoint
ment in the conference meet was
the performance of co-captair
Steve Cortright. If Stanford was
to have come home a winner, 01
even in second place, Cortrigh.l
would have had to win two of the
three events in which hp com
peted.
He didn't.
After getting second place ir
his best event, the 120 yd. higl l
hurdles, fully four tenths of a
second back, Cortright proceedec
to take third in the triple jump
with a leap two feet less than his
season's best. But the big letdown
came in the 440 hurdles where
he finished dead last in a field ol
which he was clearly the class.
FORTUNATELY for the Tribe
Phil Arnaudo was able to corru
through with places in both
hurdles, second in the interme
diates and fourth in the highs.
Chuck Smith, beside Schlicke
and Pratt, was the only really
clutch Stanford performer, set
ting a school record in the pole
vault at 15-4.
Only one more really big col
lege meet remains for the track
team this season the NCAA
meet at Eugene, Ore. on June IS
-20. Stanford's upperelassmen,
who have failed the team all year,
will have to come through quite
well there, if the Indians are to
make any showing at all.
