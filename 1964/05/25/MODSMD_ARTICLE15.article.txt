"The question now is whether wo shall befoul our surround
ings more than i( is presentl\ belouled," began Alan Temko. speak
ing to a eapaeih audience in Ihe Weekly Art Lecture Series.
Temko declared thai piecemeal considerations have caused
both public and private schemes to be unworkable in some social

respects, though perhaps very sat
isfactory in a narrower sense.
Freeways and "smoke free' in
dustry were the butt of this criti
cism, as they introduce more cars, 1
tract homes, and asphalt ;is Ihoyi
"leapfrog through the orchards."!
CITING IX c'AMINO ns "all
thai is oozingly putrid in our
civilization," Temko called for his :
audience to "start thinking what !
harmony is, what no mogeneity
is ii is different from standard- j
ization."
Turning to the campus, Temko!
noted that the original quad has
this single l idiom of harmony, but ;
has been lost in much of the re-J
cent developments. Pine Hill!
places the faculty and staff in the
bosom of the university, he said,
but as an example of piecemeal
consideration in planning Pine
Hill also "sits there screaming, â€¢
'Hey, look at me! 1 use Life- (
bouy!' "
Temko called upon his audience
tn recognize a "new urban organ-:
ism," and to construct within ii
and for it a form and magnitude
appropriate to the locale and in
tention.
