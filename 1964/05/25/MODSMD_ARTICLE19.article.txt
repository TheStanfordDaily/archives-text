# LASSU Threatens Politics
## Editorial 
### 
The Political Union got what it wanted
at LASSU Thursday.
What it wanted was the disenfranehise
nient of on-canipus voluntary political
groups horn any influence in the regula
tory policies directed toward them. ASSU
President Bud Wedin, however, has vetoed
the action — a move we applaud under
the circumstances.
We feel confident that LASSU would
not have approved the proposed by-laws
changes if it had discussed them. But de
ltaic was prohibited, except for a few
perfunctory remarks on minor procedural
points, and the new by-laws for Political
Union were rushed through with only 21
of LASSU s 120 members present.
THE LATENESS OF the hour was
given as the reason for cutting off debate
before it was begun. In addition, the per
son who made the motion to "call the previ
ous question" claimed that the matter had
been discussed at the previous meeting of
LASSU. "Not so, interjected Clyde Chris
toffersen, but the motion was an undebat
able one and it sailed through with little
problem.
The advocates of the by-laws change—
the incumbent Political Union officers who

would be the only ones to vote in the up
coming election — claimed that they were
necessary to "bring the by-laws in line with
University policy and the ASSU Constitu
tion." This is utter nonsense.
The old by-laws were in no way con
flicting with anything the University or
ASSU had said or done. In truth, this ac
tion was merely a move to eliminate 011-
campus voluntary political groups — form
erly called Political Union "caucuses" —
from a vote in Political Union elections or
by-law amending proposals. The groups,
which have no representation in any Uni
versity bod)', would thus have no represen
tation in any ASSU body either. Last year,
the Political Union officers succeeded in
throwing them off the executive board.
THIS YEAR THEY tried to throw them
out of Political Union, although Political
Union still possesses the discretionary au
thority to approve or disapprove public pro
grams of the groups, as well as the useful
(to Political Union) tool of granting or
withholding financial and other assistance

to individual groups.
Most ironic was the proposal to elimi
nate the groups from any voice in changing
the Political Union by-laws. For the very
proposal that did this w as unconstitutionally
offered by the five Political Union officers,
rather than a meeting of the officers and
the chairmen of the groups, as required in
the by-laws.
Last Wednesday we called for a liberali
zation of University and ASSU policy to
ward political groups. Instead, we got the
unchallengeable power ol Political Union
concentrated in the hands of a few officers
who elect their successors from year to year
with no outside influences possible.
We recommend a meeting of the groups,
the Political Union officers, and a LASSU
committee to negotiate a workable settle
ment and framework for political activity
on campus.
The cause of partisan polities at Stan
ford suffered a setback by the LASSU ac
tion (for which most of I,ASSU is utterly
blameless).
Wed ill's veto will allow serious and full
discussion before sueli a major change is
made in the already tenuous status of parti
san politics on campus.
