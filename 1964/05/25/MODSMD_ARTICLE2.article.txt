# Controversy Surrounds I-Club Presidential Election
## 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM 
Mushy khosrovani was elected international Club president last
Friday amidst eontroversy, hut it appeared yesterday that the re
sults would stand. The eontroversy grew out of an erroneous ar
tielc in Fridays' Daily which stated the candidate was unopposed.
Actually he ran against Charlene Yagi, who did not announce
her candidacy until Thursday*

morning. Hashy defeated her by
a margin of six votes; there was
a total of 86 votes cast in the lec
tion.
A STATEMENT released on
Saturday by I-Club president Jeff
Lack, said that a full investiga
tion had been conducted by t he
the I-Club elections board and
that it had determined that "the
candidate benefitting from the
error was not responsible."
The statement also said that
both candidates had agreed before
the ballots were counted to abide
by the outcome. Lack refused yes
terday to comment further on the
statement.
The article in the Daily, written
by columnist Pell Fender, who is
a member of Khosrovani's frater
nity, stated that "the only offici
ally nominated candidate was
Hashy Khosrovani.' There was
some question as to whether Fen
der and the newly elected presi
dent were aware of the mistake
in t he story.
HASHY, who handed in the ar
ticle, said he was rushed at the
time and did not read its con
tents. Fender who was unavail
able for comment last night was,
according to Hashy, uncertain if
a second candidate was officially
entered in the race.
Miss Yagl said yesterday that
she was not sure if the matter

had been entirely settled. She
said, "some new things have come
to light that put this thing in
question." She said that some kind
of protest might be registered,
but she would not elaborate on
this possibility.
According to Khosrovani, how
ever, "everyone has been cleared."
"The way I personally see it,"he
| said, "the whole thing was fair."
HE ADDED, "I don't know why
the matter should continue, if the
| whole matter has been cleared up.
If they had a new election people
might conclude that some hanky
panky went on."
He called the Daily's incorrect
story "an unfortunate thing," but
j he was uncertain how much ef
fect it had on the outcome of the
election. Some of his supporters
may not have bothered to vote be
lieving him unopposed he pointed
out.
