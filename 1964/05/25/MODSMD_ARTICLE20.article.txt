## Chloradane Handling Protested 
### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: This let

Married Students Housing Di
reetor F. E. Gallagher, received
carbon copies.
Fditor, The Daily
I wish to protest the handling
of the Roach Control Program in
Stanford Village. Today I read in
the Daily that, upon the protest
of a Mr. Bennett, Mr. F. E. Gal
lagher. Director of Married Stu
dent Housing, had postponed the
Program after discovering that
the Chloradane compounds used
might be toxic to the children.
Our building was sprayed last
week on Thursday, May 14. We
were selected by the Married
Student Housing Office as a
"test" building — we were, in
effect, involuntary guinea pigs
for this "experiment." Our first
official notice and information
about the procedure and char
acter of the spraying did not
come until Monday night, the
eleventh of May. Tuesday, my
wife became very concerned
about the use of Chloradane and
called the Married Student Hous
ing Office to express her concern
and obtain more information. She
was blandly assured by the staff
of that office that the chemicals
were harmless.
On Wednesday I called th e
Stanford Village Office to ob
tain information about the chemi
cals, and what specific steps we
should be taking, other than those
sketchily outlined in the memo of
instructions we had received. I
was informed that many had been
calling, but that everything was
safe, and there was no cause for
concern.
I protest this cavalier handling
of our inquiries and an apparent
lack of concern for our safety.
This program was thrust upon
us, and while 1 can appreciate the
need for the spraying, I cannot
reconcile the fact that in two
buildings many children have
been needlessly and carelessly
exposed to harm. But for the for
tuitous intervention of Mr. Ben
nett, with his medical back
ground, all of the children in the
Village would have been similarly
exposed.
I. would think that, with such
a wealth of expert opinion avail
able at the University, Mr. Gal
lagher and other officials cou Id
have taken the simple step
which he belatedly did at the
insistence of Mr. Bennett — be
fore any buildings were sprayed.
Despite the apparently routine
approval granted by the Univer
sity Health Officer, and the San
Mateo Vector Control District, I
feel that Mr. Gallagher had a
duty to assure himself that, when
both he and his staff were casu
ally assuring those of us who
were concerned that there was
no chance of harm, they knew
what they were talking about.
