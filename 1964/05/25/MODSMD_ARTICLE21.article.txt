# SOCIALIST SUGGESTS
## Subsidy For A Free Press 
### 
It is an obvious observation
that a democratic Society can
function intelligently only if the
members of that society are ac
curately informed as to what is
happening in their society and
in the rest of the world. As it
becomes increasingly clear that
the uniformity of news reporting!
in the U.S. press is no more the j
result of accurate news coverage i
i

than is the uniformity of news in
the Soviet press, one is driven to
find an explanation for the fail
ure of the "free" press.
ONE explanation is an eco
nomic one. It is extremely expen
sive to establish and operate a
j newspaper. The price that the
I public pays covers only a portion
| of the cost of the publication, the
I rest being paid for by advert is

ins-. This reliance on advertising
! revenue has two negative effects
on accurate news coverage.
First, it encourages newspapers
to report the news in a manner
l which will not offend their ad
vertisers. This does not mean that
advertisers directly force their
views on the papers. Defense con
tractors do not say, "The war in
Vietnam is good for defense con
tracts and we will not advertise
unless you write encouraging re
ports of the war."
hint more general pressures do
exist. For example, the bulk of
advertisers are private concerns
I who find nationalization of prop
erty repugnant. Thus, after U.S.
! business assets were nationalized,
coverage of Cuban events prob
| ably reflected attitudes of adver
tisers at the expense of accuracy.
Second, since advertising reve
nues are related to circulation,
newspapers compete visciously
for readers. Whatever may be the
merits of competition among
business firms, competition for
readers tends to have a negative
effect on news reporting. Empha
i sis is shifted away from educative
news to news that will excite the
reader's interest. With only
limited space available, the result
!is that much news of value is
simply omitted. Furthermore,
news is often shaped to conform
to reader prejudices and stereo
! types.
Thus the high operating costs
(of newspapers, and the conse
quent heavy reliance on advertis
ing revenues, provides a partial
explanation for the poor quality
of news coverage in the U.S.
press. It helps explain the omis
sions, the distortions, and the in
accuracies of which more an d
more people are becoming aware.
Working from this premise. I
contend that news coverage
would be improved by a govern
ment subsidy to the press. I can
heai' the cries now. "The totali
tarian. He wishes to destroy our
freedom of the press." Quite the
contrary. It is I who wish to free
the "free" press.
The problem is, of course, how
to free the press from the preju
dices of advertisers and readers
without subsituting the preju
dices of the government. I be
lieve that this can be accom
plished by subsidizing all news
papers on the basis of the amount
of newsprint they use for non
advertising pur poses.
EAC H JOURNAL would keep
a record of the amount of news
print it uses for each issue.
Such a subsidy system s li o u 1 d
make it possible to expand th e
number of newspapers competing
for a given market. This would
mean that a broader spectrum
of views would be presented to
the community since the new edi
tors and publishers could be ex
pected to have different view
points and the publisher's or
editor's viewpoint does influence
the particular version of a news
item, and the particular news
items chosen for inclusion in the
paper.
And. of course, the pressure not
to upset advertisers would be re
lieved. As long as the subsidy is
based on some neutral item such
as newsprint, there is no reason
to believe that the government's
j influence would replace that of
: advert isers.
