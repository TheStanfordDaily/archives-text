# Notes And Observations
## Political Union Flays 'Big-Time Politics 
### John Bonine 
Last Friday the Political Union
sponsored a p a n e 1 on "Power
Politics." But last Thursday they
held a warm-up session in
LASSU.
Political Union has been tend
ing, for the last year, toward con
centration of power in the hands
of a few officers, unresponsive to
their constitutents fthe on-cam-
J pus political "groups") and their
problems. Perhaps this is a gen
eral law of bureaucratic organi
zations - the Law of Centripetal
Bureaucracy.
Last year', when by-laws revi
sion was being discussed in the
Political Union executive board
meetings, then-president Jan De
bakesy cried out at one proposal:
"But if you do that, how are we
going to remain big-time?" How.
indeed, will Political Union ever
become "big-time" if it continues
to work against, rather than for.
political activity at Stanford?
Political Union falsely e o n
tended, in a printed statement
distributed at Thursday night's
LASSU meeting, that "No offi
cial relationship exists between
voluntary groups and the Politi
cal Union Board." This, despite at
least a dozen provisions in the
Political Union by-laws relating
to and mentioning by name vol
untary groups- -provisions which
true enough. Political Union suc
ceeded in getting for the most
part amended out before the eve
ning was over.
They falsely contended that "at
no time were voluntary groups
officially registered with the
Political Union Board." This, de
spite the fact that many such
groups had completed all requi
site steps and that Political Union
has, according their by-laws,
no discretion irr the matter of
accepting or rejecting groups
wishing to register.
Most important, however', is the
issue of the status of political
groups on campus. Quite a break
through was achieved last year
when the Trustees approved a
new policy allowing partisan
groups on campus for the first
time in Stanford history. Many
tortuous hours were spent in
Political Union executive board
meetings, devising a new system
to meet the new circumstances.
That system was, on Thursday,
junked in one fell swoop.
The Political Union is, under
the Trustees' policy, charged with
"sponsor ing" programs presented
l>\ the "runiv- Imm the occasion

last week, Political Union co n
tended that this power was "a
transitory one." That means
"temporary," but the power is no
such thing. The Political Union
can veto programs, require some
organizations to pay extraordi
nary expenses (such as student
police) and others not. and gener
ally harass whatever groups have
fallen out of their favor.
This, in fact, has been done, and
quite recently. One of the guid
ing principles of Political Union's
philosophy, for instance, is that
larger groups should have to pay
their expenses while smaller ones
should not, according to Andy
Williams, second vice president.
Another is that no two public
programs by partisan groups
should be scheduled in the same
day, regardless of the differing
times and places and regardless
of the impossibility of alternate
scheduling.
If Political Union were to be
merely a speaker's bureau, no t
having the power to regulate vol
untary groups (whose members
total at this point nearly 500, com
pared to Political Union's five
members), little objection could
be raised to their excluding others
from a voice in their powers. But
they have one of the biggest regu
latory jobs on campus (whether
they should is another question),
and to have no restraints upon
their actions is, by any definition,
despotism.
If, despite Bud Wedin's veto,
Political Union succeeds in get
ting their "reforms" passed, Poli
tical Union elections will depend
upon how well a person pleases
the incumbent Political Uuio n
officers. Why elections will even
be necessary is a puzzle. Certainly
there will be no way to seek im
provements irr either the leader
ship or policies of Political Union,
since they posses an unbreakable
monopoly on political activity on
campus if you don't play their
game, you simply are rrot allowed
to play at all.
Will their power be misused?
To quote from the second vice
president last year, in the Stan
ford Daily: "The Political Union
has never been a 'big brother' to
its caucuses, and won't be to the
I Young Republicans, Young Demo
crats, etc., but If I hey do gef, out
of line, we will step in." (Bold
face added.)
And they have stepped in, re
peatedly. And this lime it

To quote from the second vice

Last Friday the Political Union

Last year', when by-laws revi

Political Union executive board
meetings, then-president Jan De

"But if you do that, how are we

political activity at Stanford?
Political Union falsely e o n
tended, in a printed statement
distributed at Thursday night's
LASSU meeting, that "No offi
cial relationship exists between
voluntary groups and the Politi
cal Union Board." This, despite at
least a dozen provisions in the
Political Union by-laws relating
to and mentioning by name vol
untary groups- -provisions which
true enough. Political Union suc
ceeded in getting for the most
part amended out before the eve
ning was over.
They falsely contended that "at
no time were voluntary groups
officially registered with the
Political Union Board." This, de
spite the fact that many such
groups had completed all requi
site steps and that Political Union
has, according their by-laws,
no discretion irr the matter of
accepting or rejecting groups
wishing to register.
Most important, however', is the
issue of the status of political
groups on campus. Quite a break
through was achieved last year
when the Trustees approved a
new policy allowing partisan
groups on campus for the first
time in Stanford history. Many
tortuous hours were spent in
Political Union executive board
meetings, devising a new system
to meet the new circumstances.
That system was, on Thursday,
junked in one fell swoop.
The Political Union is, under
the Trustees' policy, charged with
"sponsor ing" programs presented

last week, Political Union co n
tended that this power was "a
transitory one." That means
"temporary," but the power is no
such thing. The Political Union
can veto programs, require some
organizations to pay extraordi
nary expenses (such as student
police) and others not. and gener
ally harass whatever groups have
fallen out of their favor.
This, in fact, has been done, and
quite recently. One of the guid
ing principles of Political Union's
philosophy, for instance, is that
larger groups should have to pay
their expenses while smaller ones
should not, according to Andy
Williams, second vice president.
Another is that no two public
programs by partisan groups
should be scheduled in the same
day, regardless of the differing
times and places and regardless
of the impossibility of alternate
scheduling.
If Political Union were to be
merely a speaker's bureau, no t
having the power to regulate vol
untary groups (whose members
total at this point nearly 500, com
pared to Political Union's five
members), little objection could
be raised to their excluding others
from a voice in their powers. But
they have one of the biggest regu
latory jobs on campus (whether
they should is another question),
and to have no restraints upon
their actions is, by any definition,
despotism.
If, despite Bud Wedin's veto,
Political Union succeeds in get
ting their "reforms" passed, Poli
tical Union elections will depend
upon how well a person pleases

Last Friday the Political Union
sponsored a p a n e 1 on "Power
Politics." But last Thursday they
held a warm-up session in
LASSU.
Political Union has been tend
ing, for the last year, toward con
centration of power in the hands
of a few officers, unresponsive to
their constitutents fthe on-cam-
J pus political "groups") and their
problems. Perhaps this is a gen
eral law of bureaucratic organi
zations - the Law of Centripetal
Bureaucracy.
Last year', when by-laws revi
sion was being discussed in the
Political Union executive board
meetings, then-president Jan De
bakesy cried out at one proposal:
"But if you do that, how are we
going to remain big-time?" How.
indeed, will Political Union ever
become "big-time" if it continues
to work against, rather than for.
political activity at Stanford?
Political Union falsely e o n
tended, in a printed statement
distributed at Thursday night's
LASSU meeting, that "No offi
cial relationship exists between
voluntary groups and the Politi
cal Union Board." This, despite at
least a dozen provisions in the
Political Union by-laws relating
to and mentioning by name vol
untary groups- -provisions which
true enough. Political Union suc
ceeded in getting for the most
part amended out before the eve
ning was over.
They falsely contended that "at
no time were voluntary groups
officially registered with the
Political Union Board." This, de
spite the fact that many such
groups had completed all requi
site steps and that Political Union
has, according their by-laws,
no discretion irr the matter of
accepting or rejecting groups
wishing to register.
Most important, however', is the
issue of the status of political
groups on campus. Quite a break
through was achieved last year
when the Trustees approved a
new policy allowing partisan
groups on campus for the first
time in Stanford history. Many
tortuous hours were spent in
Political Union executive board
meetings, devising a new system
to meet the new circumstances.
That system was, on Thursday,
junked in one fell swoop.
The Political Union is, under
the Trustees' policy, charged with
"sponsor ing" programs presented
l>\ the "runiv- Imm the occasion

last week, Political Union co n
tended that this power was "a
transitory one." That means
"temporary," but the power is no
such thing. The Political Union
can veto programs, require some
organizations to pay extraordi
nary expenses (such as student
police) and others not. and gener
ally harass whatever groups have
fallen out of their favor.
This, in fact, has been done, and
quite recently. One of the guid
ing principles of Political Union's
philosophy, for instance, is that
larger groups should have to pay
their expenses while smaller ones
should not, according to Andy
Williams, second vice president.
Another is that no two public
programs by partisan groups
should be scheduled in the same
day, regardless of the differing
times and places and regardless
of the impossibility of alternate
scheduling.
If Political Union were to be
merely a speaker's bureau, no t
having the power to regulate vol
untary groups (whose members
total at this point nearly 500, com
pared to Political Union's five
members), little objection could
