# ADMISSIONS PROCEDURE
## Equation Weighs Personal', Academic Factors 
### MICHAEL ROSTER (First of Three Articles) 
It's a luto Thursday night in the middle of March.
Gathered in a small second floor room, surrounded by
stacks of manila folders and long lines of metal file
cabinets, are seven members of the Office of Admissions
staff.
Their .job is a difficult one. From 7,000 applicants
they must form Stanford's next freshman class with an
enrollment .just under 1,300.
"We turn down many very fine people who just don't
measure up to those with whom they are competing."
said Dr. Stirling Huntley, Associate Director of Admis
sions. But "measure up" is a vague term in itself.
TO UNDERSTAND how this seven-man committee
does "measure" Stanford applicants each year, it is
necesary to review the exact procedure followed.
When an applicant begins submitting the basic pre
liminary forms, a folder is established for him. Here
are kept letters of recommendation, reports of high
school grades, and records of college board scores.
When all data are received â€” including seventh se
mester grades the applicant is rated by a predeter
mined equation.
EXPERIMENTS with this equation were first made
eight years ago. For four years the equation's predic
tions wore compared to actual performances of students

admitted by other processes. When it was finally re
fined and proven accurate, the equation was made opera
tional.
Applicants are rated in two areas: personal and aca
demic. Stress is divided into 70 per cent on academic
achievement and 30 per cent on personal qualification.
Scores for these two areas are written in two boxes on
the front of each student's folder.
Personal rating is by letter: A, B, C, or D. It is
determined by a review of the student's letters of recom
menations, his activities in high school, and other infor
mation.
ACADEMIC PREDICTION is by a three-digit num
ber. It is, in effect, a prediction of the student's grade
point average if he were to complete studies at Stan
ford. For example, on outstanding applicant might be
predicted, on the basis of high school grades and college
board scores, to achieve a 3.68 GPA.
For academic prediction, high school grades receive
more weight than board scores. Also, the college board
verbal test is given more stress than the mathematics
aptitude test.
Applicants are then placed in ranked order by com
bining personal rating and academic prediction. Of the
total number of be accepted, around 1.2(H), or roughly
65 per cent, are admitted on tlie basis of this ranking
alone.

THh' REMAINING 600 to 7<M) students to bo ad
mitted, however, are taken from the next 1,400 students
on tiie list. (More students are admitted than will
eventually enroll.) This group is admitted by election
of the seven-man committee.
In this group the committee attempts to get a diver
sity of students that the equation it self does not take
into consideration. Applicants of alumni parents, by a
policy set by the academic council 60 years ago, are also
given a slight preference here.
Recommendations from the athletic department and
the music department are also considered in this group.
MEMBERS OF the committee may vote in th roe
ways after considering each student's folder: accept the
student, place him on a waiting list, or reject him. A
plurality of the committee rules.
Students on the waiting list are then accepted on the
basis of the number of accept votes they received.
BECAUSE NO information of financial need is in
cluded in the folder, applicants are not penalized if they
will require scholarship assistance. Many universities
do consider this information during the processing of
applications.
The procedure, then, is well defined. But what prob
lems are inherent to college admissions? And what is
Stanford trying to do to correct those problems?
Those areas will be taken up in the next two articles.
