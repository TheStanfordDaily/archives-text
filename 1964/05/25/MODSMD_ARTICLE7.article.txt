(toed the change in tho Political!
Union by-laws last Friday h 112 to 1 1 j
LASSU had approved tho change
I by more than a two-thirds major
ity of the members present (21
i out of 120).
j The veto is the first in LASSU's
j history.
Till-: ( lIANGF ill the by-laws
would have excluded I Ik 1 chair
men of the "voluntary groups"
| 011 campus from voting for offi
cers of the Political Union.
Wedin said that since the Poli
tical Union is charged with spon
soring the groups, tho groups
should have a vote in electing the
Union's executive board.
Andy Williams, second vice-
I president of the Political Union,
said ho was "surprised" at We
' din's action. He said the Political
Union "intends to lake the veto
to LASSU and ask that it be over
ridden."
WILLIAMS SAIl) that "no offi
cial relationship exists between
voluntary groups and the Politi
cal Union Board." Under the
changed by-alws, however, the sec
ond vice president would still
have charge of scheduling a n d
coordinating open meeting an d j
j functions of the groups. This is!
to prevent, for example, two
groups presenting speakers at the j
j same time.
Williams claimed tho Political i
| Union is not allowed to register i
voluntary groups because of last
j year's Board of Trustee's state-j
ment. Registration is a function
of the Student Affairs and Serv
ices Committee, he said.
JOHN BOM MO, former mem-1
j ber of the Political Union Execu-
I tive Board, said that the Trustees I
! ruling did not prevent gr o up s !
J from registering with Political
Union, nor group chairmen from I
voting in Political Union elections, j
Williams contended they had
never had a vote in the past.
Bonine denied, however, th a I I
groups had never had the right ]
to vote. "Wo simply have had no
issues or elections come up this 1
year."

voluntary groups and the Politi
cal Union Board." Under the
changed by-alws, however, the sec
ond vice president would still
have charge of scheduling a n d
coordinating open meeting an d j
j functions of the groups. This is!
to prevent, for example, two
groups presenting speakers at the j
j same time.
Williams claimed tho Political i
| Union is not allowed to register i
voluntary groups because of last
j year's Board of Trustee's state-j
ment. Registration is a function
of the Student Affairs and Serv
ices Committee, he said.
JOHN BOM MO, former mem-1
j ber of the Political Union Execu-
I tive Board, said that the Trustees I
! ruling did not prevent gr o up s !
J from registering with Political
Union, nor group chairmen from I
voting in Political Union elections, j
Williams contended they had
never had a vote in the past.
Bonine denied, however, th a I I
groups had never had the right ]
to vote. "Wo simply have had no
issues or elections come up this 1
year."
