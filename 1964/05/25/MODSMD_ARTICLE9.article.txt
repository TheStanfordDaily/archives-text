### BOB COX 
The University lias form
alized its regulations regard
ing demonstrations on cam
pus.
The rules were stated in
lull in a News Service re
lease of last Friday. Th e y
are designed to allow mem
bers of the University com
munity to protest actions
and opinions with w hi c h
they disagree, while pre
serving the dignity of Uni
versity ceremonies an d a
serious academic atmos
phere.
Demonstrations may he
held in public areas as long
as they are conducted in an
orderly manner and do not
interfere with classes or
ceremonies.
Bob Beyers, director of
News and Publications, told
the Daily yesterday,"I think
it is fair to say that a fairly
normal practice lias been
followed here. We're simply
putting our policies into
writing."
The newly â€¢ formalized
rules were recommended by
the Dean of Students and
approved by the President's
office. Beyers indicated that
they were also discussed on
several different occasions
by the President's commit
tee on Student Affairs and
Services, the Committee on

University Policy, and by
the officers of ASSU.
lie stressed that no one
office actually conceived the
regulations or had arbitrary
authority in their formula
tion. They are the product
of discussion by several of
fices and committees a n d
are based on the policy the
University has for some
time followed concerning:
campus demonstrations.
Beyers related two of the
specific incidents on which
the regulations are based.
Kit Haviee, a Stanford
student, picketed commence
ment ceremonies last spring.
She carried a placard stat
ing that she welcomed Gen
eral Norstad, but not NATO.
She was given permission to
carry on her protest if she
confined it to the area
around the amphitheater,
but her request to go inside
and sit with the graduating
seniors was denied.
Another incident was tho
picketing of Me m o rial
Church last September by a
group of pacifists, some of
them non-Stanford people.
Their protest was part of a
series of demonstrations in
the Palo Alto area by a
group led by Ira Sand perl.
The picketing allegedly
interferred with church ser
vices and was stopped.
