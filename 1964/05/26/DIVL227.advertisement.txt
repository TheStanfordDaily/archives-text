THE HEART OF EVERY PROBLEM
When the Bible says heart,' it is not talking about a four-chambered pulmon
ary pump, but about the innermost part of man—the real you.
Keep thy heart with all diligence,- for out of it are the issues of life.'' Pro
verbs 4:23.
But the Lord said unto Samuel, look not on his countenance, or on the height
of his stature,- because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth;
for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart."
I Sam. 16:7.
The Bible also states that all men have sinned and come short of the glory of
God.
"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know
it? ' (Jeremiah 17:9).
The basis of all sin is pride and self centeredness which means a desire to
exalt ourselves rather than Cod and to go our own way. Natural man lusts
instead of loves and takes instead of gives. "All we like sheep have gone
astray,- we have turned every one to his own way ... ( Is. 53.6).
Only God can work a miracle in the "heart" of man and free him from the
domination of self. When a person accepts Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour,
a wonderful transformation takes place:
"Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed
away; behold all things are become new." (II Cor. 5:17).
' And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and
I will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of
flesh." (Ezekiel 11:19).
In view of the seriousness of sin and the lost condition of man, it is indeed
a wonder of His marvelous grace that He has chosen to pay thr> price of our
salvation:
' For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for a good man
someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward
us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then having
now been justified by His blood wo shall be saved from the wrath of God I
| through Him. For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through j
the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by |
His life." (Rom. 5 6-10 NASV).
It is our sincere hope and prayer that you, too, will meet Jesus Christ. You can ,
know Him personally the minute you accept on faith the fact that Christ was
God in human form. "For we also once were foolish ourselves, foolish, diso- ]
bedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life j
in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another. But when the kindness of i
God our Saviour and His love for manl ind appeared, He saved us, not on the j
basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His !
mercy by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, whom
He poured out on us i cl ly through Jesus Christ our Saviour, that being justified j
! by faith, we might be made hens according to the. hop'- of eternal life."
(Titus 3:3-7 NASV).

us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then having
now been justified by His blood wo shall be saved from the wrath of God I
| through Him. For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through j
the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by |
His life." (Rom. 5 6-10 NASV).
It is our sincere hope and prayer that you, too, will meet Jesus Christ. You can ,
know Him personally the minute you accept on faith the fact that Christ was
God in human form. "For we also once were foolish ourselves, foolish, diso- ]
bedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life j
in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another. But when the kindness of i
God our Saviour and His love for manl ind appeared, He saved us, not on the j
basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His !
mercy by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, whom
He poured out on us i cl ly through Jesus Christ our Saviour, that being justified j
! by faith, we might be made hens according to the. hop'- of eternal life."
(Titus 3:3-7 NASV).

THE HEART OF EVERY PROBLEM
When the Bible says heart,' it is not talking about a four-chambered pulmon
ary pump, but about the innermost part of man—the real you.
Keep thy heart with all diligence,- for out of it are the issues of life.'' Pro
verbs 4:23.
But the Lord said unto Samuel, look not on his countenance, or on the height
of his stature,- because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth;
for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart."
I Sam. 16:7.
The Bible also states that all men have sinned and come short of the glory of
God.
"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know
it? ' (Jeremiah 17:9).
The basis of all sin is pride and self centeredness which means a desire to
exalt ourselves rather than Cod and to go our own way. Natural man lusts
instead of loves and takes instead of gives. "All we like sheep have gone
astray,- we have turned every one to his own way ... ( Is. 53.6).
Only God can work a miracle in the "heart" of man and free him from the
domination of self. When a person accepts Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour,
a wonderful transformation takes place:
"Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed
away; behold all things are become new." (II Cor. 5:17).
' And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and
I will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of
flesh." (Ezekiel 11:19).
In view of the seriousness of sin and the lost condition of man, it is indeed
a wonder of His marvelous grace that He has chosen to pay thr> price of our
salvation:
' For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for a good man
someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward
us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then having
now been justified by His blood wo shall be saved from the wrath of God I
| through Him. For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through j

it? ' (Jeremiah 17:9).
The basis of all sin is pride and self centeredness which means a desire to
exalt ourselves rather than Cod and to go our own way. Natural man lusts
instead of loves and takes instead of gives. "All we like sheep have gone
astray,- we have turned every one to his own way ... ( Is. 53.6).
Only God can work a miracle in the "heart" of man and free him from the
domination of self. When a person accepts Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour,
a wonderful transformation takes place:
"Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed
away; behold all things are become new." (II Cor. 5:17).
' And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and
I will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of
flesh." (Ezekiel 11:19).
In view of the seriousness of sin and the lost condition of man, it is indeed
a wonder of His marvelous grace that He has chosen to pay thr> price of our
salvation:
' For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for a good man
someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward
us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then having
now been justified by His blood wo shall be saved from the wrath of God I
| through Him. For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through j
the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by |
His life." (Rom. 5 6-10 NASV).
It is our sincere hope and prayer that you, too, will meet Jesus Christ. You can ,
know Him personally the minute you accept on faith the fact that Christ was
God in human form. "For we also once were foolish ourselves, foolish, diso- ]
bedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life j
in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another. But when the kindness of i
God our Saviour and His love for manl ind appeared, He saved us, not on the j
basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His !
mercy by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, whom
He poured out on us i cl ly through Jesus Christ our Saviour, that being justified j
! by faith, we might be made hens according to the. hop'- of eternal life."
(Titus 3:3-7 NASV).

THE HEART OF EVERY PROBLEM
When the Bible says heart,' it is not talking about a four-chambered pulmon
ary pump, but about the innermost part of man—the real you.
Keep thy heart with all diligence,- for out of it are the issues of life.'' Pro
verbs 4:23.
But the Lord said unto Samuel, look not on his countenance, or on the height
of his stature,- because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth;
for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart."
I Sam. 16:7.
The Bible also states that all men have sinned and come short of the glory of
God.
"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know
it? ' (Jeremiah 17:9).
