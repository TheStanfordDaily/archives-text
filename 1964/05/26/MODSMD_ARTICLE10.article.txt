"For the first tlnic in Stan
ford history, a Young Demo
crats group has been success*
fully established," said YD
President Hoh Honka, in a re
cent interview. "With over 150
members, we have grown into
the largest Collegiate \I)
group West of the Rockies."
Honka and Doug Parker,
both history majors, became
interested in setting up a YD
group at Stanford last sum
mer while they worked as poli
tical interns in the Stanford
in-Washington program.
"After talking with National
Young Democrats in Washing
ton, it became apparent t hat
Stanford was tlie only great
University that did not have
a permanent, viable Demo
cratic Club," continued Ronka.
When the two returned to
Stanford in the lull, they found
enough Democratic interest to
lay the groundwork for a club.
When the group met in Octo
ber to approve the constitution.

it had 72 charter members. A
m e m I) e r s li ip drive was
launched and since then the
membership figure lias risen.
The club has presented a
series of speakers beginning
with Gov. iodiiiund <«. (I'at)
Brown of California, anil in
cluding Senator Frank Church

Ronka summed up, saying:
"I believe that our successful
efforts this past year have
done much to dispell the myth
that Stanford is a sanctuary of
political conservatism and have
shown that responsible liber
alism can be a positive, dy
namic force on this campus."
