"We feel thai it's our ,jol> to
preach the Bible—Hie LORD
will take care of laughter."
Her blue eyes were wide
and calm, her clear voice
assured as she explained the
motivation of the Christians
of Box 117})!. who spend as
much as $10 a day on adver
tising in The Daily, and as
much again in the San Jose
and San Francisco State stu
dent newspapers.
Besides composing the
heavily Biblical ads, Paula
Fern translates scientific lit
erture — mostly math and
astronomy — from Russian.
She and her partner. Lambert
Dolphin, a physicist at Stan
ford Research Institute, rep
resent a rare phenomenon in
a college community — th e
Christian True Believer.
'Mystics in modern dress,
they feel that through faith
in the Bible they have estab
lished a personal relationship
with ( hrist.
'It is the narrow gate to
abundant life," Dolphin says;
he speaks very quietly, but
with restrained fire always in
his voice. The "care and con
cern tor people" brought to
them by conversion — both
claim dramatc personal con
versions after periods of re
sistance — has led them to
launch this "missionary proj
ect" among college students.
They feel called to aid the
heat liens of the Bay Area as
others have been called to
Africa and India.
From the three schools this
year they have received about

100 l»>Uers. About half were
from other True Believers,
praising their work; most of
file rest were serious inquir
ies. Fewer than 10 were an
gry or insulting. "And they're
not angry at us, usually,
they're an {fry at the words
we've quoted from the Bihle,"
>liss Fern murmurs in awed
delight. "We don't mind —it
shows they're starting to
think!"
They say they have never
had to worry about funds.
"The Lord provides the
money," is their quiet ex
planation, delivered with the
same distant fire. The Lord
Works through a fund set up
at the author's First Baptist
Church in (Los Altos); they
also contribute money of
their own.
Dolphin hastens to explain
that the ad-writing is seper
ale from the church, although
they do get some help with
Biblical accuracy.
lie has been with SKI for
seven years, after graduate
school at Stanford. Though
well-off physically, he was
bothered by an "inner empti
ness" until his conversion a
year and a half ago. "My life
was just running on toward
death," he recalls wondering
ly. Before Christ, he had tried
psychiatry and the Oriental
religions.
.Miss Fern, also a Stanford
graduate, converted herself
over her parents' objections—
they tried to bring her up
without, religion and at one
point even took her Bihle
away and forbade her to go
to church.
