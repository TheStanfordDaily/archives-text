# Interviews Today Fur NSA Reps
## Student Congress Slated For August 
### 
Stanford's delegation to the Na
tional Student Congress, August j
KJ-27, at the University of Minne
sota, will be chosen this week.
The purpose of the congress is
to give Stanford students a
chance to meet students from;
other schools who are interested
in national and international stu
dent affairs, and in the role of
students in American society and
politics.
IN* THK PAST the Congress
has discussed and acted on such
groups as the Peace Corps, and
VVUS, and financially endorsed
several exchanges with other stu
dent unions. Students form the
committees, introduce ideas, and j
eventually vote on the plenary
floor to approve or disapprove the
association's annual activities.
Stanford sends six voting dele
gates and three alternates to the?
Congress. Most of these delegates
are selected from a general list,
including the ASSU president, the
vice-president, the IFC president,
Hie Daily editor, and others.
However, three can be selected
from the student body at large.
In an attempt to give everyone
who might be interested in going
a chance to find out about the
Congress and what he would do
there, open interviews were held
yesterday and will be held today
from 4:30-5:30 p.m. at the NSA
desk in the ASSU office.
AT THE SAME TIME that the
delegation will be selected there
will be interviews for the position i
of NSA co-ordinator, in case
there is someone vitally interested
in NSA who has gone undiscov
ered during this past year.
The coordinator's job is to ar
range NSA programs for the
Stanford campus. Next year, one
project begun last fall will carry
over, and among other duties, the
coordinator will lie planning a |
spring vacation and a summer
work camp.
The coordinator also goes to |
the National Congress, as one of!
the six official voting delegates.'
