## I-Club Election 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The recant International Club
ejection has created much con
troversy and heated emotional dis
cussion among members of the
club and others who hold it in
high esteem. The coverage of the
election in The Daily was par
ticularly damaging to one of the
candidates by completely omit
ting any reference to her. It is
understood that this can bo in
no way attributed to the paper's
policy which has always been fair,
hut to the abuse of the facilities
by a member of the staff.
It is indeed unfortunate that
the staff member who wrote the
article did so at the request of a
fraternity brother who was one
of the candidates. The candidate
presented the article in person to
The Daily for inclusion in Friday's
publication.
Due to the closeness of the elec
tion results (only a six vote dif
ference tit is felt that the con
spiracy of the fraternity brothers
and abuse of Daily space was
probably more than sufficient to
sway the result.
The International Club has al
ways been one of the most active
groups on the campus and is cap
able of living and developing
through any crisis. Efforts to cov
er up the facts of what really hap
pened will only serve lo discredit
the club, the campus newspaper
and one of the most internation
ally conscious and progressive fra
ternities in our midst.

Editor, The Daily
The statement "The Caliphs
and Mohammad himself were
men of the sword" that appeared
under the headline "Rent/. Views
Moselm World" in the Daily of
May 20 does not correctly de
scribe these men and the Prophet
of Islam. Quite to the contrary,
they were the advocates of peace
and harmony and the living up
to of the highest principles. They
did believe in self defense and as
a last resort, did so fight when
compelled to do so.

In brief answer to Mr. Felling's
letter, I would like to clear up a
few points of difference. In the
first place, I did mention in my
original letter that the man Mr.
Belli obtained $300,000 settlement
for was in a public position, but
The Daily chose to edit it. I also
cited Mr. Belli's boast that he re
fused to shake Judge Brown's ex
tended hand with the comment
"You have blood on your hands,"
which The Daily also deleted. In !
my opinion such statement arc
equally, if not more, malicious
and libelous as those that Mr.
Belli told us were used against
his client.
Secondly, my criticism was not
aimed just at Mr. Belli, but
equally as much at those students
who took his "facts" as truths,
and not as "frank and personal
opinions" as Mr. Pelling did. My i
objection was leveled at those stu
dents who would accept and re j
peat his statements as fact with- •
out verifying them; statements j
that were to me and.it would
seem, to Mr. Pelling. obvious dis
tortious.

The recant International Club
ejection has created much con
troversy and heated emotional dis
cussion among members of the
club and others who hold it in
high esteem. The coverage of the
election in The Daily was par
ticularly damaging to one of the
candidates by completely omit
ting any reference to her. It is
understood that this can bo in
no way attributed to the paper's
policy which has always been fair,
hut to the abuse of the facilities
by a member of the staff.
It is indeed unfortunate that
the staff member who wrote the
article did so at the request of a
fraternity brother who was one
of the candidates. The candidate
presented the article in person to
The Daily for inclusion in Friday's
publication.
Due to the closeness of the elec
tion results (only a six vote dif
ference tit is felt that the con
spiracy of the fraternity brothers
and abuse of Daily space was
probably more than sufficient to
sway the result.
The International Club has al
ways been one of the most active
groups on the campus and is cap
able of living and developing
through any crisis. Efforts to cov
er up the facts of what really hap
pened will only serve lo discredit
the club, the campus newspaper
and one of the most internation
ally conscious and progressive fra
ternities in our midst.

Editor, The Daily
The statement "The Caliphs
and Mohammad himself were
men of the sword" that appeared
under the headline "Rent/. Views
Moselm World" in the Daily of
May 20 does not correctly de
scribe these men and the Prophet
of Islam. Quite to the contrary,
they were the advocates of peace
and harmony and the living up
to of the highest principles. They
did believe in self defense and as
a last resort, did so fight when
compelled to do so.

Editor, The Daily:
In brief answer to Mr. Felling's
letter, I would like to clear up a
few points of difference. In the
first place, I did mention in my
original letter that the man Mr.
Belli obtained $300,000 settlement
for was in a public position, but
The Daily chose to edit it. I also
cited Mr. Belli's boast that he re
fused to shake Judge Brown's ex
tended hand with the comment
"You have blood on your hands,"
which The Daily also deleted. In !
my opinion such statement arc
equally, if not more, malicious
and libelous as those that Mr.
Belli told us were used against
his client.
Secondly, my criticism was not
aimed just at Mr. Belli, but
equally as much at those students
who took his "facts" as truths,
and not as "frank and personal
opinions" as Mr. Pelling did. My i
objection was leveled at those stu
dents who would accept and re j
peat his statements as fact with- •
out verifying them; statements j
