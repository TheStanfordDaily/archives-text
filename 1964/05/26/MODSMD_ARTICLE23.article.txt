## Civil Rights Bill In Congress Passage Without Compromise Constitutional Questions 
### NELSON ROCKEFELLER Governor of New York BARRY GOLDWATER Senator from Arizona 
The Daily asked Mr. Goldwater
and Mr. Rockefeller to comment
on the Civil Rights hill —especially
the public accommodations sec
tion.

This nation was created to give expression,
validity and purpose to our spiritual heritage
proclaiming the supreme worth and dignity <if
each individual. Our task today is to help make
this heritage a reality for all by guaranteeing
each individual equality of opportunity and the
rights that are his under the U.S. Constitution.
As a Republican, I take pride in the fact
that ours is the Party of Abraham Lincoln. Our
Party was born in the fight to make men free.
It did make men free. More recently, under the
leadership of President Eisenhower, the first
two civil rights bills since the Civil War Re
construction Period were passed.
I believe that the right of equal opportunity
for all citizens is the responsibility of all levels
of government.
As Governor of New York. I have used every
means available to me - executive action, leg
islation, encouragement of private action —- to
assure equality for all citizens of New York.
Since I took office, New York State has among
other things:
Broadened the ban against discrimination
in public accommodations. (New York's experi
ence with this law has been very successful.)
Banned discrimination in the sale of all
private housing and in the rental of all except
owner-occupied one- and two-family dwellings
and apartments.
Tightened the ban on discrimination in ap
prenticeship and job-training programs.
Initiated new procedures for the effective
enforcement of State laws against employment
discrimination. Authorized counties, towns, cit
ies and villages to create commissions on hu
man relations for constructively resolving group
tensions and encouraging other municipal agen
cies to eliminate or prevent discrimination.
ELIMINATION OF discrimination, however,
will not in itself bring about full equality of
opportunity. We must do a great deal more to
upgrade education, training and job opportuni
ties for minority groups.
We must create 20 million new jobs in the
next five years to provide enough jobs for the
nation's expanding labor force including
members of minority groups, for whom unem
ployment rates are now substantially higher
than the national average.
I strongly support the entire civil rights bill,
as did the overwhelming majority of House Re
publicans when they voted 138 to 34 in favor of
the bill.
This legislation is already three years too
late. Both the 1-960 Republican and Democratic
Platforms pledged comprehensive action on civil
rights.
But despite th e Democratic campaign
promises, despite 2 to 1 Democratic control of
Congressional Committees and despite very sub
stantial majorities in the House and Senate,
action on comprehensive civil rights measures
was not advocated by the Democratic Adminis
st rat ion until mid-1963.
THE GREATEST THREAT to the bill is.
of course, the filibuster by the Southern Demo
cratic Senators and the danger that this will
lead to a compromise on one of the key provi
sions. There must not be any compromise. The
bill should pass as it now stands and without
any further delay.
Senator Goldwater has said that he would
never vote for cloture — i.e., against filibuster.
In this I believe he departs from the heritage
of our Party. The Republican Platform of 1960
went well beyond supporting cloture under pres
ent: rules. It pledged: "Our best efforts to
change Rule 22 of the Senate and other appro
priate Congressional procedures that often
make unattainable proper legislative implemen
tation of constitutional guarantees."
I support the 1960 Platform on Rule 22.
In 1961, America cannot tolerate a situation
in which all American citizens arc expected to
for their nation and pay taxes but not
all of them enjoy the rights and privileges of
citizenship as set forth in the Constitution and
the laws of the land.

It I were a Negro, I don't think I would bo
very patient either. I think that the problem is
discrimination more than segregation.
We must always make a sharp distinction
between civil rights guaranteed under the Con
stitution and those rights of association that
are basically moral issues and cannot be re
solved by passing unenforceable Federal laws.
The rights to vote, lo equal treatment be
fore the law. to hold property, and to the pro
tection of contracts these rights are guaran
teed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend
ments to the Constitution. They should be en
forced rigorously.
In the schools, the Attorney General has
authority through court decrees and existing
laws to effect integration. The criticism I
would aim at the Attorneys General we have
had is that they haven't used the machinery.
But if it develops that more authority must be
granted in this particular area, we should write
a law that is tightly drawn - that can be used
with precision, like a rifle, not a shotgun.
I favor the proposal to expand job training
and vocational educational programs because
the heart of the racial question is largely eco
nomic. Negroes want job equality.
In regard to the withholding of federal funds
from states in which discrimination is being
practiced, the Republican party was going to
take a position that such withholding should be
mandatory. We don't want it to be discretion
ary. because this gives the President too much
power which could be abused.
I ALSO FKEL that under the commerce
clause of the Constitution bus companies, air
lines, railroads, etc., engaged in interstate com
merce, cannot deny any citizen the right to
their facilities.
As a merchant, I feel that a man in business
who advertises for customers to come to his
store or place of business and to make purchases
from him should not deny that customer, re
gardless of race, creed, or color, the opportun
ity to purchase in any department of that .slore
or business.
As for the proposed public accommodations
law, it raises grave constitutional questions and
is a clear example of a new law that will only
hinder, not help, the cause of racial tolerance.
It is an invitation to improper interference by
the Federal Government with the right of as
sembly and the use of private property. It
could open the door to a police-state system of
enforcement that would eventually threaten the
liberty of all.
No matter how we try, we cannot pass a
law that will make you like me or me like you.
The key to racial and religious tolerance lies
not in laws alone but, ultimately, in the hearts
of men.
I BKIJKVE individual actions by every
American will eliminate the stigma of discrimi
nation from our society. My record, of course,
was made in my own State. I stand on my
legislative record in Washington, where I voted
for both of the civil rights bills during the Eisen
how Administration.
In Arizona, my retail company has always
hired Negroes, some of them in very respon
sible positions.
When I became adjutant general of the Ari
zona Air National Guard, I integrated that or
ganization, and it ultimately resulted in the
whole Guard movement being integrated.
I have been a member of the local NAACP
in Phoenix and am a member of the Urban
League, which is dedicated to the advancement
of oqual right. I am proud of the fact that a
poll of the National Retail Merchants Associa
tion, of which I am a member, showed that out
of 833 stores in 335 cities, only two had not
voluntarily integrated their facilities.
Rut unenforceable government edicts bene
fit no one. Continued public attention and moral
persuasion, I believe, will do more in the long
run to create the good will necessary to the
acceptance ol decent racial relations in all seg
ments. of our society.
